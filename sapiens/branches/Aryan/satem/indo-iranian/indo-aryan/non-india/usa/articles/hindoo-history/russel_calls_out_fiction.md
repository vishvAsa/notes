A Bit of India in Washington


Edmund Russell, an Indian Traveler and Student, Describes 'Land of the Lotus' and its Inhabitants-- Severely Scores Kipling and His Work-- Calls the Realist 'Incarnation of Journalistic Impudence'

If a man who lived his whole life in Washington were put under the influence of a powerful opiate and carried, unaware, to the apartments of Mr. Edmund Russell, in the northwestern section of this city he would, on regaining consciousness, rub his eyes, stare about him and come to the conclusion that he had been transported by some occult power to the sleeping room of a rajah in India.

Had he read the 'Arabian Nights,' he would look about him for the wonderful lamp of Aladdin, and, unable to discover it, probably lapse once more into satisfied unconsciousness.
Mr. Russell has recently returned from an extended tour through India and the decorations of his rooms-- gifts from the royalty of the Land of the Lotus-- are souvenirs of his journey.  
He intends to spend a year in Washington and devote his entire time to the preparation of a book on his adventures and studies.  
Did as Indians Did.

During Mr. Russell's stay in India he did as the Indian did. he lived among them. He lived with them. His life was their life. he sat on the floor with his legs crossed and dined with Brahmin families.
He studied their art, their religion, their poetry, their literature, and their wonderful romance. he spoke before thousands of native Indians...
and at the end of one of his lectures was embraced by an Indian prince, who exclaimed: 'You are my brother!' You are more oriental than the Orientals'

Mr. Russell's knowledge of India is not the result of an occasional glance during a flying trip. He has visited every part of the country and met every type of the inhabitant.  
Because of this intimate association with the natives of India, he expects to write a book upon their country which will be unique, inasmuch as it will contain the truth without political, religious or racial prejudice.  
'There have been three classes of books dealing with India,' said Mr. Russell, in an interview with a representative of the Times, 'and they have been written by three classes of authors. There are the tourists' book, the missionary's book and the English book.  
'From the numerous ridiculous things that have been published about our own country by excursionists from Europe, the average American realizes what little credence is to be placed in the fleeting impressions of one who rushes through a country with luggage in one hand and his notebook in the other. The book may be cleverly done and interesting fiction, but as a picture of the country or a description of its inhabitants, as truthful as the Fables of Aesop

> 'After the tourist's, the average missionary's book is the worst that is written upon India and her people. The missionary goes into the East, filled with zeal and enthusiasm, to teach a people who are themselves the spiritual teachers of the world'  
'He fails. He finds instead of barbarians, cultured people and, overwhelmed by the futility of his efforts, writes a volume of horrors to be read at home by those who drop their pennies into the box'
'One may go to any country in the world and find a state of conditions, social and moral, that are terrible, if one only looks for the worst.  
That is precisely what many writers of books upon India have done. From the humanitarian standpoint, these teachers may give much to India, Their work in schools, hospitals, by the roadside, and in the homes of the poor, is full of earnestness, devotion, and self-sacrifice but they go in ignorance of what they would overthrow and attack what is already lovely and holy. The departmental Englishman frequently spends his leisure hours in preparing a book upon India. He looks on the people of whom he writes from the viewpoint of a sovereign and, in addition to the atmosphere of official superiority that pervades his writing, he is frequently influenced by the fact that, from his own choice, he was born an Englishman.  
I am held by the charm of this work. All my life I have been interested in India and have fortunately had many Indian friends. Originally, I had planned fifteen chapters on my travels. Already they have grown to forty-nine. One was to be devoted to the 'Women of India.'  
'I have written six. I had expected to discuss the religions of the country under a single caption and have nearly completed nine chapters upon this most interesting topic.  
'The women of India have invariably been depicted by foreign writers as insipid creatures, who flit through the streets with veils drawn across their features, who have about as much courage as little birds in cages. This is absolutely false.  
> 
> Numerous instances might be cited of their wonderful courage in a national criss. One that occurs to me at present is that of Rani, who, mounted upon an elephant, led her troops successfully against a fortified city, defended by the bravest of troops.  
She was killed in the thick of the fight, and died, during her soldiers to the attack, in full armor and still wearing the veil.  

'What do the inhabitants of India think of Kipling and his work?' Mr. Russell was asked. 'Kipling!' he exclaimed. 'Why, they don't know who he is. Kipling doesn't write of the Indian; his ballads and stories deal with the Anglo-Indian and the Anglo-Indian servant'

> 'The princes and learned men could not understand his jargon if they attempted to read it. When they wish to read the English poets they take a copy of Shakespeare or Milton. They know nothing of modern realistic studies. In their own literature they can read only the epics, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, the Vedas, and their holy books. I have known the princes of India, when visiting Queen Victoria and London and overwhelmed by social attentions, to keep their Mahabharat or Bhagavad-Gita on the table in their sleeping apartments and read a little every day'

'But doesn't Kipling present the true color and atmosphere of the country?'

> 'As his own people wish to see it-- yes. As Americans like to read of it-- yes but to the Indian or one who loves India, Kipling's pages are pictures of the outcaste, the lowest element-- and offence and horror. Above all else the natives of India are idealists. They live in an atmosphere of idealistic romance.  
Kipling, on the other hand, is a pronounced realist. he sees the dirt and filth in everything and smears it over his pages. When he writes of a drunken brawl you can see the tipsy soldiers staggering across the page. You can see the blood u[on their faces'  
'The Indians whom he depicts are ghastly warriors, rushing the guard at night, cutting the tent ropes, and spearing the struggling soliders'  
'Of the better classes he seems to know little, or care little and write less. He is the incarnation of journalistic impudence, and thinks it smart to open a shrine and slap the idol in the face'

'What do the natives of India think of the United States?' Mr. Russell was asked.

> 'Some know us only as the place whence they get their oil.'
'But the intelligent men look up to America as the land of freedom and remember with deepest gratitude the great shiploads of provisions that were sent to India by this country during the famine.'  
'Many of them have studied our politics and educational system, and are well informed on the history and important current events of America'

During his tour through India, Mr. Russell was royally entertained. At Baroda he was the guest of H.H. the Galkwar, whom he had known in London, and for whom he has the greatest admiration
