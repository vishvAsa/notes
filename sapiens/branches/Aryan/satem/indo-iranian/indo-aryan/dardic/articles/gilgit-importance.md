Gilgit-Baltistan – The Crossroad of Asia

A long Thread on the 7000 years’ history of Gilgit-Baltistan and its enduring geo-political Significance 

Geography, as they say, shapes history. The history of Gilgit and Baltistan is proof of this. Sitting at the crossroads of India, China, and civilizations towards the West, Gilgit-Baltistan has long been a hotspot for trade, cultural exchange, and geo-political tussle. 

The earliest human activity in Gilgit-Baltistan dates back from 5000 to 1000 BCE, evident from carvings of animals, men, and hunting scenes. These carvings provide a rich window into ancient life. Once upon a time, the region was known as Dardistan. It was the home of the Darada tribe. Historical texts across cultures mention the tribe and its region.

Ancient Indian texts portray them as warlike mountain dwellers. The Mahabharata mentions Arjuna's journey to the region during the Rajasuya Yajna. Purana-s such as Vayu Purana, Brahmanda Purana, and Vamana Purana, refer to the Darada Kingdom in the context of Kambojas, Chinas, Tusharas, Bahlikas & other tribes residing around Uttarapatha. Greek and Roman historians talk about the region as well.

Ptolemy places the Daradas below the sources of the Indus River, while Herodotus labels them as Dadicae, associating them with a gold-producing region west of Tibet.

Buddhism flourished in the region and played a significant role in the region's religious landscape. Buddhist carvings and inscriptions in Kharoshthi and Brahmi script, provide critical archaeological insights into the region's past. Engravings depicting Shri Krishna and Balaram can also be found in Chilas, indicating a period of Hindu influence. 

Ancient Jaina literature offers one of the earliest references to the perilous hanging passages of the region that appears in the Jain epic "Vasudevhindi" (वसुदेवहिण्डी) by Sanghadasa Gani from the 5th century CE. This narrative depicts Charuddata's adventures across these treacherous paths, describing the use of Shankupatha or hanging passageways fashioned from ropes, wooden branches, or planks above the cliffs.

The geography of the region accorded it immense geo-political significance and it became a hotspot for trade, cultural exchange, and millennia-long power struggle. The region offered routes to Kashgar, a vital junction on the Silk Road, and to Ladakh and Khotan.

It was home to passes through Hindukush that connected with Afghanistan and also routes that went south towards the Arabian Sea. Consequently, Gilgit-Baltistan became a crucial junction on the Silk Route, connecting China, India, and Central Asia.

Passes such as Mintaka and Kilik became key entry points into the upper Hunza valley, facilitating the passage of traders, pilgrims, monks, and diplomats. For well over a thousand years, the region remained a point of conflict between all major powers such as Chinese dynasties, Indian Kingdoms, Greeks, Islamic rulers, Ancient Tibet, and the Mongols.

Control over trade and natural resources was key to prosperity. However, even during periods of political instability, these routes remained pivotal for trade, further highlighting the region's geo-political significance. The region's medieval era saw frequent raids on the Kashmir Valley by the Daradas.

European explorers like Edward Knight and Francis Younghusband, who visited during the British era, documented the perilous nature of the footpaths and conditions in the region.

The geopolitical significance of the region endures in the 21st century. If anything, it has only increased. Today, its rich history and cultural heritage, coupled with its strategic significance, make Gilgit-Baltistan a pivotal region in the Indian subcontinent.
