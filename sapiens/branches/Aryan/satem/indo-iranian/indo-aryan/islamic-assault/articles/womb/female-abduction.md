Ganga-Jamuna Tehzeeb before the rise of the Marathas is a myth.

The reality behind the tern is that Ganga and Yamuna rivers both were closely used by Nawabs of Agra and Bangāl to disguise themselves as Hindus during Hindu festivals and carry off young Hindu girls through boats.

> Law was by no means an admirer of Aliverdi Khan's successor, Siraj-ud-daula, a young man of twenty-four or twenty-five, very common in appearance. 
> 
> Before the death of Aliverdi Khan the character of Siraj-ud-daula was reported to be one of the worst ever known. In fact, he had distinguished himself not only by all sorts of debauchery, but by a revolting cruelty. The Hindu women are accustomed to bathe on the banks of the Ganges. Siraj-ud-daula, who was informed by his spies which of them were beautiful, sent his satellites in disguise in little boats to carry them off. He was often seen, in the season when the river overflows, causing the ferry boats to be upset or sunk in order to have the cruel pleasure of watching the terrified confusion of a hundred people at a time, men, women, and children, of whom many, not being able to swim, were sure to perish, When it became necessary to get rid of some great lord or minister, Siraj-ud-daula alone appeared in the business, Aliverdi Khan retiring to one of his houses or gardens outside the town, so that he might not hear the cries of the persons whom he was causing to be killed.

> So bad was the reputation of this young prince, that many persons, among them Mr. Watts, imagined it impossible that the people would ever tolerate his accession.

Both Alivardi Khan and Siraj-Ud-Daulah are represented as local heroes by leftists in Bangāl who fought for "India" against the Marathas and Britishers. In truth it was Alivardi who gave British the estate of Calcutta against Marathas. 

Murshid Quli Khan Turkman was one of the countless Mughal officers who used to take advantage of rebellions to capture all beautiful Hindu women from every single village he would conquer and mass-violate them all. This was commonplace.

> For instance, we read how a local faujdar named Murshid Quli Khan Turkman (who died in 1638) took advantage of his campaigns against refractory tenants to gratify his lust. When the villagers were defeated he seized all their most beautiful women and placed them in his harem. Another practice of this licentious officer is thus described in the Masirul-umara (iii. 422): “On the birthday of Krishna, a vast gathering of Hindu men and women takes place at Govardhan on the Jamuna opposite Mathura. The Khan, painting his forehead and wearing a dhoti like a Hindu, used to walk up and down in the crowd. Whenever he saw a woman whose beauty filled even the Moon with envy, he snatched her away like a wolf pouncing upon a flock, and placing her in the boat which his men had kept ready on the bank, he sped to Agra. The Hindu [for shame] never divulged what had happened to his daughter."
