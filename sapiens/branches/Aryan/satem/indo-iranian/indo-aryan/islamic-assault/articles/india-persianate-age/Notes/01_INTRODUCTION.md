For contemporaries it was not religion that ordered the world, but a heightened awareness of insider vs outsider. Such a perspective demonized foreigners in much the same way that ancient Greeks had demonized non-Greek-speakers, in the process inventing, for Europeans, the notion of the barbarian Other.

[^10]: The same pattern extends to archaeology, a discipline bedevilled by the assumption that a given artefact indicates a particular religious identity, and that the use of such an artefact, once identified as ‘Hindu’ or ‘Muslim’, was confined to a particular historical period, such as ‘Rajput’ or ‘Sultanate’. See Supriya Varma and Jaya Menon, ‘Archaeology and the Construction of Identities in Medieval North India’, *Studies in History* 24, no. 2 \(2008\), pp. 173–93.

[^13]: ‘Persianate’ is an adjectival construction analogous to Germanic, Latinate, Italianate, Hellenic, Indic, Hispanic, etc., all of which refer to the wide range of culture derived from, or based on, a particular language or literary tradition. Its acceptance in academic and publishing circles is seen in the many book, series and journal titles that have appeared since around 2010, and which foreground the term.

[^14]: See Owen Cornwall, ‘Alexander and the Persian Cosmopolis, 1000–1500’ \(PhD dissertation, Cambridge University, 2016\). ‘Whereas the medieval European Alexander romance traditions were about faraway places,’ notes Cornwall, ‘the Persian Alexander epics were about home and the process of making home into the world. Many of the cities Alexander founded were in the Persian cosmopolis. Alexander’s journeys, therefore, had immediate referents and political consequences. For medieval European readers, Alexander’s encounters with Brahmins in India would have seemed impossibly far away. In medieval India, on the other hand, Muslim rulers encountered Brahmins every day.’ Ibid., p. 12.

[^21]: The notion of justice found no exact counterpart in Sanskrit. The term for ‘justice’ used by Baddena is *nyaayam*, a Sanskrit term usually used in the sense of ‘logic’, ‘reason’ or ‘principle’. It can carry the sense of ‘justice’ in *dharma-śastra* literature when court cases and lawsuits are discussed. But these seem to be secondary, more specialized meanings. Until Baddena, the term was never elevated to the status of *the* fundamental principle of statecraft.
