[^4]: The British would later describe the acculturation of their own people in South Asia as ‘browning in the Indian sun’. But the contrasts between the Mughal and British imperial enterprises in this respect are instructive. Whereas earlier generations of East India Company servants had, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, adopted a wide spectrum of Indian culture, in the course of the early nineteenth century they became progressively more distant from their colonial subjects. With the Mughals it was the other way around, as an originally foreign dynasty over time became progressively more indigenized.

[^22]: The founder of his Kachwaha lineage had been a devotee of the Ramanandi sage Krishnadas Payohari of Galta, a relationship that prefigured the royal devotionalism that would soon sweep through many kingdoms of western India as Rajput rulers began to embrace Vaishnavism.

[^24]: Rulers of those states had understood Vaishnava Hinduism as less political and hence less threatening, unlike India’s many Śaiva cults, which had a long history of underwriting Hindu royal sovereignty.

[^25]: Sreenivasan, ‘Rethinking’, p. 577. The same was true in Orissa. In 1589, after a successful campaign in which local Afghan landholders \(*zamindar*s\) in coastal Orissa were dislodged from power, a temple to the regional deity Jagannath in Puri was rebuilt – according to Kachwaha chronicles, by Man Singh, the conquering Mughal officer; and according to local Oriya chronicles, by a local chief. In any event, Man Singh claimed the city and its temple for Mughals, who administered revenues from the temple and the city. Ibid., pp. 575–6.

[^28]: This preoccupation was already becoming visible earlier in the sixteenth century, when legends circulated that clans such as the Chauhans, the Chalukyas, the Paramaras and the Pratiharas had been born in a sacrificial fire pit on Mount Abu in western Rajasthan, thereby distinguishing them from other clans of the warrior class, or *kshatriya*s.

[^33]: Architecturally, one sees this most clearly in the Atiya mosque in modern Tangail District, Bangladesh. Built by Afghan patrons in 1609, this mosque, with its complex terracotta façade, its ringed corner towers and its curved cornice, is a highly evolved elaboration of the much older Bengal sultanate style, itself modelled on building practices and aesthetics of Bengali folk culture.

[^35]: One contemporary observer wrote that ‘the cavalry is regarded as in every way the flower of the army’, adding that Akbar ‘spared no expense in order to maintain an efficient, and as far as possible, perfectly-equipped force of cavalry to guard the empire.’ *The Commentary of Father Monserrate, S.J., on his Journey to the Court of Akbar*, trans.

[^43]: As he wrote, ‘People travel in all directions from islands to mountains and seas to meet the Ranas and Rauts, but you would find all of them together here at the door \[of the Sharqi court\] … \[Rajaputs from\] Telanga, Vanga, Cola, and Kalinga were all there. They, rajaputas and brahmanas \[*pandia*\] alike, shivered with fear, gathered courage and made submissions in their own languages *ni-a bhasa* \[before the Sultan’s court\].’ Quoted in ibid., p. 337. The passage comes from Vidyapati’s *Kirttilata*, which was composed in Avahatta, an early stage in the evolution of eastern Indian languages such as Bengali, Maithili, Assamese and Oriya.

[^44]: ‘Permanence of dominion’ is the phrase found in early-nineteenth-century British discourse regarding the East India Company’s rapid expansion of power in India. See, for example, Francis G. Hutchins, *The Illusion of Permanence: British Imperialism in India* \(Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1967\).

[^47]: As Hasan put it, ‘Since the political system required a continuous partaking of “shares” in sovereignty in favour of the local power holders, the Mughal state was continually undermined by its own beneficiaries.’ Ibid., p. 126.
