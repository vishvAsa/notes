*Attention all non-Muslim parents:* Today I was called to help in a love-jihad case. In the last three months, this is the fourth or fifth such case. I am writing this because it's very necessary to make parents aware of the risks children are facing. 

1. Out of the five odd cases that have come to me, only one is what is known to be a 'lower' caste. 
2.G irls are trapped at any age. One was a widow with two children. But all other girls were between 14 and 16 when the affair started. 
3. In almost all cases, the boys take the girls out on bike rides. Girls are made to feel that this is 'freedom'. 
4. The Muslim boys are trained to make the girls sexually aware. They then start by holding hands, giving a friendly hug, touching inappropriate places by 'mistake'. They then move on to kissing and physical relationship when the girl is in 10th or 12th and under educational stress. Videos of their physical relationship is made secretly. 
5. Most parents are unaware till it is too late. 
6. Once parents come to know and try to break the relationship, either the girl is pressured to run away, or the girls are blackmailed to continue relationship by blackmailing them with videos of their physical relationship. Till this point, the girl is unaware that a video was made without her knowledge. 
7. If the girl insists on breaking up, the boy will get his friends to force physical relationship with the girl with threat or blackmail. All the time, he will keep saying that he will marry the girl. 
8. If parents interfere, the boy will stay away temporarily. Once the girl is 18, this starts again and this time the girl is completely trapped. 
9. Mostly, marriage takes place. Girl is converted. For about six months, there are no problems. Then starts the torture. Continuous pregnancies and termination of pregnancies take place. 
10. After two years, the boy will get married again to some other girl while remaining married to the first girl. 
11. Now the first girl will definitely resist. To keep her in the marriage, she is raped by boy's father and brothers. Other women members of the family will beat the girl routinely. 
12. Police and other family members (if still on talking terms) will counsel the girl to adjust and continue in the marriage. 
13. In many cases, if the girl resists, she will be jailed inside the house without a mobile. 
14. If she manages to run away, she will not get custody of the children or get only one child custody. The other child(ren) will remain with husband. 
15. Even if court gives monthly maintenance, husband will never pay. 
    - It is an unusual marriage because girl will be converted only after marriage, NOT BEFORE. So she cannot claim right to husband's property. But boy can claim right to girl's parent's property as per Hindu customs! 
16. Please enlighten your children of this Muslim menace called love jihad before too late. 
    
*Share this with all non-Muslim parents.* *It's a curse to this Nation to have such a minded society. Hindus have lost their soil Pakistan*
