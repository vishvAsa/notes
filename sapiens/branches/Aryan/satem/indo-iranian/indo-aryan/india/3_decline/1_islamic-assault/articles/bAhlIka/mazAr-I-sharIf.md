Today, Mazar-I-Sharif is most famous for its blue mosque. According to Afghan Muslims, this mosque contains the tomb of Prophet's son in law Ali.

In 20th century, there was an earthquake that shattered a part of the structure. What unearthed from it? You guessed it right.

What emerged from the unearthed part were remains of an earlier structure and an inscription. This inscription was written in Sharada script which was the script used by Hindus and Buddhists in Kashmir and Afghanistan. Date of inscription: 10th century. Language: Sanskrit. This was the inscription of the Shahi ruler Veka. The Shahis were the last Hindu rulers of Afghanistan, lasting until 10th century. Inscription has been published by Ahmad Hasan Dani. It records establishment of Shiva temple and consecration of the images of Shiva and Uma.

To ponder. It was an unexpected natural event that unearthed this history and the inscription. Otherwise, we would never have known. As archaeological excavations are not conducted at such Islamic holy places. How many more inscriptions are buried? Would they ever be uncovered?
