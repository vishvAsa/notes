A R Rahman's peer is Syed Karimullah Shah Qadri. Some interesting stories of the Qadiriyya peers at Vellore
</details>

## Sayyid Shah Modin Qadiri
Ali Sahib was a police peon employed at Vellore, a prominent South Indian garrison town. During the month of Ramadan in 1839, he visited a mosque located on the grounds of the huge military fort complex at Vellore. It was at that time, he claimed, that he heard a maulvi (teacher of Islamic law) denouncing the British as kafirs (infidels) and exhorting Muslims to wage jihad against them. The maulvi, Sayyid Shah Modin Qadiri came from a family of clerics who had presided over the same mosque for generations. Ali Sahib was one of twenty-nine Muslims who reported to Vellore officials that they had heard Modin's seditious messages. He recounted being seated in Modin's mosque amongst Muslim sepoys, government workers, and other persons of rank. He then heard what was widely referred to as Modin's jihad wa'z (sermon or exhortation):1

> There were many people present. And after prayers the Maulvi read wa'z to this effect: It is a decree of Allah that the Mussalmen are to make the [jihad] against the kafirs, that although necessity now obliges them to eat the salt of kafirs that the intention is to be kept in the heart and when the day and favorable opportunity offers them united in heart and mind, they must slay them whether these kafirs are rulers or not.

Based on such allegations, Maulvi Modin was tried for sedition in a criminal court at Chittoor (a city located roughly sixty kilometers to the north of Vellore).


## Qayim Shah  
He is the leader of the faqirs in this place. He belongs to the Arsan Shahi group connected with the Tusiyyas who hold the seventh rank in the Qüdiriyya order. Its relationship is traced to Sultanu'l-awliya Hazrat Abdu'l-Qadir Jiläni through Hazrat Sayyid Abdu'l-Razzaq, the great murshid. As a youth he came over here from Hindustan. He was the cause for the destruction of twelve temples. He lived to an old age and passed away on the 17th of Safar 1193 A.II. He is interred in Warür.

## Hazrat Nur Muhammad Qadiri
Hazrat Nur Muhammad Qadiri was the most unique man regarded as an invaluable person of his age. Very often he was the cause of the ruin of temples. Some of these were laid waste. He selected his own burial ground in the vicinity of the temple.
In brief, he was a virtuous person. Although he lived five hundred years ago, people at large still remember his greatness.
