The British empire wouldn't have happened without India. The sheer scale of Indian involvement is British colonization is mind blowing when one goes into the details. The military part should be better known by now. But India is why the British could conquer in the first place. But it goes way beyond that. 

See Burma. First Britain conquers it using the British Indian army. Then a lot of Indians come in to build the infra. The Indians bureaucrats come in to run the place. Then Indian merchants come in to run the merchant networks. Chettiars from Tamil Nadu setup money lending business which lends to Burmese farmers. Burma goes from subsistence farming to rice exporting powerhouse in a few decades. Half of Rangoon becomes Indians.

In Kenya, uganda, you see Indian merchants setup shop and dominating the business scene in a few decades. In Sri Lanka you see Indians dominating the bureaucracy.

Fiji is truly tragicomical story. The islanders are good at war, bad at actually working. They actually request Britain for Indian workers to work in the plantations. Indians dominate the scene in a few decades.

Of course all these stories are tragic in a way. Indians get vilified in all these places. They get kicked out in many of these places. Then all the places collapse without Indians. 

You see heritage Indians in weird corners of the world today. Mauritius, Guyana, Fiji, Caribbean, Africa. The sun truly set on the British empire when it lost India.
