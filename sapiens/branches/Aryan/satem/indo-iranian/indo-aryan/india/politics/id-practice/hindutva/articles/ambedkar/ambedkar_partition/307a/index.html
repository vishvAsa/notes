<p>PART III</p>
<p>WHAT IF NOT PAKISTAN?</p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>CHAPTER VII</p>
<p>HINDU ALTERNATIVE TO PAKISTAN</p>
<p>I<br>
[Lala Hardayal&rsquo;s scheme for conversion in the North-West]</p>
<p>Thinking of the Hindu alternative to Pakistan, the scheme that at
once comes to one&rsquo;s mind is the one put forth by the late Lala Hardayal
in 1925. It was published in the form of a statement which appeared in
the <strong>Pratap</strong> of Lahore. In this statement, which he called his
political testament, Lala Hardayal said:—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I declare that the future of the Hindu race, of Hindustan and of the
Punjab, rests on these four pillars: (1) Hindu Sangathan, (2) Hindu
Raj, (3) Shuddhi of Moslems, and (4) Conquest and Shuddhi of
Afghanistan and the Frontiers. So long as the Hindu nation does not
accomplish these four things, the safely of our children and
great-grandchildren will be ever in danger, and the safety of the
Hindu race will be impossible. The Hindu race has but one history, and
its institutions are homogeneous. But the Musalmans and Christians are
far removed from the confines of Hindustan, for their religions are
alien and they love Persian, Arab and European institutions. Thus,
just as one removes foreign matter from the eye, Shuddhi must be made
of these two religions. Afghanistan and the hilly regions of the
frontier were formerly part of India, but are at present under the
domination of Islam. . . .Just as there is Hindu religion in Nepal, so
there must be Hindu institutions in Afghanistan and the frontier
territory; otherwise it is useless to win Swaraj. For mountain tribes
are always warlike and hungry. If they become our enemies, the age of
Nadirshah and Zamanshah will begin anew. At present English officers
are protecting the frontiers; but it cannot always be. . . .If Hindus
want to protect themselves, they must conquer Afghanistan and the
frontiers and convert all the mountain tribes.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>I do not know how many Hindus would come forward to give their support
to this scheme of Lala Hardayal as an alternative to
Pakistan.<strong><a href="#n01">/1/</a></strong></p>
<p>In the first place, Hindu religion is not a proselytising religion.
Maulana Mahomed Ali was quite right when, in the course of his address
as President of the Congress, he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Now, this has been my complaint for a long lime against Hinduism, and
on one occasion, lecturing at Allahabad in 1907, I had pointed out the
contrast between Musalmans and Hindus, by saying that the worst that
can be said of a Muslim was that he had a tasteless mess which he
called a dish fit for kings, and wanted all to share it with him,
thrusting it down the throats of such as did not relish it and would
rather not have it, while his Hindu brother, who prided himself on his
cookery, retired into the privacy of his kitchen and greedily devoured
all that he had cooked, without permitting even the shadow of his
brother to fall on his food, or sparing even a crumb for him. This was
said not altogether in levity; and in fact, I once asked Mahatma
Gandhi to justify this feature of his faith to me.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>What answer the Mahatma gave to his question, Mr. Mahmed Ali did not
disclose. The fact is that however much the Hindus may wish, Hindu
religion cannot become a missionary religion like Islam or Christianity.
It is not that the Hindu religion was never a missionary religion. On
the contrary, it was once a missionary religion—indeed could not but
have been a missionary religion, otherwise it is difficult to explain
how it could have spread over an area so vast as the Indian
continent.<strong><a href="#n02">/2/</a></strong> But once a missionary religion, Hinduism
perforce ceased to be a missionary religion after the time when the
Hindu society developed its system of castes. For caste is incompatible
with conversion. To be able to convert a stranger to its religion, it is
not enough for a community to offer its creed. It must be in a position
to admit the convert to its social life and to absorb and assimilate him
among its kindred. It is not possible for the Hindu society to satisfy
this prerequisite of effective conversion. There is nothing to prevent a
Hindu, with a missionary zeal, to proceed to convert an alien to the
Hindu faith. But before he converts the alien, he is bound to be
confronted with the question: What is to be the caste of the convert?
According to the Hindus, for a person to belong to a caste he must be
born in it. A convert is not born in a caste, therefore he belongs to no
caste. This is also an important question. More than political or
religious, man is a social animal. He may not have, need not have,
religion; he may not have, need not have, politics. He must have
society; he cannot do without society. For a Hindu to be without caste
is to be without society. Where there is no society for the convert, how
can there be any conversion? So long as Hindu society is fragmented in
autonomous and autogenic castes, Hindu religion cannot be a missionary
religion. The conversion of the Afghans and the frontier tribes to
Hinduism is, therefore, an idle dream.</p>
<p>In the second place, Lala Hardayal&rsquo;s scheme must call for financial
resources the immensity of which it is hardly possible to compute. Who
can furnish the funds necessary for the conversion of the Afghans and
the Frontier Tribesmen to Hinduism? The Hindus, having ceased to convert
others to their faith for a long time, have also lost the zeal for
conversion. Want of zeal is bound to affect the question of finances.
Further, Hindu society being moulded in the cast of the Chaturvarna,
wealth has, from very ancient times, been most unevenly distributed. It
is only the Baniya who is the heir to wealth and property among the
Hindus. There are, of course, the landlords who are the creation of
foreign invaders or native rebels, but they are not as numerous as the
Baniya. The Baniya is money-made and his pursuits are solely for private
gain. He knows no other use of money except to hold it and to transmit
it to his descendants. Spread of religion or acquisition and promotion
of culture do not interest him. Even decent living has no place in his
budget. This has been his tradition for ages. If money is excepted, he
is not much above the brute in the conception and manner of life. Only
one new service, on the expenditure side, has found a place in his
budget. That service is politics. This happened since the entry of Mr.
Gandhi as a political leader. That new service is the support of
Gandhian politics. Here again, the reason is not love of politics. The
reason is to make private gain out of public affairs. What hope is there
that such men will spend money on such a bootless cause as the spread of
Hindu religion among the Afghans and Frontier Tribes?</p>
<p>Thirdly, there is the question of facilities for conversion that may
be available in Afghanistan. Lala Hardayal evidently thought that it is
possible to say in Afghanistan, with the same impunity as in Turkey,
that the <strong>Koran</strong> is wrong or out of date. Only one year before the
publication of his political testament by Lala Hardayal, i.e., in 1924;
one Niamatulla—a follower of Mirza Ghulam Ahamed of Quadiyan—who claimed
to be the messiah and Mahdi and a prophet of a sort—was stoned to
death**<a href="#n03">/3/</a>** at Kabul by the order of the highest ecclesiastical
tribunal of Afghanistan. The crime of this man was, as reported by a
Khilafat paper, that he was professing and preaching ideas and beliefs,
inconsistent with Islam and Shariat. This man, says the same paper, was
stoned to death according to the agreeing judgements of the first
Shariat (canon) Court, the Central Appellate Court and the Ulema and
Divines of the final Appellate Committee of the Ministry of Justice. In
the light of these difficulties, the scheme must be said to be wild in
its conception and is sure to prove ruinous in its execution. It is
adventurous in character and is too fantastic to appeal to any
reasonable man except perhaps some fanatical Arya Samajists of the
Punjab.</p>
<p>II<br>
[The stand of Mr. V. D. Savarkar and the Hindu Maha Sabha]</p>
<p>The stand taken by Hindu Mahasabha has been defined by Mr. V. D.
Savarkar, the President of the Sabha, in his presidential addresses at
the annual sessions of the Sabha. As defined by him, the Hindu Maha
Sabha is against Pakistan and proposes to resist it by all means. What
these means are we do not know. If they are force, coercion and
resistance, they are only negative alternatives and Mr. Savarkar and the
Hindu Maha Sabha alone can say how far these means will succeed.</p>
<p>It would, however, not be fair to Mr. Savarkar to say that he has
only a negative attitude towards the claim put forth by the Muslims of
India. He has put forth his positive proposals in reply to them.</p>
<p>To understand his positive proposals, one must grasp some of his
basic conceptions. Mr. Savarkar lays great stress on a proper
understanding of the terms, Hinduism, Hindutva and Hindudom. He
says:<strong><a href="#n04">/4/</a></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In expounding the ideology of the Hindu movement, it is absolutely
necessary to have a correct grasp of the meaning attached to these
three terms. From the word &ldquo;Hindu&rdquo; has been coined the word &ldquo;Hinduism&rdquo;
in English. It means the schools or system of Religion the Hindus
follow. The second word &ldquo;Hindutva&rdquo; is far more comprehensive and
refers not only to the religious aspects of the Hindu people as the
word &ldquo;Hinduism&rdquo; does but comprehend even their cultural, linguistic,
social and political aspects as well. It is more or less akin to
&ldquo;Hindu Polity&rdquo; and its nearly exact translation would be &ldquo;Hinduness.&rdquo;
The third word &ldquo;Hindudom&rdquo; means the Hindu people spoken of
collectively. It is a collective name for the Hindu World, just as
Islam denotes the Moslem World.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Savarkar takes it as a gross misrepresentation to say that the Hindu
Maha Sabha is a religious body. In refutation of this misrepresentation,
Mr. Savarkar says:<strong><a href="#n05">/5/</a></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It has come to my notice that a very large section of the English
educated Hindus hold back from joining the Hindu Maha Sabha. . .
.under the erroneous idea that it is an exclusively Religious
organization— something like a Christian Mission. Nothing could be far
from truth. The Hindu Maha Sabha is not a Hindu Mission. It leaves
Religious questions regarding theism, monotheism. Pantheism or even
atheism to be discussed and determined by the different Hindu schools
of religious persuasions. It is not a Hindu Dharma Maha Sabha, but a
Hindu National Maha Sabha. Consequently by its very constitution it is
debarred to associate itself exclusively as a partisan with any
particular religious school or sect even within the Hindu fold. As a
national Hindu body it will of course propagate and defend the
National Hindu Church comprising each and all religions of Hindusthani
origin against any non-Hindu attack or encroachment. But the sphere of
its activity is far more comprehensive than that of an exclusively
religious body. The Hindu Maha Sabha identifies itself with the
National life of Hindudom in all its entirety, in all its social,
economical, cultural and above all political aspects and is pledged to
protect and promote all that contributes to the freedom, strength and
glory of the Hindu Nation; and as an indispensable means to that end
to attain Purna Swarajya, absolute political Independence of
Hindusthan by all legitimate and proper means.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Savarkar does not admit that the Hindu Maha Sabha is started to
counteract the Muslim League and that as soon as the problems arising
out of the Communal Award are solved to the satisfaction of both Hindus
and Musalmans, the Hindu Maha Sabha will vanish. Mr. Savarkar insists
that the Hindu Maha Sabha must continue to function even after India
becomes politically free. He says:<strong><a href="#n06">/6/</a></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;. . . .Many a superficial critic seems to fancy that the Maha Sabha
was only contrived to serve as a make-weight, as a reaction
checkmating the Moslem League or the anti-Hindu policy of the present
leaders of the Congress and will be out of court or cease
automatically to function as soon as it is shorne of this spurious
excuse to exist. But if the aims and object of the Maha Sabha mean
anything it is clear that it was not the outcome of any frothy
effusion, any fussy agitation to remove a grievance here or oppose a
seasonal party there. The fact is that every organism whether,
individual or social which is living and deserves to survive throws
out offensive and defensive organs as soon as it is brought to face
adversely changing environments. The Hindu Nation too as soon as it
recovered and freed itself from the suffocating grip of the
pseudo-nationalistic ideology of the Congress brand developed a new
organ to battle in the struggle for existence under the changed
conditions of modem age. This was the Hindu Maha Sabha. It grew up of
a fundamental necessity of the National life and not of any ephemeral
incident. The constructive side of its aims and objects make it amply
clear that its mission is as abiding as the life of the Nation itself.
But that apart, even the day to day necessity of adapting its policy
to the ever changing political currents makes it incumbent on Hindudom
to have an exclusively Hindu organization independent of any moral or
intellectual servility or subservience to any non-Hindu or jointly
representative institution, to guard Hindu interests and save them
from being jeopardised. It is not so, only under the present political
subjection of Hindustan but it will be all the more necessary to have
some such exclusively Hindu organization, some such Hindu Maha Sabha
in substance whether it is identical with this present organization or
otherwise to -serve as a watchtower at the gates of Hindudom for at
least a couple of centuries to come, even after Hindustan is partially
or wholly free and a National Parliament controls its political
destiny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, unless something altogether cataclysmic in nature upsets the
whole political order of things in the world which practical politics
cannot envisage today, all that can be reasonably expected in
immediate future is that we Hindus may prevail over England and compel
her to recognise India as a self-governing unit with the status
contemplated in the Westminster Statute. Now a National Parliament in
such a self-governing India can only reflect the electorate as it is,
the Hindus and the Moslems as we find them, their relations a bit
bettered, perhaps a bit worsened. No realist can be blind to the
probability that the extraterritorial designs and the secret urge
goading on the Moslems to transform India into a Moslem stale may at
any time confront the Hindustani state even under self-government
either with a Civil War or treacherous overtures to alien invaders by
the Moslems. Then again there is every likelihood that there will ever
continue at least for a century to come a danger of fanatical riots,
the scramble for services, legislative seats, weightages out of
proportion to their population on the part of the Moslem minority and
consequently a constant danger threatening internal peace. To
checkmate this probability which if we are wise we must always keep in
view even after Hindustan attains the status of a self-governing
country, a powerful and exclusive organization of Hindudom like the
Hindu Maha Sabha will always prove a sure and devoted source of
strength, a reserve force for the Hindus to fall back upon to voice
their grievances more effectively than the joint Parliament can do, to
scent danger ahead, to warn the Hindus in time against it and to fight
out if need be any treacherous design to which the joint state itself
may unwittingly fall a victim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The History of Canada, of Palestine,of the movement of the Young
Turks will show you that in every slate where two or more such
conflicting elements as the Hindus and Moslems in India happen to
exist as constituents, the wiser of them has to keep its exclusive
organization intact, strong and watchful to defeat any attempt at
betrayal or capture of the National State by the opposite party;
especially so if that party has extra-territorial affinities,
religious or cultural, with alien bordering states.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Having stated what is Hindustan, and what is Hindu Maha Sabha, Mr.
Savarkar next proceeds to define his conception of Swaraj. According to
Mr. Savarkar:<strong><a href="#n07">/7/</a></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Swaraj to the Hindus must mean only that in which their &ldquo;Swaraj,&rdquo;
their &ldquo;Hindutva&rdquo; can assert itself without being overlorded by any
non-Hindu people, whether they be Indian Territorials or
extra-Territorials—-some Englishmen are and may continue to be
territorially born Indians. Can, therefore, the overlordships of these
Anglo-indians be a &ldquo;Swarajya&rdquo; to the Hindus? Aurangzeb or Tipu were
hereditary Indians, nay, were the sons of converted Hindu mothers. Did
that mean that the rule of Aurangzeb or Tipu was a &ldquo;Swarajya&rdquo; to the
Hindus? No! Although they were territorially Indians they proved to be
the worst enemies of Hindudom and therefore, a Shivaji, a Gobindsingh,
a Pratap or the Peshwas had to fight against the Moslem domination and
establish real Hindu Swarajya.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>As part of his Swaraj Mr. Savarkar insists upon two things.</p>
<p>Firstly, the retention of the name Hindustan as the proper name for
lndia.<strong><a href="#n08">/8/</a></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The name &ldquo;Hindustan&rdquo; must continue to be the appellation of our
country. Such other names as India, Hind, etc., being derived from the
same original word Sindhu may be used but only to signify the same
sense—the land of the Hindus, a country which is the abode of the
Hindu Nation. Aryavarta, Bharat-Bhumi and such other names are of
course the ancient and the most cherished epithets of our Mother Land
and will continue to appeal to the cultured elite. In this insistence
that the Mother Land of the Hindus must be called but &ldquo;Hindustan,&rdquo; no
encroachment or humiliation is implied in connection with any of our
non-Hindu countrymen. Our Parsee and Christian countrymen are already
too akin to us culturally and .arc too patriotic and the Anglo-indians
too sensible to refuse to fall in line with us Hindus on so legitimate
a ground. So far as our Moslem countrymen are concerned it is useless
to conceal the fact that some of them are already inclined to look
upon this molehill also as an insuperable mountain in their way to
Hindu-Moslem unity. But they should remember that the Moslems do not
dwell only in India nor are the Indian Moslems the only heroic
remnants of the Faithful in Islam. China has crores of Moslems.
Greece, Palestine and even Hungary and Poland have thousands of
Moslems amongst their nationals. But being there a minority, only a
community, their existence in these countries has never been advanced
as a ground to change the ancient names of these countries which
indicate the abodes of those races whose overwhelming majority owns
the land. The country of the Poles continues to be Poland and of the
Grecians as Greece. The Moslems there did not or dared not to distort
them but are quite content to distinguish themselves as Polish Moslems
or Grecian Moslems or Chinese Moslems when occasion arises, so also
our Moslem countrymen may distinguish themselves nationally or
territorially whenever they want, as &ldquo;Hindustance Moslems&rdquo; without
compromising in the least their separateness as Religious or Cultural
entity. Nay, the Moslems have been calling themselves as &ldquo;Hindustanis&rdquo;
ever since their advent in India, of their own accord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if in spite of it all some irascible Moslem sections amongst our
countrymen object even to this name of our Country, that is no reason
why we should play cowards to our own conscience. We Hindus must not
betray or break up the continuity of our Nation from the Sindhus in
Rigvedic days to the Hindus of our own generation which is implied in
&ldquo;Hindustan,&rdquo; the accepted appellation of our Mother Land. Just as the
land of the Germans is Germany, of the English England, of the Turks
Turkistan, of the Afghans Afghanistan—even so we must have it
indelibly impressed on the map of the earth for all times to come a
&ldquo;Hindustan&rdquo;—the land of the &ldquo;Hindus.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>The second is the retention of Sanskrit as sacred language, Hindi as
national language and Nagari as the script of Hindudom.<strong><a href="#n09">/9/</a></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The Sanskrit shall be our &ldquo;<em>devabhasha</em>&rdquo; (Deva
Bhasha)<strong><a href="#n10">/10/</a></strong> our sacred language and the &ldquo;Sanskrit
Nishtha&rdquo;<strong><a href="#n11">/11/</a></strong> Hindi, the Hindi which is derived from
Sanskrit and draws its nourishment from the latter, is our
&ldquo;<em>rashtrabhasha</em>&rdquo; (Rashtra Bhasha)<strong><a href="#n12">/12/</a></strong> our current
national language—-besides being the richest and the most cultured of
the ancient languages of the world, to us Hindus the Sanskrit is the
holiest tongue of tongues. Our scriptures, history, philosophy and
culture have their roots so deeply imbedded in the Sanskrit literature
that it forms veritably the brain of our Race. Mother of the majority
of our mother tongues, she has suckled the rest of them at her breast.
All Hindu languages current today whether derived from Sanskrit or
grafted on to it can only grow and flourish on the sap of life they
imbibe from Sanskrit. The Sanskrit language therefore must ever be an
indispensable constituent of the classical course for Hindu youths.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In adopting the Hindi as the National tongue of Hindudom no
humiliation or any invidious distinction is implied as regards other
provincial tongues. We are all as attached to our provincial tongues
as to Hindi and they will all grow and flourish in their respective
spheres. In fact some of them are today more progressive and richer in
literature. But nevertheless, taken all in all the Hindi can serve the
purpose of a National Pan-Hindu language best. It must also be
remembered that the Hindi is not made a National Language to order.
The fact is that long before either the English or even the Moslems
stepped in India the Hindi in its general form had already come to
occupy the position of a National tongue throughout Hindustan. The
Hindu pilgrim, the tradesman, the tourist, the soldier, the Pandit
travelled up and down from Bengal to Sind and Kashmere to Rameshwar by
making himself understood from locality to locality through Hindi.
Just as the Sanskrit was the National Language of the Hindu
intellectual world even so Hindi has been for at least a thousand
years in the past the National Indian Tongue of the Hindu
community&hellip;..</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Hindi we of course mean the pure &ldquo;Sanskrit Nistha&rdquo; Hindi, as we
find it for example in the &ldquo;Satyartha Prakash&rdquo; written by Maharsi
Dayananda Saraswati. How simple and untainted with a single
unnecessary foreign word is that Hindi and how expressive withal! It
may be mentioned in passing that Swami Dayanandaji was about the first
Hindu leader who gave conscious and definite expression to the view
that Hindi should be the Pan-Hindu National language of India. This
&ldquo;Sanskrit Nistha&rdquo; Hindi has nothing to do with that hybrid, the
so-called Hindusthani which is being hatched up by the Wardha scheme.
It is nothing short of a linguistic monstrosity and must be ruthlessly
suppressed. Not only that but it is our bounden duty to oust as
ruthlessly all unnecessary alien words whether Arabian or English,
from every Hindu tongue—whether provincial or dialectical. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;. . . .Our Sanskrit alphabetical order is phonetically about the most
perfect which the world has yet devised and almost all our current
Indian scripts already follow it. The Nagari Script too follows this
order. Like the Hindi language the Nagari Script too has already been
current for centuries all over India amongst the Hindu literary
circles for some two thousand years at any rate in the past and was
even popularly nick-named as the &ldquo;Shastri Lipi&rdquo; the script of our
Hindu Scriptures. . . .It is a matter of common knowledge that if
Bengali or Gujarathi is printed in Nagari it is more or less
understood by readers in several other provinces. To have only one
common language throughout Hindustan at a stroke is impracticable and
unwise. But to have the Nagari script as the only common script
throughout Hindudom is much more feasible. Nevertheless, it should be
borne in mind that the different Hindu scripts current in our
different provinces have a future of their own and may flourish side
by side with the Nagari. All that is immediately indispensable in the
common interest of Hindudom as a whole is that the Nagari Script must
be made a compulsory subject along with the Hindi language in every
school in the case of Hindu students.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>What is to be the position of the Non-Hindu minorities under the
Swaraj as contemplated by Mr. Savarkar? On this question, this is what
Mr. Savarkar has to say:<strong><a href="#n13">/13/</a></strong>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;When once the Hindu Maha Sabha not only accepts but maintains the
principles of &ldquo;one man one vote&rdquo; and the public services to go by
merit alone added to the fundamental rights and obligations to be
shared by all citizens alike irrespective of any distinction of Race
or Religion. . . .any further mention of minority rights is on the
principle not only unnecessary but self-contradictory. Because it
again introduces a consciousness of majority and minority on Communal
basis. But as practical politics requires it and as the Hindu
Sanghatanists want to relieve our non-Hindu countrymen of even a ghost
of suspicion, we are prepared to emphasise that the legitimate rights
of minorities with regard to their Religion, Culture, and Language
will be expressly guaranteed: on one condition only that the equal
rights of the majority also must not in any case be encroached upon or
abrogated. Every minority may have separate schools to train up their
children in their own tongue, their own religious or cultural
institutions and can receive Government help also for these,—but
always in proportion to the taxes they pay into the common exchequer.
The same principle must of course hold good in case of the majority
too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over and above this, in case the constitution is not based on joint
electorates and on the unalloyed National principle of one man one
vote, but is based on the communal basis then those minorities who
wish to have separate electorate or reserve seats will be allowed to
have them,—but always in proportion to their population and provided
that it does not deprive the majority also of an equal right in
proportion of its population too.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>That being the position assigned to the minorities, Mr. Savarkar
concludes**<a href="#n14">/14/</a>** that under his scheme of Swaraj:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The Moslem minority in India will have the right to be treated as
equal citizens, enjoying equal protection and civic rights in
proportion to their population. The Hindu majority will not encroach
on the legitimate rights of any non-Hindu minority. But in no case can
the Hindu majority resign its right which as a majority it is entitled
to exercise under any democratic and legitimate constitution. The
Moslem minority in particular has not obliged the Hindus by remaining
in minority and therefore, they must remain satisfied with the status
they occupy and with the legitimate share of civic and political
rights that is their proportionate due. It would be simply
preposterous to endow the Moslem minority with the right of exercising
a practical veto on the legitimate rights and privileges of the
majority and call it a &ldquo;Swarajya.&rdquo; The Hindus do not want a change of
masters, are not going to struggle and fight and die only to replace
an Edward by an Aurangazeb simply because the latter happens to be
born within Indian borders, but they want henceforth to be masters
themselves in their own house, in their own Land.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>And it is because he wants his Swaraj to bear the stamp of being a
Hindu Raj that Mr. Savarkar wants that India should have the appellation
of Hindustan.</p>
<p>This structure has been reared by Mr. Savarkar on two propositions
which he regards as fundamental.</p>
<p>The first is that the Hindu are a nation by themselves. He
enunciates this proposition with great elaboration and vehemence.
Says**<a href="#n15">/15/</a>** Mr. Savarkar:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In my Presidential speech at Nagpur I had, for the first time in the
history of our recent politics pointed out in bold relief that the
whole Congress ideology was vitiated <em>ab initio</em> by its unwitted
assumption that the territorial unity, a common habitat, was the only
factor that constituted and ought to and must constitute a Nation.
This conception of a Territorial Nationality has since then received a
rude shock in Europe itself from which it was imported wholesale to
India and the present War has justified my assertion by exploding the
myth altogether. All Nations carved out to order on the Territorial
design without any other common bond to mould each of them into a
national being have gone to rack and ruin, tumbled down like a house
of cards. Poland and Czechoslovakia will ever serve as a stem warning
against any such efforts to frame heterogeneous peoples into such
hotch-potch Nation, based only on the shifting sands of the conception
of Territorial Nationality, not cemented by any cultural, racial or
historical affinities and consequently having no common will to
incorporate themselves into a Nation. These treaty-Nations broke up at
the first opportunity they got: The German part of them went over to
Germany, the Russian to Russia, Czechs to Czechs and Poles to Poles.
The cultural, linguistic, historical and such other organic affinities
proved sponger than the Territorial one. Only those Nations have
persisted in maintaining their National unity and identity during the
last three to four centuries in Europe which had developed racial,
linguistic cultural and such other organic affinities in addition to
their Territorial unity or even at times in spite of it and
consequently willed to be homogeneous National units—such as England,
France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, etc.</p>
<p>Judged by any and all of these tests which go severally and
collectively to form such a homogeneous and organic Nation, in India
we Hindus are marked out as an abiding Nation by ourselves. Not only
do we own a common Fatherland, a Territorial unity, but what is
scarcely found anywhere else in the world, we have a common Holy Land
which is identified with our common Fatherland. This Bharat Bhumi,
this Hindustan, India is both our <em>pitribhu</em> and <em>punyabhu</em>. Our
patriotism therefore is doubly sure. Then, we have common affinities,
cultural, religious, historical, linguistic, and racial which through
the process of countless centuries of association and assimilation
moulded us into a homogeneous and organic nation and above all induced
a will to lead a corporate and common national life. The Hindus are no
treaty Nation—but an organic National Being.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One more pertinent point must be met as it often misleads our
Congressite Hindu brethren in particular. The homogeneity that wields
a people into a National Being does not only imply the total absence
of all internal differences, religious, racial or linguistic, of sects
and sections amongst themselves. It only means that they differ more
from other people as a national unit than they differ amongst
themselves. Even the most unitarian nations of today—say the British
or the French— cannot be free from any religious, linguistic,
cultural, racial or other differences, sects or sections or even some
antipathies existing amongst themselves. National homogeneity connotes
oneness of a people in relation to the contrast they present to any
other people as a whole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We Hindus, in spite of thousand and one differences within our fold,
are bound by such religious, cultural, historical, racial, linguistic
and other affinities in common as to stand out as a definitely
homogeneous people as soon as we are placed in contrast with any other
non-Hindu people—say the English or Japanese or even the Indian
Moslems. That is the reason why today we the Hindus from Cashmere to
Madras and Sindh to Assam will have to be a Nation by ourselves. . .
.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>The second proposition on which Mr. Savarkar has built up his scheme
relates to the definition of the term Hindu. According to Mr. Savarkar a
Hindu is a person:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;. . . .who regards and owns this Bharat Bhumi, this land from the
Indus to the Seas, as his Fatherland as well as his Holy Land;—i.e.,
the land of the origin of his religion, the cradle of his faith.</p>
<p>The followers therefore of Vaidicism, Sanatanism, Jainism, Buddhism,
Lingaitism, Sikhism, the Arya Samaj, the Brahmosamaj, the Devasamaj,
the Prarthana Samaj and such other religions of Indian origin are
Hindus and constitute Hindudom, i.e., Hindu people as a whole.</p>
<p>Consequently the so-called aboriginal or hill-tribes also are Hindus:
because India is their Fatherland as well as their Holy Land whatever
form of religion or worship they follow. The definition rendered in
Sanskrit stands thus:</p>
<p><em>asindhu sindha panyanta yasma bharata bhumika</em><br>
<em>pitribhuh punyabhushraiva sa vai hinduritismritah</em></p>
<p>This definition , therefore, should be recognized by the Government
and made the test of &lsquo;Hindutva&rsquo; in enumerating the population of
Hindus in the Government census to come.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>This definition of the term Hindu has been framed with great care
and caution. It is designed to serve two purposes which Mr. Savarkar has
in view. First, to exclude from it Muslims, Christians, Parsis and Jews
by prescribing the recognition of India as a Holy Land as a
qualification for being a Hindu. Secondly, to include Buddhists, Jains,
Sikhs, etc., by not insisting upon belief in the sanctity of the Vedas
as an element in the qualifications.</p>
<p>Such is the scheme of Mr. Savarkar and the Hindu Maha Sabha. As must
have been noticed, the scheme has some disturbing features.</p>
<p>One is the categorical assertion that the Hindus are a nation by
themselves. This, of course, means that the Muslims are a separate
nation by themselves. That this is his view, Mr. Savarkar does not leave
to be inferred. He insists upon it in no uncertain terms and with the
most absolute emphasis he is capable of. Speaking at the Hindu Maha
Sabha Session held at Ahmedabad in 1937, Mr. Savarkar said :—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Several infantile politicians commit the serious mistake in supposing
that India is already welded into a harmonious nation, or that it
could be welded thus for the mere wish to do so. These our
well-meaning but unthinking friends take their dreams for realities.
That is why they are impatient of communal tangles and attribute them
to communal organizations. But the solid fact is that the so-called
communal questions are but a legacy handed down to us by centuries of
a cultural, religious and national antagonism between the Hindus and
the Muslims. When the time is ripe you can solve them; but you cannot
suppress them by merely refusing recognition of them. It is safer to
diagnose and treat deep-seated disease than to ignore it. Let us
bravely face unpleasant facts as they are. India cannot be assumed
today to be a unitarian and homogeneous nation, but on the contrary
these are two nations in the main, the Hindus and the Muslims in
India.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Strange as it may appear, Mr. Savarkar and Mr. Jinnah, instead of
being opposed to each other on the one nation versus two nations issue,
are in complete agreement about it. Both agree, not only agree but
insist, that there are two nations in India—one the Muslim nation and
the other the Hindu nation. They differ only as regards the terms and
conditions on which the two nations should live. Mr. Jinnah says India
should be cut up into two, Pakistan and Hindustan, the Muslim nation to
occupy Pakistan and the Hindu nation to occupy Hindustan. Mr. Savarkar
on the other hand insists that, although there are two nations in India,
India shall not be divided into two parts, one for Muslims and the other
for the Hindus; that the two nations shall dwell in one country and
shall live under the mantle of one single constitution; that the
constitution shall be such that the Hindu nation will be enabled to
occupy a predominant position that is due to it and the Muslim nation
made to live in the position of subordinate co-operation with the Hindu
nation. In the struggle for political power between, the two nations the
rule of the game which Mr. Savarkar prescribes is to be one man one
vote, be the man Hindu or Muslim. In his scheme a Muslim is to have no
advantage which a Hindu does not have. Minority is to be no
justification for privilege and majority is to be no ground for penalty.
The State will guarantee the Muslims any defined measure of political
power in the form of Muslim religion and Muslim culture. But the State
will not guarantee secured seats in the Legislature or in the
Administration and, if such guarantee is insisted upon by the
Muslims,<strong><a href="#n16">/16/</a></strong> such guaranteed quota is not to exceed their
proportion to the general population. Thus by confiscating its
weightages, Mr. Savarkar would even strip the Muslim nation of all the
political privileges it has secured so far.</p>
<p>This alternative of Mr. Savarkar to Pakistan has about it a
frankness, boldness and definiteness which distinguishes it from the
irregularity, vagueness and indefiniteness which characterizes the
Congress declarations about minority rights. Mr. Savarkar&rsquo;s scheme has
at least the merit of telling the Muslims, thus far and no further. The
Muslims know where they are with regard to the Hindu Maha Sabha. On the
other hand, with the Congress the Musalmans find themselves nowhere
because the Congress has been treating the Muslims and the minority
question as a game in diplomacy, if not in duplicity.</p>
<p>At the same time, it must be said that Mr. Savarkar&rsquo;s attitude is
illogical, if not queer. Mr. Savarkar admits that the Muslims are a
separate nation. He concedes that they have a right to cultural
autonomy. He allows them to have a national flag. Yet he opposes the
demand of the Muslim nation for a separate national home. If he claims a
national home for the Hindu nation, how can he refuse the claim of the
Muslim nation for a national home?</p>
<p>It would not have been a matter of much concern if inconsistency was
the only fault of Mr. Savarkar. But Mr. Savarkar in advocating his
scheme is really creating a most dangerous situation for the safety and
security of India. History records two ways as being open to a major
nation to deal with a minor nation when they are citizens of the same
country and are subject to the same constitution. One way is to destroy
the nationality of the minor nation and to assimilate and absorb it into
the major nation, so as to make one nation out of two. This is done by
denying to the minor nation any right to language, religion or culture
and by seeking to enforce upon it the language, religion and culture of
the major nation. The other way is to divide the country and to allow
the minor nation a separate, autonomous and sovereign existence,
independent of the major nation. Both these ways were tried in Austria
and Turkey, the second after the failure of the first.</p>
<p>Mr. Savarkar adopts neither of these two ways. He does not propose
to suppress the Muslim nation. On the contrary he is nursing and feeding
it by allowing it to retain its religion, language and culture, elements
which go to sustain the soul of a nation. At the same time he does not
consent to divide the country so as to allow the two nations to become
separate, autonomous states, each sovereign in its own territory. He
wants the Hindus and the Muslims to live as two separate nations in one
country, each maintaining its own religion, language and culture. One
can understand and even appreciate the wisdom of the theory of
suppression of the minor nation by the major nation because the ultimate
aim is to bring into being one nation. But one cannot follow what
advantage a theory has which says that there must ever be two nations
but that there shall be no divorce between them. One can justify this
attitude only if the two nations were to live as partners in friendly
intercourse with mutual respect and accord. But that is not to be,
because Mr. Savarkar will not allow the Muslim nation to be co-equal in
authority with the Hindu nation. He wants the Hindu nation to be the
dominant nation and the Muslim nation to be the servient nation. Why Mr.
Savarkar, after sowing this seed of enmity between the Hindu nation and
the Muslim nation, should want that they should live under one
constitution and occupy one country, is difficult to explain.</p>
<p>One cannot give Mr. Savarkar credit for having found a new formula.
What is difficult to understand is that he should believe that his
formula is the right formula. Mr. Savarkar has taken old Austria and old
Turkey as his model and pattern for his scheme of Swaraj. He sees that
in Austria and Turkey there lived one major nation juxtaposed to other
minor nations bound by one constitution with the major nation dominating
the minor nations, and argues that if this was possible in Austria and
Turkey, why should it not be possible for the Hindus to do the same in
India.</p>
<p>That Mr. Savarkar should have taken old Austria and old Turkey as
his model to build upon is really very strange. Mr. Savarkar does not
seem to be aware of the fact that old Austria and old Turkey are no
more. Much less does he seem to know the forces which have blown up old
Austria and old Turkey to bits. If Mr. Savarkar instead of studying the
past—of which he is very fond—were to devote more attention to the
present, he would have learnt that old Austria and old Turkey came to
ruination for insisting upon maintaining the very scheme of things which
Mr. Savarkar has been advising his &ldquo;Hindudom&rdquo; to adopt, namely, to
establish a Swaraj in which there will be two nations under the mantle
of one single constitution in which the major nation will be allowed to
hold the minor nation in subordination to itself.</p>
<p>The history of the disruption of Austria, Czechoslovakia and Turkey
is of the utmost importance to India and the members of the Hindu Maha
Sabha will do well to peruse the same. I need say nothing here about it
because I have drawn attention to lessons from their fateful history in
another chapter. Suffice it to say that the scheme of Swaraj formulated
by Mr. Savarkar will give the Hindus an empire over the Muslims and
thereby satisfy their vanity and their pride in being an imperial race.
But it can never ensure a stable and peaceful future for the Hindus, for
the simple reason that the Muslims will never yield willing obedience to
so dreadful an alternative.</p>
