      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://kanchangupta.blogspot.com/2008/12/truth-behind-kandahar.html?m=1&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;विस्तारः (द्रष्टुं नोद्यम्)&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was in the Prime Minister’s Office as OSD to PM AB Vajpayee and member of the National Security Advisory Board (working closely with NSA Brajesh Mishra) when the hijacking of IC814 happened. I had a front row view of the events linked to the hijacking and its resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is what happened. Anything else is fiction. Certain details that impact national security have not been mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Around 50 years ago  in 1971, the USA threatened India to stop the 1971 war. An alarmed India sent a SOS to the Soviet Union. A story that has been nearly erased from Indian history books.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When Pakistan&amp;rsquo;s defeat in the 1971 war seemed imminent, Kissinger spurred Nixon to send the US 7th Fleet’s Task Force, led by the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Enterprise, to the Bay of Bengal. The USS Enterprise, at 75,000 ton, was the world&amp;rsquo;s largest nuclear-powered aircraft carrier in the 1970s with more than 70 fighter aircraft. A monster. The Indian Navy’s fleet was led by the 20,000-ton aircraft carrier, Vikrant, with 20 light fighter aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
