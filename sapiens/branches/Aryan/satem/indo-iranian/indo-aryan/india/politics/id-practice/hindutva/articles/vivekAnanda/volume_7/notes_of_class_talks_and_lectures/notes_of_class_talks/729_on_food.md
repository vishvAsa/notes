## ON FOOD

You preach to others to be men but cannot give them good food. I have
been thinking over this problem for the last four years. I wish to make
an experiment whether something of the nature of flattened rice can be
made out of wheat. Then we can get a different food every day. About
drinking water, I searched for a filter which would suit our country. I
found one pan-like porcelain vessel through which water was made to
pass, and all the bacilli remained in the porcelain pan. But gradually
that filter would itself become the hotbed of all germs. This is the
danger of all filters. After continued searching I found one method by
which water was distilled and then oxygen was passed into it. After this
the water became so pure that great improvement of health was sure to
result from its use.
