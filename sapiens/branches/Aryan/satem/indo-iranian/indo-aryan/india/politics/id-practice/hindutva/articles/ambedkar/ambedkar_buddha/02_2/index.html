§ 1. Arrival at Sarnath
Having decided to preach his doctrine, the Buddha asked himself “To whom shall I first teach the doctrine?” The thought [came to him] of Alara Kalam, whom the Buddha adored as the learned, wise, intelligent, and of little impurity; “What if I first teach him the doctrine?” But he was told that Alara Kalam was dead. Then thought he of preaching it to Uddaka Ramputta. But he too was dead. Then he thought of the five old companions of his who were with him at Niranjana when he was practising austerities, and who had left him in anger on his abandonment of austerities. “They did much for me, attended me and looked after me; what if I first teach the doctrine to them?” said he to himself. He asked for their whereabouts. Having learnt that they were dwelling at Sarnath, in the deer park of Isipatana, he left in search of them. The five, seeing him coming, decided among themselves not to welcome him. Said one of them, “This, friends, is the ascetic Gautama coming, who has abandoned austerities and has turned to [a] life of abundance and luxury. He has committed a sin. We must not therefore greet him, nor rise in respect, nor take his bowl and robe. We will only set apart a seat for him. If he wishes, he may sit down.” And they all agreed. But when the Buddha approached, the five Parivrajakas were not able to abide by their decision; so greatly impressed were they by his personality that they all rose in their seats. One took his bowl, one took his robe, and one prepared a seat, and one brought water to wash his feet. It was really a great welcome to an unwelcome guest. Thus those who intended to scoff remained to pray. § 2. The Buddha’s First Sermon">

Parivrajakas</a>*</p>
<p>§ 1. Arrival at Sarnath</p>
<ol>
<li>Having decided to preach his doctrine, the Buddha asked himself
&ldquo;To whom shall I first teach the doctrine?&rdquo; The thought [came to
him] of Alara Kalam, whom the Buddha adored as the learned, wise,
intelligent, and of little impurity; &ldquo;What if I first teach him the
doctrine?&rdquo; But he was told that Alara Kalam was dead.</li>
<li>Then thought he of preaching it to Uddaka Ramputta. But he too
was dead.</li>
<li>Then he thought of the five old companions of his who were with
him at Niranjana when he was practising austerities, and who had left
him in anger on his abandonment of austerities.</li>
<li>&ldquo;They did much for me, attended me and looked after me; what if
I first teach the doctrine to them?&rdquo; said he to himself.</li>
<li>He asked for their whereabouts. Having learnt that they were
dwelling at Sarnath, in the deer park of Isipatana, he left in search
of them.</li>
<li>The five, seeing him coming, decided among themselves not to
welcome him. Said one of them, &ldquo;This, friends, is the ascetic Gautama
coming, who has abandoned austerities and has turned to [a] life of
abundance and luxury. He has committed a sin. We must not therefore
greet him, nor rise in respect, nor take his bowl and robe. We will
only set apart a seat for him. If he wishes, he may sit down.&rdquo; And
they all agreed.</li>
<li>But when the Buddha approached, the five Parivrajakas were not
able to abide by their decision; so greatly impressed were they by his
personality that they all rose in their seats. One took his bowl, one
took his robe, and one prepared a seat, and one brought water to wash
his feet.</li>
<li>It was really a great welcome to an unwelcome guest.</li>
<li>Thus those who intended to scoff remained to pray.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 2. The Buddha&rsquo;s First Sermon</p>
<ol>
<li>After [the] exchange of greetings, the five Parivrajakas
asked the Buddha whether he still believed in asceticism. The Buddha
replied in the negative.</li>
<li>He said there were two extremes, a life of pleasure and a life
of self-mortification.</li>
<li>One says let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die. The other
says, kill all <em>vasanas</em> (desires) because they bring rebirth. He
rejected both as unbecoming to man.</li>
<li>He was a believer in the Madhyama Marga (Majjhima Patipada),
the middle path, which is neither the path of pleasure nor the path of
self-mortification.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Answer me this,&rdquo; he said to the Parivrajakas. &ldquo;So long as your
self remains active and continues to lust after either worldly or
heavenly pleasures, is not all mortification vain?&rdquo; And they answered,
&ldquo;It is as thou sayest.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;How can ye be free from self by leading a wretched life of
self-mortification, if ye do not thereby succeed in quenching the
fires of lust?&rdquo; And they replied, &ldquo;It is as thou sayest.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Only when the self in ye has been conquered [so] that ye
are free from lust; ye will then not desire worldly pleasures, and the
satisfaction of your natural wants will not defile ye. Let ye eat and
drink according to the needs of your body.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Sensuality of all kinds is enervating. The sensual man is a
slave of his passion. All pleasure-seeking is degrading and vulgar.
But I say unto you that to satisfy the needs of life is not an evil:
to keep the body in good health is a duty, or otherwise you shall not
be able to keep your mind strong and clear and have the lamp of wisdom
burning.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Know ye, O Parivrajakas, that there are these two extremes
which man ought not to follow&ndash;the habitual indulgence on the one
hand, of those things whose attraction depends upon the passions, and
especially of sensuality&ndash;a low and pagan way of seeking satisfaction,
unworthy, unprofitable, and the habitual practice thereof; and on the
other hand, of asceticism or self-mortification, which is painful,
unworthy, and unprofitable.</li>
<li>&ldquo;There is a middle path which avoids both these extremes. Know
ye, that, this is the path which I preach.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The five Parivrajakas listened to him with attention. Not
knowing what to say in reply to the Buddha&rsquo;s middle path, they asked
him what he was [=had been] doing after they had left him. Then the
Buddha told them how he left for Gaya, how he sat in contemplation
under the Banyan Tree, and how after four weeks of contemplation he
obtained enlightenment, as a result of which he was able to discover a
new path of life.</li>
<li>On hearing this, the Parivrajakas became extremely impatient
to know what the path was, and requested the Buddha to expound it to
them.</li>
<li>The Buddha agreed.</li>
<li>He began by saying that his path which is his Dhamma
(religion) had nothing to do with God and [the] Soul. His Dhamma had
nothing to do with life after death. Nor has his Dhamma any concern
with rituals and ceremonies.</li>
<li>The centre of his Dhamma is man, and the relation of man to
man in his life on earth.</li>
<li>This, he said, was his first postulate.</li>
<li>His second postulate was that men are living in sorrow, in
misery and poverty. The world is full of suffering and that
[discovering] how to remove this suffering from the world is the
only purpose of Dhamma. Nothing else is Dhamma.</li>
<li>The recognition of the existence of suffering, and to show the
way to remove suffering, is the foundation and basis of his Dhamma.</li>
<li>This can be the only foundation and justification for Dhamma.
A religion which fails to recognise this is no religion at all.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Verily, Parivrajakas! whatsoever recluses or Brahmins (i.e.,
preachers of religion) understand not, as it really is, that the
misery in the world and the escape therefrom, is the main problem of
Dhamma&ndash;such recluses and Brahmins in my opinion are not to be
regarded as recluses and Brahmin ; nor have those worthies come to
know fully of themselves what in this very life is the real
meaning of Dhamma.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The Parivrajakas then asked him, &ldquo;If the foundation of your
Dhamma is the recognition of the existence of suffering and the
removal of suffering, tell us, how does your Dhamma remove
suffering!&rdquo;</li>
<li>The Buddha then told them that according to his Dhamma if
every person followed (1) the Path of Purity; (2) the Path of
Righteousness; and (3) the Path of Virtue, it would bring about the
end of all suffering.</li>
<li>And he added that he had discovered such a Dhamma.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 3. The Buddha&rsquo;s First Sermon—(contd.) The Path of Purity</p>
<ol>
<li>The Parivrajakas then asked the Buddha to explain to them his
Dhamma.</li>
<li>And the Buddha was pleased to do so.</li>
<li>He addressed them first on the Path of Purity.</li>
<li>&ldquo;The Path of Purity,&rdquo; he told the Parivrajakas, &ldquo;teaches that a
person who wishes to be good must recognise some principles as
principles of life.</li>
<li>&ldquo;According to my Path of Purity, the principles of life
recognised by it are: Not to injure or kill; Not to steal or
appropriate to oneself anything which belongs to another; Not to speak
untruth; Not to indulge in lust; Not to indulge in intoxicating
drinks.</li>
<li>&ldquo;The recognition of these principles, I say, is most essential
for every man. For every man must have a standard by which to judge
whatever he does. And these principles, according to my teachings,
constitute the standard.</li>
<li>&ldquo;There are everywhere people who are <em>patit</em> (fallen). But
there are two classes of the <em>patit</em>: the <em>patit</em> who has a standard,
and a <em>patit</em> who has no standard.</li>
<li>&ldquo;The <em>patit</em> who has no standard does not know that he has
fallen. Consequently he always remains fallen. On the other hand, a
<em>patit</em> who has a standard tries to rise from his fallen state. Why?
The answer is, because he knows that he has fallen.</li>
<li>&ldquo;This is the difference between having a standard, and having
no standard, for regulating a man&rsquo;s life. What matters is not so much
the fall of the man, but the absence of any standard.</li>
<li>&ldquo;You may ask, ye Parivrajakas! Why are these principles worthy
of recognition as a standard of life?</li>
<li>&ldquo;The answer to this question you will find for yourselves, if
you ask: &ldquo;Are these principles good for the individual?&rdquo; also if you
ask: &ldquo;Do they promote social good?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;If your answers to these questions are in the affirmative,
then it follows that the principles of my Path of Purity are worthy of
recognition as forming a true standard of life.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 4. The Buddha&rsquo;s First Sermon (cont&rsquo;d)—Ashtanga Marga or the Path of
Righteousness</p>
<ol>
<li>The Buddha next addressed the Parivrajakas on the
Ashtangamarga. He said that there are eight constituents in the
Ashtangamarga.</li>
<li>He began his discourse with the exposition of Samma Ditti
(Right Views), the first and foremost element in the Ashtangmarga,</li>
<li>&ldquo;To realise the importance of Samma Ditti,&rdquo; the Buddha said to
the Parivrajakas:</li>
<li>&ldquo;O, ye Parivrajakas, you must realise that the world is a
dungeon, and man is a prisoner in the dungeon.</li>
<li>&ldquo;This dungeon is full of darkness. So dark is it that scarce
anything at all can rightly be seen by the prisoner. The prisoner
cannot see that he is a prisoner.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Indeed, man has not only become blind by living too long in
the darkness, but he very much doubts if any such strange thing as
light is said to be, can ever exist at all.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Mind is the only instrument through which light can come to
man.</li>
<li>&ldquo;But the mind of these dungeon-dwellers is by no means a
perfect instrument for the purpose.</li>
<li>&ldquo;It lets through only a little light, just enough to show to
those with sight that there is such a thing as darkness.</li>
<li>Thus defective in its nature, such understanding as this
is.</li>
<li>&ldquo;But know ye, Parivrajakas! the case of the prisoner is not as
hopeless as it appears.</li>
<li>&ldquo;For there is in man a thing called will. When the appropriate
motives arise, the will can be awakened and set in motion.</li>
<li>&ldquo;With the coming of just enough light to see in what
directions to guide the motions of the will, man may so guide them
that they shall lead to liberty.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Thus though man is bound, yet he may be free; he may at any
moment begin to take the first steps that will ultimately bring him to
freedom.</li>
<li>&ldquo;This is because it is possible to train the mind in whatever
directions one chooses. It is mind that makes us to be prisoners in
the house of life, and it is mind that keeps us so.</li>
<li>&ldquo;But what mind has done, that mind can undo. If it has brought
man to thraldom, it can also, when rightly directed, bring him to
liberty.</li>
<li>&ldquo;This is what <em>Samma Ditti</em> can do.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;What is the end of <em>Samma Ditti</em>?&rdquo; asked the Parivrajakas.
&ldquo;The end of <em>Samma Ditti</em>,&rdquo; replied the Buddha, &ldquo;is the destruction of
Avijja (Nescience). It is opposed to Miccha Ditti.</li>
<li>&ldquo;And Avijja means the failure to understand the noble truths,
of the existence of suffering and the removal of suffering.</li>
<li>&ldquo;<em>Samma Ditti</em> requires [the] giving up of belief in the
efficacy of rites and ceremonies, to have disbelief in the sanctity of
the <strong>Shastra</strong>s.</li>
<li>&ldquo;<em>Samma Ditti</em> requires the abandonment of superstition and
supernaturalism.</li>
<li>&ldquo;<em>Samma Ditti</em> requires the abandonment of all doctrines which
are mere speculations without any basis in fact or experience.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Samma Ditti requires [a] free mind and free thought.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Every man has aims, aspirations, and ambitions. <em>Samma
Sankappo</em> teaches that such aims, aspirations, and ambitions shall be
noble and praiseworthy and not ignoble and unworthy.</li>
<li>&ldquo;<em>Samma Vacca</em> (Right Speech) teaches:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) that one should speak only that which is true;<br>
(2) that one should not speak what is false;<br>
(3) that one should not speak evil of others;<br>
(4) that one should refrain from slander;<br>
(5) that one should not use angry and abusive language towards any
fellow man;<br>
(6) that one should speak kindly and courteously to all;<br>
(7) that one should not indulge in pointless, foolish talk, but let
his speech be sensible and to the purpose.</p></blockquote>
<ol start="26">
<li>&ldquo;The observance of Right Speech, as I have explained, is not
to be the result of fear or favour. It is not to have the slightest
reference to what any superior being may think of his action, or to
any loss which Right Speech may involve.</li>
<li>&ldquo;The norm for Right Speech is not the order of the superior or
the personal benefit to the individual.</li>
<li>&ldquo;<em>Samma Kamanto</em> teaches right behaviour. It teaches that
every action should be founded on respect for the feelings and rights
of others.</li>
<li>&ldquo;What is the norm for <em>Samma Kamanto</em>? The norm is that course
of conduct which is most in harmony with the fundamental laws of
existence.</li>
<li>&ldquo;When his [=one&rsquo;s] actions are in harmony with these laws,
they may be taken to be in accord with <em>Samma Kamanto</em>.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Every individual has to earn his livelihood. But there are
ways and ways of earning one&rsquo;s livelihood. Some are bad; some are
good. Bad ways are those which cause injury or injustice to others.
Good ways are those by which the individual earns his livelihood
without causing injury or injustice to others. This is <em>Samma
Ajivo</em>.</li>
<li>&ldquo;<em>Samma Vyayamo</em> (Right Endeavour) is primary endeavour to
remove Avijja; to reach the door that leads out of this painful prison
house, to swing it open.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Right endeavour has four purposes.</li>
<li>&ldquo;One is to prevent states of mind which are in conflict with
the Ashtangamarga.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Second is to suppress such states of mind which may already
have arisen.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Third is to bring into existence states of mind which will
help a man to fulfil the requirements of the Ashtangamarga.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Fourth is to promote the further growth and increase of such
states of mind as already may have arisen.</li>
<li>&ldquo;<em>Samma Satti</em> calls for mindfulness and thoughtfulness. It
means constant wakefulness of the mind. Watch and ward by the mind
over the evil passions is another name for <em>Samma Satti</em>.</li>
<li>&ldquo;There are, ye Parivrajakas, five fetters or hindrances which
come in the way of a person trying to achieve <em>Samma Ditti</em>, <em>Samma
Sankappo</em>, <em>Samma Vacca</em>, <em>Samma Kamanto</em>, <em>Samma Ajeevo</em>, <em>Samma
Vyayamo</em> and <em>Samma Satti</em>.</li>
<li>&ldquo;These five hindrances are covetousness, ill-will, sloth and
torpor, doubt, and indecision. It is, therefore, necessary to overcome
these hindrances, which are really fetters, and the means to overcome
them is through <em>Samadhi</em>. But know ye, Parivrajakas, <em>Samma Samadhi</em>
is not the same as <em>Samadhi</em>. It is quite different.</li>
<li>&ldquo;<em>Samadhi</em> is mere concentration. No doubt it leads to Dhyanic
states which are self-induced, holding the five hindrances in
suspense.</li>
<li>&ldquo;But these Dhyana states are temporary. Consequently the
suspension of the hindrances is also temporary. What is necessary is a
permanent turn to the mind. Such a permanent turn can be achieved only
by <em>Samma Samadhi</em>.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Mere <em>Samadhi</em> is negative, inasmuch as it leads to temporary
suspension of the hindrances. In it there is no training to the mind.
<em>Samma Samadhi</em> is positive. It trains the mind to concentrate and to
think of some <em>Kusala Kamma</em> (Good Deeds and Thoughts) during
concentration, and thereby eliminate the tendency of the mind to be
drawn towards <em>Akusala Kamma</em> (Bad Deeds and Bad Thoughts) arising
from the hindrances.</li>
<li>&ldquo;<em>Samma Samadhi</em> gives a habit to the mind to think of good,
and always to think of good. <em>Samma Samadhi</em> gives the mind the
necessary motive power to do good.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 5. The Buddha&rsquo;s First Sermon (cont&rsquo;d)—The Path of Virtue</p>
<ol>
<li>The Buddha then explained to the Parivrajakas the Path of
Virtue.</li>
<li>He told them that the path of virtue meant the observance of
the virtues called: (1) <em>Sila</em>; (2) <em>Dana</em>; (3) <em>Uppekha</em>; (4)
<em>Nekkhama</em>; (5) <em>Virya</em>; (6) <em>Khanti</em>; (7) <em>Succa</em>; (8) <em>Adhithana</em>;
(9) <em>Karuna</em>; and (10) <em>Maitri</em>.</li>
<li>The Parivrajakas asked the Buddha to tell them what these
virtues meant.</li>
<li>The Buddha then proceeded to satisfy their desire.</li>
<li>&ldquo;<em>Sila</em> is moral temperament, the disposition not to do evil
and the disposition to do good; to be ashamed of doing wrong. To avoid
to do [=doing] evil for fear of punishment is <em>Sila</em>. <em>Sila</em> means
fear of doing wrong.</li>
<li>&ldquo;<em>Nekkhama</em> is renunciation of the pleasures of the world.</li>
<li>&ldquo;<em>Dana</em> means the giving of one&rsquo;s possessions, blood and limbs,
and even one&rsquo;s life, for the good of others, without expecting
anything in return.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Virya is right endeavour. It is doing with all your might
whatever you have undertaken to do, with never a thought of turning
back, whatever you have undertaken to do.</li>
<li>&ldquo;<em>Khanti</em> is forbearance. Not to meet hatred by hatred is the
essence of it. For hatred is not appeased by hatred. It is appeased
only by forbearance.</li>
<li>&ldquo;<em>Succa</em> is truth. A person must never tell a lie. His speech
must be truth and nothing but truth.</li>
<li>&ldquo;<em>Adhithana</em> is resolute determination to reach the goal.</li>
<li>&ldquo;<em>Karuna</em> is loving kindness to human beings.</li>
<li>&ldquo;<em>Maitri</em> is extending fellow feeling to all beings, not only
to one who is a friend, but also to one who is a foe; not only to man,
but to all living beings.</li>
<li>&ldquo;<em>Upekka</em> is detachment as distinguished from indifference. It
is a state of mind where there is neither like nor dislike. Remaining
unmoved by the result, and yet engaged in the pursuit of it.</li>
<li>&ldquo;These virtues one must practice to his utmost capacity. That
is why they are called Paramitas (States of Perfection).</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 6. The Buddha&rsquo;s First Sermon (concluded)</p>
<ol>
<li>Having explained His Dhamma and what it involved, the Buddha
then asked the Parivrajakas:</li>
<li>&ldquo;Is not personal purity the foundation of good in the world?&rdquo;
And they answered, &ldquo;It is as thou sayest.&rdquo;</li>
<li>And he continued, &ldquo;Is not personal purity undermined by
covetousness, passion, ignorance, the destruction of life, theft,
adultery, and lying? Is it not necessary for personal purity to build
up sufficient strength of character so that these evils should be kept
under control? How can a man be the instrument of good if he has no
personal purity in him?&rdquo; And they replied, &ldquo;It is as thou sayest.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Again, why do men not mind enslaving or dominating others? Why
do men not mind making the lives of others unhappy? Is it not because
men are not righteous in their conduct towards one another?&rdquo; And they
answered in the affirmative.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Will not the practice of the Ashtanga Marga, the path of right
views, right aims, right speech, right livelihood, right means, right
mindfulness, right perseverance, and right contemplation, in short,
the Path of Righteousness, if followed by every one, remove all
injustice and inhumanity that man does to man?&rdquo; And they said,
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Turning to the path of virtue, he asked, &ldquo;Is not Dana necessary
to remove the suffering of the needy and the poor, and to promote
general good? Is not Karuna necessary, to be drawn to the relief of
poverty and suffering wherever it exists? Is not Nekkamma necessary to
selfless work? Is not Uppekka necessary, for sustained endeavour even
though there is no personal gain?</li>
<li>&ldquo;Is not love for man necessary?&rdquo; And they said &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;I go further and say, &ldquo;Love is not enough; what is required is
Maitri. It is wider than love. It means fellowship not merely with
human beings but with all living beings. It is not confined to human
beings. Is not such Maitri necessary? What else can give to all living
beings the same happiness which one seeks for one&rsquo;s own self, to keep
the mind impartial, open to all, with affection for every one and
hatred for none?&rdquo;</li>
<li>They all said &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The practice of these virtues must, however, be accompanied
by Prajna, i.e., intelligence.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Is not Prajna necessary?&rdquo; The Parivrajakas gave no answer. To
force them to answer his question, the Buddha went on to say that the
qualities of a good man are: &ldquo;do no evil, think nothing that is evil,
get his livelihood in no evil way, and say nothing. that is evil or is
likely to hurt anyone.&rdquo; And they said, &ldquo;Yes, so it is.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;But is doing good deeds blindly to be welcomed?&rdquo; asked the
Buddha &ldquo;I say, &rsquo;no&rsquo;. This is not enough,&rdquo; said the Buddha to the
Parivrajakas. &ldquo;If it was enough,&rdquo; said the Buddha to the Parivrajakas,
&ldquo;then a tiny babe could be proclaimed to be always doing good. For as
yet the babe does not know what a body means, much less will it do
evil with its body beyond kicking about; it does not know what speech
is, much less will it say anything evil beyond crying; it does not
know what thought is, beyond crying with delight; it does not know
what livelihood is, much less will it get its living in an evil way,
beyond sucking its mother.</li>
<li>&ldquo;The Path of Virtue must, therefore, be subject to [the]
test of Prajna, which is another name for understanding and
intelligence.</li>
<li>&ldquo;There is also another reason why Prajna-paramita is so
important and so necessary. There must be Dana. But without Prajna,
Dana may have a demoralizing effect. There must be Karuna. But without
Prajna, Karuna may end in supporting evil. Every act of Paramita must
be tested by Prajna Paramita, which is another name for wisdom.</li>
<li>&ldquo;I premise that there must be knowledge and consciousness of
what wrong conduct is, how it arises; similarly, there must also be
knowledge and consciousness of what is right conduct and wrong
conduct. Without such knowledge there cannot be real goodness, though
the act may be good. That is why I say Prajna is a necessary
virtue.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The Buddha then concluded his sermon by addressing the
following admonition to the Parivrajakas.</li>
<li>&ldquo;You are likely to call my Dhamma pessimistic, because it
calls the attention of mankind to the existence of suffering. I tell
you such a view of my Dhamma would be wrong.</li>
<li>&ldquo;No doubt my Dhamma recognises the existence of suffering, but
forget not that it also lays equal stress on the removal of
suffering.</li>
<li>&ldquo;My Dhamma has in it both hope and purpose.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Its purpose is to remove Avijja, by which I mean ignorance of
the existence of suffering.</li>
<li>&ldquo;There is hope in it because it shows the way to put an end to
human suffering.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Do you agree with this or not?&rdquo; And the Parivrajakas said ,
&ldquo;Yes, we do.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 7. The Response of the Parivrajakas</p>
<ol>
<li>The five Parivrajakas at once realised that this was really a
new Dhamma. They were so struck by this new approach to the problems
of life that they were unanimous in saying, &ldquo;Never in the history of
the world has any founder of religion taught that the recognition of
human suffering was the real basis of religion.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Never in the history of the world has any founder of religion
taught that the removal of this misery is the real purpose of it!</li>
<li>&ldquo;Never in the history of the world had a scheme of salvation
been put forth, so simple in its nature; so free from supernatural and
superhuman agency; so independent of, even so antagonistic to, the
belief in a soul, to the belief in God and to the belief in life after
death!</li>
<li>&ldquo;Never in the history of the world had a scheme of religion
been put forth which had nothing to do with revelation, and whose
commands are born of the examination of the social needs of man and
which are not the orders of a God !</li>
<li>&ldquo;Never in the history of the world has salvation been conceived
as the blessing of happiness to be attained by man in this life and on
this earth, by righteousness born out of his own efforts!&rdquo;</li>
<li>These were the sentiments which the Parivrajakas uttered after
they had heard the Buddha&rsquo;s Sermon on his new Dhamma.</li>
<li>They felt that in him they had found a reformer, full of the
most earnest moral purpose and trained in all the intellectual culture
of his time, who had the originality and the courage to put forth
deliberately and with a knowledge of opposing views, the doctrine of a
salvation to be found here, in this life, in inward change of heart to
be brought about by the practice of self-culture and self-control.</li>
<li>Their reverence for him became so unbounded that they at once
surrendered to him and requested him to accept them as his
disciples.</li>
<li>The Buddha admitted them into his order by uttering the formula
&ldquo;Ehi Bhikkave&rdquo; (come in Bhikkus). They were known as the Panchavargiya
Bhikkus.</li>
