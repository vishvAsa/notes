> § 1. What others have understood Him to have Taught
>
>  1. "What are the teachings of the Buddha?"  
>  2. This is a question on which no two followers of the Buddha or
> the students of Buddhism agree.  
>  3. To some Samadhi is his principal teaching.  
>  4. To some it is Vippassana (a kind of Pranayam).  
>  5. To some Buddhism is esoteric. To others it is exoteric.  
>  6. To some it is a system of barren metaphysics.  
>  7. To some it is sheer mysticism.  
>  8. To some it is a selfish abstraction from the world.  
>  9. To some it is a systematic repression of every impulse and
> emotion of the heart.  
>  10. Many other views regarding Buddhism could be collected.  
>  11. This divergence of views is astonishing.  
>  12. Some of these views are those of men who have a fancy for
> certain things. Such are those who regard thai the essence of Buddhism
> lies in Samadhi or Vippassana, or Esoterism.  
>  13. The other views are the results of the fact that the majority
> of the writers on Buddhism are students of ancient Indian history.
> Their study of Buddhism is incidental and occasional.  
>  14. Some of them are not students of Buddhism.  
>  15. They are not even students of anthropology, the subject matter
> which deals with the origin and growth of religion.  
>  16. The question that arises is--"Did the Buddha have no Social
> Message?"  
>  17. When pressed for an answer, students of Buddhism refer to the
> two points. They say--  
>  18. "The Buddha taught Ahimsa."  
>  19. "The Buddha taught peace!"  
>  20. Asked, "Did the Buddha give any other Social Message?"  
>  21. "Did the Buddha teach justice?"  
>  22. "Did the Buddha teach love?"  
>  23. "Did the Buddha teach liberty?"  
>  24. "Did the Buddha teach equality?"  
>  25. "Did the Buddha teach fraternity?"  
>  26. "Could the Buddha answer Karl Marx?"  
>  27. These questions are hardly ever raised in discussing the
> Buddha's Dhamma.  
>  28. My answer is that the Buddha has a Social Message. He answers
> all these questions. But they have been buried by modern authors.
>
>   
> § 2. The Buddha's Own Classification
>
>  1. The Buddha adopted a different classification of Dhamma.  
>  2. The first category he called Dhamma.  
>  3. He created a new category called Not-Dhamma (Adhamma) though it
> went by the name of Dhamma.  
>  4. He created a third category which he called Saddhamma.  
>  5. The third category was another name for Philosophy of Dhamma.  
>  6. To understand His Dhamma one must understand all the
> three--Dhamma, Adhamma, and Saddhamma.
