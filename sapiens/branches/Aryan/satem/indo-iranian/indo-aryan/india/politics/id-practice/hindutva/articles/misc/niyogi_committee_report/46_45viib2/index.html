No. 1
Name-Mahant Vaishnaodas.
Father’s name-Shri Swami Bajrangdas.
Caste-Vaishnao.
Age-50.
Occupation-Mahant, Dudhadhari Math.
Address-Raipur.
I confirm the statement which I have filed in reply to the questionnaire. I have not cared to enquire as to the exact denominations of the Missions, which are working here but I have been observing that the Missions have been trying to propagate their religion from 40 years but they have intensified their efforts since 1948 after India attained Independence. The number of preachers has been increased. The preachers include foreigners as well as Indians who have been converted to Christianity. I came across a Christian school teacher, who had come from Pharsabhadar to my village Thelki, told me that although he was actually getting Rs. 30, his salary was shown Rs. 60 in order to get increased grants. He had come to induce a farmer by name Dehra resident of my village to commit his son to his charge for education. The boy may be about 5 to 6 years of age. The farmer came to consult me. He is Satnami by caste. So I advised him not to comply with the preacher’s request as I thought that once he goes under the Christian influence he would embrace Christianity. The teacher generally goes out for preaching and he tries to induce the people to send their sons to is school telling them that by becoming Christians they will improve their social status as in Hindu society the Satnamis are not treated with respect. I learnt from people that the preachers even declare that the King Janak was a Christian-pointing out a text of Tulsidas’s Ramayan in which the word Girja occurs Girja Pujan Janani Pathai Sar Samip Giraja Griha Soha. As the Hindi equivalent for church is Girja Ghar, the preachers try to mislead the people. The people, who actually heard the preacher, told me about this.">

  <p><em>Statement made before the Christian Missionary Activities Enquiry
Committee.</em></p>
<p>CAMP: RAIPUR (22-7-1955)</p>
<p><strong>No. 1</strong></p>
<p><em>Name</em>-Mahant Vaishnaodas.<br>
<em>Father’s name</em>-Shri Swami Bajrangdas.<br>
<em>Caste</em>-Vaishnao.<br>
<em>Age</em>-50.<br>
<em>Occupation</em>-Mahant, Dudhadhari Math.<br>
<em>Address</em>-Raipur.</p>
<p>I confirm the statement which I have filed in reply to the
questionnaire.  I have not cared to enquire as to the exact
denominations of the Missions, which are working here but I have been
observing that the Missions have been trying to propagate their religion
from 40 years but they have intensified their efforts since 1948 after
India attained Independence.  The number of preachers has been
increased.  The preachers include foreigners as well as Indians who have
been converted to Christianity. I came across a Christian school
teacher, who had come from Pharsabhadar to my village Thelki, told me
that although he was actually getting Rs. 30, his salary was shown Rs.
60 in order to get increased grants.  He had come to induce a farmer by
name Dehra resident of my village to commit his son to his charge for
education.  The boy may be about 5 to 6 years of age.  The farmer came
to consult me.  He is Satnami by caste.  So I advised him not to comply
with the preacher’s request as I thought that once he goes under the
Christian influence he would embrace Christianity. The teacher generally
goes out for preaching and he tries to induce the people to send their
sons to is school telling them that by becoming Christians they will
improve their social status as in Hindu society the Satnamis are not
treated with respect.  I learnt from people that the preachers even
declare that the King Janak was a Christian-pointing out a text of
Tulsidas’s Ramayan in which the word Girja occurs Girja Pujan Janani
Pathai Sar Samip Giraja Griha Soha.  As the Hindi equivalent for church
is Girja Ghar, the preachers try to mislead the people.  The people, who
actually heard the preacher, told me about this.</p>
<p>Until the malguzari right was abolished I was the malguzar of 26
villages, which I used to often visit in the course of management and
there I used to hear the reports.  In these villages there are some
which have got very preponderating majority of the Satnamis and in some
villages there may be in a minority.  In village Vishrampur, which
adjoins my village Kolhey, almost all the Satnamis have embraced
Christianity.  I have seen the preachers sitting in a gathering of 20-25
persons. I have not heard what they preach because as soon as the people
saw me they left the gathering.  I am the head of the religious
organisation known as Vaishnaopanth.  The preachers sometimes used to
visit my quarters also and I used to provide t6em with necessaries.</p>
<p>Formerly, I did money-lending business nearabout Rs. 4 lakhs. I used to
charge interest varying from annas 8 to Rs. 1-8-0 per cent per month.
Some of my debtors used to incur debt from Christians and they have
become Christians.  The terms and conditions on which loans were
borrowed from Christians are not known to me.</p>
<p>It is a general report in the villages that the preachers get some
reward for conversions brought about by them. I cannot say exactly about
the improvement of their moral character but I know that after
conversion to Christianity people change their occupation such as from
farming to that of teachership or other Government service.</p>
<p>I have no objection, if there are special classes started for the
preaching of different religions.  I approve of such scheme in order to
avoid complications in the schools.  When I say that by conversion man’s
attitude to the Indian culture is affected, I mean that the Missionary
institutions get their inspiration and supplies of money from other
countries and naturally they would be attracted by the culture of
foreign countries and they would gradually come to disregard the Indian
tradition and culture.  If the monetary assistance which is received
from foreign countries is stopped, then the Christians would be standing
on the same footing as Jains, Buddhist, etc. In my opinion, an Indian
national has got the full freedom under the Constitution to preach and
propagate his religion, but a foreigner is not entitled to such
privileges.</p>
<p>A man after conversion to Christianity loses respect for the great
persons in India of history, such as, Maharana Pratap, Buddha,
Ramkrishna, etc.  I concede that the missions have done good work in the
field of education and medical relief, etc., but their intentions are
not good.  They are prompted by the motive of proselytising them.
Conversion generally takes place among scheduled castes, i.e., Harijans
and among the Adivasis (Scheduled Tribes).</p>
<p><em>Cross-examined at the request of Rev. Gurbachan Singh. -</em> I cannot give
you the name of the teacher about whom I have said that he gets Rs. 30
instead of Rs. 60.  He was a teacher in the Pharsabhadar school.  This
may be about 8 or 9 years back.  My village is near Vishrampur.  I
learnt in the village that there was a majority of Satnamis in that
village formerly, but that many of them had adopted Christianity.  In
that village, besides Satnamis, there are other classes such as
Marwaris, Kurmis.  About Vishrampur itself, I am stating definitely that
inducement such as educational facilities, medical relief, monetary help
by way of lending money and the hope of elevation of their social status
is offered.  In village Ghirmi, which belonged to me, there were about 8
families of Christians but there was a preponderance of Satnami
population.  All the converted families were Satnamis formerly.  In
Abhanpur village there are some Christians residing near the station. I
cannot say where they got converted to Christianity as they were not my
tenants.  I cannot give the name of the teacher about whom I said that
he received reward for conversion.  My general information was based on
reports prevailing in villages.  I have no personal knowledge.  All
converts that I know of my village were Satnamis and it is out of them
that preachers were appointed.  They may be about 4 or 5. I cannot say
how many of the converted Christians were educated before their
conversion.  I know that Indians also go abroad for preaching Hindu
religion but their main object is not conversion as it is of the
Christian Missionaries.  I cannot say whether the people in other
countries have embraced Hindu religion because of preaching.  When there
is a preaching of any religion, it is quite possible that some may be
influenced, and if he is convinced about the soundness he may be
converted.  I have not read lives of converts from religions other than
Hinduism. I do not know the names of Sadhu Sunder Singh Narayan Waman
Tilak, etc.</p>

<em>Age</em>-60.<br>
<em>Address</em>-Inmate of Government Leper Asylum, Raipur.</p>
<p>I am an inmate of the Leper Asylum for the last twenty years.  Prior to
8 or 9 years, it was a Mission Hospital.  It now belongs to Government.
I the disease about 25 years back and tried to secure admission into the
Mission Asylum about 21 years ago. I was told by Munsi, pastor-in-charge
that I would not be admitted, unless I become a Christian.  I was not
willing.  I remained outside for four or five days there.  When I
suffered too much I told Munsi, pastor, that I would become a Christian.
I was then admitted into the Asylum.  My baptism took place about two
months after I was admitted to the Asylum.  During this time they were
giving me troubles and made me to do all the work myself. They said that
I would get free treatment and other facilities after baptism.  Twice a
week a pastor from Raipur used to visit the asylum and give instructions
to us about Christian religion.  I did not like it, but then I had to
submit because of pressure.  After baptism a Christian name was given to
me; now I have forgotten. I remained a Christian for about 12 years.
During this time I used to read Bible. I was not permitted to read any
Hindu Scripture.  There might be hardly 3 or 4 persons in the Asylum as
Hindus and the rest were Christians.</p>
<p>About 7 or 8 years ago the Asylum was taken over by Government.  When we
came to know about this we gave an application stating that we had been
forcibly converted to Christianity and in reality we wanted to follow
our old Hindu religion.  We requested in the petition that we may be
allowed to come back to our old religion, i.e., Hinduism.  On our
petition, the District Magistrate went to the hospital and enquired from
us whether we had given the application voluntarily.  On our telling
that we had given it willingly, our application was granted.  At that
time, there were about 100 inmates including females.  The application
had been given by all.  All the applicants gave up Christianity.  At
present there are some Christian patients in the Asylum.  No pressure
had been brought on us when we gave the application.  During the time
when I was there, many other patients used to he admitted.  They were
admitted only as Christians and those who were not agreed to become
Christians had to go back All &lsquo;of them have now renounced
Christianity.</p>

<p>Mst. Hiro and Mojiram are inmates of the hospital for the last 11
years.  They state that they had adopted Christianity for some years so
long as the hospital was under the management of Christians and now they
have renounced Christianity and reverted to Hinduism because the Hindu
officers have taken charge of the hospital.  Nobody asked us to become
Hindu.  No pressure was brought on us to become Hindus.</p>

<p>Akhil Bharatiya Satnami Mahasabha has its headquarters at Mahasamund,
and was started 6 or 7 years ago.  The object of the Sabha was to
improve the condition of the Satnami community.  This Sabha is
affiliated to the Schedule Castes Federation which is led by Dr.
Ambedkar.  Having suffered from the hands of Hindus, we started this
organisation to enable Satnamis to exercise their own rights and to
prevent them from becoming Christians, Muslims, etc.  Our organisation
consists of 7 members.  There are about 4 lakhs Satnamis in Raipur,
Bilaspur and Durg districts.  I do propaganda amongst Satnamis as per
aims and objects of the Hindu Mahasabha.  Most of the Christian converts
are from Satnamis.  Some Satnamis also became converts to Islam as a
result of injustice to them by the Hindu society arid the Government.</p>
<p>There was caste system and untouchability amongst Hindus and Government
made no more efforts for the uplift and education of Satnamis whereas on
the other hand Christians were not treated as untouchables, were given
equal status and got employment, etc., and, therefore, many Satnamis
became converts to Christianity Satnamis become converts because they
read the religious literature distributed amongst them by preachers of
Christianity.  We want to remain as Hindus and fight for our rights.
They distribute Bible, exhibit films and carry on propaganda.  We have
reconverted two Christians to Satnamis.  We wear sacred threads
(<em>Janau</em>).  Sunderlal was a Brahman and he first asked us to wear Janau
and cheated us.</p>

<p>I had sent the letter, dated 26th January 1955, on behalf of the Sanatan
Dharma Rakshini Arya Pratinidhi Sabha.  This is a reply to the
Questionnaire. I settled at Basna about a year and half ago.  Prior to
that I was working in Delhi State.  In course of my routine work and
also for propaganda on behalf of the Sabha I am required to visit about
350 villages round about Basna. I am not paid worker of the Sabha.  At
Saraipali, there is a Roman Catholic Mission, and in Basna, the
Mennonite Mission functions.  Besides schools and hospitals, these
Missions do preaching of their religion and later on convert.</p>
<p>I know one Jogeshwar who got a gift of 30 acres of land as an inducement
for him to become a Christian.  He got the gift of land but he later on
recoiled from his promise to be a convert to Christianity on the ground
that his wife was opposed to that.  This occurred 10 years ago.
Jogeshwar is living and can be called to appear before this Enquiry
Committee, if necessary.  I know also another case which occurred last
year.  It was of one Rishi Harijan who had become reconvert to Hindu
religion.  When his brother was ill, he approached Dr. Dester of
Jagdishpur for treatment.  Dr. Dester asked him to become a Christian
before he could be treated.  He also offered an inducement that his
child would be treated free.  He demanded Rs. 25 in case he did not
accept his first proposal.  Rishi was compelled to pay this big amount.
Rishi is willing to appear before the Committee but he is unable to bear
the expenses.  He produces the letter which he received from Rishi.
About six months back I had gone to a village Palsabadi.  This is
inhabited mostly by Christians.  I expressed my desire to preach my
religion there.  When the pastor arrived and objected to my preaching, I
told him that being a preacher himself he should not object to my
preaching.  We decided to go to the village church where he promised to
give me time to speak.  There was a gathering of about 60 persons which
included 3 or 4 Christians.  The pastor started his preaching, in course
of which he indicated that Jesus Christ was the only Saviour and people
should not have faith in idol worship, wearing of sacred thread, keeping
of choti, etc.  About Krishna he said that he was a debauch and kept
16,000 wives.  The followers of his religion should not regard him as
their King and God, and his religion cannot be called true religion.
Winding up his speech in common prayer he stated that a Saitan
(referring to me) was present in the gathering and advised people that
if they were to listen to my advice they would go to hell, I was also
given permission to speak. I explained the implications of my religion
from beginning and tried to clarify some of the points raised by the
pastor before the gathering I spoke for about half an hour.  The
atmosphere throughout remained peaceful.</p>
<p><em>Examined by Rev. Gurbachan Singh-</em></p>
<p>I have got a dispensary in Basna where I stock my medicines, but there
is no board to indicate that I am a medical practitioner.  It is not
correct that Rishi was excommunicated from Christian religion.  The
report of Rishi given by me to the Commission (attached) is in Hindi.
He- got it written by somebody and it bears his signature.  I am unable
to say whether lie is literate or not.  He did not sign his name before
me.</p>

<p>Dr. Samuel is a medical practitioner at Mahasamund.  He along with his
followers visits Mahasamund markets and carries on preaching of
Christianity.  I heard his preaching.  Dr. Samuel said in the course of
his preaching that Salvation lies only through Jesus and not through
Ram, whose wife was snatched away, and he himself had to live in
jungle.  One Ramu of Bastar, who had three sons, 2 of whom died and the
third son became ill, came to us. We said that the only way to save him
was to have belief in Christ and he did believe in Christ and he was
baptised and he lived, so you see which religion you should follow?  So
long as there was Christian rule in India, the people were happy as life
was easier, things were cheaper.  Even, now your Government, i.e.,
Indian Government, depends upon America for its supply of wheat and also
gets loan of money.  That is how Indian Government is able to maintain
its-elf.  So if you become Christian, you will also be happy like us.</p>
<p>Dr. Samuel, addressing the Harijans, says that the laws passed by the
Government are ineffective.  They cannot help the Harijans in any way.
The only course for the Harijans is to embrace Christianity so that they
will demand full rights of equality in society and also be in a position
to demand a separate State for themselves, as the Naga Christians in
Assam are doing and others in Jharkhand . He cited the example of
Pakistan and said that they would also, get a separate State for
themselves.  In his dispensary are exhibited placards containing a
writing to the effect that those who worship idols will have to suffer
in Hell as insects.  This has a tendency to incite people.</p>
<p>In June 1955, a girl by name Jaggarbai, aged 13 years, was called by
Samuel to his house under the pretence of doing some service and she was
confined in the house at night. When the people discovered that the girl
was in that house she was brought out.  When the mother protested
against the conduct of Samuel, Samuel said that she had become
Christian, and she hacks lost bet caste.  She, therefore, could not be
admitted into the Hindu religion.  The matter had been reported to
Police on 12-6-1955.  It bears her thumb-impression.</p>
<p><em>Criss-examined at the request of Rev. Gurbachan Singh-</em> Dr.  Samuel is
a medical practitioner. Dr. Samuel it citizen of India.  Many people
must have heard what was said by Dr. Samuel in the bazar. I do riot know

<p>This village originally belonged to one Bisuji Pawar and was taken by
Rev, Restler in 1907.  As soon as he got possession of the village, he
demolished the temples of Thakurdeo and Mata Deola and on the site he
built his own bungalow.  To the west of the Basti was the stone of
Satbanidevi (village deity).  This stone was broken and used for
purposes of building.</p>
<p>Mr. Bear who was the manager of the village objected to the image of
Ravan in the year 1951 which was made in connection with the celebration
of <em>Ramlila</em> at the time of Daserah.  When the Hindus asked for
permission to have it atleast for a day, he said that he would not
tolerate idol worship in his village.</p>
<p>There was another incident in 1951 when <em>Ramayan</em> recital was made and
the servant of Rev. Bear arrived there and took objection to the recital
of <em>Ramayan</em> without the permission of his master.  Then, there was a
hot altercation between myself and the servant.  In that village, the
Hindus are in minority, and there are such clashes occurring from time
to time.  There are other instances in which Hindus are debarred from
following the village customs.  We have made many reports about this to
Deputy Commissioner and other officers.</p>
<p><em>By Rev. Gurbachan Singh.-</em> Patel of the village is a Hindu.  There are
8 members in the Gram Panchayat, out of whom, 5 are Hindus and 3
Christians.  Rev. Bear left the place 3 years ago.  Except a few
Sounjyas, all are Christians.  Dhansahay and Budhram, who were Hindus,
were in the service of Rev. Bear.  There are Thakurdeo and Mata
installed elsewhere.  The original place of village deity has now been
changed by us to another place after it was demolished by Christians.
Christian’s are in majority in the village.  The Patel was not elected
by the Gram Panchayat but is nominated.</p>

got him admitted in the Balodgahan school.  For two years, the expenses
were borne by me.  Thereafter Jiwanlal said that he had been awarded a
scholarship and, therefore, it was not necessary for me to incur any
expenditure. He was in the Balodgaban school for ten years.  Thereafter
he went to Dhamtari High School.  There he studied for three years and
went to Bangalore.  On return from there he is working as a Teacher in
the Dhamtari High School, Dhamtari.  It was only last year when he
married a Christian lady we came to know that he had become a
Christian.  Before that he had been telling us that he was getting
scholarship from the Mission and as such no expenses were required to be
incurred by us.  Before marriage he used to visit us on few occasions. I
do not know when my brother became a Christian.</p>

<p>Up to the 8th standard I was educated at my own expenses, i.e., expenses
of my family.  In the ninth class, I was awarded scholarship.  I cannot
say whether it was from Missionary funds or Government.  I got this
scholarship on my merit. I was in the Mission High School and I was
influenced by the Christianity teaching. I was convinced of the truth of
Christianity when I was 16 but I was not baptised then as I was a
minor.  On attaining majority in the year 1943, I was baptised, and
members of my family disliked my becoming a Christian and they tried to
dissuade me.  I used to usually reside in the hostel but during the
vacation I used to go to my home and meet the people.  We are still as
we were before on talking terms we also dine with each other.</p>
<p>Except that we differ in religion our social relations are as like those
as members of the family. I got one of my brothers trained in the normal
school at my own expenses but he has not embraced Christianity. I was
married in the year 1953 to a Christian girl.  Among Christians, we do
not observe caste. I was sent to Bangalore in the year 1945 for studies
in theological College.  I was there up to 1948. I got a loan from the
Mennonite Mission and I repaid.  My ancestral religion was Kabirpanth.
I belong to Teh Samaj.  I was familiar with Hindu religion as well as
the teachings to Kabir. I am impressed by the doctrine of redemption,
viz., Jesus died for the Sins of humanity.  My conversion was riot due
to any inducement by the Missionary.  There has been no other case of
non-Christian boy to Christianity from the Mennonite High School and the
majority of the school is non-Christians.  The non-Christians students
in the High School do not attend the Bible lesson but only moral
instruction.</p>

the poor patients the pictures of Krishna and the Gopis bathing in the
Jamuna, of Ram going to the forest on one side, and the picture of Jesus
on the other used to be displayed between 12 and 3 p.m. everyday.  The
preacher, who had come from Dehra Dun, used to ell them that the Krishna
was a man of bad character and Ram also had to leave his house on
account of disobedience to his parents, and then he used to ask
questions how can such Gods save you? On the other hand, look at Jesus,
at whose birth Krishna, Ram and Shankar and Viswamitra turned up to see
the new-born Baby (for Darshan).</p>
<p><em>To Mr. A. B. Shinde, Advocate, Jubbulpore.-</em> The pictures that I
mention were those which are ordinarily sold in the markets. I had
objected to this.  I did not report to anybody.  People from Bhatapara
go to Tilda for treatment.  I told about this to the people of
Bhatapara.  I also reported this to Shri Ganpat Rao Naidu belonging to
Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh.  The preacher had come for four days and it
was he, who had exhibited these pictures.</p>

<p>I was a Hindu first.  Then I became a Christian.  Subsequently I changed
my mind and performed Shuddhi ceremony and became Hindu again.  The
Policeman by name Pitambardas came to know of it.  He came to my village
one night at about 8 p.m. and called me. I came.  He asked me as to what
was my name. I gave him my name.  You were a Christian and now became
Hindu.  I will see your marks, show me the mark on your body.  I took
out my Kurata and there was no mark.  Then he said there is a mark on
car, pointing to the ear-hole.  I said that was not an ear-mark but it
was ear-hole.  He threatened me to send to Jail and also the person who
converted me.  He gave me a few slaps.  This is about a year back. I
reported this matter to the Police. I also informed some people in the
village.  I do not know what happened afterwards. I was converted to the
Mennonite Church.</p>
<p>One Manohar, who is a Christian, is my son-in-law.  My daughter was
married to him when I was a Christian.  That son-in-law of mine refused
to take my daughter to me even though the daughter protested that she
had not become a Hindu and why he should not take her.  He insisted that
unless her father changed his religion and became a Christian he would
not take her back.  She used to bring pressure on me to reconvert myself
to Christianity.</p>
<p>Now my daughter being afraid of ill-treatment by her husband, she would
rather remain with me than go to her husband under such condition.</p>
<p><em>To Mr, Shinde.-</em> I was never ex-communicated from the Church.  My
mother was a Christian.  My father, who was Christian, died.  My
brother, who was a Christian once, has now reverted to Hinduism.  The
whole of my family has now come back to Hinduism.  My brother’s name is
Jogindra.  My daughter was married about three or four years ago.  She
returned to my house about 10 months ago.  After marriage she used to
come off-and-on to my house.</p>

<p>I had once taken my wife for treatment to Jagdishpur Mission Hospital.
I went to the doctor.  He gave me a slip and directed me to the cashier
and then I went to the cashier by name Illiashid. (Dr. Dester is a
foreigner.) Then that cashier asked whether I wanted the welfare of my
patient and then he again repeated the same question. I said decidedly I
want that she should be cured then he said “you have to bring faith in
Christ, if you want that she should be cured otherwise you can go away”.</p>
<p>Anyhow my wife was admitted and there I found that they have to offer
Christian Prayers in the morning at 7 a.m. That is practically
indispensable not only to the patients but to their men.  They give all
sorts of stories of their religion.  There was a leper who went to a
Rishi, who was Bhakta of Ram, and asked him to cure him.  The leper
could not be cured by the Rishi.  Then, while returning back, he found
Jesus on the way.  He prayed to him and he was cured.  Jesus cured him.
Look here, the preacher says, the difference between our Lord and your
Lord.  They also distribute Bibles and show pictures.  A lot of
difference in the charges flat a non-Christian has to pay.  Their
treatment to a non-Christian who shows some spirit for his religion is
almost intolerable.</p>
<p><em>To Mr. A. B. Shinde.-</em> After that incident, I did not go to the
hospital.  The reason why I did not go to the hospital was that there
was no occasion.  She stayed in the hospital for 10 days and she was
cured.  I was also in the hospital once.  I have no grievance against
the actual treatment.  I do not know any other Hindu patients who go
there.</p>

man and one man comes assuming the form of Christ and then it is pointed
out that it is.  He alone that can save.  They ask the people to give up
idol worship and have faith in Christ who alone will help them- to go to
Heaven. Jackson, who is an Indian and others from outside come to the
village for preaching.</p>
<p><em>To Shri Shinde.-</em> In the village, the Hindus are in majority and
Christians in minority.  The patel is Radheshyam, a Hindu.  Kotwar is
also Hindu.  There are 10 members in the Gram Panchayat.  There is no
Christian member.  These dramas are occasionally staged.  The last was
held a year ago.  The villagers are invited to witness the drama.  The

in the school. I asked them to engage a Hindu teacher to teach Hindu
religion to Hindu boys but they refused to do so.  Accordingly, I sent
my son to the Janapada school, which is being held in the private house

<p>I have been a member of the Legislative Assembly for three terms. I am
Secretary of the Akhil Bharatiya Satnami Sabha.  Muktawandas was Satnami
Guru.  Adi Guru is Ghasidas.  He was the Guru of Satnami all over
India.  We are adherents of Hindu Religion. We will be agitated, if he
called himself Christian.  People will be prepared to die in a fight
with anybody who would say that the Adi Guru was a Christian.  The
Christian Missionaries go round all the villages, telling the people
that as Satnamis the remained down-trodden in Hindu society, that the
true Satnami is to be found in the Christian Scriptures, and that they
should give up the Hindu society and join Christianity.  Now the Hindus
have become conscious of the injustice done to the Satnamis, and are
improving them to some extent.  The Satnamis have full hope that the
Hindus will treat the Satnamis as their equals in every place.</p>
<p>I know of many instances like this. One Kejha of Medpa, Bilaspur
district, was an indoor patient in the hospital at Mungeli.  Influence
was brought to bear upon him to become a Christian that if he wanted to
be cured, he should embrace Christianity.</p>
<p>Bodhan Satnami of Dhawra Bata went to Bilaspur hospital.  There he was
similarly told and he was made Christian.  We have reconverted him to
Satnami sect.</p>
<p><em>To Mr. Shinde.-</em> What I said about the hospital is correct. I had been
to Mungeli hospital and told Bodhan not to become a Christian at any
cost.  This was about 6-7 years ago.  Bodhan said that he had already
adopted Christianity as it was impossible for him to live without
becoming a Christian.  He was converted to Christianity, while he was a
patient in hospital.  I visited the hospital a week after when Bodhan
had become a Christian. I do not know any of the Christian Missionaries
in the hospital. I did not ask anybody and protest to any Missionary.
Year after he was out of the hospital he requested me to take hint back
into the Satnami community which I did and Bodhan is now a Satnami.  I
actually heard at the Tilda hospital that the Christian Missionaries
preach to the patients, when they are waiting for admission, that if you
become Christians, you will enjoy equality of status and unlike the way
you are treated in a insulting manner in Hindu society by being given a
low status.  These preachers were Americans, as well as those who were
trained by Americans.  This is a matter so well-known that it need not
be supported by any evidence. I was myself an indoor patient in Tilda,
and I used to observe all this preaching that was going on. I have no
objection, if any man voluntarily becomes a Christian.  They had better
been asked to go to other hospital. I do not know of any case of patient
being told that unless he became Christian he would not be treated.</p>

<p>I produce this pamphlet entitled “Satyanami Panth”.  In this pamphlet it
is stated that Ghasidas, our original Guru was himself a Christian.
That Ghasidas was the disciple of Jesus Christ and in that capacity he
came to India and propagated here.  It is misled by such propaganda that
many Satnamis embrace Christian religion.  There are some offensive
references to some of our Gurus and they are very provocative.</p>
<p><em>To Mr. Shinde.-</em> When I stated above that Ghasidas was a disciple of
Jesus Christ, what I mean is that Ghasidas, who preached Satnam for the
first time, derived his inspiration from a Christian preacher, as it is
stated in the pamphlet.  My interpretation was that Guru Ghasidas
borrowed this idea from Christianity.  Among the Satnamis, I think 2 or
3 per cent people are literate.</p>

<p>The Mission is American Evangelical Mission which conducts the school.
We get Government grant as well as funds from America.  Government grant
is Rs. 16,225 and the American fund is between Rs. 30,000 and, Rs.
35,000.  The money comes from the Church in America, viz., “The
Evangelical Church”.  It has got a Board in America and it is through
this Board the grant is given.</p>
<p>We hold our Bible Classes towards the end of the day and we also hold
Moral Instruction Classes.  The Bible Classes are compulsory neither for
the Christians nor for the non-Christians.  It is only when express
permission of the parents that the pupil is admitted into the Bible
Class.  Since we met this Committee last, we have made a change in the
form of admission on the advice of the Committee.  Formerly express
permission was not in the form.  Now it has been inserted, since last
year.  The new forms are given this year.  Last year 70 per cent of the
consents were given. I can give you definite figures as regards 9th
class where only 12 have not produced any express permission out of 180.</p>
<p>In fact they have given letters that they should be exempted from the
Bible Class.  In this class, there are not more than 20 students of
Christians.  Parents know that the ward will be studying Bible.  We
issue these forms after the admissions.  This does not affect Admissions
at all.  This year I admitted about 40 boys in 9th class.  These forms
were issued only to these 40 boys and not to others promoted from other
schools and who have already given once.</p>
<p>There are no prescribed text-books for moral instruction.  These books
on moral lesson are published by Christian organisations.  These books
are not sectarian.  Besides Government Scholarships the Mission also
awards tuition aids which are given to boys irrespective of caste but
only to poor people.</p>
<p>There are very few students in the High School from rural area.  The
percentage of tuition aid and freeships among Christians and
non-Christians is 50 per cent, Out of two hostels one is open to all but
one is mainly meant for Christians.  There is a difference in the
charges between the two hostels.  In the Christian hostel the charges
are lower.  In the first hostel we charge Rs. 4 per student per month
and in the other hostel we charge nothing.  There the facilities are
better.</p>
<p><em>To Mr. Shinde.-</em> The money received from America is called donation and
not grant.  It varies from year to year.  The average for the last five
years is Rs. 30,000 to Rs. 35,000.  There have been no cases of
conversion in school or boarding house.</p>
<p><em>To Mr. T. L. Shrivastava.-</em> I joined in 1929 as Assistant Teacher. I

He is senior to me.  He is Hindu.</p>
<p>(Further questions on this point disallowed.)</p>
<p>The Christian Prayers are offered in the beginning and all students
remain present.  The attendance is recorded afterwards.  Since 1945,
when I became hostel Superintendent. I discontinued attendance of all
boys to Sunday School.  Out of 26 teachers, 12 are Christians and 9 are
Brahmins, 2 Muslims and the rest Hindus.  The Christian teacher conducts
the Moral Class.  No Hindu teacher is asked to take Moral Class.</p>

<p>Last year, I was Headmaster.  This year, I am Assistant Headmaster.  It
is a Co-educational High School.  The strength of the school is 572, out
of whom 170 are Christians.  Twice in a week there are classes
simultaneously in Moral Instructions and Bible.  In order to avoid all
objections and misunderstanding we restrict the Bible Classes only to
Christians.  Our High School is conducted by the Mennonite Mission.  We
started this Moral Instruction Class only last year and it is taken by a
Christian teacher.  Whatever aid the Christian boys receive is from
Church.  Mission gives donation to the Church.  It is not a definite sum
but whatever the deficit it is there, it is met by donation from the
Mission which comes through the Church and not directly.  The amount of
donation received through the Church is about Rs. 12,000 to Rs. 15,000
per annum.  The Mennonite Mission has handed over the responsibility of
carrying out the Church schools, and hospitals to the Church.  This
Church is a body which is registered as Mennonite Church, Dhamtari.  The
Headquarters of this Mission were in America formerly.  This Mennonite
Mission is quite different from Mennonite General Conference.  Donation
of Rs. 12,000 comes from America, the Headquarters of the Mennonite
Mission.  It is an open secret that Missions in India are receiving
funds from foreign countries.  Formerly there used to be 15-16
foreigners families in this district, but now there are only five
families. I would welcome Indian Church to be free from outside
control.  Even though we receive financial aid from foreign countries,
the administrative control is of Indians.  Our Evangelisation work is
carried through preachers who are 7 or 8, but even their number is being
reduced.  We are also running Shantipur Leper Asylum and Christian
Hospital at Bathina. i.e. Dhamtari.  To the best of my knowledge there
have been no conversions since 1947.</p>
<p><em>To Mr. T. L. Shrivastava.-</em> An American by name Dr. Friesen is in
charge of the Leper Asylum at Shantipur and Dr. Conrage is in charge of
Dhamtari Hospital.  Ten minutes before the scheduled time for the
commencement of the, school, the Christian Prayers are held but it is
not compulsory to attend them.  The President of Executive Council of

Prayer may be offered.</p>

were about 75 patients who agreed to be reconverted.  I did not agree
and, therefore, was asked to go away and was not even allowed to take

<p>I appear before the Committee as Chairman of the Board of Governors of
the General Conference Mennonite Church with its headquarters at
Jadgishpur.  In village Shirko, near Basna, the Mission ran a Primary
school a few days prior to the scheduled visit of the Committee to
Basna.  Last year atmosphere in the village was stirred chiefly by Shri
Datta Sharma of the Sanatan Dharma Mahasabha with the result that the
guardians of all the students refused to send the boys to attend classes
and I tried to find out the cause.  It was that as Bible was being
taught the students would not be sent. I told those guardians that Bible
Classes were taken up only after the school hours but as the atmosphere
had been created against Christians the guardians did not listen to us.</p>
<p>I have personal experience of the area for the last 15 years and then
the relations between the Christians and non-Christians were cordial and
smooth.  For some time past, i.e., nearly 18 months ago an agitation
against Christians has been started. I will give fuller details of
incidents in a separate written note.</p>

<p><em>To Mr. T. L. Shrivastava.-</em> The pressure that is brought to bear upon
the Christian community for reconversion is alarming.  This I am saying
about Shuddhi movement.  Shri Datta started this movement of Shuddhi.
This movement has caught the imagination of those villages which are
inhabited by Christians mostly.  I have no personal knowledge of any
pressure. used.  I believe this on information received from members of
my community.  I was not actually present to witness the incident which
is stated in my written statement.  I inspected the site after the
incident and saw the damage that was done to the wall.  This incident of
singing filthy songs in Holi occurred for the first time in
Christianpara in this manner.  The road is public.  This time it was
deliberately provocative.  There is likelihood of clashes between two
parties.  The matter was reported to the police but no complaint was
made in a court of law.</p>
<p>STATEMENT MADE BEFORE THE CHRISTIAN MISSIONARIES ACTIVITIES ENQUIRY
COMMITTEE, JULY 24TH, 1955, HELD AT RAIPUR IN THE COURT OF THE PERSONAL
ASSISTANT TO THE DEPUTY COMMISSIONER</p>
<p><em>Written statement given by Mr. S. Stephen, Chairman of the Governing
Body, General Conference Mennonite Church, headquarters at Jagdeeshpur,
district Raipur, and headmaster, Christian High School at Jagdeeshpur.</em></p>
<p>The following statement is given in continuation of witness given before
the Committee on Saturday, the 23rd July 1955, in the afternoon
session:-</p>
<p>In Shirko village which is in Basna thana of Raipur district the
previously mentioned Shri Dutt Sharma so much instigated the Hindu
community that they withdrew their children from the Christian Primary
School, where they had been going for the last fifteen years.  When I
went there with few men from Jagdeeshpur to attend a meeting of the
leaders of the Shirko village. I heard the people say that they had
withdrawn their children from the Christian Primary School because they
were taught the Bible.  I told them that the Bible is taught outside the
school hour and their children are not required to attend the Bible
Classes.  Mr. Sharma was also present in the meeting.  The former
malguzar who is also a Janapada counsellor and has a great influence
upon the people said that unless the school is turned over to the
Janapada they would not send their children to school.  From that time
on the persecution of the Christians by the Hindus was started.</p>
<p>The Hindus refused to sell them rice and other necessaries of life which
the Christians were formerly buying from them.  Even the children were
refused “chana” and “murra” when they wanted to buy it.  The Christians
of the village attempted more than once to restore friendly relation
between the Christians and non-Christians but the answer given by Hindu
leaders was unless on turn over the primary school to Janapada and
unless you give ‘Deo-barar’ which means contribution for the puja of a
Hindu God, same relations cannot be restored.</p>
<p>There were two Christian members out of ten in the village Panchayat.
The Chairman does not send information of the meeting to them and does
not call them.  This matter was reported to the Inspector who looks
after panchayats and is stationed in Basna.</p>
<p>The persecution continued and took a very fierce form when on the night
of the ‘holi festival’ in 1955 frames of two buffallo carts belonging to
the Christians were burnt; three timber pieces from the old church
building which is under construction now were also offered to the
burning fire.  So much so that the loom of a Christian named Samsoon
Barik was also burnt.</p>
<p>In the morning of the ‘holi’ a big group of non-Christians of the
village came to the Christian para to celebrate “Holi” for the first
time ever since these people are Christians.  They spent over an hour in
this para, dancing and merry-making, uttering all sort of filthy
language, even abusing people by name, especially mentioning the name of
Joseph Nag’s wife who is a very respected leader of the Christians and
the Church.  They also threw stones on the roofs and walls of the
Christians and the Christians were so much terrified that they had to
shut themselves inside their houses.  But after some time a Christian by
the name Bhikhari Kumar came out and begged them not to insult them in
this manner and ruin their property He fell on their feet but they would
not listen.  The Hindus had clubs in their hands and they beat the wall
of Joseph Nag’s house so much that even the plaster to the extent of
about 36 square feet fell from the wall.  After celebrating holi to
their hearts content in this wounding manner they left.</p>
<p>They came back in the afternoon at 3 and began to dance with their
musical instruments in front of the church within the church yard.
There has been a church at this place for over 25 years and it is being
remodelled now.  The Hindus went even inside the four walls of the
church and danced, thereby desecrating our place of worship.  Then the
“Baiga” established an “Itwari Devi” right in front of the Church on the
border of our church yard.  There had never been any sign of such a Devi
in that place.  This was done in order to create trouble for the
Christians, otherwise what was the necessity of establishing such a
place so close to the church.  Even the Patwari and the Revenue
Inspector who are also Hindus are influenced by them and when they were
approached the Patwari using his usual professional trick showed this
Devi’s place outside the Church yard by about one foot.  A report of the
incident of this particular has been given to the Basna Police Station.</p>
<p>In Palsabhari, Shri Shiv Dutt Sharma as he has already stated went into
the church and preached his religion to a Christian audience on Sunday.
This is definitely a desecration of the church and it has hurt the
Christians very much.  Would a Muslim be allowed to preach Islam in a
Hindu temple or <em>vice versa</em>.</p>
<p>Our hospital in Jagdeeshpur has rendered services to the sick for over
20 years irrespective of caste and creed.  We have never used our
hospital as a bait to convert people, nor we have pressed the sick to
change their faith.  We serve them as they come and during this long
period not a single person has become Christian in our hospital.  Had we
started the hospital with that motive, it would have been closed long
ago.</p>
<p>During the former visit of the Committee to Jagdeeshpur, the honourable
member Shri Gupta went into our hospital wards with one M. L. A. I was
also with them.  He collected first-hand information from the patients
and I know none of them corroborated the charges which have been brought
against our hospital, by the people before and by those who were
examined here.</p>
<p>May I also add that the Indian church is independent of the Mission in
policy, personnel and funds.  It has its own constitution and it is
registered according to the Society’s Act.</p>
<p>The Mission has placed its work in the hands of Managing Committees
Which consist of Indians and Missionaries both as they are elected and
this work is also run according to its constitution.</p>

<p>The present Leper Asylum at Raipur formerly belonged to Mission to
Lepers and was managed by a local Committee comprising the Commissioner
of Division as Chairman and the Secretary used to be a foreign
Missionary on behalf of the Mission to Lepers.  They managed it about
from 1904 to June 1947.  It was taken over by Government in June 1947
with the approval of the Committee.  At that time, there were 150
inmates including 70 men and 80 women.</p>
<p>On 11th October 1948, 77 Christian inmates presented an application to
the Deputy Commissioner saying that they had been forcibly converted in
the previous regime and that they wanted to revert to their old
religion.  In all, there were 89 Christian patients.  The Deputy
Commissioner deputed a senior Extra-Assistant Commissioner to enquire
into the application and Rev. Seybold was also there at the time of
enquiry.  He was specially invited there.  In course of the enquiry,
each one of the applicants was asked whether any pressure was brought
against him to present the application.  Subsequently, at the instance
of the signatories, an Arya Samajist preacher performed the Shuddhi.  I
have, before me original application signed by Videshi and find thumb
impression of Videshi against S. No. 14.  Along with the rest, Videshi
was also reconverted by the Shuddhi.  He continued to be an inmate till
22nd December 1949.  Shuddhi ceremony was performed in December 1948.</p>
<p>He left the Asylum of his own accord and was not discharged by the
authorities.  Previous to that there were reports of misconduct and he
was reported to be playing mischiefs against the rules of hospital.  For
this, he had been warned.</p>
<p>I have on my file a letter dated the 21st June 1949, from Shri
Essabaggers and Shri Seybold to the address of the Deputy Commissioner,
Raipur.  In this letter names of all Christian inmates of the hospital
have been given.  The name of Videshi is not there because although he
was an inmate then he had become a Hindu.  If he has alleged that he was
expelled from the Asylum because of his refusal to give up Christianity,
the allegation is false.</p>
<p>At present, there are three Christian women inmates in the hospital.</p>
<p>As a Leprosy Specialist to Government, it is my duty to visit in-patient
institutions and those institutions which treat patients in the out-door
and also to attend to Government Leprosy work.  I have visited all the
institutions belonging to the Mission to Lepers in Madhya Pradesh. I
keep on receiving reports from inmates that they are being continuously
forced to become Christians and discrimination in treatment is also
shown.  Only yesterday, five inmates of the Rajnandgaon Leper Asylum
came and stated that because of their refusal to embrace Christianity
they have left the Asylum.  I have not yet admitted them into the Raipur
Asylum, unless antecedents were found.</p>
<p><em>To Rev. Gurbachansingh.-</em> The Raipur Asylum was practically of the same
type as the other Mission institutions like Chandkhuri, Shantipur and
Champa.  I say so because it was under the management of Mission to
lepers. I was appointed as Superintendent of the Hospital. I took over
charge within a month.  I was one of the members of the former
Committee.  No account was presented to this Committee.  I do not know
whether accounts were audited or not.  Never report was presented to the
Committee. I was on the Committee for a year or so.  I did not ask as a
member of the Committee how this Asylum was run and why the report was
not presented. I was co-opted as a member as a Specialist to look after
the medical side.  I was interested in technical part.</p>
<p>You had not come to see me in connection with the Shuddhi ceremony but
in connection with the services and I had no talk with you in this
matter, and you also did not talk to me about this. I was not present at
the Shuddhi ceremony.  There is a reference to this matter in the letter
mentioned before.  Before disciplinary action is taken against an
inmate, proper enquiries are made.  Written records are kept.  We don’t
take their signatures or their thumb-impressions on explanations. I have
not so far recorded the statements of five persons who came to me
yesterday from the Rajnandgaon Mission Leper Asylum.  I am not sure as
to what they said is correct.</p>
<p><strong>No. 30</strong></p>
<p><em>Name</em>-John Gardia.<br>
<em>Caste</em>-Christian.<br>
<em>Occupation</em>-Patel of Jalkot Basna, tahsil Mahasamund.</p>
<p>Jalkot has a population of about 60 families, out of which about ten
families belong to Christians.  I am elected Patel for the three years.
I have my own land and I am also religious preacher.  I do preaching
work on behalf of the Mennonite Hindustani Church.  My preaching work is
chiefly confined to Basna although I visit other village’s nearabout.  I
get Rs. 60 per month as pay for preaching from the Church.  For
preaching purposes, I collect Hindus in villages irrespective of caste
or community and explain the implications of my own religion.  I also
hear from the others what they have to say about their respective
religion.  It is not correct that I decry Hindu Gods and Goddesses, I
talk disparagingly of other religions.  I know Shri Datta Sharma of
Basna.  He is also a pracharak.  He is a great friend of mine.  I have
attended several of his lectures.  He generally preaches that there is a
danger of all Hindus becoming Christians and, therefore, to protect our
nationality, it is necessary to reconvert those Hindus who have become
Christians.  He says that, if this is not done, India would be ruled by
America or England, etc.  Then, he calls Christians of the village and
starts asking them why they had become Christians.  On being told that
they became converts of their free-will having been convinced of that
religious faith, Shri Sharma tells them that Jesus is not God and talks
disparagingly about Jesus Christ and Christian religion.  He also with
the help of villagers created atmosphere against Christians in several
villages and they are being harassed.  He says that he has been from
Delhi.  One Wasudeo Misra of Amapali had become a convert about three
years ago.  At the instance of Shri Datta Sharma, he was reconverted,
and I was present at the Shuddhi ceremony.  Promises of service were
given to him but subsequently they were not fulfilled.  I have
accidentally come in possession of his post card, dated the 17th April
1955, which Wasudeo Mishra wrote to the Manager, Arya Sabha, Raipur,
complaining that he was forcibly reconverted and promises of proper and
service were given but not fulfilled.  After reconversion, Wasudeo Misra
has become without property and was for some time roaming here and
there.  His Christian-wife and two children were also not looked after
by the Hindus.  I also approached Shri Datta Sharma on behalf of Wasudeo
to provide him with some means of livelihood but Sharmaji expressed his
inability.  Ultimately, Misra with his wife and children came and took
residence with me.  He repented and approached Rev. J. Cardia to take
him back but the Rev. said that Misra was not a Christian as he used to
make all the statements before the Committee and that he would be taken
back after they were convinced that his faith in Christ is true.  We are
Christians and love our country, viz., India.  We would not go to any
foreign power and will not allow the country to be ruled by the
foreigners.</p>
<p>I was elected by all.</p>
<p><em>To Mr. T. L. Shrivastava.-</em> Before a person is baptised, religious
instructions are given to him for a year and baptism takes place only
after we are satisfied that he has true faith in the Christian
religion.  During preaching, we only point out the good points and
advantages of our religion and do not compare other religion to it.
Jesus Christ can forgive him, if he repents.</p>
<p><strong>No. 31</strong></p>
<p><em>Name</em>-S.  N. Solomon.<br>
<em>Caste</em>-Christian.<br>
<em>Occupation</em>-Teacher in Mission High School, Dhamtari.</p>
<p>I am a teacher in Mission High School, Dhamtari, and Executive Secretary
of Mennonite Church in Dhamtari.  The Church has 5 or 6 primary schools,
2 middle schools, 1 high school, 1 hospital and 5 dispensaries and 1
leper home.  We also have, at present, 6, 7 pracharaks.  Preaching is
done with the help of flannel, graph pictures, dramas, etc.  Oral
preaching is also done.  Our sole aim is to depict the life of Jesus
Christ.  If, as a result of preaching, any one is convinced and believes
the life of Jesus Christ and is willing voluntarily to embrace
Christianity we take him in our fold.  In course of our preaching, we do
not criticise other religions, use no abusive language towards their
gods and deities and take care that the sentiments of the other persons
are not affected.  Our preacher receives training in the Bible schools
and we hold Bible normal conferences from time to time.  So far as I am
aware, none of our preachers has attempted to offend the religious
feelings of any other religion.  We take a special care about that.  But
the instances have come to my notice that non-Christians have objected
our preaching mainly on the grounds that they would not like any
Christian people although it may not relate to any other religion, As
the Bible says that Jesus Christ is the only Saviour and, if the people
are offended by the preachings of out fundamental rights, then I cannot
help.  I cannot say whether this preaching involves condemnation of
other religions or not.  About 2 years ago in a village Sihava Revenue
Inspector Circle, a police constable threatened a Christian woman and
asked her not to preach in the village.</p>
<p>I have long experience of Balodagahan village and heard statements made
before the Committee by witnesses for the last two days.  The
allegations regarding the destruction of Satbani Devi, the destruction
of Deogarh are not correct.  Some people did take stones from a nallah
adjoining the Devi but no Christian destroyed the Goddess.  Similarly,
Deogarh is still there and was not destroyed by the Christians.  At
present, the relations between Christians and non-Christians of
Balodagahan have become tense because of the instigation of outsiders.
Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the Arya Samajists are mostly concerned
in this.  During Easter Week, for a full week processions were taken on
the streets of Dhamtari, shouting slogans against Christianity aria
carrying placards against Christianity.  Some booklets also were
Distributed.  In an area of about 200 square miles round Dhamtari, there
are only 2,500 Christians including children.  As a result of such
activities on the part of non-Christians, we have become apprehensive.</p>
<p><em>To Mr. T. L. Shrivastava.-</em> My complaint is that the slogan that the
Christians should quit India is objectionable.  The slogans are “Videshi
Issai Bharat Chhoro, Videshi Missionary Bharat Chhoro”.  At present,
there are five American families and about three nurses working in the
Mission.  They are wholly supported by American money.  Our propaganda
is carried on with the aid of some subscription and some foreign aid.
Foreign aid is spent for carrying on the educational work and
Evangelistic work.  Church does not contribute to the Evangelistic
work.  The proportion of expense on account of pracharak is very
small.</p>

<p><em>Name</em>-Rev.  S. Mahlan.<br>
<em>Caste</em>-Christian.<br>
<em>Occupation</em>-Pastor, St. Paul’s Church, Raipur.</p>
<p>Prior to one year, the relations between Christians and non-Christians
were cordial but due to the activities of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
and Arya Samajists, they have been disturbed, and strained.  Arya
Samajist preachers g6 in the rural areas of Raipur and indulge in
abusing Christians and their religion by such slogans that they are
beef-eaters, horse-eaters, eating the flesh of their Guru, Jesus, etc.,
and that Jesus was born of adultery. I have myself heard such types of
preachings on several occasions.  They also take out processions
shouting “let Issais quit India”.  By Issai, they mean Indian
Christians.  I have in my possession some literature which is being
distributed at the instance of Ved Prachar Samiti, Raipur, derogatory
language against Christians and their religion has been used in the book
which I produce before the Committee.  They are likely to give offense
to Christians.  The Arya Samajists not only carry on propaganda against
Christians but also Government.  I file a copy of “Bharat me Bhayankar
Shad Yantra”. I file another pamphlet entitled “Issai Matki Alochana”.
In this, tenets religion have been misinterpreted.  There is another
pamphlet “Issai Padriyose Prashna” contains misinterpretation of our
religious text, the. distribution of such leaflets has offended the
feelings of Christians of Raipur.  In pamphlet “Padriyoko Khuli
Chunouti”, there is an attack on foreign missionary at page 14.  In the
following objectionable and insulting references on pages marked:-</p>
<p>“Bibleki Vidhwankari Sanda”,</p>
<p>Kuda ka Beta, Issai Mat Pol Prakash,</p>
<p>Issai Matoki Nissarata Pakhand our Anachar,</p>
<p>Kya Issa Khuda the”.</p>
<p><em>To Rev. Ghurbachansingh.-</em> St. Paul’s Church, of which I am the pastor,
is financially independent. It is the part of the United Church of North
America, administratively, free from all control.  It receives no aid
from foreign country.</p>

<p>I am Social Welfare Secretary of the Cass Memorial Centre, Raipur, and

<p>This morning, I had gone to the Raipur Leper Asylum, where I met three
Christian inmates.  They told me that Shri Banerji, the Superintendent
of the Asylum, had enquired of them whether they were being harassed and
on their reply affirmative Banerji told them not to disclose this to any
officer who might enquire.</p>

<p>About three months ago, an Arya Samajist preacher was giving, a lecture
in public near Imperial Bank at Raipur, in course of which he used
insulting and abusive language towards Christ saying that Jesus Christ
was a debauch and a loafer, and further that Christians will be turned
out of India and are cheats.  When I asked them not to use abusive
language, they came and surrounded me.  I told them that I was prepared
to offer physical violence.  I am an electric worker.</p>
<p>I also saw those Arya Samaj processions where they were shouting
objectionable things.</p>
