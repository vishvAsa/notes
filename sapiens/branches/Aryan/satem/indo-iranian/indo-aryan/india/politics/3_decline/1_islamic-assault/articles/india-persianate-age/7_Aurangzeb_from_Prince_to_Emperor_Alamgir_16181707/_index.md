I know my fortune in extremes does lie:

The Sons of Indostan must Reign, or die,

That desperate hazard Courage does create,

As he plays frankly, who has least Estate,

And that the World the Coward will despise.

When Life’s a Blank, who pulls not for a Prize?

– *John Dryden,* Aureng-zebe: A Tragedy *\(written 1675\)*1
