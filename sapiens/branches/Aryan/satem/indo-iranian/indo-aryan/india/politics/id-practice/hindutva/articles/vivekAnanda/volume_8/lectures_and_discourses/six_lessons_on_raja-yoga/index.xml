      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;raja-yoga-first-lesson&#34;&gt;RAJA YOGA FIRST LESSON&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(These lessons are composed of notes of class talks given by Swami&#xA;Vivekananda to an intimate audience in the house of Mrs. Sara C. Bull, a&#xA;devoted American disciple, and were preserved by her and finally printed&#xA;in 1913 for private circulation — &lt;em&gt;Ed&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rāja-Yoga is as much a science as any in the world. It is an analysis of&#xA;the mind, a gathering of the facts of the supersensuous world and so&#xA;building up the spiritual world. All the great spiritual teachers the&#xA;world has known said, &amp;ldquo;I see and I know.&amp;rdquo; Jesus, Paul, and Peter all&#xA;claimed actual perception of the spiritual truths they taught.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

These are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First — Yama. This is most important and has to govern the whole life;&#xA;it has five divisions:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;1st. Not injuring any being by thought, word, or deed.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;2nd. Non-covetousness in thought, word, or deed.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;3rd. Perfect chastity in thought, word, or deed.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;4th. Perfect truthfulness in thought, word, or deed.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;5th. Non-receiving of gifts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We are thinking&#xA;of the soul as body, but we must separate it from sense and thought.&#xA;Then alone can we know we are immortal. Change implies the duality of&#xA;cause and effect, and all that changes must be mortal. This proves that&#xA;the body cannot be immortal, nor can the mind, because both are&#xA;constantly changing. Only the unchangeable can be immortal, because&#xA;there is nothing to act upon it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We have to seize this&#xA;unstable mind and drag it from its wanderings and fix it on one idea.&#xA;Over and over again this must be done. By power of will we must get hold&#xA;of the mind and make it stop and reflect upon the glory of God.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Mind is not soul or spirit. It is only matter in a&#xA;finer form, and we own it and can learn to manipulate it through the&#xA;nerve energies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

You may have a&#xA;vision of it come to you, and this is the best way. Then meditate for a&#xA;long time on that. It is a very fine, very brilliant thread, this living&#xA;passage through the spinal cord, this way of salvation through which we&#xA;have to make the Kundalini rise.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
