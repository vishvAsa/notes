      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;women-of-india&#34;&gt;WOMEN OF INDIA&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Delivered at the Shakespeare Club House, in Pasadena, California, on&#xA;January 18, 1900&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;SWAMI VIVEKANANDA: &amp;ldquo;Some persons desire to ask questions about Hindu&#xA;Philosophy before the lecture and to question in general about India&#xA;after the lecture; but the chief difficulty is I do not know what I am&#xA;to lecture on. I would be very glad to lecture on any subject, either on&#xA;Hindu Philosophy or on anything concerning the race, its history, or its&#xA;literature. If you, ladies and gentlemen, will suggest anything, I would&#xA;be very glad.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>811 MY LIFE AND MISSION</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-life-and-mission&#34;&gt;MY LIFE AND MISSION&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Delivered at the Shakespeare Club of Pasadena, California, on January&#xA;27, 1900&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, ladies and gentlemen, the subject for this morning was to have been&#xA;the Vedanta Philosophy. That subject itself is interesting, but rather&#xA;dry and very vast.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I have been asked by your president and some of the ladies&#xA;and gentlemen here to tell them something about my work and what I have&#xA;been doing. It may be interesting to some here, but not so much so to&#xA;me. In fact, I do not quite know how to tell it to you, for this will&#xA;have been the first time in my life that I have spoken on that subject.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>812 BUDDHA&#39;S MESSAGE TO THE WORLD</title>
      <link>https://vishvAsa.github.io/notes/sapiens/branches/Aryan/satem/indo-iranian/indo-aryan/india/politics/id-practice/hindutva/articles/vivekAnanda/volume_8/lectures_and_discourses/812_buddhas_message/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;buddhas-message-to-the-world&#34;&gt;BUDDHA&amp;rsquo;S MESSAGE TO THE WORLD&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Delivered in San Francisco, on March 18, 1900&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Buddhism is historically the most important religion — historically, not&#xA;philosophically — because it was the most tremendous religious movement&#xA;that the world ever saw, the most gigantic spiritual wave ever to burst&#xA;upon human society. There is no civilisation on which its effect has not&#xA;been felt in some way or other.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The followers of Buddha were most enthusiastic and very missionary in&#xA;spirit. They were the first among the adherents of various religions not&#xA;to remain content with the limited sphere of their Mother Church. They&#xA;spread far and wide. They travelled east and west, north and south. They&#xA;reached into darkest Tibet; they went into Persia, Asia Minor; they went&#xA;into Russia, Poland, and many other countries of the Western world. They&#xA;went into China, Korea, Japan; they went into Burma, Siam, the East&#xA;Indies, and beyond. When Alexander the Great, through his military&#xA;conquests, brought the Mediterranean world in contact with India, the&#xA;wisdom of India at once found a channel through which to spread over&#xA;vast portions of Asia and Europe. Buddhist priests went out teaching&#xA;among the different nations; and as they taught, superstition and&#xA;priestcraft began to vanish like mist before the sun.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>813 DISCIPLESHIP</title>
      <link>https://vishvAsa.github.io/notes/sapiens/branches/Aryan/satem/indo-iranian/indo-aryan/india/politics/id-practice/hindutva/articles/vivekAnanda/volume_8/lectures_and_discourses/813_discipleship/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;discipleship&#34;&gt;DISCIPLESHIP&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Delivered in San Francisco, on March 29, 1900&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My subject is &amp;ldquo;Discipleship&amp;rdquo;. I do not know how you will take what I&#xA;have to say. It will be rather difficult for you to accept it — the&#xA;ideals of teachers and disciples in this country vary so much from those&#xA;in ours. An old proverb of India comes to my mind: &amp;ldquo;There are hundreds&#xA;of thousands of teachers, but it is hard to find one disciple.&amp;rdquo; It seems&#xA;to be true. The one important thing in the attainment of spirituality is&#xA;the attitude of the pupil. When the right attitude is there,&#xA;illumination comes easily.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>814 IS VEDANTA THE FUTURE RELIGION?</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;is-vedanta-the-future-religion&#34;&gt;IS VEDANTA THE FUTURE RELIGION?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Delivered in San Francisco on April 8, 1900&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Those of you who have been attending my lectures for the last month or&#xA;so must, by this time, be familiar with the ideas contained in the&#xA;Vedanta philosophy. Vedanta is the most ancient religion of the world;&#xA;but it can never be said to have become popular. Therefore the question&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Is it going to be the religion of the future?&amp;rdquo; is very difficult to&#xA;answer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
