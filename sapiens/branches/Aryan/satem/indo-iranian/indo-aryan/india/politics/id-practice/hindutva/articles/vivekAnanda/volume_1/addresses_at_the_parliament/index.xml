      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;response-to-welcome&#34;&gt;RESPONSE TO WELCOME&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At the World&amp;rsquo;s Parliament of Religions, Chicago&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;11th September, 1893&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sisters and Brothers of America,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It fills my heart with joy unspeakable to rise in response to the warm&#xA;and cordial welcome which you have given us. I thank you in the name of&#xA;the most ancient order of monks in the world; I thank you in the name of&#xA;the mother of religions; and I thank you in the name of millions and&#xA;millions of Hindu people of all classes and sects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>001 WHY WE DISAGREE </title>
      <link>https://vishvAsa.github.io/notes/sapiens/branches/Aryan/satem/indo-iranian/indo-aryan/india/politics/id-practice/hindutva/articles/vivekAnanda/volume_1/addresses_at_the_parliament/001_v1_c1_why_we_disagreee/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-we-disagree&#34;&gt;WHY WE DISAGREE&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;15th September, 1893&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I will tell you a little story. You have heard the eloquent speaker who&#xA;has just finished say, &amp;ldquo;Let us cease from abusing each other,&amp;rdquo; and he&#xA;was very sorry that there should be always so much variance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But I think I should tell you a story which would illustrate the cause&#xA;of this variance. A frog lived in a well. It had lived there for a long&#xA;time. It was born there and brought up there, and yet was a little,&#xA;small frog. Of course the evolutionists were not there then to tell us&#xA;whether the frog lost its eyes or not, but, for our story&amp;rsquo;s sake, we&#xA;must take it for granted that it had its eyes, and that it every day&#xA;cleansed the water of all the worms and bacilli that lived in it with an&#xA;energy that would do credit to our modern bacteriologists. In this way&#xA;it went on and became a little sleek and fat. Well, one day another frog&#xA;that lived in the sea came and fell into the well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>002 PAPER ON HINDUISM</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;paper-on-hinduism&#34;&gt;PAPER ON HINDUISM&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Read at the Parliament on 19th September, 1893&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Three religions now stand in the world which have come down to us from&#xA;time prehistoric — Hinduism,  Zoroastrianism and Judaism. They have all&#xA;received tremendous shocks and all of them prove by their survival their&#xA;internal strength. But while Judaism failed to absorb Christianity and&#xA;was driven out of its place of birth by its all-conquering daughter, and&#xA;a handful of Parsees is all that remains to tell the tale of their grand&#xA;religion, sect after sect arose in India and seemed to shake the&#xA;religion of the Vedas to its very foundations, but like the waters of&#xA;the seashore in a tremendous earthquake it receded only for a while,&#xA;only to return in an all-absorbing flood, a thousand times more&#xA;vigorous, and when the tumult of the rush was over, these sects were all&#xA;sucked in, absorbed, and assimilated into the immense body of the mother&#xA;faith.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>003 RELIGION NOT THE CRYING NEED OF INDIA</title>
      <link>https://vishvAsa.github.io/notes/sapiens/branches/Aryan/satem/indo-iranian/indo-aryan/india/politics/id-practice/hindutva/articles/vivekAnanda/volume_1/addresses_at_the_parliament/003_v1_c1_crying_need/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;religion-not-the-crying-need-of-india&#34;&gt;RELIGION NOT THE CRYING NEED OF INDIA&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;20th September, 1893&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Christians must always be ready for good criticism, and I hardly think&#xA;that you will mind if I make a little criticism. You Christians, who are&#xA;so fond of sending out missionaries to save the soul of the heathen —&#xA;why do you not try to save their bodies from starvation? In India,&#xA;during the terrible famines, thousands died from hunger, yet you&#xA;Christians did nothing. You erect churches all through India, but the&#xA;crying evil in the East is not religion — they have religion enough —&#xA;but it is bread that the suffering millions of burning India cry out for&#xA;with parched throats. They ask us for bread, but we give them stones. It&#xA;is an insult to a starving people to offer them religion; it is an&#xA;insult to a starving man to teach him metaphysics. In India a priest&#xA;that preached for money would lose caste and be spat upon by the people.&#xA;I came here to seek aid for my impoverished people, and I fully realised&#xA;how difficult it was to get help for heathens from Christians in a&#xA;Christian land.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>004 BUDDHISM, THE FULFILMENT OF HINDUISM</title>
      <link>https://vishvAsa.github.io/notes/sapiens/branches/Aryan/satem/indo-iranian/indo-aryan/india/politics/id-practice/hindutva/articles/vivekAnanda/volume_1/addresses_at_the_parliament/004_v1_c1_buddhism/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;buddhism-the-fulfilment-of-hinduism&#34;&gt;BUDDHISM, THE FULFILMENT OF HINDUISM&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;26th September, 1893&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am not a Buddhist, as you have heard, and yet I am. If China, or&#xA;Japan, or Ceylon follow the teachings of the Great Master, India&#xA;worships him as God incarnate on earth. You have just now heard that I&#xA;am going to criticise Buddhism, but by that I wish you to understand&#xA;only this. Far be it from me to criticise him whom I worship as God&#xA;incarnate on earth. But our views about Buddha are that he was not&#xA;understood properly by his disciples. The relation between Hinduism (by&#xA;Hinduism, I mean the religion of the Vedas) and what is called Buddhism&#xA;at the present day is nearly the same as between Judaism and&#xA;Christianity. Jesus Christ was a Jew, and Shākya Muni was a Hindu. The&#xA;Jews rejected Jesus Christ, nay, crucified him, and the Hindus have&#xA;accepted Shākya Muni as God and worship him. But the real difference&#xA;that we Hindus want to show between modern Buddhism and what we should&#xA;understand as the teachings of Lord Buddha lies principally in this:&#xA;Shākya Muni came to preach nothing new. He also, like Jesus, came to&#xA;fulfil and not to destroy. Only, in the case of Jesus, it was the old&#xA;people, the Jews, who did not understand him, while in the case of&#xA;Buddha, it was his own followers who did not realise the import of his&#xA;teachings. As the Jew did not understand the fulfilment of the Old&#xA;Testament, so the Buddhist did not understand the fulfilment of the&#xA;truths of the Hindu religion. Again, I repeat, Shākya Muni came not to&#xA;destroy, but he was the fulfilment, the logical conclusion, the logical&#xA;development of the religion of the Hindus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;address-at-the-final-session&#34;&gt;ADDRESS AT THE FINAL SESSION&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;27th September, 1893&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The World&amp;rsquo;s Parliament of Religions has become an accomplished fact, and&#xA;the merciful Father has helped those who laboured to bring it into&#xA;existence, and crowned with success their most unselfish labour.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My thanks to those noble souls whose large hearts and love of truth&#xA;first dreamed this wonderful dream and then realised it. My thanks to&#xA;the shower of liberal sentiments that has overflowed this platform. My&#xA;thanks to his enlightened audience for their uniform kindness to me and&#xA;for their appreciation of every thought that tends to smooth the&#xA;friction of religions. A few jarring notes were heard from time to time&#xA;in this harmony. My special thanks to them, for they have, by their&#xA;striking contrast, made general harmony the sweeter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
