> § 1. His Compassion—The Maha Karunik
>
>  1. When once the Blessed Lord was staying in Shravasti, the
> almsmen came and informed him that they were constantly harassed by
> the Deva who disturbed them in their meditations.  
>  2. After hearing their stories of harassment, the Blessed Lord
> gave them the following instructions:  
>  3. "He who is skilled in his godness, who wishes to attain that
> calm state, should act thus: he should be able, upright, near
> perfectly upright, of noble speech, gentle and humble.  
>  4. "Contented, easily supportable, with few duties, of light
> livelihood, controlled in senses, discreet, not impudent, not greedily
> attached to families.  
>  5. "He should not pursue anything trifling such that other wise
> men might censure him. He should wish, 'May all beings be happy and
> secure; may their hearts be wholesome.'  
>  6. "Whatever living beings there be--feeble or strong, tall, stout
> ,and medium, short, small, or large, without exception;  
>  7. "Seen or unseen, those dwelling far or near, those who are
> born, or who are to be born--may all beings be happy.  
>  8. "Let none deceive another, nor despise any person whatsoever in
> any place; let him not wish any harm to another, out of anger or
> ill-will.  
>  9. "Just as a mother would protect her only child at the risk of
> her own life, even so let him cultivate a boundless heart towards all
> beings.  
>  10. "Let his thoughts of boundless love pervade the whole world,
> above, below and across, without any obstruction, without any
> enmity.  
>  11. "Whether he stands, walks, sits, lies down, as long as he is
> awake, he should develop this mindfulness; this, they say, is the
> noblest living here.  
>  12. "Not falling into error (self-illusion), being virtuous and
> endowed with insight, by discarding attachment to sense desires, never
> does he come again for conception in a womb."  
>  13. In short, he told them "Love your enemies."
>
>   
> §2. Healing of the Stricken: A Consummate Healer of Sorrow.
>
> (2.i) Consoling Visakha
>
>  1. Visakha was an upasika. It was her routine to give alms to the
> bhikkhus.  
>  2. One day her grand-daughter, Suddata, who lived with her, fell
> ill and died.  
>  3. Visakha was unable to bear the grief.  
>  4. After \[the\] cremation, she went to the Buddha and sat on one
> side, sad, with tearful eyes.  
>  5. "O Visakha," asked the Blessed One, "wherefore dost thou sit,
> sad and mournful, shedding tears?"  
>  6. She told him of her grand-daughter's death, saying, "She was a
> dutiful girl, and I cannot find her like."  
>  7. "How many young girls, say, are there dwelling in Shravasti, O
> Visakha?"  
>  8. "Lord, men say there are several kotis (several millions)."  
>  9. "If all these were like thy grand-daughter, would thou not love
> them?"  
>  10. "Verily, Lord," replied Visakha.  
>  11. "And how many die daily in Shravasti?"  
>  12. "Many, Lord."  
>  13. "Then there is never a moment when thou wouldst not be
> grieving for someone?"  
>  14. "True, Lord."  
>  15. "Wouldst thou then spend thy life weeping day and night?"  
>  16. "I understand, Lord; it is well said!"  
>  17. "Grieve, then, no more."
>
> (2.ii) Comforting Kisa Gautami
>
>  1. Kisa Gautami was married to the son of a merchant of
> Shravasti.  
>  2. Soon after marriage, a son was born to her.  
>  3. Unfortunately her child died of a snake-bite before it could
> walk.  
>  4. She could not believe that her child was really dead, as she
> had not seen death before.  
>  5. The little spot red from the bite of a snake, did not look as
> if it could be the cause of the child's death.  
>  6. She therefore took her dead child and wandered about from house
> to house, in such a wild state of mind that people believed that she
> had gone out of her senses.  
>  7. At last one old man advised her to go and seek out Gautama, who
> happened at the time to be in Shravasti.  
>  8. So she came to the Blessed One, and asked him for some medicine
> for her dead child.  
>  9. The Blessed One listened to her story and to her
> lamentations.  
>  10. Then the Blessed One told her, "Go enter the town, and at any
> house where yet there has been no death, thence bring a little mustard
> seed, and with that I will revive your child."  
>  11. She thought this was easy, and with the dead body of her child
> she entered the town.  
>  12. But she soon found that she had failed, as every house she
> visited had suffered loss in the death of some member.  
>  13. As one householder told her, "The living are few, and the dead
> are many."  
>  14. So she returned to the Blessed Lord, disappointed and
> empty-handed.  
>  15. The Blessed Lord then asked her if she did not then realize
> that death was the common lot of all, and whether she should grieve as
> though it was her special misfortune.  
>  16. She then went and cremated the child, saying, "All is
> impermanent; this is the law."
>
>   
> § 3. His Concern for the Sick
>
> (3.i)
>
>  1. Now at one time a certain brother was suffering from dysentery,
> and lay where he had fallen down in his own excreta.  
>  2. And the Exalted One, going on his rounds of the lodgings, with
> the venerable Ananda in attendance, came to the lodging of that
> brother.  
>  3. Now the Exalted One saw that brother lying where he had fallen
> in his own excreta; and seeing him, he went towards him, and said,
> "Brother, what ails you?"  
>  4. "I have dysentery. Lord."  
>  5. "But is there anyone taking care of you, brother?"  
>  6. "No, Lord."  
>  7. "Why is it, brother, that the brethren do not take care of
> you?"  
>  8. "I am useless to the brethren, Lord; therefore the brethren do
> not care for me."  
>  9. Then the Exalted One said to the venerable Ananda, "Go you,
> Ananda, and fetch water. I will wash this brother."  
>  10. "Yes, Lord," replied the venerable Ananda to the Exalted One.
> When he had fetched the water, the Exalted One poured it out, while
> the venerable Ananda washed that brother all over. Then the Exalted
> One, taking him by the head and the venerable Ananda taking him by the
> feet, together they laid him on the bed.  
>  11. Then the Exalted One, in this connection and on this occasion,
> gathered the Order of Brethren together, and questioned the brethren,
> saying:  
>  12. "Brethren, is there in such and such a lodging a brother who
> is sick?"  
>  13. "There is, Lord."  
>  14. "And what ails that brother?"  
>  15. "Lord, that brother has dysentery."  
>  16. "But, brethren, is there anyone taking care of him?"  
>  17. "No, Lord."  
>  18. "Why not? Why do not the brethren take care of him?"  
>  19. "The brother is useless to the brethren, Lord. That is why the
> brethren do not take care of him."  
>  20. "Brethren, ye have no mother and father to take care of you.
> If ye will not take care of each other, who else, I ask, will do so?
> Brethren, he who would wait on me, let him wait on the sick.  
>  21. "If he have a teacher, let his teacher take care of him so
> long as he is alive, and wait for his recovery. If he have a tutor or
> a lodger, a disciple or a fellow lodger or a fellow disciple, such
> should take care of him and await his recovery. If no one takes care
> of him, it shall be reckoned an offence."
>
> (3.ii)
>
>  1. Once the Exalted One was staying near Rajagraha in the great
> grove, at the squirrels feeding ground.  
>  2. On that occasion the venerable Vakkali was staying in the
> potter's shed, being sick, afflicted, stricken with a sore disease.  
>  3. Now the venerable Vakkali called to his attendants, saying:
> "Come hither, friends! Go ye to the Exalted One and, in my name
> worshipping at the feet of the Exalted One, say unto him, 'Lord, the
> brother Vakkali is sick, afflicted, stricken with a sore disease. He
> worships at the feet of the .Exalted One.' And thus do you say: 'Well
> were it, Lord, if the Exalted One would visit brother Vakkali, out of
> compassion for him.'"  
>  4. The Exalted One consented by His silence. Thereupon the Exalted
> One robed himself and, taking bowl and robe, went to visit the
> venerable Vakkali.  
>  5. Now the venerable Vakkali saw the Exalted One coming while he
> was yet far off, and on seeing him he stirred upon his bed.  
>  6. Then said the Exalted One to the venerable Vakkali, "Enough,
> Vakkali! Stir not on your bed! There are these seats made ready;. I
> will sit there." And he sat down on a seat made ready. So the Exalted
> One sat down and said to the venerable Vakkali:  
>  7. "Well, Vakkali, I hope you are bearing up. I hope you are
> enduring. Do your pains abate and not increase? Are there signs of
> their abating and not increasing?"  
>  8. "No, Lord, I am not bearing up, I am not enduring. Strong pains
> come upon me. They do not abate. There is no sign of their abating,
> but of their increasing."  
>  9. "Have you any doubt, Vakkali? Have you any remorse?"  
>  10. "Indeed, Lord, I have no doubt. I have no remorse."  
>  11. "Have you not anything, Vakkali, wherein you reproach yourself
> as to morals?"  
>  12. "Nay, Lord, there is nothing wherein I reproach myself as to
> morals."  
>  13. "Then, Vakkali, if that is so, you must have some worry, you
> must have something you regret."  
>  14. "For a long time. Lord, I have been longing to set eyes on the
> Exalted One, but I had not strength enough in this body to come to see
> the Exalted One."  
>  15. "Hush, Vakkali; what is there in seeing this vile body of
> mine? He who seeth the Norm, he seeth me; he who seeth, Vakkali, seeth
> the Norm. Verily, seeing the Norm, Vakkali, one seeth me; seeing me,
> one seeth the Norm."
>
> (3.iii)
>
>  1. Thus have I heard: The Exalted One was once staying among the
> Bhaggi, at crocodile haunt in Bhesakala grove in the deer-park. Then
> the housefather, Nakulapita, came to the Exalted One, saluted Him, and
> sat down at one side.  
>  2. As he sat there, the housefather Nakulapita addressed the
> Exalted One, saying: "Master, I am a broken-down old man, aged, far
> gone in years; I have reached life's end, I am sick and always ailing.
> Moreover, Master, I am one to whom rarely comes the sight of the
> Exalted One and the worshipful brethren. Let the Exalted One cheer and
> comfort me, so that it be a profit and a blessing unto me for many a
> long day."  
>  3. "True it is, true it is, housefather, that your body is weak
> and cumbered! For one carrying this body about, housefather, to claim
> but a moment's health would be sheer foolishness. Wherefore,
> housefather, thus should you train yourself: 'Though my body is sick,
> my mind shall not be sick.' Thus, housefather, must you train
> yourself."  
>  4. Then Nakulapita, the housefather, welcomed and gladly heard the
> words of the Exalted One; and rising from his seat ,he saluted the
> Exalted One by the right, and departed.
>
> (3.iv)
>
>  1. Once the Exalted One was staying among the Sakyans at
> Kapilavastu, in the fig-tree park.  
>  2. Then on that occasion a number of brethren were busy with
> making robes for the Exalted One. "For," said they, "when the three
> months are over, the Exalted One, his robes being complete, will go
> forth on his rounds."  
>  3. Now Mahanama, the Sakyan, heard it said, "A number of brethren
> are busy with making robes, and so forth"...and he went to the Exalted
> One, saluted him, and sat down at one side. So seated, Mahanama, the
> Sakyan, said:  
>  4. "I hear it said. Lord, that a number of the brethren are busy
> with making robes for the Exalted One, saying, 'when the robes are
> complete, at the end of the three months, the Exalted One will go
> forth on his rounds.' Now, Lord, we have never heard from the Exalted
> One's own lips how a discreet layman who is sick, in pain, grievously
> afflicted, should be cheered by another discreet lay-brother."  
>  5. "A discreet lay-brother, Mahanama, who is sick...should be
> cheered by another discreet lay-brother with the Four Comfortable
> Assurances, thus: 'Take comfort, good sir, in the Norm, and in the
> Order of Brethren; likewise in the virtues dear to the Norm kept
> unbroken and unsoiled, which tend to balance of mind.'  
>  6. "Then, Mahanama, when a discreet lay-brother who is sick has
> thus been cheered with the Four Comfortable Assurances by another
> lay-brother, such should be the words of that other:  
>  7. "Suppose the sick man should have a longing for his parents.
> Then if the sick man says, 'I have a longing for my parents,' the
> other should reply, 'My dear good man, you are subject to death.
> Whether you have longing for your parents or not, you will die. 'Twere
> just as well for you to abandon all longing for your parents.'  
>  8. "And suppose the sick man says, 'That longing for my parents is
> now abandoned,' then the other should say, 'Ye,t my good sir, you
> still have a longing for your children. As you must die in any case,
> 'twere just as well for you to abandon longing for your children.'  
>  9. "And so also should he speak in respect of the five pleasures
> of the senses. Suppose the sick man says, I have a longing for the
> five pleasures of sense,' the other should say, 'My friend, heavenly
> delights are more excellent than the five pleasures of sense, and more
> choice. 'Twere well for you to remove your mind from human joys and
> fix it on the joys of the Four Great Deva Kings.'  
>  10. "Again, if the sick man says, 'My mind is so fixed,' let the
> other say, 'Better to fix your mind on the Brahma world.' And then if
> the sick man's mind is so fixed, let the other say:  
>  11. "'My good sir, even the Brahma world is impermanent, not
> lasting, subject to personality. Well for you, dear sir, if you raise
> your mind above the Brahma world, and concentrate on cessation from
> the personal.'  
>  12. "And if the sick man says he has done so, then I declare,
> Mahanama, that there is no difference between the lay-brother who can
> thus aver, and the disciple whose mind is freed from the asavas--that
> is to say, so far as emancipation goes."
>
>   
> § 4. His Tolerance of the Intolerant
>
> 1\. Once the Blessed Lord was dwelling in the realm of the Yakkha
> Alavaka, in the town of Alavi. Then the Yakkha Alavaka approached the
> Blessed Lord and, having approached him, said thus: "Get out, O
> Monk!"  
>  2. The Blessed Lord departed, saying: "Very well, friend."  
>  3. The Yakkha then ordered, "Enter, O Monk."  
>  4. The Blessed Lord entered, saying: "Very well, friend."  
>  5. For the second time also the Yakkha Alavaka told the Blessed
> Lord, "Get out, O Monk!"  
>  6. The Lord departed, saying: " Very well, friend."  
>  7. "Enter, O Monk!" said the Yakkha, the second time.  
>  8. The Lord entered, saying: "Very well, friend."  
>  9. For the third time also the Yakkha Alavaka told the Lord, "Get
> out, O Monk!"  
>  10. The Lord departed, saying: "Very well, friend."  
>  11. "Enter, O Monk " said the Yakkha again.  
>  12. The' Lord entered, saying: "Very well, friend."  
>  13. For the fourth time did the Yakkha tell the Lord, "Get out, O
> Monk!"  
>  14. This time the Lord replied: I shall not get out, friend; you
> may do what you like."  
>  15. "I shall put a question to you; monk; if you do not answer my
> question, I will drive you out of your wits or I will tear \[out\]
> your heart, or I will take you by the feet and throw you to the other
> side of the river," said the angry Yakkha,  
>  16. "I do not see, friend, anyone in the world who could drive me
> out of my wits or tear out my heart, or take me by the feet and throw
> me across the river. Still, friend, you may put any question you
> like."  
>  17. Then the Yakkha Alavaka asked the Lord the following
> questions:  
>  18. "What is the noblest wealth for a man in this world? What pure
> action brings happiness? What is the sweetest of all tastes? What
> manner of living is said to be the noblest living?"  
>  19. The Lord replied: "Faith is the noblest wealth for a man in
> this world. The Dhamma well observed brings happiness. Truth is the
> sweetest of all tastes. The living endowed with wisdom is said to be
> the noblest thing."  
>  20. Yakkha Alavaka asked: " How does one cross the flood
> (rebirth)? How does one cross the sea (existence)? How does one
> overcome suffering?"  
>  21. The Lord replied: "One crosses the flood by Faith. One crosses
> the sea by Vigilance. One overcomes suffering by Exertion. One
> purifies oneself by wisdom."  
>  22. Yakkha Alavaka asked: "How does one acquire knowledge? How
> does one obtain wealth? How does one attain fame? How does one gain
> friends? Passing from this world to the other world after death, how
> does one not repent ?"  
>  23. The Lord replied: "Having faith in Arahats and in the Dhamma
> for the attainment of Nibbana, and by obedience, the diligent,
> attentive person acquires wisdom.  
>  24. "One who does what is proper, one who is resolute, one who is
> awake, he acquires wealth. One who gives acquires friends.  
>  25. "The faithful householder in whom truthfulness, righteousness,
> patience, and generosity are found, he does not repent after death.  
>  26. "Come on! Also consult other numerous monks and Brahmins,
> whether there are any other qualities higher than truth, self-control,
> charity and patience."  
>  27. Yakkha Alavaka said: "Now, why should I consult various
> Brahmins and monks? Today I know the prosperity which belongs to my
> future good.  
>  28. "Indeed! the Buddha came to the dwelling of Alavi for my
> benefit. Today I know to whom, when given, it returns the greatest
> fruit.  
>  29. "From today I will wander from village to village, from town
> to town, paying my respect to the fully Enlightened One, and his
> perfect Doctrine."
>
>   
> § 5. His Sense of Equality and Equal Treatment
>
>  1. Whatever rules the Blessed Lord had made for the members of the
> Sangh were voluntarily and willingly accepted by him to be binding on
> him also.  
>  2. He never claimed any exemption or any special treatment on the
> ground that he was the acknowledged head of the fraternity, and to
> whom any concession would have been most willingly made by the
> fraternity out of the boundless love and respect they bore for him.  
>  3. The rule that the members of the Sangh could take only one meal
> a day was accepted and followed by the Blessed Lord as much as it was
> by the bhikkhu.  
>  4. The rule that the members of the Sangh should have no private
> property was accepted and followed by the Blessed Lord as much as it
> was by the bhikkhu.  
>  5. The rule that no member of the Sangh should have more than
> three pieces of cloths was accepted and followed by the Blessed Lord
> as much as it was by the bhikkhu.  
>  6. Once, when the Lord was living in the Sakyan country at
> Kapilavastu in the banyan grove, Maha-Prajapati Gautami, the mother of
> the Blessed Lord, came to the Lord with two new lengths of cloth which
> she begged the Lord to be so good as to accept from her, as it was the
> work of her own hands at the loom expressly for him.  
>  7. To her the Lord made the answer, "Give it to the
> confraternity."  
>  8. A second and a third time did Gautami repeat her request, only
> to receive the same reply.  
>  9. Then Ananda intervened, saying, "Pray accept, sir, the cloth
> presented by Gautami. She was of great service to the Lord as nurse
> and foster-mother, suckling her nephew when his own mother died." But
> the Blessed Lord insisted upon the cloth being given to the
> confraternity.  
>  10. Originally it was the rule of the Sangh that the robes of the
> members should be made of rags picked up from dung heaps. This rule
> was made to prevent the wealthier classes from joining the Sangh.  
>  11. Once Jivika prevailed upon the Blessed Lord to accept a robe
> of newly made cloth. When the Lord accepted it, he at the same time
> relaxed the original rule and allowed the bhikkhu the same privilege.
