CHAPTER XV
WHO CAN DECIDE ?
I
[Partition is a very possible contingency for which it’s best to be prepared]
There are two sides to the question of Pakistan, the Hindu side and the Muslim side. This cannot be avoided. Unfortunately, however, the attitude of both is far from rational. Both are deeply embedded in sentiment. The layers of this sentiment are so thick that reason at present finds it extremely difficult to penetrate. Whether these opposing sentiments will wither away or they will thicken, time and circumstances alone can tell. How long Indians will have to wait for the melting of the snow no one can prophesy. But one thing is certain, that until this snow melts freedom will have to be put in cold storage. I am sure there must be many millions of thinking Indians who are dead opposed to this indefinite postponement of Indian freedom till an ideal and a permanent solution of Pakistan is found. I am one of them. I am one of those who hold that if Pakistan is a problem and not a pose, there is no escape and a solution must be found for it. I am one of those who believe that what is inevitable must be faced. There is no use burying one’s head in the sand, and refusing to take notice of what is happening round about because the sound of it hurts one’s sentiments. I am also one of those who believe that one must, if one can, be ready with a solution long before the hour of decision arrives. It is wise to build a bridge if one knows that one will be forced to cross the river.">

prepared]</p>
<p>There are two sides to the question of Pakistan, the Hindu side and
the Muslim side. This cannot be avoided. Unfortunately, however, the
attitude of both is far from rational. Both are deeply embedded in
sentiment. The layers of this sentiment are so thick that reason at
present finds it extremely difficult to penetrate. Whether these
opposing sentiments will wither away or they will thicken, time and
circumstances alone can tell. How long Indians will have to wait for the
melting of the snow no one can prophesy. But one thing is certain, that
until this snow melts freedom will have to be put in cold storage. I am
sure there must be many millions of thinking Indians who are dead
opposed to this indefinite postponement of Indian freedom till an ideal
and a permanent solution of Pakistan is found. I am one of them. I am
one of those who hold that if Pakistan is a problem and not a pose,
there is no escape and a solution must be found for it. I am one of
those who believe that what is inevitable must be faced. There is no use
burying one&rsquo;s head in the sand, and refusing to take notice of what is
happening round about because the sound of it hurts one&rsquo;s sentiments. I
am also one of those who believe that one must, if one can, be ready
with a solution long before the hour of decision arrives. It is wise to
build a bridge if one knows that one will be forced to cross the river.</p>
<p>The principal problem of Pakistan is: who can decide whether there
shall or shall not be Pakistan? I have thought over the subject for the
last three years, and I have come to some conclusions as to the proper
answer to this question. These conclusions I would like to share with
others interested in the solution of the problem so that they may be
further explored. To give clarity to my conclusions, I have thought that
it would serve the purpose better if I were to put them, in the form of
an Act of Parliament. The following is the draft of the Act which
embodies my conclusions.</p>
<p>II<br>
[I offer this draft of a &lsquo;Government of India (Preliminary Provisions)
Act&rsquo;]</p>
<p><strong>Government of India (Preliminary Provisions) Act</strong></p>
<p><em>Be it enacted by the King&rsquo;s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the

this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same as
follows :—</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>I.</strong>—(1) If within six months from the date appointed in this
behalf a majority of the Muslim members of the Legislatures of the
Provinces of the North-West Frontier, the Punjab, Sind and Bengal pass
a resolution that the predominantly Muslim areas be separated from
British India, His Majesty shall cause a poll to be taken on that
question of the Muslim and the non-Muslim electors of these Provinces

lawful for His Majesty to make arrangements for the framing of a
single constitution for British India as a whole.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>V.</strong>— No motion for the separation of Pakistan if the poll under
the last preceding section has been against separation forthwith, and
no motion for incorporation of Pakistan into Hindustan if the poll
under the last preceding section has been in favour of separation
forthwith, shall be entertained until ten years have elapsed from the
date appointed by His Majesty for putting into effect the new
constitution for British India or the two separate constitutions for
Pakistan and Hindustan.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>VI.</strong>—(1) In the event of two separate constitutions coming into
existence under Section Four it shall be lawful for His Majesty to
establish as soon as may be after the appointed day, a Council of
India with a view to the eventual establishment of a constitution for

between the Legislatures and Governments of Pakistan and Hindustan,
and to the promotion of mutual intercourse and uniformity in relation
to matters affecting the whole of British India, and to providing for
the administration of services which the two parliaments mutually
agree should be administered uniformly throughout the whole of British
India, or which by virtue of this Act are to be so administered.</em></p>

elected a member of the Council, cease to be a member of the Council:
Provided that, on the dissolution of the Legislature of Pakistan or
Hindustan, the persons who are members of the Council shall continue
to hold office as members of the Council until a new election has
taken place and shall then retire unless re-elected.</em></p>
<p><em>(6) The President of the Council shall preside at each meeting of the
Council at which he is present, and shall be entitled to vote in case
of an equality of votes, but not otherwise.</em></p>

elective members are to be returned and the number of the members to
be returned by the several constituencies and the method of election.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>VII.</strong>—(1) The Legislatures of Pakistan and Hindustan may, by

authorising the construction, extension, or improvement of railways
and waterways where the works to be constructed are situate wholly in
Pakistan or Hindustan as the case may be.</em></p>
<p><em>(3) The Council may consider any questions which may appear in any
way to bear on the welfare of both Pakistan and Hindustan, and may, by
resolution, make suggestions in relation thereto as they may think
proper, but suggestions so made shall have no legislative effect.</em></p>

recommendations to the Legislatures of Pakistan and Hindustan as to
the advisability of passing identical Acts delegating to the Council
of India the administration of any all-India subject, with a view to

Hindustan and the Council shall take such steps as may be necessary to
carry out the transfer, including adjustments of any funds in their
hands or at their disposal.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>VIII.</strong>—(1) If at the end of ten years after [the] coming into
operation of a constitution for British India as prescribed by Section
IV—(3) a petition is presented to His Majesty by a majority of the
Muslim members representing the Scheduled Districts in the Provincial

<p><em><strong>X.</strong>—(1) Where two constitutions have come into existence under
circumstances mentioned in Section IV, it shall be lawful for His
Majesty to declare by an Order-in-Council that Pakistan shall cease to
be a separate State and shall form part of Hindustan. Provided that no
such order shall be made until ten years have elapsed from the
commencement of the separate constitution for Pakistan. Provided also
that no such declaration shall be made unless the Popular Legislatures
of Pakistan and Hindustan have passed Constituent Acts as are provided
for in Section X—(2).</em></p>
<p><em>(2) The popular Legislatures of Pakistan and Hindustan may, by

(Preliminary Provisions) Act, I94 .</em></p></blockquote>
<p>III<br>
[My plan is community-based, and thus more realistic than the Cripps
plan]</p>
<p>I do not think .that any detailed explanation is necessary for the
reader to follow and grasp the conclusions I have endeavoured to embody
in this skeleton Act. Perhaps it might be advantageous if I bring out
some of the salient features of the proposals to which the projected
statute of Parliament is intended to give effect, by comparing them with
the Cripps proposals.</p>
<p>In my opinion it is no use for Indians to ask, and the British
Parliament to agree, to proceed forthwith to pass an Act conferring
Dominion Status or Independence, without first disposing of the issue of
Pakistan. The Pakistan issue must be treated as a preliminary issue and
must be disposed of one way or the other. This is why I have called the
proposed Act &ldquo;The Government of India (Preliminary Provisions) Act.&rdquo; The
issue of Pakistan, being one of self-determination, must be decided by
the wishes of the people. It is for this that I propose to take a poll
of the Muslims and non-Muslims in the predominantly Muslim Provinces. If
the majority of the Muslims are in favour of separation, and a majority
of non-Muslims are against separation, steps must be taken to delimit
the areas wherever it is possible by redrawing provincial boundaries on
ethnic and cultural lines, by separating the Muslim majority districts
from the districts in which the majority consists of non-Muslims. A
Boundary Commission is necessary for this purpose. So a Boundary
Commission is provided for in the Act. It would be better if the
Boundary Commission could be international in its composition.</p>
<p>The scheme of separate referenda of Muslims and non-Muslims is based
on two principles which I regard as fundamental. The first is that a
minority can demand safeguards for its protection against the tyranny of
the majority. It can demand them as a condition precedent
[=precondition]. But a minority has no right to put a veto on the
right of the majority .to decide on questions of ultimate destiny. This
is the reason why I have confined the referendum on the establishment of
Pakistan to Muslims only. The second is that a communal majority cannot
claim [=compel] a communal minority to submit itself to its dictates.
Only a political majority may be permitted to rule a political minority.
This principle has been modified in India, where a communal minority is
placed under a communal majority subject to certain safeguards. But this
is as regards the ordinary question[s] of social, economic, and
political importance. It has never been conceded, and can never be
conceded, that a communal majority has a right to dictate to a communal
minority on an issue which is of a constitutional character. That is the
reason why I have provided a separate referendum of non-Muslims only, to
decide whether they prefer to go in[to] Pakistan or come into
Hindustan.</p>
<p>After the Boundary Commission has done its work of delimiting the
areas, various possibilities can arise. The Musalmans may stop with the
delimitation of the boundaries of Pakistan. They may be satisfied that
after all the principle of Pakistan has been accepted—which is what
delimitation means. Assuming that the Musalmans are not satisfied with
mere delimitation, but want to move in the direction of establishing
Pakistan, there are two courses open to them. They may want to establish
Pakistan forthwith, or they may agree to live under a common Central
Government for a period of, say, ten years, and put the Hindus on their
trial. Hindus will have an opportunity to show that the minorities can
trust them. The Muslims will learn from experience how far their fears
of Hindu Raj are justified. There is another possibility also. The
Musalmans of Pakistan, having decided to separate forthwith, may after a
period become so disgusted with Pakistan that they might desire to come
back and be incorporated in Hindustan, and be one people subject to one
single constitution.</p>
<p>These are some of the possibilities I see. These possibilities
should in my judgement be kept open for time and circumstances to have
their effect. It seems to me to be wrong to say to the Musalmans, if you
want to remain as part of India then you can never go out, or if you
want to go then you can never come back. I have in my scheme kept the
door open, and have provided for both the possibilities in the Act: (1)
for union after a separation of ten years, (2) for separation for ten
years and union thereafter. I personally prefer the second alternative,
although I have no strong views either way. It would be much better that
the Musalmans should have the experience of Pakistan. A union after an
experience of Pakistan is bound to be stable and lasting. In case
Pakistan comes into existence forthwith, it seems to me necessary that
the separation should not altogether be a severance, sharp and complete.
It is necessary to maintain live contact between Pakistan and Hindustan,
so as to prevent any estrangement growing up and preventing the chances
of reunion. A Council of India is accordingly provided for in the Act.
It cannot be mistaken for a federation. It is not even a confederation.
Its purpose is to do nothing more than to serve as a coupling to link
Pakistan to Hindustan until they are united under a single constitution.</p>
<p>Such is my scheme. It is based on a community-wise [=by community]
plebiscite. The scheme is flexible. It takes account of the fact that
the Hindu sentiment is against it. It also recognizes the fact that the
Muslim demand for Pakistan may only be a passing mood. The scheme is not
a divorce. It is only a judicial separation. It gives to the Hindus a
term. They can use it to show that they can be trusted with authority to
rule justly. It gives the Musalmans a term to try out Pakistan.</p>
<p>It might be desirable to compare my proposals with those of Sir
Stafford Cripps. The proposals were given out as a serial story in
parts. The draft Declaration issued on 29th March 1943 contained only
the following :—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;His Majesty&rsquo;s Government therefore make the following terms:—</p>
<p>(a) Immediately upon cessation of hostilities steps shall be taken
to set up in India in manner described hereafter an elected body
charged with the task of framing a new constitution for India.</p>
<p>(b) Provision shall be made, as set out below, for participation of
Indian States in the constitution-making body.</p>
<p>(c) His Majesty&rsquo;s Government undertake to accept and implement
forthwith the constitution so framed subject only to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(i) The right of any province of British India that is not
prepared to accept the new constitution to retain its present
constitutional position, provision being made for its subsequent
accession if it so decides.</p></blockquote>
<p>With such non-acceding provinces should they so desire. His Majesty&rsquo;s
Government will be prepared to agree upon a new constitution giving
them the same full status as the Indian Union and arrived at by a
procedure analogous to that here laid down.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Particulars of accession and secession were given in his broadcast.
They were in the following terms :—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;That constitution-making body will have as its object the framing of
a single constitution for the whole of India—that is, of British
India, together with such of the Indian States as may decide to join
in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we realize this very simple fact. If you want to persuade a
number of people who are inclined to be antagonistic to enter the same
room, it is unwise to tell them that once they go in there is no way
out, they are to be forever locked in together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is much wiser to tell them they can go in and if they find they
can&rsquo;t come to a common decision, then there is nothing to prevent
those who wish, from leaving again by another door. They are much more
likely all to go in if they have knowledge that they can by their free
will go out again if they cannot agree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that is what we say to the provinces of India. Come together to
frame a common constitution—if you find after all your discussion and
all the give and take of a constitution-making assembly that you
cannot overcome your differences and that some provinces are still not
satisfied with the constitution, then such provinces can go out and
remain out if they wish and just the same degree of self-government
and freedom will be available for them as for the Union itself, that
is to say complete self-government.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>To complete the picture further details were added at the Press
Conference. Explaining the plan for accession or secession of provinces
Sir Stafford Cripps said :—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If at the end of the Constituent Assembly proceedings, any province
or provinces did not wish to accept the new constitution and join the
Union, it was free to keep out—provided the Provincial Assembly of
that province, by a substantial vote say not less than 60 per cent.,
decided against accession. If it was less than 60 per cent, the
minority could claim a plebiscite of the whole province for
ascertaining the will of the people. In the case of the plebiscite, a
bare majority would be enough. Sir Stafford explained that for
completing accession there would have to be a positive vote from the
Provincial Assembly concerned. The non-acceding province[s] could,
if they wanted, combine into a separate union through a separate
Constituent Assembly, but in order to make such a Union practicable
they should be geographically contiguous.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>The main difference between my plan and that of Sir Stafford Cripps
is quite obvious. For deciding the issue of accession or secession,
which is only another way of saying, will there be or will there not be
Pakistan, Sir Stafford Cripps took the Province as a deciding unit. I
have taken community as the deciding unit. I have no doubt that Sir
Stafford adopted a wrong basis. The Province can [=could] be a proper
unit if the points of dispute were interprovincial. For instance, if the
points of dispute related to questions such as distribution of taxation,
of water, etc., one could understand the Province as a whole or a
particular majority in that Province having the right to decide. But the
dispute regarding Pakistan is an inter-communal problem which has
involved two communities in the same Province. Further, the issue in the
dispute is not on what terms the two communities will agree to associate
in a common political life. The dispute goes deeper, and raises the
question [of] whether the communities are prepared at all to associate
in a common political life. It is a communal difference in its essence,
and can only be decided by a community-wise plebiscite.</p>
<p>IV<br>
[My solution is borne out by the examination of similar cases
elsewhere]</p>
<p>I do not claim any originality for the solution I have proposed. The
ideas which underlie it are drawn from three sources, from the Irish
Unity Conference at which Horace Plunket presided, from the Home Rule
Amending Bill of Mr. Asquith, and from the Government of Ireland Act of
1920. It will be seen that my solution of the Pakistan problem is the
result of pooled wisdom. Will it be accepted? There are four ways of
resolving the conflict which is raging round the question of Pakistan.
First is that the British Government should act as the deciding
authority. Second is that the Hindus and the Muslims should agree. Third
is to submit the issue to an International Board of Arbitration; and the
fourth is to fight it out by a Civil War.</p>
<p>Although India today is a political mad-house there are, I hope,
enough sane people in the country who would not allow matters to reach
the stage of Civil War. There is no prospect of an agreement between
political leaders in the near future. The A.I.C.C. of the Indian
National Congress, at a meeting in Allahabad held in April 1942, on the
motion of Mr. Jagat Narayan Lal resolved**<a href="#n01">/1/</a>** not to entertain
the proposal for Pakistan. Two other ways are left to have the problem
solved. One is by the people concerned; the other is by international
arbitration. This [=the former] is the way I have suggested. I prefer
the former. For various reasons this seems to me the only right course.
The leaders having failed to resolve the dispute, it is time it was
taken to the people for decision. Indeed, it is inconceivable how an
issue like that of partition of territory and transference of peoples&rsquo;
allegiance from one government to another can be decided by political
leaders. Such things are no doubt done by conquerors, to whom victory in
war is sufficient authority to do what they like with the conquered
people. But we are not working under such a lawless condition. In normal
times, when constitutional procedure is not in abeyance, the views of
political leaders cannot have the effect which the <em>fiat</em>s of dictators
have. That would be contrary to the rule of democracy. The highest value
that can be put upon the views of leaders is to regard them as worthy to
be placed on the agenda. They cannot replace or obviate the necessity of
having the matter decided by the people. This is the position which was
taken by Sir Stafford Cripps. The stand taken by the Muslim League was,
let there be Pakistan because the Muslim League has decided to have it.
That position has been negatived by the Cripps proposals, and quite
rightly. The Muslim League is recognized by the Cripps proposals only to
the extent of having a right to propose that Pakistan as a proposition
be considered. It has not been given the right to decide. Again it does
not seem to have been realized that the decision of an All-India body
like the Congress which does not carry with it the active consent of the
majority of the people immediately affected by the issue of Pakistan,
cannot carry the matter to solution. What good can it do if Mr. Gandhi
or Mr. Rajagopalachariar agreeing [=agree], or the All-India Congress
Committee resolving [=resolve], to concede Pakistan, if it was opposed
by the Hindus of the Punjab, or Bengal? Really speaking it is not the
business of the people of Bombay or Madras to say, &ldquo;let there be
Pakistan.&rdquo; It must be left to be decided by the people who are living in
those areas and who will have to bear the consequences of so violent, so
revolutionary, and so fundamental a change in the political and economic
system with which their lives and fortunes have been closely bound up
for so many years. A referendum by people in the Pakistan Provinces
seems to me the safest and the most constitutional method of solving the
problem of Pakistan.</p>
<p>But I fear that solving the question of Pakistan by a referendum of
the people, howsoever attractive, may not find much favour with those
who count. Even the Muslim League may not be very enthusiastic about it.
This is not because the proposal is unsound. Quite the contrary. The
fact is that there is another solution which has its own attractions. It
calls upon the British Government to establish Pakistan by the exercise
of its sovereign authority. The reason why this solution may be
preferred to that which rests on the consent of the people is that it is
simple, and involves no such elaborate procedure as that of a referendum
to the people, and has none of the uncertainties involved in a
referendum. But there is another ground why it is preferred, namely,
that there is a precedent for it. The precedent is the Irish precedent,
and the argument is that if the British Government by virtue of its
sovereign authority divided Ireland and created Ulster, why cannot the
British Government divide India and create Pakistan?</p>
<p>The British Parliament is the most sovereign legislative body in the
world. De L&rsquo;home, a French writer on [the] English Constitution,
observed that there is nothing the British Parliament cannot do except
make man a woman and woman a man. And although the sovereignty of the
British Parliament over the affairs of the Dominions is limited by the
Statute of Westminster, it is still unlimited so far as India is
concerned. There is nothing in law to prevent the British Parliament
from proceeding to divide India as it did in the case of Ireland. It can
do it, but will it do it? The question is not one of power but of will.</p>
<p>Those who urge the British Government to follow the precedent in
Ireland should ask what led the British Government to partition Ireland.
Was it the conscience of the British Government which led them to
sanction the course they took, or was it forced upon them by
circumstances to which they had to yield? A student of the history of
Irish Home Rule will have to admit that the partition of Ireland was not
sanctioned by conscience but by the force of circumstances. It is not
often clearly realized that no party to the Irish dispute wanted
partition of Ireland. Not even Carson, the Leader of Ulster. Carson was
opposed to Home Rule, but he was not in favour of partition. His primary
position was to oppose Home Rule and maintain the integrity of Ireland.
It was only as a second line of defence against the imposition of Home
Rule that he insisted on partition. This will be quite clear from his
speeches both inside and outside the House of Commons. Asquith&rsquo;s
Government on the other side was equally opposed to partition. This may
be seen from the proceedings in the House of Commons over the Irish Home
Rule Bill of 1912. Twice amendments were moved for the exclusion of
Ulster from the provisions of the Bill, once in the Committee stage by
Mr. Agar-Roberts, and again on the third reading by Carson himself. Both
the times the Government opposed, and the amendments were lost.</p>
<p>Permanent partition of Ireland was effected in 1920 by Mr. Lloyd
George in his Government of Ireland Act. Many people think that this was
the first time that partition of Ireland was thought of, and that it was
due to the dictation of the Conservative—Unionists in the Coalition
Government of which Mr. Lloyd George was the nominal head. It may be
true that Mr. Lloyd George succumbed to the influence of the predominant
party in his coalition. But it is not true that partition was thought of
in 1920 for the first time. Nor is it true that the Liberal Party had
not undergone a change and shown its readiness to favour partition as a
possible solution. As a matter of fact, partition as a solution came in
1914, six years before Mr. Lloyd George&rsquo;s Act ,when the Asquith
Government, a purely Liberal Government, was in office. The real cause
which led to the partition of Ireland can be understood only by
examining the factors which made the Liberal Government of Mr. Asquith
change its mind. I feel certain that the factor which brought about this
change in the viewpoint of the Liberal Government was the military
crisis which took place in March 1914 and which is generally referred to
as the &ldquo;Curragh Incident.&rdquo; A few facts will be sufficient to explain
what the &ldquo;Curragh Incident&rdquo; was, and how decisive it was in bringing
about a change in the policy of the Asquith Government.</p>
<p>To begin at a convenient point, the Irish Home Rule Bill had gone
through all its stages by the end of 1913. Mr. Asquith, who had been
challenged that he was proceeding without a mandate from the electorate,
had however given an undertaking that the Act would not be given effect
to until another general election had been held. In the ordinary course
there would have been a general election in 1915, if the War had not
supervened. But the Ulstermen were not prepared to take their chance in
a general election, and started taking active steps to oppose Home Rule.
They were not always very scrupulous in choosing their means and their
methods, and under the seductive pose that they were fighting against
the Government which was preventing them from remaining loyal subjects
of the King, they resorted to means which nobody would hesitate to call
shameless and nefarious. There was one Maginot Line on which the
Ulstermen always depended for defeating Home Rule. That was the House of
Lords. But by the Parliament Act of 1911 the House of Lords had become a
Wailing Wall, neither strong nor high. It had ceased to be a line of
defence to rely upon. Knowing that the Bill might pass notwithstanding
its rejection by the House of Lords, feeling that in the next election
Asquith might win, the Ulstermen had become desperate and were searching
for another line of defence. They found it in the Army. The plan was
twofold. It included the project of getting the House of Lords to hold
up the Annual Army Act so as to ensure that there would be no Army in
existence to be used against Ulster. The second project was to spread
their propaganda—That Home Rule will be Home Rule—in the Army with a
view to preparing the Army to disobey the Government in case Government
decided to use the Army for forcing Home Rule on Ireland. The first
became unnecessary as they succeeded easily in bringing about the
second. This became clear in March 1914 when there occurred the Curragh
Incident. The Government had reasons to suspect that certain Army depots
in Ireland were likely to be raided by the Unionist Volunteers. On March
20th, orders were sent to Sir Arthur Paget, Commander-in-Chief of the
Forces in Ireland, to take steps to safeguard these depols. His reply
was a telegram to the effect that officers were not prepared to obey and
were resigning their commissions, and it was feared that men would
refuse to move. General Sir Hubert Gough had refused to serve against
the Ulster Unionists, and his example had been followed by others. The
Government realized that the Army had become political,<strong><a href="#n02">/2/</a></strong>
nay, partisan. It took fright and decided in favour of partition, acting
on the well-known maxim that wisdom is the better part of valour. What
made Asquith change his position was not conscience but the fright
[=fear] of the Army rebelling. The fright was so great that no one
thereafter felt bold enough to challenge the Army and enforce Home Rule
without partition.</p>
<p>Can His Majesty&rsquo;s Government be depended upon to repeat in India
what it did in Ireland? I am unable to answer the question. But two
things I will say. The first thing is that His Majesty&rsquo;s Government
knows full well what have been the consequences of this partition of
Ireland. The Irish Free State has become the most irreconcilable enemy
of Great Britain. The enmity knows no limits. The wound caused by
partition will never be healed so long as partition remains a settled
fact. The Partition of Ireland cannot but be said to be morally
indefensible, inasmuch as it was the result not of the consent of the
people but of superior force. It was as bad as the murder of Duncan by
Macbeth. The bloodstains left on His Majesty&rsquo;s Government are as deep as
those on Lady Macbeth, and of which Lady Macbeth said that &ldquo;All the
perfumes of Arabia&rdquo; had failed to remove the stink. That His Majesty&rsquo;s
Government does not like to be responsible for the execution of another
deed of partition is quite clear from its policy with the Jew-Arab
problem in Palestine. It appointed the Peel Commission to investigate.
The Commission recommended partition of Palestine. The Government
accepted**<a href="#n03">/3/</a>** it in principle as the most hopeful line of
solving the deadlock. Suddenly the Government realized the gravity of
forcing such a solution on the Arabs and appointed another Royal
Commission called the Woodhead Commission, which condemned partition and
opened an easy way to a Government which was anxious to extricate itself
from a terrible position. The partition of Ireland is not a precedent
worthy to be followed. It is an ugly incident which requires to be
avoided. It is a warning and not an example. I doubt very much if His
Majesty&rsquo;s Government will partition India on its own authority at the
behest of the Muslim League.</p>
<p>And why should His Majesty&rsquo;s Government oblige the Muslim League? In
the case of Ulster there was the tie of blood which made a powerful
section of the British politicians take the side of Ulster. It was this
tie of blood which made Lord Curzon say &ldquo;You are compelling Ulster to
divorce her present husband, to whom she is not unfaithful, and you are
compelling her to marry someone else whom she cordially dislikes, with
whom she does not want to live.&rdquo; There is no such kinship between His
Majesty&rsquo;s Government and the Muslim League, and it would be a vain hope
for the League to expect His Majesty&rsquo;s Government to take her side.</p>
<p>The other thing I would like to say is that it would not be in the
interests of the Muslim League to achieve its object by invoking the
authority of His Majesty&rsquo;s Government to bring about the partition of
India. In my judgement, more important than getting Pakistan is the
procedure to be adopted in bringing about Pakistan, if the object is
that after partition Pakistan and Hindustan should continue as two
friendly States with goodwill and no malice towards each other.</p>
<p>What is the procedure which is best suited for the realization of
this end? Everyone will agree that the procedure must be such that it
must not involve victory to one community and humiliation to the other.
The method must be of peace with honour to both sides. I do not know if
there is another solution better calculated to achieve this end than the
decision by a referendum of the people. I have made my suggestion as to
which is the best course. Others also will come forth with theirs. I
cannot say that mine is the best. But whatever the suggestion be, unless
good sense as well as a sense of responsibility is brought to bear upon
the solution of this question, it will remain a festering sore.</p>
<p>======================</p>
<p><strong><a href="#m01">/1/</a></strong> The text of the resolution is as follows :—&ldquo;The A. I. C.
C. is of opinion that any proposal to disintegrate India by giving
liberty to any component State or territorial unit to secede from the
Indian Union or Federation will be highly detrimental to the best
interests of the people of the States and Provinces and the country as a
whole and the Congress, therefore, cannot agree to any such proposal.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong><a href="#m02">/2/</a></strong> On this point see <strong>Life of Field-Marshal Sir Henry
Wilson</strong> by Major General Sir C. E.Callwell, Vol. 1., Chapter IX; also
<strong>Parliamentary Debates</strong> (House of Lords), 1914, Vol. 15, pp. 998-1017,
on Ulster and the Army. This shows that the Army had been won over by
the Ulsterites long before the Curragh Incident. It is possible that Mr.
Asquith decided in 1913 to bring in an Amending Bill to exclude Ulster
from Home Rule for six years because he had become aware that the Army
had gone over to Ulster and that it could not be used for enforcing Home
Rule.</p>
