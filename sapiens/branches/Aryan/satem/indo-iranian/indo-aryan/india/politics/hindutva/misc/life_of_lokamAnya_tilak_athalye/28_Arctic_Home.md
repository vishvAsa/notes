Up to the middle of the 19th century, myths and 
traditions were the only materials available for the 
study of pre-historic man. So various attempts were 
made to systematise these myths and explain them ra- 
tionally. But the mythologists carried on their re- 
searches at a time when man was believed to be post- 
glacial and when the physical and geographical sur- 
roundings of the ancient man were assumed not to have 
been materially different from those of the present day. 
But about the middle of the igth century, from hund- 
reds of stone and bronze implements found buried in 
various places in Europe, the archaeologists established 
the chronological sequence of the Iron, the Bronze and 
the Stone age in times preceding the historic period and 
discovered evidence to prove the existence of the Gla- 
cial period at the close of the Quarternary era and the 
high antiquity of man who was shown to have lived not 
only throughout the Quarternary but also in the Ter- 
tiary era when the climatic conditions of the globe were 
quite different from those in the present or Post-Glacial 
period. It, therefore, became evident that the results 
previously arrived at by philologists and mythologists 
must be revised in the hght of new scientific discoveries. 
It also became necessary to study the ancient 
sacred books of the Aryans in the light of modern

archaeological and geological discoveries ; for if 
man existed before the last Glacial period and witness- 
ed the gigantic change which brought on the Ice 
age, it is not unnatural to expect that a reference, howso 
ever concealed and distant, to these events would be found 
in the oldest traditionary beliefs and memories of man- 
kind. If we read some of the passages in the Vedas, 
which have hitherto been considered incomprehensible, 
in the light of the new scientific discoveries, we arc 
forced to the conclusion that the home of the ancestors 
of the Vedic people was somewhere near the North 
Pole before the last Glacial epoch. 

Before proceeding to discuss the Vedic texts which 
point to a Polar Home, it is necessary to briefly state 
the results of recent discoveries in archaeology, geology 
and palaeontology. Human races of earlier times have 
left ample evidence of their existence on the surface of 
this globe. It consists of hundreds and thousands of 
rude or polished instruments of stone and metal, recent- 
ly dug out from old camps, fortifications, burial-grounds, 
temples etc. Archaeologists have come to the conclu- 
sion that these implements can be classified into those 
of stone, those of bronze and those of iron, representing 
three different stages of civilisation in the progress of 
man in pre-historic times. Of these three different ages, 
the oldest or the Stone age is further divided into the 
Palaeolithic and the Neolithic period or the old and the 
new Stone age. 

The Geologist takes up the history of the earth at the 
point where the archaeologist leaves it and carries it 
further back into antiquity. From an examination cf 
the stratified rocks, according to the character of the 



39® LOKAMANYA TIL4K 

fossils found in them, the geologist has divided the 
history of our planet into five different periods. 

The Iron age, the Bronze age and the Neolothic age 
come under the Recent or the Post-Glacial period while 
the Palaeolithic age is supposed to fall in the Pleisto- 
cene period. Various estimates have been made re- 
garding the time of the commencement of the Neolithic 
age but the oldest date assigned does not exceed 5000 
B.C. Regarding the commencement of the Palaeolo- 
thic period, there are two different views entertained 
by the geologists, Prof. Geikie putting it between 50 to 
60 thousand years ago and the American geologists at 
about 8000 years only. 

As regards the races which inhabited Europe in these 
early ages, the evidence furnished by human remains or 
skulls shows that they were the direct ancestors of the 
races now living in the different parts of Europe. The 
question, whether the Aryans were autochthonous or 
went to Europe from some other place cannot be settled 
by these discoveries. But the Vedic and Avestic evidence 
proves that the Aryans were autochthonous neither in 
Europe nor in Central Asia but had their original home 
somewhere near the North Pole in the Palaeolithic 
times and that they migrated from this place south- 
wards in Asia and Europe, not by any " irresisti- 
ble impulse " but by unwelcome changes in the climatic 
conditions of their original home. From the geological 
evidence of fossil, fauna and flora, we find that in the 
early geological ages when the Alps were low and the 
Himalayas not yet upheaved and when Asia and Africa 
were represented by only a group of islands, an 
equable and uniform climate prevailed over the 



APPENDIX B 391 

whole surface of the globe. A luxuriant forest 
vegetation, which can only grow and exist at present 
in the tropical or temperate clirpate, flourished in 
the high altitude of Spitzbergen, where the sun goes 
below the horizon from November till March, thus 
showing that a warm climate prevailed in the Arctic 
regions in those days. If, therefore, the Vedic evidence 
points to an Arctic Home where the ancestors of the 
Vedic Rishis lived in ancient times, there is nothing 
in the latest scientific discoveries which would 
warrant us in considering this result as a priori impro- 
bable. 

It has been a fashion to speak of the Polar regions as 
characterised by light and darkness of six months each ; 
but this statement is only roughly true. The Pole is 
merely a point and all the inhabitants of the original 
ancient Home, if there was one near the North Pole, 
could not have lived precisely at this single point. We 
must, therefore, distinguish between the characterestics 
of the Polar region and those of the circum-polar region. 

THE POLAR CHARACTERESTICS. 

(i) The Sun rises in the South. 

(2) The stars do not rise and set ; but revolve or spin 
round and round, in horizontal planes, completing one 
round in 24 hours. 

(3) The year consists only of one long day and one 
long night of six months each, 

(4) There is only one morning and one evening. But 
the twilight, whether of the morning or of the evening, 
lasts continuously for about two months. The ruddy 
light of the morn or the evening twilight moves round 
and round along the horizon, like a potter's wheel. 



392 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

THE CIRCUM-POLAR CHARACTERESTICS. 

(i) The Sun will always be to the South of the Zenith 
of the observer. 

(2) A large number of stars are circum-polar ; the 
rest rise and set, but revolve in more oblique circles. 

(3) The year is made up of three parts : — (a) one long 
continuous night lasting for a period of greater than 24 
hours and less than six months according to the lati- 
tude of the place (h) one long continuous day to match 
ic) a succession of ordinary days and nights during the 
rest of the year, never exceeding a period of 24 hours. 

(4) The dawn, at the close of the long continuous 
night, lasts for several days but its duration and magni- 
iicance is proportionally less than at the North Pole. 
The other dawns will only last for a few hours. 

We can take these differentae as our unerring guides 
in the examination of the Vedic evidence bearing on the 
point at issue . If a Vedic description or tradition dis- 
closes any of the characterestics mentioned above, we 
may safely infer that the tradition is Polar or circum- 
Polar in origin, and the phenomenon, if not actually 
witnessed by the poet, was at least known to him by 
tradition, faithfully handed down from generation to 
generation. Such references in the Vedic literature 
may be divided into two parts : the first comprising 
those passages which directly refer to the long night or 
the long dawn and the second consisting of myths or 
legends which corroborate and indirectly support the 
first. 

We find passages in the Rig-veda (X, 89, 4. II, 15.2. 
IV, 56, 3 X, 89, 2) which compare the motion of the 
heavens to that of a wheel and state that the celestial 



APPENDIX B 393 

Vault is supported as if on an axis. Combining these 
two statements, we may safely infer that the motion 
referred to is such a motion of the celestial hemisphere 
as can be witnessed only by an observer at the North 
Pole. 

Let us now turn to another characterestic of the 
Polar regions viz a day and a night of six months each 
and examine references to this characterestic, reference 
to which is found not only in the Puranas but also in 
astronomical works. Surya-Siddhanta (XII, 67) says 
" At Meru, Gods behold the sun after but a single 
rising during the half of his revolution beginning with 
Aries." Manu describing the divisions of time says 
(I, 67) " A year (human) is a day and a night of the 
gods." In Chapters 163 and 164 of the Vanaparvam 
(Mahabharat), Arjuna's \dsit to mount Meru is described 
in detail and we are therein told " At Meru the sun and 
the moon go round from left to right every day and so 
<io all the stars " Later on, the writer says " The moun- 
tain by its lustre, so overcomes the darkness of night, 
that the night can hardly be distinguished from the 
day." A few verses further, and we find, " The day 
and the night are together equal to a year to the resi- 
dents of the place." Evidently, the writer had a tole- 
rably correct idea of the meteorological and astronomi- 
-cal characterestics of the North Pole. The lustre of the 
mountain is the splendour of the Aurora Borealis visible 
at the North Pole. Passing from the Post Vedic literature 
to the Vedic we find in the Taittiraya Brahmana (III, 9 
22, i) " That which is a year is but a single day of the 
Gods." It is true that the statement, or anything similar 
to it is not found in the Samhita portion of the Rigveda^ 

But there are many other passages which go to corro- 
borate this statement in a remarkable way. 

The long continuous dawn with its revolving splen- 
dours is another characterestic of the North Pole. The 
Vedic poets could not have gone into raptures over the 
short-lived dawn of the tropical or temperate zone. In the 
Aitareya Brahmana IV, 7, a long recitation of not less 
than a thousand verses is to be recited by the Hotri priest 
"when the darkness of the night is about to be relieved 
by the light of the dawn." So there must have been 
in those days, sufficient time between the first appear- 
ance of light and the rise of the sun, to recite the long 
song. Sometimes the recitation ended long before sun- 
rise and in that case other hymns are required to be 
continued, and Apa Stamb requires all the ten 
mandalas of the Rigvedas to be recited if necessary. 
In Rigveda VII. 76 the poet expressly tells us 
that a period of several days elapsed between the first 
appearance of the dawn and the actual rising of the 
sun, and the commentator, Sayana, not under- 
standing how the words " day " can be applied to a 
period of time anterior to sunrise, twists the meaning 
of the " Ahan " and translates it by " splendour." 
Similarly in Rig. II. 28-9 the words bhuyasih ushasah 
avyushtah which literally mean " many dawns have 
not dawned or fully flashed forth " have been a riddle 
to the commentators. These dawns were thirty in 
number (Taittiriya Samhita IV. 3. 11). Sayana, 
unable to account for so many dawns explains that 
though the dawn was one yet by its Yogic powers, it 
assumed these various shapes ! 

When the long duration of the Vedic dawn is once 



APPENDIX B 395 

demonstrated, it astronomically follows that long days 
and long nights existed in those times. Let us, how- 
ever, try to find independent evidence of their existence. 
There are many passages in the Rig- Veda that speak of 
long and ghastly darkness in one form or other. Thus 
in I, 32, 10 Vritra, the traditional enemy of Indra, is 
said to be engulfed in long darkness. In V, 32, 5, Indra 
is described as having placed Shushna, who was anxious 
to fight in " the darkness of the pit." The next verse 
speaks of Sunless (ghastly) darkness. These expres- 
sions lose all their propriety, if the darkness, in which 
the enemies of Indra are said to have flourished, be 
taken to be ordinary darkness of twelve, or at best, of 
twenty-four hours' duration. It was in reality a long 
one. 

In the loth Mandala of the Rig- Veda we have a hymn 
(127) in which Night is invoked to " become easily 
fordable." In the Parishishta, which follows this 
hymn the worshipper addresses the Night " May we 
reach the other side in safety ! May we reach the other 
side in safety." In the Atharva-Veda, XIX, 47, the 
second verse runs thus " Each moving thing finds rest 
in her (Night) whose yonder boundary, is not seen, nor 
that which keeps her separate " In the Taittiriya Sam- 
hita I, 5, 5, 4, we have a similar prayer addressed to 
the Night and a little later I, 5, 7, 5, the Samhita itself 
explains the prayer thus " In old times the Brahmans 
were afraid that it (night) would not dawn." What 
does this signify ? If the night was not unusually long, 
where was the necessity for entertaining any misgivings 
about the coming dawn ?" 

Ill, 55, II literally translated means : — " The twin 

pair (females) make many forms ; of the two one shines 
and the other is dark. Two sisters are they, the dark and 
the bright." We have here a two-fold description of 
the couple (Day and Night). It is called the shining 
and the dark and also is described as possessed of many 
forms. Say ana interprets these forms as different 
colours like black, white etc. This is evidently 
wrong. Are we to suppose that we may have 
sometimes green, violet, yellow or blue days and 
nights ? Again though mpa may lend itself to 
this interpretation, the word used in the above 
verse, Vapumshi cannot be so understood. It 
can only denote the extent, duration and length of days 
and nights, in addition to their colour, which can be 
only twofold, dark or bright. The first half of the 
verse, therefore, means, " The twin pair assume various 
(nana) lengths (Vapumshi) ; of the two one shines and the 
other is dark. The third quarter of the verse " Two 
sisters are they, the dark (Shyavi) and the bright 
(arushi)" has puzzled the commentators but they have 
solved the riddle by regarding the twins (yamya) and 
the sisters (svasaran) as identical. But this is wrong. 
The only possible explanation is that the year spoken 
of in the passage is a circum-PoIar year made up of one 
long day and one long night, forming one pair and a 
number of ordinary days and nights of various lengths 
which can be described as " bright, dark and of varying 
lengths." 

In X, 138, 3, the third verse begins with " The Sun 
unyoked his car in the midst of heaven," not at sunset 
or on the horizon but in the midst of heaven. The 
words are quite clear. Mr. Griffith tries to explain this 



APPENDIX B 397 

difficulty by thinking that the poet here refers to an 
eclipse. But during an eclipse, the sun is covered with ♦ 
the dark shadow of the earth and is not besides sta- 
tionary. Sayana twists the meaning. But we need 
not be impatient to escape from the natural meaning 
of the verse. A long halt of the sun in the midst of 
the heaven is clearly described here and it refers to the 
long day of the Arctic region. 

In the Samhita and the Brahmanas, the annual 
sattras, or yearly sacrificial sessions, are said to extend 
over twelve months. But this was impossible within 
the Arctic region, where the sun goes below the horizon 
for a number of months during the year, thereby pro- 
ducing the long night. The oldest duration of the 
annual sattras, if such were ever performed within the 
Polar regions, would therefore be shorter than twelve 
months. In other words, an annual sattra of less than 
twelve months would be the chief distinguishing mark 
of the older sacrificial system. As all the people can- 
not be expected to be stationed at the Pole, the months 
of sunshine will vary from seven to eleven for the inha- 
bitants of the Arctic region ; and the Arctic sacrificial 
year, would be made up of these months of sunshine. 
Let us now interpret the legend of Aditi or the seven 
Adityas (Suns). This legend expressly tells us that the 
oldest number of Adityas is seven. The sun is called 
seven horsed and in V, 45, 9 and his seven wheeled 
chariot is said to be drawn by seven bay steeds (I, 50, 8). 
The Atharva-Veda speaks of the " seven bright rays of 
the Sun (VII, 107, i). Sayana is unable to account for 
the number seven as applied to the rays. The cue to 
understand the legend can be had from Shatapatha 



398 LOKAMANYA TII^K 

Brahmana which says " There are twelve months of 
the year ; these are the Adityas.'* It therefore the 
twelve Adityas represent the twelve months of the year, 
the seven Adityas must have once (purvyam yugam) 
represented the seven months of the year. The legend 
of the Dashagvas or Dirghatamas points to the existence 
of an year of ten months ; and as these cannot be ac- 
counted for except on the Arctic theory, the chain of 
evidence is strengthened by these legends. 

The sacrificial literature also helps us in arriving at 
the same hypothesis. Once in the Aitaraya Brahmana 
and twice in the Taittiriya Samhita, we meet with des- 
criptions regarding the Gavam-Ayanam, or the " cows' 
walk " wherein cows are represented as holding a sacri- 
ficial session. This session could be completed in 10 or 
12 months. Why the session could be completed in 10 
months seems to have puzzled Sayana and others, who 
merely content themselves with remarking that it is 
an " immemorial customs." The Arctic theory throws 
quite a new light on this tradition. Tlie Gavam-ayanam 
of ten months and the old Roman year of ten months 
are relics of the period when the Aryans lived within 
the circumpolar regions. The * cows ' were not really 
cows, but the Adityas (month-gods). 

If we turn to Vedic mythology, we find several stories, 
which cannot be properly explained either on the Dawn 
or Storm theory. The description of Indra's fight with 
Vritra records four simultaneous effects (i) the release 
of the cows (2) the release of the waters (3) the produc- 
tion of the dawn and (4) the production of the 
Sun. Advocates of the Storm theory describe 
Vrita as a storm-cloud and by smiting it with his 



APPENDIX B 399 

thunder- bolt, Indra may be described as releasing the 
waters imprisoned therein. But where are the cows 
which are said to be released along with the waters. 
The Niruktas interpret cows to mean Waters ; but in 
that case the release of the waters and the release of 
the cows are not two distinct effects. 

The struggle between Indra and Vritra is really a 
struggle between the powers of light and darkness. The 
passages where waters are said to be released by Indra 
after kilhng Vritra do not refer expressly to the rain- 
cloud. Vedic scholars have wrongly supposed that when 
the Rig- Veda speaks of the celestial waters (divyah apah) 
only the rain-waters are intended. But this is a mis- 
take ; for in passages which speak of the creation of the 
world (X, 82, 6 ; 129, 3) the world is said to have once 
consisted of nothing but undifferentiated waters, — or 
in the language of modem scientists of ' ether ' or 
* nebulous mass of matter.' The ancient Aryans like 
the old Hebrews believed that the subtle matter which 
filled the whole space in the universe was nothing but 
watery Vapours ; and secondly that the movements of 
the Sun, the moon and other heavenly bodies were 
caused by these Vapours which kept on constantly cir- 
culating from the neither to the upper and from the 
Upper to the lower celestial hemisphere. The mischief 
wrought by Vritra was that he stopped the flow of these 
waters ; consequently the Sun, the moon, the stars all 
ceased to rise. Indra by killing Vritra released the 
waters and brought with them the dawn, the Sun, and 
the cows (i.e., days or the rays of the morning). The 
victory is thus naturally described as four-fold . Ob- 
jectors to this theory might say that the struggle 



400 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

between Indra and Vritra is a daily fight between light 
and darkness. But X, 62, 2 shows that the struggle 
was annual. This proves the Arctic Home hypo- 
thesis. 

The Avesta contains two passages (first two Far-^ 
gards) which also point to this theory. The first 
Fargard (chapter) of the Vendidad enumerates 16 lands 
created by Ahura Mazda. As soon as each land was^ 
created Angra Mainyu, the evil spirit created different 
evils and plagues to invade the land and make it unfit 
for human habitation. Out of these 16 lands 10 can 
be still identified with certainty. This proves that 
the account is real and not mythological. The Airyana 
Vaejo is described as the first good and happy creation 
of Ahura Mazda but Angra Mainyu converted it into 
a land of ten months winter and two months summer. 
This sudden change in the climate of the Airyana Valjo, 
converting ten months summer and two months winter 
into ten months severe winter and two months cold 
summer was clearly due to the advent of the Glacial 
period as established by modern geologists. The 
second Fargard of the Vendidad' gives us a graphic des- 
cription of the actual advent of ice and snow. It also 
informs us that a Vara or enclosure was made to pro- 
vide against the calamity and that in this Vara, the sun, 
the moon and the stars rose but once a year. 

The cumulative weight of these and other researches 
incontrovertibly establishes Mr. Tilak's theoiy.
