(Father of Dravidianism, the dangerous 18th century christian missionary Robert Caldwell describes about Travancore in one of his satirical poems (mocks as Coconutcore). He says it was a prosperous 'model state', where 'Brahminical superiority' prevailed & as heaven on earth. GAMMON Row refers to mAdhav rAv.)



WHO has not heard of that wonderful man,  
SIR GAMMON Row, the great Dewan,  
Who has ruled for the last ten years, or more,  
The Protected State of Cocoanutcore ?  
This State, if judged from "Reports" you read,   
Is a very wonderful State indeed;  
A "Model State," in which you may see  
Every thing is just as it should be. 

Where dwells a worthy and well-oil'd nation,  
Blest with a faultless administration;  
The brightest land, with the lightest tax,  
And an annual surplus of fifty lacs :  
Where happy ryots, ne'er pester'd by famines,  
Till fields, in subjection to blessed Brahmins. 

A land of peace, a land of delight,  
Where everyone, everywhere, always does right.  
Where whitemen, living in meek minority,  
Acknowledge Brahminical superiority. 

In short, and I'm sure I cannot say more,  
"Tis a heaven upon earth, this Cocoanutcore !

And in this terrestrial elysium the man  
Who is most like an angel is the Dewan  
From Comorin's foam to Himmaleh's snows  
A man that's his match sure nobody knows  
In his gay free mien and his honied laugh  
He is perfect yes almost too perfect by half  
How courtly his bow his smile how sweet  
And how soft is the tread of his cat like feet  
Then how frank his look you might think you could view  
The soul through the eye of this good Hindoo  
How chaste his manners his English how choice  
How liquid how mellow the tones of his voice  
His whole demeanour seems to import  
That doing good is his one great forte  
But since tis beyond the powers of my pen  
To pourtray as I should this most perfect of men  
I'll relate instead a remarkable story  
Which will picture Sir Gammon in all his glory  
His goodness the justice he loves and the claim  
His deeds have to noto - I mean to fame

In the heart of the country of Cocoanutcore  
Lies the Brahmin city of Brahminipore.  
Though you search'd through India up and down,  
You could never discover a holier town. 

For the blessed Twice-born, who chance to live there,  
By deigning to breathe it, have hallowed the air -  
The houses are holy, and holy each street,  
And even the dust has been blessed by their feet. 

Each pot in each hut, of brass or of clay,  
Has been sanctified in some wonderful way.  
And the sacred carpets in every house  
Are the daily gift of Brahminical cows !

A blessed brahmin named Rowdy Row  
Once lived in this city He lives there now  
A man whose success in life was complete  
He had the best house in the very best street  
He throve well on ghee he was worth I am told  
A couple of lacs in lands and gold.  
His youngest wife sweet BetelammAl  
Was rich and fair and for thirteen tall  
As his morals were so so but rigid his creed  
Men thought him a very good Brahmin indeed  
He said long mantras he strictly kept caste  
Each pariah slunk from the road till he passed  
Nothing was strange about his person  
You might see a better you might see a worse  
In short our Rowdy was happy and bore  
A very good name in Brahminipore. 

Now Ichabod Green a Quaker one day  
Happened to travel along that way  
A harmless soul with a fat little frame  
Along the street he leisurely came  
At the very first glance could be easily seen  
What sort of person was Mr Green 

In his mild meek eyes his heart you could trace  
And PEACE was writ on his placid face  
On he sauntered not thinking his feet  
Would defile the mud of that sacred street  
A street that seemed public to beast and to man  
For right along it the highway ran  
So on he came and came at last  
To Rowdy Row's house and would have passed

(He goes on to describe fate of a Britisher who defiled the Brahmin street with his presence. The local Brahmin beats up the britisher for defilement, calls him 'white cow eater' who defiled the sacred land.)

But the holy Brahmin rushed forth with a shout,  
"You white cow-eater, get out, get out!  
Go back! Quick ! Run! your low caste feet  
Will defile the mud of this sacred street !"  
But since poor Green, with a startled stare,  
Said; "Sir, I thought this a thoroughfare."  
The righteous Brahmin gave him a kick,  
And knocked him about the head with a stick.  
Then while his applauding friends drew round,  
He kicked him again as he lay on the ground.  
He gave him a whack, he gave him a crack,  
He smack'd his face, and sat on his back.  
He thump'd him, he bump'd him, he tugged at his hair,  
He tumbled him here, he pummelled him there.  
He used his slipper, he used his fist,  
Gave a tweak to his nose, to his ear a twist;  
He laughed as he heard poor Ichabod's cries,  
And filled with sand poor Ichabod's eyes.  
Then set him again on his tottering feet,  
And hooted him out of the sacred street.

With many a moan with many a groan  
Poor Ichabod trudged on his way alone  
For his servants when they beheld the fray  
Had one and all skedaddled away.

That night on the road poor Ichabod spent  
Next day to the Dewan Peischar went  
Stated his case where when and how  
He had got such a thrashing from Rowdy Row  
And showed as witness his tattered clothes  
His blackened eyes and his damaged nose  
Now when the Peishcar with solemn face  
Had gone right through this remarkable case  

To his chief the Dewan for sentence due  
He sent Mr Green and Rowdy too  
Sir Gammon Row with his grandest bow  
Received Mr Green and Rowdy Row  
Mr Green had a chair but I really think  
He gave friend Rowdy a nod and a wink  
Then he read through the case and as he read  
Adjusted the turban upon his head  
Now turned his eyes up now turned his eyes down  
Now smiled a sweet smile now frown'd a stern frown  
Now sighed now his head sagaciously shook  
And look'd in short as wise as a book  
Then after many a hum and haw  
Summ'd up and thus declared the law  

You Mr Green were very wrong  
In daring that street to venture along  
You ought to have known that your low caste feet  
Would defile the mud of that sacred street  
As a neecha jathi karan you  
Should render the Brahmins reverence due  
For all know that Brahmins in every place  
Are a quiet peaceful respectable race  

Whilst Quakers - Sir Gammon here heavd a sigh  
And turned up the greenish white of his eye 

In the second place that street you declare  
Was merely you thought a thoroughfare  
Since straight along it the highway ran  
Open to beast and public to man  
You thought this did you Who ever heard  
Of a thought so palpably absurd  
Good Heavens Mr Green a Brahmin street  
Public to every Englishman's feet!

Thirdly you thought it a highway Then can  
You wonder they thought you a highwayman  
They acknowledge they gave you a thrashing  
Hence I infer they did so in self defence  

Fourthly who authorised you I pray  
In daring to travel along that way  
Twas a street of Brahmins a sacred spot  
It might have been public yet it might not  
You heeded this not you prejudged the case  
And boldly ventured into the place  
And frightened poor Rowdy a mild Hindoo  
Into thrashing yes into half killing you  

At Which in him since he thought he ought to use force  
Was somewhat excusable conduct of course 

So this is my final sentence - that he  
Should pay the fine of one Rupee

Thus ended this wonderful case and now  
You may judge my readers of Good Gammon Row  
Oh hark to gay Rowdy's jeer and scoff  
At poor Green as from Court he sadly moves off  
Moves off through an oily and turban'd crowd  
Of Brahmins that laugh in their triumph aloud

(The incident ended up in local court, but the Brahmin only had to pay few sum as fine. He says Brahmins will keep on thrashing white men.)

\- They shout "We may thrash these white men, for we  
Shall be fined but lightly for such a grand spree."  
It is good to laugh! Say, is it not sport  
To see such a glorious scene in a Court !  
\- Fair JUSTICE perverted, PUBLIC RIGHT  
Shamed and insulted in all men's sight.  
Ha, Ha! Let us laugh! To respect what claim  
Has an Englishman's honour, an Englishman's name?  
A MORAL let us, like a foolscap, draw  
O'er the bald grand head of ancient Law:  
It is this :- All truth, all justice is fudge  
When a Brahmin is judged by a Brahmin Judge !
