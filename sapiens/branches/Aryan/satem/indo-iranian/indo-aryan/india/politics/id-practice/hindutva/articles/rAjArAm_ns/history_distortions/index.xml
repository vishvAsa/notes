      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHAPTER I&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CULTURE AND NATIONALISM&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Struggle for nationhood&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is a great honor for me to be invited to deliver the Second Radha&#xA;Nath Phukan Memorial Lecture. I am particularly happy to be at the&#xA;Vivekananda Kendra Institute of Culture, which is one of the premier&#xA;institutions of its kind with an outstanding record of scholarship and&#xA;service. I am close to the Vivekananda Kendra, with many friends in the&#xA;organization. Sri P. Parameswaran is an esteemed friend of mine, as are&#xA;Dr. Nagaratna, Sri Raghuram and Dr. Nagendra of Bangalore.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHAPTER II&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Distortions in Indian History&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction: roots of distortion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;India gained independence from the British in 1947, or more than fifty&#xA;years ago. But intellectually and educationally India continues be a&#xA;European colony. This is because, during the first forty years of her&#xA;existence as a free nation, the Congress Party and the intellectual&#xA;establishment, continued to encourage colonial institutions and&#xA;thinking. The result today is that there is an English educated elite&#xA;that identifies itself more with the West than with India and her&#xA;ancient civilization. And the Congress Party, especially after the death&#xA;of Sardar Patel, has identified itself more with foreign values rather&#xA;than Indian values. The Communists, who have always been hostile to&#xA;Indian nationalism, have now joined hands with anti-national forces,&#xA;which are fiercely anti-Hindu. This is reflected in the attitude and&#xA;behavior of the English educated intellectuals, including the media.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHAPTER II&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Distortions in Indian History&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction: roots of distortion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;India gained independence from the British in 1947, or more than fifty&#xA;years ago. But intellectually and educationally India continues be a&#xA;European colony. This is because, during the first forty years of her&#xA;existence as a free nation, the Congress Party and the intellectual&#xA;establishment, continued to encourage colonial institutions and&#xA;thinking. The result today is that there is an English educated elite&#xA;that identifies itself more with the West than with India and her&#xA;ancient civilization. And the Congress Party, especially after the death&#xA;of Sardar Patel, has identified itself more with foreign values rather&#xA;than Indian values. The Communists, who have always been hostile to&#xA;Indian nationalism, have now joined hands with anti-national forces,&#xA;which are fiercely anti-Hindu. This is reflected in the attitude and&#xA;behavior of the English educated intellectuals, including the media.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preface&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first half century of India’s existence as a free nation is&#xA;characterized by two significant failures: first, a failure to define&#xA;the concept of India as a nation; second, a failure to evolve national&#xA;institutions in education and intellectual life. In other words, a&#xA;comprehensive failure to define a vision of nationalism rooted in the&#xA;country’s history and culture. The result is that anti-national forces&#xA;have had a field day, seriously undermining national security. Since&#xA;these fifty years have been dominated by the Congress Party — by the&#xA;Nehru-Gandhi family in particular — the party and the dynasty cannot&#xA;escape responsibility for these momentous failures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
