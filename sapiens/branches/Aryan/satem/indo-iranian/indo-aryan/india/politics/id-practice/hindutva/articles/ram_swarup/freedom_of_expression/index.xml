      <description>&lt;p&gt;Preface&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The concept of Secularism as known to the modern West is dreaded,&#xA;derided and denounced in the strongest terms by the foundational&#xA;doctrines of Christianity and Islam. Both of these doctrines prescribe&#xA;Theocracy under which the State serves as the secular arm of the Church&#xA;or the Ummah, and society is regimented by the Sacred Canon or the&#xA;Shariat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This fact is more than evident if we survey the history of Christianity&#xA;till the French Revolution, and the practice which prevails in all&#xA;Islamic states till today. It is a different matter that Christianity&#xA;has reconciled itself to Secularism because of its steep decline in its&#xA;traditional homelands - Europe and the Americas. The doctrine remains&#xA;unchanged and Christianity will restore Theocracy if it were to acquire&#xA;power again. Islam has yet to evince any sign of similar reconciliation&#xA;with Secularism either in doctrine or in practice. In fact, the recent&#xA;trend in most Islamic countries has been to revert to Theocracy in its&#xA;pristine form, that is, as it existed under the four &amp;ldquo;rightly guided&#xA;caliphs&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Not because the subject matter is&#xA;seditious or sacrilegious or obscene, or even controversial, but simply&#xA;because it defies the Emergency imposed on this country by Muslim&#xA;theologians and politicians backed by &amp;lsquo;secularist&amp;rsquo; intellectuals and&#xA;politicians and riotous Muslim mobs and plain terrorists.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;TEN&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Fomenting Reaction&lt;a href=&#34;#1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Arun Shourie&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ram Swarup, now in his seventies, is a scholar of the first rank. In the&#xA;1950s when our intellectuals were singing paeans to Marxism, and to Mao&#xA;in particular, he wrote critiques of communism and of the actual - that&#xA;is, dismal performance of communist governments. He showed that the&#xA;&amp;ldquo;sacrifices&amp;rdquo; which the people were being compelled to make had nothing&#xA;to do with building a new society in which at some future date they&#xA;would be the heirs to milk and honey. On the contrary, the &amp;ldquo;sacrifices&amp;rdquo;&#xA;were nothing but the results of terrorism, pure and simple - of State&#xA;terrorism, to use the expression our progressives use for all&#xA;governments save governments which have used terror most brutally and&#xA;most extensively. And that this terror was being deployed for one reason&#xA;alone: to ensure total dominance, and that in perpetuity, for the&#xA;narrowest of oligarchies. He showed that the claims to efficiency and&#xA;productivity, to equitable distribution and to high morale which were&#xA;being made by these governments, and ever more so by their apologists&#xA;and propagandists in countries such as India were wholly unsustainable,&#xA;that in fact they were fabrications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

As&#xA;such the ban in his view, the report said, &amp;ldquo;qualifies as an indefensible&#xA;move&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He attempted an apology but could&#xA;not save himself from the hounds. On May 22, the fire-eating Imam of&#xA;Jama Masjid declared from the pulpit that &amp;ldquo;anyone who defends Salman&#xA;Rushdie is defiling Islam.&amp;rdquo; The students of the Jamia Millia shouted:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Qaum ka gaddar, Maut ka haqdar&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; (Betrayer of the community, deserver&#xA;of death).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;FOURTEEN&lt;br&gt;&#xA;How should we respond?&lt;a href=&#34;#1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Arun Shourie&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Late in the afternoon on November 15, a police official visited the&#xA;office of the &lt;em&gt;Voice of India&lt;/em&gt;, a publication house that has been&#xA;publishing works of academic excellence. These have one distinguishing&#xA;feature: There is no other set of books which has done as thorough a job&#xA;of nailing the falsehoods and evasions of the secularists as the books&#xA;published by this small publishing house. Marxists - and even more,&#xA;their fellow travellers - have denounced them as &amp;lsquo;communal&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;FIFTEEN&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Ban this Book&lt;a href=&#34;#1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Koenraad Elst&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a letter dated August 20, 1993, Janata Dal MP Syed Shahabuddin has&#xA;asked the Minister of State for Home, P.M. Sayeed, to ban the book&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Hindu View of Christianity and Islam&lt;/em&gt; by Ram Swarup (Voice of India,&#xA;New Delhi 1992). It is not his first time: in 1988, Shahabuddin was&#xA;instrumental in getting Salman Rushdie&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Satanic Verses&lt;/em&gt; banned.&#xA;This time he has not been equally successful in getting the book swiftly&#xA;banned, but judicial proceedings are under way to get it banned after&#xA;all. As a European India-watcher, I leave it to Indian commentators to&#xA;advise the public on how to react to this new onslaught on the freedom&#xA;of publication, and will limit myself to some background analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Rationalist Press Association members: Â£ 15,&#xA;Including postage, from RPA, Bradlaugh House.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My own attempt to engage with Islam has, before reading this book,&#xA;mainly been through talking with a group of Islamic students from Kings&#xA;College, London, who regularly set up a lunchtime stall outside their&#xA;college gates in The Strand, opposite the church of St. Mary Overy.&#xA;Their views are extreme, but appear entirely within the mainstream&#xA;Islamic tradition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Wells&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why I Am Not a Muslim, By Ibn Warraq (Amherst, N.Y. : Prometheus Books,&#xA;1995) 402 pp., $25.95 cloth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why I Am Not a Muslim&lt;/em&gt; certainly deserves the epithet &amp;ldquo;courageous&amp;rdquo; with&#xA;which R. J. Hoffmann introduces it in his Foreword, not so much because&#xA;of its thesis that Islamic civilization often reached magnificent&#xA;heights despite the religion of Islam, as because almost all the&#xA;fundamental tenets of Islam are here scrutinized uncompromisingly.&#xA;Moreover, Ibn Warraq&amp;rsquo;s criticisms are no idiosyncrasies, but supported&#xA;with very extensive references to scholarly works. His book is&#xA;particularly valuable as a means of acquainting oneself with this&#xA;scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It is the voice of those who are born Muslims but&#xA;wish to recant in adulthood, yet are not permitted to on pain of death.&#xA;Someone who does not live in an Islamic society cannot imagine the&#xA;sanctions, both self-imposed and external, that militate against&#xA;expressing religious disbelief. &amp;lsquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t believe in God&amp;rsquo; is an&#xA;impossible public utterance even among family and friendsâ€¦ So we hold&#xA;our tongues, those of us who doubt.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

With his book as travel&#xA;guide, you&amp;rsquo;ll never forget the dark and treacherous sides of Islam.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Warraq has the credentials because he&amp;rsquo;s taken the journey himself - one&#xA;that started with the certainties of growing up in a Muslim family, then&#xA;through the dark night of doubt and, finally, to rejecting completely&#xA;all revealed religion. He now considers himself a &amp;ldquo;secular humanist who&#xA;believes that all religions are sick men&amp;rsquo;s dreams, false - demonstrably&#xA;false - and pernicious.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

(UK Agent, 10 Crescent View, Loughton, IG10 4PZ).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This book was written by a man who was raised in a totally Muslim&#xA;environment in an overwhelmingly Muslim country. But he has since moved&#xA;to one of the NATO states which have since World War II been accepting&#xA;mass immigrations from such countries. &lt;em&gt;Why I am not a Muslim&lt;/em&gt; is&#xA;apparently the first book of its kind to have appeared in the English&#xA;language.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Why again was it that he was born in&#xA;Bethlehem? Because of Roman Emperor Augustus&amp;rsquo; order to organize a&#xA;census. The Bible narrates how this census took place when one Quirinius&#xA;was Roman Governor of Greater Syria. For this census, we are told,&#xA;Jesus&amp;rsquo; parents had to go to Bethlehem, and there his birth took place.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

These days, it often takes courage&#xA;to publish a controversial book. In the wake of the persecution of&#xA;Salman Rushdie and the Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasreen, many&#xA;publishers have become reluctant to bring out controversial books. They&#xA;are particularly chary of publishing anything that is critical of&#xA;Muslims, Prophet Muhammad, the Koran or Islamic laws. In the&#xA;circumstances, the courage shown by Prometheus Books of U.S.A. in&#xA;bringing out Ibn Warraq&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Why I am Not a Muslim&lt;/em&gt; is praiseworthy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;TWENTY-THREE&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Demystifying Islam&lt;a href=&#34;#1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Curt van den Heuvel&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why I am not a Muslim&lt;/em&gt; is a rare book. It is not often that one comes&#xA;across Muslim apostates who are willing to openly share their views of&#xA;Islam. As such, Warraq does an excellent job of demystifying Islam, and&#xA;revealing it&amp;rsquo;s very human origins.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Through several chapters devoted to Muhammed and the Koran, Warraq&#xA;traces the development of Islamic thought in Arabia. Contrary to the&#xA;opinions of Islamic propagandists, Warraq shows that the Koran evolved&#xA;over several centuries (just like the Bible). As for Islamic tradition&#xA;and practice, Warraq shows how Muhammed simply incorporated a number of&#xA;elements from Arabia&amp;rsquo;s pagan history into his &amp;rsquo;new&amp;rsquo; religion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Now we have the courageous work of Ibn Warraq, &lt;em&gt;Why I&#xA;Am Not a Muslim&lt;/em&gt;, first published in the USA in 1995.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;TWENTY-FIVE&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The Koranic View of Government&lt;a href=&#34;#1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anwar Shaikh&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The book &lt;em&gt;Why I am Not a Muslim&lt;/em&gt; by Ibn Warraq is a nice aggregate of&#xA;learning, intellect and courage. I was delighted when its author paid me&#xA;a visit in the early part of 1997. During the conversation, I was&#xA;impressed by his motive and mastery of the subject.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ibn Warraq is the pen-name of the author whose parents emigrated from&#xA;India to Pakistan as a result of the Partition. He was brought up in&#xA;Pakistan, which was supposed to be an Islamic Republic. His experience&#xA;revealed to him that the Muslims of India had been cheated in the name&#xA;of Islam and its projected principles of equality, free will and&#xA;democracy. As he grew up, he noticed that Islam had become an effective&#xA;tool of convenient morality and achieving political goals; a religious&#xA;or secular leader could prove anything from the Koran and Hadith to suit&#xA;his purpose, yet every faithful believes that there is no contradiction&#xA;in the verses of the Koran! During his long cogitation on the subject,&#xA;Ibn Warraq became suspicious about the Divine Origin of the Koran: It is&#xA;a case of intellectual anarchy, he realised. But the curiosity that had&#xA;been spurred by the zeal of enquiry, demanded a thorough study of the&#xA;Koran, the Hadith and the History to Islam. As a result, came into being&#xA;his famous work: &lt;em&gt;Why I am Not a Muslim&lt;/em&gt;. It testifies to the fact that&#xA;he has abandoned Islam, which he once dearly loved as a matter of faith,&#xA;without realising what it was all about. To him, faith is the enemy of&#xA;reason, which is the root of humanity; a man with suppressed intellect&#xA;is no better than a monkey: religion is the source of regression and not&#xA;progression. Thus, blind faith, the essence of religion, is not&#xA;acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Prometheus Books, New York 1995,&#xA;xvi, 402 pages, ISBN. 0-87975-984-4.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ibn Warraq grew up in a Muslim family. Islam is a jealous religion so&#xA;that any man who grew up in a Muslim family and is, for that reason&#xA;considered a Muslim, not by his own volition, has to remain a Muslim for&#xA;life, or else he is sentenced to death, and this sentence will be&#xA;carried out as soon as a Muslim assassin can get him in the crossed&#xA;hairs. Apostasy, in Arabic &lt;em&gt;irtidad&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;ridda&lt;/em&gt;, is considered &amp;ldquo;treason&amp;rdquo;&#xA;and a &amp;ldquo;danger to the (Islamic) state&amp;rdquo;. An apostatic woman is not&#xA;executed but imprisoned until she agrees to be a Muslim again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
