  <p>CHAPTER II<br>
JIZYAH AND ITS ASSOCIATIONS-IMPLICATIONS</p>
<p>Little research appears to have been attempted on the role of Jizyah in
the spread of Islam or even on Jizyah in general. We are aware of only
one monograph on it, by Daniel C. Denett.<a href="#1">1</a> An article,
&lsquo;Al-Jizyah&rsquo;, in Urdu from the pen of Shibli Nu&rsquo;mani (d. 1916) was hailed
by Abu &lsquo;I-Kalam Azad as a major breakthrough of the modem age in Islamic
studies.</p>
<p>Shibli, Denett, and others are inclined to trace the origin of the term
and concept of Jizyah to Aramaic &lsquo;<em>gizît</em>&rsquo;/&lsquo;gizyat&rsquo; (Shibli)<a href="#2">2</a> or
&lsquo;<em>gzîthâ</em>&rsquo; known to have been in vogue from before the time of Khusrau
AnûshîrwâN (531-579 A.D.). It was a kind of capitation tax or poll tax,
payment of which amounted to a badge of degradation and a mark of social
inferiority. Therefore, privileged classes, such as ruling, military,
priestly and educated aristocracy were exempt from it.<a href="#3">3</a> For
Jizyah, the Byzantine Empire had its own counterpart, <em>tributum
capitis</em>, from before <em>circa</em> 290 A.D. Constantine (274-337 A.D.) is
reported to have exempted the urban pleb from it. By and by &rsquo;the poll
tax became, after fourth century, a burden uniquely assessed on the
colonus and identified with this class of society, and that to this tax
a stigma, &ldquo;<em>injuria</em>&rdquo;, was attached, as in the phrase &ldquo;<em>a plebeiae
capitationis injuria</em>&rdquo;.<a href="#4">4</a> We shall see that payment of Jizyah as
prescribed by the Qur&rsquo;ân also carries a stigma with it.</p>
<p>The Qur&rsquo;ân prescribes Jizyah in a Jihâdic verse, revealed about 631
A.D., i.e. about a year after the capture of Mecca by the Prophet in 630
A.D., envisaging compounding of refusal to embrace Islam by paying
Jizyah. We quote the verse in full, in original; <em>&lsquo;Qâtilu &lsquo;I-ladhîna lâ
yu&rsquo;mûna bi &rsquo;llâhi, wa lâ bi &rsquo;l-yawmi &rsquo;l-âkhiri, wa lâ yuHarrimûna mâ
Harrama &lsquo;Ilâhu wa rasûlu-hû, wa lâ yadinûna dîna &lsquo;I-Haqqî mina
&lsquo;I-ladhîna ûtu &lsquo;I-kitâba, hattâ yu&rsquo;Tu &lsquo;I-jizyata &lsquo;añ yyadiN wwa hum
Sâghirûna</em>.<a href="#5">5</a> Mohomed Marmaduke Pickthall translates it thus:
&lsquo;Fight against such of those who have been given the Scripture as
believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, and forbid not that which Allah
hath forbidden by His messenger, and follow not the religion of truth,
until they pay the tribute readily, being brought low.&rsquo; This represents
the common run of translations of the verse by Muslims and non-Muslims
alike. The verse so translated leaves the course of paying Jizyah, as
alternative to conversion and death, open to the scripturaries, people
of the book, only. And the Qur&rsquo;ân recognizes only two communities
(<em>Tâ&rsquo;ifatayn</em>), viz. Jews and Christians, as scripturaries.<a href="#6">6</a> Imâm
Shâfi&rsquo;î, one of the four great jurists of Islam, includes the Magians
(Zoroastrians) among the scripturaries, on the basis of a precedent set
by the Prophet in accepting Jizyah from the Magians of BaHrîn, Hajar,
QaTâr, Qatîf, and &lsquo;Ummân. &lsquo;Umar, the second Caliph, accorded this status
to the Magians of Persia and Sabaeans of Mesopotamia, &lsquo;Uthmân to Berbers
of Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco (all in North Africa), and Muhammad bin
Qâsim under the Governor Hajjâj bin Yûsuf and the Caliph Walîd bin &lsquo;Abd
al-Malik to the Hindus and Buddhists of Sindh. According to Imam Malik,
another of the four great jurists, the verse of Jizyah is applicable to
all non-Muslims excepting apostates (<em>murtadd</em>-s). Imâm Abû Hanîfah, a
third great jurist out of the four, applies it to all excepting the
idolaters of Arabia. All non-Jizyah-paying infidels deserve death as a
rule.</p>
<p>Our interpretation of the Jizyah verse is entirely different. We are
inclined to believe that the doors of paying Jizyah are open to
scripturaries and non-scripturaries alike. Let us examine the verse
closely.</p>
<p>The verse in question prescribes Jihâd against non-Muslims of the
following two categories:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. Those who do not believe in God, the Last Day, and the distinction
between the tabooed (<em>Harâm</em>) and the non-tabooed (<em>Halâl</em>) drawn by
God and His apostle.</p>
<p>2. Those of the scripturaries who do not accept Islam.</p></blockquote>
<p>The people referred to under the first category cannot be scripturaries,
for the simple reason that all scripturaries believe in God, the Last
Day, and the taboo-non-taboo distinction. Hence only non-scripturaries
come under that category. This is why we maintain that the verse applies
to non-Muslims of both the categories. We would, accordingly, propose
retranslation of the verse thus: &lsquo;Fight against those who believe not in
Allah nor the Last Day, and taboo not what Allâh and His apostle have
tabooed, and against such of those who have been given the scripture as
follow not the religion of truth, until they pay Jizyah with their own
hand, being brought low.&rsquo;<a href="#7">7</a> It is significant that this verse
belongs to Sûrah at-Tawbah/al-Barâ&rsquo;ah (Sûrah 9) revealed on the eve of
and for the Great Hajj (<em>Hajj al-Akbar</em>) as the Qur&rsquo;ân calls it,<a href="#8">8</a>
which concerned the idolaters much more than others,<a href="#9">9</a> for from
then on the rule of <em>Jâhiliyyah</em> (paganism) yielded place to Islam. It
is also to be noted, incidentally, that in the Meccan treaty, concluded
in circa 623 A.D., i.e. about eight years before revelation of the verse
under consideration, between the Aws and the Khazraj tribes, to which
the Jews were allowed to adhere, no Jizyah nor any other disability was
imposed, save the stipulation that, if they took part in a war fought by
the Muslims against the Kâfirs, they must share the expenses in the
joint action.</p>
<p>Well, the thrust of the Jizyah-verse and its implications as worked out
and codified in course of time boil down to the following significant
points:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. Jizyah is primarily a Jihâdic impost, not a fiscal one, as sought
usually to be made out.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>In the matter of liability for Jizyah, scripturaries and other
non-Muslims share the same fate, with the reservation, however, that
the Prophet is traditioned to have willed (<em>awSâ</em>) and commanded
(<em>amara</em>) at the time of his death that there should be no non-Muslims
in Arabia any longer,<a href="#10">10</a> thereby ruling out the concession of
Jizyah for them.</li>
</ol>
<p>3. It presupposes Islam&rsquo;s Eminent Domain over all other communities.</p>
<p>4. It presupposes the principles</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(i) that the world is meant for and belongs to the Muslims to the
entire exclusion of the K5firs, and</p>
<p>(ii) that thereby life and property of the communities conquered by
the Muslims in Jihâd is entirely at the disposal of the latter, who
could plunder, enslave, or kill them at will.<a href="#11">11</a></p></blockquote>
<ol start="5">
<li>It involves no obligation (<em>dhimmah</em>) on the part of Islamdom
towards Jizyah-paying individuals or communities called <em>Dhimmî</em>-s
save of course the negative one of non-extermination and of not
grudging them bare subsistence, as though as hewers of wood and
drawers of water. <em>Dhimmah</em> or <em>Dhimmî</em>-hood is survival on ransom
(Jizyah and allied imposts).</li>
</ol>
<p>6. Different theories are there in the field as regards the purpose
of the Qurânic provision for imposition of Jizyah, such, for example,
as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(i) satisfaction (<em>jaza&rsquo;a</em> = he gave satisfaction),</p>
<p>(ii) compensation,</p>
<p>(iii) rental for residence,</p>
<p>(iv) price for protection (<em>amân</em>),</p>
<p>(v) exchange for military service,</p>
<p>(vi) price for exercise of religion,</p>
<p>(vii) punishment for unbelief,</p>
<p>(viii) humiliation for persistence in darkness or contempt for
rival faith, and, by way of a secondary motive,</p>
<p>(ix) love of power and pelf at the cost of others, which includes,
<em>inter alia</em>, pauperization of the latter, as at any rate was the
case under the Sultanate in medieval India. Imposition of Jizyah is,
thereby, an engine of exploitation.</p></blockquote></blockquote>
<p>To put things straight, we may highlight the following principal motives
for imposition of Jizyah:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. It is meant to be an alternative to killing, plunder, enslavement,
ransom, forcible conversion, as well as to be a penalty for Kufr.
Thereby, it transpires to be a kind of composition fine, an indulgence
tax. It is fiscal Jihâd, so to speak.</p>
<p>2. It is a badge of humiliation for being a non-Muslim, of utter
servility to Islamdom, of abject surrender to the brute force of
Islam. Islam is absolute surrender to the will of God; liability to
pay Jizyah, abject surrender to the will of Islamdom. The amount of
Jizyah does not matter much. The great Persian poet Bedil&rsquo;s poetic
verdict is memorable:</p></blockquote>
<p><em>&lsquo;Ilaj-I nîst dâgh-î bandagî râ<br>
Agar besham wa gar kam âfrîdand</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>That is, &lsquo;There is no cure for the blot of servility. It matters not
whether it is more or less.&rsquo;</p>
<p>3. The long-term policy behind it appears to be to compel or motivate
the <em>Dhimmî</em>-s slowly to turn to Islam and embrace it. They were let
live in the hope of their conversion in course of time. It is thereby
a camouflaged engine of repression.</p>
<p>4. It opens the door to levy of other humiliating taxes on the
<em>Dhimmî</em>-s, such for example as pilgrimage tax, for petty concession
to them in the observance of their religious ceremonies etc. It is
also a prelude to Kharâj (land-tax) into the bargain.</p></blockquote>
<p>We cannot resist the temptation of quoting Mujaddid-i Alf-i Thânî, the
second-millennium reviver/rejuvenator of Islam during JahâNgîr&rsquo;s reign,
on the purpose of imposition of Jizyah: &lsquo;The real purpose of imposing
Jizyah on them (the Kâfirs) is their humiliation. And the humiliation
goes to the extent that for fear of Jizyah they may not put on good
dress and live with dignity/in prosperity and they may always live in
fear trembling.&rsquo; (<em>Wa maqSûd-i aSlî az jizyah giriftan az îshâN khârî-i
ishân ast. Wa în khârî ba-Hadd-î &lsquo;st ki az tars-i jizyah jâmah-i khûb na
mî-tawânand poshîd, wa ba-tajammul na mî-tawânand bûd, wa hamîshah
tarsâN wa larzâN mi-bâshand</em>).<a href="#12">12</a> Indeed, levy of Jizyah is a
long-term exercise in controlled compulsion for conversion.</p>
<p>This is theory. Let us look into history,</p>
<p>How did Jizyah come to be introduced? It was Najrân, a district of Yaman
and the greatest centre of civilization and Christianity in the Arabian
peninsula. Long before the pretensions of the Quraysh of Mecca whose
nobility came to be recognized only after their Islamization and mainly
because of their kinship with the Prophet, the Najrânites were esteemed
as the wealthiest and noblest of the Arabs by all, including poets.
Having emerged as the biggest power in Arabia, the Prophet began to send
squads of missionaries far and wide to spread Islam. When one such squad
reached Na.jr5n, in 629 A.D., the Christians there began to question the
validity and authenticity of the Qur&rsquo;ân, which the illiterate
missionaries of Islam had not visualized. The Christians drew their
attention to the blunder in the Qur&rsquo;ânic description<a href="#13">13</a> of Mary,
Jesus&rsquo;s mother, as the sister of Moses and Aaron. Mughîrah bin Shu&rsquo;bah,
the leader of the mission, failed to reply and reported the matter to
the Prophet. The Prophet called the Christians. Their delegation started
in horror, with the following verses on their lips: &lsquo;We are appearing
before you in such a way that even the embryo in our camel&rsquo;s womb is
feeling restless. His religion is opposed to that of the
Christians.&rsquo;<a href="#14">14</a> When they drew near the Prophet, he turned his
face from them and did not talk to them. Next morning he invited them to
embrace Islam, which they rejected. There was a virtual debate between
him and the Christians. The Prophet criticised their doctrine of the
Christ&rsquo;s Sonship of God. Upon this, the Christians asked him who in his
opinion was the father of Jesus. The Prophet could not reply. After some
time, however, a revelation came to him to the effect that the birth of
Jesus was akin to that of Adam.<a href="#15">15</a> As regards the Christians&rsquo;
question about Mary, the Prophet said nothing beyond the statement that
the Israelites sometimes named their members after the names of their
forbears.<a href="#16">16</a> When the Prophet failed to satisfy them, however, he
challenged them to settle the dispute by the old Arab method sanctioned
by the Qur&rsquo;an, of reciprocal curses (<em>mubâhalah</em>).<a href="#17">17</a> The
Christians disapproved of it and withdrew, as the New Testament forbids
cursing. Then the Prophet dictated his terms, asked them to embrace
Islam, and, upon their refusal, to accept his suzerainty and pay Jizyah.
They were made subjects of the Prophet and had Jizyah imposed upon them
perforce.</p>
<p>The treaty concluded by the Prophet with the Najrânites served as a
model for future treaties with scripturaries. According to it, the
Najrânites were to enjoy protection of life, property, and religion,
&rsquo;till God ordained otherwise, in return for the payment of an annual
Jizyah of two thousand garments (<em>Hullah</em>-s) of a specified value plus
one <em>ûqiyyah</em> (40 dirham-s/ one pound, more or less) of silver, with
each garment, together with the provision of board and lodging to the
Prophet&rsquo;s envoys for upto a month. It was also incumbent upon the
Najrânites to lend thirty coats of mail, thirty horses, and thirty
camels in the event of a war with al-Yaman and refrain from
usury.<a href="#18">18</a></p>
<p>The first Caliph, Abû Bakr, honoured the agreement, but &lsquo;Umar, the
second Caliph. took advantage of the clause to the effect that the
agreement was valid till God ordained otherwise and the Prophet&rsquo;s will
that there should be no non-Muslims in Arabia, and banished the
Najrânites after buying up their property. He also gave them a writ to
the effect that they must be provided with land for residence and
cultivation in Syria and Iraq. Thereafter, they had to disperse and seek
asylum in Syria and Kûfah. In Kûfah, they founded a town named
An-Nairâniyyah. When &lsquo;Uthmân, the third Caliph, came into power, it was
represented to him that &lsquo;Umar&rsquo;s writ served to deprive the original
land-holders of their land. He, therefore, decreased their Jizyah by two
hundred garments. The Najrânites&rsquo; untold suffering constrained them to
represent to &lsquo;Alî, the fourth Caliph, to let them revert to Najrân in
terms of their agreement with the Prophet reduced to writing by &lsquo;Alî
himself. But to no effect. They in due course approached the fifth and
sixth Caliphs, who decreased their Jizyah further by two hundred
garments. Later, Hajjâj bin Yûasuf, governor of Irâq, tyrannized over
them and enhanced their Jizyah beyond endurable limits. When &lsquo;Umar bin
&lsquo;Abd al-&lsquo;Azîz became Caliph, they complained to him that they were
virtually ruined and that they remained only one tenth of their
population. The Caliph reduced their Jizyah to two hundred
garments.<a href="#19">19</a></p>
<p>This in short is the tale of the finest civilization of the Arabian
peninsula uprooted and thrown out of history for good, by what is
flaunted as the religion of peace.</p>
<p>Jizyah remained an instrument of motivation towards conversion
throughout the history of Islam. Besides, believe it or not, it
sometimes operated as a stumbling block in the path of conversion. It
became an instrument of exploitation at the hands of greedy rulers, so
much so that it came sometimes to be levied on neo-Muslims as well,
outside Arabia. This became the order of the day during the Umayyad
regime. It was &lsquo;Umar bin &lsquo;Abd al-&lsquo;Azîz, (d.720 A.D.), one of the Umayyad
Caliphs themselves, who abolished it altogether. There appears, however,
to have been a relapse of the malaise during the regime of Hishâm bin
&lsquo;Abd al-Malik soon after. One of his governors did exempt the
neo-Muslims from the liability to pay Jizyah, but it came to be
reimposed when its abolition began to affect the exchequer adversely.
&lsquo;Umar, the second Caliph, had earlier practised the anomaly of imposing
double Zakât on the Christians of Bane Taghlib, even though Zakât is due
from the Muslims only, according to the Qur&rsquo;âdn. This led to
complications, religious as well as political. The Caliph did propose to
impose Jizyah on them, but they considered it beneath their dignity to
be rendered liable to pay Jizyah, and threatened exodus from the <em>Dâr
al-Islâm</em>. Upon this, &lsquo;Umar was advised not to antagonize that extremely
warlike Arab tribe and he levied Zakât on them instead of Jizyah. The
tribe preferred it to Jizyah.<a href="#20">20</a></p>
<p>Jizyah continued to be used with varying degrees of emphasis for
compelling conversion. Twenty-four thousand Christians embraced Islam,
when Al-HafS bin al-Walîd, the deposed governor of Egypt, took advantage
of the Umayyad family revolution to regain his office and proclaimed (in
744 A.D.) that converts to Islam would be exempted from Jizyah. The same
thing happened in 751 A.D., when the Abbâsid governor of Egypt held out
the same promise.<a href="#21">21</a></p>
<p>Sometimes, the Jizyah gun misfired. We have seen how the Christians of
Banû Taghlib accepted liability for double Zakât and rejected levy of
Jizyah as humiliating. A Christian named Jabalah offered to pay Zakât
but not Jizyah. &lsquo;Umar did not agree. Then he left the <em>Dâr al-Islâm</em> for
some territory under the Roman empire along with thirty thousand people.
&lsquo;Umar relented and requested them to return and pay whatever they had
offered to. But they did not accede to his request and the Caliph was
deprived of an important source of revenue.<a href="#22">22</a></p>
<p>Unlike the other Umayyads who were interested more in Jizyah than in the
spead of Islam, &lsquo;Umar bin &lsquo;Abd al-&lsquo;Azîz was all for the latter. His
governor of Egypt, Hayyân, wrote to him: &lsquo;O Commander of the Faithful!
If things continue as they are now in Egypt, all the &ldquo;Protected Peoples&rdquo;
will soon become Muslims and then we shall cease to get money (taxes)
from them.&rsquo; Whereupon &lsquo;Umar sent him a messenger saying: &lsquo;Go down to
Egypt and give Hayyân thirty stripes with a whip upon his head as a
punishment for that which he has written and tell him as follows: &ldquo;Take
care, O Hayyan! whosoever has become a Muslim, do not ask poll-tax from
him. I only wish that the whole bunch of them would become converted.
Verily! Allâh has sent MuHammad as a preacher, not as a tax-gatherer.&rsquo;&rsquo;&rsquo;
(al-Wâsitî, alive 1292).</p>
<p>&lsquo;Umar bin &lsquo;Abd al-&lsquo;Azîz&rsquo;s governors and Jizyah-collectors tried,
however, to circumvent his dispensation. The governor of Khurâsân
planned to keep the number of Jizyah assessees as high as possible by
laying down conditions of circumcision to be certified by a staff
appointed for the purpose, of memorizing at least one chapter of the
Qur&rsquo;ân, of proving by word and deed loyalty to the Muslims, and so
forth, with the result that the great majority of neo-Muslims had to
keep bearing the burden of Jizyah.</p>
<p>Thus, though Jizyah has played enormous role in the spread of Islam, it
sometimes helped retard it as well. When a tribe found that acceptance
of Islam failed to save it from Jizyah and other humiliations
accompanying it, it saw no point in continuing in Islam or embracing it.
Sometimes, they had to revert to their ancestral religion. Thus, the
Sughdî-s of the trans-Âmû region had become Muslims for exemption from
Jizyah but had later to revert to their native religion in thousands on
finding themselves still under the yoke of the same disabilities and
indignities as ordained for non-Muslims. Sometimes, again, even exodus
took place for fear of Jizyah. During the regime of &lsquo;Umar bin &lsquo;Abd
al-&lsquo;Azîz himself, when Asharas, the governor of Khurâsân, reimposed
Jizyah on neo-Muslims, seven thousand of them left Samarqand in search
of a Jizyah-free abode.</p>
<p>In fact, not only Jizyah but also booty (<em>nafal/ghanimah</em>) in war with
non-Muslims was responsible for retarding the process of conversion to
Islam. A couple of the Qur&rsquo;ânic verses prescribe plunder or booty as an
integral part of Jihâd and legitimate source of income.<a href="#23">23</a> And
plunder is of three kinds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. Property, movable and immovable (amwâl wa amlâk)</p>
<p>2. Women and children, especially women (sabâyâ)</p>
<p>3. Prisoners, especially male prisoners (<em>usarâ</em>&rsquo;)</p></blockquote>
<p>Booty in war with non-Muslims proved so gainful to the Muslims even
during the Prophet&rsquo;s time that, when a Companion of the Prophet planned
to attack a non-Muslim tribe and the tribe not only surrendered but
also, on a promise being held out by him to save their life and property
on embracing Islam, did embrace Islam, his comrades took him to task for
thus depriving the Muslims of booty.<a href="#24">24</a> &lsquo;Umar, the second Caliph,
wrote to Sa&rsquo;d when he conquered Irâq: &lsquo;Anyone who obeys you and accepted
Islam prior to the battle is one of the Muslim, owning what they own and
having a share in Islam. But he who obeyed you after the battle and the
defeat, is (also) one of the Muslims; however, his property goes to the
people of Islam because they acquired it before the conversion to Islam.
The people of any town subjugated by force who embrace Islam prior to
the division of spoils are considered free people, but their properties
go to the Muslims.&rsquo;<a href="#25">25</a></p>
<p>This is itself a licence to loot neo-Muslims.</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, temptation of direct plunder is found to have been
resisted with an eye to more substantial gains expected to accrue
otherwise. So, when &lsquo;Umar conquered as-Sawâd (south Irâq), he proceeded
to take a census with a view to dividing its land-holdings among the
Muslims. But &lsquo;Alî dissuaded him from confiscating these as booty, on the
plea that the non-Muslim cultivators would prove a better source of
income as Jizyah- and Kharâj-payers.<a href="#26">26</a></p>
<p>What was the rate of Jizyah? The Qur&rsquo;ân gives no guidance in this
behalf. The Prophet levied Jizyah usually at the rate of one <em>dînâr</em>
(five rupees) and one <em>jarîb</em> (about 20 kilograms) of wheat per major
male and female. In al-BaHrîn, however, he made a compromise on half the
quantity of dates and coms.<a href="#27">27</a> &lsquo;Umar, the second Caliph,
established three grades of Jizyah:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. Rupees six on major workers, cultivators, and artisans</p>
<p>2. Rupees twelves on the middle classes</p>
<p>3. Rupees twenty-four on the rich.</p></blockquote>
<p>He exempted children, women, old persons, and monks from Jizyah. In
addition to Jizyah, cultivators of the countryside had to pay Kharâj
(land-tax) also, and inhabitants of uncolonised suburbs of cities had to
make provisions of ration, olive oil, honey and vinegar for Muslim
armies stationed there. His Egyptian governor, &lsquo;Amar bin al-&lsquo;ÂS added
clothing to the list and increased the rate of Jizyah from six rupees to
ten rupees, extorting ration etc. at a higher rate into the bargain.
Later, under &lsquo;Umar&rsquo;s own dispensation, the rate of Jizyah for Syria,
Irâq, and Egypt was increased to twenty rupees plus a lot of provisions
in kind at a highly enhanced rate and hosting of Muslim wayfarers and
armies for three days.<a href="#28">28</a> It was also made incumbent upon the
Jizyah-payers of Irâq to guard the paths and bridges and repair these at
their own cost. The loss sustained by these <em>Dhimmî</em>-s consequent upon
movement of Muslim armies was never compensated for.<a href="#29">29</a> During
&lsquo;Umar&rsquo;s time, a trade and commerce tax called &lsquo;Ushur was also levied on
the <em>Dhimmî</em>-s.<a href="#30">30</a> Till the time of the fourth Caliph, &lsquo;Alî, eight
sources of revenue to the state exchequer had come into vogue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. Spoils of war/booty/plunder (<em>anfal/ghanîmah</em>)</p>
<p>2. Jizyah</p>
<p>3. Kharâj (land-tax)</p>
<p>4. Fai&rsquo; (tax due in respect of a treaty)</p>
<p>5. &lsquo;Ushur or the tithes (trade and commerce tax)</p>
<p>6. Sawâfiyy (estates and villages deserted by non-Muslim in the event
of attack by Muslim armies or left by the former after death, set
apart for the Caliph)</p>
<p>7. The farms and oases of Banû NaDîr, Fadak, Khaybar, and Mecca, the
income from which accrued to the Muslim state from the time of the
Prophet</p>
<p>8. Zakât</p></blockquote>
<p>The Umayyads added certain minor sources of revenue to the list.</p>
<p>Out of these, Muslims came ultimately to bear the burden of only the
following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. Zakât,</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Kharâj, usually but not always, in the event of retaining their
land after conversion to Islam. &lsquo;Umar bin &lsquo;Abd al-&lsquo;Azîz exempted the
Khurâsânites from Kharâj on their conversion to Islam.<a href="#31">31</a></li>
</ol>
<p>3. An infinitesimal part of &lsquo;Ushur, leaving all else to the
<em>Dhimmî</em>-s.</p></blockquote>
<p>Abû Yûsuf prescribes Kharâj on <em>Dhimmî</em>-s at double the rate thereof on
Muslims.<a href="#32">32</a> As regards Zakât, which is flaunted as a liability
upon Muslims juxtaposed to Jizyah, it is noteworthy that, though Muslims
were expected to pay 40% of their total income of a whole year as Zakât,
yet it ceased to be irksome inasmuch as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. it wa s not realized by the state, at any rate the way Jizyah was,</p>
<p>2. it was meant for charitable purposes,</p>
<p>3. it was supposed to earn religious merit (<em>thawâb</em>), and</p>
<p>4. it was a matter of individual conscience.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thus, Jizyah implies and involves a lot more than the so-called paltry
sum of a few rupees yearly per taxable head. It opens the door to
unlimited exploitation, and addition of insult to injury, into the
bargain. It kept <em>Dhimmî</em>-s exposed to victimization when the state
stood in need of money. On the towns surrendering by peaceful treaties,
such as Hirâ, Ullays, &lsquo;Ayn at-Tamr, and Banîqiyah in south Iraq
(<em>as-Sawâd</em>), and Damascus, Bala&rsquo;bakk, HimS, and Jerusalem in Syria,
imposition of collective Jizyah became the order of the day, so much so
that, while those who died or became Muslims were freed of Jizyah, the
sum total of Jizyah on each town remained constant, the remaining
<em>Dhimmî</em>-s bearing the burden of the Jizyah paid earlier by the deceased
while alive and the converts to Islam before their conversion. For
instance, by death or conversion the population of Najrâniyyah, founded
in Irâq by the Christians of Najrân on being driven out of their
homeland by the Arabs, dwindled, but neither Mu&rsquo;âwiyyah nor others would
easily reduce the quantum of Jizyah. YaHyâ bin Âdam (757-818) rules:
&lsquo;All of them are charged with whatever was peaceably agreed upon, taking
into consideration their ability to pay from their properties and lands,
but nothing will be deducted following death or conversion to Islam of
any of them, as the whole should be collected from the rest in
accordance with their ability to pay and to be charged.&rsquo;<a href="#33">33</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;Umar bin &lsquo;Abd al-&lsquo;Azîz had the conscience to abolish the cruel system
and enforced a uniform rule that each Dhimmî had to pay Jizyah on his
own head.<a href="#34">34</a> On the other side, when the burden of the
ever-increasing liability for the others&rsquo; Jizyah on the <em>Dhimmî</em>-s
became intolerable, Hajjâj bin Yusûf, the governor of Iraq, reimposed
Jizyah on the converts.</p>
<p>Sometimes, assessees of Jizyah found themselves under the painful
necessity of selling their women and children to be able to pay Jizyah.
Accordingly, &lsquo;Amar bin al-&lsquo;ÂS levied collective Jizyah of thirteen
thousand dînârs on the residents of Barqah near Alexandria and gave them
the option of raising money by selling their women and children for
payment of Jizyah.<a href="#35">35</a></p>
<p>The classical jurist-theologians give us the Covenant of &lsquo;Umar,
preserved in the form of a letter submitted by the Christians of Syria
as <em>Dhimmî</em>-s to Abû &lsquo;Ubaydah, which &lsquo;Umar ratified. The letter contains
the following terms, ostensibly on behalf of the Christians:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. &rsquo;not to build in Damascus and its environs church, convent,
chapel, monk&rsquo;s hermitage;</p>
<p>2. &rsquo;not to repair what is dilapidated of our churches nor any of them
that are in Muslim quarters;</p>
<p>3. &rsquo;not to withhold our churches from Muslims stopping there by night
or day;</p>
<p>4. &rsquo;to open doors to the traveller and the wayfarer;</p>
<p>5. &rsquo;not to shelter there nor in our houses a spy, not to hide one who

<p>All the four leaders of Muslim law agree that no new construction of
places of worship by <em>Dhimmî</em>-s is permissible in cities and big towns
of <em>Dâr al-Islâm</em>. Those other than Imâm Abû Hanîfah do not permit such
construction anywhere else as well. Imâm Abû Hanîfah permits it to
scripturaries at a distance at least of one mile from the fortifications
of a town. Imâms other than Imâm AHmad ibn Hanbal permit repairs of
churches and synagogues in case their site had been gifted to the
Dhimmî-s. Ibn Hanbal appears generally to be opposed to repairs of all
kinds, though he sometimes opines otherwise also.</p>
<p>The <em>Dhimmî</em> suffered from legal disabilities as well, in matters of
testimony, criminal law, marriage, inheritance, etc. He could not
inherit from a Muslim. In the event of his wife&rsquo;s conversion, he was
required to be converted or to divorce her. If he was employed in the
army, he could get allowances but no legal share in the spoils
(<em>ghanîmah</em>).<a href="#37">37</a> Besides, there were certain extra-constitutional
disabilities and indignities to which the <em>Dhimmî</em>-s were subjected
without scruples. Muslims used to gather fruits from the former&rsquo;s
orchards and gardens, pastured their cattle on their fields, took
<em>begâr</em> from them. Zayd bin Sa&rsquo;sa&rsquo;ah told the governor of BaSrah (36-40
A.H.) that Muslims knocked at the doors of <em>Dhimmî</em>-s, and, if the doors
were not opened, broke them open, took out the coats therein, and
slaughtered them for food at will.<a href="#38">38</a> Indeed, non-Muslims found
Jizyah as the most degrading of the disabilities and indignities under
the Muslim rule. That is why many non-Muslim rulers and tribes were
prepared to open the doors of their treasuries to the Muslim armies but
shuddered to think of paying Jizyah. The offer of the Byzantine governor
to the Muslims referred to above is an instance in point. Indeed, in
history the dread of Jizyah on the part of the non-Muslims consisted in
not only the quantum of the tax and of all other discriminatory fiscal
liabilities that it implies but also and more so in its being a symbol
of utter servility and abject surrender and subjection demonstrated by
the procedure, written and unwritten, laid down for paying Jizyah and
thereby becoming a <em>Dhimmî</em>.<a href="#39">39</a></p>
<p>We have seen that sometimes liability to pay Jizyah did not cease even
after conversion. A strange phenomenon indeed. But a stranger phenomenon
is the plight of neo-Muslims even if not assessed to Jizyah. Even after
conversion to Islam, a non-Arab continued to suffer a number of
humiliations and disabilities. Under the Umayyads, no non-Arab convert
to Islam could marry an Arab girl. Under Hajjâj bin Yûsuf&rsquo;s
dispensation, no such convert could lead the prayer assembly in a mosque
in al-Kûfah, nor could he be appointed as a judge (<em>qâDî</em>). In many
matters he was ill-treated like a <em>Dhimmî</em>. Non-Arab converts to Islam
were called <em>Mawâlî</em> (singular <em>Mawlâ</em>), like manumitted slaves, who,
too, were called Mawâlî. We cannot go into details here. Suffice it to
add that, in his <em>Murawwaj adh-Dhahab</em>, Mas&rsquo;ûdî quotes a verse to the
effect that &lsquo;Whoever wants to see degradation, infamy, and disgrace
cumulatively at one place would do well to see a <em>Mawlâ</em>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Till the conquest of Mecca by the Prophet in 8 A.H., there had been no
concept of non-Muslim subjects. There were only treaties with
non-Muslims on specific terms and conditions. The idea of their
subject-hood came to the fore thereafter, with Jizyah. Non-Muslims could
become part of the protectorate under Muslims and save their life and
property to a given extent and their religion, too, to some extent by
paying Jizyah. The non-Muslims so protected, called <em>Dhimmî</em>-s, were not
citizens - yes, neither first-class citizens nor second-class citizens -
but miserable subjects of the Muslim state, with no political rights, or
even fundamental rights worth the name. Maududi writes: &lsquo;During the
times of the Prophet and the &rsquo;legitimate&rsquo; Caliphs, no example is
available of a <em>Dhimmî</em> having been appointed as a member of the
Advisory Council (<em>majlis-i shûrâ</em>), a governor of some region, a judge
of some place, a minister or administrator of some department, or a
commander of some army, or of a <em>Dhimmî</em> having been given an
opportunity to take part in the selection of a Caliph; although
<em>Dhimmî</em>-s did exist during the age of the Prophet, and during the times
of the legitimate caliphs their population ran into crores.&rsquo;<a href="#40">40</a></p>
<p>Indeed, <em>Dhimmî</em>-s were just a tolerated mass managing their own affairs
according to a schedule imposed upon them against their will.</p>
<p>There is, however, a silver lining in the dark cloud. Sometimes, Jizyah
was refunded in the event of the Muslims leaving the <em>Dhimmî</em>-s to fend
for and defend themselves against the onslaught of a superior power.
When, for example, Abû &lsquo;Ubaydah gave way to Heraclius in HimS (Syria),
he is said to have refunded the Jizyah collected by him from the
<em>Dhimmî</em>-s of the city, on the ground that he was no longer in a
position to protect them from their enemies, even though the <em>Dhimmî</em>-s
protested that they preferred the Muslims&rsquo; to the Greeks&rsquo; rule.<a href="#41">41</a>
C. H. Beeker and L. Caetani reject this story, however, on the ground
that the Arabs at that period had not the intelligence to make the
connection between tribute and protection. Caetani thinks it unlikely
that the Arabs could have collected Jizyah during the period of the
Greek occupation.<a href="#42">42</a> But Denett refers to ,an anonymous Syrian
chronicle, which tells us that during the period before the battle of
Yarmûk the tribute of Damascus as well was refunded.&rsquo;<a href="#43">43</a></p>
<p>It is also noteworthy that the Christian tribe of al-Jarâjimah in the
neighbourhood of Antioch were exempted from Jizyah and required to take
part in Jihâd.<a href="#44">44</a></p>
<p>It must, however, be borne in mind that, such exceptions apart,
<em>Dhimmî</em>-s could hardly consider it morally imperative to cooperate with
the Muslims in the latter&rsquo;s bid to exterminate the former&rsquo;s own
religions and communities. The war fought by the Muslims was far from
being an ordinary war; it was a war often against what the <em>Dhimmî</em>-s
held dear. In such a war no non-Muslim would like to side with the
Muslims, unless he chooses to turn a traitor to his own religion. And,
if the Muslims do find such a one, they would naturally welcome him.
Exemption from Jizyah is nothing compared with the stakes involved. And
the fact that the Muslims did succeed in finding such Dhimmî-s on
occasion serves to betray the amount of torture the latter must have
been subjected to, turning them practically against themselves to enable
them to heave just a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Let us wind up the discussion with a quotation from a contemporary
writer on the Islamic law of war and peace: &lsquo;The question has been
raised as to whether it is not inconsistent with Islam&rsquo;s objective,
seeking ultimate supremacy of the true religion, to accept payment in
money for persistence in unbelief. Sarkhasî<a href="#45">45</a> held that the
object is not pecuniary consideration, but the invitation of unbelievers
to Islam in the most gentle manner. By being allowed to live among
Muslims, the dhimmî-s will be attracted by the beauties of the Muslim
faith, and they may willingly accept it.&rsquo;<a href="#46">46</a></p>
