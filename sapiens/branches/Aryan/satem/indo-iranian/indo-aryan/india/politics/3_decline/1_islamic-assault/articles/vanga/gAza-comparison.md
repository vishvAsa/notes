Let us take Gaza as a unit of injustice and judge Hindus of Bangladesh by that standard.

A. How much land was taken away under the Bangladeshi state from the Hindus?

It is approximately 29 times the area of Gaza.[1]

B. How many Hindus migrated out or perished from Bangladesh in the last five decades?

It is more than 160 times that of Gazan claimed to have perished from Israeli attacks. [2] 

## Calculations 
1. The amount of land taken away from the Hindus by the Enemy Property Act till formation of Bangladesh and by the Vested Property Act after creation of Bangladesh is 26 Lakh acres (see Bangladesher Hindu by Sushupto Pathak based on Abul Barkat's statistics). It is equivalent to 10,522 sq km whereas the total area of Gaza is 365 sq km.

2. The proportion of Hindus in 1971 is estimated to be 13% in Bangladesh but now that proportion is less than 8%. The number of "missing" Hindus is in excess of 8 million. The total population if Gaza is a bit above 2 million of whom 50,000 is claimed to be dead by Al Jazeera.
