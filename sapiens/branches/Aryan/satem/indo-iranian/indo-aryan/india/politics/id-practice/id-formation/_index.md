## Failure pattern
shAstra-s, apart from broad characterizations (nAstika-s), stray references (mahAmada in bhaviShya purANa, kAlachakra-tantra of the buddhus) and racial approximations (yavana, mlechCha ...), mostly don't concern themselves with such. The counter-religions though (ranging from Indian nAstika-s to the abrahamisms), by their very nature of being "counter", are rich in opposition to natural religions. Though somewhat explicable, it was a long-standing weakness in formal analysis on the part of Hindus.

- A lack of understanding of the threat the abrahamisms contributed to the lack of common hindu fronts against muslim and other mlecCha invaders.
- Yet, some acceptance of abrahamist form and norm might have been a part of the non-military response (see hindutva site)
- Also note secularism flaws (see hindutva site) .
