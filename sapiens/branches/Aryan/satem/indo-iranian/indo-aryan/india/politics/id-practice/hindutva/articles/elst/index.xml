      <description>&lt;p&gt;An Interview With Koenraad Elst&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ramesh N. Rao, August 2002&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Details&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have reviewed one of Koenraad Elst&amp;rsquo;s books for Sulekha, and Koenraad has been mentioned in passing by many people in response to what I have written. The 43-year-old Belgian author of more than 15 books on Indian nationalism, history, politics, religious conflict and such controversial topics, spoke to me of his recent visit to the United States, where he presented a paper at the WAVES (World Association for Vedic Studies) conference, and about a wide range of issues including the Gujarat riots, the Aryan Invasion Theory, and the divide between “mainstream” scholars and “marginalized” scholars like himself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
