Portuguese did NOT rule the whole of Goa as it is today for ‘450 years’. Do see the map attached. The areas in yellow are the so-called ‘new conquests’. They were added into Portuguese territory colonised in Goa in the 18th century CE, a much later date than the original three talukas that make up the Velhas Conquistas or "Old Conquests", Salcete, Bardez and Tiswadi. 

Maximum oppression of Hindus happened in the old conquista areas, where more than 600 Hindu temples, big and small, were destroyed in less than 5 years, as documented by the Portuguese missionaries themselves.+++(5)+++ Even today, the demography of these 3 talukas is predominantly Christian, because the Hindus were either forcibly converted, or forced to migrate. 

By the time Portugal had conquered all of Goa, in the latter half of the 18th century, political situation had changed in both Portugal and Bharat. Maratha empire had emerged as a powerful force in Maharashtra, and kept a close eye on the persecution of Hindus in Goa. 

Portugal had changed too. Missionary orders like the Jesuits were actually expelled from Goa in 1759, because they were indulging in debauchery and corruption. By 1835, all Christian religious orders were banned in Goa and the Hindu majority were finally granted the freedom to practice their religion.+++(5)+++ As a result, the “New Conquests” still retained their Hindu identity, which is evident even today. 

Also, to answer your dumb second question, yes, Goa had a Hindu majority when Portuguese arrived in Goa, but also had a sizeable Muslim population, particularly in the city of Old Goa, which was completely slaughtered by Alfonso de Albuquerque when he victoriously entered the city of Old Goa on November 25th 1510. 

To put in perspective, the ‘old conquests’ that bore the most brunt of religious persecution, oppression and forcible conversions to Christianity today form an area that is about 1/5th of what Goa is today. And even today, you will see far more churches than temples in these areas. Temple destructions are well documented by the Portuguese themselves, because they were proud that they were doing ‘God’s work’.
