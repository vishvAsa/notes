      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/blog_supplement/status/1822331752037204178&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The fact that the mahAmlechcha coalition was able to engineer what it did in TSB is hopefully being taken very seriously in Indian political circles.

While those caused local pain and dented the lATesha&amp;rsquo;s plans, they did not have the ultimate outcome that they wanted. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean they have stopped or will not succeed in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
