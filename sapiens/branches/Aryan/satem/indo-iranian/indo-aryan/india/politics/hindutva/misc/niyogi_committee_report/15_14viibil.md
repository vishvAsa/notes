They have helped foreigners to rule our country, and have created a feeling of inferiority complex and internal differences.

BILASPUR

*The 19th July 1954.*

Chairman introduced the members of the committee and explained the
purpose of the enquiry and the committeeâ€™s visit.

**Shri Verma, Advocate:** Missionaries do three things mainly-conversion
by inducements of treatment in hospital, financial help, and taking
advantage of the conditions of ignorant people, scheduled caste people. 
Dr. Sukhanandonji has been converted and he has become successful
because of his conversion and the facilities given by Christians. 
Expression of wealth is shown in Dr. Sukhanandanji. It is not an
expression of religion.  Stress is laid on female education cause
thereby anti-national culture is spread in the homes.  When there was
English Raj, there was worship of English.  Now that they have gone, the
missions worship American Government.  The missions in this district are
all American. â€˜When you were hungry, America used to give food and also
now it gives money for development of your countryâ€™, say the
missionaries.  They also say that Indian leaders don t accept arms,
otherwise Indians could also have been armed as Pakistanis. I have
certain letters published by the Gass Memorial of Raipur. I will give
the issue to the committee.  In that issue it is asked where Christians
should go ultimately? There must be a Raj of their own.  Where there is
majority ff them in the neighbouring districts, they openly demand a Raj
for themselves.  They do all this with the financial support received by
them from America. All are Christians in their institutions.  In Sawra
school (Pendra Road), there was a Hindu (Brahmin) teacher.  He started
Ramayana classes in the school, because the District Inspector of School
had made a remark that all should have free access to religion they
like.

**Shri Mishra:** I joined service after passing F.A. in 1951 when
District Inspector, Mr. Mehta, remarked that Bible class is not
compulsory for all and that those who wish to attend Ramayana and Geeta,
should be given that teaching.  Bible was compulsory for all. I was
removed from service on the ground that I was an untrained teacher after
serving there for 20 years. My juniors were sent for training. I will
send their names and can also identify the persons.  When I wrote to the
authorities that I would file a suit against them, I was given Rs.
1,300. I used to teach Hindi, History and Geography.

**Shri Maqbul Massih:** His work was not satisfactory.  There were
regular reports of his coming late to school.

**Miss Shah:** I was in the school for four years from 1936 to 1940. 
The teacher was not maintaining good discipline.  He was kept in the
school, because the authorities wanted to keep some Hindu teacher.

**Shri Verma:** A popular school principal of the mission school wanted
that there should be no competitive school in Bilaspur, but the
municipal committee opened a school.  The principal created several
obstacles in the way of the school with the help of the inspecting staff
and Government officers, who were Europeans.  I had to go myself to get
recognition of the school in 1942 from Government.

**Shri Ramkrishna Pandye:** Arya Dharma Seva Sangh opened 10 hospitals
and 25 primary schools in 1945 with the object of counteracting
Christian religion and spreading Arya Samaj.  Mr. Franklin, present
D.P.I., issued a secret circular saying that no Government officer
should inspect the schools or hold examinations.  I was at the same time
asked to get the school recognised, but I did not care for that as I did
not like to get myself bound to certain rules of Government.  My boys
could get admission to middle schools on their ability being tested by
headmasters of the schools.  This is admissible under the Education
Manual.

**Trimbakrao, Pleader:** The object of missionaries in converting people
is to destroy their religion, and to denationalise them.  They also
spread the spirit of inferiority complex.  People became Christians
during famine times, not by conviction but to answer the call of their
belly.  The motive may look religious, but really speaking their motive
is political. Rajkumari Amrit Kaur was brought by local missionaries.  A
Central Minister should not do like this.

**Shri Verma:** Miss Elliot, an American, was the principal of the
Burgess Memorial School in 1949.  She did not grant holiday and observe
15th August.  Two Hindu girls reported the matter to their parents. 
They informed important persons here like Dr. Rai, President of the
municipal committee. On making a reference to Miss Elliot, she replied
that their school was governed by the American Council. Her reply and
papers in this connection are available in D.S.E.â€™s office and the
school office. This may be a case of 1948 or 1949.  Dr. Roy played a
trick and indirectly compelled Miss Elliot to take part in the functions
by declaring a holiday.

**A girl:** Through some mistake and misunderstanding, the holiday was
not declared in the morning.  But this was declared in the evening.  All
the correspondence is in the school and in the Inspectorâ€™s office.

**Kashiram Tiwari:**  My daughter was learning in Miss Mahantiâ€™s
school.  I changed the school to Burgess Mission High School.  There was
non-Christian teachers in certain mission schools.  Rev. H. R. Ferger of
Calcutta, Mr. Maqbul Massih and Myself were together. American money has
started denationalising us.  American missionaries spend money ant
Indians do prachar. In Marwahi tract a Marwariâ€™s son was ill. Doctor
demanded Rs. 100, but the missionaries helped him.  In Takhatpur there
was cholera. Nobody came to help.  The missionaries rendered help.

**Ladharam, President, Arya Samaj, Bilaspur:** There was no Christian in
Surguja before 1947.  Conversions go on with the aid of American money. 
When I was travelling in a lorry, a girl spoke that she got saree,
sandals and good dress on conversion. Her friends were from Baitalpur. 
Nawalram, and Arya Samajist from Sindh, said that his wife became ill in
1951. No action was taken in the hospital.  Missionary hospital gave
good medicine and she was cured.  My wife wanted to go to sing bhajan
and she asked me, but I did not allow her as I did not like it.

**Uttalwar of P.S.P.:** Several lakhs of rupees came from America within
four months. Two lakhs in Takhatpur for rural development.  This can be
verified from post offices.  When some help was asked by others, they
were informed that their rural development was different. 4 new churches
have been constructed.  In the name of social education, huge sums are
given.  In obstruction cases in Takhatpur, water is given.  In
Kewatdandri, Ratiramâ€™s son has been Christianed.  Money is advanced
without interest with special attention to satnamis, and advantage of
their scheduled castes is taken.  Christians helped Ratiramâ€™s son in
litigation, and now he has been converted.  In Lata also, similar things
happen. Quarrels are deliberately created and litigation is done. In
Suman Khetan, Mowhadi and Koylani, boys are tempted. Oone of the victims
is son of Bitandas.  His name is Bijhuram and another is Ramdin kachhi.

**Rev. Gurbachansingh:** Sardar Diwansingh has written an article. We
have not written any article. It has been simply reproduced. My
childrenâ€™s names are Panjabis.  My name is Panjabi. I will send the
article to the committee.

**Girlsâ€™s School:** 250 students in all. Results are always more than 90
per cent.  There is a hall with pictures of Hindu Gods where Hindu girls
can pray.  There are 27 non-christians in the boarding.  Mostly outside
girls reside who are Christian. Local girls are almost Hindus.

**Hospital:** There is a small church in the hospital.  Every day
prayers are offered before starting Work. Those who desire are allowed
to attend.  No patients are taken free. For poor Christian patients,
church makes payment. Rs. 76,000 is the annual expenditure. The hospital
is practically self-supporting. 4000 is the annual grant from church.
There are no catholic nurses. 49 nurse students. No Hindu nurse
students. None have come in spite of efforts.  Posters on walls from
bible teachings.  All nurse students are Christians.  No stipend, but
very little pocket money is given.  Books on religions other than
Christian are in the Nurses library. Dining hall for nurse students is
in Indian style.

MUNGELI

*The 20th July 1954.*

**Hospital:** A big picture painted, outside India of Jesus healing a
patient, at the entrance of the hospital building.

**Gupta from Jansangh:** Gives out a summary of what he has stated in
his application.  Mungeli is a centre, where people have been converted
in the past taking advantage of famines.  There are American
missionaries almost everywhere.  There are four of them at Mungeli. 
They say there is ghost in the top-knot.  Conversion is done through
inducement.  One Jurekha of Seetaldha expired.  The dead body was not
allowed to be taken away without paying the amount. Create confidence
towards America and disregard toward India. Christians form a circle by
themselves, forming their own servants, etc. Christians form a Mandli (a
sort Church council).  Such an atmosphere is created that people become
Christian.

**Gangaprasad Tiwari of Mungeli:** I am a Pracharak of Christianity. I
became a Christian willingly. My father is a Hindu. I became a Christian
by conviction. I do not receive any pay. Two C. I. Ds. were after me in
Surguja. God gives me money through his men.

**Nandkishore Tiwari:** I am 66. This is my only son.  He was tempted to
marry a girl. A girl was produced in my presence.  These people say that
since my only son is a Christian, I should also become a Christian; but
I do not want to change my religion at this age and I am proud of my own
religion.

**A Pracharak:** We do not give any inducement of money, women, etc.

**Sheoprasad Ojha, Mungeli:** A pastor, Sunderlal, from a church had
sent a, letter to the congress committee making certain complaints. On
30th January 1949 Gandhiji was called bad names in a church.  This
letter shows disregard of Christians towards Gandhiji.

**Massih:** Sunderlal is man who does not deserve to be kept in
service.  He has been removed from service. I do not know anything about
the incident.

**John Massih:** Laldin was requested by Sunderlal to make prayer for
Gandhijiâ€™s soul. Laldin told him that he himself was-sinner and
therefore, he could not pray for Gandhiji.  There were reports against
Sunderlal and therefore he was removed from service.

**Ramkrishna Pande:** I used to give money to Gangaprasad Tiwari. When
he goes to Bilaspur, he tells people that he is very poor and his
parents are blind.

*The 20th July 1954.*

Attendance-300.                              Villages-25

**Bhagawat Prasad:** Population of this place is about 1,000, out of
whom 20 are Christians.  Pendradi is a mission village nearby.

**Rajendralal, head of the local school:** There is a primary and a
middle school. Both Christians and non-Christians learn there. Fee is
Rs. 2-6-0 for everybody. 24 Harijans, 3 aborginals and 52 non-Christians
were in middle school last year.  Two aboriginals getting Government
scholarship; one is satnami. Eight students are free. There is no full
freeship. About 10 people are those whose fees are paid by the church.
10-30 to 11 is devotional scripture. In all, there are six teachers.  No
non-Christians teacher. I am a born Christian. All are trained teachers.
Boys from 18 villages come here.

Chairman explained the purpose of the meeting.

**Patel of Kona:** There are schools here, but nobody has been
'converted from the schools.

**Headmaster:** The boarding fee is 16 seer chawal or four seer dal.

**Sheoprasad:** There is much work of American missionaries here.  Bible
is taught for one hour, prayer of Jesus first. All photos of Jesus in
the school.  There are 4,500 Christians here.  When there is litigation,
the parties go to Padris and help them on the condition that they become
Christians.

**Ramjiwan:** In Kewatadebri Ratiramâ€™s son became Christian.

**Benimadhoji (Ratiramâ€™s son):** I have not been given any inducement. 
I have changed my religion willingly. I was thinking of doing so since
the last 15 years.  I embraced Christianity on 30 November 1952. I took
baptism openly and I had invited important persons for this. I had
printed about 600 invitations for the purpose. I am married. I have four
children.  My wifeâ€™s age may be 30 years. I had three children when I
became Christian. I was baptised by Padri Meghawaram in Kewatdebri.  He
was here for about eight years.  Before 15 years I got liking for
Christianity. There was a blind Pracharak in Baitalpur. I purchased copy
of Bible in Hindi from him. I read it and took interest in Christianity.
I became Christian after three years of the death of my father. I had
invited 550 persons for baptisma. My fatherâ€™s mahantagiri does not exist
now. I had printed a small book why I became Christian. I am educated up
to 4th class. I wrote the book myself and got it printed at Jabalpur
mission press. I distributed copies of the books to Christians only. The
name of the book is â€˜Muze Satnam aur uski Budhi Pothi Mil Gaiâ€™,
(Tahsildar to get the book and send copies to the members from the
author). I am not treated as a Mahant.

TAKHATPUR

*The 20th July 1954.*

**Abstract of applications received on tour**

 

[TABLE]

**Dr. in charge of St. Lukeâ€™s Hospital:** The hospital was established
16 years back, by the Disciples of Christ Church. It is an American
mission.  About a dozen preachers attached to this centre.  One preacher
is in charge of his own community in a village.

**Mr. Maqbul Massih:** There is a congregation of 700 spread over about
40 villages.  We have churches in villages also. Lata Church built about
12 years ago.  Kewatadabri Church built two years ago.  Third is under
construction. There is a primary school and a Hindi-English middle
school at Motimpur.  Pendradi has the largest number of Christians.  It
was purchased about 50 years ago and is mostly inhabited by Christians. 
Kewatadabri, six miles from here, is another village like this, and most
of them are born Christians. 50:50 is the proportion of Christians and
non-Christians. About 60 persons are converted during the last four
years. Perhaps, as equal number has gone back too.  Ninety-eight per
cent of the converts have come from Satnamis.  I have been working in
this area for the last 20 years. Christians are mostly agriculturists. 
I am a co-ordinator of Adhik Jiwan Yojana (Abandant Life Programme). It
is four point programme in adult literacy, public health, agriculture
and horticulture help and recreation.  My wife and I were in United
States. We were asked by our mission here and the Home Board in America
to run the programme.  Main reason for Communism is the conditions under
which people live.  They have this programme in various countries.  One
church in America became interested in this.  They give money for this. 
The money does not come through post offices. It comes through banks. 
The American church undertook to send 10,000 dollars a year or roughly
Rs. 45,000.  Our main church is in Jabalpur.  This is for Madhya
Pradesh. 38,000 has been used in Takhatpur.  We pay salaries to our
workers out of this fund.  They are known as Gaonsathis.  We get all our
material from Allahabad Literacy House and from Jamia Milia from Delhi. 
In the library, you will not find a single Christian Book.  The main
interest is building a defence against Communism.  In recreation,
workers are provided with volley ball, kabaddi, etc. We have over nine
villagers active in 12 villages.  We go to the patel and influential
persons n a village and we tell them that this is our programme.  In
most places the patel himself has given a room.  We have no
non-Christian workers.  We have got forms for survey, certificate, etc. 
We have a standard by which we declare workers.  No local contribution
has yet come.  We are not asked for it.  We do not distribute money, but
we give payment of salary. I am in charge of the scheme.  We have up
till now engaged Christians. I attended certain seminars in America. 
They have a country agent in each.  Six weeks is the time of the period
of training.  Matriculate boys get Rs. 40 and dearness allowance of Rs.
30 as our teachers.  For, 10th pass we give Rs. 60.  We encourage them
to study further.  Persons are employed while under training, and they
continue even after that.  In all, about 25 persons are working on the
staff.  I do not know that will happen after five years when American
help will he stopped.  We hope the people under the scheme will be able
to carry on after five years independent. We were not able to give them
special training in public health. Dr. Donald T. Rice from Damoh is
coming here to impart instructions in that. He was trained in America in
public health.  The mission board which gives the money is the
University Christian Church in Seattle.  We are going to have preventive
things-instructions on sanitation.  Dr. Rice will be here one week. He
will give instructions and practical working, in combating of epidemics,
hook worm, etc. My wife is in charge of literacy.  She was principal of
a Hindu school in Agra for a number of years.  We have no Communists in
our part. I spoke to Deputy Commissioner before starting my scheme.  We
do not mix religion with this programme.

Chairman explained the purpose of the Committee and requested the people
to live peacefully and in co-operation.

**Shri Otalwar:** Contradicts statements made by Shri Massih.  The chief
of the mission is not Massih, but some Europeans and Americans.  We have
given names of these persons.  One American woman is in charge of this
area.  Five new churches are being constructed.  We have given details
of them.  The Committee should inspect Mahajan Fund, Tahkhana, below
office building. Ornaments are kept in this.  Money is lent, and when
they are unable to pay, they are converted. Gold was sold from this
Tahkhanan by Macforger Padri and it was not recorded in the books.  He
sold gold of the value of Rs. 2,000.  Armoury may also be kept in
Tahkana. Full details of the villages, and their roads are kept by these
foreign missionaries.  There is an increase in the amount being received
from 1950 from America.  Tourists from America had come here from 1945. 
I do not know whether Takhatpur is a place for tourists.  Why should
tourists come to Lata and Kewatadabri.  Ratiram's son was promised that
he would be taken to America, but he wants that his wife should also be
taken to America.  They do not want to take her.  Persons embracing
Christianity again come back to Hinduism.  This shows that they do hot
become Christian by conviction.  In Motimpur they convert people and
create quarrels.  They also influence Government officers.  The
foundation stone of this hospital was laid by R. B. Chandorkar and
Government paid Rs. 10,000 to the hospital.  I heard prayers myself in
the hospital.  In Nawapara Mouza Jewra there was fire and famine. 
Mission went there and asked those people to become Christian first and
then they would be given help.  Macgowan took help with him, but first
condition for help was conversion.  American mission is spreading
bitterness amongst communities on a large scale.  You can get enquiries
made by C. I. D. of the missions working secretly here. 90 per cent of
the patients are given medicine only if they undertake to become
Christians.  Manglu from Tihla was a patient of Garmi.  He was asked to
become Christian and he agreed.  After seven injections he was asked
finally and he became christian, after which he got 8th injection. 
There is 'a hospital here where a family has been admitted only on
conversion.  It is learnt that America gives 500 per person converted. 
Tunganâ€™s land has been forcibly taken for church in kewatadabri.  No
Government official or non-official has been taken in the Abundant Life
Programme. Work has been started in 18 villages and there is a man and a
woman in each village.  Discrimination between Christian and
non-Christian patients, in regard to medicines which have come to them
free of taxes.  There is also a Philadelphia Fund.  If a patient does
not become Christian, he is not so much cared for in the case of
satnamis and poor persons.  Two annas per person recovered from
non-Christians.  One family has been converted in Takhatpur recently. 
Grant has been given by Government to Motimpur high school and it has
not been given to the school opened by general public of Takhatpur. 
There are communists in Janjgir and Akaltara, but there is no communist
in Takhatpur.  Then why work for fighting them? Christians were the best
opponents of Congress in Pendra Road in Kota constituency. All of them
said that they will act according to the wishes of Padri.  They have got
a strict discipline.  Padri commands them and their works. There are
about three to four dozen Christians in this centre.  They should take
us on their committees, and there should be audit of accounts.
Government should break the iron curtain in Takhatpur.

**Tularam Pracharak:** Because Hindus do not get good treatment, they
become Christians.  I tried to find out the reasons for calling
Satnamis. I became a Christian in Lata. I came to Sam Padri, and got
myself converted.  Before getting converted, I tried to learn the
principles of Christianity. I get Rs. 85. as pay. My age is 45.

**Govind of Bhatni:** I became Satnami from Christianity.  I did not get
cultivation that was promised to me and, therefore, I came back to
Hinduism again. I changed my name from Masi to Masidas. Now, we are
allowed to take part in religious activities.  Formely, they did not
allow.  Satnamis are now using Janava and Chandan and there is not so
much bad treatment as before.

**Tungan:** MacGower has deprived me of my house and I was told that, if
I became a Christian, I could get the land. 

Budhu and Amoldas of Kewatdabri have been tempted, of giving beautiful
girls.

**Mr. Massih:** Moneylending is done from out of current fund. I do not
know how much about it.

April.  We do not take anything from patients.  In private wards the
patients may spend anything. Rs. 9-12-0 is spent by the mission and Rs.
10 is given by Government.  London is the headquarter of the mission. 
Money is received quarterly from there.  There are about 30 members on
the staff. They are all Christians.  At the request of individual
patients, pastors go to them.

The leper home was visited.  It was told that church is fundamental. 
The management is under a pastor.  One (non-Christian) patient was given
chloroform or certain operation today.  When he came to conscience, he
was saying â€˜Oh Jesus, where are youâ€™.

------------------------------

PENDRA ROAD

*The 21st July 1954.*

There are three institutions run by missionaries here-Girlsâ€™ school with
boarding, one primary school, and one dispensary. There are 150 girls in
Suman Khetan (including primary school) boarding. Majority are
Christians.  There is no non-Christian school staff, but the sanatorium
has non-christian staff.  There are three Pracharaks at Pendra Road. 
The castes living here are Gond, Panka, Bhaina, Teli, Ahir and Harijans.

Chairman explained the purpose of the meeting, and object of the
enquiry.

**Jaiswal:** I was a teacher for three years in mission school. I was
appointed in place of Mishra (the one who complained at Bilaspur).  My
pay is Rs. 35 plus Rs. 8 dearness allowance.  Others (Christians) get
Rs. 30 as dearness allowance. I was influenced to marry a girl here, who
was a teacher in the school; but I refused.  D. I. S. Mehta had remarked
that I should be sent for training, but the headmaster, Mr. Arthur did
not send my name in spite of his promise.  This I knew from Bilaspur
through unofficial sources.  He wanted that I should become a Christian
before going for training.  This was in 1932. I was in service for three
years.  Other servants from non-Christians were employed in the school
for a few months.  After that they were asked to become Christians or
else they were to lose their jobs. During the period I was in the
school, there was no conversion of boys to my knowledge. I had not given
any application regarding my rejection for training.

**Shri Arthur:** If had recommended Jaiswalâ€™s application but he was not
selected.  Therefore I was helpless. I had sent his name to the D. I. S.
I never asked him to become Christian.  Mr. Mehta did write about Geeta
and Ramayana classes and I asked Mr. Mishra to hold the class, but he
was never regular for the class. The class had, therefore, to be
closed.  His work was not satisfactory, and therefore, he was removed
from service. His being relieved from service, has nothing to do with
conducting Ramayana classes. Unless we have a Hindu teacher on the staff
we cannot have these classes.  But if the D. I. S. wants that to be
done, we will have no objection.  We have no bible teaching.  There is
also no special period for moral teaching.  That is taught along with
other lessons.

**Shri Ramkrishna Pandye:** People from surrounding villages have no
intimation of the committeeâ€™s visit to this place.  We do not want that
those institutions which receive Government grant, should make Prachar
of Christianity.  A Christian brought recommendation from Dr.
Sukhanandan of Mungeli on the 7th July and he was admitted to the
hospital.  Shri Francis says that Dr. Sukhanandan is not in India at
present.

**Shri M. R. Konher:** Thoke Pleaderâ€™s son, M. K. Thoke, a T. B. patient
from Bemetara, had complained to Government that there is no good
treatment to non-Christian patients in 1948-49.  He was turned out of
the sanatorium for this and he died in 1950-51.

**Shri Massih:** There is no truth in the statement that T. B. patients
are asked to become Christians.  The figures themselves would prove
this. There was some trouble in 1950-51 of which an enquiry was made by
Government.

**Yunus pracharak:** We have no hatred for any religion.  During the
last 30 years in Jyotipur church I have not heard or seen a single
baptisma, except only one man who had come from outside.

**Shri Ganeshprasad:** A Christian Gentleman said that there will be
Christian Raj as there is Pakistan. We shall give proof of it in due
course.

Tarachand of Torwa, Bilaspur (in the evening, questions put by the
**Chairman at the request of Swami Ramanuj Saraswati**): On 3rd
September 1953 I was admitted to the sanatorium. As some of my relative
had expired at that time, I had no hair on my head and I looked a pucca
Hindu. Kanny Ruth, a woman missionary, comes to the sanatorium and
introduces herself by distributing copies of Bible, etc. She says
â€˜sachha rasta dikhanewala yahi rasta haiâ€™. They gave me good treatment. 
They demanded Rs. 7,000 for recreation club from me.  I demanded part in
the management, which was refused. I was discharged from the sanatorium
on 7th February 1954.  All entertainment programmes in the sanatorium
are regarding Christian religion. I left sanatorium of my own accord,
and therefore, perhaps they are not on good terms with me.

CHAMPA

*The 22nd July 1954.*

Chairman explained the purpose of the meeting.

**Girdharilal of Raipur. -** There is a fear in the minds of the lepers
that revenge will be taken. I was a patient in the leper home. A drama
was staged in 1950 in which Vishwamitra pays homage to Jesus. I was in
Baitalpur (Chandkhuri hospital). I was a paying patient there.  There
are about four to five hundred patients in Ghogranala.  The drama was
perhaps written and not printed. It was staged by patients.  Mr.
Balkrishna (7) Joshi acted in the drama.  Permission has to be sought
for bhajan in the hospital. Ramayana was burnt and sacred threads
destroyed in the hospital.  Printed pamphlet submitted with the
application, is read out.  Seventeen boys went away from the Champa
hospital and complained to Mr. Bahel, the then Deputy Commissioner. Dr.
Johnson requested Dr. Khanapurkar to get mutual transfer with Dr.
Waghmare, who is a Christian.

**Dr. Shantilal Gopal. -** I am a private medical practitioner.
Duty-free medicines are given to the mission. I was president of the
municipal committee twice. Sales tax and income-tax is not charged on
these. I am speaking of the general mission hospital. It was first free,
then 1 anna registration fee, and later charging fees of the medicines. 
They do not pass receipts for payment received by them.  There are no
accounts of these hospitals. 100 indoor and 100 outdoor patients.  There
is only one doctor.  There are no qualified men in the hospital.  There
is much income from the hospital.  It may have been utilised for some
other purpose.  Registration ice is recovered from non-Christians and
Christians are free. All staff is Christian.  When children are asked by
the parents, very high charges are demanded.  Advantage is taken of the
circumstances in which patients are placed. A dead body was refused to
be given unless Rs. 10 were paid. There is no mortuary. The father of
the son will be able to show the room Rs. 2 is microscopic charge and
Re. 1 may be room rent.  He died within 15 minutes of arrival. The body
was given without taking any charge when I threatened to break open the
locks.  The leper home is very near the town.  The expenditure is not
Rs. 10 as given by the Government and there is a saving of Rs. 3 per
bed.  During election time I was not allowed to see the patients in the
leper home.  My account of expenditure is guess work.

**Girdarilal of Champa. -** Thulsipujan is not allowed.  The word â€˜Ramâ€™
is not allowed to be uttered.  Some persons were watering a pipal tree. 
Christians laughed at the idea and got the tree destroyed.  Lakhandasâ€™s
copy of Ramayan has been burnt.  For reading of Ramayan I was troubled.

**One gentleman. -** Three women carrying books about Jesus move from
house to house and distribute them.

**Rajnikant. -** A man with Bhagwa Vastra used to come and ask people to
have faith in Jesus. He used to pour oil drops in ears, etc.

**A newspaper dealer. -** A person to whom I sell newspapers asked for
some other papers and I showed him Yugdharma. There was statement of Dr.
Katju giving figures of Christians.  He said it was wrong. Then he saw a
statement of Tukdoji and said it was all false.

**Dr. Theodore. -** I have been living here since 12 years. I have not
seen a single sacred thread being broken or Ramayana being burnt.
Christians are required to pay fees in hospital. The information given
about 17 boys is that there were certain hours in which time they must
take bath so that it should be convenient to girls. The boys opposed
this and next day they left the home and went out.  The Deputy
Commissioner was also coming by the way the next day and he listened to
it and asked the boys to go to the school.  Some of the boys are even
now in the boarding.  Account of hospital is maintained by an Indian
doctor.

There is no religion or caste in Ghogranala. Raut is husband and Ghasni
is wife.  Also husband is Brahmin and wife is of some other caste. I was
president of the municipal committee and I tried to bring Government
help to Ghogranala .99 per cent of the people are those who have been
driven out of some one or the other leper homes.

Chairman thanked the audience and requested them to live peacefully like
brothers.

GHOGRANALA

*The 22nd July 1954.*

While taking a round of the Mission leper home, the Chairman and members
went to have a look at the Ghogranala colony.  Some questions were put
to the persons present (about 200).  Out of 500 persons in the basti,
150 are Christians.

**Bhakla Satnami. -** Ramayana was not allowed to be read in leper home.
Some sahebs had come some time back. They found me reading Ramayana. 
They asked me to stop reading Ramayana.

**Kundru Suryawanshi. -** We have maintained our religion these days.

A scuffle arose when hot words were exchanged between Dr. Theodore and
some other local Hindu gentlemen.  From another corner came a Christian
gentleman shouting, who was surrounded by persons of Hindu faith and the
gathering ended in halla balla.

The committee paid a visit to primary school, leper home and general
hospital at Champa.

------------------------------

KORBA

*The 23nd July 1954.*

About 200 people had assembled at korba. The chairman explained the
object of the State Government in setting up the enquiry committee and
requested the people to submit orally or in writing what they have to
say regarding activities of missionaries.  There were no representations
either from the Christians or non-Christians.

(Only one application from one Ramnath was received later wherein he
complaints against the missionaries that they do not give him any work).
