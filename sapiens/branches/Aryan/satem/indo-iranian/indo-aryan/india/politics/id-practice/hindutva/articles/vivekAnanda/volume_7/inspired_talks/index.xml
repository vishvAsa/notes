WALDO (A DISCIPLE)&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;WEDNESDAY, &lt;em&gt;June 19, 1895&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;This day marks the beginning of the regular teaching given daily by&#xA;Swami Vivekananda to his disciples at Thousand Island Park. We had not&#xA;yet all assembled there, but the Master&amp;rsquo;s heart was always in his work,&#xA;so he commenced at once to teach the three or four who were with him. He&#xA;came on this first morning with the Bible in his hand and opened to the&#xA;Book of John, saying that since we were all Christians, it was proper&#xA;that he should begin with the Christian scriptures&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;recorded-by-miss-s-e-waldo-a-disciple&#34;&gt;RECORDED BY MISS S. E. WALDO (A DISCIPLE)&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;SUNDAY, &lt;em&gt;June 23, 1895&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Be brave and be sincere; then follow any path with devotion, and you&#xA;&lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; reach the Whole. Once lay hold of one link of the chain, and the&#xA;whole chain must come by degrees. Water the roots of the tree (that is,&#xA;reach the Lord), and the whole tree is watered; getting the Lord, we get&#xA;all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One-sidedness is the bane of the world. The more sides you can develop&#xA;the more souls you have, and you can see the universe through all souls&#xA;— through the Bhakta (devotee) and the Jnāni (philosopher). Determine&#xA;your own nature and stick to it. Nishthā (devotion to one ideal) is the&#xA;only method for the beginner; but with devotion and sincerity it will&#xA;lead to all. Churches, doctrines, forms, are the hedges to protect the&#xA;tender plant, but they must later be broken down that the plant may&#xA;become a tree. So the various religions, Bibles, Vedas, dogmas — all are&#xA;just tubs for the little plant; but it must get out of the tub. Nishthā&#xA;is, in a manner, placing the plant in the tub, shielding the struggling&#xA;soul in its path. . . .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

(&lt;em&gt;The reading today was from the Bhakti-Sutras&#xA;by Nārada&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Extreme love to God is Bhakti, and this love is the real immortality,&#xA;getting which a man becomes perfectly satisfied, sorrows for no loss,&#xA;and is never jealous; knowing which man becomes mad.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My Master used to say, &amp;ldquo;This world is a huge lunatic asylum where all&#xA;men are mad, some after money, some after women, some after name or&#xA;fame, and a few after God. I prefer to be mad after God. God is the&#xA;philosophers&amp;rsquo; stone that turns us to gold in an instant; the form&#xA;remains, but the nature is changed — the human form remains, but no more&#xA;can we hurt or sin.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The&#xA;more advanced the soul, the more quickly does one follow the other.&#xA;&lt;em&gt;What we want is neither happiness nor misery&lt;/em&gt;. Both make us forget our&#xA;true nature; both are chains — one iron, one gold; behind both is the&#xA;Atman, who knows neither happiness nor misery. These are &lt;em&gt;states&lt;/em&gt; and&#xA;states must ever change; but the nature of the Soul is bliss, peace,&#xA;unchanging. We have not to get it, we have it; only wash away the dross&#xA;and see it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

All great geniuses know this. Let us open&#xA;ourselves to the one Divine Actor, and let Him act, and do nothing&#xA;ourselves. &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;O Arjuna! I have no duty in the whole world&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;, says&#xA;Krishna. Be perfectly resigned, perfectly unconcerned; then alone can&#xA;you do any true work. No eyes can see the real forces, we can only see&#xA;the results. Put out self, lose it, forget it; just let God work, it is&#xA;His business. We have nothing to do but stand aside and let God work.&#xA;The more we go away, the more God comes in. Get rid of the little &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo;,&#xA;and let only the great &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; live.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

(&lt;em&gt;The Swami brought the New Testament this&#xA;morning and talked again on the book of John&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mohammed claimed to be the &amp;ldquo;Comforter&amp;rdquo; that Christ promised to send. He&#xA;considered it unnecessary to claim a supernatural birth for Jesus. Such&#xA;claims have been common in all ages and in all countries. All great men&#xA;have claimed gods for their fathers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

(&lt;em&gt;The entire party went on a picnic for the&#xA;day, and although the Swami taught constantly, as he did wherever he&#xA;was, no notes were taken and no record, therefore, of what he said&#xA;remains. As he began his breakfast before setting out, however, he&#xA;remarked:&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Be thankful for all food, it is Brahman. His universal energy is&#xA;transmuted into our individual energy and helps us in all that we do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

(&lt;em&gt;The Swami came this morning with a Gita in&#xA;his hand&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Krishna, the &amp;ldquo;Lord of souls&amp;rdquo;, talks to Arjuna or Gudākesha, &amp;ldquo;lord of&#xA;sleep&amp;rdquo; (he who has conquered sleep). The &amp;ldquo;field of virtue&amp;rdquo; (the&#xA;battlefield) is this world; the five brothers (representing&#xA;righteousness) fight the hundred other brothers (all that we love and&#xA;have to contend against); the most heroic brother, Arjuna (the awakened&#xA;soul), is the general. We have to fight all sense-delights, the things&#xA;to which we are most attached, to kill them. We have to stand alone; we&#xA;are Brahman, all other ideas must be merged in this one.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We cannot think &amp;ldquo;mammalia&amp;rdquo; without a concrete example. So with&#xA;the idea of God.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The great abstraction of ideas in the world is what we call God.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Each thought has two parts — the thinking and the word; and we must have&#xA;both. Neither idealists nor materialists are right; we must take both&#xA;idea and expression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

(&lt;em&gt;Shri Ramakrishna Deva&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Shri Ramakrishna was the son of a very orthodox Brahmin, who would&#xA;refuse even a gift from any but a special caste of Brahmins; neither&#xA;might he work, nor even be a priest in a temple, nor sell books, nor&#xA;serve anyone. He could only have &amp;ldquo;what fell from the skies&amp;rdquo; (alms), and&#xA;even then it must not come through a &amp;ldquo;fallen&amp;rdquo; Brahmin. Temples have no&#xA;hold on the Hindu religion; if they were all destroyed, religion would&#xA;not be affected a grain. A man must only build a house for &amp;ldquo;God and&#xA;guests&amp;rdquo;, to build for himself would be selfish; therefore he erects&#xA;temples as dwelling places for God.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

(&lt;em&gt;The Divine Mother&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Shāktas worship the Universal Energy as Mother, the sweetest name they&#xA;know; for the mother is the highest ideal of womanhood in India. When&#xA;God is worshipped as &amp;ldquo;Mother&amp;rdquo;, as Love, the Hindus call it the&#xA;&amp;ldquo;right-handed&amp;rdquo; way, and it leads to spirituality but never to material&#xA;prosperity. When God is worshipped on His terrible side, that is, in the&#xA;&amp;ldquo;left-handed&amp;rdquo; way, it leads usually to great material prosperity, but&#xA;rarely to spirituality; and eventually it leads to degeneration and the&#xA;obliteration of the race that practices it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Christ, being man, had to see&#xA;impurity and denounced it; but God, infinitely higher, does not see&#xA;iniquity and cannot be angry. Denunciation is never the highest. David&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;hands were smeared with blood; he could not build the temple. (Bible,&#xA;Samuel, Chap. XVII — end.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

They&#xA;have died out now, and most of their books are lost. They claimed that&#xA;the soul, being the product of the body and its forces, died with it;&#xA;that there was no proof of its further existence. They denied&#xA;inferential knowledge accepting only perception by the senses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

According to Shankara, there are two phases of the universe,&#xA;one is I and the other thou; and they are as contrary as light and&#xA;darkness, so it goes without saying that neither can be derived from the&#xA;other. On the subject, the object has been superimposed; the subject is&#xA;the only reality, the other a mere appearance. The opposite view is&#xA;untenable.

As man, he is a machine with an idea of freedom; but&#xA;this human body is the best and the human mind the highest mind there&#xA;is. When a man attains to the Atman state, he can take a body, making it&#xA;to suit himself; he is above law. This is a statement and must be&#xA;proved. Each one must prove it for himself; we may satisfy ourselves,&#xA;but we cannot satisfy another. Rāja-Yoga is the only science of religion&#xA;that can be demonstrated; and only what I myself have proved by&#xA;experience, do I teach. The full ripeness of reason is intuition, but&#xA;intuition cannot antagonise reason.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Nothing is entirely&#xA;physical, nor yet entirely metaphysical; one presupposes the other and&#xA;explains the other. All Theists agree that there is a background to this&#xA;visible universe, they differ as to the nature or character of that&#xA;background. Materialists say there is no background.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In all religions the superconscious state is identical. Hindus,&#xA;Christians, Mohammedans, Buddhists, and even those of no creed, all have&#xA;the very same experience when they transcend the body. . . .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

To think that mind is a simple, single, or independent is&#xA;dualism. Philosophy is not got by studying books; the more you read&#xA;books, the more muddled becomes the mind. The idea of unthinking&#xA;philosophers was that the mind was a simple, and this led them to&#xA;believe in free-will. Psychology, the analysis of the mind, shows the&#xA;mind to be a compound, and every compound must be held together by some&#xA;outside force; so the will is bound by the combination of outside&#xA;forces. Man cannot even will to eat unless he is hungry. Will is subject&#xA;to desire. But we are free; everyone feels it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The highest abstraction in which all things agree is the&#xA;One. In religion we have first, symbols and forms; next, mythologies;&#xA;and last, philosophy. The first two are for the time being; philosophy&#xA;is the underlying basis of all, and the others are only stepping stones&#xA;in the struggle to reach the Ultimate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

When the English go there, these women carry large men up&#xA;the mountains.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Malabar, although of course polyandry does not obtain there, the&#xA;women lead in everything. Exceptional cleanliness is apparent everywhere&#xA;and there is the greatest impetus to learning. When I myself was in that&#xA;country, I met many women who spoke good Sanskrit, while in the rest of&#xA;India not one woman in a million can speak it. Mastery elevates, and&#xA;servitude debases. Malabar has never been conquered either by the&#xA;Portuguese or by the Mussulmans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

All happiness and&#xA;misery are inextricably connected with the senses, and body is necessary&#xA;to experience them. The higher the body, the higher the standard of&#xA;virtue, even up to Brahma; but all have bodies. As long as there is a&#xA;body, there must be pleasure and pain; only when one has got rid of the&#xA;body can one escape them. The Atman is bodiless, says Shankara.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Advaita, on the contrary, affirms that&#xA;Purushas can be only One, that Purusha cannot be conscious, unconscious,&#xA;or have any qualification, for either these qualities would bind, or&#xA;they would eventually cease; so the One must be without any qualities,&#xA;even knowledge, and It cannot be the cause of the universe or of&#xA;anything. &amp;ldquo;In the beginning, existence only, One without a second&amp;rdquo;, says&#xA;the Vedas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The vapour becomes snow, then water, then Ganga; but when it&#xA;is vapour, there is no Ganga, and when it is water, we think of no&#xA;vapour in it. The idea of creation or change is inseparably connected&#xA;with will. So long as we perceive this world in motion, we have to&#xA;conceive will behind it. Physics proves the utter delusion of the&#xA;senses; nothing really is as ever see, hear, feel, smell, taste it.&#xA;Certain vibrations producing certain results affect our senses; we know&#xA;only relative truth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

(&lt;em&gt;Patanjali&amp;rsquo;s Yoga Aphorisms&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yoga&lt;/em&gt; is the science of restraining the Chitta (mind) from breaking&#xA;into Vrittis (modifications). Mind is a mixture of sensation and&#xA;feelings, or action and reaction; so it cannot be permanent. The mind&#xA;has a fine body and through this it works on the gross body. Vedanta&#xA;says that behind the mind is the real Self. It accepts the other two,&#xA;but posits a third, the Eternal, the Ultimate, the last analysis, the&#xA;unit, where there is no further compound. Birth is &lt;em&gt;re&lt;/em&gt;-composition,&#xA;death is &lt;em&gt;de&lt;/em&gt;-composition, and the final analysis is where Atman is&#xA;found; there being no further division possible, the perdurable is&#xA;reached.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

(&lt;em&gt;Bhagavad-Gita, Karma-Yoga&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To attain liberation through work, join yourself to work but without&#xA;desire, looking for no result. Such work leads to knowledge, which in&#xA;turn brings emancipation. To give up work before you &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt;, leads to&#xA;misery. Work done for the Self gives no bondage. Neither desire pleasure&#xA;nor fear pain from work. It is the mind and body that work, not I. Tell&#xA;yourself this unceasingly and realise it. Try not to know that you work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

WALDO (A DISCIPLE)&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;WEDNESDAY, &lt;em&gt;July 24, 1895&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The powers acquired by the practice of Yoga are not obstacles for the&#xA;Yogi who is perfect, but are apt to be so for the beginner, through the&#xA;wonder and pleasure excited by their exercise. Siddhis are the powers&#xA;which mark success in the practice; and they may be produced by various&#xA;means, such as the repetition of a Mantra, by Yoga practice, meditation,&#xA;fasting, or even by the use of herbs and drugs. The Yogi, who has&#xA;conquered all interest in the powers acquired and who renounces all&#xA;virtue arising from his actions, comes into the &amp;ldquo;cloud of virtue&amp;rdquo; (name&#xA;of one of the states of Samadhi) and radiates holiness as a cloud rains&#xA;water.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The&#xA;Brahmachārin must be sexually pure in thought, word, and deed. Lose&#xA;regard for the body; get rid of the consciousness of it so far as&#xA;possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Âsana (posture) must be steady and pleasant; and constant practice,&#xA;identifying the mind with the Infinite, will bring this about.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Neti, neti (&amp;ldquo;Not this, not this&amp;rdquo;) is all that can be said, for&#xA;even to think is to limit and so to lose.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We really answer our own prayers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is blasphemy to think that if Jesus had never been born, humanity&#xA;would not have been saved. It is horrible to forget thus the divinity in&#xA;human nature, a divinity that must come out. Never forget the glory of&#xA;human nature. We are the greatest God that ever was or ever will be.&#xA;Christs and Buddhas are but waves on the boundless ocean which &lt;em&gt;I am&lt;/em&gt;.&#xA;Bow down to nothing but your own higher Self. Until you know that you&#xA;are that very God of gods, there will never be any freedom for you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Atheists and materialists can have ethics, but&#xA;only believers in the Lord can have religion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The wicked pay the price of the great soul&amp;rsquo;s holiness. Think of that&#xA;when you see a wicked man. Just as the poor man&amp;rsquo;s labour pays for the&#xA;rich man&amp;rsquo;s luxury, so is it in the spiritual world. The terrible&#xA;degradation of the masses in India is the price nature pays for the&#xA;production of great souls like Mirā-bāi, Buddha, etc.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He&#xA;is the channel through which the spiritual current flows to us, the link&#xA;which joins us to the whole spiritual world. Too much faith in&#xA;personality has a tendency to produce weakness and idolatry, but intense&#xA;love for the Guru makes rapid growth possible, he connects us with the&#xA;internal Guru. Adore your Guru if there be real truth in him; that&#xA;Guru-bhakti (devotion to the teacher) will quickly lead you to the&#xA;highest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

If I am all, why can I not really and actively sympathise&#xA;with my brother and see with his eyes? While I am weak, I must stick to&#xA;one course (Nishthā), but when I am strong, I can feel with every other&#xA;and perfectly sympathise with his ideas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The modern American&#xA;boy takes twenty-five years to attain that which his forefathers took&#xA;hundreds of years to do. The present-day Hindu gets in twenty years to&#xA;the height reached in eight thousand years by his ancestors. On the&#xA;physical side, the embryo goes from the amoeba to man in the womb. These&#xA;are the teachings of modern science. Vedanta goes further and tells us&#xA;that we not only have to live the life of all past humanity, but also&#xA;the future life of all humanity. The man who does the first is the&#xA;educated man, the second is the Jivanmukta, for ever free (even while&#xA;living).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;recorded-by-miss-s-e-waldo-a-disciple&#34;&gt;RECORDED BY MISS S. E. WALDO (A DISCIPLE)&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;TUESDAY, &lt;em&gt;August 6, 1895&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Without the &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; there can be no &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rdquo; outside. From this some&#xA;philosophers came to the conclusion that the external world did not&#xA;exist save in the subject; that the &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rdquo; existed only in the &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;Others have argued that the &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; can only be known through the &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rdquo; and&#xA;with equal logic. These two views are partial truths, each wrong in part&#xA;and each right in part. Thought is as much material and as much in&#xA;nature as body is. Both matter and mind exist in a third, a unity which&#xA;divides itself into the two. This unity is the Atman, the real Self.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
