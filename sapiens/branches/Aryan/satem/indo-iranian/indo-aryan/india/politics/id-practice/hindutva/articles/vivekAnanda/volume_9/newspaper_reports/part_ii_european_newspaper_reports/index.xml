Many of the public also associated the lecturer with the&#xA;Theosophical Society, with which, however, he has, we are informed,&#xA;nothing whatever to do, nor with any other society, neither does he&#xA;propose forming any society himself. He believes in expounding his views&#xA;to whoever will listen to them and leaving those individuals to advocate&#xA;them as a whole, or with whatever modifications they may deem fitting,&#xA;or to reject them altogether, believing that out of the strife of all&#xA;opinions truth at length prevails.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The opening passages&#xA;of the lecture were a review of the rise of the grosser form of&#xA;Materialism in the beginning of the present century, and the later&#xA;development of the various forms of metaphysical thought, which for a&#xA;time swept materialism away. From this he passed on to discuss the&#xA;origin and nature of knowledge. In some respects his views on this point&#xA;were almost a statement of pure Fichteism, but they were expressed in&#xA;language, and they embodied illustrations, and made admissions which no&#xA;German transcendentalist would have used. He admitted there was a gross&#xA;material world outside, but he confessed he did not know what matter&#xA;was. He asserted that mind was a finer matter, and that behind was the&#xA;soul of man, which was immovable, fixed, before which outward objects&#xA;passed, as it were, in a procession, which was without beginning or end&#xA;— in other words, which was eternal, and finally which was God. He&#xA;worked out this pantheistic conception of the personal identity of man&#xA;and God with great comprehensiveness and an ample wealth of&#xA;illustration, and in passage after passage of great beauty, solemnity,&#xA;and earnestness. &amp;ldquo;There is only one Soul in the Universe&amp;rdquo;, he said:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Cf. the&#xA;preceding newspaper report &lt;a href=&#34;standard_oct_23_1895.htm&#34;&gt;&amp;lsquo;An Indian&#xA;Ascetic&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt; , pp 515-16, for another report of&#xA;the same lecture, delivered October 22, 1895.) A Yogi, it was explained,&#xA;is one who formally renounces the world and gives himself up to study&#xA;and devotion. Swami Vivekananda originally left his native land for the&#xA;purpose of giving his interpretation of the Vedanta philosophy at the&#xA;Parliament of Religions which was held two years ago at Chicago, and&#xA;since that time he has been engaged in delivering lectures on the same&#xA;subject in America. In the course of his address last night he declared&#xA;that there were indications in these closing days of the 19th century&#xA;that the pendulum of scientific thought was swinging back, for men all&#xA;over the world were rummaging in the pages of ancient records, and&#xA;ancient religious forms were again coming to the fore. To many this&#xA;seemed to be a case of degeneration, while others regarded it as one of&#xA;those outbursts of superstition which periodically visited society, but&#xA;to the scientific student there was in the present state of things a&#xA;prognostication of grand future benefit. The lecturer then proceeded at&#xA;considerable length to describe the peculiar system of philosophy which&#xA;he teaches, and traced the three different stages of the religion which&#xA;has grown out of it. He spoke with a good deal of fluency, and his&#xA;remarks were listened to with attention by the somewhat small audience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But the essence of true&#xA;Christianity is that, if your actions are inspired by the heavenly&#xA;kingdom within you, Paradise will be the result, whereas, if you act in&#xA;harmony with the devil&amp;rsquo;s kingdom without you will land in Perdition. The&#xA;genuine Christian does not, as the Swami seemed to suggest, act for the&#xA;purpose of evading punishments, but at the same time he sees the&#xA;ultimate consequences of all actions. . . .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There was no radical&#xA;impossibility of reconciliation between sects, now biting and devouring&#xA;each other from the best motives, if charity and sympathy were carried&#xA;into the kiosque, the temple, and the church. Canon Basil Wilberforce&#xA;and the Rev. H. R. Haweis both made interesting speeches in reply to the&#xA;Swami. . . . The guests numbered 150.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Cf. the Indian newspaper&#xA;report &lt;a href=&#34;../part_iii_indian_newspaper_reports/10_the_indian_mirror_jun_19_1896.htm&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;On&#xA;Education&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;,&#xA;p. 535 .) in which he urged that no one could obtain intellectual&#xA;greatness until he was physically pure. Morality gave strength; the&#xA;immoral were always weak, and could never raise themselves&#xA;intellectually, much less spiritually. Directly [as] immorality began&#xA;to enter the national life its foundations commenced to rot. As the life&#xA;blood of every nation was to be found in the schools, where boys and&#xA;girls were receiving their education, it was absolutely essential that&#xA;the young students should be pure, and this purity must be taught them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We hoped this, because the very essence of the Hindu Philosophy&#xA;is that man is a spirit, and &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; a body, and not that man &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a body,&#xA;and may have a spirit also; which is as far as many a Western mind can&#xA;reach. . . .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For&#xA;an hour and a half he spoke, without a note. It is true that the&#xA;discourse was rather a flow of remarks than a connected study, but it&#xA;was all keenly interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The subject, in the main, was the Vedas, but we got excursions upon&#xA;Evolution, Modern Science, Idealism and Realism, the Supremacy of&#xA;Spirit, &amp;amp;c. On the whole, we gathered that the speaker was a preacher of&#xA;the universal religion of spiritual ascendency and spiritual harmony.&#xA;Certain passages from the Vedas — beautifully translated and read, by&#xA;the way — were charming in their bearing upon the humanness and sharp&#xA;reality of a life beyond the veil. One longed for more of this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
