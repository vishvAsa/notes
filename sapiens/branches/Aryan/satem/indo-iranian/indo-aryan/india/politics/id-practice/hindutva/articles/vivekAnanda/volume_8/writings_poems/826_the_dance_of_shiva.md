## THE DANCE OF SHIVA

(Translated from a [Hindi / Bengali](shiva.pdf) song.)

Lo, the God is dancing  
— Shiva the all-destroyer and Lord of creation,  
The Master of Yoga and the wielder of Pināka. (Trident.)  
His flaming locks have filled the sky,  
Seven worlds play the rhythm  
As the trembling earth sways almost to dissolution,  
Lo, the Great God Shiva is dancing.
