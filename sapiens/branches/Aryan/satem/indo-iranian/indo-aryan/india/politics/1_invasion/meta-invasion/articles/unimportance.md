It’s important to not conflate related but distinct issues (let alone totally unrelated issues) into a single issue and get emotionally worked up over its political implications:

1. Genetic/geographical origin of “Āryas” & alleged foreignness of the Vedic religion are conceptually distinct issues. I have no interest in the former issue but understand where people are coming from when they take certain positions but a position on the former does not lead to the latter. The Vedic religion is Bhāratīya.

2. Even if one were to argue that certain parts of the Veda were conceived outside the borders of greater Bhārata (a proposition that cannot be proven beyond a shadow of doubt anyway), that has no bearing on the Bhāratīya provenance of the Veda: 
   
(1) One could take the position that the majority of the Veda was “seen” in Bhārata but a better view is this:  
(2) Even if parts of the Veda were conceptualized outside Bhārata, they became Veda proper only when they were “seen” afresh in Bhārata.+++(4)+++

The Veda’s status is linked to the status of its seer as Rși  
and there is no reason to wonder if any Rși of the extant Veda was not in Bhārata. Every Rși “saw” or “discovered” a portion of the Veda, inspired by what they saw and knew, including stockpiles of phrases & sentences which were passed down in their community at the time. 

The same sentence uttered by their non-Rși ancestor would be laukika and “becomes” alaukika, “becomes” the Veda proper when “seen” as such by the Rși descendant. Done & dusted— Move on.

We know some were not in bhArata. why turn them to "non-Rși ancestor"? Rather, might be better to redefine "bhArata" to be mobile

3. There is no contradiction between migratory trajectories of the ancestors of Rșis & Brāhmaņyam being obtained by the Rșis due to birth in certain patrilines, which birth was due to pūrvajanma karmas.

4. Veda having Īśvara as author or being eternal & unauthored also has no connection with the idea of the Veda being composed in layers & over generations, with deliberate, human, creative input.

5. There is also no contradiction between believing, for example, that Ańgiras was a mānasaputra of Brahmā, who went on to have sons & grandsons who became ancestors of actual people who live today, and believing that Ańgiras as a person in historical time had countless generations of human parents behind him.

6. An ethnic preponderance among the Rșis doesn’t mean the historical Rșis did not absorb those outside this predominant group into its fold. That the Rșis left behind a heritage to be inherited by their children doesn’t mean it’s racially/ethnically limited or even that it’s 100% biological/blood (since tradition itself expressly gives examples of certain Rșis’ Gotras flourishing only after adoption from another Rși). Ārșeya heritage was uniquely hereditary without having either of those limitations.

Any perceived difficulties or contradictions with respect to any of the above issues is purely a result of your own self-imposed intellectual burdens or lack of creativity.

## Chose bhArata
We don’t have to deny any of these. We don’t have to even get worked up over this or that theory of Ārya origins because, at the end of the day, wheels, milk consumption and pastoralism are trivial facts before the shared worship of living gods. 

The Ārya sages chose Bhārata. Their descendants chose to identify the south, west & east as part of their universe rather than some far-flung IE cousins. 

## Theology over race
In fact, a pious Ārya would have affection for a Draviḍa who adopted Deva as Deivam into his native tongue and detest an accursed fellow “IE/IA tribe” which blasphemes the Daevas as evil. 

Their yet later descendants would go on to discover, through their mind’s eye, new lores concerning the gods worshiped by so-called, “non-Ārya” Draviḍas and Śabaras, as if these Deities were but their own “Ārya” Devas from the very beginning, albeit in a different skin & tongue. 

We don’t have to stand in the way of genuine historical conclusions. We just don’t care.

## RV LARPing
> The very fact that people are so invested in this fiction, rather than in actual cultures, is a sign of intellectual decay.

More odiously, it is used to tell Hindus that the Veda (mostly Rgveda larping) is a “European contribution”, an unmeritorious conclusion that has no basis, no matter the factual matrix on the Āryas’ origins and direction of migration.

These larpers also demean the Draviḍa and other non-Ārya components of Hindudharma, when the seamless integration of these components into a coherent whole, that is not merely academically coherent but one that actually works and produces effects (i.e. A Bhadrakālī at a temple, who receives ritual worship in both Saiddhāntika (which is an Ārya evolute and employs tattvas, etc) and folk Draviḍa modes), should be an object of respect and wonder.
