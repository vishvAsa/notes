Domes originated in India, not Persia. They were originally NW Bauddha architecture. A few elite Mazdean Bactrian landowning families converted to Buddhism (Baramakhids) and were completely assimilated into Sanskritic culture.

These people carried dome architecture to Persia.

Baramakhid means Pramukha in Sanskrit (leader). They were landowners in the Silk Road and Bactria and Mazdean priests (Mazdean = Mazdayasna = Yajna of Ahura Mazda = what Zoroastrians called themselves like Hindus did “Sanatani”).

The Pramukhas were also an influential family in the Abbasid Caliphate post conversion to Islam and they are the ones who brought Sanskrit philosophy and scientific texts to the court of Harun in Bagdhad for translation into Arabic.

These are the connections.
