[Jaishankar] 

No, I don't think this is a result of what has happening in the last few years. I think it's a results or what have happened for about 200 yrs. Because what happen was when British came & colonized India. The british systematically ran down our history. Whereas At that time they were very powerful. 

They had an interest in preserving and projecting Chinese History. Because they were afraid at that time that Tsarist Russia would come & occupy China. So if you look the 19th century for example. The biggest advocates of china were UK and America. Especially American missionaries. You know there's a whole school promoting. Not now, not Kissinger. Not modern era. I'm talking about early 1800s. In fact Pearl S. Buck was an outcome of that kind stand up thinking. So building up china was always—for not always but for long time—a strategic objective of the west. Building them as a society. Praising their achievements, history. 

And running us down was equally a strategic compulsion of the West. Today actually we are starting this competition or you can say this you know projecting of image from very different starting points. I think we have a harder job and therefore will work hard.
