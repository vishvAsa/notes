      <description>&lt;p&gt;*&lt;a href=&#34;txt_lajpatrai_1888.html#index&#34;&gt;Open Letters to Sir Syed Ahmed Khan&lt;/a&gt;*&#xA;(1888) by Lala Lajpat Rai&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;LETTER ONE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Would you excuse me if I encroach upon your valuable time for a short&#xA;while? Before I address you on the subject matter of discussion I think&#xA;it advisable to state for your information that I have been a constant&#xA;reader and admirer of your writings. From childhood, I was taught to&#xA;respect the opinions and the teachings of the white-bearded Syed of&#xA;Aligarh. Your &lt;em&gt;Social Reformer&lt;/em&gt; [the Urdu journal &lt;em&gt;Tahzib ul-Ikhlaq&lt;/em&gt;]&#xA;was constantly read to me by my fond father, who looked upon you as no&#xA;less than a prophet of the nineteenth century. Your writings in the&#xA;[English-language journal] &lt;em&gt;Aligarh Institute Gazette&lt;/em&gt; and your&#xA;speeches in Council and other public meetings, were constantly studied&#xA;by me and preserved as a sacred trust by my revered parent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;*&lt;a href=&#34;txt_lajpatrai_1888.html#index&#34;&gt;Open Letters to Sir Syed Ahmed Khan&lt;/a&gt;*&#xA;(1888) by Lala Lajpat Rai&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;LETTER TWO&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is more than two weeks now since my first letter was published, and I&#xA;think I have waited long enough for the reply which, it seems, you have&#xA;no mind to send. However, in fulfilment of my promise, I am bound to go&#xA;on giving quotation after quotation, bringing home to you your own&#xA;former political teachings, and I hope I shall be able clearly to prove&#xA;that you once believed in all the principles upon which the different&#xA;Resolutions of the National Congress are based. This will leave you no&#xA;alternative but either an open and unreserved confession of your&#xA;apostasy, or an unreserved retreat from politics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;*&lt;a href=&#34;txt_lajpatrai_1888.html#index&#34;&gt;Open Letters to Sir Syed Ahmed Khan&lt;/a&gt;*&#xA;(1888) by Lala Lajpat Rai&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;LETTER THREE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well may we apply the opening sentence of Dickens&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;Tale of Two Cities&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;to the present times in India. Well may we say that it is &amp;ldquo;the best of&#xA;times&amp;rdquo; as well as &amp;ldquo;the worst of times.&amp;rdquo; Best as the country is on the&#xA;point of having a nation, worst as a particular section of the community&#xA;wants to check the progress of the country; and unfortunately is headed,&#xA;or at least is said to be headed, by a man who has been a frequent&#xA;advocate of representative Government in India. It is &amp;ldquo;the age of&#xA;wisdom&amp;rdquo; as the country has risen from its deep lethargy and made up its&#xA;mind to assist the Government by wise counsels. It is &amp;ldquo;the age of&#xA;foolishness&amp;rdquo; as a particular party has the audacity to believe that&#xA;their opposition will cause the national movement to die in its infancy.&#xA;It is &amp;ldquo;the epoch of belief&amp;rdquo; because the different sectional interests&#xA;have begun to believe in each other&amp;rsquo;s sincerity; it is &amp;ldquo;the epoch of&#xA;incredulity&amp;rdquo; because you, Sir, are said to be nowadays against the&#xA;introduction of a representative element into the Legislative Councils&#xA;of India. It is the &amp;ldquo;spring of hope&amp;rdquo; when we see eminent English&#xA;statesmen advocating the rights of the dumb millions of India. It is the&#xA;&amp;ldquo;winter of despair&amp;rdquo; when we see her own sons deserting the cause of&#xA;awakened India.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;*&lt;a href=&#34;txt_lajpatrai_1888.html#index&#34;&gt;Open Letters to Sir Syed Ahmed Khan&lt;/a&gt;*&#xA;(1888) by Lala Lajpat Rai&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;LETTER FOUR&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The fourth meeting of the Indian National Congress is soon to be held at&#xA;Allahabad, and so I think I must hasten to give some more of the most&#xA;important quotations in this letter of mine. The less important ones I&#xA;leave for some future occasion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When this letter reaches you, you will be, possibly, smiling over [Lord&#xA;Dufferin] the ex-Viceroy&amp;rsquo;s [anti-Congress] speech delivered at the&#xA;St. Andrew&amp;rsquo;s Dinner, Calcutta. If you will only take the trouble of&#xA;reading that speech with your eyes open, you will find that your uproar&#xA;against the introduction of some representative element in the&#xA;Legislative Councils of India is not liked even by those whom you have&#xA;undertaken to flatter, and whose national traditions you try to belie.&#xA;Sir Syed, for God&amp;rsquo;s sake, reconsider your position, and do not&#xA;disappoint us just when the morning of hope has begun to dawn over us&#xA;and our mother-land.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
