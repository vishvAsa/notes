But Ramanavami is also eagerly awaited by Bengalureans as it kick-starts a series of musical concerts across the city. Musicians from across India descend on the city to perform; and particularly one among them is in high demand – B Husainsab Kanakagiri, a Muslim whose Hindu devotional songs are a big hit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/pakshirajan.ananthakrishnan/posts/1819041841455325&#34;&gt;FB17&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of the 13 Nath sub-orders, I understand the Rawal or Nagnath order of Punjab consisted of Muslims though it traced its ancestry to Shiva. One book says that the 1891 census listed about 17% of the wandering Yogis as Muslims! The collection of verses named Gorakhbani attributed to Gorakhnath (13th or 14th century) has several verses praising the glory of the Prophet Mohammed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I understand that in 2005 a book was published under the authority of the Yogī Mahāsabhā. &amp;ldquo;This book, written in Hindi by Yogī Vilāsnāth, secretary to the Mahāsabhā in Haridwar, is entitled Śrī Nāth Rahasya (‘the secrets of Śrī Nāth’) and is a compendium of mantras to be recited during specific rituals. A passage in the last section of the book is entitled Mohammad Bodh, ‘Mohammad’s wisdom&amp;rsquo;!&amp;rdquo; A sample of the text: Salutation to the True Name, Salutation to the Guru. Om Guruji! Alhā bismillā (devtā) Ram is Rahim. Om is Mohammad. The head is the mosque, the skull is madār .21 The ear is Sudh Granth (the Qur’an). The eye is the prophet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
