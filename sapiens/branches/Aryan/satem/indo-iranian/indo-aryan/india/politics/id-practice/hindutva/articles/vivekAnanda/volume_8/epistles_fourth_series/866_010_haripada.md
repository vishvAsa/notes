*To Shri Haripada Mitra*

MARGAON,  
*1893*.

DEAR HARIPADA,

I just now received a letter from you. I reached here safe. I went to
visit Panjim and a few other villages and temples near by. I returned
just today. I have not given up the intention of visiting Gokarna,
Mahabaleshwar, and other places. I start for Dharwar by the morning
train tomorrow. I have taken the walking-stick with me. Doctor
Yagdekar's friend was very hospitable to me. Please give my compliments
to Mr. Bhate and all others there. May the Lord shower His blessings on
you and your wife. The town of Panjim is very neat and clean. Most of
the Christians here are literate. The Hindus are mostly uneducated.

Yours affectionately,

SACHCHIDANANDA.  
(Swamiji used to call himself such in those days.)
