      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-art&#34;&gt;ON ART&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In art, interest must be centred on the principal theme. Drama is the&#xA;most difficult of all arts. In it two things are to be satisfied —&#xA;first, the ears, and second, the eyes. To paint a scene, if one thing be&#xA;painted, it is easy enough; but to paint different things and yet to&#xA;keep up the central interest is very difficult. Another difficult thing&#xA;is stage-management, that is, combining different things in such a&#xA;manner as to keep the central interest intact.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-music&#34;&gt;ON MUSIC&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is science in Dhrupad, Kheyal, etc., but it is in Kirtana, i.e. in&#xA;Māthura and Viraha and other like compositions that there is real music&#xA;— for there is feeling. Feeling is the soul, the secret of everything.&#xA;There is more music in common people&amp;rsquo;s songs, and they should be&#xA;collected together. The science of Dhrupad etc., applied to the music of&#xA;Kirtana will produce the perfect music.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>727 ON MANTRA AND MANTRA-CHAITANYA</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-mantra-and-mantra-chaitanya&#34;&gt;ON MANTRA AND MANTRA-CHAITANYA&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Mantra-Shāstris (upholders of the Mantra theory) believe that some&#xA;words have been handed down through a succession of teachers and&#xA;disciples, and the mere utterance of them will lead to some form of&#xA;realisation. There are two different meanings of the word&#xA;Mantra-chaitanya. According to some, if you practise the repetition of a&#xA;certain Mantra, you will see the Ishta-Devatā who is the object or deity&#xA;of that Mantra. But according to others, the word means that if you&#xA;practise the repetition of a certain Mantra received from a Guru not&#xA;competent, you will have to perform certain ceremonials by which that&#xA;Mantra will become Chetana or living, and then its repetition will be&#xA;successful. Different Mantras, when they are thus &amp;ldquo;living&amp;rdquo;, show&#xA;different signs, but the general sign is that one will be able to repeat&#xA;it for a long time without feeling any strain and that his mind will&#xA;very soon be concentrated. This is about the Tantrika Mantras.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>728 ON CONCEPTIONS OF GODHEAD</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-conceptions-of-godhead&#34;&gt;ON CONCEPTIONS OF GODHEAD&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Man&amp;rsquo;s inner hankering is to find some one who is free, that is, beyond&#xA;the laws of nature. The Vedantins believe in such an Eternal Ishvara,&#xA;while the Buddhists and the Sānkhyas believe only a Janyeshvara (created&#xA;God), that is, a God who was a man before, but has become God through&#xA;spiritual practice. The Purānas reconcile these two positions by the&#xA;doctrine of Incarna tion. That is, they say that the Janyeshvara is&#xA;nothing but the Nitya (Eternal) Ishvara, taking by Māyā the form of a&#xA;Janyeshvara. The argument of the Sankhyas against the doctrine of&#xA;Eternal Ishvara, viz &amp;ldquo;how a liberated soul can create the universe&amp;rdquo;, is&#xA;based on false grounds. For you cannot dictate anything to a liberated&#xA;soul. He is free, that is, he may do whatever he likes. According to the&#xA;Vedanta, the Janyeshvaras cannot create, preserve, or destroy the&#xA;universe.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>729 ON FOOD</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-food&#34;&gt;ON FOOD&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You preach to others to be men but cannot give them good food. I have&#xA;been thinking over this problem for the last four years. I wish to make&#xA;an experiment whether something of the nature of flattened rice can be&#xA;made out of wheat. Then we can get a different food every day. About&#xA;drinking water, I searched for a filter which would suit our country. I&#xA;found one pan-like porcelain vessel through which water was made to&#xA;pass, and all the bacilli remained in the porcelain pan. But gradually&#xA;that filter would itself become the hotbed of all germs. This is the&#xA;danger of all filters. After continued searching I found one method by&#xA;which water was distilled and then oxygen was passed into it. After this&#xA;the water became so pure that great improvement of health was sure to&#xA;result from its use.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>730 ON SANNYÂSA AND FAMILY LIFE</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-sannyâsa-and-family-life&#34;&gt;ON SANNYÂSA AND FAMILY LIFE&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Talking of the respective duties of a monk and a householder, Swamiji&#xA;said:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A Sannyasin should avoid the food, bedding, etc., which have been&#xA;touched or used by householders, in order to &lt;em&gt;save himself&lt;/em&gt; — not from&#xA;hatred towards them — so long as he has not risen to the highest grade,&#xA;that is, become a Paramahamsa. A householder should salute him with&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Namo Nārāyanāya&amp;rdquo;, and a Sannyasin should bless the former.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>731 ON QUESTIONING THE COMPETENCY
OF THE GURU</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-questioning-the-competency-of-the-guru&#34;&gt;ON QUESTIONING THE COMPETENCY OF THE GURU&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the course of a conversation Swamiji spiritedly remarked, &amp;ldquo;Leave off&#xA;your commercial calculating ideas. If you can get rid of your attachment&#xA;to a single thing, you are on the way to liberation. Do not see a public&#xA;woman, or sinner, or Sādhu. That vile woman also is the Divine Mother. A&#xA;Sannyāsin says once, twice, that she is Mother; then he gets deluded&#xA;again and says, &amp;lsquo;Hence, O vile, unchaste woman!&amp;rsquo; At a moment all your&#xA;ignorance may vanish. It is foolish talk that ignorance disperses&#xA;gradually. There are disciples who have been devoted to the Guru even&#xA;when he has fallen from the ideal. I have seen in Rajputana one whose&#xA;spiritual teacher had turned a Christian, but who nevertheless went on&#xA;giving him his regular dues. Give up your Western ideas. Once you have&#xA;pledged your faith to a particular teacher, stick to him with all force.&#xA;It is children who say that there is no morality in the Vedanta. Yes,&#xA;they are right. Vedanta is above morality. Talk of high things, as you&#xA;have become Sannyasins.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>732 SHRI RAMAKRISHNA
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF HIS
LIFE AND

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;shri-ramakrishna-the-significance-of-his-life-and-teachings&#34;&gt;SHRI RAMAKRISHNA THE SIGNIFICANCE OF HIS LIFE AND TEACHINGS&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a narrow society there is depth and intensity of spirituality. The&#xA;narrow stream is very rapid. In a catholic society, along with the&#xA;breadth of vision we find a proportionate loss in depth and intensity.&#xA;But the life of Sri Ramakrishna upsets all records of history. It is a&#xA;remarkable phenomenon that in Sri Ramakrishna there has been an&#xA;assemblage of ideas deeper than the sea and vaster than the skies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-shri-ramakrishna-and-his-views&#34;&gt;ON SHRI RAMAKRISHNA AND HIS VIEWS&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By force, think of one thing at least as Brahman. Of course it is easier&#xA;to think of Ramakrishna as God, but the danger is that we cannot form&#xA;Ishvara-buddhi (vision of Divinity) in others. God is eternal, without&#xA;any form, omnipresent. To think of Him as possessing any form is&#xA;blasphemy. But the secret of image-worship is that you are trying to&#xA;develop your vision of Divinity in one thing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>734 SHRI RAMAKRISHNA: THE NATION&#39;S IDEAL</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;shri-ramakrishna-the-nations-ideal&#34;&gt;SHRI RAMAKRISHNA: THE NATION&amp;rsquo;S IDEAL&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In order that a nation may rise, it must have a high ideal. Now, that&#xA;ideal is, of course, the abstract Brahman. But as you all cannot be&#xA;inspired by an abstract ideal, you must have a personal ideal. You have&#xA;got that, in the person of Shri Ramakrishna. The reason why other&#xA;personages cannot be our ideal now is, that their days are gone; and in&#xA;order that Vedanta may come to everyone, there must be a person who is&#xA;in sympathy with the present generation. This is fulfilled in Shri&#xA;Ramakrishna. So now you should place him before everyone. Whether one&#xA;accepts him as a Sādhu or an Avatāra does not matter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
