Some parallels might be seen jambudvIpa: the success of the Turk-led jihad set the H back by at least several 100 years. While I haven't seen an comparable analysis of pottery or tiling, 1 can look at technological proxies. 

- The va~Nga country -- One of the most productive provinces at the height of H power (e.g., look at gupta & post gupta inscriptions down to the sena-s) had some distinctive metal work that survived partly in Nepal & chIna. It completely became extinct in core va~Nga & magadha where the pAla-s once held sway. 
- Irrigation works in both north & south collapsed for several centuries. e.g. see [MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2010/07/31/mahasamanta-feudalism/) 
- Loss of metal technologies that were seen 1000 years ago under mahArAja bhoja
- Kashmir
  - compare the references in the rAjataraMgiNi to the actual evidence for the transport of blocks weighing several tons in ([mAhAsamanta “feudalism”](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2010/07/31/mahasamanta-feudalism/)) constructions throughout kAshmira. Post-jihad it completely vanishes. I think one could do an objective study of the weight of stone blocks used in kAshmira. 
  - Also irrigations works like that of suyya. This was quite different from an intrinsic civilizational collapse.
