<li>&ldquo;There are these three forms of purity&hellip; And of what sort is
purity of body?</li>
<li>&ldquo;Herein a certain one abstains from taking life, from stealing,
from sinful living. This is called &lsquo;purity of body.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;And of what sort is purity of speech?</li>
<li>&ldquo;Herein a certain one abstains from falsehood&hellip;</li>
<li>&ldquo;And of what sort is purity of mind?</li>
<li>&ldquo;Herein a monk, if he have some personal sensual desire, is
aware: &rsquo; There is in me sensual desire.&rsquo; If there be none he is
likewise aware of it. Also he is aware of how the arising of sensual
desire not yet arisen comes about, and how it is abandoned when it has
arisen, and how in the future there is no such arising.</li>
<li>&ldquo;If he have some personal malevolence, he is aware: &rsquo; There is
within me malevolence.&rsquo; Also he is aware of the arising . . . and the
abandoning thereof, and of how in future there is no recurrence
thereof.</li>
<li>&ldquo;If he have some personal sloth-and-torpor&hellip;excitement and
flurry&hellip;if he have some personal doubt-and-wavering, he is aware of
the fact. Also of how (each of these) arises, is abandoned and recurs
not again in future. This is called &lsquo;purity of mind.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;He who is pure in body, speech, and mind,<br>
&ldquo;Sinless and clean and blessed with purity&ndash;<br>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Sin-washer&rsquo; is the name men give to him.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>(1.ii)</p>
<ol>
<li>&ldquo;There are three forms of purity&hellip;Purity of body, purity of
speech, purity of mind.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;And of what sort is purity of body?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Herein a certain one abstains from taking life, from stealing,
from wrong practice in sensual lusts. This is called &lsquo;purity of
body.&rsquo;&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;And of what sort is purity of speech?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Herein a certain one abstains from falsehood&hellip;from idle
babble. This is called &lsquo;purity of speech.&rsquo;&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;And of what sort is purity of mind?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Herein a certain one is not covetous or malevolent of heart,
and has [a] right view. This is called &lsquo;purity of mind.&rsquo; These are
the three forms of purity.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>(1.iii)</p>
<ol>
<li>There are these five weaknesses, which are a source of weakness
to training. What five?</li>
<li>Taking life; taking what is not given; lustful, evil practices;
lying; and indulging in spirituous liquors, which cause idleness.</li>
<li>These are the five causes which lead to failure.</li>
<li>When these five sources of weakness to training are put away,
four arisings of mindfulness should be made to become.</li>
<li>Herein a monk abides contemplating the body as body, strenuous,
mindful and self-possessed, having overcome both the hankering and
discontent common in the world.</li>
<li>He abides contemplating the feelings as feelings&hellip;</li>
<li>He abides contemplating the mind as mind&hellip;</li>
<li>He abides contemplating ideas as ideas, strenuous, mindful and
self-possessed, having overcome both the hankering and discontent
common in the world.</li>
<li>When these five sources of weakness to training are put away,
these four arisings of mindfulness should be made to become.</li>
</ol>
<p>(1.iv)</p>
<ol>
<li>There are these three failures. Failure in morals, failure in
mind, failure in view.</li>
<li>And of what sort is failure in morals? A certain one takes
life, steals, is a wrong-doer in sensual desires, a liar, a slanderer,
of bitter speech, an idle babbler. This is called &ldquo;failure in
morals.&rdquo;</li>
<li>And of what sort is failure in mind?</li>
<li>A certain one is covetous and malevolent of heart. This is
called &ldquo;failure in mind.&rdquo;</li>
<li>And of what sort is failure in view?</li>
<li>Herein a certain one holds the depraved, the perverse view that
there is no (virtue in) alms giving, in sacrifice, in offerings; that
there is no fruit, no result of good and evil deeds; that this world
is not, that there is no world beyond; that there is no mother, no
father, no beings of spontaneous birth; that in the world are no
recluses and Brahmins who have won the summit, who have won
perfection, who of themselves by their own in tuitional powers have
realised the world beyond and can proclaim it. This, monks, is called
&ldquo;failure in view.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Monks, it is due to failure in morals, failure in mind and in
view, that beings, when [the] body breaks up after death, are reborn
in the Waste, the Way of Woe, in the Downfall, in Purgatory. Such are
the three failures.</li>
<li>Monks, there are these three successes. What three? Success in
morals, success in mind, success in view.</li>
<li>Now of what sort is success in morals?</li>
<li>A certain one abstains from taking life and the rest&hellip;from
bitter speech and idle babbling. This is called &ldquo;success in morals.&rdquo;</li>
<li>And of what sort is success in mind?</li>
<li>Herein a certain one is not covetous or malevolent of heart.
This is called &ldquo;success in mind.&rdquo;</li>
<li>And of what sort is success in view?</li>
<li>Herein a certain one has [a] right view: he holds with
certainty that there is (virtue in) almsgiving, in sacrifice, in
offerings; that there is fruit and result of good and evil deeds; that
this world is, that there is a world beyond; that mother, father and
beings of spontaneous birth do exist; that in the world there are
recluses and Brahmins who have realised the world beyond and can
proclaim it. This, monks, is called &ldquo;success in view.&rdquo;</li>
<li>It is owing to success in these three things that beings, when
[the] body breaks up after death, are reborn in the Happy Lot, in
the Heaven World. Such, monks, are the three successes.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 2. To Reach Perfection in Life is Dhamma</p>
<ol>
<li>There are these three perfections.</li>
<li>Perfection in body, speech and mind.</li>
<li>And of what sort is perfection in mind?</li>
<li>By the destruction of the asavas, realising in this very life
himself, knowing it thoroughly&ndash;the heart&rsquo;s release, the release by
insight which is free from the asavas, having attained it abides
therein. This is called &ldquo;perfection in mind.&rdquo; These are the three
bodily perfections.</li>
<li>There are other perfections. The Buddha explained them to
Subhuti.</li>
<li>Subhuti: &ldquo;What is a Bodhisattva&rsquo;s perfection of giving?&rdquo;</li>
<li>The Lord: &ldquo;Here a Bodhisattva, his thoughts associated with the
knowledge of all modes, gives gifts, i.e., inward or outward things,
and, having made them common to all beings, he dedicates them to
supreme enlightenment; and also others he instigates thereto. But
there is nowhere an apprehension of anything.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Subhuti: &ldquo;What is a Bodhisattva&rsquo;s perfection of morality?&rdquo;</li>
<li>The Lord: &ldquo;He himself lives under the obligation of the ten
ways of wholesome acting, and also others he instigates thereto.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Subhuti: &ldquo;What is a Bodhisattva&rsquo;s perfection of patience?&rdquo;</li>
<li>The Lord: &ldquo;He himself becomes one who has achieved patience,
and others also he instigates to patience.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Subhuti: &ldquo;What is a Bodhisattva&rsquo;s perfection of vigour?&rdquo;</li>
<li>The Lord: &ldquo;He dwells persistently in the five perfections, and
also others he instigates to do likewise.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Subhuti: &ldquo;What is the Bodhisattva&rsquo;s perfection of
concentration (or meditation)?&rdquo;</li>
<li>The Lord: &ldquo;He himself, through skill in means, enters into the
trances, yet he is not reborn in the corresponding heavens of form as
he could [be]; and others also he instigates to do likewise.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Subhuti: &ldquo;What is a Bodhisattva&rsquo;s perfection of wisdom?&rdquo;</li>
<li>The Lord: &ldquo;He does not settle down in any dharma, he
contemplates the essential original nature of all dharmas; and others
also he instigates to the contemplation of all dharmas.&rdquo;</li>
<li>It is Dhamma to cultivate these perfections.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 3. To Live in Nibbana is Dhamma</p>
<ol>
<li>&ldquo;Nothing can give real happiness as [can] Nibbana.&rdquo; So said
the Buddha.</li>
<li>Of all the doctrines taught by the Buddha, the doctrine of
Nibbana is the most central one.</li>
<li>What is Nibbana? Nibbana as taught by the Buddha has a totally
different meaning and content than what has been given to it by his
predecessors.</li>
<li>By Nibbana they meant the salvation of the soul.</li>
<li>Thus there were four ways in which Nibbana was conceived of:
(1) Laukik (material, eat, drink and be merry type); (2) Yogic; (3)
Brahmanic, and (4) Upanishadic.</li>
<li>There was one common feature of the Brahmanic and Upanishadic
conceptions of Nibbana. They involved the recognition of a soul as an
independent entity&ndash;a theory which the Buddha had denied. The Buddha
had therefore no difficulty in rejecting the Brahmanic and Upanishadic
teaching of Nibbana.</li>
<li>The Laukik conception of Nibbana was too materialistic to
appeal to the Buddha. It meant nothing but the satisfaction of man&rsquo;s
animal appetites. There was nothing spiritual in it.</li>
<li>To accept such a conception of Nibbana the Buddha felt was a
gross wrong that can be done to a human being.</li>
<li>For the satisfaction of appetites can result only in creating
more appetites. Such a way of life could bring no happiness, he
thought. On the contrary, such happiness was sure to bring more
unhappiness.</li>
<li>The Yogic conception of Nibbana was a purely temporary state.
The happiness it brought was negative. It involved disassociation from
the world. It avoided pain but gave no happiness. Whatever happiness
it may be said to bring lasted as long as the yoga lasted. It was not
permanent. It was temporary.</li>
<li>The Buddha&rsquo;s conception of Nibbana is quite different from
that of his predecessors.</li>
<li>There are three ideas which underlie his conception of
Nibbana.</li>
<li>Of these, the happiness of a sentient being as distinct from
the salvation of the soul is one.</li>
<li>The second idea is the happiness of the sentient being in
<em>Samsara</em> while he is alive. But the idea of a soul and the salvation
of the soul after death are absolutely foreign to the Buddha&rsquo;s
conception of Nibbana.</li>
<li>The third idea which underlies his conception of Nibbana is
the exercise of control over the flames of the passions which are
always on fire.</li>
<li>That the passions are like burning fire was the text of a
sermon which the Buddha delivered to the Bhikkus when he was staying
in Gaya. This is what he said:</li>
<li>&ldquo;All things, O Bhikkus, are on fire. And what, O Priests, are
all these things which are on fire?</li>
<li>&ldquo;The eye, O Bhikkus, is on fire; forms are on fire;
eye-consciousness is on fire; impressions received by the eye are on
fire; and whatever sensation, pleasant, unpleasant, or indifferent,
originates in dependence on impression received by he type, that also
is on fire.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;And with what are these on fire?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;With the. fire of passion, say I, with the fire of hatred,
with the fire of infatuation; with birth, old age, death, sorrow,
lamentation, misery, grief and despair are they on fire.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The ear is on fire; sounds are on fire; the nose is on
fire; odours are on fire; the tongue is on fire; tastes are on fire;
the body is on fire; ideas are on fire; and whatever sensation,
pleasant, unpleasant, or indifferent, originates in dependence on
impression received by the mind, that also is on fire.</li>
<li>&ldquo;And with what are these on fire?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;With the fire of passion, say I; with the fire of hatred;
with the fire of infatuation; with birth, old age, death, sorrow,
lamentation, misery, grief, and despair are they on fire.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Perceiving this, O Bhikkus, the learned and noble [person]
conceives an aversion. And in conceiving this aversion, he becomes
divested of passion, and by the absence of passion he becomes free,
and when he is free he becomes aware that he is free.&rdquo;</li>
<li>How can Nibbana give happiness? That is the next question
which calls for explanation.</li>
<li>The common notion is that man is unhappy because he is in
want. But this is not always true. Man is unhappy even though he is in
the midst of plenty.</li>
<li>Unhappiness is the result of greed, and greed is the bane of
life of those who have, as well as of those who have not.</li>
<li>This the Buddha has made clear in a sermon delivered to the
Bhikkus in which he said:</li>
<li>&ldquo;Excited by greed (lobha), brothers, furious with anger
(dosa), blinded by delusion (moha), with mind overwhelmed, with mind
enslaved, men reflect upon their own misfortune, men reflect upon the
misfortune of others, men experience mental suffering and anguish.</li>
<li>&ldquo;If, however, greed, anger and delusion are done away
[with], men reflect neither upon their own misfortune nor on mental
suffering and anguish.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Thus, brothers, is Nibbana visible in this life and not
merely in the future&ndash;inviting, attractive, accessible to the wise
disciple.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Herein lies the explanation of what consumes man and makes him
unhappy. By using this analogy of burning fire to the working of human
passions, the Buddha has given the most forceful explanation for the
unhappiness of man.</li>
<li>What makes man unhappy is his falling a prey to his passions.
These passions are called fetters which prevent a man from reaching
the state of Nibbana. The moment he is free from the sway of his
passions&ndash;i.e., he learns to achieve Nibbana&ndash;man&rsquo;s way to happiness
is open to him.</li>
<li>These passions, according to the Buddha&rsquo;s analysis, fall under
three groups.</li>
<li>First: that which refers to all degrees of craving or
attachment&ndash;such as lust, infatuation, and greed (lobha).</li>
<li>Second: that which refers to all degrees of antipathy&ndash;hatred,
anger, vexation, or repugnance (dosa).</li>
<li>Third: that which refers to all degrees of
ignorance&ndash;delusion, dullness, and stupidity (moha or avidya).</li>
<li>The first and second fires relate to the emotions and
[range] over the whole scale of one&rsquo;s attitudes and feelings towards
other beings, while the third fire relates to all ideas that are in
any way removed from the truth.</li>
<li>There are certain misunderstandings about the Buddha&rsquo;s
doctrine of Nibbana.</li>
<li>The word Nibbana etymologically means outblowing,
extinguishing.</li>
<li>Taking hold of this root meaning of the word, critics have
tried to make nonsense of the doctrine of Nibbana.</li>
<li>They hold that Nibbana means extinction of all human passions,
which is equivalent to death.</li>
<li>They have by this means tried to throw ridicule over the
doctrine of Nibbana.</li>
<li>That such is not the meaning of Nibbana is quite clear if one
examines the language of the fire sermon.</li>
<li>The fire sermon does not say that life is burning and death is
extinction. It says passions are on fire.</li>
<li>The fire sermon does not say that the passions must be
extinguished completely. It says, do not add fuel to the flame.</li>
<li>Secondly, critics have failed to make a distinction between
Nibbana and Parinibbana.</li>
<li>As the Udana says: &ldquo;Parinibbana occurs when the body becomes
disintegrated, all perceptions become stopped, all sensations die
away, the activities cease and consciousness goes away. Thus
Parinibbana means complete extinction.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Nibbana can never have this meaning. Nibbana means enough
control over passion so as to enable one to walk on the path of
righteousness. It was not intended to mean. anything more.</li>
<li>That Nibbana is another name for righteous life is made clear
by the Buddha himself to Radha.</li>
<li>Once the venerable Radha came to the Exalted One. Having done
so, he saluted the Exalted One and sat down at one side. So seated,
the venerable Radha thus addressed the Exalted One: &ldquo;Pray, Lord, what
for [=for what] is Nibbana?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Nibbana means release from passion,&rdquo; replied the Lord.</li>
<li>&ldquo;But Nibbana, Lord,&ndash;what is the aim of it?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Rooted in Nibbana, Radha, the righteous life is lived.
Nibbana is its goal. Nibbana is its end.&rdquo;</li>
<li>That Nibbana does not mean extinction is also made clear by
Sariputta in the following sermon:</li>
<li>&ldquo;Once the Blessed Lord was staying at Shravasti in
Anathpindika&rsquo;s Ashrama where Sariputta was also staying.</li>
<li>&ldquo;The Lord, addressing the brethren, said, &lsquo;Almsmen, be ye
partakers not of the world&rsquo;s goods but of my doctrine; in my
compassion for you all I am anxious to ensure this.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Thus spoke the Lord, who thereupon rose and passed to his own
cell.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Sariputta remained behind, and the brethren asked him to
explain what is Nibbana.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Then Sariputta in reply to the brethren said, &rsquo; Brethren,
know ye that greed is vile, and vile is resentment.</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;To shed this greed and this resentment, there is the Middle
Way which gives us eyes to see and makes us know, leading us on to
peace, insight, enlightenment, and Nibbana.</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;What is this Middle Way? It is naught but the Noble
Eightfold Path of right outlook, right aims, right speech, right
action, right means of livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness,
and right concentration; this, almsmen, is the Middle Way.</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, sirs: anger is vile and malevolence is vile, envy and
jealousy are vile, niggardliness and avarice are vile, hypocrisy and
deceit and arrogance are vile, inflation [=boastfulness] is vile,
and indolence is vile.</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;For the shedding of inflation and indolence there is the
Middle Way&ndash;giving us eyes to see, making us know, and leading us on
to peace, insight, enlightenment.</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nibbana&ndash;which is naught but that Noble Eightfold Path.&rsquo;&rdquo;</li>
<li>Thus spoke the revered Sariputta. Glad at heart, the almsmen
rejoiced at what he had said:</li>
<li>That the idea underlying Nibbana is that it is the path of
righteousness. No one will mistake Nibbana for anything else.</li>
<li>Complete annihilation is one extreme, and Parinibbana is
another extreme. Nibbana is the Middle Way.</li>
<li>So understood, all confusion about Nibbana will disappear.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 4. To Give up Craving is Dhamma</p>
<ol>
<li>In the Dhammapada the Buddha says: &ldquo;There is no greater benefit
than. health, and there is nothing more valuable than the spirit of
contentment.&rdquo;</li>
<li>This spirit of contentment is not to be understood to mean
meekness or surrender to circumstances.</li>
<li>Because that would be quite contrary to the other teachings of
the Buddha.</li>
<li>The Buddha has not said, &ldquo;Blessed are they who are poor.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The Buddha has not said that the sufferer should not try to
change his condition.</li>
<li>On the other hand, he has said that riches are welcome; and
instead of listless suffering he taught Virya, which is energetic
action.</li>
<li>What the Buddha meant when he said that contentment is the
highest form of wealth is that man should not allow himself to be
overpowered by greed which has no limits.</li>
<li>As the Bhikku Rathapala has said, &ldquo;Rich men I see who,
folly-led, never give, but still amass, athirst for pleasures new; the
king whose conquests to the sea extend, for sway over empires overseas
will pine; still craving, kings and subjects pass away; lacking, still
lacking, they their bodies quit; never on earth can pleasure&rsquo;s measure
be filled.&rdquo;</li>
<li>In the Maha-Nidan-Suttanta the Buddha has explained to Ananda
the necessity of controlling greed. This is what he said:</li>
<li>&ldquo;Thus it is, Ananda, that craving comes into being because of
desire for gain, when desire for gain becomes a passion for
possession; when the spirit of possession gives rise to tenacity of
possession, it becomes avarice.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Avarice or possession due to [the] uncontrolled acquisitive
instinct calls for watch and ward.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Why is this craving or greed to be condemned? Because of
this,&rdquo; said the Buddha to Ananda, &ldquo;many a bad and wicked state of
things arises&ndash;blows and wounds, strife, contradiction and retorts;
quarrelling, slander, and lies.&rdquo;</li>
<li>That this is the correct analysis of class struggle, there can
be no doubt.</li>
<li>That is why the Buddha insisted upon the control of greed and
craving.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 5. To believe that all compound things are impermanent is Dhamma</p>
<ol>
<li>This doctrine of impermanence has three aspects.</li>
<li>There is the impermanence of composite things.</li>
<li>There is the impermanence of the individual being.</li>
<li>There is the impermanence of the self-nature of conditioned
things.</li>
<li>The impermanence of composite things has been well explained by
the great Buddhist philosopher Asanga.</li>
<li>&ldquo;All things,&rdquo; says Asanga, &ldquo;are produced by the combination of
causes and conditions, and have no independent noumenon of their own.
When the combination is dissolved, their destruction ensures.</li>
<li>&ldquo;The body of a living being consists of the combination of four
great elements&ndash;viz., earth, water, fire and air&ndash;and when this
combination is resolved into the four component elements, dissolution
ensues.</li>
<li>&ldquo;This is what is called the impermanence of a composite
entity.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Impermanence of the living individual is best described by the
formula: being is becoming.</li>
<li>In this sense a being of a past moment has lived, but does not
live, nor will he live. The being of a future moment will live, but
has not lived, nor does he live; the being of the present moment does
live, but has not lived, and will not live.</li>
<li>In short, a human being is always changing, always growing. He
is not the same at two different moments of his life.</li>
<li>The third phase of the doctrine of impermanence is somewhat
difficult for a common man to follow.</li>
<li>To realise that every living being will die sometime or other
is a very easy matter to understand.</li>
<li>But it is not quite so easy to understand how a human being
can go on changing&ndash;becoming&ndash;while he is alive.</li>
<li>&ldquo;How is this possible?&rdquo; The Buddha&rsquo;s answer was, &ldquo;This is
possible because all is impermanent.&rdquo;</li>
<li>This later on gave rise to what is called Sunnya Vad.</li>
<li>The Buddhist Sunnyata does not mean nihilism out and out. It
only means the perpetual changes occurring at every moment in the
phenomenal world.</li>
<li>Very few realise that it is on account of Sunnyata that
everything becomes possible; without it nothing in the world would be
possible. It is on the impermanence of the nature of all things that
the possibility of all other things depends.</li>
<li>If things were not subject to continual change, but were
permanent and unchangeable, the evolution of all of life from one kind
to the other, and the development of living things, would come to a
dead stop.</li>
<li>If human beings [had not] died or changed, but had continued
always in the same state, what would the result have been? The
progress of the human race would have come to a dead halt.</li>
<li>Immense difficulty would have arisen if Sunnya is [=had
been] regarded as being void or empty.</li>
<li>But this is not so. Sunnya is like a point which has substance
but neither breadth nor length.</li>
<li>All things are impermanent, was the doctrine preached by the
Buddha.</li>
<li>What is the moral of this doctrine of the Buddha? This is a
much more important question.</li>
<li>The moral of this doctrine of impermanence is simple. Do not
be attached to anything.</li>
<li>It is to cultivate detachment&ndash;detachment from property, from
friends, etc.&ndash;that he said &ldquo;All these are impermanent.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 6. To believe that Karma is the instrument of Moral Order is Dhamma</p>
<ol>
<li>There is an order in the physical world. This is proved by the
following phenomenon.</li>
<li>There is a certain order in the movements and actions of the
starry bodies.</li>
<li>There is a certain order by which seasons come and go in
regular sequence.</li>
<li>There is a certain order by which seeds grow into trees, and
trees yield fruits ,and fruits give seeds.</li>
<li>In Buddhist terminology these are called Niyamas, laws which
produce an orderly sequence such as Rutu Niyam, Bija Niyam.</li>
<li>Similarly is there a moral order in Human Society. How is it
produced? How is it maintained?</li>
<li>Those who believe in the existence of God have no difficulty in
answering the question. And their answer is easy.</li>
<li>Moral order, they say, is maintained by Divine Dispensation.
God created the world, and God is the Supreme Governor of the world.
He is also the author of moral as well as of physical law.</li>
<li>Moral law, according to them, is for man&rsquo;s good, because it
ensues from Divine will. Man is bound to obey God, who is his maker,
and it is obedience to God which maintains the moral order.</li>
<li>Such is the argument in support of the view that the moral
order is maintained by Divine Dispensation.</li>
<li>The explanation is by no means satisfactory. For if the moral
law has originated from God, and if God is the beginning and end of
the moral order, and if man cannot escape from obeying God, why is
there so much moral disorder in the world?</li>
<li>What is the authority of the Divine Law? What is the hold of
the Divine Law over the individual? These are pertinent questions. But
to none of them is there any satisfactory answer from those who rely
on Divine Dispensation as the basis for the moral order.</li>
<li>To overcome these difficulties the thesis has been somewhat
modified.</li>
<li>It is said: No doubt creation took effect at the command of
God. It is also true that the cosmos entered upon its life by his will
and by his direction. It is also true that He imparted to the cosmos
once for all the energy which served as the driving power of a
stupendous mechanism.</li>
<li>But God leaves it to Nature to work itself out in obedience to
the laws originally given by him.</li>
<li>So that if the moral order fails to work out as expected by
God, the fault is of Nature and not of God.</li>
<li>Even this modification in the theory does not solve the
difficulty. It only helps to exonerate God from his responsibility.
For the question remains, why should God leave it to Nature to execute
His laws What is the use of such an absentee God?</li>
<li>The answer which the Buddha gave to the question, &quot; How is
moral order maintained?&rdquo;, is totally different.</li>
<li>His answer was simple. &ldquo;It is the Kamma Niyam and not God
which maintains the moral order in the universe.&rdquo; That was the
Buddha&rsquo;s answer to the question.</li>
<li>The moral order of the universe may be good or it may be bad.
But according to the Buddha, the moral order rests on man and on
nobody else.</li>
<li>Kamma means man&rsquo;s action, and Vipaka is its effect. If the
moral order is bad, it is because man does Akusala (Bad) Kamma. If the
moral order is good, it is because man does Kusala (Good) Kamma.</li>
<li>The Buddha was not content with merely speaking of Kamma. He
spoke of the law of Kamma, which is another name for Kamma Niyam.</li>
<li>By speaking of the law of Kamma, what the Buddha wanted to
convey was that the effect of the deed was bound to follow the deed,
as surely as night follows day. It was like a Niyam or rule.</li>
<li>No one could fail to benefit by the good effects of a Kusala
Kamma, and no one could escape the evil effects of Akusala Kamma.</li>
<li>Therefore, the Buddha&rsquo;s admonition was: do Kusala Kamma so
that humanity may benefit by a good moral order which a Kusala Kamma
helps to sustain; do not do Akusala Kamma, for humanity will suffer
from the bad moral order which an Akusala Kamma will bring about.</li>
<li>It may be that there is a time interval between the moment
when the Kamma is done, and the moment when the effect is felt. It is
so, often enough.</li>
<li>From this point of view, Kamma is either (1) Ditthadamma
Vedaniya Kamma (Immediately Effective Kamma); (2) Upapajjavedaniya
Kamma (Remotely Effective Kamma); and [=or] (3) Aporapariya Vedaniya
Kamma (Indefinitely Effective Kamma).</li>
<li>Kamma may also fall into the category of Ahosi Kamma, i.e.,
Kamma which is non-effective. This Ahosi Kamma comprises all such
Kammas which are too weak to operate, or which are counteracted by a
more [powerful?] Kamma, at the time when it [=they] should have
worked.</li>
<li>But making allowance for all these considerations, it does not
in any sense derogate from the claim made by the Buddha that the law
of Kamma is inexorable.</li>
<li>The theory of the law of Kamma does not necessarily involve
the conception that the effect of the Kamma recoils on the doer of it,
and there is nothing more to be thought about it. This is an error.
Sometimes the action of one affects another instead of the doer. All
the same, it is the working of the law of Kamma, because it either
upholds or upsets the moral order.</li>
<li>Individuals come and individuals go. But the moral order of
the universe remains, and so also the law of Kamma which sustains
it.</li>
<li>It is for this reason that in the religion of the Buddha,
Morality has been given the place of God.</li>
<li>Thus the Buddha&rsquo;s answer to the question of how the moral
order in the universe is sustained, is so simple and so irrefutable.</li>
<li>And yet its true meaning is scarcely grasped. Often, almost
always, it is either misunderstood or misstated or misinterpreted. Not
many seem to be conscious that the law of Kamma was propounded by the
Buddha as an answer to the question [of ] how the moral order is
maintained.</li>
<li>That, however, is the purpose of Buddha&rsquo;s Law of Kamma.</li>
<li>The Law of Kamma has to do only with the question of general
moral order. It has nothing to do with the fortunes or misfortunes of
an individual.</li>
<li>It is concerned with the maintenance of the moral order in the
universe.</li>
<li>It is because of this that the law of Kamma is a part of
Dhamma.</li>
