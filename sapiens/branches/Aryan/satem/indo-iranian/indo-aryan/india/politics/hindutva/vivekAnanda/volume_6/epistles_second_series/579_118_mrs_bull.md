39 VICTORIA STREET, LONDON,  
*9th Dec., 1896.*

DEAR MRS. BULL,

It is needless to express my gratitude at your most generous offer. I
don't want to encumber myself with a large amount of money at the first
start, but as things progress on I will be very glad to find employment
for that sum. My idea is to start on a very small scale. I do not know
anything yet. I will know my bearings when on the spot in India. From
India I will write to you more details about my plans and the practical
way to realise them. I start on the 16th and after a few days in Italy
take the steamer at Naples.

Kindly convey my love to Mrs. Vaughan and Saradananda and to the rest of
my friends there. As for you, I have always regarded you as the best
friend I have, and it will be the same all my life.

Yours,

VIVEKANANDA.
