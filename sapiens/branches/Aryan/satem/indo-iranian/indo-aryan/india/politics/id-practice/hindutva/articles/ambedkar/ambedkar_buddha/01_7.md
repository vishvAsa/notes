> § 1. What HE Rejected
>
>  1. This survey of the philosophical and religious thought shows
> that at the time when the Buddha formulated his Sasana, certain ideas
> had a firm grip on the mind of the people. They were:
>
> > \(i\) Belief in the infallibility of the Vedas  
> > (ii) Belief in Moksha, or Salvation of the soul, i.e., its ceasing
> > to be born again  
> > (iii) Belief in the efficacy of rites, ceremonies and sacrifices as
> > means of obtaining moksha  
> > (iv) Belief in Chaturvarna as the ideal for social organization  
> > (v) Belief in Iswara as the creator of, and in Brahmana as the
> > principle underlying, the universe  
> > (vi) Belief in Atmana, or the soul  
> > (vii) Belief in *Sansara* (wandering together), i.e., transmigration
> > of the soul  
> > (viii) Belief in Karma, i.e., the determination of man's position in
> > present life by deeds done by him in his past life.
>
>  2. In formulating the principles of his Sasana, the Buddha dealt
> with this old stock of ideas in his own way.  
>  3. The following are the ideas which he rejected:
>
> > \(i\) He condemned indulging in speculation as to the whence,
> > whither, and what am I?  
> > (ii) He discarded heresies about the soul, and refrained from
> > identifying it with either the body, sensations, volitions, and
> > \[=or\] consciousness.  
> > (iii) He discarded all the Nihilistic views which were promulgated
> > by certain religious teachers.  
> > (iv) He condemned such views as were held by heretics.  
> > (v) He discarded the theory that the cosmic progress had a known
> > beginning.  
> > (vi) He repudiated the theory that a God created man, or that he
> > came out of the body of some Bramha.  
> > (vii) The existence of the soul he either ignored or denied.
>
>   
>   
> § 2. What HE Modified
>
>  1. He accepted the great grand law of cause and effect with its
> corollaries.  
>  2. He repudiated the fatalistic view of life, and \[the\] other
> equally foolish view that a God predestined as to what should happen
> for man and the world.  
>  3. He discarded the theory that all deeds committed in some former
> birth have the potency to produce suffering, making present activity
> impotent. He denied the fatalistic view of Karma. He replaced the view
> of Karma by a much more scientific view of Karma. He put new wine in
> old bottle\[s\].  
>  4. Transmigration (sansara) was replaced by the doctrine of
> re-birth.  
>  5. He replaced the doctrine of moksha or salvation of the soul by
> the doctrine of Nibbana.  
>  6. The Buddha Sasana is thus an original piece \[of thought\]. The
> little in it which is old is either modified or restated.
>
>   
> §3. What HE Accepted
>
>  1. The first distinguishing feature of his teachings lay in the
> recognition of the mind as the centre of everything.  
>  2. Mind precedes things, dominates them, creates them. If mind is
> comprehended, all things are comprehended.  
>  3. Mind is the leader of all its faculties. Mind is the chief of
> all its faculties. The very mind is made up of those faculties.  
>  4. The first thing to attend to is the culture of the mind.  
>  5. The second distinguishing feature of his teachings is that mind
> is the fount of all the good and evil that arises within, and befalls
> us from without.  
>  6. Whatsoever there is of evil, connected with evil, belonging to
> evil--that issues from the mind. Whatsoever there is of good,
> connected with good, belonging to good--all issues from mind.  
>  7. If one speaks or acts with a pounded \[=polluted?\] mind, then
> affliction follows him as the wheels of the cart follow the feet of
> the bullocks who pull the cart. The cleaning of the mind is,
> therefore, the essence of religion.  
>  8. The third distinguishing feature of his teachings is the
> avoidance of all sinful acts.  
>  9. The fourth distinguishing feature of his teaching is that real
> religion lies not in the books of religion, but in the observance of
> the tenets of the religion.  
>  10. Can anyone say that the Buddha's religion was not his own
> creation?
