## Long term
I'm not inclined to say too much because I think my predictive abilities in this regard are limited. There are huge challenges which I think are going to be difficult for the current rulers to surmount. The main issues I have concerns human capital and whether a good place can be reached without huge bloodshed. H have generally tried to avoid to later in exchange for a slow place of things.

Some people are complaining that the world (= the Occident in particular) should not ignore India and its military prowess. We'd say it is better to be ignored as long as the H really have a big stick. It is a good thing if they don't know you have a big stick. Let those who need to learn about it do so the hard way.

## Counter-diplomacy
It is good to see the H come together for the boycott of the Turkish. Hopefully, it is comprehensive and unrelenting: No Khilafat-2. We bring our coethnic gopaNArya to mind, who cut down the marUnmatta Turks with upraised bows.


## Drones
It seems TSP has decided to adopt a passive-aggressive stance for now: flying cheap, potentially unarmed drones into Indian airspace. The idea is to waste ADS ammunition and make it dangerous for civil aviation, thereby tying it down. If the H strongly retaliate, they will then go crying to their mlechCha friends, complaining that H first broke the ceasefire. Hopefully, our pakSha has/is figuring out a solution for that.

## Briefing
The generals are rather open about the intended military objectives here, which is in line with what we gleaned of the unfolding events. This will definitely cause a big burn to the enemies in all three directions. The mahAmlechCha South Asianists are probably getting some of that too.

One little point the general made was that the marUnmatta-s attempted a saturation drone attack. Hence, this was indeed a good test of the Indian ADS. But this is the future of warfare and hopefully our endogenous engineers are giving good thought to advancing counter measures in this regard.

## Holding territory
Must state upfront that I've little knowledge of military history in its specifics, but over the years have read up on campaigns of certain empires/kingdoms in some depth. It is instructive for people to do the same before mouthing off about grandiose plans like a handphone Chingiz Khan. Conducting large-scale war, invading, taking, and holding territory need considerable effort that might not be worth it for a country. 

One may even see recent cases of how the most powerful nation on earth fared against ramshackle armies with no air and sea power, which were hardly a match for their power, when it came to holding territory after the initial conquest. +++(afghAnistAn, irAq)+++

There are no indications that the govt had shaped this as a campaign for territorial conquest unless forced in that direction. They were mostly seeing it as a punitive and probing campaign, though they were likely prepared for an escalation into a full-blown war. But the latter was not their primary objective, and did not back down from it due to superpower pressure. We suspect that events are yet to unfold, and there is stuff that is hard to predict.


## Cease-fire violations
What we are seeing is typical marUnmatta behavior that has gone on for centuries. Hope H too remember their god' statement:
bahvIH sandhA atikramya divi prahlAdIyAn atR^iN aham antarikShe paulomAn pR^ithivyAM kAlakA~njAn |

but the question is, what did marUnmatta achieve with the brief pause? Did they think it took the H off guard? Obviously, it was too short a time to replenish in a big way. So we would err in the direction that they thought they would fool the H from pressing the ongoing attack and thus lose the upper hand. Hopefully, our pakSha has not lost the initiative from it.

Clearly the mlechCha-s are complicit in this act of trying to give their marUnmatta allies a reprieve.

/... So the evil Middle Kingdom showed the mahAmlechCha who is calling the shots.

## Cease-fire and USA
pichChilaka, anUpa and duShTa-muShkavAn tend to exaggerate their successes. Clearly, that happened here, too. But the reality is that much of the US doesn't care a bit about the existence of India (or, for that matter, their "ally" TSP), unlike Israel, which is central to their very identity. For them, they are both distant 3rd world countries that they don't bother to understand. So this claimed propaganda success is mainly for a certain niche audience, perhaps even the hyper-plugged-in Indian audience. 

Those who are peripherally interested mostly buy into the crap American sources have always pedaled that they somehow get intelligence that TSP is going to erect its nukes and the American saviors came in at the last moment to prevent this by calling on both sides to go to the table. Those who are old enough know how the same thing was said during the Kargil war. Apparently, TSP was minutes from nuking India, and the Americans saved the day. They are hinting at the same now. 

Not everything is known in the fog of war, but I doubt it is anything like what some people are thinking here, that the Indian govt ceded the initiative under American pressure.

I think it is not over yet and some more pieces might fall in place in the coming days. My take is that the Indian govt was not intending a large scale war while being prepared for it. The specifics for their calculus would obviously not be made public. But in it the question of whether to commit to huge human & material cost with territorial objectives was asked and answered. They had earlier in the conflict signaled offramps.

### Context
When the Brits had to leave India, the Anglosphere feared losing control of the subcontinent and the possible rise of a heathen power that could challenge their supremacy in the region. TSP came as a godsend to them to retain a modicum of control.

It did not matter much early on as residual India, weakened by a millennium of struggle against the two Abrahamisms, was teetering on the brink. But we believe it was kept as a long-term asset to counter the inevitable secular [sensu originali] growth of India. Over the past 24 hours, it became clear that the asset was in trouble if it went down the escalatory ladder. Hence, nAri~Nga called on kuruvinda to save the asset.

It is not clear if this ceasefire would hold as the marUnmatta-s could be just buying time to regroup as they have been doing all along. Perhaps, to wait for the mlechCha-s via the turuShka-s to resupply them or chIna-s. H need to be wary -- perhaps the reports of violations suggest it is just a pause to lick their wounds



## Misinformation
The TSPian misinformation tactics seem to closely parallel those of the chIna Wǔmáo-s (at least to us). They seem to be then amplified by real Wǔmáo-s, those mlechCha-s who have a natural sympathy for TSP or H hate (those with a mind like duShTa-muShkavAn's man Bigballz), or internal traitors from the usual categories.

Another difference from the Kargil era is the action of the chIna Wǔmáo-s. Then they had a negligible web presence. But now the Wǔmáo-s almost seem boosted by duShTa-muShkavAn in the For you tab.

It is interesting how a subset of mlechCha-s are acting exactly as per their prior programming, broadcasting marUnmatta propaganda.

While sora's pakSha is out of power among the mahAmlechCha it does not mean sora has lost all his power in the propaganda circles. It should not be forgotten that soraputra's patnI is a notorious marUnmattI is likely a conduit for soraputra to help with p'ganda on behalf of her pakSha.


## Drones
Older people will see how we are on the cusp of a transition in warfare. While Kargil was operationally different, we never heard the word drone then. This battle, like so many others around the world, has entirely gone drone-ward. What is not clear is the degree of AI integration in drone and counter-drone tactics in this encounter. 

Even in the rUs-pashchima-mlechCha war, a lot of the counter-drone tactics are quite primitive but effective: shooting drones with shotguns like hunting birds. 

A few months back, I heard from an Israeli gentleman that the Islamic state in Iran's drones did cause some damage to their military installations, so it remains a viable option. Wonder if the Turks of Turkey would supply their friends with more drones.

> Ukr-Russia front has seen rapid evolution in drones and counter-drone strategies with drones using fiber optic cables stretching tens of kilometres in operation to prevent electronic counter measures or drones that are partially autonomous.


Apart from drone warfare, it seems TSP's strategy might include some border attack. However, due to preparedness that might not be too effective.




## Backers
As the war with one of the Mogol rump states breaks out, some mlechCha states will back the marUnmatta. We are already seeing tidbits of that at the propaganda level. However, the bigger issue will be the backing of Shi Huang's merry descendants.

Before the war started, we had remarked that sugrIva would not rush at vAlin unless there was someone truly dangerous behind him. We feel that TSP taking the ladder of escalation hints that. There could be many variants of what might be behind this. 

We stand by our original inference regarding the chIna-s, but there is something more. One possibility is TSP wanting to open an eastern front via TSB or even an internal front. There could be a tactical plan the chIna-s had drawn up for them that the jihadis were just to eager to put into action. But by the looks of what has transpired, the H should steel themselves for a potential heavy saMgrama.

### IMF money
The pa~nchanetraka Anglosphere and its vassals have always wanted to balance out India so that the H do not attain their natural position of prominence in the world. They realized even before they conquered the H that the tool for this would marUnmada, which they backed against the marahaTTa-s in the days of the last H empire. The IMF bailing out TSP should be seen as the latest action in this direction. Ironically, there could be an overlap with the Galtonian frenemies in this regard.

### Nukes
When Xerox Khan was copying blueprints, the mahAmlechCha and their vassals could have potentially prevented him from taking it back. But they looked the other way. We even believe they could have prevented the chIna-s from transferring tech (North Korea only came in later). However, they thought it was OK because they wanted it that way -- they could lose the counterbalance for India (if you have doubts, compare it with the lengths they go with the Islamic state in Iran). 

Other than Abdus Salam, it seems their physicists were not all that good and without the chIna-s they could not have achieved it. Agree Abdus Salam was as jihadi as rest. Met H who personally knew Salam -- was clearly jihadi.

If the reports are true, that they are helping TSP with some nuclear safety tests, then there could be more to it than meets the eye. Are they frantically advising TSP about how to harden nuclear defenses?

> There was an interview with a Danish intelligence officer who said the Americans explicitly intervened and asked them NOT to track Xerox Khan after they alerted them about his pilferage. That video has now been scrubbed off the web.

### Internal foes
One can increasingly see why the Occident wanted forces like the Kangress and the Broom lording over India: it would have devolved into a country incapable of fighting even in times of a crisis.

Sometimes, one wonders who activates the internal first responders on behalf of the marUnmatta-s: Are they responding to their marUnmatta friends, or are they preemptively self-activating? On issues that matter most to the mlechCha-s, they clearly act on their signal, but with marUnmatta-s, they probably self-activate.

One of the questions is who activated the communists within India (urban Naxals to use that bollywood guy's term) to bat for TSP& TSB. We infer that the marUnmatta-s don't have deep ties with them, though they play on the same side. The urban naxals are mostly forces operated by sora & his shaNDasainya, and in other cases the chIna-s. We believe that the sorAdi have seen this as an opportunity to activate their first responders here. However, we also suspect that chIna-s might be fishing in these troubled waters to keep them going.


### Turkey
The Turkish military assistance to the Mogol rump state TSP, is the continuation of a long tradition of assistance from the days of the Osman Khalifate. A brief historical detour:

While the Osmans initially aided the Ozbek Khan Obaidallah against the Mogols, they later became allied with Baboor.  In the 1st battle of Panipat (1526), Baboor was guided by the Osman artillery master Ustad Ali Quli, who deployed his cannons in the famous "Anatolian formation" behind a screening array of carts. Quli was known for casting big guns. This tactic was critical in demolishing Ibrahim Lodi. More generally, Baboor's entire deployment of firearms and heavy artillery was advised by Osman models (following their tactics used in smashing the Safavids of Iran a few years earlier).

Osman Sultan Selim the Grim aided the Mogols with not just guns but also advisers and Akinjis +++(=irregular light cavalry)+++, including in the campaign against rAnA saMgrama.

The tradition of Osman Rumi Khans, starting with Mustafa Rumi, who assisted Baboor, continued down to the later Padishahs, with multiple Rumi Khans aiding and being embedded in the Mogol forces. Guns with wheeled wooden tripods and barqandaz musketeers were introduced by the Rumis to the Mogol forces.


## Goal
It has never been about Kashmir, territorial disputes etc, it has been one long procession of ghazvats starting with Omar.

> देश के अमर सेनानी महाराणा प्रताप को उनकी जयंती पर कोटि-कोटि नमन। मातृभूमि के स्वाभिमान की रक्षा के लिए उन्होंने जिस साहस और शौर्य का परिचय दिया था, वह आज भी हमारे वीर-वीरांगनाओं के लिए पथ-प्रदर्शक बना है। मां भारती को समर्पित उनका पराक्रमी जीवन देशवासियों को सदैव प्रेरित करता रहेगा। - NaMo

Very apposite as the very same forces the great pratApa siMha fought continue to be arrayed against us in the latest ghazvat. H should take a moment to realize his significance as a little island of H resistance engulfed by the vast evil mata squatting on our lands. We have come a long way from there due to the inspiration he provided and can hopefully keep it that way.
