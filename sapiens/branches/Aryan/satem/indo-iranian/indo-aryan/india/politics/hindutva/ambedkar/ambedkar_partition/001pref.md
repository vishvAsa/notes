**PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION**

  
  

 The problem of Pakistan has given a headache to everyone, more so to
me than to anybody else. I cannot help recalling with regret how much of
my time it has consumed when so much of my other literary work of
greater importance to me than this is held up for want of it. I
therefore hope that this second edition will also be the last. I trust
that before it is exhausted either the question will be settled or
withdrawn.

 There are four respects in which this second edition differs from
the first.

**[/1/](#n01)**The first edition contained many misprints which formed
the subject of complaints from many readers as well as reviewers. In
preparing this edition, I have taken as much care as is possible to
leave no room for complaint on this score. The first edition consisted
only of three parts. Part V is an addition. It contains my own views on
the various issues involved in the problem of Pakistan. It has been
added because of the criticism levelled against the first edition that
while I wrote about Pakistan, I did not state what views I held on the
subject. The present edition differs from the first in another respect.
The maps contained in the first edition are retained but the number of
appendices have been enlarged. In the first edition there were only
eleven appendices. The present edition has twenty-five. To this edition
I have also added an index which did not find a place in the first
edition.

 The book appears to have supplied a real want. I have seen how the
thoughts, ideas, and arguments contained in it have been pillaged by
authors, politicians and editors of newspapers to support their sides. I
am sorry they did not observe the decency of acknowledging the source
even when they lifted not merely the argument but also the language of
the book. But that is a matter I do not mind. I am glad that the book
has been of service to Indians who are faced with this knotty problem of
Pakistan. The fact that Mr. Gandhi and Mr. Jinnah in their recent talks
cited the book as an authority on the subject which might be consulted
with advantage bespeaks the worth of the book.

 The book by its name might appear to deal only with the X.Y.Z. of
Pakistan. It does more than that. It is an analytical presentation of
Indian history and Indian politics in their communal aspects. As such,
it is intended to explain the A.B.C. of Pakistan also. The book is more
than a mere treatise on Pakistan. The material relating to Indian
history and Indian politics contained in this book is so large and so
varied that it might well be called Indian Political What is What.

 The book has displeased both Hindus as well as Muslims though the
reasons for the dislike of the Hindus are different from the reasons for
the dislike of the Muslims. I am not sorry for this reception given to
my book. That it is disowned by the Hindus and unowned by the Muslims is
to me the best evidence that it has the vices of neither, and that from
the point of view of independence of thought and fearless presentation
of facts the book is not a party production.

 Some people are sore because what I have said has hurt them. I have
not, I confess, allowed myself to be influenced by fears of wounding
either individuals or classes, or shocking opinions however respectable
they may be. I have often felt regret in pursuing this course, but
remorse never. Those whom I may have offended must forgive me, in
consideration of the honesty and disinterestedness of my aim. I do not
claim to have written dispassionately, though I trust I have written
without prejudice. It would be hardly possible--1 was going to say
decent--for an Indian to be calm when he talks of his country and thinks
of the times. In dealing with the question of Pakistan, my object has
been to draw a perfectly accurate, and at the same time, a suggestive
picture of the situation as I see it. Whatever points of strength and
weakness I have discovered on either side, I have brought them boldly
forward. I have taken pains to throw light on the mischievous effects
that are likely to proceed from an obstinate and impracticable course of
action.

 The witness of history regarding the conflict between the forces of
the authority of the State and of anti-State nationalism within, has
been uncertain, if not equivocal. As Prof. Friedmann**[/2/](#n02)**
observes:â€”

> "There is not a single modem State which has not, at one time or
> another, forced a recalcitrant national group to live under its
> authority. Scots, Bretons, Catalans, Germans, Poles, Czechs, Finns,
> all have, at some time or another, been compelled to accept the
> authority of a more powerful State whether they liked it or not.
> Often, as in Great Britain or France, force eventually led to
> co-operation and a co-ordination of State authority and national
> cohesion. But in many cases, such as those of Germany, Poland, Italy
> and a host of Central European and Balkan countries, the forces of
> Nationalism did not rest until they had thrown off the shackles of
> State Power and formed a State of their own. . . ."

 In the last edition, I depicted the experience of countries in which
the State engaged itself in senseless suppression of nationalism and
withered away in the attempt. In this edition I have added by way of
contrast the experience of other countries, to show that given the will
to live together it is not impossible for diverse communities and even
for diverse nations to live in the bosom of one State. It might be said
that in tendering advice to both sides, I have used terms more
passionate than they need have been. If I have done so it is because I
felt that the manner of the physician who tries to surprise the vital
principle in each paralyzed organ in order to goad it to action was best
suited to stir up the average Indian who is complacent if not somnolent,
who is unsuspecting if not ill-informed, to realize what is happening. I
hope my effort will have the desired effect.

 I cannot close this preface without thanking Prof. Manohar B.
Chitnis of the Khalsa College, Bombay, and Mr. K. V. Chitre for their
untiring labours to remove all printer's and clerical errors that had
crept into the first edition, and to see that this edition is free from
all such blemishes. I am also very grateful to Prof. Chitnis for the
preparation of the Index, which has undoubtedly enhanced the utility of
the book.

======================

**[/1/](#m01)** In the first edition there unfortunately occurred
through oversight in proof correction a discrepancy between the
population figures in the different districts of Bengal and the map
showing the lay-out of Pakistan as applied to Bengal which had resulted
in two districts which should have been included in the Pakistan area
being excluded from it. In this edition, this error has been rectified
and the map and the figures have been brought into conformity.
