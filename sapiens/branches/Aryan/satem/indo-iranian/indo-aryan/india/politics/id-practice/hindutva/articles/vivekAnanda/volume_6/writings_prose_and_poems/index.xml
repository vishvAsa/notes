      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;historical-evolution-of-india&#34;&gt;HISTORICAL EVOLUTION OF INDIA&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;OM TAT SAT&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Om Namo Bhagavate Rāmakrishnāya&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;नासतः सत् जायते — Existence cannot be produced by non-existence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Non-existence can never be the cause of what exists. Something cannot&#xA;come out of nothing. That the law of causation is omnipotent and knows&#xA;no time or place when it did not exist is a doctrine as old as the Aryan&#xA;race, sung by its ancient poet-seers, formulated by its philosophers,&#xA;and made the corner-stone upon which the Hindu man even of today builds&#xA;his whole scheme of life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-story-of-the-boy-gopala&#34;&gt;THE STORY OF THE BOY GOPALA&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;O mother! I am so afraid to go to school through the woods alone; other&#xA;boys have servants or somebody to bring them to school or take them home&#xA;— why cannot I have someone to bring me home?&amp;rdquo; — thus said Gopāla, a&#xA;little Brahmin boy, to his mother one winter afternoon when he was&#xA;getting ready for school. The school hours were in the morning and&#xA;afternoon. It was dark when the school closed in the afternoon, and the&#xA;path lay through the woods.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I am sick of this unending force;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;these shows they please no more.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;This ever running, never reaching,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;nor e&amp;rsquo;en a distant glimpse of shore!&lt;br&gt;&#xA;From life to life I&amp;rsquo;m waiting at the gates,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;alas, they open not.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Dim are my eyes with vain attempt&lt;br&gt;&#xA;to catch one ray long sought.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;On little life&amp;rsquo;s high, narrow bridge&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I stand and see below&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The struggling, crying, laughing throng.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;For what? No one can know.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;In front yon gates stand frowning dark,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;and say: &amp;ldquo;No farther way,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;This is the limit; tempt not Fate,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;bear it as best you may;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Go, mix with them and drink this cup&lt;br&gt;&#xA;and be as mad as they.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Who dares to know but comes to grief;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;stop then, and with them stay.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Alas for me. I cannot rest.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;This floating bubble, earth —&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Its hollow form, its hollow name,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;its hollow death and birth —&lt;br&gt;&#xA;For me is nothing. How I long&lt;br&gt;&#xA;to get beyond the crust&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Of name and form! Ah! ope the gates;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;to me they open must.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Open the gates of light, O Mother, to me Thy tired son.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Of whom was that?&lt;br&gt;&#xA;What was in the depths of darkness thick?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Death was not then, nor immortality,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The night was neither separate from day,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;But motionless did &lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; vibrate&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Alone, with Its own glory one —&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Beyond &lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; nothing did exist.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

At the time of writing it, he&#xA;was probably crossing the eastern Mediterranean.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In blue sky floats a multitude of clouds —&lt;br&gt;&#xA;White, black, of snaky shades and thicknesses;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;An orange sun, about to say farewell,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Touches the massed cloud-shapes with streaks of red.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The wind blows as it lists, a hurricane&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Now carving shapes, now breaking them apart:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Fancies, colours, forms, inert creations —&lt;br&gt;&#xA;A myriad scenes, though real, yet fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In&#xA;matters of religious duty the Vedas are the only capable authority.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Puranas and other religious scriptures are all denoted by the word&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Smriti&amp;rdquo;. And their authority goes so far as they follow the Vedas and&#xA;do not contradict them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Truth is of two kinds: (1) that which is cognisable by the five ordinary&#xA;senses of man, and by reasonings based thereon; (2) that which is&#xA;cognisable by the subtle, supersensuous power of Yoga.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-bengali-language&#34;&gt;THE BENGALI LANGUAGE&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Translated from &lt;a href=&#34;b6030_bengali.pdf&#34;&gt;Bengali&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Written for the&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Udbodhan&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In our country, owing to all learning being in Sanskrit from the ancient&#xA;times, there has arisen an immeasurable gulf between the learned and the&#xA;common folk. All the great personages, from Buddha down to Chaitanya and&#xA;Ramakrishna, who came for the well-being of the world, taught the common&#xA;people in the language of the people themselves. Of course, scholarship&#xA;is an excellent thing; but cannot scholarship be displayed through any&#xA;other medium than a language that is stiff and unintelligible, that is&#xA;unnatural and merely artificial? Is there no room for art in the spoken&#xA;language? What is the use of creating an unnatural language to the&#xA;exclusion of the natural one? Do you not think out your scholastic&#xA;researches in the language which you are accustomed to speak at home?&#xA;Why then do you introduce such a queer and unwieldy thing when you&#xA;proceed to put them in black and white? The language in which you think&#xA;out philosophy and science in your mind, and argue with others in public&#xA;— is not that the language for writing philosophy and science? If it is&#xA;not, how then do you reason out those truths within yourselves and in&#xA;company of others in that very language? The language in which we&#xA;naturally express ourselves, in which we communicate our anger, grief,&#xA;or love, etc.— there cannot be a fitter language than that. We must&#xA;stick to that idea, that manner of expression, that diction and all. No&#xA;artificial language can ever have that force, and that brevity and&#xA;expressiveness, or admit of being given any turn you please, as that&#xA;spoken language. Language must be made like pure steel — turn and twist&#xA;it any way you like, it is again the same — it cleaves a rock in twain&#xA;at one stroke, without its edge being turned. Our language is becoming&#xA;artificial by imitating the slow and pompous movement — and only that —&#xA;of Sanskrit. And language is the chief means and index of a nation&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;progress.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;matter-for-serious-thought&#34;&gt;MATTER FOR SERIOUS THOUGHT&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Translated from &lt;a href=&#34;b6034_bhabbar_katha.pdf&#34;&gt;Bengali&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A man presented himself to be blessed by a sight of the Deity. He had an&#xA;access of joy and devotion at the sight; and perhaps to pay back the&#xA;good he received, he burst out into a song. In one corner of the hall,&#xA;reclining against a pillar, was Chobeji dozing. He was the priest in the&#xA;temple, an athlete, a player on the guitar, was a good hand in&#xA;swallowing two jugfuls of Bhāng (an intoxicating drink.), and had&#xA;various other qualifications besides. All on a sudden, a dreadful noise&#xA;assailing his tympanum, the fantastic universe conjured up under the&#xA;influence of the inebriating liquor vanished for a moment from Chobeji&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;enormous chest of two and forty inches! And casting his crimson-tinged,&#xA;languid eyes around in search of the cause of disturbance to his&#xA;tranquil mind, Chobeji discovered that in front of the God was a man&#xA;singing, overwhelmed with his own feelings, in a tune as touching as the&#xA;scouring of cauldrons in a festive house, and, in so doing, he was&#xA;subjecting the shades of the whole host of musical masters like Nārada,&#xA;Bharata, Hanumān, Nāyaka, and the rest to ineffable anguish. The&#xA;mortified Chobeji in a sharp reprimanding tone addressed the man who had&#xA;been the direct obstacle to his enjoyment of that peculiar bliss of&#xA;inebriation, &amp;ldquo;Hello, my friend, what are you shouting like that for,&#xA;without caring for time or tune?&amp;rdquo; Quick came the response, &amp;ldquo;What need I&#xA;care for time or tune? I am trying to win the Lord&amp;rsquo;s heart.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Humph!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;retorted Chobeji, &amp;ldquo;do you think the Lord is such a fool? You must be&#xA;mad! You could not win my heart even — and has the Lord less brains than&#xA;I?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;shivas-demon&#34;&gt;SHIVA&amp;rsquo;S DEMON&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(This incomplete story was found among Swamiji&amp;rsquo;s papers after he had&#xA;passed away. It is printed as the last article in the&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;6042_shivas_demon.pdf&#34;&gt;Bengali&lt;/a&gt; book &lt;em&gt;Bhābbār Kathā&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Baron K— lived in a district of Germany. Born in all aristocratic&#xA;family, he inherited high rank, honour and wealth even in early youth;&#xA;besides, he was highly cultured and endowed with many accomplishments. A&#xA;good many charming, affluent, and young women of rank craved for his&#xA;love. And which father or mother does not wish for a son-in-law of such&#xA;parts, culture, handsomeness, social position, lineage, and youthful&#xA;age? An aristocratic beauty had attracted Baron K— also, but the&#xA;marriage was still far off. In spite of all rank and wealth, Baron K—&#xA;had none to call his own, except a sister who was exquisitely beautiful&#xA;and educated. The Baron had taken a vow that he would marry only after&#xA;his sister had chosen her fiancé and the marriage celebrated with due&#xA;éclat and rich dowries from him. She had been the apple of her parents&#39;&#xA;eyes. Baron K— did not want to enjoy a married life, before her wedding.&#xA;Besides, the custom in this Western country is that the son does not&#xA;live in his father&amp;rsquo;s or in any relative&amp;rsquo;s family after marriage; the&#xA;couple live separately. It may be possible for the husband to live with&#xA;his wife in his father-in-law&amp;rsquo;s house but a wife will never live in her&#xA;father-in-law&amp;rsquo;s. So K— postponed his marriage till his sister&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
