  <p>TWO<br>
The Case of Sita Ram Goel</p>
<p>IN THE COURT OF SH. S. K. KAUSHIK: ADDL.<br>
CHMF MET&rsquo;ROPOUTAN MAGISTRATE: DEUH</p>
<p>State Vs.</p>
<p>Sita Ram etc.<br>
FIR No. 72/86<br>
P.S. Darya Ganj<br>
U/S 153A/295A IPC</p>
<p>ORDER</p>
<p>This order shall dispose of the question of charge in this case. The
State has sought prosecution of accused Sita Ram Goel as publisher and
Smt. Ram Kali as printer of a book published under the name of &lsquo;The Dead
Hand of Islam&rsquo; written by foreign author Colin Main, u/s 153A and 295A
IPC, on the ground that the book contains highly objectionable and
sacrilegious material/references at page from 2 to 15 which tend to hurt
the religious sentiments of Muslim community and may promote
disaffection and hatred between Hindus and Muslims.</p>
<p>2. The Ld. defence counsel Sh. Alok Kumar contended that the charge
against the accused persons is groundless because it is not the opinion
of the accused persons which is contained in the book; that the book was
written by a foreign author of Australia; that even the author of the
book has not given his opinion but it is the opinion of several eminent
authors compiled by Colin Main in form of a booklet from the work of
eminent authors and the Quran. The Ld. defence counsel also contended
that the book is in English and contains as many as ninety references
and even a layman after going through the book cannot hold the publisher
or printer as responsible for creating any hatred, ill will etc. against
Muslims. The defence counsel also submitted that the charge against the
accused persons in view of the case law on the subject is totally
groundless. He referred to the following authorities in support of his
contention:</p>

<p>3. Now it is to be seen as to what law has been laid in the authorities
relied upon by the Ld. defence counsel. In AIR 1927 All. 649 it has been
held at page 652 that it must of course be recognized that in countries
where there is religious freedom a certain latitude must of necessity be
conceded in respect of the free expression of religious opinions
together with a certain measure of liberty to criticise the religious
beliefs of others, but it is contrary to all reason to imagine that
liberty to criticise includes a license to resort to the vile and
abusive language.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>4. In AIR 1939 Rangoon 649 it was held at page 200 that: u/s 295A,
however, the prosecution must prove more than u/s 298 IPC, they must
show insult for the sake of insulting and with an intention which
springs from malice and malice alone. To a charge under this section,
therefore, it would be a defence to say that I had no malicious
intention towards a class, but I did intend to wound or shock the
feelings of an individual so that attention might, however rudely, be
called to the reform which I had in view.</p>
<p>5. In AIR 1943 Patna 382 it his been held at page 385 that:<br>
the essence of an offence u/s 153A, is malicious intention. I do not
think this section was ever intended to apply to the case of the
honest agitator, whose primary object is to secure redress of certain
wrongs, rules or fancies, and who is not actuated by the base
mentality of a mere mischief monger. If the writer is expressing views
which he holds only, however wrong they may be, and has no malicious
intention, I do not think he can be brought within the mischief of
this section.</p></blockquote>
<ol start="6">
<li>In 1957 SCR 860, the question for consideration by the Supreme Court
was whether Section 295A IPC is ultra vires and unconstitutional. Das
CJ., while holding Section 295A as constitutional held at page 867 as
under:-</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Section 295A does not penalise any and every act of insult to or
attempt to insult the religion or the religious beliefs of a class of
citizens but it penalises only those acts of insults to or those
varieties of attempts to insult the religion or the religious beliefs
of a class of citizens which are perpetrated with the deliberate and
malicious intention of outraging the religious feelings of that class.
Insults to religion offered unwittingly or carelessly or without any
deliberate or malicious intention of outraging the religious feelings
of that class do not come within the section. It only punishes the
aggravated form of insult to religion when it is perpetrated with the
deliberate and malicious intention of outraging the religious feelings
of that class.</p></blockquote>
<ol start="7">
<li>In AIR 1964 Madras 258, the matter for consideration before the court
were three articles published in the paper &lsquo;Nathikam&rsquo; on 16.12.1960,
6.1.1961 and 13.1.1961. The first article dealt with the punishment of
stoning to death prescribed in Koran to persons found guilty of
adultery. The second article was about the punishment prescribed in
Koran for theft. The court did not consider the third article as it
found it unnecessary for the purpose. In this case, the court laid down
the following law while discussing Section 295A:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;The right of freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Art.
19 (1) (a) of the Constitution will no doubt enable a citizen to
criticise the religion and the religious beliefs of a class of
persons. Article 25 of the Constitution confers a right on all persons
to freedom of conscience and a right freely to profess, practice,
propagate religion subject to certain conditions and a person is
entitled to express and propagate his views so long as he does not
affect the public order, morality and health or offend any of the
provisions of the Constitution or laws of the land.&rsquo;</p></blockquote>
<ol start="8">
<li>In AIR 1971 Bombay 56, the matter for consideration before the court
was whether the book called &ldquo;Gandhi Hatya Ani Mee&rdquo; (Gandhi-assassination
and I) written by Gopal Vinayak Godse was liable to be forfeited because
it contained objectionable material. The court while holding that this
book did not contain anything objectionable, laid down the following
principles in para 64 of the judgement:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>While inquiring whether such a charge can be sustained on the data
disclosed in the order of forfeiture, namely, the offending passages
read in the context of the book as a whole, it is important to
remember that: (1) under Section 153A it is not necessary to prove
that as a result of the objectionable matter, enemity or hatred was in
fact caused between the different classes. (2) intention to promote
enmity or hatred, apart from what appears from the writing itself, is
not a necessary ingredient of the offence. It is enough to show that
the language of the writing is of a nature calculated to promote
feelings of enmity or hatred, for a person must be presumed to intend
the natural consequences of his act. (3) The matter charged as being
within the mischief of Section 153A must be read as a whole. One
cannot rely on stray, isolated passages for proving the charge nor
indeed can one take a sentence here and a sentence there and connect
them by a meticulous process of inferential reasoning. (4) For judging
what are the natural or probable consequences of the writing, it is
permissible to take into consideration the class of readers for whom
the book is primarily meant as also the state of feelings between the
different classes or communities at the relevant time. (5) If the
writing is calculated to promote feelings of enmity or hatred, it is
no defence to a charge under Sections 153A that the writing contains a
truthful account of past events or is otherwise supported by good
authority. If a writer is disloyal to history it might be easier to
prove that history was distorted in order to achieve a particular end
as e.g. to promote feelings of enmity or hatred between different
classes or communities. But adherence to the strict path of history is
not by itself a complete defence to a charge under Section 153A. In
fact, greater the truth, greater the impact of the writing on the
minds of its readers, if the writing is otherwise calculated to
produce mischief.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ld. defence counsel also referred to para 253 of the judgement which
reads as under:-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have a fair acquaintance with the Marathi language but we must
frankly confess that many a passage had to be read with more than
ordinary care in order to appreciate why it is said to be of an
objectionable nature. A common reader has, we suppose, neither the
leisure nor the learning to digest the wealth of words which the book
contains. He shall have to resurrect some stray incendiary material.</p></blockquote>
<ol start="9">
<li>
<p>In the case reported as 1971 Cr. LJ 1973, the matter for
consideration before the court was whether the book entitled &ldquo;Samman Ke
liye dharm Parivartan Karen&rdquo; contained objectionable material causing
insult to Hinduism or to promote disharmony and hatred between different
castes so as to be punishable u/s 153A or u/s 295A IPC. It was contended
before the court that this book promoted hatred between Sudras and
Harijans on the one hand and members of the higher Hindu castes on the
other hand. The court after considering the objectionable passages of
the book held that a rational criticism of religious tenets, couched in
restrained language, cannot amount to an offence either u/s 153A or
Section 295A IPC. The court did not find anything objectionable in the
passages which stated that the Hindu religion is blemished; that Hindus
lack sympathy, equality and independence; that in Hinduism there is no
room for feeling of humanity and that in Hinduism progress for the
individual is impossible. The court also did not find anything
objectionable in passages 13 to 19 because they commented adversely on
Hindu scriptures viz, the Vedas and the Bhagvad Geeta. In this book the
author asserted that the hymns of Vedas were composed by hundreds of
people who were undeveloped and uncultivated. The court did not find it
objectionable because this criticism was in the context of refuting the
orthodox view that the Vedas are of divine origin. The court also held
that there was nothing to take offence if the author of the book cited a
certain Shabarswami as saying that the persons who composed the Vedas
were fools or mad men. Regarding the comments on the Geeta in some of
the passage in the book describing it as a &lsquo;song of shepherds&rsquo; or as a
&lsquo;political book&rsquo; the court held that these comments were innocuous. The
court also did not find anything objectionable in the book because it
referred to Hanuman as unchaste. The court, therefore, held that after
reading the book as a whole and bearing in mind its avowed purpose, none
of the passages complained of could be said to be punishable u/s 153A or
295A IPC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case reported as 1980 CrLJ 448, the matter under
consideration before the court was whether the book entitled
&ldquo;Munaqib-e-Ahle Bait&rdquo;<a href="#1">1</a> written by Maulana Azizul Haq Kusar, which
criticised the role of Amir Moavia who was held in high esteem by the
Sunni Muslims, was likely to hurt the feelings of Sunni Muslims. The
court held that:-</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The criminality u/s 153A of the Penal Code does not attach to the
things said or done but to the manner in which it is said or done. If
the words spoken or written are couched in temperate, dignified and
mild language and do not have the tendency to insult the feelings or
the deepest religious convictions of any section of the people, penal
consequences do not follow.</p></blockquote>
<ol start="11">
<li>In the case reported as 1983 CrLJ 1446, the matter for consideration
before the court was whether the two articles published in the Marathi
Weekly known as &lsquo;SHREE&rsquo; were containing objectionable material so as to
attract Section 153A IPC. In these two articles the author tried to show
that in pre-Islamic times, the ancient Indian culture and Hindu religion
were in vogue in Arabia and that the Islamic religion, culture and art
were greatly influenced by the Indian culture and religion. Their
Lordships after going through the articles found nothing objectionable
and held that:-</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>It is true that sometimes in a given case even a truthful account may
come within the mischief of S-153A of the Penal Code. But, this will
be too broad a proposition. Different considerations will prevail when
we are to consider a scholarly article on history and religion based
upon research with the help of a number of reference books. It will be
very difficult for the State to contend that a narration of history
would promote violence, enmity or hatred. If such a contention is
accepted a day will come when that part of history which is
unpalatable to a particular religion will have to be kept in cold
storage on the pretext that the publication of such history would
constitute an offence punishable under Sec. 153A of the Penal Code.
The scope of S-153A cannot be enlarged to such an extent with a view
to thwart history. For obvious reasons, history and historical events
cannot be allowed to be looked as a secret on a specious plea that if
the history is made known to a person who is interested to know the
history, there is likelihood of someone else being hurt. Similarly, an
article containing a historical research cannot be allowed to be
thwarted on such a plea that the publication of such a material would
be hit by S. 153A. Otherwise, the position will be very precarious. A
nation will have to forget its own history and in due course the
nation will have no history at all. This result cannot be said to have
been intended by the Legislature when S. 153A. of the Penal Code and
S. 95 of the CRPC were enacted. If anybody intends to extinguish the
history (by prohibiting its publication) of the nation on the pretext
of taking action under the above sections, his act will have to be
treated as malafide one.</p></blockquote>
<ol start="12">
<li>
<p>In 1985 CrLJ 797, the matter before Patna High Court for
consideration was whether the revised edition of the book &ldquo;Vishwa
Itihhas&rdquo;<a href="#2">2</a> in Hindi written as a Text Book for Inter class of
Bhagalpur University and whether the book &ldquo;Madhya Kalin Arab&rdquo;<a href="#3">3</a>
were liable for forfeiture u/s 295A IPC. The author of &ldquo;Vishwa Itihhas&rdquo;
in writing about Islam religion had relied on the authoritative
Historical works like the &ldquo;Outline of History&rdquo; by H.G. Wells, the
&ldquo;Muhamad at Madina&rdquo; by W.M.G. Watt and the &ldquo;Middle East&rdquo; by S.N. Fisher
etc. In discussing the Muhammadan religion he had used his dispassionate
expertise as a teacher of history and in fact had praised Prophet Hazrat
Mohammad when there was occasion to do so. The court did not find
anything objectionable in the book titled as &ldquo;Vishwa Itihhas&rdquo; because
the views expressed in the offending portion of the book were not his
own. Rather the author disagreed with the critical assessment and
according to his own views Mohammad Sahib was not only the reformer but
also a statesman. However, the court held that the offensive paragraphs
of the book &ldquo;Madhya Kalin Arab&rdquo; were offensive in the extreme because
the author projected the personal and private life of the Prophet in his
own personal assessment in terms patently derogatory and denigratory.
The court also held that the offending publication is to be viewed as a
whole and the intent of the author has to be gathered from the broader
prospective and not merely from a few solitary lines or quotations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 1955 (3) Supreme Court Cases, 214, the appellants were convicted
under Sec. 124A and 153A IPC, for raising following slogans, on 31.10.83
the day when Mrs. Indira Gandhi was assassinated, in a crowded place in
front of Neelam Cinema in Chandigarh:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>(a) KHALISTAN ZINDABAD<br>
(b) RAJ KAREGA KHALSA, and<br>
(c) HINDUAN NUU PUNJAB CHON KHAD KE CHHADANGE, HUN MAUKA AYA HAI RAJ
KAYAM KARAN DA.<a href="#4">4</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Regarding the charge under Sec. 124A IPC, it was held that the casual
raising of slogans once or twice by two individuals alone cannot be said
to be aimed at exciting or attempting to excite hatred or disaffection
towards the government. Regarding the offence under Sec. 153A IPC it was
held:-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In our opinion only where the written or spoken words have the
tendency or intention of creating public disorder or disturbance of
law and order or affect public tranquility, that the law needs to step
in to prevent such an activity. The facts and circumstances of this
case unmistakenly show that there was no disturbance or semblance of
disturbance of law and order or of public order or peace and
tranquillity in the area from where the appellants were apprehended
while raising slogans on account of the activities of the appellants.
The intention to cause disorder or incite people to violence is the
sine qua non of the offence under Section 153A IPC and the prosecution
has to prove the existence of mens rea in order to succeed. In this
case, the prosecution has not been able to establish any mens rea on
the part of the appellants, as envisaged by the provisions of Section
153A IPC, by their raising casually the three slogans a couple of
times. The offence under Section 153A IPC is, therefore not, made
out.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Their Lorships also observed in para 12 of the judgement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The police officials exhibited lack of maturity and more of
sensitivity in arresting the appellants for raising the slogans which
arrest - and not the casual raising of one or two slogans - could have
created a law and order situation, keeping in view the tense situation
prevailing on the date of assassination of Smt. Indira Gandhi. In
situations like this, oversensitivity sometimes is counter-productive
and can result in inviting trouble.</p></blockquote>
<ol start="14">
<li>In 1995 CrLJ 1316, the matter under consideration was, whether the
editorials published in the newspaper &lsquo;Samana&rsquo; after riots took place in
Bombay, as an aftermath of demolition of Babri Masjid contained
objectionable material so as to attract provisions of Section 153A and
153B IPC. The petitioner moved Bombay High Court for a writ of Mandamus
to the State to register cases u/s 153A and 153B IPC. Some of the
offending portions of the editorials under consideration before the
court were as under:-</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>i) &ldquo;Samana 2nd December 1992.<br>
Municipal Deputy Commissioner Mr. Khairnar risked his life to use
bulldozer in Bhendi Bazar which has become a heaven of Pakistani
infiltrators and anti-national Muslims, Moulvis and Mullahs have
corrupted Bhendi Bazar. The position of treachery (anti-nationalism)
is flowing through every vein (lane) of Bhendi Bazar. Is Bhendi Bazar
a part of India (let alone Bombay) at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>ii) &ldquo;And which is this minority community? The Muslim traitors who
have partitioned this country and have not even allowed us to breathe
ever since then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>iii) &ldquo;<em>Crush the traitors</em>.<br>
Muslims should draw a lesson from this fact (the demolition of the
Babri Masjid) otherwise they will meet the same fate as the Babri
Masjid. The &lsquo;Mini Pakistan&rsquo; of Bombay inhabited by Muslims&hellip;..<br>
Those Muslims who are indulging in the act of violence on the streets
and are desecrating deities and temples are traitors. They have no
religion, no country, no God, no culture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>iv) &ldquo;Streams of treason and poison have been flowing through the
cities and Mohallas of this country. These Mohallas are inhabited by
fanatical Muslims. They are loyal to Pakistan. Riots occur only in
those cities and Mohallas with a growing Muslim population. It is
clear from this fact that the root cause of riots lies in the Muslim
community and its attitude. There are 3%. Muslims spread all over
Delhi. But they are concentrated in Old Delhi in areas surrounding
Jama Masjid. Therefore, riots occur in this area. They also take place
in Bhendi Bazar. Musafirkhana, Bhiwandi, Malagaon and Muslim majority
areas of Bhopal. Riots break out wherever Muslims enjoy domination.
They stop as soon as the Muslims are at the receiving end. A similar
thing is happening today. Muslims revolt in their own areas. They beat
Hindus, demolish temples and attack the police. The Government is
appeasing these traitors. It is learnt that Pakistan has manufactured
seven bombs. But the bomb that has been made in India with the
blessings of Pakistan is more dangerous. Now Pakistan need not cross
the borders for launching an attack on India. Twenty-five crore
Muslims loyal to Pakistan will stage an insurrection. One of those
seven bombs made by Pakistan lies hidden in Hindustan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(v) &ldquo;The fanatical traitors have launched an ugly dance of death.
Loyal citizens of India have sacrificed their lives in this fire which
has been spreading fast. In the Mohallas inhabited by fanatics which
we call &lsquo;Mini Pakistan&rsquo; were the centres where the cruelty and
treachery of traitors caused havoc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(vi) &ldquo;How to solve the question? The country was partitioned on 15th
August 1947 on the basis of religion. That part of the country which
has come to be known as Hindustan is the country of Hindus which
should be conceded by all. No objections need be raised about the
presence of Muslims, Sikhs, Christians and people of other faiths. But
if they indulge in- the name of religion in anti-national activities,
such activities should be completely defeated. Muslims have been able
to hold Hindus to ransom because the Central Govt. has not adopted a
firm policy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(vii) &ldquo;The areas where the fires of riots are still smouldering are
Deonar, Govandi, Nirmal Nagar, Dharavi and Behrampada. They have
become heavens for traitors.</p>
<p>They ignited fires in Bombay and they are still itching for a fight.
Is the police going to protect them? Why do V.P. Singh, Chandra Shekar
and Shabana Azmi keep visiting the Mohallas of traitors? Many Hindu
habitations have been reduced to ashes due to the assaults launched by
anti-national Muslims.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(viii) &ldquo;That midnight violence erupted in Bombay. The Muslims of
Bhendi Bazar, Null Bazar, Dongri and Pydhoni, the areas which we call
&lsquo;Mini Pakistan&rsquo; that are determined to uproot Hindustan took out their
weapons.<br>
Stop the armed bands of traitors before it is too late. Hand over the
&lsquo;Mini Pakistan&rsquo; of Bombay to the army. Unless the rioting traitors are
not on the spot, the normalcy which the police refer to would not be
restored.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(ix) &ldquo;The ugly and violent form of Muslim traitors was witnessed by
the city yesterday. During the twenty-six year tenure of M.K. Gandhi,
Muslims from Malabar to Noakhali grew progressively violent and Hindus
became non-violent.<br>
Our prophecy has come true. A Muslim whichever country he belongs to,
whichever position he occupies is first a Muslim. To him his religion
is the first concern. Nation is of secondary importance to him. In the
last two days patriotic people have been subjected to attacks. These
attacks constitute attacks on the nation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(x) &ldquo;A special column appeared in daily Samna of 9.4.1993 under the
caption Question to Chief Minister, Home Minister and Police
Commissioner by Shivsena Chief.</p>
<p>Hindus will not be crushed to death by the politics or pressure
tactics and Muslims terrorism.<br>
The killing of Hindus in Bombay is the result of inaction on your
part. If you cannot stop the way in which Muslims and in your language
minorities are slaughtering us then we have to follow their ways for
self-defence. This is not the instigation but indignation in my mind.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<ol start="15">
<li>
<p>Their Lordships held that all the above offending portions of the
editorials did not contain any material so as to fall within the purview
of Sections 153A and 153B of IPC because the offending paragraphs, when
read in the context and as a whole, do not refer to the Muslims as a
whole but only to Pakistani infiltrators and anti-national Muslims. It
was also held that the article criticising the tendency of those Muslims
who treat religion as first and nation as secondary does not attract the
provisions of Sec. 153A and 153B.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The law on the subject as appearing from the above authorities is
that the offending material has to be read as a whole. One cannot rely
on stray, isolated passages for proving a charge nor indeed can one take
a sentence here and a sentence there for forming any inferential
reasoning. For judging the offending writing it is important to consider
the class of readers for whom the book is primarily meant as also the
state of feelings between the different classes of communities at the
relevant time. If the offending material is a scholarly article of
history and religion based upon research with the help of a number of
reference books then such material does not come under the purview of
Sec. 153A and 295A. According to the verdict of Supreme Court the
intention to cause disorder or incite people to violence is the sine qua
non of the offence u/s 153A IPC and the prosecution has to prove the
existence of mens rea in order to succeed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Insult to religion offered unwittingly or carelessly or without any
deliberate or malicious intention to outrage the religious feelings of
that class do not come within Section 295A IPC. It is also important to
bear in mind the language of the book. It is also important to consider
while judging the offending material as to whether the views expressed
in the offending writing were of the author or somebody else whom the
author is using as a reference. Lastly it is also important to bear in
mind as to whether the offending portion refers to the Muslims as a
whole or to anti-national Muslims. With this case law on the subject now
what has to be seen is whether the accused prima facie appear to have
committed the offence u/s 153A and 295A IPC.</p>
<ol start="17">
<li>
<p>The offending passage in para 4 at page 2 of the book is: &ldquo;It is
undemocratic; it is puritanical; it is barbarously punitive; it
oppresses women; its laws are cruel to animals; it is intolerant towards
other religions; it is anti-intellectual; it places restrictions upon
art.&rdquo; These lines cannot be viewed in isolation. These lines have to be
read in the context. In fact what is told in these lines is, according
to the writer, what Hadith and Koran contain therein. The writer tries
to prove his viewpoint in the succeeding paragraphs by referring to &lsquo;The
Kuran&rsquo; translated into English by Yusuf Ali, &lsquo;Islam&rsquo; by J.A. Williams.
&lsquo;Dictionary of Islam&rsquo; by T.A. Hughes, &lsquo;The Quran&rsquo; and the book &lsquo;The Life
and Times of Mohamad&rsquo; New York 1970. Thus it is clear that writer wants
to convey about what is written in these books. These lines when read in
the context, in my considered view, do not contain any offending
material so as to attract Section 153A and 295A IPC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The next offending writing in the book is in para 3 at page 3
running from &ldquo;The <em>Koran</em> seems to regard sexual misdemeanours as being
more reprehensible than murder. For killing another human being, one has
only to make a compensation to the relatives of the person killed. These
are the only references I could find in the <em>Koran</em> to punishment, so
for most crimes we have to rely on the <em>Hadith</em>.&rdquo; This alleged offending
writing is nothing but a reference to &lsquo;The Kuran&rsquo; translated into
English by Yusuf Ali. The other alleged offending lines are on page 4 of
the book. These lines are: &ldquo;The <em>Dictionary of Islam</em> says that stoning
&lsquo;has become almost obsolete in modern times.&rsquo; So this religion is
becoming more repressive, not less. The victims will be happy to know
that they will get full funeral rites.&rdquo; &ldquo;So a man can have sex with one
of his wives at any time, and in any way that he wants&rdquo; and &ldquo;As Ramon
Lull said of it, &lsquo;What will their paradise be but a tavern of unwearied
gorging, and a brothel of perpetual turpitude?&rsquo;.&rdquo; I have gone through
these portions at page 4 of the book. There is nothing in these lines to
show that it is the opinion of the author, printer or publisher. Rather
the author has given in these lines what &lsquo;The Dictionary of Islam&rsquo; &lsquo;The
Kuran&rsquo; and one Ramon Lull say on the subject.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The other offending material is on age 5 which runs from the
lines:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The Muslim Religion is completely hypocritical on sexual matters and
it is all in favour of the men. The mere performance of ceremony
permits a man to have sex with any of his four wives in any manner and
at any time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Also the <em>Koran</em> permits men to use women captured in war for their
sexual amusement. They can also be bought. Mohammed himself received
two slave girls as a present from the governor of Egypt. One he gave
to a man called Hassan, and the other he kept for himself, and she
subsequently had a son by him. The Koran allows a Moslem to have as
many concubines as he wants&rdquo; and &ldquo;Though he placed such severe
restrictions on women, Mohammed himself had as much sex as he wanted.
His wife Ayesha who he married when she was 10, and he was 53 said of
Mohammed: &lsquo;He loved three things, women, perfume and food, and of the
first two he had his heart&rsquo;s desire&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>This alleged offending material in these lines on page 5 is in fact not
the opinion of the author but only the reference to &lsquo;The <em>Kuran</em>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Dictionary of Islam&rsquo; by T.A. Hughes. Next under consideration is the
paragraph on page 6 running from &ldquo;Woman are also oppressed in other
ways, and are regarded as being very much inferior beings. The Koran
says that men are a degree above them and that they should be obedient
to their husbands, and that for disloyalty they can be beaten.&rdquo; This
offending portion has been taken from scripture No. 2.228 and 4.34 of
&lsquo;The Quran&rsquo;. Thus again it is not the opinion of the writer.</p>
<ol start="20">
<li>The other offending writing, according to prosecution is at page 7
of the book running from:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The Islamic law says this of circumcision and clitorectomy: &lsquo;It is an
obligation for men and women to do it for themselves and their
children, and if they neglect it, the Imam may force them to it for it
is right and necessary.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In <em>The Sydney Morning Herald</em> of January 16, 1979 there was an
article on clitorectomy (female circumcision) in Egypt. Nawal
Alsa&rsquo;adwi, the Egyptian gynaecologist and psychiatrist, was reported
to have said: &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t separate sexual oppression from political and
religious oppression.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>I have gone through this writing appearing at page 7 of the book. This
writing is not the opinion of the author but it is what has been said by
author J.A. Williams in his book, &lsquo;Islam&rsquo; and the article appearing in
&lsquo;The Sydney Morning Herald&rsquo; of January 16, 1979 which have been referred
by the author in this offending portion. In my considered view there is
nothing in this paragraph to attract the provisions of Section 153A and
295A IPC.</p>
<ol start="21">
<li>
<p>The next offending portion under consideration is as given on page 8
of the book from &ldquo;Islam is the only religion in the world which teaches
that converts can be won at the point of a sword.&rdquo; I have considered
these lines. These lines cannot be considered in isolation from the
succeeding paragraphs appearing under the heading &lsquo;Intolerance Towards
Other Religions&rsquo;. Whatever has been stated by the writer in these lines
is with reference to scripture No. 47.4 of &lsquo;The Quran&rsquo; and the book &lsquo;The
Social Laws of the Quran&rsquo; written by R. Roberts. Thus, it is not the
opinion of the author but what has been stated on the subject in &lsquo;The
Quran&rsquo; and in the book referred by the author.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The other offending portion of the book is on page 9 which runs from
&ldquo;It should be remembered that the Moslems delivered an entirely
unprovoked attack on many Christian countries&rdquo; and &ldquo;This is sometimes
considered to be justified, as most people are ignorant of the nature of
the religion of Arabia before Islam. The image conjured up is of hideous
idols, and human sacrifices, and corrupt priesthood. This is not borne
out by the facts.&rdquo; I have gone through these lines as well. The author
has written these lines by referring to the book &lsquo;The Rise of Islam&rsquo;.
written by A. Bullock and the book &lsquo;The Life and Times of Mohammed&rsquo;
written by John Bagot Glubb. These lines when considered in the context
and the reference book, in my considered view do not attract any
provision of Section 153A and 295A IPC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state has also relied upon the material appearing on page 10 of
the book which runs from: &ldquo;Also the God concept of Islam can hardly be
an improvement on paganism, as even though Allah is called &rsquo;the
merciful, the beneficent&rsquo;, this is hardly borne out by his action in
torturing all non-believers in hell for ever. A description of the
Moslem hell will give some idea of the nature of the sort of god they
believe in&rdquo; and &ldquo;The intolerance of Islam towards polytheism (the
worship of more than one god) has drowned the world in blood. This was
particularly the case in India. In most parts of the world the pagans
found it easier to give in and become Moslems. But the Hindus were
prepared to fight.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I have carefully gone through these lines. The lines running from &lsquo;Also
the God……… they believe in&rsquo; have to be read in the context and that
context is in the succeeding paragraph given in the book about &lsquo;The
Moslem Hell&rsquo;. The author has described the &lsquo;Moslem Hell&rsquo; by referring to
scripture No. 4.56, 22.19, 37.65 to 67, 22.19, 14.17, 43.74, 43.75,
43.77 and 22.21. Thus the description of the hell is not of the author
but what is appearing in &lsquo;The Quran&rsquo; itself. The other offending portion
which runs from &lsquo;The intolerance……… were prepared to fight&rsquo; is also to
be considered in the context of the succeeding paragraphs which are
based on the book &lsquo;A Short History of India&rsquo; by S. Wolpert. These
offending lines cannot be viewed in isolation from the succeeding
paragraphs and when these lines are viewed in the context, I do not find
anything which may bring these lines under the purview of Section 153A
and 295A IPC. In my considered view, there is nothing offensive in the
writing as appearing on page 10 of the book.</p>
<ol start="24">
<li>
<p>The next writing under consideration is on page 11 which runs from
&ldquo;One myth that is widely believed is that Islam promoted knowledge, but
this is not the case. In later centuries a high civilisation did develop
in Moslem countries, but this was despite Islam, not because of it.&rdquo;
These lines have to be read in the context of what the author has stated
in the succeeding five paragraphs on page 12 of the book. In these five
paragraphs, the author has referred to the book &lsquo;Mohammedanism&rsquo; written
by H.R. Gibb, &lsquo;The Arab&rsquo; written by A. Nutting, &lsquo;The Life and Times of
Mohammed&rsquo; written by John Bagot Glubb and the book &lsquo;Mohammed&rsquo; written by
Pike &amp; Royston. Thus, the author has not given his opinion in these
lines on page 11 of the book but this is the opinion of the various
authors referred by the author of these lines in the succeeding five
paragraphs on page 12. In my considered view, there is nothing offensive
in these lines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The next paragraph under consideration is as given on page 12 and 13
of the book running from:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The Islamic world has sunk back into ignorance again, and even in
such great universities as Al-Azhar at Cairo - the largest Moslem
university in the world - the Koran is the basis of education. In many
schools the children learn nothing else. The Koran remains the basis
of Law, and the foundation of the Moslem legal, judicial, and
political system, and the guide to every aspect of life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another myth about Islam is that it promoted equality. In reality
Islam permitted the ultimate inequality - slavery. As Muir says of
Mohammed: &lsquo;He rivetted the fetter.&rsquo; &lsquo;There is no obligation whatever
on a Moslem to release his slaves.&rsquo; Mohammed himself had slaves -
seventeen men and eleven women.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>In fact, these lines are not of the author but these lines have been
taken from the book &lsquo;Mohammed&rsquo; written by Pike &amp; Royston and &lsquo;The Social
Laws of the Quran&rsquo; written by R. Roberts. I have carefully considered
these lines. In my considered view there is nothing in these lines which
attracts the provision of Section 153A or 295A IPC.</p>
<ol start="26">
<li>The next offending lines are as given on page 14 of the book from:
&ldquo;The example of the life of Mohammed is taken, with the <em>Koran</em> as a
guide to how life should be lived. It is therefore very important to
consider his character, and acts. When I began writing this pamphlet, I
did not think that I would like Mohammed. But the more I read about him
the less attractive did I find him.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>These lines again have to be read in the context and the context is
provided by the succeeding paragraphs appearing on page 15 and 16 of the
book. Here, the other offending portion of the book appearing on page
15-16 can also be considered which runs from:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Mohammed had people killed for the most trivial reasons. A man called
Kinana ibn Ali al-Huquiq, who was the leader of a Jewish tribe whose
fort was captured by the Moslems, tried to conceal the fact that he
had gold. When an informer told Mohammed of this he had Kinana
tortured by having hot coals put on his chest till he was nearly dead,
and then he was killed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man called Al Nadhr, who was a teller of tales, used to say of
Mohammed to his audiences: &lsquo;Are not my stories as goods as his?&rsquo; For
this Mohammed ordered that his head be struck off. After the battle of
Bedr a man called Uqba was taken prisoner. When he was being taken
away to be executed, he said to Mohammed: &lsquo;What will become of my
little children.&rsquo; Mohammed replied: &lsquo;Hellfire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be thought that I am quoting from books which are hostile to
Mohammed. This is not so. Only Muir&rsquo;s book is slightly hostile to him.
All the others go out of their way to portray him in a favourable
light. We have enough evidence in the Koran of Mohammed&rsquo;s cruel
nature, in the punishments he ordered, in his descriptions of hell,
and in his incitements to his followers to kill people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Karl Brockelmann, in his book, <em>History of the Islamic Peoples</em>, says
that Mohammed&rsquo;s death was brought on by &lsquo;an excess of pleasure-taking
in the harem.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only thing that can be said in his favour was that he did on
occasion refrain from killing people. I can&rsquo;t myself see that that is
a particularly exceptional virtue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be wondered how a man with this sort of character could
become so admired, and could attain the position he did. What is not
realised is that many people of the time detested him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After ten years of preaching in Mecca he had acquired only 70
followers. When he secured a base at Medina, he used force to
establish his religion. All the accounts that tell us of him are
biased in his favour, as death or evil awaited anyone who criticised
Mohammed or the <em>Koran</em> when Islam became the state religion of
Arabia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be said that Mohammed was a man of his time. But we must
judge him according to the standards of today, not those of 1200 years
ago because Moslems claim that Islam is a religion for our time.
Therefore it is by the ideals of this century that we should measure
it, not by those of the 7th century.</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to these standards Mohammed was merciless and fanatical. He
introduced religious hatred into large parts of the world that before
were tolerant on such matters. He curtailed the freedom of women. He
endorsed slavery. He broke up families. He ordered cruel punishments.
The world would have been, a better place if he had not succeeded in
spreading his &lsquo;religion&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>When the offending lines on page 14 are considered in the context, it
becomes clear that whatever the writer wants to convey in these lines is
with reference to the explanation appearing in succeeding paragraphs on
page 15 and 16 of the book and by referring to the books of various
authors discussed in the foregoing paragraphs of the order.</p>
<ol start="27">
<li>The alleged offending portion on page 15 is nothing but a reference
to the book. &lsquo;The Life and Times of Mohammed&rsquo; and &lsquo;Life of Mahomed&rsquo;. The
author has explained that all the books except one by Muir have praised
Mohammed and he has quoted these lines from the books which portray
Mohammed in a favourable light. Thus, the author is not giving his
opinion but he has given the opinion of various authors and the books
mentioned in the foregoing paragraphs of this order. The offending
portion of the page 16 is again a reference to the book &lsquo;History of
Islamic People&rsquo; written by Karl Brockelmann. The other book referred by
author is &lsquo;The Arabs&rsquo; written by A. Nutting. Thus, it is not the opinion
of the author but it is opinion of Karl Brockelmann and A. Nutting. Ld.
Prosecutor Sh. Vipin Sanduja submitted that the last line of the book
which reads: &lsquo;The world would have been a better place if he had not
succeeded in spreading his religion&rsquo; is offending and attracts the
provision of Section 153A and 295A IPC. I have carefully considered this
submission of Ld APP Sh. Vipin Sanduja. The author has not stated in
these lines that India would have been a better place if he (Prophet)
had not succeeded in spreading his religion. In fact the author is
talking about the world. However, the author has drawn his conclusion by
referring ninety references from various books including &lsquo;The Quran&rsquo;.
The author has said in para 3 of page 15 of the book:</li>
</ol>
<p>&lsquo;It might be thought that I am quoting from books which are hostile to
Mohammed. It is not so. Only Muir&rsquo;s book is slightly hostile to him. All
other go out of their way to portray him in a favourable light.&rsquo; In my
view there is no merit in the submission of Ld. APP.</p>
<ol start="28">
<li>The above discussion shows that the alleged offending portions of
the book, when read as a whole, do not lead to the inference that it
promotes enmity or hatred between different classes. The nature of the
writing is not of a nature calculated to promote feeling of enmity or
hatred. The language of the book is mild, tempered and dignified. The
words used have no power to sling or stoke communal violence, hatred,
enmity, disharmony or illwill. The book is based on a number of
reference books of history and religion. The conclusions drawn are not
desultory. The book is meant for reading by philanthropists and elite
section of the society.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is hard to believe that the elite would rake up communal violence,
after going through this book. The elite have their own way of reacting
to socially sensitive issues. It is not a matter of past when the elite
of our country, by and large, defended M.F. Hussain, when the latter
painted nude painting of Indian Mythological deities. The only purpose
of the author is to discourage, in all humility, the growing
consciousness of religious identity which is leading to fundamentalist
and separatist attitudes in the world.</p>
<p>For the foregoing reasons, I hold that the charge against the accused
persons is groundless. I hereby discharge both the accused.</p>
