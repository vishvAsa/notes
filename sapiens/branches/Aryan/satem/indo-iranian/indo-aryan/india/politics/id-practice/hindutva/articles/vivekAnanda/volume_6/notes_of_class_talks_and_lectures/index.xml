      <title>424 RELIGION AND SCIENCE</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;religion-and-science&#34;&gt;RELIGION AND SCIENCE&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Experience is the only source of knowledge. In the world, religion is&#xA;the only science where there is no surety, because it is not taught as a&#xA;science of experience. This should not be. There is always, however, a&#xA;small group of men who teach religion from experience. They are called&#xA;mystics, and these mystics in every religion speak the same tongue and&#xA;teach the same truth. This is the real science of religion. As&#xA;mathematics in every part of the world does not differ, so the mystics&#xA;do not differ. They are all similarly constituted and similarly&#xA;situated. Their experience is the same; and this becomes law.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>425 RELIGION IS REALISATION</title>
      <link>https://vishvAsa.github.io/notes/sapiens/branches/Aryan/satem/indo-iranian/indo-aryan/india/politics/id-practice/hindutva/articles/vivekAnanda/volume_6/notes_of_class_talks_and_lectures/425_religion_is_realisation/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;religion-is-realisation&#34;&gt;RELIGION IS REALISATION&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The greatest name man ever gave to God is Truth. Truth is the fruit of&#xA;realisation; therefore seek it within the soul. Get away from all books&#xA;and forms and let your soul see its Self. &amp;ldquo;We are deluded and maddened&#xA;by books&amp;rdquo;, Shri Krishna declares. Be beyond the dualities of nature. The&#xA;moment you think creed and form and ceremony the &amp;ldquo;be-all&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;end-all&amp;rdquo;,&#xA;then you are in bondage. Take part in them to help others, but take care&#xA;they do not become a bondage. Religion is one, but its application must&#xA;be various. Let each one, therefore, give his message; but find not the&#xA;defects in other religions. You must come out from all form if you would&#xA;see the Light. Drink deep of the nectar of the knowledge of God. The man&#xA;who realises. &amp;ldquo;I am He&amp;rdquo;, though clad in rags, is happy. Go forth into&#xA;the Eternal and come back with eternal energy. The slave goes out to&#xA;search for truth; he comes back free.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>426 RELIGION IS SELF-ABNEGATION</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;religion-is-self-abnegation&#34;&gt;RELIGION IS SELF-ABNEGATION&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One cannot divide the rights of the universe. To talk of &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; implies&#xA;limitation. It is not &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; but &amp;ldquo;responsibility&amp;rdquo;. Each is responsible&#xA;for the evil anywhere in the world. No one can separate himself from his&#xA;brother. All that unites with the universal is virtue; all that&#xA;separates is sin. You are a part of the Infinite. This is your nature.&#xA;Hence you are your brother&amp;rsquo;s keeper.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>427 UNSELFISH WORK IS TRUE RENUNCIATION</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;unselfish-work-is-true-renunciation&#34;&gt;UNSELFISH WORK IS TRUE RENUNCIATION&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This world is not for cowards. Do not try to fly. Look not for success&#xA;or failure. Join yourself to the perfectly unselfish will and work on.&#xA;Know that the mind which is born to succeed joins itself to a determined&#xA;will and perseveres. You have the right to work, but do not become so&#xA;degenerate as to look for results. Work incessantly, but see something&#xA;behind the work. Even good deeds can find a man in great bondage.&#xA;Therefore be not bound by good deeds or by desire for name and fame.&#xA;Those who know this secret pass beyond this round of birth and death and&#xA;become immortal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>428 FREEDOM OF THE SELF</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;freedom-of-the-self&#34;&gt;FREEDOM OF THE SELF&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As we cannot know except through effects that we have eyes, so we cannot&#xA;see the Self except by Its effects. It cannot be brought down to the low&#xA;plane of sense-perception. It is the condition of everything in the&#xA;universe, though Itself unconditioned. When we know that we are the&#xA;Self, then we are free. The Self can never change. It cannot be acted on&#xA;by a cause, because It is Itself the cause. It is self-caused. If we can&#xA;find in ourself something that is not acted on by any cause, then we&#xA;have known the Self.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>429 NOTES ON VEDANTA</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes-on-vedanta&#34;&gt;NOTES ON VEDANTA&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The cardinal features of the Hindu religion are founded on the&#xA;meditative and speculative philosophy and on the ethical teachings&#xA;contained in the various books of the Vedas, which assert that the&#xA;universe is infinite in space and eternal in duration. It never had a&#xA;beginning and it never will have an end. Innumerable have been the&#xA;manifestations of the power of the Spirit in the realm of matter, of the&#xA;force or the Infinite in the domain of the finite, but the Infinite&#xA;Itself is self-existent, eternal, and unchangeable. The passage of time&#xA;makes no mark whatever on the dial of eternity. In its super Sensuous&#xA;region, which cannot be comprehended at all by the human understanding,&#xA;there is no past and there is no future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>430 HINDU AND GREEK</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;hindu-and-greek&#34;&gt;HINDU AND GREEK&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Three mountains stand as typical of progress — the Himalayas of&#xA;Indo-Aryan, Sinai of Hebrew, and Olympus of Greek civilisation. When the&#xA;Aryans reached India, they found the climate so hot that they would not&#xA;work incessantly, so they began to think; thus they became introspective&#xA;and developed religion. They discovered that there was no limit to the&#xA;power of mind; they therefore sought to master that; and through it they&#xA;learnt that there was something infinite coiled up in the frame we call&#xA;man, which was seeking to become kinetic. To evolve this became their&#xA;chief aim. Another branch of the Aryans went into the smaller and more&#xA;picturesque country of Greece, where the climate and natural conditions&#xA;were more favourable; so their activity turned outwards, and they&#xA;developed the external arts and outward liberty. The Greek sought&#xA;political liberty. The Hindu has always sought spiritual liberty. Both&#xA;are one-sided. The Indian cares not enough for national protection or&#xA;patriotism, he will defend only his religion; while with the Greek and&#xA;in Europe (where the Greek civilisation finds its continuation) the&#xA;country comes first. To care only for spiritual liberty and not for&#xA;social liberty is a defect, but the opposite is a still greater defect.&#xA;Liberty of both soul and body is to be striven for.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>432 ON RAJA-YOGA</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-raja-yoga&#34;&gt;ON RAJA-YOGA&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first stage of Yoga is Yama.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To master Yama five things are necessary:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(1) Non-injuring any being by thought, word, and deed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(2) Speaking the truth in thought, word, and deed&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(3) Non-covetousness in thought, word, and deed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(4) Perfect chastity in thought, word, and deed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(5) Perfect sinlessness in thought, word, and deed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Holiness is the greatest power. Everything else quails before it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then come Âsana, or posture, of a devotee. The seat must be firm, the&#xA;head, ribs, and body in a straight line, erect. Say to yourself that you&#xA;are firmly seated, and that nothing can move you. Then mention the&#xA;perfection of the body, bit by bit, from head to foot. Think of it as&#xA;being dear as crystal, and as a perfect vessel to sail over the sea of&#xA;life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>433 ON BHAKTI-YOGA</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-bhakti-yoga&#34;&gt;ON BHAKTI-YOGA&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bhakti-Yoga is the path of systematised devotion for the attainment of&#xA;union with the Absolute. It is the easiest and surest path to religion&#xA;or realisation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Love to God is the one essential to be perfect in this path.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are five stages of love.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, man wants help and has a little fear.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second, when God is seen as Father.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Third, when God is seen as Mother. Then all women are looked upon as&#xA;reflections of the Mother-God. With the idea of Mother-God real love&#xA;begins.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>434 ON JNANA-YOGA</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-jnana-yoga&#34;&gt;ON JNANA-YOGA&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, meditation should be of a negative nature. Think away everything.&#xA;Analyse everything that comes in the mind by the sheer action of the&#xA;will.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Next, assert what we really are — existence, knowledge and bliss —&#xA;being, knowing, and loving.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Meditation is the means of unification of the subject and object.&#xA;Meditate:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Above, it is full of me; below, it is full of me; in the middle, it is&#xA;full of me. I am in all beings, and all beings are in me. Om Tat Sat, I&#xA;am It. I am existence above mind. I am the one Spirit of the universe. I&#xA;am neither pleasure nor pain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>435 THE REALITY AND SHADOW</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-reality-and-shadow&#34;&gt;THE REALITY AND SHADOW&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That which differentiates one thing from another is time, space, and&#xA;causation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The differentiation is in the form, not in the substance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You may destroy the form and it disappears for ever; but the substance&#xA;remains the same. You can never destroy the substance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Evolution is in nature, not in the soul — evolution of nature,&#xA;manifestation of the soul.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maya is not illusion as it is popularly interpreted. Maya is real, yet&#xA;it is not real. It is real in that the Real is behind it and gives it&#xA;its appearance of reality. That which is real in Maya is the Reality in&#xA;and through Maya. Yet the Reality is never seen; and hence that which is&#xA;seen is unreal, and it has no real independent existence of itself, but&#xA;is dependent upon the Real for its existence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-become-free&#34;&gt;HOW TO BECOME FREE&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All things in nature work according to law. Nothing is excepted. The&#xA;mind as well as everything in external nature is governed and controlled&#xA;by law.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Internal and external nature, mind and matter, are in time and space,&#xA;and are bound by the law of causation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The freedom of the mind is a delusion. How can the mind be free when it&#xA;is controlled and bound by law?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;soul-and-god&#34;&gt;SOUL AND GOD&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anything that is in space has form. Space itself has form. Either you&#xA;are in space, or space is in you. The soul is beyond all space. Space is&#xA;in the soul, not the soul in space.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Form is confined to time and space and is bound by the law of causation.&#xA;All time is in us, we are not in time. As the soul is not in time and&#xA;space, all time and space are within the soul. The soul is therefore&#xA;omnipresent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-goal&#34;&gt;THE GOAL&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dualism recognises God and nature to be eternally separate: the universe&#xA;and nature eternally dependent upon God.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The extreme monists make no such distinction. In the last analysis, they&#xA;claim, all is God: the universe becomes lost in God; God is the eternal&#xA;life of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With them infinite and finite are mere terms. The universe, nature, etc.&#xA;exist by virtue of differentiation. Nature is itself differentiation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-proof-of-religion&#34;&gt;ON PROOF OF RELIGION&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The great question about religion is: What makes it so unscientific? If&#xA;religion is a science, why is it not as certain as other sciences? All&#xA;beliefs in God, heaven, etc., are mere conjectures, mere beliefs. There&#xA;seems to be nothing certain about it. Our ideas concerning religion are&#xA;changing all the time. The mind is in a constant state of flux.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is man a soul, an unchanging substance, or is he a constantly changing&#xA;quantity? All religions, except primitive Buddhism, believe that man is&#xA;a soul, an identity, a unit that never dies but is immortal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>440 THE DESIGN THEORY</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-design-theory&#34;&gt;THE DESIGN THEORY&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The idea that nature in all her orderly arrangements shows design on the&#xA;part of the Creator of the universe is good as a kindergarten teaching&#xA;to show the beauty, power, and glory of God, in order to lead children&#xA;in religion up to a philosophical conception of God; but apart from&#xA;that, it is not good, and perfectly illogical. As a philosophical idea,&#xA;it is entirely without foundation, if God is taken to be omnipotent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;spirit-and-nature&#34;&gt;SPIRIT AND NATURE&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Religion is the realisation of Spirit as Spirit; not Spirit as matter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Religion is a growth. Each one must experience it himself. The&#xA;Christians believe that Jesus Christ died to save man. With you it is&#xA;belief in a doctrine, and this belief constitutes your salvation. With&#xA;us doctrine has nothing whatever to do with salvation. Each one may&#xA;believe in whatever doctrine he likes; or in no doctrine. What&#xA;difference does it make to you whether Jesus Christ lived at a certain&#xA;time or not? What has it to do with you that Moses saw God in the&#xA;burning bush? The fact that Moses saw God in the burning bush does not&#xA;constitute your seeing Him, does it? If it does, then the fact that&#xA;Moses ate is enough for you; you ought to stop eating. One is just as&#xA;sensible as the other. Records of great spiritual men of the past do us&#xA;no good whatever except that they urge us onward to do the same, to&#xA;experience religion ourselves. Whatever Christ or Moses or anybody else&#xA;did does not help us in the least, except to urge us on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-practice-of-religion&#34;&gt;THE PRACTICE OF RELIGION&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;At Alameda, Calif., March 18, 1900&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We read many books, but that does not bring us knowledge. We may read&#xA;all the Bibles in the world, but that will not give us religion.&#xA;Theoretical religion is easy enough to get, any one may get that. What&#xA;we want is practical religion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Christian idea of a practical religion is in doing good works —&#xA;worldly utility.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;concentration&#34;&gt;CONCENTRATION&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Concentration is the essence of all knowledge, nothing can be done&#xA;without it. Ninety per cent of thought force is wasted by the ordinary&#xA;human being, and therefore he is constantly committing blunders; the&#xA;trained man or mind never makes a mistake. When the mind is concentrated&#xA;and turned backward on itself, all within us will be our servants, not&#xA;our masters. The Greeks applied their concentration to the external&#xA;world, and the result was perfection in art, literature, etc. The Hindu&#xA;concentrated on the internal world, upon the unseen realms in the Self,&#xA;and developed the science of Yoga. Yoga is controlling the senses, will&#xA;and mind. The benefit of its study is that we learn to control instead&#xA;of being controlled. Mind seems to be layer on layer. Our real goal is&#xA;to cross all these intervening strata of our being and find God. The end&#xA;and aim of Yoga is to realise God. To do this we must go beyond relative&#xA;knowledge, go beyond the sense-world. The world is awake to the senses,&#xA;the children of the Lord are asleep on that plane. The world is asleep&#xA;to the Eternal, the children of the Lord are awake in that realm. These&#xA;are the sons of God. There is but one way to control the senses — to see&#xA;Him who is the Reality in the universe. Then and only then can we really&#xA;conquer our senses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-power-of-the-mind&#34;&gt;THE POWER OF THE MIND&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The cause becomes the effect. The cause is not one thing and the effect&#xA;something else that exists as a result. The effect is always the cause&#xA;worked out. Always, the cause becomes the effect. The popular idea is&#xA;that the effect is the result of the operation of a cause which is&#xA;something independent and aloof from the effect. al his is not so. The&#xA;effect is always the cause worked out into another condition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;lessons-on-raja-yoga&#34;&gt;LESSONS ON RAJA-YOGA&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(These lessons and those on Bhakti-Yoga that follow are made out of&#xA;class notes preserved in England — Ed.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;PRANA&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The theory of creation is that matter is subject to five conditions:&#xA;ether, luminous ether, gaseous, liquid, and solid. They are all evoked&#xA;out of one primal element, which is very finest ether.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The name of the energy in the universe is Prāna, which is the force&#xA;residing in these elements. Mind is the great instrument for using the&#xA;Prana. Mind is material. Behind the mind is Âtman which takes hold of&#xA;the Prana. Prana is the driving power of the world, and can be seen in&#xA;every manifestation of life. The body is mortal and the mind is mortal;&#xA;both, being compounds, must die. Behind all is the Atman which never&#xA;dies. The Atman is pure intelligence controlling and directing Prana.&#xA;But the intelligence we see around us is always imperfect. When&#xA;intelligence is perfect, we get the Incarnation — the Christ.&#xA;Intelligence is always trying to manifest itself, and in order to do&#xA;this it is creating minds and bodies of different degrees of&#xA;development. In reality, and at the back of all things, every being is&#xA;equal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;lessons-on-bhakti-yoga&#34;&gt;LESSONS ON BHAKTI-YOGA&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;THE YOGA THROUGH DEVOTION&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We have been considering Raja-Yoga and the physical exercises. Now we&#xA;shall consider Yoga through devotion. But you must remember that no one&#xA;system is &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; (for all). I want to set before you many systems,&#xA;many ideals, in order that you may find one that will suit you; if one&#xA;does not, perhaps another may.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We want to become harmonious beings, with the psychical, spiritual,&#xA;intellectual, and working (active) sides of our nature equally&#xA;developed. Nations and individuals typify one of these sides or types&#xA;and cannot understand more than that one. They get so built up into one&#xA;ideal that they cannot see any other. The ideal is really that we should&#xA;become many-sided. Indeed the cause of the misery of the world is that&#xA;we are so one-sided that we cannot sympathise with one another. Consider&#xA;a man looking at the sun from beneath the earth, up the shaft of a mine;&#xA;he sees one aspect of the sun. Then another man sees the sun from the&#xA;earth&amp;rsquo;s level, another through mist and fog, another from the mountain&#xA;top. To each the sun is a different appearance. So there are many&#xA;appearances, but in reality there is only one sun. There is diversity of&#xA;vision, but one object; and that is the sun.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;mother-worship&#34;&gt;MOTHER-WORSHIP&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Based on fragmentary notes of a class talk by Swami Vivekananda in New&#xA;York.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The two conjoint facts of perception we can never get rid of are&#xA;happiness and unhappiness — things which bring us pain also bring&#xA;pleasure. Our world is made up of these two. We cannot get rid of them;&#xA;with every pulsation of life they are present. The world is busy trying&#xA;to reconcile these opposites, sages trying to find solution of this&#xA;commingling of the opposites. The burning heat of pain is intermitted by&#xA;flashes of rest, the gleam of light breaking the darkness in&#xA;intermittent flashes only to make the gloom deeper.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
