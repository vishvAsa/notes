      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: G. Allana, Pakistan Movement Historical Documents (Karachi:&#xA;Department of International Relations, University of Karachi, nd&#xA;[1969]), pp. 61-75. Some very long paragraphs have been broken into&#xA;shorter ones, and the punctuation adjusted in some places for ease of&#xA;reading. Section numbers have been added by FWP for convenience in&#xA;reference. All notes in square brackets are by FWP. Maulana Muhammad Ali&#xA;(1878-1931) made this speech only six weeks before his death; he died in&#xA;London, and was buried in Jerusalem as he had wished.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Typos have been corrected, and the paragraphs&#xA;have been numbered, but no other editing has been done.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Full text of the pamphlet &amp;ldquo;Now or Never,&amp;rdquo; published by Choudhary Rahmat&#xA;Ali as &amp;ldquo;Founder of Pakistan National Movement,&amp;rdquo; in which the word&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Pakistan&amp;rdquo; appears to have been used for the first time in a document&#xA;(1933)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: Great Women of Modern India vol. 3: Sarojini Naidu, ed. by&#xA;Verinder Grover and Ranjana Arora (New Delhi: Deep &amp;amp; Deep Publications,&#xA;1993), pp. 51-56. The editors don&amp;rsquo;t provide a date for this talk, but&#xA;probably it was given in December 1917. The whole speech is presented in&#xA;printed form as one gigantic paragraph; all paragraph breaks have been&#xA;imposed by FWP. Typos and other small errors have also been corrected,&#xA;and punctuation slightly adjusted in some places. All editorial&#xA;annotations in square brackets are by FWP.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: Shaista Suhrawardy Ikramullah, &lt;strong&gt;From Purdah to Parliament&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;(Karachi: Oxford University Press, 1998 [1963]), pp. 1-11, 18-28.&#xA;Reproduced here through the generous permission of *&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oup.com.pk/index.asp&#34;&gt;Oxford University&#xA;Press, Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;*. Scanned and&#xA;slightly edited (mostly some adjustment of punctuation) for classroom&#xA;use by FWP. All editorial comments in square brackets are by FWP.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From Purdah to Parliament (1963)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;by Shaista Suhrawardy Ikramullah&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Chapter One: An Old-Fashioned House (1915)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[[1]]&lt;/strong&gt; I was born in Calcutta in my maternal grandfather&amp;rsquo;s house.&#xA;It was a very old-fashioned house, built in the style of Muslim houses&#xA;of the nineteenth century. It was sold when I was only eight years old&#xA;and my mother, Shaherbano, had not lived in it continuously after I was&#xA;two, but she visited it a good deal, and so I can remember it very&#xA;clearly and can describe it almost room by room. It stood in a narrow&#xA;lane off the main road. (It was considered in very bad taste to have a&#xA;house from which the main thoroughfares of the city could be seen.)&#xA;There was a small unpretentious gate which opened into a long gallery.&#xA;At the end of the gallery at the left was a door. This opened into yet&#xA;another uncovered gallery, which turned into a courtyard. All around the&#xA;courtyard were the various living-rooms. These rooms were grouped&#xA;together with a deep verandah running the entire length of them, and&#xA;each group formed a separate unit. In a large house there would be a&#xA;dozen or so such self-contained units, but as my grandfather&amp;rsquo;s house was&#xA;not very big, there were only four or five of them. To the right of the&#xA;courtyard was the largest. It had a very large, deep verandah, which&#xA;consisted of small living-rooms. These verandahs were the equivalent of&#xA;drawing-rooms in a Western house. The rooms were quite small and were&#xA;used more or less as dressing-rooms or for storage purposes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

NOTE: In&#xA;virtually every place where the &lt;em&gt;Pioneer&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s translation says &amp;ldquo;nation,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;the Urdu word is actually &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;qaum&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;community.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

On the one hand, we have the view that &amp;lsquo;India&amp;rsquo; as we know it was&#xA;invented in the not-too-distant past, probably by the British, or&#xA;perhaps by Indians and Britons acting together in the period of colonial&#xA;rule. This is what we may call the constructivist approach, one that&#xA;from its academic origins has percolated to other parts of elite Indian&#xA;society which have willy-nilly absorbed the best and the worst of&#xA;post-modernist gobbledygook by now. There is of course some truth to the&#xA;notion that the idea of India altered significantly in the 19th and 20th&#xA;centuries, but one may legitimately doubt whether the whole thing was&#xA;made up in recent times as a sheer act of will.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Asani&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Khwaja Muinuddin Chishti, who lies buried in Ajmer, was one of the most&#xA;revered sufis of India. Ali S. Asani&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;writes about him and his admirers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Who was Khwaja Muinuddin Chishti and why has his dargah attained such&#xA;pre-eminence? Although Muinuddin Chishti looms large in the history of&#xA;Islam and Sufism in South Asia, we have, unfortunately, very little&#xA;accurate information about him, because of an absence of reliable&#xA;contemporary sources. Most of what we know is based on legend and&#xA;hagiography that developed around his figure several centuries after his&#xA;death. As a result, we know considerably more about the personality of&#xA;Muinuddin as it was constructed over time through the veneration of&#xA;successive generations of devotees than the actual Muinuddin of history.&#xA;As we gingerly sift through legendary accounts to separate historical&#xA;fact from pious fiction, certain basic information about him emerges.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
