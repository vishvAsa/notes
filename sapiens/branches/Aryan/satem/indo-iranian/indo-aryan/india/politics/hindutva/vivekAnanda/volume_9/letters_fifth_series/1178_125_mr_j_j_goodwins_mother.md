ALMORA

*June 1898*

With infinite sorrow I learn the sad news of Mr. Goodwin's departure
from this life, the more so as it was terribly sudden and therefore
prevented all possibilities of my being at his side at the time of
death. The debt of gratitude I owe him can never be repaid, and those
who think they have been helped by any thought of mine ought to know
that almost every word of it was published through the untiring and most
unselfish exertions of Mr. Goodwin. In him I have lost a friend true as
steel, a disciple of never — failing devotion, a worker who knew not
what tiring was, and the world is less rich by one of those few who are
born, as it were, to live only for others.
