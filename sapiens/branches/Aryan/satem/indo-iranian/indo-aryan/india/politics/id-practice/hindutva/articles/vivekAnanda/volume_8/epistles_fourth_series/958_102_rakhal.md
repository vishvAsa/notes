## CII

(*Translated from [Bengali](b7366e8102.pdf)* )

*To Swami Brahmananda*

AMRITSAR,  
*2nd September, 1897*.

MY DEAR RAKHAL,

Yogen tells me in a letter to buy the house at Baghbazar for Rs. 20,000.
Even if we buy that house, there are still a lot of difficulties; for
example, we shall have to break it down in part and make the drawing
room into a big hall, and similar alterations and repairs. Moreover the
house is very old and ramshackle. However, consult Girish Babu and Atul
and do what you decide to be best. Today I am leaving by the two o'clock
train with all my party for Kashmir. The recent stay at Dharamsala Hills
has improved my health much, and the tonsillitis, fever, etc. have
completely disappeared.

From a letter of yours I got all the news. Niranjan, Latu, Krishnalal,
Dinanath, Gupta, and Achyut are all going to Kashmir with me.

The gentleman from Madras who donated Rs. 1,500 for famine relief wants
an account of how exactly the money was expended. Send him such an
account. We are doing more or less well.

Yours affectionately,  
VIVEKANANDA.

PS. Give my love to all at the Math.
