## XLII

*To the Hale Sisters*

NEW YORK,  
*5th May, 1895*.

DEAR BABIES,

What I expected has come. I always thought that although Prof. Max
Muller in all his writings on the Hindu religion adds in the last a
derogatory remark, he must see the whole truth in the long run. As soon
as you can, get a copy of his last book *Vedantism*; there you will find
him swallowing the whole of it — *reincarnation* and all.

Of course, you will not find it difficult at all to understand, as it is
only a part of what I have been telling you all this time.

Many points you will find smack of my paper in Chicago.

I am glad now the old man has seen the truth, because that is the only
way to have religion in the face of modern research and science.

Hope you are enjoying Todd's *Rajasthan*. 

With all love, your brother,

VIVEKANANDA.
