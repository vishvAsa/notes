      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;court-role&#34;&gt;Court role&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is a matter of fact that BJP/RSS/VHP was not a party in the case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sri Ram Lala Virajman, Hindu Mahasabha, RJB Punaruddhar Samiti (of Shankaracharya), Nirmohi Akhara, and two Mahants of Ayodhya Suresh Das and Dharam Das - these were the Hindu parties that argued in Allahabad HC.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this thread I had documented the full list of lawyers and Hindu parties they represented - who had actually argued the case for the temple.  (Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/bharatenduh/status/1741053505174139143?s=46&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;) The list is in order of the coverage sequence, as acknowledged by the Court itself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was in 10th grade when the first Kar Seva happened. Our place is close to Ayodhya on the other side of Sarayu. About a couple dozen Kar Sevaks who had come from different places - Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana, some from Western UP - lived for days at my parents home. Like many Hindu families who were hosting unknown Kar Sevaks who were stranded because Mulayam govt had shut down everything.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: ST&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Kartika month when millions of devotees undertake the 5-koshi and 14-koshi parikrama every year in Ayodhya - just imagine they went from shrine to shrine as per the sequence of that Parikrama, and then stopped inside Ramkot campus, and then stood in front of that ugly building called Babri, an essential part of those Parikramas, and then prostrated before Bhagawan from there at a distance, only looking at the small pictures of Ram Lala that used to be sold there in the shops.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: ST&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Svami Nishchalananda Sarasvati is consistent in his stand. His stand was and remains - “No mosque. Only temple.” This he had said even immediately after the Supreme Court judgement. Mosque not just not next to the temple, not even 5 KM or 25 KM or any KMs away.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;His Reasoning:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;why should Hindus, who are owners of this property, give to the squatter any compensation? This case is about eviction of the squatter to reclaim what belongs to Hindus, not a give-and-take bargain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
