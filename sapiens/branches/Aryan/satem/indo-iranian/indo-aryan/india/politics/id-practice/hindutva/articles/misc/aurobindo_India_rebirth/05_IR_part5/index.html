<p>1938-1940</p>
<p>(In the night of November 23-24, 1938, Sri Aurobindo fell down while
walking in concentration and broke his right leg. In the years that
followed, a small group of disciples, mostly attendants and physicians,
met him every day. Two of them recorded the informal talks that ensued,
which often touched on the Indian political scene, the rising threat of
Nazism, and then World War II which Sri Aurobindo followed closely.</p>
<p>A few excerpts from these talks are presented here.)</p>
<p>December 23, 1938</p>
<pre><code>    Every time the Light has tried to descend it has met with
</code></pre>
<p>resistance and opposition. Christ was crucified&hellip;. Buddha was denied;
sons of Light come, the earth denies them, rejects them, and afterwards
accepts them in name to reject them in substance.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>December 25, 1938</p>
<pre><code>    I have no faith in government controls, because I believe in a
</code></pre>
<p>certain amount of freedom—freedom to find out things for oneself in
one&rsquo;s own way, even freedom to commit blunders. Nature leads us through
various errors and mistakes; when Nature created the human being with
all his possibilities for good and ill she knew very well what she was
about. Freedom for experiment in human life is a great thing. Without
the freedom to take risks and commit mistakes there can be no
progress&hellip;.</p>
<pre><code>    \[But\] everything is moving towards mechanization in Europe.
</code></pre>
<p>The totalitarian States do not believe in any individual variation and
even non-totalitarian States are obliged to follow them; they do it for
the sake of efficiency—but whose efficiency? It is the efficiency of the
State as an organized machine, not that of the individual. The
individual has no freedom, he doesn&rsquo;t grow. Organize by all means, but
there must be scope for freedom and plasticity.</p>
<pre><code>    ...

    Do you think that the average man of today is better than a
</code></pre>
<p>Greek of 2500 hundred years ago, or than an Indian of those times? Look

<pre><code>    The old Indian system grew out of life, it had room for

<p>everything and every interest. There were monarchy, aristocracy,
democracy; every interest was represented in the government. While in
Europe the Western system grew out of the mind: they are led by reason
and want to make everything cut and dried without any chance of freedom
or variation. If it is democracy, then democracy only—no room for
anything else. They cannot be plastic.</p>

<p>Rashtrapati at the top with considerable powers so as to secure a
continuity of policy, and an assembly representative of the nation. The
provinces will combine into a federation united at the top, leaving
ample scope to local bodies to make laws according to their local
problems.</p>
<pre><code>    ...

    The Congress at the present stage—what is it but a Fascist

<p>organization? Gandhi is the dictator like Stalin, I won&rsquo;t say like
Hitler: what Gandhi says they accept and even the Working Committee
follows him; then it goes to the All-India Congress Committee which
adopts it, and then the Congress. There is no opportunity for any
difference of opinion, except for Socialists who are allowed to differ
provided they don&rsquo;t seriously differ. Whatever resolutions they pass are
obligatory on all the provinces whether the resolutions suit the
provinces or not; there is no room for any other independent opinion.
Everything is fixed up before and the people are only allowed to talk
over it—like Stalin&rsquo;s Parliament. When we started the [Nationalist]
movement we began with the idea of throwing out the Congress oligarchy
and open the whole organization to the general mass.</p>

in with his magical formula “Spin, spin, spin.” C. R. Das and a few
others could act as a counterbalance. It is all a fetish.</p>

with non-violent arms. I would like you to lay down the arms you have as
being useless for saving you or humanity&hellip;. Invite Herr Hitler and
Signor Mussolini to take what they want of the countries you call your
possessions. Let them take possession of your beautiful island with your
many beautiful buildings. You will give all these but not your souls nor
your minds&hellip;.” (<em>Amrita Bazar Patrika</em>, July 4, 1940, “Method of
