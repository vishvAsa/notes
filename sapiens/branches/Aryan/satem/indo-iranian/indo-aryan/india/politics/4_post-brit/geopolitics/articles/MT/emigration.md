From personal inquiries, I have learnt that people leave India to work& live abroad for various reasons.  Some of the major ones are salary, ease of living, lower ambient disease load, clean air/water/drainage, access to the outdoors, and opportunities for descendants. Even if there is growing animus towards H, they are unlikely to easily drop these and return to the desh. If the government wants to bring back its foreign-based talent, it needs to think about these factors. Unless it expects to flee back as refugees when things get too hot, like it happened before in Fiji or Uganda.
