## XVIII

*To Mrs. John J. Bagley*

HOTEL BELLEVUE  
EUROPEAN PLAN  
BOSTON

*May 8, 1894*

DEAR MOTHER,

I have arrived in Boston again. Last afternoon \[I\] spoke at Mrs. Julia
Ward Howe's club — of course for nothing, but it gives me a prestige. I
saw there Mrs. \[Ednah Dean\] Cheney. Would you not write a letter to
her for me? Although I told her I had a card from you, I think a letter
is better.

Yours truly,  
VIVEKANANDA
