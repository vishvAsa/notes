      <description>&lt;p&gt;Addressee &lt;a href=&#34;ii_your_highness.htm&#34;&gt;»&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;i&#34;&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;MADRAS&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;the 15th February&lt;/em&gt; [1893]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;YOUR HIGHNESS,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two things I am telling your Highness. One — a very wonderful phenomenon&#xA;I have seen in a village called Kumbakonam, and another about myself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the said village lives a man of the Chetty caste, generally passing&#xA;for an astrologer. I, with two other young men, went to see him. He was&#xA;said to tell about anything a man thinks of. So, I wanted to put him to&#xA;the test. Two months ago, I dreamt that my mother was dead and I was&#xA;very anxious to know about her. My second was whether what my Guru had&#xA;told me was right. The third was a test-question — a part of the&#xA;Buddhistic mantra, in Tibetan tongue. These questions I determined upon,&#xA;two days before going to this Govinda Chetty. Another young man had one&#xA;of his sisters-in-law given poison to, by some unknown hand, from which&#xA;she recovered. But he wanted to know the author of that delivery.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Haridas Bhai was as usual very kind to me and we&#xA;had many and many a talk about your Highness, so much so that he was&#xA;really very anxious to see you and intends paying his respects to your&#xA;Highness in his coming winter tour to the north. And I dare say your&#xA;Highness would also be very much pleased to see this old man of great&#xA;experience who was for twenty-five years the mentor of Kathiawad. Withal&#xA;he is the only remnant of the old school of very conservative&#xA;politicians. He is a man who is thoroughly able to organize and put to&#xA;perfect order an existing machinery; but he would be the last man to&#xA;move a step further.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Early this evening he addressed the inmates of the institution in&#xA;the chapel upon the manners, customs and mode of living in his country.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

A most picturesque figure at&#xA;these meetings has been the Hindu priest, (Swami Vive Kananda,) who has&#xA;spoken at several of them upon the deplorable condition of the poor of&#xA;India and some of the causes which bring it about. In his preaching he&#xA;has traversed almost every square mile of the great empire, and in his&#xA;capacity of monk he has entered the homes and studies the lives of the&#xA;poor people of his race and is not given to even every native.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It was a processional that had a world&#xA;of meaning in it; one that would have been impossible not many years&#xA;ago. Jew marched with Gentile and Catholic marched with Protestant. The&#xA;religious beliefs of India, of China and Japan were represented, as well&#xA;as those of the English-speaking nations. All, attired in their priestly&#xA;robes and wearing the insignia of their office, marched in peace and&#xA;fellowship to the platform, while the audience rose and cheered to the&#xA;sight. First came cardinal Gibbons, escorted by President Bonney. Then&#xA;came Mrs. Potter Palmer and Mrs. Charles Henrotin, representing the&#xA;board of lady managers, and then the following with their suites:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But it was woe to the man&#xA;who undertook to combat the monk on his own ground, and that was where&#xA;they all tried it who tried it at all. His replies came like flashes of&#xA;lightning, and the venturesome questioner was sure to be impaled on the&#xA;Indian’s shining intellectual lance. The workings of his mind, so subtle&#xA;and so brilliant, so well stored and so well trained, sometimes dazzled&#xA;his hearers, but it was always a most interesting study. He said nothing&#xA;unkind, for his nature would not permit that. Those who came to know him&#xA;best found him the most gentle and loveable of men, so honest, frank,&#xA;and unpretending, always grateful for the many kindnesses that were&#xA;shown him. Vivekananda and his cause found a place in the hearts of all&#xA;true Christians.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;indian-nation-april-9-1894&#34;&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Indian Nation&lt;/em&gt; April 9, 1894)&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He (the Swami) is beating his head against the rocks when he tries to&#xA;prove that a religion which lays claim to organic unity and to&#xA;spirituality may embrace theism and atheism, vedantism and low ideas of&#xA;idolatry. ‘Religion,’ of course, may be so defined as to be applicable&#xA;to atheism, agnosticism, &amp;amp;c. Carlyle gave such a definition. But no one&#xA;religion can claim at once to affirm and to deny God, to ignore Him and&#xA;worship Him, to believe in Him as a subtle essence inconceivably fine,&#xA;and to have &amp;rsquo;low ideas of idolatry.&amp;rsquo; It is useless speaking of the&#xA;conflicting doctrines as different paths leading to a common goal. We&#xA;should very much like to know what this common centre is, for we must&#xA;confess we can conceive of none which can be reached by theism and&#xA;atheism alike. We are past that stage when a mere phrase would charm us&#xA;into slavery, and until more light dawns upon us we must hold ‘common&#xA;centre’ and ‘convergence of diverging radii’ to be mere phrases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The “V” Club is a young organization, and its&#xA;membership is “shrouded in mystery,” but that it is composed of merry&#xA;and hospitable men and women was fully evidenced by the very pleasant&#xA;gathering last evening.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He mentioned among other&#xA;salient points regarding Hindooism, or Brahminism, that their religion&#xA;bore no distinctive name; that it was considered that a belief in the&#xA;truth of all creeds was religion, and that the belief that one certain&#xA;dogma was the real and only religion was sect. The Karmic law of cause&#xA;and effect was explained, also the external and internal natures in&#xA;their close relations to each other. The actions in this world, as&#xA;governed by a previous life and the change to still another life, were&#xA;dwelt upon in detail..&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He has now returned&#xA;to india, after an eventful journey. From what he has seen of Tibet and&#xA;of Tibetan monasteries, he has reason to believe that the discovery of&#xA;the Tibetan record of Christ’s life by the Russian traveler Notovitch,&#xA;regarded by many critics as a fake, is not without truth. He has seen&#xA;pictures of Christ in the monasteries, and says that Christ is regarded&#xA;by the Lamas as an Indian god.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;an-oriental-god-in-new-york&#34;&gt;AN ORIENTAL GOD IN NEW YORK&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;davenport-daily-republican-january-30-1896&#34;&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Davenport Daily Republican&lt;/em&gt; January 30, 1896)&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In an “off” evening &amp;ndash; mentally off &amp;ndash; we were lured to the feet of the&#xA;Hindu monk, Swami Vivekananda, who is the present fad in New York. He&#xA;overflows a vast hall Sunday afternoons, and all day and evening he sits&#xA;in an uptown drawing room with his worshippers at his feet, and&#xA;discourses on the special unknowableness of Buddhism, the Yoga, the&#xA;Kosmos, and kindred light themes. It long ago passed into an axiom that&#xA;there is no disputing about tastes. It is one of the few that can be&#xA;uttered in every known tongue, so universal is its truth accepted. So&#xA;when I heard a lady, whose name is familiar from the Atlantic to the&#xA;Pacific, and beyond, say that she had never seen another who filled her&#xA;ideal of God as Swami did. It was not my turn to speak, and I bravely&#xA;kept still. It is the mystery of the Himalayas that he brings that&#xA;fasinates and neither him nor his thought. His diction is simple and&#xA;clear, with scarcely any accent, and his range surprisingly wide but the&#xA;trend of his thought is toward the fatalism of the orient which would be&#xA;pessimism to the Anglo-Saxon, who will never bow his head in the blind&#xA;obedience of philosophy. But in picturesqueness the occasion was&#xA;surpassing. Sitting on a low seat in oriental fashion in the center of&#xA;the room, his dark, richly, colored face, absolutely modile (?), save&#xA;for the flashing light of the great brown eyes, his head surmounted by a&#xA;lemon-colored silk scarf turban, his well formed, rather stout body&#xA;enveloped in a deep orange-hued, silken robe held around the waist by a&#xA;scarlet sash &amp;ndash; such was the god of the far east who enchained th&#xA;einterest of all, and loosened the tongues of women in rapturous praise.&#xA;But he seemed a well-fed, well-groomed god, and one who may not be&#xA;entirely free from human leanings. He talks in a monotone, which, when&#xA;he breaks out in his own tongue, as he frequently does, descends into a&#xA;chanting rhythm of tone that is rich and musical. Crowds throng about&#xA;him day and evening, two-thirds women, and for the moment Swami&#xA;Vivikananda reigns. But I am sure he does not look like &amp;ndash; not even like&#xA;an oriental god.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;indian-mirror-january-21-1897&#34;&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Indian Mirror&lt;/em&gt; January 21, 1897)&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Swami Vivekananda was accorded a most enthusiastic reception at Colombo,&#xA;where he landed on the 15th instant. All classes of the Colombo&#xA;community, whether Hindus or Buddhists, forgot their differences, and&#xA;went to work together to render fitting honour, where honour was so&#xA;eminently due. The appreciation of his splendid record of work in the&#xA;West is by no means confined to his brethren in the faith, for the fact&#xA;of the Buddhists having co-operated with the Hindus in acknowledging the&#xA;debt of gratitude, under which he has laid all followers of the several&#xA;Eastern creeds, is a proof positive of his services having been&#xA;estimated at their true worth, outside the ranks of Hinduism. The Swami&#xA;stayed only for four days at Colombo, and then started for Madras, where&#xA;arrangements are being made on a magnificent scale to extend to him an&#xA;impressive and enthusiastic welcome. We learn from a letter from the&#xA;Southern Presidency that the Hindu community there to a man is animated&#xA;by a sincere desire to celebrate, in a fitting manner, the return of the&#xA;“conquering hero,” and, on this behalf, it has set about its work in&#xA;sober earnest. It is but in the fitness of things that the Province,&#xA;which was the first to recognise the Swami&amp;rsquo;s genius, and which paid the&#xA;greater portion of the expenses of his voyage, should also be the first&#xA;to welcome him with open arms on his return to the country of his birth.&#xA;The Swami, after stopping in Madras for a few days, will leave for&#xA;Calcutta &amp;ndash; his native city &amp;ndash; where he is expected to arrive by the&#xA;middle of February. A prophet, they say, is not honored in his own&#xA;country, but, we hope, that, in this case, there will be a departure&#xA;from this rule, and that all sections of our community will combine to&#xA;welcome the Swami home in a right royal fashion. He may not be a Roman&#xA;hero, returning from the field of battle with the laurels of many&#xA;victories on his brow. But peace hath her victories no less than war,&#xA;and, in the bloodless battle that he has fought on behalf of a religion,&#xA;which teaches the highest doctrines of peace and brotherhood amongst&#xA;mankind, entitles him to the eternal gratitude of his fellow-believers.&#xA;He has raised the Hindu nation in the estimation of the Western world,&#xA;and has created for the Hindu faith an interest, which will last through&#xA;all time. It is impossible to over-estimate the value of his services in&#xA;America to the cause of Hinduism. Hundreds of men and women have&#xA;enlisted themselves under the standard, which he unfolded in America,&#xA;and some of them have even taken to the bowl and the yellow-robes. The&#xA;work, that he had to do, speedily assumed such proportions as to&#xA;necessitate the despatch of fresh re-inforcements from India to keep it&#xA;live in America. Swami Saradananda is busy in Boston in watering the&#xA;seeds, which were sown there by Swami Vivekananda. The classes opened in&#xA;several places in America, and even in England , for the teaching of&#xA;Hinduism in its purer form, are a sufficient token of the leaning&#xA;towards Vedantism, which the West has begun to manifest under the&#xA;inspiring and soul-stirring eloquence of Swami Vivekananda. Those that&#xA;attended the lectures, delivered the other day at the Emerald Theatre by&#xA;Mr. Turnbull of Chicago, must have been thoroughly impressed with the&#xA;magnitude of the change, which has been wrought by Swami Vivekananda in&#xA;the hearts and convictions of the American people. The Swami delivered&#xA;his first memorable address on Hinduism in the Parliament of Religions,&#xA;which was held in Chicago, in September, 1893. He made a tour of almost&#xA;all the principal places in the United States, and wherever he went, he&#xA;won&lt;/p&gt;</description>
