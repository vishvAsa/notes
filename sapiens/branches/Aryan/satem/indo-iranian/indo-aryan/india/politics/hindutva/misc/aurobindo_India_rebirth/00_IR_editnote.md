**Editors' Note**

> This book presents Sri Aurobindo's vision of India as it grew from his
> return from England in 1893 to his political days in the first decade
> of the century and finally to his forty-year-long withdrawal from
> public view during which he plunged into his “real work” of
> evolutionary action.
>
> This brief chronological selection from all that Sri Aurobindo said or
> wrote on India, her soul and her destiny, is by no means integral, but
> we trust it offers a sufficiently wide view of the lines of
> development Sri Aurobindo wished India to follow if she was to
> overcome the deep-rooted obstacles standing in the way of her rebirth.
>
> A few notes have been added to help put the excerpts into historical
> perspective, and a Chronology, list of References and Index have been
> provided at the end of the book.
>
> This third edition has been further revised and enlarged.
>
> *India’s Rebirth* has been received with enthusiasm in India and
> abroad and has been translated into Hindi, Telugu, Malayalam, Oriya,
> Tamil, Gujarati, Marathi, Bengali, Nepali, as well as French. Its
> companion volume, *India the Mother*, published in 1998, consists of
> excerpts from the writings, messages, letters and talks of Mother, Sri
> Aurobindo’s companion, between 1916 and 1973.
