DEAR MRS. WOODS,

Excuse my delay in answering your letter. I do not know when I will be
able to see you again. I am starting tomorrow for Madison and
Minneapolis.

The English gentleman you speak of is Dr. Momerie of London. He is a
well-known worker amongst the poor of London and is a very sweet man.
You perhaps do not know that the English church was the only religious
denomination in the world who did not send to us a representative, and
Dr. Momerie came to the Parliament in spite of the Archbishop of
Canterbury's denouncing of the Parliament of Religions.

My love for you, my kind friend, and your noble son is all the same
whether I write pretty often or not.

Can you express my books and the cover-all to the care of Mr. Hale? I am
in need of them. The express will be paid here.

The blessings of the Lord on you and yours.

Ever your friend,

VIVEKANANDA.

  
PS. If you have the occasion to write to Miss Sanborn and others of our
friends in the east, kindly give them my deepest respects.

Yours truly,

VIVEKANANDA.
