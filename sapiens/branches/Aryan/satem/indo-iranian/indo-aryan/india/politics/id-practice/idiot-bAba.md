title: Idiot bAbas
---

## Intro
- See "equality fallacy" section of [nAstika ID page](../nAstika/) for background.

## Misleading claims
- Certain savants, like Kanchi MahasvamI, produced fallacies that claimed crazy stuff such as "all religions are the same", "ramses and rama are related", "aztec is probably a corrpution of Astika" etc.. ([1](http://www.kamakoti.org/kamakoti/articles/Jagadguru%20Divya%20Chareitram%20Hindu%20Culture%20from%20Egypt%20to%20Java%20English.html)).
  - But, a mitigating factor: "the AchArya was not a svayaM-devatA-vAdin & upheld the deva-dharma sincerely despite certain serious idiosyncratic misapprehensions".

## Criticism
- Swami Aksharananda (Guyana) [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFJKQdhXzvo).
