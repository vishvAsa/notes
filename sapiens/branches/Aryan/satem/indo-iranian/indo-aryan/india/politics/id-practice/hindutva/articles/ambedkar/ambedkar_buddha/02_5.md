> § 1. Conversion of Rustic Brahmins
>
>  1. At the back of the Gridhrakutta mountains, near Rajagriha,
> there was a village of some seventy or so families, all of them
> Brahmins.  
>  2. The Buddha, wishing to convert these people, came to the place
> and sat down under a tree.  
>  3. The people, seeing the dignity of his presence, and the
> glorious appearance of his body, flocked round him, on which he asked
> the Brahmins how long they had dwelt in the mountain there, and what
> their occupation was.  
>  4. To this they replied, "We have dwelt here during thirty
> generations past, and our occupation is to tend cattle."  
>  5. On \[his\] asking further as to their religious belief they
> said, "We pay homage and sacrifice to the sun and the moon, the rain
> (water), and fire, according to the several seasons.  
>  6. "If one of us dies, we assemble and pray that he may be born in
> the heaven of Brahma, and so escape further transmigrations."  
>  7. The Buddha replied, "This is not a safe way, not by it can you
> benefit. The true way is to follow me, become true ascetics, and
> practise complete self-composure with a view to obtain Nirvana"; and
> then he added these lines:  
>  8. "They who consider truth as that which is untrue, and regard
> that which is untrue as truth--this is but to adopt heretical
> opinions, and can never lead to true advantage.  
>  9. "But to know as truth that which is true, and to regard as
> false that which is false, this is perfect rectitude, and this shall
> bring true profit.  
>  10. "Everywhere in the world there is death--there is no escape
> from it.  
>  11. "To consider this as the condition of all states of being,
> that there is nothing born but must die, and, therefore, to desire to
> escape birth and death, this is to exercise one's self in Religious
> Truth."  
>  12. The seventy Brahmins, hearing these words, desired at once to
> become Shamans; and on being welcomed by Buddha, their hair fell off,
> and they presented the appearance of true disciples.  
>  13. Then they all set out to return to the Vihara, and on the road
> certain thoughts about their wives and families troubled them, whilst
> at the same time a heavy downpour of rain prevented their advance.  
>  14. There were some ten houses on the roadside, in which they
> sought shelter; but on entering one of them it was soon perceived that
> through the roof the rain found its way, and there was but little
> protection from the rain.  
>  15. On this the Buddha added these lines, and said, "As when a
> house-roof is not properly secured, then the rain finds a way through
> it and drops within, so when the thoughts are not carefully
> controlled, the desires (sexual desires) will soon bore through all
> our good resolutions.  
>  16. "But as when a roof is well stopped then the water cannot leak
> through, so by controlling one's thoughts, and acting with reflection,
> no such desires can arise or disturb us."  
>  17. The seventy Brahmins, on hearing these lines, although
> convinced that their desires were reprehensible, yet were not wholly
> free from doubt; nevertheless they went forward.  
>  18. As they advanced, they saw some scented wrapping on the
> ground, and Buddha took the opportunity of calling their attention to
> it; and after this, seeing some fish-gut also lying about, he directed
> their notice to its ill odour, and then added these lines and said:  
>  19. "He who consorts with the low and the base, contracts the same
> character as he who handles a foul substance; he goes from worse to
> worse, and utterly without reason, he perfects himself in
> wickedness.  
>  20. "But the wise man (consorting with the wise) contracts the
> same character, even as the scent of a sweet odour adheres to him who
> handles it; advancing in wisdom, practising virtue, he goes on to
> perfection, and is satisfied."  
>  21. The seventy Brahmins, hearing these verses, convinced that
> their desire to return home and enjoy personal indulgence was the evil
> taint that adhered to them, cast off such thoughts and, going forward,
> came to the Vihara, and finally obtained the condition of Arhatas.

> § 2. Conversion of the Brahmins of Uttaravati
>
>  1. Once the Buddha was residing in the Jetavana, at Shravasti, and
> preaching his doctrine for the benefit of men and gods; there were in
> a country to the eastward, called Uttaravati, a company of 500
> Brahmins.  
>  2. They had agreed to go together to the residence of a Nirgrantha
> ascetic on the banks of the Ganges, who, by polluting himself with
> dirt, etc., aspired to the condition of a Rishi.  
>  3. On their way they were overtaken in the desert with thirst.
> Seeing a tree, and hoping to find some human habitation near, they
> hasened to it, but when they arrived there they found no sign of
> life.  
>  4. On this they raised their voices in lamentation. Suddenly from
> the tree they heard the voice of the resident Spirit, who asked them
> why they lamented so, and on hearing the reason, supplied them to the
> full with drink and meat.  
>  5. The Brahmins, ready to start onward, asked the Spirit what had
> been his previous history, that he was thus born.  
>  6. On which he explained that having gone to the assembly of
> priests in Shravasti when Sudatta had bestowed the garden on the
> Buddha, he had remained all night listening to the law Dhamma; and
> having filled his drinking cup with water as he went, had bestowed it
> in charity among the priests.  
>  7. On his return next morning, his wife in anger asked him what
> annoyance he had received, that he should stay away all night. On
> which he replied that he was not annoyed, but he had been to listen to
> the Buddha preaching at the Jetavana.  
>  8. On this his wife began roundly to abuse the Buddha, and said,
> "This Gotama is but a mad preacher, who deceives the people," and so
> on.  
>  9. "On this," he said, "I resented not her statements, but rather
> submitted to them; and so when I came to die I was born as a spirit,
> but on account of my pusillanimity I was confined to this tree," and
> then he recited these verses.  
>  10. "Sacrifices and such services are sources of misery, day and
> night, a continual burden and anxiety.  
>  11. "To escape sorrow, and destroy the elements of the body, a man
> should attend to the Law (of Buddha), and arrive at deliverance from
> all worldly Rules of Religion (World Rishis)."  
>  12. The Brahmins, having heard these words, resolved themselves to
> go to Shravasti, to the place where the Buddha was, and having
> explained the object of their visit, the world-honoured said to
> them:  
>  13. "Although a man goes naked with tangled hair, or though he
> clothes himself with a few leaves or garment of bark, though he covers
> himself with dirt and sleeps on the stones, what use is this in
> getting rid of impure thoughts?  
>  14. "But he who neither contends \[n\]or kills, \[n\]or destroys
> by fire, who desires not to get the victory, who is moved by goodwill
> towards all the world--there is no ground in such a case for ill-will
> or hate.  
>  15. "To sacrifice to spirits in order to find peace (merit), or,
> after this life expecting reward--his happiness is not one quarter of
> that man's who pays homage to the good.  
>  16. "He who is ever intent on good conduct and due reverence to
> others, who always venerates old age,--four happy consequences
> increasingly attend that man--beauty and strength, and life and
> peace."  
>  17. On hearing this from her husband, the wife became
> reconciled.
