## Internal to hindu-s

- Inadequate cultural education and successful subversion by enemies
    - Self vs non-self discrimination
- Self-imposed dumbocracy

### Bottom-heavy human resource

    - Comparison - [![](https://i.imgur.com/iyN032v.jpg)](https://i.imgur.com/iyN032v.jpg)
- "This leads to dilution of the high performers so they never cross the threshold for intensive sustained knowledge production over long periods. 2nd their efforts are ahead of their time or out of place for rest of population cannot really resonate with their innovations."
- "The low-end might also work against the advances of the highend & can easily be exploited as cannon fodder by the enemies."

### Racinomisia (= hatred of one's cultural roots)

#### Of the abrahamists

- See [here](../../../rivals/abe-disease/islam/intro/).

#### Of the Indian left

Yogindar Sikand's piece typifies the racinomisia-filled attitude of the "[Indian Left](http://www.countercurrents.org/sikand190412.htm)".

The mechanism and effects of this influence has been explored in detail in ["Breaking India: Western Interventions in Dravidian and Dalit Faultlines"](http://www.breakingindia.com/) by Rajiv Malhotra and Aravindan Neelakandan.

## External to hindu-s
- Abrahamist subversion, tending towards eventual domination, in India
