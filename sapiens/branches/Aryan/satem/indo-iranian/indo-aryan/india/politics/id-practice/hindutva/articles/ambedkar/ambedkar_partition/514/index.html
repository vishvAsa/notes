<p>CHAPTER XIV</p>
<p>THE PROBLEMS OF PAKISTAN</p>
<p>I<br>
[Problems of border delineation and population transfer must be
addressed]</p>
<p>Among the many problems to which the partition of India into
Pakistan and Hindustan must give rise will be the following three
problems:—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) The problem of the allocation of the financial assets and
liabilities of the present Government of India,</p>
<p>(2) The problem of the delimitation of the areas, and</p>
<p>(3) The problem of the transfer of population from Pakistan to
Hindustan and <em>vice versa</em>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of these problems the first is consequential [=contingent], in the
sense that it would be worthwhile to consider it only when the partition
of India has been agreed to by the parties concerned. The two other
problems stand on a different footing. They are conditions precedent to
Pakistan in the sense that there are many people who will not make up
their mind on Pakistan unless they are satisfied that some reasonable
and just solution of them is possible. I will, therefore, confine myself
to the consideration only of the last two problems of Pakistan.</p>
<p>II<br>
[What might we assume to be the borders of West and East Pakistan?]</p>
<p>On the question of the boundaries of Pakistan we have had so far no
clear and authoritative statement from the Muslim League. In fact it is
one of the complaints made by the Hindus that while Mr. Jinnah has been
carrying on a whirlwind campaign in favour of Pakistan, which has
resulted in fouling the political atmosphere in the country, Mr. Jinnah
has not thought fit to inform his critics of the details regarding the
boundaries of his proposed Pakistan. Mr. Jinnah&rsquo;s argument has all along
been that any discussion regarding the boundaries of Pakistan is
premature and that the boundaries of Pakistan will be a matter for
discussion when the principle of Pakistan has been admitted. It may be a
good rhetorical answer, but it certainly does not help those who wish to
apply their mind without taking sides to offer whatever help they can to
bring about a peaceful solution of this problem. Mr. Jinnah seems to be
under the impression that if a person is committed to the principle of
Pakistan, he will be bound to accept Mr. Jinnah&rsquo;s plan of Pakistan.
There cannot be a greater mistake than this. A person may accept the
principle of Pakistan, which only means the partition of India. But it
is difficult to understand how the acceptance of this principle can
commit him to Mr. Jinnah&rsquo;s plan of Pakistan. Indeed if no plan of
Pakistan is satisfactory to him he will be quite free to oppose any form
of Pakistan, although he may be in favour of the principle of Pakistan.
The plan of Pakistan and the principle of Pakistan are therefore two
quite distinct propositions. There is nothing wrong in this view. By way
of illustration it may be said that the principle of self-determination
is like an explosive substance. One may agree in principle to its use
when the necessity and urgency of the occasion is proved. But no one can
consent to the use of the dynamite without first knowing the area that
is intended to be blown up. If the dynamite is going to blow up the
whole structure or if it is not possible to localize its application to
a particular part, he may well refuse to apply the dynamite and prefer
to use some other means of solving the problem. Specifications of
boundary lines seem therefore to be an essential preliminary for working
out in concrete shape the principle of Pakistan. Equally essential it is
for a bona fide protagonist of Pakistan not to hide from the public the
necessary particulars of the scheme of Pakistan. Such contumacy and
obstinacy as [that] shown by Mr. Jinnah in refusing to declare the
boundaries of his Pakistan is unforgivable in a statesman. Nevertheless,
those who are interested in solving the question of Pakistan need not
wait to resolve the problems of Pakistan until Mr. Jinnah condescends to
give full details. Only, one has to carry on the argument on the basis
of certain assumptions. In this discussion I will assume that what the
Muslim League desires is that the boundaries of the Western Pakistan
should be the present boundaries of the Provinces of the North-West
Frontier, the Punjab, Sind and Baluchistan, and that the boundaries of
Eastern Pakistan should be the boundaries of the present Province of
Bengal with a few districts of Assam thrown in.</p>
<p>III<br>
[Both Muslims and Hindus ignore the need for genuine
self-determination]</p>
<p>The question for consideration therefore is: Is this a just claim?
The claim is said to be founded on the principle of self-determination.
To be able to assess the justice of this claim it is necessary to have a
clear understanding of the scope and limitations of the principle of
self-determination. Unfortunately, there seems to be a complete lack of
such an understanding. It is therefore necessary to begin with the
question: What is the <em>de facto</em> and <em>de jure</em> connotation of this
principle of self-determination? The term self-determination has become
current since the last few years. But it describes something which is
much older. The idea underlying self-determination has developed along
two different lines. During the 19th century self-determination meant
the right to establish a form of government in accordance with the
wishes of the people. Secondly, self-determination has meant the right
to obtain national independence from an alien race irrespective of the
form of government. The agitation for Pakistan has reference to
self-determination in its second aspect.</p>
<p>Confining the discussion to this aspect of Pakistan, it seems to me
essential that the following points regarding the issue of
self-determination should be borne in mind.</p>
<p>In the first place, self-determination must be by the people. This
point is too simple even to need mention. But it has become necessary to
emphasize it. Both the Muslim League and the Hindu Maha Sabha seem to be
playing fast and loose with the idea of self-determination. An area is
claimed by the Muslim League for inclusion in Pakistan because the
people of the area are Muslims. An area is also claimed for being
included in Pakistan because the ruler of the area is a Muslim, though
the majority of the people of that area are non-Muslims. The Muslim
League is claiming the benefit of self-determination in India. At the
same time the League is opposed to self-determination being applied to
Palestine. The League claims Kashmir as a Muslim State because the
majority of people are Muslims, and also Hyderabad because the ruler is
Muslim. In like manner the Hindu Maha Sabha claims an area to be
included in Hindustan because the people of the area are non-Muslims. It
also comes forward to claim an area to be a part of Hindustan because
the ruler is a Hindu though the majority of the people are Muslims. Such
strange and conflicting claims are entirely due to the fact that either
the parties to Pakistan, namely, the Hindus and the Muslims, do not
understand what self-determination means, or are busy in perverting the
principle of self-determination to enable them to justify themselves in
carrying out the organized territorial loot in which they now seem to be
engaged. India will be thrown into a state of utter confusion whenever
the question of reorganization of its territories comes up for
consideration, if people have no exact notions as to what
self-determination involves and have not the honesty to stand by the
principle and take the consequences whatever they be. It is, therefore,
well to emphasize what might be regarded as too simple to require
mention, namely, that self-determination is a determination by the
people and by nobody else.</p>
<p>The second point to note is the degree of imperative character with
which the principle of self-determination can be said to be invested. As
has been said by Mr. O&rsquo; Connor**<a href="#n01">/1/</a>**:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The doctrine of self-determination is not a universal principle at
all. The most that can be said about it is that generally speaking, it
is a sound working rule, founded upon justice, making for harmony and
peace and for the development of people in their own fashion, which,
again generally speaking, is the best fashion. But it must yield to
circumstances, of which size and geographical situation are some of
the most important. Whether the rule should prevail against the
circumstances or the circumstances against the rule can be determined
only by the application of one&rsquo;s common sense or sense of justice, or,
as a Benthamite would prefer to put it, by reference to the greatest
good of the greatest number— all these three, if properly understood,
are really different methods of expressing the same thing. In solving
a particular case very great difficulties may arise. There are facts
one way and facts another way. Facts of one kind may make a special
appeal to some minds, little or none to others. The problem may be of
the kind that is called imponderable, that is to say, no definite
conclusion that will be accepted by the generality of the mankind may
be possible. There are cases in which it is no more possible to say
that a nation is right in its claim to interfere with the
self-determination of another nation than that it is to say that it is
wrong. It is a matter of opinion, upon which honest and impartial
minds may differ.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>There are two reasons why this must be so. Firstly, nationality is
not such a sacrosanct and absolute principle as to give it the character
of a categorical imperative, overriding every other consideration.
Secondly, separation is not quite so essential for the maintenance and
preservation of a distinct nationality.</p>
<p>There is a third point to be borne in mind in connection with the
issue of self-determination. Self-determination for a nationality may
take the form of cultural independence or may take the form of
territorial independence. Which form it can take must depend upon the
territorial layout of the population. If a nationality lives in easily
severable and contiguous areas, other things being equal, a case can be
made out for territorial independence. But where owing to an
inextricable intermingling the nationalities are so mixed up that the
areas they occupy are not easily severable, then all that they can be
entitled to is cultural independence. Territorial separation in a case
like this is an impossibility. They are doomed to live together. The
only other alternative they have is to migrate.</p>
<p>IV<br>
[Punjab and Bengal would thus necessarily be subject to division]</p>
<p>Having defined the scope and limitations of the idea of
self-determination, we can now proceed to deal with the question of
[the] boundaries of Pakistan. How does the claim of the Muslim League
for the present boundary to remain the boundaries of Pakistan stand in
the light of these considerations? The answer to this question seems to
me quite clear. The geographical layout seems to decide the issue. No
special pleading of any kind is required. In the case of the North-West
Frontier Province, Baluchistan and Sind, the Hindus and the Muslims are
intermixed. In these Provinces a case for territorial separation for the
Hindus seems to be impossible. They must remain content with cultural
independence and such political safeguards as may be devised for their
safety. The case of the Punjab and Bengal stands on a different footing.
A glance at the map shows that the layout of the population of the
Hindus and the Muslims in these two Provinces is totally different from
what one finds in the other three Provinces. The non-Muslims in the
Punjab and Bengal are not found living in small islands in the midst of
and surrounded by a vast Muslim population spread over the entire
surface as is the case with the North-West Frontier Province,
Baluchistan and Sind. In Bengal and the Punjab the Hindus occupy two
different areas contiguous and severable. In these circumstances, there
is no reason for conceding what the Muslim League seems to demand,
namely, that the present boundaries of the Punjab and Bengal shall
continue to be the boundaries of Western Pakistan and Eastern Pakistan.</p>
<p>Two conclusions necessarily follow from the foregoing discussion.
One is that the non-Muslims of the Punjab and Bengal have a case for
exclusion from Pakistan by territorial severance of the areas they
occupy. The other is that the non-Muslims of North-West Frontier
Province, Baluchistan and Sind have no case for exclusion and are only
entitled to cultural independence and political safeguards. To put the
same thing in a different way it may be said that the Muslim League
claim for demanding that the boundaries of Sind, North-West Frontier and
Baluchistan shall remain as they are cannot be opposed. But that in the
case of the Punjab and Bengal such a claim is untenable and that the
non-Muslims of these Provinces, if they desire, can claim that the
territory they occupy should be excluded by a redrawing of the
boundaries of these two Provinces.</p>
<p>V<br>
[A demand for regional self-determination must always be a two-edged
sword]</p>
<p>One should have thought that such a claim by the non-Muslim
minorities of the Punjab and Bengal for the redrawing of the boundaries
would be regarded by the Muslim League as a just and reasonable claim.
The possibility of the redrawing of boundaries was admitted in the
Lahore Resolution of the Muslim League passed in March 1940. The
Resolution 12**<a href="#n02">/2/</a>** said:—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The establishment of completely independent States formed by
demarcating geographically contiguous units into regions which shall
be so constituted, <em>with such territorial readjustments as may be
necessary,</em> that the areas in which the Musalmans are numerically in a
majority, as in the north-western and eastern zones of India, shall be
grouped together to constitute independent States as Muslim free
national homelands in which the constituent units shall be autonomous
and sovereign.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>That this continued to be the position of the Muslim League is clear
from the resolution passed by the Muslim League on the Cripps Proposals,
as anyone who cares to read it will know. But there are indications that
Mr. Jinnah has changed his view. At a public meeting held on 16th
November 1942 in Jullunder, Mr. Jinnah is reported to have expressed
himself in the following terms**<a href="#n03">/3/</a>**:—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The latest trick—1 call it nothing but a trick—to puzzle and to
mislead the ignorant masses purposely, and those playing the game
understand it, is, why should the right of self-determination be
confined to Muslims only and why not extend it to other communities?
Having said that all have the right of self-determination, they say
the Punjab must be divided into so many bits; likewise the North-West
Frontier Province and Sind. Thus there will be hundreds of Pakistans.</p>
<p>SUB-NATIONAL GROUPS</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is the author of this new formula that every community has the
right of self-determination all over India? Either it is colossal
ignorance or mischief and trick. Let me give them a reply, that the
Musalmans claim the right of self-determination because they are a
national group on a given territory which is their homeland and in the
zones where they are in a majority. Have you known anywhere in history
that national groups scattered all over have been given a State? Where
are you going to get a State for them? In that case you have got 14
per cent. Muslims in the United Provinces. Why not have a State for
them? Muslims in the United Provinces are not a national group; they
are scattered. Therefore in constitutional language they are
characterized as a sub-national group who cannot expect anything more
than what is due from any civilized Government to a minority. I hope I
have made the position clear. The Muslims are not a sub-national
group; it is their birthright to claim and exercise the right of
self-determination.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Jinnah has completely missed the point. The point raised by his
critics was not with regard to the non-Muslim minorities in general. It
had reference to the non-Muslim minorities in the Punjab and Bengal.
Does Mr. Jinnah propose to dispose of the case of non-Muslim minorities
who occupy a compact and an easily severable territory by his theory of
a sub-nation? If that is so, then one is bound to say that a proposition
cruder than his it would be difficult to find in any political
literature. The concept of a sub-nation is unheard of. It is not only an
ingenious concept but it is also a preposterous concept. What does the
theory of a subnation connote? If I understand its implications
correctly, it means a sub-nation must not be severed from the nation to
which it belongs even when severance is possible; it means that the
relations between a nation and a sub-nation are no higher than the
relations which subsist between a man and his chattels, or between
property and its incidents. Chattels go with the owner, incidents go
with property, so a sub-nation goes with a nation. Such is the chain of
reasoning in Mr. Jinnah&rsquo;s argument. But does Mr. Jinnah seriously wish
to argue that the Hindus of the Punjab and Bengal are only chattels, so
that they must always go wherever the Muslims of the Punjab and the
Muslims of Bengal choose to drive them? Such an argument will be too
absurd to be entertained by any reasonable man. It is also the most
illogical argument, and certainly it should not be difficult for so
mature a lawyer as Mr. Jinnah to see the illogicality of it. If a
numerically smaller nation is only a sub-nation in relation to a
numerically larger nation and has no right to territorial separation,
why can it not be said that taking India as a whole the Hindus are a
nation and the Muslims a sub-nation and as a sub-nation they have no
right to self-determination or territorial separation?</p>
<p>Already there exists a certain amount of suspicion with regard to
the <em>bona fides</em> of Pakistan. Rightly or wrongly, most people suspect
that Pakistan is pregnant with mischief. They think that it has two
motives, one immediate, the other ultimate. The immediate motive, it is
said, is to join with the neighbouring Muslim countries and form a
Muslim Federation. The ultimate motive is for the Muslim Federation to
invade Hindustan and conquer, or rather reconquer, the Hindu and
re-establish [a] Muslim Empire in India. Others think that Pakistan is
the culmination of the scheme of hostages which lay behind the demand
put forth by Mr. Jinnah in his fourteen points, for the creation of
separate Muslim Provinces. Nobody can fathom the mind of the Muslims and
reach the real motives that lie behind their demand for Pakistan. The
Hindu opponents of Pakistan, if they suspect that the real motives of
the Muslims are different from the apparent ones, may take note of them
and plan accordingly. They cannot oppose Pakistan because the motives
behind it are bad. But they are entitled to ask Mr. Jinnah, Why does he
want to have a communal problem within Pakistan? However vicious may be
the motives behind Pakistan, it should possess at least one virtue. The
ideal of Pakistan should be not to have a communal problem inside it.
This is the least of virtues one can expect from Pakistan. If Pakistan
is to be plagued by a communal problem in the same way as India has
been, why have Pakistan at all? It can be welcomed only if it provides
an escape from the communal problem. The way to avoid it is to arrange
the boundaries in such a way that it will be an ethnic State without a
minority and a majority pitched against each other. Fortunately it can
be made into an ethnic State, if only Mr. Jinnah will allow it.
Unfortunately Mr. Jinnah objects to it. Therein lies the chief cause for
suspicion, and Mr. Jinnah, instead of removing it, is deepening it by
such absurd, illogical and artificial distinctions as nations and
sub-nations.</p>
<p>Rather than resort to such absurd and illogical propositions and
defend what is indefensible and oppose what is just, would it not be
better for Mr. Jinnah to do what Sir Edward Carson did in the matter of
the delimitation of the boundaries of Ulster? As all those who know the
vicissitudes through which the Irish Home Rule question passed know that
it was at the Craigavon meeting held on 23rd September 1911 that Sir
Edward Carson formulated his policy that in Ulster there will be a
government of Imperial Parliament or a Government of Ulster, but never a
Home Rule Government. As the Imperial Parliament was proposing to
withdraw its government, this policy meant the establishment of a
provisional government for Ulster. This policy was embodied in a
resolution passed at a joint meeting of delegates representing the
Ulster Unionist Council, the County Grand Orange Lodges and Unionist
Clubs held in Belfast on 25th September 1911. The Provisional Government
of Ulster was to come into force on the day of the passing of the Home
Rule Bill. An important feature of this policy was to invest the
Provisional Government with a jurisdiction over all <em>&ldquo;those districts
which they (Ulsterites) could control.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The phrase &ldquo;those districts which they could control&rdquo; was no doubt
meant to include the whole of the administrative division of Ulster. Now
this administrative division of Ulster included nine counties. Of these
three were overwhelmingly Catholic. This meant the compulsory retention
of the three Catholic counties under Ulster against their wishes. But
what did Sir Edward Carson do in the end ? It did not take long for Sir
Edward Carson to discover that Ulster with three overwhelmingly Catholic
districts would be a liability, and with all the courage of a true
leader he came out with a declaration that he proposed to cut down his
losses and make Ulster safe. In his speech in the House of Commons on
the 18th of May 1920 he announced that he was content with six counties
only. The speech that he made on that occasion giving his reasons why he
was content only with six counties is worth quoting. This is what he
said**<a href="#n04">/4/</a>**:—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The truth is that we came to the conclusion after many anxious hours
and anxious days of going into the whole matter, almost parish by
parish and townland by townland, that <em>we would have no chance of
successfully starting a Parliament in Belfast which would be
responsible for the government of Donegal, Caven and Monaghan.</em> It
would be perfectly idle for us to come here and pretend that we should
be in a position to do so. We should like to have the very largest
areas possible, naturally. That is a system of land grabbing that
prevails in all countries for widening the jurisdiction of the various
governments that are set u ; but there is no use in our undertaking a
government which we know would be a failure if we were saddled with
these three counties.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>These are wise, sagacious and most courageous words. The situation
in which they were uttered has a close parallel with the situation that
is likely to be created in the Punjab and Bengal by the application of
the principle of Pakistan. The Muslim League and Mr. Jinnah, if they
want a peaceful Pakistan, should not forget to take note of them. It is
no use asking the non-Muslim minorities in the Punjab and Bengal to be
satisfied with safeguards. If the Musalmans are not prepared to be
content with safeguards against the tyranny of Hindu majority, why
should the Hindu minorities be asked to be satisfied with the safeguards
against the tyranny of the Muslim majority? If the Musalmans can say to
the Hindus &ldquo;Damn your safeguards, we don&rsquo;t want to be ruled by you&rdquo;—an
argument which Carson used against Redmond—the same argument can be
returned by the Hindus of the Punjab and Bengal against the Muslim offer
to be content with safeguards.</p>
<p>The point is that this attitude is not calculated to lead to a
peaceful solution of the problem of Pakistan. Sabre-rattling or show of
force will not do. In the first place, this is a game which two can
play. In the second place, arms may be an element of strength. But to
have arms is not enough. As Rousseau said: &ldquo;The strongest is never
strong enough to be always master, unless he transforms his might into
right, and obedience into duty.&rdquo; Only ethics can convert might into
right and obedience into duty. The League must see that its claim for
Pakistan is founded on ethics.</p>
<p>VI<br>
[The problems of population transfer are solvable and need not detain
us]</p>
<p>So much for the problem of boundaries. I will now turn to the
problem of the minorities which must remain within Pakistan even after
boundaries are redrawn. There are two methods of protecting their
interests.</p>
<p>First is to provide safeguards in the constitution for the
protection of the political and cultural rights of the minorities. To
Indians this is a familiar matter and it is unnecessary to enlarge upon
it.</p>
<p>Second is to provide for their transfer from Pakistan to Hindustan.
Many people prefer this solution and would be ready and willing to
consent to Pakistan if it can be shown that an exchange of population is
possible. But they regard this as a staggering and a baffling problem.
This no doubt is the sign of a panic-stricken mind. If the matter is
considered in a cool and calm temper, it will be found that the problem
is neither staggering nor baffling.</p>
<p>To begin with, consider the dimensions of the problem. On what scale
is this transfer going to be? In determining the scale one is bound to
take into account three considerations. In the first place, if the
boundaries of the Punjab and Bengal are redrawn, there will be no
question of transfer of population so far as these two Provinces are
concerned. In the second place, the Musalmans residing in Hindustan do
not propose to migrate to Pakistan, nor does the League want their
transfer. In the third place, the Hindus in the North-West Frontier
Province, Sind and Baluchistan do not want to migrate. If these
assumptions are correct, the problem of transfer of population is far
from being a staggering problem. Indeed it is so small that there is no
need to regard it as a problem at all.</p>
<p>Assuming it does become a problem, will it be a baffling problem?
Experience shows that it is not a problem which it is impossible to
solve. To devise a solution for such a problem it might be well to begin
by asking what are the possible difficulties that are likely to arise in
the way of a person migrating from one area to another on account of
political changes. The following are obvious enough: (1) The machinery
for effecting and facilitating the transfer of population. (2)
Prohibition by Government against migration. (3) Levy by Government of
heavy taxation on the transfer of goods by the migrating family. (4) The
impossibility for a migrating family to carry with it to its new home
its immovable property. (5) The difficulty of obviating a resort to
unfair practices with a view to depress unduly the value of the property
of the migrating family. (6) The fear of having to make good the loss by
not being able to realize the full value of the property by sale in the
market. (7) The difficulty of realizing pensionary and other charges due
to the migrating family from the country of departure. (8) The
difficulty of fixing the currency in which payment is to be made. If
these difficulties are removed, the way to the transfer of population
becomes clear.</p>
<p>The first three difficulties can be easily removed by the two States
of Pakistan and Hindustan agreeing to a treaty embodying an article in
some such terms as follows :—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The Governments of Pakistan and Hindustan agree to appoint a
Commission consisting of equal number of representatives and presided
over by a person who is approved by both and who is not a national of
either.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The expense of the Commission and of its Committees both on account
of its maintenance and its operation shall be borne by the two
Governments in equal proportion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Government of Pakistan and the Government of Hindustan hereby
agree to grant to all their nationals within their territories who
belong to ethnic minorities the right to express their desire to
emigrate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Governments of the States above mentioned undertake to facilitate
in every way the exercise of this right and to interpose no obstacles,
directly or indirectly, to freedom of emigration. All laws and
regulations whatsoever which conflict with freedom of emigration shall
be considered as null and void.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>The fourth and the fifth difficulties which relate to transfer of
property can be effectually met by including in the treaty articles the
following terms:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those who, in pursuance of these articles, determine to take advantage
of the right to migrate shall have the right to carry with them or to
have transported their movable property of any kind without any duty
being imposed upon them on this account.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;So far as immovable property is concerned it shall be liquidated by
the Commission in accordance with the following provisions:</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) The Commission shall appoint a Committee of Experts to
estimate the value of the immovable property of the emigrant. The
emigrant interested shall have a representative chosen by him on the
Committee.</p>
<p>(2) The Commission shall take necessary measures with a view to
the sale of immovable property of the emigrant.&rdquo;</p></blockquote></blockquote>
<p>As for the rest of the difficulties relating to reimbursement for
loss, for payment of pensionary and charges for specifying the currency
in which payments are to be made, the following articles in the treaty
should be sufficient to meet them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;(1) The difference in the estimated value and the sale price of the
immovable property of the emigrant shall be paid in to the Commission
by the Government of the country of departure as soon as the former
has notified it of the resulting deficiency. One-fourth of this
payment may be made in the money of the country of departure and
three-fourths in gold or short term gold bonds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;(2) The Commission shall advance to the emigrants the value of their
immovable property determined as above.</p>
<p>&ldquo;(3) All civil or military pensions acquired by an emigrant at the
dale of the signature of the present treaty shall be capitalized at
the charge of the debtor Government, which must pay the amount to the
Commission for the account of its owners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;(4) The funds necessary to facilitate emigration shall be advanced by
the States interested in the Commission.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Are not these provisions sufficient to overcome the difficulties
regarding transfer of population? There are of course other
difficulties. But even those are not insuperable. They involve questions
of policy. The first question is: is the transfer of population to be
compulsory, or is it to be voluntary? The second is: is this right to
State-aided transfer to be open to all, or is it to be restricted to any
particular class of persons? The third is: how long is Government going
to remain liable to be bound by these provisions, particularly the
provision for making good the loss on the sale of immovable property?
Should the provisions be made subject to a time limit or should the
liability be continued indefinitely?</p>
<p>With regard to the first point, both are possible, and there are
instances of both having been put into effect. The transfer of
population between Greece and Bulgaria was on a voluntary basis, while
that between Greece and Turkey was on a compulsory basis. Compulsory
transfer strikes one as being <em>prima facie</em> wrong. It would not be fair
to compel a man to change his ancestral habitat if he does not wish to,
unless the peace and tranquillity of the State is likely to be put in
jeopardy by his continuing to live where he is or such transfer becomes
necessary in his own interest. What is required is that those who want
to transfer should be able to do so without impediment and without loss.
I am therefore of [the] opinion that transfer should not be forced,
but should be left open for those who declare their intention to
transfer.</p>
<p>As to the second point, it is obvious that only members of a
minority can be allowed to take advantage of the scheme of State-aided
transfer. But even this restriction may not be sufficient to exclude all
those who ought not to get the benefit of this scheme. It must be
confined to certain well-defined minorities who on account of ethnic or
religious differences are sure to be subjected to discrimination or
victimization.</p>
<p>The third point is important and is likely to give rise to serious
difference of opinion. On a fair view of the matter it can be said that
it is quite unreasonable to compel a Government to keep open for an
indefinite period the option to migrate at Government cost .There is
nothing unfair in telling a person that if he wants to take advantage
of the provisions of the scheme of State-aided migration contained in
the forgoing articles, he must exercise his option to migrate within a
stated period, and that if he decides to migrate after the period has
elapsed he will be free to migrate, but it will have to be at his own
cost and without the aid of the State There is no inequity in thus
limiting the right to State aid. State aid becomes a necessary part of
the scheme because the migration is a resultant consequence of political
changes over which individual citizens have no control. But migration
may not be the result of political change. It may be for other causes,
and when it is for other causes, aid to the emigrant cannot be an
obligation on the State. The only way to determine whether migration is
for political reasons or for private reasons is to relate it to a
definite point of time. When it takes place with in a defined period
from the happening of a political change, it may be presumed to be
political. When it occurs after the period, it may be presumed to be for
private reasons. There is nothing unjust in this. The same rule of
presumption governs the cases of civil servants who, when a political
change takes place, are allowed to retire on proportionate pensions if
they retire within a given period, but not if they retire after it has
lapsed.</p>
<p>If the policy in these matters is as I suggest it should be, it may
be given effect to by the inclusion of the following articles in the
treaty:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The right to voluntary emigration may be exercised under this treaty
by any person belonging to an ethnic minority who is over 18 years of
age.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A declaration made before the Commission shall be sufficient evidence
of intention to exercise the right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The choice of the husband shall carry with it that of the wife, the
option of parents or guardians that of their children or wards aged
less than 18 years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The right to the benefit provided by this treaty shall lapse if the
option to migrate is not exercised within a period of 5 years from the
date of signing the treaty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The duties of the Commission shall be terminated within six months
after the expiration of the period of five years from the date when
the Commission starts to function.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>What about the cost? The question of cost will be important only if
the transfer is to be compulsory. A scheme of voluntary transfer cannot
place a very heavy financial burden on the State. Men love property more
than liberty. Many will prefer to endure tyranny at the hands of their
political masters [rather] than change the habitat in which they are
rooted. As Adam Smith said, of all the things man is the most difficult
cargo to transport. Cost therefore need not frighten anybody.</p>
<p>What about its workability? The scheme is not new. It has been tried
and found workable. It was put into effect after the last European War,
to bring about a transfer**<a href="#n05">/5/</a>** of population between Greece
and Bulgaria and Turkey and Greece. Nobody can deny that it has worked,
has been tried and found workable. The scheme I have outlined is a copy
of the same scheme. It had the effect of bringing about a transfer of
population between Greece and Bulgaria and Turkey and Greece. Nobody can
deny that it was [=has] worked with signal success. What succeeded
elsewhere may well be expected to succeed in India.</p>
<p>The issue of Pakistan is far from simple. But it is not so difficult
as it is made out to be, provided the principle and the ethics of it are
agreed upon. If it is difficult it is only because it is heart-rending,
and nobody wishes to think of its problems and their solutions, as the
very idea of it is so painful. But once sentiment is banished and it is
decided that there shall be Pakistan, the problems arising out of it are
neither staggering nor baffling.</p>
