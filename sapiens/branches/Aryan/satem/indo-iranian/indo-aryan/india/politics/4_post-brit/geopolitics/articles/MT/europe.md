## Pivot

The A~Nglamleccha/pa~nchanetraka confederation has tried its best to throw sand in the gears of the H to thwart their restoration since independence: the tacit military support for TSP immediately after independence; the refusal to support large steel plants etc. 

Unfortunately, the internal social, biological and political issues of the H have repeatedly provided them with handles to do. 

The current pivot towards "Europe" is the return of an old cycle vis-a-vis the A~NglamlechCha. That has to be played carefully, with a realization of how it failed in the previous major historical cycle of it.


## Relevance

If the current situation holds, West-Central Europe will lose its geopolitical relevance. It will not be its boogeyman, Russia, but its low fertility, inability to deal with its marUnmatta friends and Galtonism. All these factors will imply a divergence vis-a-vis India but a clean break with them is neither possible or nor advisable now, as H still depend on them for cutting-edge weaponry.
