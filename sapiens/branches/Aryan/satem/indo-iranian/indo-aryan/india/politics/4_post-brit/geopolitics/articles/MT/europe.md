If the current situation holds, West-Central Europe will lose its geopolitical relevance. It will not be its boogeyman, Russia, but its low fertility, inability to deal with its marUnmatta friends and Galtonism. All these factors will imply a divergence vis-a-vis India but a clean break with them is neither possible or nor advisable now, as H still depend on them for cutting-edge weaponry.
