§ 1. The Appointment of a Successor
The Exalted One was at one time sojourning among the Sakyans, in the mango grove of the Sakyan family named the archers. Now at that time Nataputta the Nigantha had just died at Pava. And at his death the Niganthas became disunited and divided into two parties, in mutual strife and conflict, quarrelling and wounding each other with wordy weapons. Now Chunda, the novice, having passed the rainy season at Pava, came to see the venerable Ananda and said, “Nataputta, sir, the Nigantha had just died at Pava. And he being dead, the Niganthas have become disunited and divided and are quarrelling and wounding one another. This is because they are without a protector.” Then said the venerable Ananda, “Friend Chunda, this is a worthy subject to bring before the Exalted One. Let us go to him, and tell him about it.” “Very good, sir,” replied Chunda. So the venerable Ananda and Chunda, the novice, sought out the Exalted One; and saluting him, told him about the Niganthas, and pleaded the necessity of appointing a successor. The Blessed Lord, on hearing what Chunda had said, replied, “But consider, Chunda, where a teacher hath arisen in the world, Arahat, supremely enlightened; where a doctrine hath been well set forth, well imparted, effectual for guidance, conducive to peace; but where his disciples have not become proficient in good Norm, nor has it been made a thing of saving grace to them, well proclaimed among men when their teacher passes away. “Now for such a teacher to die, Chunda, is a great affliction for his disciples, and a great danger to his Dhamma. “But consider, Chunda, where a teacher has appeared in the world who is all-enlightened; where the Norm has been well set forth, well imparted, effectual for guidance, conducive to peace; and where the disciples have become proficient in the good Norm, and where the full scope of the higher life has become manifest to them when that teacher passes away. “Now for such a teacher, Chunda, to die, is not an affliction for his disciples. Why then have a successor?” When Ananda raised the same question on another occasion, the Blessed Lord said, “What think you, Ananda? Do you observe even a couple of almsmen at variance about what I have taught?” “No. But those who are about the Lord might, after his death, stir up quarrel in the confraternity respecting the regimen or of the code, and such quarrels would make for general grief.” “Of little concern, Ananda, are quarrels respecting rigours of regimen or of the code; it is possible quarrels in the confraternity about the path which really matter,” said the Blessed Lord. “These disputes about the path cannot be settled by a dictator. What then a successor can do, unless he acts as a dictator? “The controversies regarding the path cannot be settled by a dictator. “The decision of a controversy should be reached by the fraternity. The whole conjoint body should assemble and thrash out the matter till there is agreement, and then to settle it conformably with such agreement. “Majority agreements is the way to settle the disputes, and not the appointment of a successor.” § 2.

<p>§ 1. The Appointment of a Successor</p>
<ol>
<li>The Exalted One was at one time sojourning among the Sakyans,
in the mango grove of the Sakyan family named the archers.</li>
<li>Now at that time Nataputta the Nigantha had just died at Pava.
And at his death the Niganthas became disunited and divided into two
parties, in mutual strife and conflict, quarrelling and wounding each
other with wordy weapons.</li>
<li>Now Chunda, the novice, having passed the rainy season at Pava,
came to see the venerable Ananda and said, &ldquo;Nataputta, sir, the
Nigantha had just died at Pava. And he being dead, the Niganthas have
become disunited and divided and are quarrelling and wounding one
another. This is because they are without a protector.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Then said the venerable Ananda, &ldquo;Friend Chunda, this is a
worthy subject to bring before the Exalted One. Let us go to him, and
tell him about it.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Very good, sir,&rdquo; replied Chunda.</li>
<li>So the venerable Ananda and Chunda, the novice, sought out the
Exalted One; and saluting him, told him about the Niganthas, and
pleaded the necessity of appointing a successor.</li>
<li>The Blessed Lord, on hearing what Chunda had said, replied,
&ldquo;But consider, Chunda, where a teacher hath arisen in the world,
Arahat, supremely enlightened; where a doctrine hath been well set
forth, well imparted, effectual for guidance, conducive to peace; but
where his disciples have not become proficient in good Norm, nor has
it been made a thing of saving grace to them, well proclaimed among
men when their teacher passes away.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Now for such a teacher to die, Chunda, is a great affliction
for his disciples, and a great danger to his Dhamma.</li>
<li>&ldquo;But consider, Chunda, where a teacher has appeared in the
world who is all-enlightened; where the Norm has been well set forth,
well imparted, effectual for guidance, conducive to peace; and where
the disciples have become proficient in the good Norm, and where the
full scope of the higher life has become manifest to them when that
teacher passes away.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Now for such a teacher, Chunda, to die, is not an affliction
for his disciples. Why then have a successor?&rdquo;</li>
<li>When Ananda raised the same question on another occasion, the
Blessed Lord said, &ldquo;What think you, Ananda? Do you observe even a
couple of almsmen at variance about what I have taught?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;No. But those who are about the Lord might, after his death,
stir up quarrel in the confraternity respecting the regimen or of the
code, and such quarrels would make for general grief.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Of little concern, Ananda, are quarrels respecting rigours of
regimen or of the code; it is possible quarrels in the confraternity
about the path which really matter,&rdquo; said the Blessed Lord.</li>
<li>&ldquo;These disputes about the path cannot be settled by a
dictator. What then a successor can do, unless he acts as a
dictator?</li>
<li>&ldquo;The controversies regarding the path cannot be settled by a
dictator.</li>
<li>&ldquo;The decision of a controversy should be reached by the
fraternity. The whole conjoint body should assemble and thrash out the
matter till there is agreement, and then to settle it conformably with
such agreement.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Majority agreements is the way to settle the disputes, and
not the appointment of a successor.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 2. The Last Convert</p>
<ol>
<li>Now at that time Subhadda the Wanderer was staying at Kusinara.
And Subhadda the Wanderer heard the rumour, &ldquo;This very day, it is
said, in the last watch of the night, will be the final passing away
of Gautama the recluse.&rdquo; Then this thought came to Subhadda the
Wanderer:</li>
<li>&ldquo;Thus have I heard it said by other wanderers who are old and
far gone in years, both teachers and disciples, &lsquo;Rarely, rarely do
Tathagatas arise in the world, they who are Arahats, fully Enlightened
Ones. And here tonight, in the last watch, will be the final passing
away of Gautama, the recluse. Now a doubt has arisen in my mind and I
am assured of Gautama, the recluse. Gautama, the recluse, can show me
a teaching, so that I may dispel this doubting state of mine.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Then Subhadda the Wanderer went towards the branch road to the
Sala grove of the Mallas, where the venerable Ananda was, and coming
there he told the venerable Ananda what he had thought, and he
exclaimed, &ldquo;O Master Ananda! If only I could get a sight of Gautama
the recluse!&rdquo;</li>
<li>At these words the venerable Ananda said to Subhadda the
Wanderer, &ldquo;Enough, friend Subhadda! Trouble not the Master! The
Exalted One is wearied.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Then a second and yet a third time did Subhadda the Wanderer
make the same request, and got the same reply.</li>
<li>Now the Exalted One overheard this talk between the venerable
Ananda and Subhadda the Wanderer. And he called to the venerable
Ananda, saying, &ldquo;Enough, Ananda! Prevent not Subhadda. Let Subhadda be
permitted to see the Tathagata. Whatsoever Subhadda shall ask of me,
he will ask it all from a desire to know, not from a desire to trouble
me. And whatever I shall say in answer, that will be quickly
understood.&rdquo;</li>
<li>So then the venerable Ananda said to Subhadda the Wanderer, &ldquo;Go
you in, friend Subhadda. The Exalted One gives you leave.&rdquo;</li>
<li>So Subhadda the Wanderer went in to the Exalted One, and coming
to Him greeted Him pleasantly, and after the exchange of friendly
compliments he sat down at one side. So seated, Subhadda the Wanderer
thus addressed the Exalted One:</li>
<li>&ldquo;Master Gautama, all those recluses and Brahmins who have
followings and companies of listeners, who are teachers of companies,
well known, renowned founders of sects, esteemed as holy men by the
multitude, men like Purana Kassapa, Makkhali of the Cow-pen, Ajita of
[the] hairshirt, Kacchayana of the Pakudha tree, Sanjaya, son of
Belatthi, and Nigantha of the Natha clan&ndash;have all these, as they say,
realised by their own knowledge the truth of things; or have they not,
one and all, so realised; or have some realised and others not
realised it, by their own knowledge?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Let be, Subhadda! Trouble not yourself about such things, as
to whether one and all or some have realised or not. I will show you
the Norm, Subhadda. Do you listen carefully. Apply your mind. I will
speak.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Even so, Lord,&rdquo; said Subhadda the Wanderer, and gave heed to
the Exalted One. Then the Exalted One said this:</li>
<li>&ldquo;ln whatsoever Norm-discipline, Subhadda, the Ariyan Eightfold
Path is not found, therein also no recluse is found. And in whatsoever
Norm-discipline, Subhadda, the Ariyan Eightfold Path is found, therein
also is found a recluse.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Now in this Norm-discipline (of mine), Subhadda, the Ariyan
Eightfold Path is found. Herein also is found a recluse of these four
degrees. Void of recluses are the other sects of disputants. But if,
Subhadda, in this one, brethren were to live the perfect life, the
world would not be void of arahats.</li>
<li>&ldquo;My age was nine and twenty years when I went forth to seek
the Good.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Now fifty years and more are gone, Subhadda, since I left the
world to range the Norm of Righteousness.&rdquo;</li>
<li>And when he had thus spoken, Subhadda the Wanderer said to the
Exalted One, &ldquo;Most excellent are these words of thy mouth, most
excellent.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Just as if a man were to set up that which is thrown down, or
were to reveal that which is hidden away, or were to point out the
right road to him who has gone astray, or were to bring a lamp into
darkness, so that those who have eyes can see.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Just even so, has the truth been made known to me by the
Exalted One. And I, even I, betake myself to the Exalted One as my
refuge, to the truth, and to the Order.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Whosoever, Subhadda, has formerly been a follower of another
doctrine and thereafter wishes to enter the Order, remains on
probation for the space of four months.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;If that is the rule, I too will remain on probation.&rdquo;</li>
<li>But the Exalted One said, &ldquo;I acknowledge the difference in
persons.&rdquo; So saying, he called the venerable Ananda and told Ananda,
&ldquo;As it is, Ananda, receive Subhadda into the Order.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Even so. Lord,&rdquo; said the venerable Ananda, in assent to the
Exalted One.</li>
<li>And Subhadda the Wanderer said to the venerable Ananda, &ldquo;Great
is your gain, friend Ananda, great is your good fortune, friend
Ananda, in that you all have been sprinkled with the sprinkling of
discipleship in this brotherhood at the hands of the Master
himself.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&quot; The same is true of you, Subhadda,&rdquo; replied Ananda.</li>
<li>So Subhadda the Wanderer was received into the Order under the
orders of the Exalted One. He was the last disciple whom the Exalted
One himself converted.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 3. Last Words</p>
<ol>
<li>Then said the Exalted One to the venerable Ananda,</li>
<li>&quot; It may be, Ananda, that you will say: &lsquo;Gone is the word of
the Master: we have no longer any Master now!&rsquo; But you must not so
regard it, Ananda; for the Norm and discipline taught and enjoyed by
me, they shall be your teachers when I am gone.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Now, Ananda, whereas the brethren have the habit of calling
one another &rsquo; friend&rsquo;&ndash;when I am gone this habit must not be followed.
By an elder brother, Ananda, a brother who is a novice should be
called by his name or clan name or by the word &lsquo;friend&rsquo;; but by a
novice, Ananda, an elder brother should be addressed as &lsquo;Lord&rsquo; or
&lsquo;Your reverence.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Again, Ananda, if the Order so desires, when I am gone, let it
abolish the lesser and minor charges.</li>
<li>&ldquo;You know, Ananda, the brother Channa. How obstinate, perverse
and devoid of the sense of discipline he is.</li>
<li>&ldquo;And to him, Ananda, let the extreme penalty be applied when I
am gone.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;What, Lord, do you mean by &rsquo;the extreme penalty&rsquo;?&rdquo;</li>
<li>The brother Channa, Ananda, whatever he may say, is not to be
spoken to, not to be admonished, not to be instructed by the brethren.
He should be left alone. It might improve him.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren:</li>
<li>&ldquo;It may be, brothers, that in the mind of some one brother
there is doubt or perplexity, either about the Buddha, or about the
Norm, or the Order, or the Path, or the Way to the Path. If it be so,
brothers, do ye ask now. Be not hereafter remorseful at the thought,
&lsquo;Here was our Master face to face with us, and yet we had not the
heart to question the Exalted One, though we were in His very
presence.&rsquo;&rdquo;</li>
<li>At these words the brethren were silent.</li>
<li>Then a second time, and yet a third time did the Exalted One
address the brethren in the same words. And a third time the brethren
were silent.</li>
<li>Then said the Exalted One: &ldquo;May be, brethren, it is out of
respect for the Master that ye ask not. Speak to me, then, as friend
to friend, brethren.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Whereat those brethren were silent.</li>
<li>Then exclaimed the venerable Ananda to the Exalted One:
&ldquo;Strange it is, Lord! A marvel it is, Lord! Thus assured am I, Lord,
of this Order of Brethren. There is not any one brother that has a
single doubt or perplexity as to the Buddha, the Norm, the Order, or
as to the Path, or the Way to the Path.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;You speak out of assurance, Ananda. But in the Tathagata
there is knowledge of the fact. There is not in any one brother a
single doubt or perplexity as to this. Of these five hundred brethren
of mine, Ananda, even he who is the most backward is a stream-winner,
one who is assured from the Downfall, assured of reaching the Supreme
Wisdom.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Then said the Exalted One to the brethren:</li>
<li>&ldquo;Come now, brethren, I do remind ye, &lsquo;Subject to decay are all
compounded things.&rsquo; Do ye abide in heedfulness.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Those were the last words of the Exalted One.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 4. Ananda in Grief</p>
<ol>
<li>As age advanced, the Blessed Lord required a personal attendant
to look after him.</li>
<li>He first chose Nanda. After Nanda he chose Ananda, who served
as his personal attendant till his death.</li>
<li>Ananda was his constant and dearest companion, not merely an
attendant.</li>
<li>When the Blessed One came to Kushinara and rested between the
Sal trees, he saw that his end was coming near, and felt that it was
time he took Ananda into confidence.</li>
<li>So he called Ananda and said, &ldquo;And now this, Ananda: at the
third watch of the night, in the Uppavana of Kushinara. between the
twin Sal trees, the utter passing away of the Tathagata will take
place.&rdquo;</li>
<li>And when he had thus spoken, the venerable Ananda addressed the
Blessed One, and said, &ldquo;Vouchsafe, Lord, to remain during the Kalpa, O
Blessed One, for the good and the happiness of the great multitudes,
out of pity for the world, for the good and the gain and the weal of
gods and men.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Three times did Ananda make his plea. &ldquo;Enough now, Ananda,
beseech not the Tathagata!&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;The time for making such
request is past.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&quot; I, Ananda, am now grown old, and full of years, my journey is
drawing to a close. I have reached my sum of days. I am turning eighty
years of age; and just as a worn-out cart must give way some day,
methinks the same must happen to the body of the Tathagata.&rdquo; Hearing
this, Ananda left.</li>
<li>Not seeing Ananda, the Blessed One called the brethren, and
said: &ldquo;Where then is Ananda?&rdquo; &ldquo;The venerable Ananda is gone and is
weeping,&rdquo; said the brethren.</li>
<li>And the Blessed One called a certain brother and said, &ldquo;Go now
brother, and call Ananda in my name, and say, &lsquo;Brother Ananda, the
Master calls for thee.&rsquo;&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Even so, Lord!&rdquo; said that brother.</li>
<li>When Ananda came back, he took his seat by the side of the
Blessed One.</li>
<li>Then the Blessed One said to Ananda, &ldquo;Enough, Ananda! Do not
weep! Have I not already, on former occasions, told you that it is in
the very nature of things most near and dear unto us that we must
divide ourselves from them, leave them, sever ourselves from them?</li>
<li>&quot; For a long time, Ananda, you have been very near to me by
acts of love, kind and good, beyond all measure.</li>
<li>&ldquo;You have done well, Ananda! Be earnest in effort, and you too
shall be free from the great evils&ndash;from sensuality, from
individuality, from delusion, and from ignorance.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Then addressing the brethren about Ananda, the Blessed One
said: &ldquo;He is a wise man, brethren, is Ananda.</li>
<li>&ldquo;He knows when it is the right time to come and visit the
Tathagata, and when it is the right time for brethren and sisters of
the Order, for devout men and devout women, for a king, or for a
king&rsquo;s ministers, for other teachers and disciples, to visit the
Tathagata.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Brethren, there are these four special things about Ananda.</li>
<li>&ldquo;All are happy to visit Ananda. They are filled with joy on
beholding him; they are happy to hear him. They are ill at ease when
Ananda is silent.&rdquo;</li>
<li>After this Ananda again returned to the subject of the passing
away of the Tathagata. Addressing the Blessed One, he said, &ldquo;Let not
the Blessed One die in this wattled and daub town in the midst of the
jungle. For, Lord, there are great cities, such as Champa, Rajagraha,
Savathi, Saketa, Kosambi, and Benares. Let the Blessed One die in one
of them. &quot;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Say not so, Ananda! Say not so, Ananda. This Kushinara,
Ananda, was the capital of king Maha-Sudassana, under the name of
Keshavati.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Thereafter the Blessed One gave Ananda two errands.</li>
<li>He told Ananda to see that belief does not spread that the
Blessed One died as a result of the food given to Him by Chunda. He
feared that Chunda might suffer. He asked Ananda to disabuse the mind
of the public on this score.</li>
<li>The second thing he told Ananda was to inform the Mallas of
Kushinara that the Blessed One had arrived there, and would pass away
in the last watch of the night.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Give no occasion to reproach yourself. The Mallas may say:
&lsquo;In our own village the death of our Tathagata took place; and we did
not know, and had no opportunity of seeing him in his last hours.&rsquo;&rdquo;</li>
<li>Thereafter the venerable Anurudha and the venerable Ananda
spent the rest of the night in religious discourse.</li>
<li>And in the third part of the night, as previously announced,
the Blessed One breathed his last.</li>
<li>When the Blessed One died, the brethren and Ananda stretched
out their arms and wept, and some even fell headlong on the ground,
rolling to and fro in anguish, saying: &ldquo;Too soon has the Blessed One
died! Too soon has the Happy One passed away from existence! Too soon
has the Light gone out of the world!&rdquo;</li>
<li>It was at midnight on Vaishakha Paurnima that the Blessed Lord
breathed his last. The year of his death was 483 B.C.</li>
<li>As the Pali text truly says:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Diva tapati addicco</em><br>
<em>Ratin abhati candima;</em><br>
<em>Sannaddho khathio tapati</em><br>
<em>Jhayi tapati brahaman;</em><br>
<em>Atha Sabbain ahorattain</em><br>
<em>Buddho tapati tejasa.</em></p></blockquote></blockquote>
<ol start="31">
<li>&ldquo;The sun shines only in the day, and the moon makes bright the
night. The warrior shines when he is in his armour. And the Brahmin
when he is meditating. But the Buddha shines over all, by day as well
as by night, by his own glory.</li>
<li>&ldquo;He was beyond question the light of the world.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 5. The Lament of the Mallas and the Joy of a Bhikkhu</p>
<ol>
<li>As desired by the Blessed One, Ananda went and informed the
Mallas of the event.</li>
<li>And when they heard of this, the Mallas, their wives, their
young men and maidens, were grieved and sad and afflicted at heart.</li>
<li>Some of them wept, dishevelling their hair, and stretched forth
their arms and fell prostrate on the ground.</li>
<li>Then the Mallas, with their young men and maidens and their
wives, went to the Sala grove in the Upavaana to have the last look of
the Blessed One.</li>
<li>Then the venerable Ananda thought: &ldquo;lf I allow the Mallas of
Kushinara one by one, it will take a long time for them to pay homage
to the dead body of the Blessed One.&rdquo;</li>
<li>So he decided to arrange them in groups, family by family. Each
family then bowed humbly at the feet of the Blessed One and parted.</li>
<li>Now at the time the venerable Maha Kassapa was journeying along
the high road from Pava to Kushinara with a great company of the
brethren.</li>
<li>Just at the time a certain naked ascetic was coming along the
high road to Pava.</li>
<li>And the venerable Maha Kassapa saw the naked ascetic coming in
the distance; and when he had seen him he said to the naked ascetic,
&ldquo;O friend! Surely thou knowest our Master?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Yes, friend! I know him. This day the Samana Gautama has been
dead a week!&rdquo;</li>
<li>Immediately on hearing the news the brethren were overcome
with grief, and started weeping.</li>
<li>Now at that time a brother named Subhadda, who had been
received into the Sangh in his old age, was seated in their company.</li>
<li>And this Subhadda addressed the brethren and said: &ldquo;Enough
brethren! Weep not, neither lament! We are well rid of the great
Samana. We used to be annoyed by being told, &lsquo;This beseems you, this
beseems you not.&rsquo; But now we shall be able to do whatever we like; and
what we do not like, that we shall not have to do! Isn&rsquo;t it good he is
dead? Why weep, why lament? It is a matter of joy.&rdquo;</li>
<li>So great and harsh a disciplinarian the Blessed One was.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 6. The Last Rites</p>
<p>1. Then the Mallas of Kushinara said to the venerable Ananda: &ldquo;What
should be done with the remains of the Tathagata?&rdquo;<br>
2. &ldquo;As men treat the remains of a king of kings, so should you
treat the remains of the Tathagata&rdquo; replied Ananda.<br>
3. &ldquo;And how do they treat the remains of a king of kings?&rdquo;<br>
4. Ananda told them: &ldquo;They wrap the body of a king of kings in a
new cloth. When that is done they wrap it in cotton-wool. When that is
done they wrap it in a new cloth and so on till they have wrapped the
body in five hundred successive layers of both kinds. Then they place
the body in an oil vessel of iron and cover that close up with another
oil vessel of iron. They then build a funeral pile of all kinds. This
is the way in which they treat the remains of a king of kings.&rdquo;<br>
5. &ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; said the Mallas.<br>
6. Then the Mallas of Kushinara said: &quot; It is much too late to
burn the body of the Blessed One today. Let us now perform the
cremation tomorrow.&rdquo;<br>
7. And the Mallas of Kushinara gave orders to their attendants,
saying: &ldquo;Make preparations for the funeral of the Tathagata, and
gather perfumes and garlands and the musicians of Kushinara.&rdquo;<br>
8. But in paying honour, reverence, respect, and homage to the
remains of the Tathagata with dancing, and hymns and music, and with
garlands and perfumes; and in making canopies of their garments, and
preparing decoration wreaths to hang thereon, they passed the second
day too, and then the third day, and the fourth and fifth and the
sixth day also.<br>
9. Then on the seventh day the Mallas of Kushinara thought: &ldquo;Let
us carry the body of the Blessed One, and let us perform the cremation
ceremony.&rdquo;<br>
10. And thereupon eight chieftains among the Mallas bathed their
heads, and clad themselves in new garments, with the intention of
acting as pall-bearers carrying the body of the Blessed One.<br>
11. They carried the dead body to the Shrine of the Mallas, called
Makuta-bandhana; to the east of the city, and there they laid down the
body of the Blessed One and set fire to it.<br>
12. After some time the mortal remains of the Blessed One were
reduced to ashes.</p>
<p>§ 7. Quarrel Over Ashes</p>
<ol>
<li>After the body of the Blessed One had been consumed by fire,
the Mallas of Kushinara collected the ashes and the bones of the
Blessed One, and placed them in their Council Hall with a lattice work
of spears and with a rampart of bows; and guarded them against anybody
stealing them or any part of them.</li>
<li>For seven days the Mallas paid honour and reverence and respect
and homage to them with dance and song and music and with garlands and
perfumes.</li>
<li>Now the King of Magadha, Ajatasatru, heard the news that the
Blessed One had died at Kushinara.</li>
<li>He, therefore, sent a messenger to the Mallas with a request
for a portion of the relics of the Blessed One.</li>
<li>Similarly messengers came from the Licchavis of Vaishali, from
the Sakyas of Kapilavastu, from the Bulis of Attakappa, from the
Koliyas of Ramagama, and from the Mallas of Pava.</li>
<li>Among the claimants for ashes there was also a Brahmin of
Vethadipa.</li>
<li>When they heard these claims, the Mallas of Kushinara said: &quot;
The Blessed One died in our village. We will not give away any part of
the remains of the Blessed One. They belong to us.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Seeing that the situation was tense, a Brahmin, by name Dron,a
intervened and said: &ldquo;Hear, reverend sirs, one single word from me.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Said Drona: &ldquo;Forbearance was our Buddha to teach; unseemly is
it that over the division of the remains of him who was the best of
beings, strife should arise, and wounds, and war!</li>
<li>&ldquo;Let us all, sirs, with one accord unite in friendly harmony,
to make eight portions. Widespread let stupas arise in every land,
that the Enlightened One from all parts be reverenced.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The Mallas of Kushinara agreed and said: &ldquo;Do thou then, O
Brahmin, thyself divide the remains equally into eight parts, with
fair division.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Be it so, sir!&rdquo; said Drona in assent.</li>
<li>And he divided the remains of the Blessed One equally into
eight parts.</li>
<li>After making the division, Drona said to them: &ldquo;Give me, sirs,
this vessel. I will set up over it a stupa.&rdquo;</li>
<li>And they agreed to give the vessel to him.</li>
<li>Thus the ashes of the Blessed One were shared, and the quarrel
was settled peacefully and amicably.</li>
</ol>
<p>§8. Loyalty to the Buddha</p>
<ol>
<li>Shravasti was the occasion [=location] (of these
events)&hellip;.</li>
<li>Now on that occasion a number of monks were busied with .making
a robe for the Exalted One, with this idea: When the robe is finished,
in three months&rsquo; time, the Exalted One will go forth on his rounds:</li>
<li>Now at that time Isidatta and Purana, the chamberlains, were
staying at Sadhuka on some business or other. Then they heard the
news: &ldquo;They say that a number of monks are busied with making a robe
for the Exalted One with this idea: When the robe is finished, in
three months&rsquo; time, the Exalted One will go forth upon his rounds.&rdquo;</li>
<li>So Isidatta and Purana, the chamberlains, stationed a man on
the high-road (thus instructing him): &ldquo;Now, good fellow, as soon as
you see that Exalted One, that Arahat, that perfectly Enlightened One
coming along, do you come and inform us.&rdquo;</li>
<li>So after standing there two or three days that man saw the
Exalted One coming along, while yet some distance off, and he went to
inform the chamberlains, Isidatta and Purana, saying: &ldquo;Here comes my
lord, the Exalted One, that Arahat, that perfectly Enlightened One!
Now&rsquo;s the time for you to do what you want!&rdquo;</li>
<li>So Isidatta and Purana, the chamberlains, went towards the
Exalted One, and on coming to him, saluted him, and followed behind
the Exalted One step for step.</li>
<li>Then the Exalted One turned aside from the high road, and went
to the foot of a certain tree, and there sat down on a seat made
ready. And Isidatta and Purana, the chamberlains, saluting the Exalted
One, also sat down at one side. As they thus sat, they said this to
the Exalted One:</li>
<li>&ldquo;Lord, when we heard of the Exalted One that he would go forth
on his rounds among the Kosalans, at that time we were disappointed
and depressed at the thought: the Exalted One will be far from us.</li>
<li>&ldquo;And when, Lord, we learned that the Exalted One was starting
out from Shravasti on his rounds among the Kosalans, again we were
disappointed and depressed at the thought: The Exalted One will be far
from us.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Again, lord, when we learned that the Exalted One would leave
the Kosalans and go on his rounds among the Mallas&hellip; that he was
actually doing so&hellip;we were disappointed and depressed.</li>
<li>&ldquo;On hearing that the Exalted One would leave the Mallas and go
on his rounds among the Vajji&hellip;that he was actually doing so&hellip;that
he would leave the Vajji for Kasi&hellip;that he was doing so&hellip;hat he
would leave the folk of Kasi and go on his rounds in Magadha&hellip;hat he
was actually doing so&hellip;again we were disappointed and depressed&hellip;.</li>
<li>&ldquo;But, Lord, when we heard that the Exalted One would leave the
Magadhas for Kasi and was doing so, then we were delighted and elated
at the thought: The Exalted One will be quite near us.</li>
<li>&ldquo;And when we heard that he was actually going his rounds in
Kasi among the Magadhas, we were likewise delighted and elated.</li>
<li>(They continue to trace the Master&rsquo;s steps from Kasi to the
Vajji&hellip;from the Vajji to the Mallas&hellip;from the Mallas to the
Kosalans, in like terms.)</li>
<li>&quot; But, Lord, when we heard that the Exalted One would be going
on his rounds from the Kosalans to Savatthi, we were delighted and
elated at the thought: Now the Exalted One will be quite near us!</li>
<li>&ldquo;Then, when we heard: &lsquo;The Exalted One is staying at
Shravasti, at Jeta grove, in Anathapindika&rsquo;s Park&rsquo;&ndash;then, Lord,
boundless was our delight and boundless our elation at the thought:
The Exalted One is near us!&rdquo;</li>
