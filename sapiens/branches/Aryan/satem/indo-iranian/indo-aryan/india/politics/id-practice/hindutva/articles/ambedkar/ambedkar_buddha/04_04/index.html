<p>SECTION ONE&ndash;SERMONS FOR HOUSEHOLDERS</p>
<p>§ 1. The Happy Householder</p>
<ol>
<li>Once Anathapindika came to where the Exalted One was, made
obeisance to the Exalted One, and took a seat at one side.</li>
<li>Anathapindika was anxious to know wherein lay the happiness of
a householder.</li>
<li>Accordingly Anathapindika asked the Lord to explain to him the
secret of the householder&rsquo;s happiness.</li>
<li>The Lord said, first is the happiness of possession. A
householder is possessed of wealth, justly and righteously acquired by
great industry, amassed by strength of the arm, and earned by sweat
(of the brow). At the thought &ldquo;I am possessed of wealth justly gained&rdquo;
he gains happiness.</li>
<li>Second is the happiness of enjoyment. A householder is
possessed of wealth justly and righteously acquired by great industry
amassed by strength of the arm, and earned by sweat (of the brow),
enjoys his wealth, and performs acts of merit. Thus at the thought &ldquo;I
am doing meritorious deeds with my wealth which was justly gained&rdquo; and
so forth, he gains happiness.</li>
<li>Third is the happiness of freedom from debt. A householder owes
no one any debt great or small, thus he gains happiness; thus he at
the thought of &ldquo;I owe no man anything&rdquo; and so forth, gains
happiness.</li>
<li>Fourth is the happiness of blamelessness. A householder who is
endowed with blameless action of body, blameless speech, and blameless
thinking, gains happiness of blamelessness.</li>
<li>Verily, Anathapindika, these four kinds of happiness are
constantly obtainable by the householder, if he strives for them.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 2. [A] Daughter may be better than a Son</p>
<ol>
<li>When the Exalted One was once at Shravasti, the king of the
Kosalas, Pasendi, had come to visit him.</li>
<li>While the king was engaged in a conversation with the Blessed
Lord, a messenger from the Palace arrived and, approaching the king,
announced to his private ear that Queen Mallika had given birth to a
daughter.</li>
<li>The king appeared very sad and depressed. The Blessed Lord
asked the king the reason of his sadness.</li>
<li>The king replied that he had just received the sad news that
Queen Mallika had given birth to a daughter.</li>
<li>Thereupon the Exalted One, discerning the matter said: &ldquo;A woman
child, O lord of men, may prove even a better offspring than a male.
For she may grow up wise and virtuous, her husband&rsquo;s mother
reverencing true wife, a daughter.</li>
<li>The boy that she may bear may do great deeds and rule great
realms; yea, such a son of a noble wife becomes his country&rsquo;s guide.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 3. Husband and Wife</p>
<ol>
<li>At one time, the Exalted One had entered the high road between
Madhura and Neranja. Also many householders and their wives had joined
the high road between Madhura and Neranja.</li>
<li>Then the Exalted One, having left the road, took a seat under a
certain tree, and these householders and their wives saw the Exalted
One seated under it.</li>
<li>So seeing, they came to where the Exalted One was. Having come,
they made obeisance to the Exalted One and sat at one side, and asked
the Blessed One the right relations between the husband and wife. To
the householders and their wives so seated, the Exalted One spake
thus:</li>
<li>&ldquo;Householders, there are four ways for a husband and wife, of
living together. A vile man lives with a vile woman, a vile man lives
with a goddess, a god lives with a vile woman and a god lives with a
goddess.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Householders! A husband kills, steals, commits impurity, lies
and indulges in fermented liquor; is wicked and sinful; with his heart
possessed by avarice he lives the life of a householder, and abuses
and reviles virtuous people. Also his wife kills, steals, commits
impurity, lies, and indulges in fermented liquor; is wicked and
sinful; with her heart possessed by avarice, she lives the life of the
family, and abuses and reviles virtuous people. Thus indeed,
householders, a vile man lives with a vile woman.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Householders! A husband kills, steals, commits impurity, lies
and indulges in fermented liquor; is wicked and sinful; with his heart
possessed by avarice, he lives the life of a householder, and abuses
and reviles virtuous people. But his wife abstains from killing,
thieving, sexual impurity, lying, and indulgence in fermented liquor.
His wife is virtuous and of good behaviour; with her heart freed from
the taint of avarice she lives the family life, and abuses not, nor
reviles, virtuous people. Thus indeed, house-holders, a vile man lives
with a goddess.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Householders! A husband abstains from killing, thieving,
impurity, lying and indulgence in fermented liquor; is virtuous and of
good behaviour; with his mind freed from the stains of avarice, he
lives the family life and abuses not, nor reviles, virtuous people.
But his wife kills, steals, commits impurity, lies and indulges in
fermented liquor, is wicked and sinful; with her heart possessed by
avarice she lives the family life, and abuses and reviles virtuous
people. Thus indeed, householders, a god lives with a vile woman.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Householders! Herein, a husband and a wife both abstain from
killing, thieving, impurity, lying, and indulgence in fermented
liquor; are virtuous and of good behaviour; with mind freed from
taints of avarice they live the family life and abuse not, nor revile,
virtuous people. Thus indeed, householders, a god lives with a
goddess.</li>
<li>&ldquo;These, householders, are the four ways of living together.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>SECTION TWO&ndash;SERMONS ON THE NEED FOR MAINTAINING CHARACTER</p>
<p>§ 1. What Constitutes the Downfall of Man</p>
<ol>
<li>On one occasion, the Blessed One was dwelling in the monastery
of Anathapindika, in the Jeta Grove, near Shravasti.</li>
<li>Now when the night was far spent, a certain Deva, whose
splendour illuminated the whole Jeta Grove, came to the presence of
the Blessed One and, drawing near, respectfully saluted him and stood
at one side. Standing thus, he addressed the Blessed One in verse:</li>
<li>&ldquo;Having come to interrogate the Blessed One, I ask thee, O
Gautama, about the falling man. Pray, tell me the cause of one&rsquo;s
downfall.&rdquo; The Blessed One consented to explain the causes of man&rsquo;s
downfall.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Easily known is the progressive one, easily known is the
declining one. A lover of the Dhamma is the progressive one, a hater
of the Dhamma is the declining one.</li>
<li>&ldquo;The vicious are dear to him, in the virtuous he finds nothing
pleasing; he favours the creeds of the vicious&ndash;this is the second
cause of one&rsquo;s downfall.</li>
<li>&ldquo;The man who is drowsy, fond of society, not industrious,
indolent, and who manifests anger&ndash;this is the third cause of one&rsquo;s
downfall.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Whosoever, being rich, does. not support his aged mother and
father, who have passed their youth&ndash;this is the fourth cause of one&rsquo;s
downfall.</li>
<li>&ldquo;He who, by falsehood, deceives a Brahmana or an ascetic or any
other medicant&ndash;this is the fifth cause of one&rsquo;s downfall.</li>
<li>&ldquo;The man who owns much property, who has gold and food, but
alone enjoys his delicacies&ndash;this is the sixth cause of one&rsquo;s
downfall.</li>
<li>&ldquo;The man who prides [=takes pride] in birth or wealth or
clan, and despises his own kinsmen&ndash;this is the seventh cause of one&rsquo;s
downfall.</li>
<li>&ldquo;The man who is a debauchee, [a] drunkard, a gambler, who
squanders whatever he possesses&ndash;this is the eighth cause of one&rsquo;s
downfall.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Not contented with one&rsquo;s own wives, if one is seen amongst
courtesans and the wives of others&ndash;this is the ninth cause of one&rsquo;s
downfall.</li>
<li>&ldquo;He who places in authority an intemperate spend-thrift woman,
or a man of similar nature&ndash;this is the eleventh cause of one&rsquo;s
downfall.</li>
<li>&ldquo;He who, of slender means but vast ambition, of warrior birth,
aspires to sovereignty&ndash;this is the twelfth cause of one&rsquo;s downfall.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Know these causes of downfall, ye noble Deva, and if ye
succeed in overcoming them ye will be saved.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>§2. The Wicked Man</p>
<ol>
<li>The Blessed Lord, while he was on [a] journey, gave, as was
his usual practice, the following discourse to the Bhikkhus who were
accompanying him.</li>
<li>Addressing the Bhikkhus, the Lord said: &ldquo;Do you know how to
recognise a wicked man?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, Lord,&rdquo; replied the Bhikkhus.</li>
<li>&ldquo;I will tell you the characteristics of a wicked man.</li>
<li>&ldquo;There is a man who shows up the faults of another even when
unasked, not to say [=not to speak of] when asked. Being indeed
asked and plied with questions, he speaks ill of another without
suppressing or concealing, but with full details. Brethren, such a man
is a wicked man.</li>
<li>&ldquo;There is a man who, being asked, does not point out the good
qualities of another, not to say [=not to speak of] when unasked.
Being indeed asked and plied with questions, he speaks well of
another.</li>
<li>&ldquo;There is a man who, being asked, does not disclose his own bad
qualities, not to say [=not to speak of] when unasked. Being indeed
asked and plied with questions, he points out his own bad qualities,
but suppresses and conceals them and does not give full details.
Brethren, such a man is a wicked man.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Then again, brethren, there is a man who, even unasked,
discloses his good qualities, not to say [=not to speak of] when
asked. Brethren, being asked and plied with questions, be points out
his own good qualities without suppressing or concealing them and
giving full details. Brethren, such a man is a wicked man.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 3. The Best Man</p>
<ol>
<li>The Blessed One, while he was on journey, gave, as was his
practice, the following discourse to the Bhikkhus who were
accompanying him:</li>
<li>Addressing the Bhikkhus, the Lord said: &ldquo;There are four classes
of persons, brethren, to be found in the world.</li>
<li>&ldquo;He who has not striven for his own welfare, nor that of
others; he who has striven for others&rsquo; welfare, but not his own; he
who has striven for his own welfare, but not others&rsquo;; he who has
striven for both his own welfare, and that of others.</li>
<li>&ldquo;One who has striven neither for his own welfare nor for that
of others is like a torch from a funeral pyre, lit at both ends, and
in the middle smeared with dung. He kindles no fuel either in village
or in forest. He is useless to the world. And he is useless to
himself.</li>
<li>&ldquo;One who has striven for the welfare of others at the cost of
his own, is both excellent and eminent of the two.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Then again, brethren, in the case of the person who has
striven both for his own welfare and for that of others&ndash;of these four
persons this is best and chief, topmost and highest and supreme.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 4. The Enlightened Man</p>
<ol>
<li>At one time, the Exalted One had reached the high road between
(the two towns of) Ukkattha and Setabbya. Then the Brahmin named Dona
had also reached the high road between Ukkattha and Setabbya.</li>
<li>Just then the Exalted One left the road and sat down at the
foot of a tree, cross-legged. Then Dona the Brahman, following the
footsteps of the Exalted One, saw him seated at the foot of that tree,
resplendent and of a comely ppearance, with sense controlled, with
mind appeased, supremely tamed, restrained and powerful. So seeing, he
approached where the Exalted One was.</li>
<li>Having come he said thus to him:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Is not the Venerable One a Deva?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Brahman, I am indeed not a Deva.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Is not the Venerable One then a Gandhabba?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Brahman, I am indeed not a Gandhabba.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Is not the Venerable One then a Yakkha?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Brahman, I am indeed not a Yakkha.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Is not the Venerable One then a man?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Brahman, I am indeed not a man.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>Having heard the Blessed One reply thus, the Brahman Dona said:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;When thou art asked: Are ye a Deva? Thou sayest: No.<br>
When Thou art questioned: Are ye a Gandhabba? Thou sayest: No.<br>
When Thou art asked: Are ye a Yakkha? Thou sayest: No.<br>
When Thou art questioned: Are ye then a man? Thou sayest: No.<br>
Who then can the Venerable One be?&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<ol start="5">
<li>&ldquo;Brahman, verily I was a Deva, a Gandhabba, Yakkha, a man, so
long as I had not purged myself of the intoxicants. These very
intoxicants have I now given up&ndash;with roots cut out like unto a
palm-tree with its base destroyed and rendered unable to sprout
again&ndash;so that in future they do not come into existence.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Just as a lotus or a water-lily born of the water, grown in
the water, risen out of the water, stands unstained by the water, even
so, Brahman, being born of the world, grown in the world, having
overcome the world, I abide unstained by the world.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Therefore, 0 Brahman, consider me as the Enlightened One.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>§5. Man—Just and Good</p>
<ol>
<li>Addressing the Brethren, the Lord said, &ldquo;There are four classes
of persons whom you must learn to distinguish, if you wish to
ascertain who are good and just.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Brethren, there is a class of persons who strive for their own
welfare, but not that of others.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Brethren, herein a certain person practises the extirpation of
lust in himself, but does not urge the extirpation of lust in others;
practises the extirpation of ill-will in himself, but does not urge
the extirpation of ill-will in others; and also practises the
extirpation of ignorance in himself, but does not urge the extirpation
of ignorance in others.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Indeed, Brethren, this is the person who pursues his own
welfare, but not the welfare of others.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Brethren, there is a class of persons who have striven for
others&rsquo; welfare, but not their own.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Brethren, herein a certain person does not practise the
extirpation of lust, ill-will, and ignorance in himself, but urges the
extirpation of lust, ill-will, and ignorance in others.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Indeed, Brethren, this is the person who has. striven for
others&rsquo; welfare, but not his own.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Brethren, there is a class of persons who strive not, neither
for their own welfare nor that of others.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Brethren, herein a certain person practises not the
extirpation of lust, ill-will, and ignorance in himself, nor urges the
extirpation of lust, ill-will, and ignorance in others.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Brethren, this is the person that has not striven for his own
welfare nor that of others.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Brethren, there is a class of persons who strive for their
own welfare as well as that of others.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Brethren, herein a certain person both practises the
extirpation of lust, ill-will, and ignorance in himself, and also
urges the extirpation of lust, ill-will, and ignorance in others.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Brethren, this is the person who has striven for his own
welfare as well as that of others.</li>
<li>&ldquo;This last person is to be deemed just and good.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 6. Need for Doing Good Deeds</p>
<ol>
<li>On one occasion, thus spake the Exalted One to the Brethren.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Be not afraid of good works, brethren. It is another name for
happiness, for what is desired, beloved, dear, and delightful, this
word &lsquo;good works&rsquo;. I myself, brethren, can bear witness to having
reaped for many a long day the profit of good works, a thing desired,
beloved, dear, and delightful.</li>
<li>&ldquo;I often ask &lsquo;Of what deeds is all this the fruit? Of what deed
is it the ripening, in that I am now thus happy and contented?&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The answer that comes to me is: &lsquo;Of three deeds this is the
fruit. Of three deeds this is the ripening, the deeds of Charity,
Self-taming, and Self-control.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Auspicious, festive, happy, blessed dawn! Fair day, glad time
is that when alms are given to worthy ones; when goodly acts, words,
thoughts, right aspirations, bring auspicious gain to those that
practise them.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Happy are they that win such gain, and prosperous in the way!
So be ye also prosperous in the way, free from disease and happy with
your kin.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 7. Need for Making Good Resolutions</p>
<ol>
<li>Once when he was at Shravasti in Jeta&rsquo;s Grove, the Exalted One
said to the Brethren:</li>
<li>&ldquo;Brethren, there is a great need of good resolutions to be made
and observed for a pure and happy life.</li>
<li>&ldquo;I will tell you what your resolutions should be.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Resolve that, &lsquo;all my life long may I support my parents. May
I respect the head of my clan. May I be of gentle speech. May I speak
evil of none. Clearing my heart of the stain of selfishness, may I
dwell at home generous, pure-handed, delighting in giving up, may I be
a proper man to ask a boon of, delighting in sharing gifts with
others.</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;All my life long, may I be angerless, and, if anger arise,
may I quickly check it.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Such are the seven resolutions, Brethren, by undertaking and
performing which you will attain the state of happiness and purity.</li>
</ol>
<p>SECTION THREE&ndash;SERMONS ON RIGHTEOUSNESS</p>
<p>§1 What is Righteousness</p>
<ol>
<li>Once when the Lord was on an alms-pilgrimage in Kosala, with a
great train of almsmen, he came to a Brahmin village of the Kosalans
named Sala.</li>
<li>It came to the ears of the Brahmin heads of families in Sala
that the Blessed Lord had come to their village in the course of an
alms-pilgrimage in Kosala.</li>
<li>They felt it was good to go and visit him. So the Brahmins of
Sala went to the Lord and, after exchanging civil greetings, took
their seats on one side.</li>
<li>They asked the Blessed One if he would explain to them what he
meant by righteousness.</li>
<li>So to the attentive Brahmins the Lord said: &ldquo;There are three
forms of unrighteousness and wickedness for the body; four for speech;
and three for thoughts.</li>
<li>&ldquo;As regards bodily unrighteousness, a man (i) may take life, as
a hunter with hands bathed in blood, given to killing and slaying,
merciless to living creatures; or (ii) may take what is not his, by
appropriating to himself in thievish fashion the belongings of other
people in village and jungle; or (iii) may be a fornicator, having
intercourse with girls under the charge of mother or father or brother
or sister or relations&ndash;yes, with girls affianced and plighted and
even wearing the very garlands of betrothal.</li>
<li>&ldquo;As regards unrighteousness of speech a man (i) may be a liar;
when cited to give testimony before assembly or village-meeting or
family council or royal household or his guild, he may say that he
knows when he does not know, or that he does not know when he does
know, or that he saw when he did not see, or that he did not see when
he did see, deliberately lying in the interests either of himself or
of other people or for some trifling gain. Or (ii) he may be a
slanderer; repeating here what he has heard elsewhere so as to set one
set of people by the ears, and repeating elsewhere what he has heard
here so as to set another set of people by the ears; he is a dissolver
of harmony and a fomenter of strife; discord prompts his utterances,
discord being his pleasure, his joy, and his delight. Or (iii) he may
be bitter of tongue; what he says is rough and harsh, hurtful and
wounding to others, provocative of anger, and leading to distraction.
Or (iv) he may be a tattler talking out of season, without heed to
fact, always talking of the unprofitable, never of the Doctrine, never
of the Rule, but ever of the trivial, of the ill-timed, of the
frivolous, of things leading nowhere and unprofitable.</li>
<li>&ldquo;As regards unrighteousness of thought, a man (i) may be
covetous, coveting other people&rsquo;s gear with the yearning that it were
all his own. Or (ii) he may be malevolent and wicked of heart, wishing
that creatures around him might be killed, destroyed, annihilated, or
cease to be. Or (iii) he may be wrong in outlook and erroneous in his
conceptions, holding that there are no such things as alms or
sacrifice or oblations, that there is no such things as the fruit and
harvest of deeds good and bad, that there is no such thing as this
world or any other, that there are no such things as either parents or
relations elsewhere, that there are no such things in the world as
recluses and Brahmins who, having trodden the right path and walked
aright, have, of and by themselves, comprehended and realized this and
other worlds and made it all known to others too.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Contrariwise, there are three forms of righteousness and
goodness for the body; four for speech, and three for thoughts.</li>
<li>&ldquo;As regards bodily righteousness, a man (i) puts from him all
killing and abstains from killing anything; laying aside cudgel and
sword, he lives a life of innocence and mercy, full of kindliness and
compassion for everything that lives. (ii) Theft he puts from him, and
eschews taking from others except what is given to him by them; he
lives an honest life. (iii) Putting from him all sensual misconduct,
he abstains from fornication; he has no intercourse with girls under
the charge of mother or father or brother or sister or relations, no
intercourse with girls affianced and plighted and with the garlands of
betrothal upon them.</li>
<li>&ldquo;As regards righteousness in speech, (i) a man puts lying from
him and abstains from lies; when cited to give testimony before
assembly or village-meeting or family council or royal household or
his guild, he says that he does not know when he does not, and that he
does know when he does, says that he did not see when he did not see
and that he saw when he did see, never deliberately lying in the
interests of himself or of other people or for some trifling gain.
(ii) All slander he puts from him, and from slandering he abstains;
what he hears here he does not repeat elsewhere so to set one set of
people by the ears, nor does he repeat here what he hears elsewhere so
as to set another set of people by the ears; he is a promoter of
harmony and a restorer of amity, for concord is his pleasure, his joy,
and his delight. (iii) There is no bitterness in his tongue, and he
abstains from bitter speech; what he says is without gall, pleasant,
friendly hearty, urbane, agreeable, and welcome to all. (iv) No
tattler, he abstains from tattle, speaking in season, according to
fact, always of the profitable, of the Doctrine and Rule, in speech
which is seasonable and memorable, illuminating, well-marshalled, and
of great profit.</li>
<li>&ldquo;As regards righteousness in thoughts, (i) a man is devoid of
covetousness, never coveting other people&rsquo;s gear with the yearning
that it were all his own. (ii) He harbours no malevolence or
wickedness of thought; his wish is that creatures around him may live
on in peace and happiness, safe from all enmity and oppression. (iii)
He is right in outlook and correct in his conceptions.</li>
<li>&ldquo;This is what I mean by righteousness and unrighteousness.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>§2. Need for Righteousness</p>
<ol>
<li>Then the Exalted One addressed the lay brethren of
Pataligama:</li>
<li>&ldquo;There are losses, householders, which attend the wicked and
immoral man.</li>
<li>&ldquo;The wicked, immoral man, as the result of sloth, comes to
great loss of wealth.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Then again, an evil report prevails about him, which defames
him in the eyes of the world.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Whatever company he may enter, be it a company of the nobles,
or the Brahmins, or the housefathers, or a company of recluses, he
enters shyly and confused in mind. He is not fearless. This is the
third loss.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Again, he has no peace of mind, and is troubled in mind when
he dies. This is the fourth loss.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Such, householders, are the losses that attend the wicked and
immoral man.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Consider the profits which attend the righteous man who lives
virtuously.</li>
<li>&ldquo;The righteous man who lives virtuously comes by a great mass
of wealth, due to his own exertions.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Then again, a good reputation prevails about him. He is
honoured everywhere.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Into whatsoever company he enters, be it of the nobles or the
Brahmins or the housefathers or the recluses, he enters bold and
confident.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Again, he enjoys peace of mind, and makes an end with mind
untroubled.</li>
<li>&ldquo;The fool in doing ill knows not his folly: His own deeds,
like a fire, the fool consume.</li>
<li>He who offends the harmless innocent soon reaches grievous
disaster, or a mind distraught, loss of relations, loss of all his
wealth.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 3. Righteousness and the Claims of the World</p>
<ol>
<li>Once when the Lord was staying at Rajagraha in the Bamboo grove
where the squirrels were fed, the reverend Sariputta was making an
alms pilgrimage with a great train of almsmen among the Southern
Hills.</li>
<li>On his way he met an almsman who had spent the rainy season at
Rajagraha. After interchange of greetings of friendliness and
civility, Sariputta enquired after the Master&rsquo;s health and was told he
was well, as too was the Confraternity, and also the Brahmin
Dhananjani of Tandula-pala Gate in Rajagraha, concerning whose health
too Sariputta had made enquiries.</li>
<li>&ldquo;And is the Brahmin, Dhananjani, zealous and earnest?&rdquo; asked
Sariputta further of the Almsman.</li>
<li>&ldquo;How could earnest zeal possibly dwell in Dhananjani?&rdquo; replied
theAlmsman. &ldquo;He uses the king to fleece the Brahmins and householders,
and uses them to fleece the king. Also, his pious wife, who came of a
pious stock is dead now; and he has taken to himself another wife who
is not pious and comes of no pious stock.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;This is bad news, very bad news, to hear of Dhananjani&rsquo;s lack
of zeal,&rdquo; said Sariputta. &ldquo;Perhaps, however, at some time and place I
may meet him. I should like to have a talk with him.&rdquo;</li>
<li>After staying as. long as he wanted in the Southern Hills,
Sariputta proceeded on his alms pilgrimage till he reached Rajagraha,
where he took up his abode in the Bamboo Grove.</li>
<li>Early in the morning, bowl in hand and duly robed, he went into
Rajagraha for alms, at a time when the Brahmin Dhananjani was out of
the city seeing his cows milked in the byre.</li>
<li>On his return after his round and meal, Sariputta sought out
the Brahmin. Seeing him coming, the Brahmin came to meet him, with the
remark that they had time for a draught of milk before meal-time.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Not so, Brahmin, I have had my meal today, and shall be
resting under the shade of a tree during the noontide. Come to me
there.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Dhananjani agreed, and after his own meal joined Sariputta,
seating himself by him after friendly greetings.</li>
<li>Said Sariputta: &ldquo;May I rest assured, Dhananjani, that zeal and
earnestness and righteousness are yours?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;How can that be, when I have to support my parents, my wife
and family, and my slaves and serving folk, and have to entertain my
cquaintances and friends, my kith and kin, and guests, and have also
to provide for my kinsfolk dead and gone, and for the deities, and for
the king, not to speak of supporting myself in meat and drink?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;What think you, Dhananjani? If we suppose a man who, for his
parents&rsquo; sake, has departed from righteousness and equity, and is
being hauled up [in court], would it avail him either to plead on
his own behalf that it was for his parents&rsquo; sake that he had departed
from righteousness and equity, and that therefore he should not be
hauled up?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;No; despite all appeals, the wardens would cast him into
prison.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Would it avail him either to plead on his own behalf, or to
have his wife and family plead for him, that it was for their sake he
had departed from righteousness and equity?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Would it avail him if his slaves and serving folk pleaded for
him?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Not a whit.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Or if his friends and acquaintances pleaded for him?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Not a whit.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Or if his kith and kin, or his guests, pleaded for him?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Not a whit.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Or if his kinsfolk dead and gone pleaded the claims of his
deities, or his monarch&rsquo;s claims on him?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Not a whit.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Would it avail him to plead on his own behalf, or to have
others pleading for him, that it was to support himself in meat and
drink that he departed from righteousness and equity?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;What think you, Dhananjani? Which is the better man? He that
for the sake of his parents departs from righteousness and equity, or
he that no matter what happens to them walks in righteousness and
equity?</li>
<li>&ldquo;The latter,&rdquo; replied Dhananjani, &ldquo;for to walk in
righteousness and equity is better than to depart therefrom.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Moreover, Dhananjani, there are other courses of action which
are justified and righteous in themselves, whereby he can support his
parents, and yet avoid evildoing and walk uprightly. Now, does the
same reasoning apply to the support of wife and family and everything
else?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;It does, Sariputta.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Hereupon the Brahmin, rejoicing in what the reverend Sariputta
had said, thanked him, rose up and went his way.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 4. How to Reach Perfection in Righteous Conduct</p>
<ol>
<li>Once while the Lord was staying at Shravasti in Jeta&rsquo;s Grove,
there came to him five hundred lay-followers. One of them was
Dhammika.</li>
<li>Dhammika asked the Lord: &ldquo;What principles make your followers
reach perfection in righteous conduct?</li>
<li>&ldquo;I ask thee this question because thou art the most matchless
judge of the weal of men.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Trained Jains and Mendicants all failed to vanquish thee.
Trained Brahmins, ripe in years, with others keen to air their point
of view, are led to embrace thy saving truth. For, &rsquo;tis thy saving
Truth, subtle, but preached so well, for which all yearn. Vouchsafe an
answer, Lord, to us!</li>
<li>&ldquo;Let the lay-followers learn from thy lips thy Lore
immaculate!&rdquo;</li>
<li>The Blessed Lord in compassion for his lay-followers said:
&ldquo;Give me your ear. I will explain the principles of righteous conduct.
Hear and follow them.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Slay not, nor doom to death, nor sanction slaughter. Do no
violence to aught that lives, strong or weak.</li>
<li>&ldquo;No layman, wittingly, should thieve, or order theft, or
sanction any theft; take but what others give.</li>
<li>&ldquo;And shun incontinence as &rsquo;twere a pit of fire; or, failing
continence, debauch no wedded wife.</li>
<li>&ldquo;In conclaves, courts, or talk, let him not lie; let him not
prompt or sanction lies; let him renounce untruth.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Layman, observe this law: shun drink; make no man drink;
sanction no drinking. Mark how drink to madness leads.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Through drink fools sin, and egg lax brethren on to sin. So
flee this maddening vice, this folly, bliss of fools.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Slay not, nor steal, nor lie; from strong drink keep away;
refrain from lechery; touch not wrong meals at night!</li>
<li>&ldquo;Eschew both scents and wreaths; spread on the ground thy bed;
so make thy sabbath vows as week succeeds to week, and keep with pious
hearts this eightfold festival.</li>
<li>&ldquo;At morn, these vows performed, with pious, thankful heart, be
wise, and of thy means give Almsmen food and drink.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Cherish thy parents well; follow a righteous trade. Thus
shall the layman staunch reach realms of light above.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 5. One Need Not Wait for a Companion to Tread on the Path of
Righteousness</p>
<ol>
<li>An elephant in battle bears the arrow at him buried; I must
bear men&rsquo;s bitter tongues for every evil in the world.</li>
<li>Tamed, they lead him into battle; tamed, the king his back
ascends; tamed, is he the best of beings, when no bitter speech
offends.</li>
<li>Good are well-tamed mules, and good are Cindian steeds of
lineage famed; good indeed the mighty tusker; best of all the men
self-tamed.</li>
<li>Yet such mounts can naught avail us, cannot be Nibbana&rsquo;s guide.
We can only reach the Path on the self-tamed self-ride.</li>
<li>Take delight in Earnestness; watch thy thoughts and never tire.
Lift thee from the Path of Evil, take the Tusker out of mire.</li>
<li>Hast thou found a fellow-traveller, upright, firm, intelligent?
Leaving all thy cares behind thee, gladly walk with him intent.</li>
<li>Hast thou found no fellow-traveller, upright, intelligent? As a
King deserts his borders, by the enemy pursued, like the tusker in the
forest, so go thy way in solitude.</li>
<li>Better is the lonely life, for fools companions cannot be. Live
alone and do no evil, live alone with scanty needs, lonely as the
mighty tusker in the forest lonely feeds.</li>
<li>Expunge all bad thoughts.</li>
<li>Here is the way to expunge [them]..</li>
<li>You are to expunge [them] by resolving that, though others
may be harmful, you will be harmless.</li>
<li>That, though others may kill, you will never kill.</li>
<li>That, though others may steal, you will not.</li>
<li>That, though others may not lead the higher life, you will.</li>
<li>That, though others may lie, traduce, denounce, or prattle,
you will not.</li>
<li>That, though others may be covetous, you will covet not.</li>
<li>That, though others may be malignant, you will be benignant.</li>
<li>That, though others may be given over to wrong views, wrong
aims, wrong speech, [wrong] actions, wrong modes of livelihood,
wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, and wrong concentration, you must
follow the Noble Eight-fold Path in right outlook, right aims, right
speech, right actions, right mode of livelihood, right efforts, right
mindfulness, and right concentration.</li>
<li>That, though others are wrong about the truth and wrong about
Deliverance, you will be right about truth and right about
Deliverance.</li>
<li>That, though others may be possessed by sloth and torpor, you
will free yourself therefrom.</li>
<li>That, though others may be puffed up, you will be
humble-minded.</li>
<li>That, though others may be perplexed by doubts, you will be
free from them.</li>
<li>That, though others may harbour wrath, malevolence, envy,
jealousy, niggardliness, avarice, hypocrisy, deceit, imperviousness,
arrogance, forwardness, unscrupulousness, lack of instruction,
inertness, bewilderment, and unwisdom, you will be the reverse of all
these things.</li>
</ol>
<p>SECTION FOUR&ndash;SERMONS ON NIBBANA</p>
<p>§ 1. What is Nibbana?</p>
<ol>
<li>Once the Blessed Lord was staying at Shravasti in
Anathapindika&rsquo;s Ashrama, where Sariputta was also staying.</li>
<li>The Lord, addressing the Brethren, said: &ldquo;Almsmen, be ye
partakers not of the world&rsquo;s goods, but of my doctrine; in my
compassion for you all I am anxious to ensure this.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Thus spoke the Lord, who thereupon rose and passed to his own
cell.</li>
<li>Sariputta remained behind, and the Brethren asked him to
explain what is Nibbana.</li>
<li>Then Sariputta in reply to the Brethren said: &ldquo;Brethren, know
you that greed is vile, and vile is resentment.</li>
<li>&ldquo;To shed this greed and this resentment, there is the Middle
Way, which gives us eyes to see and makes us know, leading us on to
peace, insight, enlightenment, and Nibbana.</li>
<li>&ldquo;What is this Middle Way? It is naught but the Noble Eight-fold
Path of right outlook, right aims, right speech, right action, right
means of livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right
concentration; this, Almsmen is the Middle Way.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Yes, sirs; anger is vile and malevolence is vile, envy and
jealousy are vile, niggardliness and avarice are vile, hypocrisy and
deceit and arrogance are vile, inflation [boastfulness?] is vile,
and indolence is vile.</li>
<li>&ldquo;For the shedding of inflation and indolence there is the
Middle Way, giving us eyes to see, making us know, and leading us on
to peace, insight, enlightenment.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Nibbana&ndash;which is naught but that Noble Eight-fold Path.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Thus spoke the reverend Sariputta—glad at heart, the Almsmen
rejoiced at what he had said.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 2. The Roots of Nibbana</p>
<p>(2.i)</p>
<ol>
<li>Once the venerable Radha came to the Exalted One. Having done
so, he saluted the Exalted One and sat down on one side. So seated,
the venerable Radha thus addressed the Exalted One: &ldquo;Pray, Lord, what
for is Nibbana?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Nibbana means release from passion,&rdquo; replied the Lord.</li>
<li>&ldquo;But Nibbana, Lord,&ndash;what is the aim of it?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Rooted in Nibbana, Radha, the righteous life is lived. Nibbana
is its goal. Nibbana is its end.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>(2.ii)</p>
<ol>
<li>Once the Exalted One was dwelling at Shravasti, in Jeta&rsquo;s
Grove, at Anathapindika&rsquo;s Park. Then the Exalted One called the
brethren, saying, &ldquo;Brethren.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, Lord,&rdquo; replied those brethren to
the Exalted One. The Exalted One thus spake:</li>
<li>&ldquo;Do ye bear in mind, brethren, the Five Fetters that bind to
the lower world, as taught by me?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Whereupon the venerable Malunkyaputta said this to the Exalted
One :</li>
<li>&ldquo;I, Lord, bear in mind those Five Fetters.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;And how, Malunkyaputta, do you bear them in mind?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&quot; I bear in mind, Lord, the view of bodyhood, as taught by the
Exalted One; and wavering, and the moral taint of dependence on rite
and ritual, the excitement of sensual delight, and malevolence, taught
by the Exalted One as fetters that bind to the lower world. These are
the Five Fetters that I bear in mind, Lord.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;As taught for whom, Malunkyaputta, do you bear in mind these
Five Fetters? Will not the wanderers of other views reproach you,
using the parable of a tender baby for their reproach and saying
thus:</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;But, Malunkyaputta, there can be no bodyhood for a tender
baby-boy, dull of wits and lying on his back. How, then, can there
arise in him any view of bodyhood? Yet there is indeed latent in him a
tendency to the view of bodyhood.</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;Likewise, Malunkyaputta, there can be no mental conditions
for a tender baby-boy, dull of wits and lying on his back. How, then,
can there be in him any wavering of mental conditions? Yet there is in
him a latent tendency to wavering.</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;So also, Malunkyaputta, he can have no moral practice. How,
then, can there be in him any moral taint of dependence on rite and
ritual? Yet he has a latent tendency thereto.</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;Again, Malunkyaputta, that tender babe has no sensual
passions. How, then, can be known the excitement of sensual delight?
But the tendency is there.</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;Lastly, Malunkyaputta, for that tender babe beings do not
exist. How then can it harbour malevolence against beings? Yet the
tendency thereto is in him.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Now, Malunkyaputta, will not those wanderers of other views
thus reproach you, using for their reproach the parable of that tender
baby-boy?&rdquo;</li>
<li>When this was said, the venerable Ananda thus addressed the
Exalted One: &ldquo;Now is the time, Exalted One. O Wayfarer, now is the
time for the Exalted One to set.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>SECTION FIVE&ndash;SERMONS ON DHAMMA</p>
<p>§ 1. Why Right Views Rank First</p>
<ol>
<li>Of the noble Eightfold Plath the noblest is Right Outlook.</li>
<li>Right thinking is the preface and the key to every thing else
in the higher life, and ignorance [sic].</li>
<li>The lack of understanding is the root of all evil.</li>
<li>For developing right outlook, one must see all phenomena of
life as a process of causal law. To have right outlook is to recognise
the law of cause and effect.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Whatsoever individual, brethren, follows perverted views,
perverted aim, perverted speech or acts or living, perverted effort,
attention, and contemplation; whose knowledge and emancipation are
perverted&ndash;for him every action of deed, word or thought, performed
and achieved according to such perverted views; every willed act,
every aspiration, every resolve, all his activities; these things one
and all conduce to what is distasteful, unpleasing, repulsive,
unprofitable, and painful. And why so? Because of his evil view.&rdquo;</li>
<li>To be right is not enough. A baby may be right, but that does
not mean that a baby knows what is right. To be right one must know
what is right.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Ananda, who can be rightly described as an almsman? Only he
who has mastered what is rationally possible and what is rationally
impossible.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 2. Why Bother About Life After Death?</p>
<ol>
<li>On a certain occasion the venerable Kassapa the Great and the
venerable Sariputta were staying near Benares at Isipatana in the Deer
Park.</li>
<li>Then the venerable Sariputta, rising up at eventide from
solitude, went to the venerable Kassapa the Great, and sat down on one
side.</li>
<li>So seated, the venerable Sariputta said to the venerable
Kassapa the Great, &ldquo;How now friend Kassapa? Does the Tathagata exist
beyond death?</li>
<li>&ldquo;Undeclared is it, friend, by the Exalted One, that the
Tathagata exists beyond death.</li>
<li>&ldquo;What then, friend? Does the Tathagata both exist and not exist
beyond death?</li>
<li>&ldquo;This also, friend, is undeclared by the Exalted One.</li>
<li>&ldquo;How then, friend? Does the Tathagata neither not exist beyond
death? That also, friend, is not declared by the Exalted One.</li>
<li>&ldquo;But why, friend, has it not been declared by the Exalted
One?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;This is a question not concerned with profit to humanity, or
with the first principles of holy life. It does not lead to perfect
wisdom nor to Nibbana. That, friend, is why it is not declared by the
Exalted One.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 3. Prayers and Invocations to God are a Futility</p>
<ol>
<li>Once the Blessed Lord speaking to Vasettha said:</li>
<li>&ldquo;If this river Achiravati were full of water even to the brim
and overflowing, and a man with business to be done on the further
bank of it should come up, and want to cross over,</li>
<li>&ldquo;And standing on that bank, he should invoke the further bank
and say: &rsquo; Come hither, O further bank! Come over to this side!&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Now what think you, Vasettha? Would the further bank of the
river Achiravati, by that man&rsquo;s invoking and praying, and hoping, and
praising, come over to this side?</li>
<li>&ldquo;In just the same way, Vasettha, do the Brahmins, versed in the
three Vedas, omitting the practice of those qualities which really
make a man a Brahmin, and adopting the practice of those qualities
which really make men non-Brahmins, say thus:</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;Indra we call upon, Brahma we call upon, Isana we call upon,
Prajapati we call upon, Brahma we call upon&ndash;we call, we call.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Verily, Vasettha, that these Brahmins, by reason of their
invoking .and praying and hoping and praising, should after death
become united with Brahma&ndash;verily such a condition of things can in
nowise be.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 4. It is Not What You Eat that Makes You Holy</p>
<ol>
<li>A Brahmin happened to meet the Lord, and raised the question of
the effect of food on a man&rsquo;s character.</li>
<li>The Brahmin said: &ldquo;The millet-grain, palm-nuts, pulse, bulbs,
and wilding shoots&ndash;this diet, rightly got, ever prompts the good
life. Tis eating carrion that is bad.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The Blessed One replied: &ldquo;Though you (Lord) say you touch no
carrion, you eat choice dishes made with [the] flesh of birds&ndash;I ask
what you term &lsquo;carrion&rsquo;.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Killing and maiming, stripes, bonds, theft, lies, fraud,
deceit, adultery&ndash;not meats, but these, are carrion.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Pursuit of pleasure, lust for guzzlings, life unclean, blatant
dissent&ndash;not meats, but these, are carrion.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Backbiting, cruelty, betrayals, ruthless pride, mean
stinginess&ndash;not meats, but these, are carrion.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Anger, conceit, revolt, guile, envy, bluster, pride, low
company&ndash;not meats, but these, are carrion.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Base living, slander, fraud, cheating, the trickster&rsquo;s wiles,
foul infamies&ndash;not meats, but these, are carrion.</li>
<li>&ldquo;This rage to slay and steal, these crimes, are fraught with
doom and end in hell&ndash;not meats, but these, are carrion.</li>
<li>&ldquo;No abstinence from meat and fish, no nudity, no topknots,
shaven crowns, or garb of pelt, no cult of sacred fire, no stark
austerities to purchase future bliss, no rinsing, burnt-offering,
rites, can cleanse the man who doubts.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Control thy sense, rule thy powers, hold to Truth, be kind.
The saint who leaves all ties and vanquishes all ills, is stained by
naught he either sees or hears.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Hearing the Lord preach these lofty, saving truths, denouncing
&lsquo;carrion&rsquo;, and sweeping ills away, the Brahmin meekly knelt and asked
to be enrolled as Almsman then and there.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 5. Not Food But Evil Actions That Matter</p>
<ol>
<li>A Brahmin, by name Amagandha, was an ascetic who lived in the
region of Himalayas with his pupils.</li>
<li>They ate neither fish nor flesh. Every year they came down from
their hermitage in search of salt and acids. The inhabitants of the
village received them with honour, and gave them hospitality for four
months.</li>
<li>Then the Blessed Lord with his monks visited the same village.
The people, on hearing the Lord preach his Dhamma, became his
followers.</li>
<li>That year even Amagandha and his disciples as usual went to the
villagers, but the villagers did not show the same enthusiasm.</li>
<li>Amagandha was disappointed to hear that the Lord did not forbid
eating fish and flesh. Wishing to have the matter confirmed, he went
to Jeta Vana at Shravasti, where the Blessed Lord was then staying,
and said:</li>
<li>&ldquo;Millet, cingula-beans and peas, edible leaves and roots, the
fruit of any creeper; the righteous who eat these, obtained justly, do
not tell lies for the sake of pleasures.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Thou eatest whatever food is given by others, which is well
prepared, nicely got up, pure, and excellent. He who enjoys such food
made of rice, he eats &lsquo;Amagandha&rsquo;. You say that the charge of
Amagandha, does not apply to me, while eating rice with well prepared
bird&rsquo;s flesh.</li>
<li>&ldquo;I inquire the meaning of this from you, of what kind is your
Amagandha?&rdquo;</li>
<li>The Lord replied: &ldquo;Taking life, beating, cutting, binding,
stealing, lying, fraud, deceiving, worthless knowledge, adultery&ndash;this
is Amagandha, and not the eating of flesh.</li>
<li>&ldquo;In this world those individuals who are unrestrained in
sensual pleasures, who are greedy for sweet things, who are associated
with impure actions, who are of Nihilistic views, crooked, difficult
to follow&ndash;this is Amagandha, and not the eating of flesh.</li>
<li>&ldquo;In this world those who are rude, harsh, backbiting,
treacherous, unkind, excessively egoistic, ungenerous, and do not give
anything to anybody&ndash;this is Amagandha, and not the eating of flesh.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Anger, pride, obstinacy, antagonism, deceit, envy, boasting,
excessive egoism, association with the unrighteous&ndash;this is Amagandha,
and not eating of flesh.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Those who are of bad morals, refuse to pay their debt,
slanderers, deceitful in their dealings, pretenders, those who in this
world being the vilest of men, commit such wrongdoings&ndash;this is
Amagandha, and not the eating of flesh.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Those persons who, in this world, are uncontrolled towards
living beings, who are bent on injuring others, having taken their
belongings; immoral, cruel, harsh, disrespectful&ndash;this is Amagandha,
and not the eating of flesh.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Those who attack these living beings either because of greed
or of hostility, and always bent upon (evil), they go to darkness
after death and fall into hell headlong&ndash;this is Amagandha, and not
the eating of flesh.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Abstaining from fish or flesh, nakedness, shaving of the
head, matted hair, covering with ashes, wearing rough deer skins,
attending the sacrificial fire&ndash;nor all these various penances in the
world (performed) for immortality, neither incantations, oblations,
sacrifices nor seasonal observances, purifies a person who has not
overcome his doubt.</li>
<li>&ldquo;He who lives with his senses guarded and conquered, and is
established in the Dhamma, delights in uprightness and gentleness, who
has gone beyond attachments and has overcome all sorrows&ndash;that wise
man does not cling to what is seen and heard.</li>
<li>&ldquo;It is evil actions which constitute Amagandha, and not the
eating of fish or flesh.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 6. Not Enough Is Outward Washing</p>
<ol>
<li>Once the Exalted One was dwelling at Shravatsi. And the Brahmin
Sangarava also dwelt there. Now he was a cleanser by water, and
practised cleansing by water. Night and day he abode, given to the
habit of going down to bathe.</li>
<li>Now the venerable Ananda, robing himself at an early hour and
taking outer robe and bowl, went forth to Shravatsi to beg. And when
he had gone his rounds in Shravatsi and had eaten his meal, upon his
return he went to the Exalted One, saluted Him, and sat down on one
side. So seated, the venerable Ananda said:</li>
<li>&ldquo;Lord, there is here one Sangarava, a Brahmin, dwelling at
Shravatsi, a cleanser by water, one who practises cleansing by water.
Night and day does he abide, given to the habit of going down to
bathe. Well were it. Lord, if the Exalted One would pay a visit to the
Brahmin Sangarava, out of compassion for him.&rdquo;</li>
<li>And the Exalted One consented by His silence.</li>
<li>So next day at an early hour, the Exalted One robed himself
and, taking outer robe and bowl, went to the dwelling of the Brahmin
Sangarava, and when he got there he sat down on a seat made ready.</li>
<li>Then the Brahmin Sangarava came to the Exalted One and greeted
him, and after the exchange of mutual courtesies sat down on one
side.</li>
<li>As he thus sat, the Exalted One said this to the Brahmin
Sangarava: &ldquo;Is it true, Brahmin, as they say, that thou art a cleanser
by water, that thou dost practise cleansing by water, abiding night
and day given to the habit of going down to bathe?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;True it is. Master Gautama.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Now, Brahmin, seeking what profit dost thou so practise the
habit of going down to bathe, and so forth?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;It is in this way, Master Gautama. Whatsoever evil I do by
day, I get it washed away that very evening by my bathing. Whatsoever
evil I do by night, I get it washed away next morning by my bathing.
That is the profit I am looking for in being a cleanser by water and
so forth.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Then said the Exalted One:</li>
<li>&ldquo;The Norm is the pool. It is clear and undefiled.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Hither when they have come to bathe, the masters of the lore
are cleansed in every limb, and pass unto the Further Shore.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Whereupon the Brahmin Sangarava said to the Exalted One:
&ldquo;Excellent it is, Master Gautama. May the Master Gautama accept me as
his follower, from this day forth so long as life doth last, as one
who has taken refuge in him.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>§7. What is Holy Life?</p>
<ol>
<li>Once while the Blessed Lord was on [a] journey he gave, as
was his practice, the following discourse to the Bhikkhus who were
accompanying him.</li>
<li>Addressing the Bhikkhus the Lord said: &ldquo;O brethren, this holy
life is not practised with a view to deceive people, nor to seek their
favour, nor for the purpose of gain, benefit, or fame, nor with the
intention of getting out of difficulties in controversy, nor that one
may be known as such and such by men. Indeed, brethren, this holy life

<p>SECTION SIX&ndash;SERMONS ON SOCIO-POLITICAL QUESTIONS</p>
<p>§ 1. Do Not Depend on the Favour of Princes</p>
<ol>
<li>Once the Exalted One was staying at Rajagraha in the Bamboo
Grove, in the Squirrels&rsquo; Feeding ground.</li>
<li>At that time, Prince Ajatasatru was supporting Devadatta, who
had turned hostile to the Blessed Lord.</li>
<li>He was maintaining the supporters of Devadatta, late and early,
with five hundred carts, conveying therein food brought in five
hundred cooking-pots.</li>
<li>Then a number of the brethren came before the Exalted One,
saluted him, and sat down on one side, and there sitting, they told
all of these things to the Exalted One.</li>
<li>Then the Blessed Lord, addressing the brethren said: &ldquo;Do ye not
long for gains, favours and flattery from the kings. So long,
brethren, as Prince Ajatasatru thus supports Devadatta, late and
early, with five hundred carts, conveying therein food brought in five
hundred cooking-pots, it is ruin, brethren, that may be expected of
Devadatta, and not growth in good conditions.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Just as if, brethren, one were to crumble liver on a mad dog&rsquo;s
nose, the dog would only get the madder, even so, brethren, so long as
Prince Ajatasatru thus supports Devadatta it is ruin that may be
expected of Devadatta, and not growth in good conditions. Thus
terrible, brethren, are gains, favours, and flattery of the princes.</li>
<li>&ldquo;They are a bitter, painful hindrance to the attainment of the
sure peace that passeth all.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Wherefore, brethren, thus must you train yourselves: &lsquo;When
gains, favours, and flattery befall us, we will reject them, and when
they do befall us, they shall not take hold of and be established in
our hearts, and make us slaves of the prince.&rsquo;&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>§2. If the King is Righteous, his Subjects will be Righteous</p>
<ol>
<li>Once the Lord, addressing the Almsmen, said:</li>
<li>&ldquo;Brethren during such time as kings are unrighteous, their
ministers and officers also become unrighteous. The ministers and
officers, brethren, being unrighteous, Brahmins and householders also
become unrighteous. The Brahmins and householders, brethren, being
unrighteous, the town-folk and villagers become unrighteous.</li>
<li>&ldquo;But whenever, brethren, kings are righteous, then kings&rsquo;
ministers and officers also become righteous. Whenever kings&rsquo;
ministers and officers become righteous, the Brahmins and householders
also become righteous. Whenever Brahmins and householders become
righteous, the town-folk and villagers also become righteous.</li>
<li>&ldquo;When kine are crossing, if the old bull swerves, they all go
swerving, following his lead. So among men, if he who is reckoned
chief walks crookedly, the others crooked go.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Similarly, the whole realm suffers when the king goes wrong.
When kine are crossing, if the bull goes straight they all go
straight, because his course is straight. So among men, if he who&rsquo;s
reckoned chief walks righteously, the others live aright. The whole
realm lead happy lives when kings are good.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>§3. It is the Social System on which Depends Political and Military
Strength</p>
<ol>
<li>The Blessed One was once dwelling in Rajagraha, on the hill
called the Vultures&rsquo; Peak.</li>
<li>Now at that time, Ajatasatru, the son of the queen consort of
Videha origin, the king of Magadha, was desirous of attacking the
Vajjins, and he said to himself, &ldquo;I will root out these Vajjins,
mighty and powerful though they be, I will destroy these Vajjins, I
will bring these Vajjins to utter ruin!&rdquo;</li>
<li>So he spoke to the Brahmin Vasakara, the Prime Minister of
Magadha, and said:</li>
<li>&ldquo;Come now, O Brahmin, do you go to the Blessed One, and bow
down in adoration at his feet on my behalf, and enquire on my behalf
whether he is free from illness and suffering, and in the enjoyment of
ease and comfort and vigorous health.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Then tell him that Ajatasatru, son of Videhi, the King of
Magadha, is eager to attack the Vajjins, mighty and powerful though
they be&ndash;I will destroy these Vajjins, I will bring these Vajjins to
utter ruin!</li>
<li>&ldquo;And bear carefully in mind whatever the Blessed One may
predict, and repeat it to me. For the Buddha speaks nothing untrue.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Then the Brahmin Vasakara hearkened to the words of the king,
saying, &ldquo;Be it as you say.&rdquo; And ordering a number of magnificent
carriages to be [made] ready, he went to the Vultures&rsquo; Peak.</li>
<li>On arriving there, he exchanged with the Blessed One the
greetings and compliments, and then delivered to him the message, even
as the king had commanded.</li>
<li>Now at that time the venerable Ananda was standing behind the
Blessed One. And the Blessed One said to him: &ldquo;Have you heard, Ananda,
that theVajjins hold full and frequent public assemblies?</li>
<li>&ldquo;Lord, so I have heard,&rdquo; replied he.</li>
<li>&ldquo;So long, Ananda,&rdquo; rejoined the Blessed One, &ldquo;as the Vajjins
hold these full and frequent public assemblies; so long may they be
expected not to decline, but to prosper.</li>
<li>&ldquo;So long, Ananda, as the Vajjins meet together in concord, and
rise in concord, and carry out their undertakings in concord.</li>
<li>&ldquo;So long as they enact nothing not already established,
abrogate nothing that has been already enacted, and act in accordance
with the ancient institutions of the Vajjins as established in former
days.</li>
<li>&ldquo;So long as they honour and esteem and revere and support the
Vajjin Elders, and make it a point of duty to hearken to their
words.</li>
<li>&ldquo;So long as no women or girls belonging to their clans are
detained among them by force or abduction.</li>
<li>&ldquo;So long as the Vajjins respect and follow religion.</li>
<li>&ldquo;So long, Ananda, the Vajjins may be expected not to decline
but to prosper, and no one can destroy them.&rdquo;</li>
<li>In short, the Blessed Lord declared that so long as the
Vajjins believe in democracy and practise democracy, there is no
danger to their State.</li>
<li>Then the Blessed One addressed Vasakara and said:</li>
<li>&ldquo;When I was once staying, O Brahmin, at Vaishali, I taught the
Vajjins these conditions of welfare.</li>
<li>&ldquo;We may expect, then,&rdquo; answered the Brahmin, &ldquo;the welfare and
not the decline of the Vajjins, so long as they observe these
conditions. So, Gautama, the Vajjins cannot be overcome by the king of
Magadha.&rdquo;</li>
<li>So Vasakara heard the words of the Blessed One, rose from his
seat, and went back to Rajagraha to inform the king of what the Lord
had said.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 4. War is Wrong</p>
<ol>
<li>It so happened that Ajatasatru, the king of Magadha, mustering
an army of cavalry and infantry, invaded Kasi, a part of the kingdom
of king Pasenadi. And Pasenadi, hearing of the expedition, also
mustered a similar army and went to meet him.</li>
<li>The two fought with one another, and Ajatasatru defeated the
king Pasenadi, who retreated to his own capital Shravasti.</li>
<li>The Bhikkhus who were in Shravasti, returning from their alms
round, came and told the Exalted One of the battle and the retreat.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Almsmen, the king of Magadha, Ajatasatru, is a friend of
whatever is evil. King Pasenadi is a friend of whatever is good. For
the present, Pasenadi will pass the night in misery, a defeated man.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Conquest engenders hate; the conquered lives in misery. But
whoso is at peace and passionless, happily doth he live; conquest hath
he abandoned and defeat.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Again it so happened these two kings met in battle a second
time. But in that battle, the Kosala king Pasenadi defeated Ajatasatru
and captured him alive. Then king Pasenadi thought: &ldquo;Although this
king injures me who was not injuring him, yet is he my nephew. What if
I were now to confiscate his entire army, elephants, horses, chariots
and infantry and leave him only his life?&rdquo; And he did so.</li>
<li>And almsmen, returning from their alms tour in Shravasti,
brought word of this to the Exalted One. Thereupon the Exalted One
said: &ldquo;A man may spoil another, just so far as it may serve his ends;
but when he&rsquo;s spoiled by others, he, despoiled, spoils yet again.</li>
<li>&ldquo;So long as evil&rsquo;s fruit is not matured, the fool doth fancy
now&rsquo;s the hour, the chance! But when the deed bears fruit, he fareth
ill.</li>
<li>&ldquo;The slayer gets a slayer in his turn; the conqueror gets one
who conquers him; the abuser wins abuse from another.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Thus by the evolution of the deed, a man who spoils is
spoiled in his turn.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 5. The Duty of the Victor Who Has Won Peace</p>
<ol>
<li>When the victor in war has won the peace, he claims the right
further to degrade the vanquished, if not to enslave him. The Buddha
had a totally different view on the matter. In his view, if peace had
[=has]any meaning it means that the victor has a duty to use his
victory for the service of the vanquished. This is what he said to the
Bhikkhus on this subject:</li>
<li>&ldquo;When Peace is won, the adept in warfare needs to prove an
able, upright man, of gracious speech [and] kind mood, devoid of
arrogance; an easy, grateful guest, no busybody, wants but few,
sense-disciplined, quick-witted, bluster-free, never importunate; and
let him never stoop to conduct mean or low, evoking grave rebuke.</li>
<li>&ldquo;May creatures all abound in weal and peace; may all be blessed
with peace always&ndash;all creatures weak or strong, all creatures great
and small; creatures unseen or seen, dwelling afar or near, born or
awaiting birth, may all be blessed with peace!</li>
<li>&ldquo;Let none cajole or flout his fellows anywher ; let none wish
others harm in dudgeon or in hate.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Just as with her own life a mother shields from hurt her own,
her only child, let all-embracing thoughts for all that lives be
thine, an all-embracing love for all the universe in all its heights
and depths and breadths, unstinted love, unmarred by hate within, not
rousing enmity.<br>
6.&ldquo;So, as you stand, or walk, or sit, or lie, reflect with all
your might on this: &lsquo;Tis deemed a state divine.&rsquo;&rdquo;</li>
