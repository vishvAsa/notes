title = "Hindus with updated beliefs"
+++

Many highly regarded, erudite and practicing hindu-s are/ have been quite happy to update their belief systems with modern scientific findings (eg: theory of evolution). They too do not find the concept of karma and rebirth to be central to the hindu tradition which they hold so dear.

- shatAvadhAnI gaNesh (source:[ his lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2ounFpr5CwJt1MHN2xB8aHe6ip06Olgm) on "Foundations of Indian Culture"), the great poet and avadhAna-artist, an advaita-vedAntin.
- The fine scholar M Hiriyanna, who famously said (I paraphrase): "Art can replace religion in this age of rationality and equality".
- the author of [mAnasatarangiNI](http://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/).
- Kalavai Venkat, the writer who always signs underneath his articles : "atheist, a practicing orthodox Hindu" (eg: [here](http://www.indiafacts.co.in/chennai-bomb-blast-islamic-psyche/#sthash.sbCudF0Z.DVLvivr8.dpbs), CRI [articles](http://centreright.in/author/kalavai/#.VCwLtHWx3UY)).

### Suitable labels
- "Spirituality", if it means "a deep emotional connection with nature/ universe", is apt too.
- "Modern orthodoxy", analogous to what is described [here](https://agnimaan.wordpress.com/2015/08/31/modern-orthodoxy-as-a-glue-between-the-ultra-orthodox-and-the-liberal-the-jewish-example/), is apt also.
