      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the maNDala 8 of the RV we encounter the name paktha:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;yAbhiH paktham avatho yAbhir adhriguM yAbhir babhruM vijoShasam |&lt;br&gt;&#xA;yathA kaNve maghavan trasadasyavi yathA pakthe dashavraje |&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This paktha was probably the founder of a clan that later settled in the indo-Iranian borderlands of mUjavant &amp;amp; bAhlika. They are mentioned as being among the the groups which fought in the great sudAs war of maNDala 7:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A pakthAso bhalAnaso bhanantAlinAso viShANinaH shivAsaH |&lt;br&gt;&#xA;It is not clear on which side they fought or perhaps from the text they switched sides.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Domes originated in India, not Persia. They were originally NW Bauddha architecture. A few elite Mazdean Bactrian landowning families converted to Buddhism (Baramakhids) and were completely assimilated into Sanskritic culture.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These people carried dome architecture to Persia.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Baramakhid means Pramukha in Sanskrit (leader). They were landowners in the Silk Road and Bactria and Mazdean priests (Mazdean = Mazdayasna = Yajna of Ahura Mazda = what Zoroastrians called themselves like Hindus did “Sanatani”).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mazar-I-Sharif.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today, Mazar-I-Sharif is a city in Central Asia that is 1670 kms away from Delhi. Did you know? Until 1000 years ago, this city was a big Shaivite pilgrimage site. It hosted one of the biggest Shiva temples of Central Asia. Pilgrims flocked to this temple.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today, Mazar-I-Sharif is most famous for its blue mosque. According to Afghan Muslims, this mosque contains the tomb of Prophet&amp;rsquo;s son in law Ali.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
