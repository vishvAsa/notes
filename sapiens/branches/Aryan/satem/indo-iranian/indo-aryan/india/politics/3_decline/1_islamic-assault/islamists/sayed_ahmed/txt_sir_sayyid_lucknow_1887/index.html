<p>SPEECH OF SIR SYED AHMED<br>
AT LUCKNOW [1887]</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A LECTURE was given by the Hon&rsquo;ble Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, before a
large and very influential audience of Mahomedans in Lucknow, on 18th
December, 1887, at 8.30 P.M., in the Baradari, Kaisarbagh, on the
attitude the Mahomedan community ought to assume towards the
Government, the political questions of the day, and the Bengali
movement. The meeting was attended not only by the Mahomedans of
Lucknow, but by gentlemen who had come from all parts of Upper India
to be present at the Mahomedan Educational Congress. It represented
the intellect and the aristocracy, the brain and the muscle, of the
Mahomedan community. There were present the taluqdars of Oudh, members
of the Government Services, the Army, the Professions of Law, the
Press and the Priesthood; Syeds, Shaikhs, Moghals and Pathans
belonging to some of the noblest families in India; and
representatives of every school of thought, from orthodox Sunni and
Shiah Maulvis to the young men trained in Indian colleges or in
England. The Syed&rsquo;s speech lasted an hour and a half, and was
delivered with great eloquence. It was received with enthusiastic
applause. The chair was occupied by Munshi Imtiaz Ali, the [[2]]
legal adviser of the Oudh Taluqdars&rsquo; Association, a distinguished
pleader belonging to an ancient and noble Arab family of Oudh. The
speech was delivered in Urdu, taken down by Munshi Aziz-ud-din, and
afterwards revised by Sir Syed himself. The substance of the lecture
was as follows:&ndash;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>{1}[*<a href="txt_sir_sayyid_lucknow_1887_fwp0106.html#fwp01">01</a>*]GENTLEMEN,
&ndash;I am not given to speaking on politics, and I do not recollect having
ever previously given a political lecture. My attention has always been
directed towards the education of my brother Mahomedans, for from
education I anticipate much benefit for my people, for Hindustan, and
for the Government. But at the present time circumstances have arisen
which make it necessary for me, I think, to tell my brother Musalmans
clearly what my opinions are. The object, gentlemen, of this lecture is
to explain the attitude which the Mahomedan community ought to adopt
with regard to the political movements of the time. I am not going to
give a philosophical discourse, nor to speak of those abstract questions
on political economy which would require many lectures fully to deal
with; but I am simply going to express my opinions in a plain and
straightforward manner, leaving it to everyone who hears me to agree
with me or differ from me. The reason why I stand here to address you
today is because there has grown up in India a political agitation, and
it is necessary to determine what action should be taken by the
Mahomedan community with regard to it. Although my own thoughts and
desires are towards my own community, [[3]] yet I shall discuss
whether or not this agitation is useful for the country and for the
other nations who live in it. If it be useful, we must follow it; but if
dangerous for the country or our nation, we must hold aloof.</p>
<p>{2}[*<a href="txt_sir_sayyid_lucknow_1887_fwp0106.html#fwp02">02</a>*]
Before I enter on this subject, let me briefly describe the methods of
rule adopted by our Government, which has now been here for nearly a
hundred years. Its method is this: to keep in its own hands all
questions of foreign policy and all matters affecting its army. I hope
that we, who are subjects of the Empire, will not seek to interfere in
those matters which Government has set apart as its own. If the
Government fight Afghanistan or conquer Burma, it is no business of ours
to criticise its policy. Our interests will not suffer from these
matters being left in the hands of Government. But we are concerned with
matters affecting internal policy; and we have to observe what method
Government has adopted for dealing with them. Government has made a
Council for making laws affecting the lives, property, and comfort of
the people. For this Council she selects from all Provinces those
officials who are best acquainted with the administration and the
condition of the people, and also some <em>Raïses</em>**<a href="#n01">/1/</a>** who, on
account of their high social position, are worthy of a seat in that
assembly.</p>
<p>{3}[*<a href="txt_sir_sayyid_lucknow_1887_fwp0106.html#fwp03">03</a>*]
Some people may ask — Why should they be chosen on account of social
position instead of ability? On this, gentlemen, I will say a few words.
It is a great misfortune — and I [[4]] ask your pardon for saying it
— that the landed gentry of India have not the trained ability which
makes them worthy of occupying those seats. But you must not neglect
those circumstances which compel Government to adopt this policy. It is
very necessary that for the Viceroy&rsquo;s Council the members should be of
high social position. I ask you — Would our aristocracy like that a man
of low caste or insignificant origin, though he be a B.A. or M.A., and
have the requisite ability, should be in a position of authority above
them and have power in making laws that affect their lives and property?
Never! Nobody would like it. (<em>Cheers.</em>) A seat in the Council of the
Viceroy is a position of great honour and prestige. None but a man of
good breeding can the Viceroy take as his colleague, treat as his
brother, and invite to entertainments at which he may have to dine with
Dukes and Earls. Hence no blame can be attached to Government for making
those great Raïses members of the Council. It is our great misfortune
that our Raïses are such that they are unable to devise laws useful for
the country.</p>
<p>{4}[*<a href="txt_sir_sayyid_lucknow_1887_fwp0106.html#fwp04">04</a>*] The
method of procedure in the Council is this. If any member introduce a
subject of importance and difficulty, a commission is appointed which
collects evidence and digests it. The matter is discussed in every
newspaper, and memorials are invited from Associations. The Council then
discusses the matter, every member speaking his views with great vigour
and earnestness, more even than was displayed in the discussion on the
third resolution [[5]] in the Mahomedan Educational
Congress,<strong><a href="#n02">/2/</a></strong> advocating what he thinks necessary for the
welfare of the country; and as regardless of the Viceroy&rsquo;s presence as
if he were a figure of white stone. I have had the honour of being in
this Council. I do not recollect any matter of importance concerning
which ten or twenty memorials were not sent in. A Select Committee was
then appointed, which read through these memorials and discussed them at
length, many of which on consideration turned out to be thorough
nonsense. Extracts from Urdu papers were also considered. Although not
in my presence, yet often amendments suggested by these memorials have
been adopted. This is the method of our Government. After this the law
is passed and sent to the Secretary of State, who is assisted by the
Council of State, which consists of men of the highest ability, who have
lived for a long time in India and have often held all offices, from
that of Assistant Collector to Lieutenant-Governor. If they think it
expedient it is passed, otherwise a short note of four lines cancels it.
Often people make objections to the laws so passed, and in some cases
they are perhaps right; but in the majority of cases, as far as my
experience goes, those very people who sit in their houses and make
objections would, if they had been on the Viceroy&rsquo;s Council, have
supported them. Many details appear wrong on superficial consideration,
but when all the circumstances and difficulties [[6]] are taken into
account, they are seen to be right. In conclusion, whether the laws be
good or bad, no one can say that Government acts independently of the
wishes and opinions of its subjects. Often it adopts some of the views
expressed in newspapers and memorials. Can we say that Government, in
the method it has adopted for legislation, acts without regard to the
opinions of the people? Can we say that we have no share in the making
of the laws? Most certainly not. (<em>Cheers.</em>)</p>
<p>{5}[*<a href="txt_sir_sayyid_lucknow_1887_fwp0106.html#fwp05">05</a>*]
There is now another great duty of Government. That is, that in whatever
country Government establishes its dominion, that dominion should be
made strong, firm, and secure. I believe that if any of my friends were
made Viceroy; he would be as loyal to Her Majesty the Queen-Empress of
India as is our present Viceroy, Lord Dufferin. And his first duty would
be to see that the Empire of Her Majesty were made so firm that no
enemy, external, or internal, could shake it. (<em>Cheers.</em>) If it were my
fortune to be Viceroy; I speak from my heart when I say I would not be
equally, but more, anxious to see the rule of the Queen placed on a firm
basis. (<em>Cheers.</em>) It is a first principle of Empire that it is the
supreme duty of everyone, whether Hindustani or Englishman, in whose
power it rests, to do what he can to strengthen the Government of Her
Majesty the Queen. The second duty of Government is to preserve peace,
to give personal freedom, to protect life and property; to punish
criminals, and to decide civil [[7]] disputes. Now, everyone will
admit that Government completely fulfills its duty in this respect.</p>
<p>{6}[*<a href="txt_sir_sayyid_lucknow_1887_fwp0106.html#fwp06">06</a>*]
Many people think that the laws have become too numerous; and
consequently that lawsuits have become more complicated, and thus lead
to disputes between the <em>zamindar</em>**<a href="#n03">/3/</a>** and the
<em>kashtkar</em>.<strong><a href="#n04">/4/</a></strong> But this is the opinion of the critics who
sit in their houses, who if they sat on the Viceroy&rsquo;s Council would
change their views. The multiplicity of laws depends upon the condition
of the country and of its people. New companies and new industries are
springing into existence. New and unforeseen legal rights have arisen
which are not provided for in the Mahomedan law. Hence, when the country
is changing at such a rate, it is absolutely necessary that new laws
should be brought forward to deal with the new circumstances. Government
does not want to increase the number of laws, but when the conditions of
the country change, it becomes unavoidable. Taking all these things into
account, I cannot but think that there is no requirement of the country
that cannot be brought to the notice of Government. And nothing can
prevent our expressing our views on the subject and being heard by
Government. So that whatever comfort we can experience under any
Government, we have under the British Government. (<em>Cheers.</em>)</p>
<p>{7}[*<a href="txt_sir_sayyid_lucknow_1887_fwp0712.html#fwp07">07</a>*] I
come now to the main subject on which I wish to address you. That is
<em>The National Congress</em> and the demands which that body makes of
[[8]] Government. I cannot allude to its proposals in detail
because, as far as I am aware, there are forty-nine of them, and the
time at my disposal is short. I must therefore select the most
important. That about which the greatest agitation has taken place is
the following. When the Government of India passed out of the hands of
the East India Company into those of the Queen, a law was passed saying
that all subjects of Her Majesty, whether white or black, European or
Indian, should be equally eligible for appointments. This was confirmed
by the Queen&rsquo;s Proclamation. We have to see whether, in the rules made
for admission to civil appointments, any exception has been made to this
or not; whether we have been excluded from any appointments for which we
are fitted. Nobody can point out a case in which for any appointment a
distinction of race has been made. It is true that for the Covenanted
Civil Service a special set of rules has been made; namely, that
candidates have to pass a competitive examination in England. Perhaps it
will occur to everyone that this examination ought not to be held in
England, and the proposal about which the greatest agitation has taken
place is that it should be held in India. And to this is added another
proposal that all posts in the subordinate service, from that of
Tahsildar to Subordinate Judge, should also be given by competitive
examination.</p>
<p>{8}[*<a href="txt_sir_sayyid_lucknow_1887_fwp0712.html#fwp08">08</a>*] I
do not think it necessary for me on this occasion to discuss the
question why the competitive examination is held in England, and what
would [[9]] be the evils arising from its transference to India. But
I am going to speak of the evils likely to follow the introduction into
India of the competitive principle. I do not wish to speak in the
interest of my own co-religionists, but to express faithfully whether I
think the country is prepared for competitive examination or not. What
is the result of competitive examination in England? You know that men
of all social positions, sons of Dukes or Earls, of
<em>darzies</em>**<a href="#n05">/5/</a>** and people of low rank, are equally allowed to
pass this examination. Men of both high and low family come to India in
the Civil Service. And it is the universal belief that it is not
expedient for Government to bring the men of low rank; and that the men
of good social position treat Indian gentlemen with becoming politeness,
maintain the prestige of the British race, and impress on the hearts of
the people a sense of British justice, and are useful both to Government
and to the country. But those who come from England, come from a country
so far removed from our eyes that we do not know whether they are the
sons of Lords or Dukes or of <em>darzies</em>; and therefore if those who
govern us are of humble rank, we cannot perceive the fact. But as
regards Indians, the case is different. Men of good family would never
like to trust their lives and property to people of low rank with whose
humble origin they are well acquainted. (<em>Cheers.</em>)</p>
<p>{9}[*<a href="txt_sir_sayyid_lucknow_1887_fwp0712.html#fwp09">09</a>*]
Leave this a moment, and consider what are the conditions [[10]]
which make the introduction into a country of competitive examinations
expedient, and then see whether our own country is ready for it or not.
This is no difficult question of political economy. Everyone can
understand that the first condition for the introduction of competitive
examination into a country is that all people in that country, from the
highest to thc lowest, should belong to one nation. In such a country no
particular difficulties are likely to arise. The second case is that of
a country in which there are two nationalities which have become so
united as to be practically one nation. England and Scotland are a case
in point. In the past many wars were waged between those countries, and
many acts of bravery were done on both sides; but those times have gone,
and they are now like one nation. But this is not the case with our
country, which is peopled with different nations. Consider the Hindus
alone. The Hindus of our Province, the Bengalis of the East, and the
Mahrattas of the Deccan, do not form one nation. If in your opinion the
peoples of India do form one nation, then no doubt competitive
examination may be introduced; but if this be not so, then competitive
examination is not suited to the country. The third case is that of a
country in which there are different nationalities which are on an equal
footing as regards the competition, whether they take advantage of it or
not. Now, I ask you, have Mahomedans attained to such a position as
regards higher English education, which is necessary for higher
appointments, as to put them [[11]] on a level with Hindus or not?
Most certainly not. Now I take Mahomedans and the Hindus of our Province
together, and ask whether they are able to compete with the Bengalis or
not? Most certainly not. When this is the case, how can competitive
examination be introduced into our country? (<em>Cheers.</em>)</p>
<p>{10}[*<a href="txt_sir_sayyid_lucknow_1887_fwp0712.html#fwp10">10</a>*]
Think for a moment what would be the result if all appointments were
given by competitive examination. Over all races, not only over
Mahomedans but over Rajas of high position and the brave Rajputs who
have not forgotten the swords of their ancestors, would be placed as
ruler a Bengali who at sight of a table knife would crawl under his
chair. (<em>Uproarious cheers and laughter.</em>) There would remain no part of
the country in which we should see at the tables of justice and
authority any face except those of Bengalis. I am delighted to see the
Bengalis making progress, but the question is — What would be the result
on the administration of the country? Do you think that the Rajput and
the fiery Pathan, who are not afraid of being hanged or of encountering
the swords of the police or the bayonets of the army, could remain in
peace under the Bengalis? (<em>Cheers.</em>) This would be the outcome of the
proposal if accepted. Therefore if any of you — men of good position,
Raïses, men of the middle classes, men of noble family to whom God has
given sentiments of honour — if you accept that the country should groan
under the yoke of Bengali rule and its people lick the Bengali shoes,
<em>then, in the name of God! jump into the train, sit down, and be</em>
[[12]] <em>off to Madras,</em><strong><a href="#n06">/6/</a></strong> <em>be off to Madras!</em> (<em>Loud
cheers and laughter.</em>) But if you think that the prosperity and honour
of the country would be ruined, then, brothers, sit in your houses,
inform Government of your circumstances, and bring your wants to its
notice in a calm and courteous manner.</p>
<p>{11}[*<a href="txt_sir_sayyid_lucknow_1887_fwp0712.html#fwp11">11</a>*]
The second demand of the National Congress is that the people should
elect a section of the Viceroy&rsquo;s Council. They want to copy the English
House of Lords and the House of Commons. The elected members are to be
like members of the House of Commons; the appointed members like the
House of Lords. Now, let us suppose the Viceroy&rsquo;s Council [to be] made
in this manner. And let us suppose first of all that we have universal
sufferage, as in America, and that everybody,
<em>chamars</em>**<a href="#n07">/7/</a>**and all, have votes. And first suppose that all
the Mahomedan electors vote for a Mahomedan member, and all Hindu
electors for a Hindu member; and now count how many votes the Mahomedan
members have and how many the Hindu. It is certain the Hindu members
will have four times as many, because their population is four times as
numerous. Therefore we can prove by mathematics that there will be four
votes for the Hindu to every one vote for the Mahomedan. And now how can
the Mahomedan guard his interests? It would be like a game of dice in
which one man had four dice, and the other only one.</p>
<p>{12}[*<a href="txt_sir_sayyid_lucknow_1887_fwp0712.html#fwp12">12</a>*] In
the second place, suppose [[13]] that the electorate be limited.
Some method of qualification must be made; for example, that people with
a certain income shall be electors. Now, I ask you, O Mahomedans! Weep
at your condition! Have you such wealth that you can compete with the
Hindus? Most certainly not. Suppose, for example, that an income of Rs.
5,000 a year be fixed on, how many Mahomedans will there be? Which party
will have the larger number of votes? I put aside the case that by a
rare stroke of luck a blessing comes through the roof, and some
Mahomedan is elected. In the normal case no single Mahomedan will secure
a seat in the Viceroy&rsquo;s Council. The whole Council will consist of Babu
So-and-so Mitter, Babu So-and-So Ghose, and Babu So-and-so
Chuckerbutty.<strong><a href="#n08">/8/</a></strong> (<em>Laughter.</em>) Again, what will be the
result for the Hindus of our Province, though their condition be better
than that of the Mahomedans? What will be the result for those Rajputs,
the swords of whose ancestors are still wet with blood? And what will be
the result for the peace of the country? Is there any hope that we and
our brave brothers the Rajputs can endure it in silence?</p>
<p>{13}[*<a href="txt_sir_sayyid_lucknow_1887_fwp1318.html#fwp13">13</a>*]
Now, we will suppose a third kind of election. Suppose a rule to be made
that a suitable number of Mahomedans and a suitable number of Hindus are
to be chosen. I am aghast when I think on what grounds this number is
likely to be determined. Of necessity, proportion to total population
will be taken. So there will be one [[14]] number for us to every
four for the Hindus. No other condition can be laid down. Then they will
have four votes and we shall have one.</p>
<p>{14}[*<a href="txt_sir_sayyid_lucknow_1887_fwp1318.html#fwp14">14</a>*]
Now, I will make a fourth supposition. Leaving aside the question as to
the suitability of members with regard to population, let us suppose
that a rule is laid down that half the members are to be Mahomedan and
half Hindus, and that the Mahomedans and Hindus are each to elect their
own men. Now, I ask you to pardon me for saying something which I say
with a sore heart. In the whole nation there is no person who is equal
to the Hindus in fitness for the work. I have worked in the Council for
four years, and I have always known well that there can be no man more
incompetent or worse fitted for the post than myself. (<em>&ldquo;No, No!&rdquo;</em>) And
show me the man who, when elected, will leave his business and undertake
the expense of living in Calcutta and Simla, leaving alone the trouble
of the journeys. Tell me who there is of our nation in the Punjab, Oudh,
and North-Western Provinces who will leave his business, incur these
expenses, and attend the Viceroy&rsquo;s Council for the sake of his
countryrnen. When this is the condition of your nation, is it expedient
for you to take part in this business, on the absurd supposition that
the demands of the Congress would, if granted, be beneficial for the
country? Spurn such foolish notions. It is certainly not expedient to
adopt this cry —<em>Chalo Madras!</em><strong><a href="#n09">/9/</a></strong> <em>Chalo Madras!</em>— without
thinking of the consequences.</p>
<p>{15}[*<a href="txt_sir_sayyid_lucknow_1887_fwp1318.html#fwp15">15</a>*]
[[15]] Besides this there is another important consideration, which
is this. Suppose that a man of our own nationality were made Viceroy of
India; that is, the deputy of Her Most Gracious Majesty the
Queen-Empress. Could such a person grant demands like these, keeping in
view the duty of preserving the Empire on a firm and secure basis?
Never! Then how absurd to suppose that the British Government can grant
these requests! The result of these unrealisable and impossible
proposals can be only this: that for a piece of sheer nonsense, the
hearts of everybody will be discontented with Government; and everybody
will believe that Government exerts over us a tyrannical rule, and turns
a deaf ear to our requests. And thus anger and excitement will spread
throughout the people, and the peace of the country will be destroyed.</p>
<p>{16}[*<a href="txt_sir_sayyid_lucknow_1887_fwp1318.html#fwp16">16</a>*]
Everybody knows well that the agitation of the Bengalis is not the
agitation of the whole of India. But suppose it were the agitation of
the whole of India, and that every nation had taken part in it, do you
suppose the Government is so weak that it would not suppress it, but
must needs be itself overwhelmed? Have you not seen what took place in
the Mutiny? It was a time of great difficulty. The army had revolted;
some <em>budmash</em>es**<a href="#n10">/10/</a>** had joined it; and Government wrongly
believed that the people at large were taking part in the rebellion. I
am the man who attacked this wrong notion, and while Government was
hanging its officials [actually, &ldquo;while the Government officials were
hanging people&rdquo;], I printed [[16]] a pamphlet [*<a href="../00urdu/asbab/index.html">&ldquo;The Causes of
the Indian Revolt&rdquo;</a>*], and told Government
that it was entirely false to suppose that the people at large were
rebellious. But in spite of all these difficulties, what harm could this
rebellion do to Government? Before the [reinforcing] English troops
had landed she had regained her authority from shore to shore. Hence,
what benefit is expected from all this for the country, and what
revolution in the Government can we produce? The only results can be to
produce a useless uproar, to raise suspicions in Government, and to
bring back again that time which we experienced thirty or thirty-one
years ago. This is on the supposition that by all of us coming together
we could do something; but if you take the agitation as it is, what
could it accomplish? The case of Ireland is held up as an example. I
will not discuss the question whether that agitation is right or wrong.
I will only point out that there are at this moment in Ireland thousands
of men ready to give up their lives at the point of the sword. Men of
high position who sympathise with that movement fear neither the prison
nor the bayonets of the police. Will you kindly point out to me ten men
among our agitators who will consent to stand face to face with the
bayonets? When this is the case, then what sort of an uproar is this,
and is it of such a nature that we ought to join it?</p>
<p>{17}[*<a href="txt_sir_sayyid_lucknow_1887_fwp1318.html#fwp17">17</a>*] We
ought to consider carefully our own circumstances and the circumstances
of Government. If Government entertains unfavourable sentiments towards
our community, then I say with the utmost force that these [[17]]
sentiments are entirely wrong. At the same time if we are just, we must
admit that such sentiments would be by no means unnatural. I repeat it.
If Government entertains these bad sentiments, it is a sign of
incompetence and folly. But I say this: we ought to consider whether
Government can entertain such thoughts or not. Has she any excuse for
such suspicions, or not? I reply that she certainly has. Think for a
moment who you are. What is this nation of ours? We are those who ruled
India for six or seven hundred years. (<em>Cheers.</em>) From our hands the
country was taken by Govemment into its own. Is it not natural then for
Government to entertain such thoughts? Is Government so foolish as to
suppose that in seventy years we have forgotten all our grandeur and our
empire? Although, should Government entertain such notions, she is
certainly wrong; yet we must remember she has ample excuse. We do not
live on fish, nor are we afraid of using a knife and fork lest we should
cut our fingers. (<em>Cheers.</em>) Our nation is of the blood of those who
made not only Arabia, but Asia and Europe, to tremble. It is our nation
which conquered with its sword the whole of India, although its peoples
were all of one religion. (<em>Cheers.</em>) I say again that if Government
entertains suspicions of us, it is wrong. But do her the justice and
admit that there is a reasonable ground for such suspicions. Can a wise
ruler forget what the state of things was so short a time ago? He can
never forget it. If then the Mahomedans [[18]] also join these
monstrous and unreasonable schemes, which are impossible of fulfilment,
and which are disastrous for the country and for our nation, what will
be the result? If Government be wise and Lord Dufferin be a capable
Viceroy, then he will realise that a Mahomedan agitation is not the same
as a Bengali agitation, and he will be bound to apply an adequate
remedy. If I were Viceroy; and my nation took part in this affair, I
would first of all drop down on them, and make them feel their mistake.</p>
<p>{18}[*<a href="txt_sir_sayyid_lucknow_1887_fwp1318.html#fwp18">18</a>*]
Our course of action should be such as to convince Government of the
wrongness of her suspicions regarding us, if she entertain any. We
should cultivate mutual affection. What we want, we should ask for as
friends. And if any ill-will exist, it should be cleansed away. I am
glad that some Pathans of the N.-W. P. [North-West Provinces] and Oudh
are here today, and I hope some Hindu Rajputs are also present. My
friend Yusuf Shah of the Punjab sits here, and he knows well the mood of
mind of the people of the Punjab, of the Sikhs and Musalmans. Suppose
that this agitation that has arisen in Bengal — and I imagine that no
danger can spring from it there — suppose that this agitation extends to
these Provinces, to the Rajputs and Pathans of Peshawar, do you think it
will confine itself to writing with the pen — <em>giz, giz, giz, giz, giz</em>
[the scratching of a pen] — and to mere talking — <em>buk, buk, buk,
buk</em> [babbling]? It will then be necessary for Government to send its
army and show by bayonets what the proper remedy for this agitation is.
I believe that when Government [[19]] sees the Mahomedans and other
brave races taking part in this stupid agitation, it will be necessary
for Government to pass a new law and to fill the jails. O my brothers!
Children of my heart! This is your relationship to Government: you
should conduct yourself in a straightforward and calm manner; not come
together to make a noise and a hubbub like a flock of crows. (<em>Cheers
and laughter.</em>)</p>
<p>{19}[*<a href="txt_sir_sayyid_lucknow_1887_fwp1924.html#fwp19">19</a>*] I
come now to some other proposals of the Congress. We have now a very
charming suggestion. These people wish to have the Budget of India
submitted to them for sanction: &ldquo;Leave aside political expenses; but ask
our opinion about the expenses of the army. Why on earth has Government
made so big an army? Why have you put Governors in Bombay and Madras?
Pack them off at once!&rdquo; I too am of the opinion that their ideas should
certainly be carried out. I only ask them to say who, not only of them
but of the whole people of India, can tell me about the new kinds of
cannon which have been invented — which is the mouth and which the butt
end. Can anyone tell me the expense of firing a shot? Does anyone
understand the condition of the army? One who has seen the battlefield,
the hail-shower of shots, the falling of the brave soldiers one over
another, may know what equipments are needed for an army. If then under
these circumstances, a Mahomedan were on this Council, or a Bengali —
one of that nation which in learning is the crown of all Indian nations,
which has raised itself by [[20]] the might of learning from a low
to a high position — how could he give any advice? How ridiculous then
for those who have never seen a battlefield, or even the mouth of a
cannon, to want to prepare the Budget for the army!</p>
<p>{20}[*<a href="txt_sir_sayyid_lucknow_1887_fwp1924.html#fwp20">20</a>*] A
still more charming proposal is the following. When some people wrote
articles in newspapers, showing that it was impossible to establish
representative government in India, and bringing forward cogent reasons,
then they came down a little from their high flight and said, &ldquo;Let us
sit in the Council, let us chatter; but take votes or not, as you
please&rdquo;; can you tell me the meaning of this, or the use of this folly?</p>
<p>{21}[*<a href="txt_sir_sayyid_lucknow_1887_fwp1924.html#fwp21">21</a>*]
Another very laughable idea is this. Stress is laid on these
suggestions: that the Arms Act be repealed, that Indian Volunteers be
enlisted, and that army schools be established in India. But do you know
what nation is proposing them? If such proposals had come from
Mahomedans or from our Rajput brothers, whose ancestors always wore the
sword, which although it is taken from their belts yet still remains in
their hearts — if they had made such proposals there would have been
some sense in it. But what nation makes these demands? I agree with them
in this, and consider that Government has committed two very great
mistakes. One is not to trust the Hindustanis and [not] to allow them
to become volunteers. A second error of Government of the greatest
magnitude is this: that it does not give appointments in the army to
those brave people whose [[21]] ancestors did not use the pen to
write with; no, but a different kind of pen — (<em>cheers</em>) — nor did they
use black ink, but the ink they dipped their pens in was red, red ink
which flows from the bodies of men. (<em>Cheers.</em>) O brothers! I have
fought Government in the harshest language about these points. The time
is, however, coming when my brothers, Pathans, Syeds, Hashimi, and
Koreishi, whose blood smells of the blood of Abraham, will appear in
glittering uniform as Colonels and Majors in the army. But we must wait
for that time. Government will most certainly attend to it; provided you
do not give rise to suspicions of disloyalty. O brothers! Government,
too, is under some difficulties as regards this last charge I have
brought against her. Until she can trust us as she can her white
soldiers, she cannot do it. But we ought to give proof that whatever we
were in former days, that time has gone; and that now we are as
well-disposed to her as the Highlanders of Scotland. And then we should
claim this from Government.</p>
<p>{22}[*<a href="txt_sir_sayyid_lucknow_1887_fwp1924.html#fwp22">22</a>*] I
will suppose for a moment that you have conquered a part of Europe, and
have become its rulers. I ask whether you would equally trust the men of
that country. This was a mere supposition. I come now to a real example.
When you conquered India, what did you yourself do? For how many
centuries was there no Hindu in the army list? But when the time of the
Moghal family came and mutual trust was established, the Hindus were
given very high appointments. Think how many years old is the British
rule. How long ago was the [[22]] Mutiny? And tell me how many years
ago Government suffered such grievous troubles, though they arose from
the ignorant and not from the gentlemen? Also call to mind that in the
Madras Presidency, Government has given permission to the people to
enlist as volunteers. I say, too, that this concession was premature;
but it is a proof that when trust is established, Government will have
no objection to make you also volunteers. And when we shall be
qualified, we shall acquire those positions with which our forefathers
were honoured. Government has advanced one step. She has also shown a
desire to admit us to the civil appointments in the Empire. (<em>Cheers.</em>)</p>
<p>{23}[*<a href="txt_sir_sayyid_lucknow_1887_fwp1924.html#fwp23">23</a>*] In
the time of Lord Ripon I happened to be a member of the Council. Lord
Ripon had a very good heart and kind disposition, and every
qualification for a Governor. But unfortunately his hand was weak. His
ideas were Radical. At that time the Local Board and Municipality Bills
were brought forward, and the intention of them was that everybody
should be appointed by election. Gentlemen, I am not a Conservative, I
am a great Liberal. But to forget the prosperity of one&rsquo;s nation is not
a sign of wisdom. The only person who was opposed to the system of
election was myself. If I am not bragging too much, I may, I think, say
that it was on account of my speech that Lord Ripon changed his opinion
and made one-third of the members appointed and two-thirds elected. Now
just consider the result of election. In no town are Hindus and
Mahomedans equal. Can the Mahomedans suppress [[23]] the Hindus and
become the masters of our &ldquo;Self-Government&rdquo;? In Calcutta an old, bearded
Mahomedan of noble family met me and said that a terrible calamity had
befallen them. In his town there were eighteen elected members, not one
of whom was a Mahomedan; all were Hindus. Now he wanted Government to
appoint some Mahomedan; and he hoped Government would appoint himself.
This is the state of things in all cities. In Aligarh also, were there
not a special rule, it would be impossible for any Mahomedan, except my
friend Maulvi Mahomed Yusuf, to be elected; and at last he too would
have to rely on being appointed by Government. Then how can we walk
along a road for which neither we nor the country is prepared?</p>
<p>{24}[*<a href="txt_sir_sayyid_lucknow_1887_fwp1924.html#fwp24">24</a>*] I
am now tired and have no further strength left. I can say no more. But
in conclusion, I have one thing to say, lest my friends should say that
I have not told them what is of advantage for our nation and for the
country; and by what thing we may attain prosperity. My age is above
seventy. Although I cannot live to see my nation attain to such a
position as my heart longs for for it, yet my friends who are present in
this meeting will certainly see the nation attain such honour,
prosperity and high rank, if they attend to my advice. But my friends,
do not liken me to that dyer who, only possessing mango-coloured dye,
said mango-coloured dye was the only one he liked. I assure you that the
only thing which can raise you to a high rank is <em>high education</em>. Until
our nation can give [[24]] birth to a highly-educated people, it
will remain degraded; it will be below others, and will not attain such
honour as I desire for it. These precepts I have given you from the
bottom of my heart. I do not care if any one calls me a madman or
anything else. It was my duty to tell those things which, in my opinion,
are necessary for the welfare of my nation, and to cleanse my hands
before God the Omnipotent, the Merciful, and the Forgiver of sins.</p>
