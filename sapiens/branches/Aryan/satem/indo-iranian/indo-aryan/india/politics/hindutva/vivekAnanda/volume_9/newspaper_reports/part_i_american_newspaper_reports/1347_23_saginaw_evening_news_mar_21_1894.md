\[*Saginaw Evening News*, March 21, 1894\]

Swami Vive Kananda, the Hindu Monk, arrived this afternoon from Bay City
and is registered at the Vincent. He dresses like a well-to-do American
and speaks excellent English. He is slightly above the medium height, is
stoutly built and his complexion resembles that of an Indian. In answer
to a question by a NEWS representative, he said he learned English from
private tutors, and by contact with Europeans, who visited Hindustan. He
further stated that his talk tonight would be explanatory of the
religion of the Hindoo and to show that they are not heathen but believe
in a future state.
