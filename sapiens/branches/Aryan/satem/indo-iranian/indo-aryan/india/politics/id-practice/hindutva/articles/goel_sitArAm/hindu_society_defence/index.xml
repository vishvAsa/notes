      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;The Situation at Present&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In an earlier series, &lt;em&gt;Hindu Society under Siege&lt;/em&gt;, I had dealt with the forces which threaten Hindu society, and are striving to throttle it out of existence with aid and abetment from their international allies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I undertook, at that time, to write another series regarding the steps which Hindu society should take in order to break out of the siege, and snatch the initiative from its sworn enemies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;Sanātana Dharma Versus Prophetic Creeds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The one Vedic verse which modern Hindus quote most frequently is the third quarter (caraNa) of Rigveda 1.164.46 – &lt;em&gt;Ekam sad viprāh bahudhā vadanti&lt;/em&gt; (it is of One Existence that the wise ones speak in diverse ways).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The full mantra reads as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Indram mitram varuNam agnim āhuh,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;atho divyah sa suparNo garutmān,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;ekam sad viprāh bahudhā vadanti,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;agnim yamam mātariśvānam āhuh.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(They hail Him as Indra, as Mitra, as VaruNa, as Agni, also as that&#xA;divine and noble-winged Garutmān. It is of One Existence that the wise ones speak in diverse ways, whether as Agni, or as Yama, or as Mātariśvān.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;The Spiritual Centre of Hindu Society&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hindu society has had to go on the defensive against monotheistic creeds masquerading as religion mainly because it has lost consciousness of the spiritual centre round which its religious, cultural and social life has revolved, and which has sustained it through the ages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hindu society has failed to fathom the chasm which separates its own sterling spirituality from the “only true” creeds because it has fallen in love with a dead uniformity in place of a living plurality prescribed by its own spiritual centre.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>04 4 Hindu Spirituality Versus Monotheism</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;Hindu Spirituality Versus Monotheism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is an intuition ingrained in the Hindu psyche to inhabit our entire environment - celestial, physical, vegetable, animal, and human - with innumerable Gods and Goddesses. Some of these divinities are installed in temples as icons, and worshipped with well-defined rituals. Some others are worshipped as and where they are invoked. Hindu shastras, saints and sages have paid homage to many Gods and Goddesses in many sublime hymns.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;The Basis of Universal Spirituality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sri Ramakrishna was one day taunted by a sceptic that the Kali he worshipped at Dakshineshwar was only a slab of black stone carved into a bizarre female figure and decked with glittering trinkets. The saint was taken aback. So far he had not cared to see the sacred icon in its supreme spiritual splendour. He had been content to witness the Divine Mother in all Her majesty in the cave of his heart whenever he was in a state of &lt;em&gt;samādhi&lt;/em&gt;. Now he had been challenged to find out if what he worshipped was a figment of his fevered imagination.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>06 6 Revival of Universal Spirituality</title>
      <link>https://vishvAsa.github.io/notes/sapiens/branches/Aryan/satem/indo-iranian/indo-aryan/india/politics/id-practice/hindutva/articles/goel_sitArAm/hindu_society_defence/06_ch6/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;Revival of Universal Spirituality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Hindu and Buddhist Gods and Goddesses in India, Nepal, Bali, Burma, Japan, Korea, Sri Lanka, Thailand and elsewhere are only local expressions of a universal spirituality. In this respect, spirituality is akin to science. Astronomy, Biology, Chemistry, Geology and Physics reveal the same secrets of Nature to all men everywhere and at all times, no matter in what language those secrets are couched or communicated. In like manner, the spontaneous expressions of spirituality have been the same everywhere and at all times, though the language and metaphor of those expressions have been different according to culture and clime.  In the final analysis, they are variations on the same sublime theme.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>07 7 Starting Point of Universal Spirituality</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;Starting Point of Universal Spirituality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hindu seers and sages could tap the sources of universal spirituality because they did not start with an &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; assumption of an Almighty God whom man had to fear and obey in awe and objection. Nor did they fortify this &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; assumption with a framework of deductive inferences drawn from an observed order in the workings of the outer world. They never asserted that an Almighty God had to be accepted as a matter of faith as the creator and controller of the cosmos. Nor did they dogmatise that faith in an Almighty God could not and should not be subjected to the test of human experience and reflective reason.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;Christianity and Islam: Ideologies Of Imperialism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The story which I an now going to tell is true. I remember it word by word, although it happened twenty-five years ago.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A young Muslim sufi from Kashmir was telling us about the teachings of his &lt;em&gt;guru&lt;/em&gt; (this was the word he used for his teacher) who had died some years earlier. &lt;em&gt;Prāāyāma&lt;/em&gt; was a prominent part of these teachings. This again was the term he used, though he did not know even the Hindi language, not to speak of Sanskrit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>09 9 Character Of Nehruvian Secularism</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;Character Of Nehruvian Secularism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Twenty years ago I had been invited to a seminar on Hurdles To Secularism.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It was presided over by the late Shri Jayaprakash Narayan (JP). The Working Paper had been prepared by the late Professor A.B. Shah. It was a surprising departure from the usual norm of such papers. While he had repeated the current cliches about ‘Hindu communalism’, Professor Shah had been equally unsparing about what he had nailed down as ‘Muslim communalism’.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>10 10 The Trap and the Way Out</title>
      <link>https://vishvAsa.github.io/notes/sapiens/branches/Aryan/satem/indo-iranian/indo-aryan/india/politics/id-practice/hindutva/articles/goel_sitArAm/hindu_society_defence/10_ch10/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;The Trap and the Way Out&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was my intention to include in this series a few essays on Hindu Sociology and Hindu History as I see them after many years of study and reflection. But these themes would have to wait for some time. I will return to them later and discuss them with reference to Hindu Spirituality as I have presented it so far.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have received many letters from the readers of this series as I did when I wrote some earlier ones. Most of the readers have appreciated what I have said. A few friends have reacted against my repudiation of Monotheism. It has not been possible for me to reply to these readers individually in spite of a strong desire to do so. But I have felt immensely encouraged. The appreciation as well criticism confirms that there is a large number of my countrymen who are conscious of their spiritual and cultural heritage, and who are moved by more than mundane matters.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
