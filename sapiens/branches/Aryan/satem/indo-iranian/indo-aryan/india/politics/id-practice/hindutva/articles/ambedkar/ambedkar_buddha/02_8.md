> § 1 Conversion of a Vagabond
>
>  1. There was in olden times a certain disorderly person living in
> Rajagraha, who neither reverenced his parents nor paid respect to his
> superiors, but always had resort to sacrifice and worship of the sun
> and moon and fire when he went wrong, hoping thereby to get merit, and
> feel happy in himself.  
>  2. But notwithstanding all his bodily exercises, in worship and
> offerings, he found no peace, even after three years' incessant
> perseverance.  
>  3. He at length resolved to go to Shravasti to inquire of the
> Buddha. Arrived there, and seeing the glory of his person, he fell
> down at his feet, and said how he was pleased.  
>  4. Then the Lord explained the folly of animal sacrifice, and the
> senselessness of all such exercises where the heart was untouched, and
> where there was no final reverence or dutiful behaviour to those to
> whom it belonged; and in, conclusion recited certain gathas which,
> resplendent with glory, lit up the place and all the surrounding
> country with the brightness of his presence.  
>  5. On this, the villagers, and especially the parents of the
> children, came near to worship him.  
>  6. On seeing the parents, and hearing their account of the
> children, Buddha smiled, and recited these gathas:  
>  7. "The great man is entirely free from covetous desire; he dwells
> in a place of light, himself enlightened. Although perchance he meets
> with sorrow, he rejoices; without consternation, he exhibits his
> wisdom.  
>  8. "The wise man (bhadra) concerns himself with no worldly
> business; he desires neither wealth, children, \[n\]or possessions
> (land), always carefully observing the precepts, and walking in the
> way of supreme wisdom, he hankers not after strange doctrine (or
> wealth or honour).  
>  9. "The wise man, knowing the character of instability, as a tree
> in the midst of sand, (uses every effort) to change his friend whose
> mind is unfixed, and to bring him back from impurity to virtue
> (purity)."
>
>   
> § 2 Conversion of Angulimala, the Robber
>
>  1. There was in the realm of Pasenadi, king of Kosala, a robber
> named Angulimala, a ruffian whose hands were red with blood, who was
> always killing and wounding, and showed no mercy to any living
> creature. Because of him, what had been villages were villages no
> more, what had been townships were townships no more, and what had
> been countryside was countryside no more.  
>  2. From every human being whom he slew, he took a finger to make
> for himself a necklace, and so got his name of "Necklace of
> Fingers."  
>  3. Once when the Lord was staying in Shravasti in Jeta's grove, he
> had heard of the ravages committed by the robber Angulimala. The
> Blessed Lord decided to convert him into a righteous man. So one day,
> after taking his meal and after putting away his bedding, and then,
> with robes and bowl, set out on his journey to find the robber
> Angulimala.  
>  4. Seeing him journeying thither, neatherds, goatherds, ploughmen,
> and wayfarers called out, "Don't go that way, recluse! It will take
> you to the robber Angulimala.  
>  5. "Why, even when, ten, twenty, thirty, or forty people band
> themselves together to travel this road, the whole company falls into
> the robber's hands!" But, without a word, the Lord held on to his
> way.  
>  6. A second time, and yet a third time, those near there and the
> rest repeated their warning; but still, without a word, the Lord went
> his way.  
>  7. From some way off the robber saw the Lord coming and marvelled
> exceedingly that, where even companies of ten to fifty travellers dare
> not come his way, this solitary recluse should be seen to be forcing
> his way alone; and the robber was minded to slay 'this recluse.' So,
> armed with sword and buckler, and with his bow and quiver, the robber
> followed up the Lord's trail.  
>  8. The Lord, while he himself was proceeding at his wonted pace,
> the robber, for all his efforts, could not catch him up \[=catch up to
> him\].  
>  9. Thought the robber, "This is a wonderful and marvellous thing.
> Heretofore, I could always overtake an elephant, or horse, or
> carriage, or deer, when going full speed; and yet here am I unable,
> despite all my efforts, to overtake this recluse while he proceeds at
> his wonted pace." So he stopped and shouted to the Lord to stop.  
>  10. When the two met the Lord said, "I have stopped, Angulimala,
> for your sake. Will you stop following your career of an evil doer? I
> have been pursuing you in order to win you over, to convert you to the
> path of righteousness. The good in you is not yet dead. If you will
> only give it a chance, it will transform you."  
>  11. Angulimala felt overcome by the words of the Blessed One,
> saying, "At last this sage has tracked me down."  
>  12. "And now that thy hallowed words ask me to renounce evil deeds
> forever, I am prepared to give myself a trial," replied Angulimala.  
>  13. Angulimala threw into a deep abyss the string of his victims'
> fingers which he wore round his neck, and fell at the Master's feet
> and craved admission to the Brotherhood.  
>  14. The Lord, the guide of gods and men, said, "Almsman, follow
> me"; and almsman since that summons Angulimala did become.  
>  15. With Angulimala as his almsman in attendance, the Lord now
> proceeded on his way to the pleasance in Shravasti. At this very time
> the portals of King Pasenadi's inner palace were beset by a huge crowd
> loudly shouting that in the realm he had conquered there was a robber
> named Angulimala, a ruffian who was committing ravages and was killing
> and wounding innocent people and who took pride in wearing a necklace
> made of fingers of victims whom he slew. "Suppress him, sire," they
> cried. Pasenadi promised to run him down to earth. But he failed.  
>  16. One morning King Pasenadi went to the pleasance to see the
> Lord. The Blessed Lord inquired, "What is the matter, sire? Is there
> trouble with Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha, or with Licchavis of Vesali,
> or with any other hostile power?"  
>  17."No trouble at all of that sort, sir. In my realms there is a
> robber named Angulimala who is infesting my territories and harassing
> my subjects. I want to suppress him but I have failed."  
>  18. "If now, sire, you were to see Angulimala with his hair and
> beard off, in the yellow robes, as a pilgrim who kills not. steals
> not, lies not, eats but one meal a day, and leads the higher life in
> virtue and goodness,--what would you do to him?"  
>  19. "Sir, I would salute him, or rise to meet him, or would invite
> him to be seated, or invite him to accept robes and other requisites,
> or I would extend to him the defence, protection and safeguards which
> are his due. But how could the shadow of such virtue ever extend to
> one so wicked and depraved?"  
>  20. At that moment the Reverend Angulimala was seated quite close
> to the Lord--who, stretching forth his right arm, said, "This, sire,
> is Angulimala!"  
>  21. At this the king in his alarm became dumbfounded, with every
> hair of his body standing erect. Seeing this, the Lord said, "Fear
> not, sire; fear not; there is no cause for fear here."  
>  22. So the king's fears and alarm abated; and across to the
> reverend Angulimala he went, saying, "Is your reverence indeed
> Angulimala?" "Yes, sire."  
>  23. "What sire, was your father's family, and your mother's ?" "My
> father was a Gagga, sire, and my mother a Mantani."  
>  24. "Be of good cheer, Gagga Mantani-putta; I will take care to
> supply you with all requisites."  
>  25. Now at the time, the Reverend Angulimala having pledged to be
> resident in the wilds, subsisting on alms, and wearing clothes from
> the dust heap not exceeding three in number, he declined the king's
> offer on the ground that he had already got his full three robes.  
>  26. Then the king went across to the Lord and, after salutations,
> seated himself to the one side, saying; "It is wonderful, sir, it is
> marvellous, what a tamer of the untamed the Lord is, how he quells the
> unquelled, and how he calms the uncalmed! Here is one whom I could not
> subdue with cudgel and sword; but without either cudgel or sword the
> Lord has subdued him! And now, sir, I must be going, for I have much
> to do and attend to."  
>  27. "When Your Majesty pleases." Then, rising from his seat, the
> king saluted the Lord with deep reverence and withdrew.  
>  28. One day when, duly robed and bowl in hand, Angulimala had gone
> into Shravasti for alms, he was hit by a clod flung by one man, by a
> club flung by a second and by a potsherd flung by a third, so that it
> was with a broken head streaming with blood, with his bowl smashed,
> and with his cloak in tatters, that he presented himself before the
> Lord. Seeing him drawing near, the Lord said to Angulimala, "Endure it
> all, endure it all."  
>  29. Thus did Angulimala the robber become a righteous man by
> accepting the teachings of the Buddha.  
>  30. Expressing the joy of the bliss of deliverance he said, "Who
> shows zeal, where zeal was none, who with virtue clokes his past, who
> in youth to Buddha cleaves, he, like the moon, floods earth with
> light.  
>  31. "Let my foes hear this gospel, embrace this creed and follow
> wisdom's sons who cleave to it. Let my foes hear in season, love's
> message which is meek forbearance--and conform their lives to it.  
>  32. "As 'Finger Necklace,' I, bandit, lived and whirled
> downstream, till He brought me to land. As 'Finger Necklace,' I was
> steeped in blood; saved now am I."
>
>   
> § 3. Conversion of Other Criminals
>
>  1. There was to the south of Rajagraha a great mountain, distant
> from the city about 200 li.  
>  2. Through this mountain there was a pass, deep and lonely,
> through which the road to South India lay.  
>  3. Five hundred robbers had taken up their abode in this defile,
> who used to murder and rob all travellers that passed that way.  
>  4. The king had vainly sent his forces to capture them, but they
> always escaped.  
>  5. The Buddha, residing in the neighbourhood, and considering the
> case of these men, that they understood not the nature of their
> conduct, and that although he had come into the world to teach them,
> yet their eyes had not seen him, nor their ears heard the tidings of
> his law, he resolved to go to them.  
>  6. Consequently he transformed himself into a man richly dighted,
> on a well-caparisoned steed, with his sword and bow, with bags of
> silver and gold on his saddle-bow, and precious stones studding his
> horse's bravery.  
>  7. On entering the defile, loud neighed his steed. On hearing the
> sound the 500 robbers started up, and spying the traveller, exclaimed,
> "Never have we had such a prospect of booty; let us be up, and capture
> him!"  
>  8. So they proceeded to surround the traveller, with a view to
> prevent his escape; but on seeing him they fell on the ground.  
>  9. On their falling to the ground, they exclaimed, "What God is
> this?" "What God is this?"  
>  10. On this the traveller began to explain that such hurts and
> pains as they give and receive were trivial compared with the pain
> caused by the sorrow that rules the world, and the wounds of unbelief
> and doubt; and that nought but the wisdom resulting from earnest
> attention (hearing) to the Scriptures could heal such wounds; and then
> he added these words and said:  
>  11. "There is no painful wound so bad as sorrow--no piercing arrow
> so sharp as folly. Nothing can remedy these but an earnest attention
> to religious instruction. From this the blind receive sight, the
> deluded are enlightened.  
>  12. "Men are guided and led by this, as eyes given to them without
> eyes.  
>  13. "This, then, is able to dispel unbelief, to remove sorrow, to
> impart joy; the highest wisdom is the lot of those who hear."  
>  14. "This is the title of him who has acquired the greatest merit
> (most to be revered)."  
>  15. On hearing this the robbers repented of their evil lives, and
> the arrows, of themselves, left their bodies, and their wounds were
> healed.  
>  16. They then became disciples, and obtained rest and peace.
>
>   
> § 4. Risk of Conversion
>
>  1. In olden times, Buddha was residing in a country about 500 li
> from Rajagraha, full of mountains. In these mountains there lived a
> certain clan of about 122 persons, who occupied themselves in hunting,
> and fed themselves on the flesh of the animals they killed.  
>  2. (Buddha goes to the place and converts the women, who were left
> alone during the day, whilst their husbands were hunting, and then
> adds these lines.)  
>  3. "He who is humane does not kill (or, it is humane not to kill);
> he is ever able to preserve (his own?) life.  
>  4. "This principle (chu) is imperishable; whoever observes it, no
> calamity shall betide that man.  
>  5. "Politeness, indifference to wordly things, hurting no one,
> without place for annoyance--this is the character of the Brahma
> Heaven (or of Brahma Deva).  
>  6. "Ever exercising love towards the infirm; pure, according to
> the teaching of Buddha; knowing when sufficient has been had; knowing
> when to stop,--this is to escape (the recurrence of) birth and
> death."  
>  The women, having heard these words, were converted, and on the
> men's return, although they wished at first to kill Buddha, they were
> restrained by their wives; and, listening to these words of love, they
> also were converted.  
>  7. And then he added these lines.  
>  8. "There are eleven advantages which attend the man who practices
> mercifulness, and is tender to all that lives.  
>  9. "His body is always in health (happy); he is blessed with
> peaceful sleep; and when engaged in study he is also composed."  
>  10. "He has no evil dreams; he is protected by Heaven (Devas) and
> loved by man; he is unmolested by poisonous things, and escapes the
> violence of war; he is unharmed by fire or water.  
>  11. "He is successful wherever he lives; and when dead goes to the
> Heaven of Brahma. These are the eleven."  
>  12. Having uttered these words, both men and women were admitted
> into the company of his disciples, and obtained rest.
