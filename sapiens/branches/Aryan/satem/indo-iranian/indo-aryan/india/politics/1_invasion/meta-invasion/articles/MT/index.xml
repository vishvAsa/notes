      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.oocities.org/somasushma/aryans1.html&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A quick look at the ‘Aryan problem’&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;problem&#34;&gt;Problem&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the central issues of Indian history is the origin of the Indo-European speakers on India. An allied issue is the antiquity of the Vedas the oldest IE material from India.  They together may be termed the Aryan problem. These issues are of significance in understanding the development what is the only genuine surviving representative of IE culture today- Hindu or Indian culture. There has been a lot of coloration of research in this area by political movements in Europe and North America and Anti-Hindu bias. Nevertheless at least some European and Hindu scholars have attempted to tackle this problem with a fair degree of objectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For some people (may be like that BJP banker or the language guys) there might be an ideological issue. But their ideology is unclear to me. What ideology do they stand for? &amp;amp; how would denial/misapprehension help that ideology? My study of the H intellectual defects over years points to deeper issue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before we go there (&amp;amp; people will not like it) we must lay out something all of us are affected by:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I have zero cultural/religious attachment to it. Who were these people, what did they believe in, what were their stories? Just gone in the sands of time. All I have to relate to these Harappans is my blood (DNA) and common geography, and that isn&amp;rsquo;t enough.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

From today&amp;rsquo;s vantage a self-aware H (leaving aside the willful celebrators of counter-factual delusions) would see him with v.mixed feelings. On one hand he had internalized the humiliating rout of the marahaTTa host in the 1st war of independence; thus, in some ways, like the va~NgIya Vankimchandra, he felt that the intercourse with the ascendant Occident will revive in India a glorious IE civilization. He wrote this cringe-worthy eulogy to please his English overlords, particularly JB Peile whom he saw as a benevolent patron of the H.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
