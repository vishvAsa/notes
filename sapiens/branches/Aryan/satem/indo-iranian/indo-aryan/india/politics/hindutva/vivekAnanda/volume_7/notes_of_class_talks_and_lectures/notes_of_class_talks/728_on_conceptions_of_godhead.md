## ON CONCEPTIONS OF GODHEAD

Man's inner hankering is to find some one who is free, that is, beyond
the laws of nature. The Vedantins believe in such an Eternal Ishvara,
while the Buddhists and the S훮nkhyas believe only a Janyeshvara (created
God), that is, a God who was a man before, but has become God through
spiritual practice. The Pur훮nas reconcile these two positions by the
doctrine of Incarna tion. That is, they say that the Janyeshvara is
nothing but the Nitya (Eternal) Ishvara, taking by M훮y훮 the form of a
Janyeshvara. The argument of the Sankhyas against the doctrine of
Eternal Ishvara, viz "how a liberated soul can create the universe", is
based on false grounds. For you cannot dictate anything to a liberated
soul. He is free, that is, he may do whatever he likes. According to the
Vedanta, the Janyeshvaras cannot create, preserve, or destroy the
universe.
