Have just been watching "Ukraine Under Fire" and I must say that it is a revelation.
The parallels to the Maydan protests in Ukraine in 2014 and our own "Farm Laws" protests are eerily similar. Ukraine - Across its eastern border is Russia and to its west-Europe. For centuries, it has been at the center of a tug-of-war between powers seeking to control its rich lands and access to the Black Sea. The show talks about how there were three main pieces of any of these color revolutions

1. Money
2. Media
3. Tactics


The CIA has often used NGOs as a means of funneling money to various revolutions and regime change operations across countries. They did the same in Ukraine with various NGOs being funded. Three media channels came up within a day or two of each other and their content went viral. The whole range of media was used including traditional and social media. Politicians, social media stars etc were all brought into play. 

They also started to demonize the leader of the country. Painting him as far right and an out and out evil person, made it easier to sell the story to the west. Apparently, it was a decision taken during the Raegan administration that this was how to portray leaders so that simplistic Americans could be swayed. This also meant that any journalist or academic speaking out against them could be easily tarred with the same brush. Hence the comparisons of the Ukrainian President with Hitler etc, posters with Hitler moustaches on his face appeared.

Then they focused on how to keep the protests going. They got various entertainers etc together to entertain the crowds. There were TT tables set up. Food was cooked and distributed. Etc.

But that wasn't enough. They needed martyrs. So the crowd was first infiltrated by radical elements who transformed what began as a nonviolent protest into a violent one. They identified someone key who had recited poems. That person was mysteriously killed. Another lady journalist who was out to make a name for herself as a politician was beaten up and her face became the face of the protests. Meanwhile the radicals sparked action against the police and killed a few. The police retaliated and that furthered their cause.

In the midst of this, US govt officials, including John McCain and Victoria Nuland (she who was recently in the news insisting that the Russians would be the ones using bio weapons), kept not only visiting Ukraine, but also going to the protest site and promising US help. The protestors then started occupying govt buildings. Snipers (which the Ukraine govt denies were theirs) further precipitated violence. 

The Ukraine President says that he realized that the coup was pre planned. He left Kiev by helicopter with his motor cavalcade as a decoy. The motorcade came under attack. Apparently they were told to kill the President.

In light of this, I can now see the parallels between Shaheen Bagh, Delhi riots and the Farmer protests. Many elements of the modus operandi are similar. I now understand why the Indian govt took back the farm laws and why the PM said he was doing it in the interest of the nation. The same elements were there

- A) Money through various front organizations
- B) Punjabi entertainers
- C) Radical elements
- D) SM influencers
- E) Demonisation of Modi in the western media and press
- F) Indian media houses behind some of these
- G) The use of violence at Singhur and on Jan 26th
- H) the use of tractors. In Ukraine, they had used bulldozers against the police.

Don't take my word for it. Watch it for yourself and come to your own conclusions. If they are different from mine, I would love to know.
