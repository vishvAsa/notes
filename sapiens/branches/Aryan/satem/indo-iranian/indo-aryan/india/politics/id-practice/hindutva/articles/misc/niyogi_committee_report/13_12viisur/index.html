<p>KUSMI</p>
<p><em>The 10th June 1954 &ndash; 11-30 a.m.</em></p>
<p>Attendance-About 2,000 from 63 villages.  Forty Christians and rest
Non-Christians.</p>
<p>At the outset the Chairman introduced the members of the Committee and
explained the purpose of their visit.</p>
<p>There are three missions working-Catholic, Lutheran and American.</p>
<p><strong>Sukharam Uraon of Karmi Toli:</strong> Induced to become Christian by giving
him money.  A Christian Uraon purchases land in the village as a tri al,
whereas others (non-aboriginals) are not allowed to purchase.  If land
is purchased in this manner, he apprehended that there may not be enough
land for tribals of the village themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Father:</strong> Pracharaks move from village to village. Christians have a
special place of worship.  We teach gospel, generally St. John’s.</p>
<p><strong>Rajendra Prasad of mouza Harri:</strong> Complains against purchase of land
by Christians.  A Christian purchased the land of one Makan Miyan’s
daughter on Makan Miyan&rsquo;s death.  His wife has married another
Mohammedan and the daughter is living with her uncle.</p>
<p><strong>Budhwa Uraon:</strong> Christians have converted a resting place of cattle
(nistar land) of mouza Deori into a market place, because Uraons of that
village did not embrace Christianity.  Ramsunder Patwari confirms this
saying hat Christian villagers are asked to sit in that place for
bazar.  Villagers from Barwe Chhechari (in Bihar) come there.  They
observe Saturday market in that place since one year.  There is also a
sarna in that place.</p>
<p><strong>Bawna, son of Jetho Uraon of Gajadharpur:</strong> I had given an application
to Government for land as I had none for cultivation. I waited for three
years and later became a Christian (Catholic) with the hope that I will
get some land.  But I did not get any land and, therefore, again I
became a Hindu.</p>
<p><strong>Ramdayal of Ghulsinga:</strong> There is ten Christian houses in my village
out of a total of 80.  Two Christians came to the village sometime back
saying that they were Hindus, but they were Christians. Chaukidar’s son
was beaten by them.  They say, ‘We don’t care for any Government
officers and don’t obey them’.  I am treated as an obstruction in
Christian work because I do not allow villagers to become Christians.
They are Roman Catholics.  When I was beaten, I had given a report to
Sub-Inspector of Police at Kusmi He said he would come for enquiry but
he was transferred later. Domni, Tani and Binny beat him.</p>
<p><strong>Domi:</strong> I am a Christian by birth, belong to Ghulsi village and am a
Pracharak of Roman Catholic Mission.  Pay is about Rs. 30 to Rs. 35 per,
mensem paid by the Mission.  Father Francis of La tahsil pays it.  Has
been living in the village since two years.  Before that he was a
teacher in Adivasi School, Ambikapur, for one year.  Before that, peon
to Food Inspector. Before that, was living in his house in Barwe (Ranchi
district).  There was only one Christian house when I came to Ghulsi.
Now there are ten houses.  I converted eight houses.  I preach that the
world started with Adam and Eve.  I say that idol worshippers will be
ruined.  When a man agrees to become Christian.  I write his name in my
book, and then I take him to Father Francis after teaching him dharam.
Birsahay was converted by me last year.  He was taken to Father Francis
after one year since his name was written.  Till that time Birsahay was
making enquiries from his friends about Christianity.  I took him to
Father Francis after teaching him the lessons and giving him bath.
Father had been to the village himself.  Wife and three daughters of
Birsahay were converted by the father.  Six or seven families were also
converted by the Father with all their minor children after giving them
holy bath.  I get my pay irrespective of the number of persons
converted.</p>
<p>On 25th December, which is Christmas Day, we were in church.  It was
about 6 or 7 p.m. Chaukidar and jungle-chaprasi came there and asked for
a man to take his goat, which he had brought from Titartoli to
Chhapartoli.  The goat was brought walking.  We told him that we were in
Girja and, therefore, we could not do it.  Kotwal started shouting and
disturbing us.  Kotwal’s son was drunk and he beat Benjamin.  About 50
persons were busy in prayers. There were three persons with the
chaukidar’s son and jungle sepoy. He stumbled in the door and said that
we had beaten him and went away. Next day, Billuram was beaten when he
was sitting with his son in his yard. I did not report the matter to
police.</p>
<p><strong>Ramtapiram of Serangada:</strong> Pracharaks say that they will give cheaper
cloth to those who become Christians when they will have their raj of
Jharkhand.</p>
<p><strong>Bultu of Ambikapur:</strong> Nagesia by caste. Always had come to the village
saying that there will be Father’s Raj and we will not allow you to
live.  Pracharaks also come there.  He said that you have got your seat
in Delhi.  They said they would give land and cloth.  Some villagers
were converted in Gopati.</p>
<p><strong>Gangaram</strong> said that the Christian Father asked his father to be
present in another toli, but he was ill.  Therefore, he did not go.
Alwis, Pracharak, came to him saying that the Father had said Jawahar
Raj has come and there is no happiness to the people.  When Christian
Raj will come, they will get happiness.</p>
<p><strong>Khagnaram:</strong> I had been for the meeting in January 1954.  Elderly sons
did not go but children went.  Father from Gopati had come.  He said
that his religion was best of all, teaches children, gives land and
houses.  He said that Jawahar’s raj will go and our raj will come.  If
you don’t come in our religion, you will have troubles.  You will not
get cloth and salt.</p>
<p><strong>Alwaris (Alwis) Nagesia:</strong> I had been to Khangnaram’s house to call
people.  Petros Father was there for the meeting.  He did not say
anything.  About 50 persons were present in the meeting.  In the
Congress Raj, according to the Constitution, all religions are free and,
therefore, we have come to you to preach our religion and if you join
the Christian religion, God will give you salvation from sin.  Congress
Government is in raj, but if the raj is given to Catholics, we will not
take it.  He denies the statements made by others previously.  There was
gramophone and, therefore, children had come for the meeting,</p>
<p><strong>Petros Uraon of Ratasili:</strong> On the 3rd June at 10 a.m. six to seven
Hindus came in a jeep from Khatata.  They called the Fathers and said
that they would destroy the houses and everything of Christians.  He is
a Pracharak getting pay of Rs. 25.  My family is in Bihar. I have come
here since the last seven months.  I was called by the Fathers.  Belongs
to Catholic Church.</p>
<p><strong>Mohararam Marwa of mouza Khajria:</strong> Missionaries visited several
villages and also my village when there was cholera.  They asked us to
join their religion and they would give free and good medicine.  They
gave good medicines to Christians.  They took high prices from us.  They
asked as to whether a man was Hindu or Christian before giving
medicine.  Hindus did not get medicine.  They could get it only if they
paid high prices.</p>
<p><strong>Lohara of Jodhpur</strong> supports the above statement.</p>
<p><strong>Jairam of Jawaharnagar (Christian):</strong> One Tiwariram, Hindu Pracharak,
came one Sunday and told that he would not allow us to pray saying that
lie was sent by Government for this.  We did not perform puja.  Reported
the matter to Samri police station.  Ratiram, a Hindu Pracharak, had
come through the headmaster of a school.  He asked “Why do you keep this
(Jesus) photo? I will give you another Hindu photo”.  He took away the
photo, but did riot give me another photo.  The matter was reported to
Samri police station. I was converted to Christianity in Assam.  There
also there is conversion to Christianity.  There the Father is Father
Lewis of Catholic Mission.  Tiwari, master, is dead.  I had gone to
Assam on agreement for three years.</p>
<p><strong>Kandru of Kardar:</strong> Louis master was a Pracharak.  I had signed one
paper through mistake, but did not want to become Christian.  So he told
me that I should become a Christian.  He was threatened that he would be
removed to jungle.  Father will rule.  Deputy Commissioner, Tahsildar
and Inspectors were servants.  They will go away. Gaothia’s son is a
Pracharak.  He said that he would shoot him.</p>
<p><strong>Reverend Lakda:</strong> I am from Lutheran Mission and am an important
office-bearer.  There is no Jharkhand movement here.  Lutheran
population is divided in blocks.  Lutherans here do not share their
opinion.  Catholics are also divided.  Both Catholics and Lutherans are
divided on the question of Jharkhand and in both of them there are
promoters of the movement.  It is not merely confined to our Lutherans
only.  It is also the same case with Catholics.</p>
<p>European method of missionaries is that they have got a Home Board.
That sends missionaries and they are supported.  They settle down and
then they begin to work.</p>
<p>The Gossner Lutherans have no money.  We have cut off our connections
with foreign countries.  It is purely Indian.  Our method is first to
have a Christian congregation.  If the village is nearby, the whole
Christian congregation from one village goes to another village.  If the
villagers want us, we go otherwise we do not go.  They always welcome
us.  I have not come across any disapproval.  We start with Indian
Bhajans.  We then explain in a very simple language about Jesus.  We do
not criticise other religions.  Our headquarters is in Ranchi.  We do
this group sending several times and then if the villagers are ready, we
send our pracharak.  He begins to teach Luther’s catechism, 10
commandments.  So far I have not come across any opposition.  We would
like to live peacefully with our Hindu friends.  We run schools.  We
have got our High School near about Ranchi.  We have one school at
Ichkela and Sarahpani.  We don’t issue pamphlets.  Our main support is
Indian money.  We make an appeal and by way of Christian Charity, we get
money sometimes from individuals, from societies.  Last year, we got
about Rs. 60,000 for five provinces from Lutheran World Federation at
Geneva.  There is a combined society called National Missionary
Society.  Our church is autonomous.  We approached America through our
executive board, and received Rs. 90,000 from U. S. A. for one year we
received for Surguja area.  It is from the united body.  There is one
authority here in Guntur in South India and he receives money for this
area. From them we get the money.  We maintain accounts and they are
audited.  There are 60 to 70 pracharaks of my mission for the Surguja
area.  We pay about Rs. 40 to each pracharak (basic pay of Ranchi plus
Surguja allowance). Roundabout 1,500 is the population in this area.
Pracharaks are trained mostly in Ranchi, and now we are training in
Ambikapur.  We started with 15,000.  At Surguja, we have not yet started
a regular school, except a Bible School.  We give Rs. 30 as pay to start
with. We give from the Mission Fund and then we get it back from the
Government when it is recognised.  They allow us to teach religion
outside the school hours in the premises.  We get grants even though we
are Christians.  There are four missions in this area-Dubki (Baptist)
Mission, Roman Catholics, Mennonite and Lutheran. We have happy
relations with others.  Mennonites have about dozen, Catholics a
hundred, and the Swedish Mission in Baikunthpur, about half a dozen
pracharaks.</p>

<p>RAJPUR</p>
<p><em>The 11th June 1954.</em></p>
<p>Attendance-300.                    Villages - 19.</p>
<p>Twenty-seven signatories from Budhabagicha, Bisambharpur, Khodro,
Pampaur, etc.</p>
<p>The signatories say that -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) adivasis are Hindus,<br>
(2) Christians are not adivasis, and<br>
(3) they do not want Jharkhand.</p></blockquote>
<p>Attendance-300 (Four Christian Pracharaks and the rest Hindus).</p>
<p><strong>Itwaram of Patratu:</strong> Christians say that Jharkhand Raj will shortly
come and they will give cheap salt and cloth. Sankargarh preachers say
this.</p>
<p><strong>Solomon Minj of Roman Mission:</strong> I am a pracharak at Chargarh.  All
pracharaks come from Jashpur.  I get Rs. 25 as pay. I do not preach
Jharkhand.  There is one pracharak in each village.  The root (jad) of
Christians is in Rome city.</p>
<p><strong>Patel of Chargarh:</strong> The pracharak preaches prayers.  He does not say
anything about Jharkhand.</p>
<p><strong>Ramsahay Gond of Parsagudi:</strong> There is also preaching at Parsagudi
about Jharkhand.  Birsahay is the name of the Pracharak. He says, ‘If
you do not become Christians, we will call military forces to punish
you’.</p>
<p><strong>Kanhai of Karra, Uraon Gaotia:</strong> One Pracharak requested a house to
live in during the rainy season, but I did not give.  The pracharak
threatened me saying that I would come in difficulties.</p>
<p><strong>Gahemram Gond of Ukhra:</strong> Complains against the Pracharak.  The
Pracharak is paid Rs. 27 per month. Domnik, Pracharak, teaches girja. We
refuse to learn.  He says, ‘It is your pleasure’. I have been sent by
the Father for this.</p>
<p><strong>Bonry of Ambikapur:</strong> The pracharaks are working since the last one
and half years.  There are about ten houses in each village where the
pracharaks are working.</p>
<p><strong>Koyram of Lan, Uraon:</strong> Missionaries wanted to induce our children to
become-Christians by affording them education facilities.  The pracharak
in his village also talks of Jharkhand.</p>
<p><strong>Sankram Gond of Parsagudi:</strong> We did not get cloth, food, etc.
Therefore, we were asked to become Christian so that we could get it.</p>

<p>AMBIKAPUR</p>
<p>Attendance-300]                    [Villages&ndash;18.</p>
<p><strong>Bhanduram Uraon of Bhagwanpur:</strong> I say I am Hindu.  Christians say
that by being Christian, you will have less land revenue.  They say they
are educated and wise, whereas Uraon’s are illiterate and therefore they
are deceived by anybody.  My name is Bhanduram from my childhood.
Jashpur people come to my village.  The pracharaks coming are Uraons.
There are six houses in my village.  No one in my village has become a
Christian so far. Garhaipani, Batwabora and one more village have their
camps.  They visit six times in a year.  They are coming since the last
three years.</p>
<p><strong>Brahmaprakash Gupta:</strong> Received information that Christians come and
tell that you had been ill-treated by Hindus so long because their raj
was there.  If you become Christian, you. will not be ill-treated.
Pracharaks say that they have been instructed not to talk to we
(educated) people. They have been instructed to talk to adivasis only. I
have not heard any meeting myself.  So far as I know there are no
converts in my tahsil.  There were no Christians previously.  The
objectionable things which they say are-(1) If you become Christians,
the Christian fold will increase and we will be able to have Christian
raj and you will be happy. (2) The Congress raj will be going shortly
and the Christian raj is to come shortly; so if you become Christian,
you will benefit. (3) You do not become Christian, and your land will be
confiscated when there is Christian raj. (4) You will get many more
facilities in Christian raj. (5) All the tall talk about budget
provision for adivasis is only an eye wash and propaganda.  Tribal
Welfare Department is starting schools registering names for giving
loans.  There is no Hindu organisation doing welfare work for the
adivasis.  Kisan Mazdoor Congress does some work in this direction.</p>
<p><strong>V. N. Dube:</strong> A law student and a teacher.  Those who have become
Christians have not done so for the sake of religion, because they are
willing to come back.  A Christian comes and stays in the house of a
mukhia and tries to win him over. I am told that some were given money
(Rs. 5) not to restrict others from becoming Christians. 59 persons were
converted in Ganjhadeo which is six mills from Ambikapur.  Roman
Catholics and Lutherans are active there.  They were converted during
the last three years.  I do not know when exactly they were converted.
One teacher of Ganjhadeo named Maniram has been made a preacher and he
is paid Rs. 30 per month.  Whole families were converted.  There was no
opposition in the beginning.  But later on I understood from the patel
that he was again reconverted.  In Ratasili I met Father Francis Ekka,
Roman Catholic.  Hi said that Uraons are not Hindus.  There is Mundan
Sanskar in Uraons like Hindus.  Haldi is also practised in Uraons like
Hindus.  The bridegroom applies Sindoor to bride. Uraons have gotras.
Sagotra vivaha (marriage in the same gotra) is not performed in Uraons.
He said that Uraons eat beef.  I said that some of the Chamars do it.
Francis said Uraons are buried after death.  But so far as my
information goes, still today Uraons burn their dead bodies.  One Roman
Pracharak of Jamdi said he would die for religion and not for nation.
Objectionable features of missionaries are as follows.  They are
purchasing land in large quantities in villages showing thereby that
they are rich and tell them that you become Christians and we will give
the land to you.  In marriages.  Christians try to make one party
Christian, and they compel the other party to be converted.  Ganga
Dashhara is observed on the banks of a tank or river.  They immerse
tribal head dress (Marriage) and other things in the river.  They think
the water as pure as the Ganges.  Christians show that they are rich.
They tell the people that we will advance money.  They take their names.
They say they will not take interest. Those who are given money, are
asked to attend church.  Christians say that shortly they will have
Father or Christian Raj and they will be driven out and only the
Christian will remain there. Others will be driven away. I have heard
this. Preachers flatly deny this.  All preachers know what is Jharkhand.
Christians thought that with the abolition of States, they would be able
to convert people to Christianity and have their own raj. Shri Jaipal
Singh is the president of that party. They think of taking all the
merged States in one zone. Here the tribals are in a large number.  I
saw a Pracharak speaking to 10 to 12 villagers.  When I went there, he
kept mum.  Father Wanra said, ‘I do not support Jharkhand movement, but
I cannot say what my men talk’.  He said that Lutherans are in favour of
it.  My impression is that the Lutheran and the Catholics are both in
favour of it. They have divided the area according to the various
missions and they are all working in co-operation, though they do not
show it openly.</p>
<p><strong>Aryabandhu from Aryapratinidhi Sabha:</strong> I heard that there was an
agreement between the Roman Catholics and Lutherans to work in
particular areas.  Lutherans get financial aid from the Roman
Catholics.  Salbha village is about five miles from Baikunthpur, where
choti was cut off forcibly. Names of persons who were convicted for
forcible conversion shown.  He gives a number of complaints from several
forcible converts.</p>
<p>The work of Arya Samaj is going on m this area since the last six
months.  I have come from Nagpur. I do not blame the Christian
religion.  They should hold their meetings in the open and if they are
satisfied, they may be converted.  They are all illiterate persons.  We
take our meetings in the open and explain to them.  I preach Vaidik
dharma.  Baikunthpur is my centre.  Christians have opened one hospital
in Baikunthpur since about one year.  There they charge some fees. By
giving medicines, they convert people. I object to their becoming
Christians, because thereby they lose their nationality and are reduced
in number.  I have no objection to people remaining Muslims and
Christians.  But they should not adopt the methods employed by them at
present.  We teach a person Gayatri Mantra.  We do not show any
attraction.  So far only four persons have been reconverted. There are
30 Christians in my area.  I had no clash with any Christian.  Nobody
came in my contact.  I am 72 years of age.</p>
<p><strong>Bhimsen Chopra:</strong> I am a social worker and a correspondent. I have to
tour the whole district.  I have several Christian friends.  Two years
ago m Sitapur and Geturma, I came to know that Christians were telling
people to register their names for getting loans. In Pathalghon also I
saw the same thing.  I was given to understand that the Padri Saheb of
America had come and people would get as much as they wanted.  They were
going to Lipti, Pidia and Dhatgodi in thousands to get their name
registered with the agents at these places. Some days before I came
here, some of the people met me and I was informed that they did not
receive any amount though their names had been written. I saw an
application only the other day. I have got the letter and shall produce
it when required. I have got a magazine which gives this information.
Name of the magazine is Dhambandhu of the Lutheran Church.  Editor of
the paper is Rev. Lakda (Mr. Lakda says that this is correct). (If
copies of the last two years are available, they should he obtained from
Rev. Lakda).  There is a Mennonite Mission whose agent is Paul Avenger.
In Vishnupur there is a Korwa. His daughter has been kidnapped by a
Pracharak.  He had to pay Rs. 300 as fine because his daughter was
kidnapped.  I am a member of R. S. S. The purpose of the register is to
attract the adivasis to Christianity. (Abua Jharkhand of Ranchi).
Sanjivan of Patni of 2nd or 17th August 1953 contains an article of Shri
Francis.  Hindus are termed as Dikkus in that article.  I have got a
book of about 150 pages which gives instructions about conversion.
There is reference to Goa and it is said therein that the Goanese there
are very happy.  The present tension created in Goa is a mere show.
This shows then trend of mind.  They support Naga land movement of Assam
(Catholic Digest magazine). There are articles contrary to our religion.
Pakistan and America pact has been supported by this magazine.  This is
a Christian magazine.  Even an illiterate adivasi says that America has
helped us and our lot will be shortly improved.  In school a boy was
made Christian and was sent as a Pracharak.  He has given a statement in
the presence of prominent citizens of this thing.  Always Rai from
Belgium, informed me that if there is partiality against Christians,
then they cannot improve their lot unless the have got their own raj,
though personally he was against it.</p>
<p><strong>Rev. Ekka:</strong> 90,000 has reference to special building programmes.</p>
<p><strong>President, Tahsil Congress Committee:</strong> When Masih was A. D. C. here,
he appointed 36 teachers in Jashpur schools who worked as Pracharaks.
All the other servants also work as Pracharaks. Ratiram and Arjun,
Mukhias of Pankas of Surajpur tahsil, have been given Rs. 50 and 40
respectively, and told that they should become Christians.  While they
were performing religious rites after death, they were advised by a
Christians Pracharak that they should better become Christians, and
called bad names to Hindus.  Called a meeting of 2,000 Pankas on 31st.
They said that all Christians are well-to-do.  Hindu Brahmins do not
perform your worships, then why do you remain Hindus? The meeting was
called in Kaluwa.</p>
<p><strong>A teacher in Samri:</strong> In 1952 Mr. Masih removed some teachers from 7th
class and appointed those who had Mission School certificates.  I was
also removed from service.  A Pracharak from Sariwa has kept a choti and
says that he is Hindu.  He is at present staying in Kusmi.  In Gopatum
village Christians came with chotis.</p>
<p><strong>Yadubansa Narayan Singh:</strong> In 1949-51 he was in St. Xiever’s College
in Bihar.  There he saw discrimination against Hindus. They were not
allowed to perform Saraswati puja in the hostel, whereas Christian
students were allowed to perform their religious functions.</p>

<p><strong>Deopatram, Balrampur:</strong> I do not want to become a Christian, but
missionaries try to influence me by saying that shortly there will be
Jharkhand raj of the Christians and they will give salt and cloth, etc.,
at cheap rates.  You will suffer if do not become Christian.  Congress
Government is not giving you happiness.  There are no Christians in
Balrampur.  Preachers come here to say that you become Roman
Christians.  The preacher lives in Turidi.</p>
<p><strong>Iswariprasad Tigga:</strong> I am a teacher.  I live in Palamu in Bihar and
look after the work of teacher and preacher here.  There is a school in
Marwah Kappa. I visit this place once a month at least. I receive Rs. 60
per month. I belong to the Church of Christ.  There are six teachers.
They are also pracharaks.  There is also one missionary, Mr. Christie,
to supervise their work.  He stays here.  All Christians are from
Palamu.  He has come here since the last three years.  They are all
Uraons.  He is also an Uraon. I have passed Matriculation at Ranchi.
When Pracharaks came, there was no Christian here.  There are over 150
converts in my area, i.e., 60 to 70 families of Uraons.  We teach them
religion with their consent and when they grasp the things fully and
express their willingness, they are given a holy bath first, and then
prayer takes place and they are told that they have become Christians.
When a man becomes Christian his family is also supposed to be belonging
to Christian family.  Only the adult is baptized. We use magic lanterns,
gramophone and pictures to collect people.  The local people say their
religion is Purkha.  We do not say anything about his religion.  He says
that ghost troubles him very much and requests us to show a way for
betting rid of the ghost. I say that there is no ghost in our religion
and if there is any trouble, Jesus will drive away the ghost.  The
villagers also say that there are troubles by others,. e.g., in the form
of begar, taking away good things without payment or paying less. I tell
them that unless you are educated, these troubles are bound to recur.
So we educate ding schools also, they are not taught properly.  If we
have our own arrangements for schooling, it would be alright.
Therefore, we have got schools where we treat them properly.  Regarding
finances, we ask them to make their own arrangements.  If they do not do
it, we arrange it.  We do not charge interest and there is also no
time-limit for repayment.  We help the non-Christians also, but not so
much.  No land has been donated to us by any Uraon so far.. There is lot
of trouble to our Pracharaks in their work.  Hindus form a meeting and
oppose us after we leave the place.  This is our main complaint. I have
learnt this from my Pracharaks.  Hindus do not interfere so long as we
are having our meetings.</p>
<p><strong>Prabhudas Kashyap, Uraon Christian:</strong> Kashyap is my gotra.  Born
Christian.  Comes from Palamu.  I have come here since about three
years.  The name of our mission is British Church of Christ. Josi lives
here.  He is a missionary of our church.  I get Rs. 53 as pay (43 pay +
10 allowance).  There are rules for promotion.  Formerly, I was a
teacher in Palamu.  I was getting the same pay there.  I have done my
9th and teachers’ training course.  If a man does good work, he is given
more work.  I am in charge of one school and one village.  Palamu’s
headquarters are Bhandaria, 25 miles from here.  So also Balrampur.
Three or four people of Marwah had come to Palamu and they said that
they want a school at their place.  Bisram Kujur has come to Marwa with
two-three teachers.  He is a pracharak.  A school was opened there with
two or three students.  They had brought more teachers with the hope
that students would come from other villages and open schools there
also.  There are schools in three villages now at Sahapur, Tirtipara and
Karcha.  There are six villages having schools, and
preachers-cum-teachers.  There are no churches in those villages.  When
we have money we will have our church buildings there.  Now prayers,
etc., are offered in somebody’s house.  Nawabhandar is the headquarters
of this church.  We are abused by Hindus and also beaten.  They do not
directly attack us as Christians.  When we try to hold meetings, we
apprehend that the Hindus would not allow us to conduct them.  There are
three border-corden check people. I was arrested and asked to show D.
C.’s pass to stay in that place or also he would thrust the spear.  I
told him that according to the constitution everybody is free to
propagate his own religion.  Naka Sepai simply said that I should be
harrassed because I was a Christian.  I was blamed for smuggling 15
seers of rice.  I was prosecuted.  The Judgment is out now and they have
been acquitted.  We were also threatened by the Naka Munshi not to open
school. We were also troubled when we attempted to dig a well for the
use of the public in Deepan Uraon’s field. Patwari said that was on the
road and he harrassed us. We have dug the well in spite of patwari’s o
position and nothing has happened.  Four persons were prosecuted by the
Naka Sepoy out of 35 Christians.  There is a school in the village. I do
not know whether it belongs to Janapada or Tribal Welfare Dept.</p>
<p><strong>Basu Toppo Uraon of Marwah Jodhpur of Roman Mission. -</strong> A field was
given to him by gaonthia.  It was supposed to have been haunted by
ghosts and nobody cultivated it. I brought it under cultivation.  The
gaonthia wants the land back from me now. I paid him rent of Rs. 2-8-0
per year.  I had to face difficulties in cultivating the land. My
buffaloes died one year.</p>
<p>One non-Christian complained that gaonthia gave land to a Christian
instead of giving it to him though he is a tribal.</p>

<p><strong>Dhanuram of Jamora, Uraon:</strong> Christians say “We don’t treat the
Congress Government as Government.  We don’t care for Government
officers. If you join us, we will give you 12 yards of cloth in one
rupee.  We will give you salt, plough, bullocks and free money.  We will
have Jharkhand Raj within 10 years, when all will be converted”. The
Christian Pracharak who says this is from Patora.  They do not tell
their real names.</p>
<p><strong>Chamruram of Gagoli, Uraon:</strong> The word “Ram” is in my name from my
very birth.  There is Roman Mission in Patora.  They say that Uraons are
not Hindus.  Gandhi Mahatma has prescribed Christian religion for them.
There is Bhoot in the choti, so we should not keep it.  If we get
converted, ghost cannot trouble us.  Money allurement is shown. Fagun,
Karma, Dashera are observed by Uraons.</p>
<p><strong>John Lakda, Father from Patora:</strong> There are both Roman and Lutheran
Missions in Patora, which is 63 miles from Dhorpur.  He is under the
Bishop of Ginabahar, formerly Ranchi.  Gumla is the nearest centre, in
Ranchi from Patora.  Came to Patora on 8th December 1952 from Mandar (17
miles west of Ranchi) I am an Uraon born a Christian, educated in Ranchi
St. John’s School.  I went to seminary in Ranchi, and was made a
priest.  I worked in Ranchi, Jashpur (Tapkara, 1943-47), Genpur
(1948-50), then to Mandar, 52 December came to Patora.  There is a small
house having two rooms, in one I live and in the other we hold prayers.
In May 1952 I was sent by the Bishop to this area to have a general
look. I visited villages on the Ambikapur&ndash;Kharsia road, Rajpur thana,
Lakhanpur, with a view to find out whether the people would like to come
to Christianity or not.  They said that you are far away.  If you come
to stay with us and we know your ways, we will become Christians.  I
thought there was some hope.  I saw in them some sort of willingness to
become Christians to improve their lot.</p>
<p>They saw what facilities were there for education, medical help they
were given by Christians, paddy bank, etc.  I told a good many people
that the Christians were happy in other places I told them that we look
to the material welfare of the men and not only the soul.  I found that
the people were not educated. They did not know the value of schools. A
Roman Catholic priest was sent to Bania. I did not visit that area, 21st
mile on the Kharsia road.  He has got his own area.  My Bishop give the
areas.  Some persons had come in 1948-49.  Father Vanroy in Ambikapur
had come prior to my coming, i.e., about 1952 January.  He was in
charge.  He gave me an idea of where I should go.  Before I came there
were five Fathers in Surguja district. 30 Pracharaks work under me. I
gave a report in writing of my, experience. I said that if we go there,
there is hope. First thing is to make them of our faith, then we open
schools and afford other facilities.  A Roman Catholic preacher goes and
he asks them that lie is a preacher and whether they want to keep him.
If they want, they give him shelter; he lives there.  We tell them if
you want, we can send them to Jashpur or other places.  We have got
Mutual Aid Society to advance money.  In all the centres in Jashpur
there is Mutual aid Society.  All the members have to contribute.  A
certain amount is fixed.  For paddy, we call Dhangola; for money, we
call bank. We distribute grain on the basis of Sawai, ¼th extra.  With
the money collected, we give loans to the needy members. Interest is
given on their money to the members out of profit.  There is a Munshi
for each centre.  We appeal to the rich persons to deposit their money
in the bank.  They do not give to other Societies, because the amount is
hardly enough for the members.  They do not borrow from others.  Each
bungalow has a centre. One Father is appointed to advise each bungalow.
He advises whether money should be given or not; they have got byelaws
which are followed. In times of scarcity, we give for their consumption
also.  The Committee and the members decide whether money should he
advanced in emergencies.  Only Christians are members.  It is advisable
not to give to non-Christians. I do not get any pay. I get allowance.
Rs. 30 is given to each Pracharak.  A conveyance (motor cycle) is given
by the Bishop to those Fathers who have to tour much.</p>
<p>Bishop meets all the expenses in connection with cars, jeeps, tractors
etc.  We have got several Committees in foreign countries from which
amount is collected.  That is received here and spent by the Bishop.
Since my coming here, 100 persons have come to my faith, i.e., they are
baptized.  One-fourth of them are women.  If the parents embrace
Christianity, their minor children also get baptized.  Adult children
are instructed and they are baptized independently. There were 126
Christians before I came here.  They came from Jashpur to settle down.
There was not a single local Christian.  No material benefit has been
conferred on these 100 converts.  If they come in big nos., we can
manage for dhangola and grain bank.  The people who have come from
Jashpur have settled on lands No help to the bank from outside.  We do
not ask people to become Christians because it is blot our work.  Dhanu
is the proper Uraon name.  Because now they are counting themselves as
Hindus, they are putting the word ‘Ram’.  People receive us very well.
For half a year, we were peaceful.  Then gradually communists began to
stir the whole people.  They asked the man who gave the shelter, w it
was given and the man was threatened.  I am 40 and I have put in 15
years of service.  Any priest can become, a Bishop.</p>
<p><strong>A Lutheran Pastor:</strong> We have accepted Christianity by studying Bible
and we have been able to improve our lot in dress, education and money.
That is the evidence and our Experience.  I tell people that if they
want to share our improvement, they are welcome to Christianity.  Rev.
Kirpadan is the head.  There are six Pracharaks working under me in two
centres, Catholics are bachelors, Lutherans are married.  Catholics
respect Mary more whereas Lutherans respect Isa.  There is no conflict
between the different Christian sects.  No cases of Lutheran christians
becoming Catholics.  He was trained in Ranchi.</p>
<p><strong>Budhu of Parpodi:</strong> Pracharaks have entered his house forcibly.  I am
not being paid rent.  They are friends of Patora Pastor.  Nabib
Pracharak has entered his house (Pastor says this).  If he does not want
to allow we will not remain there.</p>
<p><strong>Another villager:</strong> Lunda of Nowdhia, who is a Christian, has taken
over the land of this boy (pointing out the boy).  It is on the border.
Since five or six years he has taken it.  The preacher of Lunda appears.</p>
<p><strong>Preacher of Lunda:</strong> I am a Christian of Roman Mission. (He is having
a chuti).  I became a Christian willingly.  I was not shown any
inducement.  Murti Puja is not required in Christianity, therefore, I
like it.  We are poor people and, therefore, we cannot afford it.  We
were told there are Bhoot and other things and we have to pay.
Government servants take begar from us.  We were doing begar formerly
and do it even now. I have a cultivation of one plough.  We may take
loan if required, but they will recover interest.</p>
<p>Each police officer has a confidential diary which gives a report of
Jharkhand every week.  We have no instructions to preach politics.  We
simply speak of religion and not politics.  We say there is God’s raj.
You find out his religion and you will get it.  We need not worry about
anything.  In God’s Raj everybody will have everything.</p>

Partiality in Government services. Christians do not merely convert, but also educate and help in development of the community. Uraons became Christians because of the treatment meted out to them by Raja Maharajas and Zamindars in the past. Uraons had their own religion before the Hindus or Aryans came to Middle Asia or India. They worshipped ghosts for protection against diseases.  Christians taught them salvation of soul which was lacking in their religion and, therefore, they embraced that religion.  Hindus have started the move so that different castes should quarrel among themselves.  Since Pakistan has been established, there is no chance for Hindus to quarrel with Musalmans.  Therefore, they are creating troubles with Christians.  Hindus think that they. alone have the right to take part in politics.  In spite of the Indian Constitution, there appears to be arbitrary rule in Surguja tribal area.  According to Christian religion, people have freedom of conscience and, therefore, they are not forcibly converted to Christianity but they embrace that faith willingly.  There are several religions in the world.  Therefore, it is not correct to say that Hindu religion is the only correct religion.  All religions should have equal opportunity to propagate.  It appears that the policy of Surguja district officers is to punsih Christians, to beat them, and to harass them in all possible ways.  They are also instigating people to put up false cases against Christians. A criminal case is going on in the court of law for the last 12 to 13 months and there is lot of harassment and expenditure in going to court, etc.</td>

<p>Attendance - 2,000.</p>
<p>Shri Malviya introduced the Committee and the Chairman explained its
purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Badiram of Jajga, a janpad councillor:</strong> Some Christians came to my
village.  I told them that we do not want to become Christians. On this,
they threatened.  We worship Ram and Krishna.  The Christians say, ‘The
Congress Government does not give land and wood’. I am a member of
Janapada. Christians move in numbers and abuse me.</p>
<p><strong>Jangsahay Michael Tirkey of Lalitpur:</strong> Roman Catholic since the last
two years.  Parents are also Christians.  There are in all 100, houses
in the basti.  Patel and patwari say that if people become Christians,
they will not get land.  Patel Nanusao also troubles.  The Pracharak has
come from Jashpur. I get an allowance of Rs. 5 per mensem as I help the
Pracharak. There are 12 Christian families in the village (on
interpellation by the people, he says that his parents are dead).</p>
<p><strong>Lodhi (new name Petros) Uraon:</strong> I am a new Christian. I have been
baptized.  My choti is not cut. Patwari threatened me saying that if you
become Christian, your land will be taken away.  He has land for three
ploughs.  I have the land from the very beginning.  My mother is not yet
converted.  Nobody has yet taken the land.</p>
<p><strong>Sarveshwarnath Kunwar of Sitapur:</strong> Missionaries kept their agents at
three places and announced that they will get loan.  I had also gone to
take the loan. I was told that so long as you do not become a Christian,
you will not get loan.  This condition was not announced before.
Alamsahay and Kanwarsahay made the announcement.</p>
<p><strong>Alamsahay of Bitwa:</strong> Pediawala Gaotia Kanwarsahay asked me to
announce that those who want loan should be asked to get their names
registered; I wrote the names of 60 to 70 persons.  Pratapgarh and
Sitapur people had been there.  Those people had been to Pedia. I did
not get anything for doing the work.  The Saheb who had come to Pedia
(he was a white man) said ‘If you become Christians, you will get the
loan otherwise not’.</p>
<p><strong>Kathal Mouza People:</strong> Inducement of education to children.  Asked
them not to send children to Government schools.  Christians were given
land to live first and helped him to steal wood from the forest.</p>
<p><strong>Sukhiram Uraon of Deogarh, cultivator:</strong> Belongs to Dubki Mission.
Christianed two years before. Rs. 30 per month pay since the last one
year.  He supports the statements made by others that he is threatened.</p>
<p><strong>Bhandariram, M.L.A.:</strong> In Manipur there was a Pracharak who was
staying in a house, the original occupants of which had gone outside the
village for work.  He was asked to vacate by them on return, but he
declined to vacate.  We collected people from the villages and asked
them whether they accepted the religion. The villagers flatly refused
it.  Therefore, the Pracharak was asked to quit the village.  Father
Kirpadani came the next day and asked people to keep him for some days
as he would teach their children.  Then the Father called me alone after
some days and told me that he was doing everything for the tribal
people.  I was also told by the Father that my tenure of M.L.A. ship was
very short as soon after the Congress Government was to go, and
Jharkhand was to be formed.</p>
<p><strong>One Kurwai:</strong> Reported that his wife was kidnapped by a Christian.  He
is Rao ‘Bhat’.  Christians tell him that he should not beg. He should
become a Christian and then he will get everything without begging.</p>
<p><strong>Soma Uraon Christian of Roman Catholic Church:</strong> Only four
representatives have been taken to the Nagpur and Delhi Legislatures.
More representation should have been given to the adivasis.</p>

<p>RAIGARH</p>
<p><em>The 13th June 1954.</em></p>
<p>The Committee held discussions with the Deputy Commissioner, District
Superintendent of Police, and the District Inspector of Schools,
Raigarh, in the afternoon of the 13th June 1954.</p>
<p>There were several complaints of non-recognition of Christian schools in
the district.  The District Inspector of Schools was requested to send a
comprehensive note on this subject, together with copies of relevant
correspondence.</p>
<p>2. The District Superintendent of.  Police gave in brief the nature of
crimes attributed to Christian missionaries.  He was of the view that
Uraon community was selected by missionaries for conversion because of
their poverty and illiteracy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) In a love affair of a Hindu boy and Christian girl, the boy was
asked to become a Christian and he was confined.  The case has been
reported to Government.</p>
<p>(2) Christians plough down places of aboriginal worship, burial
grounds, and abuse Hindu religion. A case is pending against a Father
of Ambakona for abusing Hindu religion.  The prosecution was made by
police station, Sanna.</p>
<p>(3) The Chief Minister was shown black flags in 1948.  The District
Superintendent of Police was asked to search the old records as it may
be required by the Committee.</p>
<p>(4) A pro forma of criminal cases launched was sent.  So far two
cases have ended in conviction and three are pending.</p></blockquote>
<p>3. The Deputy Commissioner informed the Committee that names of
students in Christian schools are changed.  This has come to his notice
recently.  School authorities maintain two registers.  He read out a
report in which a case of Gholang was given, where the student’s name
was changed.  All these cases were from Roman Catholic Schools.</p>
<p>Ever since the announcement of Boundary Commission, Christians are
making an open propaganda for Jharkhand.</p>
<p>The census figures show a very rapid change of Christian population.
For example, in 1941, there were 30 Christians in Jashpur, whereas in
1951, there were 9,000.  This was the case in other places in the
district also.</p>
<p>According to the Father’s letter, dated the 19th April 1954, he had
baptized a large number of people, but they were not shown as such in
the census figures.  He pointed out to the Deputy Commissioner that the
census enumeration system was partial.</p>
<p>Detailed information and notes on the subject of census were decided to
be collected from the authorities concerned.</p>
<p>In continuation of the same meeting, Shri V. G. Deshpande, Madhya
Pradesh General Secretary, All-India Hindu Mahasabha, was granted
interview by the Committee. Shri Deshpande wanted to know the procedure
and other details regarding Committee’s work.  He was told that the
Committee was not generally in favour of employment of lawyer by
parties, because it was not a judicial enquiry, though the Committee had
not yet decided anything in the matter. Shri Deshpande was also informed
by the Secretary that the complaints received by the Committee were open
to inspection in the Committee’s office in Nagpur.  The parties may also
take notes, if they require them.</p>
