This isn't true. 

First let's try to understand who Macaulay was arguing against. There were two camps who opposed his "minute" on education - 

1. The Orientalists - led by HT Prinsep, HH Wilson, Lancelot Wilkinson
2. The Vernacularists - led by Brian Hodgson, William Adam 

The strawman that is erected is that Indians would've been deprived of  "Enlightenment" advancements in Europe but for Macaulay.

But neither the Orientalists nor the Vernacularists argued for statism where education in India is untouched by advancements in the West. 

Orientalists - argued for a model where western science gets grafted on to the Sanskritic tradition, through translations which many of these orientalists were working on.

E.g. Charles Hutton's early 19th cen textbook on Mathematics was already translated (or being translated) into Sanskrit around the time Macaulay was writing his minute!

Lancelot Wilkinson's "Sehore" experiments in central India are another case in point where the heliocentric model was taught to local brahmins , and attempts were made to integrate it in existing brahminical learning, with successsful results!

Vernacularists - offered an alternative model where vernacular languages are used as media to teach the "new" learning from Europe. WIlliam Adam made the case that a large enough network of schools already existed in Bengal that could leverage learning material in vernacular languages. 

This is consistent with the observations of later scholars like Dharampal and even contemporaries of that period like Thomas Munro in Madras.

The Orientalists and Vernacularists lost the battle. Macaulay triumphed. The result was not some resounding success we all should be proud of. It essentially had a negative impact on education and literacy rates at the mass level with closure of traditional schools, creating a small elite (exactly as Macaulay envisaged). 

Even as late as 1931, Indian literacy rate was barely 9%. Likely not a big improvement from say a century earlier. Probably even a decrease (though I don't have data to back this)

W.r.t. Macaulay's comments on single shelf of Europe vs entire Sanskrit corpus : No need to beat yourself up and wallow in shame. There were many areas where existing Indian knowledge held its own, and areas where it didn't. 

The Scientific Revolution of 17th and 18th cen was a unique event. India caught up with it more slowly than it might have otherwise, thanks to Macaulay.

Macaulay's minute suited Britain the best, because his goal wasn't "enlightenment" of India, but to create a class of anglo-literate people in India who could run the lower rungs of government. Instead of importing expensive labor from Britain. In that respect, his minute made perfect sense to the powers that be.
