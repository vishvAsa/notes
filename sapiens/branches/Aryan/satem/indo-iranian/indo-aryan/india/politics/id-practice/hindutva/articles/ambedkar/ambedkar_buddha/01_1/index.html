<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Going back to the sixth century B.C., Northern India did not
form a single Sovereign State.</li>
<li>The country was divided into many States, some large, some
small. Of these, some were monarchical and some non-monarchical.</li>
<li>The monarchical States were altogether sixteen in number. They
were known by the name[s] of Anga, Magadha, Kasi, Kosala, Vriji,
Malla, Chedi, Vatsa, Kuru, Panchala, Matsya, Saursena, Asmaka, Avanti,
Gandhara, and Kambhoja.</li>
<li>The non-monarchical States were those of the Sakyas of
Kapilvastu, the Mallas of Pava and Kushinara, the Lichhavis of
Vaisali, the Videhas of Mithila, the Koliyas of Ramagam, the Bulis of
Allakapa, the Kalingas of Resaputta, the Mauriyas of Pipphalvana, and
the Bhaggas with their capital on Sumsumara Hill.</li>
<li>The monarchical States were known as Janapada, and the
non-monarchical as Sangh or Gana.</li>
<li>Not much is known about the nature of the polity of the Sakyas
of Kapilvatsu, whether it was republican or oligarchic.</li>
<li>This much, however, is definitely known, that there were many
ruling families in the Republic of the Sakyas, and that they ruled in
turns.</li>
<li>The head of the ruling family was known as Raja.</li>
<li>At the time of the birth of Siddharth Gautama, it was the turn
of Suddhodana to be the Raja.</li>
<li>The Sakya State was situated in the northeast corner of India.
It was an independent State. But at a later stage the King of Kosala
had succeeded in establishing his paramountcy over it.</li>
<li>The result of this paramountcy was that the Sakya State could
not exercise certain sovereign powers without the sanction of the King
of Kosala.</li>
<li>Of the kingdoms then in existence, Kosala was a powerful
kingdom. So was the kingdom of Magadha. Pasanedi, King of Kosala, and
Bimbisara, King of Magadha, were the contemporaries of Siddharth
Gautama.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 2. His Ancestry</p>
<ol>
<li>The capital of the Sakyas was the city called Kapilavatsu,
perhaps after the name of the great Rationalist Kapila.</li>
<li>There lived in Kapilavastu a Sakya, by name Jaya Sena. Sinahu
was his son. Sinahu was married to Kaccana. Sinahu had five sons,
Suddhodana, Dhotodana, Sakkodana, Suklodana, and Amitodana. Besides
five sons, Sinahu had two daughters, Amita and Pamita.</li>
<li>The Gotra of the family was Aditya.</li>
<li>Suddhodana was married to Mahamaya. Her father&rsquo;s name was
Anjana, and mother&rsquo;s Sulakshana. Anjana was a Koliya, and was residing
in the village called Devadaha.</li>
<li>Suddhodana was a man of great military prowess. When Suddhodana
had shown his martial powers, he was allowed to take a second wife,
and he chose Mahaprajapati. She was the elder sister of Mahamaya.</li>
<li>Suddhodana was a wealthy person. The lands he held were very
extensive, and the retinue under him was very large. He employed, it
is said, one thousand ploughs to till the land he owned.</li>
<li>He lived quite a luxurious life and had many palaces.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 3. His Birth</p>
<ol>
<li>To Suddhodana was born Siddharth Gautama, and this was the
manner of Gautama&rsquo;s birth.</li>
<li>It was a custom among the Sakyas to observe an annual midsummer
festival which fell in the month of Ashad. It was celebrated by all
the Sakyas throughout the State, and also by the members of the ruling
family.</li>
<li>It was the usual practice to celebrate the festival for seven
days.</li>
<li>On one occasion Mahamaya decided to observe the festival with
gaiety, with splendour, with flowers, with perfume, but without
drinking intoxicants.</li>
<li>On the seventh day she rose early, bathed in scented water,
bestowed a gift of 4,00,000 pieces of money as alms, adorned herself
with all precious ornaments, ate [the] choicest food, took upon
herself the fast-day vows, and entered the splendidly adorned royal
bedchamber to sleep.</li>
<li>That night Suddhodana and Mahamaya came together, and Mahamaya
conceived. Lying on the royal bed, she fell asleep. While asleep she
had a dream.</li>
<li>In her dreams she saw that the four world-guardians raised her
as she was sleeping on her bed and carried her to the tableland of
the Himalayas, placed her under a great sal tree, and stood on one
side.</li>
<li>The wives of the four world-guardians then approached, and took
her to the lake Mansarovar.</li>
<li>They bathed her, robed her in a dress, anointed her with
perfumes, and decked her with flowers in a manner fit to meet some
divinity.</li>
<li>Then a Bodhisatta, by name Sumedha, appeared before her
saying, &ldquo;I have decided to take my last and final birth on this earth,
will you consent to be my mother?&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;Yes, with great
pleasure.&rdquo; At this moment Mahamaya awoke.</li>
<li>Next morning Mahamaya told her dream to Suddhodana. Not
knowing how to interpret the dream, Suddhodana summoned eight Brahmins
who were most famous in divination.</li>
<li>They were Rama, Dhaga, Lakkana, Manti, Yanna, Suyama, Subhoga,
and Sudatta and prepared for them a befitting reception.</li>
<li>He caused the ground to be strewn with festive flowers, and
prepared high seats for them.</li>
<li>He filled the bowls of the Brahmins with gold and silver, and
fed them on cooked ghee, honey, sugar, and excellent rice and milk. He
also gave them other gifts, such as new clothes and tawny cows.</li>
<li>When the Brahmins were propitiated, Suddhodana related to them
the dream Mahamaya had [had], and said, &quot; Tell me what it means.&quot;</li>
<li>The Brahmins said, &ldquo;Be not anxious. You will have a son, and
if he leads a householder&rsquo;s life he will become a universal monarch,
and if he leaves his home and goes forth into a homeless state, and
becomes a sanyasi, he will become a Buddha, a dispeller of illusions
in the world.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Bearing the Bodhisatta in her womb like oil in a vessel for
ten lunar months, Mahamaya, as her time of delivery was coming nearer,
desired to go to her parents&rsquo; home for delivery. Addressing her
husband, she said, &quot; I wish to go to Devadaha, the city of my
father.&quot;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Thou knowest that thy wishes will be done,&rdquo; replied
Suddhodana. Having seated her in a golden palanquin borne by couriers,
he sent her forth with a great retinue to her father&rsquo;s house.</li>
<li>Mahamaya, on her way to Devadaha, had to pass through a
pleasure-grove of sal trees and other trees, flowering and
non-flowering. It was known as the Lumbini Grove.</li>
<li>As the palanquin was passing through it, the whole Lumbini
Grove seemed like the heavenly Cittalata grove or like a banqueting
pavilion adorned for a mighty king.</li>
<li>From the roots to the tips of the branches the trees were
loaded with fruits, flowers and numberless bees of the fine colours,
uttering curious sounds, and flocks of various kinds of birds, singing
sweet melodies.</li>
<li>Witnessing the scene, there arose a desire in the heart of
Mahamaya for halting and sporting therein for a while. Accordingly she
told the couriers to take her in[to] the sal-grove and wait there.</li>
<li>Mahamaya alighted from her palanquin and walked up to the foot
of a royal sal tree. A pleasant wind, not too strong, was blowing, and
the boughs of the trees were heaving up and down, and Mahamaya felt
like catching one of them.</li>
<li>Luckily one of the boughs heaved down sufficiently low to
enable her to catch it. So she rose on her toes and caught the bough.
Immediately she was lifted up by its upward movement, and being
shaken, she felt the pangs of childbirth. While holding the branch of
the sal tree she was delivered of a son in a standing position.</li>
<li>The child was born in the year 563 B.C. on the Vaishakha
Paurnima day.</li>
<li>Suddhodana and Mahamaya were [=had been] married for a long
time. But they had no issue. Ultimately [=finally] when a son was
born to them, his birth was celebrated with great rejoicing, with
great pomp and ceremony, by Suddhodana and his family and also by the
Sakyas.</li>
<li>At the time of the birth of the child it was the turn of
Suddhodana to be the ruler of Kapilavatsu, and as such [he] was in
the enjoyment of the title of Raja. Naturally the boy was called
Prince.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 4. Visit by Asita</p>
<ol>
<li>At the moment when the child was born, there dwelt on the
Himalayas a great sage named Asita.</li>
<li>Asita heard that the gods over the space of the sky were
shouting the word &ldquo;Buddha&rdquo; and making it resound. He beheld them
waving their garments and coursing hither and thither in delight. He
thought, what if I were to go and find out the land in which he was
born?</li>
<li>Surveying with his divine eyes the whole of the Jambudvipa,
Asita saw that a boy was born in the house of Suddhodana, shining with
all brilliance, and that it was over his birth that the gods were
excited.</li>
<li>So the great sage Asita, with his nephew Nardatta, rose up and
came to the abode of Raja Suddhodana, and stood at the door of his
palace.</li>
<li>Now Asita, the sage, saw that at the door of Suddhodana&rsquo;s
palace many hundred thousand beings had assembled. So he approached
the door-keeper and said, &ldquo;Go, man, inform the Raja that a sage is
standing at the door.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Then the door-keeper approached Suddhodana and with clasped
hands said, &ldquo;Know, O Raja, that an aged sage, old and advanced in
years, stands at the door, and says that he desires to see you.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The king prepared a seat for Asita and said to the door-keeper,
&ldquo;Let the sage enter.&rdquo; So coming out of the palace the door-keeper said
to Asita, &ldquo;Please go in.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Now Asita approached King Suddhodana and, standing in front of
him, said, &ldquo;Victory, Victory, O Raja, may you live long, and rule thy
kingdom righteously.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Then Suddhodana in reverence to Asita fell at his feet and
offered him the seat; and seeing him seated in comfort, Suddhodana
said, &ldquo;I do not remember to have seen thee before this, O Sage! With
what purpose has thou come hither? What is the cause?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Thereupon Asita said to Suddhodana, &ldquo;A son is born to thee, O
Raja! Desiring to see him, have I come.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Suddhodana said, &ldquo;The boy is asleep, O Sage! Will you wait for
a while? &quot; The sage said, &ldquo;Not long, O King, do such great beings
sleep. Such good beings are by nature wakeful.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Then did the child, out of compassion for Asita, the great
sage, make a sign of awaking.</li>
<li>Seeing that the child had become awake, Suddhodana took the
boy firmly in both hands and brought him into the presence of the
sage.</li>
<li>Asita, observing the child, beheld that it was endowed with
the thirty-two marks of a great man and adomed with the eighty minor
marks, his body surpassing that of Sakra [and] Brahma, and his aura
surpassing them a hundred thousand-fold [he] breathed forth this
solemn utterance, &ldquo;Marvellous, verily, is this person that has
appeared in the world,&rdquo; and rising from his seat clasped his hands,
fell at his feet, made a rightwise circuit round, and taking the child
in his own hand stood in contemplation.</li>
<li>Asita knew the old well-known prophecy that anyone endowed
with the thirty-two marks of a great man, as Gautama was, has two
careers open to him, and no third. &ldquo;If he becomes a householder, he
will become a universal monarch. But if he goes forth from the home to
a homeless life, he will become a fully enlightened Buddha.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Asita was sure that the child would not remain a
householder.</li>
<li>And looking at the child he wept, and shedding tears, sighed
deeply.</li>
<li>Suddhodana beheld Asita shedding tears, and sighing deeply.</li>
<li>Beholding him thus weeping, the hair of his body rose, and in
distress Suddhodana said to Asita, &ldquo;Why, O Sage, dost thou weep and
shed tears, and sigh so deeply? Surely, there is no misfortune in
store for the child.&rdquo;</li>
<li>At this Asita said to the Raja, &ldquo;O King, I weep not for the
sake of the child. There will be no misfortune for him. But I weep for
myself.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;And why?&rdquo; asked Suddhodana. Asita replied, &ldquo;I am old, aged,
advanced in years, and this boy will without doubt become a Buddha and
attain supreme and complete enlightenment; and having done so, will
turn the supreme wheel of the Doctrine that has not been turned before
him by any other being in the world; for the weal and happiness of the
world will he teach his Doctrine.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The religious life, the Doctrine, that he will proclaim will
be good in the beginning, good in the middle, good in the end,
complete in the letter and the spirit, whole and pure.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Just as an Oudumbara flower at some time and place arises in
the world, even so at some time and place, after countless cycles,
revered Buddhas arise in the world. So also, O Raja! this boy will
without doubt obtain supreme, complete enlightenment, and having done
so will take countless beings across the ocean of sorrow and misery to
a state of happiness.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&quot; But I shall not see that Buddha. Hence, O Raja, I weep, and
in sadness I sigh deeply, for I shall not be able to reverence him.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The king thereafter offered to the great sage Asita and
Nardatta, his nephew, suitable food, and having given him robes, made
a rightwise circuit round him.</li>
<li>Thereupon Asita said to Nardatta, his nephew, &ldquo;When thou shalt
hear, Nardatta, that the child has become a Buddha, then go and take
refuge in his teachings. This shall be for thy weal and welfare and
happiness.&rdquo; So saying, Asita took leave of the Raja and departed for
his hermitage.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 5. Death of Mahamaya</p>
<ol>
<li>On the fifth day, the ceremony of name-giving took place. The
name chosen for the child was Siddharth. His clan name was Gautama.
Popularly, therefore, he came to be called Siddharth Gautama.</li>
<li>In the midst of rejoicing over the birth and the naming of the
child, Mahamaya suddenly fell ill, and her illness became very
serious.</li>
<li>Realising that her end was near, she called Suddhodana and
Prajapati to her bedside and said, &quot; I am sure that the prophecy made
by Asita about my son will come true. My regret is that I will not
live to see it fulfilled.&quot;</li>
<li>&ldquo;My child will soon be a motherless child. But I am not worried
in the least as to whether after me my child will be carefully nursed,
properly looked after, and brought up in a manner befitting his
future.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;To you, Prajapati, I entrust my child; I have no doubt that
you will be to him more than his mother.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Now do not be sorry. Permit me to die. God&rsquo;s call has come,
and His messengers are waiting to take me.&rdquo; So saying, Mahamaya
breathed her last. Both Suddhodana and Prajapati were greatly grieved
and wept bitterly.</li>
<li>Siddharth was only seven days old when his mother died.</li>
<li>Siddharth had a younger brother, by name Nanda. He was the son
of Suddhodana, born to Mahaprajapati.</li>
<li>He had also several cousins, Mahanama and Anuruddha, sons of
his uncle Suklodan; Ananda, son of his uncle Amitodan; and Devadatta,
son of his aunt Amita. Mahanama was older than Siddharth, and Ananda
was younger.</li>
<li>Siddharth grew up in their company.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 6. Childhood and Education</p>
<ol>
<li>When Siddharth was able to walk and speak, the elders of the
Sakyas assembled and asked Suddhodana that the boy should be taken to
the temple of the village goddess Abhya.</li>
<li>Suddhodana agreed, and asked Mahaprajapati to dress the boy.</li>
<li>While she was doing so the child Siddharth, with a most sweet
voice, asked his aunt where he was being taken. On learning that he
was being taken to the temple, he smiled. But he went, conforming to
the custom of the Sakyas.</li>
<li>At the age of eight, Siddharth started his education.</li>
<li>Those very eight Brahmins whom Suddhodana had invited to
interpret Mahamaya&rsquo;s dream, and who had predicted his future, were his
first teachers.</li>
<li>After they had taught him what they knew, Suddhodana sent for
Sabbamitta of distinguished descent and of high lineage in the land of
Uddikka, a philologist and grammarian, well read in the <strong>Veda</strong>s,
<strong>Vedanga</strong>s, and <strong>Upanishad</strong>s. Having poured out water of
dedication from a golden vase, Suddhodana handed over the boy to his
charge, to be taught. He was his second teacher.</li>
<li>Under him Gautama mastered all the philosophic systems
prevalent in his day.</li>
<li>Besides this, he had learned the science of concentration and
meditation from one Bhardawaj, a disciple of Alara Kalam, who had his
ashram at Kapilavatsu.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 7. Early Traits</p>
<ol>
<li>Whenever he went to his father&rsquo;s farm and found no work, he
repaired to a quiet place, and practised meditation.</li>
<li>While everything for the cultivation of the mind was provided,
his education in the military science befitting a Kshatriya was not
neglected.</li>
<li>For Suddhodana was anxious not to make the mistake of having
cultivated the mind of his son at the cost of his manliness.</li>
<li>Siddharth was of kindly disposition. He did not like
exploitation of man by man.</li>
<li>Once he went to his father&rsquo;s farm with some of his friends, and
saw the labourers ploughing the land, raising bunds, cutting trees,
etc., dressed in scanty clothes under a hot burning sun.</li>
<li>He was greatly moved by the sight.</li>
<li>He said to his friends, can it be right that one man should
exploit another? How can it be right that the labourer should toil,
and the master should live on the fruits of his labour?</li>
<li>His friends did not know what to say. For they believed in the
old philosophy of life that the worker was born to serve, and that in
serving his master he was only fulfilling his destiny.</li>
<li>The Sakyas used to celebrate a festival called Vapramangal. It
was a rustic festival performed on the day of sowing. On this day,
custom had made it obligatory on every Sakya to do ploughing
personally.</li>
<li>Siddharth always observed the custom, and did engage himself
in ploughing.</li>
<li>Though a man of learning, he did not despise manual labour.</li>
<li>He belonged to a warrior class, and had been taught archery
and the use of weapons. But he did not like causing unnecessary
injury.</li>
<li>He refused to join hunting parties. His friends used to say,
&ldquo;Are you afraid of tigers?&rdquo; He used to retort by saying, &ldquo;I know you
are not going to kill tigers, you are going to kill harmless animals
such as deer and rabbits.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;If not for hunting, come to witness how accurate is the aim
of your friends,&rdquo; they said. Even such invitations Siddharth refused,
saying, &ldquo;I do not like to see the killing of innocent animals.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Prajapati Gautami was deeply worried over this attitude of
Siddharth.</li>
<li>She used to argue with him, saying, &ldquo;You have forgotten that
you are a Kshatriya and fighting is your duty. The art of fighting can
be learned only through hunting, for only by hunting can you learn how
to aim accurately. Hunting is a training ground for the warrior
class.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Siddharth often used to ask Gautami, &ldquo;But, mother, why should
a Kshatriya fight? And Gautami used to reply, &ldquo;Because it is his
duty.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Siddharth was never satisfied by her answer. He used to ask
Gautami, &ldquo;Tell me, how can it be the duty of man to kill man?&rdquo; Gautami
argued, &ldquo;Such an attitude is good for an ascetic. But Kshatriyas must
fight. If they don&rsquo;t, who will protect the kingdom?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;But mother! If all Kshatriyas loved one another, would they
not be able to protect their kingdom without resort to killing?&rdquo;
Gautami had to leave him to his own opinion.</li>
<li>He tried to induce his companions to join him in practising
meditation. He taught them the proper pose. He taught them to fix
their mind on a subject. He advised them to select such thoughts as
&ldquo;May I be happy, may my relations be happy, may all living animals be
happy.&rdquo;</li>
<li>But his friends did not take the matter seriously. They
laughed at him.</li>
<li>On closing their eyes, they could not concentrate on their
subject of meditation. Instead, some saw before their eyes deer for
shooting or sweets for eating.</li>
<li>His father and his mother did not like his partiality for
meditation. They thought it was so contrary to the life of a
Kshatriya.</li>
<li>Siddharth believed that meditation on right subjects led to
development of the spirit of universal love. He justified himself by
saying, &ldquo;When we think of living things, we begin with distinction and
discrimination. We separate friends from enemies, we separate animals
we rear from human beings. We love friends and domesticated animals
and we hate enemies and wild animals.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;This dividing line we must overcome. and this we can do when
we in our contemplation rise above the limitations of practical life.&rdquo;
Such was his reasoning.</li>
<li>His childhood was marked by the presence of [a] supreme
sense of compassion.</li>
<li>Once he went to his father&rsquo;s farm. During recess he was
resting under a tree. enjoying the peace and beauty of nature. While
[he was] so seated, a bird fell from the sky just in front of him.</li>
<li>The bird had been shot at by an arrow which had pierced its
body, and was fluttering about in great agony.</li>
<li>Siddharth rushed to the help of the bird. He removed the
arrow, dressed its wound, and gave it water to drink. He picked up the
bird, came to the place where he was [=had been] seated, and wrapped
up the bird in his upper garment and held it next to his chest to give
it warmth.</li>
<li>Siddharth was wondering who could have shot this innocent
bird. Before long there came his cousin Devadatta, armed with all the
implements of shooting. He told Siddharth that he had shot a bird
flying in the sky, the bird was wounded but it flew some distance and
fell somewhere there, and asked him if he had seen it.</li>
<li>Siddharth replied in the affirmative and showed him the bird,
which had by that time [had] completely recovered.</li>
<li>Devadatta demanded that the bird be handed over to him. This
Siddharth refused to do. A sharp argument ensued between the two.</li>
<li>Devadatta argued that he was the owner of the bird, because by
the rules of the game, he who kills a game becomes the owner of the
game.</li>
<li>Siddharth denied the validity of the rule. He argued that it
is only he who protects that has the right to claim ownership. How can
he who wants to kill be the owner?</li>
<li>Neither party would yield. The matter was referred to
arbitration. The arbitrator upheld the point of view of Siddharth
Gautama.</li>
<li>Devadatta became his permanent enemy. But Gautama&rsquo;s spirit of
compassion was so great that he preferred to save [=saving] the life
of an innocent bird to securing the goodwill of his cousin.</li>
<li>Such were the traits of character found in the early life of
Siddharth Gautama.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 8. Marriage</p>
<ol>
<li>There was a Sakya by name Dandapani. Yeshodhara was his
daughter. She was well known for her beauty and for her &lsquo;sila&rsquo;.</li>
<li>Yeshodhara had reached her sixteenth year, and Dandapani was
thinking about her marriage.</li>
<li>According to custom Dandapani sent invitations to young men of
all the neighbouring countries, for the Swayamvar of his daughter.</li>
<li>An invitation was also sent to Siddharth Gautama.</li>
<li>Siddharth Gautama had completed his sixteenth year. His parents
also were equally anxious to get him married.</li>
<li>They asked him to go to the Swayamvar and offer his hand to
Yeshodhara. He agreed to follow his parents&rsquo; wishes.</li>
<li>From amongst the young men Yeshodhara&rsquo;s choice fell on
Siddharth Gautama.</li>
<li>Dandapani was not very happy. He felt doubtful about the
success of the marriage.</li>
<li>Siddharth, he felt, was addicted to the company of saints and
sages. He preferred loneliness. How could he be a successful
householder?</li>
<li>Yeshodhara, who was determined to marry none but Siddharth,
asked her father whether to be in the company of saints and sages was
a crime. She did not think it was.</li>
<li>Knowing her daughter&rsquo;s determination to marry no one but
Siddharth Gautama, the mother of Yeshodhara told Dandapani that he
must consent. Dandapani did.</li>
<li>The rivals of Gautama were not only disappointed, but felt
that they were insulted.</li>
<li>They wanted that in fairness to them, Yeshodhara should have
applied some test for her selection. But she did not.</li>
<li>For the time being they kept quiet, believing that Dandapani
would not allow Yeshodhara to choose Siddharth Gautama, so that their
purpose would be served.</li>
<li>But when Dandapani failed, they made bold and demanded [=to
demand] that a test of skill in archery be prescribed. Dandapani had
to agree.</li>
<li>At first Siddharth was not prepared for this. But Channa, his
charioteer, pointed out to him what disgrace his refusal would bring
upon his father, upon his family, and upon Yeshodhara.</li>
<li>Siddharth Gautama was greatly impressed by this argument, and
agreed to take part in the contest.</li>
<li>The contest began. Each candidate showed his skill in turn.</li>
<li>Gautama&rsquo;s turn came last. But his was the highest
marksmanship.</li>
<li>Thereafter the marriage took place. Both Suddhodana and
Dandapani were happy. So was [=were] Yeshodhara and Mahaprajapati.</li>
<li>After a long term of married life Yeshodhara gave birth to a
son. He was named Rahula.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 9. Father&rsquo;s Plans to Save His Son</p>
<ol>
<li>While the king was happy to see his son married, and thus
enter[ing] the life of a householder, the prophecy of the sage Asita
continued to haunt him.</li>
<li>To prevent the prophecy from coming true, he thought of getting
him engrossed in the pleasures and carnal joys of life.</li>
<li>With this object in view, Suddhodana built three luxurious
palaces for his son to live in, one for summer, one for the rainy
season, and one for winter, furnished with all the requirements and
excitements for a full amorous life.</li>
<li>Each palace was surrounded by an extensive garden beautifully
laid out with all kinds of trees and flowers.</li>
<li>In consultation with his family priest Udayin, he thought of
providing a harem for the prince with very beautiful inmates.</li>
<li>Suddhodana then told Udayin to advise the girls how to go about
the business of winning over the prince to the pleasures of life.</li>
<li>Having collected the inmates of the harem, Udayin first advised
them how they should win over the prince.</li>
<li>Addressing them he said, &ldquo;Ye are all skilled in all the
graceful arts, ye are proficient in understanding the language of
amorous sentiments, ye are possessed of beauty and gracefulness, ye
are thorough masters in your own styles.</li>
<li>&ldquo;With these graces of yours, ye are able to move even sages who
have lost all their desires, and to ensnare even the gods, who are
charmed by heavenly nymphs.</li>
<li>&ldquo;By your skill in expressing the heart&rsquo;s feelings, by your
coquetry, your grace, and your perfect beauty, ye are able to
enrapture even women&ndash;how much more easily, men.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Thus, skilled as ye are, each set in your own proper sphere,
it should not be beyond your reach to captivate and capture the prince
and hold him in your bondage.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Any timid action on your part would be fit for new brides
whose eyes are closed through shame.</li>
<li>&ldquo;What though this hero be great by his exalted glory, yet
&lsquo;great is the might of woman&rsquo;. Let this be your firm resolve.</li>
<li>&ldquo;In olden time a great seer, hard to be conquered even by
gods, was spurned by a harlot, the beauty of Kasi, planting her feet
upon him.</li>
<li>&ldquo;And the great seer Visvamitra, though plunged in a profound
penance, was carried captive for ten years in the forests by the nymph
Ghritaki.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Many such seers as these have women brought to naught&ndash;how
much more, then, a delicate prince in the first flower of his age?</li>
<li>&ldquo;This being so, boldly put forth your efforts, that the
posterity of the king&rsquo;s family may not be turned away from him.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Ordinary women captivate simple men; but they are truly
women, who subdue the nature of high and hard.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 10. The Failure of the Women to Win the Prince</p>
<ol>
<li>Having heard these words of Udayin, the women, stung to the
heart, rose even above themselves for the conquest of the prince.</li>
<li>But even with their brows, their glances, their coquetries,
their smiles, their delicate movements, the girls of the harem did not
feel sure of themselves.</li>
<li>But they soon regained their confidence through the command of
the family priest and the gentle temperament of the prince, and
through the power of intoxication and of love.</li>
<li>The women then set upon their task and made the prince wander
in the woods like an elephant in the forests of Himavat, accompanied
by a herd of females.</li>
<li>Attended by women, he shone in that pleasant grove, as the sun
surrounded by Apsaras in his royal garden.</li>
<li>There, some of them, urged by passion, pressed him with their
full, firm bosoms in gentle collisions.</li>
<li>Others violently embraced him after pretending to stumble, then
leaning on him with their shoulders drooping down, and with their
gentle creeper-like arms.</li>
<li>Others with their mouths smelling of spirituous liquor, their
lower lips red like copper, whispered in bis ear, &ldquo;Let my secret be
heard.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Others, all wet with unguents, as if giving him a command,
clasped his hand eagerly and said, &ldquo;Perform thy rites of. adoration
here.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Another, with her blue garments continually slipping down in
pretended intoxication, stood conspicuous with her tongue visible,
like the night with its lightning lashing.</li>
<li>Others, with their golden ones tinkling, wandered about here
and there, showing him their bodies veiled with thin cloth.</li>
<li>Others leaned, holding a mango bough in hand, displaying their
bosoms like golden jars.</li>
<li>Some, coming from a lotus bed, carrying lotuses and with eyes
like lotuses, stood like the lotus goddess Padma, by the side of that
lotus-faced prince.</li>
<li>Another sang a sweet song easily understood, and with the
proper gesticulations, rousing him, self-subdued though he was, by her
glance, as saying, &ldquo;O how thou art deluded!&rdquo;</li>
<li>Another, having armed herself with her bright face, with its
brow drawn to its full, imitated his action, as playing the hero.</li>
<li>Another, with beautiful, full bosoms, and having her earrings
waving in the wind, laughed loudly at him, as if saying, &ldquo;Catch me,
sir, if you can!&rdquo;</li>
<li>Some, as he was going away, bound him with strings of
garlands; others punished him with words like an elephant-driver&rsquo;s
hook, gentle yet reproachful.</li>
<li>Another, wishing to argue with him, seizing a mango spray,
asked, all bewildered with passion, &ldquo;&lsquo;This flower, whose is it?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Another, assuming a gait and attitude like that of a man, said
to him, &ldquo;You who are conquered. by a woman, go and conquer this
earth!&rdquo;</li>
<li>Then another, with rolling eyes, smelling a blue lotus, thus
addressed the prince with words slightly indistinct in her
excitement:</li>
<li>&ldquo;See, my lord, this mango covered with its honey-scented
flowers, where the bird <em>kokila</em> sings, as if imprisoned in a golden
cage.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Come and see this <em>Asoka</em> tree, which augments lovers&rsquo;
sorrows, where the bees make a noise as if they were scorched by
fire.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Come and see this <em>Tilaka</em> tree, embraced by a slender mango
branch, like a man in a white garment by a woman decked with yellow
ungents.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Behold the kurubaka in flower, bright like fresh resin-juice,
which bends down as if it felt reproached by the colour of women&rsquo;s
nails.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Come and see this young <em>Asoka</em>, covered all over with new
shoots, which stands as if it were ashamed at the beauty of our
hands.</li>
<li>&ldquo;See this lake surrounded by the <em>Sinduvara</em> shrubs growing on
its banks, like a fair woman reclining, clad in fine white cloth.</li>
<li>&ldquo;See the imperial power of females&ndash;yonder <em>Ruddygoose</em> in the
water goes behind his mate, following her like a slave.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Come and listen to the notes of the intoxicated <em>Cuckoo</em> as
he sings, while another <em>cuckoo</em> sings as if consenting wholly without
care.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Would that thine was the intoxication of the birds which the
spring produces, and not the thought of a thinking man, ever pondering
how wise he is!&rdquo;</li>
<li>Thus these young women, their souls carried away by love,
assailed the prince with all kinds of stratagems.</li>
<li>But although thus attacked, he, having his sense guarded by
self-control; neither rejoiced nor smiled.</li>
<li>Having seen them in their real condition, the Prince pondered
with an undisturbed and steadfast mind.</li>
<li>&ldquo;What is it that these women lack, that they perceive not that
youth is fickle? For old age will destroy whatever beauty has.&rdquo;</li>
<li>This round of blandishment went on for months and years with
no results.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 11. The Prime Minister&rsquo;s Admonition to the Prince</p>
<ol>
<li>Udayin realized that the girls had failed, and that the Prince
had shown no interest in them.</li>
<li>Udayin, well skilled in the rules of policy, thought of talking
to the prince.</li>
<li>Meeting the prince all alone, Udayin said, &ldquo;Since I was
appointed by the king as a fitting friend for thee, therefore I wish
to speak to thee in the friendliness of my heart.&rdquo; So began Udayin.</li>
<li>&ldquo;To hinder from what is disadvantageous, to urge to do what is
advantageous, and not to forsake in misfortune, these are the three
marks of a friend.</li>
<li>&ldquo;If I, after having promised my friendship, were not to heed
when thou turnest away from the great end of man, there would be no
friendship in me.</li>
<li>&ldquo;It is right to woo a woman even by guile; this is useful both
for getting rid of shame and for one&rsquo;s own enjoyment.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Reverential behaviour and compliance with her wishes are what
bind a woman&rsquo;s heart; good qualities truly are a cause of love, and
women love respect.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Wilt thou not then, O large-eyed prince, even if thy heart is
unwilling, seek to please them with a courtesy worthy of this beauty
of thine?</li>
<li>&ldquo;Courtesy is the balm of women, courtesy is the best ornament;
beauty without courtesy is like a grove without flowers.</li>
<li>&ldquo;But of what use is courtesy by itself? Let it be assisted by
the heart&rsquo;s feelings; surely, when worldly objects so hard to attain
are in the grasp, thou wilt not despise them.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Knowing that pleasure was the best of objects, even the god
Purandara (Indra) wooed in olden times Ahalya, the wife of the saint
Gautama.</li>
<li>&ldquo;So too Agastya wooed Rohini, the wife of Soma; and therefore,
as Sruti saith, a like thing befell Lopamudra.</li>
<li>&ldquo;The great ascetic Brihaspati begot Bharadwaja on Mamata the
daughter of the Maruta, the wife of Autathya.</li>
<li>&ldquo;The Moon, the best of offerers, begat Buda of divine nature
on the spouse of Vrihaspati, as she was offering a libation.</li>
<li>&ldquo;So too in old times Parasara, overpowered by passion on the
banks of the Yamuna, lay with the maiden Kali, who was the daughter of
the son of Varuna.</li>
<li>&ldquo;The sage Vasishtha through lust begot a son, Kapinglada, on
Akshmala, a despised low-caste woman.</li>
<li>&ldquo;And the seer-king Yayat, even when the vigour of his prime
was gone, sported in the Kaitrartha forest with the Apsara Visvaki.</li>
<li>&ldquo;And the Kaurava king Pandu, though he knew that intercourse
with his wife would end in death, yet overcome by the beauty and good
qualities of Madri, yielded to the pleasures of love.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Great heroes such as these pursued even contemptible desires
for the sake of pleasure, how much more so when they are praiseworthy
of their kind?</li>
<li>&ldquo;And yet thou, a young man, possessed of strength and beauty,
despisest enjoyments which rightly belong to thee and to which the
whole world is devoted.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 12. The Prince&rsquo;s Reply to the Prime Minister</p>
<ol>
<li>Having heard these specious words of his, well-supported by
sacred tradition, the prince made reply, in a voice like the
thundering of a cloud:</li>
<li>&ldquo;This speech manifesting affection is well-befitting in thee;
but I will convince thee as to where thou wrongly judgest me.</li>
<li>&ldquo;I do not despise worldly objects, I know that all mankind is
bound up therein. But remembering that the world is transitory, my
mind cannot find pleasure in them.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Yet even though this beauty of women were to remain perpetual,
still delight in the pleasures of desires would not be worthy of the
wise man.</li>
<li>&ldquo;And as for what thou sayest as to even those great men having
become victims to desire, do not be led away by them; for destruction
was also their lot.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Real greatness is not to be found there, where there is
destruction, or where there is attachment to earthly objects, or a
want of self-control.</li>
<li>&ldquo;And when thou sayest, &lsquo;Let one deal with women by guile&rsquo;, I
know about guile, even if it be accompanied with courtesy.</li>
<li>&ldquo;That compliance too with a woman&rsquo;s wishes pleases me not, if
truthfulness be not there; if there be not a union with one&rsquo;s whole
soul and nature, then &lsquo;out upon it&rsquo; say I.</li>
<li>&ldquo;A soul overpowered by passion, believing in falsehood, carried
away by attachment and blind to the faults of its objects, what is
there in it worth being deceived?</li>
<li>&ldquo;And if the victims of passion do deceive one another, are not
men unfit for women to look at and women for men?</li>
<li>&ldquo;Since then these things are so, thou surely wouldst not lead
me astray into ignoble pleasures.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Udayin felt silenced by the firm and strong resolve of the
prince and reported the matter to his father.</li>
<li>Suddhodana, when he heard how his son&rsquo;s mind turned away from
all objects of sense, could not sleep all that night. Like an elephant
with an arrow in his heart, he was full of pain.</li>
<li>He and his ministers spent much of their time in consultation,
hoping to find some means to draw Siddharth to the pleasures of carnal
life, and thus to dissuade him from the likely turn which he may
[=might] give to his life. But they found no other means besides
those they had tried.</li>
<li>And the seraglio of women, wearing their garlands and
ornaments in vain, with their graceful arts and endearments all
fruitless, concealing their love deep in their hearts, was disbanded.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 13. Initiation into the Sakya Sangh</p>
<ol>
<li>The Sakyas had their Sangh. Every Sakya youth above twenty had
to be initiated into the Sangh and be a member of the Sangh.</li>
<li>Siddharth Gautama had reached the age of twenty. It was time
for him to be initiated into the Sangh and become a member thereof.</li>
<li>The Sakyas had a meeting-house which they called Sansthagar. It
was situated in Kapilavatsu. The session of the Sangh was also held in
the Sansthagar.</li>
<li>With the object of getting Siddharth initiated into the Sangh,
Suddhodana asked the Purohit of the Sakyas to convene a meeting of the
Sangh.</li>
<li>Accordingly the Sangh met at Kapilavatsu in the Sansthagar of
the Sakyas.</li>
<li>At the meeting of the Sangh, the Purohit proposed that
Siddharth be enrolled as a member of the Sangh.</li>
<li>The Senapati of the Sakyas then rose in his seat and addressed
the Sangh as follows, &ldquo;Siddharth Gautama, born in the family of
Suddhodana of the Sakya clan, desires to be a member of the Sangh. He
is twenty years of age and is in every way fit to be a member of the
Sangh. I, therefore, move that he be made a member of the Sakya Sangh.
Pray, those who are against the motion speak.&rdquo;</li>
<li>No one spoke against it. &ldquo;A second time do I ask those who are
against the motion to speak,&rdquo; said the Senapati.</li>
<li>No one rose to speak against the motion. Again the Senapati
said, &ldquo;A third time do I ask those who are against the motion to
speak.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Even for the third time no one spoke against it.</li>
<li>It was the rule of procedure among the Sakyas that there could
be no debate without a motion, and no motion could be declared carried
unless it was passed three times.</li>
<li>The motion of the Senapati having been carried three times
without opposition, Siddharth was declared to have been duly admitted
as a member of the Sakya Sangh.</li>
<li>Thereafter the Purohit of the Sakyas stood up and asked
Siddharth to rise in his place.</li>
<li>Addressing Siddharth, he said, &ldquo;Do you realize that the Sangh
has honoured you by making you a member of it?&rdquo; &ldquo;I do, sir,&rdquo; replied
Siddharth.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Do you know the obligation of membership of the Sangh?&rdquo; &ldquo;I am
sorry, sir, I do not. But I shall be happy to know them, sir,&rdquo; said
Siddharth.</li>
<li>&ldquo;I shall first tell you what your duties as a member of the
Sangh are &quot; said the Purohit and he then related them one by one:&rdquo; (1)
You must safeguard the interests of the Sakyas by your body, mind and
money. (2) You must not absent yourself from the meetings of the
Sangh. (3) You must without fear or favour expose any fault you may
notice in the conduct of a Sakya. (4) You must not be angry if you are
accused of an offence, but confess if you are guilty or state if you
are innocent.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Proceeding, the Purohit said, &ldquo;I shall next tell you what will
disqualify you for membership of the Sangh: (1) You cannot remain a
member of the Sangh if you commit rape. (2) You cannot remain a member
of the Sangh if you commit murder. (3) You cannot remain a member of
the Sangh if you commit theft. (4) You cannot remain a member of the
Sangh if you are guilty of giving false evidence.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;I am grateful to you, sir,&rdquo; said Siddharth, &ldquo;for telling me
the rules of discipline of the Sakya Sangh. I assure you I will do my
best to follow them in letter and in spirit.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 14. Conflict with the Sangh</p>
<ol>
<li>Eight years had passed by since Siddharth was made a member of
the Sakya Sangh.</li>
<li>He was a very devoted and steadfast member of the Sangh. He
took the same interest in the affairs of the Sangh as he did in his
own. His conduct as a member of the Sangh was exemplary, and he had
endeared himself to all.</li>
<li>In the eighth year of his membership, an event occurred which
resulted in a tragedy for the family of Suddhodana and a crisis in the
life of Siddharth.</li>
<li>This is the origin of the tragedy.</li>
<li>Bordering on the State of the Sakyas was the State of the
Koliyas. The two kingdoms were divided by the river Rohini.</li>
<li>The waters of the Rohini were used by both the Sakyas and the
Koliyas for irrigating their fields. Every season there used to be
disputes between them as to who should take the water of the Rohini
first, and how much. These disputes resulted in quarrels and sometimes
in affrays.</li>
<li>In the year when Siddharth was twenty-eight, there was a major
clash over the waters between the servants of the Sakyas and the
servants of the Koliyas. Both sides suffered injuries.</li>
<li>Coming to know of this, the Sakyas and the Koliyas felt that
the issue must be settled once for all by war.</li>
<li>The Senapati of the Sakyas, therefore, called a session of the
Sakya Sangh to consider the question of declaring war on the
Koliyas.</li>
<li>Addressing the members of the Sangh, the Senapati said, &ldquo;Our
people have been attacked by the Koliyas and they had to retreat. Such
acts of aggression by the Koliyas have taken place more than once. We
have tolerated them so far. But this cannot go on. It must be stopped,
and the only way to stop it is to declare war against the Koliyas. I
propose that the Sangh do declare war on the Koliyas. Those who wish
to oppose may speak.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Siddharth Gautama rose in his seat and said, &ldquo;I oppose this
resolution. War does not solve any question. Waging war will not serve
our purpose. It will sow the seeds of another war. The slayer gets a
slayer in his turn; the conqueror gets one who conquers him; a man who
despoils is despoiled in his turn.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Siddharth Gautama continued, &ldquo;I feel that the Sangh should not
be in hase to declare war on the Koliyas. Careful investigation should
be made to ascertain who is the guilty party. I hear that our men have
also been aggressors. If this be true, then it is obvious that we too
are not free from blame.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The Senapati replied, &ldquo;Yes, our men were the aggressors. But
it must not be forgotten that it was our turn to take the water
first.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Siddharth Gautama said, &ldquo;This shows that we are not completely
free from blame. I therefore propose that we elect two men from us,
and the Koliyas should be asked to elect two from them, and the four
should elect a fifth person, and these should settle the dispute.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The amendment moved by Siddharth Gautama was duly seconded.
But the Senapati opposed the amendment, saying, &ldquo;I am sure that this
menace of the Koliyas will not end unless they are severely
punished.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The resolution and the amendment had therefore to be put to
vote. The amendment moved by Siddharth Gautama was put first. It was
declared lost by an overwhelming majority.</li>
<li>The Senapati next put his own resolution to vote. Siddharth
Gautama again stood up to oppose it. &ldquo;I beg the Sangh,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;not
to accept the resolution. The Sakyas and the Koliyas are close
relations. It is unwise that they should destroy each other.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The Senapati encountered the plea urged by Siddharth Gautama.
He stressed that in war the Kshatriyas cannot make a distinction
between relations and strangers. They must fight even against brothers
for the sake of their kingdom.</li>
<li>Performing sacrifices is the duty of the Brahmins, fighting is
the duty of the Kshatriyas, trading is the duty of the Vaishyas, and
service is the duty of the Shudras. There is merit in each class
performing its duty. Such is the injunction of our Shastras.</li>
<li>Siddharth replied, &ldquo;Dharma, as I understand it, consists in
recognising that enmity does not disappear by enmity. It can be
conquered by love only.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The Senapati, getting impatient, said, &ldquo;It is unnecessary to
enter upon this philosophical disquisition. The point is that
Siddharth is opposed to my resolution. Let us ascertain what the Sangh
has to say about it by putting it to [a] vote.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Accordingly the Senapati put his resolution to [a] vote. It
was declared carried by an overwhelming majority.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 15. Offer of Exile</p>
<ol>
<li>Next day the Senapati called another meeting of the Sakya
Sangh, to have his plan of mobilisation considered by the Sangh.</li>
<li>When the Sangh met, he proposed that he be permitted to
proclaim an order calling to arms, for the war against the Koliyas,
every Sakya between the ages of 20 and 50.</li>
<li>The meeting was attended by both sides&ndash;those who at the
previous meeting of the Sangh had voted in favour of a declaration of
war, as well as those who had voted against it.</li>
<li>For those who had voted in favour, there was no difficulty in
accepting the proposal of the Senapati. It was a natural consequence
of their earlier decision.</li>
<li>But the minority who had voted against it had a problem to
face. Their problem was—to submit or not to submit to the decision of
the majority.</li>
<li>The minority was determined not to submit to the majority. That
is the reason why they had decided to be present at the meeting.
Unfortunately, none of them had the courage to say so openly. Perhaps
they knew the consequences of opposing the majority.</li>
<li>Seeing that his supporters were silent, Siddharth stood up, and
addressing the Sangh, said, &ldquo;Friends! You may do what you like. You
have a majority on your side, but I am sorry to say I shall oppose
your decision in favour of mobilisation. I shall not join your army,
and I shall not take part in the war.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The Senapati, replying to Siddharth Gautama, said, &ldquo;Do remember
the vows you had taken when you were admitted to the membership of the
Sangh? If you break any of them, you will expose yourself to public
shame.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Siddharth replied, &ldquo;Yes, I have pledged myself to safeguard the
best interests of the Sakyas by my body, mind and money. But I do not
think that this war is in the best interests of the Sakyas. What is
public shame to me before the best interests of the Sakyas?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Siddharth proceeded to caution the Sangh by reminding it of
how the Sakyas have [=had] become the vassals of the King of Kosala
by reason of their quarrels with the Koliyas. &ldquo;It is not difficult to
imagine,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that this war will give him a greater handle to
further reduce the freedom of the Sakyas.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The Senapati grew angry and, addressing Siddharth, said, &ldquo;Your
eloquence will not help you. You must obey the majority decision of
the Sangh. You are perhaps counting upon the fact that the Sangh has
no power to order an offender to be hanged or to exile him without the
sanction of the king of the Kosalas, and that the king of the Kosalas
will not give permission if either of the two sentences was passed
against you by the Sangh.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;But remember, the Sangh has other ways of punishing you. The
Sangh can declare a social boycott against your family, and the Sangh
can confiscate your family lands. For this the Sangh does not have to
obtain the permission of the king of the Kosalas.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Siddharth realised the consequences that would follow if he
continued his opposition to the Sangh in its plan of war against the
Koliyas. He had three alternatives to consider&ndash;to join the forces and
participate in the war; to consent to being hanged or exiled; and to
allow the members of his family to be condemned to a social boycott
and confiscation of property.</li>
<li>He was firm in not accepting the first. As to the third, he
felt it was unthinkable. Under the circumstances, he felt that the
second alternative was the best.</li>
<li>Accordingly, Siddharth spoke to the Sangh. &ldquo;Please do not
punish my family. Do not put them in distress by subjecting them to a
social boycott. Do not make them destitute by confiscating their land,
which is their only means of livelihood. They are innocent. I am the
guilty person. Let me alone suffer for my wrong. Sentence me to death
or exile, whichever you like. I will willingly accept it, and I
promise I shall not appeal to the king of the Kosalas.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 16. Parivraja&ndash;the Way Out</p>
<ol>
<li>The Senapati said, &ldquo;It is difficult to accept your suggestion.
For even if you voluntarily agreed to undergo the sentence of death or
exile, the matter is sure to become known to the king of the Kosalas,
and he is sure to conclude that it is the Sangh which has inflicted
this punishment, and take action against the Sangh.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;If this is the difficulty, I can easily suggest a way out,&rdquo;
said Siddharth Gautama. &ldquo;I can become a Parivrajaka and leave this
country. It is a kind of an exile.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The Senapati thought this was a good solution. But he had still
some doubt about Siddharth being able to give effect to it.</li>
<li>So the Senapati asked Siddharth, &ldquo;How can you become a
Parivrajaka unless you obtain the consent of your parents and your
wife?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Siddharth assured him that he would do his best to obtain their
permission. I promise,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to leave this country immediately,
whether I obtain their consent or not.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The Sangh felt that the proposal made by Siddharth was the best
way out, and they agreed to it.</li>
<li>After finishing the business before the meeting, the Sangh was
about to rise when a young Sakya got up in his place and said, &ldquo;Give
me a hearing, I have something important to say.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Being granted permission to speak, he said, &ldquo;I have no doubt
that Siddharth Gautama will keep his promise and leave the country
immediately. There is, however, one question over which I do not feel
very happy.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Now that Siddharth will soon be out of sight, does the Sangh
propose to give immediate effect to its declaration of war against the
Koliyas?</li>
<li>&ldquo;I want the Sangh to give further consideration to this
question. In any event, the king of the Kosalas is bound to come to
know of the exile of Siddharth Gautama. If the Sakyas declare a war
against the Koliyas immediately, the king of [the] Kosalas will
understand that Siddharth left only because he was opposed to war
against the Koliyas. This will not go well with us.</li>
<li>&ldquo;I, therefore, propose that we should also allow an interval
to pass between the exile of Siddharth Gautama and the actual
commencement of hostilities, so as not to allow the King of Kosala to
establish any connection between the two.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The Sangh realised that this was a very important proposal.
And as a matter of expediency, the Sangh agreed to accept it.</li>
<li>Thus ended the tragic session of the Sakya Sangh, and the
minority which was opposed to the war but who had not the courage to
say so, heaved a sigh of relief that it was able to overcome a
situation full of calamitous consequences.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 17. Parting Words</p>
<ol>
<li>The news of what happened at the meeting of the Sakya Sangh had
travelled to the Raja&rsquo;s palace long before the return of Siddharth
Gautama.</li>
<li>For on reaching home, he found his parents weeping and plunged
in great grief.</li>
<li>Suddhodana said, &ldquo;We were talking about the evils of war. But I
never thought that you would go to such lengths.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Siddharth replied, I too did not think things would take such
a turn. I was hoping that I would be able to win over the Sakyas to
the cause of peace by my argument.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Unfortunately, our military officers had so worked up the
feelings of the men that my argument failed to have any effect on
them.</li>
<li>&ldquo;But I hope you realise how I have saved the situation from
becoming worse. I have not given up the cause of truth and justice,
and whatever the punishment for my standing for truth and justice, I
have succeeded in making its infliction personal to me.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Suddhodana was not satisfied with this. &ldquo;You have not
considered what is to happen to us.&rdquo; &ldquo;But that is the reason why I
undertook to become a Parivrajaka,&rdquo; replied Siddharth. &ldquo;Consider the
consequences if the Sakyas had ordered the confiscation of your
lands.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;But without you what is the use of these lands to us?&rdquo; cried
Suddhodana. &ldquo;Why should not the whole family leave the country of the
Sakyas and go into exile along with you?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Prajapati Gautami, who was weeping, joined Suddhodana in
argument, saying, &ldquo;I agree. How can you go alone leaving us here like
this?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Siddharth said, &ldquo;Mother, have you not always claimed to be the
mother of a Kshatriya? Is that not so? You must then be brave. This
grief is unbecoming of [=to] you. What would you have done if I had
gone to the battle-field and died? Would you have grieved like
this?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Gautami. &ldquo;That would have been befitting a
Kshatriya. But you are now going into the jungle far away from people,
living in the company of wild beasts. How can we stay here in peace? I
say you should take us along with you.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;How can I take you all with me? Nanda is only a child. Rahul
my son is just born. Can you come, leaving them here?&rdquo; he asked
Gautami.</li>
<li>Gautami was not satisfied. She urged, &ldquo;It is possible for us
all to leave the country of the Sakyas, and go to the country of the
Kosalas under the protection of their king.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;But mother! What would the Sakyas say?&rdquo; asked Siddharth.
&ldquo;Would they not regard it as treason? Besides, I pledged that I will
do nothing either by word or by deed to let the king of the Kosalas
know the true cause of my Parivraja.</li>
<li>&ldquo;It is true that I may have to live alone in the jungle. But
which is better? To live in the jungle, or to be a party to the
killing of the Koliyas!&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;But why this impatience?&rdquo; asked Suddhodana. &ldquo;The Sakyas Sangh
has decided to postpone the date of the hostilities for some time.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Perhaps the hostilities may not be started at all. Why not
postpone your Parivraja? Maybe it would be possible to obtain the
permission of the Sangh for you to stay among the Sakyas.&rdquo;</li>
<li>This idea was repellent to Siddharth. &ldquo;It is because I
promised to take Parivraja that the Sangh decided to postpone the
commencement of hostilities against the Koliyas.</li>
<li>&ldquo;It is possible that after I take Parivraja the Sangh may be
persuaded to withdraw their declaration of war. All this depends upon
my first taking Parivraja.</li>
<li>&ldquo;I have made a promise, and I must carry it out. The
consequences of any breach of promise may be very grave both to us and
to the cause of peace.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Mother, do not now stand in my way. Give me your permission
and your blessings. What is happening is for the best.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Gautami and Suddhodana kept silent.</li>
<li>Then Siddharth went to the apartment of Yeshodhara. Seeing
her, he stood silent, not knowing what to say and how to say it. She
broke the silence by saying, &ldquo;I have heard all that has happened at
the meeting of the Sangh at Kapilavatsu.&rdquo;</li>
<li>He asked her, &ldquo;Yeshodhara, tell me what you think of my
decision to take Parivraja.&rdquo;</li>
<li>He expected she would collapse. Nothing of the kind
happened.</li>
<li>With full control over her emotions, she replied, &ldquo;What else
could I have done if I were in your position? I certainly would not
have been a party to a war on the Koliyas.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Your decision is the right decision. You have my consent and
my support. I too would have taken Parivraja with you. If I do not, it
is only because I have Rahula to look after.</li>
<li>&ldquo;I wish it had not come to this. But we must be bold and brave
and face the situation. Do not be anxious about your parents and your
son. I will look after them till [=as long as] there is life in
me.</li>
<li>&ldquo;All I wish is that now that you are becoming a Parivrajaka,
leaving behind all who are near and dear to you, you will find a new
way of life which would result in the happiness of mankind.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Siddharth Gautama was greatly impressed. He realised as never
before what a brave, courageous and noble-minded woman Yeshodhara was,
and how fortunate he was in having her as his wife, and how fate had
put them asunder. He asked her to bring Rahula. He cast his fatherly
look on him, and left.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 18. Leaving His Home</p>
<ol>
<li>Siddharth thought of taking Parivraja at the hands of
Bharadwaja, who had his Ashram at Kapila-vatsu. Accordingly he rose
the next day and started for the Ashram on his favourite horse
Kanthaka, with his servant Channa walking along.</li>
<li>As he came near the Ashram, men and women came out and thronged
the gates to meet him as a newly arrived bridegroom.</li>
<li>And when they came up to him, their eyes wide open in wonder,
they performed their due homage with hands folded like a lotus
calyx.</li>
<li>Then they stood surrounding him, their minds overpowered by
passion, as if they were drinking him in, with their eyes motionless
and blossoming wide with love.</li>
<li>Some of the women verily thought that he was Kama incarnate,
decorated as he was with his brilliant signs as with connate [?]
ornaments.</li>
<li>Others thought from his gentleness and his majesty that it was
the moon with its ambrosial beams, as it were, visibly come down to
the earth.</li>
<li>Others, smitten by his beauty, yawned as if to swallow him, and
fixing their eyes on each other, softly sighed.</li>
<li>Thus the women only looked upon him, simply gazing with their
eyes. They spoke not, nor did they smile. They surrounded him and
stood aghast, thinking of his decision to take Parivraja.</li>
<li>With great difficulty he extricated himself from the crowd and
entered the gates of the Ashram.</li>
<li>Siddharth did not like [=wish] Suddhodana and Prajapati
Gautami to be present to witness his Parivraja. For he knew that they
would break down under the weight of grief. But they had already
reached the Ashram without letting him know.</li>
<li>As he entered the compound of the Ashram, he saw in the crowd
his father and mother.</li>
<li>Seeing his parents he first went to them and asked for their
blessing. They were so choked with emotion that they could hardly say
a word. They wept and wept, held him fast, and bathed him with their
tears.</li>
<li>Channa had tied Kanthaka to a tree in the Ashram and was
standing [by]. Seeing Suddhodana and Prajapati in tears, he too was
overcome with emotion and was weeping.</li>
<li>Separating himself with great difficulty from his parents,
Siddharth went to the place where Channa was standing. He gave him his
dress and his ornaments to take back home.</li>
<li>Then he had his head shaved, as was required for a
Parivrajaka. His cousin Mahanama had brought the clothes appropriate
for a Parivrajaka, and a begging bowl. Siddharth wore them [=put them
on].</li>
<li>Having thus prepared himself to enter the life of a
Parivrajaka, Siddharth approached Bharadwaja [with a request] to
confer on him Parivraja.</li>
<li>Bharadwaja, with the help of his disciples, performed the
necessary ceremonies, and declared Siddharth Gautama to have become a
Parivrajaka.</li>
<li>Remembering that he had given a double pledge to the Sakya
Sangh, to take Parivraja and to leave the Sakya kingdom without undue
delay, Siddharth Gautama immediately, on the completion of the
Parivraja ceremony, started on his journey.</li>
<li>The crowd which had collected in the Ashram was unusually
large. That was because the circumstances leading to Gautama&rsquo;s
Parivraja were so extraordinary. As the prince stepped out of the
Ashram, the crowd also followed him.</li>
<li>He left Kapilavatsu and proceeded in the direction of the
river Anoma. Looking back ,he saw the crowd still following him.</li>
<li>He stopped and addressed them, saying, &ldquo;Brothers and sisters,
there is no use your following me. I have failed to settle the dispute
between the Sakyas arid the Koliyas. But if you create public opinion
in favour of settlement you might succeed. Be, therefore, so good as
to return.&rdquo; Hearing his appeal, the crowd started going back.</li>
<li>Suddhodana and Gautami also returned to the palace.</li>
<li>Gautami was unable to bear the sight of the robes and the
ornaments discarded by Siddharth. She had them thrown into a lotus
pool.</li>
<li>Siddharth Gautama was only twenty-nine when he underwent
Parivraja (Renunciation).</li>
<li>People admired him and sighed for him; saying, &ldquo;Here was a
Sakya blessed with high lineage, noble parentage, possessed of
considerable riches, in the bloom of youthful vigour, accomplished in
mind and body, brought up in luxury, who fought his kinsmen for the
sake of maintaining peace on earth and goodwill towards men.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Here was a Sakya youth who, when outvoted by his kinsmen,
refused to submit, but preferred to undergo voluntary punishment which
involved the exchange of riches for poverty, comfort for alms, home
for homelessness. And so he goes, with none in the world to care for
him, and with nothing in the world which he could claim as his own.</li>
<li>&ldquo;His was an act of supreme sacrifice willingly made. His is a
brave and a courageous act. There is no parallel to it in the history
of the world. He deserves to be called a Sakya Muni or Sakya Sinha.&rdquo;</li>
<li>How true were the words of Kisa Gotami, a Sakya maiden. When
referring to Siddharth Gautama, she said, &ldquo;Blessed indeed is the
mother, blessed indeed is the father, who has such a son. Blessed
indeed is the wife who has such a husband.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 19. The Prince and the Servant</p>
<ol>
<li>Channa too should have gone back home with Kanthaka. But he
refused to go. He insisted on seeing the Prince off with Kanthaka at
least to the banks of the river Anoma, and so insistent was Channa
that the Gautama had to yield to his wishes.</li>
<li>At last they reached the banks of the river Anoma.</li>
<li>Then turning to Channa he said, &ldquo;Good friend, thy devotion to
me has been proved by thy thus following me. I am wholly won in heart
by thee, ye who have such a love for your master.</li>
<li>&ldquo;I am pleased with your noble feelings towards me, even though
I am powerless of conferring [=to confer] any reward.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Who would not be favourably disposed to one who stands to him
as bringing him reward? But even one&rsquo;s own people commonly become mere
strangers in a reverse of fortune.</li>
<li>&ldquo;A son is brought up for the sake of the family; the father is
honoured by the son for the sake of his own future support; the world
shows kindness for the sake of hope; there is no such thing as
unselfishness without a motive.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Thou art the only exception. Take now this horse and return.</li>
<li>&ldquo;The king, with his loving confidence still unshaken, must be
enjoined to stay his grief.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Tell him, I have left him&ndash;with no thirst for heaven, with no
lack of love, nor feeling of anger.</li>
<li>&ldquo;He should not think of mourning for me who am thus gone forth
from my home; union, however long it may last, in time will come to an
end.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Since separation is certain, how shall there not be repeated
severings from one&rsquo;s kindred?</li>
<li>&ldquo;At a man&rsquo;s death there are doubtless heirs to his wealth, but
heirs to his merit are hard to find on the earth, or exist not at
all.</li>
<li>&ldquo;The king, my father, requires to be looked after. The king
may say, &lsquo;He is gone at a wrong time.&rsquo; But there is no wrong time for
duty.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Do thou address the king, O friend, with these and suchlike
words; and do thou use thy efforts so that he may not even remember
me.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Yes, do thou repeat to my mother my utter unworthiness to
deserve her affection. She is a noble person, too noble for words.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Having heard these words, Channa, overwhelmed with grief, made
reply with folded hands, his voice choked by emotion:</li>
<li>&ldquo;Seeing that ye are causing affliction to thy kindred, my
mind, O my Lord, sinks down like an elephant in a river of mud.</li>
<li>&ldquo;To whom would not such a determination as this of thine,
cause tears, even if his heart were of iron&ndash;how much more if it were
throbbing with love?</li>
<li>&ldquo;Where is gone this delicacy of limb, fit to lie only in a
palace, and where [in comparison] is the ground of the ascetic
forest, covered with the shoots of rough Kusa grass?</li>
<li>&ldquo;How could I, O Prince, by mine own will, &ndash;knowing this thy
decision,&ndash;carry back the horse to the sorrow of Kapilavatsu?</li>
<li>&ldquo;Surely thou will not abandon that fond old king, so devoted
to his son, as a heretic might the true religion? .</li>
<li>&ldquo;And her, thy second mother, worn with the care of bringing
thee up,&ndash;thou will not surely forget her, as an ingrate does a
benefit?</li>
<li>&ldquo;Thou wilt not surely abandon thy wife endowed with all
virtues, illustrious for her family, devoted to her husband and with a
young son.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Thou wilt not abandon the young son of Yeshodhara, worthy of
all praise, thou the best of the cherishers of religion and fame, as a
dissolute spendthrift his choicest glory?</li>
<li>&ldquo;Or even if thy mind be resolved to abandon thy kindred and
thy kingdom, thou will not, O Master, abandon me,&ndash;thy feet are my
only refuge.</li>
<li>&ldquo;I cannot go to the city with my soul thus burning, leaving
thee behind in the forest.</li>
<li>&ldquo;What will the king say to me, returning to the city without
thee, or what shall I say to thy wife by way of telling them good
news?</li>
<li>&ldquo;As for what thou sayest, thou must repeat my unworthiness to
the king&rsquo;, who could think or believe it?&rdquo; continued Channa. &ldquo;Even if
I ventured to speak it, with a heart ashamed and a tongue cleaving to
my mouth, he may not appreciate it.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Him who is always compassionate and who never fails to feel
pity, it ill befits to abandon one who loves; turn back and have mercy
on me.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Having heard these words of Channa overcome with sorrow,
Siddharth Gautama with the utmost gentleness answered:</li>
<li>&ldquo;Abandon this distress ,Channa, regarding thy separation from
me,&ndash;change is inevitable in corporeal beings who are subject to
different births.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Even. if I, through affection, were not to abandon my
kindred, death would still make us helplessly abandon one another.</li>
<li>&ldquo;She, my mother, by whom I was born in the womb with great
thirst and pains,&ndash;where am I now with regard to her, and where is she
with regard to me?</li>
<li>&ldquo;As birds go to their roosting-tree and then depart, so the
meeting of beings inevitably ends in separation.</li>
<li>&ldquo;As clouds, having come together, depart asunder again, such I
consider the meeting and parting of living things.</li>
<li>&ldquo;And since this world goes away, each one deceiving the
other,&ndash;it is not right to think anything thine own in a time of union
which is a dread.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Therefore, since it is so, grieve not, my good friend, but
go; or if thy love lingers, then go and afterwards return.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Say without reproaching me, to the people of Kapilavatsu,
&lsquo;Let your love for him be given up, and hear his resolve.&rsquo;&rdquo;</li>
<li>Having heard this conversation between the master and the
servant, Kanthaka, the noblest steed, licked his [=Gautam&rsquo;s] feet
with his tongue and dropped hot tears.</li>
<li>With his hand whose fingers were untied [=not joined] with a
membrane, and which was marked with the auspicious <em>svastika</em>, and
with its middle part curved, Gautama stroked him and addressed him
like a friend:</li>
<li>&ldquo;Shed not tears, Kanthaka, bear with it, thy labours will soon
have its [=their] fruit.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Then Channa, knowing that the time for the parting of the ways
had come, forthwith paid honour to the sylvan dress of Gautama.</li>
<li>Then Gautama, having bidden good-bye to Kanthaka and Channa,
went on his way.</li>
<li>While his master, thus regardless of his kingdom, was going to
the ascetic-wood in mean garments, the groom, tossing up his arms,
wailed bitterly and fell on the ground.</li>
<li>Having looked back again he wept aloud, and embraced the horse
Kanthaka with his arms; and then, hopeless and repeatedly lamenting,
started on his return journey.</li>
<li>On the way, sometimes he pondered, sometimes he lamented,
sometimes he stumbled, and sometimes he fell; and so going along,
wretched through his devoted attachment, he performed all kinds of
actions on the road, knowing not what he was doing.</li>
</ol>
<p>§20. The Return of Channa</p>
<ol>
<li>Then Channa, in deep distress, when his master thus went into
the forest, made every effort on the road to dissolve his load of
sorrow.</li>
<li>His heart was so heavy that the road which he used to traverse
in one night with Kanthaka, that same road he now took eight days to
travel, pondering over his lord&rsquo;s absence.</li>
<li>The horse Kanthaka, though he still went on bravely, fagged and
had lost all spirit; and decked though he was with ornaments, he in
the absence of his master seemed to have lost all his beauty.</li>
<li>And turning round towards the direction in which his master
went, he neighed repeatedly with a mournful sound; and though pressed
with hunger, he welcomed not, nor tasted, any grass or water on the
road, as before.</li>
<li>Slowly the two at long last reached Kapila-vatsu, which seemed
empty when deserted by Gautama. They reached the city in body but not
in soul.</li>
<li>Bright as it was with lotus-covered waters, adorned with trees
full of flowers, the citizens had lost all their gladness.</li>
<li>When the two, their brightness gone and their eyes dim with
tears, slowly entered the city, it seemed all bathed in gloom.</li>
<li>Having heard that they had returned with their limbs all
relaxed, coming back without the pride of the Sakya race, the men of
the city shed tears.</li>
<li>Full of wrath, the people followed Channa in the road, crying
behind him with tears, &ldquo;Where is the king&rsquo;s son, the glory of his race
and his kingdom?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;This city bereft of him is a forest, and that forest which
possesses him is a city; the city without him has no charms for us.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Next the women crowded to the rows of windows, crying to one
another, &ldquo;The prince has returned&rdquo;; but having seen that his horse had
an empty back, they closed the windows again and wailed aloud.</li>
</ol>
<p>§21 The Family in Mourning</p>
<ol>
<li>The members of the family of Suddhodana were anxiously awaiting
the return of Channa, in the hope that he might persuade Gautama to
return home.</li>
<li>On entering the royal stable, Kanthaka uttered a loud sound,
uttering his woe to the palace people.</li>
<li>Then the people who were in the neighbourhood of the king&rsquo;s
inner apartments, thought in their hearts, &ldquo;Since the horse Kanthaka
neighs, it must be that the prince has come.&rdquo;</li>
<li>And the women who were fainting with sorrow, now in wild joy,
with their eyes rolling to see the prince, rushed out of the palace
full of hope. But they were disappointed. There was Kanthaka without
the prince.</li>
<li>Gautami, abandoning all self-control, cried aloud&ndash;she fainted,
and with a weeping face exclaimed:</li>
<li>&ldquo;With his long arms and lion gait, his bull-like eye, and his
beauty, bright like gold, his broad chest, and his voice deep as a
drum or a cloud,&ndash;should such a hero as this dwell in a hermitage?</li>
<li>&ldquo;This earth is indeed unworthy as regards that peerless doer of
noble actions, for such a virtuous hero has gone away from us.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Those two feet of his, tender with their beautiful web spread
between the toes, with their ankles, concealed and soft like a blue
lotus,&ndash;how can they, bearing a wheel mark in the middle, walk on the
hard ground of the skirts of the forest?</li>
<li>&ldquo;That body, which deserves to sit or lie on the roof of a
palace, honoured with costly garments, aloes, and sandalwood, how will
that manly body live in the woods, exposed to the attacks of the cold,
the heat, and the rain?</li>
<li>&ldquo;He who was proud of his family, goodness, strength, energy,
sacred learning, beauty, and youth, who was ever ready to give, not
ask, how will he go about begging alms from others?</li>
<li>&ldquo;He who, lying on a spotless golden bed, was awakened during
the night by the concert of musical instruments, how alas! will he, my
ascetic, sleep today on the bare ground with only one rag of cloth
interposed?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Having heard this piteous lamentation, the women, embracing
one another with their arms, rained tears from their eyes, as the
shaken creepers drop honey from their flowers.</li>
<li>Then Yeshodhara, forgetting that she had permitted him to go,
fell upon the ground in utter bewilderment.</li>
<li>&ldquo;How has he abandoned me. his lawful wife? He has left me
widowed. He could have allowed his lawful wife to share his new life
with him.</li>
<li>&ldquo;I have no longing for the heaven&rsquo; my one desire was that my
beloved may never leave me either in this world or the next.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Even if I am unworthy to look on my husband&rsquo;s face with its
long eyes and bright smile, still is this poor Rahula never to roll
about in his father&rsquo;s lap?</li>
<li>&ldquo;Alas! the mind of that wise hero is terribly stern, gentle as
his beauty seems, it is pitilessly cruel. Who can desert of his own
accord such an infant son with his inarticulate talk, one who would
charm even an enemy?</li>
<li>&ldquo;My heart too is certainly most stern, yea, made of rock or
fashioned even of iron, which does not break when its lord is gone to
the forest, deserted by his royal glory like an orphan,&ndash;he so well
worthy of happiness. But what can I do? My grief is too heavy for me
to bear.&rdquo;</li>
<li>So fainting in her woe, Yeshodhara wept and wept
aloud&ndash;self-possessed though she was by nature, yet in her distress
she had lost her fortitude.</li>
<li>Seeing Yeshodhara thus bewildered with her wild utterances of
grief, and fallen on the ground, all the women cried out, with their
faces streaming with tears like large lotuses beaten by the rain.</li>
<li>Having heard of the arrival of both Channa and Kanthaka, and
having learned of the fixed resolve of his son, Suddhodana fell,
struck down by sorrow.</li>
<li>Distracted by his grief for his son, being held up for a
moment by his attendants, Suddhodana gazed on the horse with his eyes
filled with tears, and then falling on the ground wailed aloud.</li>
<li>Then Suddhodana got up and entered his temple, offered
prayers, performed auspicious rites, and vowed certain sacrifices for
the safe return of his son.</li>
<li>So Suddhodana, Gautami, and Yeshodhara passed their days
asking, &ldquo;How long, O God, how long, before, shall we see him again?&rdquo;</li>
