1. *Conversion of Rustic Brahmins* – 2. *Conversion of the Brahmins of Uttaravati*
§ 1. Conversion of Rustic Brahmins
At the back of the Gridhrakutta mountains, near Rajagriha, there was a village of some seventy or so families, all of them Brahmins. The Buddha, wishing to convert these people, came to the place and sat down under a tree. The people, seeing the dignity of his presence, and the glorious appearance of his body, flocked round him, on which he asked the Brahmins how long they had dwelt in the mountain there, and what their occupation was. To this they replied, “We have dwelt here during thirty generations past, and our occupation is to tend cattle.” On [his] asking further as to their religious belief they said, “We pay homage and sacrifice to the sun and the moon, the rain (water), and fire, according to the several seasons. “If one of us dies, we assemble and pray that he may be born in the heaven of Brahma, and so escape further transmigrations.” The Buddha replied, “This is not a safe way, not by it can you benefit. The true way is to follow me, become true ascetics, and practise complete self-composure with a view to obtain Nirvana”; and then he added these lines: “They who consider truth as that which is untrue, and regard that which is untrue as truth–this is but to adopt heretical opinions, and can never lead to true advantage. “But to know as truth that which is true, and to regard as false that which is false, this is perfect rectitude, and this shall bring true profit. “Everywhere in the world there is death–there is no escape from it. “To consider this as the condition of all states of being, that there is nothing born but must die, and, therefore, to desire to escape birth and death, this is to exercise one’s self in Religious Truth.” The seventy Brahmins, hearing these words, desired at once to become Shamans; and on being welcomed by Buddha, their hair fell off, and they presented the appearance of true disciples. Then they all set out to return to the Vihara, and on the road certain thoughts about their wives and families troubled them, whilst at the same time a heavy downpour of rain prevented their advance. There were some ten houses on the roadside, in which they sought shelter; but on entering one of them it was soon perceived that through the roof the rain found its way, and there was but little protection from the rain. On this the Buddha added these lines, and said, “As when a house-roof is not properly secured, then the rain finds a way through it and drops within, so when the thoughts are not carefully controlled, the desires (sexual desires) will soon bore through all our good resolutions. “But as when a roof is well stopped then the water cannot leak through, so by controlling one’s thoughts, and acting with reflection, no such desires can arise or disturb us.” The seventy Brahmins, on hearing these lines, although convinced that their desires were reprehensible, yet were not wholly free from doubt; nevertheless they went forward. As they advanced, they saw some scented wrapping on the ground, and Buddha took the opportunity of calling their attention to it; and after this, seeing some fish-gut also lying about, he directed their notice to its ill odour, and then added these lines and said: “He who consorts with the low and the base, contracts the same character as he who handles a foul substance; he goes from worse to worse, and utterly without reason, he perfects himself in wickedness. “But the wise man (consorting with the wise) contracts the same character, even as the scent of a sweet odour adheres to him who handles it; advancing in wisdom, practising virtue, he goes on to perfection, and is satisfied.” The seventy Brahmins, hearing these verses, convinced that their desire to return home and enjoy personal indulgence was the evil taint that adhered to them, cast off such thoughts and, going forward, came to the Vihara, and finally obtained the condition of Arhatas. § 2.

<p>1. *<a href="02_5.html#01">Conversion of Rustic Brahmins</a>* &ndash; 2.
*<a href="02_5.html#02">Conversion of the Brahmins of Uttaravati</a>*</p>
<p>§ 1. Conversion of Rustic Brahmins</p>
<ol>
<li>At the back of the Gridhrakutta mountains, near Rajagriha,
there was a village of some seventy or so families, all of them
Brahmins.</li>
<li>The Buddha, wishing to convert these people, came to the place
and sat down under a tree.</li>
<li>The people, seeing the dignity of his presence, and the
glorious appearance of his body, flocked round him, on which he asked
the Brahmins how long they had dwelt in the mountain there, and what
their occupation was.</li>
<li>To this they replied, &ldquo;We have dwelt here during thirty
generations past, and our occupation is to tend cattle.&rdquo;</li>
<li>On [his] asking further as to their religious belief they
said, &ldquo;We pay homage and sacrifice to the sun and the moon, the rain
(water), and fire, according to the several seasons.</li>
<li>&ldquo;If one of us dies, we assemble and pray that he may be born in
the heaven of Brahma, and so escape further transmigrations.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The Buddha replied, &ldquo;This is not a safe way, not by it can you
benefit. The true way is to follow me, become true ascetics, and
practise complete self-composure with a view to obtain Nirvana&rdquo;; and
then he added these lines:</li>
<li>&ldquo;They who consider truth as that which is untrue, and regard
that which is untrue as truth&ndash;this is but to adopt heretical
opinions, and can never lead to true advantage.</li>
<li>&ldquo;But to know as truth that which is true, and to regard as
false that which is false, this is perfect rectitude, and this shall
bring true profit.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Everywhere in the world there is death&ndash;there is no escape
from it.</li>
<li>&ldquo;To consider this as the condition of all states of being,
that there is nothing born but must die, and, therefore, to desire to
escape birth and death, this is to exercise one&rsquo;s self in Religious
Truth.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The seventy Brahmins, hearing these words, desired at once to
become Shamans; and on being welcomed by Buddha, their hair fell off,
and they presented the appearance of true disciples.</li>
<li>Then they all set out to return to the Vihara, and on the road
certain thoughts about their wives and families troubled them, whilst
at the same time a heavy downpour of rain prevented their advance.</li>
<li>There were some ten houses on the roadside, in which they
sought shelter; but on entering one of them it was soon perceived that
through the roof the rain found its way, and there was but little
protection from the rain.</li>
<li>On this the Buddha added these lines, and said, &ldquo;As when a
house-roof is not properly secured, then the rain finds a way through
it and drops within, so when the thoughts are not carefully
controlled, the desires (sexual desires) will soon bore through all
our good resolutions.</li>
<li>&ldquo;But as when a roof is well stopped then the water cannot leak
through, so by controlling one&rsquo;s thoughts, and acting with reflection,
no such desires can arise or disturb us.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The seventy Brahmins, on hearing these lines, although
convinced that their desires were reprehensible, yet were not wholly
free from doubt; nevertheless they went forward.</li>
<li>As they advanced, they saw some scented wrapping on the
ground, and Buddha took the opportunity of calling their attention to
it; and after this, seeing some fish-gut also lying about, he directed
their notice to its ill odour, and then added these lines and said:</li>
<li>&ldquo;He who consorts with the low and the base, contracts the same
character as he who handles a foul substance; he goes from worse to
worse, and utterly without reason, he perfects himself in
wickedness.</li>
<li>&ldquo;But the wise man (consorting with the wise) contracts the
same character, even as the scent of a sweet odour adheres to him who
handles it; advancing in wisdom, practising virtue, he goes on to
perfection, and is satisfied.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The seventy Brahmins, hearing these verses, convinced that
their desire to return home and enjoy personal indulgence was the evil
taint that adhered to them, cast off such thoughts and, going forward,
came to the Vihara, and finally obtained the condition of Arhatas.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 2. Conversion of the Brahmins of Uttaravati</p>
<ol>
<li>Once the Buddha was residing in the Jetavana, at Shravasti, and
preaching his doctrine for the benefit of men and gods; there were in
a country to the eastward, called Uttaravati, a company of 500
Brahmins.</li>
<li>They had agreed to go together to the residence of a Nirgrantha
ascetic on the banks of the Ganges, who, by polluting himself with
dirt, etc., aspired to the condition of a Rishi.</li>
<li>On their way they were overtaken in the desert with thirst.
Seeing a tree, and hoping to find some human habitation near, they
hasened to it, but when they arrived there they found no sign of
life.</li>
<li>On this they raised their voices in lamentation. Suddenly from
the tree they heard the voice of the resident Spirit, who asked them
why they lamented so, and on hearing the reason, supplied them to the
full with drink and meat.</li>
<li>The Brahmins, ready to start onward, asked the Spirit what had
been his previous history, that he was thus born.</li>
<li>On which he explained that having gone to the assembly of
priests in Shravasti when Sudatta had bestowed the garden on the
Buddha, he had remained all night listening to the law Dhamma; and
having filled his drinking cup with water as he went, had bestowed it
in charity among the priests.</li>
<li>On his return next morning, his wife in anger asked him what
annoyance he had received, that he should stay away all night. On
which he replied that he was not annoyed, but he had been to listen to
the Buddha preaching at the Jetavana.</li>
<li>On this his wife began roundly to abuse the Buddha, and said,
&ldquo;This Gotama is but a mad preacher, who deceives the people,&rdquo; and so
on.</li>
<li>&ldquo;On this,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I resented not her statements, but rather
submitted to them; and so when I came to die I was born as a spirit,
but on account of my pusillanimity I was confined to this tree,&rdquo; and
then he recited these verses.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Sacrifices and such services are sources of misery, day and
night, a continual burden and anxiety.</li>
<li>&ldquo;To escape sorrow, and destroy the elements of the body, a man
should attend to the Law (of Buddha), and arrive at deliverance from
all worldly Rules of Religion (World Rishis).&rdquo;</li>
<li>The Brahmins, having heard these words, resolved themselves to
go to Shravasti, to the place where the Buddha was, and having
explained the object of their visit, the world-honoured said to
them:</li>
<li>&ldquo;Although a man goes naked with tangled hair, or though he
clothes himself with a few leaves or garment of bark, though he covers
himself with dirt and sleeps on the stones, what use is this in
getting rid of impure thoughts?</li>
<li>&ldquo;But he who neither contends [n]or kills, [n]or destroys
by fire, who desires not to get the victory, who is moved by goodwill
towards all the world&ndash;there is no ground in such a case for ill-will
or hate.</li>
<li>&ldquo;To sacrifice to spirits in order to find peace (merit), or,
after this life expecting reward&ndash;his happiness is not one quarter of
that man&rsquo;s who pays homage to the good.</li>
<li>&ldquo;He who is ever intent on good conduct and due reverence to
others, who always venerates old age,&ndash;four happy consequences
increasingly attend that man&ndash;beauty and strength, and life and
peace.&rdquo;</li>
<li>On hearing this from her husband, the wife became
reconciled.</li>
