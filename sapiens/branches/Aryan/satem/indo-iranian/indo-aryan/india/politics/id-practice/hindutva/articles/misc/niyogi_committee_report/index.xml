      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PREFACE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was the summer of 1982.  VOICE OF INDIA had hardly started its&#xA;programme of publications.  One fine morning an aged and visibly ailing&#xA;sannyasi dropped in at my office in New Delhi.  He had travelled all the&#xA;way from some place (I forget the name) in Andhra Pradesh.  Someone had&#xA;given him a copy of my booklet, &lt;em&gt;Hindu Society Under Siege&lt;/em&gt;, and having&#xA;read the chapter, ‘Residue of Christianism’, he had concluded that I was&#xA;the guy he had been looking for.  He introduced himself as Baba&#xA;Madhavdas and placed on my table printed copies of a summary of the&#xA;Niyogi Committee Report in English and Hindi, published by him.  Before&#xA;I could ask him to take a seat, he shot a question at me, “You must have&#xA;read the full Report?  What do you think of it?”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>03 ONE THE SUNSHINE OF ‘SECULARISM’</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ONE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE SUNSHINE OF ‘SECULARISM’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hindus from early seventeenth century Pandits of Tamil Nadu to Arun&#xA;Shourie in the closing years of the twentieth, have spent no end of ink&#xA;and breath to demolish the dogma of Christianity and denounce missionary&#xA;methods.  But it has hardly made any difference to the arrogance of&#xA;Christian theologians and aggressiveness of Christian missionaries.&#xA;That is because the dogma was never meant for discussion.  It is an&#xA;axiom of logic that that which has not been proved cannot and need not&#xA;be disproved.  Who has ever proved that the nondescript Jew who is&#xA;supposed to have been crucified by a Roman governor of Judaea in 33 AD&#xA;atoned for the sins of all humans for all time to come?  Who has ever&#xA;proved that those who accept that man as the only saviour will ascend to&#xA;a heaven of everlasting bliss, and those who do not will bum forever in&#xA;the blazing fire of hell?  Nor can the proclamation or the promise or&#xA;the threat be disproved.  High-sounding theological blah blah&#xA;notwithstanding, the fact remains that the dogma is no more than a&#xA;subterfuge for forging and wielding an organizational weapon for&#xA;mounting unprovoked aggression against other people.  It is high time&#xA;for Hindus to dismiss the dogma of Christianity with the contempt it&#xA;deserves, and pay attention to the Christian missionary apparatus&#xA;planted in their midst.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>04 TWO RIFT IN THE LUTE</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TWO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RIFT IN THE LUTE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Christian missionary orchestra in India after independence has&#xA;continued to rise from one crescendo to another with the applause of the&#xA;Nehruvian establishment manned by a brood of self-alienated Hindus&#xA;spawned by missionary-macaulayite education.  The only rift in the lute&#xA;has been K.M. Panikkar’s &lt;em&gt;Asia and Western Dominance&lt;/em&gt; published in 1953,&#xA;the &lt;em&gt;Report of the Christian Missionary Activities Committee Madhya&#xA;Pradesh&lt;/em&gt; published in 1956, Om Prakash Tyagi’s Bill on Freedom of&#xA;Religion introduced in the Lok Sabha in 1978, Arun Shourie’s&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Missionaries in India&lt;/em&gt; published in 1994 and the Maharashtra Freedom of&#xA;Religion Bill introduced in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly by&#xA;Mangal Prabhat Lodha, M.L.A. on 20 December 1996.  We shall summarise in&#xA;this chapter what these rifts revealed, and the reactions to them not&#xA;only from the Christian missionaries but also from the ‘secular’&#xA;establishment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REPORT OF THE CHRISTIAN MISSIONARY ACTIVITIES ENQUIRY COMMITTEE,&#xA;MADHYA PRADESH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VOLUME I&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;PART I&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHAPRER I. - INTRODUCTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Christian Missionary Activities Enquiry Committee was appointed by a&#xA;Resolution of the Government of Madhya Pradesh No. 318-716-V-Con., dated&#xA;the 14th of April, 1954 (Appendix I).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2. It was represented to Government from time to time that the&#xA;conversion of illiterate aboriginals and other backward people was&#xA;effected by the Christian Missionaries either forcibly or through fraud&#xA;or temptations of monetary gain, and the Government were informed that&#xA;the feelings of non-Christians were being offended by conversions&#xA;brought about by such methods.  The Christian Missionaries repudiated&#xA;before Government these allegations and charged local officials and&#xA;non-Christians of harassment and as the State Government found that an&#xA;agitation was growing on either side, it considered it desirable in. the&#xA;public interest to have a thorough enquiry made into the whole&#xA;question.  This Committee was, therefore, appointed, with Dr. M. Bhawani&#xA;Shankar Niyogi, M.A., LL.M., LL.D., Ex-Chairman, Public, Service&#xA;Commission, Madhya Pradesh, and retired Chief Justice, High Court of&#xA;judicature at Nagpur, as Chairman, and Shri Ghanshyam Singh Gupta,&#xA;B.Sc., LL.B., Ex-Speaker, Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly, Durg,&#xA;Shri Seth Govind Das, M. P., Jabalpur, Shri Kirtimant Rao, B.A. M.L.A.,&#xA;Ahiri, Tahsil Sironcha, District Chanda, Shri S. K. George, M.A., B.D.,&#xA;Professor, Commerce College, Wardha, and Shri B. P. Pathak, M.A., LL.B.,&#xA;Secretary to Government, Madhya Pradesh, Public Health Department, as&#xA;members.  Seth Govind Das resigned membership on 8th May, 1954 due to&#xA;his preoccupation with other work and was substituted by Shri Ratanlal&#xA;Malviya, B.A., LL.B., M. P., Manendragarh, (vide Resolution No.&#xA;419-860-V-Con., dated 8th May, 1954).  On his appointment to the Madhya&#xA;Pradesh Cabinet, Shri Kirtimant Rao also resigned and was succeeded by&#xA;Shri Bhanupratapsingh Giri Raj Singh Deo, M.P., of Komakhan, Tahsil&#xA;Mahasamund, District Raipur, (vide Resolution No. 18-279-XXX-MR, dated&#xA;4th January, 1955).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;PART II&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHAPTER I. - MISSIONS IN MADHYA PRADESH AND INDIA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Missionary organisations are so wide-spread in this country that they&#xA;seem to constitute “a State within the State”.  The Roman Catholic&#xA;Church is a highly centralised organisation, Spread over all the world&#xA;with power concentrated in the Pope, who, in the words of Pope Leo XIII&#xA;(in the encyclical letter, dated June 20, 1894) “holds upon this earth&#xA;the place of God Almighty”.  Hence he is crowned with a Triple Crown as&#xA;King of Heaven and of the Earth and of the Lower Regions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;PART IV&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHAPTER I. - CONCLUSIONS (FINDINGS)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On consideration of the material before us we arrive at the following&#xA;conclusions of fact:-&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1. Since the Constitution of India came into force there has been an&#xA;appreciable increase in the American personnel of the Missionary&#xA;organisations operating in India. This increase is obviously due to the&#xA;deliberate policy of the International Missionary Council to send&#xA;evangelistic teams to areas of special opportunities opened to the&#xA;Gospel by the Constitutional provision of religions freedom in some of&#xA;the newly independent nations, equipped with new resources for mass&#xA;evangelism through the press, film, radio and television. (Pages 27 and&#xA;31 of the &lt;em&gt;Missionary Obligation of the Church&lt;/em&gt;, 1952).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;DISTRICT RAIPUR&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 15th July 1954.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Christian Missionaries Activities Enquiry Committee, Madhya Pradesh,&#xA;met non-officials of Raipur and representatives of Hindus and Christians&#xA;in the Circuit House, Raipur, on the 15th July 1954, at 8 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deshpande, Pleader&lt;/strong&gt;, on behalf of the Hindu community, stressed the&#xA;point that due to the conversion the converts become anti-national.  He&#xA;said that the methods of conversion were also wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professor Jainarayan Pande&lt;/strong&gt; narrated the wrong methods of&#xA;conversion.  He said that in the hospitals the patients were given free&#xA;treatment with the condition that they would become Christians after&#xA;recovery. When a patient is confined to bed and has no hopes of&#xA;recovery, he is asked to pray to Christ, the only God, and not 33 crores&#xA;of gods as in Hinduism, and He will save you. If the patient survives,&#xA;he thinks, that it is Christ who saved him, and thus he is converted.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;DISTRICT BILASPUR&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 19th July 1954.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract of applications received on tour&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;table&gt;&#xA;  &lt;thead&gt;&#xA;      &lt;tr&gt;&#xA;          &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&#xA;          &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&#xA;      &lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/thead&gt;&#xA;  &lt;tbody&gt;&#xA;      &lt;tr&gt;&#xA;          &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Names (if legible) and number of signatories, place, etc.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;          &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nature of complaint and request&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;      &lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;      &lt;tr&gt;&#xA;          &lt;td&gt;(1)&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;          &lt;td&gt;(2)&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;      &lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;      &lt;tr&gt;&#xA;          &lt;td&gt;Shri S. P. Konher, Tilak nagar, Bilaspur.&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;          &lt;td&gt;Activities of Christians are anti-national. Hindi songs in English style, English manners, translation of bible in faulty Hindi. Non-Christians given inferior treatment. Bible classes compulsory.&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;      &lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;      &lt;tr&gt;&#xA;          &lt;td&gt;Chhabaldas s/o Ottanmal, Sindhi Colony, D. 14, Bilaspur.&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;          &lt;td&gt;A sufferer of epileptic fits. Does not want help from mission. Requests maintenance allowance or compensation of his verified claims.&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;      &lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;      &lt;tr&gt;&#xA;          &lt;td&gt;Uditnarayan Mishra, P. O. Pendra, Ex-Teacher.&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;          &lt;td&gt;After 20 years, removed from service. When requested to send for training, was informed that mission does not allow non-Christians to be sent for training. Gita and Ramayana teaching was done by me as remarked by Shri Mehta, D. I. S. Therefore I was removed from service. Government permission not taken for removing me. I may be ordered to be reinstated in service.&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;      &lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;      &lt;tr&gt;&#xA;          &lt;td&gt;Nilkanth Krishnarao Diggraskar, Pradhan, Arya Samaj, Bilaspur City.&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;          &lt;td&gt;Six examples given of how advantage is taken of miserable, ignorant and poor people for conversion. Also suggests some remedies for solving the problem.&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;      &lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;      &lt;tr&gt;&#xA;          &lt;td&gt;Bajrang Prasad Muraraka, L. M. P., Private Medical Practitioner, Sadar Bazar, Bilasput, M. P.&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;          &lt;td&gt;Help received by them from America.  Four missions, viz.  Disciples Christ Mission, Church of Christ Mission, Evangelical Mission, Mennonite Mission, working in the district with centres at Takhatpur, Jarhagaon, Mungeli, Fastarpur, Setganga, Pendra, Champa, Paraghat and Baitaipur.  Baptisma register, Books, school or boarding house register, loan register of Mrs. Plad and Makgebura of Champa, Jarhagaon, Baitaipur and of other schools should be seen by the committee itself.  Arbitration proceedings of 1946 from Baitalpur by Shri Khistic E.-A. C., should be scrutinised.  Some remedies to check their activities also suggested.&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;      &lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;      &lt;tr&gt;&#xA;          &lt;td&gt;Trimbak Yadeo Dehankar, Advocate, Tilaknagar, Bilaspur.&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;          &lt;td&gt;Christians have employed the methods of inducement, tyranny and show of authority for conversion purposes. They have helped foreigners to rule our country, and have created a feeling of inferiority complex and internal differences. Suggests non-entry of foreign missionaries and the despatch of existing persons from India. Also Indian control over Christian funds and activities.&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;      &lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;      &lt;tr&gt;&#xA;          &lt;td&gt;Shri Ramacharan Rai, President, M. C., Bilaspur and other citizens.&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;          &lt;td&gt;Conversion through religious preachings, political means and social disunity. Methods are through hospitals, hatred of other religious service allurements and. financial aid for litigation. Indian culture is being destroyed and foreign culture spread in various ways Replies given to allegations made by Christians.  Some suggestions also given for checking missionary activities.&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;      &lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;      &lt;tr&gt;&#xA;          &lt;td&gt;Shri M. K. Chitale, Pleader&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;          &lt;td&gt;Missionaries offer temptations of various nature. No foreign missionary should be allowed to come to India hereafter.  They should not be allowed to open institutions of social service. Existing institutions should be taken over by Government.  Has not much grievance against Indian Christians.&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;      &lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;      &lt;tr&gt;&#xA;          &lt;td&gt;Shri C. M. Otalwar, Advocate, Shri Ramkrishna Pande, Editor Parakram, and five others.&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;          &lt;td&gt;Mission institutions should not be given Government grants. Missionaries are taking active part in politics. They get money from America. Some suggestions are made to Government regarding how missionary activities should be checked. (One application from Padmabai Thakur also attached wherein she complains that she was forcibly converted and married to a Christian.  She has been deprived of her land tnd earnings.).&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;      &lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/tbody&gt;&#xA;&lt;/table&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;BILASPUR&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;DISTRICT AMRAVATI&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract of applications received on tour of Amravati&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;table&gt;&#xA;  &lt;thead&gt;&#xA;      &lt;tr&gt;&#xA;          &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&#xA;          &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&#xA;      &lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/thead&gt;&#xA;  &lt;tbody&gt;&#xA;      &lt;tr&gt;&#xA;          &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Names (if legible) and number of signatories, place, etc.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;          &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nature of complaint and request&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;      &lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;      &lt;tr&gt;&#xA;          &lt;td&gt;(1)&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;          &lt;td&gt;(2)&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;      &lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;      &lt;tr&gt;&#xA;          &lt;td&gt;President, Bharativa Jansangh Nagar, Amravati.&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;          &lt;td&gt;Missionaries take advantage of the poverty and miserable condition of the people.  The converts begin to hate Hinduism.  They put obstacles in the work of adivasis.  Miss Cluth refused to pay sales tax saying that it was not her Government.  This shows anti-national tendencies.  If they want to really help Indians, they should send money to India Government.  Christian prayers are offered by school boys in Holy Cross Convert.  Why should institutions receiving fees from students and grants from local bodies be allowed to preach religious prayers?&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;      &lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;      &lt;tr&gt;&#xA;          &lt;td&gt;John Rodd, Achalpur Camp.&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;          &lt;td&gt;Complaint against Rev. Major, Superintendent, Kothara Leprosy Home, because he had discharged me on the ground that I was not doing spiritual, evangelistic and proselytising work.  He has victimised others and intends to treat some more similarly as soon as the Comrrjittee leaves Berar.&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;      &lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;      &lt;tr&gt;&#xA;          &lt;td&gt;Prabhudas (Manikrao) Januji Hanote, Kothara, Achalpur.&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;          &lt;td&gt;I come from Nerpinglai, tahsil Morsi, district Amravati. 1 came to Kothara Leprosy Hospital in 1937, when I was 12.  Shri Widder was Superintendent then.  He used to preach and baptise those who desired.  They are never forced by anybody to become Christian.  When I was on death bed, I took baptism in 1947. The result was that I began to recover gradually. Now I am one of the panchas. In the panchas there is one pastor, one secretary and one preacher and about 100 patient members. Those who are willing are given baptisma after the panchas satisfy themselves. Children are not baptised without the consent of their parents. Funds required for religious purposes are raised by contribution and donations from foreigners.&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;      &lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;      &lt;tr&gt;&#xA;          &lt;td&gt;Shri T. H. Major, Superintendent, Kothara Leprosy Home.&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;          &lt;td&gt;Kothara is the property of the Mission to Lepers and the administration is by a Superintendent lent from the local mission (Central India Baptist Mission), financed by M. P. Government grant and annual graiit from the Mission to Lepers. There are 299 patients at present, whose records are properly maintained. Out of 300 about 35 patients attend the meeting. Preaching, conversions and baptisms have been all done by national christians chosen from among the patients and the healthy staff.  186 conversions of patients since 1947 to date at the leper home. Out of 299, 100 are Christians. There is agricultural programme at Kothara Leprosy hospital, occupational training programme for patients, and future plans costing Rs. 2,20,892.&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;      &lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;      &lt;tr&gt;&#xA;          &lt;td&gt;Gyani Tarasingha, Pashim Wibhag, (Western Madhya Pradesh) Vidarbha Adiwasi Mukhya Karyalaya, Parat wada.&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;          &lt;td&gt;Though grant is received by the mission, there is no good arrangement of patients regarding food. They are given heavy work if they do not agree to be converted willingly. One instance of Bhikaji Sakharam of Ghule is quoted. Those who were not willing to be converted, were discharged from the hospital.  Most of the 30 boys in the boarding have been converted. Strong and stout patients are kept even for 15 years and given work. There is no good arrangement regarding food, etc.  With the result that there was strike by the patients in this leprosy home. Unqualified persons give medicines and injections.  Holidays are not given on important Hindu and national festivals in this home.&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;      &lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/tbody&gt;&#xA;&lt;/table&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shri Khaparde, ex-Minister, Amravati:&lt;/strong&gt; My main argument is that if a&#xA;man becomes Christian he feels that his, both blood and skin, are&#xA;outside the boundaries of this country.  It is in Europe, it is in&#xA;America, it is in Africa, but it is not in India. His brothers and&#xA;relations are all over the world outside India.  Therefore, his sympathy&#xA;goes outside the boundaries of India and if some day a war breaks out&#xA;between India and, any other western country he is likely to help those&#xA;foreigners rather than us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He was converted two years ago.&#xA;Americans come to villages and preach their religion.  American ladies&#xA;also come.  This is going on since the last two years.  Formerly they&#xA;came but not so often and in such large numbers. Buda’s house caught&#xA;fire after about 4 months of his conversion.  It was Falgun month, at&#xA;about 8 p. m. Two more houses adjoining his also caught fire.  Buda did&#xA;riot ask for any help.  We tried to help and could save the adjoining&#xA;houses.  Had Buda asked for any help, we would have rendered it. Buda&#xA;does not say that his house was burnt by Hindus.  He said in the&#xA;presence of all that it caught fire by accident of a chimney.  He has&#xA;reconstructed it.  Besides prachar, there is also distribution of&#xA;medicine, which is sometimes one by a lady from Dawali.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The main activity of the Christians is to carry on anti-Hindu propaganda and to convert the illiterate persons.  Their prachar is in the weekly markets and on festival days in abusive language against Hindu Gods particularly Lord Krishna. In hospitals patients are required to attend prayers. Discharge to a patient is delayed and patient is persuaded to embrace Christianity and if the attempts fail heavy bills are charged   History shows, that conversion is dangerous to national unity and solidarity. American missionaries are pouring the money not on t of humanitarian view but for conversions and ultimately break the nation.&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;      &lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/tbody&gt;&#xA;&lt;/table&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;BASIM&lt;/p&gt;</description>

B.,&#xA;is a great disaster in our country, which will destroy it.  Government&#xA;should, therefore, take a step to check it.  Missionaries may live in&#xA;this country.  Hindu religion does not hate them.  But they should not&#xA;enter into objectionable activities.  I am not in a position to give the&#xA;number of converts since 1947.  There are a girl’s school and a boarding&#xA;here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Allurement of money to innocent people, which may be in&#xA;the form of help to needy persons, is practised in this area.  Similarly&#xA;free education of children.  People who were formerly Gond, Baigas and&#xA;Pardhans are now calling themselves Christians.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;DISTRICT JABALPUR&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 15th November 1954.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Chairman explained the object of the State Government in appointing&#xA;the Committee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shri Sohanlal Agarwal, Secretary, Vedic S.R. Samiti and Secretary,&#xA;Arya Samaj:&lt;/strong&gt; The facts stated in the memorandum presented by me are&#xA;given as a result of my experience.  Government do not make any&#xA;provision for schools and, therefore, missionaries have got an&#xA;opportunity of working in Jabalpur.  Christian mothers are put in charge&#xA;of children.  No national songs are sung in the schools.  Quarters are&#xA;provided for lady teachers and there is strict control over them.&#xA;Church is situated in school premises.  This atmosphere is responsible&#xA;for missionary activities.  Facilities afforded by Government are&#xA;enjoyed by Christian students.  Christian students have been maintained&#xA;at the cost of institutions at some places.  Hindu Gods and Goddesses&#xA;are ridiculed in schools.  On 21st December 1953, a rehearsal of a drama&#xA;was being given in a Christian Mission School of Methodist Church.&#xA;Kalimata worship was condemned and Christian religion impressed in the&#xA;drama.  Shri Ambikaprasad Saraf, a teacher in the school, very strongly&#xA;protested against this.  Hindu students also protested and the drama was&#xA;not played.  Shri Ambikaprasadji’s services were terminated.  Some Hindu&#xA;students were rusticated.  Education Department held enquiries into the&#xA;matter but it was one-sided because they did not ask any of the Hindu&#xA;teachers and students.  The teacher was appointed by the Education&#xA;Department in another school.  The students were admitted to the school&#xA;and Bible reading was also stopped.  A student was beaten and no action&#xA;was taken though a complaint was made to the police.  The boy’s father&#xA;will be produced before you whenever desired.  August 15th was&#xA;celebrated on the 13th in the Johnson’s Girls’ School, because 15th was&#xA;Sunday and it is considered a religious day.  A drama was staged in&#xA;which an Indian National Flag was pulled down and ten girls in the drama&#xA;desired that the Cross Flag should he pitched high above it.  We will&#xA;prove this allegation. A copy of the next of the drama will be handed&#xA;over to you.  If I am not telling the truth, I stand for prosecution.&#xA;The names of President, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the Indian&#xA;Republic are decried in American Christian magazines abroad.  We will&#xA;supply you a copy of such a magazine.  Foreigners support the offices&#xA;here.  A Christian pracharak, Mr. Pande had been to my house for&#xA;preaching. He gave a book.  A police report was made about this.  It was&#xA;also observed that some small toy arms were freely distributed to&#xA;children.  Powdered milk is distributed to Fatma Club freely in the&#xA;Gondpura.  Christians collect boys, sing a song and distribute them alms&#xA;and milk.  We have got witnesses who will say what allurements have been&#xA;given to them.  Why people are living in Christian compounds and how and&#xA;why they were brought there may also be examined which will throw light.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There are 21 teachers, out of whom four are Hindus.&#xA;Average total expenditure of the school per year is Rs. 33,000.  Rs.&#xA;9,613 is received from the Church, Rs. 6,883 from Government grant and&#xA;Rs. 5,683 by way of subsidy for compensatory cost of living allowance.&#xA;Gospel is taught in the Bible class, which is conducted in the school.&#xA;It is not compulsory but majority of non-Christi-an students attend it.&#xA;Roll is not called in the class.  Fifteen per cent of the students&#xA;regularly keep away from this class.  There are 18 Harijan and 13&#xA;aboriginal students who are free.  Out of 124 Christians, 20 and out of&#xA;415 non-Christians, 37 students are free.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Conversion is always individual in nature.  As far as I know when&#xA;even more than one person become Christian, they all individually make&#xA;profession of their faith.  It is not our practice to baptise people as&#xA;a group on the confession of one person.  Even in on, family, husband&#xA;and wife make profession of their faith individually.  The children of&#xA;such a family may be baptized according to the practice of some church&#xA;if the parents so desire.  The same is true in case of parents who are&#xA;Christians by birth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It is our position and belief that people accept Christ&#xA;individually.  Many times this is just one individual of a family, but&#xA;it may also be more than one member of a family.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I am sorry I do not have the figures of the total number of&#xA;Christians and non-Christians in the District of Mandla, nor the numbers&#xA;as divided as in Question 1. But the number of Christians belonging to&#xA;the Church of India is approximately 600.  This number has been static&#xA;for many years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We have kept no such record as we do not recognize castes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2. A small rise in the population of our Church is mostly due to&#xA;natural increase.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3. Out of about 4,000 members in our Church, at present, about 94 per&#xA;cent are born Christians (i.e., 240 converts).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;4. In our churches in the districts of Sagar, Chhindwara, Betul and&#xA;Baikunthpur tahsil, 154 converts have been admitted into our fold since&#xA;1947.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Three out of four adult immigrants, representing two families, with&#xA;their children, now residing in the village.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;4. A real conversion is a heart-change matter.  Therefore, number known&#xA;only to God.  One convert only has been baptised from scheduled caste&#xA;(December 1950).  Conversion is necessarily an individual matter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Replies submitted by Shri L. E. Hartman, Amravati Camp, Berar, Mission&#xA;Bungalow, Amravati Camp, Berar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To - Committee appointed to inquire into activities of missionaries.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dear Sirs,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I, the. undersigned, have drawn up the following answers to your&#xA;Questionnaire in conjunction with the following: Rev.  A. S. Zadhav,&#xA;local priest of the Church of England in Amravati and Badnera, Rev.  A.&#xA;V. Bhambal, pastor of the local church of the Church of North India here&#xA;in Chaprasipur, Amravati Camp, and Rev. S. J. Kokane, pastor of the&#xA;local church of the Christian and Missionary Alliance of U. S. A. in&#xA;Ambapeth, Amravati.  This may, therefore, be considered the work of a&#xA;committee consisting of the four of us.  We are answering for the&#xA;Protestant Christians only in Arvi, Amravati and Chandur talukas.  At&#xA;the time I drew up these answers in the rough, Rev. T. A. Amstutz of&#xA;Chandur-Railway, had not returned from the furlough, but now he has&#xA;returned and I think he also is sending in answers.  If so, the figures&#xA;he gives should be deducted from the ones I am giving rather than added&#xA;to them as I am giving the totals for the three talukas and he will&#xA;probably give the figures for Arvi and Chandur.  I have not seen him for&#xA;some days.  That is why I don’t know for certain what he is doing, but&#xA;he told me he had received one of the Questionnaires.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There is one Mission Hospital in the Yeotmal district.  It is a&#xA;general hospital known as Umri Mission Hospital.  It was started in July&#xA;1951.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;79. Admission is allowed to all depending only on limitation of&#xA;accommodations available and services available.  No criterion of the&#xA;patient’s religion is made to determine his admission.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The General Missionary Secretary of Free Methodist Mission had paid&#xA;a visit to Yeotmal in the year 1948 and we other, Christians who do not&#xA;work for the Mission had put a representation, dated April 4, 1948,&#xA;before him explaining him how Christians like us are treated by the&#xA;Missionaries, vide paragraph 2 of our letter quoted above (original and&#xA;copy enclosed).  To this, he has replied on August 6, 1948, in paragraph&#xA;4 of his letter stating that Missionaries were sent to India in the&#xA;first instance to serve the real needs of the people in your country.&#xA;In paragraph 14 of his letter he has stated that he has drawn the&#xA;attention of the Director of the Commission on Missions and accordingly&#xA;we have brought this to the notice of the Chairman of this Mission in&#xA;India and requested him whether he got any instructions from the&#xA;Directors regarding our grievances in paragraph 6 of our letter dated&#xA;November 27, 1948 (original and copy enclosed).  To this the Chairman&#xA;never replied.  In the mean the Missionaries here got angry with us&#xA;because we continued our correspondence with the General Missionary&#xA;Secretary in U. S. A.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Replies submitted by Shri R. W. Scott, Secretary, National Christian&#xA;Council&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To - The Secretary, Christian Missionaries Enquiry Committee,&#xA;Secretariat Building, Nagpur-1.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dear Sirs,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In answer to the questionnaire I wish to submit the following.  May I&#xA;make one or two general comments before doing so.  First, it seems to me&#xA;that the tone, as well as the character, of some questions reflects the&#xA;attitude that the Christian position is weak and open to suspicion in&#xA;certain fundamental respects.  Such are questions 10 and 77.  In an&#xA;impartial investigation it would seem to be necessary to give those&#xA;against whom allegations have been made an opportunity of presenting&#xA;their case without having been judged in advance.  Secondly, I as a&#xA;missionary, who has spent half his life happily in India, have rejoiced&#xA;to see our Nation’s development away from religious and communal tension&#xA;towards a harmony and understanding of each other’s point of view in&#xA;vital matters of the mind and spirit. But I must confess to the&#xA;conclusion that the questionnaire is weighed against the Christian.&#xA;whether Indian or foreign.  There may be some extreme cases in view when&#xA;certain questions were framed but these can hardly be considered&#xA;normative.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The Jabalpur Christians&#xA;in their resolution appearing in the “Amrit Bazar Patrika”, dated the&#xA;27th November 1954, desired the Government to wind up your Enquiry&#xA;also.  They were apparently working under the leadership of the foreign&#xA;missionaries.  You will, therefore, kindly urge upon &amp;rsquo;the Government to&#xA;ask the foreign Christian Missionaries to quit India at once.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Replies submitted by Shri T. Y. Dehankar, President, Bar Association,&#xA;and six others of Bilaspur&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1. According to the Census Report the population was as below:-&#xA;1931-5,216, 1941-5,552 and 1951-9,006.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These figures are from census report but they are also not correct.  The&#xA;increase in the Christian population is more than indicated in these&#xA;census.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2. The reason of rise in Christian population is mainly due to&#xA;conversion and the fall in the population of scheduled tribe and caste&#xA;is due to this alone.  Scheduled tribe and caste being poor are prone to&#xA;be easy victims of Christian missionaries.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Answer: We have no figures for the years 1947 and 1954 for the&#xA;districts.  As regards 1951 we have census figures for both the&#xA;districts – Raigarh and Surguja.  For 1941 we possess figures only for&#xA;Jashpur Sub-Division.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jashpur Sub-Division - 1941&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Total Population – 223,632&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Christians – 56,188&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Non-Christians – 167,444&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Scheduled Tribes – 168,811&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Scheduled Castes – 13,256&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Statement made before the Christian Missionary Activities Enquiry&#xA;Committee.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CAMP: RAIPUR (22-7-1955)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No. 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Name&lt;/em&gt;-Mahant Vaishnaodas.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Father’s name&lt;/em&gt;-Shri Swami Bajrangdas.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Caste&lt;/em&gt;-Vaishnao.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Age&lt;/em&gt;-50.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Occupation&lt;/em&gt;-Mahant, Dudhadhari Math.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Address&lt;/em&gt;-Raipur.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I confirm the statement which I have filed in reply to the&#xA;questionnaire.  I have not cared to enquire as to the exact&#xA;denominations of the Missions, which are working here but I have been&#xA;observing that the Missions have been trying to propagate their religion&#xA;from 40 years but they have intensified their efforts since 1948 after&#xA;India attained Independence.  The number of preachers has been&#xA;increased.  The preachers include foreigners as well as Indians who have&#xA;been converted to Christianity. I came across a Christian school&#xA;teacher, who had come from Pharsabhadar to my village Thelki, told me&#xA;that although he was actually getting Rs. 30, his salary was shown Rs.&#xA;60 in order to get increased grants.  He had come to induce a farmer by&#xA;name Dehra resident of my village to commit his son to his charge for&#xA;education.  The boy may be about 5 to 6 years of age.  The farmer came&#xA;to consult me.  He is Satnami by caste.  So I advised him not to comply&#xA;with the preacher’s request as I thought that once he goes under the&#xA;Christian influence he would embrace Christianity. The teacher generally&#xA;goes out for preaching and he tries to induce the people to send their&#xA;sons to is school telling them that by becoming Christians they will&#xA;improve their social status as in Hindu society the Satnamis are not&#xA;treated with respect.  I learnt from people that the preachers even&#xA;declare that the King Janak was a Christian-pointing out a text of&#xA;Tulsidas’s Ramayan in which the word Girja occurs Girja Pujan Janani&#xA;Pathai Sar Samip Giraja Griha Soha.  As the Hindi equivalent for church&#xA;is Girja Ghar, the preachers try to mislead the people.  The people, who&#xA;actually heard the preacher, told me about this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I am residing at Bilaspur, since 1918.&#xA;I was in Congress up to 1946, which I had given up because I was&#xA;appointed as Public Prosecutor.  Now from 1946 to 1952 I was Public&#xA;Prosecutor.  During the general elections of 1951, I had to tour&#xA;extensively in the Takhatpur and Kota constituency.  I came in direct&#xA;contact with the Christian community at Pendra, during the said&#xA;election.  After 1952, I have been continuously touring in the villages&#xA;and contacting people of various communities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For services rendered to&#xA;the Raj family, our family was granted two villages Mafi named Amli&#xA;Digra and Sarasmar (Lakshmipur).  These villages were originally&#xA;inhabited by Uraons and other Adivasis.  Till 1939, there was no&#xA;Christian in these villages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One Bulchu Uraon had taken up residence in our village from Mangarpur.&#xA;He wanted financial help to put up an embankment in a neighbouring&#xA;village, but I objected and asked him to have an embankment in the&#xA;village in which he resided.  He, therefore, left the village and took&#xA;up residence at Ludeg.  He complained to the foreign Missionary Padri at&#xA;Ludeg and one day the Padri came to our village and asked me why I was&#xA;troubling Bulchu and others by not allowing them money for putting up an&#xA;embankment.  He also said that he would advance loan and help Uraons for&#xA;the embankment.  The Padri was a foreigner and had a beard. I do not&#xA;know his name.  Money was advanced to Bulchu in consequence of which he&#xA;and his family were made Christians.  I know that he had been made a&#xA;Christian because of the loan advanced to him as it has become an open&#xA;secret in the area that foreign Missionaries make converts by advancing&#xA;such loans.  After Bulchu’s conversion, foreign Missionaries started&#xA;visiting our village regularly.  After some time it was widely&#xA;circulated that Christians were not troubled by ghosts, etc.  As a&#xA;result of their efforts almost the entire village of Lakshmipur (Saras)&#xA;was converted to Christianity.  At that time the then Ruler of&#xA;Dharamjaigarh was a minor and the Estate was under superintendence.&#xA;When the Ruler assumed Gaddi, I complained to him about the manner in&#xA;which the whole village and other villages had been converted I do not&#xA;know whether any enquiry was made but after some time an Act was passed&#xA;which prevented change of faith induced by force, fraud, promises, etc.&#xA;This Act was widely notified and entries in the Wajib-ul-urj was made.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I am a born Christian and belong to the Roman&#xA;Catholic Church.  From 1948 to 1952 I worked as a teacher in an Adiwasi&#xA;School run by the Tribal Welfare Department.  The local Christians&#xA;outcast me because I worked in that school.  When I lost my child, the&#xA;local Christians did not attend the funeral.  In the year 1952, I lost&#xA;my wife and when my father went to ask the local Christians to attend&#xA;the funeral they refused saying that I had been outcast because I had&#xA;worked in the Tribal Welfare Department Adiwasi School.  The dead body&#xA;of my wife was lying for 2 days.  I asked the village pracharak who is&#xA;the Mukhiya “leader” of the Christians to perform the funeral rites but&#xA;he declined saying that I had been outcast.  Ultimately, I had to send&#xA;word to some non-Christians in the neighbouring village Ghutmunda who&#xA;came and the funeral rites were performed.  The dead body was not&#xA;allowed to be buried in the Christian graveyard and I had to bury it at&#xA;some distance there from.  When they had outcast me, they had prevented&#xA;me from attending the Church.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I passed my Matriculation&#xA;from there.  Bible is taught in Primary classes compulsorily.  It is&#xA;also taught in the Middle and High Schools.  Students need not attend&#xA;the Bible class.  Morning prayer is compulsory for all from the Primary&#xA;to the High School standards.  The prayer is a Christian Prayer.  All&#xA;Saturdays and Sundays are observed as holidays for the whole school. I&#xA;don’t know why the school is closed on these days.  In my time&#xA;non-Christian boarders also used to go to the Churches for prayer.  They&#xA;were only one or two in number.  The boarders have also to go&#xA;compulsorily for prayers in Churches on Sundays.  Sometimes our teachers&#xA;in the School used to go in numbers and groups on Saturdays for&#xA;preaching outside Jabalpur.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In fact it is expected of him that he&#xA;should be both a good doctor and a good witness for Jesus Christ.  The&#xA;one cannot be divorced from the other.  The efficient and kindly&#xA;physical treatment of a patient by a Christian doctor, though necessary,&#xA;is not enough.  He has to witness Christ with words to everybody as also&#xA;to his patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oral Statement made before the Christian Missionary Activities Enquiry&#xA;Committee.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;MANDLA&lt;br&gt;&#xA;(15-8-55)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No. 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Name&lt;/em&gt;-Rambharos Agarwal.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Father’s name&lt;/em&gt;-Seth Bhaddelai.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Occupation&lt;/em&gt;-Lawyer.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Residence&lt;/em&gt;-Mandla.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have sent my reply to the Committee’s questionnaire, and my honest&#xA;views are expressed therein.  The litigants of Salhedanda village of&#xA;Mandla tahsil by name Luta and Hazari were coerced by one Padri byname&#xA;Anthony Thudiyhill (Roman Catholic) to effect a compromise of their case&#xA;on pain of dire consequences.  Being afraid, they effected a&#xA;compromise.  This matter went to the Civil Court and one of the findings&#xA;of the Court is that the compromise was not voluntary but a result of&#xA;undue pressure by the Padri.  The motives, as I understand, must be to&#xA;show his influence and superiority in that village with a view to&#xA;convert people to Roman Catholic faith.  Other persons of Salhedanda&#xA;have made complaints to the Deputy Commissioner through the District&#xA;Congress Committee, Mandla, about undue pressure of this Church, It is&#xA;not merely my information but also my personal knowledge that loans were&#xA;advanced by the Roman Catholic Missionaries with a view to convert&#xA;people to Christianity.  There is another Mission also working in the&#xA;Mandla district.  It is now called Gondwana Mission but no instances of&#xA;objectionable methods have come to my notice with regard to their&#xA;working.  I file a statement today.  In this I have suggested remedies&#xA;to protect an aboriginal in his ancestral faith.  On the analogy of the&#xA;Land Acquisition Act I say that the permission of the Deputy&#xA;Commissioner should be necessary for an aboriginal leaving his ancestral&#xA;faith, but not so when he comes back to his ancestral faith.  In a&#xA;backward tract like Mandla district, in my opinion, officers of high&#xA;character and efficiency should be posted.  At present the general&#xA;opinion is that those who are sent here are sent by way of some sort of&#xA;punishment for their not very efficient work elsewhere.  In fact the&#xA;process should be reversed.  Men of proved efficiency and character&#xA;should be posted here as backward people need more sympathy and more&#xA;looking after their interests than those in the advanced areas.  My&#xA;written reply to question No. 42 of the questionnaire is based on my&#xA;belief that conversion not only to Roman Catholic faith but also to any&#xA;denomination of Christianity would lessen an aboriginal’s affiliation as&#xA;an Indian though I grant that this cannot be said of highly placed and&#xA;intelligent men and women.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Statement made before the Christian Missionary Activities Enquiry&#xA;Committee.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;KHANDWA&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No. 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(17-8-55)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Name&lt;/em&gt;-Ramchandra Tiwari.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Father’s name&lt;/em&gt;-Ishwariprasad Tiwari.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Occupation&lt;/em&gt;.-Cinema Owner.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Residence&lt;/em&gt;.-Khandwa.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am District Organiser of the Bharat Sewak Samaj. I was President of&#xA;the Bharat Sewak Samaj.  During my work as President of the Harijan Sewa&#xA;Samaj I had occasions to move in the interior to contact the Harijans&#xA;particularly the Balahi Community and work amongst them.  I received&#xA;complaints that the R. C. Church in their schools, after the admission&#xA;of their children, show their Jat as Christian and also change their&#xA;names to Christian names on occasions suitable to them.  Many Balahis&#xA;and guardians of the children complained to me.  They also give free&#xA;boarding and lodging to their children in order to convert them to&#xA;Christianity, and ask their parents to attend the church as also to the&#xA;children to attend the church. I made enquiries myself and sent written&#xA;complaints to the Deputy Commissioner the District Inspector of Schools,&#xA;and the Secretary of this Committee.  There were enquiries made both&#xA;open and confidential.  Open enquiries were made by the A. D. M. Shri&#xA;Deosthale, and Magistrate, 2nd class, Shri Gadre, and confidential&#xA;enquiry by Shri Naik, A.D.I.S. From the open enquiry I found that the&#xA;allegation made by me were really not enough, there were more serious&#xA;and more varied things also that were done by the Missionary.  For&#xA;instance, they used to have their paid pracharaks, who really act as&#xA;informers, giving them information about the village or mohalla&#xA;activities.  When a child is born, the Missionary is informed by these&#xA;pracharaks and some nurse comes and helps in the delivery and also&#xA;sprinkles water and then, without the knowledge of their parents, writes&#xA;their Christian names in their Church registers.  The nun or the priest&#xA;sprinkles the water.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

His natural father’s name was Malayya.  He was born of his&#xA;father’s mistress on his mother’s death.  When he was aged about 1½&#xA;years, his genetive father wished to part with this boy as well as&#xA;another daughter he had.  The daughter was given over to one Jain by&#xA;name Shamlal.  This boy was being to be handed over to a muslim. When I&#xA;came to know about this I handed over the boy to a gentleman by name&#xA;Allya Munglaya who has brought him up as his own son as he had no other&#xA;child.  About two or three years ago the Pastor of the Church of Pusad&#xA;known as Palak induced this boy, Shankar Allaya, to leave his home by&#xA;the offer of a girl in marriage and service with the idea that he should&#xA;be converted to Christianity.  The boy left Pusad.  When his mother by&#xA;name Gangamwar, i.e., Allaya’s wife learnt about it she approached me&#xA;and I advised her to make a complaint to the police.  As directed by the&#xA;police officer she complained that her son had disappeared.  The police&#xA;officer did not want her to report against the pastor that he had taken&#xA;away her son.  Four or five days later the boy Shankar returned to&#xA;Pusad.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I have been in India&#xA;since 1920 and in Amravati since January 1940.  I have no complaints to&#xA;make against any officers.  I go out to preach in the villages.  I also&#xA;preach in churches in Amravati and Badnera.  I preach in open places&#xA;everywhere in villages especially to public including Muslims and&#xA;Hindus.  Once in a while there was some disturbance but as a rule people&#xA;do not disturb.  I have already given in my statement the report of the&#xA;number of conversions made every year since 1947, of Chandur, Arvi and&#xA;Amravati taluq.  The message that we give is that there is One God.  He&#xA;is Holy.  He hates sin.  A man is a sinner and only through Jesus Christ&#xA;can man be saved from his sins.  Our positive job is to preach&#xA;Christianity and not to attack other religions.  I was in America in&#xA;1947-48.  I have not heard of any leaflets circulated in America calling&#xA;for teams to go out to all parts of the world to convert people to&#xA;Christianity to combat Communism.  It may be true but I do not know. I&#xA;am not saying that it is false.  I am Chairman of the Church Council,&#xA;which includes Amravati, Chandur and Arvi taluqs.  As I am being&#xA;transferred from this place I may be handing over my charge to Rev.&#xA;Stengle any day. I have already handed over charge as a Missionary in&#xA;charge to Mr. Stengle and before going from here I shall be giving over&#xA;charge of Church to Rev. Kokne.  In 1947, there were five Missionaries&#xA;and now they are seven but they will be five when I and my wife leave&#xA;the place.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I was in the Inter class when&#xA;I left the college.  The school was abolished in 1910 by Government.  In&#xA;1910 I went to Wal to study Sanskrit literature according to the old&#xA;system.  I spent there five years.  I was then spreading the knowledge&#xA;of Vedant, Philosophy and reciting Geeta to the public.  During the&#xA;first war I travelled from Badrinath to Rameshwar. I was studying at&#xA;Benaras for six months, vedic literature.  After the first world war,&#xA;i.e., beginning of 1919 I went to America for study. I studied for four&#xA;years in the California University to study economics and sociology and&#xA;I got my M. A. Degree there. I fell ill with pleuracy.  I returned to&#xA;India in 1924.  In 1946 to 1948 I was Deputy Speaker of the Legislative&#xA;Assembly. I came to stay in Buldana in 1925 as the climatic conditions&#xA;were suitable to me.  Then I toured from Nagpur to Belgaum for lectures&#xA;in sociology, economics and political theory. I joined congress in 1930&#xA;and took part in all the congress movements.  I collected Rs. three lacs&#xA;in Buldana district to start a T. B. Sanitorium.  It is now Government’s&#xA;hospital.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I live in the compound of Missionary bungalow.&#xA;The name of the Missionary is Lewellan from America. I have been&#xA;residing here from 1¼ years.  I do not know how to tell lies because God&#xA;has taught me to speak truth. I shall never tell lie before the&#xA;Commission.  I get Rs. 55 per month from Synod. I belong to the Alliance&#xA;Mission. I am a preacher here for the last 1¼  years. I preach in&#xA;Malkapur as well as in the countryside. I may have preached in 30 or 35&#xA;villages. I preach only what is in the Bible but I do not refer to any&#xA;other religion, their Gods and Goddesses.  In the course of my preaching&#xA;I never hold out any inducement of material gain.  This is entirely&#xA;repugnant to my religion.  In the Exodus, 17th chapter, 20 verse, it is&#xA;not said that one should not offer any inducement or bribes to people to&#xA;bring them to God.  The Missionaries do not take any part in politics.&#xA;If they were to tell me anything of a subversive type, I will atonce&#xA;report to the Police. I am definitely of opinion that those who are&#xA;against our Government or our country, should not be allowed to stay in&#xA;India.  To the best of my knowledge and belief there is no Missionary&#xA;who preaches against the Government.  There may be about 40 individuals&#xA;young and old in Malkapur who are Christians. I have so far had no&#xA;harassment from the public or from police or from the other Government&#xA;officer’s.  For about 17 or 18 years I was at Akola and I am here for&#xA;the last 1¼ years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

They come there for preaching&#xA;Christian religion.  There are no Christian residents in the village.&#xA;There is no Church at Assalgaon.  There were four or five men and four&#xA;or five women.  They were all Indians.  The people were attracted by&#xA;curiosity and collected round them.  They addressed them as follows&#xA;“They said you worship idols as Gods.  That Jesus was a personality&#xA;whose very name relieves the man from all troubles.  You should not&#xA;worship stone idols.  Your religion is old”. I was offended and on my&#xA;protest they said that they had a right to preach their own religion.&#xA;Then at my request the assembled people dispersed and the preachers also&#xA;left the village.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I am connected with the&#xA;Institution from 1926 as Professor of Philosophy.  The Hislop College&#xA;was formerly founded by the Church of Scotland and is at present managed&#xA;by a Board of Directors with headquarters constituted in Madhya&#xA;Pradesh.  It provides graduate and post-graduate education in Arts and&#xA;Science subjects and is not directly connected with Church.  Amongst&#xA;Directors there are three members who are representing Mid India&#xA;Christian Council.  At present there are about 1,100 students on the&#xA;roll including women students.  There are about 100 Christian students&#xA;now and the rest are non-Christians.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oral Statement made before the Missionary Activities Enquiry&#xA;Commission&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CAMP AMBIKAPUR&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(19-11-1955)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No. 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Name&lt;/em&gt;-Ramchandra Purohit.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Father’s name&lt;/em&gt;-Pandit Ramjilal.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Address&lt;/em&gt;-Arya Hindu Dharma Seva Sangh, Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I work on behalf of the Arya Hindu Dharma Seva Sangh.  For the last two&#xA;years I work in the- Ambikapur-Jashpur area and pay visits for this&#xA;purpose.  Some persons of Bilaspur and Ambikapur had sent letters to our&#xA;head office at Delhi complaining that Christian Missionaries were&#xA;converting the local aboriginals by fraud, temptation and other means&#xA;and I was deputed by the head office to make enquiries on the spot and&#xA;to report what the facts were. I first came to Ambikapur and was&#xA;informed that about 400 workers were engaged in conversion activities in&#xA;Ambikapur-Surguja district and about 600 in Jashpur area.  I visited&#xA;some of the important places in the Surguja-Jashpur area and contacted&#xA;people. I was informed that three Missions were functioning in this&#xA;area-a Protestant Mission, a Lutheran Mission and the name of third I&#xA;have forgotten. I had contacted one pracharak at Sitapur and enquired&#xA;from him about the allegation which was made to me that monetary and&#xA;other temptations are given and people converted.  He replied saying&#xA;that he did not know anything about money or loans being given and that&#xA;his only work was to do preaching and make them good men. I met one&#xA;Jagdeo Uraon of Sitapur in the village and on asking him why he had&#xA;become a Christian he said that he had gone to a Missionary Doctor to&#xA;receive treatment and was told by the Doctor that if he got his choti&#xA;cut and converted to Christianity he would be cured.  He was converted&#xA;but was not cured of his illness and he told me that he wanted to be&#xA;reconverted. I asked him to come the next day when I would perform the&#xA;Shuddhi ceremony.  But he did not come and I was subsequently informed&#xA;that he had been given too much liquor on behalf of the Missionaries and&#xA;subsequently also was given Rs. 32 so that he might not be reconverted.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
