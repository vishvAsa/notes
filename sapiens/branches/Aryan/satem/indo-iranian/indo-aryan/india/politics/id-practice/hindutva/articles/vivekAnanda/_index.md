## Interesting bits
- Man of action, not ["tawk"](volume_5/epistles_first_series/264_029_gg/)
- Mocking pseudo-orthodoxy - focusing on observances while ignoring than substance - [here](volume_3/lectures_from_colombo_to_almora/131_reply_to_the_address_of_welcome_at_shivaganga_and_manamadura/). Of course, this is but a caricature of the orthodox - they did produce Chapekar types.
- Build phyisical strength. [here](volume_3/lectures_from_colombo_to_almora/136_vedanta_in_its_applications_to_indian_life/)
