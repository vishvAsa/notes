      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;note&#34;&gt;NOTE&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before leaving for the U.S.A. Swamiji used to change his name very&#xA;often. In earlier years, he signed as Narendra or Naren; then for some&#xA;time as Vividishananda or Sachchidananda. But for the convenience of the&#xA;readers, these volumes use the more familiar name of Vivekananda.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;PUBLISHER&lt;/p&gt;</description>

A word for you. Remember always, I may not see you again. Be&#xA;moral. Be brave. Be a heart-whole man. Strictly moral, brave unto&#xA;desperation. Don&amp;rsquo;t bother your head with religious theories. Cowards&#xA;only sin, brave men never, no, not even in mind. Try to love anybody and&#xA;everybody. Be a &lt;em&gt;man&lt;/em&gt; and try to make those immediately under your care,&#xA;namely Ram, Krishnamayi, and Indu, brave, moral, and sympathising. No&#xA;religion for you, my children, but morality and bravery. No cowardice,&#xA;no sin, no crime, no weakness — the rest will come of itself. . . . And&#xA;don&amp;rsquo;t take Ram with you ever or ever allow him to visit a theatre or any&#xA;enervating entertainment whatever.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I do not know why I should be&#xA;undeservingly praised. &amp;ldquo;None is good, save One, that is, God&amp;rdquo;, as the&#xA;Lord Jesus hath said. The rest are only tools in His hands. &amp;ldquo;Gloria in&#xA;Excelsis&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Glory unto God in the highest&amp;rdquo;, and unto men that deserve,&#xA;but not to such an undeserving one like me. Here &amp;ldquo;the servant is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;worthy of the hire&amp;rdquo;; and a Fakir, especially, has no right to any praise&#xA;whatsoever, for would you praise your servant for simply doing his duty?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

G., BANKING CORPORATION, AND ALL MY MADRAS&#xA;FRIENDS,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Excuse my not keeping you constantly informed of my movements. One is so&#xA;busy every day, and especially myself who am quite new to the life of&#xA;possessing things and taking care of them. That consumes so much of my&#xA;energy. It is really an awful botheration.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From Bombay we reached Colombo. Our steamer remained in port for nearly&#xA;the whole day, and we took the opportunity of getting off to have a look&#xA;at the town. We drove through the streets, and the only thing I remember&#xA;was a temple in which was a very gigantic Murti (image) of the Lord&#xA;Buddha in a reclining posture, entering Nirvāna&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Perhaps you have by this time got my&#xA;letter from Japan. From Japan I reached Vancouver. The way was by the&#xA;Northern Pacific. It was very cold and I suffered much for want of warm&#xA;clothing. However, I reached Vancouver anyhow, and thence went through&#xA;Canada to Chicago. I remained about twelve days in Chicago. And almost&#xA;every day I used to go to the Fair. It is a tremendous affair. One must&#xA;take at least ten days to go through it. The lady to whom Varada Rao&#xA;introduced me and her husband belong to the highest Chicago society, and&#xA;they were so very kind to me. I took my departure from Chicago and came&#xA;to Boston. Mr. Lālubhāi was with me up to Boston. He was very kind to&#xA;me. . . .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Since then the Lord sent&#xA;me friends. At a village near Boston I made the acquaintance of Dr.&#xA;Wright, Professor of Greek in the Harvard University. He sympathised&#xA;with me very much and urged upon me the necessity of going to the&#xA;Parliament of Religions, which he thought would give me an introduction&#xA;to the nation. As I was not acquainted with anybody, the Professor&#xA;undertook to arrange everything for me, and eventually I came back to&#xA;Chicago. Here I, together with the oriental and occidental delegates to&#xA;the Parliament of Religions, were all lodged in the house of a&#xA;gentleman.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Many&#xA;things strike me here. It may be fairly said that there is no poverty in&#xA;this country. I have never seen women elsewhere as cultured and educated&#xA;as they are here. Well-educated men there are in our country, but you&#xA;will scarcely find anywhere women like those here. It is indeed true,&#xA;that &amp;ldquo;the Goddess Herself lives in the houses of virtuous men as&#xA;Lakshmi&amp;rdquo;.  I have seen thousands of women here whose hearts are as pure&#xA;and stainless as snow. Oh, how free they are! It is they who control&#xA;social and civic duties Schools and colleges are full of women, and in&#xA;our country women cannot be safely allowed to walk in the streets! Their&#xA;kindness to me is immeasurable. Since I came here, I have been welcomed&#xA;by them to their houses. They are providing me with food, arranging for&#xA;my lectures, taking me to market, and doing everything for my comfort&#xA;and convenience. I shall never be able to repay in the least the deep&#xA;debt of gratitude I owe to them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;vii&#34;&gt;VII&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;C/O GEORGE W. HALE ESQ.,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;541 DEARBORN AVENUE, CHICAGO,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;24th January, 1894&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DEAR FRIENDS, (His disciples in Madras)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your letters have reached me. I am surprised that so much about me has&#xA;reached you. The criticism you mention of the &lt;em&gt;Interior&lt;/em&gt; is not to be&#xA;taken as the attitude of the American people. That paper is almost&#xA;unknown here, and belongs to what they call a &amp;ldquo;blue-nose Presbyterian&#xA;paper&amp;rdquo;, very bigoted. Still all the &amp;ldquo;blue-noses&amp;rdquo; are not ungentlemanly.&#xA;The American people, and many of the clergy, are very hospitable to me.&#xA;That paper wanted a little notoriety by attacking a man who was being&#xA;lionised by society. That trick is well known here, and they do not&#xA;think anything of it. Of course, our Indian missionaries may try to make&#xA;capital out of it. If they do, tell them, &amp;ldquo;Mark, Jew, a judgment has&#xA;come upon you!&amp;rdquo; Their old building is tottering to its foundation and&#xA;must come down in spite of their hysterical shrieks. I pity them — if&#xA;their means of living fine lives in India is cut down by the influx of&#xA;oriental religions here. But not one of their leading clergy is ever&#xA;against me. Well, when I am in the pond, I must bathe thoroughly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

You see I am so very busy here,&#xA;and have to write so many letters every day, that you cannot expect&#xA;frequent communications from me. But I try my best to keep you in touch&#xA;with whatever is going on here. I will write to Chicago for one of the&#xA;books on the Parliament of Religions to be sent over to you. But by this&#xA;time you have got two of my short speeches.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

A.,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;20th May, 1894&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;MY DEAR SHARAT (SARADANANDA),&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am in receipt of your letter and am glad to learn that Shashi&#xA;(Ramakrishnananda) is all right. Now I tell you a curious fact. Whenever&#xA;anyone of you is sick, let him himself or anyone of you visualise him in&#xA;your mind, and mentally say and strongly imagine that he is all right.&#xA;That will cure him quickly. You can do it even without his knowledge,&#xA;and even with thousands of miles between you. Remember it and do not be&#xA;ill any more. You have received the money by this time. If you all like,&#xA;you can give to Gopal Rs. 300/- from the amount I sent for the Math. I&#xA;have no more to send now. I have to look after Madras now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I do&#xA;not know when I am going back to India. It is better to leave everything&#xA;in the hands of Him who is at my back directing me. Try to work without&#xA;me, as if I never existed. Do not wait for anybody or anything. Do&#xA;whatever you can. Build your hope on none. Before writing about myself,&#xA;I will tell you about Narasimha. He has proved a complete failure. . . .&#xA;However he wrote to me for help in the last stage, and I will try to&#xA;help him as much as is in my power. Meanwhile you tell his people to&#xA;send money as soon as they can for him to go over. . . . He is in&#xA;distress. Of course I will see that he does not starve.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Some of the resolutions are to be&#xA;sent to Dr. Barrows with a letter thanking him for his kindness to me&#xA;and asking him to publish the letter in some American newspapers — as&#xA;that would be the best refutation of the false charges of the&#xA;missionaries that I do not represent anybody. Learn business, my boy. We&#xA;will do great things yet! Last year I only sowed the seeds; this year I&#xA;mean to reap. In the meanwhile, keep up as much enthusiasm as possible&#xA;in India. Let Kidi go his own way. He will come out all right in time. I&#xA;have taken his responsibility. He has a perfect right to his own&#xA;opinion. Make him write for the paper; that will keep him in good&#xA;temper! My blessings on him.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I am with the&#xA;Bagleys once more. They are kind as usual. Professor Wright was not&#xA;here. But he came day before yesterday and we have very nice time&#xA;together. Mr. Bradley of Evanston, whom you have met at Evanston, was&#xA;here. His sister-in-law had me sit for a picture several days and had&#xA;painted me. I had some very fine boating and one evening overturned the&#xA;boat and had a good drenching — clothes and all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

A.,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;31st August, 1894&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DEAR ALASINGA,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I just now saw an editorial on me about the circular from Madras in the&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Boston Transcript&lt;/em&gt;. Nothing has reached me yet. They will reach me soon&#xA;if you have sent them already. So far you have done wonderfully, my boy.&#xA;Do not mind what I write in some moments of nervousness. One gets&#xA;nervous sometimes alone in a country 15,000 miles from home, having to&#xA;fight every inch of ground with orthodox inimical Christians. You must&#xA;take those into consideration, my brave boy, and work right along.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I have been continuously travelling from place to place and&#xA;working incessantly, giving lectures, holding classes, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have not been able to write yet for my proposed book. Perhaps I may be&#xA;able to take it in hand later on. I have made some nice friends here&#xA;amongst the liberal people, and a few amongst the orthodox. I hope to&#xA;return soon to India — I have had enough of this country and especially&#xA;as too much work is making me nervous. The giving of too many public&#xA;lectures and constant hurry have brought on this nervousness. I do not&#xA;care for this busy, meaningless, money-making life. So you see, I will&#xA;soon return. Of course, there is a growing section with whom I am very&#xA;popular, and who will like to have me here all the time. But I think I&#xA;have had enough of newspaper blazoning and humbugging of a public life.&#xA;I do not care the least for it. . . .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The fruit falls from the tree when it gets ripe. So wait for the&#xA;time to come. Do not hurry. Moreover, no one has the right to make&#xA;others miserable by his foolish acts.

One thing I find in the books of my speeches and sayings published&#xA;in Calcutta. Some of them are printed in such a way as to savour of&#xA;political views; whereas I am no politician or political agitator. I&#xA;care only for the Spirit — when that is right everything will be righted&#xA;by itself&amp;hellip;. So you must warn the Calcutta people that no political&#xA;significance be ever attached falsely to any of my writings or sayings.&#xA;What nonsense I . . . I heard that Rev. Kali Charan Banerji in a lecture&#xA;to Christian missionaries said that I was a political delegate. If it&#xA;was said publicly, then publicly ask the Babu for me to write to any of&#xA;the Calcutta papers and prove it, or else take back his foolish&#xA;assertion. This is their trick! I have said a few harsh words in honest&#xA;criticism of Christian governments in general, but that does not mean&#xA;that I care for, or have any connection with politics or that sort of&#xA;thing. Those who think it very grand to print extracts from those&#xA;lectures and want to prove that I am a political preacher, to them I&#xA;say, &amp;ldquo;Save me from my friends.&amp;rdquo; . . .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

After such a start, if you despair&#xA;you are a fool. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our field is India, and the value of foreign appreciation is in rousing&#xA;India up. That is all. . . .

By this time I have become one&#xA;of their own teachers. They all like me and my teachings&amp;hellip;. I travel&#xA;all over the country from one place to another, as was my habit in&#xA;India, preaching and teaching. Thousands and thousands have listened to&#xA;me and taken my ideas in a very kindly spirit. It is the most expensive&#xA;country, but the Lord provides for me everywhere I go.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I am sure you are all enjoying this nice cool weather. I am&#xA;enjoying Baltimore and Washington very much. I will go hence to&#xA;Philadelphia. I thought Miss Mary was in Philadelphia, and so I wanted&#xA;her address. But as she is in some other place near Philadelphia, I do&#xA;not want to give her the trouble to come up to see me, as Mother Church&#xA;says.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

You must excuse me&#xA;for certain harshness of tone sometimes, and you know full well how I&#xA;love you. You have asked me often to send over to you all about my&#xA;movements in this country and all my lecture reports. I am doing exactly&#xA;here what I used to do in India. Always depending on the Lord and making&#xA;no plans ahead&amp;hellip;. Moreover you must remember that I have to work&#xA;incessantly in this country, and that I have no time to put together my&#xA;thoughts in the form of a book, so much so, that this constant rush has&#xA;worn my nerves, and I am feeling it. I cannot express my obligation to&#xA;you, G. G., and all my friends in Madras, for the most unselfish and&#xA;heroic work you did for me. But it was not at all meant to blazon me,&#xA;but to make you conscious of your own strength. I am not an organiser,&#xA;my nature tends towards scholarship and meditation. I think I have&#xA;worked enough, now I want rest and to teach a little to those that have&#xA;come to me from my Gurudeva (venerable Guru). You have known now what&#xA;you can do, for it is really you, young men of Madras, that have done&#xA;all; I am only the figurehead. I am a Tyāgi (detached) monk. I only want&#xA;one thing. I do not believe in a God or religion which cannot wipe the&#xA;widow&amp;rsquo;s tears or bring a piece of bread to the orphan&amp;rsquo;s mouth. However&#xA;sublime be the theories, however well-spun may be the philosophy — I do&#xA;not call it religion so long as it is confined to books and dogmas. The&#xA;eye is in the forehead and not in the back. Move onward and carry into&#xA;practice that which you are very proud to call your religion, and God&#xA;bless you!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

You need not send any more newspaper cuttings. I have been&#xA;deluged with them. Enough of that. Now go to work for the organisation.&#xA;I have started one already in New York and the Vice-President will soon&#xA;write to you. Keep correspondence with them. Soon I hope to get up a few&#xA;in other places. We must organise our forces not to make a sect — not on&#xA;religious matters, but on the secular business part of it. A stirring&#xA;propaganda must be launched out. Put your heads together and organise.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

As to the wonderful stories published about Shri Ramakrishna, I&#xA;advise you to keep clear of them and the fools who write them. They are&#xA;true, but the fools will make a mess of the whole thing, I am sure. He&#xA;had a whole world of knowledge to teach, why insist upon unnecessary&#xA;things as miracles really are! They do not prove anything. Matter does&#xA;not prove Spirit. What connection is there between the existence of God,&#xA;Soul, or immortality, and the working of miracles? . . . Preach Shri&#xA;Ramakrishna. Pass the Cup that has satisfied your thirst. . . . Preach&#xA;Bhakti. Do not disturb your head with metaphysical nonsense, and do not&#xA;disturb others by your bigotry. . . .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In reference to me every now and then attacks are made in&#xA;missionary papers (so I hear), but I never care to see them. If you send&#xA;any of those made in India, I should throw them into the waste-paper&#xA;basket. A little agitation was necessary for our work. We have had&#xA;enough. Pay no more attention to what people say about me, whether good&#xA;or bad. You go on with your work and remember that &amp;ldquo;Never one meets with&#xA;evil who tries to do good&amp;rdquo; (Gita, VI. 40).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I was mistaken in asking you to publish&#xA;the scraps I sent you. It was one of my awful mistakes. It shows a&#xA;moment&amp;rsquo;s weakness. Money can be raised in this country by lecturing for&#xA;two or three years.

A certain retired missionary here wrote me a letter&#xA;addressing me as brother and then hastily went to publish my short&#xA;answer and make a show. But you know what people here think of such&#xA;gentlemen. Moreover, the same missionary went privately to some of my&#xA;friends to ask them not to befriend me. Of course he met with universal&#xA;contempt. I am quite astonished at this man&amp;rsquo;s behaviour — a preacher of&#xA;religion to take to such underhand dealings! Unfortunately too much of&#xA;that in every country and in every religion. Last winter I travelled a&#xA;good deal in this country although the weather was very severe. I&#xA;thought it would be dreadful, but I did not find it so after all. You&#xA;remember Col. Neggenson, President of the Free Religious Society. He&#xA;makes very kind inquiries about you. I met Dr. Carpenter of Oxford&#xA;(England) the other day. He delivered an address on the ethics of&#xA;Buddhism at Plymouth. It was very sympathetic and scholarly. He made&#xA;inquiries about you and your paper. Hope, your noble work will succeed.&#xA;You are a worthy servant of Him who came Bahujana Hitāya Bahujana&#xA;Sukhāya (for the good of the many, for the happiness of the many).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

A.,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;1894&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DEAR ALASINGA,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Listen to an old story. A lazy tramp sauntering along the road saw an&#xA;old man sitting at the door of his house and stopped to inquire of him&#xA;the whereabouts of a certain place. &amp;ldquo;How far is such and such a&#xA;village?&amp;rdquo; he asked. The old man remained silent. The man repeated his&#xA;query several times. Still there was no answer. Disgusted at this, the&#xA;traveller turned to go away. The old man then stood up and said, &amp;ldquo;The&#xA;village of — is only a mile from here.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;What!&amp;rdquo; said the tramp, &amp;ldquo;Why did&#xA;you not speak when I asked you before?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Because then&amp;rdquo;, said the old&#xA;man, &amp;ldquo;you seemed so halting and careless about proceeding, but now you&#xA;are starting off in good earnest, and you have a right to an answer.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;xxviii&#34;&gt;XXVIII&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;541 DEARBORN AVENUE,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;CHICAGO,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;3rd January, 1895&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DEAR MRS. BULL,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I lectured at Brooklyn last Sunday, Mrs. Higgins gave a little reception&#xA;the evening I arrived, and some of the prominent members of the Ethical&#xA;Society including Dr. Jain [Janes] were there. Some of them thought&#xA;that such Oriental religious subjects will not interest the Brooklyn&#xA;public.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But the lecture, through the blessings of the Lord, proved a tremendous&#xA;success. About 800 of the &lt;em&gt;élite&lt;/em&gt; of Brooklyn were present, and the very&#xA;gentlemen who thought it would not prove a success are trying for&#xA;organising a series in Brooklyn. The New York course for me is nearly&#xA;ready, but I do not wish to fix the dates until Miss Thursby comes to&#xA;New York. As such Miss Phillips who is a friend of Miss Thursby&amp;rsquo;s and&#xA;who is arranging the New York course for me will act with Miss Thursby&#xA;in case she wants to get up something in New York.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Narasimhachariar)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your letter just to hand. . . . The Parliament of Religions was&#xA;organised with the intention of proving the superiority of the Christian&#xA;religion over other forms of faith, but the philosophic religion of&#xA;Hinduism was able to maintain its position notwithstanding.+++(5)+++ Dr. Barrows&#xA;and the men of that ilk are very orthodox, and I do not look to them for&#xA;help. . . . The Lord has sent me many friends in this country, and they&#xA;are always on the increase. The Lord bless those who have tried to&#xA;injure me. . . . I have been running all the time between Boston and New&#xA;York, two great centres of this country, of which Boston may be called&#xA;the brain and New York, the purse. In both, my success is more than&#xA;ordinary. I am indifferent to the newspaper reports, and you must not&#xA;expect me to send any of them to you. A little boom was necessary to&#xA;begin work. We have had more than enough of that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I have no time to peruse&#xA;them and take notice of them. Please send them &lt;em&gt;no more&lt;/em&gt;. I do not care&#xA;a fig for what the missionaries or the Theosophists say about me. Let&#xA;them do as they please. The very taking notice of them will be to give&#xA;them importance. Besides, you know, the missionaries only abuse and&#xA;never argue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I had a premonition of your father&amp;rsquo;s giving up the old body and it&#xA;is not my custom to write to anyone when a wave of would-be inharmonious&#xA;Māyā strikes him. But these are the great turning points in life, and I&#xA;know that you are unmoved. The surface of the sea rises and sinks&#xA;alternately, but to the observant soul — the child of light — each&#xA;sinking reveals more and more of the depth and of the beds of pearls and&#xA;coral at the bottom. Coming and going is all pure delusion. The soul&#xA;never comes nor goes. Where is the place to which it shall go when all&#xA;space is &lt;em&gt;in the soul&lt;/em&gt;? When shall be the time for entering and&#xA;departing when all time is &lt;em&gt;in the soul&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Well, sometimes it is a good&#xA;discipline to be forced to work for work&amp;rsquo;s sake, even to the length of&#xA;not being allowed to enjoy the fruits of one&amp;rsquo;s labour&amp;hellip;. I am very glad&#xA;of your criticisms and am not sorry at all. The other day at Miss&#xA;Thursby&amp;rsquo;s I had an excited argument with a Presbyterian gentleman, who,&#xA;as usual, got very hot, angry, and abusive. However, I was afterwards&#xA;severely reprimanded by Mrs. Bull for this, as such things hinder my&#xA;work. So, it seems, is your opinion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Meddle not with so-called social reform, for there cannot be any&#xA;reform without spiritual reform first. Who told you that I want social&#xA;reform? Not I. Preach the Lord — say neither good nor bad about the&#xA;superstitions and diets. Do not lose heart, do not lose faith in your&#xA;Guru, do not lose faith in God. So long as you possess these three,&#xA;nothing can harm you, my child. I am growing stronger every day. Work&#xA;on, my brave boys.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Do not for a moment think the &amp;ldquo;Yankees&amp;rdquo; are practical in religion.&#xA;In that the Hindu alone is practical, the Yankee in money-making, so&#xA;that as soon as I depart, the whole thing will disappear. Therefore I&#xA;want to have a solid ground under my feet before I depart. Every work&#xA;should be made thorough. . . . You need not insist upon preaching Shri&#xA;Ramakrishna. Propagate his ideas first, though I know the world always&#xA;wants the Man first, then the idea. . . . Do not figure out big plans at&#xA;first, but begin slowly, feel your ground, and proceed up and up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I have sympathy&#xA;with your desire. There is nothing so high as renunciation of self. But&#xA;you must not forget that to forgo your own favourite desire for the&#xA;welfare of those that depend upon you is no small sacrifice. Follow the&#xA;spotless life and teachings of Shri Ramakrishna and look after the&#xA;comforts of your family. You do your own duty, and leave the rest to&#xA;Him.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;xxxix&#34;&gt;XXXIX&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;U. S. A.,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;6th May, 1895&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DEAR ALASINGA,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This morning I received your last letter and that first volume of the&#xA;Bhāshya of Rāmānujācharya. A few days ago I received another letter from&#xA;you. Also I received a letter from Mr. Mani Iyer. I am doing well and&#xA;going on in the same old rate. You mention about the lectures of Mr.&#xA;Lund. I do not know who he is or where he is. He may be some one&#xA;lecturing in Churches; for had he big platforms, we would have heard of&#xA;him. Maybe, he gets them reported in some newspapers and sends them to&#xA;India; and the missionaries may be making trade out of it. Well, so far&#xA;I guess from the tone of your letters. It is no public affair here to&#xA;call forth any defence from us; for in that case I will have to fight&#xA;hundreds of them here every day. For India is now in the air, and the&#xA;orthodox, including Dr. Barrows and all the rest, are struggling hard to&#xA;put out the fire. In the second place, every one of these orthodox&#xA;lectures against India must have a good deal of abuse hurled against me.&#xA;If you hear some of the filthy stories the orthodox men and women invent&#xA;against me, you will be astonished. Now, do you mean to say that a&#xA;Sannyāsin should go about defending himself against the brutal and&#xA;cowardly attacks of these self-seeking men and women? I have some very&#xA;influential friends here who, now and then, give them their quietus.&#xA;Again, why should I waste my energies defending Hinduism if the Hindus&#xA;all go to sleep? What are you three hundred millions of people doing&#xA;there, especially those that are so proud of their learning etc.? Why do&#xA;you not take up the fighting and leave me to teach and preach? Here am I&#xA;struggling day and night in the midst of strangers&amp;hellip;. What help does&#xA;India send? Did the world ever see a nation with less patriotism than&#xA;the Indian? If you could send and maintain for a few years a dozen&#xA;well-educated strong men to preach in Europe and America, you would do&#xA;immense service to India, both morally and politically. Every man who&#xA;morally sympathises with India becomes a political friend. Many of the&#xA;Western people think of you as a nation of half-naked savages, and&#xA;therefore only fit to be whipped into civilization. If you three hundred&#xA;millions become cowed by the missionaries — you cowards — and dare not&#xA;say a word, what can one man do in a far distant land? Even what I have&#xA;done, you do not deserve.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;xli&#34;&gt;XLI&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;C/O MISS DUTCHER,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;THOUSAND ISLAND PARK, N.Y.,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;18th June, 1895&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DEAR FRIEND, (Mr. F. Leggett)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A letter reached me from Mrs. Sturges the day before she left, including&#xA;a cheque for $50. It was impossible to make the acknowledgement reach&#xA;her the next day; so I take this opportunity to ask you the favour of&#xA;sending her my thanks and acknowledgement in your next to her.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We are having a nice time here except, as an old Hindu proverb says,&#xA;that &amp;ldquo;a pestle must pound even if it goes to heaven&amp;rdquo;. I have to work&#xA;hard all the same. I am going to Chicago in the beginning of August.&#xA;When are you starting?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I am glad you are&#xA;progressing. You are mistaken in thinking that I am not going to return&#xA;to India; I am coming soon. I am not giving to failures, and here I have&#xA;planted a seed, and it is going to become a tree, and it must. Only I am&#xA;afraid it will hurt its growth if I give it up too soon. . . .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;xliii&#34;&gt;XLIII&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;U. S. A.,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;1st July, 1895&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DEAR ALASINGA,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I received your missionary book and the Ramnad photos. I have written to&#xA;the Raja as well as the Dewan at Mysore. The missionary pamphlet must&#xA;have reached here long ago, as the Ramabai circle controversy with Dr.&#xA;Janes savoured of it, it seems. Now you need not be afraid of anything.&#xA;There is one misstatement in that pamphlet. I never went to a big hotel&#xA;in this country, and very few times to any other. At Baltimore, the&#xA;small hotels, being ignorant, would not take in a black man, thinking&#xA;him a negro. So my host, Dr. Vrooman, had to take me to a larger one,&#xA;because they knew the difference between a negro and a foreigner. Let me&#xA;tell you, Alasinga, that you have to defend yourselves. Why do you&#xA;behave like babies? If anybody attacks your religion, why cannot, you&#xA;defend it? As for me, you need not be afraid, I have more friends than&#xA;enemies here, and in this country one-third are Christians, and only a&#xA;small number of the educated care about the missionaries. Again, the&#xA;very fact of the missionaries being against anything makes the educated&#xA;like it. They are less of a power here now, and are becoming less so&#xA;every day. If their attacks pain you, why do you behave like a petulant&#xA;child and refer to me? . . . Cowardice is no virtue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Many thanks for the $50&#xA;you sent; it went a long way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We have had such a nice time here. Two ladies came up all the way from&#xA;Detroit to be with us here. They are so pure and good. I am going from&#xA;the Thousand Island to Detroit and thence to Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Marie Louise arrived yesterday. So we&#xA;are exactly seven now including all that have come yet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All the sleep of the world has come upon me. I sleep at least two hours&#xA;during the day and sleep through the whole night as a piece of log. This&#xA;is a reaction, I think, from the sleeplessness of New York. I am also&#xA;writing and reading a little, and have a class every morning after&#xA;breakfast. The meals are being conducted on the strictest vegetarian&#xA;principles, and I am fasting a good deal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Also&#xA;they sent over two pretty birch bark books. I have filled them with&#xA;Sanskrit texts and translations, and they go by today&amp;rsquo;s post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

About my coming to India, the matter stands thus I am, as your&#xA;Highness (The Maharaja of Khetri) well knows, a man of dogged&#xA;perseverance. I have planted a seed in this country; it is already a&#xA;plant, and I expect it to be a tree very soon. I have got a few hundred&#xA;followers. I shall make several Sannyāsins, and then I go to India&#xA;leaving the work to them. The more the Christian priests oppose me, the&#xA;more I am determined to leave a permanent mark on their country. . . . I&#xA;have already some friends in London. I am going there by the end of&#xA;August. . . . This winter anyway has to be spent partly in London and&#xA;partly in New York, and then I shall be free to go to India. There will&#xA;be enough men to carry on the work here after this winter if the Lord is&#xA;kind. Each work has to pass through these stages — ridicule, opposition,&#xA;and then acceptance. Each man who thinks ahead of his time is sure to be&#xA;misunderstood. So opposition and persecution are welcome, only I have to&#xA;be steady and pure and must have immense faith in God, and all these&#xA;will vanish. . . .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I shall have to come to New York&#xA;before the 11th anyway. So there will be time enough to get ready.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I shall go with you to Paris, for my principal object in going with you&#xA;is to see &lt;em&gt;you married&lt;/em&gt;.

A.,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;August 1895&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By the time this reaches you, dear Alasinga, I shall be in Paris. . . .&#xA;I have done a good deal of work this year and hope to do a good deal&#xA;more in the next. Don&amp;rsquo;t bother about the missionaries. It is quite&#xA;natural that they should cry. Who does not when his bread is dwindling&#xA;away? The missionary funds have got a big gap the last two years, and it&#xA;is on the increase. However, I wish the missionaries all success. So&#xA;long as you have love for God and Guru and faith in truth, nothing can&#xA;hurt you, my son. But the loss of any of these is dangerous. You have&#xA;remarked well; my ideas are going to work in the West better than in&#xA;India. . . . I have done more for India than India ever did for me. . .&#xA;. I believe in truth, the Lord sends me workers by the scores wherever I&#xA;go — and they are not like the . . . disciples either — they are ready&#xA;to give up their lives for their Guru. Truth is my God, the universe my&#xA;country I do not believe in duty. Duty is the curse of the Samsāri&#xA;(householder), not for the Sannyāsin. Duty is humbug. I am free, my&#xA;bonds are cut; what care I where this body goes or does not go. You have&#xA;helped me well right along. The Lord will reward you. I sought praise&#xA;neither from India nor from America, nor do I seek such bubbles. I have&#xA;a truth to teach, I, the child of God And He that gave me the truth will&#xA;send me fellow workers from the earth&amp;rsquo;s bravest and best. You Hindus&#xA;will see in a few years what the Lord does in the West. You are like the&#xA;Jews of old — dogs in the manger, who neither eat nor allow others to&#xA;eat. You have no religion your God is the kitchen, your Bible the&#xA;cooking-pots. . . . You are a few brave lads. . . . Hold on, boys, no&#xA;cowards among my children. . . . Are great things ever done smoothly?&#xA;Time, patience, and indomitable will must show. I could have told you&#xA;many things that would have made your heart leap, but I will not. I want&#xA;iron wills and hearts that do not know how to quake. Hold on. The Lord&#xA;bless you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I am surprised you take so seriously the missionaries&amp;rsquo; nonsense. .&#xA;. . If the people in India want me to keep strictly to my Hindu diet,&#xA;please tell them to send me a cook and money enough to keep him. This&#xA;silly &lt;em&gt;bossism&lt;/em&gt; without a mite of real help makes me laugh. On the other&#xA;hand, if the missionaries tell you that I have ever broken the two great&#xA;vows of the Sannyāsin — chastity and poverty — tell them that they are&#xA;&lt;em&gt;big liars&lt;/em&gt;. Please write to the missionary Hume asking him&#xA;categorically to write you what misdemeanour he saw in me, or give you&#xA;the names of his informants, and whether the information was &lt;em&gt;first-hand&#xA;or not&lt;/em&gt;; that will settle the question and expose the whole thing. . . .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I have already delivered my first address, and you may see how&#xA;well it has been received by the notice in the &lt;em&gt;Standard&lt;/em&gt;.

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;liv&#34;&gt;LIV&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;LONDON,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;18th November, 1895&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DEAR ALASINGA,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;. . . In England my work is really splendid, I am astonished myself at&#xA;it. The English people do not: talk much in the newspapers, but they&#xA;work silently. I am sure of more work in England than in America. Bands&#xA;and bands come, and I have no room for so many; so they squat on the&#xA;floor, ladies and all. I tell them to imagine that they are under the&#xA;sky of India, under a spreading banyan, and they like the idea. I shall&#xA;have to go away next week, and they are so sorry. Some think my work&#xA;here will be hurt a little if I go away so soon. I do not think so. I do&#xA;not depend on men or things. The Lord alone I depend upon — and He works&#xA;through me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Have patience and be faithful unto death. Do not fight among&#xA;yourselves. Be perfectly pure in money dealings. . . . We will do great&#xA;things yet. . . . So long as you have faith and honesty and devotion,&#xA;everything will prosper.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;. . . In translating the Suktas, pay particular attention to the&#xA;Bhāshyakāras (commentators), and pay no attention whatever to the&#xA;orientalists. They do not understand a single thing about our Shāstras&#xA;(scriptures). It is not given to dry philologists to understand&#xA;philosophy or religion. . . . For instance the word Ânid-avātam in the&#xA;Rig-Veda was translated — &amp;ldquo;He lived without breathing&amp;rdquo;. Now, here the&#xA;reference is really to the chief Prāna, and Avātam has the root-meaning&#xA;for unmoved, that is, without vibration. It describes the state in which&#xA;the universal cosmic energy, or Prana, remains before the Kalpa (cycle&#xA;of creation) begins: vide — the Bhashyakaras. Explain according to &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;sages and not according to the so-called European scholars. What do they&#xA;know?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I&#xA;wrote immediately after the receipt of yours and also sent you some&#xA;booklets of three lectures I delivered in New York. These Sunday public&#xA;lectures are now taken down in shorthand and printed. Three of them made&#xA;two little pamphlets, several copies of which I have forwarded to you. I&#xA;shall be in New York two weeks more, and then I go to Detroit to come&#xA;back to Boston felt a week or two.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Later on, when I come, I&#xA;may send him over to America. Today another Sannyasin has been added to&#xA;the list. This time it is a man who is a genuine American and a&#xA;religious teacher of some standing in the country. He was Dr. Street. He&#xA;is now Yogananda, as his leaning is all towards Yoga.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I have used some very harsh words in my letters, which you ought&#xA;to excuse, as you know, I get nervous at times.

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;lxi&#34;&gt;LXI&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;14th April, 1896&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DEAR DR. NANJUNDA RAO,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I received your note this morning. As I am sailing for England tomorrow,&#xA;I can only write a few hearty lines. I have every sympathy with your&#xA;proposed magazine for boys, and will do my best to help it on. You ought&#xA;to make it independent, following the same lines as the &lt;em&gt;Brahmavādin&lt;/em&gt;,&#xA;only making the style and matter much more popular. As for example,&#xA;there is a great chance, much more than you ever dream of, for those&#xA;wonderful stories scattered all over the Sanskrit literature, to be&#xA;re-written and made popular. That should be the one great feature of&#xA;your journal. I will write stories, as many as I can, when time permits.&#xA;Avoid all attempts to make the journal scholarly — the &lt;em&gt;Brahmavadin&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;stands for that — and it will slowly make its way all over the world, I&#xA;am sure. Use the simplest language possible, and you will succeed. The&#xA;main feature should be the teaching of principles through stories. Don&amp;rsquo;t&#xA;make it metaphysical at all. As to the business part, keep it wholly in&#xA;your hands. &amp;ldquo;Too many cooks spoil the broth.&amp;rdquo; In India the one thing we&#xA;lack is the power of combination, organisation, the first secret of&#xA;which is obedience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;lxii&#34;&gt;LXII&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;ENGLAND,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;14th July, 1896&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DEAR DR. NANJUNDA RAO,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The numbers of &lt;em&gt;Prabuddha Bharata&lt;/em&gt; have been received and distributed&#xA;too to the class. It is very satisfactory. It will have a great sale, no&#xA;doubt, in India. In America I may get also a number of subscribers. I&#xA;have already arranged for advertising it in America and Goodyear has&#xA;done it already. But here in England the progress will be slower indeed.&#xA;The great drawback here is — they all want to start papers of their own;&#xA;and it is right that it should be so, seeing that, after all, no&#xA;foreigner will ever write the English language as well as the native&#xA;Englishman, end the ideas, when put in good English, will spread farther&#xA;than in Hindu English. Then again it is much more difficult to write a&#xA;story in a foreign language than an essay. I am trying my best to get&#xA;you subscribers here. But you must not depend on any &lt;em&gt;foreign help&lt;/em&gt;.&#xA;Nations, like individuals, must help themselves. This is real&#xA;patriotism. If a nation cannot do that, its time has not yet come. It&#xA;must wait. It is from Madras that the new light &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; spread all over&#xA;India. With this end you must stork. One point I will remark however.&#xA;The cover is simply barbarous. It is awful and hideous. If it is&#xA;possible, change it. Make it symbolical and simple, without human&#xA;figures at all. The banyan tree does not mean awakening, nor does the&#xA;hill, nor the saint, nor the European couple. The lotus is a symbol of&#xA;regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I will try to help you when I go back to London. You must not lower&#xA;the tone. Keep up the paper. Very soon I will be able to help you in&#xA;such a manner as to make you free of this nonsense teacher business. Do&#xA;not be afraid. Great things are going to be done, my child. Take heart.&#xA;The &lt;em&gt;Brahmavadin&lt;/em&gt; is a jewel — it must not perish. Of course, such a&#xA;paper has to be kept up by private help always, and &lt;em&gt;we will do it&lt;/em&gt;.&#xA;Hold on a few months more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I will give&#xA;you Rs. 100 a month for a year or two, i.e. £60 or £70 a year, i.e. as&#xA;much as would cover Rs. 100 a month. That will set you free to work for&#xA;the &lt;em&gt;Brahmavadin&lt;/em&gt; and make it a better success. Mr. Mani Iyer and a few&#xA;friends can help in raising fund that would cover the printing etc. What&#xA;is the income from subscription? Can these be employed to pay the&#xA;contributors and get a fine series of articles? It is not necessary that&#xA;everybody should understand all that is written in the &lt;em&gt;Brahmavadin&lt;/em&gt;,&#xA;but that they must subscribe from patriotism and good Karma — the Hindus&#xA;I mean.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Sturdy)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today I received a letter from India written by Abhedānanda that in all&#xA;probability he had started on the 11th August by the B.I.S.N.,&#xA;&amp;ldquo;S.S.Mombassa&amp;rdquo;. He could not get an earlier steamer; else he would have&#xA;started earlier. In all probability he would be able to secure a passage&#xA;on the Mombassa. The Mombassa will reach London about the 15th of&#xA;September. As you already know, Miss Müller changed the date of my&#xA;visiting Deussen to the 19th September. I shall not be in London to&#xA;receive Abhedananda. He is also coming without any warm clothing; but I&#xA;am afraid by that time it will begin to cool in England, and he will&#xA;require at least some underwear and an overcoat. You know all about&#xA;these things much better than I. So kindly keep a look out for this&#xA;Mombassa. I expect also another letter from him.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I am on the move. I have been doing a&#xA;great deal of mountain-climbing and glacier-crossing in the Alps. Now I&#xA;am going to Germany. I have an invitation from Prof. Deussen to visit&#xA;him at Kiel. From thence I go back to England. Possibly I will return to&#xA;India this winter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I objected to in the design for the &lt;em&gt;Prabuddha Bhārata&lt;/em&gt; was not&#xA;only its tawdriness, but the crowding in of a number of figures without&#xA;any purpose. A design should be simple, symbolical, and condensed. I&#xA;will try to make a design for &lt;em&gt;Prabuddha&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Bharata&lt;/em&gt; in London and send&#xA;it over to you. . . .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Do not be sorry, he does not mention me there at all, as it was&#xA;written six months before he knew me. And then who cares whom he&#xA;mentions, if he is right in the main point. I had a beautiful time with&#xA;Prof. Deussen in Germany. Later, he and I came together to London, and&#xA;we have already become great friends.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;lxviii&#34;&gt;LXVIII&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;14 GREY COAT GARDENS,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;WESTMINSTER, LONDON.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;1896&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DEAR ALASINGA,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have returned about three weeks from Switzerland but could not write&#xA;you further before. I have sent you by last mail a paper on Paul Deussen&#xA;of Kiel. Sturdy&amp;rsquo;s plan about the magazine is still hanging fire. As you&#xA;see, I have left the St. George&amp;rsquo;s Road place. We have a lecture hall at&#xA;39 Victoria Street. C/o E. T. Sturdy will always reach me for a year to&#xA;come. The rooms at Grey Coat Gardens are only lodgings for self and the&#xA;other Swami taken for three mouths only. The work in London is growing&#xA;apace, the classes are becoming bigger as they go on. I have no doubt&#xA;this will go on increasing at this rate and the English people are&#xA;steady and loyal. Of course, as soon as I leave, most of this fabric&#xA;will tumble down. Something will happen. Some strong man will arise to&#xA;take it up. The Lord knows what is good. In America there is room for&#xA;twenty preachers on the Vedanta and Yoga. Where to get these preachers&#xA;and where also the money to bring them? Half the United States can be&#xA;conquered in ten years, given a number of strong and genuine men. Where&#xA;are they? We are all boobies over there! Selfish cowards, with our&#xA;nonsense of lip-patriotism, orthodoxy, and boasted religious feeling!&#xA;The Madrasis have more of go and steadiness, but every fool is married.&#xA;Marriage! Marriage! Marriage! . . . Then the way our boys are married&#xA;nowadays! . . . It is very good to aspire to be a nonattached&#xA;householder; but what we want in Madras is not that just now — but&#xA;non-marriage. . . .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I am not yet sure what month I shall reach India. I will write&#xA;later about it. The new Swami (Swami Abhedananda) delivered his maiden&#xA;speech yesterday at a friendly society&amp;rsquo;s meeting. It was good and I&#xA;liked it; he has the making of a good speaker in him, I am sure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He wrote among other things as&#xA;follows:)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Barrows was the ablest lieutenant Mr. C. Boney could have selected&#xA;to carry out successfully his great plan of the Congresses at the&#xA;World&amp;rsquo;s Fair, and it is now a matter of history how one of these&#xA;Congresses scored a unique distinction under the leadership of Dr.&#xA;Barrows.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I go from here to Italy, and after seeing a few places there,&#xA;join the steamer at Naples. Miss Müller, Mr. and Mrs. Sevier, and a&#xA;young man called Goodwin are accompanying me. The Seviers are going to&#xA;settle at Almora. So is Miss Müller. Sevier was an officer in the Indian&#xA;army for 5 years. So he knows India a good deal. Miss Müller was a&#xA;Theosophist who adopted Akshay. Goodwin is an Englishman, through whose&#xA;shorthand notes it has been possible for the pamphlets to be published.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I am&#xA;being accompanied by three English friends — Capt. and Mrs. Sevier and&#xA;Mr. Goodwin. Mr. Sever and his wife are going to start a place near&#xA;Almora in the Himalayas which I intend to make my Himalayan Centre, as&#xA;well as a place for Western disciples to live as Brahmachārins and&#xA;Sannyāsins. Goodwin is an unmarried young man who is going to travel and&#xA;live with me, he is like a Sannyasin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Keep the ideal in view and work towards&#xA;it. None can live in the world without resistance, without destruction,&#xA;without desire. The world has not come to that state yet when the ideal&#xA;can be realised in society.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;lxxv&#34;&gt;LXXV&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;ALMORA,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;29th May, 1897&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;MY DEAR DOCTOR SHASHI (BHUSHAN GHOSH),&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your letter and the two bottles containing the medicines were duly&#xA;received. I have begun from last evening a trial of your medicines. Hope&#xA;the combination will have a better effect than the one alone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I began to take a lot of exercise on horseback, both morning and&#xA;evening. Since that I am very much better indeed. I was so much better&#xA;the first week of my gymnastics that I have scarcely felt so well since&#xA;I was a boy and used to have &lt;em&gt;kusti&lt;/em&gt; (wrestling) exercises. I really&#xA;began to feel that it was a pleasure to have a body. Every movement made&#xA;me conscious of strength — every movement of the muscles was&#xA;pleasurable. That exhilarating feeling has subsided somewhat, yet I feel&#xA;very strong. In a trial of strength I could make both G. G. and Niranjan&#xA;go down before me in a minute. In Darjeeling I always felt that I was&#xA;not the same man. Here I feel that I have no disease whatsoever, but&#xA;there is one marked change. I never in my life could sleep as soon as I&#xA;got into bed. I must toss for at least two hours. Only from Madras to&#xA;Darjeeling (during the first month) I would sleep as soon as my head&#xA;touched the pillow. That ready disposition to sleep is gone now&#xA;entirely, and my old tossing habit and feeling hot after the evening&#xA;meal have come back. I do not feel any heat after the day meal. There&#xA;being an orchard here, I began to take more fruit than usual as soon as&#xA;I came. But the only fruit to be got here now is the apricot. I am&#xA;trying to get more varieties from Naini Tāl. There has not been any&#xA;thirst even though the days are fearfully hot. . . . On the whole my own&#xA;feeling is one of revival of great strength and cheerfulness, and a&#xA;feeling of exuberant health, only I am afraid I am getting fat on a too&#xA;much milk diet. Don&amp;rsquo;t you listen to what Yogen writes. He is a&#xA;hypochondriac himself and wants to make everybody so. I ate&#xA;one-sixteenth of a &lt;em&gt;barphi&lt;/em&gt; (sweetmeat) in Lucknow, and that according&#xA;to Yogen was what put me out of sorts in Almora! Yogen is expected here&#xA;in a few days. I am going to take him in hand. By the by, I am very&#xA;susceptible to malarious influences. The first week&amp;rsquo;s indisposition at&#xA;Almora might have been caused to a certain extent by my passage through&#xA;the &lt;em&gt;Terai&lt;/em&gt;. Anyhow I feel very, very strong now. You ought to see me,&#xA;Doctor, when I sit meditating in front of the beautiful snow-peaks and&#xA;repeat from the Upanishads: &amp;ldquo;न तस्य रोगो न जरा न मृत्युः प्राप्तस्य&#xA;योगाग्निमयं शरीरम् — He has neither disease, nor decay, nor death; for,&#xA;verily, he has obtained a body full of the fire of Yoga.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The word Vedas includes the three parts, the Samhitas,&#xA;the Brāhmanas, and the Upanishads, according to the universally received&#xA;opinion in India. Of these, the first two portions, as being the&#xA;ceremonial parts, have been nearly put out of sight; the Upanishads have&#xA;alone been taken up by all our philosophers and founders of sects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I wish I were in&#xA;London to be able to accept the invitation with the Raja of Khetri. I&#xA;had a great many dinners to attend in London last season.

I owe her a debt of&#xA;gratitude for all she did for me in Rome. How is Holli? To both of them&#xA;my love, and kiss the new baby for me, my youngest sister.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Leave words when you start for Bombay to somebody to take care of&#xA;three Sannyasins I am sending to Jaipur. Give them food and good&#xA;lodging. They will be there till I come. They are fellows — innocent,&#xA;not learned. They belong to me, and one is my Gurubhāi&#xA;(brother-disciple). If they like, take them to Khetri where I will come&#xA;soon. I am travelling now quietly. I will not even lecture much this&#xA;year. I have no more faith in all this noise and humbug which brings no&#xA;practical good. I must make a silent attempt to start my institution in&#xA;Calcutta; for that I am going to visit different centres quietly to&#xA;collect funds.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;. It&#xA;is indeed wonderful. The move is quite original, and never was the life&#xA;of a great Teacher brought before the public untarnished by the writer&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;mind, as you are presenting this one. The language also is beyond all&#xA;praise, so fresh, so pointed, and withal so plain and easy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I cannot express in adequate terms how I have enjoyed the leaflets. I am&#xA;really in a transport when I read them. Strange, isn&amp;rsquo;t it? Our Teacher&#xA;and Lord was so original, and each one of us will have to be original or&#xA;nothing. I now understand why none of us attempted his life before. It&#xA;has been reserved for you, this great work. He is with you evidently.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I have no shame; to beg&#xA;of one person in the world and that is yourself. Whether you give or&#xA;refuse, it is the same to me. If possible send some money kindly. How&#xA;are you? I am going down by the middle of October.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There is some disturbance with my heart, I am afraid.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However I am very anxious to know about your health. If you like I will&#xA;come over to Khetri to see you.

Change, I do not think, will do&#xA;me any good, as for the last 14 years I do not remember to have stopped&#xA;at one place for 3 months at a stretch. On the other hand if by some&#xA;chance I can live for months in one place, I hope it will do me good. I&#xA;do not mind this. However, I feel that my work in this life is done.&#xA;Through good and evil, pain and pleasure, my life-boat has been dragged&#xA;on. The one great lesson I was taught is that life is misery, nothing&#xA;but misery. Mother knows what is best. Each one of us is in the hands of&#xA;Karma; it works itself out — and no nay. There is only one element in&#xA;life which is worth having at any cost, and it is love. Love immense and&#xA;infinite, broad as the sky and deep as the ocean — this is the one great&#xA;gain in life. Blessed is he who gets it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rishi, Muni, or God — none has power to force an institution on&#xA;society. When the needs of the times press hard on it, society adopts&#xA;certain customs for self-preservation. Rishis have only recorded those&#xA;customs As a man often resorts even to such means as are good for&#xA;immediate self-protection but which are very injurious in the future,&#xA;similarly society also not unfrequently saves itself for the time being,&#xA;but these immediate means which contributed to its preservation turn out&#xA;to be terrible in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I am almost&#xA;desperate I could not accompany you. Neither did the change at&#xA;Vaidyanath do me any good. I nearly died there, was suffocating for&#xA;eight days and nights!! I was brought back to Calcutta more dead than&#xA;alive, and here I am struggling to get back to life again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I shall return shortly from&#xA;Almora, and then I may be able to visit Madras. From Vaniyambadi I have&#xA;received a letter. Write to the people there conveying my love and&#xA;blessings, and tell them that on my way to Madras I shall surely visit&#xA;them. Give my love to all. Don&amp;rsquo;t work too hard.

I am sure it&#xA;will be rightly used.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Capt. Sevier passed away about three months ago. They have made a fine&#xA;place here in the mountains and Mrs. Sevier means to keep it up. I am on&#xA;a visit to her, and I may possibly come over to England with her.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I needed them very much&#xA;just now. The gloom has not lifted with the advent of the new century,&#xA;it is visibly thickening. I went to see Mrs. Sevier at Mayavati. On my&#xA;way I learnt of the sudden death of the Raja of Khetri. It appears he&#xA;was restoring some old architectural monument at Agra, at his own&#xA;expense, and was up some tower on inspection. Part of the tower came&#xA;down, and he was instantly killed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I don&amp;rsquo;t know&#xA;whether I shall go to Madras at all. If I go, it will be strictly&#xA;private. My body and mind are completely worked out; I cannot stand a&#xA;single person. I do not want anybody. I have neither the strength nor&#xA;the money, nor the will to take up anybody with me. Bhaktas (devotees)&#xA;of Guru Maharaj or not, it does not matter. It was very foolish of you&#xA;even to ask such a question. Let me tell you again, I am more dead than&#xA;alive, and strictly refuse to see anybody. If you cannot manage this, I&#xA;don&amp;rsquo;t go to Madras. I have to become a bit selfish to save my body.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I will tear up this one, as the three previous cheques I have&#xA;handed over to my cousin.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Joe is here, and I have seen her twice; she is busy visiting. Mrs.&#xA;Sevier is expected here soon &lt;em&gt;en route&lt;/em&gt; to England. I expected to go to&#xA;England with her, but as it now turns out, I must go on a long&#xA;pilgrimage with my mother.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He has recovered and is now in&#xA;the Math which, thank God, is one of the healthiest places in our&#xA;Bengal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do not know what conversation took place between you and my mother; I&#xA;was not present. I suppose it was only an eager desire on her part to&#xA;see Margot, nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

You wrote on the 22nd&#xA;January, 1901. You tied me to the latchet of a great name, Miss MacLeod.&#xA;Consequently the letter has been following her up and down the world.&#xA;Now it reached me yesterday from Japan, where Miss MacLeod is at&#xA;present. Well, this, therefore, is the solution of the sphinx&amp;rsquo;s riddle.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Thou shalt not join a great name with a small one.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reading your letter I felt like laughing, and also rather sorry. The&#xA;cause of the laughter is that you had a dream through indigestion and&#xA;made yourself miserable, taking it to be real. The cause of my sorrow is&#xA;that it is clear from this that your health is not good, and that your&#xA;nerves require rest very badly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Never have I laid a curse on you, and why should I do so now? All your&#xA;life you have known my love for you, and today are you doubting it?&#xA;True, my temper was ever bad, and nowadays owing to illness it&#xA;occasionally becomes terrible — but know this for certain that my love&#xA;can never cease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

You are&#xA;perfectly correct in saying that we will have to learn many things from&#xA;Japan. The help that Japan will give us will be with great sympathy and&#xA;respect, whereas that from the West unsympathetic and destructive.&#xA;Certainly it is very desirable to establish a connection between India&#xA;and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

My health has been and is&#xA;very bad. I recover for a few days only; then comes the inevitable&#xA;collapse. Well, this is the nature of the disease anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have been touring of late in Eastern Bengal and Assam. Assam is, next&#xA;to Kashmir, the most beautiful country in India, but very unhealthy. The&#xA;huge Brahmaputra winding in and out of mountains and hills, studded with&#xA;islands, is of course worth one&amp;rsquo;s while to see.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I would that my health were what you expected — at least to write you a&#xA;long letter. It is getting worse, in fact, every day, and so many&#xA;complications and botherations without that. I have ceased to notice it&#xA;at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wish you all joy in your lovely Swiss chalet — splendid health, good&#xA;appetite, and a light study of Swiss or other antiquities just to liven&#xA;things up a bit. I am so glad you are breathing the free air of the&#xA;mountains, but sorry that Sam is not in the best of health. Well, there&#xA;is no anxiety about it, he has naturally such a fine physique. . . .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Addressee &lt;a href=&#34;112_blessed_and_beloved.htm&#34;&gt;»&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;cxi&#34;&gt;CXI&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;THE MATH, BELUR,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;HOWRAH,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;29th August, 1901&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;BLESSED AND BELOVED (Shri M. N. Banerji.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am getting better, though still very weak. . . . The present&#xA;disturbance is simply nervous. Anyhow I am getting better every day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am so much beholden to mother (Holy Mother — Shri Sarada Devi) for her&#xA;kind proposal, only I am told by everybody in the Math that Nilambar&#xA;Babu&amp;rsquo;s place and the whole of the village of Belur at that becomes very&#xA;malarious this month and the next. Then the rent is so extravagant. I&#xA;would therefore advise mother to take a little house in Calcutta if she&#xA;decides to come. I may in all probability go and live there, as it is&#xA;not good for me to catch malaria over and above the present prostration.&#xA;I have not asked the opinion of Saradananda or Brahmananda yet. Both are&#xA;in Calcutta. Calcutta is healthier these two months and very much less&#xA;expensive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had to consult Brahmananda and others, and they were everyone in&#xA;Calcutta, hence the delay in replying to your last.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The idea of taking a house for a whole year must be worked out with&#xA;deliberation. As on the one hand there is some risk of catching malaria&#xA;in Belur this month, in Calcutta on the other hand there is the danger&#xA;of plague. Then again one is sure to avoid fever if one takes good care&#xA;not to go into the interior of this village, the immediate bank of the&#xA;river being entirely free from fever. Plague has not come to the river&#xA;yet, and all the available places in this village are filled with&#xA;Marwaris during the plague season.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I did not write the letter nor send the wire. I was too ill&#xA;at the time to do either. I have been ever since my trip to East Bengal&#xA;almost bedridden. Now I am worse than ever with the additional&#xA;disadvantage of impaired eyesight. I would not write these things, but&#xA;some people require details, it seems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;. There are&#xA;references, though in Buddhistic literature, to Vedanta, and the&#xA;Mahāyāna school of Buddhism is even Advaitistic. Why does Amara Singha,&#xA;a Buddhist, give as one of the names of Buddha — Advayavādi ? Charu&#xA;writes, the word Brahman does not occur in the Upanishads! &lt;em&gt;Quelle&#xA;bêtise&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hold the Mahayana to be the older of the two schools of Buddhism.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The theory of Māyā is as old as the Rik-Samhitā. The Shvetāshvatara&#xA;Upanishad contains the word &amp;ldquo;Maya&amp;rdquo; which is developed out of Prakriti. I&#xA;hold that Upanishad to be at least older than Buddhism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

A&#xA;copy of a Madras journal that I received through the kindness of Joe&#xA;delighted me exceedingly, as the reception Niveditā had in Madras was&#xA;for the good of both Nivedita and Madras. Her speech was indeed&#xA;beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope you are resting well after your long journey, and so is Nivedita.&#xA;I wish it so much that you should go for a few hours to a few villages&#xA;west of Calcutta to see the old Bengali structures made of wood, bamboo,&#xA;cane, mica, and grass.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Regarding&#xA;Nivedita&amp;rsquo;s School, I have written to her what I have to say. My opinion&#xA;is that she should do what she considers to be best.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t ask my opinion on any other matter either. That makes me lose my&#xA;temper. Just do that work for me — that is all. Send money, for at&#xA;present only a few rupees are left.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There is wide-spread plague in Allahabad; I&#xA;do not know if it will spread to Varanasi this time . . . . Tell Mrs.&#xA;Bull from me that a tour to Ellora and other places involves a difficult&#xA;journey, and it is now very hot. Her body is so tired that it is not&#xA;proper to go on a tour at present. It is several days since I received a&#xA;letter from &amp;ldquo;Uncle&amp;rdquo; (Mr. Okakura was endearingly so called. &amp;ldquo;Kura&amp;rdquo;&#xA;approximating to &amp;ldquo;Khurhā&amp;rdquo; in Bengali which means uncle; Swamiji out of&#xA;fun calls him uncle.). The last news was that he had gone to Ajanta.&#xA;Mahant also has not replied, perhaps he will do so with the reply to&#xA;Raja Pyari Mohan&amp;rsquo;s letter. . . .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have received no letter, neither the registered one you&#xA;refer to nor any other. Whether the Nepalese gentleman came and what&#xA;happened — I have not been able to know anything at all about it. To&#xA;write a simple letter so much trouble and so much delay! . . . Now I&#xA;shall be relieved if I get the accounts. That also I get who knows after&#xA;how many months! . . .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;. . . In my opinion, a race must first cultivate a great respect for&#xA;motherhood, through the sanctification and inviolability of marriage,&#xA;before it can attain to the ideal of perfect chastity. The Roman&#xA;Catholics and the Hindus, holding marriage sacred and inviolate, have&#xA;produced great chaste men and women of immense power. To the Arab,&#xA;marriage is a contract or a forceful possession, to be dissolved at&#xA;will, and we do not find there the development of the idea of the virgin&#xA;or the Brahmachārin. Modern Buddhism — having fallen among races who had&#xA;not yet come up to the evolution of marriage — has made a travesty of&#xA;monasticism. So until there is developed in Japan a great and sacred&#xA;ideal about marriage (apart from mutual attraction and love), I do not&#xA;see how there can be great monks and nuns. As you have come to see that&#xA;the glory of life is chastity, so my eyes also have been opened to the&#xA;necessity of this great sanctification for the vast majority, in order&#xA;that a few lifelong chaste powers may be produced. . . .&lt;/p&gt;</description>
