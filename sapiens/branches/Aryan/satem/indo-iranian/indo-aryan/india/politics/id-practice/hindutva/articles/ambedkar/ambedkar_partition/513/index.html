CHAPTER XIII
MUST THERE BE PAKISTAN?
I
[The burden of proof on the advocates of Pakistan is a heavy one]
With all that has gone before, the sceptic, the nationalist, the conservative and the old-world Indian will not fail to ask “Must there be Pakistan?” No one can make light of such an attitude. For the problem of Pakistan is indeed very grave, and it must be admitted that the question is not only a relevant and fair one to be put to the Muslims and to their protagonists, but it is also important. Its importance lies in the fact that the limitations on the case for Pakistan are so considerable in their force that they can never be easily brushed aside. A mere statement of these limitations should be enough to make one feel the force they have. It is writ large on the very face of them. That being so, the burden of proof on the Muslims for establishing an imperative need in favour of Pakistan is very heavy. Indeed the issue of Pakistan or to put it plainly of partitioning India, is of such a grave character that the Muslims will not only have to discharge this burden of proof but they will have to adduce evidence of such a character as to satisfy the conscience of an international tribunal before they can win their case. Let us see how the case for Pakistan stands in the light of these limitations.">

<p>CHAPTER XIII</p>
<p>MUST THERE BE PAKISTAN?</p>
<p>I<br>

<p>With all that has gone before, the sceptic, the nationalist, the

be Pakistan?&rdquo; No one can make light of such an attitude. For the problem
of Pakistan is indeed very grave, and it must be admitted that the
question is not only a relevant and fair one to be put to the Muslims
and to their protagonists, but it is also important. Its importance lies
in the fact that the limitations on the case for Pakistan are so
considerable in their force that they can never be easily brushed aside.
A mere statement of these limitations should be enough to make one feel
the force they have. It is writ large on the very face of them. That
being so, the burden of proof on the Muslims for establishing an
imperative need in favour of Pakistan is very heavy. Indeed the issue of
Pakistan or to put it plainly of partitioning India, is of such a grave
character that the Muslims will not only have to discharge this burden
of proof but they will have to adduce evidence of such a character as to
satisfy the conscience of an international tribunal before they can win
their case. Let us see how the case for Pakistan stands in the light of
these limitations.</p>
<p>II<br>
[Is it really necessary to divide what has long been a single whole?]</p>
<p>Must there be Pakistan because a good part of the Muslim population
of India happens to be concentrated in certain defined areas which can
be easily severed from the rest of India? Muslim population is
admittedly concentrated in certain well defined areas, and it may be
that these areas are severable. But what of that? In considering this
question one must never lose sight of the fundamental fact that nature
has made India one single geographical unit. Indians are of course
quarrelling and no one can prophesy when they will stop quarrelling. But
granting the fact, what does it establish? Only that Indians are a
quarrelsome people. It does not destroy the fact that India is a single
geographical unit. Her unity is as ancient as Nature. Within this
geographic unit and covering the whole of it there has been a cultural
unity from time immemorial. This cultural unity has defied political and
racial divisions. And at any rate for the last hundred and fifty years
all institutions—cultural, political, economic, legal and
administrative—have been working on a single, uniform spring of action.
In any discussion of Pakistan the fact cannot be lost sight of, namely,
that the starting point, if not the governing factor, is the fundamental
unity of India. For it is necessary to grasp the fact that there are
really two cases of partition which must be clearly distinguished. There
is a case in which the starting point is a pre existing state of
separation so that partition is. only a dissolution of parts which were
once separate and which were subsequently joined together. This case is
quite different from another in which the starting point at all times is
a state of unity. Consequently partition in such a case is the severance
of a territory which has been one single whole into separate parts.
Where the starting point is not unity of territory, i.e., where there
was disunity before there was unity, partition—which is only a return to
the original—may not give a mental shock. But in India the starting
point is unity. Why destroy its unity now, simply because some Muslims
are dissatisfied? Why tear it when the unit is one single whole from
historical times ?</p>
<p>III<br>
[Other nations have survived for long periods despite communal
antagonisms]</p>
<p>Must there be Pakistan because there is communal antagonism between
the Hindus and the Muslims? That the communal antagonism exists nobody
can deny. The question however is, is the antagonism such that there is
no will to live together in one country and under one constitution?
Surely that will to live together was not absent till 1937. During the
formulation of the provisions of the Government of India Act, 1935, both
Hindus and Musalmans accepted the view that they must live together
under one constitution and in one country and participated in the
discussions that preceded the passing of the Act. And what was the state
of communal feeling in India between—say 1920 and 1935? As has been
recorded in the preceding pages, the history of India from 1920 up to
1935 has been one long tale of communal conflict in which the loss of
life and loss of property had reached a most shameful limit. Never was
the communal situation so acute as it was between this period of 15
years preceding the passing of the Government of India Act, 1935, and
yet this long tale of antagonism did not prevent the Hindus and the
Musalmans from agreeing to live in a single country and under a single
constitution. Why make so much of communal antagonism now?</p>
<p>Is India the only country where there is communal antagonism ? What
about Canada ? Consider what Mr. Alexander Brady**<a href="#n01">/1/</a>** has to
say on the relations between the English and the French in Canada :—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Of the four original provinces, three, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and
Ontario had populations substantially of the same Anglo-Saxon stock
and traditions. Originally a by-product of the American Revolution,
these colonies were established by the 50,000 United Empire Loyalists
who trekked north from persecution and cut their settlements out of
the wilderness. Previous to the American Revolution, Nova Scotia had
received a goodly number of Scotch and American settlers, and in all
the colonies after the Revolution the Loyalist settlements were
reinforced by immigrants from Great Britain and Ireland.&rdquo;<br>
* * * *<br>
&ldquo;Very different was the province of Quebec. French Canada in 1867 was
a cultural unit by itself, divorced from the British communities, by
the barriers of race, language and religion. Its life ran in a
different mould. Stirred by a Catholic faith mediaeval in its
intensity, it viewed with scant sympathy the mingled Puritanism and
other-worldliness of a Protestantism largely Calvinistic. The
religious faiths of the two peoples were indeed poles apart. In
social, if not always in religious, outlook, English Protestantism
tended towards democracy, realism and modernism: the Catholicism of
the French leaned to paternalism, idealism and a reverence for the
past.&rdquo;<br>
* * * *<br>
&ldquo;What French Canada was in 1867 it remains substantially today. It
still cherishes beliefs, customs, and institutions which have little
hold on the English provinces. It has distinctive thought and
enthusiasm, and its own important values. Its attitude, for example,
on marriage and divorce is in conflict with the dominant view, not
merely of the rest of Canada, but of the remainder of
Anglo-Saxon-North-America.&rdquo;<br>
* * * *<br>
&ldquo;The infrequency of intercourse between the two peoples is illustrated
in Canada&rsquo;s largest city, Montreal. About 63 per cent. of the
population is French and 24 per cent British. Here, if anywhere, is
ample scope for association, but in fact they remain apart and
distinct except where business and politics force them together. They
have their own residential sections; their own shopping centres, and
if either is more notable for racial reserve, it is the English.&rdquo;<br>
* * * *<br>
&ldquo;The English-speaking residents of Montreal, as a whole, have made no
effort to know their French-speaking fellow citizens, to learn their
language, to understand their traditions and their aspirations, to
observe with a keen eye and a sympathetic mind their qualities and
their defects. The separation of the two peoples is encouraged by the
barrier of language. There is a wealth of significance in the fact
revealed by the census of 1921; viz., that about 50 per cent. of the
Canadians of French origin were unable to speak English and 95 per
cent. of those of British origin were unable to speak French. Even in
Montreal, 70 per cent. of the British could not speak French and 34
per cent. of the French could not speak English. The absence of a
common language maintains a chasm between the two nationalities and
prevents fusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The significance of Confederation is that it provided an instrument
of government which enabled the French, while retaining their distinct
national life, to become happy partners with the British and attain a
Canadian super-nationality, embracing a loyally extending beyond their
own group to that of the Dominion as a whole.&rdquo;<br>
* * * *<br>
&ldquo;While the federal system successfully opened the path for a wider
nationality in Canada, the co-operation which it sponsored has at
times been subjected to severe strain by the violent clash of opinion
between the French and the British. The super-nationality has indeed
often been reduced to a shadow.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>What about South Africa ? Let those who do not know the relationship
between the Boers and the British ponder over what Mr. E. H.
Brooks**<a href="#n02">/2/</a>** has to say :—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;How far is South African nationalism common to both the white races
of South Africa? There is, of course, a very real and intense
Afrikander nationalism ; but it is, generally speaking, a sentiment
confined to one of the white races, and characterised, significantly
enough, by a love of the Afrikans language, the tongue of the early
settlers from Holland, as modified slightly by Huguenot and German
influence, and greatly by the passage of time. Afrikander nationalism
has a tendency to be exclusive, and has little place for the man who,
while in every way a devoted son of South Africa, is wholly or mainly
English-speaking.&rdquo;<br>
* * * *<br>
&ldquo;Is there a South African nation today?</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are certain factors in South African life which militate
against an affirmative answer.&rdquo;<br>
* * * *<br>
&ldquo;Among English-speaking South Africans there are found many tendencies
inclined to hinder the cause of national unity. With all the great
virtues of the race they have its one cardinal defect—a lack of
imagination, a difficulty in putting one&rsquo;s self in the other man&rsquo;s
place. Nowhere does this come out more clearly than in the language
question. Until recently comparatively few English-speaking South
Africans have studied Africans except as a business proposition or (as
in the Civil Service) more or less under compulsion; and fewer still
have used it conversationally. Many have treated it with open
contempt—a contempt in inverse proportion to their knowledge of it—and
the majority with mere tolerance, exasperated or amused according to
temperament.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Another witness on the same point may be heard. He is Mr. Manfred
Nathan.<strong><a href="#n03">/3/</a></strong> This is what he has to say on the relations
between the Boers and the British in South Africa :—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;They are also, in the main, both of them Protestant peoples—although
this is not of too great importance nowadays, when differences of
religion do not count for much. They engage freely in commercial
transactions with each other.&rdquo;<br>
* * * *<br>
&ldquo;Nevertheless it cannot with truth be said that hitherto there has
been absolutely free social intercourse between these two great
sections of the white population. It has been suggested that this is
partly due to the fact that in the large urban centres the population
is predominantly English, and that the townsfolk know little of the
people in the country and their ways of life. But even in the country
towns, though there is, as a rule, much greater friendliness, and much
hospitality shown by Boers to visitors, there is not much social
intercourse between the two sections apart from necessary business or
professional relationship, and such social functions, charitable or
public, as require co-operation.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Obviously India is not the only place where there is communal
antagonism. If communal antagonism does not come in the way of the
French in Canada living in political unity with the English, if it does
not come in the way of the English in South Africa living in political
unity with the Dutch, if it does not come in the way of the French and
the Italians in Switzerland living in political unity with the Germans
why then should it be impossible for the Hindus and the Muslims to agree
to live together under one constitution in India?</p>
<p>IV<br>
[Cannot legitimate past grievances be redressed in some less drastic
way?]</p>
<p>Must there be Pakistan because the Muslims have lost faith in the
Congress majority? As reasons for the loss of faith Muslims cite some
instances of tyranny and oppression practised by the Hindus and connived
at by the Congress Ministries during the two years and three months the
Congress was in office. Unfortunately Mr. Jinnah did not persist in his
demand for a Royal Commission to inquire into these grievances. If he
had done it, we could have known what truth there was in these
complaints. A perusal of these instances, as given in the
reports**<a href="#n04">/4/</a>** of the Muslim League Committees, leaves upon the
reader the impression that although there may be some truth in the
allegations there is a great deal which is pure exaggeration. The
Congress Ministries concerned have issued statements repudiating the
charges. It may be that the Congress during the two years and three
months that it was in office did not show statesmanship, did not inspire
confidence in the minorities, nay, tried to suppress them. But can it be
a reason for partitioning India? Is it not possible to hope that the
voters who supported the Congress last time will grow wiser and not
support the Congress? Or may it not be that if the Congress returns to
office it will profit by the mistakes it has made, revise its
mischievous policy, and thereby allay the fear created by its past
conduct?</p>
<p>V<br>
[Cannot the many things shared between the two groups be emphasized?]</p>
<p>Must there be Pakistan because the Musalmans are a nation? It is a
pity that Mr. Jinnah should have become a votary and champion of Muslim
Nationalism at a time when the whole world is decrying against the evils
of nationalism and is seeking refuge in some kind of international
organization. Mr. Jinnah is so obsessed with his new-found faith in
Muslim Nationalism that he is not prepared to see that there is a
distinction between a society, parts of which are disintegrated, and a
society parts of which have become only loose, which no sane man can
ignore. When a society is disintegrating—and the two-nation theory is a
positive disintegration of society and country—it is evidence of the
fact that there do not exist what Carlyle calls &ldquo;organic
filaments&rdquo;—i.e., the vital forces which work to bind together the parts
that are cut asunder. In such cases disintegration can only be
regretted. It cannot be prevented. Where, however, such organic
filaments do exist, it is a crime to overlook them and deliberately
force the disintegration of society and country as the Muslims seem to
be doing. If the Musalmans want to be a different nation, it is not
because they have been, but because they want to be. There is much in
the Musalmans which, if they wish, can roll them into a nation. But
isn&rsquo;t there enough that is common to both Hindus and Musalmans, which if
developed, is capable of moulding them into one people? Nobody can deny
that there are many modes, manners, rites and customs which are common
to both. Nobody can deny that there are rites, customs and usages based
on religion which do divide Hindus and Musalmans. The question is, which
of these should be emphasized. If the emphasis is laid on things that
are common, there need be no two nations in India. If the emphasis is
laid on points of difference, it will no doubt give rise to two nations.
The view that seems to guide Mr. Jinnah is that Indians are only a
people, and that they can never be a nation. This follows the line of
British writers who make it a point of speaking of Indians as the people
of India, and avoid speaking of the Indian nation. Granted Indians are
not a nation, that they are only a people. What of that? History records
that before the rise of nations as great corporate personalities, there
were only peoples. There is nothing to be ashamed [of] if Indians are
no more than a people. Nor is there any cause for despair that the
people of India—if they wish—will not become one nation. For, as
Disraeli said, a nation is a work of art and a work of time. If the
Hindus and Musalmans agree to emphasize the things that bind them and
forget those that separate them, there is no reason why in course of
time they should not grow into a nation. It may be that their
nationalism may not be quite so integrated as that of the French or the
Germans. But they can easily produce a common state of mind on common
questions, which is the sum total which the spirit of nationalism helps
to produce and for which it is so much prized. Is it right for the
Muslim League to emphasize only differences, and ignore altogether the
forces that bind? Let it not be forgotten that if two nations come into
being it will not be because it is predestined. It will be the result of
deliberate design.</p>
<p>The Musalmans of India, as I have said, are not as yet a nation in
the <em>de jure</em> or <em>de facto</em> sense of the term, and all that can be said
is that they have in them the elements necessary to make them a nation.
But granting that the Musalmans of India are a nation, is India the only
country where there are going to be two nations? What about Canada?
Everybody knows that there are in Canada two nations, the English and
the French. Are there not two nations in South Africa, the English and
the Dutch? What about Switzerland? Who does not know that there are
three nations living in Switzerland, the Germans, the French and the
Italians? Have the French in Canada demanded partition because they are
a separate nation? Do the English claim partition of South Africa
because they are a distinct nation from the Boers? Has anybody ever
heard that the Germans, the French and the Italians have ever agitated
for the fragmentation of Switzerland because they are all different
nations? Have the Germans, the French and the Italians ever felt that
they would lose their distinctive cultures if they lived as citizens of
one country and under one constitution? On the contrary, all these
distinct nations have been content to live together in one country under
one constitution, without fear of losing their nationality and their
distinctive cultures. Neither have the French in Canada ceased to be
French by living with the English, nor have the English ceased to be
English by living with the Boers in South Africa. The Germans, the
French and the Italians have remained distinct nations, notwithstanding
their common allegiance to a common country and a common constitution.
The case of Switzerland is worthy of note. It is surrounded by
countries, the nationalities of which have a close religious and racial
affinity with the nationalities of Switzerland. Notwithstanding these
affinities, the nationalities in Switzerland have been Swiss first and
Germans, Italians and French afterwards.</p>
<p>Given the experience of the French in Canada, the English in South
Africa and the French and the Italians in Switzerland, the questions
that arise are, why should it be otherwise in India? Assuming that the
Hindus and the Muslims split into two nations, why cannot they live in
one country and under one constitution? Why should the emergence of the
two-nation theory make partition necessary? Why should the Musalmans be
afraid of losing their nationality and national culture by living with
the Hindus? If the Muslims insist on separation, the cynic may well
conclude that there is so much that is common between the Hindus and the
Musalmans that the Muslim leaders are afraid that unless there is
partition, whatever little distinctive Islamic culture is left with the
Musalmans will eventually vanish by continued social contact with the
Hindus, with the result that in the end instead of two nations there
will grow up in India one nation. If the Muslim nationalism is so thin,
then the motive for partition is artificial and the case for Pakistan
loses its very basis.</p>
<p>VI<br>
[&lsquo;Hindu Raj&rsquo; must be prevented at all costs, but is Pakistan the best
means?]</p>
<p>Must there be Pakistan because otherwise Swaraj will be a Hindu Raj?
The Musalmans are so easily carried away by this cry that it is
necessary to expose the fallacies underlying it.</p>
<p>In the first place, is the Muslim objection to Hindu Raj a
conscientious objection, or is it a political objection? If it is a
conscientious objection, all one can say is that it is a very strange
sort of conscience. There are really millions of Musalmans in India who
are living under unbridled and uncontrolled Hindu Raj of Hindu Princes
and no objection to it has been raised by the Muslims or the Muslim
League. The Muslims had once a conscientious objection to the British
Raj. Today not only have they no objection to it, but they are the
greatest supporters of it. That there should be no objection to British
Raj or to undiluted Hindu Raj of a Hindu Prince, but that there should
be objection to Swaraj for British India on the ground that it is Hindu
Raj, as though it was not subjected to checks and balances, is an
attitude the logic of which it is difficult to follow.</p>
<p>The political objections to Hindu Raj rest on various grounds. The
first ground is that Hindu society is not a democratic society. True, it
is not. It may not be right to ask whether the Muslims have taken any
part in the various movements for reforming Hindu society, as
distinguished from proselytising. But it is right to ask if the
Musalmans are the only sufferers from the evils that admittedly result
from the undemocratic character of Hindu society. Are not the millions
of Shudras and non-Brahmins, or millions of the Untouchables, suffering
the worst consequences of the undemocratic character of Hindu society?
Who benefits from education, from public service and from political
reforms, except the Hindu governing class—composed of the higher castes
of the Hindus—which form[s] not even 10 per cent. of the total Hindu
population? Has not the governing class of the Hindus, which controls
Hindu politics, shown more regard for safeguarding the rights and
interests of the Musalmans than they have for safeguarding the rights
and interests of the Shudras and the Untouchables? Is not Mr. Gandhi,
who is determined to oppose any political concession to the
Untouchables, ready to sign a blank cheque in favour of the Muslims?
Indeed, the Hindu governing class seems to be far more ready to share
power with the Muslims than it is to share power with the Shudras and
the Untouchables. Surely, the Muslims have the least ground to complain
of the undemocratic character of Hindu society.</p>
<p>Another ground on which the Muslim objection to Hindu Raj rests is
that the Hindus are a majority community and the Musalmans are a
minority community. True. But is India the only country where such a
situation exists? Let us compare the conditions in India with the
conditions in Canada, South Africa and Switzerland. First, take the
distribution of population. In Canada,<strong><a href="#n05">/5/</a></strong> out of a total
population of 10,376,786, only 2,927,990 are French. In South
Africa,<strong><a href="#n06">/6/</a></strong> the Dutch number 1,120,770 and the English are
only 783,071. In Switzerland,<strong><a href="#n07">/7/</a></strong> out of the total population
of 4,066,400, the Germans are 2,924,313, the French 831,097, and the
Italians 242,034.</p>
<p>This shows that the smaller nationalities have no fear of being
placed under the Raj of a major community. Such a notion seems to be
quite foreign to them. Why is this so? Is it because there is no
possibility of the major nationality establishing its supremacy in those
centres of power and authority, namely the Legislature and in the
Executive? Quite the contrary. Unfortunately no figures are available to
show the actual extent of representation which the different major and
minor nationalities have in Switzerland, Canada and South Africa. That
is because there is no communal reservation of seats such as is found in
India. Each community is left to win in a general contest what number of
seats it can. But it is quite easy to work out the probable number of
seats which each nationality can obtain on the basis of the ratio of its
population to the total seats in the Legislature. Proceeding on this
basis, what do we find? In Switzerland the total representatives in the
Lower House is 187. Out of them the German population has a possibility
of winning 138, French 42 and Italians only 7 seats. In South Africa out
of the total of 153, there is a possibility of the English gaining 62,
and the Dutch 94 seats. In Canada the total is 245. Of these the
French**<a href="#n08">/8/</a>** have only 65. On this basis it is quite clear that
in all these countries there is a possibility of the major nationality
establishing its supremacy over the minor nationalities. Indeed, one may
go so far as to say that speaking <em>de jure</em> and as a mere matter of
form, in Canada the French are living under the British Raj, the English
in South Africa under the Dutch Raj, and the Italians and French in
Switzerland under the German Raj. But what is the position <em>de facto</em>?
Have Frenchmen in Canada raised a cry that they will not live under
British Raj? Have Englishmen in South Africa raised a cry that they will
not live under Dutch Raj? Have the French and Italians in Switzerland
any objection to living under the German Raj? Why should then the
Muslims raise this cry of Hindu Raj?</p>
<p>Is it proposed that the Hindu Raj should be the rule of a naked
communal majority? Are not the Musalmans granted safeguards against the
possible tyranny of the Hindu majority? Are not the safeguards given to
the Musalmans of India wider and better than the safeguards which have
been given to the French in Canada, to the English in South Africa and
to the French and the Italians in Switzerland? To take only one item
from the list of safeguards, haven&rsquo;t the Musalmans got an enormous
degree of weightage in representation in the Legislature? Is weightage
known in Canada, South Africa or Switzerland? And what is the effect of
this weightage to Muslims? Is it not to reduce the Hindu majority in the
Legislature? What is the degree of reduction? Confining ourselves to
British India and taking account only of the representation granted to
the territorial constituencies, Hindu and Muslim, in the Lower House in
the Central Legislature under the Government of India Act, 1935, it is
clear that out of a total of 187, the Hindus have 105 seats and the
Muslims have 82 seats. Given these figures one is forced to ask, where
is [any cause for] the fear of the Hindu Raj?</p>
<p>If [the] Hindu Raj does become a fact, it will, no doubt, be the
greatest calamity for this country. No matter what the Hindus say,
Hinduism is a menace to liberty, equality and fraternity. On that
account it is incompatible with democracy. Hindu Raj must be prevented
at any cost. But is Pakistan the true remedy against it? What makes
communal Raj possible is a marked disproportion in the relative strength
of the various communities living in a country. As pointed out above,
this disproportion is not more marked in India than it is in Canada,
South Africa and Switzerland. Nonetheless there is no British Raj in
Canada, no Dutch Raj in South Africa, and no German Raj in Switzerland.
How have the French, the English and the Italians succeeded in
preventing the Raj of the majority community being established in their
country? Surely not by partition. What is their method? Their method is
to put a ban on communal parties in politics. No community in Canada,
South Africa or Switzerland ever thinks of starting a separate communal
party. What is important to note is that it is the minority nations
which have taken the lead in opposing the formation of a communal party.
For they know that if they form a communal political party the major
community will also form a communal party and the majority community
will thereby find it easy to establish its communal Raj. It is a vicious
method of self-protection. It is because the minority nations are fully
aware how they will be hoisted on their own petard that they have
opposed the formation of communal political parties.</p>
<p>Have the Muslims thought of this method of avoiding Hindu Raj? Have
they considered how easy it is to avoid it? Have they considered how
futile and harmful the present policy of the League is? The Muslims are
howling against the Hindu Maha Sabha and its slogan of Hindudom and
Hindu Raj. But who is responsible for this? Hindu Maha Sabha and Hindu
Raj are the inescapable nemesis which the Musalmans have brought upon
themselves by having a Muslim League. It is action and counter-action.
One gives rise to the other. Not partition, but the abolition of the
Muslim League and the formation of a mixed party of Hindus and Muslims
is the only effective way of burying the ghost of Hindu Raj. It is, of
course, not possible for Muslims and other minority parties to join the
Congress or the Hindu Maha Sabha so long as the disagreement on the
question of constitutional safeguards continues. But this question will
be settled, is bound to be settled, and there is every hope that the
settlement will result in securing to the Muslims and other minorities
the safeguards they need. Once this consummation, which we so devoutly
wish, takes place, nothing can stand in the way of a party re-alignment,
of the Congress and the Maha Sabha breaking up, and of Hindus and
Musalmans forming mixed political parties based on an agreed programme
of social and economic regeneration, and thereby avoid[ing] the danger
of both Hindu Raj or Muslim Raj becoming a fact. Nor should the
formation of a mixed party of Hindus and Muslims be difficult in India.
There are many lower orders in the Hindu society whose economic,
political and social needs are the same as those of the majority of the
Muslims, and they would be far more ready to make a common cause with
the Muslims for achieving common ends than they would with the high
caste of Hindus who have denied and deprived them of ordinary human
rights for centuries. To pursue such a course cannot be called an
adventure. The path along that line is a well trodden path. Is it not a
fact that under the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms in most Provinces, if not
in all, the Muslims, the Non-Brahmins, and the Depressed Classes united
together and worked the reforms as members of one team from 1920 to
1937? Herein lay the most fruitful method of achieving communal harmony
among Hindus and Muslims, and of destroying the danger of a Hindu Raj.
Mr. Jinnah could have easily pursued this line. Nor was it [=would it
have been] difficult for Mr. Jinnah to succeed in it. Indeed Mr. Jinnah
is the one person who [would have] had all the chances of success on
his side if he had tried to form such a united non-communal party. He
has the ability to organize. He had the reputation of a nationalist.
Even many Hindus who were opposed to the Congress would have flocked to
him, if he had only sent out a call for a united party of like-minded
Hindus and Muslims. What did Mr. Jinnah do? In 1937 Mr. Jinnah made his
entry into Muslim politics, and strangely enough he regenerated the
Muslim League, which was dying and decaying ,and of which only a few
years ago he would have been glad to witness the funeral. However
regrettable the starting of such a communal political party may have
been, there was in it one relieving [=reassuring] feature. That was
the leadership of Mr. Jinnah. Everybody felt that with the leadership of
Mr. Jinnah the League could never become a merely communal party. The
resolutions passed by the League during the first two years of its new
career indicated that it would develop into a mixed political party of
Hindus and Muslims. At the annual session of the Muslim League held at
Lucknow in October 1937, altogether 15 resolutions were passed. The
following two are of special interest in this connection.</p>
<p>Resolution**<a href="#n09">/9/</a>** No. 7:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;This meeting of the All India Muslim League deprecates and protests
against the formation of Ministries in certain Provinces by the
Congress parties in flagrant violation of the letter and the spirit of
the Government of India Act, 1935, and Instrument of Instructions and
condemns the Governors for their failure to enforce the special powers
entrusted to them for the safeguards of the interest of the Musalmans
<em>and other important minorities</em>.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Resolution**<a href="#n09">/9/</a>** No. 8:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Resolved that the object of the All India Muslim League shall be the
establishment in India of Full Independence in the form of federation
of free democratic states in which the rights and interests of the
Musalmans <em>and other minorities</em> are adequately and effectively
safeguarded in the constitution.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>[An] Equal number of resolutions were passed at the next annual
session of the League held at Patna in December 1938.
Resolution**<a href="#n09">/9/</a>** No. 10 is noteworthy. It reads as follows :—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The All India Muslim League reiterates its view that the scheme of
Federation embodied in the Government of India Act, 1935, is not
acceptable, but in view of the further developments that have taken
place or may take place from time to time it hereby authorises the
President of the All India Muslim League to adopt such course as may
be necessary with a view to explore the possibility of a suitable
alternative which will safeguard the interests of the Musalmans <em>and
other minorities</em> in India.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>By these resolutions Mr. Jinnah showed that he was for a common
front between the Muslims and other non-Muslim minorities. Unfortunately
the catholicity and statesmanship that underlies these resolutions did
not last long. In 1939 Mr. Jinnah took a somersault and outlined the
dangerous and disastrous policy of isolation of the Musalmans by passing
that notorious resolution in favour of Pakistan. What is the reason for
this isolation? Nothing but the change of view that the Musalmans were a
nation and not a community!! One need not quarrel over the question
whether the Muslims are a nation or a community. But one finds it
extremely difficult to understand how the mere fact that the Muslims are
a nation makes political isolation a safe and sound policy.
Unfortunately Muslims do not realize what disservice Mr. Jinnah has done
to them by this policy. But let Muslims consider what Mr. Jinnah has
achieved by making the Muslim League the only organization for the
Musalmans. It may be that it has helped him to avoid the possibility of
having to play the second fiddle. For inside the Muslim camp he can
always be sure of the first place for himself. But how does the League
hope to save, by this plan of isolation, the Muslims from Hindu Raj?
Will Pakistan obviate the establishment of Hindu Raj in Provinces in
which the Musalmans are in a minority? Obviously it cannot. This is what
would happen in the Muslim minority Provinces if Pakistan came. Take an
all-India view. Can Pakistan prevent the establishment of Hindu Raj at
the centre over Muslim minorities that will remain [in] Hindustan? It
is plain that it cannot. What good is Pakistan then? Only to prevent
Hindu Raj in Provinces in which the Muslims are in a majority and in
which there could never be Hindu Raj!! To put it differently, Pakistan
is unnecessary to Muslims where they are in a majority because there,
there is no fear of Hindu Raj. It is worse than useless to Muslims where
they are in a minority, because Pakistan or no Pakistan, they will have
to face a Hindu Raj. Can politics be more futile than the politics of
the Muslim League? The Muslim League [was] started to help minority
Muslims, and has ended by espousing the cause of majority Muslims. What
a perversion in[=of] the original aim of the Muslim League! What a
fall from the sublime to the ridiculous! Partition as a remedy against
Hindu Raj is worse than useless.</p>
<p>VII<br>
[If Muslims truly and deeply desire Pakistan, their choice ought to be
accepted]</p>
<p>These are some of the weaknesses in the Muslim case for Pakistan
which have occurred to me. There might be others which have not struck
me. But the list as it is, is quite a formidable one. How do the Muslims
propose to meet them? That is a question for the Muslims and not for me.
My duty as a student of the subject extends to setting forth these
weaknesses. That I have done. I have nothing more to answer for.</p>
<p>There are, however, two other questions of such importance that this
discussion cannot be closed with any sense of completeness without
reference to them. The purpose of these questions is to clear the ground
between myself and my critics. Of these questions, one I am entitled to
ask the critics, the other the critics are entitled to ask me.</p>
<p>Beginning with the first question, what I feel like asking the
critics is, what good do they expect from a statement of these
weaknesses? Do they expect the Musalmans to give up Pakistan if they are
defeated in a controversy over the virtues of Pakistan? That of course
depends upon what method is adopted to resolve this controversy. The
Hindus and the Musalmans may follow the procedure which Christian
missionaries had set up in early times in order to secure converts from
amongst the Hindus. According to this procedure a day was appointed for
a disputation, which was open to [the] public, between a Christian
missionary and a Brahmin, the former representing the Christian religion
and the latter holding himself out as the protagonist of the Hindu
religion, with the condition that whoever failed to meet the case
against his religion was bound to accept the religion of the other. If
such a method of resolving the dispute between the Hindus and the
Muslims over the issue of Pakistan was [=were] agreed upon, there may
[=might] be some use in setting out this string of weaknesses. But let
it not be forgotten that there is another method of disposing of a
controversy which maybe called Johnsonian, after the manner which Dr.
Johnson employed in dealing with [the] arguments of Bishop Berkeley.
It is recorded by Boswell that when he told Dr. Johnson that the
doctrine of Bishop Berkeley that matter was non-existent and that
everything in the universe was merely ideal, was only an ingenious
sophistry but that it was impossible to refute it, Dr. Johnson with
great alacrity answered, striking his foot with mighty force against a
large stone till he rebounded from it, saying, &ldquo;I refute it thus.&rdquo; It
may be that the Musalmans will agree, as most rational people do, to
have their case for Pakistan decided by the tests of reason and
argument. But I should not be surprised if the Muslims decided to adopt
the method of Dr. Johnson and say &ldquo;Damn your arguments! We want
Pakistan.&rdquo; In that event, the critic must realize that any reliance
placed upon the limitations for destroying the case for Pakistan will be
of no avail. It is therefore no use being jubilant over the logic of
these objections to Pakistan.</p>
<p>Let me now turn to the other question which I said the critic is
entitled to put to me. What is my position regarding the issue of
Pakistan, in the light of the objections which I have set out? I have no
doubts as to my position. I hold firmly that, subject to certain
conditions detailed in the chapters that follow, if the Musalmans are
bent on having Pakistan, then it must be conceded to them. I know my
critics will at once accuse me of inconsistency, and will demand reasons
for so extraordinary a conclusion— extraordinary because of the view
expressed by me in the earlier part of this chapter that the Muslim case
for Pakistan has nothing in it which can be said to carry the compelling
force which the decree of an inexorable fate may be said to have. I
withdraw nothing from what I have said as to the weaknesses in the
Muslim case for Pakistan. Yet I hold that if the Muslims must have
Pakistan, there is no escape from conceding it to them. As to the
reasons which have led me to that conclusion, I shall not hesitate to
say that the strength or weakness of the logic of Pakistan is not one of
them. In my judgement there are two governing factors which must
determine the issue. First is the defence of India, and second is the
sentiment of the Muslims. I will state why I regard them as decisive,
and how in my opinion they tell in favour of Pakistan.</p>
<p>To begin with the first. One cannot ignore that what is important is
not the winning of independence, but the having of the sure means of
maintaining it. The ultimate guarantee of the independence of a country
is a safe army—an army on which you can rely to fight for the country at
all time and in any eventuality. The army in India must necessarily be a
mixed army composed of Hindus and Muslims. If India is invaded by a
foreign power, can the Muslims in the army be trusted to defend India?
Suppose invaders are their co-religionists. Will the Muslims side with
the invaders, or will they stand against them and save India? This is a
very crucial question. Obviously, the answer to this question must
depend upon to what extent the Muslims in the army have caught the
infection of the two-nation theory, which is the foundation of Pakistan.
If they are infected, then the army in India cannot be safe. Instead of
being the guardian of the independence of India, it will continue to be
a menace and a potential danger to its independence. I confess I feel
aghast when I hear some Britishers argue that it is for the defence of
India that they must reject Pakistan. Some Hindus also sing the same
tune. I feel certain that either they are unaware as to what the
determining factor in the independence of India is, or that they are
talking of the defence of India not as an independent country
responsible for its own defence but as a British possession to be
defended by them against an intruder. This is a hopelessly wrong angle
of vision. The question is not whether the British will be able to
defend India better if there was no partition of India. The question is
whether Indians will be able to defend a free India. To that, I repeat,
the only answer is that Indians will be able to defend a free India on
one and one condition alone—namely, if the army in India remains
non-political, unaffected by the poison of Pakistan. I want to warn
Indians against the most stupid habit that has grown up in this country
of discussing the question of Swaraj without reference to the question
of the army. Nothing can be more fatal than the failure to realize that
a political army is the greatest danger to the liberty of India. It is
worse than having no army.</p>
<p>Equally important is the fact that the army is the ultimate sanction
which sustains Government in the exercise of its authority inside the
country, when it is challenged by a rebellious or recalcitrant element.
Suppose the Government of the day enunciates a policy which is
vehemently opposed by a section of the Muslims. Suppose the Government
of the day is required to use its army to enforce its policy. Can the
Government of the day depend upon the Muslims in the army to obey its
orders and shoot down the Muslim rebels? This again depends upon to what
extent the Muslims in the army have caught the infection of the
two-nation theory. If they have caught it, India cannot have a safe and
secure Government.</p>
<p>Turning to the second governing factor, the Hindus do not seem to
attach any value to sentiment as a force in politics. The Hindus seem to
rely upon two grounds to win against the Muslims. The first is that even
if the Hindus and the Muslims are two nations, they can live under one
state. The other is that the Muslim case for Pakistan is founded on
strong sentiment rather than upon clear argument. I don&rsquo;t know how long
the Hindus are going to fool themselves with such arguments. It is true
that the first argument is not without precedent. At the same time it
does not call for much intelligence to see that its value is extremely
limited. two nations and one state is a pretty plea. It has the same
attraction which a sermon has, and may result in the conversion of
Muslim leaders. But instead of being uttered as a sermon, if it is
intended to issue it as an ordinance for the Muslims to obey, it will be
a mad project to which no sane man will agree. It will, I am sure,
defeat the very purpose of Swaraj. The second argument is equally silly.
That the Muslim case for Pakistan is founded on sentiment is far from
being a matter of weakness; it is really its strong point. It does not
need deep understanding of politics to know that the workability of a
constitution is not a matter of theory. It is a matter of sentiment. A
constitution, like clothes, must suit as well as please. If a
constitution does not please, then however perfect it may be, it will
not work. To have a constitution which runs counter to the strong
sentiments of a determined section is to court disaster if not to invite
rebellion.</p>
<p>It is not realized by the Hindus that, assuming there is a safe
army, rule by armed forces is not the normal method of governing a
people. Force, it cannot be denied, is the medicine of the body politic
and must be administered when the body politic becomes sick. But just
because force is the medicine of the body politic it cannot be allowed
to become its daily bread. A body politic must work as a matter of
course by springs of action which are natural. This can happen only when
the different elements constituting the body politic have the will to
work together and to obey the laws and orders passed by a duly
constituted authority. Suppose the new constitution for a United India
contained in it all the provisions necessary to safeguard the interests
of the Muslims. But suppose the Muslims said [=say] &ldquo;Thank you for
your safeguards, we don&rsquo;t want to be ruled by you&rdquo;; and suppose they
boycott the Legislatures, refuse to obey laws, oppose the payment of
taxes; what is to happen? Are the Hindus prepared to extract obedience
from Muslims by the use of Hindu bayonets? Is Swaraj to be an
opportunity to serve the people, or is it to be an opportunity for
Hindus to conquer the Musalmans and for the Musalmans to conquer the
Hindus? Swaraj must be a Government of the people, by the people, and
for the people. This is the <em>raison d&rsquo;etre</em> of Swaraj and the only
justification for Swaraj. If Swaraj is to usher in an era in which the
Hindus and the Muslims will be engaged in scheming against each other,
the one planning to conquer its rival, why should we have Swaraj, and
why should the democratic nations allow such a Swaraj to come into
existence? It will be a snare, a delusion and a perversion.</p>
<p>The non-Muslims do not seem to be aware that they are presented with
a situation in which they are forced to choose between various
alternatives. Let me state them. In the first place they have to choose
between [the] Freedom of India and the Unity of India. If the
non-Muslims will insist on the Unity of India, they put the quick
realization of India&rsquo;s freedom into jeopardy. The second choice relates
to the surest method of defending India, whether they can depend upon
Muslims in a free and united India to develop and sustain along with the
non-Muslims the necessary will to defend the common liberties of both;
or whether it is better to partition India and thereby ensure the safety
of Muslim India by leaving its defence to the Muslims, and of non-Muslim
India by leaving its defence to non-Muslims.</p>
<p>As to the first, I prefer [the] Freedom of India to the Unity of
India. The Sinn Feinners who were the staunchest of nationalists to be
found anywhere in the world and who, like the Indians, were presented
with similar alternatives, chose [=preferred] the freedom of Ireland
to the unity of Ireland. The non-Muslims who are opposed to partition
may well profit by the advice tendered by the Rev. Michael O&rsquo;Flanagan,
at one time Vice-President of the Feinns, to the Irish Nationalists on
the issue of the partition of Ireland.<strong><a href="#n10">/10/</a></strong> Said the Rev.
Father :—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If we reject Home Rule rather than agree to the exclusion of the
Unionist parts of Ulster, what case have we to put before the world?
We can point out that Ireland is an island with a definite
geographical boundary. That argument might be all right if we were
appealing to a number of Island nationalities that had themselves
definite geographical boundaries. Appealing, as we are, to continental
nations with shifting boundaries, that argument will have no force
whatever. National and geographical boundaries scarcely ever coincide.
Geography would make one nation of Spain and Portugal; history has
made two of them. Geography did its best to make one nation of Norway
and Sweden ; history has succeeded in making two of them. Geography
has scarcely anything to say to the number of nations upon the North
American continent; history has done the whole thing. If a man were to
try to construct a political map of Europe out of its physical map, he
would find himself groping in the dark. Geography has worked hard to
make one nation out of Ireland; history has. worked against it. The
island of Ireland and the national unit of Ireland simply do not
coincide. In the last analysis the test of nationality is the wish of
the people.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>These words have emanated from a profound sense of realism which we
in India so lamentably lack.</p>
<p>On the second issue, I prefer the partitioning of India into Muslim
India and non-Muslim India as the surest and safest method of providing
for the defence of both. It is certainly the safer of the two
alternatives. I know it will be contended that my fears [=fear] about
the loyalty of the Muslims in the army to a Free and United India,
arising from the infection of the two-nation theory, is only an
imaginary fear. That is no doubt true. That does not militate against
the soundness of the choice I have made. I may be wrong. But I certainly
can say without any fear of contradiction that, to use the words of
Burke, it is better to be ridiculed for too great a credulity than to be
ruined by too confident a sense of security. I don&rsquo;t want to leave
things to chance. To leave so important an issue, as the defence of
India, to chance is to be guilty of the grossest crime.</p>
<p>Nobody will consent to the Muslim demand for Pakistan unless he is
forced to do so. At the same time, it would be a folly not to face what
is inevitable and face it with courage and common sense. Equally would
it be a folly to lose the part one can retain in the vain attempt of
preserving the whole.</p>
<p>These are the reasons why I hold that if the Musalman will not yield
on the issue of Pakistan, then Pakistan must come. So far as I am
concerned, the only important question is: Are the Musalmans determined
to have Pakistan? Or is Pakistan a mere cry? Is it only a passing mood?
Or does it represent their permanent aspiration? On this there may be
difference of opinion. Once it becomes certain that the Muslims want
Pakistan there can be no doubt that the wise course would be to concede
the principle of it.</p>
