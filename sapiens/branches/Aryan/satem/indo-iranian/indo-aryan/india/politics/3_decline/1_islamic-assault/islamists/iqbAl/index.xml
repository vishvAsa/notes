      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;em&gt;Islam as an Ethical and a Political Ideal: Iqbal&amp;rsquo;s maiden&#xA;English lecture&lt;/em&gt;, ed. by S. Y. Hashimy (Lahore: Orientalia, 1955), pp.&#xA;53-101. Slightly edited for classroom use by FWP. Typos have been&#xA;corrected, and punctuation slightly adjusted in some cases for clarity.&#xA;All italics are those of the original text. Some extremely short&#xA;paragraphs have been joined into longer ones. Annotations in square&#xA;brackets, and paragraph numbers in double brackets, are by FWP. Iqbal no&#xA;doubt recited the Qur&amp;rsquo;anic verses in Arabic; the verse citations and&#xA;English translations given here are those provided by S. Y. Hashimy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: G. Allana, Pakistan Movement Historical Documents (Karachi:&#xA;Department of International Relations, University of Karachi, nd&#xA;[1969]), pp. 129-133. A few long paragraphs have been broken into&#xA;shorter ones. All editorial annotations in square brackets are by FWP.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two letters from Iqbal to Jinnah (1937)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;28th May, 1937&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My dear Mr. Jinnah,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much for your letter which reached me in due course. I am&#xA;glad to hear that you will bear in mind what I wrote to you about the&#xA;changes in the constitution and programme of the League. I have no doubt&#xA;that you fully realise the gravity of the situation as far as Muslim&#xA;India is concerned. The League will have to finally decide whether it&#xA;will remain a body representing the upper classes of Indian Muslims or&#xA;Muslim masses who have so far, with good reason, no interest in it.&#xA;Personally I believe that a political organisation which gives no&#xA;promise of improving the lot of the average Muslim cannot attract our&#xA;masses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
