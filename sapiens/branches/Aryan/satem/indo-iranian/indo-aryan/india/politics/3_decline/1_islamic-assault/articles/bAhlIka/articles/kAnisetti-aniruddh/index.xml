      <description>&lt;p&gt;Who brought Sanskrit to Baghdad? This is how Iranian Buddhists, Zoroastrians changed Arabs&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sanskrit scholars were patronised by the Caliphate. This reshapes how we should think about conquest today.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today in India, the Arab conquests of the 7th to the 8th centuries CE are confidently proclaimed as proof of “Islam’s” iconoclastic savagery. These, along with the later careers of &lt;a href=&#34;https://theprint.in/opinion/mahmud-of-ghazni-had-punjab-haryana-karnataka-soldiers-history-is-not-as-simple-as-you-think/1156172/&#34;&gt;Mahmud Ghazni&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://theprint.in/opinion/srimad-muhammad-ghori-orthodox-maniac-in-west-asia-promoter-of-sanskrit-lakshmi-coins-in-east/1194661/&#34;&gt;Muhammad Ghori&lt;/a&gt;, are generally believed to have destroyed the older cultures and religions that they came in contact with.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mahmud of Ghazni had Punjab, Haryana, Karnataka soldiers. History is not as simple as you think&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Muhammad Ghori had Lakshmi coins, Ghazni’s robes were worn by a Khajurao king. Don’t view history through ‘Hindu king vs Muslim invader’ lens.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anirudh Kanisetti&lt;br&gt;&#xA;06 October, 2022 10:38 am IST&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Kara-Khanid ruler Ilig Khan on horse submitting to Mahmud of Ghazni riding an elephant, Persian painting, 1306-14 | Wikimedia Commons&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From a Chandella king of Khajuraho wearing Mahmud of Ghazni’s robes to Muhammad Ghori’s Lakshmi coins, the reality of medieval Turks—at the frontiers of both the Persianate and Indic worlds—is far more complex than any modern political binary would have us believe. After all, perhaps the most pervasive idea about Indian history is that it was constantly subject to brutish invasions from West and Central Asia, which were valiantly resisted by “Hindu” kings until “Muslim” invaders eventually succeeded in breaking through and establishing the Delhi Sultanate in the 12th century. From VD Savarkar and RC Majumdar to recent Bollywood films and TV news anchors, this telling of history has been received as gospel and is considered a justification for discriminating against Indian Muslims today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Srimad Muhammad Ghori: orthodox maniac in West Asia, promoter of Sanskrit, Lakshmi coins in east&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Govindaraja, son of Muhammad Ghori’s rival Prithviraj Chauhan, was appointed as the ruler of Ajmer. He accepted robes of honour from Ghori and sent him golden statues as tribute.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://theprint.in/author/anirudh-kanisetti/&#34;&gt;Anirudh Kanisetti&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;03 November, 2022 11:52 am IST&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Minaret of Jam, built by the Ghor kings and inscribed with verses targeting various heterodox Muslim sects | Commons&lt;/p&gt;</description>
