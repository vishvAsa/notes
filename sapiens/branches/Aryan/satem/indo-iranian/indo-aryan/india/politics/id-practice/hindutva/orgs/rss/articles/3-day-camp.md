My 3-Day Stay at an RSS Camp in Kerala

1. For as  long as I can remember, 31st December has been an occasion to party. But this year I got an unusual invite - to attend a 3 day RSS camp that offered training in how to take part in - and organise - an RSS shaka. The moment the offer came over the phone, I said yes.

2. To be honest, the camp was way outside my comfort zone. In fact, the word comfort does not even come into the picture. From the moment I and 5 others (all over 45 years of age) walked into the camp, in lush green Kerala, it was back to the basics.

## Day 1
3. First, surrender your mobile phone. No contact with the outside world except via newspapers. However, you can give your family an emergency contact number (of one of the senior camp officials).

4. No bottled water. The head of the local institution, where the camp was held, saw me and a fellow attendee bring in 5 bottles of mineral water and it was like smuggling contraband via the green channel. “There’s hot, boiled water kept outside your rooms and you can only use that water. We have certain rules here at the camp and everybody who attends these sessions is expected to follow them. No exceptions,” he said politely but firmly.

5. We entered the camp grounds around 6pm, and at 7pm it started with a Sanskrit prayer to Bharat Mata (Mother India), followed by the shaka drill, marching, calisthenics and yoga.

6. I had suffered a shoulder injury in February 2025 and after several weeks of physiotherapy the shoulder was on the recovery route. So I was a bit worried about having a relapse.

7. Two of our shaka colleagues bailed midway through the physical exercises due to fatigue. A third person aged 60 also bailed, fearing a migraine attack.

8. Things went well for me. The dreaded relapse didn’t happen despite an hour of yoga (Surya Namaskar, Tadasana etc), drills and marching. I was sweating but it was like being at the gym - doable. 

9. After the physicals, around 8.30 pm, the head of the institution had a private meeting with the young oldies and said the physicals were compulsory and only those who are absolutely confident of their abilities should attend. He said the drills we had on Day 1 were just a sample.

10. The three colleagues, who had quit midway through the drills, decided they couldn’t cope or take a punt on their health, and left.

11. After a light dinner of rice and vegetables, lights out at 10.30. We slept on mats in a large and airy classroom. I had brought a light Rajasthani quilt, cotton bedsheet and a travel pillow. After the intense physicals, I had expected to sleep like a log but because of the unfamiliar territory, sleep came late.

## Day 2
12. Day 2. We were woken up at 4.45 am. Brush teeth, then some black coffee, followed by 30 minutes of Sanskrit prayers to Mother India, followed by an hour of drills. Simple but tasty puttu and sambhar breakfast and tea at 7.45 am.

13. Prayers to Mother India at 9.00 am. Talks by senior and experienced RSS karyakartas on various topics - how to be a a model citizen (respect rules while driving, do not litter, do not use swear words etc); how India was enslaved because of a lack of national unity; how to inculcate devotion to the country; why the study of English language is important (for jobs).

14. The lack of mobile phone access didn’t bother any of us. It was like the mobile phone didn’t matter. No itchy fingers yearning to post or doom scroll. The people around us mattered more.

15. Lunch was basic - rice, veggies - but tasty.

16. In our group, there were 40 people - 6 adults and 36 children (class IX to university first year). I could be wrong, but almost 100% of the kids were from blue collar backgrounds. It made me realise that Hindu dharma is being sustained by Hindus from villages and small towns. Two of the adults were lorry drivers. A third one was a Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh member - blue collar.

## Day 3
17. Day 3. More of the same, except that breakfast was better - idlis, chutney, sambhar.

18. Lunch was a Kerala feast. I was called in as a server of warm water to the diners. When I reached the table of the head of the institution and asked, “Shall I pour you some water?” he raised his head and recognised me - the person most likely to quit. He gave me a knowing smile that said, “Oh so you are still around? Good.” I smiled back. My uncle, an old time RSS person, joked as I poured him water, “The service is very slow here.”

19. More prayers to Mother India. I was thinking of bunking as I was unable to say the long Sanskrit words. But decided to bite the bullet.

20. Tea and sweets (unni appam) at 4.00 pm. 

21. The final day afternoon drills and yoga were more intense than the previous days, but enjoyable. Perhaps the fear of Sanskrit was making me like the outside drills more.

22. Talks by senior RSS officials. The discussions were engaging but I felt the younger ones were feeling bored. They need to be drawn in by detailed discussions about Indian history.

23. In the evening we finally got our phones back. But nobody was in a tearing hurry to check WA, FB or X. We were exchanging numbers and saying goodbye and promising to meet up soon.

## Retrospective
24. Will I be going back? Much as I would like to be part of the Sangh Parivar (family) in an official capacity, I don't see that happening.

25. Here’s why. On Day 1, after we were asked to take back the water to our car, I told my teammates that there’s no way I can drink water from a common container in which others, especially 30 children, are filling their glasses from. That’s a deal killer for me.

26. I must confess here that after we were asked not to bring bottled water into the camp, I slunk back to the car and smuggled in two bottles of mineral water. Okay, I will probably survive drinking water from a common container, but I’m not prepared for the ick factor. The RSS needs to amend this rule.

27. Secondly, the compulsory chanting of prayers in Sanskrit makes me feel like a novice. My pronunciation is atrocious and I struggle with the longer words. I started dreading the prayer sessions because almost everyone was able to breeze through them but I alone was struggling. It’s a very unusual feeling - of being the at the bottom of the class. The last time I was struggling was in Class X with Maths, Physics and Chemistry. I used to be depressed all the time those days. To be faced with the same emotions at this stage of life is like dej vu. I’ve tried YouTube and the Bhagva app to master the RSS prayers, but I seem to have hit a wall with Sanskrit.

28. I left the camp on the night of December 31 with a bounce in my step. After the end of 3 days, my back was hurting bad, and my butt was so sore that I was barely able to sit. But after a hot shower, the pain disappeared and the most amazing thing is that my shoulder injury seems like a memory. Yoga, callisthenics, and drills seem to have cured it.

29. At the end of it, I’m thankful to the RSS for the experience. There’s no organisation in the world quite like it. We are truly living during exceptional times - the Ram Mandir was rebuilt after 500 years, and Thiruvananthapuram got a Hindu mayor for the very first time. All this was possible because exactly 100 years ago, one man, Dr Keshav Baliram Hedgewar, founded the RSS to achieve national unity and pride.
