      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;conversations-and-dialogues&#34;&gt;CONVERSATIONS AND DIALOGUES&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;XXX&lt;br&gt;&#xA;(&lt;em&gt;Translated from &lt;a href=&#34;pns_b9_265_e7_30.pdf&#34;&gt;Bengali&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Shri Priya Nath Sinha&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We evince a sad lack of restraint in conversation or any conjoint action&#xA;such as music and so on. Everyone tries to put himself foremost. The&#xA;jostling at railway or steamer station is another illustration of this.&#xA;A friend of Swamiji had a talk with him one day at the Math on this&#xA;subject. Swamiji remarked, &amp;ldquo;You see, we have an old adage: &amp;lsquo;If your son&#xA;is not inclined to study, put him in the Durbars (Sābha).&amp;rsquo; The word&#xA;Sabha here does not mean social meetings, such as take place&#xA;occasionally at people&amp;rsquo;s houses — it means royal Durbars. In the days of&#xA;the independent kings of Bengal, they used to hold their courts mornings&#xA;and evenings. There all the affairs of the State were discussed in the&#xA;morning — and as there were no newspapers at that time, the king used to&#xA;converse with the leading gentry of the capital and gather from them all&#xA;information regarding the people and the State. These gentlemen had to&#xA;attend these meetings, for if they did not do so, the king would inquire&#xA;into the reason of their non-attendance. Such Durbars were the centres&#xA;of culture in every country and not merely in ours. In the present day,&#xA;the western parts of India, especially Rajputana, are much better off in&#xA;this respect than Bengal, as something similar to these old Durbars&#xA;still obtains there.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He had gone to Calcutta to see one of his&#xA;friends, and returning from there stopped for a few minutes at Balaram&#xA;Babu&amp;rsquo;s house at Baghbazar. He then sent for another friend to accompany&#xA;him to the Math. The friend came, and the following conversation took&#xA;place between him and Swamiji:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
