CHICAGO,

*the 14th Dec. '95*

DEAR SIR —

The gentleman I have the pleasure of introducing to you was the chairman
of the Chicago Parliament of religions.

All India owes him a deep debt of gratitude. He is now on a tour through
our country, and I am sure you will help him in seeing your part of the
country and oblige.

Yours with blessings,  
VIVEKANANDA
