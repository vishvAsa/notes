      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/Saatvata/status/2012258808911765631&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hindus were forcibly expelled in the 1567 decree, so the only Hindus who remained in Goa were those who resided in the Novas Conquistas (Ponda, Quepem, Sanguem). Many Hindus fled to North Canara (Karwar, Ankola, Kumta), South Canara (Udupi, Mangalore), Kolhapur, Sawantwadi, Pune and Ratnagiri where a few were offered land grants. They didn&amp;rsquo;t return until the Pombaline reforms and the abolition of the Goa Inquisition, though non-Christians were still subject to the Xenddi tax up until 1840.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
