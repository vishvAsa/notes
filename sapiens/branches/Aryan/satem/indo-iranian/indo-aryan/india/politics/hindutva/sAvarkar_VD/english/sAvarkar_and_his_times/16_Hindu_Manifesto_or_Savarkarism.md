I

The ideal and ideology which Sav£irkar laid down and
propagated is called the Hindu Sanghatan ideology or Hindu
Nationalism or Savarkarism. Although a natural development,
an outgrowth and a manilestation of the various views and
tenets upheld by several Hindu nationalists jointly, severally
or individually, the ideology is put into a form and finally
formulated and codified into an integrated doctrine of social
and political outlook on life by Savarkar. Savarkar is there-
fore to this Hindu ideology what Newton is to the Law of
Gravitation or Marx to Socialism. Each of them applied
his own logic to the diverse views and brought unity in
diversity.

According to Carlyle, the merit of originality is not novelty ;
it is sincerity. To him ‘ the believing man is the original
man What is absolutely original ? Some say originality
is but a pair of fresh eyes. Milton and Shakespeare wrote
nothing new. Milton borrowed his description of Paradise, of
Satan and many other parts of his Paradise Lost from
St. Avi’tus who wrote the Expulsion from Paradise, Milton
borrowed largely also from Du Bartas.- Conceding that
Shakespeare found nearly all his material in the writings of
others and that he was indebted to others for most of the
stories of his plays, in his lecture on Shakespeare, Ingersoll
states that * the question is not, Who furnished the stone, or
Who owned the quarry ? but, Who chiselled the statue ? " "
The originality of the philosophy of Marx has often been
questioned as it is said he owed his theory of abolition of
private property to Mably ; he borrowed his labour theory
from Locke and Adam Smith or Ricardo and the theory of
exploitation and surplus value and historical materialism from

others. But none denies that Marx is the sculptor of socialism.
So, too, though there have been great Hindu leaders of
pronounced Hindu thought before Savarkar or existed even
in his day, none of them advocated all the principles or singly
fought for thorn. They were stone-masons to this ideology,
but the sculptor was Savarkar. In modern times Vivekananda.
Tilak, Lajpat Rai and Hardayal were looked upon as great
Hindu leaders of Thought, who .spoke and wrote about Hindu
thought. Vivekananda was a great philosopher, who devoted
his lifetime and great talents to the unfolding of the Hindu
pliilosophy and propagated it without political bias or a desii’e
to win worldly gain to Mollier India. Nevertheless, he was
of opinion that a nation in India must be a union of those
whose hearts beat to the same spiritual tune.' His ideal for
India was “ an Islamic body with a Vedantic heart.” -

Conscious of the separatist tendencies of the Muslims, Lajpat
Rai, a staunch Hindu leader, held that Hindus were a nation
in themselves because they represented a type of civilization
all their own. Hardayal wrote in the Pratap of Lahore in
1925 ; “ I declare that the future of the Hindu Race, of

Hindusthan and the Punjab, rests on these four pillars — (1)
Hindu Sanghatan, (2) Hindu Raj, (3) Shuddhi of Moslems,
and (4) Conquest and Shuddhi of Afghanisthan and the
Frontiers. So long as the Hindu Nation does not accomplish
these four things, the safety of our children and great-grand-
children will be ever in danger, and the safety of the Hindu
Race will be impossible.” * Tilak, a representative leader of
Hindu Thought, had neither the time nor an opportunity to
apply his mind to the geographical iiationalism of his day.
The only seer, who was conscious of this ideology in some
way, was Dayananda. But unlike Savarkar, he perhaps held
that there was no knowledge beyond the Vedas ; besides,
Dayananda was more a social than a political force.

Sri Bhai Parmananda w'as a strong advocate of the concept
of the Hindu Nation. Swami Shraddhananda and Bhai
Parmananda were kin to Lajpat Rai just as Hardayal was kith
to Savarkar ; but none was kin to Savarkar. There were

promoters of Hindu solidarity and advocates of the removal of
untouchability in Maharashtra and in other provinces too,
before Savarkar. They did their work in their own way
according to the demands of their times and needs as saviours
of Hindusthan. There were champions of Hindu nationalism
amongst the contemporaries of Savarkar. But the ideas of
the social reform of Savarkar’s pi'edecessors and the politics
of his contemporaries found a rare combination in Savarkar.
Savarkar held definite thoughts with regard to the rejuvena-
tion of Hindudom. His -ipproach to the Hindu-Muslim
problem, the doctrine of iibsolute non-violence in thought,
word and deed, and the foreign policy distinguishes him from
all other leaders ; and his radical views about social regenera-
tion and revolution, political concepts and precepts of a nation,
economic policy, problem of the national script and Lingua
Franca, and his ideas about a World Commonwealth or
Humanism form the Hindu Manijesto of a social and political
system for the Hindus in an outspoken, concise and virile foim,
sustaining their struggle for existence and enabling them to
contribute to the peace and prosperity of the world. No
wonder then that Savarkar’s monumental work entitled
Hindutva was acclaimed by Swami Shraddhananda as a
message given at the dawn of a new age ; and Savarkar’s
famous presidential speech at Ahmedabad giving the
fundamental principles of the Hindu Nation was hailed by
Bhai Parmananda as the Bible of Hindu Sanghatan.

What is Hindutva

The word Efindu is the heart of that ideology, and
Hindusthan its geographical centre. According to Savarkar
“ every person is a Hindu who regards and owns this Bharat
Bhoomi — ^this land from the Indus to the seas, as his Father-
land and Holyland — the land of origin of his religion and the
cradle of his faith.” Therefore it follows that the followers
of Vedism, Jainism, Buddhism, Sikhism and all Hill-tribes are
all Hindus. Around this life-centre moves Hindutva which
Savarkar defines as not only the spiritual or religious history
of our people, but the history in full pervasion. Hinduism is
only a derivative, a fraction, a part of Hindutva. Hindutva is

not, he observes, particularly theocratic, a religious dogma or
a creed. It embraces all the departments of thought and
activity of the whole being of the Hindu race. Forty
centuries, if not more, he states, liad been at work to mould
it as it is. Prophets and poets, lawyers and lawgivers, heroes
and historians, have thought, lived, fought and died just to
have it spelled thus.*

What is Sanghatan? and Why?

This movement is called Hindu Sanghatan and means
organization for the solidarity and strength of the Hindu
Nation. But what constitutes a nation ?

What Constitutes a Nation?

A nation is a group of mankind which is bound together by
some or all of these common ties such as common religion and
culture, common history and traditions, common literature,
and consciousness of common rights and wrongs, occupying
a territory of geographical unity, and aspiring to form a
political unit. When a nation realizes this ambition, it
becomes a State. A nation may be without a State. A State
is a governmental unit and it may have more than one
nationality under its rule. By ‘ nationality ’, Mr. C. B. Fawcell,
the author of Frontiers — A Study In Political Geography,
understands the group of qualities which characterize the
people of any one nation. French nationality, he says, is that
group of qualities which distinguish the French from other
European people.-

Eminent Authobs on the Pkinciples

The principal elements instrvunental in the formation of a
nation are a common past, a common tradition and a will to
live together. Renan defines a nation as a social group whose
solidarity has been established by the sentiment of the
sacrifices made in the past and of those it is still ready to
make in the future. In his essay on Nationality he observes

* Savarkar, Hindutva, p. 3.

* C. B. Fawcell, Frontiers — A Study In Political Geography, p. 5.



HINDU MANIFESTO OR SAVARKARISM 227

that “ a nation is a living soul, a spiritual principle. . . . One
is the common possession of a rich heritage of memories ; the
other is actual consent, the desire to live together, the will
to preserve worthily the undivided inheritance which has
been handed down.” Renan proceeds ; “ The nation Uke the
individual is the outcome of long past, of efforts and sacrifices,
and devotion.” Prof. Harold J. Laski lays it down that it
(nationality) implies a sense of special unity which marks
off those who share in it from the rest of mankind.
“ That unit is the outcome of common history, of victories
won and traditions created by a corporate effort. There
grows up a sense of kinship which binds men into
oneness. They recognise their hkeness, and emphasize their
difference from other men.” ^ Dr. Holland Rose writes that
“ nationality is at its height a union of hearts once made, never
unmade — a spiritual conception unconquerable, indestruc-
tible.” * “ In reality,” observes Garner, “ a nation is not a
portion of society politically organised, that is, it is not a
State, but in its perfect form it is a portion of a society
definitely separated from the rest of the world by natural
geographical boundaries, the inhabitants of which have a
common civilization, common customs, traits of character and
traditions.” Mr. Israel Zangwill in his Principle of Nationalities
discusses some of the factors that constitute a nation, viz. unity
of religion, unity of language, possession of common traditions
of suffering and of joy. By tradition he means songs, legends,
stories attached to heroes, etc. “ A nationality,” states
Durkheim, the Belgian Sociologist, with admirable brevity,
“ is a group of which the members, for racial or merely historic
reasons, wish to live under the same laws and form a State.”
G. P. Gooch, an eminent historian, in his Nationalism dealing
with some factors that constitute a nation, observes : “ But
the strongest of all is the identity of political antecedents ; the
possession of a national history and consequent community of
recollections ; collective pride and humiliation, pleasures and
regret, connected with the same incidents in the past.” ^

SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES


Savarkar on Nation

All these tenets acknowledged as the authoritative exposi-
tion of nationalism vindicate Savarkar’s stand that in
Hindusthan the Hindus are a nation, and other people are
communities and numerically, therefore, minorities. Savarkar
observes that “ the ancient and modem history of the Hindus
is common. They have friends and enemies in common. They
have faced common dangers and won victories in common.
One in national despair and one in national hope, the Hindu.^^
by an admirable process through assimilation, elimination and
consolidation are welded together during the aeons of
common life and common habitat.” Above all, the Hindus art'
bound together, continues Savarkar, by the dearest lies, most
sacred and mo.st enduring bonds of a common Fatherland and
common Holyland. Verily the Hindus, states Savarkai’, as a
people differ most markedly from any other people in the
world than they differ among themselves. All tests whatever
of a common country, race, religion, language that go to entitle
a people to form a nation, entitle the Hindus vdth a greater
emphasis to that claim.

Savarkar declares that the festivals and cultural forms of
the Hindus are common. The Vedic Rishis are their common
pride, their Grammarians Panini and Patanjali, their poets
Bhavabhuti and Kalidas, their heroes Shree Ram and Shree
Krishna, Shiva ji and Pratap, Guru Govind and Banda are a
source of common inspiration. Like their ancient and sacred
language, the Sanskrit, states he, their scripts also are
fashioned on the same basis and the Nagari script has been
the common vehicle of the sacred writings since centuries in
the past.

India is dear to us, further observes Savarkar, because it
has been and is the home of our Hindu Race, the land which
has been the cradle of our prophets and heroes, and Gods and
Godmen. Otherwise, he goes on, land for land, there may be
many a country, as rich in gold and silver on the face of the
earth. “River for river, the Mississippi is nearly as good as
the Ganges and its waters are not altogether bitter. The
stones, trees and greens in Hindusthan are just as good or



HINDU MANIFESTO OR SAVARKARISM 229

bad stones and trees and greens of the respective species else-
where. Hindusthan is a Fatherland and Holyland to us not
because it is a land entirely unlike any other land in the
world, but because it is associated with our History and has
been the home of our forefathers wherein our mothers gave
us the first suckle at their breast and our fathers cradled us on
their knees from generation to generation,” asserts he.

To Savarkar the Hindu na n is an organic growth and no
paper-make make-.shift. It is noi a mushroom growth. It is not
a treaty nation. It was not cu t'' order. It is not an outlandish
make-shift. It has grown out of this soil and has its roots
struck deep and wide in it. It is not a fiction, he proceeds,
invented to spite the Moslems or anybody in the world. But
it is a fact as stupendous and solid as the Himalayas that
border our North.

Indian and Hindu Nationalisms

The Indian National Congress believed and upheld the
territorial nationalism which they called Indian Nationalism.
To them a nation meant peoples living on a common land.
Whoever came to India, the Arabs, the Jews, the Russians,
the Germans, the Portuguese, the Greeks, they formed a
nation together with the Hindus, because these new-comers
also lived in India. “ Congress committed the serious mistake,”
states Savarkar, “ at its very start of overlooking this
fundamental, social and political principle that in the forma-
tion of nations, religious, racial, cultural and historical
affinities count immensely more than their territorial unity.”
What they called Indian Nation Savarkar called the Indian
Stale, because he believed that the Hindus could form a State
with other minorities.

Savarkar found nothing objectionable in the ideal of Indian
Nationalism which was in fact, says he, a noble one suited to
the Hindu mentality with its synthetic trend, always prone to
philosophy with a universal urge. It is also true, he believes,
that the ideal of politics itself ought to be a human State, all
mankind for its citizens and the earth for its Motherland.
But is territorial unity the only constituent of a common
Nationality ? He replies that not territorial unity, but the



230 SAVAHKAR AND HIS TIMES

religious, racial and cutural unity is what counts most in the
formation of a national unit. The idea of territorial
nationality alone was envisaged by the Congressites, who in
general preferred to be totally ignorant of Muslim history,
theology and political trend of mind. Savarkar observes that
“ Moslems in general and the Indian Moslems in particular
have not yet grown out the historical stage, of intense
religiosity and the theological concepts of State. Their
theological politics divide the human world into two groups
only — ^the Moslem land and the enemy land. All lands Avhich
are either inhabited entirely by the Moslems or ruled over
by the Moslems are Mo.slem lands. To any other land no
faithful Moslem is allowed to bear any loyalty.” Their Holy-
land is far off in Arabia. Their mythology and godrnen, idea.s
and heroes are not the children of this soil. Consequently,
their names and their outlook smack of foreign origin. Their
love is divided. Their love for India as their motherland is
but a handmaid to their love for their Holyland outside India.
“ The territorial patriots wanted the Hindus to cease to be
Hindus at least as a national and political unit. Some of them
actually gloried in disowming themselves as Hindus at all.
But the Moslems remained Moslems first and Moslems last
and Indians never ! ” says Savarkar.

After the fiasco of the Khilafat, the Muslims exploded the
Congress myth of territorial nationalism by migrating to
Moslem lands. Greece, Palestine and even Hungary and
Poland have thousands of Moslems amongst their nationals.
China has crores of Moslems. And still the country of the
Poles continues to be Poland, of the Grecians Greece. There
the Moslems did not dare to distort them, but are quite
content to distinguish themselves as Polish Moslems or
Grecian Moslems or Chinese Moslems. But the Indian
Moslems never identified their aspirations with the national
aspirations of Hindusthan. Gokhale had realised that the
‘ seventy millions of Mohammedans were more or less hostile to
the national aspirations,” * and warned Devi Sarojini Naidu that
the Hindu-Moslem Unity would never come in their lifetime.®
Sir Pherozeshah Mehta had warned the British Government

against the unjust Muslim claims.’ Lala Lajpat Rai had fully
realized the danger of the separatist tendencies of the Muslims
and Dr. Annie Besant had foretold h. her Future of Indian
Politics as early as 1922 that the p' m? -y allegiance of Muslims
was to Islamic countries, not to o ir lotherland,” and warned
in her memorable words : “ In tl i iking of an Independent
India, the menace of Muslim ruic las to be considered.- As
late as 1941, Dr. Ambedkar expr^'.-sed the same kind of grave
doubt about Moslem allegiance t( India when he said, “ Islam
can never allow a true Muslim to adopt India as his Mother-
land and regard a Hindu as his kith and kin.” ■'

So far as the Hindus are concerned, says Savarkar, there
can be no distinction nor conflict in the least between their
commimal and national duties, as the best interest of
Hindudom are simply identified with the best interests of
Hindusthan as a whole. The truer a Hindu is to himself as a
Hindu, holds Savarkar, he must inevitably grow a truer
national as well. The Hindus are the bedrock on which the
Indian Independent State could be built. He asserts : “ A

Hindu patriot worth the name can’t but be an Indian patriot
as well. To the Hindus Hindusthan being the Fatherland and
Holyland, the love they bear to Hindusthan is boundless. That
is why they predominate in the national struggle that is going
on for the overthrow of the British yoke. Even the buried
bones in the Andamans would assert this fact.” Savarkar
further declares that “ we Hindus must have a country of our
own in the solar system and must continue to flourish there as
Hindus — descendants of a mighty people.” Hence their
solidarity, unity and strength should be kept intact. So
Shuddhi for him has not only a religious, but also a political,
national and a secular meaning. If the population of the
Hindus dwindles and the strength of the other faiths out-
numbers them, there would be a serious threat to the building
of peace and prosperity, nay, to the very existence of
Hindusthan.

Savarkar beUeves in the resurrection of the Hindus, who
have stood by the graves of empires and civilizations that

SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES


prospered in other parts of the world. He believes that there
is some such virility and staying power inherent in the Hindu
race as find few parallels in the annals of the world. There-
fore, he observes, that amidst the terrible struggle for
existence, which is incessantly going on in (he creation,
survival of the fittest is the rule. The Hindus survived the
national cataclysms because they were found the fittest to
survive.


Justifiable Nationalism

To those who say that the concept of the Hindu Nation is
parochial, Savarkar asks whether or not the concept of an
Indian Nation itself is parochial in relation to the Human
State. “ Why are you an Indian patriot and not an Abyssinian
one, and go there and fight for their freedom ? Some
Englishmen born in this territory are and may continue to be
Indians. Can, therefore, the overlordship of these Anglo-
Indians be a Swaraj to the Hindus ? Aurangzeb and Tipu,
too, were hereditary Indians. Did that mean that the rule
of Aurangzeb or Tipu was a Swaraj to the Hindus ? No !
Although they were territorial Indians, they proved to be the
worst enemies of Hindudom, and therefore a Pratap, a Shivaji,
a Guru Govindsingh or the Peshwas had to fight against the
Muslim domination and establish a real Hindu Swaraj,” thus
argues Savarkar.

“ In fact, the Earth,” Savarkar observes, “ is our Motherland
and Humanity our nation. Nay, the Vedantist goes further
and claims this Universe for his country and all manifestations
from the stars to the stone his own self. O brothers, the
limits of the Universe — ^there the frontiers of my country lie,
says Tukaram. Why then take the Himalayas to cut us off
from the rest of mankind, and deem ourselves as a separate
nation as Indians and fight with every other country and the
English in particular who after all are our brothers-in-
humanity ! ” The fact, says Savarkar, is that all patriotism
is more or less parochial and communal and is responsible
for the dreadful wars throughout human history.

But according to Savarkar there is an acid test for
distinguishing a justifiable nationalism or communalism from



HINDU MANIFESTO OR SAVARKARISM 233

an unjust and harmful one. So long as, states he, a nation
or a community tries to defend the just and fundamental rights
of a particular nation or a people or a community against Ihe
unjust and overbearing aggression of other human aggregates
and does not infringe on the equal and just rights and liberties
of others, it cannot bo condemned or looked down upon simply
because the nation or community is a smaller aggregate in
itself. But when a nation or community treads upon the
rights of .sister nations or co iivunities, he continues, and
aggressively stands in the wr. o' forming larger associations
and aggregates of mankind, its nationalism or communalism
becomes condemnable from a human point of view.

nationalism, says Savarkar, when it is aggressive ia as
immoral in human relations as is communalism w’hen it tries
to suppress the equitable rights of other communities and tries
to usurp all to itself. But when Communalism is only
defensive, it is as justifiable and human as an equitable
nationalism itself. The Hindus, Savarkar reiterates, do not
aim at usurping what belongs to others. They do not want
any special privileges, but they will not allow themselves to
be exploited.


Muslims and Minorities

Savarkar was for Hindu-Muslim unity and contemplated a
non-seclarian State for India. He held that it w'as as suicidal
as ridiculous to borrow hostilities and combats of the past
only to fight them out into the present, because Shivaji and
Aurangzeb had done it.^ But he justified the past struggle
of the Rajputs, the Sikhs and the Mahrattas to overthrow the
Mogul rule as he considered, “ as long as the Muslims lived
in India in the capacity of alien rulers, so long, to be willing to
live with them as brothers was to acknowledge national
weakness.” ^ So he was never prepared to accept the Muslim
domination or their demand for vivisection of India. He
contemplated that kind of unity which would go to create an
Indian State in which all citizens irrespective of caste, creed,
race or religion were treated all alike on the principle of ‘ one


1 Savarkar, Foreword to Hindu-Pad-Padshahi.

2 Savarkar, The Indian War of Independence of 1857, p. 75.



234 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

rnan one vote.’ In this view Savarkar was not far away from
the realistic approach of Gokhale, Pherozeshah Mehta,
Dr. Annie Besant or Dr. Ambedkar. But Savarkar did not
want the majority to go on its knees to the recalcitrant
minority. Therefore, he considered that seeking unity on the
part of the majority was losing it. To those who believed that
the third party, i.e. the British Government, was the hindrance
to the Hindu-Muslim unity, he asked, “Who set Muhammad
Bin Quasim, Mahomed of Gazni and Aurangzeb to lay India
waste with a mad fanatic fury ? Were they the creations of
the third party, the Britishers ? ” He warned the Hindu-
Muslim unity-hankerers that the real question at the root of
the Muslim opposition, displeasure and problem was not a
word here or a song there. The Muslims cherished secret
designs to disintegrate the Indian State and to create a State
within a State or subvert the national State and m the end
wanted to brand the Fatherland of the Hindus and other
non-Muslim sections in Hindusthan with the stamp of
self-humiliation and Muslim domination. He, therefore,
denounced this attitude and declared to the non-Hindus and
especially to the Muslims : “ If you come, with you ; if you

don’t, without you and if you oppose, in spite of you, the
Hindus will continue to fight for their national freedom as
best as they can.”

Savarkar further explained his attitude towards the
minorities in general. The Parsees, he stated, amongst the
other minorities were by race, religion, language and culture
most akin to the Hindus. They had been loyal to India and
had made her their only home. They had produced some of
the best Indian patriots and revolutionaries like Dadabhai
Naoroji and Madame Cama. He, therefore, said that the
Parsees would be incorporated into the common Indian State
with perfect equal rights and trust.

The Christian minority, Savarkar observed, was civil, had
no extra-territorial political designs against India, was not
linguistically and culturally averse to the Hindus and therefore
could be politically assimilated with the Hindus. Only
conversion, he added, should be made voluntary and on a
legitimate basis.

As to the Jews in India, he said, they were too few and



HINDU MANIFESTO OR SAVARKARISM 235

had given no political or cultural troubles and were not in the
main a proselytizing people. They willed, he continued, to
be friendly towards the Hindus who had sheltered them when
homeless, and could be easily assimilated in a common Indian

^*^us the problem of minorities was not at all the problem
of all minorities, but the problem of only one minority— the
Muslim minority.

And so tar as tbe Muslim community was concerned,
Savarkar said, every equitable treatment which an Indian
citizen could claim on an equality of footing with others in
respect of language, religion and culture, could be given to
them, but they should be held as suspicious friends for at
least some years to come for their extra-territorial designs.

Nationalism and Humanism

Savarkar believes that nationali.sm is but an inevitable step
towards the goal of Humanity and Pan-Human State. Thirty
years ago he wrote that he believed in a universal State
embracing all mankind and where all men and women would
he citizens working for the fruits of the earth, the sun and the
land which constitute the real Motherland and Fatherland of
Man. In fact he said, the world was our country and humanity
was our religion and patriotism. In his youth he wrote that
history was to be studied to weld humanity into a World
Commonwealth. But while the process and struggle, he said,
was going on for welding humanity into a World Common-
wealth, the weak people had gone under and the fittest had
survived. “ Therefore,” he warned the Hindus, “ before you
make out a case for unity, you must make out a case for
survival as a national or a social human unit.” ’ This made
him devote all his energy to Hindu Nationalism as he believed
that Hindu consolidation was a step inevitable in the realiza-
tion of the ideal of a Human State or a World Common-
wealth. Savarkar stressed this point in a recent letter to Guy
A. Aldred, editor of The Word, Glasgow. He said : “ I hold
that although Mankind must march on through nationalism
and federalism, through larger and larger statal incorporations

' Savarkar, Foreword to Hindu-Pad-Padshahi.



236 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

to their ultimate political goal, yet t&e goal is not and cannot
be nationalism but Humanism, neither more nor less. The
ideal of all Political Science and Art must be a Human State.”
“ The Earth is our real Motherland, mankind our Nation and
a Human Government based on equality of rights and dutie.s
is or ought to be our ultimate political goal.” This was a
message sent by Savarkar to the World Fellowship Institution
at Conway, which had chosen him for presiding over their
Annual Session in 1944, which he could not do for reasons of
health.

Thus being a realist and rationalist Savarkar warned the
Hindus in these words ; “ As long as the law of evolution that
lays down the iron command ‘ that the weak and the cowards
are always the victims of the strong and the courageous ’ is too
pensistent and dangerously imminent to be categorically
denied by the law of righteousness whose mottos shine
brilliantly and beautifully — ^but as the stars in the heavens
do, — so long the banner of nationality will refuse to be
replaced by that of Universality.^ Savarkar declared in
unmistakable terms that as long as the whole world was red
in tooth and claw and the national and racial distinction so
.'Strong as to make men brutal, so long if India had to live at
all a life whether spiritual or political according to the light
of her soul, she must not lose the strength born of national
and racial cohesion.- Therefore, Savarkar again emphasizes :

“ As long as every other ‘ Ism ’ has not disowned its special
dogmas, whichever tend into dangerous war cries, so long no
cultural or national unit can afford to loosen the bonds,
especially those of a common name and a common banner that
are the mighty sources of organic cohesion and strength.”*
He substantiated his point by citing the failure of Buddhism.
Though a universal religion without any the least ulterior
end in view, it could not, Savarkar observed, eradicate the
seeds of animal passions or of political ambitions. He, there-
fore, asked the Hindus to be on their guard against the Mumbo
Jpmbo of Universalism and non-violence which crush the

1 Savarkar Hinduiva, p. 30.

2 Ibid., p. 67.



HINDU MANIFESTO OR SAVARKARISM 237

faculty even of resisting sin, crime and aggression, nay, kill
the very sense of wrong and the power of resistance.

Savarkar n ylfs the Hindus to take Universalism cautiously.

He observes : “ What was the use of a universal faith that
instead of soothing the ferociousness and brutal egoism oi the
nations only excited their lust by leaving India detencelesa
and unsuspecting?”* Nevertheless, describing the glory
and grandeur of Buddha, he .says: “But as it is. thou art
ours as truly as Sbri Rama or '^bri Krishna, or Shri Mahaveer
had been, and as thy words were but echoes of yearnings of
our sou\, t\vy vision^:, dreams oi our taco ; eveiv

so, i£ ever ibe law ot rigliteousuess rules triumplrant on ihls
our human plane, then thou wilt find that the land t\va\ cradled
thee, and the people that nursed thee, will have contributed
most to bring about the consummation if indeed the fact of
having contributed thee has not proved that much already.'” -
What heaps of books and lakhs of preachings on Buddlia
could not expound, Savai'kar did in a paragraph !

So from the point of nationalism, humanism and univer-
salism, Savarkar gives his immortal message to the Land of
Karmay the land of the Vedas, the land of Rama, Krishna,
Buddha, Mahaveer, Vikramaditya, Shalivahan, Pratap,
Shivaji, Guru Govindsingh, Banda, Dayananda, Vivekananda
and Tilak : “ Therefore, ye, O Hindus, consolidate and

strengthen Hindu nationality : not to give wanton offence to
any of our non-Hindu compatriots, in fact to any one in the
world but in just and urgent self-defence of our race and land ;
to render it impossible for others to betray her or to subject
her to unprovoked attacks by any of those ‘ Pan-isms ’ that
are struggling forth from continent to continent ! ’’ “ As long
as other communities in India or in the world,” Savarkar
concludes, “ are not respectively planning India first or
mankind first, but all are busy in organising offensive and
defensive alliances and combinations on entirely narrow racial
or religious or national basis, so long, O Hindus, strengthen if
you can those subtle bonds that like nerve-threads bind you
in One Organic Social Being. Those of you who in a suicidal
fit try to cut off the most vital of those ties and dare to disown
the name Hindu will find to their cost that in doing so they

have cut themselves off from the very source of our racial
Life and Strength.” *

“Thirty crores of people with India for their basis of
operation, for their Fatherland and for their Holyland, with
such a history behind them, bound together by ties of a
common blood and common culture, can dictate their terms
to the whole world. A day will come when mankind will
have to face the force. Equally certain it is that whenever
the Hindus come to hold such a position whence they could
dictate terms to the whole world — those terms cannot be very
different from the terms which the Gita dictates or the
Buddha lays down. A Hindu is most intensely so, when he
ceases to be a Hindu ; and with a Shankar claims the whole
earth for a Benares — Varanasi Medini — or with a Tukaram
explains ‘ my country ? Oh brothers, the limits of the
Universe — there the frontiers of my covmtry lie,' ” sings the
vedic soul of Savarkar.^

Relative Non-Violence and Absolute
Non-Violence

The peace and prosperity of mankind is the central aim of
Savarkarian philosophy. To Savarkar what is conducive and
whatever contributes to the human good is moral, justifiable,
desirable, and just. To it relative non-violence is a virtue
and absolute non-violence is not only sinful, but immoral.
Savarkar, therefore, hates the monomaniacal principal of
absolute non-violence. A lione.ss besmeared with a deer’s
blood suckling her cubs at her breast is his nature’s picture.
He believes that man could not have saved himself from
complete extinction had he not succeeded in adding strength of
artificial arms to his natural arms. He tells you that the lesson
is branded on every page of history down to the latest page
that nations which, other things equal, are superior in military
strength are bound to survive, flourish and dominate while
those which are militarily altogether weak are politically
subjected or cease to exist at all. Who will doubt this truth ?

HINDU MANIFESTO OR SAVARKARISM 239

In fact, says Dr. Dean Inge, history is to remain a dismal
oniugation of the verb ‘ to eat ' in the active and passive.
Hindu soul aims at equality not only between human beings,
u,t abo equality amongst all beings. Therefore HindusVban
nreached and practised that strained water be given for horses
InA even corn-throwing centres be opened in the oceans so
that big fishes should not swallow little ones. But while
Buddhism was at its meridian, the Huns and the Shaks came


down like an avalanche upon India and trampled under their
feet Hindu families, their thrones, and their Gods. Pointing this
to the Hindus, Savarkar tells them that the Holy land of
their love was devastated and sacked by hoards of barbarians,
so inferior to them in language, religion, philosophy, mercy
and all the soft and human attributes of man and God ; — ^but
superior to them in strength alone — strength that summed up
its creed, in two words — Fire and Sword ! In trying to kill
killing India got killed and at last found that palm leaves at
times are too fragile for steel. But during the days of
Vikramaditya and Shalivahan valour accomplished what
formulas had failed to do. Therefore, Savarkar concludes : “ We
denounce the doctrine of absolute non-violence not because we
are less saintly, but because we are more sensible ! ” The
truth of this doctrine was demonstrated later on in practice
by the protagonists of the doctrine of non-violence in the
measures adopted by them in Hyderabad, Kashmir and
elsewhere.

Savarkar is one with the greatest of world thinkers in this
view. The controversy between the cult of absolute
non-violence and the principle of relative non-violence is
age-long. All the saviours of humanity have supported the
principle of relative non-violence. In Hindusthan, Manu’s
immortal epigraphic command that an aggressor must be
killed instantly, stands out distinctly. The great Shakespeare
lays down that arms are fair when the intent of bearing them
is just. Thomas Paine denounced the Quaker cult during
the American War of Independence. “ I am thus for a
Quaker,” says Paine, “ that I would gladly agree with all the
world to lay aside the use of arms and settle matters by
negotiation, but unless the whole world wilb, the matter ends
and I take my musket and thank heaven He has put it in my



240 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

power. . . . We live not in a world of angels. The reign of
satan is not ended, neither can we expect to be defended by
miracles.” At another time he declai*es : “ Wherefore, if you
really preach from conscience and mean not to make
a political hobby-horse of your religion, convince the world
thereby proclaiming your doctrine to our enemies for they
likewise bear arms. . . . Preach repentance to your king and
warn him of eternal ruin ... ye would not spend your
invectives against the injured and insulted only, but like
faithful ministers, cry aloud and spare none.” ^ President
Masaryk asked Tolstoy, the Russian apo.stle of the doctrine of
absolute non-violence, why should a peace-loving man void
of evil intent be slain and not the man of evil purpose who
kills. SavarkiU' in his immortal work The Indiav War of
Independence of 1857, observes : “ When Humanity will reach
the goal of universal justice, of ultimate beatitude, when the
millennium preached by the incarnations, by the Messiahs,
and by religious preachers will be an accomplished fact on
earth, when the resignation taught by Christ in the glorious
words ‘ Whosoever shall smite thee on the right cheek, turn to
him the other also ’ will be impracticable — ^because, there will
be no one to hit on the right cheek, in such a divine age, if
anyone revolts, if anyone sheds a drop of blood, if anyone even
whispers the word revenge, then at once, the sinner by this
act, by his very utterance, would be eternally damned. For,
when truth reigns in every heart, revolt must be a heinous
sin. When everyone abhors killing, to shed a drop of blood
must be a sin.” -

Savarkar continues in his rational approach to this problem :
“ But so long as that divine age has not arrived, so long as
the highly auspicious end remains only in the lines of saintly
poets and in the prophecies of the divinely inspired, and so
long as, even to nxake that state of universal justice possible,
the human mind has to be busy eradicating sinful and
aggressive tendencies, so long, rebellion, bloodshed and
revenge cannot be purely sinful.”

Savarkar believes that revolt, bloodshed and revenge have

HINDU MANIFESTO OR SAVARKARISM 241

often been instruments created by nature to root out injustice
and introduce an era of justice. He proceeds : “ And when
justice uses these terrible means for her salvation, the blame
of it does not lie on justice but on the preceding cruel injustice,
the power and insolence of which called forth the means. We
do not hold the justice which gives the death sentence
responsible for bloodshed, but rather the injustice which is
taken to the gallows.'’ Savarkar brilliantly concludes :
“ Therefore the sword of Brutus is holy. Therefore, the
Waghanakh of Shivaji is sacred. Therefore, the bloodshed in
the revolutions in Italy is of fair fame. Therefore, the
beheading of Charles I is a just deed. Therefore, the arrow
of William Tell is divine. And the sin of brutality falls heavily
on the heads of those who committed the provoking
injustice.” ^

Savarkar also believes that had the world no fear of revolt,
bloodshed and revenge, the earth would have bent under the
devil-dance of unchecked robbery and oppression. “ If
oppression were to be secure,” he observes, ‘'from the fear
that Nature would, sooner or later, create the avenger of
temporary injustice, the whole world would have swarmed
today with Tsars and Robbers ! But because every Hiranya-
Kashipu has his Narasimha ; because every Dushshasana has
his Bheema ; because every evil-doer has his avenger, there is
still some hope in the heart of the world that injustice cannot
last.” -

But in India when Savarkar was passing his days in
internment the political leaders had made a hobby-horse of
the doctrine of non-violence and offered their advice to the
insulted, enslaved and the butchered Hindus, supporting
indirectly Nietzsche who believed that the resignation of
Christianity was meant for the defeated and the down-
trodden ! In no enslaved country humbled to dust, the
doctrine of absolute non-violence has ever been discussed in
so dry, dull, futile and longwinded a manner as has been done
on the advent of Gandhian leadership in India ! This futile
discussion and reiteration of this doctrine bankrupted the wit,
baffled the brains, benumbed the revolutionary fervour, and

1 Savarkar, The Indian War of Independence of 1857 y p. 274.

2 Ibid.

16



242 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

seduced the hearts of the Hindus, softening their limbs and
stiffening the bones of the enemies ! Leader after leader blew
hot and cold in the same breath while dealing with this
doctrine. Some clianged sides, abjui-ed their faith, revoked
their statements, and condenmed their former patriotism and
even previous life. Devi Sarojini Naidu, who sang of the
Gandhian doctrine in her later life, had shouted from the
Lucknow Session of the Indian National Congress in 1916 :
“ It may seem a kind of paradox that I should be asked to
raise my voice on behalf of the disinherited manhood of the
country, but it is suitable that I, who represent the other sex,
that is, the mothers of the men whom we wish to make men
and not emasculated machines, should raise a voice on behalf
of the future mothers of India to demand that the birth-right
of their sons should be given back to them, so that tomorrow’s
India may be once more worthy of its yesterday. . . . The
refusal of the privilege, that gifted privilege and inalienable
right to carry arms, is to insult the very core of their valiant
manhood ! ” '

Such was the realistic tone of politics of Tilak’s India. But
these very leaders and patriots like Sarojini Naidu became
parrots and perched on the cult of absolute non-violence
of Gandhism and made a paradox of their politics by thrusting
down the throats of youths the opiates of absolute non-violence
in season and out of season. The effect was tremendous and
terrible. For a time the revolutionary urge cooled down in
the country to a great extent, and people lost even the sense
of resisting crime and aggression and at last the emasculated
Hindu nation feU an easy prey to the organized and furious
Muslim violence, and was torn to pieces ! The lambs resolved
to lead a vegetable life, but the wolves were not concerned
with their pious resolution ! It was Savarkar alone who
raised his mighty voice against this suicidal doctrine and
applied most of his herculean energy to the task of warning
the leaders and the Hi|ndus against the impending holocaust
that was soon to overtake them. Savarkar’s was a peculiar
Maharashtrian approach. Even the great Maharashtrian
saint, Tukaram, sings in a fit of practical righteousness : “ Kill

• G. A. Nate^n & Co., Sarojini^s Speeches & WriHngSt p. 7B.



HINDU MANIFESTO OR SAVARKARISM 243

the scorpion, the despiser of the worship of God, if it enters
the shrine ; give tit for tat. No mercy to the wicked.”

Revolutions: Why and How

Savarkar’s thoughts on the how and why of a revolution are
noteworthy.

“ A revolution is evolution in leaps.”

“ Revolutions are not r. alated by fixed laws. They are
not accurately working rs d ines like clocks and watches.
They have their own way o. marching. They can only be
regulated by a general principle ; but they brusli away minor
rules by their very shock. Revolution has only one watch-
word — ‘ Dash on ! ’ All sorts of new and unthought of
circumstances might arise during its progress ; but one must
stop, one must overcome them and press forward.” *

“ There is no other life-killing poison to a revolution than
indecision. The sooner and the more sudden the spreading
of a revolution, the greater are its chances of success. If
delay is made after the first start and breathing time is given,
the enemy gets time to guard himself ; those who rise
prematurely lose confidence, when they see no one joining
them ; and a clever enemy, profiting by the past, puts obstacles
in the way of those who want to rise later. Therefore, to give
the enemy time between the first rising and the spreading of
a revolution is always harmful to the revolution.” “

“ The destruction of individuals, of society and of Kingdoms
is caused as much by anarchy as by foreign rule, as much by
the absence of any bond as the presence of cruel bonds. If
any revolution forgets this sociological truth it generally kiUs
itseK in the end. . . . That revolution which destroys injustice
and oppression is holy. But when a revolution roots out one
kind of injustice and oppression and plants, at the same
moment, the seeds of another kind, it becomes at once unholy
and the seeds of destruction accompanying that sin soon put
an end to its life. . . . The moment the foreign power is
destroyed, in order to guard the country from the evils of
anarchy, a constitution liked by the majority of the people

1 Savarkar, The Indian War of Independence of 1857, p. 159.

2/Wd., p. 128.



244 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

should be at once established and that constitution should be
obeyed with reverence by all. In short, the rule should be
revolution outside and constitution within, chaos outside and
cosmos within, sword outside and law within.” '

On Foreign Policy

Savarkarism advocates that Indian foreign policy should
hinge on a very practical stand, on the principle of serving,
safeguarding and promoting the national self-interest,
Savarkar avers that it should not depend on isms. The sound
principle, he observes, in politics lays it down that no form
of Government or political ‘ ism ’ is absolutely good or bad
under all circumstances to all people alike. He, therefore,
thinks it inadvisable to dictate to Germany, Japan, Italy or
Russia to choose a particular form of Government. Democracy
itself demands that the will of the people must prevail in
choosing their own Government. Naturally he holds that all
those nations that are friendly or likely to be helpful to the
Hindu Nation would be friends and allies of Hindusthan. To
him, no academic and empty slogans of Democracy or Nazism
or Fascism can be the guiding principle to India’s foreign
policy. He says we should never hate or love Fascists or
Bolshevists or Democrats simply on the ground of any
theoretical or bookish reasons. There was no reason, he said,
to suppose that Hitler was a human monster because he passed
off as a Nazi or Churchill was a demi-God because he
called himself a democrat. Savarkar wants Hindusthan to
maintain a policy of neutrality towards all nations in the world
in respect of their internal affairs or mutual relations with
each other.

All nations look first to their own security and prosperity
while dealing with international problems. They make or
unmake pacts with this end alone in view. Let alone the
history of pacts and treaties which Britain made with Indian
Princes, what great nations have stood by their pledges ? By
an agreement the U.S.A. was pledged to protect Korea. In
1905 Japan swallowed Korea and U.S.A. was the first nation
to recognize the Korean conquest ! France and Columbia

^ Savarkar, The Indian War of Independence of J857, pp. 348*49.



HINDU MANIFESTO OR SAVARKARISM 245

know how U.S.A. stood by the pledges given and agreements
made wi.h them. The world knows the fate of Nine-Party
Treaty of Brussels to stop Japanese Aggression. They orated
and adjourned. The history of the Treaty of Rapallo, the
Treaty of Berlin, the Treaty of 1933 and the dramatic end of
the Non-Aggression Pact of 1939 between Germany and
Russia is stunning and shocking. Why, in the last week of
December 1948. President Truman declared that contracts
were not sacred to Soviv' Government. Savai'kar believes
that a powerful centralised -tate of Hindusthan will contribute
effectively to build up an endurable and enduring peace for
the world because her role is neither selfish nor aggressive.

Economic Problem

As regards the economic problem, Savarkar’s approach is
at once rationalistic and nationalistic. Savarkar is not an
orthodox Hindu, so also he is not a believer in mechanical and
orthodox socialism. He is not one with Manu or Marx.
According to him man has got a stomach, but stomach is not
the man. The Cliristian maxim that man does not live by
bread alone appeals to him. Savarkarism believes in the
spiritual truth that racial, cultural, national and several other
aspects also go to constitute the human nature. Therefore,
he believes that the attempt to interpret all human history
and human activities in economical terms alone is altogether
one-sided and amounts to maintaining that man has no other
urge in him to live but hunger.

Savarkarian outlook on life holds that besides hunger — the
problem of bread — ^man has other appetites as fundamental as
that, sensual, intellectual, sentimental, some national, some
acquired, some personal, some social, and his Being is
complex ; so also is his history. Savarkarism considers that
the solution suggested to the effect that the economical
community of interests provides the only and the best solvent
of all religious, racial, national and other antipathies that
divide mankind in the world is as superficial as simple. The
fact that in Europe, Savarkar asserts, the very races and
nations wherein the prophets of this school arose and preached
their doctrines and where giant efforts were made to



246 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

revolutionize all human institutions and recast them into this
economical mould alone ; religious, racial and national
differences have been assuming formidable proportions and
have been persisting to assert themselves in Germany, Italy,
France, Poland, England, Spain, etc. in spite of centuries of
the most intense propaganda to insist on an economical
community of interest, is enough to prove that you cannot
altogether eliminate all religious, racial or national factors
at a stroke, at a thought ! ^

Those who advance the easy argument ‘ If but you persuade
all to unite on the economic plane and to forget every other
superstitious difference as the racial, cultural, etc. ’ forget
themselves, argues Savarkar, that the very ‘ but ’ in their
argument rebuts the practical utility at any rate, apart from
its theoretical soundness. Consequently he warns the Hindus
that they must in no case delude themselves with the belief
that the economic programme alone will ever suffice to solve
all cultural, racial and national dangers that threaten them
throughout India. Taking into consideration the special
circumstances obtaining in India and the stage of social
progress, he thinks, the only school of economics which will
suit our requirements in the immediate future is the school of
Nationalistic economy and styles his economic policy as the
national co-ordination of class interests. This immediate
programme of national co-ordination of class interests is being
practised in free India in foto by leaders like Pandit Nehru
who were extolled to the skies for many years in the past as
* super ’ Socialists. What Savarkar defined in 1939, Pandit
  Nehru and others realized in 1948 !

Savarkar’s India

In short, under the set of circumstances obtaining in India
and in the context of the present world set-up, the following
ideal is to be realized in the immediate future.

Savarkar’s Presidential Addresses at Karnavati, Nagpur,
Calcutta and Madura.



HINDU MANIFESTO OR SAVARKARISM 247


(a) In Savarkar's India all citizens would have equal rights
and obligations irrespective of caste, creed, race or
religion provided they avow and owe an exclusive and
devoted allegiance to the State.

(b) All minorities would be given effective safeguards to
protect their language, religion, culture, etc. but none
of them would be allowed to create a State within a
State or to encroach upon the legitimate rights of the
majority.

(c) The fundamental rights of freedom of speech, freedom
of conscience, of worship, of association, etc. would be
enjoyed by all citizens alike ; whatever restrictions
would be imposed on them in the interest of the public
peace and order or national emergency would not be
based on any religious or racial considerations alone
but common national grounds.

(d) One man one vote would be the general rule irrespec-
tive of caste, creed, race, or religion.

(e) There would be joint electorates.

(f) Services would go by merit alone.

(g) Primary Education will be free and compulsory.

(h) Every minority would have separate schools to
train their children in their own tongue ; their religious
and cultural institutions would receive Government
help also for these, but always in proportion to the taxes
they pay into the common exchequer.

(i) The residuary powers would be vested in the Central
Government.

(j) Nagari would be the national script, Hindi, the Lingua
Franca and Sanskrit, the Devabhasha of India.

n

(1) People would first of all welcome the machine age. The
handicrafts would, of course, have their place and
encouragement. But national production would be on
the biggest possible machine scale.



248 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

(2) As the peasantry and the working classes form literally
the chief source of national wealth, health, and strength,
every effort would be made to reinvigorate them and
the villages which are their cradle. Peasants and
labourers would be enabled to have their share
in the distribution of wealth to such an extent as
would enable them not only to live with a bare margin
of existence, but with the average scale of a comfortable
life free from wants. Nevertheless, it would be
remembered that they being a part and parcel of the
nation as a whole, would share common obligations and
re.sponsibilities and therefore would only receive their
share in such a way as would be consistent with the
general development and security of national industry,
manufacture and wealth in general.

(3) As the national capital is under the present circum-
stances mainly individual and indispensable for the
development of National Industries and Manufactures,
it would also receive due encouragement and
recompense.

(4) The interests of both the capital and labour would bo
sub-ordinafed to the requirements of the nation as a
whole.

(5) If an industry is flourishing, the profits would be shared
in a large portion by the labourers. But on the contrary,
if it is a losing concern, not only the capitalist, but to a
certain extent even the labourers would have to remain
satisfied with diminishing returns so that the National
Industry as such would not altogether be undermined
by the over -bearing attitude of the selfish class interests
of either the capitalists or the workers.

(6) Every step would be taken by the State to protect
national industries against foreign competition.

(7) The key industries or manufactures and such other
items would be altogether nationalised if the National
Government could afford to do so and could conduct
them more efficiently than private enterprise.

(8) The same principle would apply to agriculture. Govern-
ment would take over the land and introduce State



HINDU MANIFESTO OR SAVARKARISM 249

culti'' ation if it could serve to train up the peasant
class as a whole with the use of big machines and would
cultivate on a large and scientific scale.

(9) All strikes and lockouts which are obviously meant or
inevitably tend to undermine and cripple National
Industries or production in general or are calculated to
weaken the economic strength of the nation as a whole
would be referred to State arbitration and settled or in
serious cases quelled

(10) Private property would be in general held inviolate. In
no ease there would be on the part of the State any
expropriation of such properly without reasonable
recompense.

Thus Savarkar's India would be a democratic State in
which the countrymen belonging to dilTcrent religions, sects
or races would be treated with ijerfect equality and none
would be allowed to dominate others or would be deprived
of his just and equal rights of free citizenship, so long as
every one discharges the common obligation which one owes
to the State as a whole.

Hindusthan, the Motherland and Holyland of the Hindus,
from the Indus to the Seas would be an organic undivided
State. The appellation of this Bhai'at Bhooini would remain
as Bharat or Hindusthan.

In Savarkar’s India none would dare convert Hindus by
fraud or force. Everywhere the Indians would be respected
as citizens of a great nation. In that India relative non-violence
would be regarded as virtuous.

The Hindus would be a castelcss society, a consolidated,
modernised and up-to-date nation. Their marriage customs
would be secularised and voluntary inter-caste marriages
would be freely performed. Hindu corpses would be burnt
with electricity.

In Savarkar’s India science would lead all material progress
and things, and would annihilate superstitions There would
be a total liquidation of landlordism. All the land would
belong to the State by and by. All key industries would be
nationalized. Agriculture would be mechanized. India would



250 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

be self-sufficient in respect of food, clothes, shelter, and
defence.

Savarkar’s India would have unbounded faith in a World
Commonwealth as his political philosophy conceives that the
Eai’th is the Common Motherland and Humanism the
patriotism of man, but his India would not go under during
the process which leads to the welding of Humanity into a
World Commonwealth. In international politics Savarkar’s
India would help to build world peace and prosperity.
