Hindus have become a minority in yet another state of India. They are 49% here (includes Sanmahis). In 1901, they were 96%. This is the story of decimation of Hindus in Manipur.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 1901 the proportion of Hindus + Sanmahis (natural dharmic religion of Manipur) constituted more than 96% of the population of Manipur with both the valley and hills having an overwhelming majority of non-Christians and non-Muslims.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In India’s north-eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, they number in the low thousands but find themselves in conflict with authorities fighting for living space.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;India’s state-sponsored policy to secure its border area with Myanmar by transporting former military men meant that the Yobin had to vacate their homes and move in to the Namdapha National Park, putting them in conflict with the tiger population.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

They were largely settled by the Indian army in 1960s, although some had been coming to Assam for work even as early as 1918. However, they claim the place is called Dawodi and that the army cleansed them out. They have come under fire for allegations of encroachment on the Namdapha wildlife sanctuary.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
