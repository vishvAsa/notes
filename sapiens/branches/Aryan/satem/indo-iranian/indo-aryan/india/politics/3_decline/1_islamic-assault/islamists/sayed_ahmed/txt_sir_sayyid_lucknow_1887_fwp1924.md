[TABLE]

NOTE in the Urdu edition: "Sir Sayyid gave this lecture orally; there
were no notes or memoranda in Sir Sayyid's hands concerning the lecture.
Thus he went on speaking with extreme fluency. So that this valuable,
important, and historical lecture \[\[28\]\] would have been lost, if
Munshi 'Aziz ud-Din Ahmad, Tahsildar of Mirzapur, with extreme swiftness
and dexterity had not written along with him as he was speaking. Munshi
Sahib took great care, and having written out the lecture clearly he
also showed it to Sir Sayyid."
