<p>CHAPTER XII</p>
<p>NATIONAL FRUSTRATION</p>
<p>III<br>
[The necessary national political loyalty is not present among
Muslims]</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this difference in their ultimate destiny, an
attempt is made to force the Hindus and Muslims to live in one country,
as one people, bound by the political ties of a single constitution.
Assuming that this is done and that the Muslims are somehow manoeuvred
into it, what guarantee is there that the constitution will not break
down ?</p>
<p>The successful working of a Parliamentary Government assumes the
existence of certain conditions. It is only when these conditions exist
that Parliamentary Government can take roots. One such condition was
pointed out by the late Lord Balfour when in 1925 he had an occasion to
discuss the political future of the Arab peoples in conversation with
his niece Blanche Dugdale.<br>
In the course of this conversation he said**<a href="#n01">/1/</a>** :—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It is partly the fault of the British nation—and of the Americans; we
can&rsquo;t exonerate them from blame either—that this idea of
&lsquo;representative government&rsquo; has got into the heads of nations who
haven&rsquo;t the smallest notion of what its basis must be. It&rsquo;s difficult
to explain, and the Angio-Saxon races are bad at exposition. Moreover
we know it so well ourselves that it does not strike us as necessary
to explain it. I doubt if you would find it written in any book on the
British Constitution that the whole essence of British Parliamentary
Government lies in the intention to make the thing work. We take that
for granted. We have spent hundreds of years in elaborating a system
that rests on that alone. It is so deep in us that we have lost sight
of it. But it is not so obvious to others. These peoples—Indians,
Egyptians, and so on—study our learning. They read our history, our
philosophy, and politics. They learn about our parliamentary methods
of obstruction, but nobody explains to them that when it comes to the
point, all our parliamentary parties are determined that the machinery
shan&rsquo;t stop. &lsquo;The king&rsquo;s government must go on&rsquo; as the Duke of
Wellington said. But their idea is that the function of opposition is
to stop the machine. Nothing easier, of course, but hopeless.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Asked why the opposition in England does not go to the length of
stopping the machine, he said:—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Our whole political machinery presupposes a people. . .
.fundamentally at one.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Laski has well summarized these observations of Balfour on the
condition necessary for the successful working of Parliamentary
Government when he says**<a href="#n02">/2/</a>**:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The strength of Parliamentary Government is exactly measured by the
unity of political parties upon its fundamental objects.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Having stated the condition necessary for the successful working of
the machinery of representative government, it will be well to examine
whether these conditions are present in India.</p>
<p>How far can we say that there is an intention in the Hindus and the
Muslims to make representative government work? To prove the futility
and unworkability of representative and responsible government, it is
enough even if one of the two parties shows an intention to stop the
machinery of government. If such an intention is enough, then it does
not matter much whether it is found in the Hindus or in the Muslims. The
Muslims being more outspoken than the Hindus, one gets to know their
mind more than one gets to know the mind of the Hindus. How the Muslim
mind will work and by what factors it is likely to be swayed will be
clear if the fundamental tenets of Islam which dominate Muslim politics
and the views expressed by prominent Muslims bearing on Muslim attitude
towards an Indian Government are taken into consideration. Certain of
such religious tenets of Islam and the views of some of the Muslim
leaders are given below, to enable all those who are capable of looking
at things dispassionately to judge for themselves whether the condition
postulated by Balfour can be said to exist in India.</p>
<p>Among the tenets one that calls for notice is the tenet of Islam
which says that in a country which is not under Muslim rule, wherever
there is a conflict between Muslim law and the law of the land, the
former must prevail over the latter, and a Muslim will be justified in
obeying the Muslim law and defying the law of the land.</p>
<p>What the duty of the Musalmans is in such cases was well pointed out
by Maulana Mahomed Ali in the course of his statement made in 1921
before the Committing Magistrate of Karachi in answer to the charges for
which he was prosecuted by the Government. The prosecution arose out of
a resolution passed at the session of the All-India Khilafat Conference
held in Karachi on 8th July 1921, at which Mr. Mahomed Ali presided and
introduced the resolution in question.</p>
<p>The resolution was as follows :—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;This meeting clearly proclaims that it is in every way religiously
unlawful for a Musalman at the present moment to continue in the
British Army, or to enter the Army, or to induce others to join the
Army. And it is the duly of all Musalmans in general and of the Ulemas
in particular to see that these religious commandments are brought
home to every Musalman in the Army.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Along with Maulana Mahomed Ali six other persons**<a href="#n03">/3/</a>** were
prosecuted under Section 120-B read with Section 131, I. P. C., and
under Section 505 read with Section 114 and Section 505 read with
Section 117, I. P. C., Maulana Mahomed Ali in justification of his plea
of not guilty, said**<a href="#n04">/4/</a>**:—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;After all what is the meaning of this precious prosecution. By whose
convictions are we to be guided, we the Musalmans and the Hindus of
India? Speaking as a Musalman, if I am supposed to err from the right
path, the only way to convince me of my error is to refer me to the
Holy Koran or to the authentic traditions of the last Prophet—on whom
be peace and God&rsquo;s benediction—or the religious pronouncements of
recognized Muslim divines, past and present, which purport to be based
on these two original sources of Islamic authority demands from me in
the present circumstances, the precise action for which a Government,
that does not like to be called satanic, is prosecuting me to-day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that which I neglect, becomes by my neglect a deadly sin, and is
yet a crime when I do not neglect it, how am I to consider myself safe
in this country?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must either be a sinner or a criminal. . . .Islam recognizes one
sovereignty alone, the sovereignty of God, which is supreme and
unconditional, indivisible and inalienable. . . .</p>
<p>* * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only allegiance a Musalman, whether civilian or soldier, whether
living under a Muslim or under a non-Muslim administration, is
commanded by the Koran to acknowledge is his allegiance to God, to his
Prophet and to those in authority from among the Musalmans chief among
the last mentioned being of course that Prophet&rsquo;s successor or
commander of the faithful. . . .This doctrine of unity is not a
mathematical formula elaborated by abstruse thinkers but a work-a-day
belief of every Musalman learned or unlettered. . . .Musalmans have
before this also and elsewhere too, lived in peaceful subjection to
non-Muslim administrations. But the unalterable rule is and has always
been that as Musalmans they can obey only such laws and orders issued
by their secular rulers as do not involve disobedience to the
commandments of God who in the expressive language of the Holy Koran
is the all-ruling ruler.&rsquo; These very clear and rigidly definite
limits of obedience are not laid down with regard to the authority of
non-Muslim administration only. On the contrary they are of universal
application and can neither be enlarged nor reduced in any case.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>This must make anyone wishing for a stable government very
apprehensive. But this is nothing to the Muslim tenets which prescribe
when a country is a motherland to the Muslim and when it is not.</p>
<p>According to Muslim Canon Law the world is divided into two camps,
Dar-ul-lslam (abode of Islam), and Dar-ul-Harb (abode of war). A country
is Dar-ul-lslam when it is ruled by Muslims. A country is Dar-ul-Harb
when Muslims only reside in it but are not rulers of it. That being the
Canon Law of the Muslims, India cannot be the common motherland of the
Hindus and the Musalmans. It can be the land of the Musalmans—but it
cannot be the land of the &lsquo;Hindus and the Musalmans living as equals.&rsquo;
Further, it can be the land of the Musalmans only when it is governed by
the Muslims. The moment the land becomes subject to the authority of a
non-Muslim power, it ceases to be the land of the Muslims. Instead of
being Dar-ul-lslam it becomes Dar-ul-Harb.</p>
<p>It must not be supposed that this view is only of academic interest.
For it is capable of becoming an active force capable of influencing the
conduct of the Muslims. It did greatly influence the conduct of the
Muslims when the British occupied India. The British occupation raised
no qualms in the minds of the Hindus. But so far as the Muslims were
concerned, it at once raised the question whether India was any longer a
suitable place of residence for Muslims. A discussion was started in the
Muslim community, which Dr. Titus says lasted for half a century, as to
whether India was Dar-ul-Harb or Dar-ul-lslam. Some of the more zealous
elements, under the leadership of Sayyed Ahmad, actually did declare a
holy war, preached the necessity of emigration (<em>Hijrat</em>) to lands under
Muslim rule, and carried their agitation all over India.</p>
<p>It took all ingenuity of Sir Sayyed Ahmad, the founder of the
Aligarh movement, to persuade the Indian Musalmans not to regard India
under the British as Dar-ul-Harb merely because it was not under Muslim
rule. He urged upon the Muslims to regard it as Dar-ul-lslam, because
the Muslims were perfectly free to exercise all the essential rites and
ceremonies of their religion. The movement for Hijrat for the time being
died down. But the doctrine that India was Dar-ul-Harb had not been
given up. It was again preached by Muslim patriots during 1920-21, when
the Khilafat agitation was going on. The agitation was not without
response from the Muslim masses, and there was a goodly number of
Muslims who not only showed themselves ready to act in accordance with
the Muslim Canon Law but actually abandoned their homes in India and
crossed over to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>It might also be mentioned that <em>Hijrat</em> is not the only way of
escape to Muslims who find themselves in a Dar-ul-Harb. There is another
injunction of Muslim Canon Law called <em>Jihad</em> (crusade) by which it
becomes &ldquo;incumbent on a Muslim ruler to extend the rule of Islam until
the whole world shall have been brought under its sway. The world, being
divided into two camps, Dar-ul-lslam (abode of Islam), Dar-ul-Harb
(abode of war), all countries come under one category or the other.
Technically, it is the duty of the Muslim ruler, who is capable of doing
so, to transform Dar-ul-Harb into Dar-ul-lslam.&rdquo; And just as there are
instances of the Muslims in India resorting to <em>Hijrat</em>, there are
instances showing that they have not hesitated to proclaim <em>Jihad</em>. The
curious may examine the history of the Mutiny of 1857; and if he does,
he will find that, in part, at any rate, it was really a <em>Jihad</em>
proclaimed by the Muslims against the British, and that the Mutiny so
far as the Muslims were concerned was a recrudescence of revolt which
had been fostered by Sayyed Ahmad who preached to the Musalmans for
several decades that owing to the occupation of India by the British the
country had become a Dar-ul-Harb. The Mutiny was an attempt by the
Muslims to reconvert India into a Dar-ul-lslam. A more recent instance
was the invasion of India by Afghanistan in 1919. It was engineered by
the Musalmans of India who, led by the Khilafatists&rsquo; antipathy to the
British Government, sought the assistance of Afghanistan to emancipate
India.<strong><a href="#n05">/5/</a></strong> Whether the invasion would have resulted in the
emancipation of India or whether it would have resulted in its
subjugation, it is not possible to say, because the invasion failed to
take effect. Apart from this, the fact remains that India, if not
exclusively under Muslim rule, is a Dar-ul-Harb, and the Musalmans
according to the tenets of Islam are justified in proclaiming a <em>Jihad</em>.</p>
<p>Not only can they proclaim <em>Jihad,</em> but they can call the aid of a
foreign Muslim power to make <em>Jihad</em> a success, or if the foreign Muslim
power intends to proclaim a <em>Jihad</em>, help that power in making its
endeavour a success. This was clearly explained by Mr. Mahomed Ali in
his address to the Jury in the Sessions Court. Mr. Mahomed Ali said:—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;But since the Government is apparently uninformed about the manner in
which our Faith colours and is meant to colour all our actions,
including those which, for the sake of convenience, are generally
characterised as mundane, one thing must be made clear, and it is
this: Islam does not permit the believer to pronounce an adverse
judgement against another believer without more convincing proof; and
we could not, of course, fight against our Muslim brothers without
making sure that they were guilty of wanton aggression, and did not
take up arms in defence of their faith.&rdquo; (This was in relation to the
war that was going on between the British and the Afghans in 1919.)
&ldquo;Now our position is this. Without better proof of the Amir&rsquo;s malice
or madness we certainly do not want Indian soldiers, including the
Musalmans, and particularly with our own encouragement and assistance,
to attack Afghanistan and effectively occupy if first, and then be a
prey to more perplexity and perturbation afterwards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if on the contrary His Majesty the Amir has no quarrel with India
and her people and if his motive must be attributed, as the Secretary
of State has publicly said, to the unrest which exists throughout the
Mahomedan world, an unrest with which he openly professed to be in
cordial sympathy, that is to say, if impelled by the same religious
motive that has forced Muslims to contemplate <em>Hijrat</em>, the
alternative of the weak, which is all that is within our restricted
means. His Majesty has been forced to contemplate <em>Jihad</em>, the
alternative of those comparatively stronger which he may have found
within his means; if he has taken up the challenge of those who
believed in force and yet more force, and he intends to try
conclusions with those who require Musalmans to wage war against the
Khilafat and those engaged in <em>Jihad</em>; who are in wrongful occupation
of the Jazirut-ul-Arab and the holy places; who aim at the weakening
of Islam; discriminate against it, and deny to us full freedom to
advocate its cause; then the clear law of Islam requires that in the
first place, in no case whatever should a Musalman render anyone any
assistance against him; and in the next place if the <em>Jihad</em>
approaches my region every Musalman in that region must join the
Mujahidin and assist them to the best of his or her power.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such is the clear and undisputed law of Islam; and we had explained
this to the Committee investigating our case when it had put to us a
question about the religious duty of a Muslim subject of a non-Muslim
power when <em>Jihad</em> had been declared against it, long before there was
any notion of trouble on the Frontiers, and when the late Amir was
still alive.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>A third tenet which calls for notice as being relevant to the issue
is that Islam does not recognize territorial affinities. Its affinities
are social and religious and therefore extraterritorial. Here again
Maulana Mahomed Ali will be the best witness. When he was committed to
the Sessions Court in Karachi Mr. Mahomed Ali, addressing the Jury,
said:—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;One thing has to be made clear as we have since discovered that the
doctrine to which we shall now advert is not so generally known in
non-Muslim and particularly in official circles as it ought to be. A
Musalman&rsquo;s faith does not consist merely in believing in a set of
doctrines and living up to that belief himself; he must also exert him
self to the fullest extent of his power, of course without resort to
any compulsion, to the end that others also conform to the prescribed
belief and practices. This is spoken of in the Holy Koran as
<em>Amribilmaroof</em> and <em>Nahi anilmunkar</em>, and certain distinct chapters
of the Holy Prophet&rsquo;s traditions relate to this essential doctrine of
Islam. A Musalman cannot say: &lsquo;I am not my brother&rsquo;s keeper,&rsquo; for in a
sense he is and his own salvation cannot be assured to him unless he
exhorts others also to do good and dehorts them against doing evil. If
therefore any Musalman is being compelled to wage war against the
Mujahid of Islam, he must not only be a conscientious objector
himself, but must, if he values his own salvation, persuade his
brothers also at whatever risk to himself to take similar objection.
Then and not until then, can he hope for salvation. This is our belief
as well as the belief of every other Musalman and in our humble way we
seek to live up to it; and if we are denied freedom to inculcate this
doctrine, we must conclude that the land, where this freedom does not
exist, is not safe for Islam.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the basis of Pan-Islamism. It is this which leads every
Musalman in India to say that he is a Muslim first and Indian
afterwards. It is this sentiment which explains why the Indian Muslim
has taken so small a part in the advancement of India but has spent
himself to exhaustion**<a href="#n06">/6/</a>** by taking up the cause of Muslim
countries and why Muslim countries occupy the first place and India
occupies a second place in his thoughts. His Highness the Aga Khan
justifies it by saying**<a href="#n07">/7/</a>**:—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;This is a right and legitimate Pan-Islamism to which every sincere
and believing Mahomedan belongs—that is, the theory of the spiritual
brotherhood and unity of the children of the Prophet. It is a deep,
perennial element in that Perso-Arabian culture, that great family of
civilization to which we gave the name Islamic in the first chapter.
It connotes charity and good-will towards fellow-believers everywhere
from China to Morocco, from the Volga to Singapore. It means an
abiding interest in the literature of Islam, in her beautiful arts, in
her lovely architecture, in her entrancing poetry. It also means a
true reformation—a return to the early and pure simplicity of the
faith, to its preaching by persuasion and argument, to the
manifestation of a spiritual power in individual lives, to beneficent
activity of mankind. The natural and worthy spiritual movement makes
not only the Master and His teaching but also His children of all
climes an object of affection to the Turk or the Afghan, to the Indian
or the Egyptian. A famine or a desolating fire in the Muslim quarters
of Kashgar or Sarajevo would immediately draw the sympathy and
material assistance of the Mahomedan of Delhi or Cairo. The real
spiritual and cultural unity of Islam must ever grow, for to the
follower of the Prophet it is the foundation of the life of the soul.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>If this spiritual Pan-lslamism seeks to issue forth in political
Pan-lslamism, it cannot be said to be unnatural. It is perhaps that
feeling which was in the mind of the Aga Khan when he
said**<a href="#n08">/8/</a>**:—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It is for the Indian patriot to recognise that Persia, Afghanistan
and possibly Arabia must sooner or later come within the orbit of some
Continental Power—such as Germany, or what may grow out of the break
up of Russia—or must throw in their lot with that of the Indian
Empire, with which they have so much more genuine affinity. The world
forces that move small States into closer contact with powerful
neighbours, though so far most visible in Europe, will inevitably make
themselves felt in Asia. Unless she is willing to accept the prospect
of having powerful and possibly inimical neighbours to watch, and the
heavy military burdens thereby entailed, India cannot afford to
neglect to draw her Mahomedan neighbour States to herself by the ties
of mutual interest and goodwill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a word, the path of beneficent and growing union must be based on
a federal India, with every member exercising her individual rights,
her historic peculiarities and natural interests, yet protected by a
common defensive system and customs union from external danger and
economic exploitation by stronger forces. Such a federal India would
promptly bring Ceylon to the bosom of her natural mother, and the
further developments we have indicated would follow. We can build a
great South Asiatic Federation by now laying the foundations wide and
deep on justice, on liberty, and on recognition for every race, every
religion, and every historical entity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sincere policy of assisting both Persia and Afghanistan in the
onward march which modem conditions demand, will raise two natural
ramparts for India in the north-west that neither German nor Slav,
Turk nor Mongol, can ever hope to destroy. They will be drawn of their
own accord towards the Power which provides the object lesson of a
healthy form of federalism in India, with real autonomy for each
province, with the internal freedom of principalities assured, with a
revived and liberalised kingdom of Hyderabad, including the Berars,
under the Nizam. They would see in India freedom and order, autonomy
and yet Imperial union, and would appreciate for themselves the
advantages of a confederation assuring the continuance of internal
self-government buttressed by goodwill, the immense and unlimited
strength of that great Empire on which the sun never sets. The British
position of Mesopotamia and Arabia also, whatever its nominal form may
be, would be infinitely strengthened by the policy I have advocated.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>The South Asiatic Federation was more for the good of the Muslim
countries such as Arabia, Mesopotamia and Afghanistan than for the good
of India.<strong><a href="#n09">/9/</a></strong> This shows how very naturally the thoughts of
Indian Musalmansare occupied by considerations of Muslim countries other
than those of India.</p>
<p>Government is based on obedience to authority. But those who are
eager to establish self-government of Hindus and Muslims do not seem to
have stopped to inquire on what such obedience depends, and how far such
obedience would be forthcoming in the usual course and in moments of
crisis. This is a very important question. For, if obedience fails,
self-government means working together and not working under. That may
be so in an ideal sense. But in practical and work-a-day world, if the
elements brought under one representative government are
disproportionate in numbers, the minor section will have to work under
the major section; and whether it works under the major section or not
will depend upon how far it is disposed to obey the authority of the
government carried on by the major section. So important is this factor
in the success of self-government that Balfour may be said to have
spoken only part of the truth when he made its success dependent upon
parties being fundamentally at one. He failed to note that willingness
to obey the authority of Government is a factor equally necessary for
the success of any scheme of self-government.</p>
<p>The importance of this second condition, the existence of which is
necessary for a successful working of parliamentary government, has been
discussed by**<a href="#n10">/10/</a>** James Bryce. While dealing with the basis
of political cohesion, Bryce points out that while force may have done
much to build up States, force is only one among many factors and not
the most important. In creating, moulding, expanding and knitting
together political communities what is more important than force is
obedience. This willingness to obey and comply with the sanctions of a
government depends upon certain psychological attributes of the
individual citizens and groups. According to Bryc,e the attitudes which
produce obedience are indolence, deference, sympathy, fear and reason.
All are not of the same value. Indeed they are relative in their
importance as causes producing a disposition to obey. As formulated by
Bryce, in the sum total of obedience the percentage due to fear and to
reason respectively is much less than that due to indolence, and less
also than that due to deference or sympathy. According to this view
deference and sympathy are, therefore, the two most powerful factors
which predispose a people to obey the authority of its government.</p>
<p>Willingness to render obedience to the authority of the government
is as essential for the stability of government as the unity of
political parties on the fundamentals of the state. It is impossible for
any sane person to question the importance of obedience in the
maintenance of the state. To believe in civil disobedience is to believe
in anarchy.</p>
<p>How far will Muslims obey the authority of a government manned and
controlled by the Hindus? The answer to this question need not call for
much inquiry. To the Muslims a Hindu is a Kaffir.<strong><a href="#n11">/11/</a></strong> A
Kaffir is not worthy of respect. He is low-born and without status. That
is why a country which is ruled by a Kaffir is Dar-ul-Harb to a
Musalman. Given this, no further evidence seems to be necessary to prove
that the Muslims will not obey a Hindu government. The basic feelings of
deference and sympathy, which predispose persons to obey the authority
of government, do not simply exist. But if proof is wanted, there is no
dearth of it. It is so abundant that the problem is what to tender and
what to omit.</p>
<p>In the midst of the Khilafat agitation, when the Hindus were doing
so much to help the Musalmans, the Muslims did not forget that as
compared with them the Hindus were a low and an inferior race. A
Musalman wrote**<a href="#n12">/12/</a>** in the Khilafat paper called <strong>Insaf</strong>:—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What is the meaning of Swami and Mahatma? Can Muslims use in speech
or writing these words about non-Muslims? He says that Swami means
&lsquo;Master&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Mahatma&rsquo; means &lsquo;possessed of the highest spiritual
power &rsquo; and is equivalent to &lsquo;Ruh-i-aazam&rsquo;, and the supreme spirit.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>He asked the Muslim divines to decide by an authoritative <em>fatwa</em>
whether it was lawful for Muslims to call non-Muslims by such
deferential and reverential titles.<br>
A remarkable incident was reported**<a href="#n13">/13/</a>** in connection
with the celebration of Mr. Gandhi&rsquo;s release from gaol in 1924 at the
Tibbia College of Yunani medicine run by Hakim Ajmal Khan at Delhi.
According to the report, a Hindu student compared Mr. Gandhi to Hazarat
Isa (Jesus) and at this sacrilege to the Musalman sentiment all the
Musalman students flared up and threatened the Hindu student with
violence, and, it is alleged, even the Musalman professors joined with
their co-religionists in this demonstration of their outraged feelings.</p>
<p>In 1923 Mr. Mahomed Ali presided over the session of the Indian
National Congress. In this address he spoke of Mr. Gandhi in the
following terms :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Many have compared the Mahatma&rsquo;s teachings, and latterly his personal
sufferings, to those of Jesus (on whom be peace). . . .When Jesus
contemplated the world at the outset of his ministry he was called
upon to make his choice of the weapons of reform. . . .The idea of
being all-powerful by suffering and resignation, and of triumphing
over force by purity of heart, is as old as the days of Abel and Cain,
the first progeny of man. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be that as it may, it was just as peculiar to Mahatma Gandhi also;
but it was reserved for a Christian Government to treat as felon the
most Christ like man of our time (Shame, Shame) and to penalize as a
disturber of the public peace the one man engaged in public affairs
who comes nearest to the Prince of Peace. The political conditions of
India just before the advent of the Mahatma resembled those of Judea
on the eve of the advent of Jesus, and the prescription that he
offered to those in search of a remedy for the ills of India was the
same that Jesus had dispensed before in Judea. Self-purification
through suffering; a moral preparation for the responsibilities of
governmen ; self-discipline as the condition precedent of Swaraj—this
was Mahatma&rsquo;s creed and conviction; and those of us, who have been
privileged to have lived in the glorious year that culminated in the
Congress session at Ahmedabad, have seen what a remarkable and rapid
change he wrought in the thoughts, feelings and actions of such large
masses of mankind.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>A year after, Mr. Mahomed Ali, speaking at Aligarh and Ajmere, said :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;However pure Mr. Gandhi&rsquo;s character may be, he must appear to me from
the point of view of religion inferior to any Musalman, even though he
be without character.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>The statement created a great stir. Many did not believe that Mr.
Mahomed Ali, who testified to so much veneration for Mr. Gandhi, was
capable of entertaining such ungenerous and contemptuous sentiments
about him. When Mr. Mahomed Ali was speaking at a meeting held at
Aminabad Park in Lucknow, he was asked whether the sentiments attributed
to him were true. Mr. Mahomed Ali without any hesitation or compunction
replied**<a href="#n14">/14/</a>**:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, according to my religion and creed, I do hold an adulterous and
a fallen Musalman to be better than Mr. Gandhi.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>It was suggested**<a href="#n15">/15/</a>** at the time that Mr. Mahomed Ali
had to recant because the whole of the orthodox Muslim community had
taken offence for his having shown such deference to Mr. Gandhi, who was
a Kaffir, as to put him on the same pedestal as Jesus. Such praise of a
Kaffir, they felt, was forbidden by the Muslim Canon Law.</p>
<p>In a manifesto**<a href="#n16">/16/</a>** on Hindu-Muslim relations issued in
1928, Khwaja Hasan Nizami declared:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Musalmans are separate from Hindus; they cannot unite with the
Hindus. After bloody wars the Musalmans conquered India, and the
English took India from them. The Musalmans are one united nation and
they alone will be masters of India. They will never give up their
individuality. They have ruled India for hundreds of years, and hence
they have a prescriptive right over the country. The Hindus are a
minor community in the world. They are never free from internecine
quarrels; they believe in Gandhi and worship the cow; they are
polluted by taking other people&rsquo;s water. The Hindus do not care for
self-government; they have no time to spare for it; let them go on
with their internal squabbles. What capacity have they for ruling over
men? The Musalmans did rule, and the Musalmans will rule.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Far from rendering obedience to Hindus, the Muslims seem to be ready
to try conclusions with the Hindus again. In 1926 there arose a
controversy as to who really won the third battle of Panipat, fought in
1761. It was contended for the Muslims that it was a great victory for
them because Ahmad Shah Abdali had I lakh of soldiers while the
Mahrattas had 4 to 6 lakhs. The Hindus replied that it was a victory to
them—a victory to [the] vanquished—because it stemmed the tide of
Muslim invasions. The Muslims were not prepared to admit defeat at the
hands of Hindus, and claimed that they will always prove superior to the
Hindus. To prove the eternal superiority of Muslims over Hindus, it was
proposed by one Maulana Akbar Shah Khan of Najibabad in all seriousness,
that the Hindus and Muslims should fight, under test conditions, [a]
fourth battle on the same fateful plain of Panipat. The Maulana
accordingly issued**<a href="#n17">/17/</a>** a challenge to Pandit Madan Mohan
Malaviya in the following terms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If you Malaviyaji, are making efforts to falsify the result at
Panipat, I shall show you an easy and an excellent way (of testing
it). Use your well-known influence and induce the British Government
to permit the fourth battle of Panipat to be fought without hindrance
from the authorities. I am ready to provide. . . .a comparative test
of the valour and fighting spirit of the Hindus and the Musalmans. . .
.As there are seven crores of Musalmans in India, I shall arrive on a
fixed date on the plain of Panipat with 700 Musalmans representing the
seven crores of Muslims in India and as there are 22 crores of Hindus
I allow you to come with 2,200 Hindus. The proper thing is not to use
cannon, machine guns or bombs: only swords and javelins and spears,
bows and arrows and daggers should be used. If you cannot accept the
post of generalissimo of the Hindu host, you may give it to any
descendant of Sadashivrao**<a href="#n18">/18/</a>** or Vishwasrao so that their
scions may have an opportunity to avenge the defeat of their ancestors
in 1761. But any way do come as a spectator; for on seeing the result
of this battle you will have to change your views, and I hope there
will be then an end of the present discord and fighting in the
country. . . .In conclusion I beg to add that among the 700 men that I
shall bring there will be no Pathans or Afghans as you are mortally
afraid of them. So I shall bring with me only Indian Musalmans of good
family who are staunch adherents of Shariat.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

scheme ready-made of a Middle Eastern Empire.&quot;—1938, Vol. II, Section on
