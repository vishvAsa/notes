## CXCVII

*To Mrs. Ole Bull*

THE MATH, BELUR,  
HOWRAH DIST., BENGAL, INDIA,  
*15 December, 1900*.

MY DEAR MOTHER,

Three days ago I reached here. It was quite unexpected â€” my visit, and
everybody was so surprised.

Things here have gone better than I expected during my absence, only Mr.
Sevier has passed away. It was a tremendous blow, sure, and I don't know
the future of the work in the Himalayas. I am expecting daily a letter
from Mrs. Sevier who is there still.

How are you? Where are you? My affairs here will be straightened out
shortly, I hope, and I am trying my best to straighten them out.

The remittance you send my cousin should henceforth be sent to me
direct, the bills being drawn in my name. I will cash them and send her
the money. It is better the money goes to her through me.

Saradananda and Brahmananda are much better and this year there is very
little malaria here. This narrow strip on the banks of the river is
always free from malaria. Only when we get a large supply of pure water
the conditions will be perfected here. 

VIVEKANANDA.
