In the town the mind feels contracted. Places like&#xA;Rādhā-kunda, I have heard, are delightful; but they are at some distance&#xA;from the town. I have a mind to proceed very shortly to Hardwar. In case&#xA;you have any acquaintance there, you would be doing me a great favour if&#xA;you would kindly write him an introduction for me. What about your&#xA;visiting this place? Please reply early and oblige.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Twice did&#xA;Gangadhar ascend up to Tibet and Bhutan. He is in great happiness and&#xA;felt overwhelmed and wept at the meeting. He spent the winter at&#xA;Kankhal. The Karoā (waterpot) you gave him, he still keeps with him. He&#xA;is coming back and is expected at Vrindaban this very month. So in the&#xA;hope of meeting him, I postpone my going to Hardwar for some days.&#xA;Please convey my deepest respects to the Brahmin devotee of Shiva who is&#xA;with you and accept the same yourself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;iii-1fn1&#34;&gt;III &lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Translated from &lt;a href=&#34;b6003e6003.pdf&#34;&gt;Bengali&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salutation to Bhagavan Ramakrishna!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;THE BARANAGORE MATH,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;19th Nov., 1888.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;RESPECTED SIR,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have received the two books sent by you and am filled with joy to read&#xA;your wonderfully affectionate letter which betokens your broad, generous&#xA;heart. No doubt, it is due to good merit of my previous births that you&#xA;show, sir, so much kindness to a mendicant like me who lives on begging.&#xA;By sending your gift of the &amp;ldquo;Vedanta&amp;rdquo;, you have laid under lifelong&#xA;obligation not only myself but the whole group of Shri Ramakrishna&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;Sannyasins. They all bow down to you in respect. It is not for my own&#xA;sake alone that I asked of you the copy of Pānini&amp;rsquo;s grammar; a good deal&#xA;of study, in fact, is given to Sanskrit scriptures in this Math. The&#xA;Vedas may well be said to have fallen quite out of vogue in Bengal. Many&#xA;here in this Math are conversant with Sanskrit, and they have a mind to&#xA;master the Samhitā portions of the Vedas. They are of opinion that what&#xA;has to be done must be done to a finish. So, believing that a full&#xA;measure of proficiency in the Vedic language is impossible without first&#xA;mastering Panini&amp;rsquo;s grammar, which is the best available for the purpose,&#xA;a copy of the latter was felt to be a necessity. The grammatical work&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Mugdhabodha&lt;/em&gt;, which we studied in our boyhood, is superior in many&#xA;respects to &lt;em&gt;Laghukaumudi&lt;/em&gt;. You are yourself, however, a deeply learned&#xA;man and, therefore, the best judge we can have in this matter. So if you&#xA;consider the &lt;em&gt;Ashtādhyāyi&lt;/em&gt; (Panini&amp;rsquo;s) to be the most suitable in our&#xA;case, you will lay us under a debt of lifelong gratitude by sending the&#xA;same (provided you feel it convenient and feel so inclined). This Math&#xA;is not wanting in men of perseverance, talent, and penetrative&#xA;intellect. I may hope that by the grace of our Master, they will acquire&#xA;in a short time Panini&amp;rsquo;s system and then succeed in restoring the Vedas&#xA;to Bengal. I beg to send you two photographs of my revered Master and&#xA;two parts of some of his teachings as given in his homely style&#xA;compiled, and published by a certain gentleman — hoping you will give us&#xA;the pleasure of your acceptance. My health is now much improved, and I&#xA;expect the blessings of meeting you within two or three months. . . .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I accept it as the call of Vishveshvara. (The Lord of the&#xA;Universe, or Shiva, as installed in the leading temple of Varanasi or&#xA;Kashi.) I am going now on a pilgrimage to the place of my Master&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;nativity, and after a sojourn of a few days there, I shall present&#xA;myself to you. He must be made of stone whose mind does not melt at the&#xA;sigh of Kashi and its Lord! I feel now much improved in health. My&#xA;regards to Jnanananda. I am coming as soon as I can. It all depends&#xA;ultimately on Vishveshvara&amp;rsquo;s will . . . . More when we meet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

You have hit Ramakrishna in the&#xA;right point.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Few, alas, few understand him!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yours,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;VIVEKANANDA.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;PS. My heart leaps with joy — and it is a wonder that I do not go mad&#xA;when I find anybody thoroughly launched into the midst of the doctrine&#xA;which is to shower peace on earth hereafter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;*A village in the Hooghly District, the birth-place of Swami&#xA;Premananda. The letter was written to Master Mahashaya.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I have now obtained news of Gangadhar. He met&#xA;one of my brother -disciples, and both are now staying in the&#xA;Uttarakhanda (the sacred Himalayas). Four of us from here are in the&#xA;Himalayas now, and with Gangadhar they are five. One brother-disciple&#xA;named Shivananda came across Gangadhar at Srinagara on the way to holy&#xA;Kedarnath, and Gangadhar has sent two letters here. During his first&#xA;year in the Himalayas, he could not secure permission to enter Tibet,&#xA;but he got it the next year. The Lamas love him much, and he had picked&#xA;up the Tibetan language. He says the Lamas form ninety per cent of the&#xA;population, but they mostly practice Tāntrika forms of worship. The&#xA;country is intensely cold — eatables there are scarcely any — only dried&#xA;meat; and Gangadhar had to travel and live on that food. My health is&#xA;passable, but the state of mind is terrible!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

You&#xA;have asked me to request Gangadhar to write to you, but I see no chance&#xA;thereof, for though they are sending us letters, they do not stop&#xA;anywhere for more than two or three days and therefore do not receive&#xA;any of ours.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For an interval of a month and a half I kept&#xA;well, but I have suffered again for the last ten days; now I am doing&#xA;well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But the blame attaches not to me but to your own&#xA;excellent qualities. I wrote in one letter before that from the way I&#xA;feel attracted by your lofty virtues, it seems we had some affinity from&#xA;previous births. I make no distinction as to householder or Sannyasin in&#xA;this, that for all time my head shall bend low in reverence wherever I&#xA;see greatness, broadness of heart, and holiness — Shāntih! Shāntih!&#xA;Shāntih! My prayer is that among the many people embracing Sannyāsa&#xA;nowadays, greedy of honour, posing renunciation for the sake of a&#xA;living, and fallen off from the ideal on both sides, may one in a lakh&#xA;at least become high-souled like you! To you my Brahmin fellow-disciples&#xA;who have heard of your noble virtues tender their best prostrations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I am very much pleased&#xA;to find in you a wonderful harmony of Jnana and Bhakti. Your advice to&#xA;me to give up arguing and disputing is very true indeed, and that is&#xA;really the goal of life for the individual — &amp;ldquo;Sundered are the knots of&#xA;the heart, torn off are all his doubts, and the seeds of his Karma wear&#xA;off, when the sight of the Transcendent One is gained.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;(Mundakonapanishad, II. ii. 8.) But then, as my Master used to say, when&#xA;a pitcher is being filled (by immersion), it gurgles, but when full, it&#xA;is noiseless; know my condition to be the same. Within two or three&#xA;weeks perhaps, I shall be able to meet you — may God fulfil that wish!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Two of my brother disciples are shortly leaving for&#xA;Varanasi. One is Rakhal by name, the other is Subodh. The first-named&#xA;was beloved of my Master and used to stay much with him. Please&#xA;recommend them to some Satra (house of alms.) during their stay in the&#xA;city, if you find it convenient. You will hear from them all my news.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I have received the pamphlet&#xA;written by you. A kind of scientific Advaitism has been spreading in&#xA;Europe ever since the theory of the conservation of energy was&#xA;discovered, but all that is Parināmavāda, evolution by real&#xA;modification. It is good you have shown the difference between this and&#xA;Shankara&amp;rsquo;s Vivartavāda (progressive manifestation by unreal&#xA;superimposition). I can&amp;rsquo;t appreciate your citing Spencer&amp;rsquo;s parody on the&#xA;German transcendentalists; he himself is fed much on their doles. It is&#xA;doubtful whether your opponent Gough understands his Hegel sufficiently.&#xA;Anyway, your rejoinder is very pointed and thrashing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In a day or two I take myself to your feet at holy Kashi.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have been putting up here for some days with a gentleman of Calcutta,&#xA;but my mind is much longing for Varanasi. My idea is to remain there for&#xA;some time, and to watch how Vishvanātha and Annapurnā (Shiva and His&#xA;Divine Spouse as installed in Varanasi.) deal it out to my lot. And my&#xA;resolve is something like &amp;ldquo;either to lay down my life or realise my&#xA;ideal&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;शरीरं वा पातयामि मन्त्रं वा साधयामि ।&amp;rdquo; — so help me the Lord of&#xA;Kashi.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

News reached me that a&#xA;brother-disciple, Yogen by name, had been attacked with smallpox after&#xA;arriving here from a pilgrimage to Chitrakuta, Omkarnath, etc., and so I&#xA;came to this place to nurse him. He has now completely recovered. Some&#xA;Bengali gentlemen here are of a greatly pious and loving disposition.&#xA;They are very lovingly taking care of me, and their importunate desire&#xA;is that I should stay here during the month of Māgha (Jan.-Feb.) keeping&#xA;the Kalpa vow. (Special ablutions and worship regularly performed in&#xA;that holy confluence — a very solemn and sacred practice.) But my mind&#xA;is very keenly harping on the name of Varanasi and is quite agog to see&#xA;you. Yes, I am going to try my best to slip away and avoid their&#xA;importunities in a day or two and betake myself to the holy realm of the&#xA;Lord of Varanasi. If one of my monastic brother-disciples, Achyutananda&#xA;Sarasvati by name, calls on you to enquire of me, please tell him I am&#xA;soon coming to Varanasi. He is indeed a very good man and learned. I was&#xA;obliged to leave him behind at Bankipore. Are Rakhal and Subodh still&#xA;there in Varanasi? Please inquire and inform me whether the Kumbha fair&#xA;this year is going to be held at Hardwar or not.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;xv&#34;&gt;XV&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Translated from &lt;a href=&#34;b6021e6015.pdf&#34;&gt;Bengali&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salutation to Shri Ramakrishna!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;ALLAHABAD,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;5th January, 1890&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;MY DEAR SIR, (Sj. Balaram Bose)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am very sorry to hear of your illness from your kind note. The gist of&#xA;the letter I wrote to you about your change to Baidyanath was that it&#xA;would be impossible for a man of weak and extremely delicate physique&#xA;like you to live in that place unless you spent a good deal of money. If&#xA;change be really advisable for you, and if you have deferred it so long&#xA;simply to select a cheaper place and that sort of thing, it is certainly&#xA;a matter of regret. . . . Baidyanath is excellent so far as the air is&#xA;concerned, but the water is not good, it upsets the stomach. I used to&#xA;suffer from acidity every day. I have already written you a letter; have&#xA;you got it, or finding it a bearing letter, have you left it to its&#xA;fate? In my opinion, if you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to go away for a change, the sooner&#xA;the better. But, pardon me, you have a tendency to expect that&#xA;everything should fit in exactly with your requirements, but&#xA;unfortunately, such a state of things is very rare in this world.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;आत्मानं सततं रक्षेत् — One must save oneself under any circumstances.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Lord have mercy&amp;rdquo;, is all right, but He helps him who helps himself. If&#xA;you simply try to save your purse, will the Lord arrange the change for&#xA;you by drawing on His ancestral capital? If you think you have so much&#xA;reliance on the Lord, don&amp;rsquo;t call in the doctor, please. . . . If that&#xA;does not suit you, you should go to Varanasi. I would have already left&#xA;this place, but the local gentlemen would not give me leave to depart! .&#xA;. . But let me repeat once more, if change is actually decided upon,&#xA;please do not hesitate out of miserliness. That would be suicide. And&#xA;not even God can save a suicide. Please convey my compliments to Tulasi&#xA;Babu and the rest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Here I am putting up in the house of&#xA;Babu Satish Chandra Mukherji, a friend of my early age. The place is&#xA;very pleasant. Close by flows the Ganga, but bathing there is&#xA;troublesome, for there is no regular path, and it is hard work wading&#xA;through sands. Babu Ishan Chandra Mukherji, my friend&amp;rsquo;s father, that&#xA;noble-hearted man of whom I spoke to you, is here. Today he is leaving&#xA;for Varanasi whence he will proceed to Calcutta. I again had a great&#xA;mind to go over to Kashi, but the object of my coming here, namely, an&#xA;interview with the Bābāji (Pavhāri Bābā, the great saint.), has not yet&#xA;been realised, and. hence the delay of a few days becomes necessary.&#xA;Everything here appears good. The people are all gentlemen, but very&#xA;much Westernised; and it is a pity I am so thoroughly against every&#xA;affectation of the Western idea. Only my friend very little affects such&#xA;ideals. What a frippery civilisation is it indeed that the foreigners&#xA;have brought over here! What a materialistic illusion have they created!&#xA;May Vishvanātha save these weak-hearted! After seeing Babaji, I shall&#xA;send you a detailed account.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He does not step out of his&#xA;home; and, when willing to speak at all, he just comes near the door to&#xA;speak from inside. I have come away with having just a view of his&#xA;garden-house with chimneys tapering above and encircled by high walls —&#xA;no means of admittance within! People say there are cave-like rooms&#xA;within where he dwells; and he only knows what he does there, for nobody&#xA;has had a peep. I had to come away one day sorely used up with waiting&#xA;and waiting, but shall take my chance again. On Sunday, I leave for holy&#xA;Varanasi — only the Babus here won&amp;rsquo;t let me off; otherwise all my fancy&#xA;to see the Babaji has flattened down. I am prepared to be off today, but&#xA;anyhow, I am leaving on Sunday. What of your plan of going to&#xA;Hrishikesh?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

A great sage indeed! — It is all very&#xA;wonderful, and in this atheistic age, a towering representation of&#xA;marvellous power born of Bhakti and Yoga! I have sought refuge in his&#xA;grace; and he has given me hope — a thing very few may be fortunate&#xA;enough to obtain. It is Babaji&amp;rsquo;s wish that I stay on for some days here,&#xA;and he would do me some good. So following this saint&amp;rsquo;s bidding I shall&#xA;remain here for some time. No doubt, this will give you also much&#xA;pleasure. I don&amp;rsquo;t mention them in a letter, but the facts are very&#xA;strange indeed — to be disclosed when we meet. Unless one is face to&#xA;face with the life of such men, faith in the scriptures does not grow in&#xA;all its real integrity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;xix-1fn1&#34;&gt;XIX &lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Translated from &lt;a href=&#34;b6028e6019.pdf&#34;&gt;Bengali&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;GHAZIPUR,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;7th Feb., 1890.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DEAR SIR,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I feel very happy to hear from you just now. Apparently in his features,&#xA;the Babaji is a Vaishnava the embodiment, so to speak, of Yoga, Bhakti,&#xA;and humility. His dwelling has walls on all sides with a few doors in&#xA;them. Inside these walls, there is one long underground burrow wherein&#xA;he lays himself up in Samādhi. He talks to others only when he comes out&#xA;of the hole. Nobody knows what he eats, and so they call him Pavhāri&#xA;(One living on air.) Bābā. Once he did not come out of the hole for five&#xA;years, and people thought he had given up the body. But now again he is&#xA;out. But this time he does not show himself to people and talks from&#xA;behind the door. Such sweetness in speech I have never come across! He&#xA;does not give a direct reply to questions but says, &amp;ldquo;What does this&#xA;servant know?&amp;rdquo; But then fire comes out as the talking goes on. On my&#xA;pressing him very much he said, &amp;ldquo;Favour me highly by staying here some&#xA;days.&amp;rdquo; But he never speaks in this way; so from this I understood he&#xA;meant to reassure me and whenever I am importunate, he asks me to stay&#xA;on. So I wait in hope. He is a learned man no doubt but nothing in the&#xA;line betrays itself. He performs scriptural ceremonials, for from the&#xA;full-moon day to the last day of the month, sacrificial oblations go on.&#xA;So it is sure, he is not retiring into the hole during this period. How&#xA;can I ask his permission, (Evidently for a proposed visit to the saint&#xA;by the correspondent, Pramadadas Mitra of Varanasi.) for he never gives&#xA;a direct reply; he goes on multiplying such expressions as &amp;ldquo;this&#xA;servant&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;my fortune&amp;rdquo;, and so on. If you yourself have a mind, then&#xA;come sharp on receipt of this note. Or after his passing away, the&#xA;keenest regret will be left in your mind. In two days you may return&#xA;after an interview — I mean a talk with him &lt;em&gt;ab intra&lt;/em&gt;. My friend Satish&#xA;Babu will receive you most warmly. So, do come up directly you receive&#xA;this; I shall meanwhile let Babaji know of you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I am also having some sort of a&#xA;pain in the loins which, being aggravated of late, gives much trouble.&#xA;For two days I could not go out to meet Babaji, and so a man came from&#xA;him to inquire about me. For this reason, I go today. I shall convey&#xA;your countless compliments. &amp;ldquo;Fire comes out&amp;rdquo; that is, a wonderful&#xA;devotion to Guru and resignation are revealed; and such amazing&#xA;endurance and humility I have never seen. Whatever good things I may&#xA;come by, sure, you have your share in them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Please send it. I have heard from brother Gangadhar. He&#xA;is now in Rambag Samadhi, Srinagar, Kashmir. I am greatly suffering from&#xA;lumbago.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yours etc.,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;VIVEKANANDA.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;PS. Rakhal and Subodh have come to Vrindaban after visiting Omkar,&#xA;Girnar, Abu, Bombay, and Dwarka.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#txt1&#34;&gt;^&lt;/a&gt;Letters i - iv, vi - xiv, xvi - xxii, xxiv - xxvi, xxix,&#xA;xxxi - xxxiii and cxxiv are translated from Bengali letters written&#xA;to Pramadadas Mitra of Varanasi, an orthodox Hindu, for whose&#xA;profound erudition and piety Swamiji had the highest regard. These&#xA;letters are most interesting being written (except the last) at a&#xA;time when, after his Master&amp;rsquo;s passing away, Swamiji was leading a&#xA;wandering monk&amp;rsquo;s life. In the early days he used to sign his name as&#xA;Narendranath, though his now famous name, Vivekananda, is printed in&#xA;all these pages for easy comprehension.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

I enclose&#xA;the reply that came from him. Brother Kali is having repeated attacks of&#xA;fever at Hrishikesh. I have sent him a wire from this place.

The sons of my Master are&#xA;indeed the great objects of my service, and here alone I feel I have&#xA;some duty left for me. Perhaps I shall send brother Kali down to&#xA;Allahabad or somewhere else, as convenient. At your feet are laid a&#xA;hundred and one faults of mine — &amp;ldquo;I am as thy son, so guide me who have&#xA;taken refuge in thee.&amp;rdquo; (An adaptation from the Gitā, II. 7.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The mind does not find rest here any&#xA;longer. It is three days since I came away from Babaji&amp;rsquo;s place, but he&#xA;inquires of me kindly almost every day. As soon as the lumbago is a&#xA;little better, I bid good-bye to Babaji. Countless greetings to you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;xxv-1fn1&#34;&gt;XXV &lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Translated from &lt;a href=&#34;b6037e6025.pdf&#34;&gt;Bengali&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Victory to the Lord!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;GHAZIPUR,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;3rd March, 1890&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DEAR SIR,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your kind letter comes to hand just now. You know not, sir, I am a very&#xA;soft-natured man in spite of the stern Vedantic views I hold. And this&#xA;proves to be my undoing. At the slightest touch I give myself away; for&#xA;howsoever I may try to think only of my own good, I slip off in spite of&#xA;myself to think of other peoples&amp;rsquo; interests. This time it was with a&#xA;very stern resolve that I set out to pursue my own good, but I had to&#xA;run off at the news of the illness of a brother at Allahabad! And now&#xA;comes this news from Hrishikesh, and my mind has run off with me there.&#xA;I have wired to Sharat, hut no reply yet — a nice place indeed to delay&#xA;even telegrams so much! The lumbago obstinately refuses to leave me, and&#xA;the pain is very great. For the last few days I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to go&#xA;to see Pavhariji, but out of his kindness he sends every day for my&#xA;report. But now I see the whole matter is inverted in its bearings!&#xA;While I myself have come, a beggar, at his door, he turns round and&#xA;wants to learn of me! This saint perhaps is not yet perfected — too much&#xA;of rites, vows, observances, and too much of self-concealment. The ocean&#xA;in its fullness cannot be contained within its shores, I am sure. So it&#xA;is not good, I have decided not to disturb this Sādhu (holy man) for&#xA;nothing, and very soon I shall ask leave of him to go. No help, you see;&#xA;Providence has dealt me my death to make me so tender! Babaji does not&#xA;let me off, and Gagan Babu (whom probably you know — an upright, pious,&#xA;and kindhearted man) does not let me off. If the wire in reply requires&#xA;my leaving this place, I go; if not, I am coming to you at Varanasi in a&#xA;few days. I am not going to let you off  — I must take you to Hrishikesh&#xA;— no excuse or objections will do. What are you saying about&#xA;difficulties there of keeping clean? Lack of water in the hills or lack&#xA;of room!! Tirthas (places of pilgrimage) and Sannyasins of the Kali-Yuga&#xA;— you know what they are. Spend money and the owners of temples will&#xA;fling away the installed god to make room for you; so no anxiety about a&#xA;resting-place! No trouble to face there, I say; the summer heat has set&#xA;in there now, I believe, though not that degree of it as you find at&#xA;Varanasi — so much the better. Always the nights are quite cool there,&#xA;from which good sleep is almost a certainty.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Please&#xA;write to inform where you mean to put up while there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yours etc.,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;VIVEKANANDA.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;PS.

These&#xA;letters are most interesting being written (except the last) at a&#xA;time when, after his Master&amp;rsquo;s passing away, Swamiji was leading a&#xA;wandering monk&amp;rsquo;s life. In the early days he used to sign his name as&#xA;Narendranath, though his now famous name, Vivekananda, is printed in&#xA;all these pages for easy comprehension.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

I am at present staying with&#xA;the wonderful Yogi and devotee of this place, called Pavhariji. He never&#xA;comes out of his room and holds conversations with people from behind&#xA;the door. Inside the room there is a pit in which he lives. It is&#xA;rumoured that he remains in a state of Samadhi for months together. His&#xA;fortitude is most wonderful. Our Bengal is the land of Bhakti and of&#xA;Jnana, where Yoga is scarcely so much as talked of even. What little&#xA;there is, is but the queer breathing exercises of the Hatha-Yoga — which&#xA;is nothing but a kind of gymnastics. Therefore I am staying with this&#xA;wonderful Raja-Yogi — and he has given me some hopes, too. There is a&#xA;beautiful bungalow in a small garden belonging to a gentleman here; I&#xA;mean to stay there. The garden is quite close to Babaji&amp;rsquo;s cottage. A&#xA;brother of the Babaji stays there to look after the comforts of the&#xA;Sadhus, and I shall have my Bhikshā at his place. Hence, with a view to&#xA;seeing to the end of this fun, I give up for the present my plan of&#xA;going to the hills. For the last two months I have had an attack of&#xA;lumbago in the waist, which also makes it impossible to climb the hills&#xA;now. Therefore let me wait and see what Babaji will give me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I have written everything in detail in my&#xA;last letter. You start immediately on receipt of this. I know the route&#xA;to Tibet via Nepal that you have spoken of. As they don&amp;rsquo;t allow anyone&#xA;to enter Tibet easily, so they don&amp;rsquo;t allow anybody to go anywhere in&#xA;Nepal, except Katmandu, its capital, and one or two places of&#xA;pilgrimage. But a friend of mine is now a tutor to His Highness the&#xA;Maharaja of Nepal, and a teacher in his school, from whom I have it that&#xA;when the Nepal government send their subsidy to China, they send it via&#xA;Lhasa. A Sadhu contrived in that way to go to Lhasa, China, Manchuria,&#xA;and even to the holy seat of Tārā Devi in north China. We, too, can&#xA;visit with dignity and respect Tibet, Lhasa, China, and all, if that&#xA;friend of mine tries to arrange it. You therefore start immediately for&#xA;Ghazipur. After a few days&amp;rsquo; stay here with the Babaji, I shall&#xA;correspond with my friend, and, everything arranged, I shall certainly&#xA;go to Tibet via Nepal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For some special reasons, I shall continue to stay in&#xA;secret in a village some distance from this place, and there&amp;rsquo;s no&#xA;facility for writing any letter from that place, owing to which I could&#xA;not reply to your letter so long. Brother Gangadhar is very likely to&#xA;come, otherwise the reply to my note would have reached me. Brother&#xA;Abhedananda is putting up with Doctor Priya at Varanasi. Another brother&#xA;of mine had been with me, but has left for Abhedananda&amp;rsquo;s place. The news&#xA;of his arrival has not yet been received, and, his health being bad, I&#xA;am rather anxious for his sake. I have behaved very cruelly towards him&#xA;— that is, I have harassed him much to make him leave my company.&#xA;There&amp;rsquo;s no help, you see; I am so very weak-hearted, so much&#xA;overmastered by the distractions of love! Bless me that I may harden.&#xA;What shall I say to you about the condition of my mind! Oh, it is as if&#xA;the hell-fire is burning there day and night! Nothing, nothing could I&#xA;do yet! And this life seems muddled away in vain; I feel quite helpless&#xA;as to what to do! The Babaji throws out honeyed words and keeps me from&#xA;leaving. Ah, what shall I say? I am committing hundreds of offenses&#xA;against you — please excuse them as so many misdoings of a man driven&#xA;mad with mental agonies. Abhedananda is suffering from dysentery. I&#xA;shall be very much obliged if you will kindly inquire about his&#xA;condition and send him down to our Math in case he wants to go there&#xA;with our brother who has come from here. My Gurubhais must be thinking&#xA;me very cruel and selfish. Oh, what can I do? Who will see deep down&#xA;into my mind? Who will know how much I am suffering day and night? Bless&#xA;me that I may have the most unflinching patience and perseverance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I am doing pretty well here. You have expressed a desire&#xA;to see me. I too have a similar longing, and it is this that makes me&#xA;afraid of going. Moreover, the Babaji forbids me to do so. I shall try&#xA;to go on a few days&amp;rsquo; leave from him. But there is this fear that by so&#xA;doing I shall be drawn up to the hills by the attraction I have for&#xA;Hrishikesh, and it will be very difficult to shake it off, specially for&#xA;one weak-minded, you see, like myself. The attack of lumbago, too, will&#xA;not leave me on any account — a botheration! But then I am getting used&#xA;to it. Please convey my countless salutations to Pramada Babu; his is a&#xA;friendship which greatly benefits both my mind and body. And I am&#xA;particularly indebted to him. Things will turn up some way, anyhow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Glad to learn from Abhedananda&amp;rsquo;s letter that you are doing&#xA;well. Gangadhar (Akhandananda) has probably arrived at Varanasi by this&#xA;time. King Death happens here to be casting into his jaws these days&#xA;many of our friends and own people, hence I am very much taken up.&#xA;Perhaps no letter for me has arrived there from Nepal. I know not how&#xA;and when Vishvanātha (the Lord of Kashi) would choose to vouchsafe some&#xA;rest to me. Directly the hot weather relaxes a little, I am off from&#xA;this place, but I am still at a loss where to go. Do please pray for me&#xA;to Vishvanatha that He may grant me strength. You are a devotee, and I&#xA;beseech you with the Lord&amp;rsquo;s words coming to my mind, &amp;ldquo;Those who are the&#xA;devoted ones to My devotees, are indeed considered the best of My&#xA;devotees.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I already told you at the outset that I am Ramakrishna&amp;rsquo;s slave,&#xA;having laid my body at his feet &amp;ldquo;with Til and Tulasi leaves&amp;rdquo;, I cannot&#xA;disregard his behest. If it is in failure that that great sage laid down&#xA;his life after having attained to superhuman heights of Jnana, Bhakti,&#xA;Love, and powers, and after having practiced for forty years stern&#xA;renunciation, non-attachment, holiness, and great austerities, then&#xA;where is there anything for us to count on? So I am obliged to trust his&#xA;words as the words of one identified with truth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

They say Almora is healthiest at this&#xA;time of the year, yet you are taken ill! I hope it is nothing malarious.&#xA;. . .&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I find Gangadhar the same pliant child with his turbulence moderated by&#xA;his wanderings, and with a greater love for us and for our Lord. He is&#xA;bold, brave, sincere, and steadfast. The only thing needed is a guiding&#xA;mind to whom he would instinctively submit with reverence, and a fine&#xA;man would be the result.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

My children, the secret of&#xA;religion lies not in theories but in practice. To be good and to do good&#xA;— that is the whole of religion. &amp;ldquo;Not he that crieth &amp;lsquo;Lord&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Lord&amp;rsquo;, but&#xA;he that doeth the will of the Father&amp;rdquo;.

I am very much gratified by your love&#xA;for my unworthy self. So, so sorry to learn that poor Bālāji has lost&#xA;his son. &amp;ldquo;The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the&#xA;name of the Lord.&amp;rdquo; We only know that nothing is lost or can be lost. For&#xA;us is only submission, calm and perfect. The soldier has no right to&#xA;complain, nay murmur, if the general orders him into the cannon&amp;rsquo;s mouth.&#xA;May He comfort Balaji in his grief, and may it draw him closer and&#xA;closer to the breast of the All-merciful Mother!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Please do&#xA;not be sorry that I could not write to you very often. I am always&#xA;praying to the Lord for your welfare. I cannot go to Belgaum now as&#xA;arrangements are all ready for my starting for America on the 31st next.&#xA;The Lord willing, I shall see you on returning from my travels in&#xA;America and Europe. Always resign yourselves to the Lord Shri Krishna.&#xA;Always remember that we are but puppets in the Lord&amp;rsquo;s hands. Remain pure&#xA;always. Please be careful not to become impure even in thought, as also&#xA;in speech and action; always try to do good to others as far as in you&#xA;lies. And remember that the paramount duty of a woman is to serve her&#xA;husband by thought, word, and deed. Please read the Gita every day to&#xA;the best of your opportunity. Why have you signed yourself as. . . Dāsi&#xA;(maidservant)? The Vaishya and the Shudra should sign as Dāsa and Dāsi,&#xA;but the Brahmin and Kshatriya should write Deva and Devi (goddess).&#xA;Moreover, these distinctions of caste and the like have been the&#xA;invention of our modern sapient Brahmins. Who is a servant, and to whom?&#xA;Everyone is a servant of the Lord Hari. Hence a woman should use her&#xA;patronymic, that is, the surname of her husband. This is the ancient&#xA;Vedic custom, as for example, such and such Mitra, or the like. It is&#xA;needless to write much, dear mother; always know that I am constantly&#xA;praying for your well-being. From America I shall now and then write you&#xA;letters with descriptions of the wonderful things there. I am now at&#xA;Bombay, and shall stay here up to the 31st. The private Secretary to the&#xA;Maharaja of Khetri has come here to see me off.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The roof that affords you shelter&#xA;from heat and cold and rain is not to be judged by the pillars that&#xA;support it — the finest Corinthian columns though they be — but by the&#xA;real spirit-pillar who is the centre, the real support of the home — the&#xA;woman. Judged by that standard, the American home will not suffer in&#xA;comparison with any home in the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

HALE, ESQ.,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;541 DEARBORN AVENUE, CHICAGO,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;19th March, 1894&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;MY DEAR SHASHI (RAMAKRISHNANANDA),&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have not written to you since coming to this country. But Haridas&#xA;Bhai&amp;rsquo;s&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; letter gives me all the news. It is excellent that G. C.&#xA;Ghosh&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; and all of you have treated him with due consideration.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have no wants in this country, but mendicancy has no vogue here, and I&#xA;have to labour, that is, lecture in places. It is as cold here as it is&#xA;hot. The summer is not a bit less hot than in Calcutta. And how to&#xA;describe the cold in winter! The whole country is covered with snow,&#xA;three or four feet deep, nay, six or seven feet at places! In the&#xA;southern parts there is no snow. Snow, however, is a thing of little&#xA;consideration here. For it snows when the mercury stands at 32° F. In&#xA;Calcutta it scarcely comes down to 60° and it rarely approaches zero in&#xA;England. But here, your mercury sinks to &lt;em&gt;minus&lt;/em&gt; 4° or 5°. In Canada, in&#xA;the north, mercury becomes condensed, when they have to use the alcohol&#xA;thermometer. When it is too cold, that is, when the mercury stands even&#xA;below 20°F, it does not snow. I used to think that it must be an&#xA;exceedingly cold day on which the snow falls. But it is not so, it snows&#xA;on comparatively warm days. Extreme cold produces a sort of&#xA;intoxication. No carriages would run; only the sledge, which is without&#xA;wheels, slides on the ground! Everything is frozen stiff — even an&#xA;elephant can walk on rivers and canals and lakes. The massive falls of&#xA;Niagara, of such tremendous velocity, are frozen to marble!! But I am&#xA;doing nicely. I was a little afraid at first, but necessity makes me&#xA;travel by rail to the borders of Canada one day, and the next day finds&#xA;me lecturing in south U.S.A.! The carriages are kept quite warm, like&#xA;your own room, by means of steam pipes, and all around are masses of&#xA;snow, spotlessly white. Oh, the beauty of it!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;xlii&#34;&gt;XLII&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;23rd June, 1894&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DEAR SIR, (Rao Bahadur Narasimhachariar.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your kindness to me makes me venture to take a little advantage of it.&#xA;Mrs. Potter Palmer is the chief lady of the United States. She was the&#xA;lady president of the World&amp;rsquo;s Fair. She is much interested in raising&#xA;the women of the world and is at the head of a big organisation for&#xA;women. She is a particular friend of Lady Dufferin and has been&#xA;entertained by the Royalties of Europe on account of her wealth and&#xA;position. She has been very kind to me in this country. Now she is going&#xA;to make a tour in China, Japan, Siam, and India. Of course she will be&#xA;entertained by the Governors and other high people in India. But she is&#xA;particularly anxious to see our society apart from English official aid.&#xA;I have on many occasions told her about your noble efforts in raising&#xA;the Indian women, of your wonderful College in Mysore. I think it is our&#xA;duty to show a little hospitality to such personages from America in&#xA;return for their kindness to our countrymen who came here. I hope she&#xA;will find a warm reception at your hands and be helped to see a little&#xA;of our women as they are. And I assure you she is no missionary, nor&#xA;Christian even as to that. She wants to work apart from all religions to&#xA;ameliorate the conditions of women all over the world. This would also&#xA;be helping me a great deal in this country.

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;xliii&#34;&gt;XLIII&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;C/O GEORGE W. HALE, ESQ.,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;541 DEARBORN AVENUE, CHICAGO,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;26th June, 1894&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DEAR SISTERS, (Misses Mary and H. Hale.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The great Hindi poet, Tulasidāsa, in his benediction to his translation&#xA;of the Rāmāyana, says, &amp;ldquo;I bow down to both the wicked and holy; but&#xA;alas! for me, they are both equally torturers — the wicked begin to&#xA;torture me as soon as they come in contact with me — the good, alas!&#xA;take my life away when they leave me.&amp;rdquo; I say amen to this. To me, for&#xA;whom the only pleasure and love left in the world is to love the holy&#xA;ones of God, it is a mortal torture to separate myself from them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;xliv&#34;&gt;XLIV&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;GREENACRE INN,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;ELLIOT, MAINE,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;31st July, 1894&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DEAR SISTERS,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have not written you long, and I have not much to write. This is a big&#xA;inn and farm-house where the Christian Scientists are holding a session.&#xA;Last spring in New York I was invited by the lady projector of the&#xA;meeting to come here, and after all I am here. It is a beautiful and&#xA;cool place, no doubt, and many of my old friends of Chicago are here.&#xA;Mrs. Mills, Miss Stockham, and several other ladies and gentlemen live&#xA;in tents which they have pitched on the open ground by the river. They&#xA;have a lively time and sometimes all of them wear what you call your&#xA;scientific dress the whole day. They have lectures almost every day. One&#xA;Mr. Colville from Boston is here; he speaks every day, it is said, under&#xA;spirit control. The Editor (?) of the &lt;em&gt;Universal Truth&lt;/em&gt; has settled&#xA;herself down here. She is conducting religious services and holding&#xA;classes to heal all manner of diseases, and very soon I expect them to&#xA;be giving eyes to the blind, and the like! After all, it is a queer&#xA;gathering. They do not care much about social laws and are quite free&#xA;and happy. Mrs. Mills is quite brilliant, and so are many other ladies.&#xA;&amp;hellip; Another lady from Detroit — very cultured and with beautiful black&#xA;eyes and long hair is going to take me to an island fifteen miles out at&#xA;sea. I hope we shall have a nice time. &amp;hellip; I may go over to Annisquam&#xA;from here, I suppose. This is a beautiful and nice place and the bathing&#xA;is splendid. Cora Stockham has made a bathing dress for me, and I am&#xA;having as good a time in the water as a duck this is delicious even for&#xA;the denizens of mud Ville. I do not find anything more to write. Only I&#xA;am so busy that I cannot find time enough to write to Mother Church&#xA;separately. My love and respects to Miss Howe.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Rakhal (Brahmananda) and Hari (Turiyananda) wrote in a&#xA;letter from Lucknow that Hindu newspapers were praising me, and that&#xA;they were very glad that twenty thousand people had partaken of food at&#xA;Shri Ramakrishna&amp;rsquo;s anniversary. I could do much more work but for the&#xA;Brahmos and missionaries who have been opposing me unceasingly, and the&#xA;Hindus of India too did nothing for me. I mean, if the Hindus of&#xA;Calcutta or Madras had held a meeting and passed a resolution&#xA;recognising me as their representative, and thanking the American people&#xA;for receiving me with kindness, things would have progressed&#xA;appreciably. But it is over a year, and nothing done. Of course I never&#xA;relied on the Bengalis, but the Madrasis couldn&amp;rsquo;t do anything either.&#xA;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It gives me great pleasure to&#xA;learn that Shashi and others are making a stir. We must create a stir,&#xA;nothing short of this will do. You will be throwing the whole world into&#xA;convulsion. Victory to the Guru! You know, श्रेयांसि बहुविघ्नानि — Great&#xA;undertakings are always fraught with many obstacles.&amp;quot; It is these&#xA;obstacles which knock and shape great characters. &amp;hellip; Is it in the power&#xA;of missionaries and people of that sort to withstand this shock? &amp;hellip;&#xA;Should a fool succeed where scholars have failed? It is no go, my boy,&#xA;set your mind at ease about that. In every attempt there will be one set&#xA;of men who will applaud, and another who will pick holes. Go on doing&#xA;your own work, what need have you to reply to any party? &amp;ldquo;सत्यमेव जयते&#xA;नानृतं सत्येन पन्था विततो देवयानः — Truth alone triumphs, not falsehood.&#xA;Through Truth lies Devayāna, the path of gods&amp;rdquo; (Mundaka, III. i. 6).&#xA;Everything will come about by degrees.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But I have forgotten the exact location. If you&#xA;kindly write me that, I cannot express my gratitude for your kindness.&#xA;For that is exactly what I wanted, a quiet place to write. Of course,&#xA;much less space will suffice me than what you have kindly proposed to&#xA;put at my disposal, I can bundle myself up anywhere and feel quite&#xA;comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Come on to the practical field with tremendous&#xA;energy; to work, in the fullness of strength! As to the rest, the Lord&#xA;will point out the way. The whole world will be deluged by a tidal wave.&#xA;Work, work, work — let this be your motto.

You need not be sorry on account of the ill-treatment&#xA;I received at the hands of a low class hotel-keeper at Baltimore. It was&#xA;the fault of the Vrooman brothers. Why should they take me to a low&#xA;hotel?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And then the American women, as everywhere, came to my rescue, and I had&#xA;a very good time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I am so glad that you have come&#xA;to know Shri Ramakrishna. I am very glad at the strength of your&#xA;Vairāgya. It is the one primary necessity in reaching God. I had always&#xA;great hopes for Madras, and still I have the firm belief that from&#xA;Madras will come the spiritual wave that will deluge India. I can only&#xA;say Godspeed to your good intentions; but here, my son, are the&#xA;difficulties. In the first place, no man ought to take a hasty step. In&#xA;the second place, you must have some respect for the feelings of your&#xA;mother and wife. True, you may say that we, the disciples of&#xA;Ramakrishna, had not always shown great deference to the opinions of our&#xA;parents. I know, and know for sure, that great things are done only by&#xA;great sacrifices. I know for certain that India requires the sacrifice&#xA;of her highest and best, and I sincerely hope that it will be your good&#xA;fortune to be one of them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I am very sorry to hear of Mazoomdar&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;doings. One always behaves thus in trying to push oneself before all&#xA;others. I am not much to blame. M— came here ten years ago, and got much&#xA;reputation and honour; now I am in flying colours. Such is the will of&#xA;the Guru, what shall I do? It is childishness on M—&amp;rsquo;s part to be annoyed&#xA;at this. Never mind, उपेक्षितव्यं तद्वचनं भवत्सट्टशानां महात्मनाम्। अपि&#xA;कीटदंशनभीरुका वयं रामकृष्ण तनयास्तदूहृदयरुधिरपोषिताः।&#xA;&amp;ldquo;अलोकसामान्यमचिन्त्यहेतुकं निन्दन्ति मन्दाश्चरितं महात्मनाम् — Great men&#xA;like you should pay no heed to what he says. Shall we, children of Shri&#xA;Ramakrishna, nourished with his heart&amp;rsquo;s blood, be afraid of worm-bites?&#xA;&amp;ldquo;The wicked criticise the conduct of the magnanimous, which is&#xA;extraordinary and whose motives are difficult to fathom&amp;rdquo; (Kalidasa&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Kumārasambhavam&lt;/em&gt;.) — remember all this and forgive this fool. It is the&#xA;will of the Lord that people of this land have their power of&#xA;introspection roused, and does it lie in anybody to check His progress?&#xA;I want no name — I want to be a voice without a form. I do not require&#xA;anybody to defend me — कोऽहं तत्पादप्रसरं प्रतिरोद्धुं समर्थयितुं वा, के&#xA;वान्ये? तथापि मम हृदयकृतज्ञता तान् प्रति — who am I to check or to help&#xA;the course of His march? And who are others also? Still, my heartfelt&#xA;gratitude to them. &amp;ldquo;यस्मिंस्थितौ न दुःखेन गुरुणापि विचाल्यते&amp;rdquo; — नैषः&#xA;प्राप्तवान् तत्पदवीमिति मत्वा करुणादृष्ट्या द्रष्टव्योऽयमिति —&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Established in which state a man is not moved even by great misfortune&amp;rdquo;&#xA;(Gita) — that state he has not reached; think of this and look upon him&#xA;with pity. Through the Lord&amp;rsquo;s will, the desire for name and fame has not&#xA;yet crept into my heart, and I dare say never will. I am an instrument,&#xA;and He is the operator. Through this instrument He is rousing the&#xA;religious instinct in thousands of hearts in this far-off country.&#xA;Thousands of men and women here love and revere me. . . . &amp;ldquo;मूकं करोति&#xA;वाचालं पङ्गुं लङ्घते गिरिम् — He makes the dumb eloquent and makes the&#xA;lame cross mountains.&amp;rdquo; I am amazed at His grace. Whichever town I visit,&#xA;it is in an uproar. They have named me &amp;ldquo;the cyclonic Hindu&amp;rdquo;. Remember,&#xA;it is His will — I am a voice without a form.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It is a great pleasure to me to&#xA;learn that you have regained your health to a great extent by your stay&#xA;at Khetri.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Brother Tarak (Shivananda) has done a good deal of work in Madras. Very&#xA;agreeable news indeed! I heard much praise of him from the people of&#xA;Madras. . . .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

BULL,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I arrived safely in New York where Landsberg met me at the depot. I&#xA;proceeded at once to Brooklyn where I arrived in time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We had a nice evening. Several gentlemen belonging to the Ethical&#xA;Culture Society came to see me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Next Sunday we shall have a lecture. Dr. Janes was as usual very kind&#xA;and good, and Mr. Higgins is as practical as ever. Here alone in New&#xA;York I find more men interested in religion than in any other city, and&#xA;do not know why here the interest is more amongst men than women. . . .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I have&#xA;got the bill of lading; but it will be long before the goods arrive.&#xA;Unless one arranges for the prompt despatch of goods they take about six&#xA;months to come. It is four months since Haramohan wrote that the&#xA;Rudrāksha beads and Kusha mats had been despatched, but there is no news&#xA;of their whereabouts yet. The thing is, when the goods reach England,&#xA;the agent of the company here gives me notice; and about a month later,&#xA;the goods arrive. I received your bill of lading about three weeks ago,&#xA;but no sign of the notice! Only the goods sent by Raja of Khetri arrive&#xA;quickly. Most probably he spends a lot of money for them. However it is&#xA;a matter of congratulation that goods do arrive without fail in this&#xA;region of Pātāla, at the other end of the globe. I shall let you know as&#xA;soon as the goods come. Now keep quiet for at least three months.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Paramahamsa Deva was my Guru, and whatever I may think of him in&#xA;point of greatness, why should the world think like me? And if you press&#xA;the point hard, you will spoil everything. The idea of worshipping the&#xA;Guru as God is nowhere to be met with outside Bengal, for other people&#xA;are not yet ready to take up that ideal. . . . Many would fain associate&#xA;my name with themselves — &amp;ldquo;I belong to them!&amp;rdquo; But when it comes to doing&#xA;something I want, they are nowhere. So selfish is the whole world!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But I sincerely believe that you ought to turn&#xA;all your help to Miss Farmer&amp;rsquo;s Greenacre work this year. India can wait&#xA;as she is waiting centuries and an immediate work at hand should always&#xA;have the preference.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

BULL,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am astonished to hear the scandals the Ramabai circles are indulging&#xA;in about me. Don&amp;rsquo;t you see, Mrs. Bull, that however a man may conduct&#xA;himself, there will always be persons who invent the blackest lies about&#xA;him? At Chicago I had such things every day against me. And these women&#xA;are invariably the very Christian of Christians! . . . I am going to&#xA;have a series of paid lectures in my rooms (downstairs), which will seat&#xA;about a hundred persons, and that will cover the expenses. I am in no&#xA;great hurry about the money to be sent to India. I will wait. Is Miss&#xA;Farmer with you? Is Mrs. Peake at Chicago? Have you seen Josephine&#xA;Locke? Miss Hamlin has been very kind to me and does all she can to help&#xA;me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I am working it up slowly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;lxiii&#34;&gt;LXIII&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Translated from &lt;a href=&#34;b7174e6063.pdf&#34;&gt;Bengali&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;U.S.A.,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;11th April, 1895&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;MY DEAR SHASHI,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;. . . You write that you have recovered from your illness; but you must&#xA;henceforth be very careful. Late dinners or unwholesome food, or living&#xA;in a stinking place may bring on a relapse, and make it hard to escape&#xA;the clutches of malaria. First of all you should hire a small&#xA;garden-house — you may get one for thirty or forty rupees. Secondly, see&#xA;that cooking and drinking water be filtered — a bamboo filter of a big&#xA;size will do. Water is the cause of all sorts of disease. It is not the&#xA;clearness or dirtiness of water, but its being full of disease germs,&#xA;that causes disease. Let the water be boiled and filtered. You must all&#xA;pay attention to your health first. A cook, a servant, clean beds, and&#xA;timely meals — these are absolutely necessary. Please see that all these&#xA;suggestions be carried out &lt;em&gt;in toto&lt;/em&gt;. . . . The success of your&#xA;undertakings depends wholly upon your mutual love. There is no good in&#xA;store so long as malice and jealousy and egotism will prevail. &amp;hellip;&#xA;Kali&amp;rsquo;s pamphlet is very well written and has no exaggerations. Know that&#xA;talking ill of others in private is a sin. You must wholly avoid it.&#xA;Many things may occur to the mind, but it gradually makes a mountain of&#xA;a molehill if you try to express them. Everything is ended if you&#xA;forgive and forget. It is welcome news that Shri Ramakrishna&amp;rsquo;s festival&#xA;was celebrated with great éclat. You must try so that there is a muster&#xA;of a hundred thousand people next year. Put your energies together to&#xA;start a magazine. Shyness won&amp;rsquo;t do any more&amp;hellip;. He who has infinite&#xA;patience and infinite energy at his back, will alone succeed. You must&#xA;pay special attention to study. Do you understand? You must not huddle&#xA;together too many fools. I shall be glad if you bring together a few&#xA;real men. Why, I don&amp;rsquo;t hear even a single one opening his lips. You&#xA;distributed sweets at the festival, and there was singing by some&#xA;parties, mostly idlers. True, but I don&amp;rsquo;t hear what spiritual food you&#xA;have given. So long as that &lt;em&gt;nil admirari&lt;/em&gt; attitude is not gone, you&#xA;will not be able to do anything, and none of you will have courage.&#xA;Bullies are always cowards.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

BULL,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The day before yesterday I received a kind note from Miss Farmer&#xA;including a cheque for a hundred dollars for the Barbar House lectures.&#xA;She is coming to New York next Saturday. I will of course tell her to&#xA;put my name in her circulars; and what is more, I cannot go to Greenacre&#xA;now; I have arranged to go to the Thousand Islands, wherever that may&#xA;be. There is a cottage belonging to Miss Dutcher, one of my students,&#xA;and a few of us will be there in rest and peace and seclusion. I want to&#xA;manufacture a few &amp;ldquo;Yogis&amp;rdquo; out of the materials of the classes, and a&#xA;busy farm like Greenacre is the last place for that, while the other is&#xA;quite out of the way, and none of the curiosity-seekers will dare go&#xA;there.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I will try this&#xA;week and then give up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am going this summer to the Thousand Islands to Miss Dutcher&amp;rsquo;s, one of&#xA;my students. The different books on Vedanta are now being sent over to&#xA;me from India. I expect to write a book in English on the Vedanta&#xA;Philosophy in its three stages when I am at Thousand Islands, and I may&#xA;go to Greenacre later on. Miss Farmer wants me to lecture there this&#xA;summer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

BULL,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am here at last with Mr. Leggett. This is one of the most beautiful&#xA;spots I have ever seen. Imagine a lake, surrounded with hills covered&#xA;with a huge forest, with nobody but ourselves. So lovely, so quiet, so&#xA;restful! And you may imagine how glad I am to be here after the bustle&#xA;of cities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It gives me a new lease of life to be here. I go into the forest alone&#xA;and read my Gita and am quite happy. I will leave this place in about&#xA;ten days and go to the Thousand Island Park. I will meditate by the hour&#xA;there and be all alone to myself. The very idea is ennobling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

BULL,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have just arrived home. The trip did me good, and I enjoyed the&#xA;country and the hills, and especially Mr. Leggett&amp;rsquo;s country-house in New&#xA;York State. Poor Landsberg has gone from this house. Neither has he left&#xA;one his address. May the Lord bless Landsberg wherever he goes! He is&#xA;one of the few sincere souls I have had the privilege in this life to&#xA;come across.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;lxix&#34;&gt;LXIX&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Translated from &lt;a href=&#34;b7189e6069.pdf&#34;&gt;Bengali&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1895&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DEAR SHASHI,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;. . . I am quite in agreement with what Sarada is doing, but it is not&#xA;necessary to preach that Ramakrishna Paramahamsa was an Incarnation, and&#xA;things of that sort. He came to do good to the world; not to trumpet his&#xA;own name — you must always remember this. Disciples pay their whole&#xA;attention to the preservation of their master&amp;rsquo;s name and throw overboard&#xA;his teachings; and sectarianism etc., are the result. Alasinga writes of&#xA;Charu; but I do not recollect him. Write all about him and convey him my&#xA;thanks. Write in detail about all; I have no time to spare for idle&#xA;gossip &amp;hellip;. Try to give up ceremonials. They are not meant for&#xA;Sannyasins; and one must work only so long as one does not attain to&#xA;illumination &amp;hellip;. I have nothing to do with sectarianism. Or&#xA;party-forming and playing the frog-in-the-well, whatever else I may&#xA;do&amp;hellip;. It is impossible to preach the catholic ideas of Ramakrishna&#xA;Paramahamsa and form sects at the same time&amp;hellip;. Only one kind of work I&#xA;understand, and that is doing good to others; all else is doing evil. I&#xA;therefore prostrate myself before the Lord Buddha&amp;hellip;. I am a Vedantist;&#xA;Sachchidananda — Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute — is my God. I&#xA;scarcely find any other God than the majestic form of my own Self. By&#xA;the word &amp;ldquo;Incarnation&amp;rdquo; are meant those who have attained that&#xA;Brahmanhood, in other words, the Jivanmuktas — those who have realised&#xA;this freedom in this very life. I do not find any speciality in&#xA;Incarnations: all beings from Brahmā down to a clump of grass will&#xA;attain to liberation-in-life in course of time, and our duty lies in&#xA;helping all to reach that state. This help is called religion; the rest&#xA;is irreligion. This help is work; the rest is evil-doing — I see nothing&#xA;else. Other kinds of work, for example, the Vaidika or the Tāntrika, may&#xA;produce results; but resorting to them is simply waste of life, for that&#xA;purity which is the goal of work is realisable only through doing good&#xA;to others. Through works such as sacrifices etc., one may get&#xA;enjoyments, but it is impossible to have the purity of soul&amp;hellip;.&#xA;Everything exists already in the Self of all beings. He who asserts he&#xA;is free, shall be free. He who says he is bound, bound he shall remain.&#xA;To me, the thought of oneself as low and humble is a sin and ignorance.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;नायमात्मा बलहीनेन लभ्य: — This Atman is not to be attained by one who&#xA;is weak.&amp;rdquo; अस्ति ब्रह्म वदसि चेदस्ति, नास्ति ब्रह्म बदसि चेन्नास्त्येव —&#xA;If you say Brahman &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;, existence will be the result; if you say&#xA;Brahman &lt;em&gt;is not&lt;/em&gt;, non existent It shall verily become.&amp;quot; He who always&#xA;thinks of himself as weak wild never become strong, but he who knows&#xA;himself to be a lion, &amp;ldquo;निर्गच्छति जगज्जालत् पिञ्जरादिव केशरी — rushes&#xA;out from the world&amp;rsquo;s meshes, as a lion from its cage.&amp;rdquo; Another point, it&#xA;was no new truth that Ramakrishna Paramahamsa came to preach, though his&#xA;advent brought the old truths to light. In other words, he was the&#xA;embodiment of all the past religious thoughts of India. His life alone&#xA;made me understand what the Shāstras really meant, and the whole plan&#xA;and scope of the old Shastras.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Hope you have&#xA;found out all about the scales by this time. I will be so happy to take&#xA;a lesson on the scales from you next time we meet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We had such jolly good time up there at Percy with Mr. Leggett — isn&amp;rsquo;t&#xA;he a saint?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But avail yourselves&#xA;of this stir that is rife all over the country, and scatter yourselves&#xA;in all quarters. In other words, try to start branches at different&#xA;places. Let it not be an empty sound merely. You must join the Madrasis&#xA;and start associations etc., at different places. What about the&#xA;magazine which I heard was going to be started? Why are you nervous&#xA;about conducting it? &amp;hellip; Come? Do something heroic! Brother, what if you&#xA;do not attain Mukti, what if you suffer damnation a few times?

T. STURDY, ESQ.,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;HIGH VIEW, CAVERSHAM,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;1895&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;BELOVED AKHANDANANDA,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am glad to go through the contents of your letter. Your idea is grand&#xA;but our nation is totally lacking in the faculty of organisation. It is&#xA;this one drawback which produces all sorts of evil. We are altogether&#xA;averse to making a common cause for anything. The first requisite for&#xA;organisation is obedience. I do a little bit of work when I feel so&#xA;disposed, and then let it go to the dogs — this kind of work is of no&#xA;avail. We must have plodding industry and perseverance. Keep a regular&#xA;correspondence, I mean, make it a point to write to me every month, or&#xA;twice a month, what work you are doing and what has been its outcome. We&#xA;want here (in England) a Sannyasin well-versed in English and Sanskrit.&#xA;I shall soon go to America again, and he is to work here in my absence.&#xA;Except Sharat and Shashi — I find no one else for this task. I have sent&#xA;money to Sharat and written to him to start at once. I have requested&#xA;Rajaji that his Bombay agent may help Sharat in embarking. I forgot to&#xA;write — but if you can take the trouble to do it, please send through&#xA;Sharat a bag of Mung, gram, and Arhar Dāl, also a little of the spice&#xA;called Methi. Please convey my love to Pundit Narayan Das, Mr. Shankar&#xA;Lal, Ojhaji, Doctor, and all. Do you think you can get the medicine for&#xA;Gopi&amp;rsquo;s eyes here? — Everywhere you find patent medicines, which are all&#xA;humbug. Please give my blessings to him and to the other boys.&#xA;Yajneshwar has founded a certain society at Meerut and wants to work&#xA;conjointly with us. By the bye, he has got a certain paper too; send&#xA;Kali there, and let him start a Meerut centre, if he can and, try to&#xA;have a paper in Hindi. I shall help a little now and then. I shall send&#xA;some money when Kali goes to Meerut and reports to me exactly how&#xA;matters stand. Try to open a centre at Ajmer. &amp;hellip; Pundit Agnihotri has&#xA;started some society at Saharanpur. They wrote me a letter. Please keep&#xA;in correspondence with them. Live on friendly terms with all. Work!&#xA;Work! Go on opening centres in this way. We have them already in&#xA;Calcutta and Madras, and it will be excellent if you can start new ones&#xA;at Meerut and Ajmer. Go on slowly starting centres at different places&#xA;like that. Here all my letters etc., are to be addressed in care of E.&#xA;T. Sturdy, Esq., High View, Caversham, Reading, England, and those for&#xA;America, C/o Miss Phillips, 19 W. 38 Street, New York. By degrees we&#xA;must spread the world over. The first thing needed is obedience. You&#xA;must be ready to plunge into fire — then will work be done. &amp;hellip; Form&#xA;societies like that at different villages in Rajputana. There you have a&#xA;hint.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The books that Sanyal sent have arrived. I forgot to mention this.&#xA;Please inform him about it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let me write down something for you all:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1. Know partiality to be the chief cause of all evil. That is to say,&#xA;if you show towards any one more love than towards somebody else, rest&#xA;assured, you will be sowing the seeds of future troubles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2. If anybody comes to you to speak ill of any of his brothers, refuse&#xA;to listen to him &lt;em&gt;in toto&lt;/em&gt;. It is a great sin to listen even. In that&#xA;lies the germ of future troubles.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

No matter&#xA;whether there is any work done in India or not, the real work lies here.&#xA;I do not want anybody to come over now. On my return to India I shall&#xA;train a few men, and after that there will be no danger for them in the&#xA;West. Yes, it was of Gunanidhi that I wrote. Give my special love and&#xA;blessings to Hari Singh and others. Never take part in quarrels and&#xA;disputes. Who on earth possesses the power to put the Raja of Khetri&#xA;down? — The Divine Mother is at his elbow! I have received Kali&amp;rsquo;s letter&#xA;too. It will be very good indeed if you can start a centre in Kashmir.&#xA;Wherever you can, open a centre&amp;hellip;. Now I have laid the foundations firm&#xA;here and in England, and nobody has the power to shake them. New York is&#xA;in a commotion this year. Next year will come the turn of London. Even&#xA;big giants will give way, who counts your pigmies! Gird up your loins&#xA;and set yourselves to work! We must throw the world into convulsions&#xA;with our triumphal shouts. This is but the beginning, my boy. Do you&#xA;think there are &lt;em&gt;men&lt;/em&gt; in our country, it is a &lt;em&gt;Golgotha&lt;/em&gt;! There is some&#xA;chance if you can impart education to the masses. Is there a greater&#xA;strength than that of Knowledge? Can you give them education? Name me&#xA;the country where rich men ever helped anybody! In all countries it is&#xA;the middle classes that do all great works. How long will it take to&#xA;raise the money? Where are the &lt;em&gt;men&lt;/em&gt;? Are there any in our country? Our&#xA;countrymen are boys, and even must treat them as such&amp;hellip;. There are some&#xA;few religious and philosophical books left — the remnants of the mansion&#xA;that has been burnt down; take them with you, quick and come over to&#xA;this country. &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I am much better now. Through the grace&#xA;of the Lord I am proof against the severe cold for this year. Oh, the&#xA;terrible cold! But these people keep all down through scientific&#xA;knowledge. Every house has its cellar underground, in which there is a&#xA;big boiler whence steam is made to course day and night through every&#xA;room. This keeps all the rooms warm, but it has one defect, that while&#xA;it is summer indoors, it is 30 to 40 degrees below zero outside! Most of&#xA;the rich people of this country make for Europe during the winter, which&#xA;is comparatively warm.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There are two defects in the letters which&#xA;you all write, specially in yours. The first is that very few of the&#xA;important points I ask are answered. Secondly, there is unusual delay in&#xA;replying. . . . I have to work day and night, and am always whirling&#xA;from place to place besides&amp;hellip;. These are countries where the people are&#xA;most luxurious, fashionable folk, and nobody would touch a man who has&#xA;but a speck of dirt on his body. &amp;hellip; I hoped that somebody would come&#xA;while I was still here, but as yet nothing has been settled I see. &amp;hellip;&#xA;Business is business, that is, you must do everything promptly; delay&#xA;and shuffling won&amp;rsquo;t do. By the end of next week I shall go to America,&#xA;so there is no chance of my meeting him who is coming. . . . These are&#xA;countries of gigantic scholars. Is it a joke to make disciples of such&#xA;people? You are but children and talk like children. Only this much is&#xA;needed that there should be someone to teach a little Sanskrit, or&#xA;translate a bit in my absence, that&amp;rsquo;s all. Why not let Girish Babu visit&#xA;these lands? It is a good idea. It will cost him but 3000 rupees to&#xA;visit England and America, and go back. The more people come to these&#xA;countries, the better. But then it sets my nerves on edge to look at&#xA;those who don hats and pose as &lt;em&gt;Sahibs&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I am in receipt of Rakhal&amp;rsquo;s letter today. I am sorry to hear that&#xA;— has suffered from gravel. Most probably it was due to indigestion.&#xA;Gopal&amp;rsquo;s debts have been cleared; now ask him to join the monastic order.&#xA;The worldly-wise instinct is most difficult to root out. . . . Let him&#xA;come and work in the Math. One is apt to imbibe a lot of mischievous&#xA;ideas by concerning oneself too long in worldly affairs. If he refuses&#xA;to take the monastic vow, please tell him to clear out. I don&amp;rsquo;t want&#xA;amphibious type of men who will be half monks and half householders. . .&#xA;. Haramohan has coined a &lt;em&gt;Lord&lt;/em&gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, I see. What&#xA;does he mean? English Lord, or Duke? Tell Rakhal, let people say&#xA;whatever they will — &amp;ldquo;Men (who wrongly criticise) are to be treated as&#xA;worms!&amp;rdquo; as Shri Ramakrishna used to say. Let there be no disparity&#xA;between what you profess and what you do, also eschew the very name of&#xA;Jesuitism. Was I ever an orthodox, Paurānika Hindu, an adherent of&#xA;social usages? I do not pose as one. You will not have to say things&#xA;that will be &lt;em&gt;pleasant&lt;/em&gt; to any section of people. You must not so much&#xA;as notice what the Bengalis say for or against us. . . . They could not&#xA;do a penny-worth of service to him whose birth has sanctified their&#xA;country where the primary laws of health and sanitation are trampled,&#xA;and yet they would talk big! What matters is, my brother, what such men&#xA;have got to say! . . . It is for you to go on doing your own work. Why&#xA;look up to men for approbation, look up to God! I hope Sharat will be&#xA;able to teach them the Gita and the Upanishads and their commentaries&#xA;somehow, with the help of the dictionary. — Or, is it an empty Vairāgya&#xA;that you have? The days of such Vairagya are gone! It is not for&#xA;everyone, my boy, to become Ramakrishna Paramahamsa! I hope Sharat has&#xA;started by this time. Please send a copy of the &lt;em&gt;Panchadashi&lt;/em&gt;, a copy of&#xA;the Gita (with as many commentaries as possible), a copy each of the&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Nārada&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Shāndilya Sutras&lt;/em&gt; (published in Varanasi), a translation&#xA;(good, not worthless) of the &lt;em&gt;Panchadashi&lt;/em&gt; — if it is available — and&#xA;the translation by Kālivara Vedāntavāgisha of Shankara&amp;rsquo;s Commentary. And&#xA;if there be any translation, Bengali or English (by Shrish Babu of&#xA;Allahabad), of Pānini&amp;rsquo;s Sutras, or the &lt;em&gt;Kāshikā-Vritti&lt;/em&gt;, or the&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Phani-Bhāshya&lt;/em&gt;, please send a copy of each. &amp;hellip; Now, just tell your&#xA;Bengalis to send me a copy of the &lt;em&gt;Vāchaspatya&lt;/em&gt; Dictionary, and that&#xA;will be a good test for those tall-talking people. In England, religious&#xA;movements make very slow progress. These people here are either bigots&#xA;or atheists. And the former again have only a bit of formal religion.&#xA;They say, &amp;ldquo;Patriotism is our religion.&amp;rdquo; That is all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Your suggestion to me to go back to India is no doubt right, but a&#xA;seed has been sown in this country, and there is the possibility of its&#xA;being nipped in the bud if I go away all on a sudden. Hence I have to&#xA;wait some time. Moreover it will be possible to manage everything nicely&#xA;from here. Everybody requests me to return to India. It is all right,&#xA;but don&amp;rsquo;t you see it is not wise to depend upon others. A wise man&#xA;should stand firm on his own legs and act. Everything will come about&#xA;slowly. For the present don&amp;rsquo;t forget to be on the look-out for a site.&#xA;We want a big plot — of about ten to twenty thousand rupees — it must be&#xA;right on the Ganga. Though my capital is small, I am exceedingly bold.&#xA;Have an eye on securing the land. At present we shall have to work three&#xA;centres, one in New York, another in Calcutta and a third in Madras.&#xA;Then, by degrees, as the Lord will arrange. &amp;hellip; You must keep a strict&#xA;eye on your health; let everything else be subordinated to that. &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

BULL,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Sturdy and I want to get hold of a few of the best, say, strong and&#xA;intelligent men in England to form a society, and therefore we must&#xA;proceed slowly. We must take care not to be run over with &amp;ldquo;fads&amp;rdquo; from&#xA;the first. This you will know has been my policy in America too. Mr.&#xA;Sturdy has been in India living with our Sannyasins in their manner for&#xA;some time. He is an exceedingly energetic man, educated and well versed&#xA;in Sanskrit. &amp;hellip; So far so good. &amp;hellip; Purity, perseverance, and energy —&#xA;these three I want, and if I get only half a dozen here, my work will go&#xA;on. I have a great chance of such a few.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It is excellent work that you are&#xA;doing. R— is very liberal and openhanded, but no advantage should be&#xA;taken over him for that reason. About the raising of funds by Shrimān —,&#xA;well, it is a fair enterprise; but my boy, this is a very queer world,&#xA;where even the World-Gods Brahmā and Vishnu find it difficult to evade&#xA;the clutches of lust and gold. Wherever there is any the least concern&#xA;with money, there is the chance for misunderstanding. Let therefore&#xA;nobody undertake such work as raising money on behalf of the Math. &amp;hellip;&#xA;Whenever you hear of any householder collecting funds in my or our name&#xA;on the plea of erecting a Math, or some such thing, the first thing you&#xA;should do is to distrust him, and never set your hand to it. The more&#xA;so, as householders of poor means take to various tricks to supply their&#xA;wants. Therefore, if ever a trusty devotee or a householder with a&#xA;heart, being of affluent circumstances, undertakes such works as the&#xA;founding of a Math, or if the funds raised be kept in the custody of a&#xA;trusty householder of wealth — well and good, otherwise never have a&#xA;hand in it. On the contrary, you must dissuade others from such a thing.&#xA;You are but a boy and are ignorant of the snare of gold. Opportunities&#xA;will turn even a staunch moralist into a cheat. This is the way of the&#xA;world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;lxxxvii&#34;&gt;LXXXVII&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;R.M.S. &amp;ldquo;Britannic&amp;rdquo;,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Thursday morning, Dec. 5, 1895.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DEAR ALBERTA,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Received your nice letter last evening. Very kind of you to remember me.&#xA;I am going soon to see the &amp;ldquo;Heavenly Pair&amp;rdquo;. Mr. Leggett is a saint as I&#xA;have told you already, and your mother is a born empress, every inch of&#xA;her, with a saint&amp;rsquo;s heart inside.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am so glad you are enjoying the Alps so much They must be wonderful.&#xA;It is always in such places that the human soul aspires for freedom.&#xA;Even if the nation is spiritually poor, it aspires for physical freedom.&#xA;I met a young Swiss in London. He used to come to my classes. I was very&#xA;successful in London, and though I did not care for the noisy city, I&#xA;was very much pleased with the people. In your country, Alberta, the&#xA;Vedantic thought was introduced in the beginning by ignorant &amp;ldquo;cranks&amp;rdquo;,&#xA;and one has to work his way through the difficulties created by such&#xA;introductions. You may have noticed that only a few men or women of the&#xA;upper classes ever joined my classes in America. Again in America the&#xA;upper classes being the rich, their whole time is spent in enjoying&#xA;their wealth and imitating (aping?) the Europeans. On the other hand in&#xA;England the Vedantic ideas have been introduced by the most learned men&#xA;in the country, and there are a large number among the upper classes in&#xA;England who are very thoughtful. So you will be astonished to hear that&#xA;I found my grounds all prepared, and I am convinced that my work will&#xA;have more hold on England than America. Add to this the tremendous&#xA;tenacity of the English character, and judge for yourself. By this you&#xA;will find that I have changed a good deal of my opinion about England,&#xA;and I am glad to confess it. I am perfectly sure that we will do still&#xA;better in Germany. I am coming back to England next summer. In the&#xA;meanwhile my work is in very able hands. Joe Joe has been the same kind&#xA;good pure friend to me here as in America, and my debt to your family is&#xA;simply immense. My love and blessings to Hollister and you. The steamer&#xA;is standing at anchor on account of fog. The purser has very kindly&#xA;given me a whole cabin by myself. Every Hindu is a Raja, they think, and&#xA;are very polite — and the charm will break, of course, when they find&#xA;that the Raja is penniless!!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

BULL,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many thanks for your kind note of welcome. I arrived last Friday after&#xA;ten days of a very tedious voyage. It was awfully rough and for the&#xA;first time in my life I was very badly seasick. . . . I have left some&#xA;strong friends in England who will work in my absence expecting my&#xA;arrival next summer. My plans are not settled yet about the work here.&#xA;Only I have an idea to run to Detroit and Chicago meanwhile, and then&#xA;come back to New York. The public lecture plan I intend to give up&#xA;entirely, as I find the best thing for me to do is to step entirely out&#xA;of the money question — either in public lectures or private classes. In&#xA;the long run it does harm and sets a bad example.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;xc&#34;&gt;XC&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;29th Dec., 1895.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DEAR SISTER, (Miss S. Farmer)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this universe where nothing is lost, where we live in the midst of&#xA;death &lt;em&gt;in life&lt;/em&gt;, every thought that is thought, in public or in private,&#xA;in crowded thoroughfares or in the deep recesses of primeval forests,&#xA;lives. They are continuously trying to become self-embodied, and until&#xA;they have embodied themselves, they will struggle for expression, and&#xA;any amount of repression cannot kill them. Nothing can be destroyed —&#xA;those thoughts that caused evil in the past are also seeking embodiment,&#xA;to be filtered through repeated expression and, at last, transfigured&#xA;into perfect good.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Apply yourself to it&#xA;heart and soul. . . . Never mind the funds. . . . There are many to&#xA;preach Christianity and Mohammedanism — you just go through the&#xA;preaching of your own country&amp;rsquo;s religion. But then if you can get hold&#xA;of a Mohammedan who is versed in Arabic and have old Arabic books&#xA;translated, it will be a good plan. There is much of Indian history in&#xA;the Persian language. If you can have the books translated bit by bit,&#xA;it will be a good regular item. We want quite a number of writers, then&#xA;there is the difficult task of getting subscribers. The way out is this:&#xA;You lead a wandering life; wherever you find Bengali language spoken,&#xA;thrust the paper on whomsoever you can lay your hands on. Enlist them by&#xA;vehemence! — they would always turn tail the moment they have to spend&#xA;something. Never mind anything! Push it on! Begin to contribute&#xA;articles, all of you who can. It won&amp;rsquo;t do merely to sit idle. You have&#xA;done a heroic deed! Bravo! Those who falter and vacillate will lag&#xA;behind, and you will jump straight on top of all! Those that are working&#xA;for their own salvation will neither have their own nor that of others.&#xA;Let the commotion that you make be such as to resound to the world&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;end. There are people who are ready to pick holes in everything, but&#xA;when it comes to the question of work, not a scent of them can be had!&#xA;To work! — as far as in you lies! Then I shall go to India and move the&#xA;whole country. What fear! &amp;ldquo;Even a snake loses its venom if it is&#xA;insisted that it has none.&amp;rdquo; These people will go on the negative track,&#xA;till they are actually reduced to nothing! . . .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I am very sorry to hear that your health is not yet all right. Can&#xA;you go to a very cold climate where there is plenty of snowfall in the&#xA;winter, Darjeeling, for instance? The severity of the cold will set your&#xA;stomach right, as it has done in my case. And can you give up altogether&#xA;the habit of using ghee and spices? Butter digests more quickly than&#xA;ghee. &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

BULL,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your letter to Sturdy has been sent over to me. It was very kind of you&#xA;to write that note. This year, I am afraid, I am getting overworked, as&#xA;I feel the strain. I want a rest badly. So it is very good, as you say,&#xA;that the Boston work be taken up in the end of March. By the end of&#xA;April I will start for England.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The dictionary&#xA;that Shashi sent a few months ago has not arrived so far. &amp;hellip; I am going&#xA;to England soon. Sharat need not come now at all; for I am myself going&#xA;to England. I do not want people who take such a long time to make up&#xA;their minds. I did not invite him for a European tour, and I do not have&#xA;the money either. So ask him not to come, and none else need.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

BULL,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your kind note was duly received. I had beautiful visits with my friends&#xA;and have already held several classes. I shall have a few more and then&#xA;start on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Everything has been well arranged here, thanks to the kindness of Miss&#xA;Adams. She is so, so good and kind.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am suffering from slight fever the last two days; so I can&amp;rsquo;t write a&#xA;long letter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

BULL,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; Here is a curious person who comes to me with a letter from Bombay.&#xA;He is a practical mechanic and his one idea is to see cutlery and other&#xA;iron manufactories in this country&amp;hellip;. I do not know anything about him,&#xA;but even if he be a rogue, I like very much to foster this sort of&#xA;adventurous spirit among my countrymen. He has money enough to pay his&#xA;way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Your contribution is good, go on writing regularly. &amp;hellip; It is&#xA;very easy to search for faults, but the characteristic of a saint lies&#xA;in looking for merits — never forget this. &amp;hellip; You need a little&#xA;business faculty. &amp;hellip; Now what you want is organisation — that requires&#xA;strict obedience and division of labour. I shall write out everything in&#xA;every particular from England, for which I start tomorrow. I am&#xA;determined to make you decent workers thoroughly organised. &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Day before yesterday I had a fine visit with Prof. Max Müller. He&#xA;is a saintly man and looks like a young man in spite of his seventy&#xA;years, and his face is without a wrinkle. I wish I had half his love for&#xA;India and Vedanta. At the same time he is a friend of Yoga too and&#xA;believes in it. Only he has no patience with humbugs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Saradananda goes to the&#xA;States soon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do not like any one whom I love to become a lawyer, although my father&#xA;was one. My Master was against it, and I believe that that family is&#xA;sure to come to grief where there are several lawyers. Our country is&#xA;full of them; the universities turn them out by the hundreds. What my&#xA;nation wants is pluck and scientific genius. So I want Mohin to be an&#xA;electrician. Even if he fails in life, still I will have the&#xA;satisfaction that he strove to become great and really useful to his&#xA;country. &amp;hellip; In &lt;em&gt;America alone&lt;/em&gt; there is that something in the air which&#xA;brings out whatever is best in every one. &amp;hellip; I want him to be daring,&#xA;bold, and to struggle to cut a new path for himself and his nation. An&#xA;electrical engineer can make a living in India.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The work here is coming to a head.&#xA;We have already got funds to start a London Centre. Next month I go to&#xA;Switzerland to pass a month or two there, then I shall return to London.&#xA;What will be the good of my going home? — This London is the hub of the&#xA;world. The heart of India is here. How can I leave without laying a sure&#xA;foundation here? Nonsense! For the present, I shall have Kali here, tell&#xA;him to be ready. &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The&#xA;season has ended and I too am thoroughly exhausted. I am going to make a&#xA;tour in Switzerland with Miss Müller. The Galsworthys have been very&#xA;very kind. Joe (Miss Josephine MacLeod, also referred to as Joe Joe.)&#xA;brought them round splendidly. I simply admire Joe in her tact and quiet&#xA;way. She is a feminine statesman or woman. She can wield a kingdom. I&#xA;have seldom seen such strong yet good common sense in a human being. I&#xA;will return next autumn and take up the work in America.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

They would have given £500 on the spot if wanted, but we want to&#xA;go slow, and not rush into expense. There will be many hands here to&#xA;carry on the work, and they understand a bit of renunciation, here — the&#xA;deep English character.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

BULL,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I want to forget the world entirely at least for the next two months and&#xA;practice hard. That is my rest. &amp;hellip; The mountains and snow have a&#xA;beautifully quieting influence on me, and I am getting better sleep here&#xA;than for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My love to all friends.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yours etc.,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;VIVEKANANDA.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The letter was actually written from&#xA;Switzerland.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many thanks for your kind greetings. I have an inquiry to make; if you&#xA;kindly forward me the information I seek, I would be much obliged.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I want to start a Math at Almora or near Almora rather. I have heard&#xA;that there was a certain Mr. Ramsay who lived in a bungalow near Almora&#xA;and that he had a garden round his bungalow. Can&amp;rsquo;t it be bought? What is&#xA;the price? If not to be bought, can it be rented?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Moreover, in&#xA;his opinion one day should be appointed for men and another for women.&#xA;My decision on the point is this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1. If public women are not allowed to go to such a great place of&#xA;pilgrimage as Dakshineswar, where else shall they go to? It is for the&#xA;sinful that the Lord manifests Himself specially, not so much for the&#xA;virtuous.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;cvii&#34;&gt;CVII&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;LUCERNE, SWITZERLAND,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;23rd August, 1896&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DEAR MRS. BULL,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I received your last today. By this time you must have received my&#xA;receipt for £5 you sent. I do not know what membership you mean. I have&#xA;no objection to have my name to be put on the list of membership of any&#xA;society. As for Sturdy, I do not know what his opinions are. I am now&#xA;travelling in Switzerland; from hence I go to Germany, then to England,&#xA;and next winter to India. I am very glad to hear that Saradananda and&#xA;Goodwin are doing good work in the U.S. As for me, I do not lay any&#xA;claim to that £500 for any work. I think I have worked enough. I am now&#xA;going to retire. I have sent for another man from India who will join me&#xA;next month. I have begun the work, let others work it out. So you see,&#xA;to set the work going I had to touch money and property, for a time. Now&#xA;I am sure my part of the work is done, and I have no more interest in&#xA;Vedanta or any philosophy in the world or the work itself. I am getting&#xA;ready to depart to return no more to this hell, this world. Even its&#xA;religious utility is beginning to pall me. May Mother gather me soon to&#xA;Herself never to come back any more! These works, and doing good, etc.,&#xA;are just a little exercise to cleanse the mind. I had enough of it. This&#xA;world will be world ever and always. What we are, so we see it. Who&#xA;works? Whose work? There is no world. It is God Himself. In delusion we&#xA;call it world. Neither I nor thou nor you — it is all He the Lord, all&#xA;One. So I do not want anything to do about money matters from this time.&#xA;It is your money. You spend what comes to you just as you like, and&#xA;blessings follow you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I am very, very happy to learn that at last you have&#xA;thought it better to change your mind about the felicity of &amp;ldquo;Old Maids&#xA;Home&amp;rdquo;. You are perfectly right now — marriage is the truest goal for&#xA;ninety-nine per cent of the human race, and they will live the happiest&#xA;life as soon as they have learnt and are ready to abide by the eternal&#xA;lesson — that we are bound to bear and forbear and that life to every&#xA;one must be a compromise.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For what is space in the realm&#xA;of spirit? Well, you are gone to your home of rest and peace. For me,&#xA;ever-increasing mad work; yet I have your blessings with me always, have&#xA;I not? My natural tendency is to go into a cave and be quiet, but a fate&#xA;behind pushes me forward and I go. Whoever could resist fate?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

My European work in fact is becoming more satisfactory to&#xA;me than any other work, and it tells immensely on India. The London&#xA;classes were resumed, and today is the opening lecture. I now have a&#xA;hall to myself holding two hundred or more. &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Although I am in full sympathy with the various branches of&#xA;religious and social work, I find that specification of work is&#xA;absolutely necessary. Our special branch is to preach Vedanta. Helping&#xA;in other work should be subservient to that one ideal. I hope you will&#xA;inculcate this in the mind of Saradananda very strongly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Two of them, Mr. and Mrs. Sevier,&#xA;are going to settle in Almora. They are my disciples, you know, and they&#xA;are going to build the Goliath for me in the Himalayas. It was for that&#xA;reason I asked you to look for some suitable site. We want a whole hill,&#xA;with a view of the snow-range, all to ourselves. It would of course take&#xA;time to fix on the site and complete the building. In the meanwhile will&#xA;you kindly engage a small bungalow for my friends? The bungalow ought to&#xA;accommodate three persons. I do not require a large one. A small one&#xA;would do for the present. My friends will live in this bungalow in&#xA;Almora and then go about looking for a site and building.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I feel impelled to write a few lines to you before my departure&#xA;for India. The work in London has been a roaring success. The English&#xA;are not so bright as the Americans, but once you touch their heart, it&#xA;is yours for ever. Slowly have I gained, and it is strange that in six&#xA;months&amp;rsquo; work altogether I would have a steady class of 120 persons apart&#xA;from public lectures. Here every one means work — the practical&#xA;Englishman. Capt. and Mrs. Sevier and Mr. Goodwin are going to India&#xA;with me to work and spend their own money on it! There are scores here&#xA;ready to do the same: men and women of position, ready to give up&#xA;everything for the idea, once they feel convinced! And last though not&#xA;the least, the help in the shape of money to start my &amp;ldquo;work&amp;rdquo; in India&#xA;has come and more will follow. My ideas about the English have been&#xA;revolutionized. I now understand why the Lord has blessed them above all&#xA;other races. They are steady, sincere to the backbone, with great depths&#xA;of feeling — only with a crust of stoicism on the surface; if that is&#xA;broken, you have your man.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;cxviii&#34;&gt;CXVIII&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;39 VICTORIA STREET, LONDON,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;9th Dec., 1896.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DEAR MRS. BULL,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is needless to express my gratitude at your most generous offer. I&#xA;don&amp;rsquo;t want to encumber myself with a large amount of money at the first&#xA;start, but as things progress on I will be very glad to find employment&#xA;for that sum. My idea is to start on a very small scale. I do not know&#xA;anything yet. I will know my bearings when on the spot in India. From&#xA;India I will write to you more details about my plans and the practical&#xA;way to realise them. I start on the 16th and after a few days in Italy&#xA;take the steamer at Naples.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It is fit that it should&#xA;be so — the time and the place considering. May all blessings follow her&#xA;through life. She was keenly desired, prayed for, and she comes as a&#xA;blessing to you and to your wife for life. I have not the least doubt.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wish I could have come to America now if only to fulfil the form &amp;ldquo;the&#xA;sages of the East bringing presents to the Western baby&amp;rdquo;. But the heart&#xA;is there with all prayers and blessings, and the mind is more powerful&#xA;than the body.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;cxxi&#34;&gt;CXXI&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;RAMNAD,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;30th Jan., 1897.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;MY DEAR MARY,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Things are turning out most curiously for me. From Colombo in Ceylon,&#xA;where I landed, to Ramnad, the nearly southernmost point of the Indian&#xA;continent where I am just now as the guest of the Raja of Ramnad, my&#xA;journey has been a huge procession — crowds of people, illuminations,&#xA;addresses, etc., etc. A monument forty feet high is being built on the&#xA;spot where I landed. The Raja of Ramnad has presented his address to&#xA;&amp;ldquo;His most Holiness&amp;rdquo; in a huge casket of solid gold beautifully worked.&#xA;Madras and Calcutta are on the tiptoe of expectation as if the whole&#xA;nation is rising to honour me. So you see, Mary, I am on the very height&#xA;of my destiny, yet the mind turns to quietness and peace, to the days we&#xA;had in Chicago, of rest, of peace, and love; and that is why I write&#xA;just now, and may this find you all in health and peace! I wrote a&#xA;letter to my people from London to receive Dr. Barrows kindly. They&#xA;accorded him a big reception, but it was not my fault that he could not&#xA;make any impression there. The Calcutta people are a hard-headed lot!&#xA;Now Barrows thinks a world of me, I hear! Such is the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

BULL,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Saradananda sends £20 to be placed in the famine relief in India. But as&#xA;there is famine in his own home, I thought it best to relieve that&#xA;first, as the old proverb says. So it has been employed accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have not a moment to die as they stay, what with processions and&#xA;tomtomings and various other methods of reception all over the country;&#xA;I am almost dead. As soon as the Birthday is over I will fly off to the&#xA;hills. I received an address from the Cambridge Conference as well as&#xA;one from the Brooklyn Ethical Association. One from the Vedanta&#xA;Association of New York, as mentioned in Dr. Janes&amp;rsquo;s letter, has not yet&#xA;arrived.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;cxxiii&#34;&gt;CXXIII&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DARJEELING,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;April 28, 1897&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DEAR MARY,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few days ago I received your beautiful letter. Yesterday came the card&#xA;announcing Harriet&amp;rsquo;s marriage. Lord bless the happy pair!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The whole country here rose like one man to receive me. Hundreds of&#xA;thousands of persons, shouting and cheering at every place, Rajas&#xA;drawing my carriage, arches all over the streets of the capitals with&#xA;blazing mottoes etc.,!!! The whole thing will soon come out in the form&#xA;of a book, and you will have a copy soon. But unfortunately I was&#xA;already exhausted by hard work in England; and this tremendous exertion&#xA;in the heat of Southern India prostrated me completely. I had of course&#xA;to give up the idea of visiting other parts of India and fly up to the&#xA;nearest hill station, Darjeeling. Now I feel much better, and a month&#xA;more in Almora would complete the cure. By the bye, I have just lost a&#xA;chance of coming over to Europe. Raja Ajit Singh and several other Rajas&#xA;start next Saturday for England. Of course, they wanted hard to get me&#xA;to go over with them. But unfortunately the doctors would not hear of my&#xA;undertaking any physical or mental labour just now. So with the greatest&#xA;chagrin I had to give it up, reserving it for a near future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I hear some unavoidable domestic grief has come upon you. To you,  a man&#xA;of wisdom, what can this misery do? Yet the amenities of friendly&#xA;intercourse, incidental to relative existence in this world, require my&#xA;making mention of it. Those moments of grief, however, very often bring&#xA;out a better spiritual realisation. As if for a while the clouds&#xA;withdraw and the sun of truth shines out. In the case of some, half of&#xA;the bondage is loosened. Of all bondages the greatest is that of&#xA;position — the fear of reputation is stronger than the fear of death;&#xA;but even this bondage appears to relax a little. As if the mind sees for&#xA;a moment that it is much better to listen to the indwelling Lord than to&#xA;the opinions of men. But again the clouds close up, and this indeed is&#xA;Māyā.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

As for myself I am quite content. I have roused a good many of our&#xA;people, and that was all I wanted. Let things have their course and&#xA;Karma its sway. I have no bonds here below. I have seen life, and it is&#xA;all self — life is for self, love for self, honour for self, everything&#xA;for self. I look back and scarcely find any action I have done for self&#xA;— even my wicked deeds were not for self. So I am content; not that I&#xA;feel I have done anything specially good or great, but the world is so&#xA;little, life so mean a thing, existence so, so servile — that I wonder&#xA;and smile that human beings, rational souls, should be running after&#xA;this self — so mean and detestable a prize.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

That it must be free from exaggeration, in other words, statements&#xA;to the effect that she is God&amp;rsquo;s regent and so forth, which are so common&#xA;to us natives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It is that sort of work which can conquer the world. What do&#xA;differences of sect and opinion matter? Bravo! Accept a hundred thousand&#xA;embraces and blessings from me. Work, work, work — I care for nothing&#xA;else. Work, work, work, even unto death! Those that are weak must make&#xA;themselves great workers, great heroes — never mind money, it will drop&#xA;from the heavens. Let them whose gifts you will accept, give in their&#xA;own name if they like, no harm. Whose name, and what is it worth? Who&#xA;cares for name? Off with it! If in the attempt to carry morsels of food&#xA;to starving mouths, name and possession and all be doomed even — अहो&#xA;भाग्यमहो भाग्यम् — thrice blessed art thou! It is the heart, the heart&#xA;that conquers, not the brain. Books and learning, Yoga and meditation&#xA;and illumination — all are but dust compared with love. It is love that&#xA;gives you the supernatural powers, love that gives you Bhakti, love that&#xA;gives illumination, and love, again, that reads to emancipation. This&#xA;indeed is worship, worship of the Lord in the human tabernacle, &amp;ldquo;नेदं&#xA;यदिदमुपासते — not this that people worship&amp;rdquo;. (That is things other than&#xA;God.) This is but the beginning, and unless we spread over the whole of&#xA;India, nay, the whole earth, in that way, where lies the greatness of&#xA;our Lord!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Well, it is&#xA;seldom that Brother Yogen reports the bare truths, so do not at all be&#xA;anxious to hear them. I am all right now, with plenty of muscular&#xA;strength, and no thirst. &amp;hellip; The liver, too, acts well. I am not certain&#xA;as to what effects Shashi (Babu)&amp;rsquo;s medicine had. So I have stopped using&#xA;it. I am having plenty of mangoes. I am getting exceptionally adept in&#xA;riding, and do not feel the least pain or exhaustion even after a run of&#xA;twenty or thirty miles at a stretch. Milk I have altogether stopped for&#xA;fear of corpulence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The rules and regulations portion (which the members&#xA;of our Association had read) is full of mistakes. Correct it very&#xA;carefully and reprint it, or people will laugh.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;. . . The kind of work that is going on at Berhampore is exceedingly&#xA;nice. It is those works that will triumph — can doctrines and dogmas&#xA;touch the heart? Work, work — live the life; what do doctrines and&#xA;opinions count? Philosophy and Yoga and penance — the worship-room —&#xA;your sunned rice or vegetable offerings — all these constitute the&#xA;religion of one man or one country; doing good to others is the one&#xA;great, universal religion. Men and women, young and old, down to the&#xA;Pariah, nay, the very animal — all can grasp this religion. Can a merely&#xA;negative religion be of any avail? The stone is never unchaste, the cow&#xA;never tells a lie, nor do trees commit theft or robbery, but what does&#xA;it matter? Granted that you do not steal, nor tell a lie, nor lead an&#xA;unchaste life, but meditate four hours a day and religiously ring the&#xA;bell for twice as many hours — yet, what matters it after all? That&#xA;work, little as it is, that you have done, has brought Berhampore to&#xA;your feet for ever — now people will do whatever you wish them to. Now&#xA;you will no longer have to argue to the people that &amp;ldquo;Ramakrishna &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;God.&amp;rdquo; Without it what will mere lectures do? — Do fine words butter any&#xA;parsnips? If you could do like that in ten districts, all the ten would&#xA;become yours to have and hold. Therefore, like the intelligent boy that&#xA;you are, lay your greatest stress, for the present, on that work&#xA;department, and try heart and soul to augment the utility of that alone.&#xA;Organise a number of boys to go from door to door, let them fetch, in&#xA;the manner of the Alakhiā Sādhus, whatever they can get — money, or worn&#xA;out clothes, or rice and eatables, or anything. Then distribute them.&#xA;That is work, work indeed. After that people will have faith, and will&#xA;then do what they are told.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Your&#xA;wishes about the orphanage are very good and Shri Maharaj (Shri&#xA;Ramakrishna.) will not fail to fulfil them at an early date. Try your&#xA;best to found a permanent centre. &amp;hellip; Never worry about money. Tomorrow&#xA;I shall leave Almora for the plains; and wherever there will be made&#xA;some stir, I shall open a subscription list for famine — set your mind&#xA;easy on that score. When in every district there will be a Math on the&#xA;model of our Math in Calcutta, then will my heart&amp;rsquo;s desire be fulfilled.&#xA;Let not the work of preaching, too, be at a standstill, and greater even&#xA;than preaching, is the work of imparting education. By means of lectures&#xA;and the like, the village people must be taught religion, history, and&#xA;such other subjects — specially history. To help our educational work&#xA;there is a Society in England, which, as I find from reports, is doing&#xA;excellent work. In time we shall get help of this kind from everywhere,&#xA;don&amp;rsquo;t be frightened. They only do work who think that help &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; come,&#xA;directly they are on the field of work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Magistrate. Besides, you will write a big letter to the &lt;em&gt;Indian&#xA;Mirror&lt;/em&gt;, describing in detail his method of work (having got the same&#xA;revised by Dr. Shashi), and send a copy of it to the gentleman named&#xA;above. Our fools only search for people&amp;rsquo;s shortcomings. Let them see&#xA;some virtues too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

BULL,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;. . . My health is indifferent, and although I have some rest, I do not&#xA;think I shall be able to regain my usual vigour till winter next. I had&#xA;a letter from Joe saying that you are both coming to India. I, of&#xA;course, will be very glad to see you in India, only you ought to know&#xA;from the first that India is the dirtiest and unhealthiest hole in the&#xA;world, with scarcely any European comforts except in the big capitals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I was suffering very much from illness and it was impossible&#xA;for me to go then. Now thanks to my travels in the Himalayas, I have&#xA;greatly regained my health. I shall soon resume work. In two weeks I am&#xA;going to the Punjab, and just after delivering a lecture or two at&#xA;Lahore and Amritsar, I shall start via Karachi for Gujarat, Cutch, etc.&#xA;I shall surely see you at Karachi.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

If you&#xA;can make an unpopular man popular, then I call you a clever fellow.&#xA;There is no prospect of work there in the future; it would have been&#xA;better had you gone rather to Dacca, or some other place. However, it is&#xA;a good thing that the work will close in November. If you get very badly&#xA;off in health, you should better come away. There is much field for work&#xA;in the Central Provinces; and even without famine, there is no lack of&#xA;poverty-stricken people in our country. Wherever it is, if you can&#xA;choose a site with an eye to prospect, you are sure to turn out good&#xA;work. However, be not sorry. What one does has no destruction — no,&#xA;never. Who knows, at that very place the future may reap golden results.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

You need not make a big plan for&#xA;the present, but do only what is possible under existing circumstances.&#xA;Gradually the way will open to you. We must certainly have the&#xA;orphanage, no hesitating in that. We must not leave the girls in the&#xA;lurch either. But then we must have a lady superintendent for an&#xA;orphanage of girls. I believe Mother will be a very good hand for that.&#xA;Or engage for this task some aged widow of the village who has no issue.&#xA;And there must be separate places for the boys and girls. Captain Sevier&#xA;is ready to send you money to help in this. Nedou&amp;rsquo;s Hotel, Lahore — that&#xA;is his address. If you write to him, write the words, &amp;ldquo;To wait arrival&amp;rdquo;,&#xA;on the letter. I am soon going to Rawalpindi, tomorrow or the day after;&#xA;then I visit Lahore and other places via Jammu, and return to Rajputana&#xA;via Karachi etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This Address is to be sent to the Raja of Khetri. Have it&#xA;printed in gilt etc. The Raja is expected at Bombay about the 21st or&#xA;22nd of October. None of us is staying at Bombay at present — if there&#xA;be any, send him a copy so that he may present the same to the Raja even&#xA;on Board the ship, or somewhere in the city of Bombay. Send the superior&#xA;copy to Khetri. Have this passed in a meeting and if any change is&#xA;needed, no harm. Then sign it, all of you, only leaving a blank for my&#xA;name, and I shall sign it on going to Khetri. Let no pains be spared in&#xA;this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

First,&#xA;because Captain and Mrs. Sevier, who have come from England and are&#xA;travelling with me for the last nine months nearly, are very anxious to&#xA;buy some land at Dehra Dun and start an orphanage there. It is their&#xA;special request that I should go and open the work. This makes it&#xA;unavoidable to go to Dehra Dun.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have duly received your letter and that of dear Haripada. Of course&#xA;you have ample reason to feel sorry for, but you see, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help&#xA;it. And what took me here also became a fiasco; neither could I go to&#xA;Sindh. It is the Lord&amp;rsquo;s will. Now, I have an idea of proceeding to&#xA;Calcutta through Rajputana, Kathiawar, and Sindh. But some difficulty&#xA;may crop up on the way. If all goes well, I am certainly coming to&#xA;Sindh. You must have undergone a lot of difficulty in coming to&#xA;Hyderabad by arranging for leave etc. Any least trouble undergone, is&#xA;bound to produce its excellent results. Friday next I shall leave this&#xA;place, and have a mind to go via Saharanpur to Rajputana direct. I am&#xA;doing well now, and trust you too are in health and peace of mind. . . .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I believe it&#xA;is the religion of the future enlightened humanity. The Hindus may get&#xA;the credit of arriving at it earlier than other races, they being an&#xA;older race than either the Hebrew or the Arab; yet practical Advaitism,&#xA;which looks upon and behaves to all mankind as one&amp;rsquo;s own soul, was never&#xA;developed among the Hindus universally.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I cannot gather strength&#xA;enough to accompany you. The cold in the lungs continues, and that is&#xA;just what makes me unfit for travel. On the whole I hope to improve&#xA;here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I find my cousin has been all these years cultivating her mind with a&#xA;will, and she knows all that the Bengali literature can give her, and&#xA;that is a good deal, especially of metaphysics. She has already learnt&#xA;to sign her name in English and the Roman alphabet. It is now real brain&#xA;work to teach her, and therefore I have desisted. I am trying simply to&#xA;idle away my time and force myself to take rest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Noble or Sister Nivedita)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;. . . It seems there is a gloom over your mind. Never mind, nothing is&#xA;to last for ever. Anyhow life is not eternal. I am so, so thankful for&#xA;it. Suffering is the lot of the world&amp;rsquo;s best and bravest — yet, for&#xA;aeons yet — till things are righted; if possible, here — at least it is&#xA;a discipline which breaks the dream. In my sane moments I rejoice for my&#xA;sufferings. Some one must suffer here; — I am glad it is I, amongst&#xA;others of nature&amp;rsquo;s sacrifices.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

BULL,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You are perfectly right; I am brutal, very indeed. But about the&#xA;tenderness etc., that is my fault. I wish I had less, much less of that&#xA;— that is my weakness — and alas! all my sufferings have come from that.&#xA;Well, the municipality is trying to tax us out — good; that is my fault&#xA;as I did not make the Math public property by a deed of trust. I am very&#xA;sorry I use harsh language to my boys, but they also know I love them&#xA;more than anybody else on earth. I may have had Divine help — true; but&#xA;oh, the pound of blood every bit of Divine help has been to me!! I would&#xA;be gladder and a better man without that. The present looks very gloomy&#xA;indeed; but I am a fighter and must die fighting, not give way — that is&#xA;why I get crazy at the boys. I don&amp;rsquo;t ask them to fight, but not to&#xA;hinder my fight.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There was, never anything serious&#xA;with my organs — it was nerves and dyspepsia.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now I walk miles every day, at any time — before or after meals. I am&#xA;perfectly well — and am going to remain so, I am sure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But&#xA;Mother does good to others through me, at least some to my native land,&#xA;and it is easier to be reconciled to one&amp;rsquo;s fate as a sacrifice. We are&#xA;all sacrifices — each in his own way. The great work is going on — no&#xA;one can see its meaning except that it is a great sacrifice. Those that&#xA;are willing escape a lot of pain. Those who resist are broken into&#xA;submission and suffer more. I am now determined to be a willing one.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I see Joe has missed you at&#xA;Chicago — although I have not heard anything from them yet from New&#xA;York.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There was a bundle of English newspapers from England with a line on the&#xA;envelope expressing good wishes for me and signed, F.H.M. Nothing&#xA;important was in those, however. I would have written a letter to Miss&#xA;Müller, but I do not know the address; then I was afraid to frighten&#xA;her.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CALIFORNIA,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;21st February, 1900&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;MY DEAR AKHANDANANDA,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am very glad to receive your letter and go through the details of&#xA;news. Learning and wisdom are superfluities, the surface glitter merely,&#xA;but it is the heart that is the seat of all power. It is not in the&#xA;brain but in the heart that the Atman, possessed of knowledge, power,&#xA;and activity, has Its seat. &amp;ldquo;शतं चैका च हृदयस्य नाड्यः — The nerves of&#xA;the heart are a hundred and one&amp;rdquo; etc. The chief nerve-centre near the&#xA;heart, called the sympathetic ganglia, is where the Atman has Its&#xA;citadel. The more heart you will be able to manifest, the greater will&#xA;be the victory you achieve. It is only a few that understand the&#xA;language of the brain, but everyone from the Creator down to a clump of&#xA;grass, understands the language that comes from the heart. But then, in&#xA;our country, it is a case of rousing men that are, as it were, dead. It&#xA;will take time, but if you have infinite patience and perseverance,&#xA;success is bound to come. No mistake in that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I want to be quiet and rest. I know the time and&#xA;the place; but the fate or Karma, I think, drives me on — work, work. We&#xA;are like cattle driven to the slaughter-house — hastily nibbling a bite&#xA;of grass on the roadside as they are driven along under the whip. And&#xA;all this is our work, our fear — fear, the beginning of misery, of&#xA;disease, etc. By being nervous and fearful we injure others, by being so&#xA;fearful to hurt we hurt more. By trying so much to avoid evil we fall&#xA;into its jaws.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;clx&#34;&gt;CLX&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;2nd July, 1900&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DEAR NIVEDITA,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;. . . Mother knows, as I always say. Pray to Mother. It is hard work to&#xA;be a leader — one must crush all one&amp;rsquo;s own self under the feet of the&#xA;community. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yours etc.,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;VIVEKANANDA.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Many thanks for the kind expressions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I gave a chance to Mrs. Bull to draw her money out of the Math; and as&#xA;she did not say anything about it, and the trust deeds were waiting here&#xA;to be executed, I got them executed duly at the British Consulate; and&#xA;they are on their way to India now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Grind,&#xA;grind! Something will come — some way will be opened. If it does not, as&#xA;it probably never will — then, then — what then? All our efforts are&#xA;only to stave off, for a season, the great climax — death! Oh, what&#xA;would the world do without you, Death! Thou great healer!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We had a congress of cranks here in this house.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The representatives came from various countries, from India in the&#xA;south, to Scotland in the north, with England and America buttressing&#xA;the sides.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We were having great difficulty in electing the president, for though&#xA;Dr. James (Professor William James) was there, he was more mindful of&#xA;the blisters raised on him by Mrs. Melton (probably a magnetic healer)&#xA;than solution of world problems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But if it be&#xA;too late to find my way out here, you will have to find me a place to&#xA;sleep in the house.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yours with love and blessings,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;VIVEKANANDA.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Alas! my hurrying was of no use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Poor Captain Sevier passed away, a few days ago — thus two great&#xA;Englishmen gave up their lives for us — us the Hindus. Thus is martyrdom&#xA;if anything is. Mrs. Sevier I have written to just now, to know her&#xA;decision.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am well, things are well here — every way. Excuse this haste. I will&#xA;write longer ere long.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Are you not&#xA;surprised? Verily I am a bird of passage. Gay and busy Paris, grim old&#xA;Constantinople, sparkling little Athens, and pyramidal Cairo are left&#xA;behind, and here I am writing in my room on the Ganga, in the Math. It&#xA;is so quiet and still! The broad river is dancing in the bright&#xA;sunshine, only now and then an occasional cargo boat breaking the&#xA;silence with the splashing of the oars. It is the cold season here, but&#xA;the middle of the day is warm and bright every day. But it is the winter&#xA;of Southern California. Everything is green and gold, and the grass is&#xA;like velvet; yet the air is cold and crisp and delightful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

What&#xA;the learned friend of Alberta says about Russia is about the same I&#xA;think myself. Only there is one difficulty of thought: Is it possible&#xA;for the Hindu race to be Russianised?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dear Mr. Sevier passed away before I could arrive. He was cremated on&#xA;the banks of the river that flows by his Ashrama, &lt;em&gt;à la&lt;/em&gt; Hindu, covered&#xA;with garlands, the Brahmins carrying the body and boys chanting the&#xA;Vedas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;clxviii&#34;&gt;CLXVIII&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;THE MATH, BELUR,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;7th Sept., 1901.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DEAR NIVEDITA,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We all work by bits, that is to say, in this cause. I try to keep down&#xA;the spring, but something or other happens, and the spring goes whirr,&#xA;and there you are — thinking, remembering, scribbling, scrawling, and&#xA;all that!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, about the rains — they have come down now in right earnest, and it&#xA;is a deluge, pouring, pouring, pouring night and day. The river is&#xA;rising, flooding the banks; the ponds and tanks have overflowed. I have&#xA;just now returned from lending a hand in cutting a deep drain to take&#xA;off the water from the Math grounds. The rain-water stands at places&#xA;some feet high. My huge stork is full of glee, and so are the ducks and&#xA;geese. My tame antelope fled from the Math and gave us some days of&#xA;anxiety in finding him out. One of my ducks unfortunately died&#xA;yesterday. She had been gasping for breath more than a week. One of my&#xA;waggish old monks says, &amp;ldquo;Sir, it is no use living in this Kali-Yuga when&#xA;ducks catch cold from damp and rain, and frogs sneeze!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
