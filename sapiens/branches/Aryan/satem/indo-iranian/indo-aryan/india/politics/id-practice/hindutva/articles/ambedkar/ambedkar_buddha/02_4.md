> § 1. Suddhodana and the Last Look
>
>  1. After the conversion of Sariputta and Moggallana, the Lord
> stayed in Rajagraha for two months.  
>  2. Having heard that the Lord was residing at Rajagraha,
> Suddhodana, his father, sent word to him saying, "I wish to see my son
> before I die. Others have had the benefit of his doctrine, but not his
> father nor his relatives."  
>  3. The man with whom the message was sent was Kaludayin, the son
> of one of the courtiers of Suddhodana.  
>  4. And the messenger, on arrival, said, "O world-honoured
> Tathagata, your father looks for your coming, as the lily longs for
> the rising of the sun."  
>  5. The Blessed One consented to the request of his father and set
> out on the journey to his father's house, accompanied by a large
> number of his disciples.  
>  6. The Lord journeyed by slow stages. But Kaludayin went ahead of
> him to inform Suddodhana that the Blessed One was coming and was on
> his way.  
>  7. Soon the tidings spread in the Sakya country. "Prince
> Siddharth, who wandered forth from home into homelessness to obtain
> enlightenment, having attained his purpose, is coming home to
> Kapilavatsu." This was on the lips of every one.  
>  8. Suddhodana and Mahaprajapati went out with their relatives and
> ministers to meet their son. When they saw their son from afar, they
> were struck with his beauty and dignity and his lustre and they
> rejoiced in their heart, but they could find no words to utter.  
>  9. This indeed was their so ; these were the features of
> Siddharth! How near was the great Samana to their heart, and yet what
> a distance lay between them! That noble muni was no longer Siddharth
> their son; he was now the Buddha, the Blessed One, the Holy One, Lord
> of Truth and Teacher of Mankind!  
>  10. Suddhodana, considering the religious dignity of their son,
> descended from the chariot; and having saluted him first, said, "It is
> now seven years since we saw you. How we have longed for this
> moment."  
>  11. Then the Buddha took a seat opposite his father, and the king
> eagerly gazed at his son. He longed to call him by his name but he
> dared not. "Siddharth," he exclaimed silently in his heart,
> "Siddharth, come back to your old father and be his son again." But
> seeing the determination of his son, he suppressed his sentiments.
> Desolation overcame him and Mahaprajapati.  
>  12. Thus the father sat face to face with his son, rejoicing in
> his sadness and sad in his rejoicing. Well may he be proud of his son,
> but his pride broke down at the idea that his great son would never be
> his heir.  
>  13. "I would offer thee my kingdom," said the king, but if I did,
> thou would\[st\] account it but as ashes."  
>  14. And the Lord said, "I know that the king's heart is full of
> love, and that for his son's sake he feels deep grief. But let the
> ties of love that bind you to the son whom you lost, embrace with
> equal kindness all your fellow-beings, and you will receive in his
> place a greater one than your son Siddharth; you will receive one who
> is the teacher of truth, the preacher of righteousness; and the
> bringer of peace and of Nirvana will enter into your heart."  
>  15. Suddhodana trembled with joy when he heard the melodious words
> of his son, the Buddha, and clasping his hands, exclaimed with tears
> in his eyes, "Wonderful is the change! The overwhelming sorrow has
> passed away. At first my sorrowing heart was heavy, but now I reap the
> fruit of your great renunciation. It was right that moved by your
> mighty sympathy, you should reject the pleasures of power and achieve
> your noble purpose in religious devotion. Having found the path, you
> can now preach your Dhamma to all that yearn for deliverance."  
>  16. Suddhodana returned to his house, while the Buddha remained in
> the grove with his companions.  
>  17. The next morning the Blessed Lord took his bowl and set out to
> beg for his food in Kapilavatsu.  
>  18. And the news spread, "Siddharth is going from house to house
> to receive alms, in the city where he used to ride in a chariot
> attended by his retinue. His robe is like a red cloud, and he holds in
> his hand an earthen bowl."  
>  19. On hearing the strange rumour, Suddhodana went forth in great
> hase and exclaimed, "Why do you disgrace me thus? Do you not know that
> I can easily supply you and your Bhikkus with food?"  
>  20. And the Lord replied, "It is the custom of my Order."  
>  21. "But how can this be? You are not one of them that ever begged
> for food."  
>  22. "Yes, father," rejoined the Lord, "You and your race may claim
> descent from kings; my descent is from the Buddhas of old. They begged
> their food, and always lived on alms."  
>  23. Suddhodana made no reply, and the Blessed One continued, "It
> is customary, when one has found a hidden treasure, for him to make an
> offering of the most precious jewel to his father. Suffer me,
> therefore, to offer you this treasure of mine which is the Dhamma."  
>  24. And the Blessed Lord told his father, "If you free yourself
> from dreams, if you open your mind to truth, if you be energetic, if
> you practise righteousness, you will find eternal bliss."  
>  25. Suddhodana heard the words in silence and replied, "My son!
> What thou say\[e\]st will I endeavour to fulfil."
>
>   
> § 2. Meeting Yeshodhara and Rahula
>
>  1. Then Suddhodana conducted the Blessed Lord into his hous,e and
> all the members of the family greeted him with great reverence.  
>  2. But Yeshodhara, the mother of Rahula, did not make her
> appearance. Suddhodana sent for Yeshodhara. but she replied, "Surely,
> if I am deserving of any regard, Siddhartha will come and see me."  
>  3. The Blessed One, having greeted all his relatives and friends,
> asked, "Where is Yeshodhara?"; and on being informed that she had
> refused to come, he rose straightaway and went to her apartment.  
>  4. "I am free," the Blessed One said to his disciples Sariputta
> and Moggallana, whom he had bidden to accompany him into Yeshodhara's
> chamber; "but Yeshodhara, however, is not as yet free. Not having seen
> me for a long time, she is exceedingly sorrowful. Unless her grief be
> allowed to run its course, her heart will cleave \[=split open\].
> Should she touch the Tathagata, the Holy One, you must not prevent
> her."  
>  5. Yeshodhara sat in her room in deep reflection. When the Blessed
> One entered, she was, from the abundance of her affection, like an
> overflowing vessel, unable to contain herself.  
>  6. Forgetting that the man whom she loved was Buddha, the Lord of
> the World, the Preacher of Truth, she held him by his feet and wept
> bitterly.  
>  7. Remembering, however, that Suddhodana was present, she felt
> ashamed and rose up, sitting \[=seating\] herself reverently at a
> little distance.  
>  8. Suddhodana apologized for Yeshodhara, saying, "This arises from
> her deep affection, and is more than a temporary emotion. During the
> seven years that \[=since\] she has lost her husband, when she heard
> that Siddharth had shaved his head, she did likewise; when she heard
> that he had left off the use of perfumes and ornaments, she also
> refused their use. Like her husband, she has eaten at appointed times
> from an earthen bowl only.  
>  9. "If this is more than a temporary emotion, it is not for want
> of courage."  
>  10. And the Blessed One spoke to Yeshodhara, telling of her great
> merits and the great courage she showed when he took Parivraja. Her
> purity, her gentleness, her devotion had been invaluable to him as a
> Bodhisattva when he aspired to the highest aim of mankind, to attain
> enlightenment. This, then, was her karma, and it was the result of
> great merits.  
>  11. Her grief had been unspeakable, and the glory that surrounded
> her spiritual inheritance increased by \[=through\] her noble attitude
> during her life, and had made her a unique person.  
>  12. Then Yeshodhara dressed Rahula, now seven years old, in all
> the splendour of a prince, and said to him:  
>  13. "This holy man, whose appearance is so glorious that he looks
> like the Great Brahma, is your father. He possesses great mines of
> wealth which I have not yet seen. Go to him and entreat him to put you
> in the possession thereof, for the son ought to inherit the property
> of the father."  
>  14. Rahula replied, "Who is my father? I know of no father but
> Suddhodana."  
>  15. Yeshodhara took the boy in her arms and from the window she
> pointed out to the Lord, who happened to be near, partaking of food
> among the Bhikkus, informing him that he was his father and not
> Suddhodana.  
>  16. Rahula then went to him; and looking up in his face, said
> without fear and with much affection:  
>  17. "Aren't thou my father?" And standing near by him, he added,
> "O Samana, even your shadow is full of bliss!" The Blessed One
> remained silent.  
>  18. When the Tathagata had finished his repast, he gave blessings
> and went away from the palace, but Rahula followed and asked him for
> his inheritance.  
>  19. No one prevented the boy, nor did the Blessed One himself.  
>  20. Then the Blessed One turned to Sariputta, saying, "My son asks
> for his inheritance. I cannot give him perishable treasures that will
> bring cares and sorrows, but I can give him the inheritance of a holy
> life, which is a treasure that will not perish."  
>  21. Addressing Rahula with earnestness, the Blessed One said,
> "Gold and silver and jewels have I none. But if you are willing to
> receive spiritual treasures, and are strong to carry them and to keep
> them, I have plenty. My spiritual treasure is the path of
> righteousness. Do you desire to be admitted to the brotherhood of
> those who devote their life to the culture of the mind seeking for the
> highest bliss attainable?"  
>  22. And Rahula replied with firmness, "I do.'"  
>  23. When Suddhodana heard that Rahula had joined the brotherhood
> of the Bhikkus he was greatly grieved.
>
>   
> § 3. Reception by the Sakyas
>
>  1. On his return to the country of the Sakyas, the Lord found his
> countrymen divided into two camps: one in favour, and the other
> against him.  
>  2. This recalled to his mind the old clash of opinion that took
> place in the Sakya Sangh when the issue of war between the Sakyas and
> Koliyas was fought, and in which he had played so prominent a part.  
>  3. Those against him refused even now to do obeisance to him and
> to recognise his greatness. Those for him had already decided to
> dedicate a son per household to form a retinue for him. These now
> decided to enter the Order, and set out with the Lord on his return to
> Rajagraha.  
>  4. Among the families which had decided to dedicate a son, there
> was the family of Amitodana.  
>  5. Amitodana had two sons. One was Anuruddha, who had been very
> delicately nurtured, and the other Mahanama.  
>  6. And Mahanama went to Anuruddha, saying, "Either do you renounce
> the world, or I will do so." And Anuruddha replied, "I am delicate. It
> is impossible for me to go forth from the household life into the
> homeless state. You do so."  
>  7. "But come now, dear Anuruddha, I will tell you what is incident
> to the household life. First, you have to get your fields ploughed.
> When that is done, you have to get them sown. When that is done, you
> have to get the water led down over them. When that is done, you have
> to get the water led off again. When that is done, you have to get the
> seeds pulled up. When that is done, you have to get the crop reaped.
> When that is done, you have to get the crop carried away. When that is
> done, you have to get it arranged into bundles. When that is done, you
> have to get it trodden out. When that is done, you have to get the
> straw picked out. When that is done you have to get the chaff removed.
> When that is done, you have to get it winnowed. When that is done, you
> have to get the harvest garnered. When that is done, you have to do
> just the same next year, and the same all over again the year after
> that.  
>  8. "The work is never over; one sees not the end of one's labour.
> O\[h\] when shall our work be over? When shall we see the end of our
> labours? When shall we, still possessing and retaining the pleasures
> of our five senses, yet dwell at rest? Yes, the work, dear Anuruddha,
> is never over; no end appears to our labours."  
>  9. "Then do you take thought for the household duties. I will go
> forth from the household life into the houseless state," said
> Anuruddha.  
>  10. And Anuruddha, the Sakyan, went to his mother, and said to
> her. "I want, mother, to go forth from the household life into the
> houseless state. Grant me thy permission to do so."  
>  11. And when he had thus spoken, his mother replied to Anuruddha,
> the Sakyan, saying, "You two, dear Anuruddha, are my two sons, near
> and dear to me, in whom I find no evil. Through death I shall some
> day, against my will, be separated from you, but how can I be willing,
> whilst you are still alive, that you should go forth from the
> household life into the houseless state?"  
>  12. And a second timeAnuruddha made the same request, and received
> the same reply. And a third time Anuruddha made the same request to
> his mother.  
>  13. Now at that time Bhaddiya, the Sakyan Raja, held rule over the
> Sakyans; and he was a friend of Anuruddha. And the mother of
> Anuruddha, thinking that that being so, the raja would not be able to
> renounce the world, said to her son, "Dear Anuruddha, if Bhaddiya the
> Sakyan raja will renounce the world, you also may go forth with
> him."  
>  14. Then Anuruddha went to Bhaddiya and said to him, "My
> renunciation of the world, dear friend, is being obstructed by you."  
>  15. "Then let that obstruction, dear friend, be removed. I am with
> you. Renounce the world according to your wish."  
>  16. "Come, dear friend, let us both renounce the world
> together!"  
>  17. "I am not capable, dear friend, of giving up the household
> life. Whatsoever else you can ask of me, that will I do. Do you go
> forth alone," said Bhaddiya.  
>  18. "Mother, dear friend, has told me that if you do so, I may.
> And you have even now declared, 'If your renunciation be obstructed by
> me, then let that obstruction be removed. Even with you will I
> renounce the world according to your wish.' Come then, dear friend,
> let us both renounce the world."  
>  19. And Bhaddiya, the Sakyan raja, said to Anuruddha, "Wait, my
> friend, for seven years. At the end of seven years we will renounce
> the world together."  
>  20. "Seven years are too long, dear friend. I am not able to wait
> for seven years."  
>  21. Bhaddiya reduced the offer to six years and so on down to one
> year, to seven months and so on down to one month, and a fortnight. To
> each offer Anuruddha replied, "Too long a time to wait."  
>  22. Then the raja says \[=said\], " Wait, my friend, for seven
> days, whilst I hand over the kingdom to my sons and my brothers."  
>  23. "Seven days is not too long. I will wait thus far," was the
> reply.  
>  24. So Bhaddiya the Sakyan raja, and Anuruddha, and Ananda, and
> Bhagu, and Kimbila, and Devadatta--just as they had so often
> previously gone out to the pleasure-ground with fourfold array--even
> so did they now go out with fourfold array, and Upali, the barber,
> went with them, making seven in all.  
>  25. And when they had gone some distance they sent their retinue
> back and crossed over into the neighbouring district, and took off
> their fine things and wrapped them in their robes, and made a bundle
> of them, and said to Upali the barber, "Do you now, good Upali, turn
> back to Kapilavatsu. These things will be sufficient for you to live
> upon. We will go and join the Blessed One." And so they went ahead.  
>  26. They went on, and Upali parted company for the purpose of
> going back home.
>
>   
> § 4. Last attempt to make Him a Householder
>
>  1. Suddhodana wept bitterly at the thought of his son going away,
> never to be seen again.  
>  2. Then Suddhodana spoke to his counsellor and his family priest,
> and asked them if they could go and persuade his son to stay back and
> join the family.  
>  3. The family priest ,accompanied by the counsellor, in obedience
> to the wishes of the king, went and overtook him on the way.  
>  4. They paid him honour as was fitting, and having obtained his
> permission, sat down near him.  
>  5. The family priest addressed the Lord as he sat at the foot of
> the tree.  
>  6. "O prince, consider for a moment the feelings of the king, with
> his eyes raining tears, with the arrow of thy separation plunged into
> his heart. He has asked you to come back home. It is then only that he
> can die peacefully.  
>  7. "I know that thy resolve is fixed upon religion, and I am
> convinced that this purpose of thine is unchanging; but I am consumed
> with a flame of anguish like fire at thy going into this homeless
> state.  
>  8. "Come, thou who love duty,--abandon this purpose for the sake
> of duty.  
>  9. "Enjoy for a while the sovereignty of the earth, --thou shall
> go to the orest at the time provided by the sastras,--do not show
> disregard for thy unhappy kindred. Compassion for all creatures is the
> true religion.  
>  10. "Religion is not wrought out only in the forests. The
> salvation of ascetics can be accomplished even in a city; thought and
> effort are the true means, the forest and the badge are only a
> coward's signs.  
>  11. "The king of the Sakyas is drowned in a deep sea of sorrow,
> full of waves of trouble, springing from thee; do thou therefore
> deliver him who is helpless and protectorless like an ox drowning in
> the sea.  
>  12. "Consider also the queen, who brought thee up, who has not yet
> gone to the region inhabited by Agastya--wilt thou not take some heed
> of her, who ceaselessly grieves like a cow that has lost her calf?  
>  13. "Surely thou wilt succour thy wife by the sight of thee, who
> now mourns as a widow yet with her lord still alive,--like a swan
> separated from her mate, or a female elephant deserted in the forest
> by her companion."  
>  14. The Lord, having heard the words of the family priest,
> reflected for a moment, knowing all the virtues of the virtuous, and
> then thus uttered his gentle reply.
>
>   
> § 5. The Buddha's Answer
>
>  1. "I well know the paternal tenderness of the king, especially
> that which he has displayed towards me; yet knowing this as I do,
> still alarmed at the ill and sorrow which pervades the world, I am
> inevitably forced to leave my kindred.  
>  2. "Who would not wish to see his dear kindred, if but this
> separation from beloved ones did not exist? But since even after it
> has been once, separation will still come again, it is for this that I
> abandon my father, however loving.  
>  3. "I do not however approve that thou should think \[of\] the
> king's grief as caused by me, when in the midst of his dream-like
> unions, he is afflicted by thoughts of separations in the future.  
>  4. "Thus let thy thoughts settle into certainty; having seen the
> multiform in ts various developments; neither a son nor kindred is the
> cause of sorrow,--this sorrow is caused only by ignorance.  
>  5. "Since parting is inevitably fixed in the course of time for
> all beings, just as for travellers who have joined company on a
> road,--what wise man would cherish sorrow when he loses his kindred,
> even though he loves them?  
>  6. "Leaving his kindred in another world, he departs hither, and
> having stolen away from them here, he goes forth once more; having
> gone thither, he goes elsewhere also,--such is the lot of
> mankind,--what consideration can the liberated have for them  
>  7. "Since from the moment of leaving the womb death is a
> characteristic adjunct, why, in thy affection for thy son, has thou
> called my departure to the forest ill-timed?  
>  8. "There may be an 'ill time' in one's attaining a worldly
> object,--time indeed is described as inseparably connected with all
> things; time drags the world into all its various times; but all time
> suits a bliss which is really worthy of praise.  
>  9. "That the king should wish to surrender to me his
> kingdom,--this is a noble thought, well worthy of a father; but it
> would be as improper for me to accept it, as for a sick man through
> greed to accept unwholesome food.  
>  10. "How can it be right for the wise to enter royalty, the home
> of illusion, where are found anxiety, passion, and weariness; and the
> violation of all right through another's service?  
>  11. "The golden palace seems to me to be on fire; the daintiest
> viands seem mixed with poison; infested with crocodiles is the
> tranquil lotus-bed."
>
>   
> §6. The Minister's Reply
>
>  1. Having heard the Buddha's discourse, well suitable to his
> virtues and knowledge, freed from all desires, full of sound reasons,
> and weighty,--the counsellor thus made answer:  
>  2. "This resolve of thine is an excellent counsel, not unfit in
> itself but only unfit at the present time; it could not be thy duty,
> loving duty as thou do\[st\], to leave thy father in his old age to
> sorrow  
>  3. "Surely thy mind is not very penetrating, or it is ill-skilled
> in examining duty, wealth, and pleasure,--when for the sake of an
> unseen result thou departest, disregarding a visible end.  
>  4. "Again, some say that there is another birth,--others with
> confident assertion say that there is not; since, then, the matter is
> all in doubt, it is right to enjoy the good fortune which comes into
> thy hand.  
>  5. "If there is any activity hereafter, we will enjoy ourselves in
> it as \[it\] may offer; or if there is no activity beyond this life,
> then there is an assured liberation to all the world without any
> effort.  
>  6. "Some say there is a future life, but they do not allow the
> possibility of liberation; as fire is hot by nature, and water liquid,
> so they hold that there is a special nature in our power of action.  
>  7. "Some maintain that all things arise from inherent
> properties,--both good and evil, and existence and non-existence; and
> since all this world thus arises spontaneously, therefore also all
> effort of ours is vain.  
>  8. "Since the action of the senses is fixed, and so too the
> agreeableness or the disagreeableness of outward objects,--then for
> that which is united to old age and pains, what effort can avail to
> alter it? Does it not all arise spontaneously?  
>  9. "The fire becomes quenched by water, and fire causes water to
> evaporate; and different elements, united in a body, producing unity,
> bear up the world.  
>  10. "That the nature of the embryo in the womb is produced as
> composed of hands, feet, belly, back, and head, and that it is also
> united with the soul,--the wise declare that all this comes of itself
> spontaneously.  
>  11. "Who causes the sharpness of the thorn? Or the various natures
> of beasts and birds? All this has arisen spontaneously; \[when\] there
> is no acting from desire, how then can there be such a thing as
> will?  
>  12. "Others say that creation comes from Isvara,--what need then
> is there of the effort of the conscious soul? That which is the cause
> of the action of the world, is also determined as the cause of its
> ceasing to act.  
>  13. "Some say that the coming into being and the destruction of
> being are alike caused by the soul, but they say that coming into
> being arises without effort, while the attainment of liberation is by
> effort.  
>  14. "A man discharges his debt to his ancestors by begetting
> offspring, to the saints by sacred lore, to the gods by sacrifices; he
> is born with these three debts upon him,--whoever has liberation (from
> these), he indeed has liberation.  
>  15. "Thus by this series of rules the wise promise liberation to
> him who uses effort; but however ready for effort with all their
> energy, those who seek liberation will find weariness.  
>  16. "Therefore, gentle youth, if thou has a love for liberation,
> follow rightly the prescribed rule; thus wilt thou thyself attain to
> it, and the king's grief will come to an end.  
>  17. "And as for thy meditations on the evils of life ending in thy
> return from the forest to thy home,--let not the thought of this
> trouble thee, my son,--those in old time\[s\] also have returned from
> the forests to their houses." He mentioned Ambarish Drumakesha, Rama,
> and others.
>
>   
> §7. The Buddha's Determination
>
>  1. Then, having heard the affectionate and loyal words of the
> minister, who was as the eye of the king,--firm in his resolve, the
> king's son made his answer, with nothing omitted or displaced, neither
> tedious nor hasty:  
>  2. "This doubt whether anything exists or not, is not to be solved
> for me by another's words; having determined the truth by asceticism
> or quietism, I will myself grasp whatever is the truth concerning
> it.  
>  3. "It is not for me to accept a theory which depends on the
> unknown and is ll controverted, and which involves a hundred
> prepossessions; what wise man would go by another's belief? Mankind is
> like the blind directed in darkness by the blind.  
>  4. "But even though I cannot discern the truth, yet still, if good
> and evil are doubted, let one's mind be set on the good; even a toil
> in vain is to be chosen by him whose soul is good.  
>  5. "But having seen that this 'sacred tradition' is uncertain,
> know that that only is right which has been uttered by the
> trustworthy; and know that trustworthiness means the absence of
> faults; he who is without faults will not utter an untruth.  
>  6. "And as for what thou said to me in regard to my returning
> home, the examples you give are no authority,--for in determining
> duty, how can thou quote as authorities those who have broken their
> vows?  
>  7. "Even the sun therefore may fall to the earth, even the
> mountain Himavat may lose its firmness; but never could I return to my
> home as a man of the world, with my senses only alert for external
> objects.  
>  8. "I would enter the blazing fire, but not my house with my
> purpose unfulfilled." Rising up in accordance with his resolve. full
> of disinterestedness, he went his way.  
>  9. Then the minister and the Brahmin, both full of tears, having
> heard his firm determination, and having followed him awhile with
