Sir.

I have the honor to transmit my report on the subject of village schools. The returns received from the Talooks composing the prin- cipal division give schools 150, tutors 171, and pupils 2,348; those from the late sub-collectorate south of the Beema give schools 86, and pupils 1,049, and those from the three Talooks of Ranebednoor give schools 34, tutors 34, and scholars 531, making an aggregate of schools 270, tutors 291 and pupils 3,845.
2. Of the schools, 146 are Mahratta, 112 Canarese,-7 both Mahratta and Canarese, and 5 were in Persian and Hindoostanee-of the tutors 138 are Brahmins, 139 Linguaits, 5 Hindoos of different caste and 9 Mussalmans; of the pupils 943 are Brahmins, 2.092 Linguaits, 609 Hindoos of different caste and 118 Mussalmans.
3. With respect to the nature of the instruction...and the at- tainment of the pupils, in the principal division these returns give pupils 1,319 as the number being taught "dowlaecharum," that is, writing in sand on the ground or on boards; reading, writing and simple arithmetic 871; reading the Jayamony Amakosh, Veedoor-neeter, etc., 50; and Persian books such as Kareema, etc., 57.
4. In the sub-collectorate,... little else is taught beyond the ele- ments of reading, writing and arithmetic, and there is but one school in which the Jayamony is being read, and that is in the Hoongoond
   Talook.
