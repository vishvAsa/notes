title: Subversion
---

## Summary

- A strong self determined India is the natural result of Hindutva coming to power. Naturally, several foreign powers do not like this.
- Subversion of hinduism by foreign and domestic forces is considered in the [hinduism subversion page](../../../social-cultivation/subversion/).
- Media connection - see [here](../../../rivals/rags.md).

## Pyschological operations intro

Psy-ops is real, and has been used very effectively in the past. The strength of India's domestic fools are a direct result of old soviet subversion. Russia used it quite effectively in the Ukraine and US elections. US uses (through its [Psy-ops division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_operations_(United_States))) the very same techniques widely (Ukraine, parts of arab world) - and it can be safely deduced to have happened in India as well.

### Basis in native memetic epidemics
Some psy-ops operations have synergy with memetic diseases (feminazis, SJW-s, sickularism) natively afflicting the aggressor's population. It is just that Indian hindu population is especially susceptible to aping the mlecChas (even to the extant of contacting their diseases) compared to - say - the Chinese or Japanese.

- Stage 1 demoralization: 15-20 yrs - Educate a generation of students. Programmed to think and react in a certain way. Unable to assess true information. (Soviets would eventually mostly mark these eventually-bitter idealists for eventual elimination.)
- Stage 2 destabilization: 2-5 yrs. Economy, foreign relations, defence.
