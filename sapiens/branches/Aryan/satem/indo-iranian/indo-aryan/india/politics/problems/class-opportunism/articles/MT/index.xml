      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know what karikaDaipayyan posted 🙂. But here is something that the younger generation often ignores. In the 1980s/90s the jewish agency, Mossad, informed the Indian intelligence that the Indian state faced a grave danger from the nIladrApi&amp;rsquo;s putraka-s. (IIRC in the 1980s-1990 and conveyed to B.Raman or R. Kao. You can find it B.Raman&amp;rsquo;s reminiscence)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now at that point in time the 1st responders of the Mossad in the subcontinent were limited. So it was not a case of the Mossad threatening the Ind int but passing some information either in return for something or because it was of low value to them. So the question becomes whom did they get it from &amp;amp; who were the ones building up the anuyAyin-s of the said entity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
