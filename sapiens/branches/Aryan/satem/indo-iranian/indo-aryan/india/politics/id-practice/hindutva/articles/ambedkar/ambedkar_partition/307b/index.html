CHAPTER VII
HINDU ALTERNATIVE TO PAKISTAN
III
[Mr. Gandhi’s tenacious quest for Hindu-Muslim unity]
Mr. Savarkar is quite unconcerned about the Muslim reaction to his scheme. He formulates his scheme and throws it in the face of the Muslims with the covering letter ’take it or leave it.’ He is not perturbed by the Muslim refusal to join in the struggle for Swaraj. He is quite conscious of the strength of the Hindus and the Hindu Maha Sabha and proposes to carry on the struggle in the confident hope that, alone and unaided, the Hindus will be able to wrest Swaraj from the British. Mr. Savarkar is quite prepared to say to the Musalmans: “If you come, with you, if you don’t, without you; and if you oppose, in spite of you—the Hindus will continue to fight for their national freedom as best as they can.”">

<p>CHAPTER VII</p>
<p>HINDU ALTERNATIVE TO PAKISTAN</p>
<p>III<br>
[Mr. Gandhi&rsquo;s tenacious quest for Hindu-Muslim unity]</p>
<p>Mr. Savarkar is quite unconcerned about the Muslim reaction to his
scheme. He formulates his scheme and throws it in the face of the
Muslims with the covering letter &rsquo;take it or leave it.&rsquo; He is not
perturbed by the Muslim refusal to join in the struggle for Swaraj. He
is quite conscious of the strength of the Hindus and the Hindu Maha
Sabha and proposes to carry on the struggle in the confident hope that,
alone and unaided, the Hindus will be able to wrest Swaraj from the
British. Mr. Savarkar is quite prepared to say to the Musalmans: &ldquo;If you
come, with you, if you don&rsquo;t, without you; and if you oppose, in spite
of you—the Hindus will continue to fight for their national freedom as
best as they can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not so Mr. Gandhi. At the very commencement of his career as a
political leader of India when Mr. Gandhi startled the people of India
by his promise to win Swaraj within six months, Mr. Gandhi said that he
could perform the miracle only if certain conditions were fulfilled. One
of these conditions was the achievement of Hindu-Muslim unity. Mr.
Gandhi is never tired of saying that there is no Swaraj without
Hindu-Muslim unity. Mr. Gandhi did not merely make this slogan the
currency of Indian politics, but he has strenuously worked to bring it
about. Mr. Gandhi, it may be said, began his carrier as a political
leader of India with the manifesto dated 2nd March 1919 declaring his
intention to launch Satyagraha against the Rowlatt Act and asking those
who desired to join him to sign the Satyagraha pledge. That campaign of
Satyagraha was a short-lived campaign and was suspended by Mr. Gandhi on
18th April 1919. As a part of his programme Mr. Gandhi had
fixed**<a href="#n01">/1/</a>** the 6th March 1919 to be observed all over India as
a day of protest against the Rowlatt Act. Mass meetings were to be held
on that day and Mr. Gandhi had prescribed that the masses attending the
meetings should take a vow in the following terms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;With God as witness, we Hindus, and Mahomedans declare that we shall
behave towards one another as children of the same parents, that we
shall have no differences, that the sorrows of each shall be the
sorrows of the other and that each shall help the other in removing
them. We shall respect each other&rsquo;s religion and religious feelings
and shall not stand in the way of our respective religious practices.
We shall always refrain from violence to each other in the name of
religion.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>There was nothing in the campaign of Satyagraha against the Rowlatt
Act which could have led to any clash between the Hindus and Muslims.
Yet Mr. Gandhi asked his followers to take the vow. This shows how
insistent he was from the very beginning upon Hindu-Muslim unity.</p>
<p>The Mahomedans started the Khilafat movement in 1919. The objective
of the movement was two-fold: to preserve the Khilafat and to maintain
the integrity of the Turkish Empire. Both these objectives were
unsupportable. The Khilafat could not be saved simply because the Turks,
in whose interest this agitation was carried on, did not want the
Sultan. They wanted a republic, and it was quite unjustifiable to compel
the Turks to keep Turkey a monarchy when they wanted to convert it into
a republic. It was not open to insist upon the integrity of the Turkish
Empire because it meant the perpetual subjection of the different
nationalities to the Turkish rule and particularly of the Arabs,
especially when it was agreed on all hands that the doctrine of
self-determination should be made the basis of the peace settlement.</p>
<p>The movement was started by the Mahomedans. It was taken up by Mr.
Gandhi with a tenacity and faith which must have surprised many
Mahomedans themselves. There were many people who doubted the ethical
basis of the Khilafat movement and tried to dissuade Mr. Gandhi from
taking any part in a movement the ethical basis of which was so
questionable. But Mr. Gandhi had so completely persuaded himself of the
justice of the Khilafat agitation that he refused to yield to their
advice. Time and again he argued that the cause was just and it was his
duty to join it. The position taken up by him may be summed up in his
own words.<strong><a href="#n02">/2/</a></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;(1) In my opinion, the Turkish claim is not only not immoral and
unjust, but it is highly equitable, only because Turkey wants to
retain what is her own. And the Mahomedan manifesto has definitely
declared that whatever guarantee may be necessary to be taken for the
protection of the non-Muslim and non-Turkish races, should be taken so
as to give the Christians theirs and the Arabs their self-government
under the Turkish suzerainty;</p>
<p>(2) I do not believe the Turk to be weak, incapable or cruel. He is
certainly disorganised and probably without good generalship. The
argument of weakness, incapacity and cruelty one often hears quoted in
connection with those from whom power is sought to be taken away.
About the alleged massacres a proper commission has been asked for,
but never granted. And in any case security can be taken against
oppression;</p>
<p>(3) I have already stated that, if I were not interested in the
Indian Mahomedans, I would not interest myself in the welfare of the
Turks any more than I am in that of the Austrians or the Poles. But I
am bound as an Indian to share the sufferings and trials of
fellow-Indians. If I deem the Mahomedan to be my brother, it is my
duty to help him in his hour of peril to the best of my ability, if
his cause commends itself to me as just;</p>
<p>(4) The fourth refers to the extent Hindus should join hands with
the Mahomedans. It is, therefore, a matter of feeling and opinion. It
is expedient to suffer for my Mahomedan brother to the utmost in a
just cause and I should, therefore, travel with him along the whole
road so long as the means employed by him are as honourable as his
end. I cannot regulate the Mahomedan feeling. I must accept his
statement that the Khilafat is with him a religious question in the
sense that it binds him to reach the goal even at the cost of his own
life.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Gandhi not only agreed with the Muslims in the Khilafat cause
but acted as their guide and their friend. The part played by Mr. Gandhi
in the Khilafat agitation and the connection between the Khilafat
agitation and the Non-co-operation Movement has become obscure by the
reason of the fact that most people believed that it was the Congress
which initiated the Non-co-operation Movement and it was done as a means
for winning Swaraj. That such a view should prevail is quite
understandable, because most people content themselves with noting the
connection between the Non-co-operation Movement and the special session
of the Congress held at Calcutta on 7th and 8th September 1920. But
anyone who cares to go behind September 1920 and examine the situation
as it then stood, will find that this view is not true. The truth is
that the non-co-operation has its origin in the Khilafat agitation and
not in the Congress Movement for Swaraj: that it was started by the
Khilafatists to help Turkey and adopted by the Congress only to help the
Khilafatists: that Swaraj was not its primary object, but its primary
object was Khilafat and that Swaraj was added as a secondary object to
induce the Hindus to join it will be evident from the following facts.</p>
<p>The Khilafat movement may be said to have begun on 27th October 1919
when the day was observed as the Khilafat Day all over India. On 23rd
November 1919 the first Khilafat Conference met at Delhi. It was at this
session that the Muslims considered the feasibility of non-co-operation
as a means of compelling the British Government to redress the Khilafat
wrong. On 10th March 1920 the Khilafat Conference met at Calcutta and
decided upon non-co-operation as the best weapon to further the object
of their agitation.</p>
<p>On 9th June 1920 the Khilafat Conference met at Allahabad and
unanimously reaffirmed their resolve to resort to non-co-operation and
appointed an Executive Committee to enforce and lay down a detailed
programme. On 22nd June 1920 the Muslims sent a message to the Viceroy
stating that they would start non-co-operation if the Turkish grievances
were not redressed before 1st August 1920. On 30th June 1920 the
Khilafat Committee meeting held at Allahabad resolved to start
non-co-operation, after a month&rsquo;s notice to the Viceroy. Notice was
given on 1st July 1920 and non-co-operation commenced on 1st August
1920. This short resume shows that the non-co-operation was started by
the Khilafat Committee and all that the Congress special session at
Calcutta did was to adopt what the Khilafat Conference had already done,
and that too not in the interest of Swaraj but in the interest of
helping the Musalmans in furthering the cause of Khilafat. This is clear
from the perusal of the Congress Resolution**<a href="#n03">/3/</a>** passed at the
special session held at Calcutta.</p>
<p>Although the Non-co-operation Movement was launched by the Khilafat
Committee and merely adopted by the Congress primarily to help the
Khilafat cause, the person who suggested it to the Khilafat Committee
and who identified himself with the Committee and took the
responsibility of giving effect to it and who brought about its adoption
by the Congress was Mr. Gandhi.</p>
<p>At the first Khilafat Conference held at Delhi on 23rd November 1919
Mr. Gandhi was present. Not only was Mr. Gandhi present but also it was
he who advised the Muslims to adopt non-co-operation as a method for
forcing the British to yield to their demands regarding the Khilafat.
The joining of Mr. Gandhi in the Khilafat movement is full of
significance. The Muslims were anxious to secure the support of the
Hindus in the cause of Khilafat. At the Conference held on 23rd November
1919 the Muslims had invited the Hindus. Again on 3rd June 1920 a joint
meeting of the Hindus and the Khilafatist Muslims was held at Allahabad.
This meeting was attended among others by Sapru, Motilal Nehru and Annie
Besant. But the Hindus were hesitant in joining the Muslims. Mr. Gandhi
was the only Hindu who joined the Muslims. Not only did he show courage
to join them, but also he kept step with them, nay, led them. On 9th
June 1920 when the Khilafat Conference met at Allahabad and formed an
Executive Committee to prepare a detailed programme of non-co-operation
and give effect to it, Mr. Gandhi was the only Hindu on that Executive
Committee. On 22nd June 1920 the Muslims sent a message to the Viceroy
that they would start non-co-operation if the Turkish grievances were
not redressed before 1st August 1920. On the same day Mr. Gandhi also
sent a letter to the Viceroy explaining the justice of the Khilafat
cause, the reasons why he has taken up the cause and the necessity of
satisfying the hands [=demands?] of the Khilafatists. For instance the
notice given to the Viceroy on 1st July 1920 that non-co-operation will
be started on 1st August was given by Mr. Gandhi and not by the
Khilafatists. Again when non-co-operation was started by the Khilafatist
on 31st August 1920 Mr. Gandhi was the first to give a concrete shape to
it by returning his medal. After inaugurating the Non-co-operation
Movement as an active member of the Khilafat Committee Mr. Gandhi next
directed his energy to the cause of persuading the Congress to adopt
non-co-operation and strengthen the Khilafat movement. With that object
in view Mr. Gandhi toured the country between 1st August and 1st
September 1920 in the company of the Ali Brothers who were the founders
of the Khilafat movement, impressing upon the people the necessity of
non-co-operation. People could notice the disharmony in the tune of Mr.
Gandhi and the Ali Brothers. As the <strong>Modern Review</strong> pointed out:
&ldquo;Reading between the lines of their speeches, it is not difficult to see
that with one of them the sad plight of the Khilafat in distant Turkey
is the central fact, while with the other attainment of Swaraj here in
India is the object in view.&rdquo; This dichotomy**<a href="#n04">/4/</a>** of interest
did not augur well for the success of the ultimate purpose. Nonetheless
Mr. Gandhi succeeded in carrying the Congress with him in support of the
Khilafat cause.<strong><a href="#n05">/5/</a></strong></p>
<p>For a long time the Hindus had been engaged in wooing the Muslims to
their side. The Congress was very anxious to bridge the gulf between
itself and the Muslim League. The ways and means adopted in 1916 for
bringing about this consummation and which resulted in the Lucknow Pact
signed between the Congress and the Muslim League have been graphically
told by Swami Shradhanand in his impressions of the Congress Session
held in that year at Lucknow. Says the Swami:<strong><a href="#n06">/6/</a></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;On sitting on the dias (Lucknow Congress platform) the first thing
that I noticed was that the number of Moslem delegates was
proportionately fourfold of what it was at Lahore in 1893. The
majority of Moslem delegates had donned gold, silver and silk
embroidered chogas (flowing robes) over their ordinary coarse suits of
wearing apparel. It was rumoured that these &lsquo;chogas&rsquo; had been put by
Hindu moneyed men for Congress Tamasha. Of some 433 Moslem delegates
only some 30 had come from outside, the rest belonging to Lucknow
City. And of these majority was admitted free to delegate seats, board
and lodging. Sir Syed Ahmad&rsquo;s anti-Congress League had tried in a
public meeting to dissuade Moslems from joining the Congress as
delegates. As a countermove the Congress people lighted the whole
Congress camp some four nights before the session began and advertised
that that night would be free. The result was that all the &ldquo;Chandul
Khanas&rdquo; of Lucknow were emptied and a huge audience of some thirty
thousand Hindus and Moslems was addressed from half a dozen platforms.
It was then that the Moslem delegates were elected or selected. All
this was admitted by the Lucknow Congress organisers to me in private.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A show was being made of the Moslem delegates. Moslem delegate gets
up to second a resolution in Urdu. He begins: &lsquo;Hozarat, I am a
Mahomedan delegate.&rsquo; Some Hindu delegate gets up and calls for three
cheers for Mahomedan delegates and the response is so enthusiastic as
to be beyond description.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>In taking up the cause of Khilafat Mr. Gandhi achieved a double
purpose. He carried the Congress Plan of winning over the Muslims to its
culmination. Secondly he made the Congress a power in the country, which
it would not have been, if the Muslims had not joined it. The cause of
the Khilafat appealed to the Musalmans far more than political
safeguards, with the result that the Musalmans who were outside it
trooped into the Congress. The Hindus welcomed them. For, they saw in
this a common front against the British, which was their main aim. The
credit for this must of course go to Mr. Gandhi. For there can be no
doubt that this was an act of great daring.</p>
<p>When the Musalmans in 1919 approached the Hindus for participation
in the Non-co-operation Movement which the Muslims desired to start for
helping Turkey and the Khilafat, the Hindus were found to be divided in
three camps. One was a camp of those who were opposed to
non-co-operation in principle. A second camp consisted of those Hindus
who were prepared to join the Muslims in their campaign of
non-co-operation provided the Musalmans agreed to give up Cow Slaughter.
A third group consisted of the Hindus who feared that the Mahomedans
might extend their non-co-operation to inviting the Afghans to invade
India, in which case the movement instead of resulting in Swaraj might
result in the subjection of India to Muslim Raj.</p>
<p>Mr. Gandhi did not care for those Hindus who were opposed to joining
the Muslims in the Non-co-operation Movement. But with regard to the
others he told them that their attitude was unfortunate. To those Hindus
who wanted to give their support on the condition that the Muslims give
up cow killing, Mr. Gandhi said:<strong><a href="#n07">/7/</a></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I submit that the Hindus may not open the Goraksha (cow protection)
question here. The test of friendship is assistance in adversity, and
that too, unconditional assistance. Co-operation that needs
consideration is a commercial contract and not friendship. Conditional
co-operation is like adulterated cement which does not bind. It is the
duty of the Hindus, if they see the justice of the Mahomedan cause to
render co-operation. If the Mahomedans feel themselves bound in honour
to spare the Hindu&rsquo;s feelings and to stop cow killing, they may do so,
no matter whether the Hindus co-operate with them or not. Though
therefore, I yield to no Hindu in my worship of the cow, I do not want
to make the stopping of cow killing a condition precedent to
co-operation. Unconditional co-operation means the protection of the
cow.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>To those Hindus who feared to join the Non-co-operation Movement for
the reasons that Muslims may invite the Afghans to invade India, Mr.
Gandhi said:<strong><a href="#n08">/8/</a></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It is easy enough to understand and justify the Hindu caution. It is
difficult to resist the Mahomedan position. In my opinion, the best
way to prevent India from becoming the battle ground between the
forces of Islam and those of the English is for Hindus to make
non-co-operation a complete and immediate success, and I have little
doubt that, if the Mahomedans remain true to their declared intention
and are able to exercise self-restraint and make sacrifices, the
Hindus will &lsquo;play the game&rsquo; and join them in the campaign of
non-co-operation. I feel equally certain that Hindus will not assist
Mahomedans in promoting or bringing about an armed conflict between
the British Government and their allies, and Afghanistan. British
forces are too well organised to admit of any successful invasion of
the Indian frontier. The only way, therefore, the Mahomedans can carry
on an effective struggle on behalf of the honour of Islam is to take
up non-co-operation in real earnest. It will not only be completely
effective if it is adopted by the people on an extensive scale, but it
will also provide full scope for individual conscience. If I cannot
bear an injustice done by an individual or a corporation, and, I am
directly or indirectly instrumental in upholding that individual or
corporation, I must answer for it before my Maker; but I have done all
that is humanly possible for me to do consistently with the moral code
that refuses to injure even the wrong-doers, if I cease to support the
injustice in the manner described above. In applying, therefore, such
a great force, there should be no haste, there should be no temper
shown. Non-co-operation must be and remain absolutely a voluntary
effort. The whole thing, then, depends upon Mahomedans themselves. If
they will but help themselves, Hindu help will come and the
Government, great and mighty though it is, will have to bend before
the bloodless opposition of a whole nation.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, the hope of Mr. Gandhi that &rsquo;no Government can
possibly withstand the bloodless opposition of a whole nation&rsquo; did not
come true. Within a year of the starting of the Non-co-operation
Movement, Mr. Gandhi had to admit that the. Musalmans had grown
impatient and that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In their impatient anger, the Musalmans ask for more energetic and
more prompt action by the Congress and Khilafat organisations. To the
Musalmans, Swaraj means, as it must mean, India&rsquo;s ability to deal
effectively with the Khilafat question. The Musalmans, therefore,
decline to wait if the attainment of Swaraj means indefinite delay of
a programme that may require the Musalmans of India to become impotent
witnesses of the extinction of Turkey in European waters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is impossible not to sympathise with this attitude. I would gladly
recommend immediate action if I could think of any effective course. I
would gladly ask for postponement of Swaraj activity if thereby we
could advance the interest of Khilafat. I could gladly take up
measures outside non-co-operation, if I could think of any, in order
to assuage the pain caused to the millions of the Musalmans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, in my humble opinion, attainment of Swaraj is the quickest
method of righting the Khilafat wrong. Hence it is, that for me the
solution of the Khilafat question is attainment of Swaraj and vice
versa. The only way to help the affiliated Turks is for India to
generate sufficient power to be able to assert herself. If she cannot
develop that power in time, there is no way out for India and she must
resign herself to the inevitable. What can a paralytic do to stretch
forth a helping hand to a neighbour but to try to cure himself of his
paralysis? Mere ignorant, thoughtless and angry outburst of violence
may give vent to pent-up rage but can bring no relief to Turkey.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>The Musalmans were not in a mood to listen to the advice of Mr.
Gandhi. They refused to worship the principle of non-violence. They were
not prepared to wait for Swaraj. They were in a hurry to find the most
expeditious means of helping Turkey and saving the Khilafat. And the
Muslims in their impatience did exactly what the Hindus feared they
would do, namely, invite the Afghans to invade India. How far the
Khilafatists had proceeded in their negotiations with the Amir of
Afghanistan it is not possible to know. But that such a project was
entertained by them is beyond question. It needs no saying that the
project of an invasion of India was the most dangerous project and every
sane Indian would dissociate himself from so mad a project. What part
Mr. Gandhi played in this project it is not possible to discover.
Certainly he did not dissociate himself from it. On the contrary, his
misguided zeal for Swaraj, and his obsession on Hindu-Moslem unity as
the only means of achieving it, led him to support the project. Not only
did he advise**<a href="#n09">/9/</a>** the Amir not to enter into any treaty with
the British Government but declared:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I would, in a sense, certainly assist the Amir of Afghanistan if he
waged war against the British Government. That is to say, I would
openly tell my countrymen that it would be a crime to help a
government which had lost the confidence of the nation to remain in
power.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Can any sane man go so far, for the sake of Hindu-Moslem unity? But,
Mr. Gandhi was so attached to Hindu-Moslem unity that he did not stop to
enquire what he was really doing in this mad endeavour. So anxious was
Mr. Gandhi in laying the foundation of Hindu-Moslem unity well and
truly, that he did not forget to advise his followers regarding the
national crisis. In an Article in <strong>Young India</strong> of 8th September 1920
Mr. Gandhi said :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;During the Madras tour, at Bezwada I had occasion to remark upon the
national crisis and suggested that it would be better to have cries
about ideals than men. I asked the audience to replace Mahatma
Gandhi-ki-jai and Mahomed Ali Shoukat Ali-ki-jai by
Hindu-Musalman-ki-jai. Brother Shoukat Ali, who followed, positively
laid down the law. In spite of the Hindu-Muslim unity, he had observed
that, if Hindus shouted Bande Mataram, the Muslims rang out with
Allaho Akbar and <em>vice versa</em>. This, he rightly said jarred on the ear
and still showed that the people did not act with one mind. There
should be therefore only three cries recognised. Allaho Akbar to be
joyously sung out by Hindus and Muslims, showing that God alone was
great and no other. The second should be Bande Malaram (Hail
Motherland) or Bharat Mata-ki-jai (Victory to Mother Hind). The third
should be Hindu-Musalman-ki-jai without which there was no victory for
India, and no true demonstration of the greatness of God.. I do wish
that the newspapers and public men would take up the Maulana&rsquo;s
suggestion and lead the people only to use the three cries. They are
full of meaning. The first is a prayer and confession of our
littleness and therefore a sign of humility. It is a cry in which all
Hindus and Muslims should join in reverence and prayfulness. Hindus
may not fight shy of Arabic words, when their meaning is not only
totally inoffensive but even ennobling. God is no respecter of any
particular tongue. Bande Mataram, apart from its wonderful
associations, expresses the one national wish—the rise of India to her
full height. And I should prefer Bande Mataram to Bharat Mata-ki-jai,
as it would be a graceful recognition of the intellectual and
emotional superiority of Bengal. Since India can be nothing without
the union of the Hindu and the Muslim heart, Hindu-Musalman-ki-jai is
a cry which we may never forget.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There should be no discordance in these cries. Immediately some one
has taken up any of the three cries, the rest should take it up and
not attempt to yell out their favourite. Those, who do not wish to
join, may refrain, but should consider it a breach of etiquette to
interpolate their own when a cry has already been raised. It would be
better too, always to follow out the three cries in the order given
above.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>These are not the only things Mr. Gandhi has done to build up
Hindu-Moslem unity. He has never called the Muslims to account even when
they have been guilty of gross crimes against Hindus.</p>
<p>It is a notorious fact that many prominent Hindus who had offended
the religious susceptibilities of the Muslims either by their writings
or by their part in the Shudhi movement have been murdered by some
fanatic Musalmans. First to suffer was Swami Shradhanand, who was shot
by Abdul Rashid on 23rd December 1926 when he was lying in his sick bed.
This was followed by the murder of Lala Nanakchand, a prominent Arya
Samajist of Delhi. Rajpal, the author of the <strong>Rangila Rasool</strong>, was
stabbed by Ilamdin on 6th April 1929 while he was sitting in his shop.
Nathuramal Sharma was murdered by Abdul Qayum in September 1934. It was
an act of great daring. For Sharma was stabbed to death in the Court of
the Judicial Commissioner of Sind where he was seated awaiting the
hearing of his appeal against his conviction under Section 195, 1. P.
C., for the publication of a pamphlet on the history of Islam. Khanna,
the Secretary of the Hindu Sabha, was severely assaulted in 1938 by the
Mahomedans after the Session of the Hindu Maha Sabha held in Ahmedabad
and very narrowly escaped death.</p>
<p>This is, of course, a very short list and could be easily expanded.
But whether the number of prominent Hindus killed by fanatic Muslims is
large or small matters little. What matters is the attitude of those who
count, towards these murderers. The murderers paid the penalty of law
where law is enforced. The leading Moslems, however, never condemned
these criminals. On the contrary, they were hailed as religious martyrs
and agitation was carried on for clemency being shown to them. As an
illustration of this attitude, one may refer to Mr. Barkat Alli, a
Barrister of Lahore, who argued the appeal of Abdul Qayum. He went to
the length of saying that Qayum was not guilty of murder of Nathuramal
because his act was justifiable by the law of the Koran. This attitude
of the Moslems is quite understandable. What is not understandable is
the attitude of Mr. Gandhi.</p>
<p>Mr. Gandhi has been very punctilious in the matter of condemning any
and every act of violence and has forced the Congress, much against its
will to condemn it. But Mr. Gandhi has never protested against such
murders. Not only have the Musalmans not condemned**<a href="#n10">/10/</a>** these
outrages but even Mr. Gandhi has never called upon the leading Muslims
to condemn them. He has kept silent over them. Such an attitude can be
explained only on the ground that Mr. Gandhi was anxious to preserve
Hindu-Moslem unity and did not mind the murders of a few Hindus, if it
could be achieved by sacrificing their lives.</p>
<p>This attitude to excuse the Muslims any wrong, lest it should injure
the cause of unity, is well illustrated by what Mr. Gandhi had to say in
the matter of the Mopla riots.</p>
<p>The blood-curdling atrocities committed by the Moplas in Malabar
against the Hindus were indescribable. All over Southern India, a wave
of horrified feeling had spread among the Hindus of every shade of
opinion, which was intensified when certain Khilafat leaders were so
misguided as to pass resolutions of &ldquo;congratulations to the Moplas on
the brave fight they were conducting for the sake of religion.&rdquo; Any
person could have said that this was too heavy a price for Hindu-Moslem
unity. But Mr. Gandhi was so much obsessed by the necessity of
establishing Hindu-Moslem unity that he was prepared to make light of
the doings of the Moplas and the Khilafats who were congratulating them.
He spoke of the Moplas as the &ldquo;brave God-fearing Moplas who were
fighting for what they consider as religion and in a manner which they
consider as religious.&rdquo; Speaking of the Muslim silence over the Mopla
atrocities Mr. Gandhi told the Hindus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The Hindus must have the courage and the faith to feel that they can
protect their religion in spite of such fanatical eruptions. A verbal
disapproval by the Mussalmans of Mopla madness is no test of Mussalman
friendship. The Mussalmans must naturally feel the shame and
humiliation of the Mopla conduct about forcible conversions and
looting, and they must work away so silently and effectively that such
a thing might become impossible even on the part of the most fanatical
among them. My belief is that the Hindus as a body have received the
Mopla madness with equanimity and that the cultured Mussalmans are
sincerely sorry of the Mopla&rsquo;s perversion of the teaching of the
Prophet.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>The Resolution**<a href="#n11">/11/</a>** passed by the Working Committee of
the Congress on the Mopla atrocities shows how careful the Congress was
not to hurt the feelings of the Musalmans.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The Working Committee places on record its sense of deep regret over
the deeds of violence done by Moplas in certain areas of Malbar, these
deeds being evidence of the fact that there are still people in India
who have not understood the message of the Congress and the Central
Khilafat Committee, and calls upon every Congress and Khilafat worker
to spread the said message of non-violence even under the gravest
provocation throughout the length and breadth of India.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whilst, however, condemning violence on the part of the Moplas, the
working Committee desires it to be known that the evidence in its
possession shows that provocation beyond endurance was given to the
Moplas and that the reports published by and on behalf of the
Government have given a one-sided and highly exaggerated account of
the wrongs done by the Moplas and an understatement of the needless
destruction of life resorted to by the Government in the name of peace
and order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Working Committee regrets to find that there have been instances
of so-called forcible conversion by some fanatics among Moplas, but
warms the public against believing in the Government and inspired
versions. The Report before the Committee says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The families, which have been reported to have been forcibly
converted into Mahomedanism, lived in the neighbourhood of Manjeri. It
is clear that conversions were forced upon Hindus by a fanatic gang
which was always opposed to the Khilafat and Non-co-operation Movement
and there were only three cases so far as our information goes.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>The following instances of Muslim intransigence, over which Mr.
Gandhi kept mum, are recorded by Swami Shradhanand in his weekly journal
called the <strong>Liberator</strong>. Writing in the issue of 30th September 1926
the Swamiji says :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;As regards the removal of untouchability it has been authoritatively
ruled several times that it is the duty of Hindus to expiate for their
past sins and non-Hindus should have nothing to do with it But the
Mahomedan and the Christian Congressmen have openly revolted against
the dictum of Mr. Gandhi at Vaikom and other places. Even such an
unbiased leader as Mr. Yakub Hassan, presiding over a meeting called
to present an address to me at Madras, openly enjoined upon Musalmans
the duty of converting all the untouchables in India to Islam.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>But Mr. Gandhi said nothing by way of remonstrance either to the
Muslims or to the Christians.</p>
<p>In his issue of July 1926 the Swami writes :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There was another prominent fact to which I drew the attention of
Mahatma Gandhi. Both of us went together one night to the Khilafat
Conference at Nagpur. The Ayats (verses) of the Quran recited by the
Maulanas on that occasion, contained frequent references to Jihad and
killing of the Kaffirs.But when I drew his attention to this phase of
the Khilafat movement, Mahatmaji smiled and said, &lsquo;They are alluding
to the British Bureaucracy.&rsquo; In reply I said that it was all
subversive of the idea of non-violence and when the reversion of
feeling came the Mahomedan Maulanas would not refrain from using these
verses against the Hindus.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>The Swami &rsquo;s third instance relates to the Mopla riots. Writing in
the <strong>Liberator</strong> of 26th August 1926 the Swami says :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The first warning was sounded when the question of condemning the
Moplas for their atrocities on Hindus came up in the Subjects
Committee. The original resolution condemned the Moplas wholesale
for the killing of Hindus and burning of Hindu homes and the forcible
conversion to Islam. The Hindu members themselves proposed amendments
till it was reduced to condemning only certain individuals who had
been guilty of the above crimes. But some of the Moslem leaders could
not bear this even. Maulana Fakir and other Maulanas, of course,
opposed the resolution and there was no wonder. But I was surprised,
an out-and-out Nationalist like Maulana Hasrat Mohani opposed the
resolution on the ground that the Mopla country no longer remained
Dar-ul-Aman but became Dar-ul-Harab and they suspected the Hindus of
collusion with the British enemies of the Moplas. Therefore, the
Moplas were right in presenting the Quran or sword to the Hindus. And
if the Hindus became Mussalmans to save themselves from death, it was
a voluntary change of faith and not forcible conversion—Well, even the
harmless resolution condemning some of the Moplas was not unanimously
passed but had to be accepted by a majority of votes only. There were
other indications also, showing that the Mussalmans considered the
Congress to be existing on their sufferance and if there was the least
attempt to ignore their idiosyncracies the superficial unity would be
scrapped asunder.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>The last one refers to the burning of the foreign cloth started by
Mr. Gandhi. Writing in the <strong>Liberator</strong> of 31st August 1926 the Swamiji
says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;While people came to the conclusion, that the burning of foreign
cloth was a religious duty of Indians and Messrs. Das, Nehru and other
topmost leaders made bon-fire of cloth worth thousands, the Khilafat
Musalmans got permission from Mahatmaji to <em>send all foreign cloth for
the use</em> of the Turkish brethren. This again was a great shock to me.
While Mahatmaji stood adamant and did not have the least regard for
Hindu feelings when a question of principle was involved, for the
Moslem dereliction of duty, there was always a soft corner in his
heart.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>In the history of his efforts to bring about Hindu-Moslem unity
mention must be made of two incidents. One is the Fast, which Mr. Gandhi
underwent in the year 1924. It was a fast of 21 days. Before undertaking
the fast Mr. Gandhi explained the reasons for it in a statement from
which the following extracts are taken:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The fact that Hindus and Musalmans, who were only two years ago
apparently working together as friends, are now fighting like cats and
dogs in some places, shows conclusively that the non-co-operation they
offered was not non-violent. I saw the symptoms in Bombay, Chauri
Chaura and in a host of minor cases. I did penance then. It had its
effects <em>protanto</em>. But this Hindu-Muslim tension was unthinkable. It
became unbearable on hearing of the Kohat tragedy. On the eve of my
departure from Sabarmati for Delhi, Sarojini Devi wrote to me that
speeches and homilies on peace would not do. I must find out an
effective remedy. She was right in saddling the responsibility on me.
Had I not been instrumental in bringing into being the vast energy of
the people? I must find the remedy if the energy proved
self-destructive.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was violently shaken by Amethi, Sambhal and Gulbarga. I had read
the reports about Amethi and Sambhal prepared by Hindu and Musalman
friends. I had learnt the joint finding of Hindu and Musalman friends
who went to Gulbarga. I was writhing in deep pain and yet I had no
remedy. The news of Kohal set the smouldering mass aflame. Something
had got to be done. I passed two nights in restlessness and pain. On
Wednesday I knew the remedy. I must do penance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a warning to the Hindus and Musalmans who have professed to
love me. If they have loved me truly and if I have been deserving of
their love, they will do penance with me for the grave sin of denying
God in their hearts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The penance of Hindus and Mussalmans is not fasting but retracting
their steps. It is true penance for a Mussalman to harbour no ill-will
for his Hindu brother and an equally true penance for a Hindu to
harbour none for his Mussalman brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not consult friends—not even Hakim Saheb who was close with me
for a long lime on Wednesday—not Maulana Mahomed Ali under whose roof
I am enjoying the privilege of hospitality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But was it right for me to go through the fast under a Mussalman
roof? (Gandhi was at that time the guest of Mr. Mahomed Ali at Delhi.)
Yes, it was. The fast is not born out of ill-will against a single
soul. My being under a Mussalman roof ensures it against any such
interpretation. It is in the fitness of things that this fast should
be taken up and completed in a Mussalman house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who is Mahomed Ali? Only two days before the fast we had a
discussion about a private matter in which I had told him what was
mine was his and what was his was mine. Let me gratefully tell the
public that I have never received warmer or better treatment than
under Mahomed Ali&rsquo;s roof. Every want of mine is anticipated. The
dominant thought of every one of his household is to make me and mine
happy and comfortable. Doctors Ansari and Abdur Rehman have
constituted themselves my medical advisers. They examine me daily. I
have had many a happy occasion in my life. This is no less happy than
the previous ones. Bread is not everything. I am experiencing here the
richest love. It is more than bread for me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been whispered that by going so much with Mussalman friends, I
make myself unfit to know the Hindu mind. The Hindu mind is myself.
Surely I do not live amidst Hindus to know the Hindu mind when every
fibre of my being is Hindu. My Hinduism must be a very poor thing if
it cannot flourish under influences the most adverse. I know
instinctively what is necessary for Hinduism. But I must labour to
discover the Mussalman mind. The closer I come to the best of
Mussalmans, the juster I am likely to be in my estimate of the
Mussalmans and their doings. I am striving to become the best cement
between the two communities. My longing is to be able to cement the
two with my blood, if necessary. But, before I can do so, I must prove
to the Mussalmans that I love them as well as I love the Hindus. My
religion teaches me to love all equally. May God help me to do so! My
fast among other things is meant to qualify me for achieving that
equal and selfless love.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>The fast produced Unity Conferences. But the Unity Conferences
produced nothing except pious resolutions which were broken as soon as
they were announced.</p>
<p>This short historical sketch of the part Mr. Gandhi played in
bringing about Hindu-Moslem unity may be concluded by a reference to the
attitude of Mr. Gandhi in the negotiations about the Communal
Settlement. He offered the Muslims a blank cheque. The blank cheque only
served to exasperate the Muslims, as they interpreted it as an act of
evasion. He opposed the separate electorates at the Round Table
Conference. When they were given to the Muslims by the Communal Award,
Mr. Gandhi and the Congress did not approve of them. But when it came to
voting upon it, they took the strange attitude of neither approving it
nor opposing it.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#m02">/2/</a></strong> <strong>Young India</strong>, 2nd June 1920.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#m03">/3/</a></strong> &ldquo;In view of the fact that on the Khilafat question both
the Indian and Imperial Governments have signally failed in their duty
towards the Muslims of India and the Prime Minister has deliberately
broken his pledged word given to them, and that it is the duty of every
non-Muslim Indian in every legitimate manner to assist his Muslim
brother in his attempt to remove the religious calamity that has
overtaken him;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in view of the fact that, in the matter of the events of the April
of 1919, both the said Governments have grossly neglected or failed to
protect the innocent people of the Punjab and punish officers guilty of
unsoldierly and barbarous behaviour towards them, and have exonerated
Sir Michael O&rsquo;Dwyer who proved himself directly responsible for most of
the official crimes and callous to the sufferings of the people placed
under his administration, and that the debate in the House of Lords
betrayed a woeful lack of sympathy with the people of India, and
systematic terrorism and frightfulness adopted in the Punjab, and that
the latest Viceregal pronouncement is proof of entire absence of
repentance in the matters of the Khilafat and the Punjab;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This Congress is of opinion that there can be no contentment in India
without redress of the two aforementioned wrongs, and that the only
effectual means to vindicate national honour and to prevent a repetition
of similar wrongs in future is the establishment of Swarajya.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This Congress is further of opinion that there is no course left open
for the people of India but to approve of and adopt the policy of
progressive non-violent non-co-operation inaugurated by Mahatma Gandhi,
until the said wrongs are righted and Swarajya is established.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Annie Besant says: &ldquo;It will be remembered that Mr. Gandhi, in March
1920, had forbidden the mixing up of non-co-operation in defence of the
Khilafat with other questions; but it was found that the Khilafat was
not sufficiently attractive to Hindus,&rdquo; so at the meeting of the
All-India Congress Committee held at Benares on May 30 and 31, the
Punjab atrocities and the deficiencies of the Reforms Act were added to
the list of provocative causes.—<strong>The Future of Indian Politics</strong>, p.
250.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#m04">/4/</a></strong> Mr. Gandhi repudiated the suggestion of the <strong>Modern
Review</strong> and regarded it as &ldquo;crudest cut.&rdquo; Dealing with the criticism of
the <strong>Modern Review</strong> in his Article in <strong>Young India</strong> for 20th October
1921 Mr. Gandhi said, &ldquo;I claim that with us both the Khilafat is the
central fact, with Maulana Mahomed Ali because it is his religion, with
me because, in laying down my life for the Khilafat, I ensure safely of
the cow, that is my religion, from the Musalman knife.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong><a href="#m05">/5/</a></strong> The Resolution of non-co-operation was carried by 1886
voles against 884. The late Mr. Tairsee once told me that a large
majority of the delegates were no others than the taxi drivers of
Calcutta who were paid to vote for the non-co-operation resolution.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#m10">/10/</a></strong> It is reported that for earning merit for the soul of
Abdul Rashid, the murderer of Swami Shradhanand, in the next world, the
students and professors of the famous theological college at Deoband
finished five complete recitations of the Koran and had planned to
finish daily a lakh and a quarter recitations of Koranic verses. Their
prayer was &ldquo;God Almighty may give the marhoom (i.e., Rashid) a place in
the &lsquo;a &lsquo;ala-e-illeeyeen (the summit of the seventh heaven).&quot;— <strong>Times of

<p><strong><a href="#m11">/11/</a></strong> The resolution says that then were only three cases of
forcible conversion!! In reply to a question in the Central Legislature
(<strong>Debates</strong> 16th January 1922) Sir William Vincent replied: &ldquo;The Madras
Government report that the number of forcible conversions probably runs
to thousands but that for obvious reasons it will never be possible to
obtain anything like an accurate estimate.&rdquo;</p>
