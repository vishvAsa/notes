## Maqbool Sherwani
Maqbool Sherwani was a young Kashmiri Muslim from Baramulla who stalled Pakistani tribal raiders in October 1947 by misleading them with false reports of heavy Indian troop presence ahead. His deception delayed their advance on Srinagar for crucial days, enabling the Indian Army's airlifted reinforcements to arrive and defend the valley. Captured and martyred on November 7, he's remembered as the "Lion of Baramulla" for saving Kashmir from falling to invaders.
