Utter imbecile @AndreasKoureas_ has the audacity to whitewash the war crimes of Winston Churchill who he says sent “900,000 tons of grain to India between August 1943 (when news of famine reached Westminster) and December 1944” which he claims Churchill sent out of “concern for Indians”.

Winston Churchill’s actions during the Bengal Famine of 1943 were not just negligent - they were deliberate acts of genocidal cruelty fueled by racism and imperial greed. Claims like those of Andreas Koreas, attempting to paint Churchill as a mere "paternalistic imperialist", collapse under the weight of historical evidence. Let’s debunk Andreas’s mendacious drivel claim by lying claim:

## Claim 1: News of famine only reached Westminster in August 1943.

Truth: Churchill’s administration knew of the impending famine nearly a year before it unfolded. On December 18, 1942, the Food Department of India sent a desperate telegram to the British Secretary of State, warning of catastrophic food shortages caused by monsoon failure (Image 1). The plea was unequivocal: India faced a shortfall of 1.4 million tons of rice, 650,000 tons of millets, 400,000 tons of wheat, and 200,000 tons of gram. The message was clear: immediate assistance was required to avoid disaster.

Yet, Churchill not only withheld aid—his administration forced India to export 360,000 tons of wheat and rice in 1942–43. This grain, which could have saved two million Indian lives, was diverted to support British war efforts. Churchill had eight months to act but deliberately chose inaction.

## Claim 2: Churchill sent food out of “concern for Indians.”
Truth: Churchill’s policies were rooted in contempt for Indian lives. Viceroy Wavell’s journal reveals that during a September 1943 Cabinet meeting, Churchill raged against sending food relief to India, insisting that supplies should instead be stockpiled for liberated European nations like Greece (Image 2). Wavell’s damning words capture Churchill’s callousness:

> "Apparently it is more important to save the Greeks and liberated countries from starvation than the Indians."

Churchill clearly commanded that relief should be restricted ONLY to those directly contributing to British war efforts, such as British army soldiers and factory/railroad workers, while leaving millions of the most helpless ordinary civilians to starve. 

## Claim 3: 900,000 tons of grain were sent to India between August 1943 and December 1944.

Truth: This is a deviously misleading calculated half-truth. While approximately 900,000 tons of grain were sent, Churchill did not intend this food for Indian civilians. Viceroy Wavell’s June 24, 1944 telegram makes it clear that this grain was needed to feed the British Army stationed in India (image 3). He warned Churchill that bases were “liable to starvation” if food was not imported. The British military alone required over 1 million tons of grain annually for its operations, leaving no meaningful relief for starving Indian civilians (Image 4). Churchill’s shipments were not humanitarian aid at all - they were clinically heartless logistical measures granted only to sustain Britain’s war machine.

In a further act of cruelty, Churchill’s administration coerced famine-stricken India to export 70,000 tons of rice to Ceylon in 1944. Britain agreed to send 150,000 tons of wheat to India only if India supplied an equivalent amount of rice to Ceylon. Such policies reveal Churchill’s true priorities: maintaining imperial dominance, no matter the human cost of Indian lives.

## Conclusion
The Bengal Famine of 1943 was not an unavoidable calamity - it was a man-made atrocity, orchestrated by Churchill’s racist and imperialist policies. Under his leadership, 3–5 million Indians died, not because of natural disaster but because Churchill prioritized British interests over Indian lives. His infamous comment to Leo Amery that “famine relief would do no good because Indians breed like rabbits” lays bare the contempt he held for millions of Indians dying in agony after Britain had sucked all of India's resources dry. To Churchill, the death of millions was not a tragedy - it was pest control of the Indians he held in such contempt.

Churchill’s actions were not only cruel but genocidal in intent. He deliberately exacerbated famine conditions by denying vital food shipments to India, exporting vital resources from India, ignoring urgent warnings, desperate pleas for help and hoarding grain for British soldiers and European allies. To compare him to Hitler may seem provocative, but for the millions of Indians who starved under his regime, the suffering was no less real.

Andreas Koreas and other apologists for Churchill’s war crimes peddle a revisionist narrative that insults the memory of the millions who died under his regime. The evidence is irrefutable: Winston Churchill was no hero. For India, he was a murderous tyrant whose policies inflicted unspeakable suffering. The Bengal Famine remains a permanent and horrific stain on Winston Churchill's legacy, a chilling reminder of the horrors of imperialism, and an indictment of those who seek to glorify it.
