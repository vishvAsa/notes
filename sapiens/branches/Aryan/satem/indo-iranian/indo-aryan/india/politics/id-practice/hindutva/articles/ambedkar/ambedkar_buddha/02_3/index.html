§1. Conversion of Yashas
There lived in the town of Benares a nobleman’s son called Yashas. He was young in years and very attractive in appearance. He was beloved of his parents. He lived in abounding wealth. He had a big retinue and a large harem, and passed his time in nothing but dancing, drinking and carnal pleasures. As time past [=passed], a feeling of disgust came over him. How could he escape from this orgy? Was there any better way of life than the way he was leading? Not knowing what to do, he decided to leave his father’s house. One night he left his father’s house and was wandering about; He happened to wend his way towards Isipathana. Feeling tired, he sat down; and as he was seated he said to himself in loud tones, ‘Where am I, what is the way? Alas! What distress; alas! What danger!’ This happened on the night of the same day on which the Blessed One preached his first sermon to the Panchavargiya Bhikkus at Isipathana. Just when Yashas was approaching Isipathana, the Blessed One, who was staying at Isipathana, having arisen at dawn, was walking up and down in the open. air. And the Blessed One saw Yashas, the noble youth coming from [Benares?] after giving utterance to his feelings. And the Blessed One, having heard his cry of distress, said, “There is no distress, there is no danger. Come, I will show you the way,” and the Blessed Lord preached his gospel to Yashas. And Yashas, when he heard it, became glad and joyful; and he put off his gilt slippers, and went and sat down near the Blessed One and respectedly saluted him. Yashas, hearing the Buddha’s words, requested the Blessed One to take him as his disciple. Then he bade him come, and asked him to be a Bhikku, to which Yashas agreed. The parents of Yashas were in great distress on finding that their son had disappeared. The father started in search. Yashas’s father passed by the same spot where the Lord and Yashas in the Bhikku’s garb were seated, and in passing, he asked the Blessed One, “Pray, have you seen Yashas, my son?” The Lord replied, “Come in, Sir, you will find your son.” He went in and sat near his son, but he knew him not. The Lord explained to him how Yashas met him, and how on hearing him he became a Bhikku. The father then recognised his son and was happy his son had chosen the right path. “My son, Yashas,” said the father, “your mother is absorbed in lamentations and grief. Return home and restore your mother to life.” Then Yashas looked at the Blessed One, and the Blessed One said to Yashas’s father, “Is that your wish, that Yashas should return to the world and enjoy the pleasures of a worldly life as he did before?” And Yasha’s father replied, “If Yashas, my son, finds it a gain to stay with you, let him stay.” Yashas preferred to remain a Bhikku. Before departing Yashas’s father said, “May the Blessed One, O Lord, consent to take his meal at my home with the members of my family.” The Blessed One, having donned his robes, took his alms bowl and went with Yashas to the house of his father. When they arrived there, they met the mother and also the former wife of Yashas. After the meal, the Blessed One preached to the members of the family his doctrine. They became very happy and promised to take refuge in it. Now there were four friends of Yashas belonging to the wealthy family [=families] of Benares. Their names were Vimala, Subahu, Punyajit ,and Gavampati. When Yashas’s friends learned that Yashas had taken refuge in the Buddha and his Dhamma, they felt that what is [=was] good for Yashas must be good for them. So they went to Yashas and asked him to approach the Buddha on their behalf, to receive them as his disciples. Yashas agreed and he went to the Buddha, saying, “May the Blessed One preach the Dhamma to these four friends of mine.” The Lord agreed, and Yashas’s friends took refuge in the Dhamma. § 2.

<p>§1. Conversion of Yashas</p>
<ol>
<li>There lived in the town of Benares a nobleman&rsquo;s son called
Yashas. He was young in years and very attractive in appearance. He
was beloved of his parents. He lived in abounding wealth. He had a big
retinue and a large harem, and passed his time in nothing but dancing,
drinking and carnal pleasures.</li>
<li>As time past [=passed], a feeling of disgust came over him.
How could he escape from this orgy? Was there any better way of life
than the way he was leading? Not knowing what to do, he decided to
leave his father&rsquo;s house.</li>
<li>One night he left his father&rsquo;s house and was wandering about;
He happened to wend his way towards Isipathana.</li>
<li>Feeling tired, he sat down; and as he was seated he said to
himself in loud tones, &lsquo;Where am I, what is the way? Alas! What
distress; alas! What danger!&rsquo;</li>
<li>This happened on the night of the same day on which the Blessed
One preached his first sermon to the Panchavargiya Bhikkus at
Isipathana. Just when Yashas was approaching Isipathana, the Blessed
One, who was staying at Isipathana, having arisen at dawn, was walking
up and down in the open. air. And the Blessed One saw Yashas, the
noble youth coming from [Benares?] after giving utterance to his
feelings.</li>
<li>And the Blessed One, having heard his cry of distress, said,
&ldquo;There is no distress, there is no danger. Come, I will show you the
way,&rdquo; and the Blessed Lord preached his gospel to Yashas.</li>
<li>And Yashas, when he heard it, became glad and joyful; and he
put off his gilt slippers, and went and sat down near the Blessed One
and respectedly saluted him.</li>
<li>Yashas, hearing the Buddha&rsquo;s words, requested the Blessed One
to take him as his disciple.</li>
<li>Then he bade him come, and asked him to be a Bhikku, to which
Yashas agreed.</li>
<li>The parents of Yashas were in great distress on finding that
their son had disappeared. The father started in search. Yashas&rsquo;s
father passed by the same spot where the Lord and Yashas in the
Bhikku&rsquo;s garb were seated, and in passing, he asked the Blessed One,
&ldquo;Pray, have you seen Yashas, my son?&rdquo;</li>
<li>The Lord replied, &ldquo;Come in, Sir, you will find your son.&rdquo; He
went in and sat near his son, but he knew him not.</li>
<li>The Lord explained to him how Yashas met him, and how on
hearing him he became a Bhikku. The father then recognised his son and
was happy his son had chosen the right path.</li>
<li>&ldquo;My son, Yashas,&rdquo; said the father, &ldquo;your mother is absorbed in
lamentations and grief. Return home and restore your mother to
life.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Then Yashas looked at the Blessed One, and the Blessed One
said to Yashas&rsquo;s father, &ldquo;Is that your wish, that Yashas should return
to the world and enjoy the pleasures of a worldly life as he did
before?&rdquo;</li>
<li>And Yasha&rsquo;s father replied, &ldquo;If Yashas, my son, finds it a
gain to stay with you, let him stay.&rdquo; Yashas preferred to remain a
Bhikku.</li>
<li>Before departing Yashas&rsquo;s father said, &ldquo;May the Blessed One, O
Lord, consent to take his meal at my home with the members of my
family.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The Blessed One, having donned his robes, took his alms bowl
and went with Yashas to the house of his father.</li>
<li>When they arrived there, they met the mother and also the
former wife of Yashas. After the meal, the Blessed One preached to the
members of the family his doctrine. They became very happy and
promised to take refuge in it.</li>
<li>Now there were four friends of Yashas belonging to the wealthy
family [=families] of Benares. Their names were Vimala, Subahu,
Punyajit ,and Gavampati.</li>
<li>When Yashas&rsquo;s friends learned that Yashas had taken refuge in
the Buddha and his Dhamma, they felt that what is [=was] good for
Yashas must be good for them.</li>
<li>So they went to Yashas and asked him to approach the Buddha on
their behalf, to receive them as his disciples.</li>
<li>Yashas agreed and he went to the Buddha, saying, &ldquo;May the
Blessed One preach the Dhamma to these four friends of mine.&rdquo; The
Lord agreed, and Yashas&rsquo;s friends took refuge in the Dhamma.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 2. Conversion of the Kassyapas</p>
<ol>
<li>There lived in Benaras a family known as the Kassyapa family.
There were three sons in the family. They were very highly educated,
and carried on a rigorous religious life.</li>
<li>After some time the eldest son thought of taking up Sannyasa.
Accordingly he left his home, took Sannyasa, and went in the direction
of Uruvella, where he established his Ashram.</li>
<li>His two younger brothers followed him, and they too became
Sannyasis.</li>
<li>They were all Agnihotris, or worshippers of fire. They were
called Jatilas because they kept [=wore] long hair.</li>
<li>The three brothers were known as Uruvella Kassyapa, Nadi
Kassyapa (Kassyapa of the River, i.e., the Niranjana), and Gaya
Kassyapa (of the village Gaya).</li>
<li>Of these the Uruvella Kassyapa had a following of five hundred
Jatilas; Nadi Kassyapa had three hundred Jatilas as his disciples; and
Gaya Kassyapa had two hundred Jatilas. Of these the chief was Uruvella
Kassyapa.</li>
<li>The fame of Uruvella Kassyapa had spread far and wide. He was
known to have obtained Mukti (Salvation) while alive. People from
far-away places came to his Ashram, which was located on the banks of
the river Falgu.</li>
<li>The Blessed Lord, having come to know of the name and fame of
Uruvella Kassyapa, thought of preaching his gospel to him and if
possible [seeking] to convert him to his Dhamma.</li>
<li>Having come to know of his whereabouts, the Blessed Lord went
to Uruvella.</li>
<li>The Blessed One met him and, wanting to have an opportunity to
instruct him and convert him, said, &ldquo;If it is not disagreeable to you,
Kassyapa, let me dwell one night in your Ashram.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;I am not agreeable to this,&rdquo; said Kassyapa. &ldquo;There is a
savage Naga king called Muchalinda who rules over this place. He is
possessed of dreadful powers. He is the deadly enemy of all ascetics
performing fire worship. He pays nocturnal visits to their Ashrams and
does them great harm. I fear he may do you the same harm as he does to
me.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Kassyapa did not know that the Nagas had become the friends
and followers of the Blessed One. But the Blessed One knew it.</li>
<li>So the Blessed One pressed for his request, saying, &ldquo;He is not
likely to do any harm to me; pray, Kassyapa, allow me a place in your
fire room, for one night.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Kassyapa continued to raise many difficulties, and the Blessed
One continued to press his request.</li>
<li>Then Kassyapa said, &ldquo;My mind desires no controversy, only I
have my fears and apprehensions, but follow your own good pleasure.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The Blessed Lord forthwith stepped into the fire grove and
took his seat.</li>
<li>The Naga king Muchalinda came into the room at his usual time.
But instead of finding Kassyapa, he found the Blessed One seated in
his place.</li>
<li>Muchalinda, seeing the Lord seated, his face glowing with
peace and serenity, felt as though he was in the presence of a great
divinity, and bending his head, began to worship.</li>
<li>That night Kassyapa&rsquo;s sleep was very much disturbed by the
thought of what might have happened to his guest. So he got up with
great misgivings, fearing that his guest might have been burnt up.</li>
<li>Then Kassyapa and his followers at morning light came, one and
all, to have a look. Far from the Lord injured by Muchalinda, they
found Muchalinda worshipping the Lord.</li>
<li>Beholding the scene, Kassyapa felt that he was witnessing a
great miracle.</li>
<li>Struck by this miracle, Kassyapa requested the Blessed Lord to
stay near him and make an Ashram, and promised to look after him.</li>
<li>The Blessed Lord agreed to stay on.</li>
<li>The two, however, had different motives. Kassyapa&rsquo;s motive was
to obtain protection against Muchalinda Naga. The Blessed Lord thought
that one day Kassyapa will [=would] give him [an] opportunity to
propound his gospel.</li>
<li>But Kassyapa showed no such inclination. He thought that the
Blessed Lord was only a miracle maker and nothing more.</li>
<li>One day the Blessed Lord thought of himself taking the
initiative, and asked Kassyapa, &ldquo;Are you an Arhant?</li>
<li>&ldquo;If you are not an Arhant, what good is this Agnihotra going
to do to you?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Kassyapa said, &ldquo;I do not know what is to be an Arhant. Will
you explain it to me?&rdquo;</li>
<li>The Lord then told Kassyapa, &ldquo;An Arhant is one who has
conquered all the passions which disturb a man from pursuing the
eight-fold Path. Agnihotra cannot cleanse a man of his sins.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Kassyapa was a proud person. But he did feel the force of the
Blessed Lord&rsquo;s argument. Making his mind pliant and yielding, until at
length prepared to be a vehicle of the true law, he confessed that his
poor wisdom could not compare with the wisdom of the world-honoured
One.</li>
<li>And so, convinced at last, humbly submitting, Uruvella
Kassyapa accepted the doctrine of the Lord and became his follower.</li>
<li>Following their master, the followers of Kassyapa, virtuously
submissive, in turn received the teaching of the law. Kassyapa and all
his followers were thus entirely converted.</li>
<li>Uruvella Kassyapa then, lifting his goods and all his
sacrificial vessels, threw them together into the river, which floated
[them] down upon the surface of the current.</li>
<li>Nadi and Gaya, who dwelt down the stream, seeing these
articles of clothing (and the rest) floating along the stream [all]
disorderly, said, &ldquo;These are the belongings of our brother; why has he
thrown them away? Some great change has happened,&rdquo; and [they] were
deeply pained and restless. The two, each with five hundred followers,
went up the stream to seek their brother.</li>
<li>On seeing him and all his followers now dressed as hermits,
strange thoughts engaged their minds, and they inquired into the
reasons. Uruvella Kassyapa told them the story of his conversion to
the Buddha&rsquo;s Dhamma.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Our brother having submitted thus, we too should also follow
him,&rdquo; they said.</li>
<li>They conveyed their wishes to their eldest brother. Then the
two brothers, with all their band of followers, were brought to hear
the Lord&rsquo;s discourse on the comparison of a fire sacrifice with his
own gospel.</li>
<li>In his discourse to the two brothers the Blessed Lord said:
&ldquo;The dark smoke of ignorance arises, whilst confused thoughts, like
wood drilled into wood, create the fire.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Lust, anger, delusion, these are as fire produced, and these
enflame and burn all other things which cause grief and sorrow in the
world.</li>
<li>&ldquo;If once this way is found, and lust, anger and delusion
consumed, then with it is born sight, knowledge, and pure conduct.</li>
<li>&ldquo;So when the heart of a man has once conceived distaste for
sin, this distaste removes covetous desire; covetous desire
extinguished, there is recluse [=refuge?].&rdquo;</li>
<li>The great Rishis, listening to him, lost all regard for fire
worship, and wished to be the disciples of the Buddha.</li>
<li>The conversion of the Kassyapas was a great triumph for the
Blessed Lord. For they had a very strong hold on the imagination of
the people.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 3. Conversion of Sariputta and Moggallana</p>
<ol>
<li>While the Blessed Lord was in Rajagraha there resided [there]
a well-known person, by name Sanjaya, with a great retinue of
Parivrajakas numbering about two hundred and fifty as his disciples.</li>
<li>Among his disciples were Sariputta and Moggallana&ndash;two young
Brahmins.</li>
<li>Sariputta and Moggallana were not satisfied with the teachings
of Sanjaya, and were in search of something better.</li>
<li>Now one day the venerable Assaji, one of the Panchvargiya
Bhikkus, in the forenoon, having put on his under-robes, and having
taken his alms bowl and outer robe, entered the city of Rajagraha for
alms.</li>
<li>Sariputta was observing the dignified deportment of Assaji, and
was struck by it. On seeing the venerable Assaji, Sariputta thought,
&ldquo;Indeed this person is one of those monks who are the worthy ones in
the world. What if I were to approach this monk and to ask him, &lsquo;In
whose name, friend, have you retired from the world? Who is your
teacher? Whose Dhamma do you profess?&rsquo;&rdquo;</li>
<li>Now Sariputta thought, &quot; This is not the time to ask this monk;
he has entered the inner yard of a house for alms. What if I were to
follow this monk step by step, according to the course recognised by
those who want something?&rdquo;</li>
<li>And the venerable Assaji, having finished his alms pilgrimage
through Rajagraha, went back with the food he had received. Then
Sariputta went to the place where the venerable Assaji was; having
approached him, he exchanged greetings; and with complaisant words, he
stood at his side.</li>
<li>Standing at his side, the wandering ascetic Sariputta said to
the venerable Assaji, &ldquo;Your countenance, friend, is serene; your
complexion is pure and bright. In whose name, friend, have you retired
from the world? Who is your teacher? Whose Dhamma do you profess?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Assaji replied, &ldquo;There is, friend, the great recluse of the
Sakya&rsquo;s clan; in this Blessed One&rsquo;s name have I retired from the
world; this Blessed One is my teacher, and it is the Dhamma of this
Blessed One that I follow.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;And what, venerable Sir, is the doctrine which your teacher
holds? And what does he preach to you?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;I am only a young disciple, friend; I have but recently
received ordination; and I have newly adopted this Dhamma and
discipline. I cannot explain to you the Dhamma in detail; but I will
tell you in short what it means.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Then Sariputta, the wandering ascetic, said to the venerable
Assaj, &ldquo;So be it, friend, tell me as much or as little as you like,
but tell me the meaning, I want just meaning. Why make so much of the
letter?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Then the venerable Assaji explained to Sariputta the substance
of the teachings of the Buddha, and Sariputta was completely
satisfied.</li>
<li>Sariputta and Moggallana, though not brothers, were bound
together as hough they were brothers. They had given their word to
each other: he who first attains the truth shall tell the same to the
other one. That was their mutual engagement.</li>
<li>Accordingly Sariputta went to the place where Moggallana was.
Seeing him, he said to Sariputta, &ldquo;Your countenance, friend, is
serene; your complexion is pure and bright. Have you then really
reached the truth?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Yes, friend, I have come to know the truth.&rdquo; &ldquo;And how,
friend, have you done so?&rdquo; Then Sariputta told him what happened
between him and Assaji.</li>
<li>Then Moggallana said to Sariputta, &ldquo;Let us go, friend, and
join the Blessed One; that he, the Blessed One, may be our teacher.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Sariputta replied: &ldquo;It is on our account, friend, that these
two hundred and fifty wandering Parivrajakas live here, and it is we
whom they regard; let us first tell them before taking leave of them;
they will do what they think fit.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Then Sariputta and Moggallana went to the place where they
were; having approached them, they said to them, &ldquo;Friends, we are
going to join the Blessed One; he, the Blessed One, is our teacher.&rdquo;</li>
<li>They replied, &ldquo;It is on your account. Sirs, that we live here,
and it is you whom we regard; if you. Sirs, will lead the holy life
under the great Samana, we all will do the same.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Then Sariputta and Moggallana went to the place where Sanjaya
was; having approached him, they said, &ldquo;Friend, we go to join the
Blessed One; he, the Blessed One, is our teacher.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Sanjaya replied, &ldquo;Nay, friends, do not go; we will all three
look after this company.&rdquo;</li>
<li>And a second and third time Sariputta and Moggallana said
this. and Sanjaya answered as before.</li>
<li>Then Sariputta and Moggallana took with them two hundred and
fifty wandering ascetics and went to the Veluvana in Rajagraha, where
the Blessed One was staying.</li>
<li>And the Blessed One saw them&ndash;Sariputta and Moggallana, coming
from afar; on seeing them he thus addressed the monks: &ldquo;There, monks,
arrive two companions,&rdquo; pointing towards Sariputta and Moggallana;
&ldquo;these will be my chief pair of disciples, and [an] auspicious
pair.&rdquo;</li>
<li>When they had arrived at the bamboo grove, they went to the
place where the Blessed One was; having approached him, they
prostrated themselves, with their heads at the feet of the Blessed
One, and said to the Blessed One, &ldquo;Lord, let us receive ordination
from the Blessed One.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The Blessed One then uttered the usual formula indicating
admission, &ldquo;Ehi Bhikku&rdquo; (Come, Monks), and Sariputta and Moggallana
and the two hundred Jatilas became the disciples of the Buddha.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 4. Conversion of King Bimbisara</p>
<ol>
<li>Rajagraha was the capital of Seniya Bimbisara, King of
Magadha.</li>
<li>Having heard of the conversions of this large number of
Jatilas, everyone in the city had begun to talk about the Blessed
One.</li>
<li>Thus King Bimbisara came to know of his arrival in the city.</li>
<li>&ldquo;To have converted the most orthodox and the most obstinate
Jatilas was no mean task.&rdquo; &ldquo;Truly so,&rdquo; said King Bimbisara to himself,
&ldquo;he must be the Blessed, holy, absolute Buddha, proficient in
knowledge and conduct, the way-farer, who understands the world, the
highest one who guides men, the teacher of gods and men. He must be
teaching the truth, which he understood himself.</li>
<li>&ldquo;He must be preaching that Dhamma which is lovely in the
beginning, lovely in the middle, lovely at the end, in the spirit and
in the letter; he must be proclaiming the consummate perfect, pure,
and holy life. It is good to obtain the sight of a man like him.&rdquo;</li>
<li>So King Bimbisara, surrounded by twelve myriads of Magadha
Brahmins and householders, went to the place where the Blessed One
was. Having approached him and respectfully saluted the Blessed One,
he sat down near him. And of those twelve myriads of Magadha Brahmins
and householders, some also respectfully saluted the Blessed One and
sat down near him; some exchanged greetings with the Blessed One, and
having done so they sat down near him with complaisant words; some
bent their clasped hands towards the Blessed One and sat down near
him; some made known their name and family name before the Blessed One
and sat down near him; some sat down near him silently.</li>
<li>Now those twelve myriads of Magadha Brahmins and householders
saw Uruvella Kassyapa among the monks who came with the Blessed Lord.
They thought, &ldquo;How now is this? Does the great Samana follow the holy
life under Uruvella Kassyapa, or does Uruvella Kassyapa follow the
holy life under the great Samana?&rdquo;</li>
<li>And the Blessed One, who understood in his mind the reflection
which had arisen in the minds of those twelve myriads of Magadha
Brahmins and householders, addressed the venerable Uruvella Kassyapa,
&ldquo;What has thou seen, O dweller of Uruvella, that thou who art called
the great one has forsaken the fire worship? How is it thou has
forsaken the fire sacrifice?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Kassyapa replied, &ldquo;It is sights and sounds, and also tastes,
and women of sense-desire that the sacrifices promise; [it was]
because I understood that these things are impure that I took no more
delight in sacrifices and offerings.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;But if you don&rsquo;t mind, tell us what made you think so.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Then the venerable Uruvella Kassyapa rose from his seat,
adjusted his upper robe so as to cover one shoulder, prostrated
himself, inclining his head to the feet of the Blessed One, and said
to the Blessed One, &ldquo;My teacher is the Blessed One, I. am his pupil.&rdquo;
Then those twelve myriads of Magadha Brahmins and householders
understood, &ldquo;Uruvella Kassyapa follows the holy life under the great
Samana.&rdquo;</li>
<li>And the Blessed One, who understood in his mind &rsquo;the
reflection that had arisen in the minds of those twelve myriads of
Magadha Brahmins and householders, preached to them his Dhamma. Just
as a clean cloth free from black specks properly takes the dye, thus
eleven myriads of those Magadha Brahmins and householders with
Bimbisara at their head, while sitting there, obtained the pure and
spotless dye of the Dhamma. One myriad announced their having become
lay followers.</li>
<li>Then the Magadha king, Seniya Bimbisara, having witnessed the
scene, having understood the Dhamma, having penetrated the Dhamma,
having overcome uncertainty, having dispelled all doubts, having
gained full knowledge, said to the Blessed One, &ldquo;In former days, Lord,
when I was a prince, I entertained five aspirations; these are now
fulfilled.</li>
<li>&ldquo;In former days. Lord, to me when I was a prince, came this
thought: &lsquo;O that I might be inaugurated king!&rsquo; That was my first
aspiration, Lord; that is now fulfilled. &lsquo;And might then a holy one, a
fully Enlightened One, come over into my kingdom!&rsquo; This was my second
aspiration, Lord; that is now fulfilled. &lsquo;And might I minister to that
Blessed One!&rsquo; That was my third aspiration. Lord; that is now
fulfilled.&rsquo; And might he, the Blessed One, preach the Dhamma to me!&rsquo;
This was my fourth aspiration, Lord ; and that is now fulfilled. &lsquo;And
might I understand the Dhamma of that Blessed One!&rsquo; This was my fifth
aspiration, Lord; this is now fulfilled. These were my five
aspirations, Lord, which I entertained in former days when I was a
prince.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Wonderful, Lord! Wonderful, just as if one should set up what
had been overturned, or should reveal what had been hidden, or should
point out the way to one who had lost his way, or should bring a lamp
into the darkness, in order that those who had eyes might see things;
thus has the Blessed One preached the Dhamma in many ways. I take
refuge, Lord, in that Blessed One, and in the Dhamma, and in the
fraternity of Bhikkus (monks). May the Blessed One receive me from
this day forth, while my life lasts, as a lay disciple who has taken
refuge in him.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 5. Conversion of Anathapindika</p>
<ol>
<li>Sudatta was a resident of Shravasti, the capital of the kingdom
of Kosala. It was ruled by King Pasenjit. Sudatta was treasurer of the
king. From his bounties to the poor, Sudatta was known as
Anathapindika.</li>
<li>When the Lord was at Rajagraha, Anathapindika happened to visit
the place on some private business of his own. He was stopping with
his sister, who was married to the guild master of Rajagraha.</li>
<li>When he arrived he found the guild master preparing a meal for
the Lord and his monks, on so great a scale that he thought that a
wedding was in progress or that the king had been invited.</li>
<li>On learning the truth, he became very eager to visit the Lord,
and he set out in the very night to meet the Blessed One.</li>
<li>And the Blessed One saw at once the sterling quality of
Anathapindika&rsquo;s heart, and greeted him with words of comfort. After
taking his seat, Anathapindika expressed a desire to hear a discourse
on some religious subject.</li>
<li>The Blessed Lord, responding to his wishes ,raised the
question, &ldquo;Who is it that shapes our lives? Is it Ishavara, a personal
creator? If Ishavara be the maker, all living things should have
silently to submit to their maker&rsquo;s power. They would be like vessels
formed by the potter&rsquo;s hand. If the world had been made by Ishavara,
there should be no such thing as sorrow, or calamity, or sin; for both
pure and impure deeds must come from him. If not, there would be
another cause beside him, and he would not be the self-existent one.
Thus, you see, the thought of Ishavara is overthrown.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Again, it is said that the Absolute cannot be a cause. All
things around us come from a cause, as the plant comes from the seed;
how can the Absolute be the cause of all things alike? If it pervades
them, then certainly it does not make them.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Again, it is said that self is the maker. But if self is the
maker, why did he not make things pleasing? The cases of sorrow and
joy are real and objective. How can they have been made by self?</li>
<li>&ldquo;Again, if you adopt the argument [that] there is no maker,
or fate in [=is] such as it is, and there is no causation, what use
would there be in shaping our lives, and adjusting means to an end?</li>
<li>&ldquo;Therefore, we argue that all things that exist are not
without cause. However, neither Ishavara, nor the Absolute, nor the
self, nor causeless chance, is the maker, but our deeds produce
results both good and evil.</li>
<li>&ldquo;The whole world is under the law of causation, and the causes
that act are not un-mental, for the gold of which the cup is made is
gold throughout.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Let us, then, surrender the heresies of worshipping Ishavara
and praying to him; let us not lose ourselves in vain speculations of
profitless subtleties; let us surrender self and all selfishness; and
as all things are fixed by causation, let us practise good so that
good may result from our actions.&rdquo;</li>
<li>And Anathapindika said, &ldquo;I see the truth of what the Blessed
One has said, and I wish to open my whole mind. Having listened to my
words, let the Lord advise me what I should do.</li>
<li>&ldquo;My life is full of work; and having acquired great wealth, I
am surrounded with cares. Yet do I enjoy my work, and I apply myself
to it with all diligence. Many people are in my employ, and depend
upon the success of my enterprises.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Now, I have heard your disciples praise the bliss of the
hermit and denounce the unrest of the world. &lsquo;The Blessed One,&rsquo; they
say, &lsquo;has given up his kingdom and his inheritance, and has found the
path of righteousness, thus setting an example to all the world how to
attain Nirvana.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;My heart yearns to do what is right, and to be a blessing
unto my fellow-beings. Let me then ask you, must I give up my wealth,
my home, and my business enterprises, and, like you, go into
homelessness, in order to attain the bliss of a religious life?&rdquo;</li>
<li>And the Blessed Lord replied, &ldquo;The bliss of a religious life
is attainable by everyone who walks in the noble eight-fold path. He
that cleaves to wealth, had better cast it away than allow his heart
to be poisoned by it; but he who does not cleave to wealth, and,
possessing riches, uses them rightly, will be a blessing unto his
fellow-beings.</li>
<li>&ldquo;I say unto thee, remain in thy station of life, and apply
thyself with diligence to thy enterprises. It is not life and wealth
and power that enslave men, but the cleaving to life and wealth and
power.</li>
<li>&ldquo;The Bhikku who retires from the world in order to lead a life
of leisure will have no gain. For a life of indolence is an
abomination, and lack of energy is to be despised.</li>
<li>&ldquo;The Dhamma of the Tathagata does not require a man to go into
homelessness or to resign the world, unless he feels called upon to do
so; what the Dhamma of the Tathagata requires is for every man to free
himself from the illusion of self, to cleanse his heart, to give up
his thirst for pleasure, and lead a life of righteousness.</li>
<li>&ldquo;And whatever men do, whether they remain in the world as
artisans, merchants, and officers of the king, or retire from the
world and devote themselves to a life of religious meditation, let
them put their whole heart into their task; let them be diligent and
energetic; and, if they are like the lotus, which, though it grows in
the water, yet remains untouched by the water, if they struggle in
life without cherishing envy or hatred, if they live in the world a
life not of self but a life of truth, then surely joy, peace, and
bliss will dwell in their minds.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Anathapindika perceived that this was the most excellent
system of truth, simple and of wisdom born.</li>
<li>Thus firmly settled in the true doctrine, he slowly bent in
worship at the feet of the Blessed One, and with closed hands made his
request.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 6. Conversion of King Pasenjit</p>
<ol>
<li>Then King Pasenjit, hearing that the Lord had come, went in his
royal equipage to the Jetavana Vihara. Saluting him with clasped
hands, he said:</li>
<li>&ldquo;Blessed is my unworthy and obscure kingdom, that it has met
with so great a fortune. For how can calamities and dangers befall it
in the presence of Lord of the World, the Dharma Raja, the King of
Truth?</li>
<li>&ldquo;Now that I have seen your sacred features, let me partake of
the refreshing waters of your teachings.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Worldly profit is fleeting and perishable, but religious
profit is eternal and inexhaustible. A worldly man, though a king, is
full of trouble, but even a common man who is holy has peace of
mind.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Knowing the tendency of the king&rsquo;s heart, weighed down by
avarice and love of pleasure, the Blessed One seized the opportunity
and said:</li>
<li>&ldquo;Even those who, have been born in low degree, when they see a
virtuous man feel reverence for him, how much more must an independent
king, who by his previous conditions of life has acquired much merit,
feel?</li>
<li>&ldquo;And now as I briefly expound the law, let the Maharaja listen
and weigh my words, and hold fast to what I say.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Our good or evil deeds follow us continually like shadows.</li>
<li>&ldquo;That which is most needed is a loving heart!</li>
<li>&ldquo;Regard your people as we do an only son. Do not oppress them,
do not destroy them; keep in due check every member of your body,
forsake unrighteous doctrines, and walk in the straight path; do not
exalt yourself by trampling down others. Give comfort and befriend the
sufferer.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Neither ponder much on kingly dignity, nor listen to the
smooth words of flatterers.</li>
<li>&ldquo;There is no profit in vexing oneself by austerities, but
meditate on Dhamma and weigh the righteous law.</li>
<li>&ldquo;We are enclosed on all sides by the rocks of sorrow and ill,
and only by considering the true law can we escape from this
sorrow-filled mountain.<br>
14, &ldquo;What profit, then, in practising inequity?</li>
<li>&ldquo;All who are wise spurn the pleasures of the body. They loathe
lust and seek to promote their spiritual existence.</li>
<li>&ldquo;When a tree is burning with fierce flames, how can the birds
congregate therein? Truth cannot dwell where passion lives. Without a
knowledge of this, the learned man, though he may be praised as a
sage, is ignorant.</li>
<li>&ldquo;On him who has this knowledge true wisdom dawns. To acquire
this wisdom is the one aim needed. To neglect it implies the failure
of life.</li>
<li>&ldquo;The teachings of all schools should centre here, for without
it there is no reason.</li>
<li>&ldquo;This truth is not for the hermit alon ; it concerns every
human being, priest and layman alike. There is no distinction between
the monk who has taken the vows, and the man of the world living with
his family. There are hermits who fall into perdition, and there are
humble householders who mount to the rank of rishis.</li>
<li>&ldquo;The tide of lust is a danger common to all; it carries away
the world. He who is involved in its eddies finds no escape. But
wisdom is the handy boat, reflection is the rudder. The slogan of
religion calls you to the rescue of your self from the assaults of
Mara, the enemy.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Since it is impossible to escape the result of our deeds, let
us practise good works.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Let us inspect our thoughts [so] that we do no evil, for as
we sow so shall we reap.</li>
<li>&ldquo;There are ways from light into darkness, and from darkness
into light. There are ways, also, from gloom into deeper darkness, and
from the dawn into brighter light. The wise man will use the light as
he has to receive more light. He will constantly advance to the
knowledge of the truth.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Exhibit true superiority by virtuous conduct and the exercise
of reason; meditate deeply on the vanity of earthly things, and
understand the fickleness of life.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Elevate the mind, and seek sincere faith with firm purpose;
transgress not the rules of kingly conduct, and let your happiness
depend not upon external things, but upon your own mind. Thus you will
lay up a good name for distant ages.</li>
<li>The king listened with reverence, and remembered all the words
of the Blessed One in his heart, and promised to become his lay
disciple.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 7. Conversion of Jeevaka</p>
<ol>
<li>Jeevaka was the son of Salvati, a courtesan of Rajagraha.</li>
<li>Immediately after birth the child, being illegitimate, was
placed in a basket and thrown on a dust-heap.</li>
<li>A large number of people were standing by the dust-heap
watching the child. Abhaya, the Raja-kumara, happened to pass by the
site. He questioned the people, who said, &ldquo;It is alive.&rdquo;</li>
<li>For this reason the child was called Jeevaka. Abhaya adopted
him and brought him up.</li>
<li>When Jeevaka grew in age, he learned how he was saved, and was
charged with the intense desire to qualify himself to save others.</li>
<li>He therefore went to the University of Takashila without the
knowledge and permission of Abhaya, and studied medicine for seven
years.</li>
<li>Returning to Rajagraha, he set up his practice as a doctor, and
within a very short time acquired a great name and fame in the
profession.</li>
<li>His first patient was the wife of a sethi of Saketa, and for
curing her he received sixteen thousand kahapanas, a man-servant, a
maid-servant, and a coach with a horse.</li>
<li>Knowing his eminence, Abhaya gave him residence in his own
establishment.</li>
<li>At Rajagraha he cured Bimbisara of a troublesome fistula, and
is said to have received as reward all the ornaments of Bimbisara&rsquo;s
five hundred wives.</li>
<li>Other noteworthy cures of Jeevaka included that of the sethi
of Rajagraha, on whom he performed the operation of trepanning; and of
the son of the sethi of Benares, who was suffering from chronic
intestinal trouble due to misplacement.</li>
<li>Jeevaka was appointed physician to the king and the king&rsquo;s
women.</li>
<li>But Jeevaka was greatly attached to the Blessed Lord.
Consequently he also acted as a physician to him and the Sangh.</li>
<li>He became a disciple of the Lord. The Blessed Lord did not
make him a Bhikku, as he wanted him to remain free to tend to the sick
and the wounded.</li>
<li>When Bimbisara died, Jeevaka continued to serve his son
Ajatsatru, and was mainly instrumental in bringing him to the Lord
after his crime of parricide.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 8. The Conversion of Ratthapala</p>
<ol>
<li>Once when the Lord was on an alms pilgrimage in the Kuru
country with a great company of almsmen, he stayed at Thullakotthita,
which was a township of the Kurus.</li>
<li>They came to know of it, and went to him to pay their
respects.</li>
<li>When they were seated, the Lord instructed them with a
discourse on the Doctrine. Having received their instruction from the
Lord, the Brahmin heads of houses of Thullakotthita gratefully thanked
him, rose up, and departed with deep obeisance.</li>
<li>Seated among them was a young man named Ratthapala, a scion of
a leading family of the place, to whom this thought came, &ldquo;So far as I
understand the Doctrine which the Lord has preached, [it] is no easy
matter for one who lives in a home to lead the higher life in all its
fullness, purity, and perfection.</li>
<li>&ldquo;What if I were to cut off hair and beard, don the yellow
robes, and go forth from home to homelessness as a pilgrim!&rdquo;</li>
<li>When the Brahmins had not been gone long, then Ratthapala came
up and, after salutations, told the Lord the thought which had come to
him, and asked to be admitted to, and confirmed in, the confraternity
under him.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Have you your parents&rsquo; consent to this step, Ratthapala?&rsquo;
asked the Lord.</li>
<li>&ldquo;No, Sir.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;I do not admit those who have not their parents&rsquo; consent.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;That consent. Sir, I will take steps to obtain,&rdquo; said the
young man; who, rising up and taking a reverential leave of the Lord,
went off to his parents, told them his thoughts, and asked their
consent to his becoming a Bhikku.</li>
<li>The parents made answer as follows, &ldquo;Dear Ratthapala, you are
our only son, very dear to us and beloved; you live in comfort and
have been brought up in comfort, with no experience at all of
discomfort. Go away; eat, drink, enjoy yourself, and do good works in
all happiness. We refuse our consent.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Your death would leave us desolate, with no pleasure left in
life; why, while we have you still, should we consent to your going
forth from home to homelessness as a Bhikku?&rdquo;</li>
<li>A second and yet a third time did Ratthapala repeat his
request, only to be met by the same refusal from his parents.</li>
<li>Failing thus to get his parents&rsquo; consent, the young man flung
himself down on the bare ground, declaring that he would either die
there or become a Bhikku.</li>
<li>His parents entreated him to get up, while repeating their
objections to his becoming a Bhikku, but the young man said not a
word. A second and a third time they entreated him, but still he said
not a word.</li>
<li>So the parents sought out Ratthapala&rsquo;s companions, to whom
they told all this and besought them to urge, as from themselves, what
his parents had said to him.</li>
<li>Thrice his companions appealed to him, but still he said not a
word. So his companions came to the parents with this report, &ldquo;There
on the bare ground he lies, declaring that he will either die there or
become a Bhikku. If you refuse your consent, he will never get up
alive. But if you give your consent, you will see him when he has
become a Bhikku. Should he not like being a Bhikku, what alternative
will he have! Why, only to come back here. Do give your consent!&rdquo; they
urged.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Yes, we consent; but when he is a Bhikku, he must come and
see us.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Off now went his companions to Ratthapala, and they told him
that his parents had given their consent, but that when he was a
Bhikku he was to come and see them.</li>
<li>Thereupon the young man arose and, when he had regained his
strength, betook himself to the Lord, and after salutations, seated
himself on one side, saying, &ldquo;I have got my parents&rsquo; consent to my
becoming a Bhikku; I ask the Lord to admit me.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Admission and confirmation were granted him under the Lord;
and a fortnight afterwards the Lord, having stayed at Thullakotthita
as long as he wanted, proceeded on his alms pilgrimage towards
Sravasti, where he took up his abode in Jeta&rsquo;s grove in
Anathapindika&rsquo;s pleasance.</li>
<li>Dwelling alone and aloof, strenuous, ardent ,and purged of
self, the reverend Ratthapala was not [there] long before he won the
prize in quest of which young men go forth from home to homelessness
as Bhikkus, that prize of prizes which crowns the highest life.</li>
<li>Then he went to the Lord and, seated on one side after
salutations, said that with the Lord&rsquo;s permission, he wished to go and
see his parents.</li>
<li>Scanning with his own heart the thoughts of Ratthapala&rsquo;s
heart, and recognizing thereby that he was incapable of abandoning his
training and reverting to the lower life of a layman, the Lord bade
him go when he would.</li>
<li>Hereupon, rising up and taking his leave of the Lord with deep
reverence, Ratthapala, after duly putting away his bedding, set out,
with his robe and bowl, on an alms pilgrimage to Thullakotthita, where
he took up his abode in the deer-park of the Kuru king.</li>
<li>Early next morning, duly robed and bowl in hand, he went into
the town for alms, and there as he passed from house to house on his
undiscriminating round, he came to his father&rsquo;s house.</li>
<li>Indoors, in the hall within the middle door, his father was
having his hair combed and, seeing Ratthapala coming in the distance,
he said, &ldquo;It was these shavelings of recluses who made Bhikku of my
only dear and beloved son.&rdquo;</li>
<li>So at his own father&rsquo;s house Ratthapala was given nothing, not
even a refusal; all he got was abuse.</li>
<li>At this moment a slave-girl of the family was about to throw
away the previous day&rsquo;s stale rice; and to her Ratthapala said, &ldquo;If,
sister, that is to be thrown away, put it in my bowl here.&rdquo;</li>
<li>As the girl was doing so, she recognised his hands and feet
and voice, and going straight to her mistress, cried out, &ldquo;Do you
know, madam, the young master is back.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;If what you say is true, you are a slave no longer,&rdquo; said the
mother, who hurried off to tell her husband that she heard their son
was back.</li>
<li>Ratthapala was eating that stale rice under the hedge when his
father arrived, exclaiming; &ldquo;Can it be, my dear son, that you are
eating stale rice? Should you not have come to your own house?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Said Ratthapala, &ldquo;What house of our own, householder, can we
have who are homeless, having gone forth from home to homelessness? I
did come to your house, where I was given nothing, not even a refusal;
all I got was abuse.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Come, my son; let us go indoors.&rdquo; &ldquo;Not so, householder; I
have finished my eating for today&rdquo; said Ratthapala.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Well then, my son, promise to take your meal here
tomorrow.&rdquo;</li>
<li>By his silence the reverend Ratthapala gave consent.</li>
<li>Then the father went indoors,&ndash;where first he ordered great
heaps of gold and bullion to be piled up under a covering of mats, and
then he told his daughters-in-law, who had been the reverend
Ratthapala&rsquo;s wives aforetime, to deck themselves out in all the finery
their husband liked to see them in.</li>
<li>When night had passed, the father, having ordered an excellent
meal to be got ready in his house, told his son when it was ready.
Early that forenoon, the reverend Ratthapala, duly robed and bowl in
hand, came and took the seat set for him.</li>
<li>Hereupon, ordering the heap of treasure to be unveiled, the
father said, &ldquo;This is your mother&rsquo;s fortune, that is your father&rsquo;s,
and that came from your grand-father. You have the wherewithal both to
enjoy yourself and to do good works.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Come, my son, abandon your training; revert to the lower life
of the layman; enjoy your substance and do good works.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;If you will take my advice, householder, you will cart away
all this heaped-up treasure and sink it in the middle of the Ganges.
And why? Because thence you will only derive sorrow and lamentation,
ills, pain of mind, pain of body, and tribulation.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Clinging to his feet, the reverend Ratthapala&rsquo;s whilom
[=former] wives asked, like what were the nymphs divine for whose
sake he was leading the higher life?</li>
<li>&ldquo;For the sake of no nymphs at all, sisters,&rdquo; said he.</li>
<li>At hearing themselves called sisters, the ladies all fainted
and fell to the ground.</li>
<li>Said Ratthapala to his father, &ldquo;If food is to be given,
householder, give it; trouble me not.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The food is ready, my son; begin,&rdquo; said the father, as he
served that excellent meal without stint till his son had his fill.</li>
<li>After taking food he departed to the deer-park of the Kuru
king, where he sat down under a tree during the noontide heat.</li>
<li>Now the king had given directions to his huntsman to tidy up
the park against his coming to see it; and the obedient huntsman was
engaged on his task when he saw Ratthapala seated under a tree during
the noontide heat, and reported to the king that the park was in.
order but that under a tree there was seated Ratthapala, the young
gentleman of whom His Majesty had often heard tell.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Never mind about the park today,&rdquo; said the king; &ldquo;I will pay
a call on His Reverence.&rdquo; Ordering, therefore, all the repast which
had been prepared to be made ready, he mounted a chariot and drove
forth in procession, in royal state, out of the city to see
Ratthapala.</li>
<li>Riding as far as the ground was passable for his chariot, and
proceeding thence on foot with his princely train, the king came at
last upon the reverend Ratthapala, whom, after exchange of courteous
greetings, the king&ndash;still standing&ndash;invited to be seated on a clump
of flowers.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Nay, sire; sit you there, I have got a seat.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Seating himself on the seat indicated to him, the king said,
&ldquo;There are four kinds of losses, Ratthapala, which impel men to cut
off hair and beard, don the yellow robes, and go forth from home to
homelessness&ndash;namely, (i) old age, (ii) failing health, (iii)
impoverishment, and (iv) death of kinsfolk.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Take a man who, being aged and old, far advanced in life,
stricken in years, and at the close of life, recognises his position,
and realises the difficulty either of acquiring new wealth or of doing
well with what he has got; so he decides to take to homelessness. This
is known as the loss which old age entails. But here are you in the
prime of youth and early manhood, with a wealth of coal-black hair
untouched by grey, and in all the beauty of your prime;&ndash;not yours is
the loss old age entails. What have you known or seen or heard, to
make you take to homelessness?</li>
<li>&ldquo;Or take a man who, being in ill-health or pain, or gravely
ill, recognises his position and realises the difficulty either of
acquiring new wealth or doing well with what he has already; so he
decides to take to homelessness. This is known as the loss which
failing health entails. But here are you neither ill nor ailing, with
a good digestion maintained by humours neither too hot nor too cold;
not yours is the loss which failing health entails. What have you
known or seen or heard, to make you take to homelessness ?</li>
<li>&ldquo;Or take a man who, after being rich and wealthy and of great
substance, and after gradually losing it, recognises his, position and
realises the difficulty either of acquiring new wealth or of doing
well with what he has got; so he decides to become a pilgrim. This is
known as the loss which impoverishment entails. But the revered
Ratthapala is the son of [a] leading family in this very
Thullakotthita, and there is none of this loss of wealth for the
revered Ratthapala. What has the good Ratthapala known or seen or
heard, that he has gone forth from home into homelessness?<br>
And what, good Ratthapala, is loss of relations? As to this, good
Ratthapala, someone has many friends and acquaintances, kith and kin,
but gradually these relations of his diminish. He reflects thus,
&lsquo;Formerly I had many friends and acquaintances, kith and kin, but
gradually these relations of mine have diminished, so it is not easy
for me to acquire wealth etc&hellip;.&rsquo; So he that is followed by this loss
of relations, having cut off hair and beard, having donned saffron
garments, goes forth from home into homelessness. This is known as the
loss which kinsfolk&rsquo;s death entails. But here are you with a host of
friends and relations; not yours is the loss which kinsfolk&rsquo;s death
entails. What have you known or seen or heard, to make you take to
homelessness?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;I have gone forth,&rdquo; replied Ratthapala, &ldquo;sire, from home to
homelessness because I have known, seen, and heard the following four
propositions enunciated by the All-Enlightened Lord who knows and
sees:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>(i) The world is in continual flux and change.<br>
(ii) The world has no protector or preserver.<br>
(iii) We own nothing; we must leave everything behind.<br>
(iv) The world lacks and hankers, being enslaved to craving.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<ol start="57">
<li>&ldquo;It is wonderful, it is marvellous,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;how right
in this the Lord was!&rdquo;</li>
</ol></blockquote>
