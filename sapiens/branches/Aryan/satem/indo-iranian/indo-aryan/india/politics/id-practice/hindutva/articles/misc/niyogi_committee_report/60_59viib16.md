*Statement made before the Christian Missionary Activities Enquiries
Committee*

NAGPUR

(20-9-1955)

**No. 1**

*Name*-Dr. D. G. Moses.  
*Father’s name*-Drevium Moses.  
*Occupation*-Principal, Hislop College.  
*Address*-Nagpur.-

I am Principal of the Hislop College from 1941. I am connected with the
Institution from 1926 as Professor of Philosophy.  The Hislop College
was formerly founded by the Church of Scotland and is at present managed
by a Board of Directors with headquarters constituted in Madhya
Pradesh.  It provides graduate and post-graduate education in Arts and
Science subjects and is not directly connected with Church.  Amongst
Directors there are three members who are representing Mid India
Christian Council.  At present there are about 1,100 students on the
roll including women students.  There are about 100 Christian students
now and the rest are non-Christians.  The Institution receives a block
grant of Rs. 10,000 annually from the Church of Scotland; the other
expenses are met out of fees and grant-in-aid from Government.  On
behalf of the Church of Scotland a Missionary Professor Miss Ward has
been appointed Lecturer in English.  We have an American Negro who is in
charge of Physical education and another American who is teaching
sociology.  They are paid by the American Methodist Mission.

The North India United Church of Nagpur carries on evangelical and other
activities in Madhya Pradesh.  I am a member thereof.  They run schools,
hospitals and a dispensary at Dhapewada.  For the last four or five
years this institution has got no paid evangelists to my knowledge.  I
and other members of this institution believe in the basic tennets of
Christianity that every Christian is an evangelist a Missionary
Christian.  

My ideas of propagating the Christian religion are as follows:-

> “It consists in telling all and sundry what great things the Lord has
> done to you.  The motive is to express infinite thankfulness to God
> for what he has done.  The idea of converting people to my faith is
> not inherent in the concept of propagating my religion.  In fact I do
> not place any importance on mere numbers although if I come across a
> person who having heard me “bear witness” wishes to join my faith I
> would rejoice.  The Christian wants to exist as a member of the Church
> and not as a Christian community in the political sense.  There can be
> no ulterior motive in propagating the religion.  In course of my
> experience I have come across cases in which genuine believers
> embraced Christianity together with the entire family and also cases
> in which individuals wanted to become converts simply to marry a
> Christian girl.  The possibility of improper motives entering into the
> minds of Christians for converting people merely for the sake of
> numbers is there, as it is present amongst any other section of the
> community.  But this I would not classify as propagation of such
> religion.  If masses are induced to become Christians only to add to
> the numbers for secular objects and on false pretences, that is not
> propagation of religion.”
>
> “If there is a body which declares its intention to convert 600,000
> villages to Christianity with material resources then I would not call
> it as propagation of religion.  If such activities are checked by
> society I would say that the action would be justified as it aims to
> prevent growth of ill-feeling amongst various sections of community.”

*Question*.-If a body declares itself under the label of “aggressive
evangelism” or “evangelical crusade” and uses such means as television,
dramas, radios, mobile projection vans, the media of mass communication,
recording, films, pictures, posters, illustrated leaflets flannel
graphs, puppets, etc., and. works only in ore caste like Uraons, Mahars
or Satnamis will you call it propagation?

*Answer*.-Yes, provided evangelism is understood in the sense explained
by me above.  It would not be propagation if these activities are done
with a view to convert 600,000 villagers in 10 years.

This is too much of a business method.  It is not a spiritual method.

In the year 1910 at Edinburough, World Council, it was recommended to
leave to the Indians the evangelistic activities.  Last year at
Evanstone it was decided that the Christian church is a world church and
it is supra-national Evanstone expects that churches in India would be
“rooted in the soil yet supranational in their witness”.

Supra-national does not mean de-nationalisation but only means that the
State should not interfere with the creed that God is the final
authority.  The Chairman read out “The Christian forces of the world
though still a minority must on that very account quickly become a very
organised and militant minority” (World Christian Handbook, page 57,
1952).  I do not subscribe to this.  In my opinion the Church in India
should be one Church as everywhere and should be entirely under the
control of Indians.  In my view the Church in India must eschew
denominational differences and must become one Church.  I do not agree
with Dr. Pickett if he thinks that a National Church in India would
reflect the spirit of political Nationalism.  But I disagree with Rev.
Anantrao. (See N. C. C., December 1954, page 544).  When he says that
the Christians in India would be unifying if the foreign support is
stopped.

I would like the Christian faith to absorb all the best in Indian
culture and to express itself in Indian ways.

In other words there should be an Indian expression of Christianity.  If
a school or a hospital is used mainly as an instrument for conversion to
Christianity it is not evangelism.  I thoroughly disapprove of primary
schools being started for utilising the fees for maintaining a church. 
I disapprove of the policy of having Christi Raj or Masahi Sthan.  
 

**No. 2**

*Name*-Rev. Canon Kurian.  
*Caste*-Christian.  
*Address*-Nagpur, Cathedral House, Nagpur.

In reply to the questionnaire issued by the Committee I have filed a
statement.  I belong to the Gondwana Mission. I was formerly in Mandla
and have come to Nagpur in January 1955.

There is difference between conversion and proselytization. 
Proselytization means only adding to the numbers.  We have got only one
Pracharak.  The preaching does not mean attacking any other religion or
the persons who are venerated by them.  If somebody were to say that
unless he became a Christian he would go to hell it is not called
propagation.  If the Government is helping the Harijans and aboriginals
I would not call it as an inducement.  It would be good if they were to
extend their help to needy Christians.  We have had no trouble from the
Government officials.

The grants which we used to get from abroad are being gradually
reduced.  This year we only got £ 200 and next year we may get less. 
Religious instruction in schools should be left to individual choice.  
 

**No. 3**

(21-9-1955)

*Name*-Shri Jal Gimi.  
*Occupation*-Document Expert.  
*Address*-Nagpur.

I was a student in the St. Francis de-Sales High School and St. John’s
High School. I joined Morris College afterwards.  Both are Roman
Catholic schools.  Bible history was one of the subjects prescribed for
the junior and senior Cambridge examinations.  That was St. Francis D.
School.  There was also catechism class meant for Roman Catholic boys. 
That used to be the first period of the day.  Non-Catholics were not
obliged to attend the class.  But I used to attend the class at the
instance of my father.  He was a student of St. Xavier’s College,
Bombay.  When I was attending the classes a lot of interest was shown in
me by the Father.  The special interest went to the extent that the
Father said to me that I should attend special instructions on Sunday,
afternoons. I continued attending the “special lectures”, on Sunday,
afternoons with a particular priest.  One afternoon as I entered the
room of the Priest I saw his desk covered with huge thick volumes,
presumably literature concerning Christianity.  No sooner. I stepped in
then the Priest remarked “Jal, your Zoraster had no right to found your
religion”.  However small I was in age, *i.e.* (about 13 or 14 years)
something snapped inside me and I retorted by saying “Father, if my
Zoraster had no right to found my religion, your Christ had no right to
found your religion”. Naturally I was very badly caned.  The caning was
so severe that while in the process I managed to run out of his room
straight home and showed the blue and black marks on my body to my
father.  Next morning my father approached the school authorities and
without going into the demerits of the affair had my name removed from
the school roll.  This was in 1928. I am running 41 now.  I was then
admitted in St. John’s High School, where not a word of Christianity and
its teaching was ever breathed by the priests in the institution.  There
were quite a large number of Catholic boys.  There were no catechism
classes in the school nor was there any Bible class.

In the St. Francis High School we were often told by some priests,
“Boys, non-Catholic souls have no salvation unless they became
Catholics,” because we were not Roman Catholics.

I personally and in fact my whole family have great reverence for Christ
and of my daily prayers is the Lord’s prayer, *i.e.* (our Father).

I might also state their bright side and some of the very good points
that I know concerning these Missionary activities which to my mind
considerably outweigh the little unfortunate experience that I had in my
school days.  The sisters of Charity, as they are called, have been
known by me to do such good work and under circumstances which I feel I
personally would never have the courage to perform.  One such instance
is about a place close to Ahmedabad where I was told the lepers in the
city were ousted from the Municipal area and not cared for either by the
State or the local bodies.  These lepers got together and managed to
have a mud and tatta shelter for themselves and did not dare to leave
the four walls lest they might be punished.  The condition in which they
lived must have been worse than that of animals.  For their bread and
butter they used to hand a basket outside their huts to receive alms. 
This went on for quite some time, till the sisters of Charity heard
about this and went all out to help them, and make them live as human
beings as they do now.  Those inhabitants still maintain their own
religion.  There has been so far no interference with their original
faith.  To the best of my knowledge I saw that institution three years
ago.  On my enquiry I was told that none of the inmates have changed
their religion.  My enquiry was not from the lepers.  It is managed by
the Catholics.

I have never been to Jashpur or any other tribal areas.  My experience
is mostly confined to towns, *i.e.* to urban areas.

There is another instance which has occurred just about a fortnight back
when my own cook lost his wife after child birth.  The 10 day old child
was a problem to the young father and his old mother who was practically
blind and bent double with age.  He comes to me and tells me that his
neighbours in the Dharampeth area have suggested that the child be
placed in the custody of the Sisters of Charity in the local Maria
Immaculate Convent, till such time as the child is able to stand on its
own legs and run.  This man belongs to the scheduled caste and this
reflects very creditably on the Missionaries that a Hindu should
voluntarily take his own child for safe custody to people belonging to
different faith altogether.  In fact what struck me then was, why, have
not people in his own community, *viz.*, the Hindus have a home for such
cases.  I mean I have known of a very good institution here called the
Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh which is doing lot of good work in the
country but unfortunately is paying very little attention to the social
uplift and religious teachings amongst the lower strata of society.  If
they take up such work I am positive that the Missionaries will find
anything hard to do in this country.

*To Mr. Tiwari o Mungeli.-* I have never attended any Protestant
institution for school or college, so I do not know whether boys or
students are told by the Priest concerned that their only salvation is
in being Christians.  I have attended church services in the Methodist
Church in Nagpur twice or thrice.  I was the only non-Christian there. I
went there with Christian friends.  After 1947 I have heard that people
were converted by inducement but I have no personal knowledge of any
instance. I heard this in bar-room.  
 

**No. 4**

*Name*.-Dr. E. Asirvatham.  
Age*.-5*8.  
*Occupation*.-Head of the Department of Political Science, University of
Nagpur.

*Chairman*.- When I come across such phrases as “aggressive evangelism”,
“evangelical crusade”, “invasion teams” and such other form suggesting a
drive, it strikes me that it may amount to propaganda.

*Question*.- Can these expressions be described as propaganda?

*Answer*.- Such a process, I shall take with a grain of salt.  In India
I think these are likely to be misunderstood.  As a member of Christian
church I would deprecate the use of such language or do not approve of
such language which is likely to do more harm than good. 600,000
villages mentioned in the address of Alexander Mc.  Liesh of World
Dominion Press may mean only that they went to convert the whole of
India.

Since the termination of the war a great number of narrow-minded,
bigotted and outlandish Missionaries have come out to India.  My
suggestion is that a body like the National Christian Council should be
asked to screen the Missionaries coming to India.

As I do not know the facts relating to Indonesia, Karens in Burma and. 
Nagas in Assam I cannot say anything.  My feeling is that if there is
any trouble like this, these people will go revolting as Nagas, Karens
but not as Christians.  If it is proved in a Judicial manner with due
process of law that it is exciting disaffection than legal steps should
be taken, preventive measures may be taken.

I know the World Council of Churches and International Missionary
Council.

*Question*.- I just read out and I want an interpretation of the
following expression:-

> “The need of particular churches to be rooted in the soil and yet
> being supranational in their witness and obedience.” Does this apply
> to the Church of England?

*Answer*.- Supranational does not mean anti-national or denational, I
mean by obedience, obedience to God and not to Church.

*Question*.- Could you kindly explain the meaning of the passage, “the
Christian forces of the world though in a minority should become a
militant minority”

It only means to roll up your sleaves and be ready.

*Question*.- Will you kindly interpret for me this expression “But when
there is a conflict of loyalty between Christ and the State, the true
Christian has necessarily to choose obedience to Christ (National
Christian Council Review, April 1955).  Would the word Christ include
within the ambit of its meaning “the Worldwide Organisation of the
Christian Church” (World Handbook, 1952, page 58).

*Answer*.- I cannot say yes or no.

I want a Church a free church in India without any authority from
outside India.  In my life-time I would like to see a genuine indigenous
church which I hope will have the uniqueness of our national character. 
It will be loyal to every culture. I would like to incorporate the best
in the spiritual and moral experience, i.e., of cultures of all lands.

I am in favour of Church unity, but I see many difficulties in the way.

The Union of Dr. Pickett as extracted at page 544 of December National
Christian council Review, 1954, was read out.

I say that there can be no true and lasting Internationalism which is
not rooted in sound nationalism.

Foreign help has stood in the way of church of India reaching Indian
manhood.  Even if Indians are unified and become independent of foreign
churches, it can receive foreign aid, I have no objection to receive
money from Foreign Boards because no strings are attached.

If there is a United church in India there is no fear of its being
utilised by any foreign power.  If it is organised on a democratic
method there will be no fear.

I disapprove of what is said in Missions in Mid-India as translated into
Hindi, viz., that Police officers, forest officers and teachers should
be utilised for converting non-Christians to Christianity and that the
responsibility of proselytisation should be put on their shoulders.  Any
person whether he be a Christian or a non-Christian who uses his
official position to give direct or indirect support to any religion is
not true to the purpose and spirit of religion.

I am not in favour if hospitals are used for proselytising people.

*To Shri S. K. Deshpande-*

If mass conversion means converting of a large mass of people without
any adequate preparation and the using of illegitimate methods I am not
for it.

Will you like to have the propaganda of the type that unless you resort
to Bible there is no salvation? My answer is: If a person says that
Bible contains the word of God and solves ones moral and spiritual
problem, as well as problems of the world I am in favour of it.  The
Bible is not the only source, although as a Christian I believe to be
so.

**No. 5**

*Name*.-Shri B. E. Mandlekar.  
*Age*.-59.  
*Occupation*.-Advocate, Supreme Court.  
*Address*.-Nagpur.

I am submitting the copy of my book, “Musings”, wherein I have studied
the relevant questions which are being considered by the Committee.  The
special pages to which I wish to draw the attention of the Committee
are:-

> \(1\) Pages 66 to 68.-A letter to Dr. Cholkar (Prohibition of Cow
> Slaughter).  
> (2) Pages 194 and 107.-Intended legislation regarding “Place of
> Religion in the National Scheme of Education”.  
> (3) Pages 111 to 117.  
> (4) Pages 297 to 298.-“Hindu New Year’s Day”.

I turn to question No. 11.

In the present infant stage of our Bharat it is necessary that there
should be no foreign influence in our national life.  In our political
life we do not want any interference either from America or from
Moscow.  In the social life, as well as in economics, we want to develop
our own life.  In my scheme of national evolution I will not exclude any
Indian for his economic, social or philosophic outlook the assistance
which he can take from his brother, I would not exclude also knowledge
received through books from outsiders, but as far as monetary or other
help is concerned, it creates a slavish mentality in the person
receiving, as it is the hand which gives, that controls.  My firm belief
has been, from whatever I have read, that in matters of religious and
philosophic thoughts Bharat has not to look for anybody for any help or
guidance.  It is being abundantly proved that what was mentioned by
Bharat philosophers is being inductively proved by Western sciences and
applied psychology.  In our infant state, and particularly after the
removal of domination by Muslims and Britishers from India, Bharat has
not yet got full time to remove the rust or the ashes of embers of
philosophic knowledge in books of Hindu philosophy from embers and
experience of Bharat’s great swears.  To illustrate: If Swami
Vivekananda’s teachings are carried to every home in India, I am
perfectly sure that no one would look or listen to foreign propagandists
in religion preaching contrary to Hindu religion.

2\. I would like to learn the principles of Christian religion from a
Christian Indian, but not from any foreigner, particularly if he
supplies money to Indians-institutions for the teachings of Christian
religion.  Because of their Indian background Indian Christians would be
able to explain more correctly than a foreigner.

When the foreign Missionary goes to the aboriginals or to the
untouchables of the Hindus be wants to exploit their ignorance and
economic difficulties.  If a foreigner goes to this area to start a
school or to open a hospital I would suspect his motive because be would
be doing so with the support of foreign funds; because the foreign funds
may be received for the purpose of conversion.  That means he should
render help to poor people out of humanitarian motives but not to
convert them, i.e., with ulterior motive. I do not wish that there
should be any increase in the number of converts.

In my experience of elections I found that if I approach a Christian he
could say that he would vote according to the instructions of the
Christian Association.  This means that the individual Christian is
under the influence of some institution.  If such a Christian is not
under any obligation to any foreign body on account of monetary
assistance, then I should say that there is no objection to his voting
for anybody. I regard religion as a mode of social control and therefore
if there is any influence working from outside in the region of religion
I would suspect that some kind of force is working behind it.  What I
fear is that this body will be separated from the bulk of the nation.

Schools and hospitals should not be used for proselytisation,
particularly with the aid of foreign funds.

I hold that conversion to Christianity adversely affects national
loyalty.

If there is a war between a Muslim and a Hindu the Christian will remain
neutral, but if there is a war between Christian and Hindus the
Christians will help Christian.

When the Christians did not press for a separate state for themselves
they did so on the assurance that the Indian Republic is going to be a
member of the Commonwealth.  I am prepared to absorb everything that
Christianity can contribute through Indian Christian channels.  Any
resident of India is a Hindu.

My answer to question No. 95 is to be found on page 113 onwards of the
book “Musings”.

I am in favour of religious teachings in schools and colleges.  Today it
so happens that although the adherents of one religion think that their
religion is universal that claim is not admitted by others.  On account
of this conflict there arises difficulty in teaching religion in
schools.

By religious teaching of Hinduism I mean that a pupil should know
something about Krishna, Ram and other great personalities who are
separated by Hindus.  I would have no objection to teach the life of
Jesus Christ, also his teachings.  If in the class there are Hindus,
Muslims, Parsis, the prayers of the class would be the prayer of the
majority. I think it is quite fair that minorities in India should offer
the Hindu prayers.

I want that there should be text books containing the lives of Jesus,
Zoraster, or Buddha and so on.

I would be in favour of special classes to be held on Sundays for
teaching religion, in the different classes.  If the background of the
religious philosophy is common, then the deity that is worshipped
becomes un important.  The Secular State must legislate for all persons
in India irrespective of their different religion, e.g., on bigamy. 
This is good to all.

I am in favour of the State taking over the Maths with all their
property and utilising it for social and charitable works.

To Shri Tiwari of Mungeli.

I came to know from the Nagpur Christians that an individual Christian
is not free to vote for the man of his choice. I cannot mention names. 
I cannot mention any instance of a person having become a Christian in
my presence.  If a Christian Missionary finds that there are some young
boys without any food or clothes, no borne, etc., and he takes them to
some place of shelter and gives them food, education, etc., it is
objectionable if he does it with the idea of converting them.  I do not
believe that any such boy brought up by Christians will remain a Hindu. 
I admit that there are people who are helpless. I have not seen street
preaching for the last 25 years.  I do not object to medical relief
being given by any Christian provided he does not get money from abroad
and from religious institutions I would welcome any help, from e.g., the
Ford Foundation.  There are many in Hindu society to render help to poor
people.  They are of a religious character.  I know the Christian
doctrine that one must love one’s neighbour and that helpless people
should be helped.  But I do not desire that this sentiment should be
used for converting people.  If a helpless Christian comes to be in
distress I will help him as I would help a Hindu. I would not ask him to
change his religion. I have no objection if a Christian helps a helpless
Hindu.  I maintain that Schools or Colleges in India should not get any
financial help from abroad, particularly from religious institutions. I
do not object to Ramkrishna Mission receiving help from outside. 
Ramkrishna Mission does not convert.  I have stated in my book entitled
“Musings” that I do not belong to any political party. (Page 292).

I have no objection to dine with a Mahar and I have inter-dined with
Mahars.  On account of the present social outlook inter-marriages with
Mahars will not be favoured.  The untouchables (many of them) have
become Christians not by conviction but by helpless conditions. I come
across instances of about 500 untouchables and aboriginals having become
Christians on account of their economic distress.  They are all from
Madhya Pradesh and I came to know through the official records.  Even
before 1947 the untouchables of a level as to enter the temple would
have been allowed to enter the temples. I would not have allowed a man
wearing dirty clothes and if he is a leper, to enter the temple.  Out of
the 500 conversions which I have mentioned there was none literate,
i.e., who have received primary education.  They were either such as
could merely make a signature, but mostly who would give their
thumb-impression.  If there are others who are educated upto
matriculation standard or even graduates, have become Christian, it may
be due to promote his further chances.  Even if a Missionary doctor
serves the lepers for 10 years and then out of the feeling of gratitude
a patient embraces Christianity, it is objectionable.  If an Indian
Christian pastor is converted by an Arya Samajist I have no objection,
if the pastor by conviction comes to believe in Hinduism.  I have no
objection to convert him by conviction.  The population of Hindus in
India may be about 28 crores, and the population of Christians may be
about 80 lacs. I am not able to tell the present population of Madhya
Pradesh.  The population of Madhya Pradesh before the merger was two and
half crores.  The Christians may be about 4 to 6 per cent of the total
population of Madhya Pradesh.

**No. 6**

*Name*.-Rev. John W. Sadiq.  
*Caste*.-Christian.  
*Age*.-45 years.  
*Occupation*.-Secretary, National Christian Council and Priest.  
*Address*.-Nagpur.

I have read your article published in the National Christian Council
Review of January 1930.  There is a word of difference between a man who
respects Christ as a great man and the person who acknowledges Him as
his personal Lord and Saviour.  The latter by joining the church
participates and in some sense carries on the work, which Christ
entrusted to be done.  Even if a man were to venerate Jesus as the
perfect manifestation of God on earth still he would not be a Christian,
if he does not associate himself with other Christians, as a member of
the Church, involving baptism. I differ from Roman Catholics in regard
to church and doctrines.  The Christian doctrine is only an attempt to
interpret the life and the teachings of Jesus.  No one can be a
Christian unless he regards Jesus as his Lord and the only Lord. 
Anybody who is outside the church cannot be called a Christian.  A
Christian is he who believes that the only wav of seeking peace is
through Jesus Christ.

*Question*.- But Jesus himself said not everyone that calleth Me Lord
and Lord will enter into the Kingdom of My Father but he that doeth the
will of My Father which is Heaven. (Mathew, VI 21).

*Answer*.- He was only emphasising there the contradiction between those
only calling Him Lord and Lord and those who did not do the will of the
Lord.  Even among the members of the church there are quite a large
number of people who are not truly Christians.  There can be and may be
people who belong to the church by Baptism, but may not be true
Christians.

In 1910 there was a meeting of the International Missionary Council in
Edinburgh.  The two principal recommendations were that it was the duty
of the Christians to preach the Gospel to the whole world and secondly
it can best be done by co-operation and unity.  It was always understood
that the church was more important than the Missions.  Many Missionary
Societies have merged in the Church.  In 1912-13 the National Missionary
Council of India, Burma and Ceylon, was started to give effect to the
aforesaid principles.  Later on it became National Christian Council in
1923.

In 1928 there was second World Missionary Conference in Jerusalem and
the third in 1938 at Tambaram in Madras.  In Tambaram the emphasis on
the church was greatly stressed.  I will send you a copy of the Tambaram
Conference minutes (abridged report).  There was a Regional Conference
for South East Asia at Bangkok which was a joint effort of the
International Missionary Council and the World Council of Churches.  Dr.
Raja D. Manikam (also Reverend) is the Joint Secretary of the
International Missionary Council and the World Council of Churches
formed in the year 1948.

At the Conference in Bangkok it was decided that Christ sitting on the
right hand of God reigns and the church owes it to the world and
reminding…… etc. \[*Christianity and Asian Revolution* (pages 90-
91)\].  The church is concerned with Social, Economical and Political
problems.  In 1952 at Lucknow there was a meeting of the World Council
of Churches.  This was mainly in preparation for the second World
Council of Churches meeting at Evanston, in 1954.  It concerned itself
with the sphere of the entire life and activities of the church all over
the world.  The International Missionary Council and World Council of
Churches have executive committees to carry on their work.  We do not
approve of mass conversions; even conversion of individuals for
political motives is objectionable.  On this particular point I agree
with Sardar Patel’s words (page 138, *The Whole World is My
Neighbour*).  I do not like the word mass conversion.  There have been
and will be group conversions.  Conversion means to raise their standard
of life as a whole including spiritual.  If groups desire conversion
purely for social and economic aims without regard to their essential
spiritual life it is not to be encouraged.  There is a lot of misery,
sickness and illiteracy among the people.  To take advantage of their
holplessness would be un-Christian, Even if the Bible women preach in.
the halls of the hospitals or for the purpose of evangelization there is
no objection. I wont compel anybody, i.e., any patient.

Proselytising means simply adding numbers to which we are opposed. 
Evangelism is conversion by conviction.  The Christian does not
distinguish between spiritual and secular life.  There can be no divorce
between the two.

If a preacher decries mother man’s religion and makes unfair comparisons
between thou personalities venerated by the different religions it is
not desirable.  If the preaching is that “we are all sinners and that we
as Christians have found forgiveness in Christ, we have a right to
proclaim this, just as anybody has a right to proclaim it if he has
found a similar experience. I do not approve of decrying personalities
who are held in reverence like Ram and Krishna.

*Question*.- Kindly interpret to me, “the need of particular church to
be rooted in the soil, yet supranational in their witness a rid
obedience (page’ 29, *World Christian Handbook*, 1952),

*Answer*.- Here the word obedience to Christ is through the Church and
so Church, is indispensable.

The resolutions passed at the Ecumenical Council are not binding but
they are advisory.  They are entitled to consideration and respect.

The expression “militant minority” occurring on page 57 “World Christian
Handbook, 1952”, is an unfortunate phrase.  It only means energetic
effort.

Karens in Burma, Amboyncse in Indonesia, Uraons and Mundas in Orissa,
Jharkhand in Madhya, Pradesh, etc., have been agitating. I have not
studied these movement. They may be due to political immaturity and
social troubles.

The, idea of the chosen people occurring at page 75 of National
Christian Council Review of February 1954 has no political,
significance.  Supranational is to be understood only in a spiritual
sense.

*Question*.- Will you kindly illustrate the meaning of supranational
regarding the English Church?

*Answer*.- The Church of England is an established Church, but there are
churches in practically every State in the world which together with the
Church of England consider themselves as members, of one Church known as
the Anglican Communion.

*Question*.- Is not the established Church of England the National
Church of England.

*Answer*.- In England itself this does not mean that Church can override
the State.

The nationalism which is referred to (at page 544 National Christian
Council Review of December 1954) as a danger is a possible tendency that
might show itself in a single united Church in India which will concern
itself solely with national affairs and forget that there are
fellow-believers and Churches in other country.

The mention of “a call to evangelise 600,000 villages in India in 10
years” which was issued by the National Missionary Society at Madras
means the preaching of Christianity only.  The purpose was that the
Gospel of Christ was heard by as many people as possible in the whole
country.

*Question*.- Would you like the Mission property to be transferred to
Indian Christians as the church property, as I understand, has already
been done in some cases ?

*Answer*.- That is what we have been urging for the last 15 years.  Most
of the Missions are only eager to transfer their properties in India to
properly constituted trusts but are prevented from doing so because of
the prohibitive cost of both registration and stamp duty.  We mean by
“Indian trust”.  “incorporated in India and free from foreign
Missionaries, i.e., foreign influence and personnel”.  We would suggest
that the Committee should find a practical solution regarding the
transfer of properties.  The National Christian Council is working
towards an arrangement by which the foreign Missionary will come to
India at the invitation of the Church.

*To Mr. Tiwari of Mungeli.-* The money which comes from abroad for
abundant life movement in Bilaspur District is meant to give relief to
the poor, so far as I know.  The work which is carried on by this
movement is for the uplift of the people and has apparently nothing to
do with Communism. I do not think that this programme will involve any
loss to the people or Government. I have no objection to the Ramkrishna
mission preaching to Christian people.  No Christian is under an
obligation to exercise his vote…… under any direction of any church,
i.e., every Christian has the right and freedom to vote according to his
conviction.  The group conversions take place very much on the lines as
for instance recorded about the story of the conversion of the large
number of people on the day of Pentecost.  If I am in-charge of any
religious institution where I have authority to use money for good
causes, if a beggar or a person in need comes to me and I do not have my
own money I shall be justified in using this money to help this man
though I shall not be justified in giving that help on condition that
the needy man accepts the Christian faith.  It is not true that all the
money that comes from abroad is meant for directly evangelistic
purposes.  Whatever money comes from abroad if it is for the good of the
people should be welcome, whether it is received by the Christian
institutions or non-Christian institutions. I will be the first man to
stop that money which comes for the purpose of disrupting the national
life of the country.  To the best of my knowledge no converts have been
made under pressure or by use of force or by undue inducement.  The
control of the affairs of the church must be in the hands of the Indian
churches, but a foreigner if he is a member of that church may be
assigned any responsibility which the church thinks proper.  I do not
personally know about Jharkhand, but judging from experience of other
part of India I would simply say that I do not believe that the
Jharkhand movement has been backed by the church.  If there is an
impression that foreign Missionary instigates the movement, that is a
wrong impression.

*To Shri S. K. Deshpande.-* I do not know enough about the Jharkhand
movement.  Those people who have been returned from the Jharkhand to the
Bihar State Assembly or to Loksabha are not all Christians; in fact the
majority are non-Christians.  Mr. Jaipalsingh is not an actively
associated with the life of any church or even with the interest of the
Christian community I do not know whether or not all the members of the
Adiwasi Mahasabha are Christians.  Any slur cast on any religion will
hurt people belonging to that religion.  In propagating Christianity I
deprecate any decrying or abuse of other religions. I do not mind
healthy criticism of other religions and of social evils. I am hearing
for the first time that marriage is a sacrament for all Hindus.

The attention of the witness was drawn to page 2 of Bulletin No. 28 of
Christian Home.

*Question.-* Do you approve of this attack on the Hindu Community?

*Answer.-* I shall not subscribe to the views.  I certainly do not
approve of the tone of the writing.

*Question.-* Do not the Christians also have the system of marriage
between Christians and Christians?

*Answer.-* Yes, because of the affinity of the religion.

*Question.-* Does the World Council of Churches and National Christian
Council take part in politics?

*Answer.-* If I happen to be a pacifist I may not join either India or
any other country in war.

My loyalty to God takes precedence over my loyalty to any other thing,
including the nation, as I believe that the church is the body of
Christ.  Therefore my loyalty to the church as the body of Christ is
greater, though I do not believe that such conflict is necessary.

Our Anglican church is affiliated to the church of India, Burma and
Ceylon.  Whatever help comes to this C.I.P.B.C. comes from Great
Britain.

2\. *Mr. Jacob.-* The Resolutions passed at the Bangkok Conference are
published, but I do not claim to have read all of them.  I subscribe to
the idea expressed in the Bangkok World Missionary.  Council Conference
reported on page 95 of “Christianity and Asian Revolution”, in the sense
that the Bible is relevant to the conditions that exist in this country,
i.e., in India and other countries of Asia.  By Hindu nationalism I mean
the movement that is contrary-to the ideal of a secular State.

*On the 24th September 1955.-* The Lucknow Conference of December 1952
was organised by the East Asia Secretary of the World Council of
Churches.  It was a study conference in preparation for the second
Assembly of the World Council which was held in Evanston in 1954.

The National Christian Council of India has no relation with the World
Council but they work in association with the International Missionary
Council.  Only six churches in India are members of the World Council
and of those six churches only five churches are members of the National
Christian Council.  The Church of India, Burma, Pakistan and Ceylon, the
United Church of North India, the Church of South India, the Mar Thoma
Syrian Church of Malabar, the Orthodox Syrian Church of Malabar and the
Evangelical Lutheran Federation of India.

Hindu nationalism is not condemned because it is against the tenets of
Christianity but it is due to social ideologies.

*Question.-* Is it not a fact that the conference held at Lucknow
condemned Hindu nationalism and communism only on the basis that it was
opposed t o the tenets of the Christian religion?

*Answer.-* Hindu nationalism and communism were condemned because they
run counter to the ideal of the secular State which in the judgment of
the people who took part in the conference is in accordance with the
tenets of the Christian religion.

*Question.-* Is it not a fact that Christianity teaches only those who
believe Christianity are, with God and the rest are not?

*Answer.-* The opinions recorded at Lucknow conference are not the
doctrines of the church.

Christians believe that salvation can he achieved only through Jesus
Christ.  They do not know any other method.

*Question.-* Was not this conference organised in order to find out
means and methods to carry out intensive and extensive methods for
convene?

*Answer.-* It was not a conference to make plans for evangelization.

Evangelism was one of the subjects at the Lucknow conference.

I also adhere to the opinion that loyalty to Christ is above loyalty to
the State.

*Question.-* Does not your loyalty to church come in conflict with your
loyalty to the nation?

*Answer.-* No.

*Question-Chairman.-* We have claimed exemption from the operation of
Madhya Pradesh Trust Act under section 36 (b) and as we are not a
trust.  Most of the Missions have applied for exemption from that Act
because they are not trusts for the benefit of the general public.

I hand over this written statement bearing upon the questionnaire for
the consideration of the Committee.  This should be treated as a
confidential document so long as the Mandamus procedure is pending.

*Name*.-Dr. I., S. Williams.  
*Caste*.-Christian.  
*Occupation*.-Arch Priest, Indian National Hindustani Church.  
*Address*.-Bombay.

I am a Doctor of Divinity.  I got this degree from the Indian Orthodox
Church.  Its headquarters are in Madras (South India).  It is a
registered body.  I shall send a copy of the constitution of this body. 
Archbishop Rev. K. C. Pillay was the founder of the Indian Orthodox
Church.  There are 18 churches in South India and one church at Bombay
with a congregation of 200.

One of the chief tenets of the church is Apostolic succession Archbishop
K. C. Pillay was consecrated Bishop by a synod of Bishops of the
Orthodox Church.  The church in India owes allegiance to the patriarch
of the Greek Orthodox Church in Antioch.  In the Bombay church the
Anglican litergy with consequential amendments, is used, as most of the
members originally belonged to the.  Anglican church.  The right, of
managership of the Church is still in dispute.  Originality it was an
Anglican church and the property of the church vested in the Secretary
of the State. I was a member of the Anglican church and so I and my
congregation came into possession of that church.  Later on we declared
ourselves independent of the foreign church administrative system.  The
whole congregation without any dissident voice adopted the Orthodox
faith.  There is no foreign organisation which controls our church.  The
Indian organisation is known as All-India Federation of National
Churches and all the independent churches in India are affiliated to
this central body.  None of the ecclesiastical dignitaries such as
Bishops or Archbishops receive any salary.  They all do honorary work. 
The building in Madras belongs to the Orthodox churches and is
controlled by Rev. Dr. Pillay.

Those who are members of our churches claim to be National Christians;
they am excluded from and deprived of the membership of the established
churches.

We hold the doctrine that Jesus Christ is the personal Saviour and the
only Saviour of the world and that baptism is necessary for salvation. 
We have preachers but not paid ones.  They have their independent means
of livelihood.

There was rally of the National Christians held at Jabalpur on the 4th
and 5th June 1955. I presided over this conference. I do not believe in
proselytization but I believe in conversion which means real change of
heart.  A Nationalist Christian does not believe in the control,
domination and authority from any foreign body.  It is because the
foreign domination destroys initiative in the first place and tends to
denationalise them. I say that the Christians with few honourable
exceptions in India are not nationalistic.  The loyalty of the Indian
Christian to a foreign church implies a loyalty to the State to which
the church belongs.

The Anglican Missions which are working in India believe that the ruling
sovereign of England is head of the Church that is wrong because Christ
is the head of the church and not the ruling king.  The Anglican
Missions working here also believe that the English Sovereign is the
Defender of the Faith of the church.

I use the word “ordinary” subject to correction.  The Indians who become
members of the American church are influenced by American culture.  To a
certain extent it will affect Indian Christians’ loyalty to his
country.  To give an illustration if there is a war between America and
India the Indian Christians who are under American church will not
enthusiastically support Indian Nation.  In the recent years I have
noticed a trend in the attitude of Indian Christians in favour of Indian
culture.

I presided over the rally of the Nationalist Christians held at Jabalpur
on the 4th and 5th June J955.  The resolution No. 3 passed at the rally
disapproves of the continuance of the denationalising foreign church
administrative system in Free India and considers it baneful to the
national interest of the people in India in general and the Christians
in particular.  I do not mind a foreign Missionary working in India on
the invitation of the Indian Nationalist Church, but I disapprove of a
foreign Missionary working here under the control of his foreign church
administrative system whereby he imports into India his denominational
system.  The foreign church administrative system results in the
denationalisation of Indian Christians.

About six foreign Missionaries had come at our invitation and helped in
the work of the National Church.  They preached and went away.  All they
said was that they had come to India to share their faith with the
Indian Christians.

Some of the methods adopted by the foreign Missionaries are not
spiritually sound.  They offer economic advantages to the poor as well
as to the needy.  The people gather round them with the hope of being
sent abroad for education and even for sight-seeing.  It is an
inducement.  I would not like any educational institution being under
the guidance and administration of any foreign Missionary, because no
independent country in the world will entrust the education of children
to any foreigner.  I dislike proselytization in any form. I will not
approve and do not approve of hospitals being used for this work.  I
have no personal knowledge of hospitals being used for proselytization.

Our movement has been opposed by the churches controlled by the foreign
Missionaries.  Opposition is mainly from church workers and other
stooges of Missionaries.  We are welcomed by non-Christians, 'both by
Hindus and Muslims.  Even in Jabalpur an Aryasamajist, Hindu
Mahasabhaite, welcomed our attitude in this matter.  They did not mind
expression of my faith that Jesus Christ was the only Saviour. I have
not converted any one in the sense of baptism, but I did preach Jesus
Christ and it is possible that people got converted in their hearts. 
There is a genuine respect for Christ among the non-Christians.  Even
when our foreign friends visited Bombay, 2 from America and one from
Canada, the reception was accorded to them by non-Christians and that
was attended by Jains, Aryasamajists, Parsis and others and Ramkrishna
Mission and the Sanatani Hindus.  The audience mostly consisted of
non-Christians and Hindus.  Only if we are freed from the domination of
the Alien Church Administration would Christians be welcome in India by
all sections of people.  I can give an instance of how non-Christians
appreciate the Christians and their religion also.  When there was a
funeral of one Mr. Kale, a Hindu, a Kshatriya by caste at Sonapur,
Bombay, there was performance of rituals by Hindus, and speeches were
also delivered, and before cremation I was requested to address the
people, as also to offer a Christian prayer; and I did so very
willingly, and there was an atmosphere of friendship between
non-Christians and Christians.  This will always be so between
Christians and non-Christians if the foreign control is withdrawn.

*To Mr. Tiwari of Mungeli-*

My birthplace is Muradabad. I was educated in a Hindu school at Sitapur
and in a Christian college at Lucknow and Lucknow University as well as
Bombay University.  Perhaps my grandfather or great grandfather became
Christian.  They belonged to the Sikh Community.  My father was in the
service of an American Mission and when.  I was about 10 years old I
came to understand things.  After that my father did not continue in
service.  We are 3 or 4 brothers.  Only 2 of us were learning in
school.  I was also reading in the High School.  All my domestic
expenses used to be incurred by my father.  I used to work in the
Methodist Church as a boy at Sitapur and Lucknow.  I used to attend the
St. Paul’s Church in Bombay.  I never visited Jabalpur before the rally
in 1955.  I do not know whether the name of P. D. Yadav is in my
register.  I was a guest of Shri E. Benjamin while I was at Jabalpur. 
There were 3 members in Shri Benjamin's house.  There were two females
and one male.  As by correspondence I knew Shri Benjamin I stayed as his
guest.  I know Rev. Bishop Pathak of Nagpur and also that Mr. Benjamin
is a member of the C. M. S. Church at Jabalpur.  I do not know if the
church in Jabalpur is under any supervision of the Bishop.  I do not
know that Benjamin was ex-communicated from the church.  I conducted the
divine service in St. Luke’s Church at Jabalpur. I do not know that Shri
Benjamin had taken forcible possession of this church.  All I can
definitely remember is that Mr. S. D. Singh attended the rally in
Bombay.  There was no admission form circulated in any area on behalf of
my church.  I knew Shri Benjamin for 2 or 3 years through correspondence
I personally saw him for the first time at Jabalpur in connection with
the rally.  Even though a person may be the member of the All-India
Federation of the National Christians and president of the Committee he
may be a member of the C. M. S.; there is no objection.

*Question.-* The Missionaries work in India under their respective
foreign denominations.  Do you think that this is right or wrong?

*Answer.-* It is not right.

The All-India Federation of Nationalist Christians in India is not a
denominational institution.

*Question.-* Are you a Christian?

*Answer.-* I am not prepared to answer this question.

*Question.-* Have you read the Bible?

This question is disallowed.

Our Federation is an organisation of independent local churches.  There
is an independent church in Nagpur, but not yet affiliated.  The name of
the church is the Nagpur Independent Church.  Shri Rajaram Sontake is
the Minister of the Church. I do not know if he was a pastor of the 1840
church.

(Mr. Tiwari says that he was a pastor of 1840 church but was removed
from this office).

The Federation has no doctrines of its own; all that insists upon is
that the church should be independent, nationalist, free of control of
any outside church and that it should be Christian.  Some of our members
are foreigners and we have fellowship with foreign churches.  We have
received no monetary contribution from any foreign church.  I do not get
even a pie as a salary from my congregation.  I did not get even a
gift.  I had invited 5 or 6 foreign friends to Bombay.  I paid a few
hundred rupees which were raised by contributions.  In the first party
there were 4 and in the second party there were 2. One was from Canada
and 3 or 4 from U. S. A. There is a committee representing the All-India
Federation.  The president of that body is Shri R. S. Modak.  He lives
in America.  He is the President of the Indian Federation.  He is not
paid by the Federation and he maintains his livelihood there.

*Question.-* The visitors who came to India were the members of the
Federation.

*Answer.-* They were friends.

We do not want any foreign control even supranational.  I am very
positive that there should be no outside control in any form.  Even in
India our Bishop will not control the church, but only the Panchayats
will.  I preach every week in the open air.  No non-Christian ever
obstructed us.  We distribute copies of Gospel and tracts written by
ourselves or the tracts approved by our panchayat.  Schools should be
controlled by local panchayats in consultation with the Education
Department of Government.  I got the degree of D. D. in 1955. I did not
go to a foreign country through the Indian Orthodox Churches, although I
had been to foreign countries.  I went abroad for 2 or 3 months. I have
ceased to be a teacher for 3 years.  When I was a teacher my salary was
about Rs. 500 per month.  This Bombay Education Society was founded by
Europeans.  I served for 15 years.  This society was founded mostly by
Anglicans.  I joined the Federation in 1952.

*To the Chairman-*

There are 80 lakhs of Christians in India and every Christian is an
evangelist and therefore it is not necessary for any foreign Missionary
to come to India for evangelization.

*Name*.-Shri R. P. Tekem.  
*Age*.-31 years.  
*Occupation*.-General Secretary, State Adiwasi Sewa Mandal, Dharampeth,
Nagpur.  
*Address*.-Dharampeth, Nagpur.

This Sewa Mandal was started in 1947, Shri Lalsham Shaha, M.L.A., is the
President of the Mandal.  There are seven members in the Mandal.  We do
welfare work among the Adiwasis and we attend to their grievances in
education, employment, land and any harassment by Government officials. 
In Berar there are instances of Police officer having beaten the
Adiwasis and harassed them in other ways (the urine of their wives was
put in their mouth).  This occurred nine months ago.  I complained to
Government and an enquiry was made.  From 2nd September 1955, I toured
Berar and I found that there are no complaints of harassment by the
police.  The Adiwasis are not Christians.  Among the Adiwasis, even the
Christian Adiwasis do not depart from their customs except in their
worship.  Christian Adiwasis, at the time of marriage, observe their old
customs at home and then they go to the church for marriage.  Among us
there are no Sagotra marriages.  That custom continues even among
Adiwasi Christians.

Among us even if an Adiwasi goes to a Hindu temple, a mosque or a Church
he does not become a Hindu, or Muslim or Christian.  A Christian Adiwasi
will marry a member of the Adiwasi community only.  An Adiwasi will
marry an Adiwasi, whether he is a Christian or not because they worship
their own God.

There was an instance in Jashpur State.  The girl was in Government High
School.  Her original name was Nilima, but in the school register her
name was changed to Elsie.  She discovered the change of name when the
school certificate was given to her.  It was Government High School,
Jashpurnagar.  Her people for two generations were Christians.  As she
may be going to a Church she was considered to be a Christian, but in
reality she continues to be an Adiwasi, because she was born in the
Adiwasi community.  The Adiwasis are neither Christians nor Hindus.  In
the Tribal Welfare Schools Ramayan is taught to Adiwasis and the
Government is trying to convert them to Hinduism.  This can be found out
from the 1951 census.  In the census report there is a remark that the
number of the Adiwasis is being reduced on account of their conversion
either to Hinduism or Christianity.  Adiwasis regard that they are
neither Hindus nor Christians.  Their customs are different from those
of the Hindus or Christians.  There are now no conversions from the
Adiwasis.  The methods used for conversion to Christianity are not
objectionable.  In my opinion there is no conversion unless an Adiwasi
gives up his caste, *viz.*, the caste of a Gond.  If he remains in his
caste as a Gond, he will continue to be Gond even though he may embrace
Christianity or Hinduism.  We are not Hindus because we eat pork and
beef.

I object to the teaching of Ramayan and Mahabharata, if the Government
wants to give the knowledge of Ramayan then let it give the knowledge of
all religions, i.e., Hindu, Christian and Muslim.

*To Mr. A. B. Shinde of Jabalpur-*

If an Adiwasi becomes a Christian, Government withdraw the concession;
but if he becomes a Hindu the privileges are not discontinued.  When the
Christian Missionary tries to help any Harijan he is doing it in the
same way as a Hindu or a Muslim does.  
 

**No. 9**

*Name*.-Shri Gangaprasad Nandkishore Tiwari.  
*Caste*.-Christian.  
*Age*.-26 years.  
*Address*.-Mungeli, Madhya Pradesh.

I belong to the Church of Christ and that is the only one Church in the
whole world. I was baptised by a priest who belongs to the Church of
Christ at Katni.  The Church itself is known as Church of Christ. I was
converted in January 1952.  I go to churches of any denomination and I
preach the Gospel of Christ.  Besides this, I am a journalist and
publish the paper named “Sawadhan”. I conduct a paper called “Sawadhan”
in Hindi.  The proprietor of the press is Shri L. M. Patale.  There are
500 subscribers.  There is a fund consisting of the subscription of the
paper and some private offerings.  I get my pay from this fund.  There
is no definite salary.  I draw the amount as I require.

I was not offered any secular inducement such as a high Government post
or marriage, but the only inducement that appealed to me was that I was
admitted into the Kingdom of God and that I would attain peace of mind
and become a son of God and I would be delivered from sin.  This I
believed and I became a Christian.

While I was a Hindu I used to go to temples and I asked the priests
pointing towards the idol whether there was God there.  They said that
they were only earning their living.  Then I went to one Pandit who said
that I should go to temple and find God there.  Then I went to Bombay
and I got employment in a film company.  I was a cine-story writer and
an artist, *i.e.*, an actor.  For writing the story I had to study the
sacred books of the Hindus, Muslims and Christians.  I knew Bhagwad
geeta as I was Brahmin.  But I did not know Islam, so I went to a Moulvi
and he gave me some idea of Islam.  Then I began to study the Bible.  In
the course of study I was interested in St. John’s Gospel.  The great
difference which I found between the Christian and Hindu religions was
in the basic idea that God himself goes in search of sinner through
Christ, whereas in Hinduism man has to seek God and he does it through
digging wells, building Dharmashala and going on pilgrimages and
distributing charity, alms, etc., I went also to some Missionaries. 
They were indifferent towards me, under the impression that I was in
need of monetary help.  At Allahabad I met Rev. Pal Das, Secretary,
Tract and Books Society.  I asked for baptism and he said that I should
stay there for 15 days so that my sincerely would be tested.  Then I
went to Cawnpur, Lucknow Jhansi, Itarsi, Bhopal and ultimately Katni. 
Here I met brother Paras Masih who was pastor in charge of the Church of
Christ.  Here again I asked for baptism.  His answer was that I should
stay for a week after which I would be baptised.  After this I was
baptised.

When I went to Mungeli, my native place, I was much harassed by my
friends and acquaintances.  I was editing the newspaper “Sawadhan” At
that time it was a political paper.  One Babulal Kesharwani filed a
criminal case against me stating that I was not the editor of Sawadhan. 
The complaint was dismissed in the court of Shri G. B. Singh. I have not
accepted service under any Mission in India.  I joined the theological
seminary at Janjgir.  With the help of some friends I began publication
of the “Sawadhan” It was stopped due to financial stringency.  I was
invited to preach in many churches in Madhya Pradesh, United Provinces,
Vindhya Pradesh and Bombay and South India, *i.e.*, Deccan.  Now with
the help of friends I am able to keep the “Sawadhan” paper going from
last year.  The Hindus used to regard satnamis, and others as
untouchables, their shadow also was avoided by them.  That was the state
of things I found when I was a Hindu.  In my own house there were 12-13
satnamis as servants, but they were treated as animals.  They were not
even allowed entry into temples.  Among the Hindus the vast majority,
i.e., 99 per cent of people disapproved of a man embracing any religion
out of conviction and they always try to disgrace him and put all
difficulties in his way.

I go to my house out of love for my people but I am treated in a
different way.  Conversion to Christianity has in no way changed my
loyalty to India and culture.  In fact I began to love those whom I had
offended before.

I am acquainted with many of the foreign Missionaries in Madhya Pradesh
and I have lived with them and I never found that they tried to
influence the mind of Christians against their own State or alienating
them from the loyalty to their country.  I never staved with any Roman
Catholic Missionary.  Last year I visited Manendragarh and I preached
and distributed copies of tracts and gave my testimony.  Some people
there were so offended that they tried to catch me alone to do
violence.  I reported the matter to a police officer at Manendragarh and
he told me that there was a certain Goonda involved in the affair and
criminal case was pending against him. The police officer assured me
that no harm will be done to me.  I went to Chirimiri to preach in the
church.  But there I was shadowed by the police as I told them that I
had gone there not only to preach but to baptise.  Two constables of the
L. I. B. objected to my activities there and they brought me back to the
station.

While I was preaching at Itarsi in the open air there was an attack, on
me and my friend, made by the partisans of Hindu Mahasabha or Arya
Sabha.  There were two or three Municipal members who forced me to get
out of the place where I was preaching.  The other gentleman with me was
Rev. A. Aslum and Andrias from Jhansi and some Bible students from
Allahabad.  There was also propaganda conducted in the Newspaper “Jai
Hind” and also “Yug Dharma” Nagpur, against me.  Some eight or ten
people who had been recently converted to Christianity complained to me
that they were called by the police and threatened as to why they had
embraced Christianity.  In Takhatpur the tahsildar and some members of
the Gram Panchayat Committee brought pressure to bear upon me to get
reconverted to Hinduism.  After Anjordas gave his statement before the
Committee at Bilaspur he said to me, on my enquiry, that he had not been
prepared to give evidence but at the instance of Mr. Varma he came
forward and gave it.  At Bilaspur I along with some Christian friends
including women preached on 13th April 1955.  There was no obstruction
to the traffic as stated by Shri Chitale, but in the meantime R. S. S.
men turned up and they wanted to discuss with me.  Government ought to
take steps to prevent people from interfering in preaching.  When the
appointment of the Committee, as originally constituted, was announced
there was a general feeling that Christian preaching was being
prohibited.  The police also prevented us from preaching at Ganjipura
saying that the Government have appointed the Committee.

It is my definite and firm opinion that money should be received from
foreign countries for any purpose which is going to benefit the Indians
and Government.  As a result of an accident I was taken to the Medical
College Hospital on the 12th March 1952.  That accident was deliberately
caused as I happened to be a Christian.  I was shown as Brahmin in the
hospital.  I corrected it as Christian.  When Dr. Balkrishna came he
asked me the reasons for correcting it.  Then I was sent to the Mental
Hospital and I was there for ten days.  Then Dr. Dube certified that I
was quite alright.  I interpret this as a pressure or harassment.

*To Mr. S. K. Deshpande, Pleader-*

(Note.-Mr. Deshpande congratulated Shri Tiwari in that he considers
himself . still to be a Hindu and a patriot, even though he believes in
Christ.) There is nothing like Hindu religion.. There is Hindu culture. 
I read Gita and Puran.  I read Ved commentary.  My Ishta Deveta is
Parameshwar and there is only one God.  The Hindus say that they
tolerate worship of any God but then in practice they do not observe
it.  I have no faith in the Cross as a symbol of anything, such as,
reality, truth, etc., The Cross stands for man’s endeavour to rise to
divine life by sacrifice.  A Cross whether of wood or stone or metal,
has no value unless its reality is reflected in the mind.  I do not
regard the Cross as idolatory because I do not respect the Cross, as it
is represented.  I am not conversant with any of the beliefs of the
Roman Catholics.  It is my belief and I preach that salvation can be had
only through Jesus Christ.  There is nobody in the world besides him
whose name is given by God.  This is according to the Bible.  Nobody
opposed me saying that there can be salvation through other sources. 
Before conversion I was committing thefts from my house and used to
spend money in vices.

(The Chairman brought to the notice of Mr. Tiwari a letter written by
his father, dated the 20th July 1954, in which he complained that his
only son Mr. Tiwari was induced to become Christian by the Mungeli
Mission in the hope of being married and sent to America.)

I came across Miss Chobe at the.  Railway Station, Bilaspur.  It was
Miss Chobe who gave a copy of the Bible and I read it.  What my father
says in the application is absolutely false.  He wrote that letter at
the instance of Vishwanath Gupta.  “Jai Hind” paper belonged to a Trust
in which Seth Govinddas was a member.

Conversion affects the solidarity of the nation and national existence
is undermined.

I give instances, Eastern Bengal and Pakistan have come into existence
as a result of conversion. Jharkhand is a Christian movement, so also I
am afraid there will be a demand for a separate State in
Travancore-Cochine.  The safeguards that I suggest-

1\. That no minors should be allowed to be converted and attempt to
convert a minor should be prohibited by legislation.  Even if the father
happens to be a Christian the minors should never be allowed to be
converted, from one religion to another-.

> “Conversions should be registered on the lines of section 14 of the
> Central Provinces and Berar Public Safety Act, 1947 (Act No. 38 of
> 1947)”.

In the Managing Committees of mission schools, hospitals and hostels
there should be non-Christian members with one nominee of the
Government.  There should be at least a nominee of the Government and
there should be no religious teachings in schools.  That may be given in
colleges.  Ramayan and Mahabharat are not religious books, but they are
useful for giving moral training.

I cite the instance of Kashmir.  The influx of foreign Missionary
personnel and money should be stopped except on Government level.  This
restriction should be put through Government.

*To Mr. A. B. Shinde, Advocate of Jabalpur-*

I am a witness on behalf of the Hindu Mahasabha.  Mahabharat is a
historical book, and Ramayan consists of high ideals depicted in it. 
Ram is believed to be God by the Hindus.  Ramayan is a poetic history of
Ram. I do not know any historical developments in Buddhism and Jainism. 
By prehistoric I mean before Christ.  I would not recommend Bhagwad
Geeta to be taught in schools, because religion cannot be taught in
school.  I do not know any Jain institution which is exclusively Jain. 
If the constitution gives liberty to minority to have their own
institutions then it should be amended if there are no safeguards in the
constitution.  I am not against the import of milk-powder to India.  The
opinions I have stated represent the views of the Nagar Mahasabha, which
I represent.  I hold that conversion affects the loyalty of the people,
i.e., from Hinduism to Christianity and Islam and vice versa.  It is
because the Muslims and Christians do not regard India as their holy
land that their loyalty to the land is not to be depended on.  English
people’s holy land is Jerusalem.

*Address*.-Rasulia (Hoshangabad).  
*Age*.-40.  
*Caste*.-Christian.

I consider myself as Missionary but I may not be accepted as a
Missionary in the normal use of the term. My work at Rasulia is such
that it would not normally be classified as Missionary work.

I came to India in 1940 as a member of the Society of Friends.  I had
previously been working in France and Spain carrying out relief work. 
When I came to Rasulia and came to identify myself with the village
people I discovered that the greatest contribution I should make was
more completely to identify myself with the village people because the
need for general improvement in conditions in life of the people was
something in which I could make a contribution.  My concern for service
in India which developed in England came to take the shape of the desire
to share my life with village people as, completely as possible.  This
led to work at Rasulia centre; to building up of a programme of work in
the field of education, health, agriculture, cooperative, etc.  All of
the villagers are non-Christians.  The idea of conversion to
Christianity is foreign to the whole conception of sharing the life of
the people. I became quickly a student rather than a teacher to learn
the people’s mind in which I live.  In the Hoshangabad town and Itarsi
town there are Christians but in villages the people are
non-Christians.  In the centre there are some Christians.  We have no
preaching programme.

Our idea is not to build up a Church.  The friends came to India and
Hoshangabad for relief work about 60 years ago.  Since 1935 Rasulia has
become a centre of rural uplift work where both the English and the
Indians work together.  We feel it was a call to us to bring people of
various religions together and nationalities too and make them cooperate
with each other and come to deeper understanding.  The depth of
fellowship is much deeper now than it would be if we were to give the
impression that we have mind to convert the people.  Spiritually also we
come to closer understanding of each other.  A Hindu would show his
Bhagwad Geeta to explain to us the idea of forgiveness and *vice
versa*.  If there is a conversion of a Christian or a Hindu it would he
from a deep sense of call or conviction and it can take place either
way.  My experience is that on either side there is a desire to
understand each other, but not to convert which would lead to a conflict
among us which is not tolerated by us.  My position on this matter is
not shared by all friends but has been accepted by many friends
officially and personally. I believe this is true to the basic principle
of quaker faith.  There are friends in India who engage in evangelistic
work, because of differences of conviction in the society of friends in
America.  They do not approve of the service programme of other
friends.  The friends operated a Mission hospital of 100 beds in
Itarsi.  It became impossible to provide adequate financial support for
such an important hospital and arrangement was made by which friends,
the Local Government, the Municipality combined to administer the
hospital for the past two years.  It has been used by the Community
Project and Friends continued to give financial support.  Our friends
felt that such a hospital could be run efficiently from 7,000 miles away
and finance adequately for the needs of the area.  While the hospital
was administered by the friends the whole staff was Christian and during
the five years of the transitional period by community project the same
staff remains. Now the Medical Superintendent has to retire under the
rule and a non-Christian Medical Superintendent is brought.  It was the
basic principle of friends that there should be no proselytization
carried on in hospital and I have never heard.  The nurses had private
prayers.  We wanted to get non-Christian nurses to be trained in our
institution but it was difficult to get them in the circumstances
mentioned.  I have no specific information about allegations of Mission
hospitals being used as means of conversion. I do not approve of
humanitarian service being used for conversion.  It is the presence of
the medical man which has religious conviction which will influence the
service and the treatment at the hospital, but criticism has been
levelled against both Christian and non-Christian doctors, The religious
question is irrelevant.  The spiritual nature of a medical man certainly
influences the efficiency of treatment.  I do not believe in any
organised society for preaching to the patients in the hospitals or in
the words.

Our work here is financed by English and American Government and public
there for social service projects.

We have a basic school at Rasulia.  All the teachers are Hindus. 
Religious instruction is imparted in this way that the birth day of Ram,
Krishna, Mohammad, Christ Jesus and their teachings conveyed to the
pupil so that they may understand the principles of religion.

We are carrying on other activities such as relief centres, adult
education, agriculture, dairying, health programme through Kasturba
health centres.

An aboriginal who remains in the village and goes on getting training
remains in the village environment; whereas the Christian aboriginal
enters into environment in which his life in the village becomes
estranged.  This is an unfortunate thing which happens, because of the
mental and environmental change taking place.

As a Christian I do not think that to ensure world peace the whole world
should be Christianised but I think that greater hope for world peace if
people following different religions understand each other better.

Conversion is a thing which no body can induce by talk, because it is an
inspiration received from God and it does not involve his becoming a
member of the Church on the other hand proselytisation means that one
man feels that his faith is superior to other man’s faith and he should
share his belief and he becomes a member of a Church. The inevitable end
of proselytisation is that he becomes member of the Church whether he be
a Muslim, Christian or Hindu.  This may be due to human weakness.  We
friends do not baptise at all.  During history many have attempted to
deny us as Christians.

*To Mr. A. B. Shinde-*

The Mid India yearly meeting of the Society Friends was and is
represented by the Mid India Representative Council.  Many years ago, I
was asked to attend the meeting of the National Christian Council as a
representative of the Friends Society Council.

A church is an assembly of people with certain identity of faith and
conviction. I am a Christian but do not accept any dogma. I believe in
many of the teachings of Bible.  Some of the teachings of the Bible
which I do not believe.  The World Council of Churches do not accept the
Friends as full members.  But our representatives do attend the world
conference and they did attend the Evanston conference.  We have
representatives in the United Nations also. I believe that the Bible has
a special message to me. (Asked if he did not feel the urge to share the
message of the Bible with the people.) The witness said, that he would
speak to the needs of the people and if he had a special message he
would give it in a language that would be understood by the people. I
have never come across any occasion on which I felt it necessary to
bring in the extranious message of the Old Testament or the New
Testament to meet the needs of the people, but I have shared the message
of the Bible as it come to me through spirit in terms that the people
could understand.  I have had several people coming to me asking for the
message of the Bible and for conversion but I always found that there
were extranious motives behind the request. I had no case of any one
coming to me desiring conversion as a direct result of my service.  But
colleagues of mine have asked for better enlightenment regarding my
faith because of my association with them.  The scheduled caste and
scheduled tribes people responded more to our work than other caste
people.  The out-caste feel the need of our service so that he may have
an opportunity to advance but our service is meant for all.  There was
no otter Hindu or Muslim or Government working agency working when we
began our work.  The centre was started in 1935.  My centre operates 20
villages and  I never found any particular body carrying on this work. 
A representative of the friends came to India to enquire into the
possibilities of any mission or other group taking over the hospital
without success.  It was at the instance of our group. I differ from
other Missionaries as my religious beliefs are generally unacceptable
and my approach to village work is different.  When an aboriginal
becomes a Christian be is estranged from his community because he enters
into different pattern of life which I regard as unfortunate.  An
aboriginal has a culture of his own, a pattern of life and it is
unfortunate that he should abandon that pattern of life as a result of
conversion.

*To Mr. S. K. Deshpande-*

If after becoming a Christian, one were to live and share along with his
brotheren, he would not be shunned by the society because he had become
a Christian but it is he who becomes Christian unfortunately feels that
he can not mix up with that society and, therefore, he becomes estranged
from the society.

*Question.-* You had said that it was very unfortunate that an
aboriginal when he becomes a Christian begins to think that his history
is the history of the English after conversion.

*Answer.-* I do not think that this is general.

*To Mr. A. B. Shinde-*

By history I mean sense of identity with the Missionary, his life and
history, but I do not think that his loyalty is changed.

I am convinced, as a result of 15 years’ experience in India, that there
is a place for Western people living and serving in India as
Christians.  I personally dislike to use a label because labels cause
confusion.  It is not clear what a “Christian” is, because those who are
supposed to speak with authority as Christians differ in their
interpretation of its meaning.  Even so, there is no objection to a
Western person, as a Christian, living in India and witnessing to his or
her faith.  The difficulty arises where an attempt is made to draw
others from their faiths and persuade them to adopt the Christian faith,
and when means are used to achieve this which are unrelated to the
spiritual purpose which a change of faith necessarily involves.  I don’t
think anyone will deny the possibility and the rightness in some
circumstances of conversion.  A faith, if held strongly, has to be
expressed outwardly either in words or in action, and when a faith is so
expressed some will inevitably be influenced and wish to adopt that
faith.  This should not necessarily divorce a person from his culture or
heritage, but it often does because the conversion is usually followed
by some outward rite of acceptance of new associations and allegiances
demanded by the group to which the convert is drawn.  This is an
expression of the weakness of the human vehicle by which religion is
brought to bear on the lives of men and women.

Personally, I have never been interested in converting another in the
sense of trying to draw him into my set of ideas, beliefs and
associations.  There are certain principles of life which I often find
it necessary to witness to because I believe that they are fundamental
to human growth, but in such witness I find that I am one with people of
all faiths, and with people without religious sectarian convictions. 
The world would be at a great loss if people of sincere conviction
ceased to witness to those convictions by word and deed, but such
witness brings all sincere people into one spiritual fellowship which
cuts right through sectarian barriers.  Any action which stems from the
idea that this truth is ours and any who wish to share in it must join
our society, is a hindrance to true development as all possessiveness
is.

The question of loyalty is an important one. I believe that a strongly
held religious faith does temper one’s sense of loyalty, because there
grows within the heart of men a sense of loyalty to principles which
have their source in God’s Truth rather than in the conceptions of men
and States.  Such a loyalty should be considered a national asset
because it brings into affairs of nations concepts which alone can lead
them into paths of peace and well-being.  The danger lies in an
acceptance of a religious faith which has extra-national loyalties by
people who cannot reach a full understanding of the higher spiritual
loyalties and are liable to be non-contributive or even harmful to
national aspirations.  A religion preached by Western people, the
outward signs and historical associations of which, are also non-Indian,
can have an influence on an unenlightened person which may lead him to
have anti-national thoughts.

In the Friends’ Rural Centre, Rasulia, of which I have been the Director
for twelve years, there has been a conscious attempt to bring into a
fellowship of service people of different religions and nationalities. 
The Christian and the Hindu, caste and outcaste, have worked and lived
together and have grown spiritually together.  Because of the complete
absence of desire to change a person’s religious affiliation, there has
been a greater desire to understand one another and the deeper aspects
of ones life.  Four-fifths of our staff are non-Christians but that is
immaterial because our objective is to carry out a concern for the
welfare of the village people and not to classify people under their
religious affiliations.

I feel that no one from the West who lives a normal Christian life
there, would deny that the spirit of our work is anything but Christian.
I hope that a Muslim and a Hindu would feel that the spirit of the work
is according to the best Muslim and Hindu traditions.  I feel sure that
within such a setting a Westerner finds a very warm welcome from India
and he is not expected to be anything but the best that he is capable of
being and do anything for which he has not a genuine calling.

The spirit of antagonism and suspicion between people of different
religions is very harmful.  It is not a climate in which the followers
of any religion can make a positive and true contribution.  All should
try to remove this antagonism and suspicion, that the contribution of
each can be truly assessed and brought into the channels of Indian
life.  Conversion or reconversion under any sort of *pressure* is
unspiritual and counter to the best of the culture of this great
country.

I was an active member of the Congress in Madhya Bharat for 10 years and
I am still in the Congress.  In last November I was at Shirki about 4
miles from Basana and I found the relations between Christians and
non-Christians were strained.  The Hindus of the village boycotted the
Christians and some of them (Christians) were not allowed to purchase
things from Hindu shops in the village.  The Christians belong to the
Mennonite Church.  Last November some one came from Delhi and he said
that he was deputed from Delhi and the people might have misunderstood
him as may have been sent from Government.  He began to say that
Christians insult our Gods and religion.  Some Hindus approached the
Christians for subscription to the Ganesh festival and the tension arose
because the Christians declined to subscribe as it was not a Christian
festival.  They said that whenever they had their Christian festival
they do not go to other people asking for money.  I have personal
knowledge of this incident.  I heard reports from Sagar district about
the harassment of the Christians by the Hindus.  The trouble in Shirko
was reported to the police but it appears that no action has been taken.

As regards the methods used for conversion we have to leave whatever
might have been done by Missionaries before 1947.  Since Independence
the attitude of them has changed not in all but in most cases.  The bulk
of the amount which is received from Home Board is used for the
maintenance of the hospitals and schools and a little fraction is being
devoted to evangelistic work.  By this I mean that the money goes to the
churches where they have to support pastors whose business is like
priest, purohits who look after the Christian community.  Some money
goes to the preachers.  I cannot say whether in comparison with the past
state of affairs it is more or less.  The salary of a preacher varies
according to his educational qualification.  If a man is B.A., B.T., his
salary may vary from Rs. 100 to Rs. 150 per month.  In some churches
there is a rule that nobody can be a pracharak and pastor unless he is
educated in theology.  Conversion to Christianity in no way affects the
loyalty of a person. I was a Christian and I had joined the Independence
movement in 1946 which was going on in the State.  I was running a hotel
in Biora in Rajgarh district in Madhya Bharat and a provision store and
a soda water factory and in my absence two employees of the political
department removed all the articles in my shop and I suffered a loss of
Rs. 24,000.  Provincial Congress Committee appointed a Committee on the
direction of the All India Congress Committee and they declared it to be
a political case.  This occurred in 1946.  The Diwan of the State asked
the patel to remove crops from my 25 Bighas of land and took possession
of the land. I have filed a suit in Biora tahsil court which is still
pending.  Last year, Government delivered the land to me but I was
deprived of the land by the Patel.  Hence I had to file the suit. I
cannot say that it was due to my being a sufferer or Christian.  What I
say is that the Christians may put up with all these hardships but will
remain loyal to our State and our Government. I cannot give the name
regarding harassment of Christians by some officials in Sagar.  It was a
stray talk when I gathered this information.  In 1950 the Government of
India invited an American psychologist Mr. Mc. Fee through UNESCO to
know the reason of tension between Hindus, Muslims and Refugees.  He
published his report in the book “In the Minds of Men”.  In my opinion
the present tension between Hindus and Christians ought to be made a
subject of psychological study.  This I think is the best way to deal
with the problem.

*To Mr. Munje, Advocate-*

(Mr. Munje represents R. S. S. and Hindu community in general.)

*Question.-* Was not the tension between Hindus and Mohamedans solved by
partition ?

*Answer.-*There is no comparison between that tension and present
tension.

*Question.-*Any reason to say for not such comparison.

*Answer.-*The reason is that the Muslims demanded the partition of the
country and the Christians surrendered the right even in separation.

The Muslims began to demand a separate State under the instigation of
Britishers.  Because in some parts of India there may be a strong
Christian minority you cannot assume that Christians will demand a
separate State.  There may be a few Christians who may have any
political demand but they do not do it being Christian party but as a
political party.  According to me this tension between Hindus and
Christians will not be solved by partition because we know the
conditions in Pakistan.

Even if the Christians will be in majority they will riot demand a
separate State.

I do not think that even ignorant Christians if backed by foreign
Missionaries will demand a separate State.  I will condemn Nagas,
whether Christians or non-Christians, if they want an independent State
for themselves.

I knew the late Rev. Gass who died in 1944. I am closely associated with
the Gass Memorial Centre as Secretary of the Sports Activities.  Their
activities cover adult education, vocational education for children,
ladies club, literary society and sports.  Anyone, Christian or
non-Christian, is entitled to become a member of any of these branches.
The subscription is Rs. 9 per year for all these activities.  The member
is entitled to take part in any of the various activities.  The money
for the maintenance of these institutions comes from abroad.  The
building also was constructed with the aid of abroad, i.e., American
Evangelical Mission.  There was no recreation centre provided for middle
class people until this centre was started. I have been a member since
1944 but I was never asked to embrace Christianity.  There is a hall in
which the Christians go for prayer in the evening for 5 minutes.  Even
the Christians are not asked to go there for prayer. I know Dr. Seyboldt
at Raipur as I come in contact often.  He is a learned man.  He is the
head of the Mission which owns these Gass Memorial activities and also
Tilda hospital.  The Mission conducts hospitals and schools and social
activities.  There should be no objection to the entry of foreign
missionaries into India as there should be some from our side going
abroad.  The money coming from abroad should be regulated by
Government.  The motive of those who send money to India must be for
humanitarian work.  This much I can guess.  We also distribute milk to
children irrespective of religion. I myself am distributing milk to the
Muslims of my locality.  Mahant Laxminarayandas is the President of the

I am an independent farmer from 1928. I have been born and brought up in
the district of Hoshangabad amongst the Quakers.  In 1919 I went as
delegate to the Peace Conference in London representing the Indian
Quakers.  I know the witness Mr. Donald Groom very well.  Mr. Donald
Groom is supported by the British Friends Service Council.  As far as I
know they have church one at Sohagpur, one at Hoshangabad, one at
Itarsi, village Makodia, and Banapura.  These are the churches of the
Quakers.  They are called Meeting Places.  They have the silent form of
service and they do not have paid evangelist.  The Church there is
self-supporting and Mr. Groom is supported by the Friends Council. 
There are two sections amongst the Quakers.  One is called
fundamentalist and the other section is called modernist.  The latter is
called the younger group.  The younger group does not believe in the
Bible as a whole but in some parts of it.  They call themselves
Christians.

*Question.-* Is a man Christian if he does not believe in the Old
Testament and New Testament?

*Answer.-* There must be unity in fundamentals though liberty in
accidentals but charity in all things.

*Question.-* Are the Quakers Christians ?

*Answer.-* Quakers are Christians.  They are members of the Mid-India
Representative Council.  They are like Vedantis and Sufis.  The Quakers
are pacifists.

I am not a Quaker now.  Officially I am not a Quaker but at heart I am
still a Quaker.  In that part of it I am a pacifist.

In my area there is no harassment of Christians on religious grounds. 
The little harassment that there is, is on political grounds, by the
Mahasabhaites and the R. S. S. because the Christians vote for the
Congress and not for the other parties. I do not agree with Mr. Groom
that a man by becoming a Christian becomes estranged from the
community.  My loyally is double to our nation though I am a Christian. 
My loyalty to the Government means my loyalty to the country and State,
and my foreign visit has made me doubly patriotic. The employees of the
Mission are in fact more patriotic and loyal to the State.  I am
treasurer of the Manku Ghat Mela which is the gathering of Christians. 
This Mela is an Association entirely managed by churches.  Indian
Christians assumed foreign names for getting railway service.  The
change of name has nothing to do with religion.  Foreign names were
assumed also to conceal their scheduled caste.

When a man becomes Christian he is not estranged from the family but on
the contrary he is excommunicated from his family.

Broadly, I am in favour of inter-marriages in Hindus and Christians and
vice-versa.

Throughout my life I had relations with foreign Missionaries as a
student in their Mission High School and Mission College, Lahore, and as
a doctor for 14 years in the Mission Hospital and now I am doing private
practice for the last 8 years.  The motive of the medical service is
just pure humanitarian service.  It is the qualification of the
Christian to be a Medical Missionary.  Our Lord put more force on
healing.  By healing I mean physical healing.  The works talk more than
the words.  Hospitals are not intended to be used as means of
evangelisation. I am the Honorary Secretary of the Hospitals of American
Evangelical Mission.  They are now managed by the Board created in
India.  The hospitals are at Tilda, at Baitalpur, Prakashpur, Orissa and
Hariar (Orissa). I have worked in Tilda hospital as Medical
Superintendent for 14 years.  There is a separate hospital for leper
which is carried on by the Mission to lepers.  I have never heard of any
case regarding physical, mental and economic force being used for
conversion.  Missionaries never give loans.  The ideal of the
Missionaries is that one good Christian is much better than a thousand
Christians in name.  We want genuine believers in Christianity and not
nominal people. We want quality and not quantity.  Indian Christians do
not want to form any political party.  They had once an association but
it has collapsed.  The setting of target as to numbers in the matter of
conversion does not mean departure from quality to quantity.

The Chairman brings to the notice the passage in an address given by Dr.
McLiash at the F. R. M. S. Conference in June 1948 relating to India. 
He said as follows :-

> “Recently our Indian leaders have seen the vision of an evangelised
> India and have issued a call to evangelise in the next 10 years these
> 600,000 villages in India.  The material resources are there, etc.”

My interpretation is that we have to carry the message of Christ to
these villages.  That is the meaning of evangelisation.

The target is only to make the Christians active.  The word
evangelisation also means evangelising the Christians.

By evangelisation we only mean that we bring the good news or the
message of Christ to non-Christians.  Conversion is not the idea and a
Christian, who does not do it, is not a Christian.

We only want to communicate our Christian experience to others and leave
it to them to accept it or not.

There is peace everywhere but there is a great deal of propaganda in
press against the Missionaries and the Christian community.  There are
two reasons.  One is that aggressive evangelistic work of the Arya
Samajist and the other is the political interest of the Maha Sabha and
the R. S. S. Jharkhand movement is not a Christian movement because it
includes also non-Christians.  It is not even a predominantly Christian
movement.  Up till now I have not gathered it from all sorts of papers
that Jharkhand movement has anything to do with Christians.  It is only
recently during the investigation of this Committee that it has been
alleged that the Christians are behind it.  I never knew that Mr.
Jaipalsingh was a Christian.  It is only now that I know that he is on
the Jharkhand ticket in the Centre.  Conversion to Christianity has
nothing to do with loyalty, *e.g.*, I am still a member of the
Congress.  Vishrampur started as a Christian and has ever remained a
Christian village.  The land was bought in 1868 by the Mission in open
auction and a Missionary built his bungalow on the land.  The evidence
given by Mahant Vaishnaodas at Raipur that Vishrampur was a Satnami
village is entirely false.

In Tilda hospital there is no regular preaching done in it but there is
a church outside the hospital compound to which anybody can go for
prayers.  The allegations made in this respect are false.

I am not against the inter-communal and inter-religious marriages, if it
is reciprocated.

By evangelism I mean carrying away the message of the Christ to the
world.  I used the word evangelistic in respect of Arya Samaj only in
the figurative.

*Question.-* What do you think of the hymn which was sung at the chapel
.of the hospital at Vellore.

> “On Christ is solid rock I stand”
>
> “All other ground it shifting sand”.

*Question.-* What right has the Christian to say all other ground is
shifting sand?

*Answer.-* They are singing a hymn in the Christian worship and they
have every right to sing that hymn that only shows the trend of their
Bhakti.

I am of opinion that hospitals should not be used as means of
propagation, because the life of the Christian doctor is a very potent
Christian.  I am not in favour of Bible being taught in schools. I am
not in favour of hospitals being used for proselytising purposes.

Chairman reads out from the reports of the Nazarene Church, 1954, page
20. “Evangelism is our cause, we make no………… Jesus has called us to
preach the Gospel to every creature………… How do you explain it?

*Answer.-* This statement is absolutely right.  That is our right to
preach by all means to every living being the message of the Christ.  It
may be only just by silent example of our lives and this right we
inherit from our Constitution.  I admit that Bible women go to the
patient's attendants, i.e., relations and friends attending on the
patient, who are generally non-Christians.  In the wards the preaching
is not allowed.  Personally I do not approve of even what I have said
above.

*Question.-* Do you approve of this “In our hospital we have a splendid
Bible woman in Sarjabai Yengad who daily gives her witness from room to
room also Sampat Shinde who is wonderful testimony works with the men
who come there.”

*Answer.-* I do not approve hospitals being used like this.  Such a
practice does not prevail in our Mission hospital, and other hospital I
know.

I file a written statement and a letter from Dr. Rev. Seybolt.  
 

**No. 17**

*Name*-Rev. Gurbachansingh.  
*Age*-43 years.  
*Occupation*-United Church of North India; Superintendent, Gass Memorial
Centre, Raipur.  
*Address*-Secretary, Mid-India Christian Council, Raipur; Member,
Executive Committee, National Christian Council of India.

I am working in the Gass Memorial Centre as Superintendent.  This
institution has been started and is being sponsored by the American
Evangelical Mission.  This Mission has many other activities besides the
Gass Memorial such as it runs four hospitals, a leper home, some
dispensaries, high school, four middle schools and it also co-operates
in Allahabad Agricultural Institute, Vellore Christian Medical College,
Ludhiana Christian Medical College, Pendra Road Sanitorium, Agricultural
Projects and other activities of social and humanitarian nature.  Until
the year 1954 it also conducted in co-operation with the Indian Church
evangelistic programme.  We have centres at Baitalpur, Mahasamund and
Baloda Bazar and Raipur, Tilda, Vishrampur, Bhatapara, Raigarh.  There
are seven married Missionaries, five unmarried, one married Missionary
is on furlough and two unmarried on furlough.  Artpolio is no more a
Missionary, as he has left before three years.  Mr. Bowl is an old
Missionary and he came much early as in 1946.  No Missionaries in the
American Evangelical Mission are such persons as had been to China. 
Even my name is misspelt and initials given there are not mine.  The
facts recorded in this directory are normally three to four years behind
the date of printing and at times some of them may be out of
corrections.  The Mission’s headquarters are at Raipur.  It sends
reports to its Home Board. The Home Board has its headquarters in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  I make reports to my governing body about
my work and not to the Mission directly.  The governing body can send
the report to the Mission.  Mission had at one time owned the village
Vishrampur which was originally established by the Pioneer Missionary of
the Mission but now the Mission does not own more than two acres of
land.  The last six acres were given to Bhudan.  Mission has some motor
vehicles for its different institutions.  “Massih Awaj” and “Prakash”
are edited by me.  “Massih Awaj” is the organ of the church.

*Question.-* You, perhaps, remember that Shri Bajirao, M.L.A., had
produced a copy of Satyanam Panth and he was unable to show from this
book that Guru Ghassidas was a Christian and a disciple of Christ.  The
words which occur at page 6 of this pamphlet are these “Issi Satyanamka
Prachar Sunau jiske Vareme abhi suna hu”.  The passages were read out
from page 5 to page 6, and part of page 7 was read.

*Answer.-* There is no reference that Ghassidas had become a Christian,
in this passage.  This passage was pointed out by the Chairman.

A reproduction entitled “Issai Jaye to Kaha Jaya” taken from Urdu
Riyasat weekly 2 on the 10th May 1954 was reproduced in “Massih Awaj”
because in this statement the editor of the magazine who is a Sikh very
vividly reports the condition of the Christians and ill-treatment meted
out to them in which even the State Government have remained silent.

At page 60 of the Blue Book, 1955, it was shown that on account of
Missionary salaries and appurtenances in India Mission is 90,072,28
dollars and now there are 28 Missionaries on the India roll.  In the
year 1955 the number of Missionaries is less than 28 including wives. 
Therefore the figure 28 shown in the Blue Book is not applicable to 1955
and out of this there are 4 Missionaries on furlough.  The rate of
exchange between dollar and rupee may be, I am informed, one dollar is
equal to Rs. 4-7-0.  This enquiry could be made from the National
Christian Council.

We do not use hospitals for propagating Christian religion in Mission
hospitals. The reference to hospitals and dispensaries in Blue Book,
1955, at page 61, is only to the Christian staff.  The reference to
communism and resurgent Hinduism being held in check is a statement of
fact based on the history of India.  It means that people have not
succumbed to the propaganda of communism and resurgent Hinduism even
though some of the conditions appeared to be favourable to them.  By the
resurgent Hinduism I think the reporter means R. S. S., Hindu Mahasabha,
Jansangh, Arya Samaj and any other similar body.

The reference to evangelical membership index on page 101 of the Blue
Book, 1955, pertains to Christians of this denomination in America and
not in India.

*Question.-* Tambaram report, page 38, on the World Mission of the
Church there is a statement “Care should be taken to secure that
evangelism has a central place in all medical and educational
institutions”.  This statement is reproduced in other parts of the
report.

*Answer.-* On page 43, an explanation of the previous statement is given
which reads as follows:-

> “Works of healing, education, the distribution of the Bible and
> Christian literature, rural uplift and social betterment hold their
> place for the varying ways in which they have expressed the spirit of
> compassion”.

It does not mean active evangelism in the hospitals, but the spirit of
love which Christ has shown and the Christians should conduct their
activities in the same spirit.

Dr. McLaish’s statement of the year 1948 I have seen it for the first
time.  When and where he made this statement I do not know. I think what
he means by this is that Christians should go forth sharing the message
of Christ with their fellow-countrymen in villages of India.  Since the
number of villages quoted are approximately 600,000 this statement seems
to be figurative rather than historical or statistical.

*Question.-*What do you mean by evangelization?

*Answer.-*By evangelisation I mean sharing the message of Christ with
the people.  It is based upon the various texts in the Bible including
the last command.

Christians believe in God as interpreted in the Bible, Our faith is the
way it is manifested in the Bible.  The description of God as the Father
of Jesus Christ implied Divinity of Christ and Incarnation.

*Question.-*I draw your attention to the sentence “That only God can
save the peoples, and that the God and Father of the Lord Jesus not only
can but will-and the only hope before the world lies in those who at
least attempt to know Him and to follow His way.  National Gods of any
kind, Gods of race or class, etc…………

*Answer.-*If the non-Christian religions think that by the word national
Gods means Gods of Hindus or Muslims or Greeks then they are mistaken. 
It means nationalism raised to the status of God may Nazis and Fascists
did where State was considered as God.

The attention is drawn to page 75 of the National Christian Council,
February 1954, to these words "He was crucified with his crime written
over his head, the King of the Jews with him the Kingship of God
appeared on earth…we cannot understand the New Testament without the Old
and Old Testament without New, therefore the Church treats them as one
book and the central theme of that book is God’s choosing (election of a
people to be his own people by whom he proposes to save the world).  Now
and this is the next great point (we who read in church today) read it
as members of that people.

*Answer.-* If this paragraph is read in continuation it explains
itself.  It is a matter of history which refers to a distant past that
is the days of the Jews and also their conception of themselves as
chosen people………… We Christians do not consider as chosen Christians.

I do not understand by that statement that Christians are a chosen
people and my own belief which is based upon the Bible according to that
I do not believe that Christians are a chosen people.  That is the
opinion of many.

I am a convert.  After becoming Christian I still felt that I am an
Indian like every other Indian and to this day I do not feel any
difference in my being Christian.  Gass Memorial activities can be
classified as follows:-

> “Social education with 16 centres and about 250 students.  Out of
> these 16 centres there are 6 centres which are conducted among the
> Rikshawalas.  Six Gao Sathis look after them.  The programme includes
> adult literacy, rural help, agriculture and poultry, community living
> and agriculture.  Matters of education are daily classes, monthly
> gatherings of adults, A. V. Shows, village libraries, social
> education, melas, etc.”.
>
> *“Second activity.-* Boys work which include junior boys, middle
> school boys camps, senior boys camps, Akhadas and other recreation
> games for boys.”
>
> *Third activity.-* Children’s work which includes village children
> centres, 3 weeks of children summer camps, children's monthly A. V. A.
> programmes.”

I present this book entitled “Chaturth Grishma-Kal”.  In these
children’s camps, children of all classes and communities come and
generally 500 to 600 children attend camps.  Saturday evening is the
parent’s night when even men like Mr. S. K. Shrivastava, Mr. M. P. Dube,
both former Deputy Commissioners of Raipur, Sarabhai Patel and many
other leading citizens of Raipur participated by presiding over the
camps.

*Literary activities.-* They includes poets gathering, debates, public
lectures and symposiums.

Recreation activities which include all major games both indoor and
outdoor and tournaments.

*Free Reading-room and Library-* Average attendance in our reading-room
is 250 to 300 a day and in best months even 500.

*Milk distributing centres.-* There is a Committee of living citizens
known as Relief Supplies Distribution Committee of the Gass Memorial
Centre.  Mahant Laxmi Narayandas, M.L.A., is the Chairman-supply with
the final approval of the Deputy Commissioner.  These supplies come from
the N. C. C. relief supplies committee which in turn receive from the
Church World Service.  Distribution is irrespective of caste, creed and
religion.  An approval plan is shown to the Honourable Member.

*Motive.-* It is service in the spirit of Christ.  All our activities
are advertised in the beginning of every month, so that members and
public know what is happening in the Gass Memorial Centre.

Missionaries bands of Rajnandgaon are members of the Mid-India Christian
Council and through it of N.C.C. I have heard about a leper clinic, the
one at Deori near Rajnandgaon. They have been working there for almost
20 years.  Just lately I have heard that the local Government officials
arbitrarily locked the clinic and told the Missionary authorities that
the Government would open there an Ayurvedic dispensary. I would call it
as the instance of harassment. I have received the information.

In the centre we have centre subscription and also whatever we get from
the hostel and third source is Mission grants.  We get no money through
our social education programme, literary activities, all reading-rooms
and A. V. A. activities.  We do not get any grants.  Total expenditure
is about a lakh of rupees for all these activities.  We get Rs. 33,000
from the Mission plus the free donation of the building.  This money
comes from outside India.  Beneficiaries are predominantly
non-Christians.  There is no interference of foreign Missionaries in
this administration.

This centre was originally started by the A. E. Mission in the year
1940-41. I have been connected with the centre from its very inception. 
Until end of 1952 the governing body of the centre was the Mission
executive.  But since then the centre is run by a governing body under
its own constitution.  There Are 12 committees consisting of members who
prepare and supervise the execution of the programme.  These members are
mostly non-Christians.

My attention has been invited to a statement on page 56 of Blue Book
1955, in which it is stated that the evangelical and reformed church
sends out Missionaries to Japan 40, Honkong 3, Honduras 22, Iraq 3,
Equador 4, Africa 21. I did not have a chance to read any complaint
about Missionaries in other countries. I have not heard any complaint
from Pakistan.

I have heard about Federation of National Churches.  There are a few
churches who are made up of Christians mostly broken away or
excommunicated by other denominations.  Such churches have made this
Federation.  The number of their churches all over India would not be
more than dozen in the sense I understand a church.  These churches are
not affiliated to the N.C.C. Dr. Williams belongs to this group.

I have received complaints from number of important Christians in
Christian work that their letters are sent for censor.  My letter was
censored.  I reported this to the Deputy Commissioner at Raipur, about
the year 1953.  I spoke to the Deputy Commissioner and D. S. P. about
this and thereafter at least I could not say that my letters are
censored.

Harassment that I know that some persons including some petty officials
made enquiries which appeared to me without reason and authority.  Such
enquiries are not made in writing.  For the last 2 years very aggressive
anti-Christian propaganda is being published in certain section of the
Press which is controlled by the communal bodies.

Some literature which has been presented before I did not feel the
necessity of bringing it here but there is much literature in
circulation which villifies the Christians and their faith.  The Indian
Church has also sent Missionaries to other countries and I believe the
church may even send more if the financial resources allow.  One such
Missionary is sent by my Church to East Africa only last month. The
Lutheran Church has sent 6 or 7 to Indonesia. I think the Church India
have sent some to Papua.  Normally the wives of Missionaries are not
doing any work.

As far as I know Jharkhand is not a movement sponsored by either
Christian Church or Christian Missionaries.  It is a movement of the
Adiwasis in Chhota Nagpur in which Christians and non-Christians are
taking part as Adiwasis.  I personally once wrote against this movement
in a general way.

Friends Service Council up-till 1951 was member of Mid-India Christian
Council after that membership was withdrawn but from this year they have
become members again and paid their membership.  There is no basic
difference in our Missionary and their Missionary.  Other Missions as a
result of their efforts have built a church in India and Friends Service
Council have built a Church in India.  Mid-India yearly meeting is an
association of those churches which came into being as a result of
efforts of Missionaries of Friends Service Council Mr. Groom as a person
may not believe.

In Raipur in his testimony Dr. Mukerjee, Leprosy Expert, M. P., deposed
that the Raipur Leprosy Home was run by the Mission to lepers as
Chandkhuri or Shantipur leper homes are run.  He also said that the
Missionary never submitted any report financial statement to the
Committee and he acted always in his own way.  My answer to that is that
there was an association which was a registered body made up of citizens
of Raipur and officers which were responsible wholly for this leper
home.  Some of the members of that Committee before leper home was
turned up to Government was Shri K. B. L. Seth, Khan Saheb Kerawala, Dr.
Abraham, Dr. D. N. Mukerjee.  This body had its own constitution and
secretary of the Committee was appointed by this body, who happened to
be a Missionary.

There is a statement here that the accounts were audited and all audit
objections answered.  In one of the statements written by Shri Seth,
reference is made that burnt out cases were coming to his house for
admission and staying under trees and he was unable to do anything for
them.  Shri Seth goes on saying I submit that this position should not
be to crated.  This clearly shows how the Secretary who was a Missionary
and the other officers work hand in hand in one of the reports there is
a request to Dr. Mukerjee and the Civil Surgeon to visit the leper home
from time to time.  This shows that after all activities of this home
were not conducted in any high-handed way.  Those who became Christians
in leper home, Raipur, over a long period of time but when the
administration was changed they became Arya Samajists 70 or 80 of them
together in one day.

There is a book depot in the Gass Memorial Centre but it does not form a
part of the centre.  The Mission runs it directly.  I have no connection
whatsoever with that depot.  I can’t give a list of books because I am
not connected with it.  North India Tract and Book Society is a
publishing house in Allahabad.  I have not read the tracts distributed
there.

*To Mr. Munje, Advocate.-* My opinion about the Akali movement is for a
separate State for Sikhs which is detrimental.  Any such movement is
detrimental to the State.  There is harassment of the Christians by the
majority of people and petty officials in certain areas.

Massih Awaj is the official organ of the church.  The statement from
Riyasat was published in this Massih Awaj without comments. (*June*
1954.)

Are you aware the Christians Naga behind this Naga movement.

*Answer.-* It is a movement of all the Nagas and not only of
Christians.  If I know that the Christians are connected with any
anti-national activity I would denounce it publicly.  Naga movement to
my knowledge is not a Christian movement.  I hear there are some
Christians.  If Naga movement aims to secede Naga land from India
completely then it is anti-national.

*Question.-* If Hindus say that they are persecuted by the Christians
will they be justified in demanding a separate State?

*Answer.-* This question is absurd.  Such a situation cannot arise.  I
have not read Christianity and Asian revolution.

*Question.-* Statement on page 95 on the book “Christianity and Asian
Revolution”, under paragraph 2. The ideological task.

*Answer.-* Explains a correct position.

The church does not dabble in politics in India as far as I know.  I do
not want to express any opinion on happenings in any other parts of the
world.

I do not understand the meaning of the term. “Religious nationality”.

I have not seen the book Christian Mission in Mid-India, by Bishop
Picket.

In my neighbourhood nobody has drawn my attention to any objectionable
literature prepared by Christians.  
 

(29-9-1955)

**S. No. 18**

*Name*-Rev. R. C. Das.  
*Age*-69 years.  
*Address*-129, Dashaswamedh, Benaras.

For the last nine years I am the Head of a Ashram known as Krisht Panthi
Ashram.  I am Editor of a magazine (bi-monthly) entitled “The Seeker”.

The methods and policy of the foreign Missionary have been foreign and I
have largely disagreed with them though not fully.  As for example they
preach in the streets which I think is derogatory to Christianity and I
think that it is too cheap a method of propagating the religion. I am an
evangelist. I think the spirit of Christianity suits the ideal of the
Ashram more than the life of ordinary Missionary.  Their method is very
largely foreign to our Indian culture.  The Christian life as it is
lived in India even by the Indian Christians is largely foreign.  I
embraced Christianity when I was a student in Dacca College at the age
of 25.  I have worked with Congress people as a volunteer.  Those who
are converted by foreign Missionaries are influenced by foreign method
of life and particularly the life in church.  A few can withstand like
myself.  The life of the foreign Missionaries as well as those of Indian
Christians who have imitated them is not consonant with the spirit of
the life of Jesus who was a Sanyasi, in fact the best type of Sanyasi.

The Missionaries have been doing excellent work, *i.e.*, noble work of
social and religious uplift in the tribal areas such as Santhal
parganas, Chhota Nagpur, Khasia hills, Lushia hills and some parts of
Himalays, Darjeeling and Kalimpong.  It is my personal opinion that
perhaps the foreign Missionaries did not understand the tribal culture
and they uprooted it, having been attracted by the modern material life
such as Manipuri dancing.

I have had no written complaints from any tribal people but I have had
verbal complaints made to me personally as a Editor of the Seeker by
such a man of standing as the Rev. Jowel Lakra, President of the
Lutheran Church in North-East India.  His complaint has been that the
Aryan and the Hindus as well as educated Bengali have oppressed them the
Adiwasis in various ways especially in the matter of educational and
economic ways.  We belong to a different culture which is quite
inevitable.  We belong to a Dravidian culture and we oppose the Aryan
culture.  This is what they say and there is another matter rather
serious to Government.  They also say that the Congress Government have
been trying to upset their educational system and many Hindus and
Sanyasis have gone among them and tried to upset the tribal men.  The
Adiwasi who is animist and is a Christian both agree on this point.

I do not think there have been any Missionaries at least not many who
have encouraged the spirit of independence amongst the tribals but the
spirit which we now see rather separating tendency in Assam and in
Jharkhand may be indirectly due to and is indirectly due to the modem
education which they have received and indirect result of their
acceptance of Christianity, *viz.*, Christianity exalts the value of
human personality to a particular individual or, of a group and I claim
that is the contribution of the Christianity to the whole world.  It has
reacted on the minds of these people which I think is undesirable that
they are exclusive and they do not want to be in co-operation with the
more educated people who come from the plain so that they do not want to
be under Union Government probably because it wants to unify the
people.  They have inherent love for independence, they are sturdy
people.  They fear that if they are under Union Government or if they
co-operate with the more cultured people of the plain they would be
dominated.  That is the real fear.

The majority of more organised missions in India have integrated
themselves into their own churches which they have appointed.  That
means that theoretically the missions do not exist but the Missionaries
with their funds and organisations are within the church and so they are
ruling as they have been ruling as before from the background.

But the Missionaries with their funds and their organisations and the
pattern of the church which they brought originally to India are
influencing the church life as well as outside life exactly in the same
way as before when they were separate.  In fact, I would say that this
influence is worse in its effect than the influence which they exerted
before when they were separate and outside the church.  If Missionaries
were out of the church and did not hold any executive administrative
position in the church and give money help in the form of Christian
charity and help the Indian I church spiritually, *i.e.*, by spiritual
ministration that would be the ideal thing and the Indian Christians
would feel independent and they will be one with their countrymen,
*e.g.*, culturally, in the full sense of cultural and national life. I
do not mean that they are not national or loyal to the State at
present.  It is only matter of degrees.  The Christian community is very
loyal to the State but not so much to the country, *i.e.*, to Indian
culture and social life.  This is because of the impact of the Western
culture, life upon India which has affected all communities but
Christians having had more to do with the West through the Missionaries
particularly have been more influenced by this.  It is also due to the
fact that Christian converts have been outcasted by the Hindus and in
various ways persecuted and have indirectly been influenced to think
less of the Indian culture than they should.  But I am happy to note
that the things have changed in recent years.  Converts are now allowed
to live with their families and in their communities and there is less
of persecution.

In principle I am opposed to inter-communal, and inter-religious
marriages because, in 10, 9 have been miserable cases.  I am sympathetic
to such marriages when they happen and I find a great growing volume of
opinion both among Indian Christians and more among Missionaries in
favour of my view.

*Question.-* How do you interpret the following expression?

Churches in every country rooted in the soil but supranational in their
witness and obedience. (World Council Hand book, page 29).

*Answer.-* Supranational means that church as a body of Christ that is
to say a Sangh of the believers and disciple of Christ are members of
one another and belong to one universal fellowship, ecumenical without
distinction of race, colour, nationality and status.

If it means International administrative missionary or organisation the
World Council of Churches may become a huge complicated world
organisation or International organisation then they will be on a par
with the Roman Catholic Churches.  It will have political repercussions
disastrous for Christianity and world peace.  It will mean not a church
of Christ but Christendom, which is not a spiritual body. I am opposed
to the concentration of position and wealth and political power in the
hands of religious leaders.  First of all it will hurt Christianity and
then it will hurt other races who follow different religions.  That idea
from political point of view is on the lines of pan-Islamism.

The denationalisation which we observe among Christians about which
mention has been made before is indirectly due to the Mission’s very set
up which is foreign and has been imported into India and also indirectly
due to the large amount of help that the Indian Christians are getting.

Some express the fear that in case of a conflict between India and
America Indian Christians may act as fifth columnist and join with. 
America in the fight. I see no danger at present, but there is a
possibility of such a danger if tile Indian church does not relate
itself rightly to the Indian life and full social and political life of
Indians. The church may develop, go into its own shell like the Syrian
Church in South India, and then if the Missionaries continue for some
years in India and if the Indian Christian leaders who are trained by
them remain on par and if Indian Christians are encouraged indirectly or
directly by Missionaries a situation that arose in India such as
Pakistan may arise.  This may happen especially if America continues to
dominate Asia through her money power and her military power through the
grants-in-aid and free gifts and through the political alliances.  I am
against Government receiving American aid.  If that power increases and
the alliances are more than the Indian Christians may be used as tools.

The Missionaries of the old, organisations were more sensible but now
there is an influx of younger missionaries who are not so cultured or
sympathetic towards India. I wish these were stopped. There are some
Missionaries who are one day in Delhi and. second day in Benaras and
another day in Cawnpore.

Some of the older missions have been decreasing in number and I know
instances of S.P.G. and C.E.M.S.

I heard of the Federation of the National Orthodox Churches.  Their
stand for nationalism I accept but I do not approve of some of their
methods which are not all above board.

There is little mass conversion but I believe it.  I too believe that a
group can be spiritually converted.  There have been instances of mass
conversions in India like the spread of Buddhism, Vaishnavism.  It all
depends on the motive and methods.  If a motive is number that is
ignoble and un-Christian.  If it is a spiritual and moral good of the
people then it is noble and I wish that the whole of India should be
Christian in that spirit.  But in the past I cannot say that the methods
used by missionaries have been wise and right.  In the past unwise and
un-Christian methods have been used and this has hurt the church.  So
such methods have almost to be abandoned

I do not understand militant minority in a sense otherwise than
spiritual, but personally I would not use the word for religious
purposes.  When you use the word in masses they lose the spiritual
sense.

Instead of using the word aggressive in connection with evangelism, I
would use active or dynamic.

*To Mr. A. B. Shinde.-* What is meant by culture?

*Answer.-* Culture is constituted of many things like the dress one
wears, food one cats, and the life one leads (external) and certain
ideological and emotional tendencies.  Western culture has influenced
all communities particularly the people of the Punjab, after the first
world war.  The majority of Christian converts have been from the
untouchables and lower strata of society.  They have left Hindu fold
because of injustice of the caste system.  But there is no caste in
Hinduism in the spiritual world.  The Christians have caste in spiritual
world.  The temple worship does not give an idea of Hindu spirituality. 
A priest in the Hindu temple when he realises his spiritual life leaves
the temple.  Temple, worship in Hinduism is not central but only
peripheral while church worship is central in Christianity.  The church
which really means the congregation of believers not necessarily the
building is central.  In the villages and tribal areas people left their
original fold because of the social injustices they were subject to, at
the hands of the Hindus.

The idea of nationality existed among the Hindus but they did not
realise on a large scale as they did under British rule.  Citizenship
first of all.  By nationality I mean being under one political
authority, and it was only under the British that the whole of India was
unified.  Modern nationalism has a bigger content but nationalism is not
a new concept in India. I have enjoyed the friendship of many noble
Muslim, they have feeling that they are untouchables in India.  So the
caste was partly responsible for Pakistan.  Pan Islamism was largely
responsible for Pakistan.  Burma is separated because of the difference
of race, culture, mentality and language is so different.  Linguistic
provinces, I think, are not essential.  It separates people locally and
immediately.  English has been a very good via media.  The rigid
services of Western churches and the general atmosphere of the churches
are not conducive to the full Indian Christian life.  There was a
practical ban on development of Indian church life including worship. 
Indian enquirers are not helped by worship in the churches, which do not
appeal to them.  Their feelings are hurt.  The word rooted in the soil
implies cultural and social life.  Supranational means spiritual
fellowship.  The Catholics may be fifth columnist in case there is a war
between India and a State of Catholic faith. I will not spy that about
the Protestants.  Protestants are more influenced by British culture.

Adiwasis are not Hindus.  They are Animists nothing to do with Aryas. 
They fought with the Aryas but later on came to compromise.  Because the
Arya Samajist accept the Vedas they are Hindus.  The term Hindu is not
religious at all. It is a general term.

Anglican Church in India which is now known as Church of India, Burma,
Ceylon is definitely receiving grants from the C.E.M.S., S.P.G.E. and
other Mission bodies.  The Bishop’s fund is augmented by the grants from
abroad It is the administrative system that makes the church
independent.

The Seeker of which I am editor is a pro-Missionary paper in the real
sense.  But I have written against the policies of the foreign Missions
and have also attacked the church.

*To Mr. Deshpande.-* The Indigenous religions of this country and
culture which is basically Aryan teach respect for other religions. 
They teach that the different religions have various ways to reach the
Almightly.  They teach that there is no monopoly of anyone creed for
attaining salvation.  As a Christian I do not accept the position that
the many religions are different ways necessarily leading to the same
truth.  Christianity claims not monopoly, but finality and uniqueness of
truth and God.

I have been educated in Christian Mission school in Indora, Nagpur.  It
was run by the Methodist Mission.  I have passed my fourth Marathi
standard from that school.  All my teachers in that school have been
Christians and they used to take scripture classes as the part of our
daily education.  It was in the year 1928-32.  Bible classes were
compulsory there.  They used to stage dramas in which I used to act as
angel.  The drama was staged about the resurrection of Christ.  These
dramas were used to be staged at the festival of Christmas.  We were all
Hindu students in the school and our teachers used to give books of
Gospels for selling in the Mandali that used to be held at 2 places in
Indora.  I myself had collected at about 10 annas and had given the
amount to the teacher.  The students were nominated from the class for
this work.  As obedient students we did not like to displease our
teachers.  There was competition about the drawing of the sign of the
Cross and in my second Marathi standard I had won the first prize.  They
used to teach us songs which of course propagated the religion but at
the same time several songs also deprecated Hindu religion.  These songs
were taught in general class “Jap Tap Anusthan” Tirtha Yatra which refer
to Hindu religion were the words of the song which were deprecated.  So
also, Tirthawadi Snan Dan Karuni Mhanati Punyawan, as also “Raje Yeshu
Ala, Saitanala Jinkayala”.  An ideology to impress a feeling for
Jerusalem a song was sung by the students in which the words were
“Jerusalem he far priya nam” etc.

Whenever the teachers found time to converse that the students of our
religion they always looked down upon the Hindu religion saying that we
had very bad customs such as cutting of goats before the “Mata” and the
10 Awatars of the Hindus was nothing but a beastly demonstration.  The
Satwai, the Marimai, the Marbat and the 16,000 wives of Krishna and the
running away of Ram’s wife were impressed, as hateful and the merit of
Christian religion was brought to the notice of the students.  This had
its effect on the small child mind.  They used to speak high of
foreigners that they never worshipped the Goddess Laxmi nor do they
worship Hanuman or Bhim but are still so wealthy and healthy and are
superior ruling class.  They spoke ill of Hindu ways while talked high
of western civilization,

When I was a student I was not asked to become a Christian and no
inducement was offered.  There was never a case of conversion in the
school.  One of my teachers in the school before my marriage had met me
about 8 or 9 times and had tried to convert me by merely saying that he
would arrange for my marriage with a particular Christian girl in his
view.  It was in the year 1950.  I had asked him if the girl could be
converted to Hinduism to which he had flatly refused.  Mr. L. K. Damle
is the teacher concerned.  He lives in Lashkari bag, Nagpur

Foreign Missionary used to go round in our locality with Indian
preachers for preaching and inducement.  One Raibhan Dahiwile was
offered a post of a teacher in Koradi when he had shown his willingness
to become converted but his jot) was snatched of from him when he
refused to change his religion.

*To Mr. Shinde, Advocate.-* I belong to Mahar community.  There was no
other school in my basti and others were too far away. I used to pay one
anna per month as fees.  I did sell these tracts under compulsion. I had
no courage to refuse the sale. I was 7 or 8 years of age and I knew only
to obey my teachers.

That is the school where foundation of my education was built.  I have
never had the occasion to make this kind of complaint before but I used
to make fun of all these methods of our teachers when we met with the
members of our own community. I come in complaint because the Committee
is sitting. 

Saitan means heathen *i.e.*, Daityas.  In the song Saitan refers to
demons and daityas and Bhuraji, Nasaji, Masoba, Satwai, Marimai whom we
do worship.  They used to explain the song in this fashion.  Mr. Raibhan
Dahiwile himself told me.

I knew the Christian girl since my childhood that Mr. Damle spoke to
me.  Her mother was a convert from Mahar community.  She was a born
Christian.  I had seen the girl several times in my locality.  Had she
become a Hindu I would have married her.  I have never spoken to her nor
was I in love with her.  I am a married man now.

*Father’s name*-Govindrao.  
*Age*-60 years.  
*Occupation*-Honorary State Organiser, T.W.D.  
*Address*-Nagpur.

I am working in Madhya Pradesh Tribal Welfare Department as Honorary
State Organiser.  I get honorarium.  They give me Rs. 450 *plus* Rs. 200
compensatory cost of living allowance.  I have been working for the last
nine years.  The scheme prepared by Thakkar Bappa was called Backward
Areas Welfare Scheme and now it is called Tribal Welfare Scheme.  I was
one of the members of the Thakkar Bappa Committee which framed the
Backward Areas Welfare Scheme for Madhya Pradesh Government in the year
1946 and as the scheme was prepared by Thakkar Bappa Committee and
Government wanted someone who had experience of the tribal people my
services were placed at the disposal of the Government by Thakkar
Bappa.  Prior to that I was already working as Secretary of the Gond
Sewak Sangh the institution started by Thakkar Bappa in Mandla
district.  This was started in the year April 1944.

I want to make my statement on two points here.  One that the Christian
Missionaries used to convert the aboriginals by offering various
allurements and two, that their activities were found anti-national and
anti-Government.  Since 1923 I had been working amongst the Bhills in
Panchmahal district in Bohod and Zalod taluqs of the Bombay Presidency
in the institution named Bhill Sewa Mandal. I am a life member of that
institution.  Life member means one who takes a vow to serve the tribal
people for 20 years.  I joined the institution in the year 1923 and
worked under the guidance of late Rev. Thakkar Bappa, the President of
the Mandal.  While I was working in Bhill Sewa Mandal Mr. D. Semington,
I.C.S., Special Enquiry Officer for aboriginals, like Mr. Grigson of
Madhya Pradesh, visited my Ashram in November 1937.  He was accompanied
by three or four Missionaries, and raised the question why Ram-Mandir
was there as the Bhills were animists and not Hindus (Mr. Shinde objects
to this part of evidence, as the aboriginals are animists and this is
relevant what happened in 1937 out of Madhya Pradesh.  The objection is
overruled.-Mr. Semington in his report at page 90, paragraph 210 of the
report by Mr. D. Semington Special Enquiry Officer, 1939, Bombay).  The
reason why Semington was appointed was that a Christian girl had fallen
in love with a Bhill boy and the question was whether she should become
a Hindu or the boy should become a Christian.  She was inclined to
become a Hindu but her relations opposed when the matter was brought to
the notice of Missionaries they expressed their disapproval and demanded
back the loan of Rs. 100 which had been advanced to the family more than
12 years with interest which amounted to Rs. 1,200.  Later on it was
found that the loan had become barred out of time.  Then not only the
girl but the whole family of the girl became Hindus, and the marriage
was performed.  It was in this connection Mr. Semington was appointed
and he came to my Ashram, for enquiry. I told Semington that Valmiki,
Hanuman, Jambuwant and others were aboriginals and they were Bhaktas of
Ram, because the aboriginals helped Ram in his victory.  Shabari, Gohak,
Hanuman who were all aboriginals were devotees of Ram.  In the eye of
the Census authorities the tribals in Madhya Pradesh or tribals in
Bombay or elsewhere are supposed to belong to the same religion, viz.,
tribal religion.

From 1948 to 1953, I received reports about the various allurements that
were given by the Missionaries and some other forms intended to convert
them to Christianity.  I file some extracts from the reports received
from 1948-53.  First case is that a Revenue Inspector of Sanna employed
30 to 40 men to repair his house without payment by way of Bigar. I do
not know whether the Revenue Inspector was Christian or not.  In order
to escape from Bigar the Uraons or aboriginals embrace Christianity, so
as to get the help of the Missionaries.

Father Vermier, who is generally called Father Superior of Gholeng,
objected to the Government Tribal schools being started in the vicinity
of the Catholic schools.  He had written a letter to a friend of his in
Calcutta, in which he had mentioned that he had started activities
against the Government.  That letter anyhow came into the hands of the
Chief Minister on the 23rd August 1948.  The Father had come purposely
to interview with the Chief Minister with the complaint.  I and Dr. Jha
were present at the Chief Minister’s bungalow.  When the letter was read
out to him he confessed that it was written by him.  Father was
immediately transferred to Ranchi.  I am filing a true copy of the
memorandum bearing signature of Dr. Jha and Father Vermier, regarding
what transpired at the interview. (Original to be returned after
copying). I have not got a copy of the complaint made by Father Vermier
with reference to which there was official interview but I file a copy
of the nature of complaint.  This relates to Tapkara Mission.  This I
call as anti-Government movement.  Now I come to anti-national movement
of the Missionaries.

In the early part of 1948 we received reports that an attempt was being
made to form a separate state, *e.g.*, Adiwasi Sthan, or Jharkhand, or
Dharma Prant.  Here I have a copy of the report alleged to have been
sent by Mr. Deshpande who was District Organiser.  This report to the
best of my recollection, was made in July 1948.  The original is with
Government.  The copy is undated.  DeMeulder in his book “Tribal India
speaks” at pages 107-108 tries to support the demand for Jharkhand.

In the Ahiri Jamindari of Chanda district about 50 families of Harijans
who had been converted to Christianity reverted to their original.  This
information is based on the report of my Area Organiser. I received this
report on the 25th May 1953.

I file two pamphlets entitled “Hindu Moksha” and “Kaliyug Katha.”

The Missionaries working in tribal areas try to obstruct the work of
Tribal Welfare Department.

*To Mr. A. B. Shinde, Advocate.-* I have got the permission of the
Director of Tribal Welfare to appear before the Committee. I am drawing
honorarium with compensatory cost of living allowance and I am not a
Government servant. I was drawing about Rs. 200 while I was in Mandla
institution.  There are Hinduised tribals, Christianised tribals and
tribals having tribal religion.  Whenever they greet each other they
use.  Ram Ram.  Even when they drink wine they say Ram Ram.

Bhill Sewa Mandal in Dohad was a private registered body and when
Semington came there and-enquired of me as to the necessity of Ram
Mandir, I did not object to his, coming, because I wanted to convince
him that the Bhills worship Ram.  They have also got a Ramayan in Bhili
language.  The Arya Samajist converted the whole family as they resented
the attitude of Missionaries.  To the best of recollection the marriage
had taken place in 1936.  Semington came to me in early 1938 and at the
end of December 1937, Bhill Sewa Mandal was started to serve the cause
of Bhills.  It is not a religious body.  The Bhill Sewa Mandals help
tribals whether Christians or not.  We built Ram, Mandir because they
were worshipping.  Ram.  They were not worshipping Christ and as such we
did not build church.  If there is any movement started by some people,
I will blame the movement and not the community.  The Jharkhand movement
was sponsored by Missionaries and therefore I call it anti-national and
anti-Government.  This does not mean Christians as a whole.  Because the
50 families became reconverted to Hinduism I think they were not genuine
Christians. I cannot say who converted the harijan families. I receive
reports of conversion as well as reconversion from my office.  In the
report there was no mention of the fact that who were the Missionaries
foreign or local.  They became converts for their stomach’s sake and
they are not genuine Christians.

*Name*-Dr. Baldeoprasad Mishra.  
*Caste*-Hindu.  
*Age*-57 years.  
*Occupation*-Ex-Diwan, Raigarh State.  
*Address*-Rajnandgaon.

I am D. Lit. of Nagpur University. I was Diwan of Raigarh State from
1930-40 but I was residing there since 1923, and also I was an Assistant
Diwan.

I am familiar with the state of affairs relating to tribals in Raigarh
State, Udaipur State and Jashpur State.  In 1936 when I was Diwan, a law
was enacted entitled “Anti-conversion Act” regarding conversion.  In
1936 we received a letter from Bishop of Ranchi requesting us for
permission to build a church.  Before receipt of this letter there was
some kind of activity going on in the State which people could not
understand and that was from Jashpur side.  Its significance came to our
notice when the Bishop of Ranchi came to see me in my capacity as
Diwan.  He also had an interview with the Raja of Raigarh.  His
correspondence was really with the Raja Saheb.  In the course of the
interview he claimed that there were 4,000 Christians in Raigarh State
which appeared to be false.  He further said that he was responsible for
saving their souls and that therefore he wished to have a church for
them. For this purpose he wanted a plot of land.  On enquiry I found
that in reality there were no Christians.  They told me that some people
from Jashpur State came into the Raigarh State, of their own community,
and said that on the frontiers of the Raigarh State the Saheb Mahajan,
*i.e.*, the white Missionary moneylender has made arrangements for
lending money on cheap rate of interest to needy persons.  They also
said that when they went to ask for loan they were told that money would
be lent to those who would cut of their choti (top-knot).  They said
that the tuft of the hair on the head would grow in naturally but the
opportunity of borrowing money would not occur again.  They allowed
their choti to be cut out and obtained money.  The sums raising from Rs.
10 to Rs. 50 were distributed.  The total amount may be about Rupees
seven to eight thousands.  In their registers they not only noted down
the names of the headman of the family but all the names of the family
on the ground that if the head of the family died the family would be
responsible for the loan.  The Missionaries then proposed the condition
that to make sure that they should not run away they should be sending
their own man on every Sunday to know their whereabouts, Then the man
who used to come on every Sunday proposed that it was very inconvenient
for him to seek out debtors in their homes and therefore it would be
desirable that all of them gather together on the date he arrives in
that village.  The emissary of the Missionary used to satisfy himself
about the presence of everybody in the gathering and occasionally he
also used to sing hymns and sometimes deliver a lecture.  As the State
did not give any land there was no church built there.  On enquiry I
came to know that they were worshipping their hereditary God.  When I
reported to the Father at Ranchi that on enquiry I have found no
Christian in the village he said that they had Co-operative Society
which lends, money to the Christians only and in as much as their names
are noted in register they must be Christians.  Thereon I reported the
matter to the Resident, Col. Meek, who said that State had full rights
to take whatever steps it considers.  Thereon the State enacted the Law
entitled “Anti- Conversion Act”. The Missionaries acquired such a great
influence in the Jashpur State that even at the time of settlement the
ryots told the Settlement Officer that they would appeal to the Bishops
at Jashpur and Ranchi, the Heads of the Mission, before they cooperate
with Government work.

Coming into contact with the Missionaries I think that they can be
divided into four categories: First-Who believe in the welfare of the
people.  The second category attached more importance to creed but they
would not resort to any unfair means, for conversion.  The third
category believes that the Jesus Christ is the only Saviour and there is
no other Saviour for salvation.  The fourth category is those who want
to denationalise the people.  The majority of the Missionaries belong to
second, third and fourth categories.

The tradition of India has been to tolerate one another’s religion.  The
creed which has come from out of India insists upon the superiority of
their own creed to the exclusion of others and that creates friction. 
This in my opinion, is repugnant to the spirit of secularism. Since 1947
the Christian propaganda has been very vigorous and extensive. 
Pamphlets are being distributed.  One of the pamphlets which I came
across says that these are the days of voting, that people talk of
voting Congress and other parties but that the right way is to vote for
Christ otherwise the consequences would be as unsavoury to the Indian
people as to the Jews under Hitler that the best kingdom which the
people of India chose is the kingdom of Jesus. I file a pamphlet
“Chunao” There is another pamphlet called “Mai Japanka Kaidi tha”, where
there is a statement that it was the American soldier who liberated the
Japanese.  These pamphlets are widely distributed not only in the bazars
but in homes freely, *i.e.*, private homes.  This kind of aggressive
action is likely to provoke a violent reaction, at least to my
knowledge.  There has not been any such violence but I receive
complaints and this kind of propaganda should be stopped.  The Committee
should recommend to Government to take proper action.

If this aggressive propaganda goes on unchecked the popular excitement
may lead to breach of law and jeopardise the security of the State.

*To Mr. Deshpande.-* The psychology is engendered among the Christians
that their first allegiance is to Jesus Christ and those who accept this
message in India will naturally be estranged from the people and their
loyalty to the State and to the national leaders in the country would be
affected.

*To Mr. Tiwari of Mungeli.-* I left my office of Diwan in 1940.  I
visited Raigarh once or twice every year, and have been doing so since
1940.  As I am a pensioner of the Raigarh State I am often invited for
some social functions such as gathering in schools or by the Raja
himself or Raigarh people.  I have been living in Rajnandgaon since 1948
continuously.  I am a Hindu I use the word Jangali because Raigarh State
is divided into open tract and another is called jungle tract.  In fact
I did not use Jangali but tribal. I do not exactly remember the title of
the Act.  It is concerned with conversion.  I have got many friends
among foreign Missionaries. I know Father Famil Bulke, and many foreign
Missionaries at Raipur.  I do not exactly recall the names of the
Foreign Missionaries as I am out of touch with Raipur Missionaries.  I
lived in Jyotipur for three months, as a tenant of Christian. I was on
visiting terms with the Missionaries of Jyotipur. I know some
Missionaries in Bilaspur.  I know the Missionaries at Rajnandgaon.

I have no direct evidence of a foreign Missionary whom I know personally
having plotted against the Government.  It is my inference that they are
antinational.

*Question.-* From which pamphlet will you infer that the Missionaries
want to subvert the loyalty of the Indian people?

*Answer.-* My inference is based upon the two pamphlets and others which
have come to notice.  The whole psychology behind this work arises from
the idea of superiority complex which has the tendency of undermining
national loyalty.

I cannot say nor do I meat, that the Indian Christians as a community
are anti-national.  The Mission which I referred in Jashpur areas
regarding cutting of choti and distributing money is a Roman Catholic
Mission.  In my opinion every religion has its own saviour.  Any saviour
can save provided there is faith in him.

Assimilation of culture is good, but domination of culture is bad.

I had seen pracharaks preaching at Rajnandgaon.  Before me they did not
abuse anybody.  I am producing the writing which one Radheshyam Agarwal
sent me from Pendra Road Sanatorium who was patient there then.  I have
read the whole of it and I claim that what he has written is written
sincerely and truly to the best of my knowledge.  In my opinion it is
not proper for a Christian Missionary to go to a Hindu religious temple
to preach his religion.  There will be no difficulty if the institution
permits such preaching.  I do not know whether the Government give grant
to the T. B. Sanatorium but my impression is that the grant is given to
it because it is secular. I do not know the school described as
“Chhattisgarh Madhyamik Shala”. I cannot vouch for the truth of the
statement occurring in the statement that the Suman Khetan Hostel has
300 girls in it.  Anything that is written there is within the personal
knowledge of the writer, but I rely upon the writer whose name is
Radheshyam Agarwal.  He is my son’s friend . I know him from childhood. 
He is not of my age.  He is about 25 years.  Radheshyam was in T. B.
hospital before two or three years ago. I visited Radheshyam in
Sanatorium when he was T. B. patient.  He was living in a cottage. 
Radheshyam is a pleader.  He addressed this letter to me before two
years ago.  It was given to me to be handed over to the Enquiry
Committee.

A man had been to me who had become a Christian by some allurement.  As
a matter of fact they were two or three.  They told me that as there was
no separate arrangement for cooking, they took their food which was
cooked in the common cooking and when their relatives came to know that
they had taken food cooked by Christians they were outcasted. Then they
became Christians. I do not know whether they are still in Rajnandgaon. 
It may be two or three years ago.  It was only a casual talk and there
was no need for regular enquiry.  I do not know the present population
of Christians of Raigarh. Up to 1940 I can say definitely that they were
about 350.  In the forest areas of Raigarh there was not a single
Christian in 1940, but there were 350 in the plain.  The object of the
vigorous propaganda is anyhow to convert people.  I cannot say how many
converts there had been as a result of preaching.  I cannot say about
Rajnandgaon nor about Raigarh, nor about Pendra.  It is my opinion that
this propaganda should be stopped as I did stop it in Raigarh State. I
do not know Kartikprasad Mishra.  I know that some Kashiprasad Mishra
was M. L. A. from Dharamjaygarh. I never went for enquiry out of
Raigarh.  I am now convenor of the Mahakoshal Branch of the Bharat Sewak
Samaj.  I never tried to investigate the economic, social or other
condition of the untouchables. I have tried to know the economic and
social conditions of the aboriginals and the Harijan class from
Chhattisgarh.

*Name*-Dr. Laxman.  
*Father’s Name*-Wasudeo Paranjpe.  
*Age*-78 years.  
*Caste*-Hindu.  
*Occupation*-Private Medical Practitioner. Address-Nagpur.

I was surgeon and I have passed M. S. Examination of the Bombay State. 
I have experience of the surgical work for the last 51 years.

I am filing the written statement before the Committee.  There are three
points in it.  One that my father was pressed to become a Christian
while he was in a semi-conscious condition under the treatment of Dr.
Revi, who was our family doctor.  As he thought that my father’s
condition was severe he called Dr. Sandilands.  It was Dr. Sandilands
who put the idea, that unless my father becomes a Christian he will not
be treated.  Then my father was brought to Nagpur but he did not
survive.

The second thing is that one Ramchandra Phadke had gone wrong with a
Christian girl and was compelled to marry after having embraced
Christianity.  This occurred in 1895.  When I found him in Nagpur living
among the Christians he expressed his regret that he became Christian
and was feeling that his condition was miserable.

The third case relates to one Mr. Gore, a Brahmin Christian, who was
going to Hyderabad in search of a Brahmin Christian girl.  I met him in
the train in the same compartment going from Bombay to Manmad and I
enquired of him as to why he was in search of a Brahmin girl as he was a
Christian and not a believer of caste.  His reply was that as a Brahmin
he would not marry with any other girl of low caste because of different
culture.  From this I infer that caste system prevails among Christians.

As a surgeon it is not necessary to offer prayers in the hospital for
the efficient treatment of the patient.  I have treated Mohamedans,
Christians and I never asked anybody to say our prayers nor did I pray
loudly in their presence.  I only had in my mind.  On the contrary I
advised them to pray to their respective gods before operation.

I was working in politics for nearly 40 years. I took part in freedom
movement. Christians as a community never took part in the freedom
movement.  They were in a way hostile to the freedom movement.

*To Mr. Tiwari of Mungeli-*

I cannot say whether Mr. Gore married a Brahmin girl eventually.  It was
a casual talk during the journey.  I know the Mang and Pradhan castes. 
I have been carrying on the propaganda against untouchability since 1907
or 1908.  I have not come in direct contact with them during the last 10
years.

If a Brahmin marries with a girl belonging to the Mang or Pardhan caste,
it is his personal wish but as a rule such marriages do not become happy
because of difference in their education, culture and mode of life. 
What I mean in taking Gore’s case is that although in Christianity there
was no caste in practice there was.  Since. 1947, I cannot cite any
instance on my personal knowledge of a kind which I have stated in a
report.

*Name*-Dr. Ramdas Laxman Paranjpe.  
*Age*-47 years.  
*Caste*-Hindu.  
*Occupation*-M. B. B. S., Practitioner.  
*Address*-Nagpur.

I am M.B.B.S. of Bombay University and I have been a Medical
Practitioner for the last 19 years. I practice medicine and surgery both
and I have got surgical hospital.  My hospital is on Ruikar road.  I
have got consulting rooms on Kamptee road opposite the Catholic Church. 
I have got decent practice in the Christian community. I have got great
regard for Christian community and Jesus Christ.  But I find that the
Christian Missionary Activities regarding conversion are dynamic under
the breach of peace and harmony and a happy life of Christians on one
side and the rest particularly of Hindus on the other.  Their activities
are such as to excite suspicion of Hindus that they are trying to
increase in number and they have political motive behind it.  I am
elaborating my idea of political motive.  In my opinion the present
policy of conversion is in continuation of the policy of British
people.  The policy was to impress the people through education that the
British were superior in wealth, power and culture and that to create a
sort of inferiority complex about their own religion and culture.  Now
that the political authority of the British Government is withdrawn; the
foreign Christian Missionaries have come forward to separate the masses
of people from the Hindu community and convert them to Christianity and
attach them to some Christian centre outside India.  By Christian
Missionaries I mean foreign Missionaries.

The activity of the foreign Missionaries under the garb of social
service has increased since Independence. I regard Indian Christians as
my brothers.

An instance which I am able to place before the committee is about the
conversation with a Christian about a year in my room.  The conversation
was-

I said that conversions should be by conviction and therefore they
should try to approach people who are educated and reside in towns.  His
reply was that the American Missionary comes here as employee of the
Foreign Mission Board and as they are paid they expected to show number
of converts.  These people have no hope of getting converts among
educated people so naturally they go to aboriginal areas of Harijans. 
This talk took place in my dispensary one year ago.

Another instance that I may cite here is that of my meeting with a
American Lady Doctor at Bombay.  We both travelled from Bombay in the
month of June 1954.  She was American doctor.  On our way she told me
that she was getting down at Akola to go to Basim where she was in
charge of a Mission Hospital.  She told me that she had a. very good job
offered to her in America but she wanted to serve the poor and
downtrodden of India. I asked her whether she would accept the job in
any non-Missionary hospital to serve poor downtrodden people such as she
was serving at Basim.  She said “No”.  I asked her for the reason.  But
she kept her silence.  From this I infer that she had some motive in a
Missionary hospital in Basim.

*To Mr. Tiwari of Mungeli-*

I admit that I am influenced by foreign culture to some extent.  But I
have adopted some culture which I thought good for me but I have not
adopted Christian religion because I thought in, my religion I can get
salvation and my religion is superior.  I adopted full pant and coat. 
It is an unfortunate thing that I use English language more as it suits
me well.  I do not wish to disclose the name of my Christian friend with
whom I had a talk because I am sure that he will be persecuted by the
Christian community.

Another reason is that during the last war when the British people were
in difficulties I said to Christian friends of mine saying that there
was an opportunity for us; they said that they were under the
Missionaries and they watch our movements and that it is not possible
for Christians to join the Indians in the freedom movement.  He belongs
to Nagpur but I do not know to which Church he belongs.  If she had
accepted my offer then I would have made arrangement to offer her a job
in non-Missionary hospital.
