a 18th century shrine built by Ahalya Bai Holkar - showing a likeness of herself doing abhisheka to rudra, and a Shiv Linga is front - along with many other shrines such as ghorakālī shrine beneath are destroyed.

The Canada Annapurna was a small vigraha stolen from another shrine by an American in early 1900 from an open shrine near the ghat, like there are many. Repeat: this was not the “original” of Vishwanath temple panchayatan as popularly claimed by BJP supporters. The Shringeri Shankaracharya Swami did *not* consecrate this canada Vigraha contrary to your claim.  Yogi ji did.

Panchayatan Annapurna vigraha of Vishwanath temple was never ever “stolen” - it was “broken” by Corridor project. One that KV corridor broke in 2020 was worshipped uninterrupted since it was installed in 1700s.



Shringeri Shankaracharya installed a different Annapurna Vigraha in 2025 that his Matha got made - a different vigraha, replacing an older one consecrated earlier by his paramaguru, because the old one got desecrated by corridor (These are two different Annapurna shrines, not counting a third one on Ganga bank from where the Canada one was stolen.)
