      <description>&lt;p&gt;May 4,1992&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dear Shri Khushwant Singh,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please accept my thanks for making it known (Hindustan Times, May 2) to a large number of people that Koenraad Elst exists in flesh and blood, and is not Sita Ram Goel&amp;rsquo;s invention or disguise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Far from being &amp;ldquo;made up by BJP&amp;rsquo;s propanganda wing&amp;rdquo;. most people in the RSS/BJP crowd believed and said that it was was I trying to pass under a foreign name and a changed style. That was when I published his first book in 1990. My own son-in-law said it to my face. It was only when Koenraad stayed here in the winter of 1990-91 and met a lot of people in the RSS family of fronts, that the suspicion was shed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
