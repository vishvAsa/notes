The fact that the mahAmlechcha coalition was able to engineer what it did in TSB is hopefully being taken very seriously in Indian political circles. Obviously, they have been vigorously trying the same in the desh but have failed so far.+++(4)+++ 

The resurrection of the useless LOL-Ga[^1], kejarin, annadAtR^i-s, marUnmatta-aided CAA riots, paTTa-s and other jAti-kopa-s were all part of those attempts. While those caused local pain and dented the lATesha's plans, they did not have the ultimate outcome that they wanted. It doesn't mean they have stopped or will not succeed in the future. 

[^1]: The parallels between aTTahAsakI & LOL Ga will be missed by a discerning person. A closer study would indicate that the apparatus that is playing them is part of the same conglomerate.

The revival of TSP's attacks in kashyapa's land and now TSB are part of a perimeter strategy that the mlechCha-s have always excelled at. That was how they brought down the last H empire. The idea would be to link these marUnmatta allies to those within the desh -- first in the "Grand Trunk Belt". The foothold has already been established in residual va~Nga, which could be used to make a greater TSB as a first step.+++(4)+++ 

For the NE, their coreligionist terrorists are already in the play -- these will also serve as a toehold for them to reach China.  

With the lATesha aging and the danger of Indian democracy screwing the H nation,  
we should expect more such attempts, not less -- especially if aTTahAsakI's merry band takes power.  

We are repeating ourselves, but it is good to lay out the thoughts so that the general trajectories are clear.  
This might couple with any shocks to the world economic system that might arise due to the dreadful reign of piNDaka propagating through. 

To reiterate is a good chance the H face a major crisis after the next election, but the way things are going we may start seeing the groundwork being laid for that well before that time.
