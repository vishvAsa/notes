      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;mercinaries-in-religion&#34;&gt;MERCINARIES IN RELIGION&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Delivered in Minneapolis on November 26, 1893:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Reported in the Minneapolis Journal&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Unitarian church was crowded yesterday morning by an audience&#xA;anxious to learn something of eastern religious thought as outlined by&#xA;Swami Vivekananda, a Brahmin priest, who was prominent in the Parliament&#xA;of Religions at Chicago last summer. The distinguished representative of&#xA;the Brahmin faith was brought to Minneapolis by the Peripatetic Club,&#xA;and he addressed that body last Friday evening. He was induced to remain&#xA;until this week, in order that he might deliver the address yesterday. .&#xA;. .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>736 THE DESTINY OF MAN</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-destiny-of-man&#34;&gt;THE DESTINY OF MAN&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Delivered in Memphis on January 17, 1894:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Reported in Appeal-Avalanche&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The audience was moderately large, and was made up of the best literary&#xA;and musical talent of the city, including some of the most distinguished&#xA;members of the legal fraternity and financial institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The speaker differs in one respect in particular from some American&#xA;orators. He advances his ideas with as much deliberation as a professor&#xA;of mathematics demon strates an example in algebra to his students.&#xA;Kananda (In those days Swamiji was generally referred to by American&#xA;Press as Vive Kananda.) speaks with perfect faith in his own powers and&#xA;ability to hold successfully his position against all argument. He&#xA;advances no ideas, nor make assertions that he does not follow up to a&#xA;logical conclusion. Much of his lecture is something on the order of&#xA;Ingersoll&amp;rsquo;s philosophy. He does not believe in future punishment nor in&#xA;God as Christians believe in Him. He does not believe the mind is&#xA;immortal, from the fact that it is dependent, and nothing can be&#xA;immortal except it is independent of all things. He says: &amp;ldquo;God is not a&#xA;king sitting away in one corner of the universe to deal out punishment&#xA;or rewards according to a man&amp;rsquo;s deeds here on earth, and the time will&#xA;come when man will know the truth, and stand up and say, &amp;lsquo;I am God,&amp;rsquo; am&#xA;life of His life. Why teach that God is far away when our real nature,&#xA;our immortal principle is God?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;reincarnation&#34;&gt;REINCARNATION&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Delivered in Memphis on January 19, 1894:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Reported in Appeal-Avalanche&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Swami Vive Kananda, the beturbaned and yellow-robed monk, lectured again&#xA;last night to a fair-sized and appreciative audience at the La Salette&#xA;Academy on Third street.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The subject was &amp;ldquo;Transmigration of the Soul, or &amp;ldquo;metempsychosis&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;Possibly Vive Kananda never appeared to greater advantage than in this&#xA;role, so to speak. Metempsychosis is one of the most widely-accepted&#xA;beliefs among the Eastern races, and one that they are ever ready to&#xA;defend, at home or abroad. As Kananda said:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>738 COMPARATIVE THEOLOGY</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;comparative-theology&#34;&gt;COMPARATIVE THEOLOGY&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Delivered in Memphis on January 21, 1894:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Reported in Appeal-Avalanche&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Comparative Theology&amp;rdquo; was the subject of a discourse last night by&#xA;Swami Vive Kananda at the Young Men&amp;rsquo;s Hebrew Association Hall. It was&#xA;the blue-ribbon lecture of the series, and no doubt increased the&#xA;general admiration the people of this city entertain for the learned&#xA;gentleman.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Heretofore Vive Kananda has lectured for the benefit of one&#xA;charity-worthy object or another, and it can be safely said that he has&#xA;rendered them material aid. Last night, however, he lectured for his own&#xA;benefit. The lecture was planned and sustained by Mr. Hu L. Brinkley,&#xA;one of Vive Kananda&amp;rsquo;s warmest friends and most ardent admirers. In the&#xA;neighbourhood of two hundred gathered at the hall last night to hear the&#xA;eminent Easterner for the last time in this city.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Dickinson introduced&#xA;him to the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Who shall say that this system of religion is divine and that doomed?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;asked Mr. Dickinson in his introductory remarks. &amp;ldquo;Who shall draw the&#xA;mystic line?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-science-of-yoga&#34;&gt;THE SCIENCE OF YOGA&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Fragmentary notes of a lecture recorded by Ida Ansell and reprinted&#xA;from &lt;em&gt;Vedanta and the West&lt;/em&gt;, July-August 1957.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Delivered at Tucker Hall, Alameda, California, on April 13, 1900&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The old Sanskrit word Yoga is defined as [Chittavrittinirodha]. It&#xA;means that Yoga is the science that teaches us to bring the Chitta under&#xA;control from the state of change. The Chitta is the stuff from which our&#xA;minds are made and which is being constantly churned into waves by&#xA;external and internal influences. Yoga teaches us how to control the&#xA;mind so that it is not thrown out of balance into wave forms. . . .&lt;/p&gt;</description>
