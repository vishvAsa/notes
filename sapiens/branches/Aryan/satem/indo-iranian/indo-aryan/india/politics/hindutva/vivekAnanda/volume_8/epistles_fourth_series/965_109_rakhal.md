## CIX

(*Translated from [Bengali](b7372e8109.pdf)* )

*To Swami Brahmananda*

SRINAGAR, KASHMIR,  
*30th September, 1897*

DEAR RAKHAL,

I understand from a letter of Gopal Dada that you have seen that piece
of land at Konnagar. It seems that that site is rent-free and measures
16 bighas (about 5 acres), and that the price is below eight or ten
thousand rupees. Do what you think best after considering the
healthiness and other factors. In a day or two I shall leave for the
Punjab. So don't write any more letters to me at this address. I shall
telegraph to you my next address. Don't forget to send Hariprasanna.
Tell Gopal Dada thus: "Your health will soon be all right â€” winter is
coming, what fear? Eat well and be merry." Write a letter to Mrs. C.
Sevier at Spring Dale, Murree, as to Yogen's present state of health,
marking on the cover "to await arrival". Give my love and blessings to
all. 

Yours affectionately,

VIVEKANANDA.

  
PS. The Maharaja of Khetri reaches Bombay on the 10th October. Don't
forget to give him an address of welcome.
