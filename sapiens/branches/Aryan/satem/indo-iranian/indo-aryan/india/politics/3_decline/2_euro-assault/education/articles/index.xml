      <description>&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Rahul Sagar Intro (द्रष्टुं नोद्यम्)&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This report was by W. B. Addis, a shoemaker turned missionary schoolmaster, who managed the influential Nagercoil Seminary in 1827-30&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am grateful to Nidhi Shukla for helping me with the transcription. In spite of our best efforts, there are a few words that are no longer legible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It now becomes clear that A. D. Campbell&amp;rsquo;s 1834 prominent &amp;ldquo;On The State of Education of the Natives in Southern India&amp;rdquo;, which is generally considered the earliest English account we have of &amp;ldquo;native schools&amp;rdquo; in the South, was actually based on Addis&amp;rsquo; report on Travancore..&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;विस्तारः (द्रष्टुं नोद्यम्)&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1824 survey on schools run by Indians in Dharwar and nearby talukas, taken over from Bajirao II.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;270 village schools with ~4000 students.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/details&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Darwar, 2nd August, 1824.&#xA;(Sd.) J. A. R. Stevenson.&#xA;EDUCATION&#xA;Sir.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have the honor to transmit my report on the subject of village schools. The returns received from the Talooks composing the prin- cipal division give schools 150, tutors 171, and pupils 2,348; those from the late sub-collectorate south of the Beema give schools 86, and pupils 1,049, and those from the three Talooks of Ranebednoor give schools 34, tutors 34, and scholars 531, making an aggregate of schools 270, tutors 291 and pupils 3,845.&#xA;2. Of the schools, 146 are Mahratta, 112 Canarese,-7 both Mahratta and Canarese, and 5 were in Persian and Hindoostanee-of the tutors 138 are Brahmins, 139 Linguaits, 5 Hindoos of different caste and 9 Mussalmans; of the pupils 943 are Brahmins, 2.092 Linguaits, 609 Hindoos of different caste and 118 Mussalmans.&#xA;3. With respect to the nature of the instruction&amp;hellip;and the at- tainment of the pupils, in the principal division these returns give pupils 1,319 as the number being taught &amp;ldquo;dowlaecharum,&amp;rdquo; that is, writing in sand on the ground or on boards; reading, writing and simple arithmetic 871; reading the Jayamony Amakosh, Veedoor-neeter, etc., 50; and Persian books such as Kareema, etc., 57.&#xA;4. In the sub-collectorate,&amp;hellip; little else is taught beyond the ele- ments of reading, writing and arithmetic, and there is but one school in which the Jayamony is being read, and that is in the Hoongoond&#xA;Talook.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;विस्तारः (द्रष्टुं नोद्यम्)&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 1842 there were 50 females schools in Calcutta. Raja Radha Kanta Dev gave detailed account of these. He mentioned Rani Bhavani, Hati Vidyalankar &amp;amp; Syamasundari (latter 2 being Sanskrit scholars).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ref.: Isvar Chandra Vidyasagar, a story of his life and work (published 1902).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/details&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;gave great pleasure.&amp;quot; In 1842, there were fifty female schools in the different parts of Calcutta with nearly 800 pupils on their rolls. A detailed account of these schools is to be found in Raja Radha Kanta Dev&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Stri Siksha Vidhayaka,&amp;rdquo; a manuscript paper in Bengali, which he offered to the Female Society. In this essay, he attempted to show, that female education had been customary with the Hindus from a long time, and that even recently many Hindu females of higher classes had won much celebrity for their attainments and accomplishments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There were two camps who opposed his &amp;ldquo;minute&amp;rdquo; on education -&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Orientalists - led by HT Prinsep, HH Wilson, Lancelot Wilkinson&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Vernacularists - led by Brian Hodgson, William Adam&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The strawman that is erected is that Indians would&amp;rsquo;ve been deprived of  &amp;ldquo;Enlightenment&amp;rdquo; advancements in Europe but for Macaulay.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
