      <description>&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Rahul Sagar Intro (द्रष्टुं नोद्यम्)&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This report was by W. B. Addis, a shoemaker turned missionary schoolmaster, who managed the influential Nagercoil Seminary in 1827-30&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am grateful to Nidhi Shukla for helping me with the transcription. In spite of our best efforts, there are a few words that are no longer legible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It now becomes clear that A. D. Campbell&amp;rsquo;s 1834 prominent &amp;ldquo;On The State of Education of the Natives in Southern India&amp;rdquo;, which is generally considered the earliest English account we have of &amp;ldquo;native schools&amp;rdquo; in the South, was actually based on Addis&amp;rsquo; report on Travancore..&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;विस्तारः (द्रष्टुं नोद्यम्)&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 1842 there were 50 females schools in Calcutta. Raja Radha Kanta Dev gave detailed account of these. He mentioned Rani Bhavani, Hati Vidyalankar &amp;amp; Syamasundari (latter 2 being Sanskrit scholars).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ref.: Isvar Chandra Vidyasagar, a story of his life and work (published 1902).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/details&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;gave great pleasure.&amp;quot; In 1842, there were fifty female schools in the different parts of Calcutta with nearly 800 pupils on their rolls. A detailed account of these schools is to be found in Raja Radha Kanta Dev&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Stri Siksha Vidhayaka,&amp;rdquo; a manuscript paper in Bengali, which he offered to the Female Society. In this essay, he attempted to show, that female education had been customary with the Hindus from a long time, and that even recently many Hindu females of higher classes had won much celebrity for their attainments and accomplishments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
