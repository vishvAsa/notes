RAIGARH
(28-7-1955)
No. 1
Name-Shankardatta Shastri.
Father’s name-Rambadan Misra
Caste-Brahmin.
Age-45 years.
Address-Dharamjaigarh.
I am the Rajpurohit of the Dharamjaigarh Raj. For services rendered to the Raj family, our family was granted two villages Mafi named Amli Digra and Sarasmar (Lakshmipur). These villages were originally inhabited by Uraons and other Adivasis. Till 1939, there was no Christian in these villages.
One Bulchu Uraon had taken up residence in our village from Mangarpur. He wanted financial help to put up an embankment in a neighbouring village, but I objected and asked him to have an embankment in the village in which he resided. He, therefore, left the village and took up residence at Ludeg. He complained to the foreign Missionary Padri at Ludeg and one day the Padri came to our village and asked me why I was troubling Bulchu and others by not allowing them money for putting up an embankment. He also said that he would advance loan and help Uraons for the embankment. The Padri was a foreigner and had a beard. I do not know his name. Money was advanced to Bulchu in consequence of which he and his family were made Christians. I know that he had been made a Christian because of the loan advanced to him as it has become an open secret in the area that foreign Missionaries make converts by advancing such loans. After Bulchu’s conversion, foreign Missionaries started visiting our village regularly. After some time it was widely circulated that Christians were not troubled by ghosts, etc. As a result of their efforts almost the entire village of Lakshmipur (Saras) was converted to Christianity. At that time the then Ruler of Dharamjaigarh was a minor and the Estate was under superintendence. When the Ruler assumed Gaddi, I complained to him about the manner in which the whole village and other villages had been converted I do not know whether any enquiry was made but after some time an Act was passed which prevented change of faith induced by force, fraud, promises, etc. This Act was widely notified and entries in the Wajib-ul-urj was made.">

  <p><em>Statements’ made before the Christian Missionary Activities Enquiry
Committee.</em></p>
<p>RAIGARH</p>
<p>(28-7-1955)</p>
<p><strong>No. 1</strong></p>
<p><em>Name</em>-Shankardatta Shastri.<br>
<em>Father’s name</em>-Rambadan Misra<br>
<em>Caste</em>-Brahmin.<br>
<em>Age</em>-45 years.<br>
<em>Address</em>-Dharamjaigarh.</p>
<p>I am the Rajpurohit of the Dharamjaigarh Raj.  For services rendered to
the Raj family, our family was granted two villages Mafi named Amli
Digra and Sarasmar (Lakshmipur).  These villages were originally
inhabited by Uraons and other Adivasis.  Till 1939, there was no
Christian in these villages.</p>
<p>One Bulchu Uraon had taken up residence in our village from Mangarpur.
He wanted financial help to put up an embankment in a neighbouring
village, but I objected and asked him to have an embankment in the
village in which he resided.  He, therefore, left the village and took
up residence at Ludeg.  He complained to the foreign Missionary Padri at
Ludeg and one day the Padri came to our village and asked me why I was
troubling Bulchu and others by not allowing them money for putting up an
embankment.  He also said that he would advance loan and help Uraons for
the embankment.  The Padri was a foreigner and had a beard. I do not
know his name.  Money was advanced to Bulchu in consequence of which he
and his family were made Christians.  I know that he had been made a
Christian because of the loan advanced to him as it has become an open
secret in the area that foreign Missionaries make converts by advancing
such loans.  After Bulchu’s conversion, foreign Missionaries started
visiting our village regularly.  After some time it was widely
circulated that Christians were not troubled by ghosts, etc.  As a
result of their efforts almost the entire village of Lakshmipur (Saras)
was converted to Christianity.  At that time the then Ruler of
Dharamjaigarh was a minor and the Estate was under superintendence.
When the Ruler assumed Gaddi, I complained to him about the manner in
which the whole village and other villages had been converted I do not
know whether any enquiry was made but after some time an Act was passed
which prevented change of faith induced by force, fraud, promises, etc.
This Act was widely notified and entries in the Wajib-ul-urj was made.</p>
<p>Although I had no occasion personally to hear a foreign Missionary
preaching, I have several times heard the preachings of Indian
Missionary.  They say that the rule of foreigner would again be spread
in India and, therefore, people should not be afraid of becoming
Christians. I too worship Hindu Gods and Goddesses and pamphlets
containing contemptuous references to Hindu beliefs and religion, are
widely circulated.  I have seen foreign Missionaries, their families as
well as Indian Missionaries distributing such leaflets in fairs, etc.</p>
<p><em>To Mr. A. B. Shinde.-</em> Bulchu was not given any money by the
Missionaries in my presence.  It is my inference because he was
demanding money from me.  I was not present at the time of Bulchu’s
conversion but I know he and his family had become Christians, and had
seen them living like a Christian.  After Bulchu and because of him
others also became Christians.  They were all Uraons.  Although I did
not know the exact amount advanced to each, I know certain that all the
people who were converted had been given money.  I have knowledge that
these Missionaries advanced loans to Uraons and when they are not in a
position to repay on account of mounting heavy interest they are asked
to become Christians and told that the amount would not be recovered.
They thus become Christians.  They hide the facts.  When I asked some of
the converts whether they receive the monetary help they would continue
and reply in the negative.  “Sadgurukhoj” besides “Chandra kalasadhuni
Wrutant” are some of the pamphlets which are distributed. I have some in
my possession but have not brought here today.</p>
<p><strong>No. 2</strong></p>
<p><em>Name</em>-Dharamdeo Tripathi.<br>
<em>Father’s name</em>-Ramaotar Tripathi,<br>
<em>Address</em>-Sureshpur.<br>
<em>Age</em>-42 years.</p>
<p>I work as a Purohit for about 35 villages around Pathalgaon.  I am a
cultivator also.  In course of my visits to villages people had come and
told me about the activities of Christians and Christian Missionaries. I
had been told by them that they became Christians because they had
borrowed money from the Missionaries which they could not repay.  Others
had told me that it is being preached that foreign rule would again be
established in India.  At village Baniagaon and certain other villages,
a big gathering of foreign and Indian Missionaries was held in course of
which a red liquid was circulated amongst the audience of Uraons who
tasted it.  According to Uraon customs, food prepared by non-Uraons is
not permitted.</p>
<p>I have also beard prayers held in Churches.  Although I have not gone
inside.  I have heard prayers, etc., from near distance.  Shouts of
“Jharkhand ki Jai” are uttered along with “Prabhu ki jai”, and pamphlets
advocating Jharkhand are also distributed, I have beard this in various
churches 5 to 7 times last year. I beard this in the churches of
Pathalgaon, Baniagaon.  Ludeg and Mahadeodang.  I cannot name the
Mission to which these churches belong.</p>
<p><em>To Mr. A. B. Shinde.-</em> They say that “this is Hindu raj and if we get
majority, our own raj will rule”. “Jharkhand ki jai” is uttered inside
churches and also outside when meetings are held. I am in possession of
pamphlets about Jharkhand.  They were distributed by the Christians.
All Christians support the demand for Jharkhand. I have not brought them
with me but I can produce them.  Their propaganda is chat this is Hindu
Raj and they would like to have an independent state of Christian Uraons
and they go on instigating the Christian Uraons also. I have myself
heard foreign Missionaries also making propaganda for Jharkhand in this
manner. I did not give any counter-lecture.</p>
<p><strong>No. 3.</strong></p>
<p><em>Name</em>-Hisamuddin Siddiqui.<br>
<em>Father’s name</em>-Taj Muhammad.<br>
<em>Address</em>-Ludeg.</p>
<p>I am Chairman.  Hindu Scheduled Caste and Tribes Welfare Organization;
this institution has been started only recently but I am doing social
work for the last twenty years or so.  In the year 1933-34, grain prices
had gone down considerably and people had become very poor; land revenue
had to be recovered by force.  Taking advantage of this situation,
Father Galaghar, a foreign Missionary, belonging to the Roman Catholic
Mission of Tapkara, sent word to all people in the former State of
Udaipur that those who wanted money could borrow the same from the
Mission authorities.  As a result of this widespread offer, several
persons of Udaipur State went to Tapkara in the hope of getting monetary
assistance.  Seventy or eighty persons of village Ludeg had gone for the
loans: on return, they informed me that they were given varying loans on
condition that they would become Christians.  The people who went were
mostly Uraons although some of other community had also gone; those who
had been given loans were asked to remove their <em>Choti</em>.  I had heard of
the experience of Christian converts in Jashpur State and, therefore,
felt alarmed at this widespread conversions of Uraons on promise of
loans. etc. I, therefore, called a gathering of elders and told them the
danger of large number of Uraons becoming Christians.  We presented an
application to Murphy, I.C.S., who was then the Political Agent stating
that conversions were being purchased.  Murphy visited Ludeg and
conducted an enquiry.  Nearly six or seven persons deposed before him
that they got money from the Missionaries and so became Christians and
there were some who said that because they did not agree to become
Christians they were not given loans.  Murphy was also a Roman Catholic
and the Mission at Tapkara which had organised this was also a Roman
Catholic Mission.  When Murphy was convinced of the truth of our
allegations, Father Galaghar was transferred to some other Mission.
Activities of that Mission were prohibited in Dharamjaigarh State.  It
was also ordered that foreign Missionaries would not enter the State
without permission of the Government and would not stay for more than 48
hours.  After these orders were passed, the Christian authorities were
ready to open the schools, etc., in villages situated on the border of
Udaipur State but within the Jashpur State territory.  Those persons of
Udaipur State who had borrowed loans from the foreign Missionaries at
Tapkara sent their children to such schools.  Missionaries continued to
visit villages in Udaipur State after permission to take part in the
funeral ceremony, etc., and those occasions they did propaganda and
advanced loans.  They also used to attend patients who were seriously
ill.</p>
<p>When the Udaipur State was merged with Madhya Pradesh, Rev. Tigga of
Jashpur entered Udaipur and remained there in defiance of the previous
orders.  As the previous orders had not been cancelled, Rev. Tigga was
arrested and was in confinement for seven days.  When the previous Act
and Orders passed were repealed, the activities of Missionaries were
expanded.  A bungalow constructed in Ludeg, distribution of milk
prepared out of imported powder was started and money-lending
continued.  The old methods of preaching and making converts were
continued.  As a result thereof there was a large number of conversions
soon after integration, although in the last two years, the numbers have
gone down.  Foreign Missionaries of the Roman Catholic Mission act as
their recruiting agents for tea gardens in Andaman and Assam and also
for timber sawing in Andaman.  Some Christian families were sent and on
return after a year or so, they brought good and attractive articles and
clothes.  On seeing that their Uraon relatives naturally enquired of
them how they could obtain those articles and were told to become
Christians.  They were told that unless they became Christians the
foreign Missionaries would not send them.</p>
<p>On 25-10-1954, a big procession of Christians was taken out in village
Ludeg and it was given out that a reception for the visit of the Dutch
Ambassador to Ludeg was being arranged.  The procession went to the
Church and I was also present there.  As I did not see any Government
officer present, I wanted t6 verify the information about the Ambassador
or his visit, and was told that an Ambassador of Holland had arrived.
Lectures were delivered and the foreign visitor also delivered the
lecture. The Cardinal and other foreign Missionaries also delivered
lecture.  The topic was “Jharkhand”.  The foreign Missionary said that
the Uraons should unite and demand a separate Jharkhand province as in d
the present set-up no justice was being done and they suffered from
various difficulties in recruitment in services, etc.  On behalf of
Patel of Ludeg, I have been entrusted with the job of making entries in
the village book of visitor’s statistics.  In that book names and
addresses of outside visitors have also to be entered. I sent the book
to the Missionary in charge, Ludeg Mission, with a request to enter the
names and addresses of all the visitors and return it after entering the
names of three foreigners whereas six persons had come.  I, therefore,
wrote a letter to him requesting that the names and addresses given be
also entered and details about the Dutch Ambassador whose visit-had been
publicised be entered.  On my written request, Father Cardinal endorsed
as follows:-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“These persons enjoy diplomatic immunity which is admitted by all
Governments”.</p></blockquote>
<p>This endorsement was not signed by him.  The matter was reported to the
higher authorities and I have sent the originals to them.  I file the
pamphlet as “Jharkhand Git”.</p>
<p><em>To Mr. A. B. Shinde.-</em> I do not know whether Muslims are Ahile-Kitab
(believing in the same book). I have my own cultivation and do social
work in an honorary capacity.  Islam makes no restrictions about dress.
When the Committee toured Udaipur State last year I could not appear
being ill. I have submitted a reply to the Questionnaire.</p>
<p><strong>No. 4</strong></p>
<p><em>Name</em>-Hiradhandas.<br>
<em>Father’s name</em>-Ujardandas Panka of Ludeg.</p>
<p>Last year, I constructed a house in Bade Gontiapara of Ludeg.  Formerly,
I was living in another <em>para</em>.  This new construction adjoins that of
Karlu’s, a Christian.  When I started construction he asked me not to do
so and said if I built up a house in that locality I would have to
become Christian.  I did not listen to and since then I am being
troubled in every way.  My new house is on my own land.</p>
<p>I reported the matter to the Police and a case has been started against
Padri Cardinal and six other Christians. The case is pending.</p>
<p><strong>No. 5</strong></p>
<p><em>Name</em>-Vidyadhar Khuntiya.<br>
<em>Father’s name</em>-Pitabal Khuntiya.<br>
<em>Address</em>-Ludeg.</p>
<p>During the depression of 1933-34, a foreign Missionary of Tapkara called
number of villagers of my village, advanced loans to them, cut their
<em>Chotis</em> and converted them as Christians.  After intergration Rev.
Tigga in defiance of the existing order visited Ludeg and on my report
he was prosecuted and sentenced.  When the old laws were repealed
Missionary Activities in Udaipur were expanded considerably.  The
Christian Missionaries of Ludeg carry on propaganda in favour of
Jharkhand.</p>
<p>Immediately after the merger of the States with Madhya Pradesh, the
demand for Jharkhand was intensified. I was Vice-President of the
District Congress Committee, Udaipur.  Report were given to me that 300
families of non-Christians from Jashpur area t their original villages
because of threats given b the Missionaries that on Jharkhand being
established they would either have to become Christians or lose their
property.  I was also informed that 150 such families left the Jashpur
area and settled in Udaipur and 300 from Surguja.  The result of my
enquiries was communicated to the higher authorities and official
enquiry was also made.  The Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh himself
toured that area.  At Kunkuri Camp, black flags were shown to the Chief
Minister by the Christians.  I was not present at the time.</p>
<p><strong>No. 6</strong></p>
<p><em>Name</em>-Ghunu.<br>
<em>Father’s name</em>-Pillai.<br>
<em>Caste</em>-Uraon.<br>
<em>Address</em>-Ludeg.</p>
<p>Several years ago I had borrowed Rs. 6 from a foreign Missionary of
Tapkara.  He would not give the loan, unless I got my <em>Choti</em> cut.  I
became a Christian.  I became a Christian and got Rs. 6. The next year I
repaid Rs. 12 including interest and became a Uraon again.  When I was
reconverted, Karlus, Christian teacher, Ludeg, started harassing me in
many ways.  He was always asking me to become a Christian and to send my
children to the Christian school.  When I did not agree Karlus said that
he would falsely involve me in a case and get me imprisoned.  Last year,
I was falsely implicated in a case by Karlus but fortunately I was
acquitted.  I had to incur an expenditure.</p>
<p><em>To Mr. A. B. Shinde.-</em> It was about 15 years ago that a loan of Rs. 6
was given to me.</p>

<p><em>Name</em>-Ratanram Yadao.<br>
<em>Father’s name</em>-Bhagatram Yadao Mahakut.<br>
<em>Address</em>-Illah, P.O. Pathalgaon (Udaipur).</p>
<p>In 1948 soon after the merger of the former States in Madhya Pradesh, an
agitation had been started by the Missionaries of Ranchi and Jashpur and
that Jashpur and Udaipur States should merge with Bihar.  Meetings used
to be held and I had attended one of such meetings at Jashpur.  It was
addressed by Joel Lakra and also by some foreign Missionaries of Ranchi,
Gholeng and other places.  Lakra and the foreign Missionaries told the
audience that their demand for the merger of Jashpur and Udaipur with
Bihar should be made.</p>
<p>Foreign Missionaries act as recruiting agents and I know of some
instances in which Uraons had been recruited and sent to Assam. I once
met Father D’Souza, a foreign Missionary, to request him not to send
Punaram, a relation of mine, but I was threatened and asked to go back
by the foreign Missionary.  Punaram has not yet come back from Assam.</p>
<p>I am at present Vice-President of the Tahsil Congress Committee,
Udaipur, and a Janapada member.  I visit several villages where we have
our schools.  Christians do not send their children to our schools.</p>
<p>I have in my possession today a few receipts of loan transactions and I
am filing them.</p>
<p><strong>No. 8</strong></p>
<p><em>Name</em>-Rathoram.<br>
<em>Father’s name</em>-Kesbo.<br>
<em>Address</em>-Mahakul, Kudekelagharjiya.</p>
<p>I am patel of Kudekela.  About 2 years ago the Christian Missionaries of
the village had encroached on land and constructed a church.  I reported
the matter to the Revenue authority and they were asked to dismantle
it.  The foreign Missionary of Ludeg came to my house, entered my
verandah and gave various threats to me for having reported the matter.
A few months after demolition of the church the Missionaries have again
taken possession of the land. I have informed the Revenue Inspector with
the map prepared,</p>

<em>Residence</em>-Reda.</p>
<p>About 8 or 9 years ago some members of my family had become Christian.
Although they were persuading me also to embrace Christianity, I did not
agree.  The foreign Missionary in that area always told me that if I
became a Christian I would get a literate wife and that he would appoint
me a pracharak of the area.  On account of this promise, I became
Christian and I was appointed pracharak.  Then I was married with the
Christian girl. I worked as pracharak for 2 years, and then got myself
reconverted.  After I got myself reconverted, my wife ran away from my
house.  I repaid the debt incurred by my father from the foreign
Missionary at Tapkara.  Father Bulkans and Michel Munsi and others come
to me and tell me that foreign rule will soon be established in India
and therefore I will be severely punished. I did not become a Christian
again.  Those Uraons who had become Christians as a result of my
preaching were reconverted after I became a Hindu.</p>
<p><em>To Mr. A. B. Shinde.-</em> When I was a pracharak I used to tell other
Uraons that by becoming Christians they would become better citizens,
better educated and will follow a good religion.</p>
<p><strong>No. 11</strong></p>
<p><em>Name</em>-Majhiram.<br>
<em>Father’s name</em>-Hamira.<br>
<em>Caste</em>-Uraon.<br>
<em>Residence</em>-Tilanga.</p>
<p>There are about 20 families of Christians in my village.  Foreign and
Indian Missionaries come to this village for preaching.  They tell us
that their rule will soon be established and that we will get other
advantages it we became Christians.</p>
<p><em>To Mr. A. B. Shinde.-</em> I know that the present Government is Congress
Government.</p>

<em>Residence</em>-Mudekela.</p>
<p>Last year about 10 or 15 Christians of 4 or 5 neighbouring villages came
to my village and asked me to call a meeting and to advise the people to
become Christians.  They told me that they had been sent by the
Padrisahab to tell the villagers to become Christians otherwise they
will not be allowed to remain in village.  They also threatened to
dismiss me from my office of Patel.</p>
<p><strong>No. 13</strong></p>
<p><em>Name</em>-Shrimati Raju.<br>
<em>Husband’s name</em>-Ramsairam.<br>
<em>Residence</em>-Ludeg.</p>
<p>I was one of the two wives of Rasai.  Bharatsai, my step son, had become
a Christian.  Ramsai turned him out of the house and gave him property,
as his share.  Ramsai died before 4 years.  Bharatsai took me to the
bungalow of the Padri.  He is a foreign Missionary.  The Father asked me
to get converted to Christianity but I refused.  On my return to house,
Bharatsai asked me to turn out of the house.  Then he cut away my crops
and removed.  He does so even now.  He is harassing me by ploughing my
crop.  As he does not allow me to cultivate my field, I maintain myself
by labour.</p>

<p><em>Name</em>-Soma.<br>
<em>Father’s name</em>-Goti.<br>
<em>Caste</em>-Uraon.<br>
<em>Age</em>-45.<br>
<em>Residence</em>-Sahaspur.</p>
<p>About 10 years ago I became converted to Christianity. A foreign
Missionary Padri of Tapkara told me that on my conversion my children
would be educated and that I would be happier.  I could not attend the
Church for 2 months about 4 years ago.  When I went to cultivate my
field with my brother he was attacked four Christians.  They also beat
me.  They discharged an arrow at me as a result of which I sustained an
injury on back.  My brother was in the hospital for 21 days and I for 8
days. Our assailants were prosecuted and convicted and sentenced to
imprisonment.  Then the foreign Padrisaheb had come to me to induce me
to become Christian.  Father said that it was my choice to become
Christian or not.</p>
<p><em>To Mr. Shinde.-</em> I remained as Christian for 10 years.  I was a Hindu
at the time of the assault.  I did not like to continue as Christian.</p>

<em>Age</em>-29.<br>
<em>Residence</em>-Mouza Barjore.</p>
<p>In my village there are 20 Christian families and 8 Hindu families.  I
am a Hindu when the Hindus were celebrating the festival of “Karama”,
the Christians objected to it.  They uprooted the tree round which the
people were dancing and performing <em>puja</em>.  They asked us to have the
“Karmas” performed elsewhere, i.e., somewhere outside the village.  We
tried to argue with them saying that it was our ancient custom and our
forefathers were observing it from old times.  As we did not show any
resentment there was no occasion for breach of peace.  We replanted the
uprooted branch of the tree, and danced round the tree, at the same
place.</p>
<p><em>To Mr. A. B. Shinde.-</em> The Christian residents of the village had
embraced Christianity 10 years ago.  At their instance the “Karma” was
stopped until 1954 when we resumed it and when there was a dispute.
This year we had performed the “Karma” at the same place.</p>
<p><strong>No. 16</strong></p>
<p><em>Name</em>-Budhu.<br>
<em>Father’s name</em>-Lohra.<br>
<em>Age</em>-45.<br>
<em>Residence</em>-Tilanga.</p>
<p>About 15 or 16 years ago a foreign Padri had come to my village and
induced my father to go to Tapkara.  He got converted to Christianity
there and brought Rs. 12 from the Missionary.  After my father’s death
which was about 6 years later I returned the amount.  My father had
repaid Rs. 6 and a balance of Rs. 6 left but I had to pay to Rs. 12.  My
deceased brother’s daughter was living with me and I was supporting
her.  My brother and his wife were Christians. I arranged the marriage
of my brother’s daughter with a Hindu boy.  Hearing this, foreign
Missionary and pracharaks came and scolded me asking me not to give the
girl to a Hindu.  She could only be given to Christian.  The girl was
married to a Hindu and I was inflicted a penalty of Rs. 40 by the
Christians. I could not pay the amount so they removed my bullocks.
They also demanded their panchayat fees and in lieu of that they removed
two of my goats.</p>

<p><em>Name</em>-Dhupsahai.<br>
<em>Father’s name</em>-Gunda.<br>
<em>Caste</em>-Uraon.<br>
<em>Residence</em>-Redegaon.</p>
<p>About 10 years ago the foreign Missionary and his Munshi came to my
village and said that those who are in need of money may take money from
him.  My father took a loan of Rs. 100 from the Missionary.  The
Missionary went away and returned after a month and a half and demanded
back his money from my father.  My father said he could not repay it, as
he was poor.  Then the Missionary said that he must pay otherwise he
should become a Christian.  My father subsequently became a Christian as
he could not pay.  He also asked me from my father and took me away. I
was taught in the school and remained a Christian for sometime, then
subsequently I left the Christianity and became a Hindu.  As I and my
father became Hindus, the Missionary demanded back his money.  We paid
him Rs. 118.  He also demanded expenses of my education.  We have not
paid that.  In 1952, there was an Election.  The Missionary wanted that
I should vote for the Praia Party.  When I declined to do so, he
threatened me that he would recover the amount that was spent on my
education and threatened.</p>
<p>A Christian boy came to my village and wanted to marry a Hindu girl.  We
said that you are a Christian and how can we give our girl to a
christian.  He went away.  After some time he came again and said that
he had become Hindu.  Believing, we gave him a girl in marriage.
Subsequently after marriage it was discovered that he was a Christian.
We had also taken in writing from him that he had become Hindu.</p>

<p><em>Name</em>-Punaram.<br>

<em>Caste</em>-Uraon.<br>
<em>Residence</em>-Balajhardeopur.</p>
<p>I had received a written message from our leader, Ranchi, for the
purpose of conveying this message to the neighbouring Uraons in 1952.  I
took it and went to some villages and informed them.  In that were
written that we should do some things &lsquo;and should not do certain
others.  That we were not Christians, and should not follow this
religion.  On that, certain Missionaries began to tell me why I was
doing like this.  You are criticising our religion you will be seen when
we have our Raj in Jharkhand and you will be sent to Kalapani.</p>

<p><strong>No. 19</strong></p>
<p><em>Name</em>-Shri Kashiprasad Misra.<br>
<em>Father’s name</em>-Matadin Misra. <br>
<em>Caste</em>-Brahmin.<br>
<em>Age</em>-51.<br>
<em>Occupation</em>-P. W. D. Contractor.  Dharamjaygarh.</p>
<p>I was formerly member of the Legislative Assembly, and Chairman of the
Janpad Sabha.  Udaipur.  I am a P. W. D. contractor. I have settled in
Dharamjaygarh since 1927.  In connection with my work I am required to
tour in interior in almost important villages of the Udaipur
Sub-Division.  Formerly, Missionaries were not allowed to make converts
in the Udaipur State.  Attempts were made in 1930 and in 1934-35 through
the help of local officials and foreign officers of the Political
Department but could not succeed.  In 1935-36, enquiries were made into
the activities of Missionaries by Col. Murphy and Col. Meek, Ranchi.</p>
<p>In the year 1948, soon after the integration of the Udaipur State with
Madhya Pradesh, Rev. Tigga visited Ludeg from Tapkara (Jashpur State) in
defiance of the old State Law, which was even then in force.  He was
prosecuted and convicted.</p>
<p>After the acquittal in appeal of Rev. Tigga, the foreign Missionaries of
Tapkara appointed pracharaks in almost every village of Udaipur State,
where Uraons live.  These pracharaks gave instructions to children of
Uraons and asked them not to attend schools run by the Janpad.  In my
capacity as Chairman, Janpad Sabha, several complaints of this type
reached me.  On the 26th May 1956, I, along with then Additional
District Magistrate, went to village Khamar to enquire into a similar
report.  There was a Janpad school at Khamar but the pracharak Geda
Uraon had started school in a neighbouring village Putukachar about a
mile away from Khamar.  On being asked, the pracharak said that he had
instructions from the Father of Tapkara and therefore he would not give
up his activities of not permitting Uraon children to go to the Janpad
school.  Whatever reports of this type were received by us were sent to
higher authorities with the result of enquiry.  After the merger and the
appointment of pracharaks in every village, there must have been about
3,000 converts.  The main activities in Udaipur is of the Roman Catholic
Mission of Jashpur although the Lutheran Mission also have some
activities.  Recently, the American Evangelic Mission has started work.</p>
<p>In 1948, one Julius Tigga of Ranchi had come to me to seek my
co-operation for the Jharkhand movement but I declined to co-operate.
The Mission have also appointed in each village a Kotwar to keep watch
on the activities of converts so that they may not come in contact with
other non-Christians.</p>
<p><em>To Mr. A. B. Shinde.-</em> The Kotwar works like Police Intelligence
Officer.  Pracharak gets Rs. 30 a month and Kotwar gets Rs. 17 per
mensem.  In course of my enquiry I have found that Uraons become
Christians because of promise of lands and allurement.  Most of the
Uraons in Udaipur had been advanced loans in 1934-35 and those who did
not become Christians were required to return with huge interest.  In
1953-54, people have paid Rs. 40 in return of the original loan of Rs.
6. It is not true that on becoming Christians the financial or other
conditions of the individual improve.  In most cases the promises given
are not fulfilled after conversion.  Those who are educated in the
school they become intelligent and self-conscious.  So far as I am aware
the Lutheren Mission has not distributed loans in Udaipur State.  After
1948-49 we opened about 80 new schools in Udaipur, before that we could
not do any social welfare work because it was a State regime and the
Ruler was a. minor.</p>
<p><strong>No. 20</strong></p>
<p><em>Name</em>-Chutia.<br>
<em>Father’s name</em>-Khaira.<br>
<em>Caste</em>-Uraon.<br>
<em>Residence</em>-Dharamjaygarh.</p>
<p>About 3 years ago I borrowed Rs. 6 from Tapkara Missionaries and got my
<em>choti</em> cut as a sign of embracing Christianity.  But I did not want to
be a Christian.  Then the Missionary told me that I will have to pay the
amount with interest and I had to pay Rs. 39 in the year 1954.  Now I am
a Hindu.</p>
<p><em>To Mr. A. B. Shinde.-</em> There was no formal baptism and so I had not
become a Christian.  The loan was without any writing.</p>
<p><strong>No. 21</strong></p>
<p><em>Name</em>-Bodhu Pachgi Uraon of Dharamjaygarh.</p>
<p>About 2 years ago I borrowed Rs. 7 but I was actually paid Rs. 6-2-0 and
annas 14 were deducted.  The Missionary said I won’t get the loan unless
I got my <em>choti</em> cut.  After finding that I did not continue to remain
Christian with my <em>choti</em> cut I was demanded the payment of loan with
heavy interest. I repaid Rs. 12 but that it would not satisfy the loan.
Rs. 20 are still demanded. I am filing the receipt passed by the
Missionary for Rs. 12.  In that it is written that Rs. 20 have still to
be recovered.</p>
<p>The loan had been advanced to us by the foreign Missionary Tapkara and
receipts are given by various pracharaks.</p>

<p>Last Year a foreign Missionary with some pracharaks came to my village
and asked me and my children to become Christians.  I am a widow.  I did
not agree and therefore the Missionary ordered the people to destroy my
dhan crop which was done.  There is only one family of Christian who had
taken up residence and built house on my land, and he has forcibly taken
possession thereof.</p>
<p><em>To Mr. A. B. Shinde.-</em> The Father who had come had a beard but I cannot
say what complexion he had.</p>

<p>I am a kotwar of village Kota.  My duty is to enter names of those who
visit from outside.  Foreign and Indian Missionaries visit our village
often but when I ask them their names, etc., they do not disclose.
Domandas Kotwar of Raimed has also come with me.</p>
<p><em>To Mr. A. B. Shinde.-</em> I informed the Station-house Officer of the
above incident.  I do not know whether my report was taken down by the
Station-House Officer.</p>

<em>Residence</em>-Birimdega.</p>
<p>About 3 years ago, some Missionaries including two Sisters and some
pracharaks came to my village and took up residence in my house, in my
absence.  No one had permitted them to do so.  When I returned there
assembled some persons in the house and started preaching.  They asked
me, to become a Christian, saying that Christianity was better religion
than Hindu religion, that I will be given education and will be
appointed as a pracharak.  But I refused.  Subsequently, some of them
went to the village Sarana (sacred place of worship) and cut trees.
Cutting of sacred trees is not allowed in our religion.</p>
<p>The matter was reported to the police and other authorities.  Whenever
the Sisters and other pracharaks visited our village they would say that
our sacred place has already been defiled and we should become
Christians otherwise when their rule would be established we would be
seriously punished.</p>
<p><em>To Mr. A. B. Shinde.-</em> At present there is British rule.</p>

<p>Year before last, I had been to Mission hospital at Bania.  The Padri
was inside the hospital.  The pracharak offered me Rs. 5 and said if I
become a Christian then only I would get medicine. I refused and came
away.</p>

<p>A Christian girl, who was formerly Uraon, fell in love with a Hindu
Uraon young man.  The pracharak gave beating to the boy saying why he
should marry a Christian girl.  This happened in this year.  The
assailant was prosecuted and fined.</p>
