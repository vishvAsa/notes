 as it is difficult to
carry it through. I have got another like Margaret's. Please send it
back to the Tahsildar of Vernag, Khand Chand, Esq., whom you already

happy. There is not much ice so the road is good.

Yours affectionately,  
VIVEKANANDA

P.S. Keep this Dandi till I come and pay the coolies (2) 4 Rs., 2 annas
each.
