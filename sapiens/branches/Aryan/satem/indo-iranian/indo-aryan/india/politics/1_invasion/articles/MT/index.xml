      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1619221438761934850.html&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While the Harappans TMK show no cart burials, there has much excitement in this decade about the famous Sinauli burial. We dont think it was a chariot or horse-drawn vehicle. However, it is notable as the first cart burial in the subcontinent - a solid wheel cart with design features overlapping with steppe chariots. Hence, we believe that Sinauli clinging to one end of the OCP/Cu-hoard culture was a sign of Aryan influence among late Harappans if not actual presence of Aryans in the subcontinent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1695910975566713208.html&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/guNagarbhaH/status/1695875544116793572&#34;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; seems to be the massive book form treatment of Zoller&amp;rsquo;s hypothesis. While I have not read the book, I have read his paper on the same.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Entirely independently, based on some obvious linguistic signals &amp;amp; multiple lines of philological evidence, I have always favored the idea of the Aryan invasion in multiple waves along with the initial straddling of the steppe and the subcontinental zones.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He provides a new version of the Inner-Outer IA hypothesis. Essentially he posits that only the inner lects are descendants of Vedic &amp;amp; subsequent Sanskrit while the the outer lects are descendants of distinct para-Vedic lects that had some archaisms inherited from IE&amp;gt;I-Ir that did not come into Vedic &amp;amp; its daughters.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
