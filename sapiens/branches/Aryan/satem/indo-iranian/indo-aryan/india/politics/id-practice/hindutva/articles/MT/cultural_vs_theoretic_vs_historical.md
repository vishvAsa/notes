Modern H nationalism has at least one bifurcation: 

1. A cultural one, which the lATapati emphasized to Fridman, and 
2. A genuinely theocratic one, which due to weak philosophical foundations is never satisfactorily articulated by its proponents.

In #1 there is v.little foundational theology or moorings to orthodoxy; hence, it can simultaneously accommodate the various contradictory or opposing streams that the QT mentions. It sees all of them as valid expressions of a culture that should be celebrated. bauddha or jaina can be celebrated even if they are in opposition to the sanAtana way because the cultural nationalist sees some soft power value in them. It is true they can still be vehicles of the sanAtana. A discerning race, like the Japanese, was able to see the sanAtana essence borne by the bauddha vehicle.

Ironically, #2 while more exclusive (i.e., v.insistent on red lines) and more aggressive in enforcing boundaries is similarly limited in terms of genuine theological thought or philosophy. Hence, it cannot project itself successfully to even an inside audience, let alone people with minimal familiarity. We refrain from naming some its modern flavors as its offended proponents could go off like defective fireworks on a dIpAvalI night.

We personally are more in line with system having a theocratic core for an outer *historically conscious* cultural cloak for H nationalism. However, we believe this core has to come not from (neo-)vedAnta but from a philosophical framework constructed from radical philological examination of H polytheism using the comparative Indo-European apparatus (with greater alignment with core nyAya-vaisheShika and sAMkhyA among the traditional darshana-s). That said, we realize our nation is far from ready for our formulations; hence, we limit our reconstruction of H N to grassroots private circles.
