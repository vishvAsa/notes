Writing in 1623, the Mughal emperor Jahangir, who was well acquainted with the valley owing to his own visits there, wrote that ‘the lofty temples of Kashmir which were built before the manifestation of Islam are still in existence, and are all built of stones, which from foundation to roof are large, and weigh 30 or 40 mounds, placed one on the other’.

[^28]: Persian biographies and histories in Kashmir were written in close dialogue with the valley’s pre-sultanate mythic history as recorded in Sanskrit traditions. For example, the *Dastur-i salatin*, a mixed prose and verse praise of a certain Shaikh Hamza written in 1554, drew on Sanskrit texts such as the *Nilamata Purana* and Kalhana’s *Rajatarangini*, which described the Kashmir valley as originating from a body of water through the divine intervention of the great gods Brahma and Vishnu, with the emergent land being adorned by goddesses in the shape of rivers and pilgrimage sites scattered across the landscape. While the *Dastur* did not specifically mentioned those Hindu deities, it is replete with images of the valley’s bodies of water and their resident spirits \(*jinn*s\), just as pre-Islamic Kashmiri religious beliefs had focused on a landscape littered with sacred springs associated with snake deities \(*naga*s\), to which nearby pilgrimage sites were dedicated.

[^39]: In 1423 Hoshang Shah seized the fort of Gagraun after a spectacular instance of the harrowing rite of *jauhar*. Just before the fort fell, its defenders realized their doom and the queens of the fort’s chieftain, together with thousands of other women, sacrificed their lives in a fire pit while the men sallied out in a final, desperate fight to their own deaths.

[^44]: Day, *Medieval Malwa*, pp. 213–14. 

[^45]: This mosque is commonly known as the ‘Bhojsala’, reflecting a myth that it had originally been a ‘Hall of Sanskrit Learning’ erected by the famous ruler of the Paramara dynasty, Bhoja \(r. *c*.1000–1055\). However, the earliest reference to such a hall dates to 1902. Owing partly to nineteenth-century Orientalist stereotypes about Muslim iconoclasm in India, and partly to their own spectacular ineptitude, British imperial officers came to the mistaken belief that the mosque had been King Bhoja’s Sanskrit college, complete with a shrine and statue of Saraswati, the goddess of learning. See Michael Willis, ‘Dhar, Bhoja and Sarasvati: From Indology to Political Mythology and Back’, *Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society* 22, no. 1 \(Jan. 2012\), pp. 136–49.

[^46]: Dhar also had spiritual connections with north India. At the time of the Khalaji conquest in the early fourteenth century Kamal al-Din Malawi \(d. 1330\), a Sufi shaikh of the Chishti order, migrated to Dhar and was patronized by its first governor. As a disciple of two of India’s foremost Sufi shaikhs, Farid al-Din Ganj-i Shakar \(d. 1265\) and Nizam al-Din Auwliya \(d. 1325\), he, too, represented Delhi’s hegemonic presence in the region, for in Malwa, as in other provinces, the diffusion of the sultanate’s power had been accompanied by a diaspora of Chishti Sufis. See ibid., pp. 134–5.

[^50]: In his *Ma’athir-i Mahmudshahi* \(1468\), the chronicler Shihab Hakim boasted that the sultanate’s artisans had come from north India and Khurasan, then the heartland of Timurid culture. Ibid.

[^51]: The book’s accompanying miniature paintings also reveal a hybridized Iranian and central Indian style that anticipated artistic traditions in the sixteenth-century Deccan. Norah M. Titley, *The Ni’matnama Manuscript of the Sultans of Mandu: The Sultan’s Book of Delights* \(London: Routledge, 2004\).

[^52]: The earliest known illustrated manuscript produced in India is another copy of the *Kalpa Sutra*. Dated 1411, this text was also produced in the Malwa sultanate, at Karakara, 150 kilometres north-west of Bhopal. See Milo Cleveland Beach, *Mughal and Rajput Painting.

Mathur and Rajeshwari Shah, *Fragrance in Colour: Indian Miniature Paintings from the Collection of the National Museum, New Delhi* \(New Delhi: National Museum, 2003\), pp. 17–18. The art historian Milo Beach writes that Mandu became indisputably the most active identified centre of book-painting in India until as late as the early sixteenth century. Beach, *Mughal and Rajput*, p. 120.

[^54]: In the prologue \(*praśasti*\) to this work the author writes: ‘Mahmud, the king \(*narendra*\), the destroyer of the enemy-like mass of darkness, as if with the rays of magnificent sun, who is just like the moon of the sea of Khilchi dynasty, he is victorious.’ http://www.jainworld.com/literature/jainhistory/chapter15.asp

[^55]: Often projected back to the twelfth century or even earlier, the term ‘Rajput’ has been called a ‘well-established anachronism’. Jackson, *Delhi Sultanate*, p. 9.

[^61]: Although north Indian states had regularly recruited mounted archers from beyond India, much larger numbers of infantry or auxiliaries were recruited locally, with the ratio of infantry to cavalry varying from 3:1 to as many as 6:1. See ibid., pp. 22, 51.

[^62]: The pattern persisted even into the twentieth century. During the First World War, Hindu landholders who enlisted in the British Indian Army became Sikhs merely by the act of enlisting, while those who stayed at home remained ‘Hindus’. As a British recruiting officer in the Punjab noted at that time, ‘It was an almost daily occurrence for – say – Ram Chand \[i.e. a Hindu\] to enter our office and leave it as Ram Singh – Sikh recruit.’ Ibid., p. 58.

[^65]: Bardic sources dating to fifteenth-century Gujarat depict the ‘Rajput’ in multiple guises: as valorous warriors, as men constituting the retinue of such warriors, and as any itinerant men having access to weapons. These different meanings point to the fluidity of the category itself. See Aparna Kapadia, *In Praise of Kings: Rajputs, Sultans and Poets in Fifteenth-century Gujarat* \(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2018\), p. 153.

[^67]: Importantly, works that are today designated Hindi or Urdu were formerly called Hindavi, or a variant of that word, regardless of their script or their authors’ religious identity. The choice of script for a given literary work depended entirely on the predilections of the scribe or his patron, not their presumed religious affiliation. Recent scholarship has rejected the practice of categorizing texts and authors by their supposed religious identity, seeing instead an era of a shared landscape with multilingual genres. Orsini and Sheikh \(eds\), *After Timur Left*, p. 22. As used by contemporary chroniclers in the Deccan, ‘Hindavi’ referred to neither Hindi nor Urdu, but to local vernaculars such as Marathi or Kannada.

[^69]: Aditya Behl, ed. Wendy Doniger, *Love’s Subtle Magic: An Indian Islamic Literary Tradition, 1379–1545* \(Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013\).

[^70]: The earliest text of this genre was *Chandayan*, written by Maulana Daud in 1379, followed by *Mirigavati* by Qutban \(1503\), *Padmavat* by Muhammad Jayasi \(1540\) and *Madhumalati* by Manjhan \(1545\).

[^71]: Early-twentieth-century Indian nationalists, trapped in their binary categories of Hindi/Hindu/*nagari* script versus Persian/Muslim/Arabic script, had difficulties fitting this hybridized genre into their dichotomized and polarized understanding of culture. In 1929 Ramchandra Shukla wrote a study linking language, national consciousness and history in an evolutionary scheme. But what to do with Muslims in the evolution of modern standard Hindi? The Islamic identity of *premakhyan* poetry was for him a difficulty and an embarrassment. See Behl, *Love’s Subtle Magic*, pp. 11–12.

[^72]: Maulana Daud was patronized in Awadh by a local functionary of the Tughluq dynasty, Qutban was patronized by Sultan Husain Shah Sharqi of Jaunpur after Sultan Bahlul Lodi of Delhi had driven him into exile in Bihar, and both Jayasi and Manjhan were patronized by Afghan rulers whose political bases were also in Bihar.

[^73]: Nor were Sufi poets like Jayasi the only ones composing such stories at this time. In order to bolster their claims to royal status, petty rulers or chieftains in central India, claiming Rajput status, patronized poets who wrote romance literature very similar in narrative style and substance to the *premakhyan* texts, and also in the emerging Hindavi written language.

[^85]: Referring to Rabindranath Tagore’s description of the literary output of the poet-saint Raidas, the religious historian Jack Hawley argues that the *bhakti* impulse created a ‘storm of songs’ in the mother tongues of the masses.
