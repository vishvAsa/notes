It is written in Quran that no consideration should be given to Kafirs. They can be treated as cruel as you can. It is said in the Quran. I was fed with this ideology&amp;rdquo;, Anagha said.&#xA;10 May, 2023&#xA;OpIndia Staff&#xA;kerala&#xA;Anagha Jaigopal (left) and Vishali Shetty (right).

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: Times news&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Halal has been designed in a planned way so that the products should be purchased only from Muslims and not others, he added. “When Muslims refuse to buy meat from Hindus, why should you insist on Hindus to buy from them? What right people have to even ask this,” PTI quoted Ravi as saying. When asked about the call to boycott Halal meat, the BJP leader said such trade practices are not one-way traffic but two-way. “If Muslims agree to eat non-Halal meat, then Hindus will also use Halal meat, he added. His statement comes after right-wing activists on social media urged Hindus to boycott Halal meat after Ugadi, which is the Hindu New Year festival.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But in vain. Hindus&amp;rsquo; encounter with RoP predates the Industrial Revolution by many centuries and using the lens of modernity to make sense of it is to misdiagnose the problem by unconsciously caricaturing RoP.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
