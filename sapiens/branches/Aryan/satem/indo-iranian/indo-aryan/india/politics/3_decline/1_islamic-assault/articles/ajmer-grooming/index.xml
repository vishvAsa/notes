There was a story in newspaper Dainik Navjyoti about a sex scandal that was going on in Ajmer. 1992 was the era when there was no mobile, no internet, no news channels, very few landline telephone. There were only two major newspaper in Rajasthan- Rajasthan Patrika and Dainik Navjyoti. The story was about a sex scandal that had been going in Ajmer from long time. Lot of Ajmer girls were being sexually exploited by group of people. That story was talk of town for few days but people didn&amp;rsquo;t take it more seriously and after few days matter was forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The details of the case spread through word of mouth really fast back then,” says Santosh Gupta, who broke the story in 1992.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When Suhail Ghani Chishty, wanted for 26 years in connection with the case, surrendered at a court in Ajmer on February 15, it was a reminder that the closure that the city has sought for nearly three decades is still a long way away. “It’s a case that nobody in Ajmer wants to talk about because of the nature of the crime. It’s a blot on our city’s history,” says Musabbir Hussain, joint secretary of the Anjuman Committee, which oversees the Ajmer Dargah.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This is all for real in sleepy Ajmer, the small Rajasthan town that is a holy place for both Muslims and Hindus because it houses the sacred dargah of Khwaja Moinuddin Chisti.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
