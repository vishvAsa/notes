THE LITERARY EVIDENCE
Islamic literary sources provide far more extensive evidence of temple destruction by the Muslim invaders of India in medieval times. They also cover a larger area, from Sinkiang and Transoxiana in the North to Tamil Nadu in the South, and from the Seistan province of present-day Iran in the West to Assam in the East. As we wade through this evidence, we can visualise how this vast area, which was for long the cradle of Hindu culture, came to be literally littered with the ruins of temples and monasteries belonging to all schools of Sanātana Dharma-Bauddha, Jaina, Śaiva, Śākta, VaishNava and the rest. Archaeological explorations and excavations in modern times have proved unmistakably that most of the mosques, mazārs, ziārats and dargāhs which were built in this area in medieval times, stood on the sites of and were made from the materials of deliberately demolished Hindu monuments.">

  <p><strong>CHAPTER SEVEN</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE LITERARY EVIDENCE</strong></p>
<p>Islamic literary sources provide far more extensive evidence of temple destruction by the Muslim invaders of India in medieval times. They also cover a larger area, from Sinkiang and Transoxiana in the North to Tamil Nadu in the South, and from the Seistan province of present-day Iran in the West to Assam in the East. As we wade through this evidence, we can visualise how this vast area, which was for long the cradle of Hindu culture, came to be literally littered with the ruins of temples and monasteries belonging to all schools of Sanātana Dharma-Bauddha, Jaina, Śaiva, Śākta, VaishNava and the rest. Archaeological explorations and excavations in modern times have proved unmistakably that most of the mosques, <em>mazārs, ziārats</em> and <em>dargāhs</em> which were built in this area in medieval times, stood on the sites of and were made from the materials of deliberately demolished Hindu monuments.</p>
<p>Hundreds of medieval Muslim historians who flourished in India and elsewhere in the world of Islam, have written detailed accounts of what their heroes did in various parts of the extensive Hindu homeland as they were invaded one after another. We have had access only to a few of these histories on account of our limitations in terms of language and resources. Most of the histories pertaining to what are known as provincial Muslim dynasties, have remained beyond our reach. One thing, however, becomes quite clear from the evidence we have been able to compile, namely, that almost all Muslim rulers destroyed or desecrated Hindu temples whenever and wherever they could. Archaeological evidence from various Muslim monuments, particularly mosques and <em>dargāhs</em>, not only confirms the literary evidence but also adds the names of some Muslim rulers whom Muslim historians have failed to credit with this pious performance.</p>
<p>We are citing the literary evidence also in a chronological order, that is, with reference to the time at which a particular work was written and not with reference to the period with which it deals. Appendix 1 Provides the names and dates of dynasties and kings described in these histories in the context of India. Most of these histories start with the creation of Adam and Eve or the rise of the Prophet of Islam, and come down to the time when the authors lived. Glorification of Islam, as its armies invaded various countries and laid them waste with slaughter and rapine, is their common theme. The writers have exhausted their imagination in describing g the holocaust that was caused everywhere and in coining names for those whom they look down upon as infidels and idolaters.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The apologists of Islam are likely to point out that quite often the instances of iconoclasm have been copied by succeeding historians from the writings of their predecessors and that this repetition should be kept in mind while assessing the extent of temple destruction. There is no substance in this argument. Firstly, there are many instances of temple destruction which are not reported in the histories but which archaeological evidence proves. Secondly, what is relevant in this context is that the historians regard some instances as significant enough to bear repetition. It is obvious that no account of some reigns was considered complete unless the concerned ruler was credited with the destruction of Hindu temples. Had it not been an important pious performance from the point of view of Islam, it is inconceivable that historians who wrote in times when the dust of war had settled down, would have cared to mention it. The repetitions are valuable from another point of view as well. In quite a few cases, succeeding historians add details which are not found in the preceding accounts. It is immaterial whether the details were missed by the earlier historians or are the products of the succeeding historians’ imagination. What matters is that the historians thought them fit for the glorification of Islam.</p>

<p><em>Beykund (Khurasan)</em></p>
<p>“The ultimate capture of Beykund (in AD 706) rewarded him with an incalculable booty; even more than had hitherto fallen into the hands of the Mahommedans by the conquest of the entire province of Khorassaun; and the unfortunate merchants of the town, having been absent on a trading excursion while their country was assailed by the enemy, and finding their habitations desolate on their return contributed further to enrich the invaders, by the ransom which they paid for the recovery of their wives and children. The ornaments alone, of which these women had been plundered, being melted down, produced, in gold, one hundred and fifty thousand meskals; of a dram and a half each. Among the articles of the booty, is also described an image of gold, of fifty thousand meskals, of which the eyes were two pearls, the exquisite beauty and magnitude of which excited the surprise and admiration of Kateibah. They were transmitted by him, with a fifth of the spoil to Hejauje, together with a request that he might be permitted to distribute, to the troops, the arms which had been found in the place in great profusion.”<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p>

The request was acceded to by Kateibah; and a treaty was the next day accordingly concluded between him and the prince of Samarkand, by which the latter engaged for the annual payment of ten millions of dirhems, and a supply of three thousand slaves; of whom it was particularly stipulated, that none should either be in a state of infancy, or ineffective from old age and debility. He further contracted that the ministers of his religion should be expelled from their temples and their idols destroyed and burnt; that Kateibah should be allowed to establish a mosque in the place of the principal temple, in which, to discharge the duties of his faith… To all this, Ghurek, with whatever reluctance, was compelled to subscribe, and he proceeded accordingly to prepare for the reception of Kateibah; who at the period agreed upon, entered Samarkand with a retinue of four hundred persons, selected from his own relatives, and the principal commanders of his army. He was met by Ghurek, with a respect bordering on adoration, and conducted to the gate of the principal temple, which he immediately entered; and after performing two rekkauts of the ritual of his faith, directed the images of pagan worship to be brought before him, for the purpose of being committed to the flames. From this some of the Turks or Tartars of Samarkand, endeavouring to dissuade him, by a declaration, that among the images, there was one, which if any person ventured to consume, that person should certainly perish; Kateibah informed them, that he should not shrink from the experiment, and accordingly set fire to the whole collection with his own hands; it was soon consumed to ashes, and fifty thousand meskals of gold and silver, collected from the nails which has been used in the workmanship of the images.”<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup></p>

<strong>Tārīkhu&rsquo;l-Hind</strong></p>
<p>“The author, Abū Rīhan Muhammad bin Ahmad al-Bīrūnī al-Khwārizmī, was born in about AD 970-71. He was an astronomer, geometrician, historian and logician. He was sent to Ghazni in an embassy from the Sultān of Khwārizm. On invitation from Sultān Mahmūd of Ghazni (AD 997-1030) he entered his service, travelled to India and spent forty years in the country, chiefly in the Punjab. He learnt Sanskrit and translated some works from that language into Arabic. His history treats of the literature and learning of the Hindus at the commencement of the eleventh century.</p>

<p><em>Multan (Punjab)</em></p>
<p>The Sun Temple at Multan has been described by early Arab geographers like Sulaimān, Mas‘ūdī, Istakhrī and Ibn Hauqal who travelled in India during the ninth and tenth centuries of the Christian era. The Arab invaders did not destroy it because besides being a rich source of revenue, it provided protection against Hindu counter-attack. “Mūltan,” wrote Mas‘ūdī, “is one of the strongest frontier places of the Musalmāns… In it is the idol also known by the name of Mūltān.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> The inhabitants of Sind and India perform pilgrimages to it from the most distant places; they carry money, precious stones, aloe wood and all sorts of perfumes there to fulfil their vows. The greatest part of the revenue of the king of Mūltān is derived from the rich presents brought to the idol… When the unbelievers<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> march against Mūltān and the faithful <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> do not feel themselves strong enough to oppose them, they threaten to break their idol, and their enemies immediately withdraw.”<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup></p>
<p>Al-Bīrūnī records: “A famous idol of theirs was that of Multan, dedicated to the sun, and therefore called <em>Aditya</em>. It was of wood and covered with red Cordovan leather; in its two eyes were two red rubies. It is said to have been made in the last <em>Kritayuga</em>… When Muhammad Ibn Alkasim Ibn Almunabih conquered Multan, he inquired how the town had become so very flourishing and so many treasures had there been accumulated, and then he found out that this idol was the cause, for there came pilgrims from all sides to visit it. Therefore he thought it best to have the idol where it was, but he hung a piece of cow’s flesh on its neck by way of mockery. On the same place a mosque was built. When the Karmatians<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup> occupied Multan, Jalam Ibn Shaiban, the usurper, broke the idol into pieces and killed its priests…”<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup></p>

The translator who lived at Uccha had gone to Alor and Bhakkar in search of accounts of the Arab conquest. He met a Maulāna who had inherited a history written in Arabic by one of his ancestors.

<p>“Then all the great and principal inhabitants of the city assembled together, and silver to the weight of sixty thousand dirams was distributed and every horseman got a share of four hundred dirams weight. After this, Muhammad Kāsim said that some plan should be devised for realizing the money to be sent to the Khalīfa. He was pondering over this, when suddenly a Brahman came and said, ‘Heathenism is now at an end, the temples are thrown down, the world has received the light of Islām, and mosques are built instead of idol temples. I have heard from the elders of Multān that in ancient times there was a chief in this city whose name was Jībawīn, and who was a descendent of the Rāī of Kashmīr. He was a Brahman and a monk, he strictly followed his religion, and always occupied his time in worshipping idols. When his treasures exceeded all limits and computation, he made a reservoir on the eastern side of Multān, which was hundred yards square.  In the middle of it he built a temple fifty yards square, and he made a chamber in which he concealed forty copper jars each of which was filled with African gold dust. A treasure of three hundred and thirty <em>mans</em> of gold was buried there.

<p><em>Jānakī’s Evidence</em></p>
<p>Jānakī was one of the daughters of King Dāhir of Sindh. She was captured along with her sister and sent to the Khalīfa at Baghdad. When the Khalīfa invited Jānakī to share his bed, she lied to him that she had already been violated by Muhammad bin Qāsim. Her sister supported her statement. The Khalīfa ordered that Muhammad be sewed up in raw hide and sent to his court. Muhammad was already dead when the chest containing him arrived in Baghdad. Jānakī accused the Khalīfa of having killed one of his great generals without making proper enquiry. She said:</p>
<p>“The king has committed a very grievous mistake, for he ought not, on account of two slave girls, to have destroyed a person who had taken captive a hundred thousand modest women like us… and who instead of temples had erected mosques, pulpits and minarets…”<sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup></p>

Owing to the war, <em>‘takbir,’</em> and <em>‘shahadat’</em> was heard on every side; even the idols by their breaking affirmed the existence of God. In this ancient land of infidelity the call to prayers rose so high that it was heard in Baghdad and Madain (Ctesiphon) while the ‘Ala’ proclamation (<em>Khutba</em>) resounded in the dome of Abraham and over the water of Zamzam… The sword of Islam purified the land as the Sun purifies the earth.”<sup id="fnref:71"><a href="#fn:71" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">71</a></sup></p>

He was the grandson of an Iranian merchant who traded between Kirman in Iran and Lahore, and who became a disciple of Shykh Farīdu’d-Dīn Ganj-i-Shakar, the Sufi luminary of Ajodhan near Multan. His father was also a disciple of the same Sufi. The family travelled to Delhi after Shykh Farīd’s death and became devoted to Shykh Nizāmu’d-Dīn Auliyā‘. Mīr Khwurd was forced to migrate to Daulatabad by Sultān Muhammad bin Tughlaq but allowed to return to Delhi after some time.

<strong>Futūhāt-i-Fīrūz Shāhī</strong></p>
<p>This small history was written by Sultān Fīrūz Shāh Tughlaq (AD 1351-1388) himself. The writer of <em>Tabqāt-i-Akbarī</em>, Nizām’ud-Dīn Ahmad, a 16th century historian, says that the Sultān had got the eight chapters of his work inscribed on eight slabs of stone which were fixed on eight sides of the octagonal dome of a building near the Jāmi‘ Masjid at Fīrūzābād.</p>
<p><em>Prayers for Temple-destroyers of the Past</em></p>
<p>“The next matter which by God’s help I accomplished, was the repetition of names and titles of former sovereigns which had been omitted from the prayers of Sabbaths and Feasts. The names of those sovereigns of Islām, under whose happy fortune and favour infidel countries had been conquered, whose banners had waved over many a land, under whom
<em>idol-temples had been demolished</em>, and mosques and pulpits built and
exalted, the fragrant creed had been extended, and the people of Islām had waxen strong and warlike, the names of these men had fallen into neglect and oblivion. So I decreed that according to established custom their names and titles should be rehearsed in the khutba and aspirations offered for the remission of their sins.”<sup id="fnref:104"><a href="#fn:104" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">104</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Delhi and Environs</em></p>
<p>“The Hindus and idol-worshippers had agreed to pay the money for toleration (<em>zar-i zimmiya</em>) and had consented to the poll-tax (<em>jizya</em>) in return for which they and their families enjoyed security. These people now erected new idol-temples in the city and the environs in opposition to the Law of the Prophet which declares that such temples are not to be tolerated. Under divine guidance I destroyed these edifices and I killed those leaders of infidelity who seduced others into error, and the lower orders I subjected to stripes and chastisement, until this abuse was entirely abolished. The following is an instance:- In the village of Malūh<sup id="fnref:105"><a href="#fn:105" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">105</a></sup> there is a tank which they call <em>kund</em> (tank). Here they had built idol-temples and on certain days the Hindus were accustomed to proceed thither on horseback, and wearing arms. Their women and children also went out in palankins and carts. There they assembled in thousands and performed idol-worship… When intelligence of this came to my ears my religious feelings prompted me at once to put a stop to this scandal and offence to the religion of Islām. On the day of the assembly I went there in person and I ordered that the leaders of these people and the promoters of this abomination should be put to death. I forbade the infliction of any severe punishments on Hindus in general, but I destroyed their idol-temples, and instead thereof raised mosques. I founded two flourishing towns
(<em>kasba</em>), one called Tughlikpūr, the other Sālārpūr. Where infidels and
idolaters worshipped idols, Musulmāns now, by God’s mercy, perform their devotions to the true God. Praises of God and the summons to prayer are now heard there, and that place which was formerly the home of infidels has become the habitation of the faithful, who there repeat their creed and offer up their praises to God.</p>
<p>“Information was brought to me that some Hindus had erected a new idol temple in the village of Sālihpūr, and were performing worship to their idols. I sent some persons there to destroy the idol temple, and put a stop to their pernicious incitements to error.”<sup id="fnref:106"><a href="#fn:106" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">106</a></sup></p>

I ordered that the perverse conduct of the leaders of this wickedness should be publicly proclaimed, and that they should be put to death before the gate of the palace. I also ordered that the infidel books, the idols, and the vessels used in their worship, which had been taken with them, should all be publicly burnt. The others were restrained by threats and punishments, as a warning to all men, that no zimmī could follow such wicked practices in a Musulmān country.”<sup id="fnref:107"><a href="#fn:107" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">107</a></sup></p>

They dug out other idols, which were worshipped by the polytheists in the kingdom of Jājnagar, and overthrew them as they did the image of Jagannāth, for being laid in front of the mosques along the path of the Sunnis and way of the <em>musallis</em> (the multitude who offer prayers) and stretched them in front of the portals of every mosque, so that the body and sides of the images may be trampled at the time of ascent and descent, entrance and exit, by the shoes on the feet of the Muslims.”<sup id="fnref:109"><a href="#fn:109" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">109</a></sup></p>

On that day it was the turn of the young son in the family. The Shaikh requested them to send him in place of their son but they refused to accept the offer for fear of the king. The Shaikh, then followed the young man to the temple and killed the demon with a single blow from his staff. When the king accompanied by his retinue reached the temple to worship the demon they were amazed to find the demon killed and an old man dressed in black with his head covered with a blanket.

While presenting himself as an indefatigable warrior and drug-addict he does not hide the cruelties he committed on the defeated people, particularly his fondness for building towers of the heads of those he captured as prisoners of war or killed in battle. He is very liberal in citing appropriate verses from the Qur’ān on the eve of his battle with RāNā Sāñgā. In order to ensure his victory, he makes a covenant with Allāh by breaking the vessels containing wine as also the cups for drinking it, swearing at the same time that “he would break the idols of the idol-worshippers in a similar manner.”<sup id="fnref:121"><a href="#fn:121" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">121</a></sup> In the <em>Fath-Nāma</em> (prayer for victory) composed for him by Shykh Zain, Allah is described as “destroyer of idols from their foundations.”<sup id="fnref:122"><a href="#fn:122" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">122</a></sup> The language he uses for his Hindu adversaries is typically Islamic.</p>

He was a learned man who was introduced to the court of Akbar by Shykh Mubārak, father of Abu’l Fazl and Faizī, two of the favourite courtiers of that king. He was employed by Akbar for translating Sanskrit classics into Persian, a work which he hated. He was a pious Muslim who acquired great aversion for Akbar due to the latter’s liberal policies via-a-vis the Hindus. His history, which is known as Tārīkh-i-Badāunī also, is the general history of India from the time of the Ghaznivids to the fortieth year of Akbar’s reign.</p>

<strong>Tārīkh-i-Firishta</strong></p>
<p>The author, Muhammad Qāsim Hindū Shāh Firishta, was born in Astrabad on the Caspian Sea and came to Bijapur in AD 1589. He lived under the patronage of Sultān Ibrāhīm ‘Ādil Shāh II of Bijapur where he died in 1611. He claims to have consulted most of the earlier histories in writing his <em>Gulshan-i-Ibrāhīmī</em> which became known as
<em>Tārīkh-i-Firishta</em>. He completed it in 1609. It contains sections on
the independent sultanates of the Deccan, Gujarat, Malwa, Khandesh, Bengal, Multan, Sindh and Kashmir besides narrating the history of the kings of Ghazni, Lahore, Delhi and Agra. This is the most widely read Persian history at present.</p>

<p>“Even during the fifteen years of Alptigin’s reign Subuktigin is represented by Firishta in an untranslated passage to have made frequent attacks upon India, and even to have penetrated as far as Sodra on the Chinab, where he demolished idols in celebration of Mahmud’s birth, which, as it occurred on the date of the prophet’s birth, Subuktigin was anxious that it should be illustrated by an event similar to the destruction of idols in the palace of the Persian king by an earthquake, on the day of the prophet’s birth.”<sup id="fnref:208"><a href="#fn:208" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">208</a></sup></p>

<p>“The king, in his zeal to propagate the faith, now marched against the Hindoos of Nagrakote, breaking down their idols and razing their temples. The fort, at that time denominated the Fort of Bheem, was closely invested by the Mahomedans, who had first laid waste the country around it with fire and sword.”<sup id="fnref:209"><a href="#fn:209" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">209</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Thanesar (Haryana)</em></p>
<p>“In the year AH 402 (AD 1011), Mahmood resolved on the conquest of Tahnesur, in the kingdom of Hindoostan. It had reached the ears of the king that Tahnesur was held in the same veneration by idolaters, as Mecca by the faithful; that they had there set up a number of idols, the principal of which they called Jugsom, pretending that it had existed ever since the creation. Mahmood having reached Punjab, required, according to the subsisting treaty with Anundpal, that his army should not be molested on its march through his country…”<sup id="fnref:210"><a href="#fn:210" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">210</a></sup></p>
<p>“The Raja’s brother, with two thousand horse was also sent to meet the army, and to deliver the following message:- ‘My brother is the subject and tributary of the King, but he begs permission to acquaint his Majesty, that Tahnesur is the principal place of worship of the inhabitants of the country: that if it is required by the religion of Mahmood to subvert the religion of others, he has already acquitted himself of that duty, in the destruction of the temple of Nagrakote. But if he should be pleased to alter his resolution regarding Tahnesur, Anundpal promises that the amount of the revenues of that country shall be annually paid to Mahmood; that a sum shall also be paid to reimburse him for the expense of his expedition, besides which, on his own part he will present him with fifty elephants, and jewels to a considerable amount.’ Mahmood replied, ‘The religion of the faithful inculcates the following tenet: That in proportion as the tenets of the prophet are diffused, and his followers exert themselves in the subversion of idolatry, so shall be their reward in heaven; that, therefore, it behoved him, with the assistance of God, to root out the worship of idols from the face of all India. How then should he spare Tahnesur?’</p>
<p>“This answer was communicated to the Raja of Dehly, who, resolving to oppose the invaders, sent messengers throughout Hindoostan to acquaint the other rajas that Mahmood, without provocation, was marching with a vast army to destroy Tahnesur, now under his immediate protection. He observed, that if a barrier was not expeditiously raised against this roaring torrent, the country of Hindoostan would be soon overwhelmed, and that it behoved them to unite their forces at Tahnesur, to avert the impending calamity.</p>
<p>“Mahmood having reached Tahnesur before the Hindoos had time to take measures for its defence, the city was plundered, the idols broken, and the idol Jugsom was sent to Ghizny to be trodden under foot…”<sup id="fnref:211"><a href="#fn:211" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">211</a></sup></p>

<p>“Mahmood having refreshed his troops, and understanding that at some distance stood the rich city of Mutra, consecrated to Krishn-Vasdew, whom the Hindoos venerate as an emanation of God, directed his march thither and entering it with little opposition from the troops of the Raja of Delhy, to whom it belonged, gave it up to plunder. He broke down or burned all the idols, and amassed a vast quantity of gold and silver, of which the idols were mostly composed. He would have destroyed the temples also, but he found the labour would have been excessive; while some say that he was averted from his purpose by their admirable beauty. He certainly extravagantly extolled the magnificence of the buildings and city in a letter to the governor of Ghizny, in which the following passage occurs: ‘There are here a thousand edifices as firm as the faith of the faithful; most of them of marble, besides innumerable temples; nor is it likely that this city has attained its present condition but at the expense of many millions of deenars, nor could such another be constructed under a period of two centuries.’<sup id="fnref:212"><a href="#fn:212" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">212</a></sup></p>

At length he continued his march along the course of a stream on whose banks were seven strong fortifications, all of which fell in succession: there were also discovered some very ancient temples, which, according to the Hindoos, had existed for 4000 years.

This mosque was universally known by the name of the Celestial Bride. In its neighbourhood the King founded an university, supplied with a vast collection of curious books in various languages. It contained also a museum of natural curiosities. For the maintenance of this establishment he appropriated a large sum of money, besides a sufficient fund for the maintenance of the students, and proper persons to instruct youth in the arts and sciences…<sup id="fnref:214"><a href="#fn:214" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">214</a></sup></p>

As a result of this attack Rājā Kuwar was killed. When Sultān Mahmūd learnt it, he collected a large army… and started towards Hindustān with a view to take revenge upon Rājā Nandā. As the army of Musalmāns reached the Jumnā, the son of Rājā Ānand Pāl… stood in the way of Mahmūd. The river of Jumnā was in spate at this time… and it became very difficult for the army to get across… But as chance would have it, eight royal guards of Mahmūd showed courage and crossed the river… they attacked the army of the Hindūs and dispersed it… the son of Ānand Pāl ran away with his chiefs.

In Nardein was a temple, which Ameer Ally destroyed, bringing from thence a stone on which were curious inscriptions, and which according to the Hindoos, must have been 40,000 years old…”<sup id="fnref:217"><a href="#fn:217" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">217</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Somnath (Gujarat)</em></p>
<p>“The celebrated temple of Somnat, situated in the province of Guzerat, near the island of Dew, was in those times said to abound in riches, and was greatly frequented by devotees from all parts of Hindoostan… Mahmood marched from Ghizny in the month of Shaban AH 415 (AD Sept. 1024), with his army, accompanied by 30,000 of the youths of Toorkistan and the neighbouring countries, who followed him without pay, for the purpose of attacking this temple…<sup id="fnref:218"><a href="#fn:218" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">218</a></sup></p>
<p>“Some historians affirm that the idol was brought from Mecca, where it stood before the time of the Prophet, but the Brahmins deny it, and say that it stood near the harbour of Dew since the time of Krishn, who was concealed in that place about 4000 years ago… Mahmood, taking the same precautions as before, by rapid marches reached Somnat without opposition. Here he saw a fortification on a narrow peninsula, washed on three sides by the sea, on the battlements of which appeared a vast host of people in arms… In the morning the Mahomedan troops advancing to the walls, began the assault…”<sup id="fnref:219"><a href="#fn:219" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">219</a></sup></p>
<p>“The battle raged with great fury: victory was long doubtful, till two Indian princes, Brahman Dew and Dabishleem, with other reinforcements, joined their countrymen during the action, and inspired them with fresh courage. Mahmood at this moment perceiving his troops to waver, leaped from his horse, and, prostrating himself before God implored his assistance… At the same time he cheered his troops with such energy, that, ashamed to abandon their king, with whom they had so often fought and bled, they, with one accord, gave a loud shout and rushed forwards. In this charge the Moslems broke through the enemy’s line, and laid 5,000[^220] Hindus dead at their feet… On approaching the temple, he saw a superb edifice built of hewn stone. Its lofty roof was supported by fifty-six pillars curiously carved and set with precious stones. In the centre of the hall was Somnat, a stone idol five yards in height, two of which were sunk in the ground. The King, approaching the image, raised his mace and struck off its nose. He ordered two pieces of the idol to be broken off and sent to Ghizny, that one might be thrown at the threshold of the public mosque, and the other at the court door of his own palace. These identical fragments are to this day (now 600 years ago) to be seen at Ghizny. Two more fragments were reserved to be sent to Mecca and Medina. It is a well authenticated fact, that when Mahmood was thus employed in destroying this idol, a crowd of Brahmins petitioned his attendants and offered a quantity of gold if the King would desist from further mutilation. His officers endeavoured to persuade him to accept of the money; for they said that breaking one idol would not do away with idolatry altogether; that, therefore, it could serve no purpose to destroy the image entirely; but that such a sum of money given in charity among true believers would be a meritorious act. The King acknowledged that there might be reason in what they said, but replied, that if he should consent to such a measure, his name would be handed down to posterity as ‘Mahmood the idol-seller’, whereas he was desirous of being known as ‘Mahmood the destroyer’: he therefore directed the troops to proceed in their work…[^221]</p>
<p>“The Caliph of Bagdad, being informed of the expedition of the King of Ghizny, wrote him a congratulatory letter, in which he styled him ‘The Guardian of the State, and of the Faith’; to his son, the Prince Ameer Musaood, he gave the title of ‘The Lustre of Empire, and the Ornament of Religion’; and to his second son, the Ameer Yoosoof, the appellation of ‘The Strength of the Arm of Fortune, and Establisher of Empires.’ He at the same time assured Mahmood, that to whomsoever he should bequeath the throne at his death, he himself would confirm and support the same.”[^222]</p>

<strong>Mir‘āt-i-Mas‘ūdī</strong></p>
<p>It is a biography of Sayyid Sālār Mas‘ūd Ghāzī whose tomb at Bahraich
(Uttar Pradesh) occupies the site of a Sun Temple. It was written by
Shykh ‘Abdu’r-Rahmān Chishtī in the reign of Jahangir (1605-1628). He drew his main material from <em>Tawārīkh-i-Mahmūdī</em> by Mullā Muhammad Ghaznavī, a contemporary of Sultān Mahmūd of Ghazni (AD 997-1030). Sālār Mas‘ūd, according to this account, was the son of Sitr Mu’alla’, a sister of Sultān Mahmūd, married to his general, Sālār Sāhū. Sālār Mas‘ūd was born when the couple was staying in Ajmer. He is famous among the Muslims as <em>Ghāzī Miyān, Bālā Miyān</em> (revered boy) and <em>Hathīlā</em> Pīr
(the obstinate saint). There are many stories current regarding how he
led or sent many expeditions against the Hindu <em>Kāfīrs</em> in all direction from his headquarters at Satrakh in the Barabanki District of Uttar Pradesh. He is supposed to have defeated many <em>Rājās</em>, plundered many towns, and destroyed many temples, particularly in Awadh. Many tombs all over Awadh and neighbouring areas are reputed to be the graves of his
<em>Ghāzīs</em> (veterans) who became <em>Shahīds</em> (martys) in a prolonged <em>Jihād</em>
(holy war) directed by him. He was finally caught and killed near
Bahraich by a league of Hindu <em>Rājās</em>. The Sun Temple which was his target escaped this time, but was destroyed when another wave of Islamic invasion swept over the area at the end of the twelfth century.</p>
<p><strong>Saiyyid Sālār Mas‘ūd Ghāzī (AD 1013-1033)</strong></p>
<p><em>Somnath (Gujarat)</em></p>
<p>“It happened that Mahmūd had long been planning an expedition into Bhardana, and Gujarat, to destroy the idol temple of Somnāt, a place of great sanctity to all Hindus. So as soon as he had returned to Ghaznī from his Khurasan business, he issued a <em>farmān</em> to the General of the army, ordering him to leave a confidential officer in charge of the fort of Kabuliz, and himself to join the court with his son Sālār Mas‘ud…<sup id="fnref:288"><a href="#fn:288" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">288</a></sup></p>
<p>“It is related in the <em>Tārīkh-i Mahmūdī</em> that the Sultān shortly after reached Ghaznī, and laid down the image of Somnāt at the threshold of the Mosque of Ghaznī, so that the Musulmāns might tread upon the breast of the idol on their way to and from their devotions. As soon as the unbelievers heard of this, they sent an embassy to Khwāja Hasan Maimandī, stating that the idol was of stone and useless to the Musulmāns, and offered to give twice its weight in gold as a ransom, if it might be returned to them. Khwāja Hasan Maimandī represented to the Sultān that the unbelievers had offered twice the weight of the idol in gold, and had agreed to be subject to him. He added, that the best policy would be to take the gold and restore the image, thereby attaching die people to his Government. The Sultān yielded to the advice of the Khwāja, and the unbelievers paid the gold into the treasury.</p>
<p>“One day, when the Sultān was seated on his throne, the ambassadors of the unbelievers came, and humbly petitioned thus: ‘Oh, Lord of the world! we have paid the gold to your Government in ransom, but have not yet received our purchase, the idol Somnāt.’ The Sultān was wroth at their words, and, falling into reflection, broke up the assembly and retired, with his dear Sālār Mas‘ūd, into his private apartments. He then asked his opinion as to whether the image ought to be restored, or not?  Sālār Mas‘ūd, who was perfect in goodness, said quickly, ‘In the day of the resurrection, when the Almighty shall call for Āzar, the idol-destroyer, and Mahmūd, the idol-seller, Sire! what will you say?’ This speech deeply affected the Sultān, he was full of grief, and answered, ‘I have given my word; it will be a breach of promise.’ Sālār Mas‘ūd begged him to make over the idol to him, and tell the unbelievers to get it from him. The Sultān agreed; and Sālār Mas‘ūd took it to his house, and, breaking off its nose and ears, ground them to powder.</p>
<p>“When Khwāja Hasan introduced the unbelievers, and asked the Sultān to give orders to restore the image to them, his majesty replied that Sālār Mas‘ūd had carried it off to his house, and that he might send them to get it from him. Khwāja Hasan, bowing his head, repeated these words in Arabic, ‘No easy matter is it to recover anything which has fallen into the hands of a lion.’ He then told the unbelievers that the idol was with Sālār Mas‘ūd, and that they were at liberty to go and fetch it. So they went to Mas‘ūd’s door and demanded their god.</p>
<p>“That prince commanded Malik Nekbakht to treat them courteously, and make them be seated; then to mix the dust of the nose and ears of the idol with sandal and the lime eaten with betel-nut, and present it to them. The unbelievers were delighted, and smeared themselves with sandal, and ate the betel-leaf. After a while they asked for the idol, when Sālār Mas‘ūd said he had given it to them. They inquired, with astonishment, what he meant by saying that they had received the idol? And Malik Nekbakht explained that it was mixed with the sandal and betel-lime. Some began to vomit, while others went weeping and lamenting to Khwāja Hasan Maimandī and told him what had occurred…”<sup id="fnref:289"><a href="#fn:289" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">289</a></sup></p>
<p>“Afterwards the image of Somnāt was divided into four parts, as is described in the <em>Tawārīkh-i-Mahmūdī</em>. Mahmūd’s first exploit is said to have been conquering the Hindū rebels, destroying the forts and the idol temples of the Rāī Ajipāl (Jaipāl), and subduing the country of India. His second, the expedition into Harradawa and Guzerāt, the carrying off the idol of Somnāt, and dividing it into four pieces, one of which he is reported to have placed on the threshold of the Imperial Palace, while he sent two others to Mecca and Medina respectively. Both these exploits were performed at the suggestion, and by the advice, of the General and Sālār Mas‘ūd; but India was conquered by the efforts of Sālār Mas‘ūd alone, and the idol of Somnāt was broken in pieces by his sold advice, as has been related. Sālār Sāhū was Sultān of the army and General of the forces in Iran…<sup id="fnref:290"><a href="#fn:290" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">290</a></sup></p>

<p>“…Mas‘ūd hunted through the country around Bahraich, and whenever he passed by the idol temple of Sūraj-kund, he was wont to say that he wanted that piece of ground for a dwelling-place. This Sūraj-kund was a sacred shrine of all the unbelievers of India. They had carved an image of the sun in stone on the banks of the tank there. This image they called Bālārukh, and through its fame Bahraich had attained its flourishing condition. When there was an eclipse of the sun, the unbelievers would come from east and west to worship it, and every Sunday the heathen of Bahraich and its environs, male and female, used to assemble in thousands to rub their heads under that stone, and do it reverence as an object of peculiar sanctity. Mas‘ūd was distressed at this idolatry, and often said that, with God’s will and assistance, he would destroy that mine of unbelief, and set up a chamber for the worship of the Nourisher of the Universe in its place, rooting out unbelief from those parts…<sup id="fnref:291"><a href="#fn:291" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">291</a></sup></p>

The few forces that remained to that loved one of the Lord of the Universe were ranged round him in the garden. The unbelievers, surrounding them in dense numbers, showered arrows upon them. It was then, on Sunday, the 14th of the month Rajab, in the aforesaid year 424 (14th June, 1033) as the time of evening prayer came on, that a chance arrow pierced the main artery in the arm of the Prince of the Faithful…<sup id="fnref:292"><a href="#fn:292" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">292</a></sup></p>

The Khwāja accepted this suggestion, and ordered one of his special servants called Muhammad Yādgīr to go into the city and set in good order a place for faqīrs. Muhammad Yādgīr carried out his orders, and when he had gone into the city, he liked well the place where the radiant tomb of the Khwāja now is, and which originally belonged to Shādī Dev, and he suggested that the Khwāja should favour it with his residence…<sup id="fnref:295"><a href="#fn:295" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">295</a></sup></p>

<p>“…The take-over of ‘pagan’ sites is a recurrent feature of the history of the expansion of Islam. The most obvious precedent is to be found in the Muslim annexation of the Hajar al-aswad at Mecca… Sir Thomas Arnol remarks that ‘in many instances there is no doubt that the shrine of a Muslim saint marks the site of some local cult which was practised on the spot long before the introduction of Islam.’</p>
<p>“There is evidence, more reliable than the tradition recorded in the Siyar al-Aqtāb, to suggest that this was the case in Ajmer. Sculpted stones, apparently from a Hindu temple, are incorporated in the Buland Darwāza of Mu‘īn al-dīn’s shrine. Moreover, his tomb is built over a series of cellars which may have formed part of an earlier temple… A tradition, first recorded in the ‘Anis al-Arwāh, suggests that the Sandal Khāna is built on the site of Shādī Dev’s temple.”<sup id="fnref:297"><a href="#fn:297" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">297</a></sup></p>

<p>“The infidels demolished a mosque that was under construction and wounded the artisans. When the news reached Shāh Yasīn, he came to Banaras from Mandyawa and collecting the Muslim weavers, demolished the big temple. A Sayyid who was an artisan by profession agreed with one Abdul Rasūl to build a mosque at Banaras and accordingly the foundation was laid. Near the place there was a temple and many houses belonging to it were in the occupation of the Rajputs. The infidels decided that the construction of a mosque in the locality was not proper and that it should be razed to the ground. At night the walls of the mosque were found demolished. Next day the wall was rebuilt but it was again destroyed. This happened three or four times. At last the Sayyid hid himself in a corner. With the advent of night the infidels came to achieve their nefarious purpose. When Abdul Rasūl gave the alarm, the infidels began to fight and the Sayyid was wounded by Rajputs. In the meantime, the Musalman resident of the neighbourhood arrived at the spot and the infidels took to their heels. The wounded Muslims were taken to Shāh Yasīn who determined to vindicate the cause of Islam. When he came to the mosque, people collected from the neighbourhood. The civil officers were outwardly inclined to side with the saint, but in reality they were afraid of the royal displeasure on account of the Raja, who was a courtier of the Emperor and had built the temple (near which the mosque was under construction). Shāh Yasīn, however, took up the sword and started for Jihad. The civil officers sent him a message that such a grave step should not be taken without the Emperor’s permission. Shāh Yasīn, paying no heed, sallied forth till he reached Bazar Chau Khamba through a fusillade of stones… The, doors (of temples) were forced open and the idols thrown down. The weavers and other Musalmans demolished about 500 temples. They desired to destroy the temple of Beni Madho, but as lanes were barricaded, they desisted from going further.”<sup id="fnref:336"><a href="#fn:336" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">336</a></sup></p>

<p>“Order issued on all faujdars of thanas, civil officers (mutasaddis), agents of jagirdars, kroris, and amlas from Katak to Medinipur on the frontier of Orissa:- The imperial paymaster Asad Khan has sent a letter written by order of the Emperor, to say, that the Emperor learning from the newsletters of the province of Orissa that at the village of Tilkuti in Medinipur a temple has been (newly) built, has issued his august mandate for its destruction, and the destruction of all temples built anywhere in this province by the worthless infidels. Therefore, you are commanded with extreme urgency that immediately on the receipt of this letter you should destroy the above-mentioned temples. Every idol-house built during the last 10 or 12 years, whether with brick or clay, should be demolished without delay. Also, do not allow the crushed Hindus and despicable infidels to repair their old temples.

<strong>Futūhāt-i-‘Ālamgīrī</strong></p>
<p>The author, Īshwardās Nāgar, was a Brahman from Gujarat, born around AD 1654. Till the age of thirty he as in the service of the Chief Qāzī of the empire under Aurangzeb. Later on, he took up a post under Shujā‘t Khān, the governor of Gujarat, who appointed him amīn in the pargana of Jodhpur. His history covers almost half a century of Aurangzeb’s reign, from 1657 to 1700. There is nothing in his style which may mark him out as a Hindu. He sends to “hell” every Hindu who dies at the hands of Muslims or otherwise, while every Muslim who gets killed becomes a “martyr” and attains paradise.</p>

It was the custom of the infidels to resort to this temple from far and near several times in each year to worship the idols, and a certain fee to the Government was fixed upon each man, for which he obtained admittance. As there was a large congress of pilgrims, a very considerable amount was realized from them, and paid into the royal treasury. This practice had been observed to the end of the reign of the Emperor Shāh Jahān, and in the commencement of Aurangzeb’s government; but when the latter was informed of it, he was exceedingly angry and abolished the custom. The greatest nobles of his court represented to him that a large sum was realized and paid into the public treasury, and that if it was abolished, a great reduction in the income of the state would take place. The Emperor observed, ‘What you say is right, but I have considered well on the subject, and have reflected on it deeply; but if you wish to augment the revenue, there is a better plan for attaining the object by exacting the <em>jizya</em>. By this means idolatry will be suppressed, the Muhammadan religion and the true faith will be honoured, our proper duty will be performed, the finances of the state will be increased, and the infidels will be disgraced.’ …This was highly approved by all the nobles; and the Emperor ordered all the golden and silver idols to be broken, and the temple destroyed…”<sup id="fnref:343"><a href="#fn:343" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">343</a></sup></p>

What he says instead is how the “Nawwāb” lost his temper when he learnt that the Muslims in his retinue were visiting the Hindu temples at Chidambaram and how he “gave strict orders” to British officers of the place “that no Muslim should be allowed to go over to the temple and enter it.”<sup id="fnref:370"><a href="#fn:370" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">370</a></sup> At a later stage, we are told that “the party marched forth… to the accompaniment of music provided by dancing girls of the Hindu cornmunity.”<sup id="fnref:371"><a href="#fn:371" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">371</a></sup> The account names numerous Sufis etc., who came to the districts of Chingleput, North Arcot, South Arcot, Tiruchirapalli and Thanjavur and established Muslim places of worship. What these new monuments replaced becomes obvious from the following few instances.</p>
<p><strong>Sufi Nātthar Walī</strong></p>
<p><em>Tiruchirapalli (Tamil Nadu)</em></p>
<p>“It is said that in ancient days Trichila, an execrable monster with three heads, who was a brother of Rawan, with ten heads, had the sway over this country. No human being could oppose him. But as per the saying of the Prophet, ‘Islam will be elevated and cannot be subdued’, the Faith took root by the efforts of Hazarat Natthar Wali. The monster was slain and sent to the house of perdition. His image namely but-ling worshipped by the unbelievers was cut and the head was separated from the body. A portion of the body went into the ground. Over that spot is the tomb of the Wali, shedding rediance till this day.”<sup id="fnref:372"><a href="#fn:372" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">372</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Sufi Shāh Bheka</strong></p>
<p>“Shah Bheka… when he was at Trichinopoly during the days of Rani Minachi, the unbelievers who did not like his stay there harassed him. One day when he was very much vexed, he got upon the bull in front of the temple, which the Hindus worship calling it <em>swami</em>, and made it move on by the power and strength of the Supreme Life Giver… They abandoned the temple and gave the entire place on the <em>aruskalwa</em> as present to the Shah.”<sup id="fnref:373"><a href="#fn:373" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">373</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Sufi Qāyim Shāh</strong></p>
<p>“Qayim Shah… came here from Hindustan. He was the cause for the destruction of twelve temples. He lived to an old age and passed away on the 17th Safar AH 1193.”<sup id="fnref:374"><a href="#fn:374" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">374</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Sufi Nūr Muhammad Qādirī</strong></p>
<p><em>Vellore (Tamil Nadu)</em></p>
<p>“Hazarat Nur Muhammad Qadiri was the most unique man regarded as an invaluable person of his age. Very often he was the cause of the ruin of temples. Some of these were laid waste. He selected his own burial ground in the vicinity of the temple. Although he lived five hundred years ago, people at large still remember his greatness.”<sup id="fnref:375"><a href="#fn:375" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">375</a></sup></p>

<strong>Āsāru’s-Sanādīd</strong></p>
<p>It is a book on the antiquities of Delhi written by Sayyid Ahmad Khān, the famous founder of the Aligarh Muslim University. Its first edition was published in 1847, the second in 1854, and the third in 1904. A new edition with a long introduction, footnotes, comments, bibliography, and index has been published recently. We are reproducing relevant passages from this edition.</p>
<p><em>Qutbu’d-Dīn Aibak (AD 1192-1210)</em></p>
<p><em>Iron Pillar</em>: “…In our opinion this pillar was made in the ninth
century before (the birth of) Lord Jesus… When Rāi Pithorā built a fort and an idol-house near this pillar, it stood in the courtyard of the idol-house. And when Qutbu’d-Dīn Aibak constructed a mosque after demolishing the idol-house, this pillar stood in the courtyard of the mosque…”<sup id="fnref:376"><a href="#fn:376" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">376</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Idol-house of Rāi Pithorā</em>: “There was an idol-house near the fort of
Rāi Pithorā. It was very famous… It was built along with the fort in 1200 Bikarmī [Vikrama SaMvat] corresponding to AD 1143 and AH 538. The building of this temple was very unusual, and the work done on it by stone-cutters is such that nothing better can be conceived. The beautiful carvings on every stone in it defy description… The eastern and northern portions of this idol-house have survived intact. The fact that the Iron Pillar, which belongs to the Vaishnava faith, was kept inside it, as also the fact that sculptures of Kirshan avatār and Mahādev and Ganesh and Hanumān were carved on its walls, leads us to believe that this temple belonged to the Vaishnava faith. Although all sculptures were mutilated in the times of Muslims, even so a close scrutiny can identify as to which sculpture was what.  In our opinion there was a red-stone building in this idol-house, and it was demolished. For, this sort of old stones with sculptures carved on them are still found.”<sup id="fnref:377"><a href="#fn:377" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">377</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Quwwat al-Islām Masjid</em>: “When Qutbu’d-Dīn, the commander-in-chief of
Muizzu’d-Dīn Sām alias Shihābu’d-Dīn Ghūrī, conquered Delhi in AH 587 corresponding to AD 1191 corresponding to 1248 Bikarmī, this idol-house
(of Rāi Pithorā) was converted into a mosque. The idol was taken out of
the temple.  Some of the images sculptured on walls or doors or pillars were effaced completely, some were defaced. But the structure of the idol-house kept standing as before. Materials from twenty-seven temples, which were worth five crores and forty lakhs of Dilwāls, were used in the mosque, and an inscription giving the date of conquest and his own name was installed on the eastern gate…<sup id="fnref:378"><a href="#fn:378" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">378</a></sup></p>
<p>“When Mālwāh and Ujjain were conquered by Sultān Shamsu’d-Dīn in AH 631 corresponding to AD 1233, then the idol-house of Mahākāl was demolished and its idols as well as the statue of Rājā Bikramājīt were brought to Delhi, they were strewn in front of the door of the mosque…”<sup id="fnref:379"><a href="#fn:379" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">379</a></sup></p>

<p><em><strong>Sultān Shamsu’d-Dīn Iltutmish (AD 1210-1236)</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Tomb of Sultān Ghārī</em>: Sayyid Ahmad Khān notices this tomb and
describes it as exquisite. He says that it was built in AH 626 corresponding to AD 1228 when the corpse of Sultān Nāsiru’d-Dīn Mahmūd, the eldest son of Sultān Shamsu’d-Dīn Iltutmish, who was Governor of Laknauti and who died while his father was still alive, was brought to Delhi and buried.<sup id="fnref:381"><a href="#fn:381" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">381</a></sup> But the editor, Khaleeq Anjum, comments in his introduction that “the dome of the mosque which is of marble has been re-used and has probably been obtained from some temple”, and that the domes on the four pavilions outside “are in Hindu style in their interior.”<sup id="fnref:382"><a href="#fn:382" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">382</a></sup> He provides greater details in his notes at the end of Sayyid Ahmad’s work.

<p><strong>Nasīru’d-Dīn Muhammad Humāyūn Pādshāh Ghāzī (AD 1530-1540 and 1556)</strong></p>
<p><em>Nīlī Chhatrī</em>: “At the foot of Salīm Garh and on the bank of the
Jamunā, there is a small Bārādarī near Nigambodh Ghāt… It is known as Nīlī Chhatrī because of the blue mosaic work on its dome. This Chhatrī was built by Humāyūn Bādshāh in AH 939 corresponding to AD 1533 in order to have a view of the river. Hindus ascribe this Chhatrī to the time of the PāNDūs. Even if that is not true, this much is certain that the bricks with mosaic work which have been used in this Chhatrī have been taken from some Hindu place because the bricks bear broken and mutilated images. On account of a derangement of the carvings, some have only the head left, while some others show only the torso. This derangement of carvings also goes to prove that these bricks have been placed here after being taken out from somewhere else. According to the Hindus, Rājā Judhastar had performed a Jag [Yajña] at this Ghāt. It is not inconceivable that in the Hindu era a Chhatrī had been built at some spot on this Ghāt in commemoration of the Jag, and that this Chhatrī was built in the reign of Humāyūn after demolition of that (older) Chhatrī…<sup id="fnref:388"><a href="#fn:388" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">388</a></sup></p>

<strong>Hadiqah-i-Shuhadā</strong></p>
<p>This was written in the reign of Nawāb Wājid ‘Alī Shāh of Awadh (AD 1847-1856) by Mīrza ‘Alī Jān, an eyewitness of and active participant in the <em>jihād</em> led by Amīr ‘Alī Amethawī in 1855 for recapturing the Hanumān GaRhī temple at Ayodhya. The temple had been converted into a mosque in the reign of Aurangzeb but restored when Muslim power suffered an eclipse. The work was written immediately after the failure of the
<em>jihād</em> and published in 1856.</p>
<p><strong>Zahīru’d-Dīn Muhammad Bābur Pādshāh Ghāzī (AD 1026-1030)</strong></p>
<p><em>Ayodhya (Uttar Pradesh)</em></p>
<p>“Wherever they found magnificent temples of the Hindus ever since the establishment of Sayyid Salar Mas’ud Ghazi’s rule, the Muslim rulers in India built mosques, monasteries and inns, appointed mu’azzins, teachers, and store-stewards, spread Islam vigorously and vanquished the Kafirs. Likewise, they cleared up Faizabad and Avadh, too, from the filth of reprobation (infidelity), because it was a great centre of worship and capital of Rama’s father. Where there stood the great temple
(of Ramjanmasthan), there they built a big mosque, and where there was a
small <em>mandap</em> (pavilion), there they erected a camp mosque
(<em>masjid-i-mukhtasar-i-qanati</em>). The Janmasthan temple is the principal
place of Rama’s incarnation, adjacent to which is the <em>Sita ki Rasoi</em>. Hence, what a lofty mosque was built there by king Babar in AH 923 (AD 1528) under the patronage of Musa Ashiqan! The mosque is still known far and wide as the Sita ki Rasoi mosque. And that temple is extant by its side (<em>aur pahlu mein wah dair baqi hai</em>).”<sup id="fnref:390"><a href="#fn:390" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">390</a></sup></p>

<p>“According to old records, it has been a rule with the Muslim rulers from the first to build mosques, monasteries, and inns, spread Islam, and put (a stop to) non-Islamic practices, wherever they found prominence (of <em>kufr</em>). Accordingly, even as they cleared up Mathura, Bindraban etc., from the rubbish of non-Islamic practices, the Babari mosque was built up in AH 923 (?) under the patronage of Sayyid Musa Ashiqan in the Janmasthan temple (<em>butkhane Janmsthan mein</em>) in Faizabad Avadh, which was a great place of (worship) and capital of Rama’s father…</p>
<p>“A great mosque was built on the spot where Sita ki Rasoi is situated. During the regime of Babar, the Hindus had no guts to be a match for the Muslims. The mosque was built in AH 923 (?) under the patronage of Sayyid Mir Ashiqan… Aurangzeb built a mosque on the Hanuman Garhi… The Bairagis effaced the mosque and erected a temple in its place.

<strong>Mosque Architecture of Pre-Mughal Bengal</strong></p>
<p>This is a modern work published from Dacca (Bangladesh) in 1979. The author, Dr. Syed Mahmudul Hasan, had submitted it as his Ph.D. thesis to the University of London in 1965. He has been the Head of the Post-Graduate Department of Islamic History and Culture in Jagannath University College in Decca, a member of F.R.A.S. and F.S.A. (Scot), and has served on the staff of the Department of Eastern Art in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. The book is documented from impeccable sources, literary and archaeological. It carries 43 plates with 45 photographs of monuments, and of inscriptions etc. discovered in them. We have brought together, from different pages, the passages which relate to the same subject.</p>
<p><em>General and Persistent Practice</em></p>
<p>“The Muslim invaders were necessarily impressed by Indian architecture and sculpture, expressing as they do foreign religious emotions in terms of images and emblems. What they saw at Delhi, and the other cities of India, which they attacked, was absolutely foreign to them. Yet when they came to raise their own religious buildings, they were not averse to using the spoils of their temples…<sup id="fnref:393"><a href="#fn:393" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">393</a></sup></p>
<p>“The ruthless desecration and makeshift conversion of Indian temples into Mosques has led many scholars to regard Indo-Muslim architecture as nothing more than a local variety of hybrid nature. In point of fact, these early Indian mosques which were compiled from Brahamanical fragments, such as the Deval Masjid at Bodhan near Hyderabad, have no direct bearing on the general development of Mosque architecture in India.”<sup id="fnref:394"><a href="#fn:394" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">394</a></sup></p>
<p>“On the other hand the use of the spoils of non-Muslim ruins was a widely recognised feature in early Muslim architecture…<sup id="fnref:395"><a href="#fn:395" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">395</a></sup></p>
<p>“Just as later Mughal painting is a harmonious blend of Persian and Indian artistic tradition, so the Indo-Muslim architecture of Delhi and Ajmer is a blend. In the Quwwat al-Islam at Delhi and the Arhai din-ka-Jhopra at Ajmer, existing remains bear unmistakable evidence that they were not merely compilations, but the distinctive, planned works of professional architects…<sup id="fnref:396"><a href="#fn:396" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">396</a></sup></p>
<p>“Although constructed of destroyed Hindu temples, the Mosques at Old Delhi and Ajmer once and for all set the fashion to be followed by later mosques in Muslim India…<sup id="fnref:397"><a href="#fn:397" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">397</a></sup></p>
<p>“The early formative phase of Indo-Muslim architecture, marked by the adaptation of Hindu, Buddhist or Jaina temples, is illustrated by the oldest Mosques at Delhi, Bengal, Jaunpur, Daulatabad, Patan, etc. In Malwa, also, spoils of Hindu temples were used…<sup id="fnref:398"><a href="#fn:398" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">398</a></sup></p>
<p>“Creighton says, ‘It appears to have been the general practice of the Muhammadan conquerors of India, to destroy all the temples of the idolaters, and to raise Mosque out of their ruins.’ The statement is of course a gross exaggeration, for innumerable contemporary Hindu and Buddhist temples still exist in the cities of India once conquered by the Muslims. ‘Abid ‘Ali seems to have carried the observation of Creighton further when he remarks, ‘It seems to the writer that the builder of the Mosque [Chhoto Sona Masjid at Gaud] had collected the stones containing the figure of the Hindu gods from the citadel of Gaur where temples must have existed in the time of the earlier Hindu kings.’ Incidentally, Ravenshaw gave illustrations of sculptured stones, representing stone capitals and <em>Makara</em> gargoyles, which have been discovered in Hazrat Pandua. Westmacott, however, thinks that the circular stone given in Ravenshaw’s plate XXX ‘formed a part of the high ornament or pinnacle with which both the Buddhist Stupas and later Hindu temples were usually crowned. I have seen similar pieces at Debkot, and elsewhere, often with a perforation through the centre, through which I conjecture that a rod of metal, or perhaps a column of molten lead may have been passed, to retain it in an upright position’. In the event of a prodigious abundance of Hindu temple building material scattered all over the province, it is difficult to pin-point the provenance of each stray sculptured piece used in the mosques of Gaud and Hazrat Pandua. The existence of any Hindu temple in the citadel or outside Gaud as ‘Abid ‘Ali tells us, is as difficult to prove as to obviate the fact that no material was taken from Devikot or Bannagar in Dinajpur. Contradicting the views of ‘Abid ‘Ali, Stapleton says, ‘On the other hand from Manrique’s statement that in 1641, he saw figures of idols standing in niches surrounded by carved grotesques and leaves in some stone reservoirs in Gaur, it is possible that except during periods of persecution the Muhammadan Kings of Gaur allowed idols and Hindu temples to remain unmolested in their capital.’ Although examples of the use of Hindu material are not scarce, as proved by the discovery of three sculptured figures from Mahisantosh with Muslim ornament on the reverse side, now in the Varendra Research Society Museum, it would be wrong to say after Creighton that all the Hindu temples were desecrated by the Muslims to procure building material…<sup id="fnref:399"><a href="#fn:399" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">399</a></sup></p>
<p>“…The Indian Museum, Calcutta, as well as the <em>Bangiya Sahitya Parishad</em> Museum, Calcutta, acquired a large number of architectural objects from the ancient sites of Bengal, particularly, Gaud, Hazrat Pandua, Bagerhat, Hughli, Rajshahi, Dinajpur and elsewhere. Besides freshly quarried basalts, a large quantity of locally available building materials was employed by the architects of Gaud, Hazrat Pandua and elsewhere. Ravenshaw’s unwarranted observation that ‘Though it (Hazrat Pandua) cannot boast of such antiquity as Gaud, its remains afford stronger evidence than those of the latter city of its having been constructed mainly from the materials of Hindoo buildings’, has been brushed aside by Westmacott, who thinks that Hazrat Pandua is older than Gaud. One of the strongest advocates of the Indianized form of Muslim structures is Havell, who is too intolerant to allow any credit to the Muslim builders for the use of radiating arches, domes, minarets, delicate relief works. He maintains that the central <em>mihrab</em> of the Adina Masjid (Pl. III) at Hazrat Pandua is so obviously Hindu in design as hardly to require comments. While Havell writes that ‘The image of
<em>Vishnu</em> or <em>Surya</em> has trefoil arched canopy, symbolizing the aura’ of
the god, of exactly the same type as the outer arch of the <em>mihrab</em>, Beglar says that the Muslims delighted in ‘placing the sanctum of his orthodox cult (in this case the main prayer niche) on the spot, where hated infidel had his sanctum’. Saraswati is even more emphatic on this point when he contends, ‘An examination of the stones used in the construction of the Adina Masjid (one of them bearing a Sanscrit inscription, recording merely a name of <em>Indranath</em>, in the character of the 9th century AD) and those lying about in heaps all round, reveals the fact, which no careful observer can deny, that most of them came from temples that once stood in the vicinity.’ Ilahi Bakhsh, Creighton, Ravenshaw, Buchanan-Hamilton, Westmacott, Beglar, Cunnigham, King, and a host of other historians and archaeologists bear glowing testimony to the utilization of non-muslim materials (Fig. 3b &amp; Pl. V), but none of them ventured to say that existing temples were dismantled and materials provided for the construction of magnificent monuments in Gaud and Hazrat Pandua.<sup id="fnref:400"><a href="#fn:400" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">400</a></sup></p>
<p>“Creighton drew the sketches of a few Hindu sculptures which were evidently used in the Chhoto Sona Masjid at Gaud. These are the image of
<em>Sivani</em>, the consort of <em>Siva, Varahaavatara</em> or <em>Vishnu</em> in the form
of a Boar, <em>Brahmani</em>, consort of Brahma. In the British Museum there are a few images of Hindu and Buddhist character, such as the Brahmani, sketched by Creighton, and the seated Buddha figure (Pls. XLI-XLII). The Muslim builders out of sheer expediency felt no scruple to use these fragments in their mosques by concealing the carved sides into the wall and utilizing the flat reverse side of these black basalts for arabesque design in shallow carvings. Piecemeal utilization of Hindu sculptures were also to be seen in the earlier monuments, such as, the Mosque and Tomb of Zafar Khan at Tribeni, the Mosque at Chhoto Pandua, the Adina Masjid at Hazrat Pandua, etc. The British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum, both in London, the Indian Museum and the <em>Bangiya Sahitya Parishad</em> Museum, both at Calcutta, Varendra Research Society Museum, Rajshahi, provide large specimens of carved stones and architectural fragments used in the monuments of pre-Mughal Bengal. Ravenshaw photographed a circular stone pedestal and a gargoyle, which is now in the Indian Museum, Calcutta. Used obviously as the gargoyle in the Adina Masjid, it ‘consists of a modification of an elephant’s head with the eyes, horns and ears of a <em>sardula</em> (elephant).’ Cunningham found in the pulpit of the Adina Masjid ‘a line of Hindu sculpture of very fine bold execution.’ Innumerable Hindu lintels, pillars, door-jambs, bases, capitals, friezes, fragments of stone carvings, dadoes, etc., have been utilized in such a makeshift style as to render ‘improvisation’ well-nigh impossible. In many cases as observed in the Quwwat al-Islam at Delhi and the Arhai-din-ka-Jhopra Mosque at Ajmer, pillars were inverted, joining the base with capitals, suiting neither pattern nor size. Still there is no denying the fact that Hindu materials were utilized, yet it would be far-fetched to say that existing Hindu temples were dismantled and converted by improvisation into mosques as observed in the early phase of Muslim architecture in Indo-Pak sub-continent. The ritual needs and structural properties of the Hindus and the Muslims are so diametrically opposite as to deter any compromise and, therefore, the early Muslim conquerors of Bengal said their prayer in mosques built out of the fragments of Hindu materials in the same way as their predecessors did at Delhi, Ajmer, Patan, Janupur, Dhar and Mandu, and elsewhere. In the event [absence?] of any complete picture of pre-Muslim Hindu art as practised in Gaud and Hazrat Pandua, it is an exaggeration to hold the view after Saraswati that ‘indeed, every structure of this royal city (Hazrat Pandua) discloses Hindu materials in its composition, thus, disclosing that no earlier monument was spared.”<sup id="fnref:401"><a href="#fn:401" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">401</a></sup></p>
<p>“…During the Husain Shahi period the stone cutter’s art was thoroughly practised and perfected, as walls of gates and mosques were adorned with stone, either quarried from Rajmahal hills or obtained from some existing buildings…<sup id="fnref:402"><a href="#fn:402" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">402</a></sup></p>
<p>“…The British Museum, London, has in its collection two sculptured pieces from Bengal, namely, the seated Buddha figure (Pl. XLIIa) and the image of Brahmani (Pl. XLIa). Both these images have on their obverse
(Pls. XLIb, XLIIb) exquisitely carved diaper work of unmistakable Muslim
workmanship. The Indian Museum, Calcutta, has a stone slab carved on the one side with the image of Durga, destroying <em>Mahisha</em> or Buffalow-demon, and on the reverse arabesque. The panel consisting of a scalloped arch with a lotus rosette on each of its sides, surrounded by richly foliated devices, is undoubtedly a Muslim work.<sup id="fnref:403"><a href="#fn:403" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">403</a></sup></p>
<p>“The Muslim calligraphers did not feel any scruple to utilize fragments of Hindu or Jaina sculpture in carving out beautiful inscriptions in elegant <em>Naskh, Thulth</em> and <em>Tughra</em>, keeping the images inside the wall…”<sup id="fnref:404"><a href="#fn:404" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">404</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Delhi</em></p>
<p>“…Delhi was the source of artistic inspiration for all the later provincial schools of Indo-Muslim architecture. Codrington remarks, ‘At Delhi, the Kutb-ul-Islam marks the beginning of Islamic architecture in India.’ This formative phase of Mosque architecture in India began with the random utilization of temple spoils, Hindu architraves, corbelled ceilings, kumbha pillars with hanging bell-and-chain motifs, which were organised to fulfil the needs of congregational prayer. It is said that the columns of twenty-seven Hindu and Jaina temples were utilized in the great Mosque, at Delhi, rightly called the ‘Might of Islam’. It was built by Qutb-al-Din Aybak in AH 587/AD 1191-92 on an ancient pre-Muslim plinth.<sup id="fnref:405"><a href="#fn:405" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">405</a></sup></p>

The brackets of the incorporated pillars and the carved interior of the corbelled domes are particularly fine. They, of course, necessarily recall the much earlier work of the Quwwat al-Islam at Delhi.

Codrington writes, ‘The Jami‘ Masjid at Cambay was finished in 1325, and is typical of these earlier buildings. It has all the appurtenances that Islam demands-cloisters, open court-yard, the covered place for prayer, <em>mimbar</em> and <em>mihrab</em>-but only the west end is in any sense Islamic.

The use of fragments of Hindu or Buddhist architectural works in the Masjid do [does?] not prove that the site was pre-Muslim. They may have been brought there…”<sup id="fnref:422"><a href="#fn:422" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">422</a></sup></p>
<p>“…Beglar suggests that the <em>mihrab</em> of the Adina Masjid was transferred from a Hindu temple. He says, ‘Of the Hindu sculpture, the most striking and superb is beyond question the trefoil arch and pillars of the main prayer niche.’ But there are no grounds for his assertion. The Adina Masjid <em>mihrab</em>, forming a single work of art, must be accepted as contemporary with the fabric of the Masjid itself. But it must be admitted that the style is local…<sup id="fnref:423"><a href="#fn:423" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">423</a></sup></p>
<p>“Particular attention has been drawn to the curiously interesting designs of the archivolt of the niche. The conventional grotesque Lion’s head at the crown and the <em>Kinnara</em> and <em>Kinnari</em> at the haunches, which appear in the lintel of the Vaishnava temple from Gaud, according to many scholars have been transformed into graceful foliage, palmette and sensuous tendrils…<sup id="fnref:424"><a href="#fn:424" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">424</a></sup></p>
<p>“The discovery of an odd fragment of Hindu sculpture found built into the steps of the staircase has led many scholars to ascribe a pre-Muslim origin to the Adina Masjid. As Cunningham puts it, ‘The steps leading up to the pulpit have fallen down, and, on turning over one of the steps I found a line of Hindu sculpture of very fine and bold execution… The main ornament is a line of circular panels… formed by continuous intersecting lotus stalks. These are five complete panels, and two half-panels which have been cut through. These two contain portions of an elephant and a rhinoceros. In the complete panels are: (i) cow and a calf; (ii) human figures broken; (iii) a goose; (iv) a man and woman and a crocodile; (v) two elephants. The carving is deep and the whole has been polished.’ This sculpture is still visible. It is, therefore, clear that the exigencies of the circumstances led to the utilization of some Hindu materials available on the site. Nevertheless, such mutilated fragments hardly testify to the fact that the Adina Masjid was built on the ruins of an ancient Indian temple.<sup id="fnref:425"><a href="#fn:425" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">425</a></sup></p>
<p>“The western wall of the northern prayer hall is pierced by two openings on either side of die zenana gallery, which reduce the number of niches
(Fig. 3) between the pilaster of the back walls from the 16 found in the
southern prayer hall to 14. These postern gateways (Figs. 3, 9, &amp; Pls.
IV, V), are built out of elements of Hindu door frames and, therefore, are unusual features, rarely found in Indian Mosques. It is hard to believe that they were provided for the use of the general worshippers. Probably they were for the use of the attendants, palanquin-bearers and entourage of the King and his ladies, who entered the Mosque through the adjoining Ladies’ vestibule.<sup id="fnref:426"><a href="#fn:426" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">426</a></sup></p>
<p>“…However, there is one exception shown in the northern hall, which differs from the other semi-circular niches. Here the trefoil arch corresponds generally with that of the central <em>mihrabs</em>. The arch itself has a superimposed ribbed roof, recalling Hindu architecture. The face of the trefoil is decorated with a lotus and diamond band, the pilasters on either side having <em>kumbha</em> bases and looped garlands on their shafts. All these details are different from the rest of the decorative motifs in the Adina Masjid. But there are no grounds for the suggestion that the work is Hindu or that it is built up of fragments of a destroyed Hindu temple. The space between the pilasters of this
<em>mihrab</em> and the stone-face of the brick wall is filled with fragmentary
remains of Hindu sculpture.<sup id="fnref:427"><a href="#fn:427" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">427</a></sup></p>
<p>“…The two postern gateways and the two doors are already mentioned. Beglar pointed out that the door frames of all these four door ways are built up of fragments from some other buildings. He identifies the work as being Hindu but admits that he does not know any local source from their fragments. The work is more or less of the same kind as that to be seen in the postern gate. In all these doorways various Indian motifs attracts undivided attention. These include pot and foliage, pilasters, door guardians and the intertwined <em>nagas</em> on the lintel. The utilization of non-Muslim materials in the Adina Masjid as well as in later Mosques in Gaud and Hazrat Pandua is supported by two fragments in the British Museum. They are cut in basalt and the first shows finely cut Muslim diaper work on one side and the figure of Buddha on the other
(Pls. XLII, a-b). Another fragment has the image of probably the goddess
Brahmani on the other side (Pls. XLI, a-b). The work indicates that these fragments came from Gaud or Hazrat Pandua.<sup id="fnref:428"><a href="#fn:428" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">428</a></sup></p>
<p>“…The entrance gateway to the Minar at Chhoto Pandua as well as that of the Eklakhi Mausoleum at Hazrat Pandua (Pl. XVI) provide parallels for zenana gatways. The floor of the zenana gallery with its worn basalt paving slabs is supported by the squat pillars of the prayer hall below. These support bays roofed by a corbelled construction of plain slabs placed across the corners of the bays. At earlier mosques, such as the Quwwat al-Islam, internal domes constructed in this way were removed from Hindu temples. Here the old Indian method is still utilized with fresh material…<sup id="fnref:429"><a href="#fn:429" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">429</a></sup></p>
<p>“A curiously interesting feature of the Adina Masjid is the square structure, adjoining the outer wall of the <em>qibla</em> on the northern side of the central <em>mihrab</em>. It communicates with the zenana gallery by lintellect doorways, formed by Hindu door jambs as stated earlier. According to Beglar it measures externally 54 feet by 48 feet, whereas ‘Abid ‘Ali notes that this roofless annexe is 42 feet square. It stands on a very high plinth, raising the floor to the level of the ladies’ gallery. The plinth is built of random rubble work with conventionalised Buddhist railing ornament resembling those in the dadoes of the <em>qibla</em> wall of the mosque.<sup id="fnref:430"><a href="#fn:430" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">430</a></sup></p>
<p>“The real character as well as the distinguishing features of the Adina Masjid have yet to be determined. In the present crumbling state of this one-time ‘wonder of the world’, as Cunningham calls it, it is well nigh impossible to say whether this magnificent mosque occupies the site of any Hindu or Buddhist temple. A group of scholars failed to see in the impressive Adina Masjid anything more than a mere assemblage of Hindu or Buddhist fragments, arranged skilfully to adhere to a mosque plan. Ilahi Bakhsh started the controversy when he wrote, ‘It is worth observing that in front of the <em>chaukath</em> (lintel) of the Adina Masjid, there was a broken and polished idol, and that there were other idols lying about. So it appears that, in fact, this mosque was originally an idol-temple.’ Beglar steps up this controversy by saying, ‘the Adina Masjid occupies the site, of a once famous, or at least a most important, and highly ornamented, pre-Muhammadan shrine’; he depends for his arguments on a Proto-Bengali inscription (Fig. 4b) discovered in the building which bears the name of Brahma. Saraswati seems to have carried the thesis too far when he writes, ‘an examination of the stones used in the construction of the Adina Mosque (one of them bearing a Sanskrit inscription recording merely a name, Indranath, in character of the 9th century) and those lying about in heaps all around, reveals the fact, which no careful observer can deny, that most of them came from temples that once stood in the vicinity.’ Beglar even went so far as to pin-point ‘the sanctum of the temple, judging from the remnants of heavy pedestals of statues, now built into the pulpit, and the superb canopied trefoils, now doing duty as prayer niches, stood where the main prayer niche now stands; nothing would probably so tickle the fancy of a bigot, as the power of placing the sanctum of his orthodox cult (in this case the main prayer niche) on the spot, where hated infidel had his sanctum’. The existence of the foundation of a Hindu Temple in the Adina Masjid is as far-fetched as to consider the circular pedestal to the west of the <em>qibla</em> wall as remains of a Buddhist stupa (Fig. 3). It may be the base of a detached minar, as similar examples are to be seen in the mosques of Egypt, Persia and India…”<sup id="fnref:431"><a href="#fn:431" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">431</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Tribeni (Bengal)</em></p>
<p>“The existing tomb and mosque of Zafar Khan Ghazi at Tribeni is another example of contemporary Hindu fragments being utilized in Muslim structure…<sup id="fnref:432"><a href="#fn:432" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">432</a></sup></p>
<p>“The Mosque of Zafar Khan Ghazi is the earliest known example of Mosque architecture in Bengal, and ‘is certainly the oldest in Bengal far anterior to any building at Gaud and Hazrat Pandua’. Marking the earliest phase of Muslim building activities, it incorporates fragments of non-Muslim monuments, like those of the Quwwat al-Islam Mosque in Delhi. R.D. Banerjee is of opinion that ‘the Mosque of Tribeni was most probably a Vaishnava temple but relics of Buddhism and Jainism were found…’<sup id="fnref:433"><a href="#fn:433" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">433</a></sup></p>
<p>“…Unmistakable Hindu workmanship is evident in the mutilated figures in some of the architectural fragments used &ndash; a phenomenon to be observed in the Adina Masjid at Hazrat Pandua, dated AH 776/AD 1374. There are five <em>mihrabs</em> in the <em>qibla</em> wall, the most striking being the central one. Tastefully carved multifoil brick arch of the central mihrab is supported by slender stone pillars of some Hindu temple…<sup id="fnref:434"><a href="#fn:434" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">434</a></sup></p>
<p>“…The utilization of non-Muslim building materials is to be taken as a matter of expediency for no mosque plan was ever superimposed on the traditional ground plan of temple architecture. In the light of this phenomena the mosques can hardly be regarded as mere improvisations of existing temples, as stated by R.D. Banerjee in the case of the Mosque of Zafar Khan. The Muslim architects did not feel any scruple to employ fragments of Hindu sculpture still bearing traces of iconographical art in their mosques, and furthermore Hindu workmanship is evident in the delicate stone carvings and sensuous tendrils, and corbelled domes.”<sup id="fnref:435"><a href="#fn:435" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">435</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Gaud (Bengal)</em></p>
<p>“…Both Cunningham and Marshall accept Creighton’s suggestion that the Lattan Masjid was built in the year AH 880/AD 1475…<sup id="fnref:436"><a href="#fn:436" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">436</a></sup></p>
<p>“The <em>qibla</em> wall has three semi-circular niches, the central one being bigger than the side ones. These are all encrusted with glazed tiles.

<p>“…Although less ornate than those of the southern prayer chamber in the Adina Masjid, the Tantipara Masjid pillars have square bases, moulded bands and cubical abaci. Brown says that the pillars of this mosque are ‘of the square and chamfered variety originally part of a Hindu temple’, but this was not so. They are contemporary with the building. Certainly work of this character is known in Hindu building, and this seems to have misled Brown.<sup id="fnref:438"><a href="#fn:438" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">438</a></sup></p>
<p>“…Two rows of chamfered pillars, each carrying 5 pointed arches, divide the interior of the [Chhoto Sona] Mosque into 3 longitudinal aisles. In each row there are 4 pillars of black basalt which in their moulded string-courses, cubical pedestal, dog-tooth ornament and square abacus recall those of the supporting pillars of the zenana gallery in the Adina Masjid. Evidently they are much more attenuated in shape in the Chhoto Sona Masjid than those in the Adina Masjid. It is hard to ascertain their origins, but considering the enormous quantity of Hindu spoil used in the Chhoto Sona Masjid (Pls. XLI, XLII) and comparing its pillars with the carved stone pillars at the Bari Dargah which originally must have been brought from the Adina Masjid it may be said that they were taken from unidentifiable Hindu temples. <sup id="fnref:439"><a href="#fn:439" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">439</a></sup></p>
<p>“…Many of the stones used for casing the wall to give the illusion of a stone monument from distance are evidently Hindu. To quote Creighton, ‘The stone used in these mosques had formerly belonged to Hindu temples destroyed by the zealous Muhammadans,’ as will be evident from an inspection of Plates XLI and XLII, representing two slabs taken from this Building. Creighton’s painting XVI represents a stone with the image of the Hindu deity, <em>Vishnu</em>, in the Boar incarnation, with shallow diaper carving on the reverse side. The figure of Sivani, the consort of Siva, one of the Hindu triad, appears on another stone sketched by Creighton (painting XVII). The mother figure evidently drawn from sculptured stones used in the Small Golden Mosque is that of Brahmani, given in Plate XLIa (Creighton’s painting XVII). It is very interesting to point out in connection with the figure of Brahmani that it agrees in meticulous execution of details and perfection of style with that of the British Museum piece. Therefore, it is certain that Creighton drew his sketch from this black stone which curiously displays diaper work on the other side (Pl. XLIb) similar to that of Creighton’s Plate XVI. Arabesque design in shallow stone carving, resembling delicate tapestry, appears also in another superb black basalt piece, shown in Plate XLIb, now in the British Museum. It has the image of a seated Buddha on one side thereby again indicating the utilization of non-Muslim material (Pl. XLIIa). This fascinating piece may well be attributed to the Chhoto Sona Masjid on the grounds of the close similarity of its diaper work with that of the stone sketched by Creighton in his Plate XVI, and of the existence of gilding in the shallow carvings of the diaper work.”<sup id="fnref:440"><a href="#fn:440" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">440</a></sup></p>

Chakravarti differ from Blockmann in ascribing Buddhist origin to these pillars and maintain that they were probably quarried from a Hindu temple. As put forward by Cunningham, ‘The Mosque stands on a mound once die site of a Hindu temple, the pillars of which now support this mean-looking barn-like Masjid.’ It would be far-fetched to maintain that the Great Mosque at Chhoto Pandua was built on the very foundation of a Hindu temple, like the improvised Tomb of Zafar Khan Ghazi at Tribeni, dated 14th century AD.”<sup id="fnref:444"><a href="#fn:444" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">444</a></sup></p>

<p>Ibid., p. 127. “<em>Budd</em>” in Islamic parlance means an idol. The word is derived from “<em>Buddha</em>” whose idols were known as <em>Budd or But</em> in Iran long before the Muslims conquered that land. The Muslims borrowed the word and extended it to mean all idols. The Iranian text of
<em>Bundahism</em> translated by H.W. Bailey says that “The demon <em>But</em> is that
which they worship in India and in his image a spirit is resident which is worshipped as <em>Bodasf</em>” (<em>Indian Studies, Volume in Honour of Edward James Rapson, edited by J. Bloch et al., London, 1931, Delhi Reprint</em>, 1988, p. 279). <em>Bodasf</em> is Persian for Bodhisattva.&#160;<a href="#fnref:7" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
