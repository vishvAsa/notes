======================

**[/1/](#m01)** This table shows the percentage of men of each eligible
class in the Indian Infantry (82 active and 18 training battations), the
Indian Cavalry (21 regiments), and the 20 battalions of the Gurkha
infantry. This table does not include the Indian personnel of (a) the 19
ballerics of Indian Mountain Artillery, and (b) 3 regiments of Sappers
and Miners, (c) the Indian Signal Corps, and (d) the Corps of Indian
Pioneers, all of which are composed of different proportions of the
Punjabi Musalmans, Sikhs, Pathans, Hindustani Ilindus and Musalmans,
Madrasis of all classes and Hazra Afghans, either in class units or
class companies. Except that some units in these arms of the service are
composed of the Madrasis and Hazras, now enrolled in other units of the
Indian Army, the class composition of these units does not materially
alter the proportion of the classes as given in the table. This table
does not also include the Indian personnel attached to the British
Infantry and Artillery units.
