He explains this incident in a literary talk about Dravidian literature organised by madam MP Kanimozhi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/vkreader1/status/1625839052145717248&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Su.Keennanur in Cuddalore district of 60 years ago had a Brahmin settlement, which he claims collectively owned 1500 acres of land. He claims that Dravidian movement members used to throw dried fish heads, bones from goat meat dishes into their houses and hide cactus when Brahmin women used to take a bath, early in the morning, so that they hurt their bare feet in the darkness. Note the triumphant note in his voice and the audience applause.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In AP both Reddys and Kammas are land owning agricultural castes with considerable influence. Since early 20th century CE, as Reddys came to dominate the Congress party the Kammas gravitated towards the Justice Party even though it was essentially a Dravidian Party, as it was the only viable political alternative to the Congress in the erstwhile Madras Presidency. Several of them also joined the Communist Party of India but its popularity was limited.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
