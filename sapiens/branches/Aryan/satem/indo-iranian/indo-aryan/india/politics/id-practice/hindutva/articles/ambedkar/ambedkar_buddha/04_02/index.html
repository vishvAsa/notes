<li>The Eternalist said that the soul knows no death: therefore
life is eternal. It is renewed by rebirth.</li>
<li>The thesis of the Annihilationists was summed up in one word,
<em>Ucchedvad</em>, which meant that death is the end of everything. There is
nothing left after death.</li>
<li>The Buddha was not an eternalist. For it involved a belief in
the existence of a separate, immortal soul, to which he was opposed.</li>
<li>Was the Buddha an annihilationist? With his belief in the
non-existence of the soul, the Buddha would naturally be expected to
be an annihilationist.</li>
<li>But in the Alagaddupamma-Sutta the Buddha complains that he is
called an annihilationist, when as a matter of fact he is not.</li>
<li>This is what he says: &ldquo;Though this is what I affirm and what I
preach, yet some recluses and Brahmins, wrongly, erroneously, and
falsely charge me, in defiance of facts, with being an annihilationist
and with preaching the disintegration, destruction, and extirpation of
human beings.</li>
<li>&ldquo;It is just what I am not, and what I do not affirm, that is
wrongly, erroneously, and falsely, charged against me by these good
people who would make me out to be an annihilationist.&rdquo;</li>
<li>If this statement is a genuine one, and is not an
interpolation by those who wanted to foist a Brahmanic doctrine on
Buddhism, the statement raises a serious dilemma</li>
<li>How can the Buddha not believe in the existence of the soul,
and yet say that he is not an annihilationist?</li>
<li>This raises the question: did the Buddha believe in rebirth?</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 2. Rebirth of What?</p>
<ol>
<li>Did the Buddha believe in rebirth?</li>
<li>The answer is in the affirmative.</li>
<li>It is better to split this question further into two parts: (1)
Rebirth of What; and (2) Rebirth of Whom.</li>
<li>It is better to take each one of these two questions
separately.</li>
<li>Here we may consider the first: Rebirth of What.</li>
<li>This question is almost always ignored. It is because of the
mixing of the two questions that so much confusion has arisen.</li>
<li>According to the Buddha, there are four elements of Existence
which go to compose the body. They are (1) Prithvi; (2) Apa; (3) Tej;
and (4) Vayu.</li>
<li>Question is, when the human body dies, what happens to these
four elements? Do they also die along with dead body? Some say that
they do.</li>
<li>The Buddha said no: they join the mass of similar elements
floating in (Akash) space.</li>
<li>When the four elements from this floating mass join together,
a new birth takes place.</li>
<li>This is what the Buddha meant by rebirth.</li>
<li>The elements need not [be], and are not necessarily, from
the same body which is dead. They may be drawn from different dead
bodies.</li>
<li>It must be noted that the body dies. But the elements are
ever-living.</li>
<li>This is the kind of rebirth in which the Buddha believed.</li>
<li>Great light is thrown upon the subject by Sariputta in his
dialogue with Maha-Kotthita.</li>
<li>It is said that once when the Lord was staying at Shravasti in
Jeta&rsquo;s Grove in Anathapindika&rsquo;s Ashram, the Maha-Kotthita, rising up
at even-tide from his meditations, went to Sariputta and asked him to
elucidate some of the questions which troubled him.</li>
<li>The following was one of them.</li>
<li>Maha-Kotthita asked, &ldquo;How many factors has the first ecstasy
(Dhyana) put from it, and how many does it retain?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Sariputta replied, &ldquo;Five of each. Gone are lusts,
malevolence, torpor, worry and doubt. Observation, reflection, zest,
satisfaction and a focussed heart persist.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Maha-Kotthita asked, &ldquo;Take the five senses of sight, sound,
smell, taste and touch,—each with its own particular province and
range of function, separate and mutually distinct. What ultimate base
have they? Who enjoys all their five provinces and ranges?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Sariputta replied, &ldquo;Mind (Mano).&rdquo;</li>
<li>Maha-Kotthita asked, &ldquo;On what do these five faculties of sense
depend?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Sariputta replied, &ldquo;On vitality.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Maha-Kotthita asked, &ldquo;On what does vitality depend?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Sariputta: On heat.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Maha-Kotthita asked, &ldquo;On what does heat depend?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Sariputta replied, &ldquo;On vitality.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Maha-Kotthita asked, &ldquo;You say that vitality depends on heat;
you also say that heat depends on vitality! What precisely is the
meaning to be attached to this?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Sariputta replied, &ldquo;I will give you an illustration. Just as
in the case of a lamp, the light reveals the flame and the flame the
light, so vitality depends upon heat and heat on vitality.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Maha-Kotthita asked, &ldquo;How many things must quit the body
before it is flung aside and cast away like a senseless log?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Sariputta answered, &ldquo;Vitality, heat, and consciousness.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Maha-Kotthita asked, &ldquo;What is the difference between a
lifeless corpse and an almsman in trance, in whom perception and
feelings are stilled?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Sariputta replied, &ldquo;In the corpse not only are the plastic
forces of the body and speech and mind stilled and quiescent, but also
vitality is exhausted, heat is quenched, and the faculties of sense
broken up; whereas in the almsman in trance vitality persists, heat
abides, and the faculties are clear, although respiration,
observation, and perception are stilled and quiescent.&rdquo;</li>
<li>This probably is the best and most complete exposition of
Death or Annihilation.</li>
<li>There is only one lacuna in this dialogue. Maha-Kotthita
should have asked Sariputta one question: What is heat?</li>
<li>What answer Sariputta would have given, it is not easy to
imagine. But there can be no doubt that heat means energy.</li>
<li>Thus amplified, the real answer to the question, What happens
when the body dies? is: the body ceases to produce energy.</li>
<li>But this is only a part of the answer. Because death also
means that whatever energy that had escaped from the body joins the
general mass of energy playing about in the Universe.</li>
<li>Annihilation has therefore a two-fold aspect. In one of its
aspects it means cession [=cessation] of production of energy. In
another aspect it means a new addition to the stock of [the] general
floating mass of energy.</li>
<li>It is probably because of this two-fold aspect of annihilation
that the Buddha said that he was not an absolute annihilationist. He
was an annihilationist so far as soul was concerned. He was not an
annihilationist so far as matter was concerned.</li>
<li>So interpreted, it is easy to understand why the Buddha said
that he was not an annihilationist. He believed in the regeneration of
matter and not in the rebirth of the soul.</li>
<li>So interpreted, the Buddha&rsquo;s view is in consonance with
science.</li>
<li>It is only in this sense that the Buddha could be said to have
believed in rebirth.</li>
<li>Energy is never lost. That is what science affirms.
Annihilation in the sense that after death nothing is left, would be
contrary to science. For it would mean that energy is not constant in
volume.</li>
<li>This is the only way by which the dilemma could be solved.</li>
</ol>
<p>§3. Rebirth of Whom?</p>
<ol>
<li>The most difficult question is Rebirth of Whom.</li>
<li>Does the same dead person take a new birth?</li>
<li>Did the Buddha believe in this thesis? The answer is, &ldquo;Most
improbable.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The answer depends upon the elements of existence of the dead
man meeting together and forming a new body; then the possibility of
the rebirth of the same sentient being is possible.</li>
<li>If a new body is formed after a mixture or the different
elements of the different men who are dead, then there is rebirth but
not the rebirth of the same sentient being.</li>
<li>This point has been well explained by sister Khema to King
Pasenadi.</li>
<li>Once the Exalted One was staying near Savatthi at Jeta Grove,
in Anathapindika&rsquo;s Ashram.</li>
<li>Now on that occasion the sister Khema, after going her rounds
among the Kosalana, took up her quarters at Toranavatthu, between
Shravasti and Saketa.</li>
<li>Now the Rajah Pasenadi of Kosala was journeying from Saketa to
Shravasti, and midway between Saketa and Shravasti he put up for one
night at Toranavatthu.</li>
<li>The Rajah Pasenadi of Kosala called a certain man and said,
&ldquo;Come thou, good fellow! Find out some recluse or brahmin such that I
can wait upon him today.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Even so, your majesty,&rdquo; said that man in reply to the Rajah
Pasenadi of Kosala, and after wandering through all Toranavatthu he
saw not any one, either recluse or brahmin, on whom the Rajah Pasenadi
might wait.</li>
<li>Then that man saw the sister Khema, who had come to reside at
Toranavatthu. And on seeing her he went back to the Rajah Pasenadi of
Kosala, and said:</li>
<li>&ldquo;Your Majesty, there is no recluse or brahmin in Toranavatthu
such that your majesty can wait upon him. But, your majesty, there is
a sister named Khema, a woman-disciple of that Exalted One. Now of
this lady a lovely rumour has gone abroad, that she is sage,
accomplished, shrewd, widely learned, a brilliant talker, of goodly
ready wit. Let your majesty wait upon her.&rdquo;</li>
<li>So the Rajah Pasenadi of Kosala went to visit the sister
Khema, and on coming to her saluted and sat down at one side. So
seated, he said to her:</li>
<li>&ldquo;How say you, lady? Does the Tathagata exist after death?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;That also, maharajah is not revealed by the Exalted One.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;How then, lady? When asked &lsquo;Does the Tathagata exist after
death?&rsquo; you reply, &lsquo;That is not revealed by the Exalted One,&rsquo; and when
I ask&hellip;the other questions, you make the same reply. Pray, lady, what
is the reason, what is the cause, why this thing is not revealed by
the Exalted One?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Now in this matter, maharajah, I will question you. Do you
reply as you think fit. Now how say you, maharajah. Have you some
accountant, some ready reckoner, or calculator, able to count the sand
in [the] Ganges, thus: There are so many hundred grains, or so many
thousand grains, or so many hundreds of thousands of grains of
sand?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;No, indeed, lady.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Then have you some accountant, ready reckoner, or calculator
able to reckon the water in the mighty ocean, thus: There are so many
gallons of water, so many hundreds, so many thousands, so many
hundreds of thousand gallons of water?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;No, indeed, lady.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;How is that?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Mighty is the ocean, lady&ndash;deep, boundless, unfathomable.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Even so, maharajah, if one should try to define the Tathagata
by his bodily form, that bodily form of the Tathagata is abandoned,
cut down at the root, made like a palm-tree stump, made some thing
that is not, made of a nature not to spring up again in future time.
Set free from reckoning as body, maharajah, is the Tathagata. He is
deep, boundless unfathomable, just like the mighty ocean. To say, &lsquo;The
Tathagata exists after death&rsquo;, does not apply. To say, &lsquo;The Tathagata
exists not after death&rsquo;, does not apply. To say, &lsquo;The Tathagata both
exists and exists not, neither exists nor not exists, after death&rsquo;,
does not apply.</li>
<li>&ldquo;If one should try to define the Tathagata by feeling&ndash;that
feeling of the Tathagata is abandoned, cut down at the root&hellip;Yet free
from reckoning as feeling is the Tathagata, maharajah, deep,
boundless, unfathomable like the mighty ocean. To say, &lsquo;The Tathagata
exists after death&hellip;exists not after death&rsquo;, does not apply.</li>
<li>&ldquo;So also if one should try to define the Tathagata by
perception, by the activities, by consciousness&hellip;set free from
reckoning by consciousness is the Tathagata, deep, boundless,
unfathomable as the mighty ocean. To say, &lsquo;The Tathagata exists after
death&hellip;exists not after death&rsquo;, does not apply.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Then the Rajah Pasenadi of Kosala was delighted with the words
of the sister Khema, and took pleasure therein. And he rose from his
seat, saluted her by the right, and went away.</li>
<li>Now on another occasion the Rajah went to visit the Exalted
One, and on coming to him saluted him and sat down at one side. So
seated, he said to the Exalted One:</li>
<li>&ldquo;Pray, Lord, does the Tathagata exist after death?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Not revealed by me, maharajah, is this matter.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Then Lord, the Tathagata does not exist after death.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;That also, maharajah, is not revealed by me.&rdquo;</li>
<li>He then asks the other questions and gets the same reply.</li>
<li>&ldquo;How then, Lord? When I ask the question, &lsquo;Does the Tathagata
exist?&hellip;does he not exist after death?&rsquo; you reply, &lsquo;It is not
revealed by me&rsquo;. Pray, Lord, what is the reason, what is the cause,
why this thing is not revealed by the Exalted One?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Now, maharajah, I will question you. Do you reply as you
think fit. Now what say you, maharajah&ndash;have you some
accountant&hellip;(the rest is exactly as before).&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Wonderful, Lord! Strange it is, Lord, how the explanation
both of Master and disciple, both in spirit and in letter, will agree,
will harmonise, will not be inconsistent, that is, in any word about
the highest.</li>
<li>&ldquo;On a certain occasion. Lord, I went to visit the sister
Khema, and asked her the meaning of this matter, and she gave me the
meaning in the very words, in the very syllables used by the Exalted
One. Wonderful, Lord! Strange it is, Lord, how the explanation both of
Master and disciple will agree, will harmonise, in spirit and in
letter, how they will not be inconsistent,&ndash;that is, in any word about
the highest.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Well, Lord, now we must be going. We are busy folk. We have
many things to do.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Do now what you think it is time for, maharajah.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Thereupon the Rajah Pasenadi of Kosala was delighted with the
words of the Exalted One, and welcomed them. And he rose from his
seat, saluted the Exalted One by the right, and went away.</li>
</ol>
<p>SECTION TWO&ndash;KARMA</p>
<p>§ 1. Is the Buddhist Doctrine of Karma the same as the Brahminic
Doctrine?</p>
<ol>
<li>There is no doctrine in the Buddha&rsquo;s Dhamma which has created
so much confusion as this doctrine of Karma.</li>
<li>What is its place in the Buddha&rsquo;s Dhamma, and what is its
significance which has already been told?</li>
<li>Ignorant Hindus, out of sheer want of understanding, say by
comparing merely the similarity of words, that Buddhism is the same as
Brahmanism or Hinduism.</li>
<li>The educated and orthodox section of the Brahmins also do the
same. They do so deliberately, to mislead the ignorant masses.</li>
<li>The educated Brahmins know full well that the Buddhist Law of
Karma is quite different from the Brahminic Law of Karma. Yet they
keep on saying that Buddhism is the same as Brahmanism and Hinduism.</li>
<li>The similarity in terminology gives them an easy handle for
their false and malicious propaganda.</li>
<li>It is, therefore, necessary to examine the position closely.</li>
<li>The Buddha&rsquo;s Law of Karma, however much may be similarity of
words cannot be the same in its connotation as the Brahminic Law of
Karma.</li>
<li>The premises of the two are so widely different, indeed so
widely opposed that the result of the two cannot be the same. They
must be different.</li>
<li>The principles of the Hindu Law of Karma may be stated
seriatim [=systematically] for convenience.</li>
<li>The Hindu Law of Karma is based on the soul. The Buddhist is
not. In fact, there is no soul in Buddhism.</li>
<li>The Brahminic Law of Karma is hereditary.</li>
<li>It goes on from life to life. This is so because of the
transmigration of the soul.</li>
<li>This cannot be true of the Buddhist Law of Karma. This is also
because there is no soul.</li>
<li>The Hindu Law of Karma is based on the existence of a soul
which is distinct from the body. When the body dies, the soul does not
die. The soul flies away.</li>
<li>This is not true of the Buddhist Law of Karma.</li>
<li>According to the Hindu Law of Karma, what happens when a man
does a karma is this: his act produces two-fold results. It affects
the doer; and secondly it produces an impress upon his soul.</li>
<li>Each act he does produces an impress upon his soul.</li>
<li>When a man dies and when his soul escapes, the soul is full of
such impressions.</li>
<li>It is these impressions which determine his birth and status
in his future life.</li>
<li>This Hindu theory is inconsistent with the Buddhist theory of
no-soul.</li>
<li>For these reasons, the Buddhist doctrine of Karma cannot be,
and is not, the same as the Hindu doctrine of Karma.</li>
<li>It is therefore simply foolish to talk about the Buddhist
doctrine of Karma being the same as the Brahminic doctrine of Karma.</li>
<li>All that one can say is, beware of this jugglery.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 2. Did the Buddha believe in Past Karma having effect on Future
Life?</p>
<ol>
<li>The Law of Karma was enunciated by the Buddha. He was the first
to say: &ldquo;Reap as you sow.&rdquo;</li>
<li>He was so emphatic about the Law of Karma that he maintained
that there could be no moral order unless there was a stern observance
of the Law of Karma.</li>
<li>The Buddha&rsquo;s Law of Karma applied only to Karma and its effect
on present life.</li>
<li>There is, however, an extended doctrine of Karma. According to
it, Karma includes Karma done in past life or lives.</li>
<li>If a man is born in a poor family, it is because of his past
bad karma. If a man is born in a rich family, it is because of his
past good karma.</li>
<li>If a man is born with a congenital defect, it is because of his
past bad karma.</li>
<li>This is a very pernicious doctrine. For in this interpretation
of karma there is no room left for human effort. Everything is
predetermined for him by his past karma.</li>
<li>This extended doctrine is often found to be attributed to the
Buddha.</li>
<li>Did the Buddha believe in such a doctrine?</li>
<li>To examine this extended doctrine properly, it is better to
change the language in which it is usually expressed.</li>
<li>Instead of saying that past karma is transmitted, it should be
better if it was said that past karma is inherited.</li>
<li>This change of language enables us to test it by the law of
heredity. At the same time it does no harm to the doctrine, either to
its <em>de jure</em> or <em>de facto</em> connotation.</li>
<li>This restatement makes it possible to pose the two questions
which could not otherwise be posed, and without answering which the
matter could not be made clear.</li>
<li>The first question is, how is past karma inherited? What is
the process?</li>
<li>The second question is, what is the nature of past karma in
terms of heredity? Is it an inherent characteristic, or [an]
acquired characteristic?</li>
<li>What do we inherit from our parents?</li>
<li>Starting with science, the new individual begins when a sperm
enters the egg. Fertilisation consists in fusion of the head of the
sperm with the nucleus of the egg.</li>
<li>Each human being takes its origin from the union of two bits
of living matter, an egg from the mother which has been fertilised by
a single sperm from the father.</li>
<li>That human birth is genetic is told by the Buddha to a Yakkha
who came to discuss the matter with him.</li>
<li>The Exalted One was then staying near Rajagraha, on the hill
called Indra&rsquo;s Peak.</li>
<li>Now that Yakkha drew near to the Exalted One and addressed him
as follows:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Material form is not the living soul&rsquo;.<br>
So says the Enlightened One. Then how doth soul possess this body?<br>
Whence to soul doth come<br>
Our bunch of bones and bowels?<br>
How doth soul within the mother-cave suspended bide?</p></blockquote>
<ol start="22">
<li>To this the Exalted One replied:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>At first the <em>Kalala</em> takes birth, and thence the <em>abudde</em>.<br>
Therefrom the <em>pesi</em> grows,<br>
Developing as <em>ghana</em> in its turn.<br>
Now in the <em>ghana</em> doth appear the hair,<br>
The down, the nails.<br>
And whatsoever food and drink the mother of him takes,<br>
thereby the man in mother&rsquo;s womb doth live and grow.</p></blockquote>
<ol start="23">
<li>But the Hindu doctrine differs.</li>
<li>It says that the body is genetic. But the soul is not. It is
implanted into the body from outside&ndash;the doctrine is unable to
specify the source.</li>
<li>Turning to the second question as to what is the nature of
past karma, it must be determined whether it is an inherent
characteristic or an acquired characteristic.</li>
<li>Unless an answer to this question is forthcoming, it cannot be
tested by the scientific theory of heredity.</li>
<li>But assuming there is an answer one way or the other to this
question, how is it possible to get any help from science [as to]
whether it is a sensible theory or senseless theory?</li>
<li>According to science, a child inherits the characteristics of
his parents.</li>
<li>In the Hindu doctrine of karma a child inherits nothing from
its parents except the body. The past karma in the Hindu doctrine is
the inheritance of the child by the child and for the child.</li>
<li>The parents contributes nothing. The child brings
everything.</li>
<li>Such a doctrine is nothing short of an absurdity.</li>
<li>As shown above, the Buddha did not believe in such an
absurdity.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Yes, if it were not reborn; but if it were, no.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Give me an illustration.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Suppose, O king, a man were to steal another man&rsquo;s mangoes,
would the thief deserve punishment?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;But he would not have stolen the mangoes the other set in the
ground. Why would he deserve punishment?</li>
<li>&ldquo;Because those he stole were the result of those that were
planted.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Just so, great king, this name-and-form commits deeds, either
pure or impure, and by that karma another name-and-form is reborn. And
therefore is it not set free from its evil deeds?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Very good, Nagasena!&rdquo;</li>
<li>The king said, &ldquo;When deeds are committed, Nagasena, by one
name-and-form, what becomes of those deeds?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The deeds would follow it, O king, like a shadow that never
leaves it.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Can anyone point out those deeds, saying: &lsquo;Here are those
deeds, or there?&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;No &quot;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Give me an illustration.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Now what do you think, O king? Can anyone point out the
fruits which a tree has not yet produced, saying:</li>
<li>&lsquo;Here they are, or there?&rsquo;&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Certainly not, sir.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Just so, great king; so long as the continuity of life is not
cut off, it is impossible to point out the deeds that are done.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Very good, Nagasena.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 3. Did the Buddha believe in Past Karma having effect on Future
Life? —concluded</p>
<ol>
<li>The Buddha&rsquo;s doctrine of Past Karma is thus in keeping with
science.</li>
<li>He did not believe in the inheritance of Past Karma.</li>
<li>How can he, having held to the view that birth is genetic, and
whatever inheritance comes to the child, it comes through its
parents?</li>
<li>Apart from logic there is more direct evidence on the point
contained in a sutta called the Cula-Dukkha-Khanda-Sutta which
contains a dialogue between the Buddha and the Jains.</li>
<li>In this dialogue this is what the Buddha says: &ldquo;Niganthas, you
have done evil in the past; extirpate it by these severe austerities.
Every present restraint on body, speech, and mind will hereafter undo
the evil doings of the past. Hence, by expelling through penance all
past misdeeds, and by not committing fresh misdeeds, the future
becomes cleared; with the future cleared, the past is wiped out; with
the past wiped out, ill is no more; with ill no more, (painful)
feelings are no more; and with painful feelings now no more, all will
be outworn. This teaching commends and approves itself to us, and we
rejoice in it.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Thereupon, I said to those Niganthas, &ldquo;Do you know, reverend
sirs, whether you had an existence before this or you were not
non-existent?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;No, Sir.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Do you know that, in a former existence, you were guilty, and
not guiltless, of misdeeds?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Do you know that (in that former existence) you were guilty,
and not guiltless, of this or that specific misdeed?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Secondly the Buddha asserts that the status of a man may be
governed not so much by heredity as by his environment.</li>
<li>In the Devadaha-Sutta, this is what the Buddha says: &ldquo;Some
recluses and Brahmins there are who affirm and hold the view that,
whatsoever the individual experiences&ndash;be it [=they] pleasant or
unpleasant or neither&ndash;all comes from former actions. Hence, by
expiation and purge of former misdeeds, and by not committing fresh
misdeeds, nothing accrues for the future; the misdeeds die away; as
misdeeds die away, ill dies away; as ill dies away, feelings die away;
and as feelings die away, all will wear out and pass. This is what the
Niganthas affirm.</li>
<li>&ldquo;If it is because of their birth&rsquo;s environment that creatures
experience pleasure and pain, the Niganthas are blameworthy, and they
are also blameworthy, if environment is not the cause.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Now these statements of the Buddha are very relevant. How
could the Buddha throw doubt on past karma, if he believed in it? How
could the Buddha maintain [that] pain and pleasure in [the]
present life being [=is] due to environment, if he believed that it
was due to past karma?</li>
<li>The doctrine of past karma is a purely Brahminic doctrine.
Past karma taking effect in [the] present life is quite consistent
with the Brahminic doctrine of soul, the effect of karma on soul. But
it is quite inconsistent with the Buddhist doctrine of non-soul.</li>
<li>It has been bodily introduced into Buddhism by someone who
wanted to make Buddhism akin to Hinduism, or who did not know what the
Buddhist doctrine was.</li>
<li>This is one reason why it must be held that the Buddha could
not have preached such a doctrine.</li>
<li>There is another and a more general reason why it must be held
that the Buddha could not have preached such a doctrine.</li>
<li>The basis of the Hindu doctrine of past karma as the regulator
of future life is an iniquitous doctrine. What could have been the
purpose of inventing such a doctrine?</li>
<li>The only purpose one can think of is to enable the state or
the society to escape responsibility for the condition of the poor and
the lowly.</li>
<li>Otherwise, such an inhuman and absurd doctrine could never
have been invented.</li>
<li>It is impossible to imagine that the Buddha, who was known as
the Maha Karunika, could have supported such a doctrine.</li>
</ol>
<p>SECTION THREE&ndash;AHIMSA</p>
<p>§ 1. The different ways in which it was interpreted and followed</p>
<ol>
<li>Ahimsa, or non-killing, forms a very important part of the
Buddha&rsquo;s teachings.</li>
<li>It is intimately connected with Karuna and Maitri.</li>
<li>The question has, however, been raised whether His Ahimsa was
absolute in its obligation, or only relative. Was it only a principle?
Or was it a rule?</li>
<li>People who accept the Buddha&rsquo;s teachings find it difficult to
accept Ahimsa as an absolute obligation. They say that such a
definition of Ahimsa involves the sacrifice of good for evil, the
sacrifice of virtue for vice.</li>
<li>This question requires to be clarified. There is no subject
which is a matter of greater confusion than this subject of Ahimsa.</li>
<li>How have the people of Buddhist countries understood and
practised Ahimsa?</li>
<li>This is an important question which must be taken into
account.</li>
<li>The monks of Ceylon fought against, and asked the people of
Ceylon to fight against, the foreign invaders.</li>
<li>On the other hand the monks of Burma refused to fight against
the foreign invaders, and asked the Burmese people not to fight.</li>
<li>The Burmese people eat eggs but not fish.</li>
<li>This is how Ahimsa is understood and followed.</li>
<li>Recently the German Buddhist Association passed a resolution
by which they accepted all the Panch Silas except the first, which
deals with Ahimsa.</li>
<li>This is the position about the Doctrine of Ahimsa.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 2. True Meaning of Ahimsa</p>
<ol>
<li>What does Ahimsa mean?</li>
<li>The Buddha has nowhere given any definition of Ahimsa. In fact
he has very seldom, if at all, referred to the subject in specific
terms.</li>
<li>One has, therefore to spell out his intention from
circumstantial evidence.</li>
<li>The first circumstantial evidence on the point is that the
Buddha had no objection to eating meat, if it was offered to him as
part of his alms.</li>
<li>The monk can eat meat offered to him, provided he was not a
party to the killing of it.</li>
<li>He resisted the opposition of Devadatta, who insisted that the
monks should be prohibited from eating meat given to them by way of
alms.</li>
<li>The next piece of evidence on the point is that he was only
opposed to the killing of animals in yajna (sacrifice). This he has
himself said.</li>
<li>Ahimsa Permo Dharma is an extreme Doctrine. It is a Jain
Doctrine. It is not a Buddhist Doctrine.</li>
<li>There is another piece of evidence which is more direct than
circumstantial, which almost amounts to a definition of Ahimsa. He has
said: &ldquo;Love all, so that you may not wish to kill any.&rdquo; This is a
positive way of stating the principle of Ahimsa.</li>
<li>From this it appears that the doctrine of Ahimsa does not say
&ldquo;Kill not.&rdquo; It says, &ldquo;Love all.&rdquo;</li>
<li>In the light of these statements, it is quite easy to have a
clear understanding of what the Buddha meant by Ahimsa.</li>
<li>It is quite clear that Buddha meant to make a distinction
between will to kill and need to kill.</li>
<li>He did not ban killing where there was need to kill.</li>
<li>What he banned was killing where there was nothing but the
will to kill.</li>
<li>So understood, there is no confusion in the Buddhist doctrine
of Ahimsa.</li>
<li>It is a perfectly sound or moral doctrine which everyone must
respect.</li>
<li>No doubt he leaves it to every individual to decide whether
the need to kill is there. But with whom else could it be left? Man
has Pradnya, and he must use it.</li>
<li>A moral man may be trusted to draw the line at the right
point.</li>
<li>Brahminism has in it the will to kill.</li>
<li>Jainism has in it the will never to kill.</li>
<li>The Buddha&rsquo;s Ahimsa is quite in keeping with his middle
path.</li>
<li>To put it differently, the Buddha made a distinction between
Principle and Rule. He did not make Ahimsa a matter of Rule. He
enunciated it as a matter of Principle or way of life.</li>
<li>In this he no doubt acted very wisely.</li>
<li>A principle leaves you freedom to act. A rule does not. Rule
either breaks you, or you break the rule.</li>
</ol>
<p>SECTION FOUR&ndash;TRANSMIGRATION</p>
<ol>
<li>The Blessed Lord preached that there was rebirth. But the
Blessed Lord also preached that there was no transmigration.</li>
<li>There were not wanting people who criticised the Lord for
preaching what they regarded as two such contradictory doctrines.</li>
<li>How can there be rebirth unless there is transmigration? asked
the critics.</li>
<li>There is here a case of rebirth without transmigration, they
said. Can this be?</li>
<li>There is no contradiction. There can be rebirth, although there
is no transmigration.</li>
<li>This has been well explained by Nagasena in his replies to the
questions of King Milinda.</li>
<li>Milinda, King of Bactria, asked Nagasena, &ldquo;Did the Buddha
believe in Rebirth (Transmigration)?&rdquo;</li>
<li>His reply was &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Is this not a contradiction?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Nagasena replied, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Can there be rebirth without a soul?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Nagasena said, &ldquo;Of course, yes, there can be.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Explain how it can be.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The king said, &ldquo;Where there is no transmigration, Nagasena,
can there be rebirth?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Yes, there can.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;But how can that be? Give me an illustration.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Suppose a man, O king, were to light a lamp from another
lamp&ndash;can it be said that the one transmigrates from, or to, the
other?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Just so, great king, is rebirth without transmigration.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Give me a further illustration.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Do you recollect, great king, having learnt, when you were a
boy, some verse or other from your teacher?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Yes. I recollect that.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Well then, did that verse transmigrate from your teacher?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Just so, great king, is rebirth without transmigration.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Very good, Nagasena!&rdquo;</li>
<li>The king said, &ldquo;Is there such a thing, Nagasena, as the
soul?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;In the highest sense, O king, there is no such thing.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Very good, Nagasena!&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>SECTION FIVE&ndash;CAUSES OF THIS MISUNDERSTANDING</p>
<ol>
<li>What the Buddha preached was heard by his audience, which
largely consisted of the Bhikkus.</li>
<li>It is the Bhikkus who reported to the people at large what the
Buddha had said on any particular matter.</li>
<li>The art of writing had not yet developed. The Bhikkus had
therefore to memorise what they had heard. Not every Bhikku cared to
memorise what he heard. But there were some that had made it their
profession to memorise. They were called Bhanakas.</li>
<li>The Buddhist canonical literature is as vast as [an] ocean.
To memorise all this was indeed a great feat.</li>
<li>In reporting the Buddha, it has often been found that he has
been misreported.</li>
<li>Many cases of misreporting had been brought to the knowledge of
the Buddha while he was alive.</li>
<li>Reference may be made by way of illustration to five such
cases. One is mentioned in the Alagaddupama Sutta and the other in the
Maha-Kamma-Vibhanga Sutta, a third in the Kannakatthala Sutta, [a]
fourth in the Maha-Tanha-Sankhya Sutta, and[a] fifth in the Jivaka
Sutta.</li>
<li>There were perhaps many more such cases of misreporting. For we
find that even the Bhikkus going [=went] to the Buddha, asking him
to tell them what they should do in such contingencies.</li>
<li>The cases of misreporting are common with regard to karma and
rebirth.</li>
<li>These doctrines have also a place in the Brahminic religion;
consequently, it was easy for the Bhanakas to incorporate the
Brahminic tenets into the Buddhist Religion.</li>
<li>One has therefore to be very careful in accepting what is said
in the Buddhist canonical literature as being the word of the
Buddha.</li>
<li>There is, however, one test which is available.</li>
<li>If there is anything which could be said with confidence it
is: He was nothing if not rational, if not logical. Anything therefore
which is rational and logical, other things being equal, may be taken
to be the word of the Buddha.</li>
<li>The second thing is that the Buddha never cared to enter into
a discussion which was not profitable for man&rsquo;s welfare. Therefore
anything attributed to the Buddha which did not relate to man&rsquo;s
welfare cannot be accepted to be the word. of the Buddha.</li>
<li>There is a third test. It is that the Buddha divided all
matters into two classes: those about which he was certain, and those
about which he was not certain. On matters which fell into class I, he
has stated his views definitely and conclusively. On matters which
fell into class II, he has expressed his views, but they are only
tentative views.</li>
<li>In discussing the three questions about which there is doubt
and difference, it is necessary to bear these tests in mind, before
deciding what the view of the Buddha was thereon.</li>
