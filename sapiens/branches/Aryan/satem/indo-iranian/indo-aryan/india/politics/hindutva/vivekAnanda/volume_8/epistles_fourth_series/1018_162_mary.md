## CLXII

*To Miss Mary Hale*

1719 TURK STREET,  
SAN FRANCISCO,  
*12th March, 1900*.

DEAR MARY,

How are you? How is Mother, and the sisters? How are things going on in
Chicago? I am in Frisco, and shall remain here for a month or so. I
start for Chicago early in April. I shall write to you before that of
course. How I wish I could be with you for a few days; one gets tired of
work so much. My health is so so, but my mind is very peaceful and has
been so for some time. I am trying to give up all anxiety unto the Lord.
I am only a worker. My mission is to obey and work. He knows the rest.

"Giving up all vexations and paths, do thou take refuge unto Me. I will
save you from all dangers" (Gita, XVIII.66).

I am trying hard to realise that. May I be able to do it soon.

Ever your affectionate brother,

VIVEKANANDA.
