title = "05 Actual response of hindus"

+++

- Superior response strategy consider elsewhere.
- sindhi and gujarAti traders are spread through out the world.

## Regional survey
### Criteria
- Strong regard for v1s and varNAshrama dharma with regards to ritual. A good arrangement where v1 (and rare v2-s for state rituals even under defacto shUdra kings) can retain core H dharma.

### keraLa
Some 45% hindus - close to half of them are high quality - strong regard for varNAshrama dharma with reagards to ritual.  


In that "commie" state, the H have taken court order to ensure that ritual brAhmaNa bhojana continues in temples. (in contrast to neighboring KA, where it's been barred.)

mallapuram has only 20% (?) H - but again of such high quality that it leads in the number of temples restored (not just because there are just more ruined temples). It seems that in some place beef was hung at the entrance of the temple, and the hands of the person who did so was cut in return.

Aravindalochana's opinion :

> It may be that even 1:2 H:M ratio, H can stay in control - M population quality being that lower.

However, both were black-pilled about H future due to sheer degeneracy.

### vidishA / mAlvA
One can observe strong regard for practicing v1s vidiShA / mAlvA in MP. 

not about Orissa (despite strong H majority).

### rAjasthAn
Strong regard for v1s.

- Bishnois don't cut down trees or kill animals ([PJ](http://www.academia.edu/211074/The_Bishnoi_An_Ecotheological_Community_in_the_Indian_Desert), [FV](http://www.franckvogel.com/english/portfolio-bishnois.html)), they don't let in outsiders into their villages (especially muslims). They have high TFR (anecdotes).
  - This can be contrasted by some brahmanas selling agrahara lands to muslims for money in TN (who overpay to get a foothold - via R).


### Bengal
In Bengal, praNavAnanda warned about what was to come in 1920s; but was laughed off ("what will the M do - they work for us"). Only few prepared and resisted when the time came; but even they were overwhelmed when state power was invoked. (as was the case in rAvalpiNDi, PK).
