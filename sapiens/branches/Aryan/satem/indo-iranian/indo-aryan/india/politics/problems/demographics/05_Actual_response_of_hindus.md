- Superior response strategy consider elsewhere.
- Bishnois don't cut down trees or kill animals ([PJ](http://www.academia.edu/211074/The_Bishnoi_An_Ecotheological_Community_in_the_Indian_Desert), [FV](http://www.franckvogel.com/english/portfolio-bishnois.html)), they don't let in outsiders into their villages (especially muslims). They have high TFR (anecdotes).
    - This can be contrasted by some brahmanas selling agrahara lands to muslims for money in TN (who overpay to get a foothold - via R).
- sindhi and gujarAti traders are spread through out the world.
