Vivekananda, the popular Hindu monk, whose physiognomy bore the&#xA;most striking resemblance to the classic face of the Buddha, denounced&#xA;our commercial prosperity, our bloody wars, and our religious&#xA;intolerance, declaring that at such a price the &amp;ldquo;mild Hindu&amp;rdquo; would have&#xA;none of our vaunted civilisation. . . . &amp;ldquo;You come,&amp;rdquo; he cried,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;with the Bible in one hand and the conqueror&amp;rsquo;s sword in the other — you,&#xA;with your religion of yesterday, to us, who were taught thousands of&#xA;years ago by our &lt;em&gt;Rishis&lt;/em&gt; precepts as noble and lives as holy as your&#xA;Christ&amp;rsquo;s. You trample on us and treat us like the dust beneath your&#xA;feet. You destroy precious life in animals. You are &lt;em&gt;carnivores&lt;/em&gt;. You&#xA;degrade our people with drink. You insult our women. You scorn our&#xA;religion — in many points like yours, only better, because more humane.&#xA;And then you wonder why Christianity makes such slow progress in India.&#xA;I tell you it is because you are not like your Christ, whom we could&#xA;honour and reverence. Do you think, if you came to our doors like him,&#xA;meek and lowly, with a message of love, living and working and suffering&#xA;for others, as he did, we should turn a deaf ear? Oh no! We should&#xA;receive him and listen to him, and as we have done our own inspired&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Rishis&lt;/em&gt; (teachers). . . .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The Hall of Colombus&#xA;[Columbus] was badly crowded. . . . Dr. Noble then presented Swami&#xA;Vivekananda, the Hindu monk, who was applauded loudly as he stepped&#xA;forward to the centre of the platform. He wore an orange robe, bound&#xA;with a scarlet sash, and a pale yellow turban. The customary smile was&#xA;on his handsome face and his eyes shown with animation. Said he:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Among other things, the Swami is reported to have said that&#xA;&amp;ldquo;the way of converting is absolutely absurd&amp;rdquo;;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Missionary doctors do no good, because they are not in touch with the&#xA;people. . . . They accomplish nothing in the way of converting, although&#xA;they may have nice sociable times among themselves, &amp;amp;c.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I believe, it is only a kind of&#xA;anthropomorphism which the human mind stumbles upon in its first efforts&#xA;to understand the unknown. The ultimate satisfaction of human reason and&#xA;custom lies in the realisation of that universal essence which is the&#xA;All. And I hold an irrefragable evidence that this idea is present in&#xA;the Vedas, the numerous gods and their invocations notwithstanding. This&#xA;idea of formless All, the &lt;em&gt;Sat&lt;/em&gt;, i.e., esse or being, called &lt;em&gt;Atman&lt;/em&gt; and&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Brahman&lt;/em&gt; in the Upanishads, and further explained in the Darsans, is&#xA;the central idea of the Vedas, nay, the root-idea of the Hindu religion&#xA;in general.

He has done honor to himself, to his&#xA;race and his religion. If we are right in this view, it follows that the&#xA;opinions of Vivekananda are entitled to the highest consideration. This&#xA;is what he says with regard to the sea-voyage movement: —&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The following were his&#xA;concluding words: —&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We cannot live without you, nor you without us. Then believe that&#xA;separation has shown to us, that you cannot stand without the brain and&#xA;the philosophy of the Brahman [sic], nor we without your heart. This&#xA;separation between the Buddhist and the Brahman [Brahmin] is the cause&#xA;of the downfall of India. That is why India has been the slave of&#xA;conquerors for the past 1000 years. Let us then join the wonderful&#xA;intellect of the Brahman [Brahmin] with the heart, the noble soul, the&#xA;wonderful humanising power of the Great Master.

The Swami who wore the red robe of his sect, spoke with&#xA;great fluency and in perfect English for more than an hour without the&#xA;help of a single note. He said that religion was the most wonderful&#xA;factor in the social organism. If knowledge was the highest gain that&#xA;science could give, what could be greater than the knowledge of God, of&#xA;the soul, of man&amp;rsquo;s own nature which was given by the study of religion?&#xA;It was not only impossible that there should be one religion for the&#xA;whole world, but it would be dangerous. If the whole of religious&#xA;thought was at the same level, it would be the death of religious&#xA;thought; variety was its life. There were four types of religion — (1)&#xA;the worker, (2) the emotional, (3) the mystical, and (4) the&#xA;philosophical. Each man unfortunately became so wedded to his own type&#xA;that he had no eyes to see what existed in the world. He struggled to&#xA;make others of the same type. That religion would be perfect which gave&#xA;scope to all the different characters. The Vedantic religion took in&#xA;all, and each could choose in what his nature required. A discussion&#xA;followed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

A large number of&#xA;the people attend his classes regularly, and the lectures are most&#xA;interesting. Canon Haweis, one of the leaders of the Anglican Church,&#xA;came the other day, and was much interested. He saw the Swami before, in&#xA;the Chicago fairs, and loved him from that time. On Tuesday last, the&#xA;Swami lectured on &amp;ldquo;Education&amp;rdquo; at the Sesame Club. It is a respectable&#xA;club got up by women for diffusing female education. In this he dealt&#xA;with the old educational system of India, pointed out clearly and&#xA;impressively that, the sole aim of the system was &amp;ldquo;man-making&amp;rdquo; and not&#xA;cramming and compared it with the present system. He held that, the mind&#xA;of the man is an infinite reservoir of knowledge, and all knowledge,&#xA;present, past or future, is within man, manifested or non-manifested,&#xA;and the object of every system of education should be to help the mind&#xA;to manifest it. For instance, the law of gravitation was within man, and&#xA;the fall of the apple helped Newton to think upon it, and bring it out&#xA;from within his mind. His class days have been arranged as follows: —&lt;/p&gt;</description>

At that time a series of Sunday&#xA;lectures was being arranged, and three of these have now been given.&#xA;They are held in one of the galleries of the Royal Institute of Painters&#xA;in water colours, 191 Piccadilly, and have been so far remarkably&#xA;successful in attaining their object, that of reaching people who, from&#xA;one reason or another, cannot attend the class talks. The first of the&#xA;series was &amp;ldquo;The Necessity of Religion&amp;rdquo;. (Cf. Mr. J. J. Goodwin&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;published transcript &lt;a href=&#34;../../../volume_2/jnana-yoga/the_necessity_of_religion.htm&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Necessity of&#xA;Religion&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; ,&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Complete Works&lt;/em&gt;, II: 57-69.) The Swami claimed that religion is and has&#xA;been the greatest force in moulding the destinies of the human race.&#xA;Concerning its origin he said that either of the two theories, (1)&#xA;Spirit origin, (2) Search after the infinite, will meet the case, and,&#xA;to his mind, neither contradicts the other, because the search after the&#xA;departed of the Egyptians and Babylonians, and the attempt to peep&#xA;behind the veil of the dawn, the evening, the thunderstorm, or other&#xA;natural phenomena, of the Aryans, can both be included as a search after&#xA;the super-sensuous, and therefore the unlimited. This unlimited, in the&#xA;course of time became abstracted, first as a person, then as a presence,&#xA;and lastly as the essence of all existence. To his mind the dream state&#xA;is the first suggestion of religious inquiry, and inasmuch as the&#xA;awakened state has always been, and always will be accompanied by the&#xA;dream state, a suggestion of existence finer than that of the awakened&#xA;state yet vanishing during it, the human mind will always be predisposed&#xA;in favour of spiritual existence and a future life. It is in our&#xA;dream-state that we really find, in a sense, our immortality. Later on,&#xA;as dreams are found to be only milder manifestations of the awakened&#xA;state, the search for still deeper planes of the mind begin[s], the&#xA;super-conscious state of the mind. All religions claim to be founded on&#xA;facts discovered in this state. The two important points to consider in&#xA;this connection are, that all facts discovered in this way are, in the&#xA;highest sense, abstractions, and secondly, that there is a constant&#xA;struggle in the race to come up to this ideal, and everything which&#xA;thwarts our progress towards that we feel as a limitation. This struggle&#xA;soon ends in the discovery that to find infinite happiness, or power, or&#xA;knowledge, or any other infinity, through the senses, is impossible, and&#xA;then the struggle for other channels of expansion begins, and we find&#xA;the necessity of religion. The second lecture was upon the subject &amp;ldquo;A&#xA;Universal Religion&amp;rdquo;, (No verbatim transcript available.) when the Swami&#xA;gave, in substance, the lecture which most of your readers have seen in&#xA;print as it was delivered in New York. As this lecture may be termed the&#xA;Swami&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;plan of campaign&amp;rdquo; we always await its delivery with very great&#xA;interest, and it is most encouraging to note that the impression made&#xA;here in London was equally as good as was the case when the lecture was&#xA;delivered in the Hardman Hall, New York. The third of the series brought&#xA;us up to Sunday last, June 21st, when &amp;ldquo;The Real and the Apparent Man&amp;rdquo;&#xA;(Cf. Mr. J. J. Goodwin&amp;rsquo;s published transcript &lt;a href=&#34;../../../volume_2/jnana-yoga/the_real_nature_of_man.htm&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Real Nature of&#xA;Man&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; ,&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Complete Works&lt;/em&gt;, II: 70-87.) was the subject under discussion. In this&#xA;the Swami, link by link, glanced over the thread of thought which has&#xA;gradually advanced from the consideration of men as separate entities&#xA;from God and the rest of the universe, up to the point at which we&#xA;concede the impossibility of more than one Infinity, and the necessary&#xA;consequence that which we now regard as men, as animals, as the universe&#xA;of matter, cannot be the real unity; that the real must be something&#xA;which is indivisible, and unchangeable; and when reason forces us to the&#xA;conclusion that this phenomenal world can only be an illusion, through&#xA;which we, as entities in the illusion, have to pass to discover our real&#xA;nature, &amp;ldquo;That which exists is one; sages call it variously&amp;rdquo;. But the&#xA;Swami did not stop with the theory; he showed what would be the&#xA;practical effect of such a theory, the gradual elimination from society&#xA;of class distinctions, and distinctions be tween man and man, by greater&#xA;unselfishness in the matters of money and power. Answering the objection&#xA;that such a religion means loss of individuality, he argued that that&#xA;which is changeful cannot be the real individuality, and that the&#xA;gradual discovery of the reality behind us would mean the assumption of&#xA;individuality and not its destruction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He has been walking over several parts of the Cis-Alpine country,&#xA;enjoying the pleasing views of nature there. He says that the scenery is&#xA;in no respect less grand than that of the Himalayas. Still, he makes out&#xA;two points of difference between the two mountainous regions. In the&#xA;former the rapid and thick colonization has been marring the beauty of&#xA;the place. In the latter, there has not yet been any such marked&#xA;tendency. The former has become a resort mainly for the sanatorists and&#xA;summer-residents; and the latter mainly for the pilgrims and devotees.&#xA;The Swami is shortly going to visit Germany, where an interview will&#xA;take place with Prof. Deussen, after which, by the 24th of September, he&#xA;will go back to England. To India, most likely, as he says, he is&#xA;returning by the next winter. He intends to reside in the Himalayas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It is a lecture by Swami Vivekananda, delivered in America. The&#xA;lecture is highly interesting and instructive. It is an attempt at a&#xA;reconciliation between the diversity of religions. We hail the booklet&#xA;as the symptom of the times, for it is evident for obvious reasons that&#xA;men are beginning to awaken to the importance of this problem of&#xA;religious harmony. Recently, in these countries leaders of different&#xA;religious sects have attempted in their own way to reconcile this&#xA;religious diversity, and have failed; they have aspired to defend their&#xA;dogmas on the ground of distorted views of sectarianism. Swami&#xA;Vivekananda has propounded a philosophical and at the same time a most&#xA;practical solution of this problem of religious harmony. According to&#xA;him, Vedanta is the bond between the ever conflicting religious&#xA;differences. In the internal world, like the external world, there is&#xA;also the centripetal and centrifugal action. We repel something, we&#xA;attract something. Today we are attracted by some, to-morrow we are&#xA;repelled by some. The same law cannot be applied at all times and in all&#xA;cases. &amp;ldquo;Religion is the highest place of human thought and life, and&#xA;herein the workings of these two forces have been most marked.&amp;rdquo; At the&#xA;outset, it apparently appears that there cannot reign unbroken harmony&#xA;in this plane of mighty struggle. In every religion there are three&#xA;parts, namely, philosophy, mythology and rituals. Every recognised&#xA;religion [has] all these three things. But there can be no universal&#xA;philosophy, mythology and rituals for the whole world. Where then the&#xA;universal ity? How is it possible then to have a universal form of&#xA;religion? &amp;ldquo;We all hear,&amp;rdquo; says Swami Vivekananda,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Mr.&#xA;Hafiz G. Sarwir of St. John&amp;rsquo;s College, took the chair. There were about&#xA;fifty Indians present and a few Englishmen. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Swami Vivekananda rose next to respond [to the toast of India] amidst&#xA;loud and deafening cheers. (There is no verbatim transcript available.&#xA;Cf. the following January 8, 1897 Indian newspaper report, &lt;a href=&#34;15_the_amrita_bazar_patrika_jan_8_1897.htm&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Majlis&#xA;in Cambridge&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; .) The Swami&#xA;began by saying that he did not know exactly why he should be chosen to&#xA;respond to the toast unless it be for the reason that he in physical&#xA;bulk bore a striking resemblance to the national animal of India&#xA;(laughter). He desired to congratulate the guest of the evening and he&#xA;took the statement which the Chairman had made that Mr. Chatterjee was&#xA;going to correct the mistake of past historians of India, to be&#xA;literally true. For out of the past the future must come and he knew no&#xA;greater and more permanent foundation for the future than a true&#xA;knowledge of what had preceded before. The present is the effect of the&#xA;infinity of causes which represent the past. They had many things to&#xA;learn from the Europeans but their past, the glory of India which had&#xA;passed away, should constitute even a still greater source of&#xA;inspiration and instruction. Things rise and things decay, there is rise&#xA;and fall everywhere in the world. . . .

Well, Gentlemen, whether it is &lt;em&gt;Patal&lt;/em&gt; or&#xA;not you ought to decide that by seeing those few ladiespresent here, who&#xA;have come from the country of your so-called &lt;em&gt;Patal&lt;/em&gt;, whether they are&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Naga Kanyas&lt;/em&gt; or not. (Cheers). Now, America is perfectly a new country.&#xA;It was discovered by Columbus, the Italian, and before that a prior&#xA;claim is put forward by the Norwegians who say, that they have&#xA;discovered the northern part of it, and then before that there is&#xA;another prior claim of the Chinese, who at one time preached the noble&#xA;doctrine of Buddhism in all parts of the world, and it is said that&#xA;Buddhist Missionaries were also sent from India to America, and&#xA;specially in Washington, where some sort[s] of records are still to be&#xA;traced by any traveller going there. Well, the table has now been turned&#xA;at last for a century or more and instead of America being discovered,&#xA;she discovers persons that go over to her. (Loud applause). It is a&#xA;phenomenon that we observe every day there, multitudes of persons coming&#xA;over from every part of the country [world?] and getting themselves&#xA;discovered in the United States. It is a fact, well-known to you here&#xA;all that several of our own countrymen have been discovered in that way.&#xA;(Cheers). To-day, here I present before you one of your Calcutta boys,&#xA;that has been similarly discovered by the Americans. (Cheers).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Well, Gentlemen, whether it is &lt;em&gt;Patal&lt;/em&gt; or&#xA;not you ought to decide that by seeing those few ladiespresent here, who&#xA;have come from the country of your so-called &lt;em&gt;Patal&lt;/em&gt;, whether they are&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Naga Kanyas&lt;/em&gt; or not. (Cheers). Now, America is perfectly a new country.&#xA;It was discovered by Columbus, the Italian, and before that a prior&#xA;claim is put forward by the Norwegians who say, that they have&#xA;discovered the northern part of it, and then before that there is&#xA;another prior claim of the Chinese, who at one time preached the noble&#xA;doctrine of Buddhism in all parts of the world, and it is said that&#xA;Buddhist Missionaries were also sent from India to America, and&#xA;specially in Washington, where some sort[s] of records are still to be&#xA;traced by any traveller going there. Well, the table has now been turned&#xA;at last for a century or more and instead of America being discovered,&#xA;she discovers persons that go over to her. (Loud applause). It is a&#xA;phenomenon that we observe every day there, multitudes of persons coming&#xA;over from every part of the country [world?] and getting themselves&#xA;discovered in the United States. It is a fact, well-known to you here&#xA;all that several of our own countrymen have been discovered in that way.&#xA;(Cheers). To-day, here I present before you one of your Calcutta boys,&#xA;that has been similarly discovered by the Americans. (Cheers).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../../../index.htm&#34;&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt; /&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;../../../complete_works.htm&#34;&gt;Complete-Works&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&#34;../../volume_9_contents.htm&#34;&gt;Volume&#xA;9&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&#34;../newspaper_reports_contents.htm&#34;&gt;Newspaper&#xA;Reports&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&#34;indian_newspaper_contents.htm&#34;&gt;Indian Newspaper&#xA;Reports&lt;/a&gt; /&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;The Indian Mirror&lt;/em&gt;, February 15, 1901]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A correspondent writes: — &amp;ldquo;The following is an epitome of Swami&#xA;Vivekananda&amp;rsquo;s speech made in Belur M.E. School on the prize-distribution&#xA;day held on the 22nd instant, Sunday, when the Swami was invited to&#xA;preside. The audience was composed chiefly of the boys of the school and&#xA;some elderly gentlemen of Belur.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The modern student is not practical. He is quite helpless. What our&#xA;students want is not so much muscularity of body as hardihood. They are&#xA;wanting in self-help. They are not accustomed to use their eyes and&#xA;hands. No handicraft is taught. The present system of English education&#xA;is entirely literary. The student must be made to think for himself and&#xA;work for himself. Suppose there is a fire. He is the first to come&#xA;forward and put on [out] the fire who is accustomed to use his eyes&#xA;and hands. There is much truth in the criticism of Europeans touching&#xA;the laziness of the Bengali, the slipshod way of his doing things. This&#xA;can be soon remedied if the students be made to learn some handicraft&#xA;apart from its utilitarian aspect, it is an education in itself.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Secondly, how many thousands of students I know who live upon the worst&#xA;food possible, and live amidst the most horrible surroundings, what&#xA;wonder that there are so many idiots, imbeciles and cowards among them.&#xA;They die like flies. The education that is given is onesided, weakening,&#xA;it is killing by inches. The children are made to cram too much of&#xA;useless matter, and are incarcerated in school rooms fifty or seventy in&#xA;each, five hours together. They are given bad food. It is forgotten that&#xA;the future health of the man is in the child. It is forgotten that&#xA;nature can never be cheated and things cannot be pushed too early. In&#xA;giving education to a child the law of growth has to be obeyed. And we&#xA;must learn to wait. Nothing is more important than that the child must&#xA;have a strong and healthy body. The body is the first thing to attain to&#xA;virtue. I know we are the poorest nation in the world, and we cannot&#xA;afford to do much. We can only work on the lines of least resistance. We&#xA;should see at least that our children are well fed. The machine of the&#xA;child&amp;rsquo;s body should never be exhausted. In Europe and America a man with&#xA;crores of rupees sends his son if sickly, to the farmers, to till the&#xA;ground. After three years he returns to the father healthy, rosy and&#xA;strong. Then he is fit to be sent to school. We ought not for these&#xA;reasons push the present system of education any further.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Thirdly, our character has disappeared. Our English education has&#xA;destroyed everything and left nothing in its place. Our children have&#xA;lost their politeness. To talk nicely is degrading. To be reverential to&#xA;one&amp;rsquo;s elders is degrading. Irreverence has been the sign of liberty. It&#xA;is high time that we go back to our old politeness. The reformers have&#xA;nothing to give in place of what they have taken away. Yet in spite of&#xA;the most adverse surrounding of climate, etc., we have been able to do&#xA;much, we have to do much more. I am proud of my race, I do not despair,&#xA;I am seeing daily a glorious and wonderful future in my menial&#xA;[mental] visions. Take greatest care of these young ones on whom our&#xA;future depends.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Cf. two American newspaper articles&#xA;published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../../volume_2/reports_in_american_newspapers/indias_gift_to_the_world.htm&#34;&gt;Complete&#xA;Works&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;, II: 510-14 for somewhat different reports of this issue.) he spoke of&#xA;the Hindu widows, declaring it unjust to state that they were generally&#xA;subjected to cruelty or oppression in the Indians [&lt;em&gt;sic&lt;/em&gt;] homes. He&#xA;admitted that the prejudice against remarriage, and the custom which&#xA;makes the widow a member of the husband&amp;rsquo;s family instead of that of her&#xA;own parents inflicted some hardships upon widows in India, and favoured&#xA;wise efforts for their education which would render them self-supporting&#xA;and in this way alleviate their condition. He emphasised his desire for&#xA;the education and elevation of the women of his country, including the&#xA;widows, by volunteering to give the entire proceeds of one of his&#xA;lectures in support of the school of Babu Sasipada Banerjee, at&#xA;Baranagar, near Calcutta, the institution of which preceded that of the&#xA;Pandita Ramabai, at Poona, and where, if I am not mistaken, the Pandita&#xA;herself obtained the first inspiration of her work. This lecture was&#xA;given, and the proceeds were forwarded to Babu Sasipada Banerjee, and&#xA;duly acknowledged.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
