      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/blog_supplement/status/1902196040775684305&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Modern H nationalism has at least one bifurcation:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A cultural one, which the lATapati emphasized to Fridman, and&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A genuinely theocratic one, which due to weak philosophical foundations is never satisfactorily articulated by its proponents.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In #1 there is v.little foundational theology or moorings to orthodoxy; hence, it can simultaneously accommodate the various contradictory or opposing streams that the QT mentions. It sees all of them as valid expressions of a culture that should be celebrated. bauddha or jaina can be celebrated even if they are in opposition to the sanAtana way because the cultural nationalist sees some soft power value in them. It is true they can still be vehicles of the sanAtana. A discerning race, like the Japanese, was able to see the sanAtana essence borne by the bauddha vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
