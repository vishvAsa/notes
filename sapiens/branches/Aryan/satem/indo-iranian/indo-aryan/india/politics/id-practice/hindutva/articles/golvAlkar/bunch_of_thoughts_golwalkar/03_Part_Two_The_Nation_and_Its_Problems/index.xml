      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nation, a positive concept-What modern scholars say-Hindu child of Bharat-Community of culture, history, etc.-Hence, Hindu Nation-Non Hindus and test of nationality-Not nurture but culture counts-Call to non-Hindus-Revive spirit of assimilation-Non-Hindu in Hindu Rashtra-Basis for national integration.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DR. KESHAV BALIRAM HEDGEWAR, founder of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, was from his early boyhood intensely devoted to the cause of nation and was in the thick of the various movements going on at that time for the liberation of our motherland. He was engrossed for several years in the revolutionary movement. He later on plunged into the agitations and organisational work of the Indian National Congress.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-territorial-nationalism-its-roots&#34;&gt;1. TERRITORIAL NATIONALISM: ITS ROOTS&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why the word &amp;lsquo;Rashtriya&amp;rsquo; - The British game - Effects of English education - History distorted-Birth of &amp;rsquo;territorial nationalism&amp;rsquo;-Its absurdity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Much thought was devoted to the subject before the name &amp;lsquo;Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh&amp;rsquo; was decided upon for the organisation. A number of persons close to the Sangh were also consulted. Naturally, many suggestions were put forth, and objections raised against each name. Even the present name was confronted with the objection that if the word &amp;lsquo;Rashtriya&amp;rsquo; was adopted then its doors would have to be kept open to all other people in the country, i.e., Muslims, Christians, etc. So the name &amp;lsquo;Hindu Swayamsevak Sangh&amp;rsquo; was suggested, as the organisation was restricted only to the Hindus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Secularists&amp;rsquo; and Hindu nationalism - Fear complex, root of &amp;lsquo;Hindu-Muslim&amp;rsquo; bhai-bhai&amp;rsquo; - Story with a moral - Ingrained conviction of Hindu Nationalism - Even truth requires &amp;lsquo;proof&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We are witnessing a strange phenomenon in our country today. The real and positive concept of Hindu Nationalism is being dubbed as communal, reactionary, narrow-minded and so on and the unscientific, reactionary and harmful theory of territorial nationalism, upheld by our present-day leaders, is paraded as &amp;lsquo;secular&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;progressive&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;broad- minded&amp;rsquo;. But, apart form this cloud of political dust that has been raised, is it true that in their heart of hearts the so-called &amp;lsquo;secularists&amp;rsquo; differ fundamentally from us?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-hindu-rashtra-and-minorities&#34;&gt;1. HINDU RASHTRA AND &amp;ldquo;MINORITIES&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Give up notions of &amp;ldquo;religious minority&amp;rdquo;-Example of Indonesia, Turkey, etc.-Benevolent tradition of Hindu Rashtra -Examples.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answer to the so-called problem of &amp;lsquo;religious minorities&amp;rsquo; can be found only in the historically correct, rational and positive approach of Hindu Rashtra. Otherwise, the so- called minorities are bound to become more and more hardened in their separate shells of religion and turn into a dreadful source of disruption of our body-politic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Real connotation of terms &amp;lsquo;National&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Integration&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Communal&amp;rsquo;, etc.- &amp;ldquo;Majority Communalism&amp;rdquo; a fallacious term - Seven types of communalism - Perversion due to sectarian over-attachment - The ways and means to tackle communalism: National smaskars for all; Giving up wrong language policy; Unitary State; Stopping aggressive acts - Ways of real assimilation - RSS mission of Integration.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our True National Life&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The national life of Bharat is an ancient one. The social life here has been woven round a cultural tradition imbued with common life-ideals stemming out of a common comprehensive life-philosophy. This has been a living tradition since ages, well before the Islamic and Christian invaders stepped on this soil. The thread of inherent unity has never snapped in spite of apparent distinctions and dissensions among castes, creeds, sects and even political kingdoms. The human group, which has been expressing this unified current of life has been popularly known as the &amp;ldquo;Hindu&amp;rdquo;. The national life in Bharat is therefore the Hindu National Life.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What is &amp;ldquo;Intergration&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-the-muslims&#34;&gt;1. THE MUSLIMS&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Muslims after Partition-Twofold strategy: direct aggression: swelling members - our leaders policy, violence pays - The time-bomb - forgetting nothing, learning nothing - Miniature Pakistans - &amp;lsquo;National Muslims&amp;rsquo; exposed - Face Reality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It has been the tragic lesson of the history of many a country in the world that the hostile elements within the country pose a far greater menace to national security than aggressors from outside. Unfortunately, this first lesson of national security has been the one thing, which has been consistently ignored in our country ever since the British left this land. Wishful thinking born out of lack of courage to face realities, mouthing of high-sounding slogans by the persons at the helm of affairs to cover up the tragedies overtaking us one after another, and opportunistic alliances of parties and groups with the hostile elements to further their narrow self-interests, have all combined to make the threat of internal subversion of our national freedom and security very acute and real.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
