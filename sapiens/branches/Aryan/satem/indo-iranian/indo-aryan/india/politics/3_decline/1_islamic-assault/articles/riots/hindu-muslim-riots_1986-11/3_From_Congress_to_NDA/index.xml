      <description>&lt;p&gt;89% Hindus, 9% Muslims&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Chief Minister of Gujarat: Narendra Modi, BJP, October 2001–&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The state of Gujarat witnessed one of the worst cases of mass violence in Indian history. While government accounts reported around 850 deaths, it is likely that more than two thousand people, overwhelmingly Muslims, lost their lives in what has been called the «first state-led pogrom» in India. Every report on these events indicated that the riot was well-planned and sponsored by the BJP-led Gujarat administration and its chief minister, Narendra Modi. The violence was preceded by concerted attempts to identify Muslim houses and shops in Ahmedabad and other of the state&amp;rsquo;s cities and villages.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
