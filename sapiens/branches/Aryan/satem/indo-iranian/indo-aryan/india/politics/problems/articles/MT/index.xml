      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://unrollthread.com/t/1632996628054376451/&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The so-called judiciary reforms which are taking place in some western/West Asian countries are catching people&amp;rsquo;s attention. We have a very different geopolitical perspective on it. We see it as ultimately a defensive reaction to the spread of navyonmAda &amp;amp; its auxiliaries with the on-ground backing by the ShaNDasainya, kAlAmukha-s, annadAtR^i-s etc &amp;amp; financed by the sora, kR^iShNAdri-phuka &amp;amp; others.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The case of Canada illustrates what can happen when the sorAdiduShTa-s succeed: you get to place a kAstra-putra on the Asandi &amp;amp; take full control of its operations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
