Husainsab, the raja of Roza and Pooja, is on song during Sri Rama Navami

Come Ramanavami, and the first that comes to mind is majjige, paanaka and kosambari (buttermilk, fruit juice and salads). But Ramanavami is also eagerly awaited by Bengalureans as it kick-starts a series of musical concerts across the city. Musicians from across India descend on the city to perform; and particularly one among them is in high demand – B Husainsab Kanakagiri, a Muslim whose Hindu devotional songs are a big hit.

Husainsab Kanakagiri performs on Sri Rama Navami

A great devotee of Allah and Vishnu, Husainsab, who has been a veteran in Hindustani music, renders devotional literature of Shri Vishnu and other Dasa Kritis in temples and maths all over India, and many compositions are his own.

He is known for spreading the popularity of Haridasa Sahithya with his enthralling renditions everywhere.

Sixty-two-year-old Husainsab believes he is a true secular and observes fasting on Ekadasi as well as during the holy month of Ramzan.

Husainsab hails from a remote village called Kanakagiri in Koppal district, North Karnataka, where his music education of every kind since his childhood has come down to him from his grandparents and forefathers.

Husainsab told Bangalore Mirror: “I have read Bhagavad Gita as much as Quran, and I have a proper understanding of the stories; that is how it has become my passion towards singing Dasa Kritis.”

Then he adds: 

> “There should not be any discrimination in literature, music and arts. They are the language of a man and his soul. Anyone can practice and perform whatever he/she is interested in.

> “Although I am a Muslim by birth, I am a true human being, a great devotee of Shri Hari. I see Hari in Allah and Allah in Hari. My spiritual Guru is Shri Murugunda Krishnadas and I gained my expertise in music under Vidwan Shri Devappayya Kakhandaki who is a household name in Hindustani music from Bijapur.”

Husainsab says that although there is so much negative portrayal about Hindu-Muslim relations, there are actually more real-life stories about harmony between the two commities, which go unnoticed. He cites the recent example wherein he was invited to render a music composition at the Sri Raghavendra Swamy Mutt in Jogeshwari, Mumbai. “The Mutt had come up in a Muslim-dominated area, but the entire Muslim community actually played host for the Mutt programme by helping the mutt officials in their chores, including setting up the stage.


We actually have numerous such examples of Hindu-Muslim brotherhood, which needs to be promoted.” Husainsab talks about philosophy and literature like a man who has gulped down an ocean full of literature. His passion for singing Daasara Padagalu, Tatttvapadagalu, and Kritis of the saints dates back to his childhood. “During my childhood, there were poems sung in the name of Rama and Allah together. Our gurus nurtured this secularism within us and that is why we are carrying forward the same legacy since then. “That is why I am so involved in every line I sing. I know the importance of every verse and what has been in the history.” Husainsab has gained great recognition and reputation in various maths in the city.

Officials from Sri Rama Temple at RC Puram, Bengaluru, say, 

> “We value his knowledge and the faith in God that he has. Because of his conviction, he sings so well that the audience tap out talas syncing with his rendition.”

He has rendered his devotional compositions in temples and maths all over the country including Tirupati, Mantralaya, Udupi and Hampi.

He has also got an international exposure at London in Bharatiya Vidya Peeth. Krishna Murthy, a temple official from Bengaluru, said, “With simple Kannada that he speaks and the deep understanding of Haridasa literature and philosophy, Husainsab creates a devotional ambience wherever he performs.” He has received prestigious awards like, “Gayana Gangadhara”, “Ragayogi”, “Pratibha Shree”, “Vishwaroopa Rashtriya Utsava Prashasthi”, “Karnataka Rajyothsava Prashasthi-1999” and “Kempegowda Puraskara from BBMP- 2012”, to name just a few.

Working in a private firm, Husainsab also heads many social organisations, like Haridasa Seva Samiti, Vijayaraya Seva Samiti in Raichur and district representative of Karnataka Gamaka Kala Parishad. His own composed albums include, “Dasavani”, “Kayo Kaveri Ranga”, “Kori Karevevu Guru Shri Raghavendrane”, and many more.

> “I am thankful to my family, because they have always been a supporting hand in my performances. All my three sons are engineers. Only one, Habibsab, is interested in singing film songs. He is not into classical or devotional. One must have a thirst to learn the Kritis, only then he/she can sing. In case he learns, I would definitely perform with him one day.”

## 2017 Enarada
When a Muslim girl sang Hindu devotional songs in Zee TV’s Sa Re Ga Ma Pa, there were threats from various corners asking her not to do sing other religious songs. However, here is a Muslim singer who has been singing Hindu devotional songs for decades. In fact, he is not just a singer but a true secular figure as he observes fast on both Ekadasi and Ramzan!

Meet Mr B Husainsab Kanakagiri, an expert singer in Dasa Sahitya (literature of bhakti movement composed by devotees in honour of Lord Vishnu or one of his Avatars) who is in great demand by Hindu scholars and maths by organising his concerts. Hailing from Kanakagiri village, Koppal district, Husainsab developed keen interest towards devotional music since his childhood. He says that he used to frequent temples in his village and join the bhajan mandal and this is where he got his formal training and inspiration to turn his passion into profession.

Speaking exclusively to Enarada.com, Husainsab said, 

> “I will never miss my roja and namaz but this will never stop me from singing Hindu devotional songs. There are people in both religions who appreciate true secularism. For example, my songs are revered by Hindus and I can recall an incident when I had been to Sri Raghavendraswamy Math in Jogeshwari, Mumbai. The Math is located at a place dominated by Muslims and you may not find a single Hindu house near the place. However, when the Math’s function was being organised, all the local Muslims had gathered for the programme not just as guests but also as hosts as they were seen serving tea to adjusting the dais. This is the perfect example of communal harmony. I am pained to see how people fight for religion but I want to ask people what is one’s Dharma-is observing Ekadasi or Ramzan? For me, the real dharma is one who believes in true god and also respects others’ faith.”
