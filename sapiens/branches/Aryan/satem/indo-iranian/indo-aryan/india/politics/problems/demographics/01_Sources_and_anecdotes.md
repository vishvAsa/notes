## Fudging of census data
- Census data show that Christian population DROPPED by 5% in AP between 2011 and 2001 (1129784/1,181,917). Anyone who believes, knowing the ground reality, this is a fool. AP has been the center of evangelism in South India for 10+ years with churches everywhere and every place, evangelist posters all over including remote villages.
- "The ‘adjusted data’, which was unlawfully manufactured by deleting 3.67 crore Indians living in Assam and Jammu & Kashmir, showed that in percentage terms the Muslim population was growing barely at 29.5 percent as against 36 percent increase revealed during the actual headcount. ... There is an asterix marked footnote below the Statement 1-a of the Religion-wise data of Census 2001 which gives the proportion and growth rate of the respective population of religious communities for the last four decades from 1961 to 2001. The footnote clearly states that it “excludes Jammu & Kashmir and Assam for all decades from 1961 to 2001”.

- Crypto-christians stay officially hindus to get SC benefits.

## Highlights and anecdotes
- "The census 2001 data of the 6 year-old cohorts clearly shows that in 31 States and Union Territories of Indian Republic, out of a total of 35, the Muslim population will grow at a faster clip than that of Hindus." (Esp. Assam, Kerala, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar)
- "The classic example is Haryana where Muslims have increased to 8% of total population from 2% within 6 decades. A further four-fold increase in the next few decades shall take them to 32% of population." \[[SP](https://vajrin.wordpress.com/2015/02/10/demography-elections-and-memetic-viruses/)\]
- TN 2015: "they're buying land and building a mosque every 3 kms along every highway, purportedly for the convenience of travellers, but this can be used as choke points."
