      <description>&lt;p&gt;The driving urges of modern societies: &amp;ldquo;permissiveness&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;competition&amp;rdquo; – Both lead to social disruption, conflicts, wars-Result: destruction of peace. Ex: Western colonization-&amp;ldquo;Increasing standard of living&amp;rdquo; leads man away from happiness-Source of real happiness not in outside objects, but within-The way: Cessation of desires-Highest state. Moksha-‘Chatuvidha Purushartha’ offers the final solution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The driving urges of modern societies: &amp;ldquo;permissiveness&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;competition&amp;rdquo; – Both lead to social disruption, conflicts, wars-Result: destruction of peace.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Birth of Democracy as a reaction – The evil of Capitalism – Next reaction, Communism – Falsity of its prophecy and promise, ex: Russia – Both theories shifting from original stand – Both stemming from materialism – Failure as a theory – Wrong concept of equality – Our view of individual and society – Man, not system, important. ,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After the British have left our country we are faced with the problem of deciding the right pattern for our future national reconstruction. There are two major patterns of social set-up which are in vogue in the modern world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>04 IV For a Right Structure : Political and Economic</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Present system of elections defective – True representatives do not come up – Couple territorial with functional representation – Make Panchayat election unanimous – socialism leads to slavery-Theory of trusteeship-Striking a balance between individual incentive and decentralisation of wealth-Hindu values, the backbone of success&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our country has now opted for the democratic structure. But if this arrangement has to succeed, it is essential that the common mass of people should be properly educated and enlightened. Making them mere literates will not serve the purpose. They have to be made aware of their role and responsibilities with respect to the various aspects of our national life such as politics, economics, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Revival, not reaction- Culture, indefinable yet all-absorbing- Nation as God- True spirit of service- Not rights but duty- Unity in diversity- To raise the average- Present perversions- Watering roots of immortality&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our concept of Hindu Nation is not a mere bundle of political and economic rights. It is essentially cultural. Our ancient and sublime cultural values of life form its life-breath. And it is only an intense rejuvenation of the spirit of our culture that can give us the true vision of our national life, and a fruitful direction to all our efforts in solving the innumerable problems confronting our nation today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our unique concept of glory – Fourfold achievement – Dharma for individual development and social solidarity – Materialism end in misery - What made us world teachers – Organised strength for attaining and maintaining glory – Right men for organisation&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our one supreme goal is to bring to life the all-round glory and greatness of our Hindu Rashtra. In order to have a correct grasp of this goal, we should understand what exactly this &amp;ldquo;great glory&amp;rdquo;, param vaibhavam as we call it in our Prathana, connotes. Then we have also to understand how to attain and maintain that glorious condition of our nation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>07 VII Live Positive Dynamic Hinduism</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The indefinable ‘Hindu’ – Aim : God Realisation – Special features – Our unique standard-bearers – Need to manifest ideals in daily life – Effects of ‘reactionary Hinduism’ – Role of daily samskars – Fad of modernism – Hindu ideals in all spheres – Live National Swadharma&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When we say that the Sangh is dedicated to the rejuvenation of the great and unique Hindu way of life, there are many who confront us with the question, &amp;ldquo;First of of all, how do you define a ‘Hindu’?&amp;rdquo; Well, it is really a tough job. Once a gentleman remarked &amp;ldquo;I can define a ‘Mussalman’ or a ‘Christian’, but I cannot define a ‘Hindu’.&amp;rdquo; He was right when he said so. We can define the Sun and the Moon, but the ultimate Reality from which all these things have emerged cannot be defined. But does it mean that it does not exist? Merely because it refuses to be clothed in symbols and defies definition, does it prove Its non-existence? Sri Ramakrishna has said that God alone is &amp;ldquo;anuchhishtha&amp;rdquo;, pure and undefined, because He alone has never been described, never been defiled by any tongue. Everything else we can define, but not that all-comprehensive something called Reality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Short-cut mania – Lure of politics – Warning of history – Secret of our undying potency – Inspiration for national rejuvenation – Power corrupts – Restraints on power – Effects of combination of political and economic powers – Lesson of Europe – Sangh building people’s power – Upholding national genius.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The ultimate vision of our work, which has been a living inspiration for all our organisational efforts, is a perfectly organised state of our society wherein each individual has been moulded into a model of ideal Hindu manhood and made into a living limb of the corporate personality of society.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
