That vyApArAmAtya +++(=Commerce secretary)+++ of the pichChilaka has essentially spelled out that the mahAmlechCha want to reduce India to vassalage: pa~nchanetraka-s as svabhAvavairin-s Hopefully, the lATapati and his court are prepared to deal with harm coming their way. Expectations: 

1. Support for TSP & TSB. 
2. Undermining the rUs and preventing H from arming themselves with rUsastra-s. 
3. Tacit Galtonism. 
4. Incitementment of paTTaroga. 
5. Economic warfare by various means not limited to tariffs. 
   
pichChilaka's 2nd term will essentially continue the harm through means other than the ShaNDsainya that was favored by the sora-backed gardabhin-s.

## 2023
The sabhA of piNDaka will be there when India has its general elections. piNDaka's backers seem to have figured out vijayanAma-vyApArin. anugAmin looks lackluster &they would prevent karNATa from playing. So unless the mahAmlechCha hastin-s pull of s dramatic win, the H deep state has to plan for a long haul even if the lATeshvara manages to win 2024. ardhakR^iShNa has not said anything unexpected -- as we have been saying for years the marUnmatta is the glove which covers the mlechCha fist.  Moreover mahAmlechCha religion of ShaNDavAda cannot prevail against marUnmatta-s who will make short work of them. However, ShaNDavAda will weaken the H as they are way more susceptible to it. Even LJ can be seen as a manifestation of same root psychosocio-pathology that drives the pogaNDarug.
