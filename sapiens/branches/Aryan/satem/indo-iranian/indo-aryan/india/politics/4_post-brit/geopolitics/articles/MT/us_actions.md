## 2025

As we have remarked repeatedly: the undergirdings of Anglo-Abrahmospheric power and the H as a heathen civilization have a deep-rooted incompatibility. Sooner or later, this will come to a head. One can easily predict that the mahAmlechCha and their vassals will try to destabilize the Indian state as they have done many times in the past using their marUnmatta, preta and paTTa force transmitters. It seems the laTapati has read this and is ready to make a stand. Hope, he succeeds.

### Post sindoor
> After Sindoor, something in Indo-US relations seems to have broken, permanently. The "let's pretend" game is over.

Probabaly Sindoor exposed what was already in place due to the deep state machinations. The interesting thing is that the general expectation was that things would improve with nAri~Nga because he would not push the indrAyudhadhvaja politics on India. However, what was missed was that in his ranks were at least 4 antagonistic types: 

1. the old pro-TSP faction (also found in gajalaNDapura); 
2. the trade warriors with a natural dislike for rising manufacture in India; 
3. The shvetonnata-s who have a natural dislike for the Indian race as dark-skinned people (part of MAGA base: see reactions to viveka); 
4. The pretasAdhaka-s who are svabhAvavairin-s of H.

What we are seeing a coalescence of these factors. The H have already faced a humiliating defeat once at the hands of this dala of the mlechCha world (the English conquest) and hopefully their leadership can prevent that from happening again with the mahAmlechcha. This time they would act most through their marUnmatta, preta and nIladrApeya proxies with a Galtonian edge to top it off.


### Trade ultimatum
That vyApArAmAtya +++(=Commerce secretary)+++ of the pichChilaka has essentially spelled out that the mahAmlechCha want to reduce India to vassalage: pa~nchanetraka-s as svabhAvavairin-s Hopefully, the lATapati and his court are prepared to deal with harm coming their way. Expectations: 

1. Support for TSP & TSB. 
2. Undermining the rUs and preventing H from arming themselves with rUsastra-s. 
3. Tacit Galtonism. 
4. Incitementment of paTTaroga. 
5. Economic warfare by various means not limited to tariffs. 

#### Rejection
The mahAmlechCha as successors of the English empire within the Anglo-Abrahmosphere, now think they are still ruling that old empire -- the temerity they have to order India as to which nations it should trade and have relationships with. 

It should be noted that they are a highly vengeful and destructive force. Hence, hopefully, the H leadership is ready to preserve and assert H sovereignty as they take steps to ruin it.
   
### 2nd term
pichChilaka's 2nd term will essentially continue the harm through means other than the ShaNDsainya that was favored by the sora-backed gardabhin-s.

## 2023
The sabhA of piNDaka will be there when India has its general elections. piNDaka's backers seem to have figured out vijayanAma-vyApArin. anugAmin looks lackluster &they would prevent karNATa from playing. So unless the mahAmlechCha hastin-s pull of s dramatic win, the H deep state has to plan for a long haul even if the lATeshvara manages to win 2024. ardhakR^iShNa has not said anything unexpected -- as we have been saying for years the marUnmatta is the glove which covers the mlechCha fist.  Moreover mahAmlechCha religion of ShaNDavAda cannot prevail against marUnmatta-s who will make short work of them. However, ShaNDavAda will weaken the H as they are way more susceptible to it. Even LJ can be seen as a manifestation of same root psychosocio-pathology that drives the pogaNDarug.
