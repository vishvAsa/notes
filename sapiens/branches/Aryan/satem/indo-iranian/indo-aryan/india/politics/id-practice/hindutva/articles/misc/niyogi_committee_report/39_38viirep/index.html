To-The Chairman, Christian Missionary Activities Enquiry Committee, Madhya Pradesh, Nagpur.
Sir,
With reference to your Questionnaire under notification No. 318-716-V-Con., dated the 14th April 1954, we enclose herewith our replies.
From the facts narrated you will please note that the activities of the foreign Christian Missionary are very harmful. The Jabalpur Christians in their resolution appearing in the “Amrit Bazar Patrika”, dated the 27th November 1954, desired the Government to wind up your Enquiry also. They were apparently working under the leadership of the foreign missionaries. You will, therefore, kindly urge upon ’the Government to ask the foreign Christian Missionaries to quit India at once.">

  <p><strong>Replies submitted by Shri Sohanlal Aggarwal, Secretary, Vedic
Sanskriti Raksha Samiti.</strong></p>
<p>To-The Chairman, Christian Missionary Activities Enquiry Committee,
Madhya Pradesh, Nagpur.</p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>With reference to your Questionnaire under notification No.
318-716-V-Con., dated the 14th April 1954, we enclose herewith our
replies.</p>
<p>From the facts narrated you will please note that the activities of the
foreign Christian Missionary are very harmful.  The Jabalpur Christians
in their resolution appearing in the “Amrit Bazar Patrika”, dated the
27th November 1954, desired the Government to wind up your Enquiry
also.  They were apparently working under the leadership of the foreign
missionaries.  You will, therefore, kindly urge upon &rsquo;the Government to

<p><strong>Replies</strong></p>
<p>1. It is difficult to give answer to all parts of the question, because
all the figures are not available from the Government statistics.  In
1941 the total Christian population of the district was 12,354.  Out of
these only 181 came from the rural area.  In 1951 these figures stood at
9,890, for the whole of the district, total district population being
9,10,603 in 1951 and 1,054 for the rural area.  These figures include
the Anglo-Indians and the foreigners.  This reduction is due to the
foreign army, its dependents Anglo-Indians and the foreign Christians
leaving the district in 1947 before and after.  But in the rural area
the increase in figures is 582.3 per cent.  In 1947 the foreign
Christians had prepared themselves to leave the country on account of
expected political difficulties, but as the Republic was declared
secular they again thought of remaining in the country and started their
conspiracies as before and even with greater force.  There are no
statistics to show the increase from year to year but in the Ranital
Ward about 300 Harijans have been very recently converted to
Christianity.  In this work one Jacob Missionary from the Leonard
Theological College has played a great part because the converted and
the said Missionary are both Malabari.</p>
<p>2. The above rise is due to ignorance and the social and economic
difficulties of the Scheduled Castes and Tribes, and also the
enticements given and the propaganda made by the Christian Missionary.</p>
<p>3. It is difficult to give the statistics.  Approximate estimation is
at 7,000.</p>
<p>CONVERSIONS</p>
<p>4. It is difficult to give the statistics.  But it is true, that they
have been steadily increasing since the year 1947. The year’s average
increase is estimated at 600 if which 577 are estimated to belong to the
Scheduled and the Tribal Castes.</p>
<p>5. People are converted individually as well as in groups.  In the case
of a married couple, husband and wife have both to be converted,
otherwise in many cases only the head of the family is converted.</p>

<p>Of these missions the most active now is the Yehova Witnesses, with
their headquarters at Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society Incorporated,
International Bible Students Association, Brooklyn, New York, founded on
the 26th of July 1931.  Their publications are not issued in less than
25 lakhs.  No price is written on any of these books.  It depends on the
local selling agents to get the maximum out of the customer by using
their talents.  The book referred in these answers “What Religion has
done for Mankind” has been sold by ladies, selling the books of this
mission from Rs. 2-8-0 to Rs. 5 each.</p>
<p>The agents of the above said Missions approach the people individually
as also in groups.</p>
<p>7. The Head missionaries are always from foreign countries.
Subordinate preachers are Indians also.  Their wages are from Rs. 50 to
Rs. 500 and even more.  They are rewarded for bringing in greater number
of converts. They get many other facilities like housing accommodation,
cars, petrol, travelling allowance, financing picnics and other
activities.</p>
<p>8. (a) Yes.  Usually a bond is taken for the money advanced with
interest to be paid.  The verbal agreement is that if the convert does
not leave Christianity the bond would not be put into effect. Usually
the rate of interest is very high.</p>
<p>(b) Yes.  The Sisters who go to the mohallas distribute medicines free
of cost. One D. P. Lazarus also distributes medicines free.</p>
<p>(c) Yes.  Statements should be taken from the students residing in the
Christian Brotherhood Hostel of the Christian Mission School.  They are
all supported by missionaries of their native places.  All such local
students are exported.  This applies to all other institutions.</p>
<p>(d) Yes.</p>
<p>(e) Yes.  Reference may be made to the lessons issued by the Bible
School, Voice of Prophecy, Poona and Jeewan Prakash Susamachar School,
Jhansi. (Some relevant documents are enclosed.)</p>
<p>(f) Yes. For instance one Jalim Singh working in G. C. F. One.</p>
<p>(g) Yes. Dalchand Jain working in O. F. K.</p>
<p>(h) Yes. The entire literature issued by the Catholic and Protestant
Churches.</p>
<p>(i) Yes. The Christian Literature stands as witness.</p>
<p>(j) Yes. The most glaring instance is of the book “What Religion has
done for Mankind”.</p>
<p>(k) Yes. All Scheduled and Tribal people were converted by holding out
hopes of political, social and economic advantages.</p>
<p>(l) Yes. This is done in the case of the above.</p>
<p>(m) (i) Christ is shown out as the Kali Awtar of the Puranas and other
Indian literature. (ii) Jesus is represented as Ishu, which with its
variations occurs in the Vedic and the Upanishidic Literature, e.g., the
Missionaries quote the first ‘richa’ of the 40th Chapter of the
Yajurveda and the “Ishopanashid” saying that Jesus is there in the
Indian Literature also. (iii) Bible is shown out “shruti” and its
teachings acceptable to the Hindus as a “Shruti Praman”. (iv) The Indian
Christian Missionaries show themselves to be Hindus of high caste; they
narrate their stories of conversion of Christianity in a very wonderful
manner.  One S. K. Pandit moves about the houses of the high caste
Hindus and shows himself to be a Brahmin.  Similarly in the houses of
the Mohammedans, Christian Missionaries go out under the names of
Ibrahim, etc.  In the cities now no change is made in the original names
whereas in the villages names are. changed to Christian ones.  In their
Question Paper No. 32 the School of Voice of Prophecy, Poona, after
having taken in writing from the student that he accept Jesus and other
cognate Christian principles as pillars of his life except the student
to accept their representative who would travel, from Poona to the
Students place at his own cost in order that the Mission may help the
student further in his studies in Bible.  They expect the student to
become the messenger of Christ.  The school represents to the student
that special prayers are being offered for him by the Congregations in
the Churches for the soul of the student.  What wonderful methods are
being used!</p>
<p>9. Not a single one so far we know.  The question paper in question
enclosed herewith.</p>
<p>10. Not a single one.</p>
<p>11. Yes.  Certainly.  On account of change of one&rsquo;s religion there is
necessarily a mental change also.  The very pillars of his life-get
changed.  The converts to Christianity begin to look towards the foreign
Christian States for their welfare.  They fall away from the Indian
Culture and Customs.  The effect of “Shastra” is more deadly than that
of a “Shastra”.  The instances of his are lacs.  Most of the Indian
Christians are not friendly towards the Indian Republic or the Indian
Culture.  India is not for them a Motherland, Fatherland or the sacred
land, i.e., all three atonce.  The term “Christian” denoted only a
community with certain habits and standards of life-largely westernized
and divorced from the natural culture of our land, finding itself on its
close association with western culture and civilization”- J.C. Kumarappa
Practice and Precepts of Jesus.</p>
<p>12. Yes. In all places from A to H, and also through correspondence is
in the case of Bible Schools.</p>
<p>13. The teachings contained in the Christian literature particularly in
those of the Bible lessons are most offensive.  They irritate the
sentiments of the Hindus.  There are instances where activities of the
missionaries of foreign countries precipitated bloody wars. e.g., the
Zulu War in South Africa and the Abyssinian affair in Eritrea. As the
Hindus are very tolerant, therefore they have been tolerating the
activities of the Christian missionaries as benevolent.  In 1954 there
was a quarrel between the Hindus of G. C. F. Estate Quarters, Madras
lines, and a Missionary Party regarding this.  A report was lodged with
the Police Station, Ghamapur who enquired into the matter also. This was
on t he 22nd August, 1954.</p>
<p>14. Indian and Foreigners both use such offensive language.</p>
<p>15. In the villages the Christian Preachers show out themselves to be
Hindus and narrate to the would be converts the evils in Hindu Society.
Then they give their reasons for their conversion to Christianity.  They
start with little helps to the would-be converts.  They repeat their
visits after a week or two and. get popular with the villagers.  The
Pracharaks usually take with them the convert relative of an influential
man of the locality.  When they find that they have become pucca they
bring them to the Church and baptise them.  Mahatma Gandhi has written
about the methods of the Christian Missionaries in villages in his
articles published in the Harijan and Young India.  His articles in
those magazines have been printed in a book form by the Navjeewan Press,
Ahmedabad.  The book is named Christian Missions and their place in
India (Edition 1941).  This books throws ample light on the doings of
Christianity in India and their ultimate object too.</p>
<p>16. Mostly from Middle to Matriculation but it is necessary for them to
be proficient in Bible.  They are usually paid more than they are
worth.  They get increments for doing better work in conversion.</p>
<p>17. The local Theological College trains pracharaks.  Those students
who get proficiency in Bible and show keenness in Mission work and are
thought fit for becoming messengers of Christ are sent to bigger schools
of Theology in America and England.</p>
<p>18. Usually one pracharak works in four to five villages.  His work is
supervised by the nearest church.  His test of success is the number of
conversions made by him.</p>
<p>19. The books and literature used in propagating Christianity elucidate
the principles and maxims of Christianity, Christian saints, and the
miracles of Christ and their saints.  Their literature predicts eternal
damnation for other than Christians.  Some copies of the literature
distributed free are attached herewith.  They are published in lacs in
all the languages.  Some of this literature rebukes, reviles and debases
the followers of other religions. Mahatmaji has referred to the books of
Mudroch sold by the Christian depots. Bishop Heber’s following lines had
been pinching him the most, “Where every prospect pleases, only man is
vile”.  Similarly, the book issued by the Yehova Witnesses from
Brooklyn, U. S. A., “What Religion has done for Mankind” reviles Brahma,
Vishnu, Shiv, Krishna, Buddha, Confucius and all other books very
shamelessly.  Chapters 14, 15 and 16 of this may kindly be read.</p>
<p>20. In addition to magic lanterns, films, loud-speakers, lessons by
correspondence and teachings through Ceylon, London and U. S. A., radios
are also used.  Under the scheme of the United States’ Education
Foundation in India created by the American war material disposal money,
the Theological Colleges in India hold camps wherein they invite Indian
teachers and professors.  During the period of these camps, attempts are
made to impress upon the minds of the Indians the high ideals of
Christianity.  Similarly, another institution known as the Moral
Rearmament was started in 1954 in India for propagation of Christianity.</p>
<p>21. One Lemurs of the Roman Catholic Mission at Sijhora, district
Mandla, got one Keshav Kumar from Bua Bichhiya admitted to the
Robertson.  Industrial School at Jabalpur.  The student was Panka by
caste.  Keshav Kumar did not get himself converted to Christianity as
desired by Lemurs.  So Lemurs stopped his aid to the student.  Keshav
Kumar had to leave his studies and seek his job in the Military where he
is now serving.  It is reported that at present he is in Bangalore.</p>
<p>22. Every Christian church holds a yearly programme in the shape of a
fair.  Herein Christians and non-Christians both are invited.  Children
Participate in various games and successful candidates are given prizes.</p>
<p>Every girls’ school holds yearly fairs as “Meena Bazars” where girl
students sell their goods.  The general public is admitted to these
fairs on tickets.  These fairs encourage indisciplined behaviour on the
part of the youth.  The authorities are not concerned with that.  They
want money.  All income goes to the institutions and the churches.  One
such fair in the G. C. Factory Estate Mission School was very much
resented by the labourers of the G. C. F. and the general public, but
the Government has not even so far taken proper action in the matter.
The articles prepared by the girls during their studentship with their
parent’s money are sold in these bazars and the money taken by the
Missionaries.</p>
<p>23. In this respect, kindly read the article contributed by Mrs.
Manorama R. Modak published in <em>Amrit Bazar Patrika</em>, dated the 12th
September 1954 (Sunday Edition).  Missionaries hope for the return of
the British Government or are contriving with American and other vested
interests.  Foreign Missions are controlled by foreign Governments, but
not by the Central or Provincial Indian Governments.</p>
<p>24. Yes. The Arya Samaj accepts into the Hindu-fold non-Hindus who
apply for conversion to Hinduism, making the fact duly public by lodging
reports with the police station and affidavit from the convert.
Necessarily, this work is very limited. No enticements are used for this
purpose.  There are many converted Christians or orphans and widows who
in their tribulations fell into the hands of the Christians but now
repent and ask for reconversion to Hinduism.  They are gladly accepted.
According to the rules laid down by Mahatma Gandhi, these are not at all
cases of conversions and the fact of their being taken back to the
Hindu-fold is not reconversion because they were never converted at all.</p>
<p>SOCIAL RELATIONS</p>
<p>25. There is a hue and cry throughout the country against the Christian
Missionaries on account of their harmful and anti-national activities.
Before 1947, their own cousin brothers were ruling the country and they
had their own way.  Now, the preaching of Christianity has taken an
international shape.  It has become a huge political conspiracy.  Now,
there is danger to the peace of the country from this propaganda for
Christianity, which is intended to serve as a political weapon in due
time.</p>
<p>26. Non-Christians have not so far boycotted Christians.  However, new
Christian converts are kept within the precincts of the Missions
compounds and their activities are very strictly guarded by the Mission
authorities.  The intention is to segregate them from their previous
brethren and create a distinct Christian community.</p>
<p>29. Foreign Christian Missions have been responsible for the creation
of the Karen State on Burma-China border, with the help of the American
and Chang Kai Shek’s money.  So they are trying to create an independent
Naga land on Assam-China border and create a separate province as
Jharkhand in India itself.  The drama played in the Johnson’s Girls’
High School on the 13th of August 1954 with reference to the
Independence Day was also neither religious nor social but bad a
political aim.  The Principal of the said school while replying to the
charges on the 15th of November 1954 before your Committee, had no
explanation for this curious drama played in her school.</p>
<p>30. In our district, Christians have never complained against
non-Christian officials.  Generally, the Government officials have been
quite favourable towards Christians, while on the other band the
Christian officials of the Education Department of the Madhya Pradesh
Government, namely, Shri Franklin, Director of Public Instruction, and
Shri G. V. Bernard, District Superintendent of Education, have been
always favourable to the Christian schools.  In the enquiry against the
Christian Mission School held on the 27th October 1954, they favoured
the school authorities.  It was only on the strong intervention of the
City’s Action Committee that these officials listened to the grievances
of the dismissed master, Shri Ambika Prasad and expelled students.  Shri
D’Souza, late Principal of the Prantiya Shikshan Mahavidyalaya, used to
give undue facilities to the Christian students in the Robertson
Industrial School.  He also got suspended one Shri Bodhley, headmaster
of the said school, who incurred his displeasure.  The case against Shri
Bodhley is still proceeding.  In the proceedings under penal law between
Narayan, Jibai and Rolinson in the District Courts, Shri Y. G. Mudliar,
City Magistrate was suspected to help the accused who is a Christian.
The case had to be transferred from his court to the Court of the
Additional Deputy Commissioner where the prosecution got the orders of
Shri Mudliar set aside.</p>
<p>32. In many cases, not.</p>
<p>33. There is no moral improvement in the converts to Christianity.
Generally, it is noticed that in matters of diet and social behaviour
regarding funds, they become loose.  Children delinquency is the most
amongst the Christians.</p>
<p>34. Yes.  In Shahpur, they demolished one temple.  In the Surguja State
the “choties” of many Hindus were cut by the Missionaries. Mahatma
Gandhi in his book at pages 164 and 165 has referred to the demolition
of a Hindu temple by a Missionary.  In this respect kindly read the
ordinances issued by the Portuguese Government as mentioned by Kaviraj
Harnamdas, B.A., in his Presidential Address to the Anti-Foreign
Missionary Conference, Delhi, held on 29th August 1954 at Dewan Hall,
Delhi.</p>
<p>35. The result was tension throughout India, by any such act committed
by them in any part of the country.</p>
<p>36. The mentality of the Christian Missions has been anti-national
towards reconstruction efforts.  They have not welcomed nor cooperated
with the work of organisations like the Harijan Sewa Sangh and the
Kasturba Memorial Trust.  Gandhiji has referred to their opposition in
the above book.  The foreign Christian Papers are very loudly charging
the Indian Government for having started works for the benefit of the
scheduled and tribal castes or having helped reclamation of the tribal
people.</p>
<p>37. Not to our knowledge.  During the days of national calamities the
Christian Missions are not known to have contributed or encouraged their
converts to contribute to National Welfare Schemes or funds for relief.
They have tried throughout their history in India to take undue
advantage of the distressed’s condition.  They have only helped those
who would get converted to Christianity.  They tried to use their money
to help the Sindhi displaced person in 1947 with this very view, but
they were not successful.  Mahatma Gandhi has also referred to this fact
in his abovesaid book.  Kindly read the same also in the memorandum
submitted by L. Devichand, President, Dayanand Salvation Mission to the
Central Government (copy attached).</p>
<p>39. Everybody knows about Father Elwyn marrying, with Gond girls. They
mix with their would be converts and learn their dialects and customs.</p>
<p>40. Yes. The Christians generally live as a distinct communal group,
hostile to Indian traditions and culture with affinity towards foreign
culture.  The peculiar uniforms of the Christian schools is ample
evidence of this.  Even small children are expected to attend the school
with the neck-tie which represents their sacred emblem, the Cross.  They
have praise only for the Christian saints and Christians are not
expected generally to have any respects for Indian saints.  Now the
Christians are trying to have their distinct colony in the Madan Mahal
area.  In their dress, habits and fashion, the Christians try to imitate
the West where others are saving it good-bye.</p>
<p>41. The converts to Christianity forget all Indian customs, social as
well as religious. They become anti to them. They give up the worship of
gram devtas and ancient marriage rites.  Among the new Roman Catholics
some at least follow Indian customs.  But as regards Protestant
converts, the ladies have to give up their Indian ornaments, their
coloured saris, the tikka on the forehead and sindoor on their ‘maang’.
They prohibit wearing of any ear-ring or any nose ornament.  Every
attempt is made that the new Christians should take to the Western
methods of dress and diet and social behaviour.</p>
<p>42. All the activities of the Christian Missionaries are detrimental to
the interests of the Nation. The sole purpose of the Christian
Missionaries is to establish a Christian state in India as they were
able to establish such states in other parts of the world. Lincoln Watts
in his book “What the Figures Tell”, also declares this at the end of
his book. The school of Voice of Prophecy Poona in this Lesson No. 32
given a full detail of their activities and purpose thereof.  One copy
of the same was separately forwarded to you under our letter, dated the
7th January, received by you on the 11th January 1955 for your necessary
action.</p>
<p>MISSIONS</p>
<p>43. Kindly refer to answer No. 6.</p>
<p>44. In 1947 many Missionaries were prepared to leave the country and
there were  some instances of disposal of their property also.  In 1948,
how ever, the state was declared secular and the Missionaries began to
pour in, in ever-increasing numbers in Jabalpur, the Pentecostal Church
and Yehova Witnesses came after 1947.  There has been very marked
increase in the American Missionaries of the Methodist Church in
South-East Asia.  Before 1947, their work was located at Jabalpur and
Katni only but now they have opened their centres at Bakharu, Burji,
Katangi, Khamaria, Panagar, Patan, Shahpura, Garha and Gorakhpur.</p>
<p>48. From the Leonard Theological College and the Women’s Training
Institute students are sent for missionary training, mostly to America
now.  The Missions bear the entire expenditure.  Miss Anu N. Gadre of
Johnson Girls’ High School has left for America for training.  One P. R.
Yohan of the C. I. B. C., Ghampur, has received 7 years’ foreign
training.</p>
<p>49. No.</p>
<p>50. The Roman Catholic Churches in India are controlled by the Papal
Internuncio at New Delhi who directs and formulates the entire activity
of the Roman Catholic Church, and the National Christian Council at
Nagpur, controls, directs and formulates the activities of the Reformed
Churches.  In effect the Catholics are kept under the ways of the Holy
See, while the Protestants are under International Missionary Council,
which has its offices in London (Edinburgh House, 2 Eaton Gate, London
S.W.1 and in New York (156 Avenue, New York City).  The objects of the
Council are-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) To help to co-ordinate the activities of the Provincial Councils
and to assist them to co-operate with each other where such
co-operation is desirable.</p>
<p>(2) To stimulate thinking and investigation on Missionary questions,
to enlist in the solution of those questions the best knowledge and
experience to be found in India and other countries, and to make
results available for all Churches and Missions in India.</p>
<p>(3) Through common consultation, to help to form Christian public
opinion and bring it to bear on the moral and social problems of the
day.</p>
<p>(4) To be in communication with the International Missionary Council
regarding such matter as call for consideration or action from the
point of view of the Indian Mission field as a whole.</p>
<p>(5) To make provision for the convening of a National Christian
Conference when such is in the opinion of the Council desirable.</p></blockquote>
<p>This Council controls the Churches through the provincial and district
organisations.  Every Mission has its chief secretary in the country to
which the Mission belongs and there is a field secretary in India.</p>
<p>51. The foreign Missions are helped by the sending countries and their
churches.  The followers of every church have to pay to the church
one-tenth of their income anti the faithful are expected to donate their
all in all even. The Roman Catholics earn a lot by Orphanages Lotteries
and by staging dramas.</p>
<p>53. It is not possible to give exact figures.  The local Methodist
Church, and Women’s Training School have received a huge amount from the
Church Women’s service Association, America.  Similarly, the Leonard
Theological College have received a heavy amount for their building.
The American Government has established a United States Education
Foundation in India far furthering Missionary purposes through the
Theological Colleges.</p>
<p>54. The abovesaid foundation and the Moral Rearmament Institutions
created by America are not outwardly for religious purposes.  They want
to preach the Gospel through social contacts.  Recently a very large
amount of powder milk was received by the Christian Missionaries.  This
milk is distributed by a Missionary Society in Gorakhpur to
non-Christian children also and, Christian prayer said on such
meetings.  It is distributed free to students in Christian schools up to
primary classes.</p>
<p>55. The literature, pamphlets and tracts used for religious propaganda
aim at showing the holiness of Bible, the Gospels, Christ and Holy
Ghost.  They all sing the songs of the Divinity of these.  Quotations
from the Gospels are cited in support of Missionary preachings.  Some
sample copies are attached.</p>
<p>56. Regular reports of the achievements of the Mission are published in
the form of Directories for the guidance of Missionaries.  They can be
had from the National Christian Council, Nagpur, and Internuncio,
Delhi.  Kindly call for them.</p>
<p>57. The activities of the Missions are of the following kinds, as (a)
Religious propaganda, (b) Running of institutions like schools and
hospitals, (c) the Methodist Church Mission have taken to agriculture
also near Barela, (d) Establishment of churches and training of
Pracharaks.  The Christian Missions are helping the Christians to
establish their own colony in Madan Mahal area.  Easy building loans are
also given.  For the results achieved, please refer to their Directors.</p>
<p>58. No.</p>
<p>59. The centres of the Missions are at Jabalpur and the Cantonment
area.  They concentrate their work in the interior of this and other
districts.</p>
<p>In the Protestant Churches Directory for 1951, at page 120 in the
Preliminary Note for Madhya Pradesh, the following statement occurs:-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The total number of tribesmen in the State is 3,708,892 among whom
the Census reports 148 Christians, which is obviously a misstatement.
The depressed classes number 3,265,453 who, with tribes people, make
it all about 7,000,000 constituting a great field for Evangelism.”</p></blockquote>
<p>That is their main field of work in the city and the cantonment area.
They work in the suburbs.  The Missions in the districts are functioning
since the days of the British.  The M. C. S. A. branches at Balkharua,
Burji, Garha Gorakhpur, Patan, Khamaria, Katangi, Pamgar, Patan and
Shahpur were opened after 1947.  The United Christian Missionary Society
has its head office at Jabalpur.  It has a Mission Press also.  Its aim
is to establish Christian Churches.  Their preachers work in the
interior.  They have their branches in Orissa, Jhansi, Pendra Road,
Bilaspur, Kotah, Mungali, Fosterpur and Sambalpur.  Their annual budget
is from eight to ten lakhs.  The C. I. B. C. Mission has its branch at
Katni also.  It is possible to go to these places throughout the year.</p>
<p>61. It appears that the Government has not so far taken any executive
action to interfere with the activities of the Missionaries.</p>
<p>62. The meetings of the Missionary workers are held at periodical
intervals, but the proceedings of such meetings are not made known to
the general public.</p>
<p>63. Yes.  Every Mission has its particular area of work.  Usually they
do not interfere in other’s fields.</p>
<p>64. After 1947, the Missionary activities have increased very much.
The activities of the Leonard Theological College have increased
manifold.  The.  Methodist Women’s Training institute has also increased
its activities.  The Methodist Mission has extended its activities to
Gorakhpur, Garha, Khamaria, Katangi, Panagar, Belkhera, Patan, Shahpur
and Burji.</p>
<p>65. We have come across cases of mass conversions in newspapers.
Thakkar Bappa has been quoted in Mahatma Gandhi’s writings in the
above-said book, narrating the peculiar tactics used for mass
conversions.</p>
<p>66. The interest shown by the Missionaries in the States Reorganisation
Commission’s work has been anti-national.  They have demanded Naga land
and Jharkhand.</p>
<p>67. From 1947 Christian Missions have supported the Congress whose
declared aim is secularism.</p>
<p>HOSPITALS</p>
<p>69. There is one M. T. S. C. Christian Dispensary at  Sihora.</p>
<p>70. Christians are given more facilities than non-Christians.</p>
<p>71. Yes.  All the benevolent activities of the Christian Missions aim
at conversion, which is the most coveted aim of the Missionaries.  The
activities of the Churches are mentioned in the book “Christian
Missions” referred to above and the Maker of the nation did not like the
Christian preachings through the hospitals.  The patients have to join
the, Christian prayers; those who do not join not attended to. The does
of the medicines are given with the doses of Christianity. All church
hospitals are members of the Christian Medical Association of India,
Pakistan, Burma and Ceylon, the aims of which are the preventions and
relief of human sufferings and the pursuit of measures for the promotion
of health in the spirit of Christ in the extending of the Kingdom of
God.</p>
<p>72. Yes, Usually the Doctors and the Nurses are themselves Christian
“Pracharks”. From page 281 of the above Directory it is clear that the
main hospital staff is missionary.</p>
<p>73. Yes. It is heard that the Christians distribute their books free in
the hospitals. It is not allowed to read books other than Christian.</p>
<p>74. The Dispensary at Sihora is under Rev. John Verghese. He is there
before 1947. Usually the Mission people are the managers. It is heard
so.</p>
<p>77. The missionaries usually keep the Herbs-Minera. Medicines of Dr. De
Chane of Hyderabad and Homeopathic Medicines Father Muller’s Poor
Dispensary, P.O. Kankanadi, S. India. No licence is required for these.
The Missionaries get them at reduced rates.  Both these laboratories
encourage Missionary Work.  Usually the “Pracharks” themselves
distribute the medicines.  These medicines can be given by lay people
even. because they are not harmful.</p>
<p>SCHOOLS</p>
<p>78. Kindly refer to answer No. 6.</p>
<p>79. As stated before, the Christian Officials of the Education
Department have been always favourable to the Christian Institutions.
They do not apply the secular principles of the Education code to the
Christian schools.  Even in matters of grants-in-aid these officials
have been favourable to the Mission Schools.  The local Hitkarini High
School with 2,000 students gets only Rs. 18,000 whereas the local
Mission nigh School with 570 students only get, Rs. 9,000.</p>
<p>80. The total strength of the Christian schools is not known to us.  It
is roughly estimated at 5,000.  In the Leonard Theological College
exclusively all students are Christians.  In the Women’s Training
Institute, out of 58 students only 2 are non-Christians who have adopted
all Christian habits. In the other Christian Institutions only 15 to 20
per cent are Christian and the rest are non-Christian.  This large
number of Christian Educational Institutions in the district of Jabalpur
is due to the undue encouragement given by the previous British Rulers
who were themselves neglectful of this relatively backward area.  Even
now the Government and the non-Christian Institutions are insufficient
and ill-equipped to educate the boys and girls of the district.</p>
<p>81. Only those Non-Christian students are admitted to these
Institutions whose parents much against their wish give a written
undertaking that they have no objection to Christian teachings to the
students.  History bears witness that education in Christian lands had
been in the hands of the Church.  The foremost duty of the Church is
evangelisation.  So, the ultimate aim of the Christian schools is
through education.  Mahatma Gandhi has said that effects of the Bible on
the tender hearts has nefarious consequences.  The seed sown by the
Education Missionary ripens in the form of conversion of the student at
the hands of the Church Missionary.  This is their history.  Any student
who is made a covert, is at once taken away from his Locality.  Most of
the Christian students in our local Christian schools are sent from
outside by Missions.</p>
<p>82. It is heard that while recording the names of the students in
school registers the Christian school teachers in the rural areas change
the name of poor children into Christian names.</p>
<p>83. Usually the Christian school charge higher fees.  Even students of
Primary Classes whose education is free are charged heavy fees.  Apart
from Government scholarships special facilities are given to Christian
students and to those who accept to be converted to Christianity out of
570 students in the local Christian Mission School, 100 Christian
students get free tuition, books, diet, milk and clothes and
accommodation in hostel.  These facilities are not available to any
non-Christian student.</p>
<p>84. Yes.  In this connection kindly refer to Lesson No. 32 of the Voice
of Prophecy Poona.  That gives the method of religious instruction in
the schools.  Christian morals are stated to be necessary with
education.  Bible teachings are compulsory in Primary and Middle
schools.  The usual prayers are all Christian.  In the local Christian
Mission School the middle class students are given compulsory Bible
teaching for one hour on Sundays, Wednesdays and Friday-S.  The students
are made to learn by rote the parable, of the Gospel.  They are asked to
purchase Christian books.  Bible is distributed free to the poor.  At
the end of the daily morning Christian prayers all shout “Amen”.  The
female teachers in the primary schools play a lead rig part in
impressing upon the young minds the beauties of Christian Trio.</p>
<p>85. No. It is beyond expectation.</p>
<p>86. In the Christian Institutions Christian precepts are treated as
moral instruction.</p>
<p>87. Yes.  There are non-Christian members on the staff of the schools,
but very few.  Those who try to show themselves to be strict in their
religion are not looked with favour by the authorities.  From 1947 to
1954 many non-Christian teachers were engaged by the local Christian
Mission School, but  none was confirmed, whereas all Christians were
given due promotion.  Master Ambika Prasad Shroff of that school had to
suffer great hardships on account of his not tolerating the growing
enemosity shown by the Christian authorities against Hindus.  Those
Hindu students who took part in the school strike on the 26th September
1954 were got challaned by the school authorities under section 167,
Criminal Procedure Code.  This is the usual treatment in all the
Christian school.  The school boys and the Hindu members of the staff
will tell you their sorry state if you call them individually and get
their feelings in confidence.</p>
<p>88. The schools enjoy all national holidays.  They enjoy all Christian
holidays also, but not so the other Hindu holidays.  The Methodist
Institutions like the Johnson’s Girls’ School and the Women’s Training
Institute have Saturdays also as holidays because like the Seventh Day
adventist Mission, they also want that according to the Bible Yehova God
made this world from Sunday to Friday and took rest on Saturday.  It was
on account of this reason that the local Johnson’s Girls’ High School
celebrated the Independence Day on the 13th August instead of 14th and
15th August 1954, which happened to be Saturday and Sunday, both
Christian holidays.  This shows that they can sacrifice the importance
of the National Calendar while in conflict with their Missions
principles.</p>
<p>89. We have referred to the peculiar sort of Political drama played by
the local Johnson’s Girls’ High School on the 13th August 1954 in which
the National Flag was shown down.  In the Deepavali holidays in 1953 the
St. Alloysis College also played one drama entitled “Monkey’s Paw” by
Christian students.  Hindus were represented as a class of superstitious
people.  This was very much resented by the non-Christian students of
the College.</p>
<p>90. Every occasion is taken by the local Christian schools to bring
into contempt non-Christian religions and deities.  On the 21st of
December 1953, 2 dramas were played by the students of the local
Christian Mission School intended to degrade the worship of Kali and
Brahma, Vishnu and Shiv.  In fact these were two rehearsals which
created great agitation among the Hindu staff and the students and the
authorities had to give up the idea of staging the dramas.  In the one
certain Hindu worshippers of Kali were shown in tattered robes and
drunken state.  One Isai Parcharak was represented to approach them
asking them to give up the useless worship of Kali and seek  shelter
under Christ wherein they would get salvation, comfort and wealth.  The
Christian Parcharak succeeded in converting one who came back to the
stage in Christian dress and asked others to follow his example.  In the
other drama three Indian Sadhus were shown as Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh
roaming about in a disturbed state of mind and a Christian Missionary is
represented to approach them and tell them that they would not get any
consolation except by the acceptance of Christ.  In the end these three
are shown as going over to Jesus.</p>
<p>91. Some of the High Schools and Colleges of the Mission have hostel,
or boarding house, attached.  Only Christians or the students sent by
the Missions from other parts of the country are readily admitted but
not so the others.  Fees are charged but for most of them the sending
Missionaries pay.  On the 15th of November 1954, Mr. Singh, the
headmaster of the local Mission School made this very statement.</p>
<p>92. Yes. Attendance at religious exercises are compulsory for the
inmates of these Boarding Houses.  Prospectus of the Mission schools are
clear in this respect.  As the activities of the Missionaries in the
hostels are mostly secret and the students are also from outside it has
been difficult to find any local instances.  Any local student who is to
be converted is at once transported.  History tells that this has been
the aim of Christian Hostels. If the Committee goes into the history of
the Christian boarders of the local Christian Brotherhood Hostel, they
will get the local facts.  The person incharge of the Johnson’s Girls’
High School Miss Z. Soule is the Youth Organizer of the Women society of
Christian Service of the Methodist Church in Southern India.  Naturally
her sole aim through college, school and hostels can only be extension
of Christianity within -sphere of her influence.  In Christ Church
School attendance of even non-Christian boarders in Church on Sundays is
compulsory and it is very strictly observed.</p>
<p>REMEDIES</p>
<p>93. As is clear from History and from Lesson No. 32 of the Voice of
Prophecy Poona all Foreign Missions have one aim.  Their organisation is
one.  They have to evangelise, the country and exterminate all the rest,
with a view to make India Christ’s’ land.  This is what Lincoln Watts
tells in his book “What Figures Tell”.  He has been a most, leading
Missionary being Indian Secretary of the World Dominion Movement.  He is
authority on Christian intentions in India.  The Christian
establishments in India were intended to be political and economic
strongholds in India.  The following remedies should be undertaken
immediately:-</p>
<p>(1) As reported by Lala Lajpat Rai from his exile in America in 1905
the intention of the American Government sending their Missionaries to
India was on the principle “Save the world to save America”.  American
Missionaries are not religious Missionaries but political and economic.
In this respect kindly read the Presidential address of Kaviraj
Harmandas B.A. to the Anti-Foreign Missionary Conference held on 29th of
August 1954, as also the Memorandum submitted by L. Devi Chand M.A.,
President of the Dayanand Salvation Mission to the Central Government,
(copies of both are attached).</p>
<p>(2) Foreign Christian Officials should not be given any responsible
posts for it is heard that they are passing on secrets to foreign
Governments.  The services of the present encumbants should be dispensed
with, so long as this is not done intelligence department and the head
of the departments should keep watch on their activities.</p>
<p>(3) The Christian Evangelists should be put under strict control.
They should be licenced and maintain proper registers of conversion and
they should send regular statements to the Government.</p>
<p>(4) The Government should define its secularism and make strict rules
for compliance with its regulations.</p>
<p>(5) The property of the Christian Missions should be brought under the
Indian Trust Act at once.</p>
<p>(6) The immoveable property given without any consideration by the
previous Central Government should be taken back, and the institutions
run on those properties should either be nationalised or made over to
other Indian institutions.</p>
<p>(7) The, Bible schools like the Voice of Prophecy, Poona, and Jeewan
Prakash, Jhansi, should be closed immediately.  They are teaching
adulterated moral values to the students.  The students of these schools
are expected to become messengers of Christ.  The Seventh Day Adventist
Mission-sends its representatives to the successful students for further
negotiations to help the students further in his study of the Bible.
The student is duped to believe that the congregations pray for his
soul.  Please read Question Paper No. 32 of the said school, a copy of
which is attached.  This is the most- harmful activity of the mission
amongst the students of the Nation.  Their publications and literature
should be put under censor.</p>
<p>(8) The publications of the Mission Presses and other books sold at
Christian Depot, should also be treated likewise.  The teachings in the
Theological College and their management should be strictly watched.
Nobody should be allowed to go out to receive training, as a Missionary,
as he turns Anti-National.</p>
<p>(9) The Churches and the Statues of Christ and Mary should be removed
from Educational Institutions.  In these institutions only National
songs should be sung and not Christian ones.</p>
<p>(10) Those officials of the Educational Departments or in other
departments who are alleged to have been favourable to the Christians or
Christian Institutions should atonce be removed.  The Government should
open its own National Schools.  Proper arrangement for Government
educational institutions should be made in Cantonment area.</p>
<p>(11) Cambridge School Course should be atonce closed.  Because
scriptures are the most important part of the course.</p>
<p>(12) The National calendar should be ‘Bikrami’ or the Arya Srisht
Sambat.</p>
<p>(13) The weekly holiday of Sunday should be changed into any other
suitable day.</p>
<p>(14) The emblem of the Cross in the Red Cross Institution should be
changed into Swastik.</p>
<p>(15) Necktie should be removed from the uniforms.</p>
<p>(16) It should be made punishable for the Christian Missionaries to
advance loans to the people.  All such existing loans should be
cancelled.</p>
<p>(17) Ashrams should be opened for Orphans and widows.</p>
<p>(18) The Christian Officials of the Army should be put under the watch
of the intelligence department.</p>
<p>(19) The head of the C. I. D. should not be a Christian.</p>
<p>(20) No Christian should be put at the head of any institution for the
welfare of the Scheduled and Tribal Castes.</p>
<p>(21) The Anglo-Indian lady typists in the Army should be put under the
Intelligence Department.</p>
<p>(22) The Goanese Christians should be atonce dismissed from Government
services.</p>
<p>(23) The Government should keep due control on money received by
Foreign Missions from abroad.</p>
<p>(24) No convert to Christianity should be allowed to represent the
Scheduled and Tribal Castes.  In any future Census converts to
Christianity should be treated as Christians and no benefits should be
given to Christian converts admissible for Scheduled Castes and Tribes
under the Constitution.</p>
<p>93. Remedy (No. 25) Strict scrutiny be made of the literature published
by the Christian Society for the study of Hinduism carried on under the
patronage of the Metropolitan of India, Calcutta.</p>
<p>(26) The Associations like the (Christian) Evangelical Fellowship of
India aiming at “the building of the body of Christ in India unto to the
evangelizing of this land” be closed immediately.</p>
<p>(27) The institution named “Indian Forces Scripture Readers’
Fellowship” intended to take the Gospel to all men engaged in the
Defence Services of our country should be immediately closed.  Its
organising Secretary and Treasurer is Mr. Joseph P. Thomas, B.A., L.T.,
46 Maigandadeva Mudaliar Road, Bangalore-5.</p>
<p>(28) The Christian Medical Association in India, Pakistan, Burma and
Ceylon with its Secretary-Treasurer E. W. Wilder, M.D., Nelson Square,
Nagpur, controls the Medical Missionaries of these countries with the
object of prevention and relief of human suffering and the pursuit of
measures for the promotion of health in the spirit of Christ in the
extending of the “Kingdom of God”.  The Christian Hospital should atonce
be nationalised.</p>
<p>(29) The school for the study of Hinduism conducted by the M.R.C.C.,
A.C.C., T.H., S.C.C., Board for Examination with Miss D. A. Wells as
convener and a similar school for the study of Islam conducted by the
same Board should be immediately closed.  This is at Chittoor,
Rajasthan.</p>
<p>(30) Christian unions like the “One by one Band” who are united for
making common effort to bring souls to Christ should be disbanded.  It’s
head office is at 50 Tannah Street, Vepery Post Office, Madras 7.</p>
<p>(The above activities of the Christian Mission have been called from
their 1951 Directory issue by the N.C.C. Nagpur.)</p>
<p>From facts stated above it is evident that foreign Christian
Missionaries work to subserve their moneyed masters for political ends.
They are false torchbearers of Light.  Government should ask them to
quit India at the earliest.</p>
<p>94. Change of religion necessarily implies the change of culture. That
is the intention.  Now conversion is not religious; it is political. For
a Christian convert India is not ‘Matri Bhoomi’ and ‘Pooniya Bhoomi’; it
may be his father land only.</p>
<p>95. Secular does not mean anti-religious.  It is the duty of every
civilised Government to propagate true basic moral principles.  These
are the ‘Shilaas’ for life making as also for Rashtra making.  The
Government should take up the principles of the ancient sages like Shri
Krishna, Vyas and the Buddha and the present leaders Shri Dayanand
Swaraswati, Swami Shradhanand, Tagore, Malviyaji, Arvind, Lokmaniya
Tilak, Vivekananda, Gandhiji and Sarvpalli Radhakrishanan, i.e., the
Government should inculcate the principles of “Ahimsa”, “Satya”,
“Astaea”, “Brahmacharya” “Aprigraha”.</p>
<p>96. Yes.  But the patients should take to prayers, etc., according to
their own religions.  All Sectarian preachings particular to the Mission
Hospitals should be stopped.</p>
<p>97. Yes.  When any part of the subjects of the State takes an ill
advantage of the rights conferred by the Constitution, the Government
has every right to interfere.  As the Christians are taking advantage of
the freedom of religion under the Constitution for the purposes of
evangelisation and are employing all objectionable methods the
Government should put them under due control . Their religion is defined
as saving the orphans and widows in their tribulations.  Their books as
“What Religion has done for Mankind” and Mudrock’s books referred to by
Mahatma Gandhi try to debase Hindus and their “Devtas”, Brahma, Vishnu,
Mahesh and their ancestors, Rama, Krishna and the Buddha, their sacred
books the Vedas, the Geeta, and the Ramayana are tried to be shown in
the worst light possible.  The American Missionaries publication “What
Religion has done for Mankind” is the most rotten book.  It depicts all
others as seed of the demon.  It represents Budhism as seed of
Demonism.  Such literature should be censored on their publication or
their arrival in India.  As far as possible the printers and publishers
should be punished.  Mahatma Gandhi was greatly pinched by Bishop
Heber’s following line, “Where every prospect pleases only man is
vile”.  If other religious followers also show the same zeal and
enthusiasm there would certainly be unpleasant consequences.</p>
<p>98. Yes.  As Mahatma Gandhi has said, the followers of different
religions can co-exist peacefully and co-operate in realising a just
order of society only if all work for the widest toleration to combine
and side with the forces of light against the forces of darkness or as
Deenabandhu Andrews said with those who love God, truth and Divine light
against those who blankly leave out God and become materialist.  Every
act of the religious followers should he truly religious with the motive
of true sacrifice.  Nobody should think of adding to his numbers by
conversion Every Hindu, Muslim, and Christian should show the teachings
of his religion by example of his life, not by verbal precepts.  All
should accept the maxim of “Satyam Bada”, …… “Dharmam Char”, “Agne
Nayasupatha”, so that Vasudhev Kutumbhkam should be in real practice,
and all should unite in the betterment of their Matri Bhoomi, Pitri
Bhoomi and Pooniya Bhoomi.  The following principles should be the
guiding star for all:-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) We should be ever ready to accept the truth and renounce
untruth.</p>
<p>(2) All actions should be done according to righteousness, i.e.,
after considering what is truth and what is untruth.</p>
<p>(3) The Chief Mission of this nation is to do good to the world,
i.e., to contribute to the political, spiritual and social
advancement.</p>
<p>(4) We should treat all with love, righteousness and according to
deserts.</p>
<p>(5) We should remove ignorance and promote learning.</p>
<p>(6) Nobody should be contended with his well being.  In the well
being of all should we consider our own well-being.</p>
<p>(7) Law pertaining to social and universal good should be binding
upon all persons.  Every individual is free in matters of his own
personal good.</p></blockquote>
