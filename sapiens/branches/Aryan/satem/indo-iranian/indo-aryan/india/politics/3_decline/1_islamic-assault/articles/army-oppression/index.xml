      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: Nidhin George&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;during-campaigns&#34;&gt;During campaigns&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;tipu&#34;&gt;Tipu&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So imagine where Tippu is angry with Shimogas palegar who refuses to bend before him. Tipu would besiege the city and the palegar loses the war. The palegar and his family will be taken captives to Spattana and kept in house arrest with an allowance. If he was important enough and had a daughter or sister of marriageable age Tipu did institute a practise (probably inspired by Akbar - as Kirmani alludes to specifically) of marrying her.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;rape-and-naked-dances&#34;&gt;Rape and naked dances&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DC &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/170916/razakaars-forced-naked-dance-freedom-fighter.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For 89-year-old Challa Chandra Reddy, the memories of August 27, 1948, are vivid. “August 27 is observed as a dark day in Bairanpalli. It was on this day in 1948 that 92 residents of Bairanpalli were slaughtered mercilessly. Women were raped and terrorised. Razakaars went up to the extent of making women play bathukamma naked,” he claimed. (In Navaratri, Batukamma festival is celebrated by Telugus.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
