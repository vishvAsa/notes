## CXC

*To Mr. John Fox*

BOULEVARD HANS SWAN,  
PARIS,  
*14th August, 1900*.

JOHN FOX, ESQ.,  
6 Dr. Wolf Street,  
Dorchester, Mass, U.S., America.

Kindly write Mohin (Mahendranath Datta, younger brother of Swamiji.)
that he has my blessings in whatever he does. And what he is doing now
is surely much better than lawyering, etc. I like boldness and adventure
and my race stands in need of that spirit very much. Only as my health
is failing and I do not expect to live long, Mohin must see his way to
take care of mother and family. I may pass away any moment. I am quite
proud of him now.

Yours affectionately,  
VIVEKANANDA.
