      <description>&lt;p&gt;NOTE: propaganda piece exaggerating importance of christians in securing w punjab for pAk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ucanews.com/news/how-jinnahs-christians-helped-form-independent-pakistan/93712#google_vignette&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How Jinnah&amp;rsquo;s Christians helped form independent Pakistan&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Christians’ unquestionable allegiance and commitment to Pakistan needs to be flagged again in the frame of historical reference after the country celebrated its 74th Independence Day on Aug. 14.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The historical account of Christians’ services to the Indian subcontinent, especially in the field of education, highlights their spirit to serve humanity which brought forward celebrated leaders to demand an independent Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1617089580838326272.html&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve often described it as a successor state of Mughals- extreme wealth concentration, no middle class, rent seeking military that consumes most of the resources.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But in modern times, not controlling population growth and no energy source-&amp;gt; imports shoot up each year. So as pop grows, your energy, consumer goods, food, all kinds of imports grow. But you cant get more exports w.o being competitive globally in goods/services. What are the inputs? infra, energy, labour costs or innovation. Unless you can get a clear edge in these, it doesnt work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.rattibha.com/thread/1645868004926971904&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Pakistan Movement was, in the context of the Third World, both a reactionary movement and in a sense a vision of its future. During the mid 20th century the ideas of anti-imperialism, socialism, secularism, and decolonization were spreading like wildfire amongst the peoples of the Third World. These revolutionary ideas would stipulate the unity of cultural and ethnic groups, who were to work together in one unit to shed the prejudices of the past and work together for a progressive future which would do away with the legacies of Western colonial rule upon their regions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
