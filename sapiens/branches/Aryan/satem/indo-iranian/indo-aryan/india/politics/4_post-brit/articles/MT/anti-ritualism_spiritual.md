While the below should be taken with caution because our social intersections are limited, we get the sense that among the H 10-20 or more years younger than us there is a growing cadre of that type that claims to be "spiritual" but not "religious". It seems that when they say they are not religious they are mostly uninterested in H ritual practice of the saMskAra type or even personal acts of rituals towards deities. It is not entirely clear to us what kind of spirits the cleave to.  But they show an inclination towards a certain class of nonsense to borderline nonsense beliefs of mostly occidental vintage. The most bizarre thing I heard one of them tell me was that DNA was once 12 stranded!

> Curious which branch of ancient H can be described as "religious but not spiritual" - pUrva mImAmsakas?

The kautsa flavor of that tradition will fall closest to that.
