If you don&amp;rsquo;t, it will get done in 10 days.&#xA;In IN, you need to pay bribe + Govt penalty + GST on the penalty to get anything done after your 10 days. Approx $200&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2/n&#xA;#2: Paying $20 gift/year/concerned Govt employee gets all your work done without a hitch. In return, they invite me for lunch/dinner, and even invitations to their kid&amp;rsquo;s birthday parties.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/rawalactual/status/1729732201573458204&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the year 1952, when Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru comfortably settled on the throne with his southern necessities, we had a GDP per capita of $1499 in today&amp;rsquo;s USD. It nearly halved by the year 1960 to $863.+++(5)+++ It was a hopeless basket case for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Post-1990s reforms, we started bouncing back. Bounce back we did; by 2007 we finally surpassed the feudal British Raj-era GDP per capita - a number from a time when our literacy rate was just 16%, we had just endured a messy partition alongside an all-out war for Kashmir, and just a few years prior we were forced to fight a world war on behalf of the Englishmen in Europe, Africa and East Asia!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: 2018 svarAjya mag&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A lesson in economics, history, and logic for those who think that rest of India is a burden on the States of the south.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ever since floods ravaged Kerala in the south-western coast of India, an anti-north India propaganda (which serves no purpose in providing relief to the victims) is being stoked in some corners of social media. The alleged grievance of people furthering this narrative is that the states of the north have not come to the aid of Kerala, a claim which in itself is untrue. However, it doesnâ€™t stop there. The case is then made that the â€˜poor and backwardâ€™ north Indian states are a drag on the â€˜prosperous and progressiveâ€™ south Indian states and that this is unfair to the south and is a legitimate reason to harbour a grievance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
