## CLXXI

*To Sister Nivedita*

U.S.A.,  
*6th April, 1900*.

DEAR MARGOT,

Glad you have returned. Gladder you are going to Paris. I shall go to
Paris of course, only don't know when. Mrs. Leggett thinks I ought to
immediately, and take up studying French. Well, take what comes. So you
do too.

Finish your books, and in Paris we are going to conquer the Froggies.
How is Mary? Give her my love. My work here is done. I will come in
fifteen days to Chicago if Mary is there. She is going away to the East
soon. With blessings,

VIVEKANANDA.

PS. The mind is omnipresent and can be heard and felt anywhere.
