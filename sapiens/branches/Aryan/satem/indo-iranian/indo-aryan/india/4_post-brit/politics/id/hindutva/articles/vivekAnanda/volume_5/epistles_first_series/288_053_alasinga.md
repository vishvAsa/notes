## LIII

LONDON,  
*24th October, 1895*.

DEAR ALASINGA,

. . . I have already delivered my first address, and you may see how
well it has been received by the notice in the *Standard*. The
*Standard* is one of the most influential conservative papers. I am
going to be in London for a month, then I go off to America and shall
come back again next summer. So far you see the seed is well sown in
England. . . .

Take courage and work on. Patience and steady work — this is the only
way. Go on; remember — patience and purity and courage and steady work.
. . . So long as you are pure, and true to your principles, you will
never fail — Mother will never leave you, and all blessings will be
yours.

Yours with love,

VIVEKANANDA.
