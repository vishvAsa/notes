Su.Keennanur in Cuddalore district of 60 years ago had a Brahmin settlement, which he claims collectively owned 1500 acres of land. He claims that Dravidian movement members used to throw dried fish heads, bones from goat meat dishes into their houses and hide cactus when Brahmin women used to take a bath, early in the morning, so that they hurt their bare feet in the darkness. Note the triumphant note in his voice and the audience applause. 

Throwing dried fish into Brahmin houses and mixing feces in SC peoples drinking water are but different manifestations of the the same mindset. The criminal intent and the unwarranted hate flow from the same dark place in the human psyche.

(Also, Senior Dravidian leader Sirpi Rajan himself gives first hand witness of how they used to block Tamizh Brahmins and cut their sacred thread and tuft of hair. Actively encouraged by Mr.E.V.Ramaswamy.) (Source: [TW](https://twitter.com/realitycheckind/status/1450645316320043008)
