## INC role
1984 - the Dharma Sansad organized by VHP had INC support. Took place in a govt premise and a career Congressman Karan Singh attended. He announced: “We cannot even light a lamp at RJB! How shameful for 80% of this country's residents who call themselves Hindus!”

Next year, in 1985, Rajiv Gandhi’s Info Broadcasting ministry approached Ramanand Sagar to produce a mega TV serial on Ramayana. 

1986 - Rajiv ordered opening of the taala at Ayodhya to allow pooja of the murtis. Suddenly Babri Masjid and Ayodhya came on the front pages of the newspaper. Rajiv doubled down and even went to do the ground breaking for the Ram Mandir which was telecasted live on Doordarshan.

Starting Jan 1987, it was during INC rule that it started airing primetime on Doordarshan, which used to be taunted as Rajiv Darshan by ABV.

Being a conservative and religious traditional Hindu is never enough, being a political Hindu matters a lot more. Narasimhan Rao used to think being a South Indian Brahmin who could quote scripture and Sanskrit meant he would have enough sway with BJP, RSS, VHP leaders that Babri would never fall. He was wrong.

Rao personally met Advani in a safe house in the last week of December where he was given assurance Babri wouldn't fall. Kalyan Singh had also given his word, so had Bhairon Singh Shekhawat. Rao had decided not to dismiss the Kalyan Singh government on the basis of all these assurances.

2 lakh Kar Sevaks had gathered around Ayodhya. 12 pm, December 6, 1992 the destruction of Babri would begin like a long line of dominoes falling one after the other.

When Rao was informed the first dome had fallen he couldn't talk for some minutes. He felt betrayed by all the Hindu leaders that had assured him Babri would stand. Kalyan Singh and the BJP Government swung into action to make sure the mosque fell without any CRPF intervention.


> Is the claim true that Narsimharao and later Bajpai wanted to build Babri and Ram temple side by side?

It is correct. Towards it, PVNR took initiative of creating a body that included 5 Shankaracharyas & Acharyas of Pejavar, Jiyar, Vallabha, Ramananda, SV, Gaudiyas. He sent his minister from Orissa KC Lenka to recruit Puri Acharya for it. The latter punctured the plan.

## Court role

Well, no. In 1019 the Supreme Court, judging autonomously regardless of the Modi Gvt., only confirmed the UP High Court verdict allotting the site to the Hindus. This was in 2010, w/ the BJP out of power in UP & at the Centre. The decisive factor was the scholarly evidence.

But the ones who, next to the scholars, vitally contributed to the temple, are the Kar Sevaks. After the Eminent Fatwa of 1989, the crucial mosque demolition had become unfeasible but for them.

## BJP
The BJP has to thank Śrī Rāma, it owes its 1989 & 1991 electoral breakthrough to him. That is why, after CM Kalyan Singh, even PM Narasimha Rao allowed the Demolition. He calculated as a Congress leader that this would throw the BJP on the defensive; & as a pro-temple Hindu, that this would lift the biggest hurdle to the temple-building.


## RSS role

RSS didn’t demolish the structure. It was protecting it. Evidence points towards its demolition despite the contrary wishes of RSS leadership.
