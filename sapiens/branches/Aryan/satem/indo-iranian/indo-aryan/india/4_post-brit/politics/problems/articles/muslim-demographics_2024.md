Muslim socio-economic indicators are ahead of SCs across India. Except in the Hindi heartland, Muslim socio-economic indicators are on par with OBC numbers across India.

As far as the TFR is concerned, while the gap is narrowing, there are no signs that Hindu and Muslim TFRs will ever converge, so the trend of Muslim share of population increasing is due to continue for the next 30 years at least.

Assam, Bengal, UP and Bihar alone have 50% of the Muslim population. Focus on the Muslim socio-economic parameters in these States is lost when more prosperous, healthier and better-educated Ms of other States are included in the same category.
