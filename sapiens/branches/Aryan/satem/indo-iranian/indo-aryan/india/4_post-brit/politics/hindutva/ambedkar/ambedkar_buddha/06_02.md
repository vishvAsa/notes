> § 1. Charge of Conversion by Glamour
>
>  1. Once the Exalted One dwelt at Vesali, in the Gable-roofed Hall
> in the Great Wood. Now Bhaddiya the Licchavi came to the Exalted One
> and said, "Lord! People say 'Gautama the recluse is a charmer, and
> knows a trick of glamour, whereby he entices the followers of other
> sects.'  
>  2. "They who say this disclaim any desire to misrepresent the
> Exalted One. Indeed, Lord, we Licchavis do not believe in this charge.
> But we would like to know what the Exalted One has to say about it."  
>  3. The Lord said, "Come now, Bhaddiya, accept not on hearsay, nor
> by tradition, nor by what people say. Accept not because it is in the
> scriptures, by mere logic, nor by inference, nor by consideration of
> appearances, nor because it accords with your view, nor because you
> think it must be right, nor out of respect, with the thought that 'One
> must revere a recluse'."  
>  4. "But, Bhaddiya, if at any time you know, of \[=for\] yourself,
> by examination of facts, that what is being done is sinful or
> wrongful, that it is reproached by the wise and the result is loss or
> injury, then, Bhaddiya, eschew them.  
>  5. "Now as to your question, Bhaddiya, what think you: are not
> those who accuse me of performing conversion by glamour ambitious
> persons?" "They are, Lord," replied Bhaddiya.  
>  6. "What think ye, Bhaddiya: does not an ambitious person,
> overcome by avarice and with mind overpowered, tell lies or commit
> crime to achieve his ambition?" "It is so, Lord," replied Bhaddiya.  
>  7. "What think you, Bhaddiya: when thoughts of ill-will and
> vindictiveness arise in the mind of such a person, does he not
> instigate others to level accusations against those who come in the
> way of his ambition?" "That is so, Lord," said Bhaddiya.  
>  8. "Now, Bhaddiya, all I do is to exhort my pupil thus: 'Come you,
> my dear man, dwell controlling (thoughts of) avarice. So dwelling, you
> will not commit acts born of avarice, either by body, work, or
> thought. Dwell controlling ill-will and ignorance.'  
>  9. "So, Bhaddiya, those recluses and Brahmins who wrongly reproach
> me with being a teacher and proclaimer of such views, are false, empty
> liars, when they say: 'The recluse Gautama is a charmer, and knows a
> trick of glamour, whereby he entices the followers of other sects.'
> "  
>  10. "A lucky thing indeed, O Lord--a fair find is this trick of
> glamour! Lord, would that my beloved blood-relations were enticed by
> this same trick of glamour! It would indeed conduce to their advantage
> and happiness! Lord, would that all the classes--the Brahmins, the
> Khatiyas, the Vessas, and the Suddas--were enticed by this same trick
> of glamour; it would indeed conduce to their advantage and happiness
> for a long time."  
>  11. "It is so, Bhaddiya! It is so, Bhaddiya! If all the classes,
> enticed by this trick of glamour, were to eschew sinful conditions, my
> trick would result in great advantage and happiness to the world."
>
>   
> § 2. Charge of Being a Parasite!
>
>  1. The Blessed One was accused of being a parasite, living upon
> others, and not earning his living by working for it. The accusation,
> and the reply of the Blessed Lord, is \[=are\] set out below:  
>  2. Once the Lord was living among the Magadha folk at
> Dakkhina-giri, in the Brahmin village of Eka-Nala, at a time when the
> Brahmin Kasi-Bharadvaja's five hundred ploughs were harnessed for the
> sowing.  
>  3. In the morning early, duly robed and bowl in hand, the Lord
> went to where the Brahmin was busy, at an hour when a meal was brought
> forward; and \[he\] stood there to one side.  
>  4. Observing him standing there for alms, the Brahmin said,
> "Before I eat, I plough and sow, anchorite; and you too should plough
> and sow before you eat."  
>  5. "I too Brahmin, do plough and do sow before I eat."  
>  6. "I fail, however, to see the worthy Gautama's yoke, or plough,
> or ploughshare, or goad, or ox-team--albeit, he asserts that he
> ploughs and sows before he eats.  
>  7. "You claim to be a tiller, though we see none of your tillage.
> Tell us how you till; for of your tilling we would fain hear more."  
>  8. "My seed is faith; austerity of life my rain; wisdom my yoke
> and plough; my pole is fear to err; with thought to strap the yoke,
> and mindfulness for plough share and the goad," replied the Lord.  
>  9. "Watchful o'er word and deed, and temperate in diet, I make in
> sight weed my crop, nor rest till final bliss is harvested. Effort is
> my stout ox, which turns not back at headlands; straight to Peace he
> bears me on, to that last bourne where anguish is no more. Thus, I
> till with Deathlessness for crop. And who tills as I, is freed from
> ills."  
>  10. Thereupon the Brahmin served up milk-rice on a great bronze
> dish and offered it to the Lord, saying: "Eat this, Gautama, a tiller
> indeed art thou, in that thou tillest a crop that is deathless."  
>  11. But the Lord said, "I take no chanter's fee. Seers countenance
> it not; the Enlighten'd scout such fees; and while this Doctrine
> lasts, this practice must hold good. Provided with other fare, a sage
> of holy calm, consummate, cankerless; merit to reap,--sow there."  
>  12. On hearing these words, the Brahmin went over to the Lord,
> and, bowing his head at the Lord's feet, cried: "Wonderful, Gautama;
> quite wonderful! Just as a man might set upright again what had fallen
> down, or reveal what had been hidden away, or tell a man who had gone
> astray which was his way, or bring a lamp into darkness so that those
> with eyes to see might see the things about them,--even so, in many
> ways, has Gautama made his Doctrine clear!  
>  13. "To the reverend Gautama I come for refuge, and to his
> Doctrine and to his community. Be it mine to receive admission and
> confirmation at the hands of the Lord!" So the Brahmin Kasi-Bharadvaja
> was admitted, and confirmed as an almsman of the Lord.
>
>   
> §3. Charge of Breaking Happy Households
>
>  1. Seeing that many distinguished young Magadha noblemen had
> become the discipJes of the Blessed One, people became annoyed and
> angry, saying: "The Samana Gautama causes parents to be childless; the
> Samana Gautama causes wives to become widows; the Samana Gautama
> causes the uprooting of families.  
>  2. "Now he has ordained one thousand Jatilas, and he has ordained
> these two hundred and fifty wandering ascetics who were followers of
> Sanjaya, and these many distinguished young Magadha clansmen are now
> leading a holy life under the Samana Gautama. What will happen next?
> No one can say!"  
>  3. And, moreover, when they saw the monks they chide\[d\] them in
> the following terms: "The great Samana has come to Giribhaja (i.e.,
> Ragagaha) of the Magadha people, leading with him all the followers of
> Sanjaya; who will be the next to be led by him?"  
>  4. The monks heard this accusation, and they reported it to the
> Blessed One.  
>  5. The Blessed One replied, "This noise, monks, will not last
> long; it will last only seven days; after seven days it will be
> over.  
>  6. "And if they chide you, monks, you should reply that it is
> truly by a good Dhamma that the great heroes, the Tathagatas, lead.
> Who will murmur at the wise, why grudge the wise leading men
> righteously? There is no compulsion in my Dhamma. One is free to leave
> home. One is free to remain attached to his home."  
>  7. When the Bhikkhus replied to the revilers as the Blessed One
> had directed, then the people understood: "It is by Dhamma, and not
> unrighteously, that the Sakyaputtiya Samana leads men:; and \[they\]
> ceased to accuse the Blessed One.
>
>   
> § 4. Jains and a False Charge of Murder
>
>  1. The Tirthikas'were beginning to feel that the people no longer
> respected them, with the appearance of Samana Gautama, and that even
> some people did not know of their existence.  
>  2. So, "Let us see whether with the connivance of somebody, we can
> lower his prestige," thought the Tirthikas. "Perhaps with Sundari's
> help we might succeed."  
>  3. And they approached Sundari and said to her, "Sister, you are
> extremely beautiful and charming. If you spread a scandal about Samana
> Gautama, the people might believe it, and it would lower his
> influence."  
>  4. Sundari used to go every evening towards the Jetavana with
> garlands, camphor, and sweet scents when the people used to return to
> the city; and if anybody asked her, "Sundari, where are you going?"
> she used to answer, "I am going to Samana Gautama to stay within the
> garden house (Gandha Kutir)."  
>  5. And staying the night in some gardens of the Tirthikas, she
> used to return in the morning, and if anybody asked her where she had
> spent the night, she would say that she had spent the night with
> Gautama.  
>  6. After a few days the Tirthikas hired a few assassins and told
> them, "Kill Sundari, and throw her body on the rubbish heap near
> Gautama's Gandha Kutir." This the assassins did.  
>  7. Then the Tirthikas brought it to the notice of the officers of
> peace and justice that Sundari used to frequent Jetavana, and she was
> missing.  
>  8. So with the assistance of the officers, they found Sundari's
> body on the rubbish heap.  
>  9. And the Tirthikas accused the disciples of Gautama to have
> \[=of having\] killed Sundari in order to hide the shame of their
> leader.  
>  10. But the assassins began to quarrel amongst themselves, in a
> liquor shop, about the distribution of the prize money for having
> killed Sundari.  
>  11. The officers at once arrested them; and they admitted their
> guilt, and implicated the Tirthikas at whose instigation they had
> committed the crime.  
>  12. Thus the Tirthikas lost whatever influence was left for them.
>
>   
> § 5. Jains and a False Charge of Immorality
>
>  1. As with the sunrise the glow-worms vanish, so miserable became
> the situation of the Tirthikas. The people ceased to pay them respects
> or \[give them\] presents.  
>  2. Standing on the public streets they used to harangue: "If
> Samana Gautama is enlightened (Buddha), we are also. If you acquire
> virtue by showering presents on the Buddha, you will get the same by
> giving us presents. Therefore make gift to us."  
>  3. But the public paid no heed to it. So they conspired in secret
> how by spreading scandal on \[=about\] the character of Samana
> Gautama, they could discredit the Sangha.  
>  4. At that time there used to live in Shravasti a Brahmani
> Parivrajaka, known as Chincha. In bodily formation and physical charms
> she was a seductive beauty. She used to radiate voluptuous grace with
> her bodily movements.  
>  5. One of the crafty schemers among the Tirthikas said that with
> the help of Chincha it would be easy to spread a scandal about
> Gautama, and thereby discredit him; to which other Tirthikas gave
> their consent.  
>  6. Then one day Chincha came to the park of the Tirthikas and,
> saluting them, sat near them. But nobody talked with her.  
>  7. Surprised at this, she said, "How have I offended you? I have
> saluted you thrice, though you do not say a single word to me."  
>  8. "Sister," the Tirthikas said, "Don't you know that Samana
> Gautama is causing us harm and loss by his popularity?" "I do not know
> that. And have I got any duty to perform toward its solution?"  
>  9. "Sister, if you mean to do us good, then by your own efforts,
> spread scandals about Gautama, and thus make him unpopular." "All
> right, be content, and depend \[for\] that on me." Saying thus, she
> left the place.  
>  10. Chincha was an expert in feminine charms and coquetry. When
> the citizens of Shravasti used to return from the religious
> discussions at Jetavana, Chincha, wearing a red garment and with
> perfumes and garlands in her hands, used to go towards it.  
>  11. If anybody asked her, "Where are you going now?" \[then\]
> "That's none of your business," she used to answer. Spending the night
> at the rest house of the Itinerants (Tirthikarama) near Jetavana, she
> used to return to the city in the morning, when the citizens used to
> go to the Jetavana to pay respect to the Buddha.  
>  12. If anybody asked her, "Where did you spend the night? she
> used to say, "That is none of your business. I spent the night with
> Samana Gautama in his garden house (Gandha Kutir) at Jetavana." The
> remark used to create doubts in the minds of some.  
>  13. After four months, she used to increase the size of her belly
> by wrapping round it some old rags, and say that she became pregnant
> through Samana Gautama. Some began to believe it.  
>  14. In the ninth month, she, suspending a wooden protuberance
> round her belly and having arms swollen through insect bites, appeared
> before the Buddha when he was making a religious discourse before
> monks and laymen ,and said, "Great teacher, you give many people
> religious lessons. Your voice is sweet, and your lips are very tender.
> Through cohabitation with you I have been pregnant, and my delivery
> time is near.  
>  15. "You have not fixed any delivery place for me, nor I do see
> any medicine for that emergency. If you cannot do that yourself, why
> don't you appoint one of your disciples, the king of Kosala,
> Anathpindika, or Visakha for that purpose?  
>  16. "It seems you know well how to seduce a girl, but you do not
> know how to take care of the new-born baby that is born out of the
> seduction." The assembly remained silent.  
>  17. The Buddha, breaking the continuity of his lecture, answered
> her with reserved dignity, "Sister, whatever you have said, whether
> true or false, is only known to us both."  
>  18. Chincha, coughing loudly, said. "Yes, O Teacher, such a thing
> can be known to us only."  
>  19. With her coughing, the knot with which the wooden protuberance
> was tied round her belly slackened, and it fell on her feet, to her
> discomfiture.  
>  20. And she was turned away with stones and sticks.
>
>   
> § 6. Devadatta, a Cousin and an Enemy
>
>  1. Devadatta was a cousin of the Buddha. But from the beginning he
> was jealous of the Buddha, and disliked him intensely.  
>  2. When the Buddha had left his home, Devadatta tried to make love
> to Yeshodhara.  
>  3. Once when Yeshodhara was about to retire, he, without being
> intercepted by anybody, entered into her chamber in the guise of a
> monk. She asked him, "Bhikkhu, what do you want? Have you got any
> message for me from my husband?"  
>  4. "Your husband, he cares a damn for you! In your house of
> happiness, he cruelly and wickedly abandoned you," said Devadatta.  
>  5. "But he did it for the good of many," replied Yeshodhara.  
>  6. "Whatever that \[may\] be, now take revenge on his disdainful
> cruelty to you," suggested Devadatta.  
>  7. "Stop it, O Monk--your words and thoughts are impure,"
> countered Yeshodhara.  
>  8. "Don't you recognize me, Yeshodhara? I am Devadatta who loves
> you."  
>  9. "Devadatta, I knew you to be false and vile. I thought you
> would make a bad monk, but did not suspect you to be so
> mean-minded."  
>  10. "Yeshodhara, Yeshodhara, I love you" pleaded Devadatta. "And
> your husband shows you nothing but contempt. He has been cruel to you.
> Love me and revenge his cruelty."  
>  11. Yeshodhara's pale and emaciated face became tinged with a
> purple hue. Tears rolled down her cheeks.  
>  12. "Devadatta, it is you who are cruel to me. Even if your love
> were sincere, it would have been an insult to me. You are simply lying
> when you say you love me.  
>  13. "When I was young and pretty, you hardly looked at me. Now
> \[when\] I am old, broken down by sorrow and anguish, you have come at
> night to declare your treacherous and guilty love. You are a base
> coward."  
>  14. And she shouted, "Devadatta, get out from the place." And
> Devadatta left the place.  
>  15. Devadatta was very angry with the Buddha who did not make him
> the chief in the Sangh, and instead made Sariputta and Mogallana the
> chief men in the Sangh. Devadatta made three attempts on the Buddha's
> life, but did not succeed in any of them.  
>  16. At one time the Blessed One was walking up and down in the
> shade below the hill called the Vultures Peak (Girdhra Kuta).  
>  17. Devadatta climbed it up \[=up on it\] and hurled down a large
> stone with the intention of depriving the Blessed One of his life, but
> it fell upon another rock and there it was entombed; only a splinter
> falling from it made the foot. of the Blessed One to bleed.  
>  18. A second time he made an attempt to take the life of the
> Buddha.  
>  19. This time Devadatta went to Prince Ajatasatru and said, "Give
> me some men." And Ajatasatru the prince gave orders to his men:
> "Whatsoever the worthy Devadatta tells you, do that."  
>  20. Then to one man Devadatta gave command: "Go, my friend; the
> Samana Gautama is staying at such a place. Kill him." And the man
> returned and said to him, "I cannot deprive the Blessed One of his
> life."  
>  21. He made a third attempt on the life of the Buddha.  
>  22. This time there was at Rajgraha an elephant named Nalagiri,
> fierce and a man-slayer.  
>  23. And Devadatta went into Rajgraha and to the elephant stables,
> and said to the elephant keepers: "I, my friends, am a relative of the
> raja, and am able to advance a man occupying a low position to a high
> position, and to order an increase of his rations or of his pay."  
>  24. Therefore, my friends, when Samana Gautama shall have arrived
> at this carriage road, then loose the elephant Nalagiri and let him go
> down the road.  
>  25. Devadatta engaged archers to kill the Buddha. He had also let
> loose on his way the mad elephant Nalagiri.  
>  26. But he did not succeed. When these attempts became known,
> Devadatta lost all the public endowments given to him. And even the
> king (Ajatasatru) stopped giving him interview.  
>  27. For \[a\] living he had to beg from house to house. Devadatta
> received many favours from Ajatasatru, which he could not retain long.
> Devadatta lost all his influence after the Nalagiri incident.  
>  28. By his acts, Devadatta, becoming very unpopular in Magadha,
> left it for Kosala, thinking that Prasenjit might receive him
> cordially. But he was contemptuously driven out by Prasenjit.
>
>   
> § 7. Brahmins and the Buddha
>
> (7.i)
>
>  1. Once when the Blessed One was travelling about in the Kosala
> country with a large company of the monks, he went down to a Brahmin
> village named Thuna.  
>  2. The Brahmin householders of Thuna heard the news: "The Samana
> Gautama, they say, has arrived in the field of our village."  
>  3. Now the Brahmin householders were nonbelievers, holding wrong
> views and avaricious by nature.  
>  4. They said, "If the Samana Gautama should enter this village and
> stay two or three days, he would convert all these people. Then the
> Brahmin religion would have no support. We must, therefore, prevent
> his entry in our village."  
>  5. To reach the village a river had to be crossed; and the
> Brahmins, in order to prevent the Blessed One from entering the
> village, took the boats away from the landing places, and made the
> bridges and causeways unusable.  
>  6. They filled all the wells except one with weeds and the like,
> and concealed the watering-places, rest-houses, and sheds.  
>  7. The Blessed One learned of their misdeeds and, having
> compassion on them, crossed the river with his company of monks, went
> on, and in due course of time reached the Brahmin village of Thuna.  
>  8. He left the road and sat down at the foot of a tree. At that
> moment many women were passing by near the Blessed One, carrying
> water.  
>  9. And in that village an agreement had been made: "If the Samana
> Gautama comes there, there is to be no welcome or the like made for
> him; and when he comes to a house, neither to him nor to his disciples
> is any food or water to be given."  
>  10. Then a certain Brahmin's slave girl, going along with a jar of
> water, saw the Blessed One and the monks, realized that they were
> weary and thirsty, and, being of devout heart, wanted to give them
> water.  
>  11. "Even and though the people of this village have resolved that
> nothing at all is to be given to the Samana Gautama and not even a
> show of respect is to be made," she said to herself, "yet if after I
> have found these supreme fields of merit and worthy recipients of
> meritorious giving, I do not lay the foundation for my salvation by a
> mere giving of water, when hereafter shall I be released from woe?"  
>  12. "So be it, my masters! Let everyone who lives in the village
> beat or bind me, still I will give a gift of water to a field of merit
> such as this."  
>  13. When she had made this resolve, though the other women
> carrying water tried to stop her, without regard for her life she
> lifted down the water jar from her head, placed it on one side,
> approached the Blessed One, and gave him water; he washed his hands
> and feet, and drank the water.  
>  14. Her master, the Brahmin, heard of her giving water to the
> Blessed One. "She has broken the rule of the village, and I am
> blamed," he said; and burning with rage and grinding his teeth, he
> hurled her to the ground and beat her with hands and feet. Because of
> that she died.
>
> (7.ii)
>
>  1. Now Brahmin Dona visited the Exalted One and greeted him; and
> after exchanging the customary words of greetings, sat down at one
> side. So seated, Brahmin Dona said to the Exalted One :  
>  2. I have heard it said, Master Gautama, that Master Gautama does
> not salute aged, venerable Brahmins, well stricken in years, long on
> life's road, grown old, nor rise up for them, nor offer them a seat.  
>  3. "Master Gautama, it is just so; Master Gautama does none of
> these things...to aged, venerable Brahmins . . . This is not right,
> Master Gautama."  
>  4. "Do you not profess to be a brahmin, Dona?"  
>  5. "If of anyone. Master Gautama, in speaking rightly it should be
> said: 'The brahmin is well born on both sides', pure in descent as far
> back as seven generations, both of mother and father, unchallenged and
> without reproach in point of birth; studious, carrying the mantras in
> mind, a past master in the three Vedas with the indices and ritual, in
> phonology too, and in the legends; an expert in verse and grammar
> skilled in reading the marks of a great man, in speculation on the
> universe'--to be sure, of me, Master Gautama, in speaking rightly that
> thing should be said; for I, Master Gautama, am so born ...so
> skilled..."  
>  6. "Dona, those Brahmin-sages of old, mantra-makers,
> mantra-sayers, whose ancient collection of mantra verses, hymns, and
> sayings. Brahmins know every hymn, every saying, every word the
> \[=by\] word--ever have the sayings said, to wit, \[that\]: Atthaka,
> Vamaka, Vamadeva. Vassamitta, Yamadaggi, Angirasa, Bharadvaja, have
> declared: the Brahma-like, the deva-like, the bounded, the breaker of
> bounds, and fifthly, the Brahmin outcast. Which of them, Dona, are
> you?"  
>  7. "We know not of these five \[kinds of\] Brahmins, Master
> Gautama; yet we know that we are Brahmins. It were well for me if
> Master Gautama would teach me Dhamma so that I may know of them
> \[=those\] five."  
>  8. "Then listen, Brahma, give heed and I will speak!"  
>  9. "Yes sir," replied he; and the Exalted One said:  
>  10. "And how, Dona, becomes a Brahmin Brahma-like?"  
>  11. "Take the case, Dona, of a Brahmin who is well born on both
> sides, pure in descent as far back as seven generations, both of
> mother and father, unchallenged and without reproach in point of
> birth--he for eight and forty years leads to the Brahma-life of
> virginity, applying himself to the teacher's fee for teaching
> according to Dhamma, not non-Dhamma.  
>  12. "And what there is Dhamma, Dona? Never as ploughman nor trader
> nor cowherd nor bowman nor rajah's man nor by any craft (to get his
> living), but solely by going about for alms, despising not the
> beggar's bowl.  
>  13. "And he hands over the teacher's fee for teaching, has his
> hair-beard shaved off, dons the yellow robe, and goes forth from the
> home to the homeless life.  
>  14. "And thus gone forth, he abides in mind pervading with amity
> one world quarter, so a second, a third, a fourth; then above, below,
> athwart, everywhere, the whole wide world he pervades with thoughts of
> amity, far-reaching, expansive, measureless, without hatred or
> ill-will.  
>  15. "He abides in mind pervading with pity...sympathy...poise, one
> world quarter, so a second, a third, a fourth; then above, below,
> athwart, every-where, the whole wide world he pervades with thoughts
> of pity, sympathy, and poise, far-reaching, expansive, measureless,
> without hatred or ill-will.  
>  16. "And having made these four Brahma-abidings become, on the
> breaking up of the body after death, he arises in the well-faring
> Brahma world. Thus, Dona, \[a\] Brahmin becomes Brahma-like.  
>  17. "And how, Dona, becomes a Brahmin deva-like?  
>  18. "Take the case, Dona, of a Brahmin of similar birth and
> conduct.... He does not get a living by ploughing and so forth, but by
> going about for alms.... He hands over the teacher's fee for teaching
> and seeks a wife according to Dhamma, not non-Dhamma.  
>  19. "And what then is Dhamma? Not with one bought or sold, but
