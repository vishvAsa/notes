DEAR SIR,

I am so very glad to learn from a person of your authority of the good
work Sister Nivedita is doing in England. I join in earnest prayer with
the hopes you entertain of her future services to India by her pen.

I have not the least desire that she should leave her present field of
utility and come over to India.

I am under a deep debt of gratitude to you, Sir, for your befriending my
child, and hope you will never cease to advise her as to the length of
her stay in England and the line of work she ought to undertake.

Her book on Kāli has been very popular in India. The debt our Motherland
already owes you is immense, and we are anxiously awaiting the new book
of yours.

May all blessings ever attend you and yours is the constant prayer of —

Yours humbly,  
VIVEKANANDA.
