## SOUL AND GOD

Anything that is in space has form. Space itself has form. Either you
are in space, or space is in you. The soul is beyond all space. Space is
in the soul, not the soul in space.

Form is confined to time and space and is bound by the law of causation.
All time is in us, we are not in time. As the soul is not in time and
space, all time and space are within the soul. The soul is therefore
omnipresent.

Our idea of God is the reflection of ourselves.

Old Persian and Sanskrit have affinities.

The primitive idea of God was identifying God with different forms of
nature â€” nature-worship. The next stage was the tribal God. The next
stage, the worship of kings.

The idea of God in heaven is predominant in all nations except in India.
The idea is very crude.

The idea of the continuity of life is foolish. We can never get rid of
death until we get rid of life.
