> § 1. Buddha's Conception of What a Bhikkhu Should Be
>
>  1. The Buddha has himself told the Bhikkhus what he expected of
> them as Bhikkhus. This is what he has said:  
>  2. "He who wishes to put on the yellow dress without having
> cleansed himself from sin, who disregards also temperance and truth,
> is unworthy of the yellow dress.  
>  3. "But he who has cleansed himself from sin, is well grounded in
> all virtues, and \[is\] endowed also with temperance and truth, he is
> indeed worthy of the yellow dress.  
>  4. "A man is not a mendicant (Bhikkhu) simply because he asks
> others for alms; he who adopts the whole law is a Bhikkhu, not he who
> only begs.  
>  5. "He who is above evil, who is chaste, who with care passes
> through the world, he indeed is called a Bhikkhu.  
>  6. "Not only by discipline and vows, not only by much learning,
> not by entering into a trance, not by sleeping alone, do I earn the
> happiness of release which no worldling can know. O Bhikkhu, he who
> has obtained the extinction of desires, has obtained confidence.  
>  7. "The Bhikkhu who controls his mouth, who speaks wisely and
> calmly, who teaches the meaning of the law, his word is sweet.  
>  8. "He who dwells in the. law, delights in the law, meditates on
> the law, recollects the law, that Bhikkhu will never fall away from
> the true law.  
>  9. "Let him not despise what he has received, nor ever envy
> others; a mendicant who envies others does not obtain peace of mind.  
>  10. "A Bhikkhu who, though he receives little, does not despise
> what he has received, even the gods will praise him, if his life is
> pure, and if he is not slothful.  
>  11. "He who never identifies himself with name and form, and does
> not grieve over what is no more, he indeed is called a Bhikkhu.  
>  12. "The Bhikkhu who behaves with kindness, who is happy in the
> doctrine of Buddha, will reach Nibbana--happiness arising from the
> cessation of natural inclinations.  
>  13. "O Bhikkhu, empty this boat! If emptied, it will go quickly;
> having cut off passion and hatred, thou wilt go to Nibbana.  
>  14. "Cut off the five (fetters), leave the five, rise above the
> five. A Bhikkhu who has escaped from the five fetters, he is called
> Oghatinna, 'saved from the flood'.  
>  15. "Meditate, O Bhikkhu, and be not heedless! Do not direct thy
> thought to what gives pleasure.  
>  16. "Without knowledge there is no meditation; without meditation
> there is no knowledge; he who has knowledge and meditation is near
> unto Nibbana.  
>  17. "A Bhikkhu who has entered his empty house, and whose mind is
> tranquil, feels a more than human delight when he sees the Dhamma
> clearly.  
>  18. "And this is the beginning here for a wise Bhikku:
> watchfulness over the senses, contentedness, restraint under the
> Dhamma; keep noble friends whose life is pure, and who are not
> slothful.  
>  19. "Let him live on charity, let him be perfect in his duties;
> then in the fulness of delight he will make an end of suffering.  
>  20. "Rouse thyself by thyself, examine thyself by thyself; thus
> self-protected and attentive wilt thou live happily, O Bhikkhu.  
>  21. "For self is the lord of self, self is the refuge of self;
> therefore curb thyself, as the merchant curbs a noble horse.  
>  22. "A Bhikkhu (mendicant) who delights in earnestness, who looks
> with fear on thoughtlessness, moves about like fire, burning all his
> fetters, small or large.  
>  23. "A Bhikkhu (mendicant) who delights in reflection, who looks
> with fear on thoughtlessness, cannot fall away (from his perfect
> state)--he is close upon Nibbana."  
>  24. The disciples of Gautama (Buddha) are always well awake, and
> their thoughts day and night are always set on Buddha,  
>  25. The disciples of Gautama are always well awake, and their
> thoughts day and night are always set on the church.  
>  26. The disciples of Gautama are always well awake, and their
> thoughts day and night are always set on the Dhamma.  
>  27. The disciples of Gautama are always well awake, and their
> thoughts day and night are always set on their body.  
>  28. The disciples of Gautama are always well awake, and their
> minds day and night always delight in compassion.  
>  29. The disciples of Gautama are always well awake, and their
> minds day and night always delight in meditation.  
>  30. It is hard to leave the world (to become a friar), it is hard
> to enjoy the world; hard is the monastery, painful are the houses;
> painful it is to dwell with equals (to share everything in common),
> and the itinerant mendicant is beset with pain.  
>  31. A man full of faith, if endowed with virtue and glory, is
> respected, whatever place he may choose.
>
>   
> § 2. The Bhikkhu and the Ascetic
>
>  1. Is the Bhikkhu an ascetic? The answer is in the negative.  
>  2. This negative answer has been given by the Blessed Lord
> himself, in a discussion withNigrodha the wanderer.  
>  3. The Exalted One was once staying near Rajagraha, on the
> Vulture's Peak. Now at that time there was sojourning in Queen
> Udumbarika's Park assigned to the wanderers, the wanderer Nigrodha,
> together with a great company of wanderers.  
>  4. Now the Exalted One, descending from the Vulture's Peak came to
> the Peacock's Feeding-Ground on the bank of the Sumagadha, and there
> walked to and fro in the open air. Then Nigrodha saw him thus walking,
> and on seeing him he called his company to order, saying: "Be still,
> sirs, and make no noise. The Samana Gautama is by the bank of the
> Sumagadha." When he had said this the wanderers kept silence.  
>  5. Then the Exalted One went up to Nigrodha the wanderer, and
> Nigrodha spake thus to him: "Let the Lord, the Exalted One, approach.
> Welcome is the Lord, the Exalted One! Long has the Lord, the Exalted
> One, taken ere deciding on this step of coming hither. May it please
> the Lord, the Exalted One, to take a seat. Here is one ready."  
>  6. The Exalted One sat down on the seat made ready, and Nigrodha,
> taking a low seat, sat beside him.  
>  7. Thereupon Nigrodha said to the Exalted One, "As the Samana
> Gautama has come to out assembly, we would like to ask him this
> question: 'What, Lord, is this religion of the Exalted One, wherein he
> trains his disciples, and which those disciples, so trained by the
> Exalted One as to win comfort, acknowledge to be their utmost support
> and the fundamental principles of righteousness?'"  
>  8. "Difficult is it, Nigrodha, for one of another view, of another
> persuasion, of another confession, without practice and without
> teaching, to understand that wherein I train my disciples, and which
> they, so trained as to win comfort, acknowledge to be their utmost
> support and the fundamental principle of righteousness.  
>  9. "But ask me, Nigrodha, a question about your own doctrine,
> about austere scrupulousness of life: in what does the fulfilment, in
> what does the non-fulfilment of these self-mortifications consist?"  
>  10. Then Nigrodha spake thus to the Exalted One: "We, Lord,
> profess self-mortifying austerities; we hold them to be essential; we
> cleave to them. In what does the fulfilment, in what does the
> nonfulfilment of them consist?"  
>  11. "Suppose, Nigrodha, that an ascetic goes naked, is of certain
> loose habits, licks his hands, respects no 'approach, sir', nor 'stop,
> sir'; accepts nothing expressly brought, nor expressly prepared, nor
> any invitations. He accepts nothing taken from \[the\] mouth of \[a\]
> cooking-pot; nor placed within the threshold, nor within a mortar, nor
> among sticks, nor within a quern; nor anything from two eating
> together, nor from a pregnant woman, nor from a nursing mother; nor
> from a woman in intercourse with a man; nor food collected in drought;
> nor from where a dog is; nor from where flies are swarming; nor will
> he accept fish or meat; nor drink strong drink, nor intoxicants, nor
> gruel. He is either a one-houser, a one-mouthful man; or a two -ouser,
> a two-mouthful man; or a seven-houser, a seven-mouthful man. He
> maintains himself on one alms, on two, or on seven. He takes food once
> a day, or once every two days, or once every seven days. Thus does he
> dwell addicted to the the practice of taking food according to rule,
> at regular intervals, up to even half a month. He feeds either on
> pot-herbs, or wild rice, or nivara seeds, or leather parings, or on
> hata, or on the powder in rice rusks, on rice-scum, on flour or
> oil-seeds, on grasses, on cowdung, or fruits and roots from the wood,
> or on windfalls. He wears coarse hempen cloth, coarse mixture cloth,
> discarded corpse-cloths, discarded rags, or tirita-bark cloth; or
> again he wears antelope-hide, or strips of the same netted, or kusa
> fibre, or bark garments, or shale cloth, or a human-hair blanket, or a
> horse-hair blanket, or an owl's-feather garment. He is a
> hair-and-beard plucker, addicted to the practice of plucking out both;
> a stander-up; a croucher on heels, addicted to exerting himself (to
> move forward) when thus squatting; a bed-of-thorns man, putting iron
> spikes or thorns on his couch; he uses a plank-bed; sleeps on the
> ground; sleeps only on one side; is a dust-and-dirt wearer and an
> open-air-man; a where-you-will sitter; a filth-eater, addicted to the
> practice of eating such; a non-drinker, addicted to the practice of
> drinking (cold water); an even-for-third-time-man.  
>  12. "After having done this, Nigrodha," the Blessed Lord said,
> "What think you, Nigrodha? If these things be so, is the austerity of
> self-mortification carried out, or is it not?" " Truly, Lord, if these
> things be so, the austerity of self-mortification is carried out."  
>  13. "Now I, Nigrodha, affirm that austerity by self-mortification
> thus carried out, involves blemish in several ways."  
>  14. "In what way. Lord, do you affirm that blemish is involved?"  
>  15. "In case, Nigrodha, when an ascetic undertakes a course of
> austerity, he through that course becomes self-complacent, his aim is
> satisfied. Now this, Nigrodha, becomes a blemish in the ascetic.  
>  16. "And then again, Nigrodha, when an ascetic undertakes a course
> of austerity, he through that undertaking exalts himself and despises
> others. This, too, becomes a blemish in the ascetic.  
>  17. "And again, Nigrodha, when an ascetic undertakes a course of
> austerity, he through that undertaking becomes inebriated and
> infatuated, and grows careless. This, too, becomes a blemish in the
> ascetic.  
>  18. "And again, Nigrodha, when an ascetic undertakes a course of
> austerity, it procures for him gifts, attention and fame. Thereby he
> becomes complacent and his aim is satisfied. This, too, becomes a
> blemish in the ascetic.  
>  19. "And again, Nigrodha, by the winning of gifts, attention, and
> fame, the ascetic exalts himself and despises others. This, too,
> becomes a blemish in the ascetic.  
>  20. "And again, Nigrodha, by the winning of gifts, attention, and
> fame, he becomes inebriated and infatuated, and grows careless. This,
> too, becomes a blemish in the ascetic.  
>  21. "And again, Nigrodha, when an ascetic undertakes a course of
> austerity, he comes to make a distinction in foods, saying: 'This
> suits me; this doesn't suit me'. The latter kind he deliberately
> rejects. Over the former he waxes greedy and infatuated, and cleaves
> to them, seeing not the danger in them, discerning them not as unsafe,
> and so enjoys them. This, too, becomes a blemish in the ascetic.  
>  22. "And again, Nigrodha, because of his longing for gifts,
> attentions, and fame, he thinks: 'Rajas will pay me attentions, and so
> will their officials; so too will nobles, Brahmins, house-holders, and
> founders of schools. This, too, becomes a blemish in the ascetic.  
>  23. "And again, Nigrodha, an asectic gets grumbling at some
> recluse or Brahmin, saying: 'That man lives on all sorts of things:
> things grown from tubers, or shoots, or berries, or joints, or
> fifthly, from seeds, munching them all up together with that
> wheel-less thunderbolt of a jawbone--and they call him a holy man!'
> This, too becomes a blemish in the ascetic.  
>  24. "And again, Nigrodha, an ascetic sees a certain recluse or
> Brahmin receiving attentions, being revered, honoured, and presented
> with offerings by the citizens. And seeing this he thinks: 'The
> citizens pay attention to this fellow who lives in luxury; they revere
> and honour him, and present him with offerings, while to me who, as
> ascetic, lives a really austere life, they pay no attentions, nor
> reverence, nor honour, nor offerings.' And so he cherishes envy and
> grudging at the citizens. This, too, becomes a blemish in the
> ascetic.  
>  25. "And again, Nigrodha, the ascetic affects the mysterious. When
> asked: 'Do you approve of this?' he, not approving, says: 'I do', or
> approving, says, 'I do not'. Thus he consciously tells untruths. This,
> too, becomes a blemish in the ascetic.  
>  26. "And again, Nigrodha, the ascetic is liable to lose his temper
> and bear enmity. This, too, becomes a blemish in the ascetic.  
>  27. "And again, Nigrodha, the ascetic is liable to be hypocritical
> and deceitful, as well as envious and grudging; he becomes cunning and
> crafty, hard-hearted and vain; he entertains evil wishes and becomes
> captive to them; he entertains false opinions, becomes possessed of
> metempirical dogma, misinterprets his experience, is avaricious and
> adverse from renunciation. This, too, becomes a blemish in the
> ascetic.  
>  28. "What think you of this, Nigrodha? Are these things blemishes
> in the austerities of self-mortification, or are they not?"  
>  29. "Verily, Lord, these things are blemishes in the austerities
> of self-mortification. It is possible, Lord, that an ascetic may be
> possessed even of all these blemishes, much more by one or other of
> them."  
>  30. The Bhikkhus are not to be guilty of these blemishes.
>
>   
> §3. The Bhikkhu and the Brahmin
>
>  1. Is the Bhikkhu the same as the Brahmin? The answer to this
> question is also in the negative.  
>  2. The discussion of the subject has not been concentrated at any
> one place. It is scattered all over. But the points of distinction can
> be easily summed up.  
>  3. A Brahmin is a priest. His main function is to perform certain
> ceremonies connected with birth, marriage, and death.  
>  4. These ceremonies become necessary because of the doctrine of
> original sin, which requires ceremonies to wash it off, and because of
> the belief in God and in Soul.  
>  5. For these ceremonies a priest is necessary. A Bhikkhu does not
> believe in original sin, in God and Soul. There are, therefore, no
> ceremonies to be performed. He is, therefore, not a priest.  
>  6. A Brahmin is born. A Bhikkhu is made.  
>  7. A Brahmin has a caste. A Bhikkhu has no caste.  
>  8. Once a Brahmin always a Brahmin. No sin, no crime, can unmake a
> Brahmin.  
>  9. But once a Bhikkhu is not always a Bhikkhu. A Bhikkhu is made.
> So he can be unmade, if by his conduct he makes himself unworthy of
> remaining a Bhikkhu.  
>  10. No mental or moral training is necessary for being a Brahmin.
> All that is expected (only expected) of him is to know his religious
> lore.  
>  11. Quite different is the case of the Bhikkhu; mental and moral
> training is his life-blood.  
>  12. A Brahmin is free to acquire \[an\] unlimited amount of
> property for himself. A Bhikkhu, on the other hand, cannot,  
>  13. This is no small difference. Property is the severest
> limitation upon the mental and moral independence of man, both in
> respect of thought and action. It produces a conflict between the two.
> That is why the Brahmin is always opposed to change. For to him, a
> change means loss of power and loss of pelf.  
>  14. A Bhikkhu, having no property, is mentally and morally free.
> In his case, there are no personal interests which can stand in the
> way of honesty and integrity.  
>  15. They are Brahmins. Nonetheless, each Brahmin is an individual
> by himself. There is no religious organisation to which he is
> subordinate. A Brahmin is a law unto himself. They are bound by common
> interests which are material.  
>  16. A Bhikkhu on the other hand is always a member of the Sangh.
> It is inconceivable that there could be a Bhikkhu without his being a
> member of the Sangh. A Bhikkhu is not a law unto himself. He is
> subordinate to the Sangh. The Sangh is a spiritual organisation.
>
>   
> § 4. The Bhikkhu and the Upasaka
>
>  1. In the Dhamma, there is a marked distinction between the Dhamma
> of the Bhikku and the Dhamma of the Upasaka or the layman.  
>  2. The Bhikkhu is bound to celibacy. Not so the Upasaka. He can
> marry.  
>  3. The Bhikkhu can have no home. He can have no family. Not so the
> Upasaka. The Upasaka can have a home and can have a family.  
>  4. The Bhikkhu is not to have any property. But an Upasaka can
> have property.  
>  5. The Bhikkhu is forbidden from taking life. Not so the Upasaka.
> He may.  
>  6. The Panchasilas are common to both. But to the Bhikkhu they are
> vows. He cannot break them without incurring \[a\] penalty. To the
> Upasaika they are precepts to be followed.  
>  7. The Bhikkhu's observance of the Panchasilas is compulsory.
> Their observance by the Upasakas is voluntary.  
>  8. Why did the Blessed Lord make such a distinction? There must be
> some good reason for it. For the Blessed Lord would not do anything
> unless there was some good reason for it.  
>  9. The reason for this distinction is nowhere explicitly stated by
> the Blessed Lord. It is left to be inferred. All the same, it is
> necessary to know the reason for this distinction.  
>  10. There is no doubt that the Blessed Lord wanted through his
> Dhamma to lay the foundation of a kingdom of righteousness on earth.
> That is why he preached his Dhanmia to all without distinction, to
> Bhikkus as well as to laymen.  
>  11. But the Blessed Lord also knew that merely preaching the
> Dhamma to the common men would not result in the creation of that
> ideal society based on righteousness.  
>  12. An ideal must be practical, and must be shown to be
> practicable. Then and then only \[do\] people strive after it and try
> to realise it.  
>  13. To create this striving, it is necessary to have a picture of
> a society working on the basis of the ideal, and thereby proving to
> the common man that the ideal was not impracticable but on the other
> hand realisable.  
>  14. The Sangh is a model of a society realising the Dhamma
> preached by the Blessed Lord.  
>  15. This is the reason why the Blessed Lord made this distinction
> between the Bhikkhu and the Upasaka. The Bhikkhu was the torch-bearer
> of the Buddha's ideal society, and the Upasaka was to follow the
> Bhikkhu as closely as he could.  
>  16. There is also another question that requires an answer. What
> is the function of the Bhikkhu?  
>  17. Is the Bhikkhu to devote himself to self-culture, or is he to
> serve the people and guide them?  
>  18. He must discharge both the functions.  
>  19. Without self-culture he is not fit to guide. Therefore he must
> himself be a perfect, best man, \[a\] righteous man and an enlightened
> man. For this he must practice self-culture.  
>  20. A Bhikkhu leaves his home. But he does not retire from the
> world. He leaves home so that he may have the freedom and the
> opportunity to serve those who are attached to their homes, but whose
> life is full of sorrow, misery, and unhappiness, and who cannot help
> themselves.  
>  21. Compassion, which is the essence of the Dhamma, requires that
> everyone shall love and serve, and the Bhikkhu is not exempt from
> it.  
>  22. A Bhikkhu who is indifferent to the woes of mankind, however
> perfect in self-culture, is not at all a Bhikkhu. He may be something
> else but he is not a Bhikkhu.
