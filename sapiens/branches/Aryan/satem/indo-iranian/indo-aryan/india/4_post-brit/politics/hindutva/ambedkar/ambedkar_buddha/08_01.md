>   
> § 1. His Personal Appearance
>
>  1. From all accounts the Blessed Lord was a handsome person.  
>  2. His form was like the peak of a golden mountain. He was tall
> and well built; with a pleasing appearance.  
>  3. His long arms and lion gait, his bull-like eyes, and his beauty
> bright like gold, his broad chest, attracted everyone to him.  
>  4. His brows, his forehead, his mouth or his eyes, his body, his
> hands, his feet, or his gait--whatever part of him anyone beheld, that
> at once riveted his eyes.  
>  5. Whoever saw him could not help being struck with his majesty
> and his strength, his splendid beauty, surpassing all other men.  
>  6. On seeing him, he who was going elsewhere stood still, and
> whoever was standing followed him; he who was walking gently and
> gravely ran quickly, and he who was sitting at once sprang up.  
>  7. Of those who met him, some reverenced him with their hands;
> others in worship saluted him with their heads; some addressed him
> with affectionate words; not one went on without paying him homage.  
>  8. He was loved and respected by all.  
>  9. Men as well as women were ever ready to hear him.  
>  10. His voice was singularly sweet and deep as a drum, lovely,
> vibrant and eloquent. It made his speech as though it was heavenly
> music.  
>  11. His very tones convinced the hearer, and his looks inspired
> awe.  
>  12. His personality alone sufficed to make him not only a leader,
> but a god, to the hearts of his fellows.  
>  13. When he spoke he obtained hearers.  
>  14. It mattered little what he said. He influenced the emotions,
> and bent whoever listened to his will.  
>  15. He could create in the minds of his hearers \[the sense\] that
> what he taught was not only a verity, but the very hope of their
> salvation.  
>  16. His hearers could recognise in his words the truth that makes
> of slaves, free men.  
>  17. When he talked with men and women, his serene look inspired
> them with awe and reverence, and his lovely voice struck them with
> rapture and amazement.  
>  18. Who could have converted the robber Augulimala, or the
> Cannibal of Atavi? Who could have reconciled King Pasenjit to his
> queen Mallika by a single word? To have come under his spell is
> \[=was\] to be his forever. So charming was his personality.
>
>   
> § 2. The Testimony of Eye-witnesses
>
>  1. This traditional view is supported by the testimony of
> eye-witnesses who saw him and met him while he was alive.  
>  2. One such eye-witness is a Brahmin, by name Sale. After seeing
> the Blessed One face to face, he uttered the following sentiments in
> praise of him.  
>  3. Arrived in the Lord's presence, the Brahmin, seating himself
> after greetings, scanned the Lord's body for the two and thirty marks
> of a Superman, and in time observed them.  
>  4. Quite sure now about the presence of the two and thirty marks,
> Sale still did not know whether or not he had enlightenment. But he
> remembered hearing from old and aged Brahmins, teachers of teachers,
> that those who became Arahats, all enlightened, reveal themselves when
> their praises are sung, and so he made up his mind to extol the Lord
> to his face in the following lines of eulogy:  
>  5. "Perfect of body, goodly, Lord, art thou, well grown, well
> liking, golden-hued, with teeth which gleam \[with\] lustre; vigour
> fills the frame; the body's full perfection manifests each single sign
> that marks a Superman.  
>  6. "Clear-eyed and handsome, tall, upright art thou, effulgent as
> a sun among thy train, so debonair, so golden-hued--why waste thy
> beauty's prime as homeless anchorite?  
>  7. "As world-wide monarch thou shouldst ride in State; and indeed
> from sea to sea\[all\] should own thy sway. Proud princes shall thy
> village headmen be; rule thou mankind, as sovereign, king of kings!"  
>  8. Ananda describes the colour of his body as exceedingly clear
> and bright--so much so that the pair of \[garments of\] cloth of gold,
> when placed on the body of the Blessed One, appears to have lost its
> splendour.  
>  9. No wonder he was called by his opponents a glamour boy.
>
>   
> § 3. His Capacity to Lead
>
>  1. The Sangh had no official head. The Blessed One had no
> authority over the Sangh. The Sangh was a self-governing body.  
>  2. What was, however, the position of the Blessed One over the
> Sangh and its members?  
>  3. In this we have the evidence of Sakuldai and Udai,
> contemporaries of the Blessed One.  
>  4. Once the Lord was staying at Rajagraha in the bamboo grove.  
>  5. One morning the Lord went into Rajagraha for alms; but, deeming
> the hour too early, he thought of going to Sakuldai in Wanderers'
> Pleasance; and thither he repaired.  
>  6. At the time, Sakuldai was sitting with a great company of
> Wanderers, who were making a great noise about being and not being.  
>  7. When from some way off, Sakuldai saw the Lord coming, he hushed
> his company by saying: "Be quiet, sirs; do not make a noise; here
> comes the recluse Gautama, who is a lover of silence."  
>  8. So they became silent and the Lord came up. Said Sakuldai, "I
> pray the Lord to join us; he is truly welcome; it is a long time since
> he last managed to come. Pray, be seated; here is a seat for the
> Lord."  
>  9. The Lord sat down accordingly, asking Sakuldai what had been
> their theme and what was the discussion which had been interrupted.  
>  10. "Let that pass for the moment," answered Sakuldai; "you can
> easily gather that later on."  
>  11. Of late, when recluses and Brahmins of other creeds met
> together in the Discussion Hall, the topic was mooted, what a good
> thing, what a very good thing, for the Magdha people in Anga, that
> such recluses and Brahmins--all at the head of confraternities or
> followings, all well known and famous teachers, all founders of saving
> creeds, held in high repute by many people--should have come to spend
> the rainy season at Rajagraha.  
>  12. There was Purana Kassappa, Makhali Ghosala, Ajit Kesakambal,
> Pakudha Kacchayana, Sanjaya Belaiputta, and Nata-putta the Nigantha,
> all men of distinction and all of them here for the rains; and among
> them there is also the recluse Gautama here, at the head of his
> confraternity and following, a well-known and famous teacher, a
> founder of a saving creed, who is held in high repute by many.  
>  13. Now, which of these lords, which of these recluses and
> Brahmins of such eminence as teachers, is esteemed, respected,
> venerated and adored by his disciples? And on what terms of esteem and
> respect do they live with him?  
>  14. Said some: "Purana Kassappa gets no esteem or respect; no
> veneration or adoration, from his disciples; they live with him on no
> terms of esteem and respect."  
>  15. Time was when, as he was preaching his doctrine to some
> hundreds of his following, a disciple broke in with--"Don't question
> Purana Kassappa, who does not know about it; ask me who do; I will
> explain everything to your reverences."  
>  16. With arms outstretched, Purana Kassappa tearfully
> remonstrated, saying: "Do be quiet, sirs, do not make a noise."  
>  \[\[SURELY THIS CAN'T REALLY BE THE END?\]\]
