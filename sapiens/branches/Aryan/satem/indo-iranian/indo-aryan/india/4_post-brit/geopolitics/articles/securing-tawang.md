Tawang, the name, is on everyone's mouth after a skirmish in the Yangtze. It is worth recalling how a brave officer of the Second Assam Rifles played a key role in taking over Tawang in 1951. Let's remember Major Ralengnao Bob Khathing, MC, MBE.

In Jan 1951, then-the governor of Assam, Jairamdas Daulatram summoned Major Khathing and entrusted him with a top-secret mission: 'To go and integrate Tawang into India'. Major Khathing afterwards transferred on deputation as an assistant political officer, to the Indian Frontier Administrative Service. (to maintain the secrecy of the mission).

Major Khathing put together a team of two companies. After several days of travel, Major Khathing and his team moved to Tawang via the Jang and Sela mountain pass. The forces reached Tawang on the 7th of February, 1951. Major Khathing summoned Tibetan officials for the meeting. They were then given notice that any representatives of the Tibetan government will no longer have jurisdiction over people living south of the Bumla range. In the following days after that, all the officials of the 11 Tibetan Administrative Units were directed not to take any further orders from Tibetan officials. (Tibet was under China's control by then)

Tibetan officials asked for time to get permission from Lhasa. However, Major Khathing realized the crucial importance of time and rejected the request citing the Simla Treaty of 1914, according to which the area belonged to the GOI. From that day after, 11th of Feb 1951, Tawang became a part of India. Some historians believe that the incident was the initiative of the Assam Governor and PM Nehru was in a blackout for the whole time. Others are of opinion that PM was aware of the incident.

It was the stewardship of Major Khathing, which made it possible to integrate strategically important Tawang into India without any hast military action. Major Khathing is one of the many Bravehearts of India who made it possible for common citizens to sleep at night guarding frontiers day and night. Salute to all.
