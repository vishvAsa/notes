Savarkar’s dramatic release was a pleasant surprise to
Hindudom. Leaders like Sri Kelkar, Bhai Parmananda,
Dr. Moonje and Sri Aney were happy over the exhilarating
event that brought to them the release of a national force. The
reaction of the Congress High Command to his release was
notable. Pandit Nehru welcomed Savaikar back to freedom.
Rajaji felt great joy at the release of a national hero, who was
to him a symbol of courage, bravery and patriotism. Desha-
gaurav Subhas Bose welcomed him, and urged him to join
the Congress and strengthen the national movement. He
added that bright future awaited Savarkar. Sri M. N. Roy
welcomed the hero and hoped that Savarkar would devote
his life again to the emancipation of India on his own line of
thinking.^ Gandhiji had nothing to say about it. He was
proverbially silent.

The appearance of Savarkar on the political horizon natu-
rally aroused the envy of the petty patriots to w'hom
Gandhism was a faith and profession. Naturally the non-
violent non-embarrassing politics .suffered a volcanic wave.
The shrewd leaders in the Congress camp, who knew Savar-
kar s mettle, were sure that their steel was not strong enough
to break his spirit. They, therefore, sophistically hoped that
Savarkar would join the Congress or rest on his laurels.
Some nervously whispered that the steam-roller was out.
They knew well that he wore both a cross and a crown. The
crown had been smelted, shaped, tried and glorified in the
process of untold sufferings and incomparable sacrifice. But
what all of them feared most was his conquering personality,
matchless oratory, and, above all, his militant political
ideology.

WHIRLWIND PROPAGANDA 199

Maker of history, father of a political ideology, leader of a
world-famous revolutionary party, Savarkar was not a man
to follow success by changing his principles and betraying
the souls of his re^^o]utionary comrades. Lonely he set out
on his mission. He bade farewell to Ratnagiri to see how the
land lay, where the fuel existed, where the spark of righteous
resistance smouldered in Maharashtra. He reverentially
bowed to the Gadi of Shivaji at Kolhapur, and proclaimed liis
entrance into the political arena. At Pandharpur, the
southern Ber.ares, he pal., jis respects to the g^reat saints of
Maharashtra. It was at ra j that he first fluttered hi.s claw
and attacked the imbecile aiiitude of the Congressmen in the
Central Assembly where they had sometime before shame-
lessly argued that the kidnapping of Hindu girls in the North-
West Frontier Province was but a problem of physical wants !
This stroke was a direct challenge, a portent, a straight hit,
and a penetrating arrow aimed at the power and prestige of
the Congress. Congressmen surreptitiou.sly twisted the state-
ment, tried to make an issue out of it, invented a pretext, and
boycotted the reception functions held in Savarkar ’s honour !

Savarkeir reached Poona, the political, historical, and cul-
tural capital of Maharashtra. The whole city was stirred.
There was a new hope, a new life. With Sav’^arkar came up
the liisioric flag. The resurrected flag was hoisted for the
first time in recent years ! The spell of the name Savarkar
was cis mighty as it was mesmeric. Political workers, who
were humbled down and routed by the Congress, began to
look up straight. In Bombay Savarkar was given a waian
reception at a meeting which was addressed by Mr. K. F.
Nariman, Sri M. N. Roy and Sri S. K. Patil, all paying glowing
tributes to Savarkar’s .sufferings and sacrifice. M. N. Roy
touchingly referred to Savarkar as the tree of which he was
a branch among others, and with glowing eyes added that the
inspiration he had drawn from Savarkar during his student
days could stand him in good stead, and enabled him to face
forces of injustice, exploitation and slavery in all parts of the
world !

Savarkar took his permanent abode in Bombay. But time
and again he visited Poona and other parts of Maharashtra
during the latter part of 1937. Those who knew his political



200 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

ideology were not surprised to hear that Savarkar joined the
Tilakite Democratic Swaraj Party and shortly aftc^rwards the
Hindu Mahasabha. He did not join the Congress that had
departed from its democratic and national stand, and begun
to surrender to the anti-national demands of the Muslims.
Organizing a separate political party, however, was an uphill
task. Gandhiji was fortunate in having at liis disposal the
Congress, which was already shaped into an active political
organisation by Tilak, Lajpat Rai, and Das. Here Savarkar
began almost with a clean slate.

But why this new path ? Savarkar declared that the right
of revolt belonged to anybody provided he was prepared to
face the consequential ordeal. When Jesus Christ died, he had
a few followers ; Mohammed had to flee sometimes for want
of support ; and Columbus discovered America despite oppo-
sition and ridicule offered by his crew and comrades. There
was no harm, Savarkar said, if the country had many parties.
Savarkar further said that the Moderates also were great
patriots ; but Tilak opposed them and brought about unrest
that led to a political awakening. The revolutionaries left
Tilak behind, Savarkar continued, and showed the world to
what degree the barometer of active resistance and national
wrath could be rfiised by struggling India ! The object of
our worship is the Goddess of Freedom. The temple is one.
Let the ways and means differ. The worshippers should not
quarrel among themselves over the correctness of the means.”
Differences always exist and their clashes make for light !
He then reminded the people that Tilak became Lokamanya
after his death. Tilak did not agree entirely wnth him ; but
Tilak did not commit the sin of coming in his way, Savarkar
declared. He pointed out that Tilak, Gokhale, and Surendra-
nath Banerjee never considered politicians of independent
tliinking their enemies, because those politicians did not
subscribe to their own political views. He expressed also the
fear that the Congress would one day throttle the Bande
Mataram, and the national song would meet the fate the
poetry of Bhushan sulfered, in the University curriculum.
And within a few years the Congress did throttle Bande
Mataram on the altar of their pseudo-nationalism for appeasing

the Muslim mind. “ Efforts of all and various forces/’ Savar-
kar assertei’, “have led to the dawn of freedom. It is a
victory achieved by the cumulative efforts and combination
of all forces. Still Delhi is far off.”

As regards his political mission, he declared that his aim
was to establish a free independent Indian State on the bed-
rock of the Hindus, tlie nalional majority. He added that he
wanted to make the paper majority of the Hindus actively
conscious of the fact that they were the bedrock and main-
spring of the national life and the State. In I'rief but in un-
mistakable terms, he defined his mission to be :

(1) Absolute political independence of Hindusthan as the
goal.

(2) Its achievement by any means.

(3) Regeneration of the Hindus.

Savarkar then explained why he laid stress on the consoli-
dation of the Hindus, though he asked them to remove the
rigidity of the cast-iron rituals, and to break all the barriers
of caste system. The concept of Hindutva, he said, was
broader than Hinduism which related to the religious system
of the Hindus, their theology and dogma. But Hindutva was
far more comprehensive and referred not only to the religious
aspect of the Hindu people as the word Hinduism did, but
comprehended their cultural, social, political, and linguistic
aspects as well. He declared: “ Let Hinduism concern itself
with the salvation of life after death, the concept of God, and
the Universe. Let individuals be free to form opinions about
the trio. The whole Universe from one end to the other is the
real book of religion. But so far as the materialistic and
secular aspect is concerned, the Hindus are a nation bound
by a common culture, a common history, a common language,
a common country, and a common religion.”

The first appeal Savarkar made to the youth was to start
rifle classes, to learn to handle at least the air-guns. “ There
is a scope for drama, poetry and literature in life : but when
the mother is on her death-bed, it is a sin to go out for a
change of climate, or to enjoy life and stars,” he said. In the
last week of October 1937, Savarkar hoisted at Poona the tri-
colour flag of the Revolutionary India, which was designed
by the Abhinava Bharat and first unfurled by Madame Cama



202 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

in Germany. This was the first flag that was flown as the
national flag of India since 1857, and fortunately it was
brought to India after years through the efforts of Sri
Gajananrao Kelkar. In the following montli Savarkar presided
at the C.P. and Berar Hindu Conference in Akola. There he
defined tlie principles of his nationalism. Since independence
had come in sight, he thought,, it was the proper time to define
it. He told the conference that every country was known
after and ruled in the name of its national majority. “ The
Hindus, the national majority of Hindusthan,” he declared,
“had sacrificed almost exclusively for the liberation of
Hindusthan. In that very Bengal which is now virtually
ruled by the Muslims the sacrificial fire was kept burning by
Hindus alone. The buried bones in the Andamans can also
proudly proclaim that the heroes of independence were the
Hindus. Whatever has been achieved is done through the
sweat, struggle and sacrifice of the Hindus. Those laws and
rules under which the weal, welfare, culture and honour of
the Hindus would flouri.sh would alone constitute Swaraj
for the Hindus ! ” He reiterated his unflinching resolve that
if. was better to die in the thick of the fight for such a righteous
cause than to live with passive interest and see its failure.

Savarkar s visit to Nagpur had its peculiar charm and
enthusiasm. A vast crowd received him at the Nagpur station.
Amidst an atmosphere full of a new hope and charm,
Dr. Moonje, flie champion of the Hindu cause, in a moving
tone said that whatever service and power he had at his
disposal, he laid from that moment at the disposal of Savarkar.
On December 13, 1937, at Nagpur Savarkar warned the Hindus
to be prepared to flout the Pakistan scheme. In the same
speech, referring to the then political trend and happenings
in Kaslunir, he foretold that the existence of Kashmir Hindus
would soon be in utter danger, if the anti-Hindu forces were
not checked at that very stage. How prophetic he was can
be judged from the current history of Kashmir !

He, therefore, openly denounced Gandhiji’s ill-advice to the
Maharaja of Kashmir to abdicate in favour of the Muslims
and to go to Benai-es to do penance, because the Muslims were
in a majority in Kashmir. He attacked the unfair attitude of
Gandhi ji who would not advise in the same way the Nizam



WHIRLWIND PROPAGANDA 203

of Hyderabad and Nawab of Bhopal to iibdicale in favour of
the majorities in those Stales, who happened to be Hindus,
and ask the Muslim rulers to go to Mecca to do Toba \ The
rapid advance of Savarkar’s fiery and clear-cut ideal of
unalloyed nationalism began to create a nucleus of followers,
leaders, and supporters all over India. It was in the fitness of
things that such an inspired personality was elected
unanimously to the presidents})ip of the Hindu Mahasabha, in
spite of the opposition of some Congressmen for its nineteenth
Annual Session which was held at Abinedabad on the 30th
of December 1937. This the highest honour that the
Hindus could confer upon him. Savarkar made the greatest
sacrifice of his life in joining the Hindu Mahasabha and staked
his name and his all for the cause of the Hindus. Pelf, power,
and popularity were on the opposite side in the Congress.
There was no position to which he could not have risen once
he had joined the Congress. But he preferred duty to
popularity, weal of the nation to personal wealth, and personal
cross to popular crown. Prataps never pander to popularity
or bend their necks to dishonourable eminence. It is given
to Mansinghs to thrive on it. The Hindu Mahasabha now
began to rise as a political organization. Savarkar infused life
into it and gave it a Platform, a Slogan, a Bible, and a Banner !

And such a warrior philosopher appeared on the political
field and platform of Indian politics, when the dawn of rosy
revolution had faded away, the morning of the unalloyed
nationalism of Dadabhai Naoroji and Tilak had disappeared,
and the evenings were filled with weird shadows of pseudo-
nationalism ! To defend the legitimate, civic, religious,
cultural and economic rights of the Hindus in their Homeland
was taboo in 1937 ! Builders of our nation like Shiv^aji,
Pratap, and Guru Govindsingh were stigmatized as treache-
rous or misguided ! Prophets like Daj^ananda, noble
patriots like Lala Lajpat Rai and Swami Shraddhananda were
decried as narrow-minded bigots. The Muslims were offered
by Hindu leaders blank cheques of suzerainty over the Hindus
on the one hand, and the Hindus were themselves offered
blank betrayals by their leaders on the other. The inhuman
atrocities of the Moplahs were painted with the colour of
patriotism and brotherhood. The slogan, no Swaraj without



204 SAVARKAK AND HIS TIMES

Hindu-Muslim Unity, was the breath of life of the pseudo-
nationalists, and this slogan was constantly and rightly held
by the foreign Government as a loaded gun against the
national demand for freedom.

The policy of non-co-operation and non-violence was the cry
of the day. Jail-seeking was regarded as the royal road to
independence, although, in fact, it was a royal road to
personal prestige and power. A soldier was accursed as a
sinner, and a spinner in the Congress camp was nursed as a
saviour ! The principle of one vote for three Hindus and
three votes for one Muslim in the form of the Communal
Awaj’d was accepted as justifiable, democratic and fully
national. Recognition to Muslim population had become a
righteous duty, but mere recording of the correct Hindu
population in the census was a communal act. The cause of the
Muslim religion had beconie a national call, and the Hindu
religion became a symbol of reactionarism. Hindu leaders
like Shrimati Sarojini Naidu appealing to the Muslims of the
world to unite were eulogized, and the Muslim leaders, who
publicly declared their intention to divide the Depressed
Classes between the Hindus and Muslims, were elevated to ihe
pedestal of Godheads. But Hindu leaders, who stood by
Hindu self-respect, were branded as communalists. In fact,
it was the Dark Age in Indian politics of the modern times, as
Dr. Ambedkar once put it.

At this dark period, the inspired personality of Savarkar
appeared on the Indian political horizon incomparable in
sacrifice, uncompromising in principles. The warrior, who had
lived in his veritable grave, grappling with death for a quarter
of a century, again came to the front. For the welfare of his
people, for carving out the independence of his nation, he had
eaten the coarsest food, worn the roughest clothes, slept on the
bare earth in the darkest room, and was harnessed to the
oil-mill.

The voice of such a dynamic, mesmeric personality was
bound to exercise an irresistible influence over the people.
Savarkar felt it was his righteous duty to remove ruthlessly
the web of Gandhism that had choked the political life of
Hindusthan. Great political leaders are born with fabulous
energy ! So was stubborn Tilak. So was tenacious Gandhiji.



WHIRLWIND PROPAGANDA 205

So was indefatigable Nehru. So was dynamic Savarkar.
These were the four leaders that shook the remotest corner
of Hindusthan with the vibrations of their views and vigour !
Savarkar marched from Province to Province, propagating
his great ideal, explaining the territorial nationalism of the
Congress, and expounding his own stand based on political
rationalism and historical realism. He went on conquering
new planes and new patriots, pushing aside time-old
personalities and theories like cobwebs.


il

Throughout the length and breadth of Hindusthan,
Savarkar was hailed as the saviour of Hindusthan, pai’tly
with mixed feelings of love and reverence and partly with
awe and jealousy. A sea of humanity welcomed him in
February 1938, at Delhi, the historic capital of India. In that
memorable procession of thousands of people, Dr. Jayakar
and Loknayak Aney took keen interest with pride. Flowers
were showered, sweets were distributed, all public squares
of Delhi were decorated and flags were unfuided in honoui-
of the great hero, who made for the first time a triumphant
entry into the heart of the nation. The new ideology stirred
the United Provinces. This province w'as the chief scene of
the romantic history of 1857, and naturally Savarkar's
speeches were filled with the glorious reminiscences of that
heroic struggle for Independence. The Cawnpore Municipality
presented Savarkar with an address. Cities like Faizabad,
Barabanki, Lucknow and Agra gave him public receptions.
At Cawnpore he delivered, on April 3, 1938, an inspiring
speech on ‘ 1857 ’. He said : “ This very Cawnpore has
witnessed the defeat of the British forces at the hands of
Tatya Tope. Since my childhood I have been cherishing an
irresistible yearning for visiting this city as the venue of the
scenes of revolution and visiting Kashi as the holy city of
Hindusthan. Since my arrival hei-e I have been haunted by
the spirits of Nanasahib, Tatya Tope, the war cries raised by
their battalions and the thunder of their cannons." He saw the
famous massacre Ghat at Cawnpore and the temple of Shiv
whence Tatya Tope blew his bugle, and gave a clarion call to



206 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

his ai-my. The historian of ‘ 1857 ’ astounded the people by
exactly pointing out certain places imprinted with historical
events of 1857, though il was his first visit to the city.

At Faizabad he paid a visit lo the Sanskrit Pathashala and
Gurukul. While replying to the address given by the institu-
tion, Savarkar paid glowir.g tributes to the authorities and
teachers of the Pathashala for having given equal opportunities
to all Hindus irrespective of castes. Receiving an address on
behalf of the public al Barabanki. Savarkar reached Lucknow
on April 5. There he was taken in a grand procession, which
pas.sed through ihe '.lieeis decorated with arches. At a
jnanunuth public meotiug Saw'.rkar declared how the Congress
liad departed from its u ue nationaUstn and was sui rendering
to the anti-national demands of the Muslims. It was here thai
Acharya Narendradeu saw Savarkar and exchanged views
with him. Then addressing a meeting at Hasan Gaiij and
Shahad Ganj, he reached Agra where he was accorded a
rousing reception, and was presented with public addresses.
In the Agra f ort Savarkar showed how and where Shivaji
confronted the trembling Aurnngzcb.

In the middle of April Savarkar visited Sholapur and
during the first week of May 1958, attended the Hindu Youth
Conference at Poona, when processions demanding the lifting
of the ban on aaiiis were taken out.

Then the land of the Vedas and the Five Rivers gave a
.splendid reception to Savarkar, the warrior philosopher of the
Land of Kannayoya. In the second week of May 1938, Lahore
gave him a public reception. Amidst deafening applause he
garlanded the stiilue of Lala Lajpat Rai, the lion of the Punjab.
He also paid a visit to the liisloric Shahid Ganj of the Sikhs.
At Lahore, in a Press interview, Savarkar said that he and
Ml-. Jinnah were not birds of the same feather, because, while
he stood for equality and no concessions. Mi-. Jinnah did not
stand for equality and always asked for more and more
concessions. Savarkar told the press representatives that he
insisted that either there should be joint electorates without
any reservation of seats for any community in any legislature
or any local body, or there must be joint electorates with
reservation of seats for minorities either on population basis
or according to a system of weightages equally applicable to



WHIRLWIND P R O P A G A C D A 207

all minorities. He further said that the Congress should
assume the role of a Parliament in whi^ ii all parties should
participate, and not the role of a party ss it was developing
in those days.

While writing on the splended j ;ception accorded to
Savarkar by Lahore people, the Trihn>ui, a leading Nationalist
paper, appreciated the services that S ivarkar rendered to the
cause of the Motherland. Discussing the difference between
the viewpoints of Savarkar and Jinnah, the paper observed :

As a matter of fact Mr. Savarkar 's anchor as a sincere and
a rue nationalist holds as ever. The several speeches made
Ijy liim during the last three days, show unmistakably both
the general soundne.ss of hi.s political views and the fervour
and intensity of his love ol country and freedom. His
conception of a modern nation and an ideal state is that of a
nation and state in which no difference is made between one
person and artoiher on the score of community, religion or
caste. Holding this view, and this is undoubtedly the only-
correct view, it is only right that he should want the Congress
which is India’s supreme national organization, not to
recognize religion, class and community and to stand for the
equal rights of all citizens.” *

At Amritsar Savarkar was accorded an imposing reception
by the people. Several thousands of Sikhs received Savarkar
in the famous Golden Temple. When at a meeting the Sikhs
presented Savarkar with a Kripan, he asked them what earthly
use was served in presenting that Kripan to a Mahratta by
those people for whom the Kripan had lost its meaning and
spirit and whom the doctrine of non-violence was haunting !
Delivering a .speech at another public meeting, he said ; “ The
more you follow the Hindu-Muslim xmity, the further it runs
away from you. Plainly speaking, there does not exist any
minority problem worth the name. The Parsis, the Jews and
the Christians inhabiting this land never claimed special
rights and the latter have declared more than once that they
do not want separate electorates.” “

On his way back, he paid a visit to Ajmer. There addressing
a big meeting, Savarkar paid tributes to the services of

Gandhiji and other leaders of the Congress for creating a
spirit of awakening in the country, but asked the people to
oppose the Congress for its appeasing poUcy towards the
Muslims. Referring to this new awakening, the Sunday
Times, Lahore, paid a glowing tribute to Savarkar and said :
“ He is a man of sterling worth and possesses an indomitable
courage which made him boldly face the ordeals, through
which he passed/’ ’

After paying \dsil.s to Ajmer, Nasik, Gwalior and Jodhpur,
Savaikar turned to Sind. Long before, while in internment.
Savarkar had sounded a grave warning to the Sind Hindus
against the separation of Sind from the Bombay Province.
H(jwe\'er. the limb of the Bombay Province, like the lamb in
the Aesop’s Fable, was misled and was not only mutilated
from Bombay, but subsequently was cut off from the
Motherland.

The receptions accorded to Savarkar all over Sind from the
1st to the 10th of September 1938, w'ere imposing. In Karachi
the procession took five hours to wend its way to its destina-
tion. The enthusiasm of the Hindus w'as afire. Sukkar vied
with Karachi in offering its homage to the leader. The
Hyderabad Municipality held a reception of civic welcome to
the gi’eat son of India. Kothari and Sukkar Municipalities,
too, paid their homage to Savarkar. The Sind Hindu
Conference, which was then held at Sukkar under the lead
of Savarkar, sounded a timely warning to the Sind Hindus,
and asked them to boycott the Congress and organize a
stronghold of Hindus to save their hearths, homes and interests
in the near future. The Sind Hindus then under the evil
influence of the Congress forgot this warning, and ultimately
paid for their folly in 1947. Describing this tour of Savarkar,
the Sind Observer, an English Daily of Congress persuasion,
declared : “ He came, he saw, he conquered.”

In October 1938, the Hyderabad (Bhaganagar) struggle was
launched to vindicate the civic, religious, economic and
political rights of the Hindus in' the Hyderabad State, who
were groaning under the heels of the medieval tyranny of
the Nizam. The Hindus and Sikhs in the State were not
allowed to hold meetings, take out processions political or

^eligious, repair their temples, and to start even private
schools to educate the children in their mother tongue ; Hindu
temples, Hindu Bazaars and Hindu houses were burnt down ;
twelve per cent Muslim population held eighty per cent posts,
positions and jobs of va?itage in the administration. And
what was the attitude of the Congressmen to this movement
foi' civil liberties ? Their head, Gandhiji, eventually
declared that he did not want to embarrass His Exalted
Higlmess the Nizam of Hyderabad. Such was the policy of
the Congressmen and Gandhi}: that whenever the tyrants
were Muslims and the tyra iu,Gd were Hindus, their
nationalism, their love of justice, ^lieir love of civic rights and
political liberty would at once crawl. Therefore in deference
to the wish of their de facto leader, Gandhiji, the Congressmen
did not raise their little finger against this barbarous and
fanatical persecution. Their sympathy, their love of justice
and their tears they poured and shed with Tagore for
Abyssinia and the Arabs in Palestine.

Savarkar attended the historic Aryan Conference at
Sholapur in the last week of December 1938, at the pressing
request from the leaders of the Arya Samaj for his guidance
and lead in connection with the Hyderabad struggle, which
was gathering momentum, and as a result of which several
thousands of Hindu Civil Resisters were suffering imprison-
ment in the Nizam’s jails. In the same week came off the
Annual Session of the Hindu Mahasabha at Nagpur where
Buddhist representatives from Japan also were present. The
procession in honour of the President-elect took five hours
to reach its destination. Boundless enthusiasm prevailed.
Flowers were showered from an aeroplane upon President
Savarkar, the chosen leader. The Presidential Address of
Savarkar delivered at this Nagpur Session was a master-piece
of the principles of nationalism and humanism, rights and
duties of the minorities, of foreign policy and national and
international politics. During the Session the Hyderabad
Movement received the prime attention of all the
Sanghatanists.

Then followed Savarkar’s visit in the third week of
February 1939, to the land of Bande Mataram, the home of
Surendranath, C. R. Das, Bepin C. Pal, Arvind Ghose, and

Khudiram Bose. The Khulna Conference opened a new
outlet for the salvation of the Bengal Hindus. Such was the
tremendous effect of Savarkar’s matchless oratory and
dynamic personality on Bengal that, pointing to the thundering
receptions to Savarkar and to his merciless logic, the Amrit
Bazar Patrika, an organ of Congress persuasion, sounded a
timely warning to the Congress bosses to be on their guard
and to dissuade themselves from placating the unholy demand.^
of the Muslim League. Savarkar captivated the hearts of
the leaders, lawyers, and public w'orkers of Bengal.
Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjec was initiated into Indian
politics, and he became a new as.sct and nucleus of Hindu
Sanghatan ideology. Indeed, Mukherjee was a discovery of
Savarkar’s tour in Bengal. Almost all Bengal papers published
.special issues full of life-sketches of the romantic career of
the Prince of the revolutionaries of Hindusthan. One dailj'
described this tour as an all-talkie, all-movie tom* of the Indian
Robinhood.

After Bengal came the turn of Bihar, the land of the sturdy
fighters and tough warriors for the Hindu cause. A Provincial
Hindu Conference was held at Monghyr in the third week
of March 1939, imder the Presidentship of Savarkar. The
flag, the spirit and the ideology began to capture new fields
and new avenues. Monghyr gave an imposing reception to
Savarkar and the procession was the most splendid that the
city ever witnessed. The leading Hindi Daily, the Prahhakar,
of Monghyr, described it as an unparalleled reception ever
accorded to Great Men. Savarkar delivered his stirring
Presidential Address with great heartforce. He declared that
Hinduism and Hindutva were two different things. Hindutva
constituted, he said, all those aspects and aspirations which
the word nationalism comprised ! The Indian Nation, Patna,
commenting on the Presidential Address of Savarkar, wrote :

“ It was a stirring speech. He made an impassioned appeal
to Hindus to unite to resist inroads, and revive their past
glory. His speech was heard with rapt attention and
created an atmosphere of great enthusiasm among the Hindus.
He spoke with feeling, and the audience also was greatly
impressed with the arguments he gave in support of his
conclusions.” Then followed the Mahakoshal Provincial



WHIRLWIND PROPAGANDA 211

Hindu Conference at Jubbulpore in the first week of June
1939. The idea of the unjust treatment to the national
      majority of the Hindus and the danger of disintegration of
      Hindusthan began to attract the attention of the Hindus. The
      Jubbulpore Municipality held a civic welcome in honour of
      Savarkar at the time of the Conference.

In the meantime ‘ Hyderabad Days ’ were observed all over
India by Hindu Sanghatanists ; centres of civil resistance
movement were opened w' dictators in charge at Poona,
Nagpur, and Akola. The I’ ndu Mahasabha gave Savarkar
full powers in respect of ifn movement. Savarkar toured
Berar in the middle of April and in June 1939, and gave a
tremendous impetus to the Hyderabad struggle. Touching
scenes in villages and towns on the border lines of C.P. and
Berar and Bombay provinces and on the banks of the
Penganga at Umarkhed in Berar were witnessed on those
occasions. One of the most touching incidents at one of these
mammoth meetings took place when the tribal leaders of the
forest dwellers — ^Pardhis — devotionally honoured Savarkar
with a rough woollen blanket and a lathi in their tribal
fashion.

Savarkar’s thrilling voice was then heard, giving a send-off
to several batches of volunteers who entered the Hyderabad
State to offer civil resistance. Nearly 15,000 volunteers,
workers and leaders were suffering imprisonment for having
offered the civil resistance. Senapati Bapat, Sri L. B.
Bhopatkar, Sri S. R. alms Mamai'ao Date, Dr. Paranjpe, Sri D.
K. Sathe, Sri Anantrao Gadre and Sri Bapurao Joshi from
Maharashtra, and Sri Chandakiran Sarada, Mahashay
Krishna, Pandit Narayan Swami, and Baba Madansingh Gaga
from other provinces led battalions of civil resisters into the
Hyderabad State and Yeshwantrao Joshi, the leader of the
Hindu Sabha in Hyderabad, with his colleagues had already
been arrested and sentenced by the State bureaucracy. Pandit
Nathuram Godse, who was the Secretary of the Pratikar
Mandal established at Poona under the Presidentship of Sri G.
V. Ketkar, Editor Mdhratta, had led the first batch of civil
resisters from Maharashtra into Hyderabad, the administra-
tively most dangerous State in India.

During this Movement there was complete co-operation

Gandhiji. On April 5, 1939, Savarkivr successfully foiled in
a fighting speech the plans of Gandhiji at the Sholapur Aryan
Conference which was on the verge of withdrawing the civil
Resistance Movement in pursuance of Gandhiji’s draft
resolution ! Gandhiji was so sure of the withdrawal of the
Movement by the Arya Samaj that ho even saw Dr. Moonje
in Delhi, told him about the draft resolution, and asked
Moonje to wire to Savarkar to follow suit. Dr. Moonje told
Gandhiji that Gandhiji should not trouble himself about the
Movement started by the Hindu Mahasabha and added that
Savarkar knew best how and where to stop it.

As was their wont, the Congressmen were then busy
supporting the Muslim struggle against the Kashmir
State. Except the weak-need policy of their prototypes in
the Hyderabad State who stopped their struggle in the State
on instructions from the Congress High Command and
Gandhiji, they never seriously denounced the medieval
barbarism and misrule of Hyderabad State, which had
assaulted several Hindu civil resisters in its jails and put to
death about a dozen of them in the jails. Though the Congi-ess
journals and leaders kept themselves unconcerned with the
struggle against the Hyderabad State, the agitation reached
the British Parliament. In the British Parliament Col. Wedg-
wood raised the question of Hyderabad struggle carried on
by the Hindu Sanghatanists. and the same day Sri Bhide
Guruji hoisted the Geruva flag on the British Residency at
Hyderabad.

After a prolonged struggle H.E.H. the Nizam was brought
to his knees and in accordance with his traditional policy
bowed down to save his Gadi before he was completely .beaten.
On the 19th of July 1939, H.E.H. the Nizam declai-ed the
reforms wherein he gave recognition to the Civil Resistance
Movement, and offered to the Hindus at least 50 per cent of
the seats in the elected Legislatures wherein formerly the
Hindus had zero per cent representation. Savarkar who



WHIRLWIND PROPAGANDA 213

smelt the coming sweep of World War II withdrew the
movement after this partial success. The Arya Samaj followed
suit. This successful termination of the struggle for the civic,
political, economic and religious rights of the Hindus and
Sikhs, who were totally suppressed in the Hyderabad State,
was a new feather in Savarkar’s cap and added prestige and
power to his leadership. Through the struggle Savarkar felt
the pulse of Maharashtra. The undying spirit of Shivaji and
Tilak was not yet dead the and Savarkar experienced that
spirit again revolting agains^ ranny and injustice.

Now all was not well with t\\e Congress and its lead. Owing
to the gi*owing popularity of the Hindu Mahasabha under the
lead of Savarkar, the Congress High Command resolved to
boycott the Hindu Mahasabha. This was an amazing stand
taken by the Congress lead. But no Mahasabhaite worth
the name worried himself about this boycott.

In the last week of September 1939, Savai^kar visited a few
places in Karnatak. He spoke in the Municipal Hall and
in the Karnatak college at Dharwar, and addressed meetings
at Hubli and some other villages like Hosur, Gurla Hosur,
Bail Hongul and gave a fillip to the Hindu Sanghatan work.
Savarkar ’s next visit outside Maharashtra was to Meei’ut in
the first week of October 1939, to support the candidature of
Maharaja Krishna in the provincial bye-election. There the
opposition from the Muslims and Congressmen to the Hindu
Mahasabha was smouldering. The Muslims even attacked
Savarkar’s procession at Meerut and there ensued a deadlock
in the street between the two sides. The U.P. police force
of Sri Govind Vallabh Pant as expected failed to protect the
just and legitimate rights of the peace-loving Hindu
processionists, and indirectly encouraged the aggressive
nature of the Muslims by forcing the Hindus themselves to
abandon the procession.

After Savarkar’s arrival in Bombay a statement was issued
to the press by seven leaders namely Sir Cowasji Jehangir,
Sir Chimanlal Setalvad, Sir V. N. Chandavarkar on behalf
of the Indian Liberals, Savarkar on behalf of Hindu
Mahasabha, Sri N. C. Kelkar and Sri Jamnadas Mehta on



214 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

behalf of the Democratic Swaraj Party, and Dr. Ambedkar
on behalf of the Independent Labour Party. These seven
leaders declared : “ The Congress and the Congress Govern-
ments believe in annihilating all parties and making the
Congress the only party in the land, as is the case in Fascist
and Nazi regimes — a result which would be a deathblow to
Democracy.” ^ This timely warning against the developing
Fascism had its effect. The Congress papers attacked
Savarkar particularly, saying that Savarkar could do nothing
but join the Liberals. Sounding a warning with the patriotic
men against the Congress Fascism was something unpatriotic,
but surrendering the national interests at Jinnah’s feet was to
the monopolised press a patriotic and national act !


Then came a great event in Savarkar's romantic life. The
British Power that had exiled him for 27 years thought it
fit to interview Savarkar at New Delhi on October 9, 1939,
to know his views and policy about World War II. In the
course of the interview Savarkar frankly told His Excellency,
the Governor-General Lord Linlithgow, that he still was a
revolutionary ; but as the political situation and strategy
demanded it, he was prepared to co-operate in the policy of
Militarisation and suggested to Government to keep the Sikh
and Gurkha battalions on the North-West Frontiers. He
feared, however, that an attack on India would probably be
made from the Eastern side. The Viceroy was so much
impressed with Savarkar’s lucid discourse on the current
problems that he expressed to some of liis Executive
Councillors that Savarkar was possibly the only politician who
could ably discuss the war situation from the Indian
viewpoint and its major issues in the context of international
politics. The Viceroy was also surprised to see that in spite
of an unusual record of long incarceration and great sufferings
Savarkar was still alert, and clear in thinking and unflagging
in energy ! In the evening Sir Jagdish Prasad and
Sir Ramswami Mudaliar, Members of the Executive Council
of the Viceroy, invited Savarkar to a tea-party.

WHIRLWIND PROPAGANDA 215

After Savarkar’s interview with the Viceroy, the Hindu
Mahasabna Working Committee passed its famous resolution
declaring that neither the allies nor the axis powers entered
war with any altruistic motives ; but they were out for their
national or imperialistic ambitions.

The Calcutta Session of the Hindu Mahasabha held during
the last week of December 1939, proved to be a landmark in
the history of the Hindu Mahasabha and in the life of
Savarkar. So great was the enthusiasm that the President-
elect had to pass two sleepless nights to attend receptions
accorded to him by thou. ands of people at every important
station en route to Calcutta. The Howrah station was packed
to capacity with anxious crowds of workers and eager public.
Cheer upon cheer greeted his arrival. Heaps of geirlands
were showered upon Savarkar, groups of bands played before
the station, and numerous photographs were taken. Eager
sightseers lined the roadways waiting to cheer the warrior
philosopher. Then followed the largest procession Bengal
ever witnessed. Armed Sikh horsemen led the procession.
Rose water and scents were sprinkled upon the President-
elect by crowds of men and women standing in the balconies,
and on the roofs to witness the mammoth procession and have
a look at the great leader of Hindusthan. This was the biggest
session of the Mahasabha held till then. More than two
lakhs of people participated. In his Presidential Address
Savarkar reiterated the basic tenets of nationalism, reviewed
the problem of minorities, and propounded his doctrine of
national co-ordination of class interests.

Savarkar’s dynamic personality and his clear-cut thinking
and his characteristic fearlessness made an irresistible
impression on the minds of thinking men in the country. Their
repercussions were echoed through different leading news-
papers of India. The HindvMhan Standard, Calcutta,
remarked : “ The president himself is a dynamic personality
who radiates hope where there is defeatism, brings cheer
where there is distress and calls into play creative energy
where there is desolation. The Hindu Mahasabha must be
beholden to Providence that it has succeeded after years of
wandering in the wilderness in claiming for three years in
unbroken succession as its leader and spokesman that high



216 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

priest of militant Indian Nationalism who has dreamt dreams
and seen visions. . . . ” ^

BengaFs another great journal, the Ainrit Bazar Patrika,
observed : “ Whether one agrees with nil his views or not,
Mr. Savarkar compels attention by the boldness and clarity
of his utterances. He knows no doubt or hesitation. His
logic is merciless ; his humour caustic, and his irony efTective.
He is a man with a mission. The faith that burns in him
throws a halo all round and he seems as he delivers liis
message and advances like a conquering liero, sweeping iiway
from his path like cobwebs all time-worn theories arjd
personalities.” Sounding a warning to the Congress, the
Amrit Bazar Patrika further said : “ One consideration is that
Congi’ess has lost its hold over Bengal. We shall not go into
the story today, but it is an admitted fact that it is the
non-communal outlook of the Congress which has failed to
satisfy the Hindus of this Province ” And the paper added :

In Indian polities we have at least a man who is not afraid
to call a spade a spade.”

Styling Savarkar’s Presidential Address as militant, the
Tribune, Lahore, stated : The militancy is not only intel-
ligible, but in part defensible as a natural reaction produced
in the sensitive Hindu minds by the aggressive Communalism
of the Muslim League.”** The New India, (‘ominenting on the
Address, observed : ‘‘ Thrice Mr. Nehru was elected as

Congress President and thrice has Mr. Savarkar been chosen
as the Mahasabha leader. Both have certain qualities in com-
mon. Both made great sacrifices for the country and both
possess a trenchancy of style which is direct and provocative.
Had he been admiitted into the inner cricle of the Congress
fold, I am sure, Mr. Savarkar would have become President
of that organisation. Whether right or wrong, the man is
utterly and downrightly sincere.” ^

Another significant feature attached to the Session was that
the Maharaja of Nepal was given a garden party and a Public
Address under the signature of President Savarkar on behalf
of the Hindu Mahasabha. Ill-health prevented Savarkar from

attending the function. The Maharaja himself honoured
Savarkar, when he went to the ‘'cdside of Savarkar and had
a private talk with him about S varkar’s mission for an hour.
During these days Sri N. R. ' u kar also saw Savarkar and
discussed the gcmeral policj^ o (lie Hindu Mahasabha and the
politics i). India.

During the Iasi week of auuary 1940, at Malabar Hill,
Bombay, Savarkar discusser \^' th the leaders of Parsi com-
munity the rights of mo Immediately thereafter

Savarkar made a tour of W st Khandosh in the middle of
March 1940. Such was the \itality and energy of Savarkar in
those days that he ran through a crowded programme of
meetings at several places from Chalisgaon to Daundaiche in
a single day. Paying flying visits and making speeches at
Takarkhed, Shahade arid Prakashe, he came to Talode where
the Jahagirdar received him. The public meeting was attended
by the leaders of the Bhills. It was during these tours that
a Bhill, who had completed his term of punishment in the
Andamans, fell at Savarkar’s feel. The devotion of the con-
victs in the Andamans to Savarkar was boundless. The author
has seen one Kusha Patil, a convict on his return from the
Andamans, paying homage to Savarkar as the ‘ God incarnate ’
of the land ! Kusha Patil said : “ It was through Savarkar \s
care and kind words that I became what I am today ! ” After
addressing very big public meetings at Nandurbar, Pimpalner
and Dhulia, Savarkar returned to Bombay.

In the last week of March 1940, Savarkar left for Salem to
attend the Salem Hindu Conference. Receiving addresses
of welcome en route at several stations, he reached Salem. In
the Municipal House he spoke on the importance of military
training. At the Conference he spoke on the need for Hindu
Sanghatan and military training and exhorted the Hindus to
oppose the Muslim League scheme of partition of Hindusthan.
He paid his respects to Sri Vijay Raghavahariar, an
ex-President of the Hindu Mahasabha, and also once a
president of the I. N. Congress, at his residence.

At Madras on the morning of the 25th March, he waj given
a great ovation. Dr. T. S. S. Raj an, an ex-minister of the
Madras Province and one-time lieutenant of Savarkar in his
London days met him. In the evening before an audience of



218 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

thousands of Hindus Savarkar spoke at the beach on the
need of Hindu Sanghatan ideology and the necessity of oppos-
ing the scheme of partition sponsored by the Muslim League.
In the city he was given addresses of welcome by several
associations of Arya Samajists, Marwaris, Sindhis, Gujaratis,
etc. On the 26th March 1940, the birthday anniversary of
Shivaji, Savarkar spoke on the politics of Shivaji at a mam-
moth meeting held on the beach of Madras under the
presidenlsliip of Dr. P. Varadarajalu Naidu.

After a fortnight Savarkar again left Bombay for his
Travancore tour. Unprecedented receptions were accorded
to him throughout the state. At Quilon he was honoured as
a State Guest. The Changanacheri Municipality accorded hin)
an address of welcome. The leaders of the Christian com-
munity interviewed Savarkar. Representatives of the so-
called untouchables saw him. At the Hindu Conference held on
May 5, 1940, at Changanacheri, Savai'kar spoke on the policy
of the Mahasabha towards the States and the importance of
shuddhi. At TinneveUy station he was accorded a rousing
reception. After a grand procession Savarkar was heard at
a public meeting with rapt attention. On receiving addresses
of welcome at the stations of Kolipatti, Satur and Virudhu-
nagar, he reached Madura, the Athens of South India. Great
honour done only to Great Acharyas was done to Savarkar
by the priests of the famous Meenakshi Temple. At Madura
elephants, horses, camels headed the procession, carrying the
Hindu National flag through decorated streets. Rose water
mixed with fragrant sandalwood was sprinkled on the proces-
sion. After running through a crowded programme, Savarkar
addressed a mammoth meeting in the city and returned to
Bombay.

On July 5, 1940, Savarkar had a second interview with the
Viceroy at Simla. In the evening Sri Jai Lai, a retired judge
of the Lahore High Court, arranged in his honour a tea-party
at his residence. Sir Jogendra Singh, an ex-minister of the
Punjab, Raja Sir Daljit Singh, Sardar Raghuveer Singh and
Sri Ji^tice Varma of the Patna High Court were present.
During the discussion Savarkar impressed upon them the
need for the Hindu Sanghatan Movement. When Savarkar
returned to the Simla Station, he received a telephone



WHIRLWIND PROPAGANDA 219

message from H,H. the Jamsahib of Nawanagar, the then
Chancellor of the Chamber of Princes in India, requesting him
for a meeting, but the same cov d not be arranged for want
of time. On his return journey '.ir Sikandar Hyat Khan, the
Premier of the Punjab, and ‘ v.srkar’s one-time colleague,
learning that Savarkar was he same train, visited his
compcirtment, and greeted hit id colleague and revolutionary
party leader in a most to- .-I ng manner. Sri Walchand
Hirachand, the business magnat of India, also met him in the
train, and had a long talk wil i him. In August he attended
the death anmversary of Tilak at Poona where he averred in
his famous speech that absolute non-violence is absolutely
sinful.

After such a strenuous lightning and whirlwind propaganda
from the northern to the southern ends of Hindusthan,
Savarkar’s health began to deteriorate. The whole burden of
the party, of propaganda, of co-operation, of correspondence,
and of organization rested on him. The wonder was that a
frail frame having gone through the ordeals of an unusually
long torturous incarceration and rigorous hard prison life
in the Andamans could stand such a mighty task ! He was
the only great leader, besides the two great Congress leaders
Gandhiji and Nehru, who could pour out political energy and
vibrate every corner of India, but the hardships of Savarkar
were to those of the latter pair what Himalayas are to the
Satpudas. Savarkar had to struggle against heavy odds,
against the greatest political organization under the sun, had
to create his party funds and leaders, and had to suffer inordi-
nately for want of press. The sciatic pain in his leg linger*ed
for a long time. In the last week of December 1940, the
Annual Session of the Hindu Mahasabha was held at Madura.
Savarkar was unanimously elected President by all Provin-
cial Hindu Sabhas despite his ill-health and his repeated
appeals to the contrary. He reached Madura in a special train
with more than 250 delegates from Maharashtra. He was
brought to the dais, reclining in a chair. In his address he
dealt with the war situation and the doctrine of non-violence.
Those were the days of Individual Civil Disobedience Move-
ment started by the Congress. Some Mahasabhaites felt an
itch for some sort of Direct Action against Government, and



220 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

to that end a resolution was passed during the Session against
Savarkar’s will. To Savarkar courting jail alone was no
patriotism. He wanted Hindu youths to give impetus to the
Militarisation Movement, and get themselves ‘ re-animated
and reborn ’ into a martial race.

On January 19, 1941, Savarkar presided over the Centenary
Ceremony of the Public Library of Nasik, and, after makirsg
a fitting speech in memory of poet Govind. his former col-
league, he unveiled his statue. The Trimbak Municipality
also gave him an address.

On the 13th and 14th of March 1941, Savarkai' attended and
guided the Non-Party Leaders’ Conference which under the
presidentship of Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru urged reconstruction
of the Viceroy’s Executive Council.

In the meanwhile, the Direct Action Resolution was dis-
cussed by the Working Committee of the Hindu Mahasabha
at Nagpur and its operation was finally postponed on June 15,
1941, by the All-India Committee of the Hindu Mahasabha
at Calcutta. This time Savarkar performed the ceremony of
laying the stab of Sri Ashutosh Mookeriec Memorial in the
Ashutosh Hall at Calcutta. The Kali Mandir priests presented
Savarkar with an address. In July 1941, Savarkar attended
the Sapru Conference in Poona and spoke on the Akhand
Hindusthan Resolution whereupon he not only dominated the
Conference, but also took it by .storm. He then left for Sangli
accompanied by Sri N. C. Kelkar, where he was given a great
ovation and addresses of welcome, and where he addressed
several meetings. Overcome with Savarkar’s inspiring mes-
sage, tremendous influence and powerful oratory which he
likened to the power of radium, Sri Kelkar wrote an editorial
in the Kesari under his signature wherein he sent forth a
forceful appeal asking the Mahasabhaites and the Tilakites
to stand by Savarkar irrevocably. On his return Savarkar
addressed a mammoth meeting before the Shaniwarwada at
Poona on the impending calamity, Pakistan.

In November 1941, Savarkar toured Assam, the far Eastern
province of India. At Shillong he was accorded a great
ovation. There he was told that Pandit Nehru’s attention was
drawn to the Muslim influx into Assam, when the Pandit
replied that nature hates vacuum. Savarkar told his audience



WHIRLWIND PROPAGANDA 221

that Pandit Nehru, being neither a philosopher nor a scientist,
did not know that nature abhors poisonous gas !

Then followed in the last week of December 1941, the
Bhagalpur Session of the Hindu Mahasabha, the most momen-
tous and eventful of the Mahasabha Sessions. Government
had put a ban on this Session under the pretext of maintaining
peace and communal harmony in the Province. Savarkar,
who had almost withdrawn from the contest for the presidency
of the Hindu Mahasabha, was provoked into accepting the
presidential office, and he gave a fight for the civic rights and
liberty of the people. A hundred thousand workers rushed to
the scene, f)*oin Rajas to Raises, from millowners to millhands,
from Sanataiiists to Sikhs, from Jains to the so-called un-
touchables, carried on the active struggle, and defended the
honour of the Hindu flag, the fundamental civil liberties of
freedom of speech and freedom of association of the people.
Huge demonstrations were made, sudden open meetings were
held in breach of the ban, invoking and facing lathi charges,
armed mounted soldiers, floggings, bayonets, and imprison-
ment. Organised fury was witnessed in cities, towns and
villages all over the six districts of Bihar which came undei*
the ban.

Many prominent statesmen like Sri Srinivas Sastri con-
demned this unjust ban, Gandhiji could do it only after
having a dig at Savarkar, for he thought that Savarkar had
resorted to his weapon of Satyagraha. But the other Congress
bosses had nothing to say about it. They were busy contem-
plating help to China or Spain torn and afflicted by civil wars.
Savarkar was arrested at Gaya en route to Bhagalpur and
put in jail. And yet to the despair of the forces and fire of
Government the Session was held in Bhagalpur, when Sri G.
V. Ketkar, with the revolting spirit of his grandfather, Lok-
manya Tilak, rose to the occasion and read out Savarkar ’s
Presidential Address ! All the thousands of civil resisters
including Savarkar were released after a week. This Session
is important in many respects. The Bhagalpur Civil Resis-
tance success proved to be an abiding source of strength and
self-confidence, and demonstrated that in spite of castes,
creeds, sects and sections, Hindudom did pulsate with a com-
mon national urge, proving that Pan-Hindu consciousness was



222 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

a vigorous reality. Another aspect of the struggle was that
it proved to the hilt that even the Hindus by themselves could
launch a nation-wide mass movement in defence of the rights
of the people.

Along with the militarisation, political and literary move-
ments, the social movement for the consolidation of the
Hindus went hand in hand as before. Throughout India
Savarkar attended meetings, and presided over conferences
held in connection with the removal of untouchabiUty. During
his lours he visited societies conducted by and for the uplift
of the so-called untouchables, visited their localities, took
water, refreshments and dinners at their quarters, inquired
into their local grievances and encouraged anti-caste dinners
which he had inaugurated since the days of Ratnagiri. At
Chanda, Chalisgaon, Nagai’, Poona, Lahore, Hyderabad
(Sind) , Sukkar and Delhi he attended anti-caste dinners. He
presided over the Dayanand Dalitoddhar Parishad at Ferozpur
(Punjab). At the time of the All-India Sessions of Hindu
Mahasabha, big anti-caste dinners were held in Nagpur and
later on also in Cawnpore. At Monghyr he dined with the
Santhals. At Cawnpore he told the Session during the course
of his Presidential Address that banishing untouchabiUty in
any shape or form was to win a major battle. Depressed
Class leaders from Dr. Ambedkar to Sir Jogendra N. Mandal
saw him, and discussed the problem with him.

Another programme Savarkar attended whenever and
wherever possible was his encouraging visits to the centres,
gatherings and parades of the Rashtriya Swayam Sevak
Sangh. He encouraged the Sanghites, patronised them, at
times advised them not to while away their whole life under
incrustation, and asked them to fight for the realization of
their ideal.
