*22nd June, 1895*

DEAR KIDI,

I will write you a whole letter instead of a line. I am glad you are
progressing. You are mistaken in thinking that I am not going to return
to India; I am coming soon. I am not giving to failures, and here I have
planted a seed, and it is going to become a tree, and it must. Only I am
afraid it will hurt its growth if I give it up too soon. . . .

Work on, my boy. Rome was not built in a day. I am guided by the Lord,
so everything will come all right in the end.

With my love ever and ever to you,

Yours sincerely,

VIVEKANANDA.
