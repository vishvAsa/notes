+++(In the aftermath of 2024 BD coup + anti-hindu atrocities)+++

If one looks at life in general in India  
there are a lot of immediate concerns: 

- disease from infection, dietary extravagance & pollution; 
- local issues like finding water; 
- long commutes often through traffic; 
- sapping work schedules. 

So most people cannot really think about big geopolitical H issues. 

People without historical religious awareness seek hedonistic objectives when they have some time/money. 

People have strong regional linguistic identities in many parts of desh that trump any H vision.

Hence, anger would not widely expressed  
unless they feel that pressure themselves.  
Then the elephant would be roused.  
But a pack of Neandertals can kill a mammoth.

Unlike some of this medium,  
I would not blame the  BJPee too much:  
to be clear I have nothing to do with their politicians  
& don't derive any special benefits from them.  
I just think in any political system,  
especially if it is a democracy,  
what matters is the organization, will and cognitive capacity of the masses.  
No PM or party can substitute for this.  
It that existed the political will manifest.

In fact, I know some people here are going to be apoplectic, but what hell: I don't see a BJP problem here.  
Firstly, those blaming BJP, saMgha or lATesha: what is their pragmatic alternative and how will that be implemented.
Second, as I've said before, deep structural problems cannot be blamed on symptomatic issues.

One should not underestimate the power of the mlechCha-s.  
It takes serious balls to defy them  
and I'm not sure the govt sees that calculus as a clear win.+++(4)+++
