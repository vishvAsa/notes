> § 1. His Kula

>  1. Going back to the sixth century B.C., Northern India did not
> form a single Sovereign State.  
>  2. The country was divided into many States, some large, some
> small. Of these, some were monarchical and some non-monarchical.  
>  3. The monarchical States were altogether sixteen in number. They
> were known by the name\[s\] of Anga, Magadha, Kasi, Kosala, Vriji,
> Malla, Chedi, Vatsa, Kuru, Panchala, Matsya, Saursena, Asmaka, Avanti,
> Gandhara, and Kambhoja.  
>  4. The non-monarchical States were those of the Sakyas of
> Kapilvastu, the Mallas of Pava and Kushinara, the Lichhavis of
> Vaisali, the Videhas of Mithila, the Koliyas of Ramagam, the Bulis of
> Allakapa, the Kalingas of Resaputta, the Mauriyas of Pipphalvana, and
> the Bhaggas with their capital on Sumsumara Hill.  
>  5. The monarchical States were known as Janapada, and the
> non-monarchical as Sangh or Gana.  
>  6. Not much is known about the nature of the polity of the Sakyas
> of Kapilvatsu, whether it was republican or oligarchic.  
>  7. This much, however, is definitely known, that there were many
> ruling families in the Republic of the Sakyas, and that they ruled in
> turns.  
>  8. The head of the ruling family was known as Raja.  
>  9. At the time of the birth of Siddharth Gautama, it was the turn
> of Suddhodana to be the Raja.  
>  10. The Sakya State was situated in the northeast corner of India.
> It was an independent State. But at a later stage the King of Kosala
> had succeeded in establishing his paramountcy over it.  
>  11. The result of this paramountcy was that the Sakya State could
> not exercise certain sovereign powers without the sanction of the King
> of Kosala.  
>  12. Of the kingdoms then in existence, Kosala was a powerful
> kingdom. So was the kingdom of Magadha. Pasanedi, King of Kosala, and
> Bimbisara, King of Magadha, were the contemporaries of Siddharth
> Gautama.
>
>   
> § 2. His Ancestry
>
>  1. The capital of the Sakyas was the city called Kapilavatsu,
> perhaps after the name of the great Rationalist Kapila.  
>  2. There lived in Kapilavastu a Sakya, by name Jaya Sena. Sinahu
> was his son. Sinahu was married to Kaccana. Sinahu had five sons,
> Suddhodana, Dhotodana, Sakkodana, Suklodana, and Amitodana. Besides
> five sons, Sinahu had two daughters, Amita and Pamita.  
>  3. The Gotra of the family was Aditya.  
>  4. Suddhodana was married to Mahamaya. Her father's name was
> Anjana, and mother's Sulakshana. Anjana was a Koliya, and was residing
> in the village called Devadaha.  
>  5. Suddhodana was a man of great military prowess. When Suddhodana
> had shown his martial powers, he was allowed to take a second wife,
> and he chose Mahaprajapati. She was the elder sister of Mahamaya.  
>  6. Suddhodana was a wealthy person. The lands he held were very
> extensive, and the retinue under him was very large. He employed, it
> is said, one thousand ploughs to till the land he owned.  
>  7. He lived quite a luxurious life and had many palaces.
>
>   
> § 3. His Birth
>
>  1. To Suddhodana was born Siddharth Gautama, and this was the
> manner of Gautama's birth.  
>  2. It was a custom among the Sakyas to observe an annual midsummer
> festival which fell in the month of Ashad. It was celebrated by all
> the Sakyas throughout the State, and also by the members of the ruling
> family.  
>  3. It was the usual practice to celebrate the festival for seven
> days.  
>  4. On one occasion Mahamaya decided to observe the festival with
> gaiety, with splendour, with flowers, with perfume, but without
> drinking intoxicants.  
>  5. On the seventh day she rose early, bathed in scented water,
> bestowed a gift of 4,00,000 pieces of money as alms, adorned herself
> with all precious ornaments, ate \[the\] choicest food, took upon
> herself the fast-day vows, and entered the splendidly adorned royal
> bedchamber to sleep.  
>  6. That night Suddhodana and Mahamaya came together, and Mahamaya
> conceived. Lying on the royal bed, she fell asleep. While asleep she
> had a dream.  
>  7. In her dreams she saw that the four world-guardians raised her
> as she was sleeping on her bed and carried her to the tableland of
> the Himalayas, placed her under a great sal tree, and stood on one
> side.  
>  8. The wives of the four world-guardians then approached, and took
> her to the lake Mansarovar.  
>  9. They bathed her, robed her in a dress, anointed her with
> perfumes, and decked her with flowers in a manner fit to meet some
> divinity.  
>  10. Then a Bodhisatta, by name Sumedha, appeared before her
> saying, "I have decided to take my last and final birth on this earth,
> will you consent to be my mother?" She said, "Yes, with great
> pleasure." At this moment Mahamaya awoke.  
>  11. Next morning Mahamaya told her dream to Suddhodana. Not
> knowing how to interpret the dream, Suddhodana summoned eight Brahmins
> who were most famous in divination.  
>  12. They were Rama, Dhaga, Lakkana, Manti, Yanna, Suyama, Subhoga,
> and Sudatta and prepared for them a befitting reception.  
>  13. He caused the ground to be strewn with festive flowers, and
> prepared high seats for them.  
>  14. He filled the bowls of the Brahmins with gold and silver, and
> fed them on cooked ghee, honey, sugar, and excellent rice and milk. He
> also gave them other gifts, such as new clothes and tawny cows.  
>  15. When the Brahmins were propitiated, Suddhodana related to them
> the dream Mahamaya had \[had\], and said, " Tell me what it means."  
>  16. The Brahmins said, "Be not anxious. You will have a son, and
> if he leads a householder's life he will become a universal monarch,
> and if he leaves his home and goes forth into a homeless state, and
> becomes a sanyasi, he will become a Buddha, a dispeller of illusions
> in the world."  
>  17. Bearing the Bodhisatta in her womb like oil in a vessel for
> ten lunar months, Mahamaya, as her time of delivery was coming nearer,
> desired to go to her parents' home for delivery. Addressing her
> husband, she said, " I wish to go to Devadaha, the city of my
> father."  
>  18. "Thou knowest that thy wishes will be done," replied
> Suddhodana. Having seated her in a golden palanquin borne by couriers,
> he sent her forth with a great retinue to her father's house.  
>  19. Mahamaya, on her way to Devadaha, had to pass through a
> pleasure-grove of sal trees and other trees, flowering and
> non-flowering. It was known as the Lumbini Grove.  
>  20. As the palanquin was passing through it, the whole Lumbini
> Grove seemed like the heavenly Cittalata grove or like a banqueting
> pavilion adorned for a mighty king.  
>  21. From the roots to the tips of the branches the trees were
> loaded with fruits, flowers and numberless bees of the fine colours,
> uttering curious sounds, and flocks of various kinds of birds, singing
> sweet melodies.  
>  22. Witnessing the scene, there arose a desire in the heart of
> Mahamaya for halting and sporting therein for a while. Accordingly she
> told the couriers to take her in\[to\] the sal-grove and wait there.  
>  23. Mahamaya alighted from her palanquin and walked up to the foot
> of a royal sal tree. A pleasant wind, not too strong, was blowing, and
> the boughs of the trees were heaving up and down, and Mahamaya felt
> like catching one of them.  
>  24. Luckily one of the boughs heaved down sufficiently low to
> enable her to catch it. So she rose on her toes and caught the bough.
> Immediately she was lifted up by its upward movement, and being
> shaken, she felt the pangs of childbirth. While holding the branch of
> the sal tree she was delivered of a son in a standing position.  
>  25. The child was born in the year 563 B.C. on the Vaishakha
> Paurnima day.  
>  26. Suddhodana and Mahamaya were \[=had been\] married for a long
> time. But they had no issue. Ultimately \[=finally\] when a son was
> born to them, his birth was celebrated with great rejoicing, with
> great pomp and ceremony, by Suddhodana and his family and also by the
> Sakyas.  
>  27. At the time of the birth of the child it was the turn of
> Suddhodana to be the ruler of Kapilavatsu, and as such \[he\] was in
> the enjoyment of the title of Raja. Naturally the boy was called
> Prince.
>
>   
> § 4. Visit by Asita
>
>  1. At the moment when the child was born, there dwelt on the
> Himalayas a great sage named Asita.  
>  2. Asita heard that the gods over the space of the sky were
> shouting the word "Buddha" and making it resound. He beheld them
> waving their garments and coursing hither and thither in delight. He
> thought, what if I were to go and find out the land in which he was
> born?  
>  3. Surveying with his divine eyes the whole of the Jambudvipa,
> Asita saw that a boy was born in the house of Suddhodana, shining with
> all brilliance, and that it was over his birth that the gods were
> excited.  
>  4. So the great sage Asita, with his nephew Nardatta, rose up and
> came to the abode of Raja Suddhodana, and stood at the door of his
> palace.  
>  5. Now Asita, the sage, saw that at the door of Suddhodana's
> palace many hundred thousand beings had assembled. So he approached
> the door-keeper and said, "Go, man, inform the Raja that a sage is
> standing at the door."  
>  6. Then the door-keeper approached Suddhodana and with clasped
> hands said, "Know, O Raja, that an aged sage, old and advanced in
> years, stands at the door, and says that he desires to see you."  
>  7. The king prepared a seat for Asita and said to the door-keeper,
> "Let the sage enter." So coming out of the palace the door-keeper said
> to Asita, "Please go in."  
>  8. Now Asita approached King Suddhodana and, standing in front of
> him, said, "Victory, Victory, O Raja, may you live long, and rule thy
> kingdom righteously."  
>  9. Then Suddhodana in reverence to Asita fell at his feet and
> offered him the seat; and seeing him seated in comfort, Suddhodana
> said, "I do not remember to have seen thee before this, O Sage! With
> what purpose has thou come hither? What is the cause?"  
>  10. Thereupon Asita said to Suddhodana, "A son is born to thee, O
> Raja! Desiring to see him, have I come."  
>  11. Suddhodana said, "The boy is asleep, O Sage! Will you wait for
> a while? " The sage said, "Not long, O King, do such great beings
> sleep. Such good beings are by nature wakeful."  
>  12. Then did the child, out of compassion for Asita, the great
> sage, make a sign of awaking.  
>  13. Seeing that the child had become awake, Suddhodana took the
> boy firmly in both hands and brought him into the presence of the
> sage.  
>  14. Asita, observing the child, beheld that it was endowed with
> the thirty-two marks of a great man and adomed with the eighty minor
> marks, his body surpassing that of Sakra \[and\] Brahma, and his aura
> surpassing them a hundred thousand-fold \[he\] breathed forth this
> solemn utterance, "Marvellous, verily, is this person that has
> appeared in the world," and rising from his seat clasped his hands,
> fell at his feet, made a rightwise circuit round, and taking the child
> in his own hand stood in contemplation.  
>  15. Asita knew the old well-known prophecy that anyone endowed
> with the thirty-two marks of a great man, as Gautama was, has two
> careers open to him, and no third. "If he becomes a householder, he
> will become a universal monarch. But if he goes forth from the home to
> a homeless life, he will become a fully enlightened Buddha."  
>  16. Asita was sure that the child would not remain a
> householder.  
>  17. And looking at the child he wept, and shedding tears, sighed
> deeply.  
>  18. Suddhodana beheld Asita shedding tears, and sighing deeply.  
>  19. Beholding him thus weeping, the hair of his body rose, and in
> distress Suddhodana said to Asita, "Why, O Sage, dost thou weep and
> shed tears, and sigh so deeply? Surely, there is no misfortune in
> store for the child."  
>  20. At this Asita said to the Raja, "O King, I weep not for the
> sake of the child. There will be no misfortune for him. But I weep for
> myself."  
>  21. "And why?" asked Suddhodana. Asita replied, "I am old, aged,
> advanced in years, and this boy will without doubt become a Buddha and
> attain supreme and complete enlightenment; and having done so, will
> turn the supreme wheel of the Doctrine that has not been turned before
> him by any other being in the world; for the weal and happiness of the
> world will he teach his Doctrine."  
>  22. "The religious life, the Doctrine, that he will proclaim will
> be good in the beginning, good in the middle, good in the end,
> complete in the letter and the spirit, whole and pure."  
>  23. "Just as an Oudumbara flower at some time and place arises in
> the world, even so at some time and place, after countless cycles,
> revered Buddhas arise in the world. So also, O Raja! this boy will
> without doubt obtain supreme, complete enlightenment, and having done
> so will take countless beings across the ocean of sorrow and misery to
> a state of happiness."  
>  24. " But I shall not see that Buddha. Hence, O Raja, I weep, and
> in sadness I sigh deeply, for I shall not be able to reverence him."  
>  25. The king thereafter offered to the great sage Asita and
> Nardatta, his nephew, suitable food, and having given him robes, made
> a rightwise circuit round him.  
>  26. Thereupon Asita said to Nardatta, his nephew, "When thou shalt
> hear, Nardatta, that the child has become a Buddha, then go and take
> refuge in his teachings. This shall be for thy weal and welfare and
> happiness." So saying, Asita took leave of the Raja and departed for
> his hermitage.
>
>   
> § 5. Death of Mahamaya
>
>  1. On the fifth day, the ceremony of name-giving took place. The
> name chosen for the child was Siddharth. His clan name was Gautama.
> Popularly, therefore, he came to be called Siddharth Gautama.  
>  2. In the midst of rejoicing over the birth and the naming of the
> child, Mahamaya suddenly fell ill, and her illness became very
> serious.  
>  3. Realising that her end was near, she called Suddhodana and
> Prajapati to her bedside and said, " I am sure that the prophecy made
> by Asita about my son will come true. My regret is that I will not
> live to see it fulfilled."  
>  4. "My child will soon be a motherless child. But I am not worried
> in the least as to whether after me my child will be carefully nursed,
> properly looked after, and brought up in a manner befitting his
> future."  
>  5. "To you, Prajapati, I entrust my child; I have no doubt that
> you will be to him more than his mother."  
>  6. "Now do not be sorry. Permit me to die. God's call has come,
> and His messengers are waiting to take me." So saying, Mahamaya
> breathed her last. Both Suddhodana and Prajapati were greatly grieved
> and wept bitterly.  
>  7. Siddharth was only seven days old when his mother died.  
>  8. Siddharth had a younger brother, by name Nanda. He was the son
> of Suddhodana, born to Mahaprajapati.  
>  9. He had also several cousins, Mahanama and Anuruddha, sons of
> his uncle Suklodan; Ananda, son of his uncle Amitodan; and Devadatta,
> son of his aunt Amita. Mahanama was older than Siddharth, and Ananda
> was younger.  
>  10. Siddharth grew up in their company.
>
>   
> § 6. Childhood and Education
>
>  1. When Siddharth was able to walk and speak, the elders of the
> Sakyas assembled and asked Suddhodana that the boy should be taken to
> the temple of the village goddess Abhya.  
>  2. Suddhodana agreed, and asked Mahaprajapati to dress the boy.  
>  3. While she was doing so the child Siddharth, with a most sweet
> voice, asked his aunt where he was being taken. On learning that he
> was being taken to the temple, he smiled. But he went, conforming to
> the custom of the Sakyas.  
>  4. At the age of eight, Siddharth started his education.  
>  5. Those very eight Brahmins whom Suddhodana had invited to
> interpret Mahamaya's dream, and who had predicted his future, were his
> first teachers.  
>  6. After they had taught him what they knew, Suddhodana sent for
> Sabbamitta of distinguished descent and of high lineage in the land of
> Uddikka, a philologist and grammarian, well read in the **Veda**s,
> **Vedanga**s, and **Upanishad**s. Having poured out water of
> dedication from a golden vase, Suddhodana handed over the boy to his
> charge, to be taught. He was his second teacher.  
>  7. Under him Gautama mastered all the philosophic systems
> prevalent in his day.  
>  8. Besides this, he had learned the science of concentration and
> meditation from one Bhardawaj, a disciple of Alara Kalam, who had his
> ashram at Kapilavatsu.
>
>   
> § 7. Early Traits
>
>  1. Whenever he went to his father's farm and found no work, he
> repaired to a quiet place, and practised meditation.  
>  2. While everything for the cultivation of the mind was provided,
> his education in the military science befitting a Kshatriya was not
> neglected.  
>  3. For Suddhodana was anxious not to make the mistake of having
> cultivated the mind of his son at the cost of his manliness.  
>  4. Siddharth was of kindly disposition. He did not like
> exploitation of man by man.  
>  5. Once he went to his father's farm with some of his friends, and
> saw the labourers ploughing the land, raising bunds, cutting trees,
> etc., dressed in scanty clothes under a hot burning sun.  
>  6. He was greatly moved by the sight.  
>  7. He said to his friends, can it be right that one man should
> exploit another? How can it be right that the labourer should toil,
> and the master should live on the fruits of his labour?  
>  8. His friends did not know what to say. For they believed in the
> old philosophy of life that the worker was born to serve, and that in
> serving his master he was only fulfilling his destiny.  
>  9. The Sakyas used to celebrate a festival called Vapramangal. It
> was a rustic festival performed on the day of sowing. On this day,
> custom had made it obligatory on every Sakya to do ploughing
> personally.  
>  10. Siddharth always observed the custom, and did engage himself
> in ploughing.  
>  11. Though a man of learning, he did not despise manual labour.  
>  12. He belonged to a warrior class, and had been taught archery
> and the use of weapons. But he did not like causing unnecessary
> injury.  
>  13. He refused to join hunting parties. His friends used to say,
> "Are you afraid of tigers?" He used to retort by saying, "I know you
> are not going to kill tigers, you are going to kill harmless animals
> such as deer and rabbits."  
>  14. "If not for hunting, come to witness how accurate is the aim
> of your friends," they said. Even such invitations Siddharth refused,
> saying, "I do not like to see the killing of innocent animals."  
>  15. Prajapati Gautami was deeply worried over this attitude of
> Siddharth.  
>  16. She used to argue with him, saying, "You have forgotten that
> you are a Kshatriya and fighting is your duty. The art of fighting can
> be learned only through hunting, for only by hunting can you learn how
> to aim accurately. Hunting is a training ground for the warrior
> class."  
>  17. Siddharth often used to ask Gautami, "But, mother, why should
> a Kshatriya fight? And Gautami used to reply, "Because it is his
> duty."  
>  18. Siddharth was never satisfied by her answer. He used to ask
> Gautami, "Tell me, how can it be the duty of man to kill man?" Gautami
> argued, "Such an attitude is good for an ascetic. But Kshatriyas must
> fight. If they don't, who will protect the kingdom?"  
>  19. "But mother! If all Kshatriyas loved one another, would they
> not be able to protect their kingdom without resort to killing?"
> Gautami had to leave him to his own opinion.  
>  20. He tried to induce his companions to join him in practising
> meditation. He taught them the proper pose. He taught them to fix
> their mind on a subject. He advised them to select such thoughts as
> "May I be happy, may my relations be happy, may all living animals be
> happy."  
>  21. But his friends did not take the matter seriously. They
> laughed at him.  
>  22. On closing their eyes, they could not concentrate on their
> subject of meditation. Instead, some saw before their eyes deer for
> shooting or sweets for eating.  
>  23. His father and his mother did not like his partiality for
> meditation. They thought it was so contrary to the life of a
> Kshatriya.  
>  24. Siddharth believed that meditation on right subjects led to
> development of the spirit of universal love. He justified himself by
> saying, "When we think of living things, we begin with distinction and
> discrimination. We separate friends from enemies, we separate animals
> we rear from human beings. We love friends and domesticated animals
> and we hate enemies and wild animals."  
>  25. "This dividing line we must overcome. and this we can do when
> we in our contemplation rise above the limitations of practical life."
> Such was his reasoning.  
>  26. His childhood was marked by the presence of \[a\] supreme
> sense of compassion.  
>  27. Once he went to his father's farm. During recess he was
> resting under a tree. enjoying the peace and beauty of nature. While
> \[he was\] so seated, a bird fell from the sky just in front of him.  
>  28. The bird had been shot at by an arrow which had pierced its
> body, and was fluttering about in great agony.  
>  29. Siddharth rushed to the help of the bird. He removed the
> arrow, dressed its wound, and gave it water to drink. He picked up the
> bird, came to the place where he was \[=had been\] seated, and wrapped
> up the bird in his upper garment and held it next to his chest to give
> it warmth.  
>  30. Siddharth was wondering who could have shot this innocent
> bird. Before long there came his cousin Devadatta, armed with all the
> implements of shooting. He told Siddharth that he had shot a bird
> flying in the sky, the bird was wounded but it flew some distance and
> fell somewhere there, and asked him if he had seen it.  
>  31. Siddharth replied in the affirmative and showed him the bird,
> which had by that time \[had\] completely recovered.  
>  32. Devadatta demanded that the bird be handed over to him. This
> Siddharth refused to do. A sharp argument ensued between the two.  
>  33. Devadatta argued that he was the owner of the bird, because by
> the rules of the game, he who kills a game becomes the owner of the
> game.  
>  34. Siddharth denied the validity of the rule. He argued that it
> is only he who protects that has the right to claim ownership. How can
> he who wants to kill be the owner?  
>  35. Neither party would yield. The matter was referred to
> arbitration. The arbitrator upheld the point of view of Siddharth
> Gautama.  
>  36. Devadatta became his permanent enemy. But Gautama's spirit of
> compassion was so great that he preferred to save \[=saving\] the life
> of an innocent bird to securing the goodwill of his cousin.  
>  37. Such were the traits of character found in the early life of
> Siddharth Gautama.
>
>   
> § 8. Marriage
>
>  1. There was a Sakya by name Dandapani. Yeshodhara was his
> daughter. She was well known for her beauty and for her 'sila'.  
>  2. Yeshodhara had reached her sixteenth year, and Dandapani was
> thinking about her marriage.  
>  3. According to custom Dandapani sent invitations to young men of
> all the neighbouring countries, for the Swayamvar of his daughter.  
>  4. An invitation was also sent to Siddharth Gautama.  
>  5. Siddharth Gautama had completed his sixteenth year. His parents
> also were equally anxious to get him married.  
>  6. They asked him to go to the Swayamvar and offer his hand to
> Yeshodhara. He agreed to follow his parents' wishes.  
>  7. From amongst the young men Yeshodhara's choice fell on
> Siddharth Gautama.  
>  8. Dandapani was not very happy. He felt doubtful about the
> success of the marriage.  
>  9. Siddharth, he felt, was addicted to the company of saints and

>  10. Yeshodhara, who was determined to marry none but Siddharth,

>  11. Knowing her daughter's determination to marry no one but

>  12. The rivals of Gautama were not only disappointed, but felt

>  13. They wanted that in fairness to them, Yeshodhara should have

>  14. For the time being they kept quiet, believing that Dandapani
> would not allow Yeshodhara to choose Siddharth Gautama, so that their

>  15. But when Dandapani failed, they made bold and demanded \[=to
> demand\] that a test of skill in archery be prescribed. Dandapani had
> to agree.  
>  16. At first Siddharth was not prepared for this. But Channa, his
> charioteer, pointed out to him what disgrace his refusal would bring
> upon his father, upon his family, and upon Yeshodhara.  
>  17. Siddharth Gautama was greatly impressed by this argument, and
> agreed to take part in the contest.  
>  18. The contest began. Each candidate showed his skill in turn.  
>  19. Gautama's turn came last. But his was the highest
> marksmanship.  
>  20. Thereafter the marriage took place. Both Suddhodana and
> Dandapani were happy. So was \[=were\] Yeshodhara and Mahaprajapati.

> § 9. Father's Plans to Save His Son
>
>  1. While the king was happy to see his son married, and thus
> enter\[ing\] the life of a householder, the prophecy of the sage Asita
> continued to haunt him.  
>  2. To prevent the prophecy from coming true, he thought of getting
> him engrossed in the pleasures and carnal joys of life.  
>  3. With this object in view, Suddhodana built three luxurious
> palaces for his son to live in, one for summer, one for the rainy
> season, and one for winter, furnished with all the requirements and
> excitements for a full amorous life.  
>  4. Each palace was surrounded by an extensive garden beautifully
> laid out with all kinds of trees and flowers.  
>  5. In consultation with his family priest Udayin, he thought of
> providing a harem for the prince with very beautiful inmates.  
>  6. Suddhodana then told Udayin to advise the girls how to go about
> the business of winning over the prince to the pleasures of life.  
>  7. Having collected the inmates of the harem, Udayin first advised
> them how they should win over the prince.  
>  8. Addressing them he said, "Ye are all skilled in all the
> graceful arts, ye are proficient in understanding the language of
> amorous sentiments, ye are possessed of beauty and gracefulness, ye
> are thorough masters in your own styles.  
>  9. "With these graces of yours, ye are able to move even sages who
> have lost all their desires, and to ensnare even the gods, who are
> charmed by heavenly nymphs.  
>  10. "By your skill in expressing the heart's feelings, by your
> coquetry, your grace, and your perfect beauty, ye are able to
> enrapture even women--how much more easily, men.  
>  11. "Thus, skilled as ye are, each set in your own proper sphere,
> it should not be beyond your reach to captivate and capture the prince
> and hold him in your bondage.  
>  12. "Any timid action on your part would be fit for new brides
> whose eyes are closed through shame.  
>  13. "What though this hero be great by his exalted glory, yet
> 'great is the might of woman'. Let this be your firm resolve.  
>  14. "In olden time a great seer, hard to be conquered even by
> gods, was spurned by a harlot, the beauty of Kasi, planting her feet
> upon him.  
>  15. "And the great seer Visvamitra, though plunged in a profound
> penance, was carried captive for ten years in the forests by the nymph
> Ghritaki.  
>  16. "Many such seers as these have women brought to naught--how
> much more, then, a delicate prince in the first flower of his age?  
>  17. "This being so, boldly put forth your efforts, that the
> posterity of the king's family may not be turned away from him.  
>  18. "Ordinary women captivate simple men; but they are truly
> women, who subdue the nature of high and hard."
>
>   
> § 10. The Failure of the Women to Win the Prince
>
>  1. Having heard these words of Udayin, the women, stung to the
> heart, rose even above themselves for the conquest of the prince.  
>  2. But even with their brows, their glances, their coquetries,
> their smiles, their delicate movements, the girls of the harem did not
> feel sure of themselves.  
>  3. But they soon regained their confidence through the command of
> the family priest and the gentle temperament of the prince, and
> through the power of intoxication and of love.  
>  4. The women then set upon their task and made the prince wander
> in the woods like an elephant in the forests of Himavat, accompanied
> by a herd of females.  
>  5. Attended by women, he shone in that pleasant grove, as the sun
> surrounded by Apsaras in his royal garden.  
>  6. There, some of them, urged by passion, pressed him with their
> full, firm bosoms in gentle collisions.  
>  7. Others violently embraced him after pretending to stumble, then
> leaning on him with their shoulders drooping down, and with their
> gentle creeper-like arms.  
>  8. Others with their mouths smelling of spirituous liquor, their
> lower lips red like copper, whispered in bis ear, "Let my secret be
> heard."  
>  9. Others, all wet with unguents, as if giving him a command,
> clasped his hand eagerly and said, "Perform thy rites of. adoration
> here."  
>  10. Another, with her blue garments continually slipping down in
> pretended intoxication, stood conspicuous with her tongue visible,
> like the night with its lightning lashing.  
>  11. Others, with their golden ones tinkling, wandered about here
> and there, showing him their bodies veiled with thin cloth.  
>  12. Others leaned, holding a mango bough in hand, displaying their
> bosoms like golden jars.  
>  13. Some, coming from a lotus bed, carrying lotuses and with eyes
> like lotuses, stood like the lotus goddess Padma, by the side of that
> lotus-faced prince.  
>  14. Another sang a sweet song easily understood, and with the
> proper gesticulations, rousing him, self-subdued though he was, by her
> glance, as saying, "O how thou art deluded!"  
>  15. Another, having armed herself with her bright face, with its
> brow drawn to its full, imitated his action, as playing the hero.  
>  16. Another, with beautiful, full bosoms, and having her earrings
> waving in the wind, laughed loudly at him, as if saying, "Catch me,
> sir, if you can!"  
>  17. Some, as he was going away, bound him with strings of
> garlands; others punished him with words like an elephant-driver's
> hook, gentle yet reproachful.  
>  18. Another, wishing to argue with him, seizing a mango spray,
> asked, all bewildered with passion, "'This flower, whose is it?"  
>  19. Another, assuming a gait and attitude like that of a man, said
> to him, "You who are conquered. by a woman, go and conquer this
> earth!"  
>  20. Then another, with rolling eyes, smelling a blue lotus, thus
> addressed the prince with words slightly indistinct in her
> excitement:  
>  21. "See, my lord, this mango covered with its honey-scented
> flowers, where the bird *kokila* sings, as if imprisoned in a golden
> cage.  
>  22. "Come and see this *Asoka* tree, which augments lovers'
> sorrows, where the bees make a noise as if they were scorched by
> fire.  
>  23. "Come and see this *Tilaka* tree, embraced by a slender mango
> branch, like a man in a white garment by a woman decked with yellow
> ungents.  
>  24. "Behold the kurubaka in flower, bright like fresh resin-juice,
> which bends down as if it felt reproached by the colour of women's
> nails.  
>  25. "Come and see this young *Asoka*, covered all over with new
> shoots, which stands as if it were ashamed at the beauty of our
> hands.  
>  26. "See this lake surrounded by the *Sinduvara* shrubs growing on
> its banks, like a fair woman reclining, clad in fine white cloth.  
>  27. "See the imperial power of females--yonder *Ruddygoose* in the
> water goes behind his mate, following her like a slave.  
>  28. "Come and listen to the notes of the intoxicated *Cuckoo* as
> he sings, while another *cuckoo* sings as if consenting wholly without
> care.  
>  29. "Would that thine was the intoxication of the birds which the
> spring produces, and not the thought of a thinking man, ever pondering
> how wise he is!"  
>  30. Thus these young women, their souls carried away by love,
> assailed the prince with all kinds of stratagems.  
>  31. But although thus attacked, he, having his sense guarded by
> self-control; neither rejoiced nor smiled.  
>  32. Having seen them in their real condition, the Prince pondered
> with an undisturbed and steadfast mind.  
>  33. "What is it that these women lack, that they perceive not that
> youth is fickle? For old age will destroy whatever beauty has."  
>  34. This round of blandishment went on for months and years with
> no results.
>
>   
> § 11. The Prime Minister's Admonition to the Prince
>
>  1. Udayin realized that the girls had failed, and that the Prince
> had shown no interest in them.  
>  2. Udayin, well skilled in the rules of policy, thought of talking
> to the prince.  
>  3. Meeting the prince all alone, Udayin said, "Since I was
> appointed by the king as a fitting friend for thee, therefore I wish
> to speak to thee in the friendliness of my heart." So began Udayin.  
>  4. "To hinder from what is disadvantageous, to urge to do what is
> advantageous, and not to forsake in misfortune, these are the three
> marks of a friend.  
>  5. "If I, after having promised my friendship, were not to heed
> when thou turnest away from the great end of man, there would be no
> friendship in me.  
>  6. "It is right to woo a woman even by guile; this is useful both
> for getting rid of shame and for one's own enjoyment.  
>  7. "Reverential behaviour and compliance with her wishes are what
> bind a woman's heart; good qualities truly are a cause of love, and
> women love respect.  
>  8. "Wilt thou not then, O large-eyed prince, even if thy heart is
> unwilling, seek to please them with a courtesy worthy of this beauty
> of thine?  
>  9. "Courtesy is the balm of women, courtesy is the best ornament;
> beauty without courtesy is like a grove without flowers.  
>  10. "But of what use is courtesy by itself? Let it be assisted by
> the heart's feelings; surely, when worldly objects so hard to attain
> are in the grasp, thou wilt not despise them.  
>  11. "Knowing that pleasure was the best of objects, even the god
> Purandara (Indra) wooed in olden times Ahalya, the wife of the saint
> Gautama.  
>  12. "So too Agastya wooed Rohini, the wife of Soma; and therefore,
> as Sruti saith, a like thing befell Lopamudra.  
>  13. "The great ascetic Brihaspati begot Bharadwaja on Mamata the
> daughter of the Maruta, the wife of Autathya.  
>  14. "The Moon, the best of offerers, begat Buda of divine nature
> on the spouse of Vrihaspati, as she was offering a libation.  
>  15. "So too in old times Parasara, overpowered by passion on the
> banks of the Yamuna, lay with the maiden Kali, who was the daughter of
> the son of Varuna.  
>  16. "The sage Vasishtha through lust begot a son, Kapinglada, on
> Akshmala, a despised low-caste woman.  
>  17. "And the seer-king Yayat, even when the vigour of his prime
> was gone, sported in the Kaitrartha forest with the Apsara Visvaki.  
>  18. "And the Kaurava king Pandu, though he knew that intercourse
> with his wife would end in death, yet overcome by the beauty and good
> qualities of Madri, yielded to the pleasures of love.  
>  19. "Great heroes such as these pursued even contemptible desires
> for the sake of pleasure, how much more so when they are praiseworthy
> of their kind?  
>  20. "And yet thou, a young man, possessed of strength and beauty,
> despisest enjoyments which rightly belong to thee and to which the
> whole world is devoted."
>
>   
> § 12. The Prince's Reply to the Prime Minister
>
>  1. Having heard these specious words of his, well-supported by
> sacred tradition, the prince made reply, in a voice like the
> thundering of a cloud:  
>  2. "This speech manifesting affection is well-befitting in thee;
> but I will convince thee as to where thou wrongly judgest me.  
>  3. "I do not despise worldly objects, I know that all mankind is
> bound up therein. But remembering that the world is transitory, my
> mind cannot find pleasure in them.  
>  4. "Yet even though this beauty of women were to remain perpetual,
> still delight in the pleasures of desires would not be worthy of the
> wise man.  
>  5. "And as for what thou sayest as to even those great men having
> become victims to desire, do not be led away by them; for destruction
> was also their lot.  
>  6. "Real greatness is not to be found there, where there is
> destruction, or where there is attachment to earthly objects, or a
> want of self-control.  
>  7. "And when thou sayest, 'Let one deal with women by guile', I
> know about guile, even if it be accompanied with courtesy.  
>  8. "That compliance too with a woman's wishes pleases me not, if
> truthfulness be not there; if there be not a union with one's whole
> soul and nature, then 'out upon it' say I.  
>  9. "A soul overpowered by passion, believing in falsehood, carried
> away by attachment and blind to the faults of its objects, what is
> there in it worth being deceived?  
>  10. "And if the victims of passion do deceive one another, are not
> men unfit for women to look at and women for men?  
>  11. "Since then these things are so, thou surely wouldst not lead
> me astray into ignoble pleasures."  
>  12. Udayin felt silenced by the firm and strong resolve of the
> prince and reported the matter to his father.  
>  13. Suddhodana, when he heard how his son's mind turned away from
> all objects of sense, could not sleep all that night. Like an elephant
> with an arrow in his heart, he was full of pain.  
>  14. He and his ministers spent much of their time in consultation,
> hoping to find some means to draw Siddharth to the pleasures of carnal
> life, and thus to dissuade him from the likely turn which he may
> \[=might\] give to his life. But they found no other means besides
> those they had tried.  
>  15. And the seraglio of women, wearing their garlands and
> ornaments in vain, with their graceful arts and endearments all
> fruitless, concealing their love deep in their hearts, was disbanded.
>
>   
> § 13. Initiation into the Sakya Sangh
>
>  1. The Sakyas had their Sangh. Every Sakya youth above twenty had
> to be initiated into the Sangh and be a member of the Sangh.  
>  2. Siddharth Gautama had reached the age of twenty. It was time
> for him to be initiated into the Sangh and become a member thereof.  
>  3. The Sakyas had a meeting-house which they called Sansthagar. It
> was situated in Kapilavatsu. The session of the Sangh was also held in
> the Sansthagar.  
>  4. With the object of getting Siddharth initiated into the Sangh,
> Suddhodana asked the Purohit of the Sakyas to convene a meeting of the
> Sangh.  
>  5. Accordingly the Sangh met at Kapilavatsu in the Sansthagar of
> the Sakyas.  
>  6. At the meeting of the Sangh, the Purohit proposed that
> Siddharth be enrolled as a member of the Sangh.  
>  7. The Senapati of the Sakyas then rose in his seat and addressed
> the Sangh as follows, "Siddharth Gautama, born in the family of
> Suddhodana of the Sakya clan, desires to be a member of the Sangh. He
> is twenty years of age and is in every way fit to be a member of the
> Sangh. I, therefore, move that he be made a member of the Sakya Sangh.
> Pray, those who are against the motion speak."  
>  8. No one spoke against it. "A second time do I ask those who are
> against the motion to speak," said the Senapati.  
>  9. No one rose to speak against the motion. Again the Senapati
> said, "A third time do I ask those who are against the motion to
> speak."  
>  10. Even for the third time no one spoke against it.  
>  11. It was the rule of procedure among the Sakyas that there could
> be no debate without a motion, and no motion could be declared carried
> unless it was passed three times.  
>  12. The motion of the Senapati having been carried three times
> without opposition, Siddharth was declared to have been duly admitted
> as a member of the Sakya Sangh.  
>  13. Thereafter the Purohit of the Sakyas stood up and asked
> Siddharth to rise in his place.  
>  14. Addressing Siddharth, he said, "Do you realize that the Sangh
> has honoured you by making you a member of it?" "I do, sir," replied
> Siddharth.  
>  15. "Do you know the obligation of membership of the Sangh?" "I am
> sorry, sir, I do not. But I shall be happy to know them, sir," said
> Siddharth.  
>  16. "I shall first tell you what your duties as a member of the
> Sangh are " said the Purohit and he then related them one by one:" (1)
> You must safeguard the interests of the Sakyas by your body, mind and
> money. (2) You must not absent yourself from the meetings of the
> Sangh. (3) You must without fear or favour expose any fault you may
> notice in the conduct of a Sakya. (4) You must not be angry if you are
> accused of an offence, but confess if you are guilty or state if you
> are innocent."  
>  17. Proceeding, the Purohit said, "I shall next tell you what will
> disqualify you for membership of the Sangh: (1) You cannot remain a
> member of the Sangh if you commit rape. (2) You cannot remain a member
> of the Sangh if you commit murder. (3) You cannot remain a member of
> the Sangh if you commit theft. (4) You cannot remain a member of the
> Sangh if you are guilty of giving false evidence."  
>  18. "I am grateful to you, sir," said Siddharth, "for telling me
> the rules of discipline of the Sakya Sangh. I assure you I will do my
> best to follow them in letter and in spirit."
>
>   
> § 14. Conflict with the Sangh
>
>  1. Eight years had passed by since Siddharth was made a member of
> the Sakya Sangh.  
>  2. He was a very devoted and steadfast member of the Sangh. He
> took the same interest in the affairs of the Sangh as he did in his
> own. His conduct as a member of the Sangh was exemplary, and he had
> endeared himself to all.  
>  3. In the eighth year of his membership, an event occurred which
> resulted in a tragedy for the family of Suddhodana and a crisis in the
> life of Siddharth.  
>  4. This is the origin of the tragedy.  
>  5. Bordering on the State of the Sakyas was the State of the
> Koliyas. The two kingdoms were divided by the river Rohini.  
>  6. The waters of the Rohini were used by both the Sakyas and the
> Koliyas for irrigating their fields. Every season there used to be
> disputes between them as to who should take the water of the Rohini
> first, and how much. These disputes resulted in quarrels and sometimes
> in affrays.  
>  7. In the year when Siddharth was twenty-eight, there was a major
> clash over the waters between the servants of the Sakyas and the
> servants of the Koliyas. Both sides suffered injuries.  
>  8. Coming to know of this, the Sakyas and the Koliyas felt that
> the issue must be settled once for all by war.  
>  9. The Senapati of the Sakyas, therefore, called a session of the
> Sakya Sangh to consider the question of declaring war on the
> Koliyas.  
>  10. Addressing the members of the Sangh, the Senapati said, "Our
> people have been attacked by the Koliyas and they had to retreat. Such
> acts of aggression by the Koliyas have taken place more than once. We
> have tolerated them so far. But this cannot go on. It must be stopped,
> and the only way to stop it is to declare war against the Koliyas. I
> propose that the Sangh do declare war on the Koliyas. Those who wish
> to oppose may speak."  
>  11. Siddharth Gautama rose in his seat and said, "I oppose this
> resolution. War does not solve any question. Waging war will not serve
> our purpose. It will sow the seeds of another war. The slayer gets a
> slayer in his turn; the conqueror gets one who conquers him; a man who
> despoils is despoiled in his turn."  
>  12. Siddharth Gautama continued, "I feel that the Sangh should not
> be in hase to declare war on the Koliyas. Careful investigation should
> be made to ascertain who is the guilty party. I hear that our men have
> also been aggressors. If this be true, then it is obvious that we too
> are not free from blame."  
>  13. The Senapati replied, "Yes, our men were the aggressors. But
> it must not be forgotten that it was our turn to take the water
> first."  
>  14. Siddharth Gautama said, "This shows that we are not completely
> free from blame. I therefore propose that we elect two men from us,
> and the Koliyas should be asked to elect two from them, and the four
> should elect a fifth person, and these should settle the dispute."  
>  15. The amendment moved by Siddharth Gautama was duly seconded.
> But the Senapati opposed the amendment, saying, "I am sure that this
> menace of the Koliyas will not end unless they are severely
> punished."  
>  16. The resolution and the amendment had therefore to be put to
> vote. The amendment moved by Siddharth Gautama was put first. It was
> declared lost by an overwhelming majority.  
>  17. The Senapati next put his own resolution to vote. Siddharth
> Gautama again stood up to oppose it. "I beg the Sangh," he said, "not
> to accept the resolution. The Sakyas and the Koliyas are close
> relations. It is unwise that they should destroy each other."  
>  18. The Senapati encountered the plea urged by Siddharth Gautama.
> He stressed that in war the Kshatriyas cannot make a distinction
> between relations and strangers. They must fight even against brothers
> for the sake of their kingdom.  
>  19. Performing sacrifices is the duty of the Brahmins, fighting is
> the duty of the Kshatriyas, trading is the duty of the Vaishyas, and
> service is the duty of the Shudras. There is merit in each class
> performing its duty. Such is the injunction of our Shastras.  
>  20. Siddharth replied, "Dharma, as I understand it, consists in
> recognising that enmity does not disappear by enmity. It can be
> conquered by love only."  
>  21. The Senapati, getting impatient, said, "It is unnecessary to
> enter upon this philosophical disquisition. The point is that
> Siddharth is opposed to my resolution. Let us ascertain what the Sangh
> has to say about it by putting it to \[a\] vote."  
>  22. Accordingly the Senapati put his resolution to \[a\] vote. It
> was declared carried by an overwhelming majority.
>
>   
> § 15. Offer of Exile
>
>  1. Next day the Senapati called another meeting of the Sakya
> Sangh, to have his plan of mobilisation considered by the Sangh.  
>  2. When the Sangh met, he proposed that he be permitted to
> proclaim an order calling to arms, for the war against the Koliyas,
> every Sakya between the ages of 20 and 50.  
>  3. The meeting was attended by both sides--those who at the
> previous meeting of the Sangh had voted in favour of a declaration of
> war, as well as those who had voted against it.  
>  4. For those who had voted in favour, there was no difficulty in
> accepting the proposal of the Senapati. It was a natural consequence
> of their earlier decision.  
>  5. But the minority who had voted against it had a problem to
> face. Their problem was—to submit or not to submit to the decision of
> the majority.  
>  6. The minority was determined not to submit to the majority. That
> is the reason why they had decided to be present at the meeting.
> Unfortunately, none of them had the courage to say so openly. Perhaps
> they knew the consequences of opposing the majority.  
>  7. Seeing that his supporters were silent, Siddharth stood up, and
> addressing the Sangh, said, "Friends! You may do what you like. You
> have a majority on your side, but I am sorry to say I shall oppose
> your decision in favour of mobilisation. I shall not join your army,
> and I shall not take part in the war."  
>  8. The Senapati, replying to Siddharth Gautama, said, "Do remember
> the vows you had taken when you were admitted to the membership of the
> Sangh? If you break any of them, you will expose yourself to public
> shame."  
>  9. Siddharth replied, "Yes, I have pledged myself to safeguard the
> best interests of the Sakyas by my body, mind and money. But I do not
> think that this war is in the best interests of the Sakyas. What is
> public shame to me before the best interests of the Sakyas?"  
>  10. Siddharth proceeded to caution the Sangh by reminding it of
> how the Sakyas have \[=had\] become the vassals of the King of Kosala
> by reason of their quarrels with the Koliyas. "It is not difficult to
> imagine," he said, "that this war will give him a greater handle to
> further reduce the freedom of the Sakyas."  
>  11. The Senapati grew angry and, addressing Siddharth, said, "Your
> eloquence will not help you. You must obey the majority decision of
> the Sangh. You are perhaps counting upon the fact that the Sangh has
> no power to order an offender to be hanged or to exile him without the
> sanction of the king of the Kosalas, and that the king of the Kosalas
> will not give permission if either of the two sentences was passed
> against you by the Sangh."  
>  12. "But remember, the Sangh has other ways of punishing you. The
> Sangh can declare a social boycott against your family, and the Sangh
> can confiscate your family lands. For this the Sangh does not have to
> obtain the permission of the king of the Kosalas."  
>  13. Siddharth realised the consequences that would follow if he
> continued his opposition to the Sangh in its plan of war against the
> Koliyas. He had three alternatives to consider--to join the forces and
> participate in the war; to consent to being hanged or exiled; and to
> allow the members of his family to be condemned to a social boycott
> and confiscation of property.  
>  14. He was firm in not accepting the first. As to the third, he
> felt it was unthinkable. Under the circumstances, he felt that the
> second alternative was the best.  
>  15. Accordingly, Siddharth spoke to the Sangh. "Please do not
> punish my family. Do not put them in distress by subjecting them to a
> social boycott. Do not make them destitute by confiscating their land,
> which is their only means of livelihood. They are innocent. I am the

> § 16. Parivraja--the Way Out
>
>  1. The Senapati said, "It is difficult to accept your suggestion.
> For even if you voluntarily agreed to undergo the sentence of death or
> exile, the matter is sure to become known to the king of the Kosalas,
> and he is sure to conclude that it is the Sangh which has inflicted
> this punishment, and take action against the Sangh."  
>  2. "If this is the difficulty, I can easily suggest a way out,"
> said Siddharth Gautama. "I can become a Parivrajaka and leave this
> country. It is a kind of an exile."  
>  3. The Senapati thought this was a good solution. But he had still
> some doubt about Siddharth being able to give effect to it.  
>  4. So the Senapati asked Siddharth, "How can you become a
> Parivrajaka unless you obtain the consent of your parents and your
> wife?"  
>  5. Siddharth assured him that he would do his best to obtain their
> permission. I promise," he said, "to leave this country immediately,
> whether I obtain their consent or not."  
>  6. The Sangh felt that the proposal made by Siddharth was the best
> way out, and they agreed to it.  
>  7. After finishing the business before the meeting, the Sangh was
> about to rise when a young Sakya got up in his place and said, "Give
> me a hearing, I have something important to say."  
>  8. Being granted permission to speak, he said, "I have no doubt
> that Siddharth Gautama will keep his promise and leave the country
> immediately. There is, however, one question over which I do not feel
> very happy.  
>  9. "Now that Siddharth will soon be out of sight, does the Sangh
> propose to give immediate effect to its declaration of war against the
> Koliyas?  
>  10. "I want the Sangh to give further consideration to this
> question. In any event, the king of the Kosalas is bound to come to
> know of the exile of Siddharth Gautama. If the Sakyas declare a war
> against the Koliyas immediately, the king of \[the\] Kosalas will
> understand that Siddharth left only because he was opposed to war
> against the Koliyas. This will not go well with us.  
>  11. "I, therefore, propose that we should also allow an interval
> to pass between the exile of Siddharth Gautama and the actual
> commencement of hostilities, so as not to allow the King of Kosala to
> establish any connection between the two."  
>  12. The Sangh realised that this was a very important proposal.
> And as a matter of expediency, the Sangh agreed to accept it.  
>  13. Thus ended the tragic session of the Sakya Sangh, and the
> minority which was opposed to the war but who had not the courage to
> say so, heaved a sigh of relief that it was able to overcome a
> situation full of calamitous consequences.
>
>   
> § 17. Parting Words
>
>  1. The news of what happened at the meeting of the Sakya Sangh had
> travelled to the Raja's palace long before the return of Siddharth
> Gautama.  
>  2. For on reaching home, he found his parents weeping and plunged
> in great grief.  
>  3. Suddhodana said, "We were talking about the evils of war. But I
> never thought that you would go to such lengths."  
>  4. Siddharth replied, I too did not think things would take such
> a turn. I was hoping that I would be able to win over the Sakyas to
> the cause of peace by my argument.  
>  5. "Unfortunately, our military officers had so worked up the
> feelings of the men that my argument failed to have any effect on
> them.  
>  6. "But I hope you realise how I have saved the situation from
> becoming worse. I have not given up the cause of truth and justice,
> and whatever the punishment for my standing for truth and justice, I
> have succeeded in making its infliction personal to me."  
>  7. Suddhodana was not satisfied with this. "You have not
> considered what is to happen to us." "But that is the reason why I
> undertook to become a Parivrajaka," replied Siddharth. "Consider the
> consequences if the Sakyas had ordered the confiscation of your
> lands."  
>  8. "But without you what is the use of these lands to us?" cried
> Suddhodana. "Why should not the whole family leave the country of the
> Sakyas and go into exile along with you?"  
>  9. Prajapati Gautami, who was weeping, joined Suddhodana in
> argument, saying, "I agree. How can you go alone leaving us here like
> this?"  
>  10. Siddharth said, "Mother, have you not always claimed to be the
> mother of a Kshatriya? Is that not so? You must then be brave. This
> grief is unbecoming of \[=to\] you. What would you have done if I had
> gone to the battle-field and died? Would you have grieved like
> this?"  
>  11. "No," replied Gautami. "That would have been befitting a
> Kshatriya. But you are now going into the jungle far away from people,
> living in the company of wild beasts. How can we stay here in peace? I
> say you should take us along with you."  
>  12. "How can I take you all with me? Nanda is only a child. Rahul
> my son is just born. Can you come, leaving them here?" he asked
> Gautami.  
>  13. Gautami was not satisfied. She urged, "It is possible for us
> all to leave the country of the Sakyas, and go to the country of the
> Kosalas under the protection of their king."  
>  14. "But mother! What would the Sakyas say?" asked Siddharth.
> "Would they not regard it as treason? Besides, I pledged that I will
> do nothing either by word or by deed to let the king of the Kosalas
> know the true cause of my Parivraja.  
>  15. "It is true that I may have to live alone in the jungle. But
> which is better? To live in the jungle, or to be a party to the
> killing of the Koliyas!"  
>  16. "But why this impatience?" asked Suddhodana. "The Sakyas Sangh
> has decided to postpone the date of the hostilities for some time.  
>  17. "Perhaps the hostilities may not be started at all. Why not
> postpone your Parivraja? Maybe it would be possible to obtain the
> permission of the Sangh for you to stay among the Sakyas."  
>  18. This idea was repellent to Siddharth. "It is because I
> promised to take Parivraja that the Sangh decided to postpone the
> commencement of hostilities against the Koliyas.  
>  19. "It is possible that after I take Parivraja the Sangh may be
> persuaded to withdraw their declaration of war. All this depends upon
> my first taking Parivraja.  
>  20. "I have made a promise, and I must carry it out. The
> consequences of any breach of promise may be very grave both to us and
> to the cause of peace.  
>  21. "Mother, do not now stand in my way. Give me your permission
> and your blessings. What is happening is for the best."  
>  22. Gautami and Suddhodana kept silent.  
>  23. Then Siddharth went to the apartment of Yeshodhara. Seeing
> her, he stood silent, not knowing what to say and how to say it. She
> broke the silence by saying, "I have heard all that has happened at
> the meeting of the Sangh at Kapilavatsu."  
>  24. He asked her, "Yeshodhara, tell me what you think of my
> decision to take Parivraja."  
>  25. He expected she would collapse. Nothing of the kind
> happened.  
>  26. With full control over her emotions, she replied, "What else
> could I have done if I were in your position? I certainly would not
> have been a party to a war on the Koliyas.  
>  27. "Your decision is the right decision. You have my consent and
> my support. I too would have taken Parivraja with you. If I do not, it
> is only because I have Rahula to look after.  
>  28. "I wish it had not come to this. But we must be bold and brave
> and face the situation. Do not be anxious about your parents and your
> son. I will look after them till \[=as long as\] there is life in
> me.  
>  29. "All I wish is that now that you are becoming a Parivrajaka,
> leaving behind all who are near and dear to you, you will find a new
> way of life which would result in the happiness of mankind."  
>  30. Siddharth Gautama was greatly impressed. He realised as never
> before what a brave, courageous and noble-minded woman Yeshodhara was,
> and how fortunate he was in having her as his wife, and how fate had
> put them asunder. He asked her to bring Rahula. He cast his fatherly
> look on him, and left.
>
>   
> § 18. Leaving His Home
>
>  1. Siddharth thought of taking Parivraja at the hands of
> Bharadwaja, who had his Ashram at Kapila-vatsu. Accordingly he rose
> the next day and started for the Ashram on his favourite horse
> Kanthaka, with his servant Channa walking along.  
>  2. As he came near the Ashram, men and women came out and thronged
> the gates to meet him as a newly arrived bridegroom.  
>  3. And when they came up to him, their eyes wide open in wonder,
> they performed their due homage with hands folded like a lotus
> calyx.  
>  4. Then they stood surrounding him, their minds overpowered by
> passion, as if they were drinking him in, with their eyes motionless
> and blossoming wide with love.  
>  5. Some of the women verily thought that he was Kama incarnate,
> decorated as he was with his brilliant signs as with connate \[?\]
> ornaments.  
>  6. Others thought from his gentleness and his majesty that it was
> the moon with its ambrosial beams, as it were, visibly come down to
> the earth.  
>  7. Others, smitten by his beauty, yawned as if to swallow him, and
> fixing their eyes on each other, softly sighed.  
>  8. Thus the women only looked upon him, simply gazing with their
> eyes. They spoke not, nor did they smile. They surrounded him and
> stood aghast, thinking of his decision to take Parivraja.  
>  9. With great difficulty he extricated himself from the crowd and
> entered the gates of the Ashram.  
>  10. Siddharth did not like \[=wish\] Suddhodana and Prajapati
> Gautami to be present to witness his Parivraja. For he knew that they
> would break down under the weight of grief. But they had already
> reached the Ashram without letting him know.  
>  11. As he entered the compound of the Ashram, he saw in the crowd
> his father and mother.  
>  12. Seeing his parents he first went to them and asked for their
> blessing. They were so choked with emotion that they could hardly say
> a word. They wept and wept, held him fast, and bathed him with their
> tears.  
>  13. Channa had tied Kanthaka to a tree in the Ashram and was
> standing \[by\]. Seeing Suddhodana and Prajapati in tears, he too was
> overcome with emotion and was weeping.  
>  14. Separating himself with great difficulty from his parents,
> Siddharth went to the place where Channa was standing. He gave him his
> dress and his ornaments to take back home.  
>  15. Then he had his head shaved, as was required for a
> Parivrajaka. His cousin Mahanama had brought the clothes appropriate
> for a Parivrajaka, and a begging bowl. Siddharth wore them \[=put them
> on\].  
>  16. Having thus prepared himself to enter the life of a
> Parivrajaka, Siddharth approached Bharadwaja \[with a request\] to
> confer on him Parivraja.  
>  17. Bharadwaja, with the help of his disciples, performed the
> necessary ceremonies, and declared Siddharth Gautama to have become a
> Parivrajaka.  
>  18. Remembering that he had given a double pledge to the Sakya
> Sangh, to take Parivraja and to leave the Sakya kingdom without undue
> delay, Siddharth Gautama immediately, on the completion of the
> Parivraja ceremony, started on his journey.  
>  19. The crowd which had collected in the Ashram was unusually
> large. That was because the circumstances leading to Gautama's
> Parivraja were so extraordinary. As the prince stepped out of the
> Ashram, the crowd also followed him.  
>  20. He left Kapilavatsu and proceeded in the direction of the
> river Anoma. Looking back ,he saw the crowd still following him.  
>  21. He stopped and addressed them, saying, "Brothers and sisters,
> there is no use your following me. I have failed to settle the dispute
> between the Sakyas arid the Koliyas. But if you create public opinion
> in favour of settlement you might succeed. Be, therefore, so good as
> to return." Hearing his appeal, the crowd started going back.  
>  22. Suddhodana and Gautami also returned to the palace.  
>  23. Gautami was unable to bear the sight of the robes and the
> ornaments discarded by Siddharth. She had them thrown into a lotus
> pool.  
>  24. Siddharth Gautama was only twenty-nine when he underwent
> Parivraja (Renunciation).  
>  25. People admired him and sighed for him; saying, "Here was a
> Sakya blessed with high lineage, noble parentage, possessed of
> considerable riches, in the bloom of youthful vigour, accomplished in
> mind and body, brought up in luxury, who fought his kinsmen for the
> sake of maintaining peace on earth and goodwill towards men.  
>  26. "Here was a Sakya youth who, when outvoted by his kinsmen,
> refused to submit, but preferred to undergo voluntary punishment which
> involved the exchange of riches for poverty, comfort for alms, home
> for homelessness. And so he goes, with none in the world to care for
> him, and with nothing in the world which he could claim as his own.  
>  27. "His was an act of supreme sacrifice willingly made. His is a
> brave and a courageous act. There is no parallel to it in the history
> of the world. He deserves to be called a Sakya Muni or Sakya Sinha."  
>  28. How true were the words of Kisa Gotami, a Sakya maiden. When
> referring to Siddharth Gautama, she said, "Blessed indeed is the
> mother, blessed indeed is the father, who has such a son. Blessed
> indeed is the wife who has such a husband."
>
>   
> § 19. The Prince and the Servant
>
>  1. Channa too should have gone back home with Kanthaka. But he
> refused to go. He insisted on seeing the Prince off with Kanthaka at
> least to the banks of the river Anoma, and so insistent was Channa
> that the Gautama had to yield to his wishes.  
>  2. At last they reached the banks of the river Anoma.  
>  3. Then turning to Channa he said, "Good friend, thy devotion to
> me has been proved by thy thus following me. I am wholly won in heart
> by thee, ye who have such a love for your master.  
>  4. "I am pleased with your noble feelings towards me, even though
> I am powerless of conferring \[=to confer\] any reward.  
>  5. "Who would not be favourably disposed to one who stands to him
> as bringing him reward? But even one's own people commonly become mere
> strangers in a reverse of fortune.  
>  6. "A son is brought up for the sake of the family; the father is
> honoured by the son for the sake of his own future support; the world
> shows kindness for the sake of hope; there is no such thing as
> unselfishness without a motive.  
>  7. "Thou art the only exception. Take now this horse and return.  
>  8. "The king, with his loving confidence still unshaken, must be
> enjoined to stay his grief.  
>  9. "Tell him, I have left him--with no thirst for heaven, with no
> lack of love, nor feeling of anger.  
>  10. "He should not think of mourning for me who am thus gone forth
> from my home; union, however long it may last, in time will come to an
> end.  
>  11. "Since separation is certain, how shall there not be repeated
> severings from one's kindred?  
>  12. "At a man's death there are doubtless heirs to his wealth, but
> heirs to his merit are hard to find on the earth, or exist not at
> all.  
>  13. "The king, my father, requires to be looked after. The king
> may say, 'He is gone at a wrong time.' But there is no wrong time for
> duty.  
>  14. "Do thou address the king, O friend, with these and suchlike
> words; and do thou use thy efforts so that he may not even remember
> me.  
>  15. "Yes, do thou repeat to my mother my utter unworthiness to
> deserve her affection. She is a noble person, too noble for words."  
>  16. Having heard these words, Channa, overwhelmed with grief, made
> reply with folded hands, his voice choked by emotion:  
>  17. "Seeing that ye are causing affliction to thy kindred, my
> mind, O my Lord, sinks down like an elephant in a river of mud.  
>  18. "To whom would not such a determination as this of thine,
> cause tears, even if his heart were of iron--how much more if it were
> throbbing with love?  
>  19. "Where is gone this delicacy of limb, fit to lie only in a
> palace, and where \[in comparison\] is the ground of the ascetic
> forest, covered with the shoots of rough Kusa grass?  
>  20. "How could I, O Prince, by mine own will, --knowing this thy
> decision,--carry back the horse to the sorrow of Kapilavatsu?  
>  21. "Surely thou will not abandon that fond old king, so devoted
> to his son, as a heretic might the true religion? .  
>  22. "And her, thy second mother, worn with the care of bringing
> thee up,--thou will not surely forget her, as an ingrate does a
> benefit?  
>  23. "Thou wilt not surely abandon thy wife endowed with all
> virtues, illustrious for her family, devoted to her husband and with a
> young son.  
>  24. "Thou wilt not abandon the young son of Yeshodhara, worthy of
> all praise, thou the best of the cherishers of religion and fame, as a
> dissolute spendthrift his choicest glory?  
>  25. "Or even if thy mind be resolved to abandon thy kindred and
> thy kingdom, thou will not, O Master, abandon me,--thy feet are my
> only refuge.  
>  26. "I cannot go to the city with my soul thus burning, leaving
> thee behind in the forest.  
>  27. "What will the king say to me, returning to the city without
> thee, or what shall I say to thy wife by way of telling them good
> news?  
>  28. "As for what thou sayest, thou must repeat my unworthiness to
> the king', who could think or believe it?" continued Channa. "Even if
> I ventured to speak it, with a heart ashamed and a tongue cleaving to
> my mouth, he may not appreciate it.  
>  29. "Him who is always compassionate and who never fails to feel
> pity, it ill befits to abandon one who loves; turn back and have mercy
> on me."  
>  30. Having heard these words of Channa overcome with sorrow,
> Siddharth Gautama with the utmost gentleness answered:  
>  31. "Abandon this distress ,Channa, regarding thy separation from
> me,--change is inevitable in corporeal beings who are subject to
> different births.  
>  32. "Even. if I, through affection, were not to abandon my
> kindred, death would still make us helplessly abandon one another.  
>  33. "She, my mother, by whom I was born in the womb with great
> thirst and pains,--where am I now with regard to her, and where is she
> with regard to me?  
>  34. "As birds go to their roosting-tree and then depart, so the
> meeting of beings inevitably ends in separation.  
>  35. "As clouds, having come together, depart asunder again, such I
> consider the meeting and parting of living things.  
>  36. "And since this world goes away, each one deceiving the
> other,--it is not right to think anything thine own in a time of union
> which is a dread.  
>  37. "Therefore, since it is so, grieve not, my good friend, but
> go; or if thy love lingers, then go and afterwards return.  
>  38. "Say without reproaching me, to the people of Kapilavatsu,
> 'Let your love for him be given up, and hear his resolve.'"  
>  39. Having heard this conversation between the master and the
> servant, Kanthaka, the noblest steed, licked his \[=Gautam's\] feet
> with his tongue and dropped hot tears.  
>  40. With his hand whose fingers were untied \[=not joined\] with a
> membrane, and which was marked with the auspicious *svastika*, and
> with its middle part curved, Gautama stroked him and addressed him
> like a friend:  
>  41. "Shed not tears, Kanthaka, bear with it, thy labours will soon
> have its \[=their\] fruit."  
>  42. Then Channa, knowing that the time for the parting of the ways
> had come, forthwith paid honour to the sylvan dress of Gautama.  
>  43. Then Gautama, having bidden good-bye to Kanthaka and Channa,
> went on his way.  
>  44. While his master, thus regardless of his kingdom, was going to
> the ascetic-wood in mean garments, the groom, tossing up his arms,
> wailed bitterly and fell on the ground.  
>  45. Having looked back again he wept aloud, and embraced the horse
> Kanthaka with his arms; and then, hopeless and repeatedly lamenting,
> started on his return journey.  
>  46. On the way, sometimes he pondered, sometimes he lamented,
> sometimes he stumbled, and sometimes he fell; and so going along,
> wretched through his devoted attachment, he performed all kinds of
> actions on the road, knowing not what he was doing.
>
>   
> §20. The Return of Channa
>
>  1. Then Channa, in deep distress, when his master thus went into
> the forest, made every effort on the road to dissolve his load of
> sorrow.  
>  2. His heart was so heavy that the road which he used to traverse
> in one night with Kanthaka, that same road he now took eight days to
> travel, pondering over his lord's absence.  
>  3. The horse Kanthaka, though he still went on bravely, fagged and
> had lost all spirit; and decked though he was with ornaments, he in
> the absence of his master seemed to have lost all his beauty.  
>  4. And turning round towards the direction in which his master
> went, he neighed repeatedly with a mournful sound; and though pressed
> with hunger, he welcomed not, nor tasted, any grass or water on the
> road, as before.  
>  5. Slowly the two at long last reached Kapila-vatsu, which seemed
> empty when deserted by Gautama. They reached the city in body but not
> in soul.  
>  6. Bright as it was with lotus-covered waters, adorned with trees
> full of flowers, the citizens had lost all their gladness.  
>  7. When the two, their brightness gone and their eyes dim with
> tears, slowly entered the city, it seemed all bathed in gloom.  
>  8. Having heard that they had returned with their limbs all
> relaxed, coming back without the pride of the Sakya race, the men of
> the city shed tears.  
>  9. Full of wrath, the people followed Channa in the road, crying
> behind him with tears, "Where is the king's son, the glory of his race
> and his kingdom?"  
>  10. "This city bereft of him is a forest, and that forest which
> possesses him is a city; the city without him has no charms for us."  
>  11. Next the women crowded to the rows of windows, crying to one
> another, "The prince has returned"; but having seen that his horse had
> an empty back, they closed the windows again and wailed aloud.
>
>   
> §21 The Family in Mourning
>
>  1. The members of the family of Suddhodana were anxiously awaiting
> the return of Channa, in the hope that he might persuade Gautama to
> return home.  
>  2. On entering the royal stable, Kanthaka uttered a loud sound,
> uttering his woe to the palace people.  
>  3. Then the people who were in the neighbourhood of the king's
> inner apartments, thought in their hearts, "Since the horse Kanthaka
> neighs, it must be that the prince has come."  
>  4. And the women who were fainting with sorrow, now in wild joy,
> with their eyes rolling to see the prince, rushed out of the palace
> full of hope. But they were disappointed. There was Kanthaka without
> the prince.  
>  5. Gautami, abandoning all self-control, cried aloud--she fainted,
> and with a weeping face exclaimed:  
>  6. "With his long arms and lion gait, his bull-like eye, and his
> beauty, bright like gold, his broad chest, and his voice deep as a
> drum or a cloud,--should such a hero as this dwell in a hermitage?  
>  7. "This earth is indeed unworthy as regards that peerless doer of
> noble actions, for such a virtuous hero has gone away from us.  
>  8. "Those two feet of his, tender with their beautiful web spread
> between the toes, with their ankles, concealed and soft like a blue
> lotus,--how can they, bearing a wheel mark in the middle, walk on the
> hard ground of the skirts of the forest?  
>  9. "That body, which deserves to sit or lie on the roof of a
> palace, honoured with costly garments, aloes, and sandalwood, how will
> that manly body live in the woods, exposed to the attacks of the cold,
> the heat, and the rain?  
>  10. "He who was proud of his family, goodness, strength, energy,
> sacred learning, beauty, and youth, who was ever ready to give, not
> ask, how will he go about begging alms from others?  
>  11. "He who, lying on a spotless golden bed, was awakened during
> the night by the concert of musical instruments, how alas! will he, my
> ascetic, sleep today on the bare ground with only one rag of cloth
> interposed?"  
>  12. Having heard this piteous lamentation, the women, embracing
> one another with their arms, rained tears from their eyes, as the
> shaken creepers drop honey from their flowers.  
>  13. Then Yeshodhara, forgetting that she had permitted him to go,
> fell upon the ground in utter bewilderment.  
>  14. "How has he abandoned me. his lawful wife? He has left me
> widowed. He could have allowed his lawful wife to share his new life
> with him.  
>  15. "I have no longing for the heaven' my one desire was that my
> beloved may never leave me either in this world or the next.  
>  16. "Even if I am unworthy to look on my husband's face with its
> long eyes and bright smile, still is this poor Rahula never to roll
> about in his father's lap?  
>  17. "Alas! the mind of that wise hero is terribly stern, gentle as
> his beauty seems, it is pitilessly cruel. Who can desert of his own
> accord such an infant son with his inarticulate talk, one who would
> charm even an enemy?  
>  18. "My heart too is certainly most stern, yea, made of rock or
> fashioned even of iron, which does not break when its lord is gone to
> the forest, deserted by his royal glory like an orphan,--he so well
> worthy of happiness. But what can I do? My grief is too heavy for me
> to bear."  
>  19. So fainting in her woe, Yeshodhara wept and wept
> aloud--self-possessed though she was by nature, yet in her distress
> she had lost her fortitude.  
>  20. Seeing Yeshodhara thus bewildered with her wild utterances of
> grief, and fallen on the ground, all the women cried out, with their
> faces streaming with tears like large lotuses beaten by the rain.  
>  21. Having heard of the arrival of both Channa and Kanthaka, and
> having learned of the fixed resolve of his son, Suddhodana fell,
> struck down by sorrow.  
>  22. Distracted by his grief for his son, being held up for a
> moment by his attendants, Suddhodana gazed on the horse with his eyes
> filled with tears, and then falling on the ground wailed aloud.  
>  23. Then Suddhodana got up and entered his temple, offered
> prayers, performed auspicious rites, and vowed certain sacrifices for
> the safe return of his son.  
>  24. So Suddhodana, Gautami, and Yeshodhara passed their days
