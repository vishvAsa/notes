The more one looks at it from a zoomed-out vantage the more it seems that the reckoning alluded to [here](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2022/06/12/vikir%e1%b9%87a%e1%b8%a5-vi%e1%b9%a3aya%e1%b8%a5-india-and-the-rus/) will come like the swelling of the sindhu upon the H, perhaps within a decade. While the yuga chakra is always turning this could be the turn that crushes many an onlooker under it. 

- The last major war the H fought on their own behalf was the 1st war of independence in 1857 CE. At the same time, a Jihad was also being fought against the English. This thoroughly confused the H & those confusions persisted over the last ~165 years.+++(5)+++
- \~100 years back the confusion resurfaced over the matter of the lord of turuShkasthAna, the ChAyA of the ekarAkShasa on earth. The resulting irruption was only broken because the English were then the lords of the world & turuShkatva briefly challenged ekarAkShasatva. 

Imagine its replay from the very same nidus when you are not the lord of the world, only middling power & the mlechCha is aiding & abetting the marukarbura. Would it be closer to the replay from ~75-76 YBP? To paraphrase Goel, the H were not yet collectively brain-dead but going forward, like a Rag1-deleted man, the H could face 

- a million little eruptions from within; 
- the vice-like press of mlechCha allies of the marUnmatta; 
- the -ve externalities of the blind adoption of mlechCha economic/organizational/transportation models; 
- the corruption of the elite by navyonmada; 
- the falling human capital & numbers of the elites (?); 
- regionalistic chauvinism & the cost of pan-Indian identity(?); 
- urban concentrations of assets where the inimical forces would be dominant. 

The reckoning could turn out to be prachaNDogra for H civilization.
