Source: [TW]

In the Indian media we encounter the peculiar term "street veto". It is a good coinage. It is used effectively by both tR^ityonmatta-s & nayvonmatta-s. The former have been using it since they came into being while the latter more recently. It was most effectively used in mahAmlechCha-land in the uchchATana of the nAri~NgapuruSha. It is a strategy that would be used both in India & the occident going forward unless put down ruthlessly. In India, it will be aided & abetted by the mlechCha navyonmatta-s. In both places it will be provided full cover by the soraShaNDabejhAdi-backed MSM & the likes of mukhagiri, reNugiri, guggulu & talcum powder. This cover will be aimed at dampening/heading off counter-mobilization through electronic warfare & hiding the dahana & bha~njana used in the street veto.
