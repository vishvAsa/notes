I

The year 1946 opened with general elections to the
Provincial Legislatures all over India. Congressmen used the
same old tactics and reiterated the pledge of a United India.
On January 14, 1946, Sardar Patel thundered at Ahmedabad :
‘‘ Granting of Pakistan is not in the hands of the British Gov-
ernment. If Pakistan is to be achieved, Hindus and Muslims
will have to fight. There will be a civil war. The Congress
is no longer going to knock at the doors of the League. The
Congress has tried to settle with the League many times. But
it has been kicked every time.’’ Such masterpieces of the
Sardar, the steam-roller of the power and prestige of the party
that had ruled, and the press, purse and propaganda let loose
by the greatest political organization in India, overran the
Hindu Mahasabha candidates in elections. And the Hindu
Mahasabha was entirely thrown into the shade. The League
emerged as the authoritative mouthpiece of the Muslims and
the Congress of the Hindus alone.

In the meanwhile, anti-British feelings reached a climax.
A burst-up became inevitable. The I.N.A. trial gave rise to
it ; the Royal Indian Naval Ratings and the Royal Indian Air
Force raised the banner of revolt in Bombay, Calcutta and
Karachi. The backbone of the Imperial structure thus
seemed to break down. The army, too, was feeling and
experiencing the pangs of freedom.

The British Labour Party after coming into power sent a
delegation of ten members of the British Parliament to India.
The delegation had a four-week survey and talks with various
leaders of all parties. They had invited Savarkar to meet
them, but Savarkar was not then in Bombay. He was
convalescing at Walchandnagar, The Delegation returned to
England on February 10. On February 19 Lord Pethick
Lawrence, the Secretary of State for India, announced the



FROM PARITY TO PAKISTAN 343

intention of His Majesty’s Government to send out a delegation
of three Cabinet Members, Sir Stafford Cripps, Mr. A. V
Alexander and himself, to discuss with the Indian i>arty
leaders on the spot the question of solving the political dead-
lock in the country. On March 15 the British Prime Minister,
Mr. Attlee, declared India’s right to attain full independence
within or even without the British Commonwealth, if she so
desired and in respect of the minority problem of India he
said : “We cannot allow a minority to place their veto on the
advance of the majoriiy.” The British Cabinet Mission
subsequently arrived in ] >eihi on March 24. Numerous inter-
views, discussions and deliberations took place in the Viceregal
Lodge. On April 5 Pandit Nehru thundered : “ The Congress
is not going to agree to the Muslim League demand for
Pakistan under any circumstances whatever, even if the
Britiwsh Government agrees to it.” What history records is
quite the reverse ! Only a few days after this warUkc speech,
a whole nation witnessed that Nehru pathetically enough ate
his words in the end !

Another outstanding feature on the political scene was that
Mr. Jinnah represented the Muslims, Maulana Azad
represented the Hindus and the Nawab of Bhopal, the princely
India. Thus the whole of India was represented by Muslim
leaders ! Mr. Jinnah was re-affirming his anti-Indian role,
and refused to call himself an Indian even.

Jinnah’s lieutenants were not lagging behind. Before ihe
League Legislators’ Convention held in Delhi, Gandhiji’s
Shahid Sahib, Mr. H. S. Suhrawardy, declared on April 9,
in Hitleric vein that Pakistan was Muslims’ latest, but not
the last demand and if the Britishers entrusted the destiny of
India to Congress Junta, the Muslim League would not allow
the Central Government to function even for a day. Another
Muslim League leader, Sir Firoz Khan Noon, warned the
British Government that the destruction and havoc that the
Muslims would do in the country would put into the shade
what Chengizkhan had done.^

While the discussions and deliberations with the Cabinet
Mission were going on at Delhi, Savarkar returned to Poona

Dr. Pattabhai Sitaramayya) , pp. 21-22.



344 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

on April 3, from Walchandnagar slightly recovered from the
nervous exhaustion, and was convalescing at the Poona Hotel.
On January 20 he had a severe heart attack at Walchandnagar.
Sri Bhopatkar saw Savarkar in Poona before he put a
memorandum on the 15th of April before the Mission along
with Dr. Mookerjee on behalf of the Hindu Mahasabha. The
memorandum stated “ that geographically, politically and
culturally India was one whole and indivisible. This integrity
and indivisibility must be maintained whatever the cost and
sacrifice be.” The memorandum further warned the Mission
that partition of India into two or more sovereign States under
any guise or disguise would be economically unsound and
disastrous, politically unwise and suicidal.

Political scenes were changing with rapidity. A Tripartite
Conference consisting of the British ministers, the Viceroy,
representatives of the Congress and the League, was held at
Simla, on May 12, 1946, but it failed to arrive at any decision.
The Mission then came out with a new proposal now known
as the State Paper of May 16. Tliis document repudiated
Mr. Jinnah’s claim for division of India, contemplated a Central
Union although with powers restricted only to matters of
external affairs, defence and communications, gave full
autonomy to the provinces, and provided facihties for the
provinces to form themselves into three groups two of which,
B and C, were mischievously and evidently conceived as a
concession to the League Lord. A Constituent Assembly was
to be elected by the Provincial Legislatures for framing a
constitution for the Indian State ; an Interim Government
comprising representatives of the major communities and
important minorities was planned ; and the States, freed from
the crown paramountcy, were to join the Constituent
Assembly for hammering out a Union of the provinces and the
States. The electorate was divided into the General, Muslims
and Sikhs. Thus in the land of the Hindus, there was no
electorate named after them in the administration of India.

The League accepted the State Paper on May 22, hoping
to work out Pakistan through the proposed groups, and
Mr. Jinnah proposed to hold out his hand of co-operation to
the Congress. The Congress, too, accepted the Plan of May
16 as it stood, and declared its willingness to join the



FROM PARITY TO PAKISTAN 345

Constituent Assembly with a view to framing the constitution
of a free, united and democratic India.

Towards the end of June 1946, the Cabinet Mission returned
to London leaving it to Lord Wavell to work out the procedure
and form an Interim Government. On July 10 Pandit Nehru
told a press conference at Bombay that there would be finally
no grouping as the Congress held that the provinces should
be considered free at the initial stage to opt out of the section
or group in which they were placed. This unstatesmanly
statement of Pandit Nehi t, gave a handle to Mr. Jinnah to
push his demands, and ou J’Jy 27, 1946, the League Council
resolved at its meeting in Bombay to resort to Direct Action,
rejecting the Cabinet Mission proposal which it had previously
accepted ! Mr. Jinnah refused to discuss the ethics of violence
and non-violence and the League Secretary declared their
determination to employ every means in their power to
achieve their object. The Sind minister preached destruction
and extermination of every one who opposed them.^ There-
upon the Congress nervously ran to patch up this gulf, and
reasserted acceptance of the State Paper fully ! On August
24 the Viceroy declared his resolve to form an Interim
Government of sixteen Members out of which six were to be
the nominees of the Congress, five of the League and five
representatives of the minorities. The Congress took office on
September 2, 1946, gave one out of its six seats to the
Depres.sed Classes and one more to a Muslim thus reducing
mercilessly the national majority to a minority in the Cabinet,
and all this when the Muslim League did not even co-operate
in the formation of the Interim Government.


The acceptance of office by the Congress put Jinnah in a
trap. Jinnah rightly believed that the Congress under its
historic leadership of Gandhiji and Nehru would be nervous
about the formation of an All-India Government without the
co-operation of the Muslims ! Two Muslims were appointed
temporarily and one of them was almost stabbed to death at
Simla, and he ultimately succumbed. To make the functioning

^ The Times of India, Bombay, dated 29-7-1946.



346 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

of the Interim Government led by the Congress impossible,
the Muslim League started its Direct Action on August 16,
which led to an unprecedented holocaust in Calcutta, well-
known now as the great killing, spreading the virus and
holocaust over the Noakhali District in Eastern Bengal and
followed by looting, kidnapping, forced mass conversions, forced
marriages, arson and mass murders of the Hindus in villages
and towns in the Eastern Districts of Bengal. Acharya J, B.
Kripalani, the then President-elect of the Meerut Session of the
Congress, toured those affected parts of Bengal, saw those
places of inhuman atrocities and mass murders, and declared
in a shuddering voice that they were planned and pre-organ-
ized by the Muslims. “ War was not like this,” wrote a military
officer in the Statesman, Calcutta. The Congress leaders in
power proved utterly unequal to the task of putting down the
organized fanaticism of the Muslims. British imperialism
had physically disarmed the Hindus, Gandhism had enfeebled
them mentally, and the curfew Raj had done the rest for them.
Amidst such a confusion and chaos Jinnah shrewdly pushed
his lieutenants into the Interim Government without even
raising liis usual objection to the inclusion of the Congress
Muslim in the Interim Government and the fight for Pakistan
thus began with renewed force and fire to sabotage the
Mission Plan which aimed at setting up an All-India centre,
which the Muslim League detested. With a view to dealing
a fatal blow at the Plan, the Muslim League leaders including
those in the Interim Government spoke and wrote in fire and
all this under the very eyes of Pandit Nehru and the Home
Member, Sardar Patel ! Mr. Ghaznafar Ali Khan, the Health
Minister in the Viceroy’s Interim Government, speaking at
Lahore, said, “ If Mohammad Bin Kasim and Muhammad of
Ghazni could invade India with armies composed of a few
thousands, and yet were able to overpower lakhs of Hindus,
God willing, a few lakhs of Muslims will yet overwhelm crores
of Hindus.” ^ On another occasion he asked the Hindus to
embrace Islam and to save themselves from the holocaust.
And yet this communalist upstart was allowed to continue in
the Interim Government. Echoes of the terrific tragedies in
Bengal were on the lips of even the dying Pandit Madan

Mohan Maiaviya at Benares. Moved by the multitudes of
Hindu refugees, deprived of their homes, wives, children and
everythiiig i)i Bengal, the feelings of the Hindus ran high in
every province. In Bihar, the Land of the Guptas, furious riots
followed on a terrific scale, so much so that Mr. Jinnah
bewailed that retaliation for Bihar would be a catastrophe.
Dr. Moonje warned the Hindus at a meeting in Kurukshetra
that the Hindus were facing a civil war.

Lord Wavel], the Commander-in-Chief and Pandit Nehru
flew to the scene in Biha Sardar Patel resorted to drastic
action, Nehru threatened .he Bihar Hindus with bullets and
aerial bombardment, the poh se opened fire on several occasions
and all the Government forces suppressed ruthlessly the
uprising in Bihar. Gandhiji went one stop further. He
tlireatened the Bihar Hindus with a fast. Nehru said that if
the Bihar Hindus wanted to kill the Muslims, they should
first kill him. There was wide discontent among the Hindus
at the well-meant but incompatible attitude of the Congress
leaders who helplessly witnessed and heard about the mas-
sacres of the Hindus in Bengal. Even Congress-minded
papers resented this attitude. The Yashoda in its weekly
issue (Vol. VI, No. 4, 78 Gandhian era) observed in its
editorial: “If Nehru’s body must fall, it must fall at
Noakhali. If Gandhiji is to fast, he should fast in Noakhali.
The dark figures of the great tragedy enacted at Noakhali
must be brought to justice.” The paper further observed in
its News and Notes that Noakhali bled, and nobody went
near the place till there was no more to bleed. And then the
Viceroy and other dignitaries conducted post-mortem exami-
nations and gave their verdicts so obviously devoid of truth
that they could deceive nobody. The Weekly added in its
last article : “ But the role of Gandhiji throughout is as
untenable as it is incredulous. Till the communal flare in
Bihar, he was passive. Only to Bihar he issues his clarion
call for repentance and good behaviour on penalty of his
penance to slow death.” The Weekly concludes : “ No other
explanation can be offered for his guilty inactivity over the
East Bengal affair.”

All this account is narrated only as a matter of history. The
author is not out to justify, nor is it needed to do so, the



348 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

attacks made by the Hindus in Bihar on other religionists.
However, he cannot but feel the unbelievable passive attitude
on the part of the Congress leaders in power towards the
atrocities committed by the Muslims elsewhere for the same
reason ; for violence, whenever, wherever and howsoever
it occurs, must be condemned. That violence which provokes
the subsequent violence must be curbed and condemned first.
And without doubt Congress leaders lamentably failed in this
sacred duty. If the forces of justice and humanity are real
and potent in your breast, you cannot remain a passive
spectator at one time and an active defender at another.

Savarkar returned to Bombay on August 5, 1946. By now
Hindu-Muslim riots had become a common affair in Bombay.
The Hindu Sanghatanists were still valiantly defending the
hearths and homes from the organized mass fury of the un-
declared civil war by the Muslims in Bengal, Bihar, Bombay
and the Punjab. Sri Rajendra Roy Chaudhari, President of
the Noakhali District Hindu Sabha, died heroically in defence
of Hindu homes and Hindu honour. Hindu Sabhas all over
India arranged for the relief of the Noakhali Hindu sufferers
with the active aid of the perennial, patriotic and pan-Hindu
sympathies of the Hindu leaders like Raja Narayanlal
Bansilal, Bombay.

Soon after the Muslim League’s joining the Interim Govern-
ment, a first class crisis developed. After their entry into the
Interim Government, the Leaguers refused to join the Consti-
tuent Assembly.

Sardar Patel got indignant and drove Pandit Nehru to the
Viceroy. The Viceroy, who had, to quote the words of the
Times of India, Bombay, made untiring efforts to get justice
and ‘ even more than justice for the League,’ was charged
with conspiring with the League. Patel had also thundered
at the Meerut Session of the Congress that either the League
must join the Constituent Assembly or get out of the Interim
Government. There seemed no way out. So the British
Government invited Mr. Jinnah and Nehru to London for a
Conference for the solution of the legal points arisen out of the
interpretations put by the contending parties. Accordingly
Mr. Jinnah and Pandit Nehru flew to London. There with his
le^al acumen Mr. Jinnah carried the day and the vociferous



FROM PARITY TO PAKISTAN 349

Pandit Nehru failed. This perturbed Sardar Patel and
he thundered that the Congress would not accept the British
Government’s statement of December 6. But the All-India
Congress Committee in its Session on January 15, 1947, swal-
lowed that bitter pill too when Sardar Patel remained absent.
Now the decision given by the British Government threatened
the legal existence of the Constituent Assembly. It meant
that the constitution could not be valid unless it was approved
by the Muslim League !

In the meantime, the hindu Mahasabha Session was held
in the last week of December 1946, at Gorakhpur, under the
presidentship of Sri L. B. Bhopatkar. The Hindu Mahasabha
reiterated its demand for a Sovereign Independent State and
its faith in the indivisibility and integrity of India. In
December 1946, the Constituent Assembly opened its Session
and Dr. Jayakar was heckled for his conciliatory attitude
towards the League by those very Congressmen whose history
was full of national surrenders and who within a few months
of getting into power betrayed the nation’s integrity. No less
a personality than Dr. Ambedkar vigorously castigated the
Congress leaders in the Constituent Assembly ‘for killing a
strong Centre themselves.’ The misunderstanding of the
political issue, and the indecisive, short-sighted and vacillating
policy on the part of the Congress leaders dismayed the political
firmament.

In the midst of such a gloomy, grave and despairing
situation came the realization of the correctness of the fear-
less, far-sighted and unbending lead that had been given by
Savarkar. Dr. S. P. Mookerjee in his letter of February 10,
1947, wrote to Savarkar : “ If the Hindus had only listened
to your call, they would not have remained as slaves in the
land of their birth.” The confusion and the prevailing chaos
had begun to trouble the mind of Savarkar. He gave a sigh
of relief at the Pan-Hindu consciousness as regards self-
respect which the land of the Guptas had shown and he, there-
fore, sent a donation to the Bihar Provincial Hindu Sabha
‘ for the relief of the heroic Hindu sufferers of Bihar.’

*1110 British Cabinet was now fast txirning the pages of
history. In February 1947, the British Government announced
their intention to take necessary steps to effect the transfer



350 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

of Power to responsible Indian hands by a date not later than
June 1948. The termination of Lord Wavell’s wartime
appointment and the appointment of Viscount Mountbatten as
his successor were also announced simultaneously. The
defeated forces of Akhand Hindusthan were now striving
valiantly to rally again. In the first week of the following
month, Savarkar blessed the Hindu-Sikh unity sponsored by
Master Tara Singh in his forlorn attempts for maintaining the
integrity of India, and expressed the hope that “Guru
Govindsingh would steel the hearts of the Hindu-Sikh
brotherhood and strengthen the hands in fighting for the
freedom and the integrity of India.”

The undeclared Muslim uncivil war that disgraced the
Indian brotherhood, nationhood and motherhood was still
raging on. The big guns of the Congress had lost control over
the situation. The Home Member, Sardar Patel, true to his
soldierly frankness described the grave situation when he
said that almost every Muslim servant in the Govermnent was
Pakistani. His advice in a helpless mood was that everybody
should be a policeman and protect himself.

By this time the demand for a separate Province of West
Bengal was being hotly discussed and debated in Bengal. The
partition of Bengal, which was ruthlessly condemned forty
years ago, was demanded now by the kith and kin of
Khudiram Bose. What a queer fate ! On March 22, 1947, in
a statement Savarkar “ supported the demand for a separate
Hindu Majority Province in West Bengal owing loyal alle-
giance to a consolidated, strong and sovereign Central Hindu-
sthan State.”

As declared by the British Government, Lord Wavell made
his exit from India towards the end of March 1947. The New
Viceroy came in. Savarkar wired to the new Viceroy, Lord
Mountbatten, urging him to consult the Mahasabha President
and Master Tara Singh before any fundamental changes
affecting the Hindus were effected. Savarkar knew that India
was fast approaching a momentous decision. He, therefore,
urged the Bengal Hindu Sabha and the Bengal Hindus on
April 4, 1947, to demand a separate new Hindu Province in
West Bengal and to expel the Muslim trespassers from Assam
at any cost. He also demanded that the contiguous Hindu



FROM PARITY TO PAKISTAN 351

Majority Districts of Sind should be joined to the Bombay
Province. Savarkar concluded his statement by saying that
the Murlim minority would be given the same kind of treat-
ment as would be meted out to the Hindu minorities in the
Muslim majority provinces.^

Savarkar feared that Assam which was tagged on to the
Eastern Group of Pakistan would fall a victim to Muslim
aggression. Assam was threatened by the Muslim Direct
Action on the one hand and the Muslim influx into the
provin^'e on the other. S . he again warned towards the end
of April 1947, Sri BardoL u ihe Prime Minister of Assam, and
Sri Vishnudas, the Revenue Minister, not to surrender an
inch to the Muslims and asked the ministers to eject every
Muslim trespasser old and new to a man. Both of them duly
acknowledged the telegrams and with due assurance. In the
same month Savarkar asked the Bengal Hindus ‘ to beware
of Gandhiji’s scheming platitudes avowing open hostility to
the demand for framing Hindu majority Provinces in the East
and West of India.’ The new Viceroy interviewed the leaders
of the Congress and the League and flew to London in May
1947. On the eve of liis departure Dr. Mookerjee had put his
      demand for a separate Hindu Province in the West of Bengal.
      The British Cabinet approved the blueprint of the Viceroy
      and the swift procedure for its execution.

Now the final decision was reached. Savarkar knew that
the last moment to be or not to be had come. On May 29,
1947, in a fervent and forlorn appeal to the Congressites
Savarkar urged them not to betray the electorates and India
by agreeing to a scheme involving vivisection of the Mother-
land. He reminded them that they had not been elected to
the legislatures on the issue of partition and their Constituent
Assembly had also no right ah initio even to consider such a
proposal. Hence he urged upon them to resign their seats
and posts and to seek re-election on the clear-cut issue of
Pakistan or Akhand Hindusthan, if they were for the parti-
tion of India. Savarkar further suggested to the Congress
leaders that they might demand a plebiscite to decide such a
momentous issue involving the life and death of the nation
and the destiny of future generations. But who was there

352 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

in his senses in the Congress to consider such a proposal in
a democratic way when the wordy Congress democrats were
reeling in the drunken joy of party and personal power ?
What other country has witnessed such a betrayal ?

Th e Congress leaders were now in a mood of speedy sur-
rendering. Speaking at the U. P. Political Conference, Pandit
Nehru declared on April 29, 1947 : “ The Muslim League can
have Pakistan if they wish to have it.” Sardar Patel said on
April 14, 1947, in Bombay ; “ If India should be partitioned,
it could only be done after mutual discussion amongst our-
selves and in a peaceful manner.” Dr. Rajendra Prasad
showed anxiety for the division of the defence forces. The
Congress leaders spoke and acted as if the integrity and
indivisibility of Hindusthan was a matter of the past with
them ! So now Unity and Integrity of India was the concern
of Savarkar alone !

The Viceroy soon returned with the sanction of the British
Cabinet for his proposal and on June 3, 1947, the Prime
Minister of Britain from London and the Viceroy from Delhi
announced simultaneously their new plan known as the
June 3rd Plan. The New Plan contemplated the creation of
one or two Dominions by August 15, 1947, provision for
separate Constituent Assemblies, partition of the Punjab a nd
Bengal provinces, referendum for Baluchistan, the North-
West Frontier Province and the Sylhet district of Assam to
decide what dominion they would join.

Savarkar was now fighting a lost cause. But as he was the
truest son of India, he tried to tap every corner, every source,
every means to avert the political matricide. The Working
Committee of the Hindu Mahasabha met at Delhi on the 7th
and 8th June 1947. Savarkar sent a message to President
Bhopatkar on June 8, saying that the Hindu Sabhaites and the
Sanghatanists could never willingly sign the death-warrant
of the integrity of Hindusthan and urged Bhopatkar to
continue the struggle for re-annexing the revolting Moslem
provinces and for creating Hindu majority provinces in any
case — ^Pakistan or no Pakistan — ^in Bengal and the Punjab, and
for rejoining the contiguous Hindu majority Districts of Sind
to the Bombay Province. In the interests of Akhand Hindu-
sthan the Congressites, he said, should be called upon to resign



FROM PARITY TO PAKISTAN 353

their mini %tries and posts and seek re-elections forthwith
on the issue of Pakistan, but they should not be allowed
to concede Pakistan and to betray the electorates. He also
urged the Sind Hindus and other minority communities in
Sind to press on with all possible means for the separation of
Hindu majority Districts in Sind and for the re-annexation of
those districts to the Hindusthan Union.^

The Working Committee of the Hindu Mahasabha also
reiterated its belief : “ India is one and indivisible and there
will nearer be peace unles>; and until the separated areas are
brought back into the Inuiau Union and made integral parts
thereof.” The Mahasabha Working Committee further
demanded a referendum in the Hindu majority areas in Sind
and in the Chittagong Hill tribes area in East Bengal
like the one in the Sylhet District in Assam to allow the
territories, if the majority in those respective areas desired,
to accede to the Indian Union.

The Congress leaders were now well prepared for their final
consent to the onslaught on the unity of India. In a written
message read oui> after the usual daily prayer-meeting in
Delhi, Gandhiji declared on June 9, 1947, that he was not
opposing the Congress acceptance of the new British Plan.
Nobody wondered at this news. This was a foregone conclu-
sion ! And the All-India Congress Committee in its Delhi
Session on June 14, 1947, accepted the 3rd June Plan by a
resolution supported by Pandit Nehru, the idol of the nation,
who had unequivocally professed and declared in the vein of
Lincoln to defend the integrity of India. This resolution was
upheld by the nationalist Muslim, Maulana Azad, now sup-
porting with divine satisfaction the creation of a Communalist
State out of India. Azad described the Plan as the only way
to settle India’s problem as the Congress was committed, he
recalled, to the principle of self-determination and was against
coercing any unwilling areas to join the Union ! But who
got the Congress committed to that resolution ? History
would record that all these Congress brand nationalist leaders
were at one in coercing other people in accepting Pakistan.

The Socialists in the All-India Congress Committee
remained neutral. They had no opinion to offer on such a

^ Free Hindusthan, Bombay, dated 8-6-1947.


23



354 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

vital issue in the life of the nation ! The lonely opponent in
the All-India Congress Committee opposing this nefarious
black decision and deed was Babu Purushottamdas Tandon
who appealed to the All-India Congress Committee that
though the Congress Working Committee had failed them, yet
the A.I.C.C. had the strength of millions behind them and
they must reject the resolution the acceptance of which would
be, he said, an abject surrender to the British and to the
Muslim League. Sardar Patel’s support to the partition of
India was a complete transfer scene from sword to surrender.

Gandhiji put an ultimatum before the A.I.C.C. He
threatened them either to accept the resolution conceding
Pakistan or to replace the old tried Congress leaders. He
advised them to accept the Plan and added that it was their
duty to stand by their leaders. To the Congress leaders their
prestige was more important than the destinies of the nation
and the fate of the millions ! That has been an unfortunate
characteristic of the Congress leadership. Savarkar repeatedly
exposed this fact and warned the people to remember that
the Congress party and their leaders were not greater than
the nation. Equally forcibly Dr. Ambedkar told the Congress
bosses in the Constituent Assembly that in deciding the
destinies of a people, the dignity of the leaders or men or
parties ought to count for nothing.

But Gandhiji threw his whole weight and the A.I.C.C.
accepted the resolution which accepted the creation of
Pakistan ! ^ And lo ! Gandhiji practised what he preached.
Did he not tell the nation ten years ago “ Needless to say, the
Congress can never seek the assistance of British forces to
resist the vivisection. It is the Muslims who will impose their
will by force, singly or with British assistance, on an unresist-
ing India. If I can carry the Congress with me, I would not
put the Muslims to the trouble of using force. I would be
ruled by them, for it would be still Indian rule.”

Gandhiji was a truth-seeker. Who is a truth-seeker ? One
who clings to truth and right even if the very heavens fall.
But Gandhiji, the voice of truth and the voice of non-violence,
who considered even coercing or forcing one’s views on others

1 Full report of the A.I.C.C. meeting in The Times of India, Bombay,
dated 16-6-1947.



FROM PARITY TO PAKISTAN 355

a sin, hit the last nail on the coffin of Akhand Hindusthan and
the resolution was passed. According to Gandhiji, Pakistan
was an untruth and the truth-seeker became a party to un-
truth in broad daylight. To Gandhiji Pakistan was a denial
of God, but he deserted and denied God. The fundamental
rights of the people, the demand for a nation-wide plebiscite,
the call and voice of democracy were stifled to death by the
unrelenting divine dictatorship. And describing this event
next day, the Free Press Journal^ Bombay, one of the chief
spokesiiien of the Congres s, flashed in a full banner line the
news ‘ Nation’s Leaders Betray Country’s Cause ! ’ This was
the return gift of the Indian National Congress to the Mother-
land which had suckled it at her breast !

There were two men in India who could have smashed the
proposed scheme of the vivisection of India. They were
Gandhiji and Savarkar. But because of shattered health, a
cruel misfortune, the perfidy and levity of those countrymen
who regarded party above country, Savarkar failed despite
his superhuman efforts for a period of ten years. With the
greatest party at his beck and call, Gandhiji could have blown
up the scheme of Pakistan had he meant it from the bottom
of his heart. Gandhiji believed that nothing was impossible
for a Satyagrahi. He, therefore, could have easily declared
wdth Luther that ‘ peace if possible, but truth at any rate.’
But the unfortunate politician in Gandhiji, who always failed
and failed, got the upper hand and stifled the truth-seeker in
Gandhiji, and Gandhiji too failed. On the one hand Gandhiji
proved the maxim of Voltaire who said ‘ he who seeks truth
should be of no country ’ and on the other, he fulfilled the
prophecy of his Guru, Gokhale, who foretold that Gandhiji
would exercise enormous influence on the common man, but
when the history of political parleys would be written dis-
interestedly, he would go down in history as a great failure.^
Yet the shriek of Akhand Hindusthan was not extinct. At
the behest of the Working Committee of the Hindu Maha-
sabha an All-India anti-Pakistan Day was observed on July 3.
1947, to register a protest against the vivisection of the
Motherland. There was a considerable response throughout
India. Big cities like Bombay, Poona, Delhi and others almost

SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

suspended all market and business activities. Prabhat ferries
were taken out, protest meetings were held condemning fhe
vivisection of India, black Hags were hoisted denouncing the
partition as a betrayal of the aspirations of the great patriots
and great martyrs who had laid their lives at the altar of a
great cause. On August 2, 1947, Savarkar made a very pathetic
and appealing speech before a mammoth meeting at Poona.
He told the vast multitude of audience that in a way they
were also partly responsible for the vivisection of their
Motherland along with the Congress leaders ; because they
did not repudiate their leadership at the proper time, and
added that appeasement would never stop and satisfy the
aggressor. He recalled how the Congress lead sacrificed
democracy and nationalism for communalism. He began this
appealing speech in a very touching tone and said ; “ Since
you have gathered in thousands to hear a leader like me who
has attained ill-fame owing to my deathless resistance to the
creation of Pakistan, I believe, there is yet hope, for the
survival of this Hindu nation.”

Savarkar now accepted the defeat of the forces of Akhand
Hindusthan. The battle was lost, but the war for United
India was still to continue and Savarkar stood up for it ! He
thought it proper to record once again his protest against the
vivisection of India. So a Hindu Convention was held on
Augu.st 8, 1947, at Delhi. Savarkar went to Delhi by air.
This was his first air flight. Dr. N. B. Khare, the then Premier
of Alwar, was to preside over it and the Maharaja of Alwar,
a staunch Hindu and self-respecting ruler was to inaugurate
it. But owing to the treacherous revolt of the Meos in the
Alwar State for a Meostan, both of them could not come to
Delhi and so Savarkar presided over the Convention.

In his Presidential Address to the Convention Savarkar
exhorted the Hindus never to accept Pakistan just as they
never accepted the British Raj and asked them to continue
their struggle for Akhand Hindusthan. Savarkar warned the
Hindus that if they did not rise and awake to the real danger
ahead, there would be many more Pakistans hereafter. Indeed
he must have had before his mind’s eye some four crores of
Muslims still remaining in Hindusthan who rioted, agitated
and were responsible for the demand for vivisection of Hindu-

sthan in no small measure ! Savarkar further declared that
there sh mid be no rejoicings on the 15th of August 1947, since
the Motherland would be actually torn asunder on that day
and the results of the disintegration were likely to lead to
bitter feelings and ill-will.

The Working Committee of the Hindu Mahasabha thereafter
exhorted the Hindus not to celebrate the 15th of August 1947,
as Independence Day, in view of the untold sufferings that
had been inflicted on mi'^'ons of people in different parts of
the country by the orgy blunder, murder and conversion,
and the indiscreet arrests and detention of leaders and
workers amongst the Hindus in all parts of the country.

One point respecting the Herculean opposition Savarkar
sponsored to the creation of Pakistan needs to be noted. It
was the Hindu Mahasabha led by Savarkar that alone strove
to avert the vivisection of Hindusthan. Let it be recorded
that the Socialist party which then functioned in the Congress
kept a culpable silence at the time of such a historical, momen-
tous issue in the life of the nation and remained neutral in
the A.I.C.C. when the Congress passed the resolution conced-
ing the vivisection of India. The Ary a Samajists and the
R.S.S. remained mere passive spectatoi-s and refused co-
operation, official or otherwise, even in peaceful demon-
strations against the vivisection of the Motherland, as if
nothing had happened in the life of the nation to which they
pledged their blood, brains and bones morning, noon
and night !


Ill

The 15th of August 1947 came, and was celebrated by the
Congress! tes as a day of national rejoicing. And no doubt it
was a great day in the history of the world as it saw the birth
of the biggest Muslim Slate under the sun and as a great force
was released in Asia in the form of Indian Independence. The
Mahasabhaites hoisted only the Mahasabha Geruwa flag with
the Kripan and Kundalini to display the asserting will of the
Hindus. Savarkar hoisted the new tricolour flag of Free India
with the Dharma Chakra of Buddhism as well as the Geruwa



358 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

flag with Kripan and Kundalini ; one State Flag and iho nfher
a Symbol of Akhand Hindusthan.

Great must have been his exultation at the disappau^inre
of the Union Jack and the discomfiture of the Khadi
with its Charkha and the coming up of the nationnl Jiatr,
Through Savarkar, the Prince of the Indian revolutionaries,
thousands of martyrs must have saluted the Flag of Indian
Independence for which they had laid their Jives. In saluting
and flying the State Flag Savarkar showed his sense of and
love for democracy. To his perturbed followers he said tha.t
they should hoist the Bhagwa flag with the Kripan and
Kundalini as the State flag only after they could get it
approved by the whole nation in a democratic way. Till then
this new State Flag represented the Divided India and the
Geruwa flag with the Kripan and Kundalini the Akhand
Hindusthan and so he had hoisted both.

It may be remembered that Gandhiji did not approve the
State Flag of Free India adopted by the Constituent Assem-
bly ; for the Dharma-Chakra had replaced his pet Charkha
and the silk had replaced the rough Khadi. Gandhiji
expressed this in an article in the Harijan dated the 3rd
August 1947 and lamented that the Congress flag, i.e. the tri-
colour Khaddar flag with the Charkha on it had not become
the national flag and added that if the new flag of the Union
did not represent the Charkha and Khadi, it was valueless in
his opinion ! What a love for democracy ! Savarkar’s efforts
to replace the Charkha by a Chakra were not fruitless. In a
telegram to Dr. Rajendra Prasad, the Chairman of the Consti-
tuent Assembly, who happened to be the chairman of the Flag
Committee of the Constituent Assembly, Savarkar had
requested them to have at least a strip of the saffron colour
and a wheel-Chakra instead of the Charkha on the State Flag.

He did not expect the Constituent Assembly dominated by the
Congressites, to adopt the Geruwa flag with Kripan and
Kundalini on it as the State Flag. It may be recalled here
that Madame Cama of the Abhinava Bharat had unfurled a
tricolour flag as the flag of Indian Independence as early as
1907 at the Socialist Conference in Germany !

Yet another of Savarkarb warning that breakers were
ahead came true with a vengeance. Simultaneously with the



FROM PARITY TO PAKISTAN 359

national rejoicings, a terrible wave of wholesale massacre and
brutality spread over the Punjab and Sind. Unprecedented
violence was let loose. Pakistan had not been established
without any gruesome immediate effect. The tidings that
came from the Punjab were grim and blood-curdling. The
massarre of men, women and children went on unabated.

Millions were uprooted from their native soil, their hearths,
their homes, torn from their dear ones and robbed of all their
possessions. Nobody was sure of the morrow. Burnt houses,
looted shop.s, broken skuils, smoking ruins, blood-smeared
corpses, and mutilated i.tdies scattered all over towns and
villages, spoke of the blood bath and barbarity unsurpassed
in other times and climes. The country rang with horror.

The visionary in Nehru was rudely shaken. He admitted
in his broadcast on August 19, 1947, that ‘ nearly the whole
of India celebrated the coming of Independence, but not so
the unhappy land of the five rivers in the Punjab.’ He also
said that ‘ there was sufficient disa.ster and sorrow, arson and
murder, looting and crime of all descriptions.’ Short-sighted
Congressites were fiddling while the West Punjab was burn-
ing and bleeding. Nehru appealed to the Hindus and Sikhs
of the West Punjab not to make mass migration, and he asked
the people to desist from individual retaliation. He also de-
clared that if it should be retaliation, it should be Government
retaliation, which meant war. Pandit Nehru was not far away
from the truth because in the upper half of India there was
terrific retaliation as a result of insufferable repercussions and
emotions evoked by the holocaust in the East and in the West.
During this crisis Pandit Nehru condemned with burning
hatred everything that had the appearance of Hindu Sangha-
tan. In a Delhi speech he declared that he would even resign
and fight out the Hindu Fascists who clamoured for a Hindu
State and he further said that he was sure that those Fascists
would go down the way the Hitlers and Mussolinis went.

Replying to Nehru on all these points, Savarkar said : ‘
“ What were the thousands of Hindu-Sikhs to do when faced
by an imminent danger of being massacred in cold blood,
looted, burnt alive, forcibly converted, in short, of being
exterminated as a racial and national being by the most

1 Free Hindusthan, Bombay, pp. 16-18 ; 69-71.



360 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

barbarous attacks of an organized, dangerousl3»^ armed and
fanatically hostile foe and especially when the State as such
was nowhere in evidence so effectively as to render any the
least protection to them ? While in the West Punjab the
dangerously armed Muslims in their thousands were parading
in the streets, in towns and cities and raising terror-striking
slogans ‘ Haske liya Pakistan, Marke lenge Hindusthan,’ and
were planning to capture the East Punjab and Delhi, the
Congressiies, observed Savarkar, were celebrating their
bloodless revolution brought about by the vivisection of India,
although the Hindu Sanghatanists kept shouting that danger
was ahead and that this was no time to rejoice when they were
stranded on the top of a volcano already in eruption. He
added : “ Under these circumstances what wonder is there
that millions of Hindu-Sikhs prompted by instinct of self-
preservation and animated by the spirit of Pan-Hindu con-
solidation rose in arms in the East Punjab, in Bharatpur, in
Alwar, in Patiala and in Delhi itself and responded to the
best of their might and means so furiously and effectively
as to checkmate the Muslim hoards from attempting an
invasion of the East Punjab, threw them on their defensive
and saved Delhi itself from being captured by the Muslims
concentrated there. If Panditji and his Congressite comrades
are still safe and secure in their seats, they owe it to this
brave fight which the Hindu Sanghatanist and Sikh forces
gave in the nick of time. And still it is he who unblushingly
comes forward to deliver to them a sermon on the exclusive
right of the State to retaliate. Had a Shivaji or a Ranjit Singh
been at the helm of the State, he could have demanded with
propriety that the people should leave the right of retaliation
in his hands alone. But when the puny Pandit tries to
demand it in the accent of Shivaji, it strikes as funny as it
would do if a pigmy standing on his tiptoes tried to rival a
giant in height.”

And as to the threats of resignation by Nehru, Savarkar
said that if the Government was handed over to the Sikh-
Hindu Sanghatanist coalition, a cabinet could be formed
which would be not only more efficient than the present



FROM PARITY TO PAKISTAN 361

one, but also will prove to be absolutely indispensable to face
the stark realities as noted above.

As regards the misrepresentation of Hindu Raj by Nehru
and his hatred for everything that was Hindu, Savarkar said
it was a stunt on the part of Gandhist ministers, leaders and
pap>ers to cover their dismal and disastrous failure in protect-
ing the life, property and honour of our nation. Savarkar
proceeded: “The demand for the Hindu Raj, these pseudo-
nationalists say, is communal, stupid, medieval, theocratical,
a menace to the progres"^ of mankind itself ! But they con-
veniently refuse to tell us w hat they precisely mean by Hindu
Raj, before they characterize it in the above-mentioned vilify-
ing terms. Nevertheless, assuming for the sake of argument
that the demand for a Hindu State deserves this condemnation
on all these counts, may we ask them : was not the demand
for a Moslem State at least equally condemnable on these very
counts ? Did not the Moslems base their claims to own the
Pakistani Provinces on the ground that the Muslims consti-
tuted the major community predominating there ? ’’

Savarkar further replied to Nehru with equal force and
fire : “ But instead of fighting against that demand for a
Moslem Raj you actually abetted the crime of cutting inte-
grated India right into two halves directly on communal
lines which the Anglo-Muslim conspirators perpetrated and
handed over Pakistan to the Moslems so ceremoniously, with
such ease and grace as you would hand over a cup of tea to a
welcome guest ! With what face now can you vilify the
demand for a Hindu Raj on this very count even if it could
be said to possess all the above traits ? Savarkar goes on :
“ A Pathani or Nizami Muslim Raj is to Gandhi ji a cent per
cent Swaraj. But a Hindu Raj ! O no ! It would be com-
munal, fascist, anti-national and an anathema ! Savarkar
further observes : “You contend further that our country
and our State cannot be called Hindusthan and Hindu State
as some non-Hindu minorities too are citizens thereof. But
how is that in spite of the presence of the Hindus, Christians,
Parsees and other non-Muslim minorities in its territory all
of you and Gandhi ji in particular keep salaming and saluting



362 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

that newly carved out Muslim Rai as Pakistan which
avowedly and literally means a Holy Muslim Land, a Muslim
State ? Is it not a fact that almost all States and nations are
called after the names of what the League of Nations termed
‘ National Majority ’ predominating in each ? Nor have you
yourselves ever felt any qualm of conscience in recognizing
Baluchistan, Waziristan, Afghanistan, Turkastan or the
Tuxkish State as such in spite of the presence of non-Muslim
minorities there ? How is it then that the very mention of
the name of Hindusthan or the Hindu State alone takes your
breath out as if you were smitten by a snake-bite ? ”

As for the threat of Nehru that he would fight out those who
clamoured for Hindu Raj as Hindu Fascists, Savarkar
retorted : “ The Hindu Sanghatanists cannot be terrorized by
the threat of such carpet-knights as the Pandit and his clan.”
He concluded his historic reply to Pandit Nehru : “ The choice
therefore is not between two sets of personalities but between
two ideologies, not between Indian Raj and Hindu Raj but
between Muslim Raj and Hindu Raj, between Akhand Hindu-
sthan and Akhand Pakistan. The Hindu Sanghatanist ideo-
logy alone can, therefore, save our nation and re-establish
an Akhand Hindusthan from the Indus to the Seas.”

The Congress leaders in their zeal to carve out a secular
State, which is in fact a noble ideal, fell to de-Hinduising
Hindusthan. They denounced Hindu Raj, but brought about
a religious State, a theocratic State, Pakistan. They saluted
and blessed Pakistan, but cursed with burning hatred the
appellation Hindusthan. They started to speak of the people
by calling them Muslims and non-Muslims of India. Their
speeches, addresses, statements and official announcements
described and referred to the Muslims as Muslims and to all
others as the non-Muslims of India. So burning a hatred they
had even for the word ‘ Hindu ’ and the appellation Hindu-
sthan that they dropped out those appellations as if the Hindus
in their Homeland were a dying, vanishing race like the
twentieth century empires.

At a post-prayer meeting in Delhi on June 12, 1947, Gandhiji
told his audience that Pandit Nehru refused to call the non-



FROM PARITY TO PAKISTAN 363

Pakistan areas as Hindusthan and Gandhiji further said :
“ The Muslim majority areas might call themselves Pakistan,
but the rest and the largest part of India need not call itself
Hindusthan.” Could un-Hindu nationalism go further ?
Savai’kar pitied this inferiority complex and the cowardly
attitude on the part of the Congress leaders. Savarkar never
said that he wanted to base the Hindu State on Plinduism.
The concept of Hindu Raj was not based on Hinduism but on
Hindutva. And Hindutva and Hinduism were two quite
different things. Ration.ii.sts Avould never say that Savarkar
would stand for a State m which a Shankaracharya would
be authorized to make laws and deal with justice. Is there
such a degraded man as will say that Savarkar ever said that
he wanted to deal with the so-called Depressed Classes and
measure the ideals governing man and woman with Manu’s
rod ? According to Savarkarism, the word Hindu connotes
nationality. You may be a Buddhist, a Jain, a Sikh or an
Arya Samajist by faith, but by nationality you are a Hindu.
The term Hindu State corresponds to the terms the German
State, Japanese State, Afghan State, Turkish State. You
gladly repeat the words Mu.slim State, Mogul rule, Pakistan,
Turkish State. Where is the harm if you call the Bharatiya
State as the Hindu State ? Moreover, Savarkar meant by
the word Hindu Rashtra, a State grown out of the historic
cultural background. The national majority after whom the
State is named must follow their bent, must grow according
to their nature and blood by reconciling their past with the
present, shaping their future in the light of science. But
Savarkar always insisted that none should hustle or terrorize
the national majority into shaping their present or future.

Why should Pandit Nehru and his colleagues decry this kind
of Hindu Ra.shtra in which every citizen will be equal in the
eyes of law ? Pandit Nehru and Gandhiji especially who
started their political careers with a Theocratic Movement,
the Khilafat, and ended it in creating a Theocratic State,
Pakistan, on the basis of religion should have any the least
objection to it. And at last Pandit Nehru declared at
Lucknow in October 1947 : “ Congress wanted to establish

a secular democratic State in the country. Naturally in such

SAVAPKAR AND HIS TIMES

a Slate the predominant culture and outlook vvoulrl b
governed by the great majority of the Hindus in the popuC
tion/^ But according to Savarkar the culture of the majority
in India was the culture of Rama^ Krishna, Kalidas, Vikram,
Bhavabhutu Pratap, Guru Govindsingh, Shivaji and
Vivekananda, and not the culture of TaimurJang, Mohamad of
Ghazni, Mohamad Ghori, Babar, Aurangzeb and Tipu !

While these controversies were going on, confusion,
fanaticism and retaliation were reigning supreme. It is
necessary to reveal here as briefly as possible the significance
of this insurmountable crisis as this was indirectly responsible
for Savarkar being involved in the most heinous trial.
Gandliist leaders proved to be unequal to the occasion and
historic necessities. People now realized that Gandhism was
an illusion. Gandhiji himself realized too late that what the
nation followed was not non-violence but passive resistance.
He expressed this at a meeting in Delhi. Nehru said that the
nation had to wade through ocean of blood and tears. Such
was the crisis and such were the times that people showed a
profound disbelief in and dislike of Gandhism which seemed till
yesterday the ruling belief of the majority. The blood, tears,
sighs and sorrow proved that Gandhism was a dreamland. The
situation was utterly volcanic and it disclosed that the whole
range of consequences was the outcome of those beliefs,
opinions and actions. People seemed now unwilling to
sacrifice their present ease or near convenience in the hope
of securing higher advantages for others and honour of
tomorrow. The magnitude of the issues and height of interests
involved was such that there was a stirring shock in the realm
of the national mind. Perturbed by the atrocities, imbecilities
and the terrific holocaust that marked the course of the period,
even the great Congress leaders were chilled in their political
beliefs ! They now realized that mere height of aim and
nobility of expression did not move the matter-of-fact world.

K. M. Munshi, who claimed to have followed the Mahatma,
while reviewing the situation in the Freedom Special of his
Social Welfare, observed : “ Last thirty-five years, we have

been brought up on a slogan : naturalness and inevitableness
of Hindu-Muslim unity. That this was a wishful thinking has



FROM PARITY TO PAKISTAN 365

been prov<: d in Noakhali, Bihar, Rawalpindi — ^in a hundred
villages, by tons of thousands of men, women and children
fleeing for safety. The Muslim — a hard realist — ^knew and
exploited the hollowness of the slogans ; the Hindu cherishes
it still. Hindus love words and ideals.’' What a melancholy
epitaph on Gandhism by a Gandhist ! How fitting yet flagrant,
how frank yet ferocious, how realistic though belated ! The
terrific shock also evoked a spontaneous remark from Babu
Purushottamdas Tandon. Tandon declared while speaking at
a meeting in Bareilly that » landhiji’s doctrine of absolute non-
violence had proved to be useless and was greatly responsible
for the partiiion of India.

Even the Bharat Jyoii, a well-known English Weekly and a
strong spokesman of the Congress in Bombay, bewailed in its
editorial dated October 26, 1947, under the caption ‘ Barter
not Truth ’ : “ Today, Gandhiji is a living witness to the

failure of his political mission. His failure is the measure of
his departure from truth, in his implementation of truth.” The
editorial concludes : ‘‘ Gandhiji resisted partition of India,

but like Yudhishthira, by a play of words, secured the nation s
ratification of Partition ; he, like Yudhishthira, is witnessing
hell’s torments. Power of truth is great ; lie’s punishment is
greater. So, barter not, truth.”

In the meanwhile people who were filled with a sense and
anxiety for security spoke in terms of strife and survival. One
furious and reckless mob stoned Gandhiji’s residence at
Calcutta twenty-four hours before the dawn of freedom ! The
furious mob even shouted “ Gandhi, Go Back.” In Delhi,
Pandit Nehru and other Congress leaders were stunned to
hear later on at the time of Gandhiji’s last fast the slogans of
the angry crowds shouting ‘ Let Gandhi die The principle
of absolute non-violence had gone with the wind. People were
puzzled over the words and deeds of the Congress leaders.
India was fighting Pakistan in Kashmir not with the spinning
wheel or with cotton balls, but with deadly bullets and des-
tructive bombs. Gandhiji’s prayer-meetings were now-a-days
abandoned, disturbed, heckled and routed. Pickets had to be
posted at Gandhi’s residence in Delhi to protect Gandhiji, the
symbol of non-violence. C.I.D. in plain dress guarded
Gandhiji’s post-prayer meetings. Savarkar had nothing to



3S6 SAVARKAR AN0 HIS TIMES

do with these violent mob demonstrations nor with the
newspapers’ smashing criticism of Gandhism. That was the
growing opinion in the minds of the people and the colurrtns
of the Congress press. Not that the people were in a mood
to listen to Savarkar. There was confusion, indecision and
misjudgment of the issues in the minds of the people and their
leaders and their press.

And such a crisis was capped by Gandhiji’s famous fast
which he started on January 13, 1948, for the reinstatement of
the Muslims in their houses at Delhi, for the restoration of dese-
crated mosques to their former use and for other five reasons,
and as a sequel the Government of India led by Congressmen
was forced to pay Pakistan rupees fifty-five crores which had
been loudly decried and refused. The Modern Reinew a
Calcutta monthly, famous for its balanced views all over the
world, began its editorial notes in its issue of January 1948
with a pertinent question : “ The time has come when our
trusted leaders, including the Father of the Nation, have to be
asked for a clear reply to a plain question. Where does the
Hindu of the Indian Union stand today and what does freedom
mean for him ? Does he possess along with others the
democratic birth-rights by which a State has to be ruled and
administered for the greatest good for the majority, or is he
there merely to serve as so much fuel for a burnt sacrifice —
to be used for “ conscience-fodder,” so to say, by his leaders,
just as the totalitarian Fuehrer used his people as cannon-
fodder ? ” The Review proceeds : “ It is the Hindu who did

by far most of the fighting for liberty and offered by far the
vastly greater part of the sacrifices. Then why should his
interests be sacrificed at every emotional impulse of his elders
and leaders ? ” The note puts a query : “ A state cannot be

run on the lines of a Passion-play, and what would avail the
working of a miracle in the minds of the recalcitrant infinitesi-
mal minority, if thereby the trust of the hundreds of millions
of the majority be betrayed ? ” Referring to the fast of
Gandhiji, the Modem Review concluded its note in a grave
judgment : “ Mahatmaji’s fast will, we are sure, attain its

object for the time being but the results would be futile and
disastrous in the long run, unless Pakistanis mend their ways.
Indeed, this fast will enhance communal bitterness a



FROM PARITY TO PAKISTAN 367

thousandfold on this side when the people realize the futility
of their sacrifices, and would make the ultimate and inevitable
clash horrible and catastrophic beyond all measure, unless
Mahatmaji can work his miracle in Pakistan as well.”

And in the midst of such an atmosphere of extreme gloom,
confusion and disaster, Nathuram Vinayak Godse shot
Gandhiji with a revolver while Gandhiji was going to the
prayer ground in the compound of Birla House at Delhi in
the evening at 5-30 on Friday, January 30, 1948.
