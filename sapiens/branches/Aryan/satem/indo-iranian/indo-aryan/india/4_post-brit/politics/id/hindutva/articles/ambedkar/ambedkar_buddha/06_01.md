> § 1. Gift from King Bimbisara
>
>  1. King Bimbisara was not merely a follower of the Blessed Lord;
> he was also a great devotee, and a great supporter of his Dhamma.  
>  2. After his becoming a lay disciple, Bimbisara asked, "Might the
> Blessed Lord consent to take his meal with me tomorrow, together with
> the fraternity of the monks?"  
>  3. The Blessed One expressed his consent by remaining silent.  
>  4. Then King Bimbisara, when he understood that the Blessed One
> had accepted his invitation, rose from his seat, respectfully saluted
> the Blessed One, and, passing round him with his right side towards
> him, went away.  
>  5. And when the night had elapsed, Bimbisara ordered excellent
> food to be prepared, and at \[that\] time announced to the Blessed One
> in the words: "It is time. Lord, the meal is ready."  
>  6. And in the forenoon the Blessed One, having put on his
> under-robe, took his alms-bowl, and with his robe on, entered the city
> of Rajagraha, accompanied by monks who had all been Jatilas before.  
>  7. And the Blessed One went to the palace of King Bimbisara.
> Having gone there, he sat down with the monks who followed him, on
> seats laid out for them. Then King Bimbisara with his own hands served
> the fraternity of monks with the Buddha at its head; and when the
> Blessed One had finished his meal and cleaned his bowl and his hands,
> he sat down near him.  
>  8. Sitting near him King Bimbisara thought: "Where may I find a
> place for the Blessed One to live in, not too far from the village and
> not too near, suitable for going and coming, easily accessible for
> people who keep on seeking him, by day not too crowded, where there is
> little sound, little noise by night, sequestered, hidden from men,
> well fitted for a retired life?"  
>  9. And King Bimbisara thought: "There is the Veluvana, my pleasure
> garden, which is not too far from the town and not too near, suitable
> for going and coming. What if I were to make an offering of the
> Veluvana pleasure garden to the fraternity of monks, with the Buddha
> at its head?"  
>  10. And King Bimbisara took a golden vessel with water in it, to
> be poured over the Buddha's hand; and made a gift to the Blessed One,
> saying, "I give this Veluvana pleasure garden, Lord, to the fraternity
> of monks with the Buddha at its head." The Blessed One accepted the
> park.  
>  11. Then the Blessed One, after having taught, incited, animated,
> and gladdened King Bimbisara by religious discourse, rose from his
> seat and went away.  
>  12. And in consequence of this event the Blessed One, after having
> delivered a religious discourse, addressed the monks: "I allow you,
> monks, to receive this donation of a park."
>
>   
> § 2. Gift from Anathapindika
>
>  1. After his conversion, Anathapindika once went to the Blessed
> Lord. Taking his seat on his right side, he said:  
>  2. "The Lord knows that I dwell in Shravasti, a land rich in
> produce, and enjoying peace; Pasendi is the great king thereof.  
>  3. "Now am I wishful to found a Vihar there. I pray you, of your
> tenderness, come to Shravasti and accept it from me."  
>  4. The Blessed Lord kept silent and thereby showed his willingness
> to accept the gift.  
>  5. Anathapindika, the friend of the destitute and the supporter of
> orphans, having returned home, saw the garden of the heir-apparent,
> Jeta, with its green groves and limpid rivulets, and thought: "This is
> the place which will be most suitable as a Vihara for the fraternity
> of the Blessed One." And he went to the prince and asked leave to buy
> the ground.  
>  6. The prince was not inclined to sell the garden, for he valued
> it highly. He at first refused, but said at last: "If you can cover it
> with gold, then, and for no other price, shall you have it."  
>  7. Anathapindika rejoiced and began to spread his gold; but Jeta
> said: "Spare yourself trouble, for I will not sell." But Anathapindika
> insisted. Thus they differed and contended, until they resorted to the
> magistrate.  
>  8. Meanwhile the people began to talk of the unwonted proceeding;
> and the prince, hearing more of the details, and knowing that
> Anathapindika was not only very wealthy but also straightforward and
> sincere, inquired into his plans. On hearing the name of the Blessed
> One, the prince became anxious to share in the foundation, and he
> accepted only one-half of the gold, saying: "Yours is the land, but
> mine are the trees. I will give the trees as my share of the offering
> to the Lord."  
>  9. Having made the foundation, they began to build the hall which
> rose loftily in due proportions, according to the directions which the
> Blessed One had given; and it was beautifully decorated with
> appropriate carvings.  
>  10. This Vihara was called Jetavana, and the friend of the orphans
> invited the Lord to come to Shravasti and receive the gift. And the
> Blessed One left Kapilavastu and came to Shravasti.  
>  11. While the Blessed One entered Jetavana, Anathapindika
> scattered flowers and burned incense, and as a sign of the gift he
> poured water from a golden dragon pitcher, saying, "This Jetavana
> Vihara I give for the use of the brotherhood throughout the world."  
>  12. The Blessed One received the gift, and replied: "May all evil
> influences be overcome; may the offering promote the kingdom of
> righteousness, and be a permanent blessing to mankind in general and
> especially also to the giver."  
>  13. Anathapindika was one of the eighty chief disciples who bore
> the title of Chief Almsgiver.
>
>   
> § 3. Gift from Jeevaka
>
>  1. Jeevaka the physician visited the Blessed One twice a day,
> whenever the Blessed One happened to be in Rajagraha.  
>  2. Jeevaka found the Veluvana, gifted away to the Blessed One by
> King Bimbisara, too far away.  
>  3. Jeevaka had his own park in Rajagraha, known as Ambavana, which
> was much nearer from \[=to\] his place.  
>  4. He thought of building a Vihara with all its adjuncts, and
> present\[ing\] the Ambavana and the Vihara to the Blessed One.  
>  5. With this idea in his mind he approached the Blessed One, and
> requested him to let him fulfil his wishes.  
>  6. The Blessed Lord showed his acceptance by remaining silent.
>
>   
> § 4. Gift from Ambrapali
>
>  1. Now the Exalted One was staying at Nadika and was wishing for a
> change. He addressed Ananda, and said: "Come, Ananda, let us go on to
> Vesali."  
>  2. "So be it. Lord," said Ananda, in assent, to the Exalted One.  
>  3. Then the Exalted One proceeded, with a great company of the
> brethren, to Vesali, and there at Vesali, the Exalted One stayed at
> Ambrapali's grove.  
>  4. Now the courtesan Ambrapali heard that the Exalted One had
> arrived at Vesali, and was staying there at her mango grove. And
> ordering a number of state vehicles to be made ready, she mounted one
> of them, and went forth with her train from Vesali towards her garden.
> She went in the carriage as far as the ground was passable for
> carriages; there she alighted, and she proceeded on foot to the place
> where the Exalted One was, and took her seat respectfully on one side.
> And when she was thus seated the Exalted One instructed her with
> religious discourse.  
>  5. Then she addressed the Exalted One, and said: " May the Exalted
> One do me the honour of taking his meal, together with the brethren,
> at my house tomorrow ? "  
>  6. And the Exalted One gave, by silence, his consent. Then when
> Ambrapali the courtesan saw that the Exalted One had consented, she
> rose from her seat and bowed down before him; and keeping him on her
> right hand as she passed him, she departed thence.  
>  7. Now the Licchavis of Vesali heard that the Exalted One had
> arrived at Vesali, and was staying at Ambrapali's grove. They too
> wanted to invite the Buddha to their place for a meal. And ordering a
> number of state carriages to be made ready, they each mounted one of
> them and went forth with their train from Vesali.  
>  8. They and Ambrapali crossed on the way.  
>  9. And Ambrapali drove up against the young Licchavis, axle to
> axle, wheel to wheel, and yoke to yoke, and the Licchavis said to
> Ambrapali the courtesan, "How is it, Ambrapali, that thou drivest up
> against us thus?"  
>  10. "My Lords, I have just invited the Exalted One and his
> brethren for their morrow's meal," said Ambrapali.  
>  11. "Ambrapali, sell this honour to us fora hundred thousand,"
> said they.  
>  12. "My Lords, were you to offer all Vesali with its subject
> territory, I would not give it up."  
>  13. The Licchavis cast up their hands, exclaiming: "We are outdone
> by this mango girl. We are out-reached by this mango girl," and they
> went on to Ambrapali's grove.  
>  14. Knowing that they were outdone, they still thought of
> approaching the Blessed One, in the hope that he might reconsider and
> give their invitation first preference. So they went on to Ambrapali's
> grove.  
>  15. When the Exalted One saw the Licchavis approaching in the
> distance, he addressed the brethren and said: "Brethren, let those of
> the brethren who have never seen the devas, gaze upon this company of
> the Licchavis, behold this company of the Licchavis, compare this
> company of the Licchavis--for they are even a company of next-world
> devas."  
>  16. And when they had ridden as far as the ground was passable for
> carriages, the Licchavis alighted there, and then went on foot to the
> place where the Exalted One was, and took their seats respectfully by
> his side.  
>  17. Then they addressed the Exalted One, and said : "May the
> Exalted One do us the honour of taking his meal, together with the
> brethren, at our house tomorrow?"  
>  18. "I have promised, Licchavis, to dine tomorrow with Ambrapali,"
> was the reply.  
>  19. Then the Licchavis knew that they had failed. And after
> expressing their thanks and approval of the words of the Exalted One,
> they rose from their seats and bowed down before the Exalted One, and
> keeping him on their right hand as they passed him, departed thence.  
>  20. And at the end of the night, Ambrapali the courtesan made
> ready in her mansion sweet rice and cakes, and announced the time to
> the Exalted One, saying, "The hour. Lord, has come, and the meal is
> ready."  
>  21. And the Exalted One who had dressed himself early in the
> morning, took his bowl and his robe, and went with the brethren to the
> place where Ambrapali's mansion was; and when he had come there he
> seated himself on the seat prepared for him. And Ambrapali, the
> courtesan, set the sweet rice and cakes before the order, with the
> Buddha at their head, and waited upon them till they refused any
> more.  
>  22. And when the Blessed One had quite finished his meal, and had
> cleansed the bowl and his hands, the courtesan had a low stool
> brought, and sat down-at his side, and addressed the Exalted One, and
> said:  
>  23. " Lord, I present my pleasance to you and to the order." And
> the Exalted One accepted the gift; and after giving a religious
> discourse, he rose from his seat and took her leave.
>
>   
> § 5. Munificence of Vishakha
>
>  1. Vishakha was a wealthy woman of Shravasti. She had many
> children and grandchildren.  
>  2. When the Blessed One stayed at Shravasti, Vishakha went up to
> the place where the Blessed One was, and tendered Him an invitation to
> take his meal at her house, which the Blessed One accepted.  
>  3. And heavy rain fell during the night and the next morning; and
> the bhikkhus doffed their robes to keep themselves dry, and let the
> rain fall upon their bodies.  
>  4. When the next day the Blessed One had finished his meal, she
> took her seat at his side and spoke thus: "Eight are the boons, Lord,
> which I beg of the Blessed One."  
>  5. Then the Blessed One said: "The Tathagatas, O Vishakha, grant
> no boons unless they know what they are."  
>  6. Vishakha replied: "Proper, Lord, and unobjectionable are the
> boons I ask."  
>  7. Having received permission to ask the boons, Vishakha said: "I
> desire. Lord, through all my life to bestow robes for the rainy season
> on the Sangha, and food for incoming bhikkhus, and food for outgoing
> bhikkhus, and food for the sick, and food for those who wait upon the
> sick, and medicine for the sick, and a constant supply of rice-milk
> for the Sangha, and bathing robes for the bhikkhunis, the sisters."  
>  8. "But," said the Lord, "What, O Vishakha, have you in view, in
> asking these eight boons of the Tathagata?"  
>  9. And Vishakha replied: "I gave command, Lord, to my
> maid-servant, saying, 'Go thou and announce to the fraternity that the
> meal is ready,' and my maid went, but when she came to the vihara, she
> observed that the bhikkhus had doffed their robes, while it was
> raining, and she thought: 'These are not bhikkhus, but naked ascetics
> letting the rain fall on them.' So she returned to me and reported
> accordingly, and I had to send her a second time.  
>  10. "Impure, Lord, is nakedness, and revolting. It was this
> circumstance, Lord, that I had in view in desiring to provide the
> Sangha throughout my life with special garments for use in the rainy
> season.  
>  11. "As to my second wish. Lord, an incoming bhikku, not being
> able to take the direct roads, and not knowing the places where food
> can be procured, comes on his way wearied out by seeking for alms. It
> was this circumstance, Lord, that I had in view, in desiring to
> provide the Sangha throughout my life with food for incoming
> bhikkhus.  
>  12. "Thirdly, Lord, an outgoing bhikkhu, while seeking about for
> alms, may be left behind, or may arrive too late at the place whither
> he desires to go, and will set out on the road in weariness.  
>  13. "Fourthly, Lord, if a sick bhikkhu does not obtain suitable
> food, his sickness may increase upon him, and he may die.  
>  14. "Fifthy, Lord, a bhikkhu who is waiting upon the sick will
> lose his opportunity of going out to seek food for himself.  
>  15. "Sixthly, Lord, if a sick bhikkhu does not obtain suitable
> medicines, his sickness may increase upon him, and he may die.  
>  16. "Seventhly, Lord, I have heard that the Blessed One has
> praised rice-milk, because it gives readiness of mind, dispels hunger
> and thirst; it is wholesome nourishment for the healthy, and for the
> sick as a medicine. Therefore I desire to provide the Sangha
> throughout my life with \[a\] constant supply of rice-milk.  
>  17. "Finally, Lord, the bhikkhunis are in the habit of bathing in
> the river Archiravati with the courtesans, at the same landing-place,
> and naked. And the courtesans. Lord, ridicule the bhikkhunis, saying,
> 'What is the good, ladies, of your maintaining chastity when you are
> young? When you are old, maintain chastity then; thus will you be
> obtainers of both ends.' Impure, Lord, is nakedness for a woman,
> disgusting, and revolting.  
>  18. "These are the circumstances, Lord, that I had in view."  
>  19. The Blessed One said, "But what was the advantage you had in
> view for yourself, O Vishakha, in asking these eight boons of the
> Tathagatha?"  
>  20. Vishakha replied: "Bhikkhus who have spent the rainy season in
> various places will come, Lord, to Shravasti to visit the Blessed One.
> And on coming to the Blessed One they will ask, saying: 'Such and such
> a bhikkhu. Lord, has died. What, now, is his destiny?' Then will the
> Blessed One explain that he has attained the fruits of conversion;
> that he has entered Nirvana or attained arhantship, as the case may
> be.  
>  21. "And I, going up to them, shall ask, 'Was that brother, sirs,
> one of those who had formerly been at Shravasti?' then shall I arrive
> at the conclusion, 'For a certainty did that brother enjoy either the
> robes for the rainy season, or the food for the incoming bhikkhus, or
> the food for the outgoing bhikkhus, or the food for the sick, or the
> food for those that wait upon the sick, or the medicine for the sick,
> or the constant supply of rice-milk.'  
>  22. "Then will gladness spring up within me; thus gladdened joy
> will come to me; and so rejoicing all my frame will be at peace. Being
> thus at peace, I shall experience a blissful feeling of content; and
> in that bliss my heart will be at rest. That will be to me an exercise
> of my moral powers, an exercise of the seven kinds of wisdom! This,
> Lord, was the advantage I had in view for myself, in asking those
> eight boons of the Blessed One."  
>  23. Then the Blessed One said, "It is well, it is well, Vishakha.
> Thou hast done well in asking these eight boons of the Tathagata with
> such advantage in view. Charity bestowed upon those who are worthy of
> it is like good seeds sown in good soil that yields an abundance of
> fruits. But alms given to those who are yet under the tyrannical yoke
> of the passions are like a seed deposited in bad soil. The passions of
> the receiver of the alms choke, as it were, the growth of merits."  
>  24. And the Blessed One gave thanks to Vishakha in these verses:
> "Whatsoever donation a woman upright in life, a disciple of the
> Blessed One, may bestow in gladness of heart and without stint, her
> gift is heavenly, destructive of sorrow, and productive of bliss." " A
> blissful life does she attain entering upon the path that is from
> corruption and impurity." "Aiming at good, happy does she become; and
> she rejoices in her charitable actions."  
>  25. Vishakha gave to the Order the Purva-Aram or Eastern Garden,
> and was the first to become a matron of the lay-sisters.
