While H might engage in deep psephological dissections or tamAshA, without an iota of civilizational consideration the landscape leading to the nirNaya is going to get tighter for them to maneuver: 

1. the lAteshvara will have less space for fostering suitable successors for a seamless transition. 
2. In a sense the lATapati has faced a set back similar to the nonagenarian he replaced. 
3. The mahAnt-jI will probably not recover to be in contention for the succession. 
4. The revived paTTa-roga will probably be the big anti-H flare up. If the laTa cannot deal firmly with them as he distracted by the need of holding on to the andhra & magadha to stay afloat that will take further sheen of him & the puShkara. 
5. Without a good successor the famed Indian democracy will run its course in the next round paving the way for those who will open the way for the nirNaya. Thus, even as the H are engaging in delicate & nuanced debates on governance, hypocrisy of those in power, mullAvAda, metrics comparing term 3 to the new dispensation, street veto etc, the nirNaya will come on them...

Looking at the geopolitical alignments in the coming year, the lATeshvara's govt will see strong mlechCha support for enemy action on the marUnmatta, pretonmatta and paTTa-roga fronts. Defeat of the "R^iShi" in laNDapura will bring a party with natural sympathy for marUmatta-s. 

The paura-putra or his rivals, mlechCha-karNATa-desha will be a pillar of support for the paTTaka terrorists & drug-runners against bhArata.  

If piNDaka returns to power, as is quite possible, he will aid them too. If in the outside chance nAri~Nga regains power his backers could support to the preta terrorists in the NE as they would see that as a foothold to reach China. 

Together the prediction will be that the marUnmatta attacks in kAshmIra are just the beginning & the lATapati's good track record in this direction will be challenged.

The more one looks at it from a zoomed-out vantage the more it seems that the reckoning alluded to [here](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2022/06/12/vikir%e1%b9%87a%e1%b8%a5-vi%e1%b9%a3aya%e1%b8%a5-india-and-the-rus/) will come like the swelling of the sindhu upon the H, perhaps within a decade. While the yuga chakra is always turning this could be the turn that crushes many an onlooker under it. 

- The last major war the H fought on their own behalf was the 1st war of independence in 1857 CE. At the same time, a Jihad was also being fought against the English. This thoroughly confused the H & those confusions persisted over the last ~165 years.+++(5)+++
- \~100 years back the confusion resurfaced over the matter of the lord of turuShkasthAna, the ChAyA of the ekarAkShasa on earth. The resulting irruption was only broken because the English were then the lords of the world & turuShkatva briefly challenged ekarAkShasatva. 

Imagine its replay from the very same nidus when you are not the lord of the world, only middling power & the mlechCha is aiding & abetting the marukarbura. Would it be closer to the replay from ~75-76 YBP? To paraphrase Goel, the H were not yet collectively brain-dead but going forward, like a Rag1-deleted man, the H could face 

- a million little eruptions from within; 
- the vice-like press of mlechCha allies of the marUnmatta; 
- the -ve externalities of the blind adoption of mlechCha economic/organizational/transportation models; 
- the corruption of the elite by navyonmada; 
- the falling human capital & numbers of the elites (?); 
- regionalistic chauvinism & the cost of pan-Indian identity(?); 
- urban concentrations of assets where the inimical forces would be dominant. 

The reckoning could turn out to be prachaNDogra for H civilization.
