ORDER

By this order I shall dispose of an objection raised by Ld. Defence
Counsel that no charge can be framed against the accused persons because
the 'Ayates' were taken by the accused verbatism from the holy book of
'Quran Majeed' translated in Hindi by a Mohammedan writer Mohd. Farookh
Khan and are published in the same form without any addition or
subtraction and it was effect which was produced before the public after
taking the same from the holy book of Quran Majeed. The Ld. Defence
Counsel has admitted that the accused published the disputed posters.
The accused reproduced the same before the public not with any malice or
bad intention nor he has given any bad opinion with regard to holy book
of Quran Majeed and words

![](insidetext01.jpg)[1](#1)

do not in any way tend to create any disharmony or injured the
sentiments of any community, therefore no charge can be framed against
any of the accused. The Aytes in the posters at serial No. 2, 5, 9, 11,
12 to 19 and 22 are available in the 'Quran Majeed' and are not
distorted in any way. The Ld. Defence Counsel has relied upon the
following authorities:-  

> 1\. 1977 Cr. L.J. 1606 (at page 1607 Para 4)  
>
> 2\. 1976 Cr. L.J. 98 (at page 112 Para 41)  
>
> 3\. A.I.R. 1957 Supreme Court 620 (at page 622)  
>
> 4\. A.I.R. 1964 Madras 258 (at page 259 Para-6)

APP for the State has argued to the contrary and has submitted that
truth is no defence and the words:

![](insidetext02.jpg)[2](#2)

have been incorporated in the poster to create the communal disharmony,
to injure the sentiments of Mohammedan community and clearly come within
the mischief of provisions contained in Section 295-A I.P.C. The
intention of the accused persons was to create hatred between the
Mohammedan and other community; therefore they cannot be exonerated from
liability and at this stage of the case the Court cannot weigh the
evidence meticulously and closely. There are strong suspicions that the
accused have committeed the offence and there are prima facie evidence
which are sufficient to frame the charge against the accused. Hence the
arguments advanced by Ld. Defence Counsel are not sustainable and hence
merit rejection. The Ld. APP has also argued that 'Aytes' at serial No.
2, 5, 9, 11 to 19 and 22 are not available in the Quran Majeed and if
*any of them are available they are published with their distorted
version and appear to be malicious with intent to outrage the religious
feelings of the persons having faith in Muslim religion which is clear
on the face of it*. Ld. APP for the State has relied upon the following
authorities:-  

> 1\. 1976 Cr. L.J. page 98  
>
> 2\. 1985 Cr. L.J. page 796  
>
> 3\. 1977 Cr. L.J. page 1606  
>
> 4\. 1960 Cr. L.J. page 1528  
>
> 5\. 1986 Cr. L.J. page 186.

I have heard Ld. APP for the State and Counsel of the accused and have
gone through the relevant record on the file. The main thrust of the
prosecution is that the above words in the disputed posters tend to
create communal disharmony and is an act with deliberate and malicious
intention of outraging the religious feeling of a particular class of
citizens of India and is an attempt to insult the religion or the
religious belief of the said class. It is also submitted that the Aytes
in the form as published in the poster are not available or are
distorted version of the same. The Ld. APP has particularly pointed out
the 'Aytes' at serial No. 2, 5, 9, 11 to 19 and 22.

At this stage of the case the Court is required to see whether there is
a prima facie case against the accused so as to frame a charge against
them. The following observations were made in 1977 Cr. L.J. 1606.

> *"If the evidence which the prosecutor proposes to adduce to prove the
> guilt of the accused even if fully accepted before it is challenged in
> cross-examination or rebutted by defence evidence, if any, cannot bold
> that the accused committed the offence, then there will be no
> sufficient ground for proceeding with the trial."*
>
> "If the scales of the pan as to the guilt or innocence of the accused
> are something like even at the conclusion of the trial, then, on the
> theory of benefit of doubt the case is to end in his acquittal. But
> if, on the other hand, it is so at the initial stage of making an
> order u/s 227 or 228, then in such a situation ordinarily and
> generally the order which has to be made will be one u/s 228 and not
> u/s 227 Cr. P.C."

The following observations were made in 1976 Cr. L.J. page 98 (page 112
Para-41).

> *The fair criticism is different from promoting enmity between classes
> or outraging religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion
> etc."*

In R. Vs. Boulter (1908)72 J.P. 188, the said Court observed that a man
was free to speak and teach what he pleases as to the religious matter.
Similarly in (1971) A.C. 4o6 the principle emerges that the gist of the
offence lies not in objection raised but in the manner of attack made
upon the substance of the doctrines promulgated of the Christian faith,
and that it must be left to the jury to decide whether the terms used
amount to such vilification, ridicule or scurrility, outraging public
feelings and tend to cause a breach of peace.

IN AIR 1964 Madras 258 what was required to be looked into by the Court
was the intention of the writer whether the same tends of outrage
religious feelings of a particular community deliberately and
maliciously. Similar observations were also made in AIR 1957 S.C. 620.

The essential ingredients of Section 153-A IPC are:

> 1\. The accused promoted or attempted to promote feelings of enmity or
> hatred between different class of citizens of India.  
>
> 2\. He did so by words, either spoken or written, or by signs or by
> visible representation or otherwise.

*Malicious is one of the important intergradients of offence u/s 295-A
I.P.C. and it is necessary for the prosecution to establish that element
by proper evidence*. But it being a state of mind is offen not capable
of direct and tangible proof and in almost all cases has to be inferred
from the surrounding circumstances having due regard to the settled
background and connected facts in relation to editing or publishing of
offending articles.

Coming to the facts and circumstances of the case whether the words

![](insidetext01.jpg)[3](#3)

as argued by the Ld. APP for the State tend to promote the communal
disharmony or amount to outrage the religious feelings of the Mohammedan
community, there is a dispute that the 24 'Aytes' published in the
posters have not been taken from the 'Quran Majeed'. translated by the
Mohammedan writer. It is found that they are reproduced in the same form
as are translated in the said 'Quran Majeed'. In my opinion the writer
by writing the above words has expressed his opinion or suggestion and
*at the most it can be branded as a fair criticism of what is contained
in the holy book of Mohammedans. By no stretch of imagination the
opinion expressed by writer that unless these 'Aytes' are removed from
holy book of 'Quran Majeed' there will be no hope of stopping the
communal disturbances in different parts of India*, can be said to
promote or attempt to promote feeling of enmity or hatred between
different classes of citizens of India. In my opinion it is a sort of
suggestion to the readers or at the most a fair criticism and by
publishing such suggestion or criticism, the writer or publisher has not
in any way outraged or attempted to outrage the religious feelings of
Mohammedan community, nor it tends to create communal disharmony or
hatred between two classes. With due regard to the Holy Book of 'Quran
Majeed', a close persual of the Aytes shows that the same are harmful
and teach hatred and are likely to create differences between
Mohammedans on one hand and the remaining communities on the other.

I have personally compared the disputed 'Aytes' with 'Quran Majeed'
translated in Hindi with notes by one Mohd. Farookh Khan and have found
that most of the 'Aytes' have been reproduced in the posters in its
original form as is a available in the 'Quran Majeed' except following:-

In Ayte No. 2 the word 'Murtipujak'[4](#4) has been added in column, in
Ayte No. 9 the word 'Germuslim',[5](#5) in Ayte No. 12 and 13 the word
'Loot', has been incorporated, in Ayte No. 14 the word
'Urdhmuslim'[6](#6) in Ayte No. 17 the word 'Musalmaano' and in Ayte No.
18 & 19 the words 'Urdhmuslim' and 'Musalmaano' respectively have been
incorporated. A persual of English translation in the same book by a
English writer shows the words: Murtipujak, Germuslim, Loot, Urdhmuslim
are the translation of Urdu words Mushrik, Fitnakar, Ganimat and Munafik
etc. The close reading of all the Aytes published in the posters and
read from the book do not in any way give different meanings nor suggest
anything that the same were published with malicious intention.
Therefore, I do not agree with the contention of the Ld. APP that Aytes
No. 2, 5, 9, 11 to 19 and 22 are either not available in Quran Majeed or
they are distorted version of the said Aytes.

Ld. APP contended that Aytes No. 2, 5, 9, 11 to 19 and 22 do not exist
in the holy Quran Sharif in the form in which they have been published
nor are available in the Quran Sharif at all and hence the same required
comparison with Quran Sharif. Ld. Defence Counsel has produced Quran
Majeed from which he has derived all the Aytes and the said book is
followed by Muslims and translated by Muslim writer Mohd. Farookh Khan
and being not challenged by anybody nor the same has been banned by any
authority. Therefore I find no force in the contention of the APP for
the State to compare those Aytes with. Quran Sharif.

The authorities cited by the Ld. APP for the State are not applicable in
the facts and circumstances of the present case.

In view of the above discussions, I am therefore of the view that there
is no prima facie case against the accused as offences alleged against
the accused do not fall prima facie within the four corners of Sections
153-A/295-A and hence both of the accused are discharged.
