> § 1. Critics of Open Admission to the Sangh
>
>  1. It was open for the Sangh to admit a layman who was merely a
> disciple.  
>  2. There were persons who criticised the Lord for making the Sangh
> a wide-open temple for anybody to enter.  
>  3. They argued that under such a scheme it may well happen that
> after they have been admitted into the Order they give it up and
> return again to the lower state, and by their back-sliding the people
> are led to say: "Vain must be this religion of Samana Gautama, which
> these men have given up."  
>  4. The criticism was not well founded, and had altogether missed
> the intention of the Blessed Lord in making such a scheme.  
>  5. The Blessed Lord replied that in establishing his religion he
> had constructed a bathing tank full of the excellent waters of
> emancipation--the bath of good law.  
>  6. It was the Lord's desire that whosoever is polluted with stains
> of sin, he, bathing in it, can wash away all his sins.  
>  7. And if anyone, having gone to the bathing tank of good law,
> should not bathe in it, but turn back polluted as before and return
> again to the lower state, it is he who is to be blamed, and not the
> religion.  
>  8. "Or could I," said the Blessed Lord, "after constructing this
> bathing tank for enabling people to wash away their sins, say, 'Let no
> one who is dirty go down into this tank! Let only those whose dust and
> dirt have been washed away, who are purified and stainless, go down
> into the tank'?  
>  9. "On such terms, what good would have been my religion?"  
>  10. The critics forgot that the Blessed Lord did not wish to
> confine the benefit only to a few. He wanted to keep it open to all,
> to be tried by all.
>
>   
> § 2. Critics of the Rule of Vows
>
>  1. Why are the five precepts not enough? Why vows are felt
> necessary? These were the questions that were often raised,  
>  2. It was argued that if diseases would abate without medicine,
> what could be the advantage of weakening the body by emetics, by
> purges, and other like remedies?  
>  3. Just so, if laymen, living at home and enjoying the pleasures
> of the senses, can realize in themselves the conditions of peace, the
> Supreme Good, Nibbana, by taking precepts, what is the need of the
> bhikkhu taking upon himself these vows?  
>  4. The Blessed Lord devised the vows because of the virtues
> inherent in them.  
>  5. A life conditioned by vows is certain to bring with it growth
> in goodness; it is itself a protection against a fall.  
>  6. Those who take vows and keep them as self-dependents, are
> emancipated.  
>  7. The keeping of vows is the restriction of lust and of malice,
> of pride, \[and is\] the cutting of evil thoughts.  
>  8. Those who take vows and keep them, well guarded are they
> indeed, and altogether pure are they in manners and in mind.  
>  9. Not so with mere taking of precepts.  
>  10. In the case of the precepts, there is no protection against
> moral decline, as there is in the case of vows.  
>  11. A life of vows is very difficult, and a life of precepts not
> so. It is necessary for mankind to have some who live the life of
> vows. So the Blessed Lord prescribed both.
>
>   
> § 3. Critics of the Doctrine of Ahimsa
>
>  1. There were persons who objected to the doctrine of Ahimsa. They
> said that it involved surrender or non-resistance to evil.  
>  2. This is a complete misrepresentation of what the Blessed Lord
> taught by his doctrine of Ahimsa.  
>  3. The Blessed Lord has made his position clear on various
> occasions, so as to leave no room for ambiguity or misunderstanding.  
>  4. The first such occasion to which reference should be made is
> the occasion when he made a rule regarding the entry of a soldier
> in\[to\] the Sangh.  
>  5. At one time the border provinces of the kingdom of Magadha were
> agitated. Then the Magadha king Seniya Bimbisara gave order to the
> Commander of the army: 'Well now, go and ask your officers to search
> through the border provinces for the offenders, punish them, and
> restore peace." The Commander acted accordingly.  
>  6. On hearing the orders of the Commander the officers found
> themselyes placed in a dilemma. They knew that the Tathagatha taught
> that those who go to war and find delight in fighting, do evil and
> produce great demerit. On the other hand, here was the king's order to
> capture the offenders and to kill them. Now what shall we do, asked
> the officers to themselves.  
>  7. Then these officers thought: "If we could enter the order of
> the Buddha, we would be able to escape from the dilemma."  
>  8. Thus these officers went to the bhikkhus and asked them for
> ordination; the bhikkhus conferred on them the pabbajja and upasampada
> ordinations, and the officers disappeared from the army.  
>  9. The Commander of the army, .finding that the officers were not
> to be seen, asked the soldiers, "Why, how is it that the officers are
> nowhere to be seen?" "The officers, lord, have embraced religious life
> of the bhikkhus," replied the soldiers.  
>  10. Then the Commander of the army was annoyed, and became very
> angry: "How can the bhikkhus ordain persons in the royal army?"  
>  11. The Commander of the army informed the king of what had
> happened. And the king asked the officers of justice: "Tell me, my
> good sirs, what punishment does he deserve who ordains a person in the
> royal service?"  
>  12. "The Upagghaya, Your Majesty, should be beheaded; to him who
> recites (the Kammavaka), the tongue should be torn out; to those who
> form the chapter, half of their ribs should be broken."  
>  13. Then the king went to the place where the Blessed One was; and
> after obeisance, informed him of what had happened.  
>  14. "The Lord well knows that there are kings who are against the
> Dhamma. These hostile kings are ever ready to harass the bhikkhus even
> for trifling reasons. It is impossible to imagine the lengths to which
> they might go in their ill-treatment of the bhikkhus, if they find
> that the bhikkhus are seducing the soldiers to leave the army and join
> the Sangh. Pray, Lord, to do the needful to avert the disaster."  
>  15. The Lord replied, "It was never my intention to allow soldiers
> under the cloak of Ahimsa or in the name of Ahimsa to abandon their
> duty to the king or to their country."  
>  16. Accordingly the Blessed One made a rule against the admission
> of persons in royal service to the Sangh, and proclaimed it to the
> bhikkhus, saying: "Let no one, O Bhikkhus, who is in the royal
> service, receive the Pabbajja ordination. He who confers the Pabbajja
> ordination on such a person will be guilty of a dukkata offence."  
>  17. A second time the Blessed One was cross-examined on the
> subject of Ahimsa by Sinha, a General in the army, and who was a
> follower of Mahavir.  
>  18. Sinha asked, "One doubt still lurks in my mind concerning the
> doctrine of the Blessed One. Will the Blessed One consent to clear the
> cloud away, so that I may understand the Dhamma as the Blessed One
> teaches it?"  
>  19. The Tathagata having given his consent, Sinha said: "I am a
> soldier, O Blessed One, and am appointed by the king to enforce his
> laws and to wage his wars. Does the Tathagata, who teaches kindness
> without end and compassion with all sufferers, permit the punishment
> of the criminal? And further, does the Tathagata declare that it is
> wrong to go to war for the protection of our homes, our wives, our
> children, and our property? Does the Tathagata teach the doctrine of a
> complete self-surrender, so that I should suffer the evil-doer to do
> what he pleases, and yield submissively to him who threatens to take
> by violence what is my own? Does the Tathagata maintain that all
> strifes, including such warfare as is waged for a righteous cause,
> should be forbidden?"  
>  20. The Lord replied : "The Tathagata says: 'He who deserves
> punishment must be punished, and he who is worthy of favour must be
> favoured.' Yet at the same time he teaches to do no injury to any
> living being, but to be full of love and kindness. These injunctions
> are not contradictory, for whosoever must be punished for the crimes
> which he has committed suffers his injury not through the ill-will of
> the judge, but on account of his evil-doing. His own acts have brought
> upon him the injury that the executor of the law inflicts. When a
> magistrate punishes, let him not harbour hatred in his breast; yet a
> murderer, when put to death, should consider that this is the fruit of
> his own act. As soon as he will understand that the punishment will
> purify his soul, he will no longer lament his fate but rejoice at
> it."  
>  21. A proper understanding of these instances would show that the
> Ahimsa taught by the Blessed Lord was fundamental. But it was not
> absolute.  
>  22. He taught that evil should be cured by the return of good. But
> he never preached that evil should be allowed to overpower good.  
>  23. He stood for Ahimsa. He denounced Hirnsa. But he did not deny
> that Hirnsa may be the last resort to save good being destroyed by
> evil.  
>  24. Thus it is not that the Blessed Lord taught a dangerous
> doctrine. It is the critics who failed to understand its significance
> and its scope.
>
>   
> § 4. Charge of Preaching Virtue and Creating Gloom
>
> (4.i) Dukkha as the Cause of Gloom
>
>  1. Dukkha in its original sense given to it by Kapila means
> unrest, commotion.  
>  2. Initially it had a metaphysical meaning.  
>  3. Later on it acquired the meaning of suffering arid sorrow  
>  4. The two senses were not far detached. They were very close.  
>  5. Unrest brings sorrow and suffering.  
>  6. Soon it acquired the meaning of sorrow and suffering from
> social and economic causes.  
>  7. In what sense did the Buddha use the word 'sorrow and
> suffering'?  
>  8. There is a sermon on record from which it is clear that the
> Buddha was very much aware that poverty was a cause of sorrow.  
>  9. In that sermon he says: "Monks, is poverty a woeful thing for a
> worldly wanton?"  
>  10. "Surely, Lord."  
>  11. "And when a man is poor, needy, in straits, he gets into debt,
> and is that woeful too?"  
>  12. "Surely, Lord."  
>  13. "And when he gets into debt, he borrows, and is that woeful
> too?"  
>  14. "Surely, Lord."  
>  15. "And when the bill falls due, he pays not, and they press him;
> is that woeful too?"  
>  16. "Surely, Lord."  
>  17. "And when pressed, he pays not, and they beset him; is that
> woeful too?"  
>  18. "Surely, Lord."  
>  19. "And when beset, he pays not, and they bind him; is that
> woeful too?"  
>  20. "Surely, Lord."  
>  21. "Thus, monks, poverty, debt, borrowing, being pressed, beset,
> and bound, are all woes for the worldly wanton.  
>  22. "Woeful in the world is poverty and debt."  
>  23. Thus the Buddha's conception of Dukkha is material.
>
> (4.ii) Impermanence as the Cause of Gloom
>
>  1. Another ground for this accusation arises from the doctrine
> that everything which is compound is impermanent.  
>  2. Nobody questions the truth of the doctrine.  
>  3. 'Everything is impermanent' is admitted by all.  
>  4. The doctrine, if it is true, must be told, just as truth must
> be told, however unpleasant it may be.  
>  5. But why draw a pessimistic conclusion?  
>  6. If life is short, it is short; and one need not be gloomy about
> it.  
>  7. It is just a matter of interpretation.  
>  8. The Burmese interpretation is very much different.  
>  9. The Burmese celebrate the event of death in a family, as though
> it was an event of joy.  
>  10. On the day of death the householder gives a public feast, and
> the people remove the dead body to the graveyard dancing. Nobody minds
> the death, for it was to come.  
>  11. If impermanence is pessimistic, it is only because permanence
> was assumed to be true--although it was a false one.  
>  12. Buddha's preaching cannot, therefore, be charged as spreading
> gloom.
>
> (4.iii) Is Buddhism Pessimistic?
>
>  1. The Buddha's Dhamma has been accused of creating pessimism.  
>  2. The accusation arises from the first Aryan Truth, which says
> that there is Dukkha (sorrow-misery) in the world.  
>  3. It is rather surprising that a reference to Dukkha should give
> cause to \[=for\] such an accusation.  
>  4. Karl Marx also said that there is exploitation in the world,
> and the rich are being made richer and the poor are being made
> poorer.  
>  5. And yet nobody has said that Karl Marx's doctrine is
> pessimism.  
>  6. Why then should a different attitude be shown to the Buddha's
> doctrine?  
>  7. It may be because the Buddha is reported to have said in his
> first sermon, 'birth is sorrowful, old age is sorrowful, death is
> sorrowful', that a deeper pessimistic colouring has been given to his
> Dhamma.  
>  8. But those who know rhetoric know that this is an artifice of
> exaggeration, and that it is practised by skilled literary hands to
> produce effect.  
>  9. That 'birth is sorrowful' is an exaggeration by the Buddha can
> be proved by reference to a sermon of his in which he has preached
> that birth as a human being is a very precious thing.  
>  10. Again, if the Buddha had merely referred to Dukkha, such an
> accusation could be sustainable.  
>  11. But the Buddha's second Aryan Truth emphasises that this
> Dukkha must be removed. In order to emphasise the duty of removal of
> Dukkha, he spoke of the existence of Dukkha.  
>  12. To the removal of Dukkha, the Buddha attached great
> importance. It is because he found that Kapila merely stated that
> there was Dukkha, and said nothing more about it, that he felt
> dissatisfied and left the Ashram of Muni Alara Kalam.  
>  13. How can this Dhamma be called pessimistic?  
>  14. Surely a teacher who is anxious to remove Dukkha cannot be
> charged with pessimism.
>
>   
> § 5. Critics of the Theory of Soul and Rebirth
>
>  1. The Blessed Lord preached that there was no Soul. The Blessed
> Lord also affirmed that there was rebirth.  
>  2. There were not wanting people who criticised the Lord for
> preaching what they regarded as two such contradictory doctrines.  
>  3. 'How can there be rebirth if there is no Soul?' they asked.  
>  4. There is no contradiction. There can be rebirth even though
> there is no Soul.  
>  5. There is a mango stone. The stone gives rise to a mango tree.
> The mango tree produces mangoes.  
>  6. Here is rebirth of a mango.  
>  7. But there is no Soul.  
>  8. So there can be rebirth although there is no Soul.
>
>   
> § 6. Charge of Being an Annihilationist
>
>  1. Once when the Lord was staying at Shravasti in Jeta's grove it
> was reported to him that a certain bhikkhu, by name Arittha, had come
> to certain views about the doctrines taught by the Lord, as the views
> of the Lord, although they were not the views of the Lord.  
>  2. One of the doctrines about which Arittha was misrepresenting
> the Lord was whether he was an annihilationist.  
>  3. The Blessed Lord sent for Arittha. Arittha came. On being
> questioned, he sat silent and glum.  
>  4. The Lord then said to him, "Some recluses and Brahmins wrongly,
> erroneously, and falsely charge me, in defiance of facts, with being
> an annihilationist, and with preaching disintegration and extirpation
> of existing creatures.  
>  5. It is just what I am not, and what I do not affirm.  
>  6. What I have consistently preached, both in the past and today,
> is the existence of ill and the ending of ill.  
>
