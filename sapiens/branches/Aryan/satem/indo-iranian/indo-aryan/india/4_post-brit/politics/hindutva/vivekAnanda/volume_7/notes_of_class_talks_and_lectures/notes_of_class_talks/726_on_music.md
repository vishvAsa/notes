## ON MUSIC

There is science in Dhrupad, Kheyal, etc., but it is in Kirtana, i.e. in
Māthura and Viraha and other like compositions that there is real music
— for there is feeling. Feeling is the soul, the secret of everything.
There is more music in common people's songs, and they should be
collected together. The science of Dhrupad etc., applied to the music of
Kirtana will produce the perfect music.
