> SECTION ONE--SERMONS FOR HOUSEHOLDERS  
>   
> § 1. The Happy Householder
>
>  1. Once Anathapindika came to where the Exalted One was, made
> obeisance to the Exalted One, and took a seat at one side.  
>  2. Anathapindika was anxious to know wherein lay the happiness of
> a householder.  
>  3. Accordingly Anathapindika asked the Lord to explain to him the
> secret of the householder's happiness.  
>  4. The Lord said, first is the happiness of possession. A
> householder is possessed of wealth, justly and righteously acquired by
> great industry, amassed by strength of the arm, and earned by sweat
> (of the brow). At the thought "I am possessed of wealth justly gained"
> he gains happiness.  
>  5. Second is the happiness of enjoyment. A householder is
> possessed of wealth justly and righteously acquired by great industry
> amassed by strength of the arm, and earned by sweat (of the brow),
> enjoys his wealth, and performs acts of merit. Thus at the thought "I
> am doing meritorious deeds with my wealth which was justly gained" and
> so forth, he gains happiness.  
>  6. Third is the happiness of freedom from debt. A householder owes
> no one any debt great or small, thus he gains happiness; thus he at
> the thought of "I owe no man anything" and so forth, gains
> happiness.  
>  7. Fourth is the happiness of blamelessness. A householder who is
> endowed with blameless action of body, blameless speech, and blameless
> thinking, gains happiness of blamelessness.  
>  8. Verily, Anathapindika, these four kinds of happiness are
> constantly obtainable by the householder, if he strives for them.
>
>   
> § 2. \[A\] Daughter may be better than a Son
>
>  1. When the Exalted One was once at Shravasti, the king of the
> Kosalas, Pasendi, had come to visit him.  
>  2. While the king was engaged in a conversation with the Blessed
> Lord, a messenger from the Palace arrived and, approaching the king,
> announced to his private ear that Queen Mallika had given birth to a
> daughter.  
>  3. The king appeared very sad and depressed. The Blessed Lord
> asked the king the reason of his sadness.  
>  4. The king replied that he had just received the sad news that
> Queen Mallika had given birth to a daughter.  
>  5. Thereupon the Exalted One, discerning the matter said: "A woman
> child, O lord of men, may prove even a better offspring than a male.
> For she may grow up wise and virtuous, her husband's mother
> reverencing true wife, a daughter.  
>  6. The boy that she may bear may do great deeds and rule great
> realms; yea, such a son of a noble wife becomes his country's guide."
>
>   
> § 3. Husband and Wife
>
>  1. At one time, the Exalted One had entered the high road between
> Madhura and Neranja. Also many householders and their wives had joined
> the high road between Madhura and Neranja.  
>  2. Then the Exalted One, having left the road, took a seat under a
> certain tree, and these householders and their wives saw the Exalted
> One seated under it.  
>  3. So seeing, they came to where the Exalted One was. Having come,
> they made obeisance to the Exalted One and sat at one side, and asked
> the Blessed One the right relations between the husband and wife. To
> the householders and their wives so seated, the Exalted One spake
> thus:  
>  4. "Householders, there are four ways for a husband and wife, of
> living together. A vile man lives with a vile woman, a vile man lives
> with a goddess, a god lives with a vile woman and a god lives with a
> goddess.  
>  5. "Householders! A husband kills, steals, commits impurity, lies
> and indulges in fermented liquor; is wicked and sinful; with his heart
> possessed by avarice he lives the life of a householder, and abuses
> and reviles virtuous people. Also his wife kills, steals, commits
> impurity, lies, and indulges in fermented liquor; is wicked and
> sinful; with her heart possessed by avarice, she lives the life of the
> family, and abuses and reviles virtuous people. Thus indeed,
> householders, a vile man lives with a vile woman.  
>  6. "Householders! A husband kills, steals, commits impurity, lies
> and indulges in fermented liquor; is wicked and sinful; with his heart
> possessed by avarice, he lives the life of a householder, and abuses
> and reviles virtuous people. But his wife abstains from killing,
> thieving, sexual impurity, lying, and indulgence in fermented liquor.
> His wife is virtuous and of good behaviour; with her heart freed from
> the taint of avarice she lives the family life, and abuses not, nor
> reviles, virtuous people. Thus indeed, house-holders, a vile man lives
> with a goddess.  
>  7. "Householders! A husband abstains from killing, thieving,
> impurity, lying and indulgence in fermented liquor; is virtuous and of
> good behaviour; with his mind freed from the stains of avarice, he
> lives the family life and abuses not, nor reviles, virtuous people.
> But his wife kills, steals, commits impurity, lies and indulges in
> fermented liquor, is wicked and sinful; with her heart possessed by
> avarice she lives the family life, and abuses and reviles virtuous
> people. Thus indeed, householders, a god lives with a vile woman.  
>  8. "Householders! Herein, a husband and a wife both abstain from
> killing, thieving, impurity, lying, and indulgence in fermented
> liquor; are virtuous and of good behaviour; with mind freed from
> taints of avarice they live the family life and abuse not, nor revile,
> virtuous people. Thus indeed, householders, a god lives with a
> goddess.  
>  9. "These, householders, are the four ways of living together."  
> 
>
> SECTION TWO--SERMONS ON THE NEED FOR MAINTAINING CHARACTER  
>   
> § 1. What Constitutes the Downfall of Man
>
>  1. On one occasion, the Blessed One was dwelling in the monastery
> of Anathapindika, in the Jeta Grove, near Shravasti.  
>  2. Now when the night was far spent, a certain Deva, whose
> splendour illuminated the whole Jeta Grove, came to the presence of
> the Blessed One and, drawing near, respectfully saluted him and stood
> at one side. Standing thus, he addressed the Blessed One in verse:  
>  3. "Having come to interrogate the Blessed One, I ask thee, O
> Gautama, about the falling man. Pray, tell me the cause of one's
> downfall." The Blessed One consented to explain the causes of man's
> downfall.  
>  4. "Easily known is the progressive one, easily known is the
> declining one. A lover of the Dhamma is the progressive one, a hater
> of the Dhamma is the declining one.  
>  5. "The vicious are dear to him, in the virtuous he finds nothing
> pleasing; he favours the creeds of the vicious--this is the second
> cause of one's downfall.  
>  6. "The man who is drowsy, fond of society, not industrious,
> indolent, and who manifests anger--this is the third cause of one's
> downfall.  
>  7. "Whosoever, being rich, does. not support his aged mother and
> father, who have passed their youth--this is the fourth cause of one's
> downfall.  
>  8. "He who, by falsehood, deceives a Brahmana or an ascetic or any
> other medicant--this is the fifth cause of one's downfall.  
>  9. "The man who owns much property, who has gold and food, but
> alone enjoys his delicacies--this is the sixth cause of one's
> downfall.  
>  10. "The man who prides \[=takes pride\] in birth or wealth or
> clan, and despises his own kinsmen--this is the seventh cause of one's
> downfall.  
>  11. "The man who is a debauchee, \[a\] drunkard, a gambler, who
> squanders whatever he possesses--this is the eighth cause of one's
> downfall.  
>  12. "Not contented with one's own wives, if one is seen amongst
> courtesans and the wives of others--this is the ninth cause of one's
> downfall.  
>  13. "He who places in authority an intemperate spend-thrift woman,
> or a man of similar nature--this is the eleventh cause of one's
> downfall.  
>  14. "He who, of slender means but vast ambition, of warrior birth,
> aspires to sovereignty--this is the twelfth cause of one's downfall.  
>  15. "Know these causes of downfall, ye noble Deva, and if ye
> succeed in overcoming them ye will be saved."
>
>   
> §2. The Wicked Man
>
>  1. The Blessed Lord, while he was on \[a\] journey, gave, as was
> his usual practice, the following discourse to the Bhikkhus who were
> accompanying him.  
>  2. Addressing the Bhikkhus, the Lord said: "Do you know how to
> recognise a wicked man?" "No, Lord," replied the Bhikkhus.  
>  3. "I will tell you the characteristics of a wicked man.  
>  4. "There is a man who shows up the faults of another even when
> unasked, not to say \[=not to speak of\] when asked. Being indeed
> asked and plied with questions, he speaks ill of another without
> suppressing or concealing, but with full details. Brethren, such a man
> is a wicked man.  
>  5. "There is a man who, being asked, does not point out the good
> qualities of another, not to say \[=not to speak of\] when unasked.
> Being indeed asked and plied with questions, he speaks well of
> another.  
>  6. "There is a man who, being asked, does not disclose his own bad
> qualities, not to say \[=not to speak of\] when unasked. Being indeed
> asked and plied with questions, he points out his own bad qualities,
> but suppresses and conceals them and does not give full details.
> Brethren, such a man is a wicked man.  
>  7. "Then again, brethren, there is a man who, even unasked,
> discloses his good qualities, not to say \[=not to speak of\] when
> asked. Brethren, being asked and plied with questions, be points out
> his own good qualities without suppressing or concealing them and
> giving full details. Brethren, such a man is a wicked man."
>
>   
> § 3. The Best Man
>
>  1. The Blessed One, while he was on journey, gave, as was his
> practice, the following discourse to the Bhikkhus who were
> accompanying him:  
>  2. Addressing the Bhikkhus, the Lord said: "There are four classes
> of persons, brethren, to be found in the world.  
>  3. "He who has not striven for his own welfare, nor that of
> others; he who has striven for others' welfare, but not his own; he
> who has striven for his own welfare, but not others'; he who has
> striven for both his own welfare, and that of others.  
>  4. "One who has striven neither for his own welfare nor for that
> of others is like a torch from a funeral pyre, lit at both ends, and
> in the middle smeared with dung. He kindles no fuel either in village
> or in forest. He is useless to the world. And he is useless to
> himself.  
>  5. "One who has striven for the welfare of others at the cost of
> his own, is both excellent and eminent of the two.  
>  6. "Then again, brethren, in the case of the person who has
> striven both for his own welfare and for that of others--of these four
> persons this is best and chief, topmost and highest and supreme."
>
>   
> § 4. The Enlightened Man
>
>  1. At one time, the Exalted One had reached the high road between
> (the two towns of) Ukkattha and Setabbya. Then the Brahmin named Dona
> had also reached the high road between Ukkattha and Setabbya.  
>  2. Just then the Exalted One left the road and sat down at the
> foot of a tree, cross-legged. Then Dona the Brahman, following the
> footsteps of the Exalted One, saw him seated at the foot of that tree,
> resplendent and of a comely ppearance, with sense controlled, with
> mind appeased, supremely tamed, restrained and powerful. So seeing, he
> approached where the Exalted One was.  
>  3. Having come he said thus to him:
>
> > "Is not the Venerable One a Deva?"  
> > "Brahman, I am indeed not a Deva."  
> > "Is not the Venerable One then a Gandhabba?"  
> > "Brahman, I am indeed not a Gandhabba."  
> > "Is not the Venerable One then a Yakkha?"  
> > "Brahman, I am indeed not a Yakkha."  
> > "Is not the Venerable One then a man?"  
> > "Brahman, I am indeed not a man."
>
>  4. Having heard the Blessed One reply thus, the Brahman Dona said:
>
> > "When thou art asked: Are ye a Deva? Thou sayest: No.  
> > When Thou art questioned: Are ye a Gandhabba? Thou sayest: No.  
> > When Thou art asked: Are ye a Yakkha? Thou sayest: No.  
> > When Thou art questioned: Are ye then a man? Thou sayest: No.  
> > Who then can the Venerable One be?"
>
>  5. "Brahman, verily I was a Deva, a Gandhabba, Yakkha, a man, so
> long as I had not purged myself of the intoxicants. These very
> intoxicants have I now given up--with roots cut out like unto a
> palm-tree with its base destroyed and rendered unable to sprout
> again--so that in future they do not come into existence.  
>  6. "Just as a lotus or a water-lily born of the water, grown in
> the water, risen out of the water, stands unstained by the water, even
> so, Brahman, being born of the world, grown in the world, having
> overcome the world, I abide unstained by the world.  
>  7. "Therefore, 0 Brahman, consider me as the Enlightened One."
>
>   
> §5. Man—Just and Good
>
>  1. Addressing the Brethren, the Lord said, "There are four classes
> of persons whom you must learn to distinguish, if you wish to
> ascertain who are good and just.  
>  2. "Brethren, there is a class of persons who strive for their own
> welfare, but not that of others.  
>  3. "Brethren, herein a certain person practises the extirpation of
> lust in himself, but does not urge the extirpation of lust in others;
> practises the extirpation of ill-will in himself, but does not urge
> the extirpation of ill-will in others; and also practises the
> extirpation of ignorance in himself, but does not urge the extirpation
> of ignorance in others.  
>  4. "Indeed, Brethren, this is the person who pursues his own
> welfare, but not the welfare of others.  
>  5. "Brethren, there is a class of persons who have striven for
> others' welfare, but not their own.  
>  6. "Brethren, herein a certain person does not practise the
> extirpation of lust, ill-will, and ignorance in himself, but urges the
> extirpation of lust, ill-will, and ignorance in others.  
>  7. "Indeed, Brethren, this is the person who has. striven for
> others' welfare, but not his own.  
>  8. "Brethren, there is a class of persons who strive not, neither
> for their own welfare nor that of others.  
>  9. "Brethren, herein a certain person practises not the
> extirpation of lust, ill-will, and ignorance in himself, nor urges the
> extirpation of lust, ill-will, and ignorance in others.  
>  10. "Brethren, this is the person that has not striven for his own
> welfare nor that of others.  
>  11. "Brethren, there is a class of persons who strive for their
> own welfare as well as that of others.  
>  12. "Brethren, herein a certain person both practises the
> extirpation of lust, ill-will, and ignorance in himself, and also
> urges the extirpation of lust, ill-will, and ignorance in others.  
>  13. "Brethren, this is the person who has striven for his own
> welfare as well as that of others.  
>  14. "This last person is to be deemed just and good."
>
>   
> § 6. Need for Doing Good Deeds
>
>  1. On one occasion, thus spake the Exalted One to the Brethren.  
>  2. "Be not afraid of good works, brethren. It is another name for
> happiness, for what is desired, beloved, dear, and delightful, this
> word 'good works'. I myself, brethren, can bear witness to having
> reaped for many a long day the profit of good works, a thing desired,
> beloved, dear, and delightful.  
>  3. "I often ask 'Of what deeds is all this the fruit? Of what deed
> is it the ripening, in that I am now thus happy and contented?'  
>  4. "The answer that comes to me is: 'Of three deeds this is the
> fruit. Of three deeds this is the ripening, the deeds of Charity,
> Self-taming, and Self-control.'  
>  5. "Auspicious, festive, happy, blessed dawn! Fair day, glad time
> is that when alms are given to worthy ones; when goodly acts, words,
> thoughts, right aspirations, bring auspicious gain to those that
> practise them.  
>  6. "Happy are they that win such gain, and prosperous in the way!
> So be ye also prosperous in the way, free from disease and happy with
> your kin."
>
>   
> § 7. Need for Making Good Resolutions
>
>  1. Once when he was at Shravasti in Jeta's Grove, the Exalted One
> said to the Brethren:  
>  2. "Brethren, there is a great need of good resolutions to be made
> and observed for a pure and happy life.  
>  3. "I will tell you what your resolutions should be.  
>  4. "Resolve that, 'all my life long may I support my parents. May
> I respect the head of my clan. May I be of gentle speech. May I speak
> evil of none. Clearing my heart of the stain of selfishness, may I
> dwell at home generous, pure-handed, delighting in giving up, may I be
> a proper man to ask a boon of, delighting in sharing gifts with
> others.  
>  5. "'All my life long, may I be angerless, and, if anger arise,
> may I quickly check it."  
>  6. Such are the seven resolutions, Brethren, by undertaking and
> performing which you will attain the state of happiness and purity.  
> 
>
> SECTION THREE--SERMONS ON RIGHTEOUSNESS  
>   
> §1 What is Righteousness
>
>  1. Once when the Lord was on an alms-pilgrimage in Kosala, with a
> great train of almsmen, he came to a Brahmin village of the Kosalans
> named Sala.  
>  2. It came to the ears of the Brahmin heads of families in Sala
> that the Blessed Lord had come to their village in the course of an
> alms-pilgrimage in Kosala.  
>  3. They felt it was good to go and visit him. So the Brahmins of
> Sala went to the Lord and, after exchanging civil greetings, took
> their seats on one side.  
>  4. They asked the Blessed One if he would explain to them what he
> meant by righteousness.  
>  5. So to the attentive Brahmins the Lord said: "There are three
> forms of unrighteousness and wickedness for the body; four for speech;
> and three for thoughts.  
>  6. "As regards bodily unrighteousness, a man (i) may take life, as
> a hunter with hands bathed in blood, given to killing and slaying,
> merciless to living creatures; or (ii) may take what is not his, by
> appropriating to himself in thievish fashion the belongings of other
> people in village and jungle; or (iii) may be a fornicator, having
> intercourse with girls under the charge of mother or father or brother
> or sister or relations--yes, with girls affianced and plighted and
> even wearing the very garlands of betrothal.  
>  7. "As regards unrighteousness of speech a man (i) may be a liar;
> when cited to give testimony before assembly or village-meeting or
> family council or royal household or his guild, he may say that he
> knows when he does not know, or that he does not know when he does
> know, or that he saw when he did not see, or that he did not see when
> he did see, deliberately lying in the interests either of himself or
> of other people or for some trifling gain. Or (ii) he may be a
> slanderer; repeating here what he has heard elsewhere so as to set one
> set of people by the ears, and repeating elsewhere what he has heard
> here so as to set another set of people by the ears; he is a dissolver
> of harmony and a fomenter of strife; discord prompts his utterances,
> discord being his pleasure, his joy, and his delight. Or (iii) he may
> be bitter of tongue; what he says is rough and harsh, hurtful and
> wounding to others, provocative of anger, and leading to distraction.
> Or (iv) he may be a tattler talking out of season, without heed to
> fact, always talking of the unprofitable, never of the Doctrine, never
> of the Rule, but ever of the trivial, of the ill-timed, of the
> frivolous, of things leading nowhere and unprofitable.  
>  8. "As regards unrighteousness of thought, a man (i) may be
> covetous, coveting other people's gear with the yearning that it were
> all his own. Or (ii) he may be malevolent and wicked of heart, wishing
> that creatures around him might be killed, destroyed, annihilated, or
> cease to be. Or (iii) he may be wrong in outlook and erroneous in his
> conceptions, holding that there are no such things as alms or
> sacrifice or oblations, that there is no such things as the fruit and
> harvest of deeds good and bad, that there is no such thing as this
> world or any other, that there are no such things as either parents or
> relations elsewhere, that there are no such things in the world as
> recluses and Brahmins who, having trodden the right path and walked
> aright, have, of and by themselves, comprehended and realized this and
> other worlds and made it all known to others too.  
>  9. "Contrariwise, there are three forms of righteousness and
> goodness for the body; four for speech, and three for thoughts.  
>  10. "As regards bodily righteousness, a man (i) puts from him all
> killing and abstains from killing anything; laying aside cudgel and
> sword, he lives a life of innocence and mercy, full of kindliness and
> compassion for everything that lives. (ii) Theft he puts from him, and
> eschews taking from others except what is given to him by them; he
> lives an honest life. (iii) Putting from him all sensual misconduct,
> he abstains from fornication; he has no intercourse with girls under
> the charge of mother or father or brother or sister or relations, no
> intercourse with girls affianced and plighted and with the garlands of
> betrothal upon them.  
>  11. "As regards righteousness in speech, (i) a man puts lying from
> him and abstains from lies; when cited to give testimony before
> assembly or village-meeting or family council or royal household or
> his guild, he says that he does not know when he does not, and that he
> does know when he does, says that he did not see when he did not see
> and that he saw when he did see, never deliberately lying in the
> interests of himself or of other people or for some trifling gain.
> (ii) All slander he puts from him, and from slandering he abstains;
> what he hears here he does not repeat elsewhere so to set one set of
> people by the ears, nor does he repeat here what he hears elsewhere so
> as to set another set of people by the ears; he is a promoter of
> harmony and a restorer of amity, for concord is his pleasure, his joy,
> and his delight. (iii) There is no bitterness in his tongue, and he
> abstains from bitter speech; what he says is without gall, pleasant,
> friendly hearty, urbane, agreeable, and welcome to all. (iv) No
> tattler, he abstains from tattle, speaking in season, according to
> fact, always of the profitable, of the Doctrine and Rule, in speech
> which is seasonable and memorable, illuminating, well-marshalled, and
> of great profit.  
>  12. "As regards righteousness in thoughts, (i) a man is devoid of
> covetousness, never coveting other people's gear with the yearning
> that it were all his own. (ii) He harbours no malevolence or
> wickedness of thought; his wish is that creatures around him may live
> on in peace and happiness, safe from all enmity and oppression. (iii)
> He is right in outlook and correct in his conceptions.  
>  13. "This is what I mean by righteousness and unrighteousness."
>
>   
> §2. Need for Righteousness
>
>  1. Then the Exalted One addressed the lay brethren of
> Pataligama:  
>  2. "There are losses, householders, which attend the wicked and
> immoral man.  
>  3. "The wicked, immoral man, as the result of sloth, comes to
> great loss of wealth.

> § 3. Righteousness and the Claims of the World
>
>  1. Once when the Lord was staying at Rajagraha in the Bamboo grove
> where the squirrels were fed, the reverend Sariputta was making an
> alms pilgrimage with a great train of almsmen among the Southern
> Hills.  
>  2. On his way he met an almsman who had spent the rainy season at
> Rajagraha. After interchange of greetings of friendliness and
> civility, Sariputta enquired after the Master's health and was told he
> was well, as too was the Confraternity, and also the Brahmin
> Dhananjani of Tandula-pala Gate in Rajagraha, concerning whose health
> too Sariputta had made enquiries.  
>  3. "And is the Brahmin, Dhananjani, zealous and earnest?" asked
> Sariputta further of the Almsman.  
>  4. "How could earnest zeal possibly dwell in Dhananjani?" replied
> theAlmsman. "He uses the king to fleece the Brahmins and householders,
> and uses them to fleece the king. Also, his pious wife, who came of a
> pious stock is dead now; and he has taken to himself another wife who
> is not pious and comes of no pious stock."  
>  5. "This is bad news, very bad news, to hear of Dhananjani's lack
> of zeal," said Sariputta. "Perhaps, however, at some time and place I
> may meet him. I should like to have a talk with him."  
>  6. After staying as. long as he wanted in the Southern Hills,
> Sariputta proceeded on his alms pilgrimage till he reached Rajagraha,
> where he took up his abode in the Bamboo Grove.  
>  7. Early in the morning, bowl in hand and duly robed, he went into
> Rajagraha for alms, at a time when the Brahmin Dhananjani was out of
> the city seeing his cows milked in the byre.  
>  8. On his return after his round and meal, Sariputta sought out
> the Brahmin. Seeing him coming, the Brahmin came to meet him, with the
> remark that they had time for a draught of milk before meal-time.  
>  9. "Not so, Brahmin, I have had my meal today, and shall be
> resting under the shade of a tree during the noontide. Come to me
> there."  
>  10. Dhananjani agreed, and after his own meal joined Sariputta,
> seating himself by him after friendly greetings.  
>  11. Said Sariputta: "May I rest assured, Dhananjani, that zeal and
> earnestness and righteousness are yours?"  
>  12. "How can that be, when I have to support my parents, my wife
> and family, and my slaves and serving folk, and have to entertain my
> cquaintances and friends, my kith and kin, and guests, and have also
> to provide for my kinsfolk dead and gone, and for the deities, and for
> the king, not to speak of supporting myself in meat and drink?"  
>  13. "What think you, Dhananjani? If we suppose a man who, for his
> parents' sake, has departed from righteousness and equity, and is
> being hauled up \[in court\], would it avail him either to plead on
> his own behalf that it was for his parents' sake that he had departed
> from righteousness and equity, and that therefore he should not be
> hauled up?"  
>  14. "No; despite all appeals, the wardens would cast him into
> prison."  
>  15. "Would it avail him either to plead on his own behalf, or to
> have his wife and family plead for him, that it was for their sake he
> had departed from righteousness and equity?"  
>  16. "No."  
>  17. "Would it avail him if his slaves and serving folk pleaded for
> him?"  
>  18. "Not a whit."  
>  19. "Or if his friends and acquaintances pleaded for him?"  
>  20. "Not a whit."  
>  21. "Or if his kith and kin, or his guests, pleaded for him?"  
>  22. "Not a whit."  
>  23. "Or if his kinsfolk dead and gone pleaded the claims of his
> deities, or his monarch's claims on him?"  
>  24. "Not a whit."  
>  25. "Would it avail him to plead on his own behalf, or to have
> others pleading for him, that it was to support himself in meat and
> drink that he departed from righteousness and equity?"  
>  26. "No."  
>  27. "What think you, Dhananjani? Which is the better man? He that
> for the sake of his parents departs from righteousness and equity, or
> he that no matter what happens to them walks in righteousness and
> equity?  
>  28. "The latter," replied Dhananjani, "for to walk in
> righteousness and equity is better than to depart therefrom."  
>  29. "Moreover, Dhananjani, there are other courses of action which
> are justified and righteous in themselves, whereby he can support his
> parents, and yet avoid evildoing and walk uprightly. Now, does the
> same reasoning apply to the support of wife and family and everything
> else?"  
>  30. "It does, Sariputta."  
>  31. Hereupon the Brahmin, rejoicing in what the reverend Sariputta
> had said, thanked him, rose up and went his way.
>
>   
> § 4. How to Reach Perfection in Righteous Conduct
>
>  1. Once while the Lord was staying at Shravasti in Jeta's Grove,
> there came to him five hundred lay-followers. One of them was
> Dhammika.  
>  2. Dhammika asked the Lord: "What principles make your followers
> reach perfection in righteous conduct?  
>  3. "I ask thee this question because thou art the most matchless
> judge of the weal of men.  
>  4. "Trained Jains and Mendicants all failed to vanquish thee.
> Trained Brahmins, ripe in years, with others keen to air their point
> of view, are led to embrace thy saving truth. For, 'tis thy saving
> Truth, subtle, but preached so well, for which all yearn. Vouchsafe an
> answer, Lord, to us!  
>  5. "Let the lay-followers learn from thy lips thy Lore
> immaculate!"  
>  6. The Blessed Lord in compassion for his lay-followers said:
> "Give me your ear. I will explain the principles of righteous conduct.
> Hear and follow them.  
>  7. "Slay not, nor doom to death, nor sanction slaughter. Do no
> violence to aught that lives, strong or weak.  
>  8. "No layman, wittingly, should thieve, or order theft, or
> sanction any theft; take but what others give.  
>  9. "And shun incontinence as 'twere a pit of fire; or, failing
> continence, debauch no wedded wife.  
>  10. "In conclaves, courts, or talk, let him not lie; let him not
> prompt or sanction lies; let him renounce untruth.  
>  11. "Layman, observe this law: shun drink; make no man drink;
> sanction no drinking. Mark how drink to madness leads.  
>  12. "Through drink fools sin, and egg lax brethren on to sin. So
> flee this maddening vice, this folly, bliss of fools.  
>  13. "Slay not, nor steal, nor lie; from strong drink keep away;
> refrain from lechery; touch not wrong meals at night!  
>  14. "Eschew both scents and wreaths; spread on the ground thy bed;
> so make thy sabbath vows as week succeeds to week, and keep with pious
> hearts this eightfold festival.  
>  15. "At morn, these vows performed, with pious, thankful heart, be
> wise, and of thy means give Almsmen food and drink.  
>  16. "Cherish thy parents well; follow a righteous trade. Thus
> shall the layman staunch reach realms of light above.
>
>   
> § 5. One Need Not Wait for a Companion to Tread on the Path of
> Righteousness
>
>  1. An elephant in battle bears the arrow at him buried; I must
> bear men's bitter tongues for every evil in the world.  
>  2. Tamed, they lead him into battle; tamed, the king his back
> ascends; tamed, is he the best of beings, when no bitter speech
> offends.  
>  3. Good are well-tamed mules, and good are Cindian steeds of
> lineage famed; good indeed the mighty tusker; best of all the men
> self-tamed.  
>  4. Yet such mounts can naught avail us, cannot be Nibbana's guide.
> We can only reach the Path on the self-tamed self-ride.  
>  5. Take delight in Earnestness; watch thy thoughts and never tire.
> Lift thee from the Path of Evil, take the Tusker out of mire.  
>  6. Hast thou found a fellow-traveller, upright, firm, intelligent?
> Leaving all thy cares behind thee, gladly walk with him intent.  
>  7. Hast thou found no fellow-traveller, upright, intelligent? As a
> King deserts his borders, by the enemy pursued, like the tusker in the
> forest, so go thy way in solitude.  
>  8. Better is the lonely life, for fools companions cannot be. Live
> alone and do no evil, live alone with scanty needs, lonely as the
> mighty tusker in the forest lonely feeds.  
>  9. Expunge all bad thoughts.  
>  10. Here is the way to expunge \[them\]..  
>  11. You are to expunge \[them\] by resolving that, though others
> may be harmful, you will be harmless.  
>  12. That, though others may kill, you will never kill.  
>  13. That, though others may steal, you will not.  
>  14. That, though others may not lead the higher life, you will.  
>  15. That, though others may lie, traduce, denounce, or prattle,
> you will not.  
>  16. That, though others may be covetous, you will covet not.  
>  17. That, though others may be malignant, you will be benignant.  
>  18. That, though others may be given over to wrong views, wrong
> aims, wrong speech, \[wrong\] actions, wrong modes of livelihood,
> wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, and wrong concentration, you must
> follow the Noble Eight-fold Path in right outlook, right aims, right
> speech, right actions, right mode of livelihood, right efforts, right
> mindfulness, and right concentration.  
>  19. That, though others are wrong about the truth and wrong about
> Deliverance, you will be right about truth and right about
> Deliverance.  
>  20. That, though others may be possessed by sloth and torpor, you
> will free yourself therefrom.  
>  21. That, though others may be puffed up, you will be

>  22. That, though others may be perplexed by doubts, you will be

>  23. That, though others may harbour wrath, malevolence, envy,

> SECTION FOUR--SERMONS ON NIBBANA  
>   
> § 1. What is Nibbana?
>
>  1. Once the Blessed Lord was staying at Shravasti in
> Anathapindika's Ashrama, where Sariputta was also staying.  
>  2. The Lord, addressing the Brethren, said: "Almsmen, be ye
> partakers not of the world's goods, but of my doctrine; in my
> compassion for you all I am anxious to ensure this."  
>  3. Thus spoke the Lord, who thereupon rose and passed to his own
> cell.  
>  4. Sariputta remained behind, and the Brethren asked him to
> explain what is Nibbana.  
>  5. Then Sariputta in reply to the Brethren said: "Brethren, know
> you that greed is vile, and vile is resentment.  
>  6. "To shed this greed and this resentment, there is the Middle
> Way, which gives us eyes to see and makes us know, leading us on to
> peace, insight, enlightenment, and Nibbana.  
>  7. "What is this Middle Way? It is naught but the Noble Eight-fold
> Path of right outlook, right aims, right speech, right action, right
> means of livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right
> concentration; this, Almsmen is the Middle Way.  
>  8. "Yes, sirs; anger is vile and malevolence is vile, envy and
> jealousy are vile, niggardliness and avarice are vile, hypocrisy and
> deceit and arrogance are vile, inflation \[boastfulness?\] is vile,
> and indolence is vile.  
>  9. "For the shedding of inflation and indolence there is the
> Middle Way, giving us eyes to see, making us know, and leading us on
> to peace, insight, enlightenment.  
>  10. "Nibbana--which is naught but that Noble Eight-fold Path."  
>  11. Thus spoke the reverend Sariputta—glad at heart, the Almsmen
> rejoiced at what he had said.
>
>   
> § 2. The Roots of Nibbana
>
> (2.i)
>
>  1. Once the venerable Radha came to the Exalted One. Having done
> so, he saluted the Exalted One and sat down on one side. So seated,
> the venerable Radha thus addressed the Exalted One: "Pray, Lord, what
> for is Nibbana?"  
>  2. "Nibbana means release from passion," replied the Lord.  
>  3. "But Nibbana, Lord,--what is the aim of it?"  
>  4. "Rooted in Nibbana, Radha, the righteous life is lived. Nibbana
> is its goal. Nibbana is its end."
>
> (2.ii)
>
>  1. Once the Exalted One was dwelling at Shravasti, in Jeta's
> Grove, at Anathapindika's Park. Then the Exalted One called the
> brethren, saying, "Brethren." "Yes, Lord," replied those brethren to
> the Exalted One. The Exalted One thus spake:  
>  2. "Do ye bear in mind, brethren, the Five Fetters that bind to
> the lower world, as taught by me?"  
>  3. Whereupon the venerable Malunkyaputta said this to the Exalted
> One :  
>  4. "I, Lord, bear in mind those Five Fetters."  
>  5. "And how, Malunkyaputta, do you bear them in mind?"  
>  6. " I bear in mind, Lord, the view of bodyhood, as taught by the
> Exalted One; and wavering, and the moral taint of dependence on rite
> and ritual, the excitement of sensual delight, and malevolence, taught
> by the Exalted One as fetters that bind to the lower world. These are
> the Five Fetters that I bear in mind, Lord."  
>  7. "As taught for whom, Malunkyaputta, do you bear in mind these
> Five Fetters? Will not the wanderers of other views reproach you,
> using the parable of a tender baby for their reproach and saying
> thus:  
>  8. "'But, Malunkyaputta, there can be no bodyhood for a tender
> baby-boy, dull of wits and lying on his back. How, then, can there
> arise in him any view of bodyhood? Yet there is indeed latent in him a
> tendency to the view of bodyhood.  
>  9. "'Likewise, Malunkyaputta, there can be no mental conditions
> for a tender baby-boy, dull of wits and lying on his back. How, then,
> can there be in him any wavering of mental conditions? Yet there is in
> him a latent tendency to wavering.  
>  10. "'So also, Malunkyaputta, he can have no moral practice. How,
> then, can there be in him any moral taint of dependence on rite and
> ritual? Yet he has a latent tendency thereto.  
>  11. "'Again, Malunkyaputta, that tender babe has no sensual
> passions. How, then, can be known the excitement of sensual delight?
> But the tendency is there.  
>  12. "'Lastly, Malunkyaputta, for that tender babe beings do not
> exist. How then can it harbour malevolence against beings? Yet the
> tendency thereto is in him.'  
>  13. "Now, Malunkyaputta, will not those wanderers of other views
> thus reproach you, using for their reproach the parable of that tender
> baby-boy?"  
>  14. When this was said, the venerable Ananda thus addressed the
> Exalted One: "Now is the time, Exalted One. O Wayfarer, now is the
> time for the Exalted One to set."  
> 
>
> SECTION FIVE--SERMONS ON DHAMMA  
>   
> § 1. Why Right Views Rank First
>
>  1. Of the noble Eightfold Plath the noblest is Right Outlook.  
>  2. Right thinking is the preface and the key to every thing else
> in the higher life, and ignorance \[sic\].  
>  3. The lack of understanding is the root of all evil.  
>  4. For developing right outlook, one must see all phenomena of
> life as a process of causal law. To have right outlook is to recognise
> the law of cause and effect.  
>  5. "Whatsoever individual, brethren, follows perverted views,
> perverted aim, perverted speech or acts or living, perverted effort,
> attention, and contemplation; whose knowledge and emancipation are
> perverted--for him every action of deed, word or thought, performed
> and achieved according to such perverted views; every willed act,
> every aspiration, every resolve, all his activities; these things one
> and all conduce to what is distasteful, unpleasing, repulsive,
> unprofitable, and painful. And why so? Because of his evil view."  
>  6. To be right is not enough. A baby may be right, but that does
> not mean that a baby knows what is right. To be right one must know
> what is right.  
>  7. "Ananda, who can be rightly described as an almsman? Only he
> who has mastered what is rationally possible and what is rationally
> impossible."
>
>   
> § 2. Why Bother About Life After Death?
>
>  1. On a certain occasion the venerable Kassapa the Great and the
> venerable Sariputta were staying near Benares at Isipatana in the Deer
> Park.  
>  2. Then the venerable Sariputta, rising up at eventide from
> solitude, went to the venerable Kassapa the Great, and sat down on one
> side.  
>  3. So seated, the venerable Sariputta said to the venerable
> Kassapa the Great, "How now friend Kassapa? Does the Tathagata exist
> beyond death?  
>  4. "Undeclared is it, friend, by the Exalted One, that the
> Tathagata exists beyond death.  
>  5. "What then, friend? Does the Tathagata both exist and not exist
> beyond death?  
>  6. "This also, friend, is undeclared by the Exalted One.  
>  7. "How then, friend? Does the Tathagata neither not exist beyond
> death? That also, friend, is not declared by the Exalted One.  
>  8. "But why, friend, has it not been declared by the Exalted
> One?"  
>  9. "This is a question not concerned with profit to humanity, or
> with the first principles of holy life. It does not lead to perfect
> wisdom nor to Nibbana. That, friend, is why it is not declared by the
> Exalted One."
>
>   
> § 3. Prayers and Invocations to God are a Futility
>
>  1. Once the Blessed Lord speaking to Vasettha said:  
>  2. "If this river Achiravati were full of water even to the brim
> and overflowing, and a man with business to be done on the further
> bank of it should come up, and want to cross over,  
>  3. "And standing on that bank, he should invoke the further bank
> and say: ' Come hither, O further bank! Come over to this side!'  
>  4. "Now what think you, Vasettha? Would the further bank of the
> river Achiravati, by that man's invoking and praying, and hoping, and
> praising, come over to this side?  
>  5. "In just the same way, Vasettha, do the Brahmins, versed in the
> three Vedas, omitting the practice of those qualities which really
> make a man a Brahmin, and adopting the practice of those qualities
> which really make men non-Brahmins, say thus:  
>  6. "'Indra we call upon, Brahma we call upon, Isana we call upon,
> Prajapati we call upon, Brahma we call upon--we call, we call.'  
>  7. "Verily, Vasettha, that these Brahmins, by reason of their
> invoking .and praying and hoping and praising, should after death
> become united with Brahma--verily such a condition of things can in
> nowise be."
>
>   
> § 4. It is Not What You Eat that Makes You Holy
>
>  1. A Brahmin happened to meet the Lord, and raised the question of
> the effect of food on a man's character.  
>  2. The Brahmin said: "The millet-grain, palm-nuts, pulse, bulbs,
> and wilding shoots--this diet, rightly got, ever prompts the good
> life. Tis eating carrion that is bad."  
>  3. The Blessed One replied: "Though you (Lord) say you touch no
> carrion, you eat choice dishes made with \[the\] flesh of birds--I ask
> what you term 'carrion'.  
>  4. "Killing and maiming, stripes, bonds, theft, lies, fraud,
> deceit, adultery--not meats, but these, are carrion.  
>  5. "Pursuit of pleasure, lust for guzzlings, life unclean, blatant
> dissent--not meats, but these, are carrion.  
>  6. "Backbiting, cruelty, betrayals, ruthless pride, mean
> stinginess--not meats, but these, are carrion.  
>  7. "Anger, conceit, revolt, guile, envy, bluster, pride, low
> company--not meats, but these, are carrion.  
>  8. "Base living, slander, fraud, cheating, the trickster's wiles,
> foul infamies--not meats, but these, are carrion.  
>  9. "This rage to slay and steal, these crimes, are fraught with
> doom and end in hell--not meats, but these, are carrion.  
>  10. "No abstinence from meat and fish, no nudity, no topknots,
> shaven crowns, or garb of pelt, no cult of sacred fire, no stark
> austerities to purchase future bliss, no rinsing, burnt-offering,
> rites, can cleanse the man who doubts.  
>  11. "Control thy sense, rule thy powers, hold to Truth, be kind.
> The saint who leaves all ties and vanquishes all ills, is stained by
> naught he either sees or hears."  
>  12. Hearing the Lord preach these lofty, saving truths, denouncing
> 'carrion', and sweeping ills away, the Brahmin meekly knelt and asked
> to be enrolled as Almsman then and there.
>
>   
> § 5. Not Food But Evil Actions That Matter
>
>  1. A Brahmin, by name Amagandha, was an ascetic who lived in the
> region of Himalayas with his pupils.  
>  2. They ate neither fish nor flesh. Every year they came down from
> their hermitage in search of salt and acids. The inhabitants of the
> village received them with honour, and gave them hospitality for four
> months.  
>  3. Then the Blessed Lord with his monks visited the same village.
> The people, on hearing the Lord preach his Dhamma, became his
> followers.  
>  4. That year even Amagandha and his disciples as usual went to the
> villagers, but the villagers did not show the same enthusiasm.  
>  5. Amagandha was disappointed to hear that the Lord did not forbid
> eating fish and flesh. Wishing to have the matter confirmed, he went
> to Jeta Vana at Shravasti, where the Blessed Lord was then staying,
> and said:  
>  6. "Millet, cingula-beans and peas, edible leaves and roots, the
> fruit of any creeper; the righteous who eat these, obtained justly, do
> not tell lies for the sake of pleasures.  
>  7. "Thou eatest whatever food is given by others, which is well
> prepared, nicely got up, pure, and excellent. He who enjoys such food
> made of rice, he eats 'Amagandha'. You say that the charge of
> Amagandha, does not apply to me, while eating rice with well prepared
> bird's flesh.  
>  8. "I inquire the meaning of this from you, of what kind is your
> Amagandha?"  
>  9. The Lord replied: "Taking life, beating, cutting, binding,
> stealing, lying, fraud, deceiving, worthless knowledge, adultery--this
> is Amagandha, and not the eating of flesh.  
>  10. "In this world those individuals who are unrestrained in
> sensual pleasures, who are greedy for sweet things, who are associated
> with impure actions, who are of Nihilistic views, crooked, difficult
> to follow--this is Amagandha, and not the eating of flesh.  
>  11. "In this world those who are rude, harsh, backbiting,
> treacherous, unkind, excessively egoistic, ungenerous, and do not give
> anything to anybody--this is Amagandha, and not the eating of flesh.  
>  12. "Anger, pride, obstinacy, antagonism, deceit, envy, boasting,
> excessive egoism, association with the unrighteous--this is Amagandha,
> and not eating of flesh.  
>  13. "Those who are of bad morals, refuse to pay their debt,
> slanderers, deceitful in their dealings, pretenders, those who in this
> world being the vilest of men, commit such wrongdoings--this is
> Amagandha, and not the eating of flesh.  
>  14. "Those persons who, in this world, are uncontrolled towards
> living beings, who are bent on injuring others, having taken their
> belongings; immoral, cruel, harsh, disrespectful--this is Amagandha,
> and not the eating of flesh.  
>  15. "Those who attack these living beings either because of greed
> or of hostility, and always bent upon (evil), they go to darkness
> after death and fall into hell headlong--this is Amagandha, and not
> the eating of flesh.  
>  16. "Abstaining from fish or flesh, nakedness, shaving of the
> head, matted hair, covering with ashes, wearing rough deer skins,
> attending the sacrificial fire--nor all these various penances in the
> world (performed) for immortality, neither incantations, oblations,
> sacrifices nor seasonal observances, purifies a person who has not
> overcome his doubt.  
>  17. "He who lives with his senses guarded and conquered, and is
> established in the Dhamma, delights in uprightness and gentleness, who
> has gone beyond attachments and has overcome all sorrows--that wise
> man does not cling to what is seen and heard.  
>  18. "It is evil actions which constitute Amagandha, and not the
> eating of fish or flesh."
>
>   
> § 6. Not Enough Is Outward Washing
>
>  1. Once the Exalted One was dwelling at Shravatsi. And the Brahmin
> Sangarava also dwelt there. Now he was a cleanser by water, and
> practised cleansing by water. Night and day he abode, given to the
> habit of going down to bathe.  
>  2. Now the venerable Ananda, robing himself at an early hour and
> taking outer robe and bowl, went forth to Shravatsi to beg. And when
> he had gone his rounds in Shravatsi and had eaten his meal, upon his
> return he went to the Exalted One, saluted Him, and sat down on one
> side. So seated, the venerable Ananda said:  
>  3. "Lord, there is here one Sangarava, a Brahmin, dwelling at
> Shravatsi, a cleanser by water, one who practises cleansing by water.
> Night and day does he abide, given to the habit of going down to
> bathe. Well were it. Lord, if the Exalted One would pay a visit to the
> Brahmin Sangarava, out of compassion for him."  
>  4. And the Exalted One consented by His silence.  
>  5. So next day at an early hour, the Exalted One robed himself
> and, taking outer robe and bowl, went to the dwelling of the Brahmin
> Sangarava, and when he got there he sat down on a seat made ready.  
>  6. Then the Brahmin Sangarava came to the Exalted One and greeted
> him, and after the exchange of mutual courtesies sat down on one
> side.  
>  7. As he thus sat, the Exalted One said this to the Brahmin
> Sangarava: "Is it true, Brahmin, as they say, that thou art a cleanser
> by water, that thou dost practise cleansing by water, abiding night
> and day given to the habit of going down to bathe?"  
>  8. "True it is. Master Gautama."  
>  9. "Now, Brahmin, seeking what profit dost thou so practise the
> habit of going down to bathe, and so forth?"  
>  10. "It is in this way, Master Gautama. Whatsoever evil I do by
> day, I get it washed away that very evening by my bathing. Whatsoever
> evil I do by night, I get it washed away next morning by my bathing.
> That is the profit I am looking for in being a cleanser by water and
> so forth."  
>  11. Then said the Exalted One:  
>  12. "The Norm is the pool. It is clear and undefiled.  
>  13. "Hither when they have come to bathe, the masters of the lore
> are cleansed in every limb, and pass unto the Further Shore."  
>  14. Whereupon the Brahmin Sangarava said to the Exalted One:
> "Excellent it is, Master Gautama. May the Master Gautama accept me as
> his follower, from this day forth so long as life doth last, as one
> who has taken refuge in him."
>
>   
> §7. What is Holy Life?
>
>  1. Once while the Blessed Lord was on \[a\] journey he gave, as
> was his practice, the following discourse to the Bhikkhus who were
> accompanying him.  
>  2. Addressing the Bhikkhus the Lord said: "O brethren, this holy
> life is not practised with a view to deceive people, nor to seek their
> favour, nor for the purpose of gain, benefit, or fame, nor with the
> intention of getting out of difficulties in controversy, nor that one
> may be known as such and such by men. Indeed, brethren, this holy life
> is practised for the controlling (of body and speech), the cleansing
> (of corruptions), and the detachment (from) and cessation (of
> craving)."  
> 
>
> SECTION SIX--SERMONS ON SOCIO-POLITICAL QUESTIONS  
>   
> § 1. Do Not Depend on the Favour of Princes
>
>  1. Once the Exalted One was staying at Rajagraha in the Bamboo
> Grove, in the Squirrels' Feeding ground.  
>  2. At that time, Prince Ajatasatru was supporting Devadatta, who
> had turned hostile to the Blessed Lord.  
>  3. He was maintaining the supporters of Devadatta, late and early,
> with five hundred carts, conveying therein food brought in five
> hundred cooking-pots.  
>  4. Then a number of the brethren came before the Exalted One,
> saluted him, and sat down on one side, and there sitting, they told
> all of these things to the Exalted One.  
>  5. Then the Blessed Lord, addressing the brethren said: "Do ye not
> long for gains, favours and flattery from the kings. So long,
> brethren, as Prince Ajatasatru thus supports Devadatta, late and
> early, with five hundred carts, conveying therein food brought in five
> hundred cooking-pots, it is ruin, brethren, that may be expected of
> Devadatta, and not growth in good conditions.  
>  6. "Just as if, brethren, one were to crumble liver on a mad dog's
> nose, the dog would only get the madder, even so, brethren, so long as
> Prince Ajatasatru thus supports Devadatta it is ruin that may be
> expected of Devadatta, and not growth in good conditions. Thus
> terrible, brethren, are gains, favours, and flattery of the princes.  
>  7. "They are a bitter, painful hindrance to the attainment of the
> sure peace that passeth all.  
>  8. "Wherefore, brethren, thus must you train yourselves: 'When
> gains, favours, and flattery befall us, we will reject them, and when
> they do befall us, they shall not take hold of and be established in
> our hearts, and make us slaves of the prince.'"
>
>   
> §2. If the King is Righteous, his Subjects will be Righteous
>
>  1. Once the Lord, addressing the Almsmen, said:  
>  2. "Brethren during such time as kings are unrighteous, their
> ministers and officers also become unrighteous. The ministers and
> officers, brethren, being unrighteous, Brahmins and householders also
> become unrighteous. The Brahmins and householders, brethren, being
> unrighteous, the town-folk and villagers become unrighteous.  
>  3. "But whenever, brethren, kings are righteous, then kings'
> ministers and officers also become righteous. Whenever kings'
> ministers and officers become righteous, the Brahmins and householders
> also become righteous. Whenever Brahmins and householders become
> righteous, the town-folk and villagers also become righteous.  
>  4. "When kine are crossing, if the old bull swerves, they all go
> swerving, following his lead. So among men, if he who is reckoned
> chief walks crookedly, the others crooked go.  
>  5. "Similarly, the whole realm suffers when the king goes wrong.
> When kine are crossing, if the bull goes straight they all go
> straight, because his course is straight. So among men, if he who's
> reckoned chief walks righteously, the others live aright. The whole
> realm lead happy lives when kings are good."
>
>   
> §3. It is the Social System on which Depends Political and Military
> Strength
>
>  1. The Blessed One was once dwelling in Rajagraha, on the hill
> called the Vultures' Peak.  
>  2. Now at that time, Ajatasatru, the son of the queen consort of
> Videha origin, the king of Magadha, was desirous of attacking the
> Vajjins, and he said to himself, "I will root out these Vajjins,
> mighty and powerful though they be, I will destroy these Vajjins, I
> will bring these Vajjins to utter ruin!"  
>  3. So he spoke to the Brahmin Vasakara, the Prime Minister of
> Magadha, and said:  
>  4. "Come now, O Brahmin, do you go to the Blessed One, and bow
> down in adoration at his feet on my behalf, and enquire on my behalf
> whether he is free from illness and suffering, and in the enjoyment of
> ease and comfort and vigorous health.  
>  5. "Then tell him that Ajatasatru, son of Videhi, the King of
> Magadha, is eager to attack the Vajjins, mighty and powerful though
> they be--I will destroy these Vajjins, I will bring these Vajjins to
> utter ruin!  
>  6. "And bear carefully in mind whatever the Blessed One may
> predict, and repeat it to me. For the Buddha speaks nothing untrue."  
>  7. Then the Brahmin Vasakara hearkened to the words of the king,
> saying, "Be it as you say." And ordering a number of magnificent
> carriages to be \[made\] ready, he went to the Vultures' Peak.  
>  8. On arriving there, he exchanged with the Blessed One the
> greetings and compliments, and then delivered to him the message, even
> as the king had commanded.  
>  9. Now at that time the venerable Ananda was standing behind the
> Blessed One. And the Blessed One said to him: "Have you heard, Ananda,
> that theVajjins hold full and frequent public assemblies?  
>  10. "Lord, so I have heard," replied he.  
>  11. "So long, Ananda," rejoined the Blessed One, "as the Vajjins
> hold these full and frequent public assemblies; so long may they be
> expected not to decline, but to prosper.  
>  12. "So long, Ananda, as the Vajjins meet together in concord, and
> rise in concord, and carry out their undertakings in concord.  
>  13. "So long as they enact nothing not already established,
> abrogate nothing that has been already enacted, and act in accordance
> with the ancient institutions of the Vajjins as established in former
> days.  
>  14. "So long as they honour and esteem and revere and support the
> Vajjin Elders, and make it a point of duty to hearken to their
> words.  
>  15. "So long as no women or girls belonging to their clans are
> detained among them by force or abduction.  
>  16. "So long as the Vajjins respect and follow religion.  
>  17. "So long, Ananda, the Vajjins may be expected not to decline
> but to prosper, and no one can destroy them."  
>  18. In short, the Blessed Lord declared that so long as the
> Vajjins believe in democracy and practise democracy, there is no
> danger to their State.  
>  19. Then the Blessed One addressed Vasakara and said:  
>  20. "When I was once staying, O Brahmin, at Vaishali, I taught the
> Vajjins these conditions of welfare.  
>  21. "We may expect, then," answered the Brahmin, "the welfare and
> not the decline of the Vajjins, so long as they observe these
> conditions. So, Gautama, the Vajjins cannot be overcome by the king of
> Magadha."  
>  22. So Vasakara heard the words of the Blessed One, rose from his
> seat, and went back to Rajagraha to inform the king of what the Lord
> had said.
>
>   
> § 4. War is Wrong
>
>  1. It so happened that Ajatasatru, the king of Magadha, mustering
> an army of cavalry and infantry, invaded Kasi, a part of the kingdom
> of king Pasenadi. And Pasenadi, hearing of the expedition, also
> mustered a similar army and went to meet him.  
>  2. The two fought with one another, and Ajatasatru defeated the
> king Pasenadi, who retreated to his own capital Shravasti.  
>  3. The Bhikkhus who were in Shravasti, returning from their alms
> round, came and told the Exalted One of the battle and the retreat.  
>  4. "Almsmen, the king of Magadha, Ajatasatru, is a friend of
> whatever is evil. King Pasenadi is a friend of whatever is good. For
> the present, Pasenadi will pass the night in misery, a defeated man.  
>  5. "Conquest engenders hate; the conquered lives in misery. But
> whoso is at peace and passionless, happily doth he live; conquest hath
> he abandoned and defeat."  
>  6. Again it so happened these two kings met in battle a second
> time. But in that battle, the Kosala king Pasenadi defeated Ajatasatru
> and captured him alive. Then king Pasenadi thought: "Although this
> king injures me who was not injuring him, yet is he my nephew. What if
> I were now to confiscate his entire army, elephants, horses, chariots
> and infantry and leave him only his life?" And he did so.  
>  7. And almsmen, returning from their alms tour in Shravasti,
> brought word of this to the Exalted One. Thereupon the Exalted One
> said: "A man may spoil another, just so far as it may serve his ends;
> but when he's spoiled by others, he, despoiled, spoils yet again.  
>  8. "So long as evil's fruit is not matured, the fool doth fancy
> now's the hour, the chance! But when the deed bears fruit, he fareth
> ill.  
>  9. "The slayer gets a slayer in his turn; the conqueror gets one
> who conquers him; the abuser wins abuse from another.  
>  10. "Thus by the evolution of the deed, a man who spoils is
> spoiled in his turn."
>
>   
> § 5. The Duty of the Victor Who Has Won Peace
>
>  1. When the victor in war has won the peace, he claims the right
> further to degrade the vanquished, if not to enslave him. The Buddha
> had a totally different view on the matter. In his view, if peace had
> \[=has\]any meaning it means that the victor has a duty to use his
> victory for the service of the vanquished. This is what he said to the
> Bhikkhus on this subject:  
>  2. "When Peace is won, the adept in warfare needs to prove an
> able, upright man, of gracious speech \[and\] kind mood, devoid of
> arrogance; an easy, grateful guest, no busybody, wants but few,
> sense-disciplined, quick-witted, bluster-free, never importunate; and
> let him never stoop to conduct mean or low, evoking grave rebuke.  
>  3. "May creatures all abound in weal and peace; may all be blessed
> with peace always--all creatures weak or strong, all creatures great
> and small; creatures unseen or seen, dwelling afar or near, born or
> awaiting birth, may all be blessed with peace!  
>  4. "Let none cajole or flout his fellows anywher ; let none wish
> others harm in dudgeon or in hate.  
>  5. "Just as with her own life a mother shields from hurt her own,
> her only child, let all-embracing thoughts for all that lives be
> thine, an all-embracing love for all the universe in all its heights
> and depths and breadths, unstinted love, unmarred by hate within, not
> rousing enmity.  
>  6."So, as you stand, or walk, or sit, or lie, reflect with all
> your might on this: 'Tis deemed a state divine.'"
