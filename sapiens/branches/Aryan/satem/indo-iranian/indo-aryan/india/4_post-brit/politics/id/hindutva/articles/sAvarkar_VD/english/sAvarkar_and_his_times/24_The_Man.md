The story of Savarkar is the history of resistance, strife,
struggle, sufferings and sacrifices for the cause of political,
social and economic emai^cipation of this Bharat Varsha. His
is a political career extended over fifty long years. How
many of his great contemporaries could see pioneers from
Ranade to philosophers like M. N. Roy, could strive for inde-
pendence of India and yet have the good fortune to see the
sun of freedom rise over India ? An active political leader
who either saw, talked or discussed politics with thinkers
from Ranade to Roy, leaders from Surendranath to Subhas,
from liberator Tilak to fighter Achyutrao Patwardhan ! No
other life on the political stage of India is marked by so many
vicissitudes, punctuated with raging storms and lightning and
tantalized with gaping gallows ! This is a political life
chequered with romantic threads of sufferings and is fringed
with sacrifices. Woven with recollections of the sea and
the steamer, it is interspersed with hell-like prison life and is
lined with historic arrests, trials and releases. Even one single
incident from the matchless drama of Savarkar’s life is long,
charming and thrilling enough to provide the span for a play
of immortal fame.

All his life Savarkcir has been bruised, bleeding, burning
and bursting. The sea is never tired of rivers. So is Savarkar
never tired of sufferings and services. Perhaps no other free-
dom movement produced such an indefatigable fighter with
such an undying love for his country ! Who would be pre-
pared to undergo such unimaginable sufferings, untold sacri-
fices and face formidable dangers for the mere love of his
country ? But it was this very characteristic of the forgetful
fit of the destiny of this man that though all the while storms
kept raging around him, be it rainy season or spring, yet the
sun in Savarkar always broke forth.



392 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

Savarkar is an historical personality embodying the duty
and beauty of a man of mission and action. Ifis majestic
forehead at once reminds you of the forehead of Napoleon
who was also a victim of the British imperialistic wrath. One
look at the crown of his head and you would at once find a
crown in the middle of his head bequeathed by nature herself.
His face possesses the effulgent beauty of gold, his frame
strength of steel, and his head is a store of the hymns of
revolution. His small luring and penetrating eyes hollowed
in the high cheek-bones have the depth of the sea, lightning
of the sky, sweep of the storm and effluence of the volcano.
His eyes peep and probe into the lessons of the past and they
unfailingly warn the Hindus every time against the tragedies
of the present and the impending catastrophes of the future.
The eyes shine like a lighthouse indicating the unfailing direc-
tion to the ship of the nation for its movements in order to
avert the horrors of the approaching wreck. The square jaws
have witnessed his suppressed thoughts, his burning mission,
unfulfilled aims, unflagging industry, frustrated plans, stormy
life and unexampled sacrifice. His short, proportionate hand-
some figure looks like an image carved out of the bones,
blood and brains of the great Hindu thinkers and martyrs
from Hindu History. His head bald and glistening, his chest
broad and invincible, his waist lion-like, his neck short, his
hands small and commanding with an excellent rosy colour
and his height five feet four inches, all this a marvellous
creation of God and Earth. The artificial beauty of an actress
or the exaggerated handsomeness of Kashmiri politicians
would pale before his natural handsomeness.

And gifted with such a personality and blessed with a life
full of extraordinary achievements and undying episodes, he
moved among men as a mighty mesmeric man. Savarkar was
the first Indian student who was rusticated from the hostel
of an institution aided by the British Government and the first
Indian political leader, who publicly performed a bonfire of
foreign clothes. He was again the first political leader of
India to daringly proclaim absolute political independence of
Hindusthan as her goal at a time when the mere word Raj
or Swaraj spelled ruin for the speaker. Savarkar was the first
Barrister, who was refused the degree on account of his



THE MAN


393


political line of thought by the British Government and was the
first graduate to lose the degree of an Indian University for
his love for independence. Savarkar was again the first
Indian leader to invest the problem of Indian Independence
with international importance. He was the first Indian author,
who earned a distinction in the domain of world literature
as his work was proscribed by the Governments of two coun-
tries even before it was printed or published. Savarkar was
also the first rebel leader of India who refused to recognize
the authority of the British Court of Law. Savarkar was
the first political prisoner m the history of the world the issue
of whose arrest was fought out at the International Court at
the Hague. Savarkar is the first political prisoner in the poli-
tical history of the world, who was sentenced to half a cen-
tury’s transportation. Savarkar was the first poet in the
world, who, deprived of pen and paper, composed and wrote
his poems on the prison walls with thorns and jjebbles, learnt
by heart with Vedic tenacity more than ten thousand lines
of his poetry for years till they reached his country through
the mouth of others, and showed how since the dawn
of humanity the great Ary as kept the sacred Vedus circu-
lating from one generation to another by word of mouth.
Indeed, the legend of the memory of Macaulay, who could
repeat all Demosthenes by heart, all Milton and practically
the whole of the Bible, would find a formidable rival
in Savarkar.

Have you heard this typical Mahratta leader at a mass
meeting ? Dressed in immaculate white, with a black round
cap on his massive head, a black umbrella in his right hand
and a fresh newspaper in his left, the deep well-known long
whiskers on his lustrous serene face and eyes encircled in a
golden frame, Savarkar’s personality is at once outstanding
in any vast multitude. What a vast difference in Savarkar,
the lonely giant in his solitary room and Savarkar, the leader
and ruler of the masses ! The orator and prophet gets the
upper hand and Savarkar is always a hero to his valets !

Orators feed themselves on history. In it they seek inspi-
ration. They draw their own conclusions from history.
History develops their visions, heroes feed them on heroism
and their incomplete dreams fan their emotions. Demosthenes,



394 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

Pitt, Burke, Daniel Webster, Hitler, and Churchill belonged to
this type. Savarkar, too, belongs to the line of this immortal
race of orators.

Savarkar enters a mass meeting. He comes to the platfoi ni
walking the gait of a hero, his way opening before him in an
anxious sea of masses. He bows to the masses. The masses
move with waves of emotions as if the moon were in the sky.
He rises to deliver his message. He never comes with a set
speech. He usually speaks on the spur of the moment, lie
is like quick-silver. One listens to him in pin-drop silence or
misses the train of his arguments. His voice is a gre^at asset
and has a peculiar ring. His eyes glitter and glow when he
becomes animated.

Savarkar mercilessly overthrows the fallacies in the foggy
logic of his opponents. His opponents are bewildered at the
torrent of his eloquence. At every sentence you feel an oppo-
nent reeling. The flag goes to Attock, to Assam, to Cape
Comorin. His speech tears the mask of shams and confronts
you with naked realities. His speech has the whirl of a storm.
His humour is merciless. He throws logic and reasoning at
you through emotion. The audience thrills. It claps. It
moves. His eyes flash fire. His face glows with the mission
that burns bright in him. The masses mark the stout heart,
watch the steel frame, iron will, majestic forehead and the
boundless sincerity of a personality that heralded an era into
the history of Indian political struggle and social revolution.

Savarkar’s remarkable political speeches and masterpieces
were delivered before the Peshwas’ Shanivarwada, Poona, on
the Ghats of Cawnpore or in Delhi. They struck his critics
dumb, and cleared doubts and dusty thoughts. It is characteris-
tic of Savarkarian speeches that they sound as though the
Muse of oratory danced, played and wept with the feelings, joys
and sorrows of Savarkar ! His masterpieces begin with such
earnest and gripping sentences in a deep sonorous voice and
end with such a dramatic touching rise and fall in his voice
and moving tone that old men shed tears, youths are filled
with unbearable pathos and women piteously sigh. His magni-
ficent oratory, clear-cut thoughts and inspiring messages have
often sealed and unsealed historic decisions. He defeated and
left a wreck of Gandhiji's draft resolution advising the



THE MAH


395

withdrawal of the Hyderabad struggle before the Sholapur
Conference of the Arya Samaj in 1939. His concluding
speech at the Nagpur Session of the Hindu Mahasabha deli-
vered with a heart-force and a burning mission inspired the
inter-provincialists and new-comers. Leaders like Dr.
Mookerjee were magnetized during the course of one of such
speeches at Calcutta. Not only leaders, lawyers and literary
figures listen to him spell-bound, but foreigners also are en-
chanted with the magic w; ,d of his oratory. While Savarkar
was on his way to Shilloi'j , an Englishman travelling in the
same train, heard the deafening greetings of the people to
Savarkar at every station. At one station the Englishman
requested Savarkar through his secretary to make a short
speech ; for he had heard in England, he said, that Savarkar
was one of the greatest orators. He heard Savarkar speak before
a crowd at the next station, introduced himself to Savarkar
and wishing him all success went away. Fortunate were
those who heard him speak on the ‘War of Independence of
1857 ’ after his release in 1937. Those who heard his Presi-
dential Addre.ss at the Marathi Literary Conference in
Bombay were lucky. Those who attended the Non-Party
Conference in Bombay and Poona need no introduction to
understand why Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru came to Savarkar’s
chair at the time of the Bombay Non-Party Conference,
thanked Savarkar from the bottom of his heart and said ; “It
is you who saved the Conference.” Of Savarkar the Amrit
Bazar Patrika, Calcutta, said that Savarkar was a man of
Mission. The Sunday Standard, Bombay, described him as
an orator of the first order. It added : “ Few others in the

whole of India can thrill and sway his listeners as this simple-
looking Hindu leader can. He is an orator of the first degree ;
and it is a pleasure to hear him speak, his eyes flashing, his
lips quivering, his weak body trembling with emotion.” India
has enjoyed the scintillating speeches of Srinivas Sastri, the
sweet flow of Jayakar, the roarings of the tireless Satyamurthi,
the powerful appeal of Maulana Azad, the high-flown emotio-
nal speeches of Devi Sarojini Naidu, the seriousness of the
visionary in Pandit Nehru and the chattering train of Rajaji,
but India witnessed the culmination and perfection of oratory
in Savarkar, rightly called the Indian Demosthenes.



396 SAVARKAB AND HIS TIMES

n

If you want to study the history of the Indian Revolution,
the history of the social revolution in Maharashtra, and the
history of the literary movement launched to purge the Indian
languages of foreign influence and words, and keep our Lingua
Franca undefiled, you must study Savarkar. Maharashtra has
not produced a more volcanic brain than Savarkar, a leader
whose outlook is absolutely rational and up-to-date. According
to him, rational outlook must obtain control over the political,
social and military life of India, if India is to survive the
struggle for existence. Savarkar welcomes the machine age,
believes in mechanized agriculture and modernised industry.
He wants India to prepare and equip herself physically,
mentally, technically, mechanically and militarily, not with
the object of enslaving other nations, but for liberating the
enslaved peoples of the world from all kinds of shackles,
superstitions and imperialism. During the last two decades
no leader has waged more ruthlessly an unrelenting war
against the barriers of caste system in schools and in public
places, in intercaste dinners and in social intercourse, and has
as much suffered, toiled and faced dangers and dispraise and
even curses as Savarkar in the annihilation of untouchability.
That is why they call him a fusion of the great Mahratta
leaders of modem times who heralded a new epoch in the
history of India. The spirit of Nanasahib, who fought the
War of Indian Independence of 1857, the sweep of Wasudeo
Balwant Phadke who first raised an armed revolt in Maha-
rashtra for the establi-shment of an Indian Republic, the mental
force of Chiplunkar, the reformative zeal of Agarkar, the
sacrifice and struggle of Tilak, the service of Gokhale and
untiring work of Kelkar, all these find an echo in the alchemy
of Savarkar. Who made Shivaji what he was ? Who
moulded Tilak ? Paranjpe or no Paranjpe, Tilak or no
Tilak, Savarkar would have been Savarkar !

Savarkar is a Hindu among the Hindus, but of the Chitor
type. He is proud of his heritage and grateful to it. He finds
his guiding star in Lord Krishna, the glory of Hindusthan. He
sees in Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj the fount of inspiration.
He regards Rana Pratap as the fire of patriotism, Guru Govind



THE MAN


397

Singh the sire of martyrdom, and Sadashiv Bhau the righteous
sword of Hindusthan. To defend, to enliven and to raise the
Hindu Nation is to him a national, patriotic, righteous, just,
human and a sublime cause.

Savarkar does not hate you because you are an Englishman
or a Mohammedan or a Jew ! He has paid glowing tributes
to the skill and might of the Britishers. Savarkar was the
only leader in India, who envisaged a State for the floating
race of the Jews ever since 1908, and in 1923, he wrote in his
famous work Hindutim that ‘ if the Zionists’ dreams were
realised, if Palestine became a Jewish State, it would gladden
us almost as much as our Jewish friends.’ * Since his release
in 1937, he had been a staunch supporter of the idea of a
Jewish state in Palestine and in 1947, no Indian leader was as
happy as Savarkar except possibly Master Tara Singh to see the
emergence of a Jewish Slate in Palestine. It was curious that
Jinnah, who fought for the partition of India, paradoxically
opposed the partition of Palestine, and Gandhiji and Nehru,
who favoured the Arabs with an undivided Palestine accelerat-
ed and accepted the vivisection of India ! As for the Parsees
and Christians, Savarkar had no grudge against them. He not
only appreciated their co-operation and patriotic outlook, but
also cherished hopes of building with them an Indian State
in which the religion, culture and language of the minorities
would be preserved. He never cherished to impose dis-
advantages upon the non-Hindus. That is why he met and
discussed in a frank, free and accommodating spirit with the
leaders of the Parsees, the Jews and the Cliristians who wanted
to remain in India as loyal citizens enjoying equal rights with
the Hindus. But as he rightly suspected the separatist tenden-
cies and extra-territorial ambition of the Muslims, he was not
prepared to give them an inch more than they democratically
deserved and for this outspokenness he was called a communa-
list by those who were pro-Muslim. Events have proved now
the correctness of Savarkar’s stand and the futility and falsity
of the appeasing policy of the pro-Muslim patriots who
claimed the appellation nationalists for themselves. Some of
the pro-Muslim Hindu leaders and journals drum that the
medieval days of the Peshwas are gone. But they forget that


1 Savarkar, Hirtdutva, p. 112.



398 SAVARKAK AND HIS TIMES

had Savarkar lived during the Peshwa rule, he -would have
conquered back the land of Gandhar and it is equally true
that he would have bravely faced the Todarmals, Birbals and
Mansinghs.

It is, however, a fact that Savarkar is an echo of the unjustly
suppressed, exploited and disturbed soul of the Hindus. His
soul has become one, and is synchronized with the sorrows
and joys of Hindudom, the Hindu world. Whenever some-
thing harms or jeopardizes the interests, property, honour and
lives of the Hindus, he gets restless. So perennial is his love
for the Hindus, so eternal is his hope of their great future and
the role of the Hindus in the building of the peace and
prosperity of the world, that he is infuriated whenever he
hears that the Hindus are suppressed and their just rights
denied ; and when that feeling is on him, he shows signs of a
violent dislike for those who trample upon the Hindu rights,
oppress them and make aggressions on them.

Savarkar has been waging war since his early youth. His
war is against those who trample upon the just and fimda-
mental rights of the Hindus in their Homeland. His war is
against those who deface and disgrace humanity in this land.
His was the war of a Nation against all intruders, disruptive
men and bogus World Federalists whose practice was divorced
from their professions and whose actions led to the break-up
of the solidarity and the integrity of Hindusthan. And there-
fore Savarkar is a terror to tyrants, foe to injustice, an antidote
to anti-nationalists and an unforgiving critic of the pro-Muslim
politicians in India. To him a disruptive patriot or a Pakistani
Hindu is synonymous with a pretender or a traitor respec-
tively and literally. Savarkar is opposed to Pakistans as heat
is to cold. His political philosophy is as different from
Gandhism as chalk from charcoal. He wants a place for the
Hindus on the map of the world as Bharat Bhoomi or
Hindusthan and so he says that Hindusthan belongs to the
Hindus. What is -wrong in it ? Can the Hindus rightfully
say that Britain, Germany or Turkastan belongs to them ?

Savarkar is an electric powerhouse. You cannot touch it.
His conversational gift is nothing less than dictatorial, but
tinged with utmost rationalism. To begin -with, he will
patiently listen to you with some pertinent queries and then



THE MAN


399


would do 1 .ost of the talking. Looking to the force of his
arguments, logic and reasoning, some say he is vain and
egoistic. But the fact is that by temperament he is assertive,
unyielding and dictatorial due to a feeling of superiority
complex, a belief in the rightness and justice of his cause and
due to his strong convictions and mellowed thoughts. And
strong personalities cire alw^ays so. Bernard Shaw once
silenced his critics who charged him with vanity and egoism.
He told his cj'itics that had any of them gone through the trials
and hardships which he himselt had undergone, he would
have been hundred limes tnore vciin and egoistic than Shaw
himself. One-tenth of Savarkar’s trials, tribulations and
talents, and the critics would have been ten times more egoistic
and vain than Savarkar.

Savarkar’s logic is curt, his humour caustic and his whipping
electric. He is a stern mouth-stopper. During his premier-
ship Mr. Fazlul Huq boasted that the Muslims were tigers and
lions and they would harass the Hindus. Savarkar hit him
back : “ The history of creation proves that it is men who

have reclaimed the earth and lions and tigers had to retii*e
to the obscuritj^ of the forest. We Hindus are men. One man
with a whip in his hand controls scores of lions and tigers in
a circus and these beasts obey wonderfully well.’’ The same
Muslim leader said that Malabar was a part of Arabia.
Savarkar pulled him up by replying tliat if it was so, then
Arabia must be annexed to India ! To the Pakistanis and their
supporters who said that because in some provinces the
Muslims were in a majority, they wanted Pakistan, Savarkar
replied with equal ruthlessness that because in Hindustban
the Hindus were in a majority, Hindusihan belonged to the
Hindus. Dr. Rajendra Prasad said during the Biharsharif riot
days that he advised the Hindus as his own people. Savarkar
asked Dr. Rajendra Prasad as to w^hen he had deserted his
Indian Nationalism and condescended to call only the Hindus
his own people. One wordy Socialist once asked Savarkar
whether he had read Lenin. The upstart was silenced by
Savarkar with one stroke : “ Had Lenin read Savarkar ? ” Not
that he has neglected literature on Communism. The author
has seen some books on the subject in Savarkar ’s small
personal library read, underlined and with remarks made in



400 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

the margin by Savarkar at the proper places, especially on
books by Lenin and Trotsky. Savarkar has read many book.s
on the subject before his release and of late he often directs
his men to buy the latest books on Socialism. But what he
hates most is blind babbling of foreign phraseology and blind
worship -which totally disregard the conditions, traditions and
the history of our country.

Savarkar is a unique combination of a dreamer and a doer,
a prophet and a warrior, a realist and a revolutionary all in
one man. In him you will find a Washington who unsheathed
liis sword for freedom ; a Thomas Paine who wielded an
inspiring pen, and a Mazzini who ushered in a revolutionary
epoch and started the war of Independence. Soaringly
imaginative yet severely logical, erudite yet perspicuous,
Savarkar is not merely a great writer, but a very great one.
Describing Savarkar’s place in the domain of literature,
Gandhiji’s Mahratta biographer, Sri D. N. Shikhare wrote :

“ It is admitted on all hands, including his political opponents,
that Mr. Savarkar is a rare genius. He is a pen of fire. He
wields pen and pistol alike. Patriotism and Poetry run
through the veins of his literature. England may be proud of
her statesmen writers like Morley and MacDonald and Russia
may well boast of Tolstoy and Gorky ; but India surpasses all
these countries in having Mr. Savarkar who is a writer, a
statesman and a warrior. His pen would have shaken the
world from its bottom but for the narrow scope of the Marathi
language, through which mother tongue he masterly expresses
himself.^ In India Savarkar as an author is a class by him-
self, for Savarkar has -written in blood lines with his blood
and the bones of martyrs. It is the characteristic of all
immortal authors that they cannot write in artificial pruned
lines with their stomach at ease, for there is no halfway house
for positive personalities. Savarkar’s -writings raise a storm
of emotions and shake your intellect. His pen arouses fierce
hatred and fierce loyalties. You feel a storm has passed over
you or some power has dashed against you. All his -writings,
both jyoetry and prose, preach resistance to tyranny, inspire
you with courage and direct your energies towards the libera-
tion of mankind from all bondages. Savarkar is a great poet,

1 D. N. Shikhare, The Mahratta, dated 27-5-1938.



THE MAN


401


a poet of g!’eat, grand and epic poetry. His poetry is logic
on fire, as all great poetry is, and satisfies your intellect as
well as emotions. His epic genius gave the people high ideals,
his great pen infused an irresistible spirit of independence into
the people, his supreme courage and unparalleled sacrifice
aroused their patriotic feeUngs, his words made them feel the
spirit of nationality and realize the solidarity of the nation.
Savarkar has educated the illiterate, motivated the educated
and activized the learned.

Savarkar is a great social reformer. Neither talkative nor
fashionable reformers can « neasure Savarkar’s worth and work
in purging the society pitilessly and fearlessly of its ills,
ignorance and superstitions. Many were a bell-ringer to social
revolution, a few worked actually in the field, but few had the
unfailing courage and the genius of a practical social reformer.
A social reformer requires a certain amoimt of courage, con-
viction and a stout but elastic heart to achieve his goal. And
Savarkar’s courage and heart have well shaken the world.
His strong conviction, dauntless courage, endless faith, endur-
ing capacity for work, unremitting industry, untiring energy,
invincible determination and a volcanic pen belong to the type
of men like Luther, Knox, Mazzini, Rousseau, Voltaire and
Carlyle, who represent the moral force of the world and stamp
their mind upon their age.

But the outstanding characteristic of Savarkar is that he is
a great iconoclast, one of the greatest idol-breakers Asia has
ever seen or produced. A strong will, a volcanic pen, a power-
ful hammer, a fiery heart, a scathing contempt for hypocrisy,
Savarkar is a born iconoclast, who despises and scorns
hypocrisy in religion, society, and politics. He does not strutt
off as an agent of God descended down to herald a new era,
nor does he pretend to possess an inner voice. His is the
voice of reason and science. Therefore he ruthlessly routed
and pitilessly hammered out all kinds of superstitions, bond-
ages, sanctimonious hypocrisy in society, in religion and in
politics. From bigoted Sanatanists to bogus saints, dead or
alive, none escaped the strokes of his hammer ! He possesses
all the attributes, tests and elements of greatness. According
to Dr. Ambedkar a Great Man is he who acts as the scourge
and scavenger of society. Savarkar is a really Great Man,



402 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

who is motivated by the dynainics of a social purpose anu
has acted as the scourge and scavenger of Society.

Savarkar is a hero at many points. The hero as poet in
Savarkar is extolled to the skies in Maharashtra ; the hero
as a man of letters, he is claimed to be an immortal author
by litterateurs ; the hero as patriot in Savarkar is deified all
over India ; but the hero as prophet in Savarkar is not yet
appreciated by many outside his party. The business of a
prophet is to see and teach. A prophe t possesses three main
qualities. They are insight, courage and sincerity. As to
courage and sincerity, Savarkars name is now a legend.
Savarkar has proved the unfaiiingiiess of his insight on several
occasions. Savarkar predicted as early as 1925 that the separa-
tion of Sind from Bombay Province for appeasing the Muslim
mind would be a disastrous precedent, would destroy the Sind
Hindus and would pique the appetite of the anti-national
Muslims. In 1938 he declared to the surprise of the whole
nation that the Congress led by Gandhiji would betray the
nation and would destroy the unity of India by conceding
Pakistan. In 1940 he warned the Assam Hindus that if they
did not check the Muslim influx into Assam, Assam would
meet the fate of Sind and Bengal. Congressmen then laughed
at him. However, in 1947 they owned his prophecy, for Assam
was almost tagged to Pakistan, but was fortunately saved
through the vigilance of the leaders who at last realized the
danger after the frantic and hoarse cry of Savarkar. The
warning sounded about the fate of Kashmir in 1938 went
unheard and the Kashmir Hindus paid for it and ultimately
Hindus all over Hindusthan had to pay crores of rupees and
pour their blood for defending Kashmir from the onslaughts
of the Pakistanis. Did not the Nizam, too, suffer the fate as
predicted by Savarkar ?

When World War II broke out and Russia joined it,
Savarkar at once remarked that the crafty Britain had saved
her throat, and now she would swallow the whole of Africa.
At the time of the battle of Stalingrad, Savarkar said that if
Japan failed to attack Russia from the Eastern side, both
Germany and Japan would lose the war and Japan would
have to pay for her folly in the long run. What actually did
happen is too well known to be recounted.



THE MAN


403


Men of prophetic vision never try to please the masses. They
aim at guiding them. They always look to the larger interests
of the people, not only of their own generation, but of future
generations as well. So they are many a time not as popular
as they should be. They never pander to popularity, nor do
they sacrifice their conscience for success. The masses do not
understand the prophetic visions of these men because what
these prophets see is beyond their horizon.

Ill

The shades of prison life have dominated the citizen
Savarkar, and have much affected the politician Savarkar too.
Those shades and shadows often times obscure his social inter-
course with his partymen and public men. Moody and erratic,
he could not create a certain warmth that is needed in a party
chief towards his colleagues, partymen and followers. For the
consolidation and success of a political party, the wings of
the soft heart of the party chief mu.st reach at least the con-
necting hooks in the link. The chief must be cordial enough
to enquire about the difficulties of his lieutenants and ajTange
to help them so as to enable them to devote their best to the
cause and service of the people. Excepting the rare names
of Ranade, Tilak and Gandhiji, no other party chief could bring
himself to this much-needed accommodating frame of mind.
Tilak ran to distant places even for settling the marriage of a
daughter of his disciple, or could advise a farmer in the matter
of his legal problems even from the Mandalay Prison.
Gandhiji could tear out his heart, what of purse, to soothe the
grief and troubles of his peirty leaders. But the case of
Savarkar, the political leader, is quite different. He could
not respond to the enthusiasm or warmth of other leaders, who
sought his interviews or valuable guidance, or those who even
passed valuable information on to him secretly. The fate of
interviewers and foreign visitors was no better. The glamour
of the furniture of Mr. Jinnah, the warmth and hospitality of
the special guest-house of Tilak for political leaders and
eminent guests, the living interest and paternal inquiries of
Gandhiji into the personal affairs of his lieutenants, and Pandit
Nehru’s abiding hospitality to foreigners, or friendly invitations



404 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

for dinners to eminent men, admirers, or party leaders,
or a casual invitation to his inter-provincial visitors or an
appreciative call to the pressmen, all these could not impress
Savarkar, the political leader. Cynically disinterested, he did
not feel any inward urge for it. His ideas and beliefs of
patriotic duties and national obligations were purely and
supremely patriotic and selfless. His motto was duty irres-
pective of any consideration of fruit. And this was the noble
motto of all those early selfless revolutionaries. Savarkar
expected every Indian to do his duty by his Motherland who
pined for freedom. This highly disinterested and selfless
mental make-up came in the way of the modern set-up of
propaganda, which depends upon much give and take. This
has materially affected the destiny of the party and his leader-
ship.

But in spite of such restricted sense of warmth in the social
intercourse and sympathy with his party men, lieutenants
and followers due to the legacy of his long prison life and
shattered health, Savarkar is the only political leader in India
for whom and at whose command hundreds of youths would
lay down their lives. This is due to Savarkar’s unrivalled
genius, selfless patriotism, unparalleled sacrifice and dynamic,
mighty and mesmeric personality.

So, introvert and restless, Savarkar breathes flames of un-
dying faith in spite of an unsympathetic and unsound consti-
tution that has withstood unimaginable horrors, terrors and
tortures of the Andamans. “ A long exile in the Andamans
wrecked his health early in life, and it is amazing how he has
regathered his strength and carried on so long in public life,”
remarked the National Herald while commenting on the
retirement of Savarkar in 1943. So much unsound is his
constitution that sleep is always forced on him by the use of
bromide. Writing about the introvert and restless Savarkar,
a writer in the Hindusthan Times, Delhi, described Savarkar
as an ascetic and inward looking man who in his youth almost
set the Thames on fire, and observed : “ Savarkar is strange.
He may not glitter. His attitude may not please you. He is
mesmeric with a capacity to infuse in an observer a sense of
cold aloofness.” A little cynicism may be, therefore, excused
in such a highly constrained constitution. For almost thirteen



THS MAN


405

years he was companionless and was forced to eat with
cruel punctuality, at the same place and the same quality and
kind of food prepared with the matchless prison skill and
medical care. This has made him what he is today. His iso-
lation is mostly due to circumstances and partly due to his
temperament. He lives alone. That giants must live apart
and kings have no company is true, Hterally true of Savarkar.

Savarkar, the promoter of science and advocate of
modernism, lives a very simple life. Wonderstruck at the
homely and rough simplicity of his little house known as
Savarkar Sadan, once Sri Srinivas Sastri asked : “ Savarkar,
is this the house you live in ? ” “ Yes,” replied Savarkar.

“ Why, is this not more comfortable than the cell in the
Andamans ? ” And Sastri was struck with a strange emotion.
After much consideration and many visits of world-famous
men to his house, there were slight additions which he would
call considerable to the equipment and establishment of his
house by way of a little furniture. It is a plain middle-class
life of contentment, which yearns not for what it does not
have.

Savarkar has no friends. Almost all his brilliant colleagues
of early days have perished in foreign lands ; others here are
now dead and gone. His present colleagues and co-workers
cannot understand exactly what he is. Even older politicians
like Dr. Moonje talked with Savarkar with due care and awe
and none tried to be familiar with him. As to the relations,
there are few who venture to be on visiting terms with the
family and none lives with him. It is generally the case with
all revolutionary leaders that they live almost estranged and
segregated from their friends and families as the circumstances
and nature of their work demand. In normal course none
would be willing to cast in one’s lot with a revolutionary and
that too a leader, and incur the displeasure of the authorities.
And Savarkar is such a name ! Terrific, towering, volcanic,
panoramic, mesmeric and historic ! What of living and stay-
ing with the person, the fire, those who have played with the
name have quailed and have been haunted throughout their
lives and it has sat upon their chest like nightmare ! Because
of ever-attending dangers Savarkar stays alone with his small
family consisting of his wife and only son and sometimes his

TCVartVed daughter on a visit to her father. His brother, Dr N.
D Savarkar, resided with his family in the same locality,
Savarkar is blessed with a wife of a great Aryan type repre-
sentative of the traditional loyalty and endless devotion that
stood the long period of 18 years Ml of trials and sufferings.
Sober, deep, silent and enduring, she is a prudent housewife
and a noble soul. The household affairs are smooth and regu-
lar. There is no question of choosing food or eatables. Simple
food and fruits, bare necessities and no waste is the rule of the
kitchen. The kitchen is not bothered about the likes and
dislikes. No complaints, no worries whether some vegetables
have less salt or more of spices. Often bhajis and curds and
at times icecream and shrikhand are welcome. That a man
should not be addicted to anything, but should be accustomed
to many things is the rule. During a railway journey he may
take eggs-curry and seldom mutton, but no smoking, wine
never, not a drop in any form. Savarkar does not like a hot
meal ; almost cold eatables he relishes which you may call a
legacy of the Andamans.

When Savarkar is in a happy mood, he may indistinctly
hum to himself a line or two from his poetry. In a happy
mood and when alone, he may stretch his legs a little, may
give a gentle push to his cap if it is on, and may hum a tune.
Chocolates and Jintan are relished by him. Snuff is his
companion ; scent his abiding luxury. His one hobby is
gardening and the poet is seen in communion with plants and
flowers. Regular light physical exercise in the evening is a
habit. He has no love for music. For art he has respect.

Grief, pain, worries and anger he would not give expression

) to. Neither would joy giggle over his face. Those who sur-
round him must observe precision in details, for his cross-
examinations are testing and inseparable and to some extent
worrying, even the slightest deviation being immediately
detected. None can hide facts from the penetrating and
searching eyes. It is true that he is not easy of access. You
have to fix up an appointment beforehand. Strict adherence
to this rule has saved him much harassment, but also has
estranged many. Travellers, business magnates, eminent
leaders and even princes had to go back because they did not
fix up the interviews beforehand. If you come to Bombay on



TH£ MAN


407

some work of yours and come to Savarkar Sadan in your
huriy to leave Bombay when Savarkar has no time, is it the
fault of Savarkar that you leave his house disappointed ?
Under such a troubled situation, a great liberal luminary once
remarked that it was easy to see the King Emperor or the
Viceroy but not Savarkar.

Savarkar’s handwriting is small, slanting and spreads over
every corner by and by. As with time so with paper. He
uses it sparingly. No letter would be ready for being posted
unless the important lines therein are underhned. You may
love to see him reading a newspap>er. He holds the news-
paper in the left hand and, lifting his spectacles a little with
his right thumb, he goes on reading and commenting briefly.

Savarkar gets up at about seven in the morning. His break-
fast consists of eggs and tea. Then he peruses newspapers,
attends to his correspondence, and interviews his visitors
between 9 a.m. and 11-30 a.m. About noon he takes liis bath
and then meal in the kitchen almost all by himself. In between
the meal and the bath he would often sit like a Yogin for an
hour or so as if in a trance which he calls concentration of
mind. At such a time his food may become cold, his wife
waiting silently in the kitchen. Owing to pressure of work,
of late he found no time to practise what he calls concentration
of mind. At noon he has siesta. In the evening comes the
reading of important letters to be replied, detailed reading of
newspapers and select books. After tea and a talk with
familiar guests, if any, he goes downstairs for a stroll in his
garden with some gardener's tools accompanied by the watch-
man who assists him. Then follows the daily regular physical
exercise. After supper he devotes generally an hour or so to
important office work and retires with some regular dose of
medicine.

One point more and quite interesting. As is typical of
revolutionary leaders, Savarkar talks very slowly about his
personal and home matters. To him secrets are treasures. He
is too great a veteran revolutionary leader. None could screw
out from him what Dr. Schatt, the German Finance Wizard,
told him on the eve of the outbreak of World War II, nor the
source he received the letters of Has Behari Bose from Japan
26

during the coiu-se of World War II, nor the full details of his

meeting with Subhas Bose.

Savarkar is majestic in his misery and serene in his sorrows.
He clings to the state of his things with the pride of a Pope.
Where politics and policy are concerned, money means little
or nothing, his ideal everything. Savarkar will not march
with anybody and everybody, be he a kingly Kuber or a
moneyed Mahatma. Men of mission never rotate around
others like satellites. They are creators of dynasties and
makers of kings and kingdoms. They never sacrifice their
conscience for wordly success ; nor do they care for a passing
phase of life, of fame and of happiness. So is Savarkar. What
position Savarkar could not have achieved which eminent
Liberals, moderate politicians and opportunist leaders could
achieve ? Is there any talent superior to Savarkar in the first
Cabinet of Free India in intellect, in sacrifice, in mental and
oratorical powers, in patriotic service, in intellectual honesty
and political strategy ? Where his lieutenant leader,
Dr. Mookerjee, could ascend with his blessing, he could have
easily walked into such positions. But Savarkar did not
compromise his conscience for the success of personal gains and
cheap popularity. He sacrificed all the great honour that
could have easily fawned at his feet, or else “ our dream of an
Indian Republic with Vinayak Damodar Savarkar as its first
President ” ^ would have been realized today.

But life for a cause, for a faith and not for power, Savarkar
loves most. That life may be surrounded by a storm, or a
volcano or the gallows. For, to refuse to betray one’s con-
science to the last, in spite of a general defeat and humiliation
and stand for a fight against the world, bearing a cheerful
face and the cross of sacrifice as freely as the sunflower gives
its bosom to the rays of the sun, is the creed of Savarkar.
Savarkar is a patriot, who fights losing battles and has the
spirit of martyrs who face defeats and death amidst the shouts
of enemies. Naturally, to Savarkar the greatest sacrifice a
man can make in his life is that of cheap fame. Times without

number he told his co-workers, his lieutenants and followers
in the Mahasabha that those who had people’s welfare at
heart should never pander to popularity. Kant also said the
same thing. He said : “ Seek not the favour of the multitude,
for it is seldom got by honest and lawful means.” And
although Savarkar pitilessly hammered the so-called gods,
godmen and superstitions out oi the temples of society, religion
and politics, his popularity is tremendous, extraordinary and
abiding. Countless heads have bowed down before Savarkar,
lakhs of believing multiti; Jes have fallen at his feet with devo-
tion in spite ol his resisting unwillingness on rational grounds.
Male and female octogenarians have regarded him as an
incarnation of God, the Patitpavan, and a few even breathed
their last in tranquillity after having a look at his picture which
they believed to be divine. In the emulation of their devotion
to Savarkar many brilliant youths like Sri Maokar of Nagpur
risked their lives. Many have thrown out pictures of false
gods and so-called godmen after a visit to Savarkar. His old
colleagues and veteran public men have wriggled in their
death-beds awaiting his impossible Darshan — glimpse — and
some died with his name on their faltering tongue and waver-
ing lips instead of the call of Ramnam ! Several revolutiona-
ries, many patriots and some poets have borne the dust from
his residence on their foreheads with devotion. To thousands
he is nothing less than a God. To lakhs he is an art of
eloquence. To millions he is a poem of patriotism, a picture
of sacrifice and to poets he is an acted epic !

Such a fiery, positive and forceful personality is bound to
be brutally frank in his criticism of historic and contemporary
personalities. Of Tilak he ever speaks with reverence. He
has defensive love for Kelkar, reverence for Ranade, high
respect for Gokhale, Nana Shankarshet, Dadabhoy Naoroji,
Surendranath Banerjee, B. C. Pal, Srinivas Sastri, M. R.
Jayakar and Vijayaraghavachariar. For Lajpat Rai, Hardayal,
Virendranath Chattopadhyaya, Ras Behari Bose, Bhai Parma-
nanda, and Moonje he has a deep love. He has a soft corner
for M. N. Roy and Subhas Bose. He describes Vivekananda
as a world genius, Dayananda as a Yogi, a seer and a spiritual
teacher who worked like a giant for the uplift of mankind, and
describes Dr. Ambedkar’s towering personality, erudition and



410 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

capacity to lead as an asset to the nation. He styled Rama-
nanda Chatterjee as a great patriot, who defended the
legitimate rights of the Hindus and whose humanitarianism
and nationalism, he said, were of the purest ray serene. When
Rajaji propagated the ideal of Pakistan, Savarkar described
him as a subtle mad MuUa though he had once described
Rajaji as the best Premier. He calls Azad crafty ; Pandit
Nehru sincere but flamboyeint. He wishes well of Sardar
Patel as to him the Sardar is the only man in the Congress
‘ who has steered the ship of our newly born Bharatiya State
clear of many a rock and shoal.’

Savarkar is Sir C. V. Raman’s bright Diamond. Millions
hail him as Swatantryaveer — the hero of Independence. To
Rajaji Savarkar is a symbol of courage, bravery, fearlessness
and intense patriotism and a pioneer who strove and struggled
for inflaming the aspirations of the Indian people.' Gandhiji
paid tributes to Savarkar’s patriotism and fearlessness and said
that sacrifice was the common bond between them.'-’ Jayakar
said that to honour Savarkar was to honour patriotism and
sacrifice. M. N. Roy described him as his inspirer and a fear-
less man and appreciated his sacrifice and intellectual honesty.
Sri Srinivas Sastri hailed Savarkar as ‘ a great and fearless
patriot and added that volumes could be written about Veer
Savarkar’s yeomen services in the cause of Indian freedom.’
Mr. K. F. Nariman described Savarkar as a colourful,
picturesque and romantic personality. Bhai Parmananda said
of him that Savarkar was the fusion of Burke and Mazzini.
To Mr. S. R. Pather, Bar-at-law, South Africa, and one-tune
colleague of Savarkar, India owes her present advanced posi-
tion to Savarkar’s early struggle in the cause of freedom. To
historian Dr. Pattabhi, Savarkar is one of the noble characters
that devoted their life to this noble and patriotic task (emanci-
pation of Motherland) and who worked according to their
lights and according to the lights of the times for the emanci-
pation of India. To Guy A. Aldred, editor the Word, Glasgow,
he is a prophet, and deserves a place in the line of prophets !

But what about the aims and ideal for which Savarkar stood
and fought ? Is his life a success ? It is for the cool,
calculating and balanced history to assess man’s work with a
cold impartiality and grade it great or otherwise. Feelings,
passion;; and prejudices often affect contemporary judgment.

Reviewing this eventful life, one finds two notes of action,
which had filled the skies at the time of Savarkar’s birth and
boyhood, have echoed tin ough the life story of Savarkar. The
revolting force of Wasudeo Balw^ant, the spiritual and social
renaissance set in by Dayananda on the one hand, and the
wave of Hindu-Muslim riots and the consequential bifurcation
in the political ideal of the Hindus and Muslims on the other.
The revolutionary urge and the Hindu-Muslim problem clung
to Savarkar’s life throughout. Savarkar took a vow while
in his teens that he would fight out the British power and make
his country free, independent and great. His political ideal
was : “ India must be independent. India must be united.

India must be republican. India must have one common
tongue. India must have one common script. That script is
Nagari ; that Language is Hindi ; that republic is that national
form of Government in which the sovereign power — whether
it be exercised by a monarch or by a President matters not
much — must rest ultimately and uncompromisingly in the
hands of the Indian people.” This was the ideal for which the
Abhinava Bharat stood. This was the ideal for which the
Hindu Mahasabha stands. There is scarcely any other historic
figure under the sun that has gone through such epic ordeals
as Savarkar has done for fulfilling his vow.

The idea of bifurcation conceived by the historic Muslim
mind and started on its foot by Sir Syed Ahmed was
enthusiastically supported by the Muslims, was accepted by
the Congress leaders and ended in the vivisection of India.
As Savarkar saw independence in sight, he grew restless about
the unity and integrity of India, the concept and ideal of
which to men like Savarkar was noble, sublime and divine.
But during the period of Savarkar’s long incarceration and
internment, the Gandhian lead betrayed a woeful lack of self-
confidence in the conduct of the national struggle, ultimately



412 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

discredited the power, prestige and patriotism of the Hindus,
the national majority, undermined their confidence and
mortgaged the destiny of the country to the anti-nat ional
forces. Savarkar's insight perceived this danger and he fore-
warned the people and applied all his energies to averting
the colossal disaster which was ushered in by the Gandhian
lead. But with herculean efforts he could not avert the vivi-
section of the Motherland. The Hindu Mahasabha lacked
full-time workers. The party had no ^ dailies ’ to back up
their propaganda and leaders. There were few weeklies ixt
District places, but they also suffered foi' want of active
support. The culpable boycott of the so-called nationalist but
in fact commercialized press and the Press Agencies on
Savarkar’s statements and speeches was no less responsible
for this fate. The news agencies that could give full and
roaring publicity to Jinnah’s anti-national outbursts, state-
ments and speeches, suppressed wickedly the views, speeches
and statements of Savarkar and whenever they broadcast
them, they dropped out most pertinent criticism of the
Britishers and the Congress party and his constructive and
valuable advice to his countrymen. And when these fabricated
extracts came down to the commercialized papers, they did the
rest to Savarkar’s statements and speeches. The ignorant and
superstitious masses were not knowing what was happening.
In fact, those capitalists and moneyed men who had contribut-
ed heavily to the Congress press and propaganda for years,
were not now prepared to lose all investment by incurring
the displeasure of the ruling party in the country. In such
a state of affairs, Savarkar’s warnings went unheard and he
lost his battle for Akhand Hindusthan. That way his fate is
no better than the fate of Burke and Demosthenes, the two
great pathetic figures in the political history of the world. In
his brilliant essay on Edmund Burke, John Churton Collins
observed : “ Both (Burke and Demosthenes) animated by

the purest motives, patriots to the innermost fibre, with no
thought, with no aim, but for the public good, wore out their
lives in leading forlorn hopes and in fighting losing battles.
Both were prophets with a curse of Cassandra upon them, to
be found wiser after the event, to be believed when all was
lost.” Add the third name of Savarkar to the line of these



THE MAN


413

great orators and read the lines again. Telling his readers that
Demosthenes saw Athens at the feet of Macedonian despot,
and Burke saw England dismembered of America, Mr. Collins
goes on to say : “Of the superhuman efforts made by the
great Athenian to retrieve the disasters in which the neglect
of his warnings had involved his countrymen, there was not
one which was not thwarted either by a cruel fortune or by
the perfidy and levity of those whom he was striving in their
own despite to save.” ^ Savarkar strove his utmost to avert
the greatest betrayal in human history and the colossal
disaster, but was thwarted by the perfidy, levity and betrayal
of his contemporaries. Nevertheless, his failure was more
glorious than the ignoble success of his political opponents.

As for the Independence that came, it did not come as a
result of the Congress struggle alone which was fought out
by the Socialists in 1942. It is ludicrous to say that the battle
was fought in 1942 and the victory came in 1947. The final
victory was won when politics was carried into the Indian
Army, when patriotism took fire in the ranks of the Indian
armed forces, when militarized Indians thus inspired with a
great ideal rose in revolt under the lead of Ras Behari Bose
and Netaji Subhas Bose. The British Imperialists, consider-
ably weakened by World War II, realized that it was
impossible to keep India in bondage any more for they had no
faithful army. The army, that was entrusted with the work,
had turned their guns towards their heads. The Prime
Minister of Britain, Mr. Attlee, stated before the House of
Commons on March 15, 1946, on the occasion of making a
declaration of the proposed transfer of power to India, that
the national idea had spread right through, not the least
perhaps among some of the soldiers who had done such
wonderful service in the war. Mr. Fenner Brockway, the
Political Secretary of the Independent Labour Party of
England, gave three reasons for the transfer of power by
Britain to India. He said that the Indian people were deter-
mined to achieve Independence ; secondly, there was the
revolt of the Royal Indian Navy and that the Indian forces
could not be relied upon for serving Britain’s purposes, and

Archbold, p. 175.



414 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

thirdly, Britain did not want to estrange India which was a
great market and a source of foodstuffs for Britain. Though
Brockway did not mention directly the I.N.A., it was dear
that the revolt in the armed forces had bent them to the
inevitable. Then who had truly worked towards that end,
the carrying of the fire of patriotism into the ranks of the
Indian army ever since 1908 ? And who made heroic
attempts despite the curses of the Congressmen and Congre.ss
journals to preach militarization and impress upon patriotic
youths the importance of entering the Army, Navy and Air
Forces ? It was Savarkar and Savarkar alone. At last the
destined leader, Netaji Subhas Bose, seized the opportunity,
and reaped the fruit of the pioneer efforts of Ras Behari Bose
and the militarization policy of Savarkar. History will record
this. Viewed in this light Savarkar has achieved his goal.
The heroic war inaugurated by the heroes of 1857 for winning
back the independence was fought out to a successful end by
the sacrifice of thousands of revolutionaries of Ram Singh
Kuka, Wasudeo Balwant, the Abhinava Bharat, the Anusilan
Samiti, and other organizations in Bengal and the Ghadr ; the
heroic sufferers and patriots in the Congress, the valiant
fighters of the Party of Bhagat Singh and the pioneer services
of the Liberals.

And what about other principles for which Savarkar stood ?
The national script of India is now the Devanagari, the Lingua
Franca is now Hindi. Savarkar has been struggling hard
since 1908 for investing Hindi and the Nagari script with
national honour. That dream has been ultimately realized.
He worked for it in the Andcimans, he struggled for spreading
the movement all over the country from Ratnagiri and after
his release in 1937 the movement gathered force and at last
the Hindu Sanghatanist forces purged the Hindi Sahitya
Sammelan of Gandhian influence and won a resounding victory.
But the finishing stroke was given by Savarkar to the cult of
Hindustani during the annual session of the Hindi Sahitya
Sammelan held in Bombay in December 1947. Addressing the
Session, Savarkar warned the leaders of the Sammelan against
the threats of Gandhiji and Nehru and asked the delegates
and the one hundred and fifty one members of the Consti-
tuent Assembly who had signed their pledge to support



THE MAN


415

Sanskritized Hindi and the Nagari Script to achieve their
object in spite of those threats. He added that the interests
of the nation must be their sole concern and above the threats,
fasts and fads of Gandhiji and Nehru.

The Indian Republic has also come into being on January
26, 1950. The sovereignty is now in the hands of the people.

But this is not the end of Savarkar’s mission. For making
tliis free India an up-to-date and powei’ful nation, along with
the defence problem, the labour problem must be attended to
and solved satisfactorily. With the growing industrialization
and the growing agricultural needs, the labour problem and
the agrarian problem are coming to a head and they have
begun to affect the destiny of political parties and leaders in
India. As the labour problem affected Mazzini’s leadership
in a way in his old age, Savarkar the leader of the Hindu
Mahasabha is not less affected by it.

For the solution of the labour problem, Savarkar has his
own nationalistic approach. To him both Manu and Marx
are not infalliable and omniscient. According to him the
Marxian approach is one of the many remedies suggested for
the removal of human ills as those of Darwin and Freud, who
also diagnosed the ills of humanity in their own way. Being
a rationalist, Savarkar is not a believer in the orthodox church
of Marx. But a lover, promoter and upholder as he is of the
machine age, he understands that social equality and social
justice are the culmination of the machine age. In his scheme of
things the labour problem was upto the day of Independence
a limb of the nation that was to be set free. With the freedom
and progress of the nation, he believed that the fate of
labourers must improve. That is why he gave more
importance to the Pakistan problem that also involved
economically and politically the destiny of India and her
problem of peace and safety. National freedom and national
security are the prerequisites for practising any scheme
concerning land, labour and industries. But then the modern
youth, the laboxirers and workers did not amply understand
why Savarkar’s party was not the least moved whenever there
were unrest, agitation and strikes in the labour area. There
was a fair chance for the party to practise the principle of
national co-ordination of class interests and fight for the
workers. In fact, the much advertised socialist in Nehru is
doing the same thing. But because Savarkar had thrown all
his might and main for averting the national disaster, he had
no time to pay attention to the labour and agrarian problems.

India is now coming over to the ideal of Savarkar. If India
is to survive, she must accept Savarkarism. She must approach
all social and political problems with Savarkar 's realistic,
scientific, and nationalistic angles. She must mechanize her
agriculture, must gradually liquidate all landlordism, nation-
alize all key industries and industrialize on a broader scale.
She must Hinduise all key-posts and militarize the Hindus.
Not conflagration of class interests, but interests of the nation
should be her motto.

The ideal of Savarkar desires that India must follow her
bent. India must represent the culture of the national
majority, the Hindus. Not the prestige and greatness of one
individual, but the prosperity and security of the common
man must be her goal. It has been said of Bismark that he
made Germany great, but the Germans too small. Savarkarism
says that this should not be allowed to happen in India. Some
say that India will be a China. That cannot happen to India,
if she learns as early as possible that neither a family rule,
nor a group rule, nor one parly rule leads to the prosperity
and security of the nation, but the joint responsibility and real
democracy lead to its prosperity and security. But India
would be a Poland, if the present leadership hugs the wrong
belief that Indian history began with its rise and cuts itself
from the spirit, history and names of Vikramaditya, Shali-
vahan, Shivaji, Guru Govind Singh, Dayananda, Vivekananda
and Tilak. They are India’s representative guides, gurus,
inspirers, and saviours, who teach India how to survive with
honour and self-respect in this world. And after having made
sure of security and survival, India can look forward to
Buddha and Mahaveer.

And if India is true to these saviours, India would realize
Savarkar’s another prophecy made ten years ago. He said :

“ If you wish, O Hindus, to prosper as a great and glorious
Hindu Nation under the sun, and you will have a claim on it,
that State must be established under the Hindu Flag. This
dream would be realized during this or coming generation. If



THE MAN 417

it is not realized, I may be styled as a day-dreamer, but if it
comes true, I would stand forth as its prophet.

I am bequeathing this legacy to you.”

If in the history of modern India there is any great leader
who neither pursued fame nor followed fortune, nor individual
greatness, discarding national interests, national integrity and
national honour, that great leader is Veer Savarkar and as
such he would carry influence with posterity. As he was
not a party to the vivisection of India, which is a heritage of
sorrow and disgrace to posterity and the fu^eatest betrayal
ever known in human history, Savarkar would be a beacon-
light of hope, guidance, inspiration and courage.
