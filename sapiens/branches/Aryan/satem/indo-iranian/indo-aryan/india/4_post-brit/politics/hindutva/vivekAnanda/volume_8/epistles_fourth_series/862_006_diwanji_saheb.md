BARODA,  
*26th April,1892*.

DEAR DIWANJI SAHEB, (Shri Haridas Viharidas Desai)

Very happy to receive your kind letter even here. I had not the least
difficulty in reaching your house from the station of Nadiad. And your
brothers, they are what they should be, *your brothers*. May the Lord
shower his choicest blessings on your family. I have never found such a
glorious one in all my travels. Your friend Mr. Manibhai has provided
every comfort for me; but, as to his company, I have only seen him
twice; once for a minute, the other for ten minutes at the most when he
talked about the system of education here. Of course, I have seen the
Library and the pictures of Ravi Varma, and that is about all worth
seeing here. So I am going off this evening to Bombay. My thanks to the
Diwanji here (or to you) for his kind behaviour. More from Bombay.

Yours in affection,  
VIVEKANANDA.

PS. At Nadiad I met Mr. Manilal Nabhubhai. He is a very learned and
pious gentleman, and I enjoyed his company much.
