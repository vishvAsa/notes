## CLXXXII

*To Sister Nivedita*

6, PLACE DES ETATS UNIS,  
PARIS,

*23rd August 1900*.

DEAR NIVEDITA,

The manuscript accounts of the Math just reached. It is delightful
reading. I am so pleased with it.

I am going to print a thousand or more to be distributed in England,
America and India. I will only add a begging paragraph in the end.

What do you think the cost will be?

With love to you and Mrs. Bull,  
VIVEKANANDA.
