Being a conservative and religious traditional Hindu is never enough, being a political Hindu matters a lot more. Narasimhan Rao used to think being a South Indian Brahmin who could quote scripture and Sanskrit meant he would have enough sway with BJP, RSS, VHP leaders that Babri would never fall. He was wrong.

Rao personally met Advani in a safe house in the last week of December where he was given assurance Babri wouldn't fall. Kalyan Singh had also given his word, so had Bhairon Singh Shekhawat. Rao had decided not to dismiss the Kalyan Singh government on the basis of all these assurances.

2 lakh Kar Sevaks had gathered around Ayodhya. 12 pm, December 6, 1992 the destruction of Babri would begin like a long line of dominoes falling one after the other.

When Rao was informed the first dome had fallen he couldn't talk for some minutes. He felt betrayed by all the Hindu leaders that had assured him Babri would stand. Kalyan Singh and the BJP Government swung into action to make sure the mosque fell without any CRPF intervention.
