Indira Gandhi knew the future of Hindus was not safe in Bangladesh, and left on its own, it would be as anti-India as Pakistan. What started in 1971 was not yet finished.

She authorized RAW to prepare a detailed paper on how to contain anti-India elements and promote pro-India elements. She authorized RAW in 1973 to extend its network deep throughout BD, as well as to identify, train and support the Bangladeshi Hindu youth leaders - both living in Bangladesh and those living in the refugee camps of WB.

Especially after the assassination of Mujeeb, RAW helped Bangladeshi Hindus develop militant organizations like Banga Bhumi and Vir Banga. There were many more.

According to contemporary allegations by BD politicians, some BD Hindu and Chakma refugee youth were taken by RAW to a special Indian Army camp built for them in Himachal, and provided detailed training.

WB then had a Congress government. (The last it had in WB). With CM SS Ray’s blessings, some of these BD Hindu orgs operated on this side of border. Young Pranab Mukherjee was the chief liaison with late Mujeeb’s family and supporters.

Emergency allowed Indira Gandhi to do what she wanted without answering any questions,

In 1977, Indira Gandhi was booted out. Morarji Desai govt came. Morarji and Vajpayee (FM) met BD dictator (Zia of East) multiple times despite their short stint.

For friendly relations with Zia (Khalida’s husband) - whom Indira Gandhi always kept under pressure - Janata Party government minimized the RAW operations in BD. Bangladeshi Hindu camps were shut down. Jyoti Basu stopped all local support on this side of Bengal.

A WikiLeaks cable from the US embassy in Dhaka to Washington DC one of those days, documents Zia administration hoping for the electoral victory of Janata Party.

Just coincidently, according to some books, one of those militant underground BD Hindu youth groups had a flag - a 1/3 vertical green rectangle with 2/3 saffron rectangle - almost the future BJP flag - with a Sun in the middle.
