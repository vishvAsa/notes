*To Miss Josephine MacLeod*

HIGH VIEW, CAVERSHAM,  
READING, ENGLAND,  
*October, 1895*.

DEAR JOE JOE,

I was so glad to hear from you. I was afraid you had forgotten me.

I am going to have a few lectures in and about London. One of them, a
public one, will be at Princes' Hall on the 22nd at 8-30.

Come over and try to form a class. I have as yet done almost nothing
here. Of course, breaking the ice is slow always. It took me two years
in America to work up that little which we had in New York.

With love for all, 

Yours ever,

VIVEKANANDA.
