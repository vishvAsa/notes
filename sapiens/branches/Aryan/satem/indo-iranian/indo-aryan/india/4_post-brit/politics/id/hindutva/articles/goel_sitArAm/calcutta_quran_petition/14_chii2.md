Calcutta - 1.

Dear Sir,

**Sub: Request for proscription of ‘Koran’.**

Please refer to my letter dated 20th July, 1984, (delivered in your
office on the same date) in which I had made a request for forfeiture of
the Islamic book, Koran, for the reason that it contains numerous
sayings of Prophet Muhammad which on ground of religion promote
disharmony, feeling of enmity, hatred and ill-will between different
religious communities; incite people to commit violence and disturb
public tranquility and outrage or insult other religions and the
religious feelings of other communities in India, which render the book
liable to be forfeited to the Government in terms of Section 95 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, read with Sections 153A and 295A of
the Indian Penal Code.

I had also enclosed some three annexures to my said letter wherein I had
reproduced some of those sayings of the book.

Since you do not seem to have given due consideration to my letter, I
would request you, once again, to attend to this matter early.

A copy of my said letter dated 20th July, 1984, is enclosed for your
ready reference.

Enclo: As above.
