CHAPTER V

WEAKENING OF THE DEFENCES

  

 How will the creation of Pakistan affect the question of the Defence
of Hindustan? The question is not a very urgent one. For there is no
reason to suppose that Pakistan will be at war with Hindustan
immediately it is brought into being. Nevertheless, as the question is
sure to be raised, it is better to deal with it.

 The question may be considered under three heads: (1) Question of
Frontiers, (2) Question of Resources and (3) Question of Armed Forces.  


  

I -- QUESTION OF FRONTIERS

 It is sure to be urged by the Hindus that Pakistan leaves Hindustan
without a scientific frontier. The obvious reply, of course, is that the
Musalmans cannot be asked to give up their right to Pakistan, because it
adversely affects the Hindus in the matter of their boundaries. But
banter apart, there are really two considerations, which, if taken into
account, will show that the apprehensions of the Hindus in this matter
are quite uncalled for.

 In the first place, can any country hope to have a frontier which
may be called scientific? As Mr. Davies, the author of **North-West
Frontier**, observes:

> "It would be impossible to demarcate on the North-West of our Indian
> Empire a frontier which would satisfy ethnological, political and
> military requirements. To seek for a zone which traverses easily
> definable geographical features; which does not violate ethnic
> considerations by cutting through the territories of closely related
> tribes; and which at the same time serves as a political boundary, is
> Utopian."

 As a matter of history, there has been no one scientific boundary
for India and different persons have advocated different boundaries for
India. The question of boundaries has given rise to two policies, the
"Forward" Policy and the "Back to the Indus" Policy. The "Forward"
Policy had a greater and a lesser intent, to use the language of Sir
George Macmunn. In its greater intent, it meant active control in the
affairs of Afghanistan as an *Etat Tampion* to India and the extension
of Indian influence up to the Oxus. In its lesser intent, it was
confined to the absorption of the tribal hills between the administered
territory (i.e. the Province of N.-W.F.) and Afghanistan as defined by
the Durand Line and the exercise of British control right up to that
line. The greater intent of the Forward Policy, as a basis for a safe
boundary for India, has long been abandoned. Consequently, there remain
three possible boundary lines to choose from: (1) the Indus River, (2)
the present administrative boundary of the N.-W. F. P. and (3) the
Durand Line. Pakistan will no doubt bring the boundary of Hindustan back
to the Indus, indeed behind the Indus, to the Sutlej. But this "Back to
the Indus" policy was not without its advocates. The greatest exponent
of the Indus boundary was Lord Lawrence, who was strongly opposed to any
forward move beyond the trans-Indus foot-hills. He advocated meeting any
invader in the valley of the Indus. In his opinion, it would be an act
of folly and weakness to give battle at any great distance from the
Indus base; and the longer the distance an invading army has to march
through Afghanistan and the tribal country, the more harassed it would
be. Others, no doubt, have pointed out that a river is a weak line of
defence. But the principal reason for not retiring to the Indus boundary
seems to lie elsewhere. Mr. Davies gives the real reason when he says
that the

> "'Back to Indus' cry becomes absurd when it is examined from the point
> of view of the inhabitants of the modern North-West Frontier Province.
> Not only would withdrawal mean loss of prestige, but it would also be
> a gross betrayal of those peoples to whom we have extended our
> beneficent rule."

 In fact, it is no use insisting that any particular boundary is the
safest, for the simple reason that geographical conditions are not
decisive in the world today and modern technique has robbed natural
frontiers of much of their former importance, even where they are mighty
mountains, the broadest streams, widest seas or far-stretching deserts.

 In the second place, it is always possible for nations with no
natural boundaries to make good this defect. Countries are not wanting
which have no natural boundaries. Yet, all have made good the
deficiencies of nature, by creating artificial fortifications as
barriers, which can be far more impregnable than natural barriers. There
is no reason to suppose that the Hindus will not be able to accomplish
what other countries similarly situated have done. Given the resources,
Hindus need have no fear for want of a naturally safe frontier.  


  

II -- QUESTION OF RESOURCES

 More important than the question of a scientific frontier, is the
question of resources. If resources are ample for the necessary
equipment, then it is always possible to overcome the difficulties
created by an unscientific or a weak frontier. We must, therefore,
consider the comparative resources of Pakistan and Hindustan. The
following figures are intended to convey an idea of their comparative
resources:—  


|                                            |
|--------------------------------------------|
| [RESOURCES OF PAKISTAN](tables/205ab.html) |

|                                                  |
|--------------------------------------------------|
| [RESOURCES OF HINDUSTAN](tables/205ab.html#205b) |

 These are gross figures. They are subject to certain additions and
deductions. Revenues derived by the Central Government from Railways,
Currency and Post and Telegraphs are not included in these figures, as
it is not possible to ascertain how much is raised from each Province.
When it is done, certain additions will have to be made to the figures
under revenue. There can be no doubt that the share from these heads of
revenue that will come to Hindustan, will be much larger than the share
that will go to Pakistan. Just as additions will have to be made to
these figures, so also deductions will have to be made from them. Most
of these deductions will, of course, fall to the lot of Pakistan. As
will be shown later, some portion of the Punjab will have to be excluded
from the scheme of Western Pakistan. Similarly, some portion of Bengal
will have to be excluded from the proposed Eastern Pakistan, although a
district from Assam will have to be added to it. According to me,
fifteen districts will have to be excluded from Bengal and thirteen
districts shall have to be excluded from the Punjab. Sufficient data are
not available to enable any one to give an exact idea of what would be
the reduction in the area, population and revenue, that would result
from the exclusion of these districts. One may, however, hazard the
guess that so far as the Punjab and Bengal are concerned, their revenues
would be halved. What is lost by Pakistan by this exclusion, will of
course be gained by Hindustan. To put it in concrete terms, while the
revenues of Western and Eastern Pakistan will be 60 crores minus 24
crores, i.e., 36 crores, the revenues of Hindustan will be about 96
crores plus 24 crores, i.e., 120 crores.

 The study of these figures, in the light of the observations I have
made, will show that the resources of Hindustan are far greater than the
resources of Pakistan, whether one considers the question in terms of
area, population or revenue. There need, therefore, be no apprehension
on the score of resources. For, the creation of Pakistan will not leave
Hindustan in a weakened condition.  


  

III -- QUESTION OF ARMED FORCES

 The defence of a country does not depend so much upon its scientific
frontier as it does upon its resources. But more than resources does it
depend upon the fighting forces available to it.

 What are the fighting forces available to Pakistan and to Hindustan
?

 The Simon Commission pointed out, as a special feature of the Indian
Defence Problem, that there were special areas which alone offered
recruits to the Indian Army and that there were other areas which
offered none or if at all, very few. The facts revealed in the following
table, taken from the Report of the Commission, undoubtedly will come as
a most disagreeable surprise to many Indians, who think and care about
the defence of India:  


|                                                      |
|------------------------------------------------------|
| [AREAS OF INDIAN ARMY RECRUITMENT](tables/205c.html) |

 The Simon Commission found that this state of affairs was natural to
India, and in support of it, cited the following figures of recruitment
from the different Provinces of India during the Great War especially
because "it cannot be suggested that any discouragement was offered to
recruitment in any area":  


|                                                             |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| [AREAS OF RECRUITMENT DURING WORLD WAR I](tables/205d.html) |

 These data reveal in a striking manner that the fighting forces
available for the defence of India mostly come from areas which are to
be included in Pakistan. From this it may be argued, that without
Pakistan, Hindustan cannot defend itself.

 The facts brought out by the Simon Commission are, of course, beyond
question. But they cannot be made the basis of a conclusion, such as is
suggested by the Simon Commission, namely, that only Pakistan can
produce soldiers and that Hindustan cannot. That such a conclusion is
quite untenable will be seen from the following considerations.

 In the first place, what is regarded by the Simon Commission as
something peculiar to India is not quite so peculiar. What appears to be
peculiar is not due to any inherent defect in the people. The
peculiarity arises because of the policy of recruitment followed by the
British Government for years past. The official explanation of this
predominance in the Indian Army of the men of the North-West is that
they belong to the Martial Classes. But Mr. Chaudhari**[/1/](#n01)**
has demonstrated, by unimpeachable data, that this explanation is far
from being true. He has shown that the predominance in the Army of the
men of the North-West took place as early as the Mutiny of 1857, some 20
years before the theory of Martial and Non-martial Classes was projected
in an indistinct form for the first time in 1879 by the Special Army
Committee.**[/2/](#n02)** appointed in that year, and that their
predominance had nothing to do with their alleged fighting qualities but
was due to the fact, that they helped the British to suppress the Mutiny
in which the Bengal Army was so completely involved. To quote Mr.
Chaudhari:

> "The pre-Mutiny army of Bengal was essentially a Brahmin and Kshalriya
> army of the Ganges basin. All the three Presidency Armies of those
> days, as we have slated in the first part of this article, were in a
> sense quite representative of the military potentialities of the areas
> to which they belonged, though none of them could, strictly speaking,
> be correctly described as national armies of the provinces concerned,
> as there was no attempt to draw upon any but the traditional martial
> elements of the population. But they all got their recruits mainly
> from their natural areas of recruitment, viz., the Madras Army from
> the Tamil and Telugu countries, the Bombay Army from Western India,
> and the Bengal Army from Bihar and U. P. and to a very limited extent
> from Bengal. There was no official restriction on the enrolment of men
> of any particular tribe or caste or region, provided they were
> otherwise eligible. Leaving aside for the moment the practice of the
> Bombay and the Madras Armies, the only exception to this general rule
> in the Bengal Army was that which applied to the Punjabis and Sikhs,
> who, inspite of their magnificent military traditions, were not given
> a fair representation in the Army of Northern India. Their
> recruitment, on the contrary, was placed under severe restrictions by
> an order of the Government, which laid down that 'the number of
> Punjabis in a regiment is never to exceed 200, nor are more than 100
> of them lobe Sikhs.' It was only the revolt of the Hindustani
> regiments of the Bengal Army that gave an opportunity to the Punjabis
> to rehabilitate themselves in the eyes of the British authorities.
> Till then, they remained suspect and under a ban, and the Bengal Army
> on the eve of the Mutiny was mainly recruited from Oudh, North and
> South Bihar, especially the latter, principally Shahabad and Bhojpur,
> the Doab of the Ganges and Jumna and Rohilkhund. The soldiers
> recruited from these areas were mostly high-caste men. Brahmins of all
> denominations, Kshatriyas, Rajputs and Ahirs. The average proportion
> in which these classes were enrolled in a regiment was: (1) Brahmin
> 7/24, (2) Rajputs 1/4, (3) Inferior Hindus 1/6, (4) Musalmans 1/6, (5)
> Punjabis 1/8.
>
> "To this army, the area which now-a-days furnishes the greatest number
> of soldiers—the Punjab, Nepal, N.-W. F. Province, the hill tracts of
> Kumaon and Garhwal, Rajpulana,—furnished very few recruits or none at
> all. There was practical exclusion in it of all the famous fighting
> castes of India,—Sikhs, Gurkhas, Punjabi Musalmans, Dogras, Jats,
> Pathans, Garhwalis, Rajpulana Rajpuls, Kumaonis, Gujars, all the
> tribes and seels, in fact, which are looked upon today as a tower of
> strength of the Indian Army. A single year and a single rebellion was,
> however, to change all this. The Mutiny, which broke out in 1857, blew
> up the old Bengal Army and brought into existence a Punjabized and
> barbarized army, resembling the Indian Army of today in broad lines
> and general proportions of its composition.
>
> "The gaps created by the revolt of the Hindustani regiments (of the
> Bengal Army) were at once filled up by Sikhs and other Punjabis, and
> hillmen eager for revenge and for the loot of the cities of Hindustan.
> They had all been conquered and subjugated by the British with the
> help of the Hindustani soldiers, and in their ignorance, they regarded
> the Hindustanis, rather the handful of British, as their real enemies.
> This enmity was magnificently exploited by the British authorities in
> suppressing the Mutiny. When the news of the enlistment of Gurkhas
> reached Lord Dalhousie in England he expressed great satisfaction and
> wrote to a friend: 'Against the Oudh Sepoys they may confidently be
> expected to fight like devils.' And after the Mutiny, General
> Mansfield, the Chief of the Staff of the Indian Army, wrote about the
> Sikhs: 'It was not because they loved us, but because they hated
> Hindustan and hated the Bengal Army that the Sikhs had flocked to our
> standard instead of seeking the opportunity to strike again for their
> freedom. They wanted to revenge themselves and to gain riches by the
> plunder of Hindustani cities. They were not attracted by mere daily
> pay, it was rather the prospect of wholesale plunder and stamping on
> the heads of their enemies. In short, we turned to profit the *esprit
> de corps* of the old Khalsa Army of Ranjit Singh, in the manner which
> for a time would most effectually bind the Sikhs to us as long as the
> active service against their old enemies may last."
>
> "The relations thus established were in fact to last much longer. The
> services rendered by the Sikhs and Gurkhas during the Mutiny were not
> forgotten and henceforward the Punjab and Nepal had the place of
> honour in the Indian Army."

 That Mr. Chaudhari is right when he says that it was the Mutiny of
1857 which was the real cause of the preponderance in the Indian Army of
the men of the North-West is beyond the possibility of doubt. Equally
incontrovertible is the view of Mr. Chaudhari that this preponderance of
the men of the North-West is not due to their native superiority in
fighting qualities, as the same is amply borne out by the figures which
he has collected, showing the changes in the composition of the Indian
Infantry before and after the Mutiny.  


[TABLE]

 These figures show that in 1856, one year before the Mutiny, the men
from the North-West were a negligible factor in the Indian Army. But in
1858, one year after the Mutiny, they had acquired a dominant position
which has never received a setback.

 It will thus be seen that the distinction between Martial and
Non-martial Classes, which was put forth for the first time in 1879, as
a matter of principle, which was later on insisted upon as a matter of
serious consideration by Lord Roberts**[/3/](#n03)** and which was
subsequently recognised by Lord Kitchener as a principle governing
recruitment to the Indian Army, had nothing to do with the origin of
this preponderance of the men of the North-West in the Indian Army. No
doubt, the accident that the people from North-West India had the good
luck of being declared by the Government as belonging to the Martial
Class, while most of the classes coming from the rest of India had the
ill-luck of being declared Non-martial Classes had important
consequences. Being regularly employed in the Army, the people of
North-West India came to look upon service in the Army as an occupation
with a security and a career which was denied to men from the rest of
India. The large number of recruits drawn from North-West India,
therefore, indicates nothing more than this—namely, owing to the policy
of the British Government, service in the Army has become their
occupation and if people in other parts of India do not readily come
forth to enlist in the Army, the reason is that Government did not
employ them in the Army. People follow their ancestral occupations
whether they like it or not. When a people do not take to a new
occupation it does not necessarily mean that they are not fit for it. It
only means that it is not their ancestral occupation.

 This division between Martial and Non-martial Classes is, of course,
a purely arbitrary and artificial distinction. It is as foolish as the
Hindu theory of caste, making birth, instead of worth, the basis for
recognition. At one time, the Government insisted that the distinction
they had adopted was a real distinction and that in terms of fighting
qualities, it meant so much fighting value. In fact, this was their
justification for recruiting more men from the North-West of India. That
this distinction has nothing to do with any difference in fighting
qualities has now been admitted. Sir Phillip Chetwode,**[/4/](#n04)**
late Commander-in-Chief of India, broadcasting from London on the
constitution of the Indian Army, took pains to explain that the
recruitment of a larger proportion of it from the Punjab, did not mean
that the people of the Peninsula were without martial qualities. Sir
Phillip Chetwode explained that the reason why men of the North were
largely recruited for the Indian Army was chiefly climatic, as the men
from the South cannot stand the extremes of heat and cold of North
India. No race can be permanently without martial spirit. Martial spirit
is not a matter of native instinct. It is a matter of training and
anybody can be trained to it.

 But apart from this, there is enough fighting material in Hindustan,
besides what might be produced by special training. There are the Sikhs,
about whose fighting equalities nothing need be said. There are the
Rajputs who are even now included in the category of Martial Classes. In
addition to these, there are the Mahrattas who proved their calibre as a
fighting race during the last European War. Even the people of the
Madras Presidency can be depended upon for military purposes. Speaking
of the Madrasis as soldiers, General Sir Frederick P. Haines, at one
time Commander-in-Chief in India, observed:

> "It has been customary to declare that the Madras Army is composed of
> men physically inferior to those of the Bengal Army, and if stature
> alone be taken into consideration, this is true. It is also said that
> by the force of circumstances the martial feeling and the
> characteristics necessary to the real soldier are no longer to be
> found in its ranks. I feel bound to reject the above assertions and
> others which ascribe comparative inefficiency to Madras troops. It is
> true that in recent years they have seen but little service; for, with
> the exception of the sappers, they have been specially excluded from
> all participation in work in the field. I cannot admit for one moment
> that anything has occurred to disclose the fact that the Madras Sepoy
> is inferior as a fighting man. The facts of history warrant us in
> assuming the contrary. In drill training and discipline, the Madras
> Sepoy is inferior to none; while in point of health, as exhibited by
> returns, he compares favourably with his neighbours. This has been
> manifested by the sappers and their followers in the Khyber; and the
> sappers are of the same race as the Sepoys."

 Hindustan need, therefore, have no apprehension regarding the supply
of an adequate fighting force from among its own people. The separation
of Pakistan cannot weaken her in that respect.

 The Simon Commission drew attention to three features of the Indian
Army, which struck them as being special and peculiar to India. It
pointed out that the duty of the Army in India was two-fold; firstly, to
prevent the independent tribes on the Indian side of the Afghan frontier
from raiding the peaceful inhabitants of the plains below. Secondly, to
protect India against invasion by countries lying behind and beyond this
belt of unorganized territories. The Commission took note of the fact
that from 1850 to 1922, there were 72 expeditions against the
independent tribes, an average of one a year, and also of the fact that
in the countries behind and beyond this belt of unorganized territory,
lies the direction from which, throughout the ages, the danger to
India's territorial integrity has come. This quarter is occupied by
"States which according to the Commission are not members of the League
of Nations" and is, therefore, a greater danger to India now than
before. The Commission insisted on emphasizing that these two facts
constituted a peculiar feature of the problem of military defence in
India and so far as the urgency and extent of the problem is concerned,
they are "without parallel elsewhere in the Empire, and constituted a
difficulty in developing self-government which never arose in any
comparable degree in the case of the self-governing Dominions."

 As a second unique feature of the Indian Army, the Commission
observed:

> "The Army in India is not only provided and organized to ensure
> against external dangers of a wholly exceptional character: it is also
> distributed and habitually used throughout India for the purpose of
> maintaining or restoring internal peace. In all countries. . . .the
> military is not normally employed in this way, and certainly is not
> organized for this purpose. But the case of India is entirely
> different. Troops are employed many times a year to prevent internal
> disorder and, if necessary, to quell it. Police forces, admirably
> organized as they are, cannot be expected in all cases to cope with
> the sudden and violent outburst of a mob driven frantic by religious
> frenzy. It is, therefore, well understood in India both by the police
> and by the military—and, what is even more to the point, by the public
> at large—that the soldiers may have to be sent for. . . .This use of
> the Army for the purpose of maintaining or restoring internal order
> was increasing rather than diminishing, and that on these occasions
> the practically universal request was for British troops. The
> proportion of the British to Indian troops allotted to this duty has
> in fact risen in the last quarter of a century. The reason, of course,
> is that the British soldier is a neutral, and is under no suspicion of
> favouring Hindus against Mahomedans or Mahomedans against Hindus. . .
> .Inasmuch as the vast majority of the disturbances which call for the
> intervention of the military have a communal or religious complexion,
> it is natural and inevitable that the intervention which is most
> likely to be authoritative should be that which has no bias, real or
> suspected, to either side. It is a striking fact in this connection
> that, while in regular units of the Army in India as a whole British
> soldiers are in a minority of about 1 to 2 1/2, in the troops allotted
> for internal security the preponderance is reversed, and for this
> purpose a majority of British troops is employed—in the troops
> ear-marked for internal security the proportion is about eight British
> to seven Indian soldiers."

 Commenting upon this feature of the Indian Army the Commission said:

> "When, therefore, one contemplates a future for India in which, in
> place of the existing Army organization, the country is defended and
> pacified by exclusively Indian units, just as Canada relies on
> Canadian troops and Ireland on Irish troops, it is essential to
> realize and bear in mind the dimensions and character of the Indian
> problem of internal order and the part which the British soldier at
> present plays (to the general satisfaction of the country-side) in
> supporting peaceful government."

 The third unique feature of the Indian Army, which was pointed out
by the Simon Commission, is the preponderance in it of the men from the
North-West. The origin of this preponderance and the reasons underlying
the official explanation given therefor have already been examined.

 But, there is one more special feature of the Indian Army to which
the Commission made no reference at all. The commission either ignored
it or was not aware of it. It is such an important feature that it
overshadows all the three features to which the Commission refers, in
its importance and in its social and political consequences.

 It is a feature which, if widely known, will set many people to
think furiously. It is sure to raise questions which may prove insoluble
and which may easily block the path of India's political
progress—questions of far greater importance and complexity than those
relating to Indianization of the Army.

 This neglected feature relates to the communal composition of the
Indian Army. Mr. Chaudhari has collected the relevant data in his
articles, already referred to, which throws a flood of light on this
aspect of the Indian Army. The following table shows the proportion of
soldiers serving in the Indian Infantry, according to the area and the
community from which they are drawn:  


|                                                                            |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [CHANGES IN THE COMMUNAL COMPOSITION OF THE INDIAN ARMY](tables/205f.html) |

 This table brings out in an unmistakable manner the profound changes
which have been going on in the communal composition of the Indian Army,
particularly after 1919. They are (1) a phenomenal rise in the strength
of the Punjabi Musalman and the Pathan, (2) a substantial reduction in
the position of Sikhs from first to third, (3) the degradation of the
Rajputs to the fourth place, and (4) the shutting out of the U. P.
Brahmins, the Madrasi Musalmans, and the Tamilians, both Brahmins and
Non-Brahmins.

 A further analysis of the figures for 1930, which discloses the
communal composition of the Indian Infantry and Indian Cavalry, has been
made by Mr. Chaudhari in the following table.  


|                                                                     |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [COMMUNAL COMPOSITION OF THE INDIAN ARMY IN 1930](tables/205g.html) |

Reducing these figures in terms of communities, we get the following
percentage as it stood in 1930 :—  


|                                                                        |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [COMMUNAL PERCENTAGES IN INFANTRY AND CAVALRY, 1930](tables/205h.html) |

 These figures show the communal composition of the Indian Army. The
Musalmans according to Mr. Chaudhari formed 36% of the Indian Infantry
and 30% of the Indian Cavalry.

 These figures relate to the year 1930. We must now find out what
changes have taken place since then in this proportion.

 It is one of the most intriguing things in the Military history of
India that no information is available on this point after 1930. It is
impossible to know what the proportion of the Muslims in the Indian Army
at present is. There is no Government publication from which such
information can be gathered. In the past, there was no dearth of
publications giving this information. It is very surprising that they
should have now disappeared, or if they do appear, that they should
cease to contain this information. Not only is there no Government
publication containing information on this point, but Government has
refused to give any information on the point when asked by members of
the Central Legislative Assembly. The following questions and answers
taken from the proceedings of the Central Legislative Assembly show how
Government has been strenuously combating every attempt to obtain
information on the point.

 There was an interpellation on 15th September 1938, when the
following questions were asked and replies as stated below were given:—

 This conspiracy of silence on the part of the Government of India,
was quite recently broken by the Secretary of State for India, who came
forward to give the fullest information on this most vital and most
exciting subject, in answer to a question in the House of Commons. From
his answer given on 8th July 1943 we know the existing communal and
provincial composition of the Indian Army to be as follows :—  


|                                                                      |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [PROVINCIAL COMPOSITION OF THE INDIAN ARMY, 1943](tables/205ij.html) |

|                                                                         |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [COMMUNAL COMPOSITION OF THE INDIAN ARMY, 1943](tables/205ij.html#205j) |

 The information given by the Secretary of State is indeed very
welcome. But, this is the war-time composition of the Indian Army. The
peace-time composition must be very different. It rested on the
well-known distinction between the Martial and Non-Martial Races. That
distinction was abolished during the War. There is, however, no
certainty that it will not be revived now that peace has returned. What
we want to know is the peacetime communal composition of the Indian
Army. That still remains an unknown fact and a subject of speculation.

 Some say that the normal pre-war proportion of Muslims was between
60 and 70 percent. Others say that it is somewhere in the neighbourhood
of 50 percent. In the absence of exact information, one could well adopt
the latter figure as disclosing the true situation especially, when on
inquiry, it happens to be confirmed by those who are in a position to
form some idea on the matter. Even if the proportion be 50% it is high
enough to cause alarm to the Hindus. If this is true, it is a flagrant
violation of well-established principles of British Army policy in
India, adopted after the Mutiny.

 After the Mutiny, the British Government ordered two investigations
into the organization of the Indian Army. The first investigation was
carried out by the Peel Commission which was appointed in 1859. The
second investigation was undertaken by a body called the Special Army
Committee, appointed in 1879, to which reference has already been made.

 The principal question considered by the Peel Commission was to find
out the weaknesses in the Bengal Army which led to the Mutiny of 1857.
The Peel Commission was told by witness after witness that the principal
weakness in the Bengal Army which mutinied was that

> "In the ranks of the regular Army men stood mixed up as chance might
> befall. There was no separating by class and clan into companies. . .
> .In the lines, Hindu and Mahomedan, Sikh and Poorbeah were mixed up,
> so that each and all lost to some extent their racial prejudice and
> became inspired with one common sentiment."**[/10/](#n10)**

 It was, therefore, proposed by Sir John Lawrence that in organizing
the Indian Army care should be taken "to preserve that distinctiveness
which is so valuable, and while it lasts, makes the Mahomedan of one
country despise, fear or dislike the Mahomedan of another; Corps should
in future be provincial, and adhere to the geographical limits within
which differences and rivalries are strongly marked. Let all races,
Hindu or Mahomedan of one province be enlisted in one regiment and no
others, and having created distinctive regiments, let us keep them so,
against the hour of need. . . .By the system thus indicated two great
evils are avoided: firstly, that community of feeling throughout the
native army and that mischievous political activity and intrigue which
results from association with other races and travel in other Indian
provinces."**[/11/](#n11)**

 This proposal was supported by many military men before the Peel
Commission and was recommended by it as a principle of Indian Army
Policy. This principle was known as the principle of Class Composition.

 The Special Army Committee of 1879 was concerned with quite a
different problem. What the problem was, becomes manifest from the
questionnaire issued by the Committee. The questionnaire included the
following question :—

> "If the efficient and available reserve of the Indian Army is
> considered necessary for the safety of the Empire, should it not be
> recruited and maintained from those parts of the country which give us
> best soldiers, rather than among the weakest and least warlike races
> of India, due regard, of course, being had to the necessity of not
> giving too great strength or prominence to any particular race or
> religious group and with due regard to the safety of the Empire?"

 The principal part of the question is obviously the necessity or
otherwise of "not giving too great strength or prominence to any
particular race or religious group." On this question official opinion
expressed before the Committee was unanimous.

 Lt.-General H.J.Warres, Commander-in-Chief of the Bombay Army,
stated:—

> "I consider it is not possible to recruit the reserve of the Indian
> Army altogether from those parts of India which are said to produce
> best soldiers, without giving undue strength and prominence to the
> races and religions of these countries."

 The Commander-in-Chief, Sir Frederick P. Haines, said:—

> "Distinct in race, language and interests from the more numerous Army
> of Bengal, it is, in my opinion, eminently politic and wise to
> maintain these armies (the Madras and Bombay Armies) as a counterpoise
> to it, and I would in no way diminish their strength in order that a
> reserve composed of what is called 'the most efficient fighting men
> whom it is possible to procure' may be established. If by this it is
> meant to replace Sepoys of Madras and Bombay by a reserve of men
> passed through the ranks of the Bengal Army and composed of the same
> classes of which it is formed, I would say, that anything more unwise
> or more impolitic could hardly be conceived."

 The Lt.-Governor of the Punjab also shared this view. He too
declared that he was "opposed to having one recruiting field for the
whole armies" in India. "It will be necessary," he added, "for political
reasons, to prevent preponderance of one nationality."

 The Special Committee accepted this view and recommended that the
composition of the Indian Army should be so regulated that there should
be no predominance of any one community or nationality in the Army.

These two principles have the governing principles of Indian Army
policy. Having regard to the principle laid down by the Special Army
Committee of 1879, the changes that have taken place in the communal
composition of the Indian Army amount to a complete revolution. How this
revolution was allowed to take place is beyond comprehension. It is a
revolution which has taken place in the teeth of a well-established
principle. The principle was really suggested by the fear of the growing
predominance of the men of the North-West in the Indian Army and was
invoked with the special object of curbing that tendency. The principle
was not only enunciated as a rule of guidance but was taken to be
rigorously applied. Lord Roberts, who was opposed to this principle
because it set a limit upon the recruitment of his pet men of the
North-West, had to bow to this principle during his regime as the
Commander-in-Chief of India. So well was the principle respected that
when in 1903, Lord Kitchener entered upon the project of converting
fifteen regiments of Madrasis into Punjab regiments, he immediately set
up a counterpoise to the Sikhs and the Punjabi Musalmans by raising the
proportion of the Gurkhas and the Pathans. As Sir George Arthur, his
biographer, says:—

> "The Government, mindful of the lesson taught by the Mutiny, was alive
> to the danger of allowing any one element in the Indian Army to
> preponderate unduly. An increase in the Punjabee infantry had as its
> necessary sequel a further recruitment of the valuable Gurkha material
> and the enlistment of more trans-borderPathans in the Frontier
> Militia."

 That a principle, so unanimously upheld and so rigorously applied
upto the period of the Great War, should have been thrown to the wind
after the Great War, without ceremony and without compunction and in a
clandestine manner, is really beyond comprehension. What is the reason
which has led the British to allow so great a preponderance of the
Muslims in the Indian Army? Two explanations are possible. One is that
the Musalmans really proved, in the Great War, that they were better
soldiers than the Hindus. The second explanation is that the British
have broken the rule and have given the Musalmans such a dominating
position in the Army because they wanted to counteract the forces of the
Hindu agitation for wresting political power from the  
hands of the British.

 Whatever be the explanation, two glaring facts stand out from the
above survey. One is that the Indian Army today is predominantly Muslim
in its composition. The other is that the Musalmans who predominate are
the Musalmans from the Punjab and the N.W.F. P. Such a composition of
the Indian Army means that the Musalmans of the Punjab and the N. W. F.
P. are made the sole defenders of India from foreign invasion. So patent
has this fact become that the Musalmans of the Punjab and the N. W. F.
P. are quite conscious of this proud position which has been assigned to
them by the British, for reasons best known to them. For, one often
hears them say that they are the 'gatekeepers' of India. The Hindus must
consider the problem of the defence of India in the light of this
crucial fact.

 How far can the Hindus depend upon these 'gate-keepers' to hold the
gate and protect the liberty and freedom of India? The answer to this
question must depend upon who comes to force the gate open. It is
obvious that there are only two foreign countries which are likely to
force this gate from the North-West side of India, Russia or
Afghanistan, the borders of both of which touch the border of India.
Which of them will invade India and when, no one can say definitely. If
the invasion came from Russia, it may be hoped that these gate-keepers
of India will be staunch and loyal enough to hold the gate and stop the
invader. But supposethe Afghans singly or in combination with other
Muslim States march on India, will these gate-keepers stop the invaders
or will they open the gates and let them in? This is a question which no
Hindu can afford to ignore. This is a question on which every Hindu must
feel assured, because it is the most crucial question.

 It is possible to say that Afghanistan will never think of invading
India. But a theory is best tested by examining its capacity to meet the
worst case. The loyalty and dependability of this Army of the Punjabi
and N.W.F. P. Muslims can only be tested by considering how it will be
have in the event of an invasion by the Afghans. Will they respond to
the call of the land of their birth or will they be swayed by the call
of their religion, is the question which must be faced if ultimate
security is to be obtained. It is not safe to seek to escape from these
annoying and discomforting questions by believing that we need not worry
about a foreign invasion so long as India is under the protection of the
British. Such a complacent attitude is unforgivable to say the least. In
the first place, the last war has shown that a situation may arise when
Great Britain may not be able to protect India, although, that is the
time when India needs her protection most. Secondly, the efficiency of
an institution must be tested under natural conditions and not under
artificial conditions. The behaviour of the Indian soldier under British
control is artificial. His behaviour when he is under Indian control is
his natural behaviour. British control does not allow much play to the
natural instincts and natural sympathies of the men in the Army. That is
why the men in the Army behave so well. But that is an artificial and
not a natural condition. That the Indian Army behaves well under British
control is no guarantee of its good behaviour under Indian control. A
Hindu must be satisfied that it will behave as well when British control
is withdrawn.

 The question how this army of the Punjabi and the N.W.F. P. Muslims
will behave if Afghanistan invades India, is a very pertinent and
crucial question and must be faced, however unpleasant it may be.

 Some may say—why assume that the large proportion of Muslims in the
Army is a settled fact and that it cannot be unsettled? Those who can
unsettle it are welcome to make what efforts they can. But, so far as
one can see, it is not going to be unsettled. On the contrary, I should
not be surprised if it was entered in the constitution, when revised, as
a safeguard for the Muslim Minority. The Musalmans are sure to make this
demand and as against the Hindus, the Muslims somehow always succeed. We
must, therefore, proceed on the assumption that the composition of the
Indian Army will remain what it is at present. The basis remaining the
same, the question to be pursued remains what it was: Can the Hindus
depend upon such an Army to defend the country against the invasion of
Afghanistan? Only the so-called Indian Nationalists will say 'yes' to
it. The boldest among the realists must stop to think before he can give
an answer to the question. The realist must take note of the fact that
the Musalmans look upon the Hindus as Kaffirs, who deserve more to be
exterminated than protected. The realist must take note of the fact that
while the Musalman accepts the European as his superior, he looks upon
the Hindu as his inferior. It is doubtful how far a regiment of
Musalmans will accept the authority of their Hindu officers if they be
placed under them. The realist must take note that of all the Musalmans,
the Musalman of the North-West is the most disaffected Musalman in his
relation with the Hindus. The realist must take note that the Punjabi
Musalman is fully susceptible to the propaganda in favour of
Pan-lslamism. Taking note of all these considerations, there can be very
little doubt that he would be a bold Hindu who would say that in any
invasion by Muslim countries, the Muslims in the Indian Army would be
loyal and that there is no danger of their going over to the invader.
Even Theodore Morrison,**[/12/](#n12)** writing in 1899, was of the
opinion that—

> "The views held by theMahomedans (certainly the most aggressive and
> truculent of the peoples of India) are alone sufficient to prevent the
> establishment of an independent Indian Government Were the Afghan to
> descend from the north upon an autonomous India, the Mahomedans,
> instead of uniting with the Sikhs and the Hindus to repel him, would
> be drawn by all the ties of kinship and religion to join his flag."

 And when it is recalled that in 1919 the Indian Musalmans who were
carrying on the Khilafat movement actually went to the length of
inviting the Amir of Afghanistan to invade India, the view expressed by
Sir Theodore Morrison acquires added strength and ceases to be a matter
of mere speculation.

 How this Army composed of the Muslims of the Punjab and N. W.F. P.
will behave in the case of an invasion by Afghanistan is not the only
question which the Hindus are called upon to consider. There is another
and equally important question on which the Hindus must ponder. That
question is: Will the Indian Government be free to use this Army,
whatever its loyalties, against the invading Afghans? In this
connection, attention must be drawn to the stand taken by the Muslim
League. It is to the effect that the Indian Army shall not be used
against Muslim powers. There is nothing new in this. This principle was
enunciated by the Khilafat Committee long before the League. Apart from
this, the question remains how far the Indian Muslims will, in future,
make it their article of faith. That the League has not succeeded in
this behalf against the British Government does not mean that it will
not succeed against an Indian Government. The chances are that it will,
because, however unpatriotic the principle may be from the standpoint of
the Hindus, it is most agreeable to the Muslim sentiment and the League
may find a sanction for it in the general support of the Muslim
community in India. If the Muslim League succeeds in enforcing this
limitation upon Indians right to use her fighting forces, what is going
to be the position of the Hindus? This is another question which the
Hindus have to consider.

 If India remains politically one whole and the two-nation mentality
created by Pakistan continues to be fostered, the Hindus will find
themselves between the devil and the deep sea, so far as the defence of
India is concerned. Having an Army, they will not be free to use it
because the League objects. Using it, it will not be possible to depend
upon it because its loyalty is doubtful. This is a position which is as
pathetic as it is precarious. If the Army continues to be dominated by
the Muslims of the Punjab and the N.W.F. P., the Hindus will have to pay
it but will not be able to use it and even if they were free to use it
against a Muslim invader, they will find it hazardous to depend upon it.
If the Hague view prevails and India does not remain free to use her
Army against Muslim countries, then, even if the Muslims lose their
predominance in the Army, India on account of these military
limitations, will have to remain on terms of subordinate co-operation
with the Muslim countries on her border, as do the Indian States under
British paramountcy.

 The Hindus have a difficult choice to make: to have a safe Army or a
safe border. In this difficulty, what is the wisest course for the
Hindus to pursue? Is it in their interest to insist that the Muslim
India should remain part of India so that they may have a safe border,
or is it in their interest to welcome its separation from India so that
they may have a sale Army? The Musalmans of this area are hostile to the
Hindus. As to this, there can be no doubt. Which is then better for the
Hindus: Should these Musalmans be without and against or should they be
within and against? If the question is asked to any prudent man, there
will be only one answer, namely, that if theMusalmans are to be against
the Hindus, it is better that they should be without and against, rather
than within and against. Indeed, it is a consummation devoutly to be
wished that the Muslims should be without. That is the only way of
getting rid of the Muslim preponderance in the Indian Army.

 How can it be brought about? Here again, there is only one way. to
bring it about, and that is to support the scheme of Pakistan. Once
Pakistan is created, Hindustan, having ample resources in men and money,
can have an Army which it can call its own and there will be nobody to
dictate as to how it should be used and against whom it should be used.
The defence of Hindustan, far from being weakened by the creation of
Pakistan, will be infinitely improved by it.

 The Hindus do not seem to realize at what disadvantage they are
placed from the point of view of their defence, by their exclusion from
the Army. Much less do they know that, strange as it may appear, they
are in fact purchasing this disadvantage at a very heavy price.

 The Pakistan area which is the main recruiting ground of the present
Indian Army, contributes very little to the Central Exchequer, as will
be seen from the following figures :—

 As against this the provinces of Hindustan contribute as follows:—  


|                                                                                          |

 The Pakistan Provinces, it will be seen, contribute very little. The
main contribution comes from the Provinces of Hindustan. In fact, it is
the money contributed by the Provinces of Hindustan which enables the
Government of India to carry out its activities in the Pakistan
Provinces. The Pakistan Provinces are a drain on the Provinces of
Hindustan. Not only do they contribute very little to the Central
Government but they receive a great deal from the Central Government.
The revenue of the Central Government amounts to Rs.121 crores. Of this,
about Rs. 52 crores are annually spent on the Army. In what area is this
amount spent? Who pays the bulk of this amount of Rs. 52 crores? The
bulk of this amount of Rs. 52 crores which is spent on the Army is spent
over the Muslim Army drawn from the Pakistan area. Now the bulk of this
amount of Rs. 52 crores is contributed by the Hindu  
Provinces and is spent on an Army which for the most part consists of
non-Hindus!! How many Hindus are aware of this tragedy? How many know at
whose cost this tragedy is being enacted? Today the Hindus are not
responsible for it because they cannot prevent it. The question is
whether they will allow this tragedy to continue. If they mean to stop
it, the surest way of putting an end to it is to allow the scheme of
Pakistan to take effect. To oppose it, is to buy a sure weapon of their
own destruction. A safe Army is better than a safe border.

**[/2](#m02)**/ The Questionnaire circulated by the Committee included
the following question:-- "If an efficient and available reserve of the
Indian Army be considered necessary for the safety of the Empire, should
it not be recruited and manintained from those parts of the country
which give us best soldiers, rather than amongst the weakest and least
warlike races of India?"....

**[/3/](#m03)** In his **Forty-One Years** he wrote: "Each cold season,
I made long tours in order to acquaint myself with the needs and
capabilities of the men of the Madras Army. I tried hard to discover in
them those fighting qualities which had distinguished their forefathers
during the wars of the last and the beginning of the present century. .
.And I was forced to the conclusion that the ancient military spirit had
died in them, as it had died in the ordinary Hindustani of Bengal and
the Mahratta of Bombay, and that they could no longer with safely be
pitted against warlike races, or employed outside the limit of Southern
India."
