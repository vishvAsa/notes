**APPENDIX 4**

**QUESTIONNAIRE FOR THE MARXIST PROFESSORS**

We return to the Marxist professors with whom we started.

We have cited from eighty histories written by Muslims over a period of
more than one thousand years. We have also cited several Islamic
inscriptions which confirm what the historians say. The citations show
how Hindu temples continued to be destroyed over a vast area and for a
long time. We have added no “editorial comments” and given no “communal
twist” to the events that took place. All along, we have kept to the
actual language used by the Muslim historians.

We wonder if the professors will dismiss as “a mere listing of dates”
the evidence we have presented. What we expect from the professors is
that they will come forward with “historical analysis and
interpretations” so that the destruction of Hindu temples mentioned in
the Muslim narratives gets explained in terms of economic or political
or any other non-religious motives.

We stick to our position, namely, that it is the theology of Islam which
offers the only straight-forward and satisfactory explanation of why
Muslim conquerors and rulers did what they did to Hindu places of
worship. We have provided full facts about that theology, as also about
the history of how it took its final shape. It would be most welcome if
the professors come out with their comments on the character and meaning
of this theology. In fact, we look forward to a Marxist explanation of
it. What were the concrete material conditions and objective historical
forces which gave rise to this theology in Arabia at that time?

Next, we refer to the second point which the professors had made in
their letter to *The Times of India*. They had said that “acts of
intolerance have been committed by followers of all religions”. A
subsequent sentence clarified what they meant; they had in mind the
“Buddhist and Jain monuments” and “animist shrines destroyed by Hindus”.
As we have said, we do not share their philosophy of separating the
Buddhists, the Jains and the Animists from the Hindus. But we agree to
use their terms for the time being and request them to produce

> 1\. A list of epigraphs which record the destruction of Buddhist and
> Jain monuments and Animist shrines by any Hindu, at any time;
>
> 2\. Citations from Hindu literary sources describing destruction of
> Buddhist and Jain monuments and Animist shrines by any Hindu, at any
> time;
>
> 3\. The Hindu theology which says or even suggests that non-Hindu
> places of worship should be destroyed or desecrated or plundered, or
> which hails such acts as pious or meritorious;
>
> 4\. A list of Hindu kings or commanders whom Hindus have hailed as
> heroes for desecrating or destroying or converting into Hindu places
> of worship any Buddhist or Jain monuments or Animist shrines;
>
> 5\. A list of Buddhist and Jain monuments and Animist shrines which
> have been desecrated or destroyed or converted into Hindu places of
> worship in the remote or the recent past;
>
> 6\. The names and places of Hindu monuments which stand on the sites
> occupied earlier by Buddhist or Jain monuments or Animist shrines, or
> which have materials from the latter embedded in their masonry;
>
> 7\. Names of Buddhist, Jain and Animist leaders or organizations who
> have claimed that such and such Hindu monuments are usurpations, and
> demanded their restoration to the original occupants;
>
> 8\. Names of Hindu leaders and organizations who have resisted any
> demand made by Buddhists or Jains or Animists for restoration of the
> latter’s places of worship, or called for legislation which will
> maintain the status quo, or cried “Hinduism in danger”, or staged
> street riots in support of their usurpations.

We think that this sort of concrete evidence alone cane decide “the
question of the limits to the logic of restoration of religious sites”.
There seems to be no other way. Sweeping generalizations based on
slender or dubious evidence are no substitute for hard facts.

We hope that the professors will not resort to the hackneyed swear-words
such as “Hindu communalism,” “reactionary revivalism”, and the rest.
Swear-words offer no solutions.  In any case, the time when swear-words
carried weight has passed. It is no use inviting the other side to hit
back in a similar manner.

If the professors fail to come out with answers to questions posed by
us, and to present the evidence in support of their statements, we shall
be forced to conclude that far from being serious academicians, they are
cynical politicians hawking ad hoc or plausible explanations in the
service of a party line. In fact, we shall be justified in saying that
they are not Marxists but Stalinists. Marxism is a serious system of
thought which offers consistent explanations. Stalinism, on the other
hand, is an exercise in *suppressio veri suggestio falsi* in pursuit of
a particular end.

Hindu scholars, leaders and organizations have so far ignored the loud
and large-scale talk in the mass media, academia, and political circles
about “Hindu intolerance” towards the Buddhists and the Jains and the
Animists. Much damage has already been done to the image of Hinduism,
and much more damage is likely to result if this talk is not challenged
and stopped. How loose and irresponsible this talk can be is illustrated
by the following instance.

I attended a seminar on the Mandal Commission Report held in the Gandhi
Peace Foundation in October, 1990. One of the participants who spoke in
support of the Report was Shri Hukam Dev Narain Singh Yadav, an MP of
the Janata Dal at that time and a Minister in the Chandra Shekhar
Government some time later. Speaking of Brahminical tyranny, he referred
to the time “when rivers of the blood of Buddhist monks were made to
flow in the Buddhist monasteries *(jab bauddha vihãroñ mêñ bauddha
bhikSuoñ kê rakta kî nadiyãñ bahãî gayî thîñ)*.” The following dialogue
took place between myself and the speaker at the end of the latter’s
talk:

> I: Could you kindly name the Buddhist monasteries where it happened,
> and also the time when it happened?
>
> Speaker: I will not pretend that I know. I must have heard it from
> someone, or read it somewhere.
>
> I: I give you six months for finding a single instance of Hindus
> murdering Buddhist monks. I am demanding only one instance, not two.
>
> Speaker: I will try.

The speaker looked to me to be one of the finest men I had ever met. His
voice had a ring of sincerity in whatever he said. His humility in
presenting his point of view was more than exemplary. I expected him to
remember my question and provide an answer. But two and a half years
have passed and there is no word from the eminent politician occupying a
high position in the public life of this country.

I know that the evidence demanded by me does not exist. It is a Big Lie
being spread by Hindu-baiters. Hindus have never done what they are
being accused of. My only point in mentioning the incident is that even
honest people can become victims of hostile propaganda which is not
countered in good time.  
 

**II**

When the first edition of this book came out, I sent a copy of it to
Professor Romila Thapar of the Jawaharlal Nehru University in her
capacity as the doyen of the Marxist historians. I also addressed to her
the following letter on 27 June, 1991:

“I have posed a questionnaire for the school of historians which you
lead. Please turn to pp. 438-441 of my recently published book (Hindu
Temples: What Happened to Them, Volume II: The Islamic Evidence), a copy
of which is being sent to you by registered post.

“You may also read pp. 70-103 and p.i which also discuss the position of
your school.

“I am drawing your attention to these pages so that your school does not
plead ignorance of them while maintaining silence. Of course, you are
free to ignore the questionnaire as coming from a person who has had no
standing in the academic world. I, however, feel that there are many
people still left in this country who care for truth more than for
position.”

She was kind enough to reply by a letter dated 10 August 1991 which
said:

“Your letter of 27 June was awaiting me on my recent return to Delhi.

“As regards the issues raised in the questionnaire included in your
book, you are perhaps unaware of the scholarly work on the subject
discussed by a variety of historians of various schools of thought. May
I suggest that for a start, you might read my published lectures
entitled, ‘Cultural Transaction and Early India’.”

I wrote back on 31 August 1991, and stated my position as follows:

“I acknowledge your letter of August 10.

“I wish you had refrained from striking the pose of superiority which
has been for long the hallmark of your school of historians. It does not
go well with academic discipline.

“For your information I have been primarily a student of ancient India’s
history and culture, and gone through a good deal of source material,
literary as well as archaeological. One of the reasons I have wandered
into India’s medieval and modern history is that I want to know what
happened to Hindu heritage at the hands of latter-day ‘liberators’.

“May I request you not to suggest any further reading of your stuff? You
threaten to do so when you use the words ‘for a start’ while
recommending your present pamphlet. I am pretty familiar with the patent
lore.

“I am sorry to say that your pamphlet has added nothing to my knowledge
or perspective. The method of selecting facts and floating fictions is
very well known to me. Christian missionaries have done far better with
lesser fare.

“I am not commenting on the various propositions put forward in your
pamphlet. The Questionnaire which I have addressed to you was framed in
a particular context. In your letter published in *The Times of India*
dated October 2, 1986, you had stated that handing over of Sri Rama’s
and Sri Krishna’s birthplaces to the Hindus, and of disused mosques to
the Muslims ‘raises the question of the limits to the logic of
restoration of religious sites. How far back do we go? Can we push this
to the restoration of Buddhist and Jain monuments destroyed by Hindus?
Or of the pre-Hindu animist shrines?’ In my book I have welcomed the
statement and said that ‘the question can be answered satisfactorily
only when we are prepared to face facts and a sense of proportion is
restored’.

“I have gone ahead and compiled historical and theological data about
Islamic iconoclasm from whatever Islamic sources I could lay my hands on
during the last four years. More may follow as I get at more of this
source material. In an earlier volume I have provided, in a preliminary
survey, a list of around two thousands Muslim monuments which are known
to stand on the sites of and/or have been built with the materials of
Buddhist, Brahmanical and Jain temples. The list is likely to get
enlarged as I continue to look into more archaeological reports.

“I have also compiled a list of Buddhist and Jain monuments supposed to
have been destroyed or usurped by this or that Brahmanical sect, and
Jain temples functioning at what were Brahmanical places of worship at
earlier dates. I am seeking your help to enlarge the list of Buddhist
and Jain monuments which were destroyed by those whom you call Hindus.
Your writings and statements over the years go to show that you
specialize in this subject. What I am looking for in particular is the
Hindu theology which inspires acts of intolerance. I expect you to guide
me to it.

“My Questionnaire is not at all a challenge issued in a spirit of
combat. It is only an appeal that sweeping statements should now yield
place to hard facts so that we know precisely as to who did what, when,
where, and under what inspiration. We should be in a position to compare
the record of Islamic iconoclasm with that of Hindu iconoclasm, and draw
fair conclusions regarding the character and role of the two religions.
I for one am not interested in the restoration of religious sites, which
I leave to the politicians.

“It is nobody’s case that Hindu sects (in which I include Buddhists and
Jains) did not use strong language vis-a-vis each other. Every
Brahmanical sect has used strong language about other Brahmanical sects.
So have the Buddhist, and the Jains, not only vis-a-vis Brahmanical
sects but also about one another. The situation gets much worse when it
comes to the sub-sects, whether Buddhist or Brahmanical or Jain. But
strong language alone, whether in words or portrayals, is no evidence in
the present context, unless it is followed by overt acts of destruction
or usurpation.

“Secondly, I fail to understand the logic of placing Buddhists and Jains
on one side of the fence, and Brahmanical sects on the other. What about
Buddhists and Jains committing acts of intolerance vis-a-vis one
another? For a start, I refer you to the *Mahavamsa* which says that the
Buddhist king, Vattagamini (29-117 BC), destroyed a Jain *vihara* and
built a Buddhist one on the same site. In the Sravana-Belgola Epitaph of
Mallishena, the renowned Jain teacher, Akalanka, says that ‘in the court
of the glorious king Himasitala, I overcame all crowds of Bauddhas, most
of whom had a shrewd mind (*vidagdha-at-mano*), and I broke the (image
of) Sugata with my foot (*padena visphotitah*) ” (EI. III, 192 for
Sanskrit text and 201 for English translation). The instances can be
multiplied.

“Thirdly, I plead that presentation of evidence should not be an
exercise in *suppressio veri suggestio falsi*. Your one line summary
(p.18) of die Saiva inscription at Ablur is a case in pint. The
inscription says clearly (*El*.III, 255) that the dispute arose because
the Jains in a body tried to prevent a Saiva from worshipping his own
image, saying ‘Jina is the (true) deity’. The Jains also undertook to
‘pluck up our Jina and set up Siva’ if the Saiva devotee performed a
miracle. And the Jains went back on their plighted word when the miracle
was shown. There was a quarrel and the Jina was broken by the Saivas.
What is most significant, the Jain king, Bijjala, decided in favour of
the Saivas when the dispute was referred to him. He dismissed the Jains,
‘bidding them to go without saying further words’. The story ends with
the Jain king showering favours on the Saivas.

“Dr. Fleet who has edited and translated this inscription along with
four others found at the same place, gives summaries of two Lingayat
puranas and the Jain *Bijjalacharitra*, and points out that the story in
this inscription finds no support in the literary traditions of the two
sects. Bijjal’s inscription dated AD 1162 discovered at Managoli (*EI*.
V, 9-23) also does not support the story. The fact that the Saiva
inscription at Ablur bears neither a date nor relates itself definitely
to the reign of a king, makes it sound fishy. Authentic inscriptions do
not usually deal in miracles. Obviously, the Saivas seem to have used
the endowment of a Saiva temple in the Managoli inscription for mounting
on it a story which was not related to any real events but satisfied
sectarian spite.

“Dr. Fleet has cited from the Lingayat sources to show that there was
nothing Brahmanical about the Lingayats. They harboured ‘hostility to
Brahmans’ (p.239) and their doctrines ‘included the persecution and
extermination of all persons whose creed differed from that of the
Lingayats’ (p.240). Brahmanism in any shape or form should not be held
responsible for the doings of this sect. There is evidence that this
sect drew its inspiration directly from Muslim missionaries who abounded
on the West Coast of India at the time it took shape.

“Incidentally, I have not been able to find anything relevant to the
context in *EI*. XXVIII.1 which is mentioned in footnote 14 on page 18
of your pamphlet, along with *EI*.V.237. Is it a printing mistake? 
Kindly give me the correct reference so that I may examine the incident
and credit it to your account if it is not already in my list. I hope it
is not a case of strong language alone.

“Finally, I suggest that all cases of Brahmanical rulers building or
endowing Buddhist and Jain temples, and Buddhist and Jain rulers doing
the same for Brahmanical temples, should also be compiled for obtaining
a total picture of the religious scene. You are very prompt in pointing
out the few cases where Hindu temples were endowed or built under Muslim
patronage, whenever the large-scale destruction of Hindu temples by
Muslims is brought to your notice. Why do you always fail to point out
the numerous cases of Brahmanical patronage of Buddhism and Jainism,
while listing the few cases of Brahmanical persecution? If a few cases
of Muslim patronage can atone for large-scale Islamic iconoclasm, the
numerous cases of Brahmanical patronage should be able to do the same
for a few cases of Brahmanical persecution. I hope I am not illogical.”

I have not received even an acknowledgement of this letter from
Professor Thapar, leave alone any comments on the points raised by me.
Her silence has left me sad, for I was looking forward to a fruitful
dialogue.  
 

**III**

Lest Professor Thapar complains that in my letter to her I have not
dealt with all instances of “Hindu intolerance” mentioned in her
pamphlet, I reproduce below the entire evidence she has presented. She  
says:

“The persecution of Buddhists in Kashmir is referred to by Hsüan Tsang,
but, lest it be thought that he being a Chinese Buddhist monk was
prejudiced, the testimony of KalhaNa in the *Rãjatarañginî* should be
more acceptable. Hsüan Tsang refers to the atrocities of Mihîrakula
against the Buddhists both in Punjab and in Kashmir in the sixth century
AD. Hsüan Tsang may well have been exaggerating when he lists the
destruction of 1,600 Buddhist *stûpas* and *sanghãramas* and the killing
of many thousands of Buddhist monks and lay-followers. KalhaNa gives an
even fuller account of the king killing innocent people by the hundreds.
This is often dismissed by attributing the anti-Buddhist actions of
Mihîrakula to his being a HûNa. But it should not be forgotten that he
was also an ardent Šaiva and gave grants of land in the form of
*agrahãras* to the brahmans. In the words of KalhaNa: ‘Brahmans from
Gandhãra resembling himself in their habits and verily themselves the
lowest of the twice-born accepted *agrahãras* from him.’ It is possible
that the recently discovered *stûpa* at Sanghol in Punjab, where
sculpted railings were found in the vicinity of a *stûpa* dismantled and
packed away, indicates this persecution of Buddhists in Kashmir and the
wilful destruction of a *vihãra*, again by a Šaivite king. But on this
occasion the king repented and built a new monastery for the Buddhist
monks.

“Courtly literature, particularly plays written after the seventh
century AD, is replete with invective against Buddhist and Jaina monks
who are depicted as morally depraved, dishonest and altogether what one
might call the scum of the earth. Mahendravarman’s *MaTTavilãsa*, a
farce, is amongst the earliest plays. In the *MudrarãkSasa* of
Višãkhadatta, a constant refrain states that it is inauspicious to see a
Jaina monk. The *Prabodha-candrodaya* of KRSNa Mišra, a drama of the
eleventh century, dwells on the theme of a Kapãlika converting a Jaina
and a Buddhist monk to Šaivism by offering them wine and women, both of
which they are said to hanker after. In the Šaiva temples at Khajuraho,
Jaina monks, especially of the *digambara* sect, are depicted in the
worst possible erotic poses. Such references and depictions do not
amount to persecution but reflect a contemptuous attitude towards Jaina
and Buddhist monks which they would doubtless have found very galling,
particularly as they occur in the literature and art of aristocratic
groups. The depiction of monks and ascetics as debauched may have been
due to the court’s contempt for a variety of ascetics, some of whom were
associated with socially unacceptable practices. Such depictions in
courtly literature may also have been an attempt to play down the
authority associated with renouncers and ascetics in the popular mind.
But it is significant that the Buddhists and Jainas are more commonly
made the subject of attack.

‘Evidence on the persecution of Jainas by Šaiva sects comes from a
variety of sources. The earliest known cave temple originally dedicated
by the Jainas in Tirunelveli district was, subsequently in the seventh
century, converted into a Šaiva temple. This was not a case of
appropriating the temple and gradually changing it. Quite clearly, the
Jaina images were either destroyed or erased, sometimes only partially,
and fresh Šaivite images carved in the same place. In the case of the
partially erased sculpture it is possible to recognize traces of the
original. Where the image is totally gouged out the desecration is
visible.

“The Šaivite saint Jñãna Sambander is attributed with having converted
the PãNDya ruler from Jainism to Šavism, whereupon it is said that eight
thousand Jainas were impaled by the king. This episode is represented in
painting and sculpture in medieval temples and is enacted to this day in
some Šiva temples during their annual festival. In later times, attempts
were made to appease the Jainas by royal patrons building Jaina, Šaiva
and VaiSNava temples in close proximity. But in these areas the Jaina
temples soon fell into disrepair whilst the others flourished.

“Such activities were not restricted to a particular area. The Jaina
temples of Karnataka went through a traumatic experience at the hands of
the Lingãyatas or Vîrašaivas in the early second millennium AD. This
would explain in part why some Jaina texts have pejorative references to
Basava, who founded the Vîrašaiva sect. The Jaina temples at LakkuNDi
were located in the proximity of an affluent *agrahãra* and the VaiSNava
brahmans accepted Mahãvîra as an incarnation of Brahma. Later, however,
one of the temples was converted into a Šaiva temple. At Huli, the
temple of the five Jinas was converted into a *pañcaliñgešvara* Šaivite
temple, the five *liñgas* replacing the five Jina images in the
*sancta*. Some other Jaina temples suffered the same fate. An
inscription at Ablur in Dharwar eulogizes attacks on Jaina temples as
retaliation for Jaina opposition to Šaivite worship. Sculpted panels at
this site depict the smashing of Jaina images. In the fourteenth century
the harassment of Jainas was so acute that they had to appeal for
protection to the ruling power at Vijayanagara.

“Inscriptions of the sixteenth century from the Srisailam area of Andhra
Pradesh record the pride taken by Vîrašaiva chiefs in beheading
*svetãmbara* Jainas. The local records of this area refer to the
frequent persecution of the Jainas. In Gujarat, Jainism flourished
during the reign of Kumãrapãla, but his successor persecuted the Jainas
and destroyed their temples. However, Jainism was so well-established
here that periodical persecution did not really shake it”^([1](#1))

She sums up: “It is historically important to know why this persecution
of the Buddhists and Jainas occurred in particular by the Šaivas. I can
only offer a few comments. At the religious level, it may have had to do
with asceticism. Was Šiva seen as the ascetic *par excellence* and the
patron deity of ascetics, and were Buddhist and Jaina monks seen as
imposters? Did Buddhist and Jaina monks find the worship of the *lingam*
offensive owing to the puritanism inherent in both these systems? Yet
the Tantric versions of these systems conceded to practices and ideas
which were opposed to puritanism. If the hostility related only to
religious differences, then it should have surfaced earlier in time. It
is interesting that it begins about the middle of the first millennium
AD and gains force through the centuries until Buddhism eventually fled
the country and Jainism was effectively limited to a few pockets. The
persecution predates the coming of Islam to these areas, so that the
convenient excuse that Islamic persecution caused the decline of these
religions is not applicable.”^([2](#2))

Interestingly, she has refrained from mentioning the persecution of
Buddhists by Pušyamitra Šunga and Šašãñka of GauDa, and the melting of
idols by king Harsha of Kashmir, which had so far figured most
prominently in the writings of her school. I wonder whether she has
realized that those allegations have no legs to stand upon, even though
others of her school continue to harp on them. In any case, it may be
assumed that her present list has exhausted the entire stock-in-trade in
the Marxist shop on the subject of “Hindu intolerance”. I will deal with
these instances, one by one.

It is nobody’s case that there was never any conflict among the sects
and sub-sects of Sanãtana Dharma. Some instances of persecution were
indeed there. Our plea is that they should be seen in a proper
perspective, and not exaggerated in order to whitewash or
counter-balance the record of Islamic intolerance. Firstly, the
instances are few and far between when compared to those listed in
Islamic annals. Secondly, those instances are spread over several
millennia while the fourteen centuries of Islam stand crowded with
religious crimes of all sorts. Thirdly, none of those instances were
inspired by a theology, while in the case of Islam a theology of
intolerance has continued to question the character of Muslim kings who
happened to be tolerant. Fourthly, Jains were not always the victims of
persecution; they were persecutors as well once in a while. Lastly, no
king or commander or saint who showed intolerance has been a Hindu hero,
while Islam has hailed as heroes only those characters who excelled in
intolerance.

It is not an accident that Professor Thapar’s pamphlet consists of I. H.
Qureishi Memorial Lecture, 1987, delivered in the St. Stephen’s College,
Delhi. Ishdaq Husain Qureishi was a professor of medieval Indian history
in this college when I was a student in another college of the same
university. He was a well-known intellectual of the Muslim League and
famous for floating the proposition that Hindus were far better off
under Muslim rule than they were under that of their own princes in
pre-Islamic India. He migrated to Pakistan after Partition, and was that
country’s Minister of Education for a term. He functioned, to the end of
his life, as an apologist of Islamic imperialism as is evident from the
numerous works of “research” he wrote or guided. One can hardly expect
proper knowledge or perspective from “professors” who are patronized by
such platforms.
