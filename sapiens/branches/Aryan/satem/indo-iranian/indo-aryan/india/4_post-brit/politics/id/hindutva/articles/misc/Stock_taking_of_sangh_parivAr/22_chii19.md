**General**

It is a tragedy that the 3 different wings, namely, the BJP which is a
political institution for establishment of Bharatiya (Hindu) Rashtra,
the RSS which is an organisational wing of BJP, and the VHP which is a
religious platform for Hindus, are not able to work in unison for a
common cause - establishment of Bharatiya (Hindu) Rashtra, which is the
need of the hour to prevent threats of Muslim rule, either direct on by
proxy in the name of secular, democratic Bharat.

The three wings must look upon each other as supplementing the others,
instead of each considering itself autonomous and independent. VHP’s
decision to pursue the Mandir issue and the Hindutva ideology and BJP’s
decision to abandon both are distancing Hindus away from BJP.

BJP’s progress has suffered a setback by the greatest blunder - whoever
be responsible for it - by demolition of what had come to be known as
Babri Masjid. Not only did Hindus lose lives at the hands of Maulana
Mulayam Singh, the Maulana is looked upon as the only well-wisher and
saviour of Muslims. BJP has been isolated as one common enemy of all the
political parties, be it Congress. Janata Dal, Samajwadi Party or the
Communists.

The effort should be to unite rather than create rift, either
ideological or otherwise. Political gain should be the sole aim
irrespective of ideological differences.  
 

**Specific**

*No exercise on the Part of BJP to win over Muslims or Christians will
ever succeed.* The BJP, however, has the difficult job of defending
Hindus against secularists’ anti-Hindu policies without offending
Muslims. BJP has to take up Hindus’ cause for loss of lives of pilgrims
in Amar Nath Yatra and of Muslim lives in the collision between Saudi
and Kazakistan aeroplanes. I was pleased to see ‘Rashtriya Swayam Sevak
Sangh’ banner at Charkhi Dadri in Star Plus Hindi news on 14.11.96 at 7
p.m. Now that Faruq Abdullah is espousing the cause of Kashmiri
Brahmins, rehabilitating them in Kashmir, BJP should either press the
point to lend support to Mr. Faruq or to expose his lip sympathy. Let
VHP make out a case for a grant of Government aid for Hindu and Sikh
(even Christian) pilgrims on lines similar to that for Muslim pilgrims
to Mecca.

On the *First Document* I agree entirely with Dr. Godbole.

> 1\. The question is absolutely irrelevant and the thought is futile.

>
> 2\. Islam or Christianity is not oriented towards search of God. It is
> aimed at increasing the numbers and rule the democratic world by

> 3\. Muslim and Islam are inseparable.  Each is as good or bad as the

> 4\. Muslims are too fanatic to be educated. Even a Muslim graduate

> 5\. Muslims indeed are a vote bank for they are united as one

> 6\. A Muslim is a Muslim first and Muslim last, call him a Sufi, Shia

> 7\. I agree that Muslim theology is responsible for the ghetto

>
> 8\. True, Quran teaches, rather encourages, Muslims to break idols,
> destroy temples and kill the Kafirs.

*On the Second Document*, I have merely to say that for a Mazdoor Sangh
it is not a bad idea to put up the face of ‘Sarva Panth Samãdar Manch’
or ‘Sarva Dharma Samabhãv’. Let not Dr. Godbole make an issue of it. It
may be politically beneficent for a Mazdoor Sangh to grow.
