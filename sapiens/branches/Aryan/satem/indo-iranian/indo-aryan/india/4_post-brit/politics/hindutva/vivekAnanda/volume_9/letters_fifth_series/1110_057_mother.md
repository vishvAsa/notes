 Thence
I go to the Thousand Islands. Also I have an invitation to speak at a
parliament of religions at Toronto, Canada, on July 18th. I will go
there from Thousand Islands and return back.

So far everything is going on well with me.

Ever your grateful son,  
VIVEKANANDA

P.S. My regards and love to your daughter and pray for her speedy
recovery.

V.
