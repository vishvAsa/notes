C/O MRS. E. TOTTEN.  
1708, 1ST STREET, WASHINGTON, D.C.  
*27th Oct., 1894.*

DEAR MRS. BULL,

Many thanks for your kindness in sending me the introduction to Mr.
Frederic Douglas. You need not be sorry on account of the ill-treatment
I received at the hands of a low class hotel-keeper at Baltimore. It was
the fault of the Vrooman brothers. Why should they take me to a low
hotel?

And then the American women, as everywhere, came to my rescue, and I had
a very good time.

In Washington I am the guest of Mrs. E. Totten who is an influential
lady here and a metaphysician. She is moreover the niece of one of my
Chicago friends. So everything is going on all right. I also saw Mrs.
Colville and Miss Young here.

With my eternal love and gratitude for you,

I remain, Yours etc.,  
VIVEKANANDA.
