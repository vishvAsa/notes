>
>  1. When the Blessed One had been on a visit to his father's home,
> the desire to join the Sangh was as keen among the Sakya women as it
> was among the Sakya men.  
>  2. The leader of such women was no other than Mahaprajapati
> Gautami.  
>  3. Now at the time when the Blessed One was staying among the
> Sakyas in the Nigrodharama, Mahaprajapati Gautami went to him and
> said, "It would be well, Lord, if women were allowed to become
> Parivrajakas and enter the Sangh under the doctrine and discipline
> proclaimed by the Tathagata!"  
>  4. "Enough, O Gautami! Let not such a thought come into your
> mind." And a second and a third time did Mahaprajapati make the same
> request in the same words, and a second and a third time did she
> receive the same reply.  
>  5. Then Mahaprajapati Gautami, sad and sorrowful, bowed down
> before the Blessed One, and went away weeping and in tears.  
>  6. After the Blessed One had left Nigrodharama for his wanderings,
> Mahaprajapati and the Sakya women sat together to give further
> consideration to their request for admission to the Sangh, and the
> refusal of the Lord to grant such a request.  
>  7. The Sakya women refused to take the Lord's refusal as final.
> They decided to go further: to assume the garb of a Parivrajaka and
> present the Lord with a *fait accompli*.  
>  8. Accordingly Mahaprajapati Gautami cut off her hair and put on
> orange-coloured robes, and set out with a number of women of the Sakya
> clan on her journey to meet the Lord, who was at that time staying in
> Vesali in the Mahavana in the Kutagara Hall.  
>  9. In due course Mahaprajapati Gautami with her companions arrived
> at Vesali, and with swollen feet and covered with dust, came to the
> Kutogara Hall.  
>  10. Again she made the same request to the Blessed Lord which she
> had made when he was staying at Nigrodharama, and he refused it
> again.  
>  11. On receiving his refusal a second time, Mahaprajapati
> withdrew, and was standing outside the entrance of the hall not
> knowing what to do. While she was so standing, Ananda, on his way to
> the hall saw her and recognised her.  
>  12. He then asked Mahaprajapati, "Why standest thou there, outside
> the porch, with swollen feet, covered with dust, and sorrowful,
> weeping and in tears?" "Inasmuch, O Ananda, as the Lord, the Blessed
> One, does not permit women to renounce their homes and enter the
> homeless state under the doctrine and discipline proclaimed by the
> Tathagata," said Mahaprajapati.  
>  13. Then did the Venerable Ananda go up to the place where the
> Blessed One was, and bowed down before the Blessed One, and take
> \[=took\] his seat on one side. And, so sitting, the Venerable Ananda
> said to the Blessed One, "Behold, Lord; Mahaprajapati Gautami is
> standing outside under the entrance porch, with swollen feet, covered
> with dust, sad and sorrowful, weeping and in tears, inasmuch as the
> Blessed One does not permit women to renounce their homes and enter
> the homeless state under the doctrine and discipline proclaimed by the
> Blessed One. It were well, Lord, if women were to have permission
> granted to them to do as she desires.  
>  14. "Has not Mahaprajapati proved herself of great service to the
> Blessed One, when as aunt and nurse she nourished him and gave him
> milk, and on the death of his mother suckled the Blessed One at her
> own breast; it were, therefore, well, Lord, that women should have
> permission to go forth from the household life and enter the homeless
> state, under the doctrine and discipline proclaimed by the
> Tathagata."  
>  15. "Enough, Ananda! Let it not \[be?\], please, that women should
> be allowed to do so." A second time and a third time did Ananda make
> the same request, in the same words, and received the same reply.  
>  16. Then the Venerable Ananda asked the Blessed One, "What can be
> the ground, Lord, for your refusal to allow women to take Parivraja?  
>  17. "The Lord knows that the Brahmins hold that the Shudras and
> women cannot reach moksha (Salvation) because they are unclean and
> inferior. They do therefore not allow Shudras and women to take
> Parivraja. Does the Blessed One hold the same view as the Brahmins?  
>  18. Has not the Blessed One allowed the Shudras to take Parivraja
> and join the Sangh in the same way he has done to the Brahmins? What
> is the ground, Lord, for treating women differently?  
>  19. Does the Blessed One hold that women are not capable of
> reaching Nibbana, under the doctrine and discipline proclaimed by the
> Blessed One?"  
>  20. The Blessed One replied, "Ananda! Do not misunderstand me. I
> hold that women are as much capable as men in the matter of reaching
> Nibbana. Ananda! do not misunderstand me, I am not an upholder of the
> doctrine of sex inequality. My rejection of Mahaprajapati's request is
> not based on sex inequality. It is based on practical grounds."  
>  21. "I am happy, Lord, to know the real reason. But must the Lord
> refuse her request because of practical difficulties? Would not such
> an act bring the Dhamma into discredit, and make it open to the charge
> of upholding sex inequality? Could not the Lord devise some rules to
> get over such practical difficulties by which the Lord is worried?"  
>  22. "Well, Ananda, I grant, if Mahaprajapati insists, that women
> must be allowed to take Parivraja under the doctrine and discipline
> proclaimed by me. But it shall be subject to eight conditions. Let
> Mahaprajapati Gautami take upon herself the responsibility of
> enforcing the Eight Chief Rules. That will be her initiation."  
>  23. Then the Venerable Ananda, when he learnt from the Blessed One
> these Eight Chief Rules, went to Mahaprajapati Gautami and told her
> all that the Blessed One had said.  
>  24. "Just, Ananda, as a man or a woman, when young and of tender
> years, accustomed to adorn himself, would, when he had bathed his
> head, receive with both hands a garland of lotus flowers, or of
> jasmine flowers, or of stimutaka flowers, and place it on the top of
> his head; even so do I, Ananda, take upon me these Eight Chief Rules,
> never to be transgressed during my lifelong \[=lifetime\]," said
> Mahaprajapati to Ananda.  
>  25. Then the Venerable Ananda returned to the Blessed One, and
> bowed down before him, and took his seat on one side. And so sitting,
> the Venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One, "Mahaprajapati Gautami,
> Lord, has taken upon herself the responsibility for the enforcement of
> the Eight Chief Rules; she may therefore be regarded as having
> received the Upasampada initiation (entry into the Sangha)."  
>  26. Now Mahaprajapati received ordination, and 500 Sakya ladies
> who had come with her were also ordained at the same time. Thus
> ordained, great Prajapati came before the Master, and saluting him,
> stood on one side, and the Blessed One taught her the Dhamma, the
> doctrine, and the discipline.  
>  27. The other five hundred Bhikkhunis were ininstructed by
> Nandaka, one of the disciples of the Blessed One.  
>  28. Among the Sakya women who became Bhikkhunis along with
> Mahaprajapati was Yeshodhara. After her initiation she came to be
> known as Bhadda Kaccana.

> § 2. Conversion of Prakrati, a Chandalika
>
>  1. Once the Blessed Lord was living in Shravasti, in the Jetavana
> Arama of Anathpindika.  
>  2. It so happened that Ananda, his disciple, had gone into the
> city to beg for alms. After eating his food, Ananda was going to the
> river for drinking water.  
>  3. He saw a girl on the river bank filling her pot. Ananda asked
> her to give him some water.  
>  4. The girl, whose name was Prakrati, refused, saying she was a
> Chandalika.  
>  5. Ananda said, "I am concerned with water, I am not concerned
> with your caste." The girl then gave him some water from her pot.  
>  6. Thereafter, Ananda left for Jetavana. The girl followed him and
> saw where he was staying, and found that his name was Ananda and that
> he was a follower of the Buddha.  
>  7. On returning home she told her mother, Matangi, what had
> happened; and falling on the ground, started weeping.  
>  8. The mother asked for the cause of her weeping. The girl told
> the whole story, and said, "If you wish to marry me \[=arrange my
> marriage\], I can only marry Ananda. I will not marry anybody else."  
>  9. The mother started on an inquiry. On \[her\] return she told
> the girl that such a marriage was impossible, for Ananda was under a
> vow of celibacy.  
>  10. On hearing this news, the girl was filled with extreme sorrow,
> and gave up food. She was not prepared to take things as though it was
> a decree of fate. So she said, "Mother, you know the art of sorcery,
> don't you? Why don't you employ it to achieve our purpose?" The mother
> said, "I will see what can be done."  
>  11. Matangi invited Ananda to her house for a meal. The girl
> became very happy. Matangi then told Ananda that her daughter was very
> anxious to marry him. Ananda replied, "I am vowed to be celibate, and
> therefore I cannot marry any woman."  
>  12. "If you do not marry my daughter, she will commit suicide, so
> attached she is to you," Matangi told Ananda. "But I cannot help
> \[this\]," replied Ananda.  
>  13. Matangi went inside, and told her daughter that Ananda refused
> to marry her.  
>  14. The girl cried, "Mother, where is your sorcery?" The mother
> said, "My sorcery cannot win against the Tathagata."  
>  15. The girl shouted and said, "Close the door, and do not allow
> him to go out. I shall see that he becomes my husband this very
> night."  
>  16. The mother did what the girl wanted her to do. As night fell
> the mother brought in\[to\] the room a bed. The girl, dressed in her
> best, stepped in. But Ananda remained unmoved.  
>  17. The mother at last used her sorcery. As a result, a fire broke
> out in the room. The mother then held Ananda by his clothes and said,
> "If you will not agree to marry my daughter, I will throw you in this
> fire." However, Ananda did not yield; and the mother and the daughter,
> feeling helpless, left him free.  
>  18. Ananda, on his return, told the Blessed Lord all that had
> happened.  
>  19. On the second day the girl came to Jetavana in search of
> Ananda. Ananda was going out for alms. Ananda saw her and wanted to
> avoid her. But the girl followed him wherever he went.  
>  20. When Ananda returned to Jetavana, he found the girl waiting at
> the door of his Vihar.  
>  21. Ananda told the Blessed One how the girl was pursuing him. The
> Blessed One sent for her.  
>  22. When the girl appeared before him, the Blessed One asked her
> why she was pursuing Ananda. The girl replied that she was intent on
> marrying him. "I have heard he is unmarried and I am also
> unmarried."  
>  23. The Bhagavan said, "Ananda is a Bhikku, and he has no hair on
> his head. If you can get yourself clean shaven I shall see what could
> be done."  
>  24. The girl replied, "I am prepared for it." The Bhagavan said,
> "You must get your mother's permission for undergoing tonsure."  
>  25. The girl returned to her mother and said, "Mother! I have
> achieved what you failed to achieve. The Bhagavan has promised to get
> me married to Ananda if I undergo tonsure."  
>  26. The mother grew angry and said, "You must not do that. You are
> my daughter, and you must keep hair. Why are you so eager to marry a
> Shramana, Ananda? I can get you married to a better man."  
>  27. She replied, "I will either die, or marry Ananda. There is no
> third alternative for me."  
>  28. The Mother said, "Why are you insulting me?" The girl said,
> "If you love me you must let me do as I wish."  
>  29. The mother withdrew her objection, and the girl underwent
> tonsure.  
>  30.. Then the girl presented herself before the Blessed Lord,
> saying, " I have tonsured my head as directed by you."  
>  31. The Blessed Lord then asked her, "What do you want? What part
> of his body you cherish?" The girl said, "I am in love with his nose,
> I am in love with his mouth, I am in love with his ears, I am in love
> with his voice, I am in love with his eyes, and I am in love with his
> gait."  
>  32. The Blessed Lord then said to the girl, "Do you know that the
> eyes are the home of tears, the nose is the home of dirt, the mouth is
> the home of spit, the ear is the home of dirt, and the body is the
> container of dung and urine?"  
>  33. "When men and women come together they procreate children. But
> where there is birth there is death also; where there is death there
> is sorrow also. My dear girl, what are you going to get by marrying
> Ananda? I do not know."  
>  34. The girl began to cogitate, and agreed that there was no
> purpose in her marriage with Ananda, on which she was so intent; and
> she told the Blessed Lord accordingly.  
>  35. After saluting the Blessed Lord, the girl said, "Owing to
> ignorance, I was going in pursuit of Ananda. My mind is now
> enlightened. I am like a sailor whose ship, after a mishap, has
> reached the other bank. I am like an unprotected aged person who has
> found protection. I am like the blind who has got new sight. The
> Blessed Lord by his wise words of advice has awakened me from my
> sleep."  
>  36. "Blessed art thou, Prakrati, for though you are a Chandalika
> you will be a model for noblemen and noblewomen. You are of low caste,
> but Brahmins will learn a lesson from you. Swerve not from the path of
> justice and righteousness and you will outshine the royal glory of
> queens on the throne."  
>  37. The marriage having failed, the only course for her was to
> join the Bhikkhuni Sangh.  
>  38. Having expressed her wish she was admitted into it, though she
> belonged to the lowest class.
