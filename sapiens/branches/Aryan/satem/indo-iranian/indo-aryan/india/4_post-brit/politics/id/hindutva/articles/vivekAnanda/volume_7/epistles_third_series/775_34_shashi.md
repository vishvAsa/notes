C/O E. T. STURDY, ESQ.  
HIGH VIEW, CAVERSHAM, READING,  
*May* (?) *1896*.

DEAR SHASHI (RAMAKRISHNANANDA),

. . . This City of London is a sea of human heads — ten or fifteen
Calcuttas put together. One is apt to be lost in the mazes unless he
arranges for somebody to meet him on arrival. . . . However, let Kali
start at once. If he be late in starting like Sharat, better let no one
come. It won't do to loiter and procrastinate like that. It is a task
that requires the height of Rajas (activity). . . . Our whole country is
steeped in Tamas, and nothing but that. We want Rajas first, and Sattva
will come afterwards — a thing far, far removed.

Yours affectionately,

VIVEKANANDA.
