Savarkar passed his Mati’iculation Examinatiou in Decem-
ber 1901, and left Nasik for Poona in January 1902. What
was the state of Poona ? Exactly a year before Poona had
lost Mahadeo Govind Ranade, India’s foremost torchbearer
of learning and light. Ranade was a great social reformer,
a towering scholar, an ardent patriot, a renowned thinker,
an eminent economist and an exemplary judge. He was the
foremost torchbearer of a new age, and wished to build a
social structure conforming to the demands of fresh ideas.
Though not strictly a Congressman his word was law in every
annual session of the Indian National Congress of his day.
His political ideal for India was, in his own words : “ A
federated India distributed according to nationahties and
subjected to a common bond of connection with the Imperial
Power of the Queen-Empress of India.” * Sri R. P. Paranjpe
had just returned from England with a dazzling success in his
academic career. Gokhale was about to leave the Fergusson
College and enter upon a political career. Tilak was becom-
ing a formidable leader. Shivrampant Paranjpe was a domi-
nating figure with his magic pen and marvellous oratory.

As to the political state of India, the Congress was the
spokesman. From its inception upto 1906 the Moderates
dominated the Congress. Its stalwarts, from Surendranath
Banerjee to Pherozeshah Mehta and Gokhale, believed with
Ranade in the inscrutable “ dispensation of Almighty God for
the unification of our peoples and the permanence of British
Rule in India.” *

Savarkar joined the Fergusson College, Poona, in January
1902. Poona was then the living heart, and the Fergusson
      College, the Harrow of Maharashtra, in traditions and in
      producing historic personalities. As soon as Savarkar was in

the College, he directed his attention to sowing the seeds of
revolutionary doctrines in the fountain-head of Maharashtra.
On the eve of his departure for Poona in a send-off at Nasik
he had expressed the hope that at Poona he would inspire the
pick of Maharashtrian youth with revolutionary thoughts and
spread the revolutionary tenets through them over all the
Districts of Maharashtra.

A youth of power and purpose, Savarkar could easily make
his mark in the college. His fellow-students could not but feel
the impact of his striking personality. His qualities of head
and heart were great. He had entered Poona with a .stock of
reading, a gift for waiting, and a genius for oratoi-y such as
few students of this century possess. He was much advanced
in classical, historical and political literature. Even the profes-
sors who turned up their noses at his extreme political vie\vs
could not help praising him. As a member of the college
residency it was convenient for him to gauge his fellow-
students and gain their confidence. Soon a Savarkar group
was formed. This band of purposeful youths captured almost
all departments of the college institutions from the Dining
Club to the Library. It was a patriots’ group, studious,
thoughtful, sober, aspiring and yet greatly obliging.

The group started a hand-written weekly named the Aryan
Weekly, in which Savarkar often VTote illuminating articles
on patriotism, literature, history and science with ease and
elegance. Some of the thought-provoking articles from this
weekly found their way even into local weeklies and news-
papers of Poona. One of those brilliant articles of Savarkar was
“ Saptapadi ” in which he had dealt with the seven stages of
evolution that have to be gone through by a subject nation.
He had studied all the dramas of Kalidas and Bhavabhuti and
in one essay he brilliantly compared and contrasted Kalida.s
with Bhavabhuti with remarkable originality. His professor
highly praised him for this illuminating essay. Of the English
poets, Scott, Shakespeare and Milton influenced him much.
Milton’s Paradise Lost almost fascinated him. He had learnt
by heart some of its cantos. Later on, he used blank verse
metre for a part of his epic poetry. His essay on the Ramayana
and the Iliad similarly evoked appreciative remarks for his
erudition from Prof. Patwardhan.



THE RISING LEADER 17

Savarkar often gave scholarly talks on the history of the
world, the revolutions in Italy, Netherlands, America and
gave his colleagues an idea of the stress and struggle those
countries had to undergo for winning back their lost freedom.
The young Demosthenes in Savarkar had captivated students
and professors. On important occasions and at the main func-
tions in the college all flocked to hear his stirring speeches.
One day he delivered a lecture on the history of Italy under
the chairmanship of Principal Raj wade. He was mightily
pleased with Savarkar s range of knowledge and his oratorical
gifts although he disliked Savarkar’s reference to modern
politics. In an article the late Sri Gopal Govind Mujumdar,
alias ‘Poet Sadhudas’, has very well described Savarkar’s
hold on the college environments. In 1903, at the opening of
the new session of the college a meeting was held in the
college hall. Prof. Bhanu w£is in the chair. After the
introductory speech of Prof. Bhate, Savarkar in his black
coat and black cap rose amidst a deafening applause. He
reminded his audience of the glorious past and his speech
bewailed the loss of freedom. A wave of emotion swept over
the audience. His speech infused courage into the craven-
hearted and fired them all with the spirit of patriotism moving
every one to tears. Then the chairman rose and with a grave
face threw a wet blanket over the excited feelings. He said :
“ Yoimg men, you need not take Savarkar seriously ! He is
a Devil ! ” In those days a fearless, patriotic and brilliant
youth of independent nature was described in this manner.
In his college days Tilak, too, was known as a Devil ^ and the
Blunt ! Poor Prof. Bhanu ! His bookish knowledge could
not distinguish a deliverer from a devil.

The Savarkar Group dressed alike, used swadeshi, took an
evening stroll together, and carried discussions in old temples
and in the hearts of hills about their problems and plans. At the
same time the group never failed to attend to the prescribed
course of studies. They took care of their moral, physical and
intellectual developments. Out of the armoury of this group
sprang a host of literary and political figures who served the
cause of Indian freedom. They believed in energy and
endurance and not in enjoyment. Their ideal of life was not

cricket Their goal was survival of the fittest ! Yet Savarkar
was not without his lighter moments and at times enjoyed
them fully. He played an important part in a Shakespearian
play staged by the Fergussonians.

In the public activities of Poona also Savarkar took a
prominent part. His relations with Shivrampant Paranjpe,
the most popular orator and brilliant editor of the Kal, were
of a very cordial nature. While a high school student he was
occasionally in correspondence with Paranjpe. Once student
Savarkar had expressed his desire for being given a job of a
sub-editor, or even that of a compositor in the office of the
Kal just to enable him to have university education. But the
proposal, it seems, was dropped partly for want of an
encouraging reply or owing to the promised help by Savar-
kar's father-in-law. Savarkar first saw Paranjpe in Poona in
1902. Paranjpe’s revolutionary ideas were neai'er to the aim
      of Savarkar. Although the mould of their fervid patriotism
      was the same, it stemmed from different souls. Savarkar’s
      thoughts were deep-rooted, unbending and powerful and had
      a broader base and a wider range than those of Paranjpe.

On important occasions young Savarkar saw Tilak whose
association with the revolutionaries was a legend. Tilak 's
superb insight had sensed the stuff of which Savarkar was
made. Savarkar, by this time, was an acknowledged leader
of youths.


n

A change in the political tone was coming on with the
growing tension. A new spirit of self-reliance began to gain
ground. Tilak was turning the eyes of India from the British
public to the Indian masses for her own salvation. Stimulated
by these feelings Lala Lajpat Rai appealed to Indians to
become arbiters of their own destiny. Inspired by the epoch-
making victory of Asiatic Japan over European Russia,
Surendranath Banerjee encouraged the people with these
words : “ The sun has risen in the East. Japan has saluted
the rising sun. That sun, in its meridian splendovtr, will pass
through our country.” ^ Gokhale characterised the partition

THE RISING LEADEB 19

of Bengal as a cruel wrong inflicted upon our Bengali
brethren. The love of country and the feeling of united India
was rising. Simultaneously, the Swadeshi movement was also
gaining ground.

The opposition to the partition of Bengal was coming to a
head by October 1905. The partition of Bengal awakened the
dormant forces of nationalism and the sleeping embers of
communalism. As it was a move to counter the politically
dominant Hindus by a creation of an Eastern Bengal, Hindus
opposed and Muslims supported it ! Strangely enough, the
fate of Bengal has indeed not been a covetable one throughout
the last two centuries. Bengal was the stronghold of the
Mogul Empire. Bengal was the keystone of the arch of the
British Empire. Bengal has been the grazing ground for con-
versions and communal riots. Bengal has recently been the
foxmdation of a Muslim Sovereign State !

By now Savarkar had developed into a prominent figure in
the political and social gatherings and meetings of Poona and
had won the heai’ts of the public of Poona. Acharya Kaka
Kalelkar ^ tells us that Savarkar’s stirring eloquence was a
great attraction to the public of Poona in those days. Savarkar
and his group were ardent promoters of Swadeshi and staimch
opponents of the pai'tition scheme. Tilak had made the par-
tition of Bengal an all-India issue. Savarkar resolved to unfurl
the banner of boycott of foreign goods ; for boycott and
Swadeshi were the obverse and the reverse of one and the
same coin ! Representing the student at one meeting he,
therefore, suggested that they should make a bonfire of
foreign clothes. Sri N. C. Kelkar was in the chair. Shivram-
pant Paranjpe who was also present at the meeting supported
Savarkar. Savarkar also saw Tilak who was out of Poona
on the day of the meeting. Tilak, too, agreed, but on one con-
dition. He insisted that at least the heap of clothes should be
a huge one. Savarkar readily took the task upon himself.
With his moving oratory he provoked the people to the deed
and with a cartful of clothes the procession started wending
its way along the Reay Market and proceeded to the open
fldid across the Lakdi Pool. Tilak joined it at the termination.
At the conclusion of the procession Tilak opined that the
1 Kaka Kalelkar, The Pratihha, dated 15-1-1936.



20 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

dothes should be burnt there and speeches should be made
somewhere else. But Savarkar reasoned, “Then why this
procession ? We could have sent clothes here and made
speeches at the Reay Market. In fact, glowing speeches should
be delivered before the burning heap ! That will have a deep
impression on the minds of the people,” he argued. Tilak
cared m^re for youthful vigour and so he agreed. The
meeting then commenced around the glowing heap. Tilak
thimdered ; Paranjpe opened the vials of his satire and his
speech became more scorching than the fire itself. As ordained
by Tilak the youths left tlie place after the fire was completely
extinguished. Later on when N. C. Kelkar remarked that
economically the bonfire was a waste, Savarkar gently
retorted that the spark it would light would be mentally and
morally more valuable and lasting.

Thus Poona had the first bonfire of foreign cloth in India I
Its flames whirled high up in the sky and the noise echoed
throughout the length and breadth of India. Hatred of British
domination was rising and Savarkar added fuel to the fire of
hatred. In his later life Kelkar often mentioned that the
speeches made in those days by Savarkar left an indelible
imprint on his memory for a good many years. Even the
police reporters were enamoured of his gift of the gab.
Describing Savarkar ’s speech at the Sarvajanik Sabha in
Poona one reporter says : “ It was so dexterous ! so tri-
umphant ! He is at the most twenty-two, but he is already an
accomplished orator of an enviable rank.”

The flames of the bonfire also scorched the heads of the
Fergusson College. These fearless views and deeds of
Savarkar were fiery enough to burn their relations with the
Bombay University. The leading part played by this fiery
youth in the bonfire affair turned their moderate heads, and
R. P. Paranjpe, the then Principal, fined Savarkar Rs. 10 and
expelled him from the college residency. Two crosses now
glorified Savarkar’s lion-like chest. He was the first Indian
leader to make a bonfire of foreign cloth in India and the first
Indian student who was rusticated from a Government-aided
institution. The reaction was wide and virulent. Tilak de-
nounced this action on the part of the college authorities and
declared ; “ They are not our Gurus.” Almost all patriotic



THE RISING LEADER 21

papers condemned this unwise step taken by the college
authorities. A wave of indignation passed all over Maha-
rashtra. Sympathy and money poured in. Savarkar paid
the fine from the fund and donated the balance towards the
Industrial Fimd known as the Paisa Fund.

In one respect this incident is significant, for it marked the
fight between two coming ideologies which continued in
Indian politics for years to come. Gandhiji from South Africa
criticised the bonfire, as, even for twenty years thereafter, he
hugged the belief that boycott movement had its roots in
hatred and violence. And Gandhiji was not far away from
his Guru in this opinion. Gokhale said in his Presidential
Address at the Benares Congress in 1905 : “ It is well to
remember that the term ‘ boycott ’, owing to its origin, has
got unsavoury associations, and it conveys to the mind before
everything else a vindictive desire to injure another. Such
a desire on our part, as a normal feature of our relations with
England, is of course out of the question.”

The Moderates tried, but failed in winning over Savarkar to
their side. Savarkar had great regard for Gokhale’s great
talents and profound patriotism, but he differed from him
fundamentally and temperamentally as well. The feelings
and opinions of the professors, who were mostly Moderates,
about Savarkar were mingled with awe and aversion. For
their part they respected his intellectual powers, admired his
fervid oratory, but detested his revolutionary views. One of
them, Prof. Patwardhan, foretold that Savarkar was bound to
be a great demagogue. Time has its revenge. Thirty-eight
years later presiding over the Diamond Jubilee celebrations of
his disciple Savarkar, Sir R. P. Paranjpe said with pride :
“ In his younger days as I knew him, Savarkar was marked
by a keen intellect, fervid eloquence, great fluency in writing
and magnetic personality. I remember his patriotism was
intense, but as is natural to young men, it was based entirely
on strong emotions not much regulated by cold reason.”

Paranjpe is only a great mathematician statesman. And
an extraordinary personality like Savarkar lies beyond the
pale of the general enunciation of his theorem as put in the
last line of his speech. Indeed if there is any great revolu-
tionary leader worth the name in the history of revolutions



22 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

whose emotions are regulated by cool reason, it is Savarkar.
This can be proved by citing occasions on which he bridled
the emotions and thoughtless daring plans of his lieutenants.
Moreover, if you are to be a leader of action or revolution,
you must raise your reason to a certain pitch of emotion.
Otherwise your reason will forget that you have to lead, leap
and lift and will rust !

While these turbulent and tumultuous days were rolling
by, Savarkar’s B.A. Examination was fast approaching. As
was always customary with him, he studied day and night at
the fag end of the year, made up all the studies in the last two
months, appeared for the examination and to the joy and jubi-
lations of the public came out successful. Congratulations
from all parts of Maharashtra were showered upon him. It
was not his personal triumph only. It was also the success
of the youth movement and the advancing tide of nationalism.

In the meanwhile Savarkar the prolific writer was coming
to the front. His famous ballads on Tanaji and Baji Prabhu,
the heroes of the Maratha history, were penned during this
period. The ballads were proscribed, but they attained the
popularity of folk songs in Maharashtra during the last four
decades until at last they were restored in Free India. His
lyric of patriotism, his inspiring songs of heroes, his ballads
and hymns thrilled clubs and kitchens, schools and choruses
and meetings, and he was hailed as a bard of Freedom or a
rebel poet. His famous poem on Widowhood of Hindu ladies
dealt severely with unjust customs and cruel traditions, and
brought out a very touching picture of the child widow,
attacking the brutal desires of old bridegrooms.

The charm of the poem was so irresistible that even men
like Kaka Kalelkar remember it today. In this poem one
finds the seeds of the great social reformer in Savarkar. The
poem won the prize in the competition for which it was meant,
the other rival sharing half the prize. “ What is everlasting
in this world ? ” Savarkar asks in another poem. He sings ;

“ The sun sets, the sea ebbs. All things rise and fall.’* In
this Savarkar hinted at the sure downfall of the British
Empire. That there is an end to everything is an eternal
truth.

During the same period Savarkar wrote many memorable



THE RISING LEADER


23

articles and brilliant essays. Among the important essays
ranks, “ Why should we celebrate the festival of historic
personalities ? ” This was a prize article. In this thought-
provoking and brilliant essay one is impressed by his pro-
found thinking, the historical deductions he has arrived at,
and the sweep of his originality. He concludes his essay in
a grand peroration : “ Why, then, should the historical func-
tions be celebrated ? To pay our national gratitude we owe
to those heroic souls. They should be celebrated as a mark
of reverence and remembrance of the immense good those
benevolent men have done to the world, because they have
sacred sanction of ancient traditions. They are the clouds
which shower the nectar of instruction. They are the monu-
ments of virtues. They are the chemicals that act as an incen-
tive to human thoughts and feelings. They are the preceptors
who impart virtuous instruction to the youths. They are the
living history of the deeds of noble heroes. Functions in their
honour should be celebrated because of this. There are so
many advantages and definitely no disadvantages. Especially
we, Hindus, should take to these functions for emerging out of
the present degraded state which was the result of want of
self-respect and dutifulness. For, that is the only easy and
sure path to the prosperity of the nation.”

Savarkar wrote brilliant prose. His imagination soared high
up in the sky on the wings of an eagle. It aspired to emulate
the loftiness of the Himalayas. It visualised “ the Himalayas
towering above the roof of the world to see whether there was
any other country under the sun as captivating as Hindu-
sthein. Elated at not finding on earth an equal of Hindusthan,
he opened the apartments of the heavens. But there, O Aryan
Land, instead of finding your equal, he found something else.
Enamoured of the snow-clad peaks of the Himcdayas, the
nymphs and the virgin attendants of the Gods clung to his
neck and deserting the capital of Indra, they lived with him.”
“ The diamonds and jewels,” proceeds Savarkar, “ O, Aryan
Mother, you have preserved for us in the mines can easily
crowd to overflowing a ship made of this vast world.”

One thing more and of tremendous significance. In 1902
Savarkar had written in the Kal one essay which he concluded
with a prophetic vision. He stated therein : “ Hindus are



24 SAVARKAB AND HIS TIMES

responsible for the poverty and disorderliness of Hindusthan.
But if they ever desire to attain prosperity, they must remain
as Hindus.” This deep-rooted, farsighted and fundamentally
original characteristic of Savarkar’s outlook differentiated him
from Tilak and Shivrampant Paranjpe.

in

Savarkar’s secret organisational work had not stopped
during those days. While at college he had convened in 1904
a meeting of some two hundred selected members of the
Mitra Mela. In an atmosphere fUled with grandeur and
religiosity, the name of the Revolutionary Party was changed
from the Mitra Mela to the Abhinava Bharat. Now the paiiy
girded up its loins to extend its political and revolutionary
activities and influence, spread its net all over India, and
assume the responsibility of a revolution on an all-Bharat
scale.

After passing his B.A. in December 1905, Savarkar went
to Bombay to study law. He had already passed his first
LL.B. in 1904, in Poona. In Bombay he organised youths
from different colleges. He had also propaganda meetings in
chawls. Sri Bal Gangadhar Kher, who later became the first
Premier of Bombay under the 1935 Government of India Act,
was one of those youths who came under the influence of the
leader of the Abhinava Bharat. Kher was an initiate of the
Abhinava Bharat. It was in Poona that Sri J. B. Kripalani,
an ex-President of the Indian National Congress, was initiated
into the Abhinava Bharat while he was a student in the Dec-
can College. Hundreds of youths now joined the organisation.

While in Bombay Savarkar contributed to the Vihari, a
local Marathi Weekly and made it the mouth-piece of the
Abhinava Bharat. Its circulation grew by leaps and bounds,
like its fiery sister weekly, the Yugantar of Bengal. Savarkar
was now the acclaimed leader of the revolutionary movement
which had spread almost all over Maharashtra. So he was
invited to deliver speeches at public meetings, festivals and
functions in Maharashtra. A brilliant young man with a black
cap, short-collared coat, square jaws, presentable forehead,
prominent cheek-bones, leader Savarkar was an energetic and



THE RISING LEADER 25

magnetic figure. The propaganda and popularity of the
revolutionary leader rose rapidly and his arrest seemed
inevitable. Rumours about his arrest were afloat in Nasik,
Poona and Bombay, but they proved to be false.

During his stay in Bombay Savarkar was one day called by
the students of Poona to interview a person named Agamya
Guru. Savai’kar went to Poona for the purpose. But in a
few minutes the interview terminated. The Agamya Guru
was as abstruse as his name. But more ridiculous was the
invention of the C.I.D. that traced Savarkar ’s inborn spring of
inspiration to the recluse. Poor creatures ! they knew not
that mathematics and mahatmatics never go together !

About this time news came to India that Pandit Shyamji
Krishna Varnia, then resident of London, offered scholarships
for Indian students desiring to study in Europe. Savarkar
revolved the idea in his mind. The scholarship being
insufficient he first approached his father-in-law in the matter.
He made sure of some help from him and applied for one of
the scholarshif'S with recommendations of Tilak and Shivram-
pant Paranjpe. Giving a brief sketch of his career Savarkar
proceeds in his application : “ Independence and Liberty I
look upon as the very pulse and breath of nation. From my
boyhood, dear sir, uptc» this moment of my youth, the loss of
Independence of my country- and the possibility of regaining
it form the only theme of which I dreamt by night and on
which I mused by day.” Tilak’s recommendation runs as
follows. ” When there is such a rush like that, it is no use
recommending any one particularly to your notice. But, still,
I may state, among the applicants there is one Mr. Savarkar
from Bombay, who graduated last year and whom I know to
be a spirited young man very enthusiastic in the swadeshi
cause so much so that he had to incur the displeasure of the
Fergusson College authorities. He has no mind to take up
Government service at any time and his moral character is
very good.” Pandit Shyamji Krishna Vai’ma agreed. Signing
an agreement before Tilak, Savarkar received a sum of Rs. 400
through him as the first instalment of the Shivaji Scholarship
which Pandit Varma awarded to him. Shivaji and Savarkar
were thus grouped together by Shyamji.



26 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

Savarkar made preparations for the voyage. On the eve of
his departure for liondon he was given a send-off at a big
public meeting in Nasik. He bade farewell to his wife and his
son named Prabhakar. Amidst an atmosphere filled with
various dreams of Savarkar’s futvure greatness his relations,
his comrades and devotees gave him in Bombay a hearty send-
off on June 9, 1906, and the steamer Persia, left Bombay on
her great voyage with the prince of Indian Revolutionaries on
her deck for the consummation of his great vision, great aim
and great deeds.
