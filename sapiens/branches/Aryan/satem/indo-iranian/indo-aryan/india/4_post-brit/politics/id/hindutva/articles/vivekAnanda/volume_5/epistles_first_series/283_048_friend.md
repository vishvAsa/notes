## XLVIII

C/O MISS DUTCHER,  
THOUSAND ISLAND PARK, N. Y.  
*31st July, 1895*.

DEAR FRIEND, (Francis Leggett)

I wrote you before this a letter, but as I am afraid it was not posted
carefully, I write another.

I shall be in time before the 14th. I shall have to come to New York
before the 11th anyway. So there will be time enough to get ready.

I shall go with you to Paris, for my principal object in going with you
is to see *you married*. When you go away for a trip, I go to London.
That is all.

It is unnecessary to repeat my everlasting love and blessings for you
and yours.

Ever your son,

VIVEKANANDA.
