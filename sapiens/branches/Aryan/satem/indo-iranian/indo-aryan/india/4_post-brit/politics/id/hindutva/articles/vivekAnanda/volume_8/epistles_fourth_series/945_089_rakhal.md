## LXXXIX

(*Translated from [Bengali](b7327e8089.pdf)* )

*To Swami Brahmananda*

MADRAS,  
*12th February, 1897*.

DEAR RAKHAL,

I am to start by *S.S. Mombasa* next Sunday. I had to give up
invitations from Poona and other places on account of bad health. I am
very much pulled down by hard work and heat.

The Theosophists and others wanted to intimidate me. Therefore I had to
give them a bit of my mind. You know they persecuted me all the time in
America, because I did not join them. They wanted to begin it here. So I
had to clear my position. If that displeases any of my Calcutta friends,
"God help them". You need not be afraid, I do not work alone, but He is
always with me. What could I do otherwise?

Yours,  
VIVEKANANDA.
