HIGH VIEW, CAVERSHAM, READING,  
*3rd July, 1896.*

DEAR SHASHI,

Send Kali to England as soon as you get this letter. . . . He will have
to bring some books for me. I have only got Rig-Veda Samhit훮. Ask him to
bring the Yajur-Veda, S훮ma-Veda, Atharva-Samhita, as many of the
Br훮hmanas as he can get, beginning with the Shatapatha, some of the
Sutras, and Y훮ska's Nirukta. . . .

Let there be no delay as in Sharat's case, but let Kali come at once.
Sharat has gone to America, as he had no work to do here. That is to
say, he was late by six months, and then when he came, I was here. . . .

Yours affectionately,

VIVEKANANDA.
