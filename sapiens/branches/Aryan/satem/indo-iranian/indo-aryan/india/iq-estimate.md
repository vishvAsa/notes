Mauritius reports average IQs of 87-99 across sources, averaging ~92; Suriname similarly 89-96, ~92. These proxy the floor from poorest Indian migrants' descendants.  
Indian Americans score ~112, representing a selected ceiling. 

India's average likely sits at 90-100, boosted by urban elites and recent gains in nutrition/education, exceeding pessimistic Lynn-era estimates of 76-82 that undervalue Flynn effects and sampling biases.
