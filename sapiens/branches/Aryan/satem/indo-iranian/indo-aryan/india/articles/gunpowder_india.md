Gunpower (Agnichurna) was NOT brought by the Mughals. Hindus are using it from Ancient times. The Hindus of remote areas during the Vedic age were very familiar with Gunpower. Raja-laksmi-narayana-hrdya which is found in Atharva Rahasya have mentioned it. 

In the 4th Century BC, the Kautilya have mentioned the use of Saltpetre (Agnichurna) for warfare and for other purpose too in Arthashashtra .

“Shukra Niti” have described Astra (weαpon for throwing) and Shastras (other weαpon than Astra). Astra means the Cαnnon used for action by the Hindu king. Even the Formula of Gunpowder is mentioned: 5 parts suvarchi salt, 1 part of sulphur, 1 part of Charcoal from wood of arkaSholka. 21,24,31 of Sukraniti says a king should Big 2 war chariot with Cannon arms and weapons. Sukraniti have even also described the Small and Large firearm.

In fact in reference from Wandering Monks Chin Shish Pu Wu Chiu Shu Chüeh (TT900) in 664 A.D, indicating the knowledge of Saltpetre was already possessed by Indian Monk visiting China.Apollonius who travelling India says “The truly wise men (Hindus) dwelt between the river Hypasis and the Ganga, beloved God overthrew thunderbolts shot from their Walls”. 

Chinese text dated 7th century CE, mentions that people of North-West India were aware of the Existence of Saltpetre and its use in producing purple flames.

Another proof mentioned in Halhed's Code of Gentoo Law, which is persian translation of Sanskrit law made by Brahmins mentioned “Agni-Astra” which means firearms or Fire arrow discharge from bamboo. Sataghni mentioned ‘Hundred killer’ was a Cαnnon.

Majmulat Tawarikha translated in 1126 from Arabic, previously a century ago translated from Sanskrit says “Brahmins counseled Hal to have elephants made of clay and to place it in the Van of his Army and when army of king of Kashmir drew night,the elephant exploded and flαmes  and Destroyed a great portion of the Invading Force”.

All the ingredients was easily available in India and was used too. Like Salpetre was plentiful in Gangetic India. It was also exported to Europe from Gujarat and Bombay. Sulphur was especially found in Sind and imported to other part of India. Charcoal was available from Arka. 

In 1442-43 King Rana Kumba supplied 2 Cannon cast in an alloy of copper to one of his allies. This was known as Kaman-i-rad. During Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's time, Marathi Literature brought the transition of technical terms of gunpowder and Fire arm from the Sanskrit words. Raghunatha Pandita mentioned in his Rājavyāvahārakosha (1676 A D).

Mughal were the one who ordered Jumdat-ul-Mulk to write to the Mutsaddis of all Provinces of the empire to display of Fire-works is being FORBIDDEN. FAULAD KHAN ordered to arrange annoucement with beating the drum all over city that no one is to indulge in ‘attisbazi’.

Abul fazl mentioned that Akbar was using ‘Saltpetre’ as Gunpowder. Saltpetre was already there from Ancient India. If something is present from Ancient times, then how did Mughals bring Gunpowder to India? Agnichurna is a Sanskrit word, in Malayalam sometimes the word “Vedi” was also used which means “explosion”. And from north to south the Agnichurna, fire powder was used.

Professor Wilson, director of the Asiatic Society at Calcutta in his paper which was read before the society in 1848 observed that the Knowledge of Gundpower was from an “Ancient People of India” and from the Sanskrit writings. With time, in place Sanskrit word, Non-Sanskrit words were also used for Agnichurna. After the downfall of Aurangzeb, the ban on firework was lifted by the British. And once again the use of fire work started again. Look at the painting, you can see a man selling lamps, fire crackers and pots etc.
