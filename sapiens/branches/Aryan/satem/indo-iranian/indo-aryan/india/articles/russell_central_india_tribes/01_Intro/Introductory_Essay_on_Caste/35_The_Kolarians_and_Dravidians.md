title = "35 The Kolarians and Dravidians"

+++

These tribes are divided into two families, the Munda or Kolarian, named after the Kol tribe, and the Dravidian, of which the former are generally held to be the older and more primitive. The word Kol is probably the Santāli *hār*, a man. “This word is used under various forms, such as *hār, hāra, ho* and *koro* by most Munda tribes in order to denote themselves. The change of *r* to *l* is familiar and presents no difficulty.”70 The word is also found in the alternative name Ho for the Kol tribe, and in the names of the cognate Korwa and Korku tribes. The word Munda is a Sanskrit derivative meaning a head, and, as stated by Sir H. Risley, is the common term employed by the Kols for the headman of a village, whence it has been adopted as an honorific title for the tribe. In Chota Nāgpur those Kols who have partly adopted Hinduism and become to some degree civilised are called Munda, while the name Ho or Larka \(fighting\) Kol is reserved for the wilder section of the tribe.
