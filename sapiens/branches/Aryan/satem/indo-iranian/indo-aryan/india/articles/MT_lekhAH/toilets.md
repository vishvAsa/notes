Excellent. I don't know if the twt sparking was just ignorance or kutarka. Whatever the case, even if we drop the whole Harappan thing for a moment there is evidence from the historical period for urban residential drainage. e.g. mauryan drains in pATaliputra; shu~Nga drain at Atrajinkhera; shu~Nga to gupta drains in Mathura; septic tank at mathurA; there have been several reports in the Indian archaeological literature. 

Moreover the smR^iti-s say that voiding malamUtrau should be done in silence in secluded spots with many negative qualifiers. It was hardly like  a place where people chatted at leisure. May be that happened in ancient Rome. The ASI report this a gupta age toilet fitting from a "monastery" so it would be internal not open.
