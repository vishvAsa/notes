+++

The word ‘Caste,’ Dr. Wilson states,1 is not of Indian origin, but is derived from the Portuguese *casta*, signifying race, mould or quality. The Indian word for caste is *jāt* or *jāti*, which has the original meaning of birth or production of a child, and hence denotes good birth or lineage, respectability and rank. *Jātha* means well-born. Thus *jāt* now signifies a caste, as every Hindu is born into a caste, and his caste determines his social position through life.
