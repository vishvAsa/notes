<p><strong>PREFATORY NOTE</strong></p>
<p>This volume contains a reprint of (i)&quot; Vaiṣṇavism, Śaivism, and Minor Religious Systems&quot;included in the <em>Grundriss der Indoarischen Philologie</em> and first published in 1913; and (ii)&quot; Wilson Philological Lectures on Sanskrit and the Derived Languages&quot; delivered in 1877 and first published in a collected form in 1914. The first work was issued without any Preface. The Preface to the second work is dated, Sangam, Poona, 22nd June, 1914, and is reproduced below:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was appointed Wilson Philological Lecturer in 1877 and was thus the first lecturer under the Endowment. My subject was the Sanskrit and the Prakrit languages derived from it. I understood the Prakrit in a comprehensive sense, so as to include modern Vernaculars of Northern India also; and thus delivered a course of seven lectures on Sanskrit in its several forms, the Pall and the Dialects of the period, the Prakrits and the Apabhramsa, Phonology of the Vernaculars, Remnants of the older Grammatical Forms in the Vernaculars, New Grammatical Formations to supply the place of the forms that had disappeared, and the General Questions as to the relation between these several languages. The method I followed is strictly historical, tracing the modern Vernaculars from the original Sanskrit through all the different stages of development of which we have evidence, and assigning the different transformations to their causes, natural or physical, racial, and historical. These lectures, with the exception of the fifth and sixth, were thoroughly revised afterwards and the first two and the seventh were published in Vol. XVI of the Journal, BBRAS, between the years 1883 and 1885; while the third and the fourth were published between 1887 and 1889. The other two lectures remained in manuscript for a long time, until I finished in 1911 my book on &ldquo;Vaiṣṇavism, Śaivism etc, which was written for the series of Encyclopedia of Indo-Aryan Research, which is being published at Strassburg by Karl J. Trubner. These have now been revised and I publish them for the first time along with a reprint of the five lectures in the present volume. The delay in the publication has been due to my having had to attend to more urgent work, such as the preparation of a translation of the Vāyu Purāṇa for the &ldquo;Sacred Books of the East, which had afterwards to be given up, the preparation of my Early History of the Deccan and the Search for Sanskrit Manuscripts and writing my several Reports on them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As, since 1908, my eye-sight has greatly impaired and I am unable to read mattor printed in ordinary type or an ordinary manuscript, I have had to depend on Readers and Amanuenses. The work on &ldquo;Vaiṣṇavism, Śaivism, etc.&rdquo; was written under these conditions, but the publication of the present volume was undertaken by my eldest son, Professor Shridhar Ramkrishna Bhandarkar, who has been associated with me in a good deal of my literary work. The lectures were all carried through the press by him at the sacrifice of a good deal of time and trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I regret to find some misprints in the present volume, but one-half of them occur in the fifth and the sixth lectures, which had to be set up from manuscript. There are comparatively few instances in the reprints of the other five lectures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Bhandarker&rsquo;s classical work on Vaiṣṇavism, Śaivism, and Minor Religious Systems, being included in a costly German Series of publications, was not easily accessible to students in India, although greatly in demand. Sir Ramkrishna accordingly purchased from Messrs. Walter de Gruyter &amp; Co., Berlin, assign of the firm Karl J. Trubner of Strassburg, the right to issue an <em>Indian Edition</em> of the work, and this right the B. O. R. Institute. has purchased from him. The Indian Edition of the first book was issued separately in 1928. In the present volume it is incorporated along with the Wilson Philological Lectures.</p>
<p>The three Indexes to Vaiṣṇavism Śaivism and Minor Religious Systems were originally compiled by Dr. V. S. Sukthankar, M. A., Ph. D. The same have been retained here with necessary changes in pagination. The Indexes to the Wilson Philological Lectures have been prepared by me.</p>
<p>I was suddenly taken ill by paralysis on Thursday, September 8, 1927, I was unconscious for more than a month, and I am not yet completely recovered, although—thank God—I am slowly. but surely regaining strength. For more than one year, Mr. G. N. Shrigondekar, B. A., of the Publication Department of the Bhandarkar Institute had to do the proof-correction and all other work in connection with this volume. To him and to all friends I am very sincerely thankful for all they did. Recently, I am recommended for Invalid&rsquo;s Pension.</p>
<p>With the present volume, three Volumes of Sir R. G. Bhandarkar&rsquo;s works are now ready. The fourth volume, which however will be the first in order, will be ready next year. It may then be considered whether I may be able to compile a short biography of Sir R. G. Bhandarkar as originally contemplated.</p>
<p>The publication of the present volume in time for the annual literary tribute to be paid by the Bhandarkar Or. R. Institute would not have been feasible in my present invalid state had not the Press and the Publication Departments of the Institute—and especially Dr. V. G. Paranjpe, M. A., LL. B., D. LITT., the Superintendent of both,—come to my assistance. I offer him here my grateful thanks for the assistance, the extent of which cannot be adequately gauged.</p>

VAIṢṆAVISM.<br>
<strong>I. Introductory.</strong></p>
<p>§The<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> old Vedic gods became indissolubly involved in the elaborate and mechanical system of worship that had grown up.Speculations as regards the appropriateness of the rules and modest of worship, and their efficacy as regards man&rsquo;s good in this world and the next, became prevalent. But all this did not satisfy the religious spirit of the people. Religious speculation of a more. natural order came to be established about the close of the Hymnperiod and was continued into that of the Upaniṣads. The various problems about God, man, and the world, engaged the attention of many thinkers, and a variety of solutions was arrived at. It is generally believed that the Upaniṣads teach a system of Pantheism; but a close examination will show that they teach not one, but various systems of doctrines as regards the nature of God, man, and the world and the relations between them. The religio-philosophic systems of modern times, which are mutually inconsistent, quote texts from the Upaniṣads as an authority for their special doctrines. These references to the old books are correct in the most prominent cases, but when the advocates of the systems force into other texts of an opposite nature a meaning consistent with their own special doctrines, they are manifestly wrong. That the Upaniṣads teach not one but various systems must follow. from the fact that they are compilations just as the ṚgvedaSaṁhitāis The speculations of the old, seers were clothed by them in words, and these were handed down orally and came to form a large floating mass. When the idea of collecting these speculations arose, they were incorporated into books for the use of individual Vedic schools. Hence it is that we find certain</p>
<p>verses, passages and whole sections occurring in one Upaniṣad reproduced in another¹.</p>
<p>No doubt, the idea of the immanence of God in the world is very prominent in the Upaniṣads. But if that is what constitutes Pantheism, the liberal religious thought of the present day in Europe also must be regarded as Pantheistic. With the immanence of God is associated his transcendence also, as stated in the Vedānta-Sutra II. 1. 27.In addition to these two doctrines the Upaniṣads teach that God is the protector of all beings, is the lord of all and dwells in the heart of man, that seeing him as he is and everywhere, is eterual bliss; that this is to be attained by contemplation and the purification of the soul, and that in the blissful condition the individual soul attains to a perfect similarity with the supreme soul. They also teach the absorption of the individual soul into the supreme as of a river into the ocean, and the unconsciousness of the soul when everything but. himself fades away from his knowledge. In this respect the doctrine may be regarded as Pantheistic or as setting forth the illusory character of all phenomena. Speculation in the Upaniṣad times was very free, and it veared round even to the denial of the soul as a substance.</p>
<p>In the subsequent development of religious thought and worship, these Upaniṣad doctrines played an active part The Heno-</p>

As stated in the text, the Upaniṣads from the very nature of the compilations cannot but be expected to teach not one, but many systems of doctrine.</p>

<p>theism, so fully explained by Max Muller, and its ultimate result, the identification of the various gods, also influenced later thinkers. The conception that the supreme spirit manifests himself in various forms which we find expressed in the Upaniṣadsis a development, in the opposite direction, of the idea that one God, for instance Agni, is the same as Varuna, Mitra, Indra and Aryaman.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> If these several gods are one, one god may become several. This led to the conception of Incarnations or Avatāras, which plays such a prominent part in the later religious systems.</p>
<p>But for ordinary people, an adorable object, with a more distinct personality than that which the theistic portions of the Upaniṣads attributed to God, was necessary and the philosophia speculations did not answer practical needs. Thus some of the old Vedic gods, and others, which were new, became the objects of worship.</p>
<p>II. The Rise of a New Theistic System.</p>
<p>§2. The tide of free speculations culminated in the east into such systems as those of Buddhism and Jainism; and though they denied the existence of God as a creator, or did not use the ides for the promotion of righteousness, and the former practically denied the existence of the human soul as a substance, still, these systems had the needful personal element in the shape of their founders. In the west, however, a theistic system with a god who had come to dwell among men arose. The various religious systems and superstitions that prevailed in the fourth century. B. C. are given in the following passage, occurring in the Niddess, which though of the nature of a commentary is regarded as one of the books of the Pall Buddhistic Canon<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>: &ldquo;The deity of the lay followers of the Ājivakas is the Ājivakas, of those of the Nighanthas is the Nighanthas, of those of the Jaṭilas (ascetics wearing long matted hair) is the Jaṭilas, of those of the Paribbājakasis the Paribbājakas, of those of the Avaruddhakas is the Avaruddhakas, and the deity of those who are devoted to an elephant, a horse, a cow, a dog, a crow, Vāsudeva, Baladeva, Puṇṇabhadda, Maṇibhadda, Aggi, Nāgas, Supaṇṇas, Yakkhas,</p>
<p>Asuras, Gandhabbas, Mahārājas, Canda, Suriya, India, Brahmā, Deva, Disā is the elephant, the horse, the cow, the dog, the crow, Vāsudeva, Baladeva, Puṇṇabhadda, Maṇibhadda, etc., respectively.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here a Buddhist who cannot but be expected to show scant courtesy to religious systems other than his own, places the worshippers of Vāsudeva and Baladeva on the same level with those of fire, moon, sun and Brahmā, and even elephants, crows, dogs, etc. But the worship of Vāsudeva was destined to become the predominant religion of a large part of India even to the supersession of that of fire, sun, moon and Brahmāand, of course, of the superstitious adoration of the lower animals. And it will be now our duty to trace its rise and progress.</p>
<p>§ 3. In his comment on Pāṇini IV. 3 98, Patañjali distinctly states that the Vāsudeva contained in the Sūtra is the name of the &quot; worshipful &ldquo;, i. e., of one who is pre-eminently worshipful, i. e., God.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> The worship of Vāsudeva must be regarded to be as old as Pāṇini.</p>
<p>In an Inscription found at Ghosundi in Rajputāna<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>which unfortunately is in a mutilated condition, the construction of a wall round the hall of worship of Saṁkarṣaṇa and Vāsudeva is mentioned. From the form of the characters in the Inscription it appears to have been engraved at least two hundred years B. C.</p>
<p>In another Inscription recently discovered at Besnagar,<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> Heliodora represents himself to have erected a Garuḍadhvaja or a column with the image of Garuḍa at the top in honour of Vāsudeva, the god of gods. Heliodora calls himself a Bhāgavaṭa, was the son of Diya, was a native of Takṣaśila and is spoken of as an ambassador of the Yavana and as such came on a political mission from. Aṁtalikita to Bhagabhadra who must have ruled over EasternMalwa. In this Inscription occurs the name Aṁtalikita which in all likelihood is the same as Antialkidas of the Bactro-Greek coins. This name as well as the form of the characters show that it belongs to the earlier part of the second century before the</p>
<p>Christian era. At that timeVāsudeva was worshipped as the god of gods and his worshippers were called Bhāgavatas The Bhāgavata religion prevailed in the northwestern part of India and was adopted even by the Greeks.</p>
<p>In the Inscription No. 1 in the large cave at Nānāghāt,<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> the names of Saṁkarṣaṇa and Vāsudeva, in a Dvandva compound, occur along with those of other deities in the opening invocation. This Inscription appears from the form of the characters to belong to the first century before the Christian era.</p>
<p>In the passage in the Mahabhāṣya in which Patañjali, to account for the appearance of the name Vāsudeva in Pāṇini IV. 3. 98, says that this is not the name of a Kṣatriya, but that of the Worshipful One, the question to be considered is whether Patañjali means this Vāsudeva to be quite unconnected with the Vāsudeva of the Vṛṣṇi race. From the occurrence of the names Vāsudeva and Baladeva close to each other in the passage from the Niddessa referred to above, and that of Saṁkarṣaṇa and Vāsudeva as worshipful or divine persons in a Dvandva compound in two of three above Inscriptions, it appears that the Vasudeva referred to by Patañjali as the Worshipful One must be the Vāsudeva of the race. But to account for the appearance of the name in the Sūtra, though the required form can he made up in accordance with the next Sūtra (Panini, IV. 3. 99), Patañjali says that Pāṇini looks at Vāsudeva in his capacity as a divine person and not as a Kṣatriya One must take it in this sense, since the Ghosundi Inscription noticed above, in which Saṁkarṣaṇa and Vāsudeva are associated as worshipful persons, must be older than Patañjali himself. Besides, Patañjali begins the discussion of the Sutra by first taking Vāsudeva as the name of a Kṣatriya. and raising an objection against it. This objection is answered in one way, Vāsudeva being still regarded as a Kṣatriya, and it is only optionally that he gives another explanation, that that name is not the name of a Kṣatriya, but of a divine person. This optional explanation given in the last resort must, therefore, be understood in the sense given above. And from all the accounts of the Bhagavata school contained in the whole literature it is clear that the worshipful Vāsudeva belonged to the Vṛṣṇii race.</p>
<p>III. Analysis of the Nārāyaṇiya Section of the Mahābhārata.</p>
<p>§ 4. Having thus established on irrefragable evidence thex existence during the three or four centuries before Christ of a religion with Vāsudeva as its central figure, and of a school of hist followers, known by the name of Bhāgavata, I will now proceed to examine the detailed accounts contained in the literature and especially in the Mahābhārata. This was not done before, because the date of the Mahābhārata or any portion of it cannot be ascertained with any approach to certainty. The Nārāyaṇīya section. of the Śantiparvan, to which we shall devote a detailed considersation, is, however, older than Śaṁkarācarya who quotes from it.</p>
<p>Nārada is represented to have gone to the Badarikāśrama to see Nara and Nārāyaṇa The latter was engaged in the performance of religious rites. Nārada asked Nārāyaṇa whom he worshipped, while he himself was the Supreme Lord. Nārāyaṇa told him that he worshipped his original Prakṛti (form), the source of all that is and that is to ba. Nara and Nārāyaṇa as well as Krṣṇa and Hari, sons of Dharma, are represented as the forms of the Supreme.</p>
<p>Nārada flies into the sky to see that original Prakṛti and alights on a peak of Meru. There he saw white men without sense, not esting anything, sinless, with heads like umbrellas, making a sound like that of thundering clouds and devoted to Bhgavat. Then Yudhiṣṭhira asks Bhiṣma who those people were, and how they came to be what they were. Bhiṣma tells the story of the king Vasu Uparicara, who worshipped God according to the Sātvata Vidhi (form of ritual). He was a glorious king honoured by Indra, devoted to truth and holy. The best of the learned in the Pañcarātra system were honoured with the first seat at dinner by him.</p>
<p>The narrator then proceeds to mention the Citrasikhaṇḍins, who appear to be the original promulgators of this religion. The mountain Meru was the place where they revealed it. They were. Seven, consisting of Marici, Atri, Angiras, Pulastys, Pulaha,</p>
<p>Kratu, and Vasiṣṭha. The eighth was Svāyaṁbhuva. From these eight, emanated this excellent Sāstra. This they promulgated in the presence of the great Bhagavat, who said to the Rṣis: &ldquo;You have composed a hundred thousand excellent Ślokas (stanzas), which contain rules for all the affairs of men and are in harmony with Yajus, Sāman, Re, and Atharvānṅgiras, and lay down precepts about the religion of action as well as that of contemplation or repose. I created Brahman from my peaceful and Rudra from my wrathful nature. This Śāstra will be handed down from person to person until it reaches Bṛhaspati. From Bṛhaspati the king. Vasu will obtain it. The king will follow this Śāstra and will become my devotee. After his death this Śāstra will be lost.&rdquo; Telling all this the great god disappeared. Then the Citraśikhanḍins spread the religion until it reached Bṛhaspati.</p>
<p>Then the old Kalpa having ended and the son of Aṅgiras, the priest of the gods, being born, the gods were happy. The king Vasu Uparicars was his first pupil. He learned this Śāstra from Bṛhaspati. At one time he brought forward an extensive horsesacrifice, but no animal was killed on the occasion. The oblations were devised in accordance with the words of the Araṇyakas. The god of gods showed himself to Vasu and accepted his oblation, but was unseen by anybody else. Since the oblation was taken away by Fari without showing himself to Bṛhaspati, the lattar got angry and dashed upwards the sacrifical ladle. At that sacrifice, Ekats, Dvita, and Trita, sons of Prjāpati, and sixteen Rsis, many of whom are known as the authors of literary works, such as Medhātithi, Tittiri, and Taṇḍya are represented to have been present.</p>
<p>When Bṛhaspatil was angry, they all said that the great Hari was not to be seen by any man at random, but by one who was favoured by his graca. Ekata, Dvits and Trita said: &ldquo;On one occasion we went to the north for the attainment of eternal bliss near the Milky Ocean, and practised austerities for four thousand years and at the end a voice in the sir declared: Well, how can you see that great Lord? In the Milky Ocean there is a White Island where there are men possessing the lustre of the moon, who are the devotees of the god, possess no senses, do not eat any thing and being devoted solely to the god (Ekāntin or monothaistic) ara absorbed in him, who is bright like the sun. Go to</p>
<p>that island; there shines my soul&rsquo;. Accordingly we went to the white island, and, dazzled by the light of that being, were not able to see him. Then the truth flashed upon us that the god cannot be seen by us unless we have gone through susterities. After further susterities for a hundred years we saw the men of the lustre of the moon with their minds fully absorbed in the contemplation of God. The refulgence of each man was like that of the sun on the last day. Then we heard a sound: Jitam te Puṇḍarikākṣa etc. (Triumphant art thou, Lotus-eyed one !). A short time after, a voice in the air declared: &lsquo;Go you away as you came. That great being is not to be seen by one who is not devoted to him. Then we returned without being able to see him. How then will you be able to see him?&rdquo; Having heard this from Ekats, Dvita and Trita, Bṛhaspati finished the sacrifice.</p>
<p>Vasu Uparicara had to live in a hole in the earth on account of the ourse of the Rṣis, who in a controversy with the gods maintained that no animal should be sacrificed, but only vegetable, grain, while the gods contended that a goat should be sacrificed. The question was referred to Vasu who declared in favour of the gods. Vasu was raised from the hole by Nārāyaṇa, whom he had devotedly worshipped, by sending his Garuda to lift him up. He was thence taken to the Brahmaworld.</p>
<p>The story of Nārada&rsquo;s visit to Śvetadvipa is then continued. He praises the great Being by uttering names expressive of his purity and grandeur, and the great Being then manifested himself to him saying that he was not to be seen by one who was not solely devoted to him (Ekāntin), and that, as Nārada was such a one, he showed himself to him. He then proceeds to explain to him the religion of Vāsudeva. Vāsudeva is the supreme soul, the internal soul of all souls. He is the supreme creator. All living beings are represented by Saṁkarṣaṇa, who is a form of Vāsudeva. From Saṁkarṣaṇa sprang Pradyumna, the mind, and from Pradyumna, Aniruddha, self-consciousness. &ldquo;Those who are devoted to me enter into me and are released.&rdquo; The great being calls four above mentioned his forms (Mūrtis). The production of one form from another is also mentioned; all these forms are however, styled his forms (Mūrtis). He then proceeds to mention the creation of gods and all other things by himself and their final</p>
<p>dissolution into himself. Then are mentioned his incarnations (Avatāras), viz. Varāha, Narasiṁha, the oppressor of Bali, Rāma of the Bhṛgu race and destroyer of the Kṣatriyas, Rāma Dāśarathi, and &ldquo;he who will come into existence for the destruction of Kaṁsa at Mathurā and after having killed many demons will finally settle at Dvārakā.&rdquo; In this manner having done all things by his four Mūrtis, he destroyed Dvārakā with the Sātvatas and went to Brahmsloks After Nārada had heard this from the supreme Nārāyaṇa, he returned to Badarikāśrama.</p>
<p>What follows at the end of chapter 339 and in the next four chapters has little bearing on our subject, except that in one of them the etymological sense of Vāsudeva is given as one who covers the whole world and is the resting-place (Adhivāsa) of all beings.</p>
<p>In chapter 344 the path of those who are free from sin is given thus:—The sun is the gate, and after entrance all their material impurities being burnt, they remain as atoms in him then released from him, they enter into the Aniruddha form, and becoming mind, enter into the Pradyumna form. Leaving that form, they enter into that of Saṁkarṣaṇa, i. e., the form of the individual soul (Jīva). Afterwards being free from the three Guṇas, they enter into the Supreme Soul, who exists everywhere and who is Vāsudeva.</p>
<p>In chapter 346 Vaiśaṁpāyana relates to Janamejaya that the Dharma which Nārada got from the Lord of the world&rsquo;, Nārāyana himself, in all its details and peculiarities, was explained briefly to him (Janamejaya) in the Harigita. In chapter 348 this Ekāntika Dharma is represented to be the same as that which was communicated to Arjuna at the beginning of the war. At the creation of each Brahmā, this Dharma was revealed by Nārāyana, and then at the end of the Brahmā it was lost. In the account of the fourth Brahmā the Dharma revealed is twice called. Sātvata. In this manner it goes on up to the present or the seventh Brahmā, in which that Dharma was first communicated to Pitāmaha, and from him it passed in succession to Dakṣa, his grandson, the eldest Āditya, Vivasvat, Manu and Ikṣvāku. Later on it is stated that this original great eternal Dharma, difficult to be known and to be followed, is professed by the Sātvatas.</p>
<p>This Dharma is associated with the non-slaughter ofanimals(Ahiṁsā) and when properly exercised, the lord Hari is pleased with it. Sometimes one Vyūha or form of the Lord is taught and sometimes two, three or four. Vaiśaṁpayana winds up by saying that he has thus explained the Ekāntadharma.</p>
<p>§ 5. Here we have two accounts, the second of which is interwoven with the first. The former, however, appear to relate to a more ancient condition of things. The points to be noticed are these: 1. At the sacrifice instituted by Vasu Uparicara no animals were killed. 2. The oblations were devised in accordance with the teachings of the Āraṇyakas which include the Upaniṣads. 3. The chief deity was the God of gods, who is also called Hari. 4. This Hari or God of gods is not to be seen by one who follows the sacrificial mode of worship, such as Bṛhaspati did, nor by persons who practise austerities for thousands of years, as Ekata, Dvita and Trita did, but by one who worships Him with devotion as Vasu Uparicara did.</p>
<p>Here then is an attempt to introduce a religious reform on more conservative principles than Buddhism and Jainism did. The repudiation of the slaughter of animals and the inefficacy of sacrificial worship and austerities are common to this religious reform with Buddhism. But that the supreme lord Hari is to be worshipped with devotion, and the words of the Āraṇyakas are not to be rejected, are doctrines which are peculiar to it. Vasu Uparicara&rsquo;s story goes so far only.</p>
<p>In the main account, according to which Nārada visited the White Island, wo have a re-assertion of the doctrine that the Supreme Soul can be seen by one who worships him with devotion. The great Nārāyaṇa manifests himself to him and explains the religion of Vāsudeva and his three other forms (Vyūhas). He also mentions the future incarnations of Vāsudeva, and one of these is that assumed at Mathurā for the destruction of Kaṁsa. The supreme Nārāyaṇa indentifies himself with Vāsudeva in hisfour forms (Vyūhas). At the end it is stated that the religion is followed by the Sātvatas.</p>
<p>These two accounts seem to represent two stages in the progress of reform. In the earlier one the worship of Vāsudeva and</p>
<p>his three other forms is not known. The Supreme God is named Hari, and his worship has net thoroughly emancipated itself from the religion of sacrifices. The reform had no reference to specific historical personages and was promulgated by certain sages who are called Citraśikhaṇḍins and whose names had been handed down by tradition. The later account connects the reform with Vāsudeva and his brother, son and grandson, and the new religion is represented to have been identical with that taught in the Bhagavadgītā. This reformed system is said to have been promulgated by Nārāyaṇa himself.</p>
<p>It thus appears that the idea of a religion of devotion arose in earlier times, but it received a definite shape when Vāsudeva revealed the Gitā to Arjuna, and led to the formation of an Independent sect, when his brother, son and grandson were associated with him as his forms presiding over certain psychological categories, or as persons areated by him for the purpose. That sect became conterminous with the race of the Sātvatas. We have now to consider who these Sātvatas were.</p>
<p>IV. The Sātvatas and their Religion.</p>
<p>§ 6. In the Ādiparvan, Vāsudeva addressing the Vṛṣṇis says that Pārtha does not think them who are Sātvatas to be covetous. Vāsudeva is called Sātvata in Ādip. 218. 12; Kṛtavarman in Ādip. 221, 31; Sātyaki in Droṇap. 97. 36; and Janārdans in Udyogap. 70. 7. At the end of chap. 66 of the Bhīṣmaparvan, Bhīṣma says: &ldquo;This eternal god, mysterious, beneficent and loving should be known as Vāsudeva, and Brāhmaṇas, Kṣatriyas. Vaiśyas and Sūdras worship him by their devoted actions. At the end of the Dvāpara and the beginning of the Kali age, he was sung or expounded by Saṁkarṣaṇa according to the Sātvata rites (Vidhi).</p>
<p>At the end of chap. 12 of the third book of the Viṣṇu-Purāna it is stated in the account of the genealogy of the Yādavas and the Vṛṣṇis that Sātvata was the son of Aṁśa, and all his descendants were after him called Sātvatas. The Bhāgavata represents the Sātvatas as calling the highest Brahman Bhagavat and Vāsudeva (IX.9.49), and having a peculiar mode of worshipping him. It mentions the Sātvatas along with the Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis, which were Yādava tribes (I. 14. 25; III. 1. 29), and calls Vāsudeva, Sātvatarsabha (X. 58. 42; XI. 27. 5).</p>
<p>In Patañjali under Pāṇini IV. 1. 114, Vāsudeva and Baladeva are given as derivatives from Vṛṣṇinames in the sense of sons of Vāsudeva and Baladeva. Instances given by the Kāśika of the same are Vāsudeva and Āniruddha. Here Āniruddha means the son of Aniruddha, and therefore Vāsudeva must mean the son of Vāsudeva and not of Vasudeva, as will appear from what follows. In the latter work under Pāṇini VI. 2.34, Sini-Vāsudevāḥ is given as a Dvandva of royal Vṛṣṇinames, each of them being in the plural, and Saṁkarṣaṇa-Vāsudevau as a Dvandva of royal Vṛṣṇi names each being in the singular, so that Vāsudeva means both the individual of that name and his sons.</p>
<p>From all this and such other passages from Patañjali it will appear that Sātvata was another name of the Vṛṣṇi race of which Vāsudeva, Saṁkarṣaṇa, and Aniruddha were members, and that the Sātvatas had a religion of their own according to which Vāsudeva was worshipped as the Supreme Being, and thus the account given above from the Nārāyaṇīya is amply confirmed.</p>
<p>§ 7. It therefore appears that this religion of devotion to Vāsudeva ascends as high into antiquity as Pāṇini himself. As I have mentioned elsewhere, the Kṣatriyas engaged themselves in active speculations on religious matters about the time of the Upaniṣads¹, and are mentioned even as the original possessors of the new knowledge. Siddhārtha and Mahāvira founded in this period of intellectual fermentation new systems of religion in the east or the Magadha country, which discarded or passed over in silence the doctrine of the existence even of God and laid down selfabnegation and a course of strict moral conduct as the way to salvation. They belonged to the Sākya and Jñātṛka races of Kṣatriyas, and Buddhism and Jainism might be considered to be the religions of those tribes. The west, however, was not so radical in its speculations, and the race of Sātvatas developed a system of religion which took up the ideas of a Supreme God and devotion to him as the mode of salvation.</p>
<p>These Sātvatas and the worship of Vāsudeva-Kṛṣṇa seem clearly to be alluded to by Megasthenes, who was the Macedonian</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.Vorhandlungen des VII. Internet. Orientalisten-Congress zu Wien. Ar. Sect., pp. 108-9. [ This article is included in Vol. I of this Edition. N.B.U.]</p>
<p>ambassador at the court of Candragupta, the Maurya. Candragupta reigned in the last quarter of the fourth century B. C. The statement of Megasthenes is that Herakles was specially worshipped by the Sourasenoi, an Indian nation, in whose land are two great cities, Methora and Kleisobora, and through it flows the navigable river Jobares. The Sourasenoi were the Sūrasenās, a tribe of Kṣatriyas, who lived in the region in which was situated Mathurā, corresponding to Methora in the above passage, and in which flowed the river Jubares, which has been idententified with the Jumna or Yamunā. If the Vāsudeva-Kṛṣṇa worship prevailed in the time of the first Maurya, it must have originated long before the establishment of the Maurya dynasty, and my assertion that it owes its origin to the stream of thought which began with the Upaniṣads and culminated in the east in Buddhism and Jainism, and arose about the time of the latter, is confirmed.</p>
<p>The name expressive of the Supreme Spirit was, however, in the early period Vāsudeva alone. In the passage from the Niddesaand the three Inscriptions Vāsudeva is the name that occurs.</p>
<p>In the Bhagavadgītā (VII. 19 ) it is stated that &ldquo;He who possesses knowledge gives himself up to me, believing Vāsudeva to be all&rdquo; Even in the Bhāgavata Mantra of twelve syllables which is usually repeated at the present day and which is mentioned by Hemādri, it is to Vāsudeva that obeisance is made.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> p. 225. The Mantra is Orh nameBhagavate Visudevāya.&rdquo;) In Bhiṣmap.chap. 65 Brahmadeva, addressing the Supreme Spirit (Purusa Parameśvara), entreats him to become the increaser of the Yadu race, and then, referring apparently to a foregone age, he says: O Vāsudeva! this great secret I have communicated to thee through thy favour as it really is. Having created thyself as the God Saṁkarṣaṇa, thoudidst procreate thy son Pradyumna. He created Aniruddha who is Viṣṇu himself, and he created me (Brahmadeva), who am made up of Vāsudeva and created by thee. Dividing thyself in this way be born as a human being again.&rdquo; In the beginning of chapter 66 of the same Parvan, Prajāpati speaks of himself as having asked the supreme lord of all to dwell in the world of men as Vāsudeva (to become incarnate). This Supreme Spirit should, it is said,</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.Vrntakhaṇḍa (Bibl. Ind.) p. 225. The Mantra is Orh name Bhagavate Vāsudevāya.</p>
<p>be known as Vāsudeva, and throughout the chapter that name alone is used in speaking of the eternal God.</p>
<p>The substance of these two chapters seems to be that in a formar ago the Supreme Spirit Vāsudeva created Saṁkarṣaṇa and the rest up to the Brahmā himself, and on the present occasion the latter asked him again to be born in the Yadu race as Vāsudeva, dividing himself into four parts as on the previous occasion. Thus Vāsudeva was the name of the teacher of the religion of devotion, and there appears to be an implication here that he existed with the other three in a previous age. Even as a member of the Vṛṣṇirace the name Vāsudeva occurs in the examples quoted above from the Mahabhasya and Kāśika and no other.</p>
<p>In the passages quoted by me in my article¹ on &ldquo;Allusions to Kṛṣṇa etc.,&rdquo; the name Kṛṣṇa occurs three times, Vāsudeva in three passages and Janārdana in one. But in Kielhorn&rsquo;s Edition of the Mahābhāṣya, which is more accurate than the Benares edition which I then used, the reading Kṛṣṇa in two of the three places is supported by one Manuscript only and Vāsudeva occurs instead of Kṛṣṇa in one of the two places and the other is entirely omitted, so that Vāsudeva is used four times and Kṛṣṇa only once. In the Bhagavadgītā (X. 37) the Bhagavat says that of the Vṛṣṇis he is Vāsudeva.</p>
<p>In the Buddhist Ghatajātakathe two eldest sons of Upasāgara and Devagabbha are named Vāsudeva and Baladeva. In the prose narrative no other name is given, but the names Kaṇha and Keśava occur in the verses that are interwoven with the prose. The commentator remarks on the first verse that he is there addressed by his Gotra name Kapha, for he belonged to the Kaṇhāyana Gotra, thus showing his belief that Vāsudevawas the true proper name of the person. This belief he expresses again in his commentary on a verse occurring in the Mahāummaggajātaka, in which Jambāvātī is mentioned as the beloved queen of Vāsudeva Kaṇha. Here also Vāsudeva is mentioned as belonging to the Kaṇhāyana Gotra, and from the verse itself, in which Vāsudevassa Kaṇhassa occurs, it would appear, that Kaṇha<br>
___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1. Ind. Ant., Vol. III, pp. 14 ff. [This article is included in Vol. I of this Edition.—N. B. U.]</p>
<p>was the family name, the sense being Vāsudeva, the Kaṇha, so that the author of the verse itself would seem to regard Vāsudeva as the proper name of the individual, and thus he and the prose narrative agree.</p>
<p>§ 8. Thus then Vāsudeva appears to be a proper name and not a patronymic, and when the Vāsudeva religion or the Bhāgavata school took its rise, that was the name by which the Supreme. Deity was known. The conception of Vāsudeva as his father must have arisen afterwards, as appears to me from the example Vāsudevaḥ given in the Mahābhāṣya in the sense of &ldquo;son or descendant of Vāsudeva &ldquo;, and not &ldquo;of Vāsudeva&rdquo;, as must be inferred from the analogous instance of Bāladeva from Baladeva. Baladeva was associated with Vāsudeva and not with Vasudeva.</p>
<p>Kṛṣṇa, Janārdara, and Keśava do not appear to be Vṛṣṇinames and were given to Vāsudeva in subsequent times when his worship had widely spread. All these three occur in Patañjali also, but the two latter only once so far as I know. But of those the name Kṛṣṇa is more important than the other two and many others that are used. It appears to be as much a proper name as Vāsudeva, though the latter has a religious signification specially attached to it. How then did this name Kṛṣṇa come to be used ? It was the name of one of the Vedic Rṣis, the composer of hymn. 74 of the eighth Maṇḍala. He speaks of himself as Kṛṣṇa in verses 3 and 4 of the hymn. The author of the Anukramaṇī calls him an Āṅgirasa or descendant of Aṅgirasa. In the KB. (XXX. 9) apparently the same Kṛṣṇa Āṅgirasa is alluded to and is represented to have seen the evening libation in its connection with the Brāhmaṇācchaṁsin priest. Kṛṣṇa occurs in a Gaṇa attached to Pāṇini, IV. 1. 96. In the Gaṇa connected with Pāṇini IV. 1. 99 Kṛṣṇa and Raṇa are represented to form the Gotra names Kārṣṇāyana and Rāṇāyana. These were Brāhmaṇa Gotras falling under the group of Vāsiṣṭhas. The former is the Gotra alluded to by the commentator on the verses in the Jātakas noticed above. But he apparently does not confine it to the Brāhmaṇa class. Then the name Kṛṣṇa as the son of Devaki occurs In the Chāndogya Upaniṣad (III. 17). He was the pupil of Ghora, who was an Āṅgirasa. If Kṛṣṇa was also an Āṅgirasa, which is not improbable, it must be inferred that there was a tradition about Kṛṣṇa</p>
<p>as a sage from the time of the Ṛgvedic hymns to the time of the Chāndogya-Upanṣiad, and about a Gotra of the name of Kārṣṇāyana, which literally means collection of Kṛṣṇas, of which the original Kṛṣṇa was the founder. This tradition gave rise to the identification of the sage Kṛṣṇa with Vāsudeva, when he was raised to the rank of the supreme deity. Just as the name Janamejaya, the son of Parikṣit, which occurs in the AB., was in subsequent times used as the name of the person to whom the Mahābhārata was narrated, and a genealogy was given to him from Arjuna, the Pāṇḍava, so it is possible that Vāsudeva was identified with the sage Kṛṣṇa and a genealogy given to him in the Vṛṣṇi race through Śūra and Vasudevas.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best explanation of the fact of Vāsudeva having been called Kṛṣṇa is that given by the commentator of the Gāthās or verses of the Jātakas, supported, as it appears to me, by the author of the Gāthās himself, that Kṛṣṇa was a Gotra name. The Gotras Kārṣṇāyana which corresponds to Kaṇhāyanais not only mentioned as a Brāhmaṇa Gotra belonging to the Vāsiṣṭha group in the Gaṇa alluded to above, but is stated to have belonged to the Pārāśara subdivision of that group in the Matsyapurāṇa, ch. 200¹. Though this was a Brāhmaṇa and Pārāśara Gotra, it could be assumed for sacrificial purposes by a Kṣatriya, for according to Āśvalāyana (Sr. S. XII. 15) the Gotra and the ancestors invoked of the Kṣatriyas are those of their priests or chaplains, and the only Ṛṣi ancestors that all the Kṣatriyas have are Mānava, Aila and Paurūravasa. The name of these do not distinguish one Kṣatriya family from another, and, to answar the purposes of such a distinction, the Gotra and ancestors of the priest are assumed. Vāsudeva therefore belonged to the Kārṣṇāyana Gotra, though it was a Brāhmaṇa and Pārāśara Gotra, and as belonging to this Gotra he could be called Kṛṣṇa by name. Having come to be known by that name, all the traditions about the learning and spiritual insight of the old Kṛṣṇa, and also of his being the son of Devakī were engrafted on him, and thus in the Sabhāparvan 38, Bhīṣma says that one of the two reasons for giving the highest honours to Kṛṣṇa was that he possessed the knowledge of the Vedas and dependent treatises (Vedāṅgas), and that he was also a sacrificial priest (Ṛtvij). The Hindu habit of</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.Quoted also in Puruṣottama&rsquo;s Pravaramañjarī, Mysore edition.</p>
<p>thought of identifying one god with others by regarding the latter either as forms or incarnations of the former, and thus evolving monotheism out of polytheism, led to the identification of this Vāsudeva with other gods and with the boy Kṛṣṇa of Gokula. These we will notice later on.</p>
<p>§ 9. In the Nārāyaṇīyawe have an explanation of the Bhāgavata or Pāñcarātra system. This system also we will notice in its ripened form later. In the meanwhile we will turn our attention to the statement that the Ekāntika-Dharma founded by Vāsudeva has been explained in the Harīgitāand on the occasion when the armies of the Kurus and the Pāṇḍavas stood face to face and Arjuna lost heart. The allusion is of course to the Bhagavadgita.</p>
<p>This passage is noticed in the Bhaktisūtra (83) and its commentary, in which it is stated that Ekāntabhāva (which is the subject of the Nārāyaṇiya), or devotion to one only, is Bhakti alone, since the former is recognised in that passage as identical with the main topic of the Bhagavadgītā. But the Bhagavadgītā contains no allusion to the Vyūhas or forms of the Supreme, Saṁkarṣaṇa and others, while the latter form a characteristic of the Bhāgavata school. The Gitā, however, mentions as the Prakrtis of Vāsudeva the five elements, the mind, Buddhi or knowledge, and egoism as well as Jīva (VII4, 5). The last is identified with Saṁkarṣaṇa in the Bhāgavata system, egoism with Aniruddha, and mind, with which probably Buddhi is associated, with Pradyumna.</p>
<p>What appears to be the fact is this: The Bhagavadgītāwas composed before the doctrines of the Bhāgavata school were reduced to a system, and it was then that the three of the Prakṛtis of the Supreme were personified into Saṁkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha, who were members of the family of Vāsudeva. In the prevalent worship, however, Saṁkarṣaṇa alone. is found associated with Vāsudevain early times, as is seen from the Inscriptions, and the passage from the Niddesa noticed in the beginning.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> Patañjali also notices, under Pāṇini II. 2. 34, a verse in which it is stated that certain musical instruments are sounded in a gathering in the temple of Dhanapati, Rāma and Keśava.</p>
<p>Here Rāma and Keśava are Balarāma and Vāsudeva-Kṛṣṇa, and it is clear that there were festive gatherings at their temples in Patañjali&rsquo;s time. If the passage in Patañjali under Pāṇini VI. 3. 6, &ldquo;Janārdana with himself as the fourth&rdquo;, i. e., with three companions, may be taken to allude to the three Vyūhas, then it must be understood that the four Vyūhas, Vāsudeva, Saṁkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha, were known in Patañjali&rsquo;s time. Still it is doubtful, and it may be taken for granted that the two Vyūhas, Vāsudeva and Saṁkarṣaṇa, only were known up to the time of the latest Inscription which is to be referred to about the beginning of the first century before the Christian era, so that the system of four Vyūhas was not fully developed up to that time.</p>
<p>If this reasoning is correct, it will be seen that the date of the Bhagavadgītāwhich contains no mention of the Vyūhas, or personified forms, is much earlier than those of the Inscriptions, the Niddesa and Patañjali, i. e., it was composed not latter than the beginning of the fourth century before the Christian era. How much earlier it is difficult to say. At the time when the Gītāwas conceived and composed, the identification of Vāsudeva with Nārāyaṇa had not taken place, nor had his being an incarnation of Viṣṇu come to be acknowledged, as appears from the work itself. When his Virāj or universe-form was shown to Arjuna, as represented in the eleventh chapter, he is twice addressed by the latter as Viṣṇu on account of his dazzling brilliance, which rendered everything hot, and filled the whole universe. Here Viṣṇu is alluded to as the chief of the Ādityas and not as the supreme being, and Vāsudeva was Viṣṇu in this sense, as mentioned in chapter 10, because the best thing of a group or class is represented to be his Vibhūti or special manifestation.</p>
<p>§ 10. A characteristic of a new system of religion that comes into vogue is, that the followers are not satisfied with the idea, that the person known as the founder originated the system. They push back the origin by many ages. Siddhārthaka was preceded by many Buddhas, so was Mahāvīra by many Tirthaṁkaras. So in the case of the Bhāgavata school we have seen that that system was taught by Nārāyaṇa at the beginning of each Brahman, and</p>
<p>in the existing Brahman it was first taught to Pitāmaha or Prajāpati and thence it passed to Dakṣa, Vivasvat, Manu and Ikṣvāku. This last order of its revelation is alluded to at the beginning of the fourth chapter of the Gītā, which confirms the tradition noticed in the Nārāyaṇiya about the identity of the religion of the Gītāwith the Ekāntika religion revealed by Nārāyaṇa. In this respect of pushing back the origin the Bhāgavata system resembles Buddhism and Jainism.</p>
<p>V. Substance of the Bhagavadgītā.</p>
<p>§ 11. We will now pass under review the main contents of the Bhagavadītā, as from all appearances it is the earliest exposition of the Bhakti system or the Ekāntika Dharma.</p>
<p>Chapter II. Arjuna is reluctant to fight because it involves the destruction of his near and revered relatives and of other men. Bhagavat endeavours to remove the reluctance by speaking of the eternity and indestructibility of the human soul. Here are two stanzas which ocour, with a variation in one of the lines, in the Kaṭha Upaniṣad. Then to fight is spoken of as the duty of a Kṣatriya for whom there is no other good than a just fight. This mode of thinking is characterised as being Sāṁkhya, and the Yoga mode then follows.</p>
<p>The condition of mind in the Yoga mode is a determined will. Those who according to the precepts of the Veda perform rites for fulfillment of various desires, cannot have a determined steadfast will. For attaining such a will one should think only of the deed to be done and not of the fruits to be derived from it. With a concentrated mind and without any attachment to other objects one should devote oneself to the deed alone. By such devotion to acts with a determined will, man finally attains inflexibility of will becomes Sthitaprajn̄a), and all his desires being uprooted, he attains complete serenity of soul or the Brāhmīcondition. When he is in this condition at the time of death, he obtains comes to the same doctrine as that quiescence in Brahman. This stated in the Kaṭha and Bṛhadāraṇyaka-Upaniṣads, that when all desires in the heart are uprooted, the mortal becomes immortal and attains to Brahman.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> The discipline, however, prescribed for</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.Yadāsarve pramucyante kāmāỵesỵa hṛdi sritāḥ, KU, VI. 14, and also BU. IV. 4. 7.</p>
<p>the attainment of this end is not simply moral, but religious also, since it is stated that after having controlled the senses which reader the mind restless, a man should devote himself to Bhagavat.</p>
<p>§ 12. Chapter III. There are two paths, that of devotion to knowledge for the Sāṁkhyas, and that of devotion to Karman or action for the Yogins. Every one is born for a life of activity, but the deeds done do not tie him down to the world, if he does them for worship (Yajña) and not for his private purposes. No Karman is necessary for one whose enjoyments consist in himself, who is satisfied with himself and contented in himself. But for other people action is necessary, and it must be done without any selfish desire. Janaka and others obtained perfection by devoting themselves to actions alone, i. e., by the pursuit of an active life. But the action should be dedicated to the Supreme, and one should not seek any fruit for himself. But such a frame of mind is not attainable by ordinary men, who are under the influence of their physical nature and sensual passions.</p>
<p>Then a question is asked what it is that prompts man to sin. The reply is that it is desire and anger which are all-powerful and envelop a man&rsquo;s spiritual existence. Desire acts through the senses, but intelligence is superior to the senses, and superior to this latter is the will (Buddhi) and the soul is superior to Buddhi. Knowing oneself to be higher than Buddhi, one should curb oneself by efforts and kill desire which acts through the series, viz., senses, intellect, will. Here the superiority of one faculty over another is an idea borrowed from the Kaṭha-Upaniṣad. In connection with the teaching that action should be done disinterestedly, Bhagavat makes the closest possible approach to the Sāṁkhya doctrine that the soul being deluded by egoism (Ahaṁkāra) regards himself as the agent of the actions done by the qualities of nature (Prakṛti), and that, misled by the qualities of nature, he forms an attachment to the qualities and actions..</p>
<p>§ 13. Chapter IV. The chapter begins with Bhagavat&rsquo;s mention of his communication of this system to Vivasvat in the first instance, as alluded to above.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> Incidentally the question of his ex</p>
<p>istence at the time of Vivasvat comes up, and he then explains hisbeing born again and again, and assuming incarnations for the destruction of the wicked by means of his Prakṛti. They who know the incarnations and the celestial deeds of Bhagavat, are released from the body and are not born again. By means of knowledge, men, being purified and their passions destroyed, and being devoted to him and resorting to him and resting on him, attained to the condition of Bhagavat. Bhagavat resorts to men in the manner in which they resort to him; men everywhere follow his path.</p>
<p>The idea of action without attachment is further developed. The metaphorical Yajñas are mentioned, such as the sacrifice of the senses into the fire of restraint, of the objects of the senses into the senses, of the operation of the senses and of the vital breaths into the fire of Yoga, which is the control of the self. All these Yajñas cannot be accomplished without acts. Of these the Yajñas of knowledge is the best for by its means one sees all things in one-self and in God (Supreme spirit). This highest knowledge brings about freedom from all sin, and destroys the polluting effect of action. The realisation of the Yoga sets aside the significance of the actions. This highest knowledge puts an end to all doubt and one becomes a spirit-a spirit totally free. When acts are done in this condition, they do not defile a person. Here the tendency to rationalise Yajñas or sacrifices, which set in in the Upanṣiad period, is seen in a developed form, since the restraint of the senses, the attainmeut of knowledge, and such other practices are characterised as Yajñas or sacrifices.</p>
<p>Another point that deserves notice is the statement that Bhagavat deals with men in the manner in which they deal with him, that is, the spirit with which God is approached by men is reciprocated by God. This is followed by the affirmation that men everywhere, whatever the differences of their views, follow the path of Bhagavat. Here lies, in germ, the principle that all religions have a basis of truth in them.</p>
<p>§ 14. Chapter V. Sāṁkhya and Yoga are brought into connection with Saṁnyāsa and Karmayoga. They are not independent of each other. Following either thoroughly, one obtains the fruit of both. The place which is obtained bp Sāṁkhyas is obtained also</p>
<p>by Yogas. For Jñānayajña or sacrifice of knowledge enabling a man to see all things in himself and in God, and this knowledge bringing about freedom from sin, the same condition is attained to, which an active life or pursuit of actions (Karmayoga) brings about, when the actions are done disinterestedly or without aiming at the fruit, with an eye directed towards Brahman only, the true essence of things. Though this is so, still Saṁnyāsa is difficult to be realised without Yoga. With Yoga one attains to it soon. A Yogin does not think that he does something when he sees, hears, cats, sleeps, etc. This is so when these acts are done without any attachment, the aim being the realisation of Brahman. The Yogins perform deeds by their body, mind, will, or simply by their senses, without any attachment for the sake of spiritual purification. By means of Yoga, Jñāna is obtained, and in this condition man looks at all things alike. When a man looks at all things with the same regard, what he aims at is the Brahman and in it he rests. This leads to the consideration of the final peaca in Brahman and the method of attaining it. This pesce in Brahman resembles the condition of an Arbat in Buddhism, but the Bhagavadītādoes not end there and adds that in this condition of deliverance a person comes to know the Supreme Soul as one to whom all kinds of worship and austere practices are directed as the lord of all worlds and the friend of all beings; and it is this knowledge that leads to peace.</p>
<p>§ 15. Chapter VI. He who does not attach himself to the result of his actions and does what he ought to do, is Samnyásin as well as Yogin. Karman or action is necessary to become a sage. (Muni). When he has attained the dignity of a sage, the essence of it is peace. Then follows a description of the state of a man who has attained Yoga. Practice of Yoga, or contemplation, is then described. When a man goes through the Yoga practices, he attains serenity in Bhagavat, i. e., becomes absorbed in him in peace. All the functions of the mind are suspended in the condition of Yoga. Seeing himself by himself he rests in himself.</p>
<p>Then follows an explanation of the process of abstraction and concentration. A Yogin sees himself in all things and all things in himself, looks at all things in the same light. The Supreme Spirit is not lost to him who sees Him everywhere and sees everything in</p>
<p>Him, the Supreme Spirit. He who looks upon the Bhagavat as one, though he exists in all things, exists in him, though he moves about everywhere. He who regards all as himself (and looks upon them in the same light) in matters of happiness and misery is the best Yogin. Then Arjuna remarks on the difficulty of this Yoga &ldquo;The mind&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;is restless&rdquo;. But Bhagavat replies that it can be controlled by practice as well as by reflection on the vanity of things (Vairāgya ). At the end Bhagavat teaches that he is the greatest Yogin, who, having faith in him, adores him with his whole soul centred in him.</p>
<p>The Yoga described in this chapter is found in some of the Upanṣiads, especially in the Svetaśvatara. The affirmation &ldquo;sees himself in himself and everywhere else&rdquo; occurs in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka (IV. 4. 23). The author winds up the chapter with a verse which is in every sense theistic, as he does the fifth chapter, in order, it would appear, that the description of the mental discipline contained in the last chapter, and of Yoga in this, might not lead to non-theistic conclusions. Care is taken to bring the whole into connection with the Supreme Soul.</p>
<p>§ 16. Chapter VII. In the last six chapters has been explained the whole process of Karmayoga from beginning to act regardless of the fruit, to the attainment of the condition of Yogin, who acting solely with a view to the acquisition of the Brahma condition, is free from passions, looks upon all things alike; and it is added at the end that he is the best of the Yogins, who adores Bhagavat with faith and with a devoted heart. This is added to show that the processes up to the attainment of the Yoga condition, are difficult to be practised by men with such passions as we possess, and the way to be free from them is to surrender oneself to God; and therefore in this chapter Bhagavat goes on to explain the nature of created beings and of his relation to them. He begins by saying that God&rsquo;s Prakṛti is eightfold: the five elements, mind, will (Buddhi), and egoism. Jīva is another Prakṛti, which supports the world. From these are produced all objects or beings. Bhagavat is the source and the last resting place of the world. There is nothing further than him. All these things are strung together in him as gems in á string. That which is the characteristic excellence of a thing is Bhagavat himself. All</p>
<p>the three qualities and the conditions resulting from them proceed from him. Bhagavat is not in them and they are not in him. Bhagavat is beyond all these three conditions. The world, deluded by the conditions resulting from the three qualities, does not know Bhagavat, the Supreme Spirit, who is beyond them all. This Māyāof Bhagavat consisting of these qualities is very difficult to be got over, and this Māyā they get rid of, who take refuge in him. Wicked men do not resort to Bhagavat, their understanding being clouded by Māyā and resorting to Āsura or demoniacal condition.</p>
<p>The devotees of Bhagavat are of four kinds. Of these the Jñānin, or the enlightened, is the best. The Jñānin sticks to Bhagavat as his best refuge. The enlightened man surrenders himself to him, regarding Vāsudeva as everything. Other people ture attached to other deities and undertake different vows faith in their deities is generated by Bhagavat and strengthened by him. They worship those deities with that faith and attain fruit. That fruit is yielded by Bhagavat himself. But it is perishable. Not knowing Bhagavat&rsquo;s true nature, which is unchangeable and excellent, ignorant people regard him as something indiscrete at first and afterwards made discrete. He is not intelligible to all beings, being enveloped in Yogamāyā (mystic power). He knows the past, the present and the future, and nobody knows him. By likes and dislikes all beings are deluded, and those only, who are released from the infatuation of likes and dislikes, with their sins being destroyed by the practice of virtue, adore the Supreme. Those who know Bhagavat to be Adhiyajña (presiding over worship) and Adhibhūta (presiding over beings), come to know him when they depart this life.</p>
<p>For the idea of all existing things being strung together in the Supreme, we may compare MU. II. 2.5, and BU. III. 8. 3-4; 6-7. Ordinary people are represented as resorting to other deities, led by several desires. The Bhagavat confirms their faith in their deities, and the fruits that they get from them are perishable. Here appears the same idea as that noticed in chap. IV and to be noticed in chap. IX, viz, that the worshippers of other gods are really Bhagavat&rsquo;s worshippers, and that there is a principle of unity in all religions.</p>
<p>§ 17. Chapter VIII.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> Arjuna begins by putting questions about the three subjects mentioned in the last verse of the last chapter, and about Brahman and Adhyātma. Bhagavat then explains these. About perceiving him at the time of death he says: &ldquo;He who leaves his body while remembering me at the time of death, attains to the same condition as mine.&rdquo; Finally he states that he who departs this life, while meditating on the all-knowing, eternal ruler, who is smaller than the smallest thing, who is the protector of all, whose form is unthinkable, whose brilliance is like that of the sun, and who is beyond all darkness—with devotion, his whole soul gathered between the brows with the power of concentration, reaches that Supreme Being, who is higher than the highest. He then mentions the attainment of the Unchangeable, with the mind concentrated, and the reaching of the final goal after leaving the body by means of a Yoga process and by the utterance of the syllable &lsquo;Om&rsquo; and the remembrance of Bhagavat all the while. Bhagavat is easily attainable by one who meditates on him with asingleness of mind and is devoted to him. Every being is subject to transmigration, but is free from it when he reaches Bhagavat.</p>
<p>During the night of Brahman all these things are resolved into the indiscrate (Avyakta), and, when the day dawns; they spring out again from it. There is another substance, different from the Avyakta and itself indiscrate (Avyakta), which is not destroyed when all others are destroyed. This substance which is indiscrete, is unchangeable and that is the highest resting place, which being attained to, there is no return. That is Bhagavat&rsquo;s highest abode. Thatsuprame soul, in whom all these beings are and who has spread out all this, is to he attained by single-minded devotion. Then he proceeds to mention the two paths. Those who die while the sun is in his northern course (Uttarāyaṇa) go to Brahman, and those who die while he is in his southern course (Dakṣināyana) go to the orb of the moon, from which the soul returns.</p>
<p>It is worthy of observation that after mentioning that the man who meditates on the Supreme at the time of death reaches him, he mentions the attain nent of the Akṣara, which is the highest</p>
<p>goal, by resorting to a Yoga process. This seems to be like looking back on the Yoga practices for the attainment of the Akṣara (Brahman) mentioned in the Upanṣiads, such as the Muṇḍaka (II. 2. 3), and the Śvetāśvatara ( I. 14). In the first passage, the syllable &lsquo;Om&rsquo; is compared to a bow, the soul to the arrow, and Brahman to the target which is to be hit. In the second a person is instructed to use his own body as the nether wooden piece and the Praṇava as the upper one, and, practising meditations, which is like rubbing of the wooden pieces against each other, to discover the God hidden like Agni in the pieces of wood. Here the Akṣara Brahman of the Muṇḍaka is transformed into Deva (God) in the Śvetāśvatara-Upanṣiad, and the Bhagavadgītā also prescribes the meditating on Bhagavat while the syllable &lsquo;Om&rsquo; is heing uttered. Here, therefore, we see the effort to invest the unchangeable and indiscrete Brahman with a strong distinct personality. Later on in the chapter, another Avyakta is mentioned, besides that into which all things are resolved at the dissolution of the universe. This Avyakta is eternal and indestructible and is called Akṣara and the highest goal. Here, however, this Aksara is at once rendered theistio by being spoken of as the highest abode or condition of Bhagavat</p>
<p>§ 18. Chapter IX. In this chapter Bhagavat proceeds to explain the direct and indirect knowledge which constitute the royal lore and the royal secret. It is to be directly perceived. It is holy and easy to be practised. The Bhagavat spread out all this universe. All things are in him and he is not in them, and still the objects are not in him. Wonderful is his lordly power. He is the sustainer of all beings and is not in them. His self brings all things into existence. As the air which exists in the sky is everywhere, so all beings are in him. At the dissolution of the world all beings are dissolved into his Prakṛti, and at the beginning of a new Kalps they are discharged forth again. All these acts do not contaminate him, as he does them without any desire. With himself as the director, the Prakṛti brings forth the moveable and immoveable things. Foolish men disregard him who has assumed a human form, not knowing his true nature, viz., that he is the lord and the great ruler of all; but great souls, assuming a godly nature, knowing him to be the origin of all beings, adore him</p>
<p>with single-mindedness. Some people worship him by Jñānayajñai. e., a rationalised sacrifice, taking him as one or several, or as having his face in all directions.</p>
<p>He is a subsidiary as well as the main sacrifice. He is Svadhā, herbs, Mantra, ghee. He is Agni and he is also oblation. He is father, mother, nourisher and grandfather of the world. He is Rc, Sāman, etc. He is the way, sustainer, lord, witness, shelter and friends etc. The knowers of the three Vedas, the drinkers of Soma, worshipping him by means of sacrifice, desire habitation in heaven, where they enjoy many pleasures. After their merit has been exhausted, they come back to the mortal world again. Those who thus follow the ritual of the three Vedas come and go. He looks after the welfare of those who think of him and meditate on him with single-mindedness and adore him. Those who worship. other deities must be considered as worshipping him, but they do so not according to prescribed rules. He is the receiver and lord of all kinds of Yajñas or worship, but those people do not know him as he really is, and therefore they fail. Those who worship other deities attain to them, and his worshippers attain to him. All the oblations thrown into the fire, all that is eaten and given and the austerities practised should be dedicated to him. In this way these actions do not serve as a bondage, and one becomes a real Saṁnyāsin and goes to him. He who adores Bhagavat with single-mindedness, becomes holy, even if he be wicked. He becomes immediately holy and obtains peace. Even women, Vaiśyas and Śūdras, when they resort to him, attain to the highest place. The seeker of the good should direct his mind towards him, should be his devotee, should worship him, should how to him, and acting in this way, and being thus fully devoted to him, he will reach him..</p>
<p>Here the performance of sacrificial rites is, in the manner which has become usual, mentioned as efficacious for the acquisition of a place in heaven. From this place persons return when their merit is exhausted, but there is no return when a man devotes himself to Bhagavat with all his heart. God is further personalised and brought home to man by being declared as his father, mother, nourisher, grandfather, friend, refuge, etc. The attitude to other gods is of toleration. The worship offered to</p>
<p>them is really offered to Bhagavat, but the worshippers do not know Bhagavat as he truly is, and therefore go wrong.</p>
<p>§ 19. Chapter X. The gods and Rṣis do not know the origin of Bhagavat. He was before them all. He who knows Bhagavat to be the unborn and unleginning lord of all worlds, is free from all sins. All the mental conditions, knowledge, absence of ignorance, forgiveness, truth, self-control, serenity, pain and pleasure, etc., are from him. The seven ancient Maharṣis and four Manus sprang from him, whose descendants are all these men. Good men adore Bhagavat with pure faith, knowing him to be the origin of all and that everything is set in motion by him. They, with their minds directed towards him, with their souls centred in him, enlighten each other, speak about him, and thus they are satisfied and are happy. Out of sympathy for them he dispels the darkness of ignorance by the light of knowledge, being himself in his true condition. When they adore him thus constantly full of love, he grants them that condition of mind by means of which they reach him.</p>
<p>Then questioned by Arjuna as to the Vibhūtis or excellent forms of each species or group, which pervade the world, Bhagavat proceeds to mention them. He is the soul that dwells in the heart of men and is the origin, the middle and the end of all beings. He is VViṣṇu of the Ādityas, the sun of all shining things, Kapila of the Siddhas, Prahlāda of all Daityas, Rāma of wielders of weapons, philosopoy (Adhyātma) of all lores, Dvandva of compounds, Kirti (fame) of all females, Vāsudeva of Vṛṣṇis and Dhanaṁjaya of Pāṇḍavas. That object which has excellence and splendour should be known as arising from his lustre.</p>
<p>There is to be observed here one special characteristic of the Bhakti school, and that is that all the devotees meet together, enlighten each other as to the nature of God, and contribute by discourses on him to each other&rsquo;s elevation and gratification. This is almost a characteristic mark of Bhaktas as distinguished from the Yogins, who have to go through their exercises singly and in solitute.</p>
<p>§20. Chapter XI. The Virāj form of God, i. e., all being looked at simultaneously as constituting one whole, as also his destructive</p>
<p>form, in which all enter into his mouth and are absorbed, is described in this chapter. Arjuna praises him that he does not see the end, the beginning, the middle of him, that he is the guardian of eternal righteousness and entreats him to give up this frightful form and assume the more usual and the more agreeable human form. In verse 30, Arjuna addresses him as Viṣṇu saying that his dazzling brilliance makes everything hot and his lustre has filled the whole universe.</p>
<p>The idea of looking at the universe as a form of god is as old as the Puruṣasūkta (RV. X. 90). God&rsquo;s having eyes everywhere, face everywhere, arms everywhere and the feet everywhere is expressed in RV. X. 81. 3. This verse is repeated in Śvetāśvatara-Upanṣiad III. 3.</p>
<p>§ 21. Chapter XII. This chapter starts with a question as to the difference between the contemplation on the original indiscrete cause which is unchangeable (Akṣara ), and the worship of him (Vāsudeva ), and the reply is, they are the best devotees, who, fixing their minds upon him, meditate on him with a concentrated attention and faith. Those who, with their senses restrained, meditate on the Indiscrete, Unchangeable, Undefinable, as existing everywhere and unthinkable, also reach him, but the trouble to them is greater. Bhagavat delivers from the ocean of death those, who, dedicating all their actions to him and meditating on him, worship him; and he teaches Arjuna to fix his mind on him and concentrate his will on him, and, if he cannot fix his mind firmly upon him, then to endeavour to obtain him by continued remembrance of him. If this last is not feasible, he should perform deeds for his sake, and doing this he would obtain success. If, however, he is not able to do this, with his mind fixed on him, he should abandon desire for the fruit of all his actions. Then follows an enumeration of the virtues of those who are devotees of God and are specially dear to him, such as not hating any being, being the friend of all, being humble, being indifferent to praise or censure, etc.</p>
<p>In this chapter the meditation on the Akṣara or unchangeable indiscrete cause is again mentioned as opposed to the worship of Bhagavat as a personal God. In similar passages in the previous chapters, the personalisation is effected at once by inserting a</p>
<p>clause applicable only to a personal God. But here the meditation on Avyakta is spoken of as successful, but is condemned as being very difficult to be practised, and the theistic aim of the work is kept in view.</p>
<p>§ 22. Chapter XIII. This body is the Kṣetra, and he who knows this body as his own, is Kṣetrajña. The Bhagavat is also Kṣetrajña in all the Kṣetras. This subject about the Kṣetra and Kṣetrajña has been variously treated by the Rṣis in verses of various metres, and determined by the words of the Brahmasūtra unfolding reasong Kṣetra consists of the twenty-four elements mentioned in the Sāṁkhya system and desire, hatred, pleasure and pain, and body, life and courage, which are Ātmaguṇas according to the Vaiśeṣikas. Bhagavat then proceeds to enumerate the virtues, such as humility, sincerity, etc., which consistute, it is said, Jñāna or knowledge, but which are to be taken as means to knowledge. Then arealluded to knowledge, or true philosophy, and its roverse. Нe then mentions the Jñeya, or thing to be known, and it is Parabrahman, which has no beginning nor end, which is neither existent nor non-existent, and which has hands and feet everywhere, and which has eyes, head and face everywhere, which has ears everywhere, and which pervades all. And thus the description of godhead proceeds in the words of the Upanṣiads.</p>
<p>Prakṛti and Puruṣa are unbeginning. All changes and qualities are produced from Prakṛti. Prakṛti is the cause in bringing about effect, and Puruṣa is the cause in the enjoyment and sufferance of happiness and misery. The Puruṣa, being connected with Prakṛti, enjoys or endures the properties or effects of the Prakṛti; and the cause is his being connected with the Guṇas or qualities. Besides all these various principles, there is in this body Puruṣa, the Supreme Soul, who is the witness of everything, who is the sustainer, enjoyer and the great lord. By meditation some see the self by self, others see it by Sāṁkhyayoga and Karmayoga. Any moving or unmoving thing that comes into existence is produced by the union of Kṣetra and Kṣetrajña. He, who sees the Supreme Lord equally in all things, who is not destroyed when other things are destroyed, sees truly. Seeing God equally in all things, a man does no injury to himself, and attains to the highest goal. He truly sees, who sees all acts as done by Prakṛti</p>
<p>and Puruṣa as not the actor. When he regards all seperate beings. as existing in one place, and sees development proceeding thence, he becomes Brahman. The Supreme Spirit, though dwelling in the body, does not do anything and is not contaminated, because he is unbeginning and is devoid of qualities and unchangeable. The spirit is not contaminated, just as space or ether existing. everywhere is not. Just as the sun illuminates the whole world, so does the Kṣetrajñailluminate the Kṣetra.</p>
<p>The Karmayoga, leading up to the condition of a Yogin, who looks at all things with the same regard and makes no distinction. between them and himself, has been described in the first six chapters. In the next six the Bhaktiyoga, or loving adoration of God, is the subject treated of; and the final effect of it is the formation of the fully righteous character which distinguishes aBhakta who is dear to Bhagavat. With chapter XIII begins the consideration of subsidiary subjects. In this Bhagavat speaks of the Kṣetra and Kṣetrajña, or the soul and its dwelling place, and of another soul, that is, himself also dwelling in the Kṣetra. In connection with this subject he refers to the poetic works of the previous Rsis and to the words of the Brahmasūtra.</p>
<p>What these works are it is difficult to say; but what follows is, first, the mention of the twenty-four principles generally associated with the Sāṁkhyasystem, as well as seven others, all of which constitute the Kṣetra; secondly, the enumeration of the virtues. that qualify one to the attainment of knowledge: thirdly, the statement about knowledge (Jñāna), or that which is true philosophy, and also Ajñāna, which is the reverse; and fourthly, the description of the Jñeya or the thing to be known, which is Parabrahman or the Supreme Soul. This last contains the attributes given in the Upaniṣads, and a verse and a half are verbally quoted from the SU. There are also other statements in the concluding verses which resemble KU. V. 11, and ŚU, V. 4. Then there is a statement about the nature of the Prakṛti and Puruṣaquite in keeping with the Sāṁkhyasystem; but the existence of the highest spirit in the body along with the animal soul is mentioned. Thus is the atheism of the Sāṁkhyasystem studiously avoided, whenever there is a reference to its doctrines. Then</p>
<p>follow reflections on God and the seeing of the Supreme Soul everywhere.</p>
<p>The works, therefore, upon which this chapter is based are some of the Upaniṣads and some treatises setting forth the constitution of the world and the principles of morality. These treatises may have been the discourses first independent and afterwards included in the Śāntiparvan and other parts of the Mahābhārata, or they may have been others of which we have no trace; but there is no mention here of the Sāṁkhya system by name nor a special reference to it as elaborated in later times by Īśvarakṛṣṇa. The idea of the twenty-four principles is ancient and seems to have been appropriated afterwards by the founders. of the philosophic systems, as it suited their purpose. But no chronological conclusions can be deduced from the mention of those twenty-four principles. The doctrine that all action proceeds from the Prakṛti, and the soul is inactive and simply enjoys or suffers, which is a true Sāṁkhya doctrine, but is calculated. to absolve a man from moral responsibility, is also mentioned; but it appears to come incidentally along with the twenty-four principles.</p>
<p>§ 23. Chapter XIV. The great Brahman is the womb (Yoni) for Bhagavat into which he throws seed. Of all the wombs that produce bodily forms, Brahman is the greatest. Bhagavat then proceeds to detail the nature of the three Guṇas, their products and their results in the future world. These Guṇas prove as bondage, and when they are got over, then the man is free from the bondage. and becomes immortal. The distinguishing characteristic of one who is free from these three Guṇas is a quiet undisturbed serene mood, in which happiness and misery are alike, and gold, olod of earth and stone are alike, in which agreeable and disagreeable. things are alike, and praise and censure are also alike, etc. He who invariably resorts to Bhagavatby Bhaktiyoga becomes free from these three Guṇas and attains to the condition of Brahman.Bhagavat is the support of the immortal and unchanging Brahman and of eternal righteousness (duty) and of unending happiness.</p>
<p>Here then is a distinct affirmation of the soul&rsquo;s attainment of freedom from passions by means of continuous devotion to Bhaga</p>
<p>vat or God. The word Brahmayoni occurs in MU. III. 1. 3, and is to be interpreted, in the light of the opening statement in the above, as one whose Yoni is Brahman.</p>
<p>§ 24. Chapter XV. Bhagavat proceeds to the comparison of Saṁsāra, or the whole extent of things, to the Pippal-tree. This tree is to be cut by the weapon of indifference or non-attachment; and then should be sought that place from which there is no return. One should surrender himself to the original Puruṣa. Those reach that unchanging position or place, who are free from pride, ignorance, desires, and the pair of happiness and misery. That is the highest abode of Bhagavat, which is not illuminated by the sun, the moon or the fire. When a soul departs from a body, it takes away the Indriyas, of which Manas is the sixth, and brings them in when it assumes another body. The soul itself is a part of Bhagavat and is eternal. This soul, placing itself in these six Indriyas, resorts to all objects of sense. The brilliance. existing in the sun, which illumines the whole world, and which exists in the moon as well as in fire, is to be known as that of Bhagavat. By becoming Soma, Bhagavat raises all herbs. By becoming fire be contributes to digestion. He dwells in the heart. of all. From him proceeds consciousness of one&rsquo;s condition, knowledge, and the rejection of what is not true. Bhagavat alone is to be known by means of all the Vedas and as the author of Vedāntas and the knower of the Veds. There are two souls in the world, one that changes, and the other that is unchangeable. Besides these. there is another who is the highest and is called Paramātman, and who as the unchangeable lord supports all the three worlds after entering into them. Bhagavat is known to be that Highest Soul in the ordinary world and also in the Vedas.</p>
<p>There is one new point brought out in this chapter. And that is that the animal soul goes out of the body along with the six senses and enters new ones in that condition.The comparison of the composite universe to the Pippal-tree ocours in KU. (VI.1), MaiU. (VI. 4), and the non-illumination of the highest abode of Bhagavat is mentioned in a verse in KU. (V. 15), MU, (II. 2. 10), and SU. (VI. 14). The doctrine of the existence of the third highest Puruṣa should also be noted as a characteristic of this theistic work. The triad, Kṣara, Akṣara or Ātman (individual</p>
<p>soul), and the ruling one God, is mentioned in SU. (I. 10), which work is a precursor of the Bhagavadgītā.</p>
<p>§ 25. Chapter XVI. Bhagavat now proceeds to enumerate the virtues which constitute the divine endowments (DaivīSaṁpad), and the vices that constitute demoniacal possessions. From divine. endowments results final deliverance, and from the demoniacal possessions, follows destruction. There are two classes of created beings: one is divine and the other demoniacal. In persons of the latter class there is no purity nor correct conduct nor truth. They regard the world as unreal, without substratum or support, without God, disconnected and what more, springing from lust. Holding this view these wicked and dull persons with their ferocious deeds bring about the destruction of the world. Full of insatiable lust and possessed of vanity, pride, and arrogance, they act in an un holy manner, sticking to their own false conceits. They accumulate wealth by foul means for enjoyment and boasting of their possessions, their power, their parentage, they treat others with contempt and eventually go to the infernal regions. If they worship at all, they simply utter the name and assume a false garb. They are full of egotism and hate Bhagavat, as abiding in their own bodies and those of others. These wicked men he consigns to the race of the demons. Desire, anger and covetousness. are the three doors to hell. These three, therefore, should be abandoned. He who avoids these three doors reaches the highest goal. He who abandons sacred precepts and acts according. to his own will, does not obtain success, happiness or the highest goal. The sacred precepts must, therefore, be followed whenever a man has to do anything or avoid anything.</p>
<p>Here two classes of men, good and bad, are mentioned. Among the latter are included not only worldly men who do not care for God or morality, but the followers of philosophical or religious systems, different from that of Bhagavat seem also to be included. They set aside the sacred Śāstra or precepts, denied God, as Buddhists and Jainas did, and regarded the world as unsubstantial or unreal, as the former did.</p>
<p>§ 26. Chapter XVII. Arjuna asks: &ldquo;What is the frame of mind of those who set aside the sacred precepts and still worship</p>
<p>with faith? Is it characterised by the quality of goodness, activity or ignorance?&rdquo; Bhagavat answers: &ldquo;Faith is of three kinds, characterised by goodness, activity, and darkness or ignorance. The faith of a man depends upon the quality of his heart. A man is what faith makes of him. As is his faith, so is the man&rdquo;. The good worship gods, the active, Yakṣas and Rakṣases or evil spirits, and the ignorant, ghosts and spectres. Men of demoniacal frame of mind perform terrible ansterities full of ostentation and egotism, and cause attenuation of the elements composing the body and of the Bhagavat who dwells in it. He then mentions three kinds of food, modes of worship, austerities and gifts, in keeping with the threo qualities. For instance, in the case of worship or sacrifice, that is in keeping with the quality of goodness, which is performed without any regard for the fruit and in accordance with the sacred ritual. That springs from the quality of activity, which is done for the attainment of fruit and out of ostentation; and that which is done without regard for the sacred precepts and without Dakṣiṇāor rewards to the priest and without any faith, proceeds from the quality of ignorance. As to charitable gifts, those spring from the quality of goodness, which are made because it is a duty to give to one from whom no return is expected; while that which is made with an interested motive and with a desire for return, springs from the quality of activity. And in this manner all the four subjects are treated. At the end the doing of good acts by is mentioned. the repetition of the syllables &ldquo;Om, tat, sat&rdquo; is mentioned.</p>
<p>In this chapter the truth that man&rsquo;s religious faith and the character of the God that he worships, depend upon his own character whether good or bad, is clearly recognised. Not only the nature of the God worshipped, but also the diet, the mode of worship, charity or gifts, and the practice of austerity differ according as a man&rsquo;s nature is influenced by one or other of the three qualities, goodness, activity, and ignorance.</p>
<p>§ 27.Chapter XVIII. This chapter begins with a question by Arjuna as to the principles of renunciation and abandonment. Bhagavat replies that renunciation is the giving up of works springing from desires, and abandonment is the abandonment of fruits of actions. Some say that all Karmian should be abandond; others say that worship, charity and austerity should not be given</p>
<p>up. The decision is that these last should not be abandoned, as they bring about purity of the soul.The actions should be done. without being attached to them or desiring for the fruits. That duty that must be done, should not be abandoned. Giving up. that duty is an ignorant deed. When action is avoided because it is wearisome, its abandonment springs from the quality of passion. When the essential action is done because it should be done without any desire for fruit or attachment, that abandonment springs from goodness. It is not possible for a living being. to abandon all actions. He who abandons only the fruit, is really. one who has abandoned actions. According to the Sāṁkhya doctrine, there are five different causes: the resting place, agent, instrument, varied movements and fate. In this manner it goes on, Some acts or states of mind are represented to vary according. to the three qualities, such as knowledge, the deed done and the doer, Buddhi or will, firmness and happiness, and the duties of the different castes.</p>
<p>The man who worships Him, from whom all beings have sprung and who has spread out all this, by doing the duties assigned to him, for which the three qualities have fitted him, attains final success. He then proceeds to mention all those virtues and other states of mind, such as self-control, freedom and passions, which conduce to the realisation of the Brahma-condition. When this condition is realised, a man is free from sorrow and desire, and, being equally disposed towards all beings, he develops in himself the highest love for Bhagavat, and knowing Bhagavat fully and truly,enters into the Bhagavat. One should do all acts, intent only upon God, and then one obtains the eternal place by the favour of God. A man should fix his mind upon Bhagavat alone, dedicating all his actions to him, and then he gets over all evils by the grace of Bhagavat.</p>
<p>Then Bhagavat winds up the whole by teaching Arjuna to surrender himself with all his heart to God (the Ruler), who abides in the hearts of all things and moves them, as if forming parts of a wheel; and then he says, by his favour Arjuna would obtain perfect peace and an eternal resting-place. He is further instructed to dedicate his whole mind to Bhagavat, to become</p>
<p>his devotee, to worship him, to bow to him, and in this way he (Arjuns) would reach him. This is styled the deepest secret. Then Arjuna is told to set aside all other methods of salvation and surrender himself to Bhagavat alone, and Bhagavat would then. free him from all his sins. And thus the chapter ends.</p>
<p>This is the Ekāntika Dharms or monotheistic religion, which,as the Nārāyaṇīya tells us, was communicated to Arjuna. The method of salvation here revealed is to lead a life of action, but the fruit of the action one should not be intent on. The action should be done disinterestedly, that is, a man should be selfless in doing it. The action should be dedicated to Brahman, that is, it should be done because the Universal Order requires it to be done. This is tantamount to saying that one should do one&rsquo;s duty. because it is a duty. When a more personel interpretation is given to it, the doctrine comes to this, that one should act with the sole object of carrying out God&rsquo;s will. The frame of mind. that is generated by consistently acting in this manner, is free- dom from passion, a sense of the omnipresence of God and an equal regard for all things. This leads to the realisation of the highest love of God, and, knowing Bhagavat thoroughly, by this means a man is absorbed in him.</p>
<p>But to do one&rsquo;s duty consistently and selflessly is a matter difficult, since all beings are subject to the influence of the three. qualities or, in our modern phraseology, of passions and appetencies.These can be got over by surrendering oneself to God.</p>
<p>VI. The Sources of the Religion of the Bhagavadgītā.</p>
<p>§ 28. This constant insistence on action being done without any regard for the fruit, that is, distinterestedly or selflessly. forms &amp; peculiarity of the Bhagavadgītā. But the idea is not new. In the Īśopaniṣad it is stated in the second verse, that a man should desire to live a hundred years doing actions resolutely. and in that way and no other, will action not contaminate him. And the non-contamination as the result of an elevated state of mind is spoken of in ChU. IV. 14. 3; BU. 4. 23; and MaiU. VI. 20.</p>
<p>The attributes of the Supreme Being the Gītādraws from the Upaniṣads, as has been already shown in the remarks on the different chapters. While the personality of God is fully acknowledged in certain parts of the Upaniṣads, mere Brahman, the personality of which is not so distinct, is also spoken of in some places. When the Bhagavadgītātakes in these passages, it takes care to distinctly personalise the Akṣara or Brahman, as we have. shown. The source from which the Gītā derives its doctrines about the conquest of the self and the attainment of a condition of a peace and serenity, is the general atmosphere of religious and moral sentiment, that came to prevail from the beginning of the earliest Upaniṣad speculations to the formation of definite roligious systems,orthodox and heterodox.Consequently, though the Gītā speaks of the Brahma-Nirvāṇa, it ought not to be supposed that it borrows this doctrine of final peace and serenity from Buddhism. The source resorted to by these systems was commonto all.</p>
<p>Besides the Upaniṣads and the religious and moral atmosphere. prevalent at that time, the Gītā avails itself of the philosophy that. had come into existence in early times. This is the philosophy. of the Sāṁkhya and the Yoga. Though the twenty-four principles. of the former system, together with the Puruṣa or soul as the twenty-fifth, as known in later times, and the doctrine of the activity of the Prakṛti only and the non-activity of Puruṣa, aro alluded to in the Bhagavadgītā, still it adds another soul called the Uttama Puruṣa or the Supreme Soul, which is not found in the later Sāṁkhya, thus giving a theistic character to the philosophy. In their account of the creation, the Puraṇas follow this philosophy, and the later Vaiṣṇava and Śaivasystems adopt it in a more or less qualified manner.</p>
<p>But the word Sāṁkhya does not seem to be used in the Bhagavadgītā to indicate the later non-theistic system. In the second chapter and in the fifth, Sāṁkhya indicates &amp; philosophy based upon knowledge, and Yogs, one based on action. Again the five causes, that are alluded in the last chapter as mentioned in the Sāṁkhya system, do not appear to be known. to the later Sāṁkhya. The speculative philosophy, therefore, that existed about the time of the Śvetāśvatara-Upaniṣad and the Bhagavadgītā, was known by the name of Sāṁkhya, and out. of it grew the non-theistic system of later times. The Yoga,</p>
<p>the philosophy of action, too did prevail, but it culminated, as indicated before, into a concentration of mind, the ordinary operation being suspended, on the Brahman, Akṣara, or the Supreme Soul.</p>
<p>§ 29. Thus the Bhagavadgītāis the result of development of the religious and philosophic speculation that prevailed before the rise of Buddhism. But the origin of the idea of Bhakti, or love. of God, which is the characteristic of the work, has formed the subject of a great deal of speculation in modern times, and to this point we will now turn. In the Upaniṣads, Upāsanã, or fervent meditation of a number of things such as Manas (mind), the sun, the Puruṣa in the sun or the moon, food, vital breath, etc., regarded as Brahman, i.e., thinking of them as Brahman-is proscribed. Such a fervent meditation cannot but magnify the thing and give it a glorious form so as to excite admiration and even love. Again what is called the Internal Ātman (soul) is said in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka to be dearer than a son, wealth and everything. else (I. 4. 8.). Here the word Ātman may possibly be taken to mean one&rsquo;s own soul. In the same Upaniṣad there is another passage which runs thus: &ldquo;This is that Great Unborn, who is of the form of thought among vital airs, who dwells in the cavity of the heart, who is controller of all, ruler of all, the lord of all, By doing good or evil deeds he does not become better or worse. He is the ruler of all beings, he is the causeway or dike that separates things from one another and prevents them being confused together (he is the preserver of order). The Brāhmaṇas desire to know him by the words of the Vedas, by worship, charity and austerity. Knowing him, one becomes a sage. The recluses desiring him as the place to live in, renounce the world. On this account the wise, men of old did not desire progeny, saying to themselves: What shall we do with progeny, when we have got this Being, this world to live in?&rsquo;; and thus they gave up desire for sons, wealth and the world and lived the life of mendicants&rdquo; (IV. 4. 22).</p>
<p>Now, if those wise men of old gave up all the pleasures of the world to contemplate and dwell with the Supreme Being, so eloquently described, must it not be considered that they were actuated by love for Him, though the word Bhakti does not occur</p>
<p>here? And at the bottom of all those rapturous sayings about the peace attained by seeing the Supreme Soul in the world and the heart of man, there must be a feeling akin to love. And during the period when the Ṛgveda poetry was composed, love for God or gods was often an abiding sentiment in the heart of the poet, as is evident from the words: &ldquo;Dyaus is my father&rdquo; (RV. I. 104. 33), &ldquo;Aditi (the boundless) is father, mother, and son&rdquo; (RV. I. 89. 10); and from such prayers as &quot; O father Dyaus, avert all evils&rdquo;, &ldquo;Be accessible to us and gracious as a father to the son&rdquo;, etc. Though the later sacrificial ritual destroyed the spirit of these verses and converted them into simple verbal formulae, still, the feeling that was in the heart at the time when they were composed, must have continued, though it found no expression for a time and exhibited itself again mixed with wonder and admiration in the times of the Upaniṣads. It certainly was not absent during this last period. The text about the two birds, the friends and companions of each other, by which are meant the Supreme and Individual souls exists in the Ṛksaṁhitā(I. 164. 20) and is repeated in the Muṇḍaka-Upanişad (VII. 1.1).</p>
<p>In the last (MU. III. 2. 3), and in the KU. (II. 23), there is a verse to the effect that this Supreme Soul is not to be attained by lectures (from a teacher), nor by intelligence, nor by much learning; he is to be attained by him whom the Supreme Soul favours; to him he discloses his form. Again we have the dootrine that the supremely wise Being, the life of all, leads a man to do good deeds, whom he desires to elevate (KBU. III. 8); and another, that God dwelling in the heart of all beings, controls. them which latter forms the subject of a celebrated passage in the BU. III. 7. From this it is clear that the doctrine that the individual soul is dependent on the Supreme and that the latter alone works out his salvation, was acknowledged in Upaniṣad times.</p>
<p>§ 30. In this manner all the points that constitute the Ekāntika religion of the Bhagavadgītāare to be found in the older religious. literature. The word Bhakti, however, in the sense of love is not to be found except in a verse in SU. But that word is not alwaysused in the sense of love even by Rāmānuja. In his system Bhakti means constant meditation and corresponds to the Upāsanāof</p>
<p>the Upaniṣads. The word etymologically signifies resorting to and then loving the thing resorted to. It is used in this sense by Pāṇini in Sūtra IV. 3.95; but the word, as explained by the commentators, has a passive sense and means a thing resorted. to, liked or loved: and general and special terminations are prescribed, which, when affixed to a noun, indicate one by whom the thing expressed by the noun is liked or loved. In this senso the word Bhakti is used by Yāska also, when he speaks of certain things ns Agnibhaktīni, Indrabhaktīni, i. o., things which resort to, or relate themselves to, Agni, occ. Thus the idea of love was associated with the word in early times, though it then signified loved instead of love. Properly speaking, by the rules of Pāṇini himself, it ought to signify the latter, as the suffix // indicates Bhāva or condition. Howsoevor the word may have come into use in later tintes, the thing expressed by it. viz., love for the Ātman or the Supreme Suul, was an idea implied and often expressed by the word Priya or Prayas in the Upaniṣad period.</p>
<p>§ 31. The state of things which must have led to the evoluttion of the religion of the Gītā seems to me to be this. About the time when the systems of religion we have been considering Brose, there was a tendency amongst the people which often worked itself out, as is evident from the Pali Birth-Stories, to give up worldly life and betake themselves to a residence in forests or mountains. Even Buddhism, Jainism and other like systems considered an ascetic life to be a sine qua non of religious elevation. There is reason to believe that Śramaṇas existed before the rise of Buddhism. The religious systems that had sprung up were mostly atheistic. The Indian mind had become prone to indulge in mere moral discourses and thoughts of moral exaltasion, unassociated with a theistic faith, as appears clear from Buddhism and other systems, and also from dry moral dissertations of which the Mahābhāratais fall. Such a system as that of the Bhagavadgītā was, therefore, necessary to counterset these tendencies. Theistic ideas were so scattered in the Upaniṣads, that it was necessary for practical purposes to work them up into a system of redemption capable of bing grasped castiy.</p>
<p>These appear to be the conditions under which the Gītācame</p>
<p>into existence. I am not inclined to dissolve Vāsudeva and Arjuna into solar myths; but Vāsudeva could not have been living when the Bhagavadgītāwas composed as a discourse delivered by him, any more than Buddha was living when his discourses were. reduced to the form of books. It is worthy of remark that both of them are called Bhagavats when speaking. Vāsudeva must already have been doified before the Bhagavadgītāwas written.</p>
<p>As regards the attitude of the Bhagavat to the older belief, it is evident that it is conservative and he came to fulfil the law and not supersede it. It must already have been seen that he looks at the sacrificial religion from almost the same point of view as the Upaniṣads. The cherishing of desires which the sacrificial rites encourged is considered harmful, and the fruit attained by means of them is perishable. It was because this. Ekāntikareligion was so conservative, that it gradually made its way into Hindu society in general, though it did not succeed. in uprooting the religion of sacrifices. Still it always retained. its character as a religion for women and for all castes, Śūdras included, and in its later development it was associated with such Vedic rites as then remained when it was professed by the Brāhmaṇas, but not so associated when its followers were of lower castes, among whom it continued to exercise great influence. The Bhagavat&rsquo;s attitude towards the worshippers of other gods. has already been explained. It was strictly liberal. All worship. to whomsoever it was directed, reaches him ultimately, but the devotees of other gods do not know Bhagavat as he truly is and thus go wrong. This attitude must have had something to do with the influence of the Vāsudeva-Kṛṣṇa cult over the lower classes.</p>
<p><strong>VII. Identification of Vāsudeva with Nārāyaṇa.</strong></p>
<p>§ 32. The word Nārāyaṇais similar to Nāḍāyaṇa, which last is formed by P. IV. 1. 99 and means the Gotra Nāḍāyaṇa. The termination is significative and means in this case the resting place or the place to which Nāḍa or a collection of Naḍas go. So Nārāyaṇameans the resting place or goal of Nāra or a collection of Nāras<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. In theNārāyaṇīya (XII. 341) Keśava or</p>
<p>Hari says to Arjuna that he is known as the resting place or goal of men (Narāṇām). The word Nṛor Naṛa is also used to denote gods as manly persons, especially in the Vodas, so that Nārāyaṇa may be construed as the resting place or goal of gods. There is a tradition which connects Nārāyaṇa with the primeval waters. Manu (1.10), and also Hari in the above passage say that the waters were called Nārās because they were the sons of Nara, and, since they were the first resting place of Brahmāin the first case and of Hari in the second, the two were called Nārāyaṇas. The Purāṇas, such as the Vāyu and the Viṣṇu, agree with Manu. Again there is a tradition that Brahmadeva sprang from the lotus in the navel of Nārāyaṇa or Viṣṇu (M Bh. III, 12, 34 and XII 349. 18), In the Vāyu-Purāṇa Nārāyaṇa is represented as prior to Avyakta or matter in an undeveloped form, and from Avyakta sprang the mundane egg, and from the latter arose Brahmadeva.</p>
<p>All these traditions in various forms seem to go back to RV. X. 82.5 and 6, which may be thus translated: &ldquo;Prior to the sky, prior to this earth, prior to the living gods, what is that embryo. which the waters held first and in which all the gods existed? The waters held that same embryo in which all gods exist or find themselves; on the navel of the unborn stood something in which. all beings stood&rdquo;. In this we have first the waters mentioned; on those waters stood the embryo, which corresponds to the Brahmāof the later tradition, who created everything; and the unborn corresponds to Nārāyaṇa from whose navel he sprang. In this embryo all the gods, it is said, found themselves. This corresponds to the Naras, men or gods, whose goal or resting place was Nārāyaṇa, so that this confirms the identity between Brahmāand Nārāyaṇa mentioned by Manu and some of the Purāṇas. Nārāyaṇa therefore, who,by the other authorities cited above, is considered prior to Brahmadeva and to the Svayaṁbhūof Manu, is another. person and has a cosmic character and is not a historical or mythological individual. This idea of Nārāyaṇa was developed in the period of the later Brāhmaṇas and Āraṇyakas.</p>
<p>In the Śatapatha-Brāhmaṇa (XII. 3. 4), Puruṣa Nārāyaṇa is represented to have sent forth from the place of sacrifice Vasus, Rudras and Ādityas by means of the morning, midday and evening libations respectively, he alone remaining in the place, Fra</p>
<p>jāpati tells him to sacrifice again, and the substance of the whole. is that Nārāyaṇaplaced himself in all the worlds, in all the gods, in all the Vedas and in all the vital airs, and they were placed in him. This shadows forth the rising of Nārāyaṇato the dignity of the Supreme Soul, who pervades all and in whom all things. exist and who in the beginning sent forth all the gods, being himself their receptacle or resting place as indicated in RV. X. 82. 6. In another place (XIIL 6. 1) Puruṣa Nārāyaṇais mentioned as having conceived the idea of a Pañcarātra Sattra (continued sacrifices for five days) as the means of obtaining superiority over all beings and becoming all beings. He performed the sacrifices and attained to that dignity. Here also Nārāyaṇa&rsquo;s becoming the Supreme Ruler and becoming all are spoken of, Nārāyaṇais represented as the author of the Puruṣasūkta (RV. X. 90). This appears to be as much a fanciful representation, as that of Viśvakarman and others as authors of other hymns As in these last cases, it has a connection with the deity to which the hymn refers, so that Nārāyaṇa is another name of the Puruṣa, and these two names are associated together, as we have seen, in the above citations from the Śatapatha-Brāhmana. In the Taittiriya-Āraṇyaka (X. 11) Nārāyaṇais described with all the attributes of the Supreme soul, which are usually found mentioned in the Upaniṣads.</p>
<p>In the Mahābhārata and Purāṇas, he figures as the supreme god, especially in connection with the creation; mythologically he is represented as lying on the body of a huge serpent in the ocean. of milk, the original conception of his connection with the primeval waters being still kept to. Nārāyaṇathus became an object of worship. In the Ghosuṇḍi Inscription noticed before<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>, there is what appears to be a dedication of an enclosure to Nārāyaṇa(Nārāyaṇa-Vāṭikā),</p>
<p>§33. The heaven of this Nārāyaṇawas the Śvetadvīpa or white. island. In the Kathāsaritsāgara (54. 19, 21, 23) Naravāhanadatta is represented to have been carried to the white island by Devasiddhi and to Hari reposing on the body of the serpent Śeṣa and attended by Nārada and other devotees. In another place in the same work (115, 101-3) certain gods are spoken of as having gone to Śvetadvīpa and seen Hari in a house made of great gems,</p>
<p>lying on the serpent bed with Lakṣmīsitting at his feet. In the Harivaṁśa (14,384 ) it is stated that Yogins and Kāpilasāṁkhyas, who desire Mokṣa or final deliverance, go to the white island or Śvetadvīpa, by reciting the prayer and praise composed by Balin. Evidently, therefore, Śvetadvīpa or white island is the heaven in which Nārāyaṇa, spoken of sometimes as Hari, dwells. It corresponds to the Vaikuṇṭha of Viṣṇu, the Kailāsa of Śiva, and the Goloka of Gopālakṛṣṇna; and to that heaven of Nārāyaṇa it was that Nārada went and saw him and learned from him the monotheistic religion of Vāsudeva. There is, therefore, no need to suppose that the white island was a Christian country peopled by white races .</p>
<p>§ 34. Nārāyaṇa, being thus evolved as the Supreme Being in the later Brāhmanicperiod, was, of course, prior to Vāsudeva, and in the epic times when the worship of the latter arose, Vāsudeva was identified with Nārāyaṇa. In the Vanaparvan (chaps. 188, 189) there is a description of the condition of things at the time of dissolution of the universe, in which it is stated that there. was water everywhere and there was a boy lying on couch on a branch of a Nyagrodha tree. He opened his mouth and took in Mārkaṇḍeya, who roamed in the inside and saw the whole universe and was struck with wonder. Then the boy vomited or threw him out, when he saw again the waters alone. Mārkaṇḍeya then asked the boy who he was; then he said: &ldquo;Formerly I gave to the waters the name of Nārāḥ, and those were my resting place (Ayana), and therefore I am Nārāyaṇa&rdquo;, and thus he goes on to describe his greatness. Finally Mārkaṇḍeya, who tells the whole story, says. to Yudhiṣṭhira that Janārdana, his relative, is this same Nārāyaṇa. The burden of the whole of the Nārāyaṇīya section seems to be this identity between Nārāyaṇa and Vāsudeva.</p>
<p>Besides this Nārāyaṇa, the creator of all, there was a tradition about another who was always associated with Nara. This companionship seems to be traceable to the Upaniṣad idea of two birds. dwelling in a tree, friends and associates of each other. That one of those, who is called the lord and the onlooker, is in the present. tradition Nārāyaṇa, and the other, who is engaged in eating the fruit of the tree, Nara. The old idea was transferred to the new conception of Nārāyaṇa as the resting place or abode of all men. In</p>
<p>the opening chapter of the Nārāyaṇīya it is stated that Nārāyaṇathe eternal soul of the universe, with four forms became the son of Dharma. The four forms or four sons were Nara, Nārāyaṇa, Hari and Kṛṣṇa. The first two of these devoted themselves to the practice of austerities in the Badarikāśrama.</p>
<p>The same story is given in the Vāmana-Purāṇa (chap. 6). These four are represented as the sons of Dharma and had Ahiṁsā(non-killing) as their mother. This story seems to be significant. About the time when the new systems of religion arose, the ideas. that were undergoing fermentation were Dharma or righteousness and Ahiṁsāor non-slaughter, as against the old ceremonial of sacrificial rites and the killing of animals in accordance with it. These four names, therefore, were names connected with the introduction of a new system of religion, not heterodox, which concerned itself with righteousness and non-slaughter of animals. That is what appears to be meant by Dharma being called the father of these four and Ahiṁsātheir mother.</p>
<p>Nara and Nārāyaṇaare sometimes called Ṛṣis, and that is probably to be traced to the conception of Nārāyaṇaas the Rṣi or composer of the Puruṣasūkta. These gods must have been very famous at the time when the Mahābhārata was composed, since in the opening stanza of the different books obeisance is made to these two gods. In the Vanaparvan (12. 46, 47) Janārdana is represented to have said to Arjuna: &ldquo;Oh invincible one, thou art Nara and I am Hari Nārāyaṇa, and we, the sages Nara-Nārāyaṇa, have come to this world at the proper time; thou art not different from me, oh Pārtha, and I am not different from thee; it is not possible to know any difference between us.&rdquo; In chap. 30 (verse 1) of the same Parvan, the God of gods (Śiva) says to Arjuna: &ldquo;In a former birth (body) thou wast Nara and with Nārāyaṇafor thy companion, performedst austerities for many thousands of years in Badari&rdquo;. In the Udyogaparvan (49.19) it is said: &ldquo;The two heores, Vāsudeva and Arjuna, who are great warriors, are the old gods Naraand Nārāyaṇa. This is the tradition.&rdquo; In this manner there are a good many examples of the identification of Arjuna and Vāsudeva with Nara and Nārāyaṇa. And thus the old tradition about the two Ṛṣis who</p>
<p>are warriors at the same time was brought into connection with the two interlocutors of the Bhagavadgītā.</p>
<p><strong>VIII. Identification of Vāsudeva with Viṣṇu.</strong></p>
<p>§ 35. Viṣṇu is a Vedic deity. There are but few hymns addressed to him in ṚV., but his personality is by no means unimportant. The long strides which he takes, and the three steps: by which he measures the universe, are always described with an enthusiastic spirit. His first two steps can be discerned and approached by men, but the third no one car dare transgress, and it is beyond the flight of birds (ṚV. I. 155.5). The wise see the highest place of Viṣṇu(Paramam padam), as it were an eye fixed in the heaven (ṚV. I. 22. 201. In the highest place of Viṣṇu there is a well of honey, and there the gods rejoice (ṚV. I 154, 5). Viṣṇu appears as the comrade and helper of Indra.</p>
<p>Viṣṇu, however, in spite of his comparatively subordinate position in ṚV, began to rise in importance in the time of the Brāhmaṇas, while during the epic and Purāṇic period he rose to the rank of the supreme spirit. The moment which seems to have been in operation during this process of elevation, was reverence for the third step or the mysterious highest abode of Viṣṇu beyond the ken of all. In the Brāhmaṇic period we have the mention of Agni as the lowest of the gods and Viṣṇu as the highest (AB.1.1). Then we have a story in Śatapatha-Brāhmaṇa and Taittiriya-Āraṇyaka of a sacrificial session held by the gods for the attainment of splendour, glory and food. They proposed to themselves that he amongst them, who by his deeds reached the end of the sacrifice before the others, should attain the highest place among them all. Viṣṇu reached the end before the others, and he thus became the highest of the gods; and therefore they say that Viṣṇu is the highest of the gods (ŚB. XIV. 1. 1.). When this was written, Viṣṇu had already attained to the supreme dignity, and the story is invented to account for it. There is again in the same Brāhmaṇa (1. 2. 5) the story of Viṣṇu the dwarf. When the gods and Asuras were contending for a place of sacrifice, the latter agreed that they would allow as much land for the former as was equal to the size of the dwarf. Viṣṇu was then made to lie down, but gradually he grew so large as to encompass the</p>
<p>whole earth, and so the gods got the whole earth. Here a miraculous power has been attributed to Viṣṇu, though he is not necessarily the Supreme Spirit.</p>
<p>In the Maitri-Upaniṣad (VI. 13) food is called the form of Bhagavad-Viṣṇu, which sustains the universe. In the Kaṭha-Upaniṣad (III. 9) the progress of the human soul is compared to a journey, and the end of the path which he traverses is called. the highest place of VViṣṇu (Paramam padam). This is the final goal and the abode of eternal bliss, and the use of the word in this sense lends support to the view that the elevation of Viṣṇu to the dignity of the Supreme Being was due to the fact that the expression was capable of being used to denote this sense. Some time after, Viṣṇu became even a household god. In the ceremony of the seven steps contained in the marriage ritual, the bridegroom has to say to the bride, when she puts forth a step :&rdquo; May Viṣṇu lead you or be with you.&rdquo; This formula occurs in the Gṛhya-sūtras of Āpastamba, Hiraṇyakeśin and Pāraskara, but not in that of Āśvalāyana. In epic times Viṣṇu grew to be in every respect. the Supreme Spirit; and Vāsudeva is identified with Viṣṇu. In chapters 65 and 66 of the Bhīṣmaparvan noticed before<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>, the Supreme Spirit is addressed as Nārāyaṇa and Viṣṇu and is identified with Vāsudeva.</p>
<p>In the Anugītā portion of the Āśvamedhikaparvan (chap.53-55) Kṛṣṇa, while returning to Dvārakā, meets on the way a sage of the name of Uttaṅka of the Bhṛgu race. The sage asks Kṛṣṇa whether he had established peace between the contending kinsmen, Pāṇḍus and Kurus, and established affectionate relations between them. Kṛṣṇa replies that the Kurus had been destroyed and the Pāṇḍus were in possession of the supreme sovereignty. The sage got angry and said that he would pronounce a curse against Kṛṣṇa , but if he explained to him the philosophy of the soul (Adhyātma), he would desist. Kṛṣṇa then does explain this philosophy at the request of Uttaṅka and shows him his universal form (Virāt svarūpam). The Svarūpa is the same as, or similar to, that shown to Arjuns according to the Bhagavadgītā, but it is here called the Vaiṣṇava form (Rūpa), which name does not occur. in the other passage. Thus then between the period of the Bhāga</p>
<p>vadgītāand that of the Anugītā, the identity of Vāsudeva-Kṛṣṇa with Viṣṇu had become an established fact. In the Śāntiparvan (chap. 43) Yudhiṣṭhira addressing Kṛṣṇa sings a hymn of praise, in which Kṛṣṇa is identified with Viṣṇu. In the epic times, Viṣṇu is regarded as the Supreme Spirit, but the names of Nārāyaṇa and Vāsudeva-Viṣṇu apparently occur more frequently or are more. prominent.</p>
<p>§ 36. Still many parts of the Māhābharata represent a condi tion of things in which the divinity Vāsudeva-Kṛṣṇa was not generally acknowledged. In the above passage from the Anugītā, the sage Uttaṇka is about to pronounce a curse on Kṛṣṇa, as if he was an ordinary individual, and desists only when his universal form is shown to him. Similarly in many passages noticed by Dr. Muir (O. S. T. IV, pp. 205ff.) Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s divinity is denied; and Saṁjaya and Bhīṣma make strenuous efforts to establish it.</p>
<p>What appears to be the fact is, that the religion of Vāsudeva, in which divine honours were paid to him, was professed by the Sātvatas, as observed in several of the passages noticed above, and its gradual extension to other tribes and people of the country is shadowed forth in these portions of the great epic. In the Purāṇictimes, however, the cult of Vāsudeva ceased to be militant, and three streams of religious thought, namely, the one flowing from Viṣṇu, the Vedic god at its source, another from Nārāyaṇa, the cosmic and philosophic god, and the third from Vāsudeva, the historical god, mingled together decisively and thus formed the later Vaiṣṇavism. There is however, a fourth stream, which in modern times in some. of the systems of Vaiṣṇavism has acquired an aln ost exclusive predominance, and to this we shall now direct our attention.</p>
<p><strong>IX. Identification of Vāsudeva-Kṛṣṇa with the<br>
Cowherd God (Gopāla-Kṛṣṇa).</strong></p>
<p>§ 37. There is no allusion to the cowherd Kṛṣṇain the authorities we have hitberto quoted. The Inscriptions, the work of Patañjali and even the Nārāyaṇīya itself indicate no knowledge of the existence of such a god. In the last the Avātars of Vāsudevais mentioned as having been assumed for the destruction of Kaṁsa, but of none of the demens whom the cowered Kṛṣṇakilled in the</p>
<p>cow-settlement (Gokula). The contrast between this and the statements in the Harivaṁśa (vv. 5876-5878), Vāyu-Purāṇa, chap. 98, vv. 100-102, and Bhāgavata-Purāṇa, II. 7, of Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s Avatara having been assumed for destroying all the demons that appeared in the cow-settlement as well as of Kaṁsa-is significant. When these works were written, the legend about the cowherd Kṛṣṇa must have already become current and his identification with Vāsudeva-Kṛṣṇa been effected. And the story of the Vṛṣṇi prince Vāsudeva having been brought up in a cow-settlement is incongruous with his later career as depicted in the Mahābhārata. Nor does any part of it require the presupposition of such a boyhood as has been ascribed to him.</p>
<p>In the Sabhāparvan (chap. 41), however, Śiśupāla in traducing Kṛṣṇa alludes to his valorous deeds, such as the killing of Pūtanā and others, which were done in the cow-settlement, and speaks of Bhiṣma&rsquo;s having praised them. But the praise bestowed on Kṛṣṇa by Bhiṣma (chap. 38) does not contain a mention of these deeds. This passage therefore is interpolated¹.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.The Southern Recension of the Mahābhārata contains many interpolations.. In the Nārāyaṇīya, chap. 338 of the Northern Recension corresponds to chap, 344 of the Southern. We have six verses in the latter which are not contained in the former. They speak of animals made of flour being killed. Instead of real live animals. This is a later doctrine, which is strongly advocated by the Mādhva Vaiṣṇavas, but denied with as much pertinacity by Smārtas. In the present case in the Sabhāparvan, chap. 22, vv. 27-36 about Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s doings in Gokula are in S, and not in N. Chapter 23 in S, about Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s birth and removal to Gokuls is not in N. Chapter 24, 8, vv. 4-5 about Jarāsaṁidha&rsquo;s declining to fight with Kṛṣṇa , because he was a Gopa, are not found in chap. 21, N, which corresponds to that chapter. Chapters. 33 and 34 in S. are not in N. The first is about Sahadeva&rsquo;s expedition to the Pāṇḍya country and the second about Ghaṭotkaca&rsquo;s being sent to Laṅka and Vibhīṣaṇa&rsquo;s paying tribute out of respect for Kṛṣṇa. At the end of chap. 39 in S, corresponding to chap. 36 in N, there is an interpolated passage, in which the worship done to Kṛṣṇa is derided as having been done to a Gopa or cowlerd. This is not found in N. Chapters 42-61 in 8, are not found in N. They contain a mention of the Avatāras of Viṣṇu and his exploits it Gokula. Chap. 64 in S, corresponds to chap. 41 in N. Thus attempts have always been made to bring by means of interpolations the stories told in the Mahābhārata to the form which they subsequently assume. The passage dealt with in the text is a clear interpolation.</p>
<p>The name Govinda does occur in the Bhagavadgītāand other parts of Mahābhārata. It is an ancient name, being derived by a Vārttika on P. III. 1. 138. If this name was given to Kṛṣṇa, be cause of his having had to do with cows, while a boy in Gokula, and his previous history in the cow-settlement was known, when the genuine portions of the Mahābhārata were composed, we should have found an etymology of the name expressive of that connection. But, on the contrary, in the Ādiparvan it is stated that Govinda is so called, because in the form of a boar he found the earth (Go) in the waters, which ho agitated (chap. 21. 12); and in the Śāntiparvan (chap. 342. 70) Vāsudeva says: &ldquo;I am called Govinda by the gods, because formerly I found the earth which was lost and lodged in a den&rdquo;. The origin of the name may be traced to this legend, but more probably Govinda is a later form of Govid, which in the Ṛgveda is used as an epithet of Indra in the sense of the finder of the cows. This opithet, as another. Keśiniṣūdana which is also applicable to Indra, must have been transferred to Vāsudeva-Kṛṣṇa, when he came to be looked upon as the chief god.</p>
<p>From all this it appears that the story of Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s boyhood in the Gokula was unknown till about the beginning of the Christian Era. The Harivaṁśa which is the chief authority for it, contains the word Dīnāra, corresponding to the Latin word Denarius, and oonsequently must have been written about the third century of the Christian era. Some time before that the stories of Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s boyhood must have been current. The nature of the tribe of cowherds among whom Kṛṣṇa lived, is to he gathered from the words of the boy-god-addressed to his foster-father Nanda, in order to dissuade him from celebrating a festival to Indra, and induce. him to worship the mountain Govardhana instead. &ldquo;We sre cowherds,&rdquo; he says, he says, &ldquo;wandering in forests, maintaining our selves on cows, which are cows, which are our wealth; cows are our deities, and mountains and forests&rdquo; (H. 3808). The cowherds lived in a Ghoṣa or temporary encampment, which was capable of being easily removed from place to place, as when they left Vraja and encamped in Vṛndāvana (H. 3532). Ghoṣa is defined as Ābhirapallī, which is generally understood as the enclosure of cowherds.</p>
<p>But the original signification of the word Ābhīra is not a cow</p>
<p>herd. It is the name of a race, whose original oooupation was the tending of cows; and consequently the name became in later. times equivalent to a &lsquo;cowherd&rsquo;. For these reasons the cowherda among whom the boy-god Kṛṣṇa lived, belong to a nomadic tribe of the name of Ābhīras. These Ābhīras occupied the tract of country from Madhuvana near Mathurāto Anūpa and Ānarta, the regions about Dvāraka (H. 5161-5163). The Ābhīras are mentioned in the Mahābhārata (Mausalaparvan, chap. 7) as having attacked Arjuna, who was carrying the women of the Vṛṣṇis from Dvāraka to Kurukṣetra after the extinction of the male members. of the Vṛṣṇirace. They are described as robbers and Mleochas, and lived near Pañcanada, which is probably Punjab. The Viṣṇu-Purāṇa locates them near the Aparāntas (Konkan) and Saurāṣtras, and Varāhamihira assigns them nearly the same position. Though they are mentioned as the southern people ( Bṛ. S. 14. 12), and as living in the southwest (Bṛ. S. 14. 18), the Ābhīras must have. migrated in large hordes into the country. They were at first. mere nomads and afterwards settled in the country from about the eastern confines of the Punjab to the vicinity of Mathurāand in the south up to Saurāṣṭra and Kathiavad, i. e., they must have. occupied the whole of Raiputāna and a tract to the northeast of it. After they were settled, they took to various occupations, one. of which was of course the old one, namely the tending of cows.</p>
<p>The descendants of the old Ābhīras are called Āhirs at the present day, and we have now Āhirs following the occupation of carpenters, goldsmiths, cowherds and even priesthood. At one time they founded a kingdom in the nothern part of the Maratha country, and an Inscription of the ninth year of the Ābhīra king. Iśvarasena, the son of Ābhīra Śivadatta, is found at Nasik<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>. From the form of the characters the Inscription probably belongs. to the end of the third century. The Purāṇas mention a dynasty of Ābhīras composed of ten <a href="http://3" title="See Vāyu-Purāṇa, vol. II, chap. 37, page 453, Bibl. Ind,">princes</a>. Another Inscription of an earlier date is found at Gundā<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>in Kathiavad, in which the charities of Rudrabhūti, a general, who is called an Ābhīra, are mentioned. The Inscription belongs to the reign of a Kṣatrapa</p>
<p>king of the name of Rudrasiṁha, who held power in Śaka 102 corresponding to 180 A. D.</p>
<p>If then about the end of the second century and in the third, the Ābhiras enjoyed high political position, they must have migrated into the country in the first century. They probably brought with them the worship of the boy-god and the story of his humble birth, his reputed father&rsquo;s knowledge that he was not his son, and the massacre of the innocents.The two last correspond to Nanda&rsquo;s knowing that he was not the father of Kṛṣṇa and Kaṁsa&rsquo;s killing all children. The stories of Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s hoyhood, such as that of killing Dhenuka, a demon in the form of a wild ass, were brought by Ābhiras<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>, and others were developed after they came to India. It is possible that they brought with them the name Christ also, and this name probably led to the identification of the boy-god with Vāsudeva-Kṛṣṇa, The Goanese and the Bengalis often pronounce the name Kṛṣṇa as Kuṣṭo or Kriṣṭo, and so the Christ of the Ābhiras was recognised as the Sanskrit Kṛṣṇa.</p>
<p>The dalliance of Kṛṣṇa with cowherdesses, which introduced an element inconsistent with the advance of morality into the Vāsudeva religion, was also an after-growth, consequent upon the freer intercourse between the wandering Ābhīras and their more civilised Āryan neighbours. Morality cannot be expected. to be high or strict among races in the condition of the Ābhīras at the time and their gay neighbours took advantage of its looseness. Besides, the Ābhīrawomen must have been fair and handsome as those of the Āhir-Gavaliyas or cowherds of the present day are.</p>
<p>§ 38. The story in the Buddhistic Ghatajātaka represents Vāsudeva and his brothers to be the sons of Kaṁsa&rsquo;s sister Devagabbhāand Upasāgara. They were made over to a man of the name of Andhakaveṇhu and to his wife Nandagopā who was the attendant of Devagabbhā. In this version there is a remi niscence of Devakī in the name Devagabbhā; and Nanda and Yaśodā or Gopāof Gokula are compounded together to form the name of the maid-servant who brought up Devagabbhā&rsquo;s sons as</p>
<p>her sons. And in Andhakaveṇhu the names of the two kindred Yādava tribes, Andhaka and Vṛṣṇi, are compounded together, and the compound becomes the name of the husband of the maid-servant. Now as Andhaka and Vṛṣṇi were according to the highest authorities two distinot names, and were the names of the two tribes, this story contains a confused reminiscence of the true legend and was of a later growth. All the Jātakas were not written at one and the same time. While sone belong to a pre-Christian period, others must be assigned to post-Christian times, and the Ghatajātaka appears to me to belong to the latter class. The compound Nandagopā, therefore, though it contains a clear reminiscence of the foster-parents of the boy-god Kṛṣṇa, cannot be considered to point to a pre-Christian period for the identification of Vāsudeva-Kṛṣṇa with Gopāla-Kṛṣṇa.</p>
<p>X. The Pāñcarātra or Bhāgavata System.</p>
<p>§ 39. We have thus gone over the last element which goes to form the Vaiṣṇavism of the later times. That element, however, does not formi a prominent part, or forms no part at all, of the systems which are based upon the old Pāñcarātra doctrines As we have seen, the Ekāntika Dharma or monotheistic religion was that which was promulgated by the Bhagavadgītā; but the Pāñcarātrasystem, consisting, as it did, of the worship of Vāsudeva and his several forms, shows no organic connection with that work, though Bhakti or devotion is common to both. That system must have developed in about the third century B. C., as. we have already seen from the Inscriptions and passages in books referred to before. Their being free from the Gopāla-Kṛṣṇa element is thus intelligible, and the later Vaiṣṇava systems, such as that of Rāmānuja and Madhva, which more or less recognise the old Bhāgavata doctrines or ideas, have entirely neglected that element. In other systems, however, it is recognised and in a general way in popular Vaiṣṇavism.</p>
<p>The authorities on which the Bhāgavata system was based are the Pāñcarātra-Saṁhitās; and Rāmānuja in his comments on the Brahmasūtras, II. 2. 39-42, quotes from some of these. The first quotation is from the Pauṣkara-Saṁhitā, which is intended to show that, when Brāhmaṇas worship the fourfold soul with the</p>
<p>traditional names, it should be considered authoritative. The second is from the Sātvata-Saṁhitā, which is to the effect that this great Śāstra contains the secret of Brahman and imparts discrimination to Brāhmaṇas who worship the true Brahmani bearing the name of Vāsudeva. There are two from the Parama-Saṁhitā. One of these gives the nature of Prakṛti, which is unsentient, of use to another than &ldquo;itself&rdquo;, eternal, always changeable, composed of three qualities, and is the sphere within which the action of agents is done. The other represents somebody, probably Śāṇḍilya himself, as saying that he has studied all the Vedas with the dependent treatises and Vākovākya, but not. having found the way to supreme bliss clearly stated in them.</p>
<p>One of these Saṁhitās, bearing the name of Sātvata, has been printed and is available. It begins by saying that Narada saw Paraśurāma on the Malaya Mountain and was told by him to visit the Ṛsis, who were in search of the place of Hari, and to instruct them in the Sātvatamethod of worship (Kriyāmārga). Nārada does this and explains to them the secret traditional methods (Rahasyāmnāya). Nārāyana is spoken of here as the supreme spirit. The secret methods were formerly explained by the bearer of the discus (Vāsudeva ), when asked by Saṁkarṣaṇa. Saṁkarṣaṇa spoke to Viṣṇu at the beginning of the Tretāage, asking why his countenance had become red. The answer is: &ldquo;Because the people will be afflicted with passion in this age&rdquo;. Being asked how they will be delivered from passion, Saṁkarṣaṇa is told that they will be delivered by adoring the eternal and highest Brahman in three ways. The Supreme Spirit, who has hands and feet and eyes everywhere and is endowed with six Guṇas or qualities, is Para or the Highest. It is one and the support of all. Besides this there is a triad, each member of which is distinguished from the others by a distinction in knowledge and other qualities. These three should be known as Vyūhas, or forms, who confer the desired fruit with ease.</p>
<p>Balarāma then asks about the mode of service. Bhagvat then explains it as follows&rdquo; When the pure Brāhman, which is the aim and end of the creation, exists in the heart of qualified Brāhmaṇas, who worship Vāsudeva, the highest Śāstra, which is a</p>
<p>great Upaniṣad of Brahman, springs forth from it for the redemption of the world and confers discrimination; it contains divine. methods and has for its fruit final deliverance¹. I will then explain that to you which is of verious kinds. This Śāstra, along with Rahasya, is fruitful to those who have gone through Yoga with its eight parts, and whose soul is devoted to mental sacrifice. The Yogins, who are Brāhmaṇas guided by the Vedas and who have given up the mixed worship, are competent for the worship. of the single one, dwelling in the heart. The three orders, Kṣatriya and others, and those who are Prapanna or have resorted to self-surrender are competent for the worship of the four Vyūhas accompanied by Mantras, and also unaccompanied by them, so far as regards the series of ceremonies concerning the four Vyūhas as well as the actions and the collection of Mantras concerning the Vibhavas². All these persons should be free from attachment and absorbed in the performance of their duties and be devotees of the supreme lord by their deeds, words and mind. In this manner, the four (orders) become competent, when they are initiated (for service) with Mantras. Hear now the process concerning the single form &ldquo;. Then follows the statement of the mystic arrangement of letters and formulae and the meditations. This work throughout contains the mystic modes of worship by means of Mantras variously arranged.</p>
<p>The allusion at the end of Chapter 66 of the Bhīṣmaparvan to Saṁkarsaṇa&rsquo;s having sung or expounded Vāsudeva according to the Sātvata rites (Vidhi) refers in all probability to such rites as are detailed in this Sātvata-Saṁhitā.</p>
<p>Śaṁkarācārya, in his notice of the BhāgavataSchool under Bṛ. S. II. 2. 42, gives five methods of worshipping the supreme lord, Bhāgavat Vāsudeva, in his fourfold form, which, along with the explanations given by the commentators, are as follows:- (1) Abhigamana or going to the temple of the deity with the speech, the body and the mind centred on him; (2) Upādāns or collecting the materials of worship; (3) Ijyāor worship; (4) Svādhyaya or the muttering of the usual Mantra; (5) Yoga ormeditation. By worshipping him in these ways for a hundred. years, all sin is destroyed and the devotee reaches Bhagavat.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.Two lines out of this are contained in the quotations from Rāmānuja given. above.</p>
<p>2.Vibbavas are the incarnations of the Supreme Spirit.</p>
<p>§40. The book called Nāradapañcarātra, published by the Asiatic Society of Bengal, contains the Saṁhitācalled Jñānāmṛitasāra. The glories of the boy Kṛṣṇa are sung in this work. Nārada desiring to know Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s greatness and the methods of his worship is recommended to go to Śaṁkara, or Śiva, and seek instruction from him. Nārada repairs to Kailāsa and enters the palace of Śaṁkara, which has seven gates. At these gates there are pictures and sculptures relating to the scenes of Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s childhood and his various deeds in the cow-settlement, such as Vṛṇḍavana, Yamunā, Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s sitting on the Kadamba tree with the garments of the cowherdesses and their return from bath in the Yamunā river in a naked condition, the destruction of the serpent Kāliya, the holding up of the Govardhana mountain on the palm of his hand, the journey to Mathurā and the lamentations of the. Gopīs and his foster-parents, etc. Sculptures representing some of these events were discovered on a pillar excavated at Mandor near Jodhpur about two years ago<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>. The age of the pillar has been considered not earlier than the fourth century A. D. The idea of imagining such sculptures on the gates of Śiva&rsquo;s palace could have. occurred to a writer only when the practice of adorning gates and pillars with such sculptures had become general. The Jñānāmṛtasāra, therefore, could not have been earlier than fourthcentury and appears to me to be considerably later, as will be presently shown.</p>
<p>Goloka or the world of cows is the heaven in which Kṛṣṇa dwells and which is reached by those who adore him, and several Mantras are given in this book, the reciters of which are rewarded. with a place in that heaven. The servitude of Hari through devotion is the highest Mukti or absolution according to this work. There are six modes of adoring Hari; viz., (1) remembrance of him, (2) utterance, ( of his name and glory ). ( 3 ) salutation, (4) resorting to his feet, (5) constant worship of him with devotion, and (6) surrender of the whole soul to him. The Bhāgavata-Purāṇa adds three more, viz., hearing (his praise ), servitude, and companionship (Ṡakhyam). These last two are preliminary to</p>
<p>the surrendering of the whole soul. In this book Rādhā is mentioned as the highest of the women whom Kṛṣṇa loved, and she is represented to have been formed by the original lord becoming two, one of which was Rādhā (IL 3. 24ff.). The exaltation of this woman is thus one of the main objects of this Saṁhitā.</p>
<p>The Saṁhitā we have been considering, seems thus to be entirely devoted to the advancement of the cult of the Kṛṣṇa of the cow-settlement or Gokula and of his beloved mistress Rādhā, now raised to the dignity of his eternal consort. The Vyūhas which form a peculiarity of the Pāñcarātra School, are not mentioned. in it. The creed afterwards promulgated by Vallabhāoārya is exactly similar to that set forth in this book. This Saṁhitā, therefore, must have heen written a short time before Vallabha, that is about the beginning of the sixteenth century. The Rāmānujiyas consider this Saṁhitā to be apocryphal.</p>
<p>XI. The Avatāras of Viṣṇu or Nārāyaṇa.</p>
<p>§ 41. An Avatāra or incarnation of a god differs from mereidentification of two gods in this, that in the former case the god that is considered an incarnation acts like a human being, or even a brute, at the same time that he has the miraculous powers of a god. The transition, however, from the idea of identification to that of incarnation is easy. The person in the flesh is identified with the god who is a mere spirit, so that the habit of thought which in Vedic times led to the identification of some of the Vedic deities with Agni, has been at work even in this conception of the Avatāras.</p>
<p>The Avatāras of Nārāyaṇaor Viṣṇu are variously given by the various authorities. In the passage in the Nārāyaṇīyatranslated above<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>,&rsquo; six only are given, viz, the boar, the manlion, the dwarf, Rāma of the Bhṛgu race,Rāma Dāśarathi and that assumed for the destruction of Kaṁsa (Vāsudeva-KṛṣṇaThis passage is followed after a short interval by another in which the incarnations are given as ten, the additions being Haṁsa (swan), Kūrma (turtoise), and Matsya (fish) in the beignning and Kalkin at the end. The one preceding Kalkin is called Sātvata, i. e.. Vāsudeva-Kṛṣṇa. This passage, following so closely on the</p>
<p>first, appears to be interpolated when the number of Avatāras became fixed at ten.</p>
<p>The Harivaṁśa mentions the six given in the first of these two passages. The Vāyu-Purāṇa gives the incarnations in two passages (Chap. 97, vv. 72. and Chap. 98, vv. 63ff.), in the first of which there are twelve, but some of them appear rather to be incarnations of Śiva and Indra. In the second the number ten, which about that time must have come into usage, is made up by adding to the six mentioned above the four: Dattātreya, one unnamed called the fifth, Vedavyāsa, and Kalkin. In the Varāha-Purāņa we have the ten incarnations which came to be accepted later, oon- taining the Fish, Tortoise, Buddha, and Kalkin, in addition to the six mentioned above. The Agni-Purāṇa gives the same ten.</p>
<p>The Bhāgavata-Purāṇa enumerates the incarnations in three. different passages. In the first, contained in Chapter 3 of Book I, twenty-two are mentioned. In the passage in Chapter 7 of Book II, we have twenty-three, and in Chapter 4 of Book XI, sixteen are given. It deserves notice that among the Avatāras mentioned in this Purāṇa are Sanatkumāra; the divine sage (Nārada), who expounded the Sātvata system; Kapila who explain d to Āsuri the Sāṁkhyasystem, which determines the collection. of principles; Dattātreya, who is represented to have taught Ānvīkṣikī to Alarka and the Prahrāda and the attainment of excellence hy means of Yoga to Yadu and Haihaya; Ṛṣabha, son of Nābhi and Merudevī, who abandoned attachment to all things, acquired serenity, and looking at all things alike and possessing Yoga power, acted as if he were a non-living creature; and lastly Dhanvantari, the teacher of the science of medicine.</p>
<p>Ṛṣabha, from the parentage given here and other indications, appears clearly to be the same as the first Tīrthaṁkara of the Jainas. He was probably raised to the dignity of an incarnation as the Buddha of the Buddhists was. There is hardly a wide-spread cult of any of these incarnations except Dattātreya, who is adored and worshipped by a large number of people to this day, and Rāma of whom more will have to be said hereafter. Kṛṣṇa, of course, though. included in the Avatāras stands on independent grounds and his worship over the widest area is due, not to his having been con</p>
<p>sidered an Avatāra, but to his being the peculiar object of adora. tion of the followers of a new religion or religious reform, as I have ventured to call it, which first took its rise among the Sātvatas.</p>
<p><strong>XII. Later Traces of the Bhāgavata School;<br>
and General Vaiṣṇavism.</strong></p>
<p>§ 42. We will now resume the chronological thread we have traced from Megasthenes to the latest Inscription, that at Nanaghat, which is to be referred to the first century B. C. For about four centuries after this there are no epigraphical or sculptural traces of any Brāhmanic religious system; and they reappear about the time when the Guptas rose to power in the first quarter of the fourth century. The Gupta princes, Candragupta II, Kumāragupta, and Skandagupta, are styled Paramabhāgavatas on their coins. They were thus worshippers of Bhagavat or Vāsudeva. Their dates range from 400 to 464 A. D.</p>
<p>On a panel at Udayagiri, there is a figure of a four-armed god, who is probably Viṣṇu. The Inscription below bears the date. 82 G. E., i. e.. 400 A. D.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup></p>
<p>There is a pillar at Bhitari in the Ghazipur District of the U. P., on which there is an Inscription which records the installation of an image of Śārṅgin and the grant of a village for its worship by Skandagupts, whose dates range between 454 and 464 A. D<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>. Śārṅgin must have been Vāsudeva-Kṛṣṇa,Skanda- gupta himself being a Bhāgavata.</p>
<p>A temple of Viṣṇu was erected in 456 A. D. by Cakrapālita, son of Parṇadatta, appointed viceroy of Surāṣṭra or Kathiavad by Skandagupta. The Inscription, which records this, opens with an invocation of Viṣṇu in the Vāmana or the dwarf incarnation<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In an Inscription at Eran in the Sagar district, C. P., belonging to the reign of Budhagupta and bearing the date 165 G. E., corresponding to 483 A. D., Mātrviṣṇu and his younger brother Dhanyaviṣṇuare represented to have erected &amp; Dhvajastambha or flag-</p>
<p>staff in honour of the god Janārdana. Mātṛviṣṇu is called a great devotee of Bhāgavat (Atyanta-Bhagavad-bhakta<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>). The god Janārdana must therefore be Vāsudeva-Krṣṇa.</p>
<p>A copper-plate Inscription of A. D. 495, found near the village. of Khoh in Baghelkhand, records the grant of a village, by a chief named Jayanātha, to Bhagavat for repairs to the temple of that god and for the performance of ordinary ceremonies<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>.</p>
<p>An Inscription on an iron pillar near Kutub Minar at Delhi speaks of that pillar as a flag-staff to Viṣṇu erected by a great king named Candra, who enjoyed universal sovereignty and was a great devotee of Viṣṇu. The Inscription is not dated, but if the Candra referred to here was Candragupta II, it belongs to the latter part of the fourth century or the beginning of the fifth<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In his Meghadūta (v. 15) Kalidāsa compares the cloud adorned with a piece of a rain-bow, with Viṣṇu in the shape of the cow-herd. adorned with a shining peacock feather. Here there is an identification of Gopāla-Krṣṇa with Viṣṇu; and, if the Vikramāditya who was the patron of Kalidāsa was Candragupta II of the Gupta Dynasty, this must be considered to be a record belonging to the early part of the fifth century.</p>
<p>We have already alluded to the sculptures on a pillar excavated at Mandor near Jodhpur. These sculptures represent the overturning of a cart by the baby Krṣṇa, the holding of the Govardhana Mountain by Krṣṇa on the palm of his hand, and such other events. I refer them tentatively to the fifth century.</p>
<p>In Śaka 500, Maṅgalīśa, a prince belonging to the early Cālukya dynasty of the Deccan, got a cave scooped out, in which a temple to Viṣṇu was constructed, and an image of Viṣṇu was installed in it. The provision for the performance of Nārāyaṇabali (offerings to Nārāyaṇa) was made by assigning the revenues of a village for the purpose<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>. In this cave-temple there are figures. of Viṣṇu and Nārāyaṇa lying on the body of a serpent, with Lakşmīrubbing his feet, and of the Boar and Narasiṁha incarna</p>
<p>tions, and of Harihara in which the peculiar marks of Hari, or Viṣṇu, and of Hara, or Śiva, are combined<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In mentioning the priests who are qualified to install and conseorate the images of certain gods, Varāhamihira says that this function in the case of Viṣṇu should be assigned to Bhāgavatas<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>. Bhāgavatas were thus recognised in his time as the peculiar worshippers of Viṣṇu. Varāhamihira died in Śaka, i. e. 587 A.D.<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup></p>
<p>Amarasiṁha, the author of the well-known Kośa or thesaurus, was a Buddhist. After giving the words expressive of gods. generally, when he comes to the names of particular gods, he begins by giving those of Buddha and proceeds next to give the names Viṣṇu, Nārāyaṇa etc., of which we have thirty-nine. After finishing these he says that Vāsudeva was his father. This means that the thirty-nine names proviously given are the names of Vāsudeva. If we examine these, we shall find that hefore Amare&rsquo;s time Vāsudeva had already been identified with Viṣṇu and NārāyaṇaExcept the name Dāmodara, there is no other con- necting Vāsudeva with Gokula, and the etymology of Dāmodara which connects him with that cow-settlement is doubtful. While Kaṁsārāti, or the enemy of Kaṁsa, does occur, we have no such name as Pūtanāri, the enemy of Pūtanā, or any other derived. from the names of the many demons he slew while he was a boy. There are also no names of incarnations except the doubtful one, Balidhvaṁsin, which however, has been interpreted by one. commentator as the destroyer of ignorance by means of Bali or oblations. There are, of course, several names derived from those. of other demons, such as Madhuripu and Kaitabhajit, but these are not the enemies destroyed by Viṣṇu in his incarnations as they are usually mentioned. After giving the name of the father of Vāsudeva-Kṛṣṇa, Amara proceeds to mention those of Saṁkarsana, or Baladeva, and afterwards of Pradyumna and Aniruddha. Thereafter he mentions those of Lakṣmi, the wife of Nārāyaṇa or Viṣṇu, then those of the weapons of the god and his ornaments, and ends with the names of Garuḍa, the vehicle of Viṣṇu After</p>
<p>finishing these he proceeds to the other great god of the Hindus, Śambhu or Śiva.</p>
<p>Here Amara appears clearly to have in view the four forms, or Vyūhas, of Vāsudeva recognised by the Bhāgavatas, so that in his time the prevalent form of Vaiṣṇavism was that embraced by the Bhāgavatas. Amara&rsquo;s exact age is doubtful, but, if he was a Buddhist, he must have belonged to the Mahāyāna sect, the sacred language of which was Sanskrit. This system was in full swing in the fourth, fifth and sixth centuries¹. Amarasiṁha, therefore, must have flourished in this last century, or, if we believe in the traditional verse which asserts his contemporaneousness with Kalidāsa and in Candragupta II as Vikramāditya, the famous patron of learning, he must have flourished in the early part of the fifth century. The identity of Vāsudeva-Kṛṣṇa with GopalaKṛṣṇa is very rarely alluded to, while that with Viṣṇu and Nārāyaṇaa is clearly set forth.</p>
<p>About the middle of the seventh century, Bāṇain his Harṣacarita represents a sage of the name of Divākaramitra, who, originally a Brāhmaṇa, became a Buddhist, as being surrounded in the Vindhya mountains, where he had his abode, by followers of a number of sects two of which were the Bhāgavatas and Pāñcarātras.</p>
<p>In the Daśāvatāra temple at Ellora there is a figure of Viṣṇu on the body of a serpent with Lakṣmi rubbing his feet and Brahmāseated on a lotus coming out of his navel. There are also images of the Narasiṁha, Vāmana and Varāha incarnations, as well as of Kṛṣṇa holding the Govardhana Mountain over the flocks of the cow-settlement. This temple was constructed about the middle of the eighth century in the time of Dantidurga of the Rāṣṭrakūṭa race. There are similar figures of Avatāras in the Kailāsa temple. scooped out in the latter part of the eighth century, in the time of Kṛṣṇa I, uncle of Dantidurga. Among these is also the scene of the destruction of Kāliya by Kṛṣṇa.</p>
<p>There is an Inscription in a cave at Pabhosa, about 32 miles south-west of Allahabad, which probably had a human figure. above and runs thus: &ldquo;The maker of the images of Sri-Kṛṣṇa andthe milk-maids&rdquo;. The date is uncertain, but the Inscription is referred to the seventh or eighth century by Bühler<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>.</p>

<p>1.Vide my &lsquo;Peep into the Early History of India&rsquo;, JBBRAS, Vol. XX. p. 305;</p>
<p>[=Volume I of this Edition, p. 48 N. B. U.]</p>
<p>At Sirpur in the Raipur district, C. P.. over the front of a shrine-door there is a sculpture of Viṣṇu or Nārāyaṇa reclining on the folds of the serpent Śeṣa, and from his navel springs a lotus on which is seated Brahmā. Down the two outer sides of the shrinedoor are some of the incarnations of Viṣṇu , one of which is that of Rāma and another of Buddha, whose image is in the usual meditative attitude. The temple belongs probably to the eighth century².</p>
<p>At Osia, 32 miles north of Jodhpur, there is an old temple adjoining to the house of the local Jahagirdar. On two pilasters. projecting from the shrine into the Sabhāmaṇḍapa, are two images of deities both seated on Garuḍa. Both have four hands, but one. of them holds a conch-shell, the discus, the mace and the lotus, and the other bears a plough-share and a mace in his two hands, the other two being empty. The last has his head canopied by a five-hooded serpent. They are apparently Vāsudeva and Saṁkarṣaṇa. The temple cannot be later than the ninth century³.</p>
<p>In a work called Dharmaparīkṣā, Amitagati, the author, who was a Digambara Jaina, says that there were according to the legendary lore current among the Jainas sixty-three eminent men: the twelve supreme sovereigns, the twenty-four Arhats (Jinas), and nine Rāmas, nine Keśavas, and the nine enemies of these mine. The last of the Viṣṇus ( Keśavas) was the son of Vāsudeva, and his Brāhmaṇa devotees call him the pure, the supreme being. They say: &ldquo;He who meditates upon the god Viṣṇu, who is allpervading, a whole without parts, indestructible and unchangeable, who frees a man from old age and death, is free from misery&rdquo;.He is traditionally known to have ton forms or incarnations. These ten forms are the same as mentioned in the Varāha and AgniPurāṇas<sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup> and which are now generally accepted. Thus Buddha had come to be recognised as an incarnation of Viṣṇu before</p>

If the approximate date assigned to the temple at Sirpur is correct, Buddha must have been admitted into the Brāhmaṇicpantheon before the eighth century. Amitagati also speaks of the mighty Viṣṇu having become a cowherd in Nanda&rsquo;s Gokula and of the all-knowing, all-pervading protector of the world (Rāma) as being oppressed by the fire. of separation from Sitä like a mortal lover¹.</p>
<p>Hence, we have evidence of the existence of the cult of Viṣṇu, principally in accordance with the mode professed by the Bhāgavatas from the fourth to the eleventh century. The doctrine of the incarnations had also become an article of ordinary faith, and the founder of Buddhism and the first Tirthaṁkara of the Jainas also came later to be recognised as incarnations of Viṣṇu.</p>
<p>XIII. The Cult of Rāma.</p>
<p>§ The architectural remains passed under review contain only figures of the incarnations of Viṣṇu and are not to be taken. as proving the existence of the cult of any of these incarnations. But at the present day the cult of Rāmaexists over a pretty wide area. In the temples and other religious structures hitherto noticed, there is none dedicated to his worship nor any flag-staff like those erected in honour of Janārdana or Vāsudeva-Kṛṣṇa. Rāma, however, was considered as an incarnation of Viṣṇu even in very early times. There are passages in the Rāmayaṇa pointing to this, but there is good reason to believe that they are spurious or interpolated. But the passage in the Nārāyaṇīya, which we have. frequently referred to, contains his name, and so do all the Purāṇas that have been noticed. These in themselves are not sufficient to enable us to determine approximately the period in which he came to be regarded as an incarnation. But in the tenth chapter of the Raghuvaṁśa the story of the birth of Rāma is preceded by the usual appeal to Viṣṇu or Nārāyaṇa lying on the body of the great serpent, with Lakṣmi rubbing his feet, in the milky ocean and his promise to be born as a son of Daśaratha for the destruction of Rāvaṇa.</p>

<p>[R. G. Bhandarker&rsquo;s Works, Vol. IV.]</p>
<p>Amitagati also speaks in 1014 A. D., as we have seen<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>, of Rāma&rsquo;s being regarded as the all-knowing, all-pervading protector of the world. The Vāyu-Purāṇa, which is the earliest work of that class, must have been written about the fifth century; so that the belief in Rāma&rsquo;s being an incarnation of Viṣṇu existed. in all probability in the early centuries of the Christian Era. But there is no mention of his name in such a work as that of Patañjali, nor is there any old Inscription in which it occurs. Amarasiṁha, too, has no place for him in his scheme of Brāhmaṇic gods. These circumstances, as well as those mentioned above, show that, though he was regarded as an Avatāra, there was no cult in his honour. Still, as depicted by Vālmīki, Rāma was a high-souled hero, and poets, including those nameless ones. who wrote Purāṇas in the names of old Ṛṣi, particularly Bhavabhūti, still more highly exalted his character. Rāma, therefore, won a place in the heart of the Indian people, and that must have. soon led to the foundation of the cult. But when this took place it is difficult to say. Madhva or Ānandatīrtha, the founder of a sect to be noticed hereafter, is represented to have brought the image of Digvijaya Rāma from Badarikāśrama and sent Naraharitīrtha to Jagannātha about the year 1264 A. D<sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>., to bring what was called the original idols of Rāma and Sits. The cult of Rāma, therefore, must have come into existence about the eleventh century. There exist manuals giving the modes of worship by means of Mantras or formulae and magic circles, like those proscribed in the Sātvata-Saṁhitāfor the worship of Vāsudeva. The ceremony in connection with his birth on the 9th of the bright half of Caitra is given in his Vratakhaṇḍa<sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>.&quot;)by Hemādri, who flourished in the thirteenth century. That writer, as well as Vṛddhā-Hārita⁴, gives the modes of worshipping him as an incarnation along with others on certain occasions, so that it appears that his worship as an incarnation has been of a longer duration than that based on terms of equality with Vāsudeva-Kṛṣṇa.</p>
<p>Twenty-four images, differing from each other in the order in which the four objects, viz., the conch-shell, disous, mace</p>

<p>and lotus, are placed in the four hands of the principal god Vāsudeva or Viṣṇu, are mentioned by both those authors, and the twenty-four names¹ corresponding to the twenty-four images. Keśava, Nārāyaṇa, Govinda, etc., which include those of the four Vyūhas, are repeated by us at the beginning of every ceremony that we perform at the present day; that is, obeisance is made to the twenty-four forms of the god by using the word Namaḥ (salutations) after the dative of each of the names, and the sense is &lsquo;Saluations to Keśava, Nārāyaṇa, etc,&rsquo;. The name of Rāma, however, is not included in them, while two other Avatāras, Narasiṁha and Vāmana, are mentioned. Every Śrāddha ceremony is wound up by the expression May Janārdana-Vāsudeva, who is a form of the ancestors, or the father, grandfather and great grandfather, be satisfied by this act&rdquo;. All this shows that Vāsudevism has penetrated into every one of our ordinary ceremonies, which include a repetition even of Vedic Mantras, while this is not at all the case. with the cult of Rāma, which is, therefore of a modern growth.</p>
<p>There is a work, entitled the Adhyātma-Rāmāyaṇa, which Ekanātha<sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>, a Mahārāṣṭra saint, who flourished in the sixteenth century, calls a modern treatise, composed of excerpts from older writings and having no pretence to be considered as emanating from the old Ṛṣis. The object of this work throughout has. been to set forth the divinity of Rāma. The first book of it com- prises what is called Rāmahṛdaya, which which was narrated to Hanūmat by Sītā, who says that as the original Prakṛti, she does every thing and did all the deeds mentioned in the Rāmayaṇa, while Rāma as the only existing soul is inactive, unchangeable and blessed, and is a mere witness of her deeds. After she has concluded, Rāma explains the threefold nature of the knowing spirit, viz., (1) the original, (2) that conditioned by Buddhi or</p>

<p>finiteintelligence, and (3) the appearances, the last two of which are fictitious. The fifth canto of the last book is styled Rāmagītā, which is meant to correspond to the Bhagavadgītāof Vāsudeva and which is narrated by Rāma to Lakṣmaṇa, who takes the place of Arjuna. The doctrine is thoroughly adualistic as that of the previous portion. The world and the individual soul are illusory, and one spirit alone exists. There is another book called Rāmagitā published in Madras, which represents itself to be contained in a larger work called Sattvapārāyaṇa and is composed of eighteen chapters like the genuine Bhagavadgītā. It is narrated. to Hanūmat by Rāma. In the beginning it professes itself to be based on the one hundred and eight Upanṣiads, some of which are manifestly very rocent. This work, therefore, must be a very modern compilation. Thus the works designed to give importance to Rāma as a religious teacher are of recent origin.</p>
<p>XIV. Vāsudevism or Vaiṣṇavism in the South,</p>
<p>§ 44. We have seen that Saṁkarṣaṇa and Vāsudeva had come to be worshipped as gods in the Maratha country by about the first century B. C. The cult must have spread further south up to the Tamil country, but there is no evidence to show at what time it was introduced there. The Bhāgavata-Purāṇa (Book XI, chap. 5, vv. 38-40) says, in the usual prophetic. style, that in the Kali age there will be found men here. and there devoted to Nārāyaṇa, but in large numbers. in the Draviḍa country, where flow the rivors Tamraparṇī, Kāverīand others, and that those who drink the water of these rivers will mostly be pure-hearted devotees of Vāsudeva. When the Purāṇa goes out of its beaten track to make such a statement as this, the fame of the devotees of Vāsudeva, who had flourished in the Tamil country, must have spread over either parts of India. when the Purāṇa was compiled. The Purāṇa was regarded as sacred in the thirteenth century, when Ānandatīrtha, who flourished between about 1199 and 1278 A.D., places it on the same level as the Mahābhārata and devotes a treatise to the determination of its drift, as to that of the latter. About the same time Bopadeva prepared an abstract of it at the request of the councillor Hemādri. The Bhāgavata, therefore, must have been composed at the least</p>
<p>two centuries before Ānandatīrtha to account for the reputation of the sacred character which it acquired in his time. It cannot be very much older, for its style often looks modern and in copying from the older Purāṇas it falls into mistakes, such as the one pointed out by me in another place¹. The Draviḍa devotees, therefore, noticed in the Bhāgavata, must have mostly flourished before the eleventh century.</p>
<p>These devotees, who are known by the name of Ālvārs, are generally reckoned as twelve in number and are divided into three classes by S. Krishnaswami Aiyengar<sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup> in accordance with the received chronology which he follows to determine. their sequence, though in itself it assigns a preposterously high antiquity to them.

<p>The date of the first, ordinarily given, is B. C. 4203 and of the last, B. C. 2706, and the others range between these two. Not only are these dates fanciful, but even the sequence shown above is unreliable. Krishnaswami places the last in the earlier half of the eighth century A. D., and all the preceding ones impliedly before that date. But there is distinct evidence to show that Kulaśekhara flourished much later. He was a king of Travancore, and one ofthe works composed by him styled Mukundamāla contains a verse from the Bhāgavata-Purāṇa (XI. 2. 36)<sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.Early History of the Deccan (Second Edition), pp. 32-33. [=Vol. III, p. 46 of this Edition-N. B. U.]</p>
<p>Again in an Inscription on a tablet, existing in a temple at Narēgal in the Dharwar district, translated by Dr. Fleet<sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>, it is stated that Permāḍi of the Sinda dynasty vanquished Kulaśekharāṅka, besieged Chaṭṭa, pursued Jayakśin, and seized upon the royal power of Poysala and invested Dhorasamudra, the capital of the Poysala dynasty. In another Inscription<sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>this Permāḍi is represented to be a vassal of Jagadekamalla II, whose dates range between A. D. 1138 and 1150. While the former was in power as Mahāmaṇḍaleśvara in the seventh year of Jagadekamalla, i. e., in A. D. 1144, a certain grant was made by a body of sellers of betel. leaves and nuts. The Kulaśekharāṅka, mentioned as being. vanquished by this Permāḍi, must be a prince reigning on the western coast, as the others, Jayakeśin, the Kadamba prince of Goa, the Hoysala king, and so forth, were. Putting this statement and the quotation from the Bhāgavata-Purāṇa together, it appears. highly probable that the Ālvār Kulaśekhara lived in the first half of the twelfth century. The sequence, therefore, given above cannot be implicitly believed in.</p>
<p>Still it may be admitted that the earliest Ālvārs flourished about the time of the revival of Brāhamaṇism and Hinduism in the North, which extended up to the Maratha country, as wel have shown from Inscriptions and antiquarian remains, and must have extended still farther to the South. The earliest Ālvārs may be placed before about the fifth or sixth century, but there is nothing to show that Vaiṣṇavism had not penetrated to the Tamil country earlier, i. e., about the first century. But an impetus, such as the rise of the Ālvārs indicates, could in all probability come. only from the energy of the revival. The hostile relations into which the Ālvārs and the Śaiva saints, Nāyanmārs, came with the Buddhists and Jainas, lend support to the view we have. advocated.</p>
<p>TheĀlvārs composed mostly in Tamil, what are called Prabandhas or songs in praise of the deity full of piety and devotion and</p>
<p>containing also religious truth. They are considered as very sacred and spoken of as the Vaiṣṇava Veda. The reverence paid to the Ālvārs is very great, and their images are placed by the side of the god representing Viṣṇuor Nārāyaṇa in some form and worshipped.It may be noted here that Kulaśekhara-Ālvār&rsquo;s favourite deity was Rāma, the son of Daśaratha.</p>
<p>XV. Rāmānuja.</p>
<p>§ 45. There were two classes of teachers among the Vaiṣṇavaof the South, viz, the Ālvārs and the Ācāryas. The former devoted themselves to the culture of the feeling of love and devotion for Viṣṇu or Nārāyaṇa, and composed songs, while the object of the latter was to carry on disputations and controversies and seek to establish their own theories and creeds. The first class we have already noticed briefly. The first of the second class appears to have been Nāthamuni. His successor was Yāmunācārya or Yāmunamuni. Rāmānuja succeeded Yāmunamuni, one of whose last directions to his successor was to compose a commentary on Bādārayana&rsquo;s Brahmasūtra. The necessity for such a work was felt by the leaders of the Vaiṣṇava falth, since they found it not. possible to maintain the doctrine of Bhakti or love in the face of the theory of Advaita or Monism of Spirit set up by Śaṁkarācārya as based upon the Brahmasūtras and the Upaniṣads.</p>
<p>During the period of the revival of Brāhmanism and Hinduism. there was such a fermentation of thought as that which existed when Buddhism, Jainism and other heterodox systems on the one. hand, and Vāsudevism on the other, arose. The present fermentation, however, did not rest on independent thought, but was based upon the sacred works that had been handed down from the earlier times. The Pali Buddhism made way for the Sanskrit Mahāyānism, and against this last, controversies were carried on by the School of Nyāya founded by Gautama and by the Mimāṁsakas, especially by Śabarsvāmin and Kumārilabhaṭṭa. But the Mimāṁsakas attacked not only the Buddhists, but the Aupaniṣadas, or a school of thought based upon the Upaniṣads.They maintained the efficacy of the sacrificial religion alone and denied it to the faith and practices of the latter school. The efforts of this. school were therefore directed towards the maintenance of their position that their system alone can lead to supreme bliss.</p>
<p>The person who appeared prominently on the scene on this occasion was Gauḍapādācārya and some time after him the pupil of his pupil, Śaṁkarācārya. The theory that this latter set up, was that there exists one spirit alone, and the feelings of individuality and other attributes of the animal spirit and the variety of the inanimate world, owe their origin to a principle of illusion, and are consequently unreal. This doctrine left no room for the exercise of love and piety in the world of reality, though its followers allow it in the ordinary illusive condition of the human souls, and therefore it laid the axe at the root of Vaiṣṇavism. The great wish of the Southern leaders of the latter faith was the overthrow of this doctrine of illusion, or Mãyã, on the same Aupaniṣada grounds on which it was set up. And this wish of his predecessor was carried out by Rāmānuja, and henceforward every Vaiṣṇava system, and even., in one or two cases, Śaiva systems had to tack on Aupaniṣada or Vedāntic theories to their own doctrines.</p>
<p>§ 46. Rāmānuja was born in Śaka 938 corresponding to 1016. or 1017 A. D. In his youth he lived at Kāñcīpura or Conjeevaram and was a pupil of Yādavaprakāśa, who was an Advaita philosopher and therefore professed spiritual monism. Rāmānuja whose inclinations were towards Vaiṣṇavism, was dissatisfied with the teachings of his master, and the ultimate result was his seperation from him. He applied himself to the study of the Prabandhas of the Ālvārs and drank in their spirit. When he became a successor of Yāmunācārya, he lived at Śrīraṅgam, near Trichinopoly, and did his life&rsquo;s work there. He is said to have gone on a pilgrimage to the noted holy places of Upper India. In the latter. years of his age he was subjected to persecution by the Cols Fprince of his time, who wanted him to renounce Vaiṣṇavism for Śaivism, in consequence of which he took refuge in 1096 A. D. in the dominions of the Hoysala Yādava princes, who reigned in Mysore and whose capital was Dvarasamudra, the modern Halebid. There he converted Vitthala Deva, popularly called Biṭṭi Deva, Biṭṭi being, in all likelihood, the corruption of Viṭṭhala or Viṭṭhi. This took place in 1098 A. D. Viṭṭhala Deva was not the reigning prince, but administered some of the frontier provinces in the name of his brother Ballāla, who was on the</p>
<p>throne¹. Viṭṭhala Deva or Biṭṭi Deva was called Viṣṇuvardhana after his conversion to Vaiṣṇavism. This is the ordinary account. But what appeurs true is that his name was originally Viṣṇu, which was corrupted into Biṭṭu or Biṭṭi in the Kanarese, the vernacular of the district, so that his original name Biṭṭi Deva is the same as Viṣṇu Deva which he is represented to have assumed after his conversion. He reigned from 1104 to 1141 A. D<sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>. Rāmānuja composed the following works: Vedāntasāra,—Vedārthasaṁgraha, Vedāntadīpa, and commentaries, or Bhāṣyas, on the Brahṁasūtras and the Bhagavadgītā³.</p>
<p>§ 47.The Vedāntic theory, or the theory based upon the Brahmasūtras and the Upaniṣads, which Rāmānuja set up to provide scope for the feeling of Bhakti, or love for God and the spirit of worship, was that there are three eternal principles, the individual or animal soul (Cit), the insensate world (Acit), and the Supreme Soul (Īśvara).</p>
<p>There are Upanṣiad texts to support this, and one of them is that in the SU. (I. 12) to the effect that all Brahman, regarded as composed of the enjoyer or sufferer, the objects. from which enjoyment or suffering springs, and the controller or mover, is threefold. But the Brahmasūtras lay it down. on the authority of the Upanṣiad that Brahman is the material. as well as the efficient cause of the world. To make this possible. in his system, Rāmānuja resorts to the passage in BU. of the Mādhyaṁdina school, beginning from III. 7. 3, in which the Supreme Soul is stated to be the internal controller (Antaryāmin) of the individual soul as well as of the external world. The form that he gives to his theory is that the individual soul and the insensate world are the attributes of the Supreme Soul. They constitute his body, as stated in the Upanṣiad also, and thus, they with the controlling inward Supreme Soul constitute one entity called Brahman, just as the body and the in-dwelling soul constitute the human being.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.See KrishnaswamīAiyangar&rsquo;s paper in No. 8 of the magazine Viśiṣṭādvaitin for most of these facts.</p>
<p>3.See Krishnaswamī&rsquo;s paper alluded to al above.</p>
<p>Before creation the body of the Supreme Soul exists in a subtle form, and when creation takes place, it develops in the form of the existing universe; thus Brahman is the material cause of the external world. It is also the efficient cause, when, as the internal controlling soul, it wills to creat. The subtle form of the insensate world is the Prakṛti, a term first invented by the original author of the Sāṁkhya doctrine. It develops under the guidance of the in-dwelling Supreme Spirit until the mundane egg is produced. The successive stages of Mahat, Ahaṁkāra, etc., are like those of the Sāṁkhya system, which has been adopted by the Purāṇas also in the account of the creation. And the creation after the production of the mundane egg is also made by Īśvara as the internal controller of Brahmadeva, Dakṣa, etc.</p>
<p>Īśvara or God is free from all faults or defects. He is eternal, pervades all living and non-living things, is the internal controller. of all, is pure joy or blessedness, is possessed of the auspicious qualities of knowledge, power, etc., is the creator, protector and destroyer of the world, and is resorted to by those who are afflicted, who wish to gain knowledge, who seek to attain a certain end, and who are already enlightened¹. He confers the fourfold fruit of existence². He is possessed of a wonderful celestial body of unsurpassable beauty and has for his consorts Lakṣmi³, Bhū (the earth), and Līlā(sport).</p>
<p>This Īśvara appears in five different modes :—</p>
<p>I. Para or the highest, in which mode, Nārāyaṇa, called also Para-Brahman and Para-Vāsudeva, lives in a city called Vaikuṇṭha, which is guarded by certain persons and which has door-keepers; seated in a pavilion of gems on a couch in the form of the serpent Śeṣa, placed on a throne having the eight legs, Dharma and others; attended by Śrī, Bhū and Līlā; holding the celestial weapons, conch-shell, discus, and others; adorned. with celestial ornaments, such as a tiara and others: possessed of numberless auspicious attributes, knowledge, power, and others;and his presence being enjoyed by the eternal spirits, such as Ananta, Garuḍa, Viṣvaksena, and others, and by delivered souls.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.These are the four, Ārta, Jijn̄āsu, atc., mentioned in BhG. (7. 16).</p>
<p>2.Artha, or worldly prosperity, Kāma, or the objects of desire, Dharma, or religious merit, and Mokṣa, or final deliverance, are the four objects of existence.</p>
<p>3.From the Tattvatrayaof Lokācārya.</p>
<p>II. Vyūha, in which the Para himself has assumed four forma, Vāsudeva, Saṁkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha for convenience of worship, and for purposes such as creation, etc. Of these. Vāsudeva is possessed of the six qualities; Saṁkarṣaṇa has two, viz., omniscience and sustaining power! Pradyumna two, viz. controlling power and unchangeableness, and Aniruddha, creative power and all-overcoming prowess¹.</p>
<p>III. Vibhava, which mode consists of the ten Avatāras, fish, tortoise, etc.</p>
<p>IV. Antaryāmin, in which mode he dwells in the heart and is to be seen by Yogins and accompanies the individual souls even when they go to heaven or hell.</p>
<p>V. Idols or images set up in houses, villages, towns, etc., made up of a material chosen by the worshipper, in which he dwells. with a body not made up of matter<sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Other authorities leave out Vāsudeva from the Vyūhas and have the other three only. The Arthapañcaka has another form. of the Antaryāmin, in which form he dwells in everything and rules over all, is bodiless, all-pervading and store of all good attributes, and is called Viṣṇu, Nārāyaṇa, Vāsudeva³, etc.</p>
<p>Self-consciousness, knowledge, union as a soul with a body, agency, are attributes common to the supreme and individual souls<sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>. The latter is self-illumined, joyous, eternal, atomic, imperceptible to the senses, unthinkable, devoid of parts, unchangeable, the substratum of knowledge, subject to God&rsquo;s control, depending on God&rsquo;s existence for his own existence and an attribute of God<sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup>. This description of the individual soul differs agreat deal from that of SŚaṁkarācārya, who attributes no agency or substantiality to it; and the dependence on God in a variety of ways cannot, of course, be thought of under the doctrine of spiritual monism. The soul&rsquo;s being an atom is also denied by Śamkara&rsquo;s school and various others. The souls are many and are divided into:—</p>

<p>3.See my Report on the Search for Sanskrit Manuscripts during 1883-84, p. 69, [Volume II of this Edition, p. 184-N. B. U.]</p>
<p>(1) Baddha or tied down to the circle of existences from Brahmadeva to the vilest worm, as well as the vegetable souls;</p>
<p>(2) Mukta or finally delivered; and</p>
<p>(3) Nitya or eternal.</p>
<p>Of the first class, those that are rational, that is, not brutes or vegetables, are of two sorts: (1) desirous of enjoyment; (2) desirous of final deliverance. Of those that are desirous of enjoyment, some devote themselves to the acquisition of wealth and the satisfaction of carnal desires, and others, who seek to attain the happiness of heaven, perform all rites and sacrifices, make pilgrimages to holy places and give in charity. Some of these devote themselves to Bhagavat and others to other deities.</p>
<p>Some of those who desire final deliverance seek the consciousness of their pure soul only (Kevalin), and others eternal bliss. Of these latter, some are Bhaktas, who seek to attain God by resorting to Bhakti with all its details, having first of all studied the Vedas and acquainted themselves with the Vedānta and the philosophy of rites (Karman). The three upper orders alone can practise Bhakti, but not the Sūdras. Others are Prapannas, who are those who take refuge in God, feeling themselves poor and helpless. Of Prapannas, some seek the first three objects of life, while the rest, finding no happiness in these, renouncing everything worldly, desire eternal bliss ( Mokṣa) alone, and, seeking the advice of a preceptor and acquiring from him the impulse to action, fling themselves on the will of God, not having the power of going through the Bhakti process and being helpless. This Prapatti or surrender to God can be practised by all orders, including Śūdras<sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup>.</p>
<p>What are necessary for the efficacy of the method of Bhakti,</p>
<p>are Karmayoga or the performance of actions, and Jñānayoga or the acquisition of knowledge Karmayoga is the performance of all acts, rites and ceremonies without regard for the fruit resulting from them. These are the worship of the deity, practice of austerity, pilgrimage to holy places, giving in charity and sacrifices.</p>
<p>This Karmayoga purifies the soul and leads to Jñānayoga, or acquisition of knowledge. This knowledge consists in seeing oneself as distinct from Prakṛti, or matter, and as an attribute of God himself (Śeṣa). This Jñānayoga leads to Bhakti.</p>
<p>Bhaktiyoga, or the method of Bhakti, consists in continuous meditation accompanied by the practice of the eight Yoga processes, Yama, Niyama, etc. This is to be attained. by (1) the purification of the body by the use of unpolluted and unprohibited food, (2) chastity, (3) constant practice, (4) the performance of five great rites and ceremonies according to one&rsquo;s means, (5) virtues such as truth, uprightness, compassion, obarity, non-destruction of life, (6) hopefulness or absence of despondency, and (7) absence of elatedness. Bhakti, as promoted by these seven means, assumes the form of actually seeing (God) and produces the final mental perception.</p>
<p>Prapatti consists in the resolution to yield, the avoidance of opposition¹, a faith that God will protect, acceptance of him as saviour or praying him to save and sense of helplessness resulting in throwing one&rsquo;s whole soul on him². Prapatti thus comes to selfsurrender<sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The Arthspañcaka mentions a fifth way called Acāryābhimanāyoga, which is for one who is unable to follow any of the others, and consists in surrendering oneself to an Ācārya or preceptor and being guided by him in everything. The preceptor goesthrough all that is necessary to effect his pupil&rsquo;s deliverance as a mother takes medicine herself to cure an infant.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.The two expressions thus translated have also been otherwise oxplained as bearing good-will to all and the absence of ill-will.</p>
<p>2.There is another ronding hare which should be translated as&quot;throwing one-self upon him and a feeling of helplessness.&rdquo; Thus there are six constituents of Prapatti. These are;(1)Ānukūlyasya saṁkalpaḥ (2) prātikūlyasya varjanam, (3) rakṣiṣyantīti viśvāso (4) gōptṛvavaraṇaṁ tathā, (5)ātmanikṣepa - (6) karpaṇneṣaḍvidhāśaraṇāgatiḥ.</p>
<p>Sixteen modes of worship are to be practised by the devotees of Viṣṇu, as stated in a passage quoted from the Padma-Purāṇa by a recent writer of the Rāmānuja school. Eight of these are the same. as those included in the nine modes of Bhakti enumerated in al previous Section<sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>as mentioned in the Bhāgavata-Purāṇa, Sakhya, or friendship or companionship, boing omitted. The other eight are : (1) imprinting the marks of the conch-shell and the discus. and other weapons of Hari on the body; (2) the making of a vertical mark on the forehead; (3) repeating of Mantras on the occasion; (4) drinking the water used in washing the feet of Hari; (5) the eating of the offerings of cooked food made to him; (6) doing service to his devotees: (7) the observance of fast on the 11th of the bright and dark halves of each lunar month; (8) laying Tulasi leaves on the idol of Hari.</p>
<p>A text from the Hārītasmṛti is also quoted giving nine modes of worship (Bhakti), three of which are common to it with the Bhāgavata-Purāṇa. The other six are the same as the eight in the above, the first two being combined and the third being omitted. The vertical mark on the forehead mentioned above consists of two lines made with white earth and a connecting cross line at the bottom, with, in the middle, a yellow line made with turmeric powder or a red line composed of the same material reddened by mixing it with lime.</p>
<p>§ 48. In Northern India there are not many followers of Rāmānuja; in Southern India there is a very large number. There are two Schools among them, known by the names of Vaḍakalai or northern learning, and Tenkalai or southern learning. The essential difference between them is brought out by the different illustrations² that they give of the connection between God&rsquo;s grace and man&rsquo;s effort in bringing about final deliverance. The illustration. used by the former, or the northern, is that of a female monkey and her cub. The cub has to hold fast its mother on the abdomen tobe conveyed to a safe place. The southerners use the illustration of the cat and its kittens. The female cat catches hold of the kitten, without any effort on its part, and takes it to a place of safety. In the first case the doctrine is that the process of deliverance must begin with an act of a person seeking it. In the other case the process begins with God himself.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>2.The following remarks are based on Viśiṣṭādvaitin, Vol. I, No. 8, pp. 200ff., and Mr. Govindacharya&rsquo;s article, JRAS, 1910, pp. 1103 ff.</p>
<p>In keeping with this distinction is the idea of Prapatti or self-surrender held by the two Sects. The first maintains that Prapatti is one of the ways resorted to by the devotee and begins with him. The southern School holds that it is not one of the ways, but it is. a frame of mind which characterises all those who seek absolution, and reject all other ways in favour of this. Those who resort to other ways have not arrived at the right mood which leads to God. When a soul is in this frame of mind, God himself takes. entire possession of him, while by the other ways, man, as it were, makes approaches towards him. The Vaḍakalai lays down that Prapatti is for those who cannot follow other ways, such as Karmayoga, Jñānayoga and Bhaktiyoga, while the Tenkalai holds that it is necessary for all, whether able or not, to follow the other ways. The first School says that one should give himself up to God when one finds other ways, which have been resorted to, to be fruitless. The second holds that self-abandonment to God. should precede the trial of other ways Self-assertiveness is the characteristic of the first, but it is forbidden by the second and self- abandonment is enjoined. The northerners say that the six ways of Prapatti or self-surrender given above are preliminaries to the Prapatti which results from them. The southerners say that Prapatti must take place first and then the six follow as results.</p>
<p>The nothern School teaches that a person belonging to an inferior caste should be treated well only so far as conversation by words is concerned. The southerners say that they should be. admitted to an equal treatment in all respects and no distinction be made. The syllable Om should be omitted from the eight- syllabled Mantra, according to the Vaḍakalai, when taught to others than Brāhmaṇas; the Tenkalai does not make this distinction and provides for the teaching of the whole Mantra in the same form to all<sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup>.</p>
<p>§ 49. It will be seen from the short summery here given that Rāmānuja derives his metaphysical doctrines from texts in the Upaniṣads and from the Brahmasūtras, while his theory of the external world is that adopted by the Purāṇas and based on the twenty-four elements of the Sāṁkhya system. His Vaiṣṇavism is the Vāsudevism of the old Pāñcarātra system combined with the Nārāyaṇa and Viṣṇu elements. The last name does not occur. often in the literature of his school. The most prominent name is NNārāyaṇa, though Vāsudeva takes his proper place when the Supreme Soul and the Vyūhas are spoken of. The name of Gopālakṛṣṇa is conspicuous by its absence, and Ramānuja&rsquo;s system is free from that repulsive form which Vaiṣṇavism assumes when Rādhāand other cowherdesses are introduced. Rāma too does not appear to be a favourite deity. Rāmānuja&rsquo;s doctrines as to the way of reaching the Supreme Soul are the same as, or amplified forms of, those in the Bhagavadgītā. But in this system Bhakti is reduced to the form of a continuous meditation on the Supreme Soul. It thus corresponds to the Upāsanãs, or meditations, described by Bādarāyaṇa, and does not mean a boundless love for God, as the word is commonly understood, though the meditation that is enjoined implies tacitly a feeling of love.</p>
<p>The tendency of Rāmānuja&rsquo;s system seems to be to give an exclusive Brāhmaṇic form to the traditional method of Bhakti, or devotion to God, and this is distinctly seen in the doctrines of the Vaḍakalai; while Tenkalai, or southern learning, is more liberal and so shapes the doctrines of the system as to make them applicable to Śūdras also. But we shall find the Śūdras asserting themselves when we come to the disciples of Rāmānanda and to the Marāṭha saints and teachers, Nāmdeva and Tukārāma.</p>
<p>The fifth Upāya, or way to God, given in the Arthapañcaka, of surrendering oneself completely to a teacher or preceptor, doing nothing oneself and the preceptor doing all that is necessary for one&rsquo;s redemption, seems suspicious. It has a striking resemblance to the Christian doctrine of Christ suffering, or in the words of our author, going through the processes necessary for redemption, the believer doing nothing but putting complete faith in his saviour. If the prevalence of Christianity in and before the time of Rāmānuja in the country about Madras is a proved fact, this</p>
<p>doctrine as well as some of the finer points in the theory of Prapatti may be traced to the influence of Christianity. Rāmānuja&rsquo;s system is known by the name of Śrīsaṁpradāya or the tradition springing from Śrī.</p>
<p><strong>XVI Madhva or Ānandatīrtha</strong></p>
<p>§ 50. The great object of the Vaiṣṇava teachers of the eleventh century and upwards was to confute the theory of Māyā, or the unreality of the world, and establish the doctrine of Bhakti, or love and faith, on a secure basis Rāmānuja effected this by the system which he promulgated and which we have already noticed. But in order to reconcile his doctrine with the theory set forth in the Brahmasūtras on the basis of the Upanṣiad, that God is the material as well as the efficient cause of the world, he propounded the doctrine of God&rsquo;s being a composite person, having for his body the individual souls and the inanimate world. Even this Madhva considered objectionable as having a tendency to depreciate the independent majesty of God, and therefore he denies his being the material cause of the world. All the Sūtras of Bādarāyaṇa which set forth that doctrine have been interpreted by him. in an entirely different way. Probably he would have set aside the Brahmsūtras altogether, but he could not do so, since the work had acquired an uncontested authoritativeness as regards. religious truth before his time. He had therefore to show that his system did not go against the Brahmsūtras, and therefore accepted them and interpreted them in almost a fantastic manner. Texts from the Upanişads, too, which do not agree with his doctrines, he treats similarly.</p>
<p>In opposition to the pure monism of Śaṁkara and the qualified. monism of Rāmānuja, Ānandatīrthasets forth five eternal distinotions or individualities, viz., the distinction between</p>
<p>(1) God and the individual spirit,</p>
<p>(2) God and the inanimate world,</p>
<p>(3) the individual spirit and the inanimate world,</p>
<p>(4) one individual spirit and another,</p>
<p>(5) one inanimate object and another.</p>
<p>According to the Madhvavijaya, or the history of the triumphs of Madhva, by Nārāyaṇa, the son of Trivikrama, there was in the</p>
<p>town of Rajatapīṭha a family known by the name of Madhyageha.Mādhva&rsquo;s father was called Madhyagehabhaṭṭa¹; the name given. to Madhva after his birth was Vāsudeva. After Vāsudeva had received the usual education of a Brāhmaṇa, he was initiated as an anchorite by Acyutaprekṣācarya who thus became his Guru. After his initiation he went to Badarikāśrama in the Himālaya and brought back the idols of Digvijaya Rāmaand Vedavyāsa. He was raised to the seat of high priest in the presenceof kings.</p>
<p>Ānandatīrṭha went from country to country, putting down the advocates of the doctrine of Māyāand others, established the Vaiṣṇava creed. He had for his pupils Padmanābhatīrṭha, Naraharitīrṭha, Mādhavatīrṭha, and Akṣobhyattīrṭha. Naraharitīrṭha was sent to Jagannātha in Orissa to bring the original idols of Rāma and Sītā. Ānandatīrtha&rsquo;s other names. were Pūrṇaprajña and Madhyamandāra, or wish-giving tree of the family of Madhya.</p>
<p>The date of his death given in the list preserved in several of the Maṭhas, or establishments of the sect, is Śaka 1119, and as he lived for seventy-nine years, the death of his birth has been given as Śaka 1040. But these statements are open to serious doubts. There is an Inscription in the Kūrmeśvara temple at Śrīkūrmam in the Chicacole Taluka of the Ganjam District, in which Naraharitīrṭha is represented to have constructed a temple and placed in it an idol of Yogānandanarasiṁha in the year Śaka 1203<sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup>.The first person therein mentioned is Puruṣottamatīrṭha, who is the same as Acyutaprekṣa<sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup>, then his pupil Ānandatīrṭha, and the last is Narabaritīrṭha, the pupil of Ānandatīrtha. This Narabaritīrṭha is considered by some, to have been the ruler of Orissa. But this arises from a confusion between him and a king bearing the same name, in the slightly modified form of Narasiṁha, who was the actual ruler of the country from about Śaka 1191 to</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.Kallianpur in the Udipi Taluka of the district of South Kanara is stated to be the birth-place of Madhva. It was probably the same as the Rajatapīṭhaof the Madhvavijnya. (Imp. Gas, Vol. XIV, page 314.)</p>
<p>1225. He is mentioned in an Inscription at Śrīkūrmam of Naraharitīrtha himself, hearing the date Śaka 1215, which is represented as the eighteenth year of the king&rsquo;s reign<sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup>. He was Narasiṁha II, and was the prince panegyrised in a work on rhetoric, the Ekāvali². Naraharitīrtha&rsquo;s other dates gathered from other Inscriptions range between Śaka 1186 and 1212<sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup>. All these epigraphical records confirm the truth of the tradition that Naraharitīrtha was sent by Ānandatīrtha to Orissa. He appears to have. hold a very high position there.</p>
<p>Now if Naraharitīrtha&rsquo;s active period extended from Śaka 1186 to 1215, his master could not have died in Śaka 1119, i. e., fully 67 years before. It seems, therefore, reasonable to take the date. given in Madhva&rsquo;s Mahābhāratatātparyanirṇaya, which is 4300 of the Kali age, to be the correct date of his birth. It corresponds to Śaka 1121, which, bearing in mind the fact that some use the current year of an era and some the past, we must regard as equivalent to Śaka 1119, the date given in the lists for Ānandatīrtha&rsquo;s death. But instead of taking it as the date of his death, we shall have to regard it as the date of his birth. He lived for 79 years according to the current account, so that his death must be placed in Śaka 1198⁴. The two dates may, therefore, be taken as settled.</p>
<p>Ānandatīrtha thus lived in the first three quarters of the thirteenth century. He was succeeded, according to the list, by Padmanabhatīrtha who held the pontificate for seven years, i, e., up. to Śaka 1205. He was succeeded by Naraharitīrtha who occupied. the pontifical seat for nine years, i, e., up to Śaka 1214, or, if we regard 1121 as the date of the first pontiff&rsquo;s birth according to the strict interpretation of the Kali date, up to Śaka 1216; and, as wel have seen, his latest date in the Inscriptions is Śaka 1215.</p>
<p>§ 51. The Mādhvas follow the method of Vaiśeṣikas and divide all existing things into the categories of substance, qualities, etc.,</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>2.See my note in Trivedi&rsquo;s edition of the work, BSS. [= Volume II of this Edition, pp. 139. N. B. U.]</p>
<p>4.This agrees with the tradition existing in the Maṭha at Phalmāru, near Mulki in South Canara, to the effect that Ānandatīrtha was born in Śaka 1119 and died in Śaka 1199, Ep. Ind., VI, p. 263, note.</p>
<p>with some modifications of their own¹. God is a substance. The supreme soul possesses innumerable or an infinite number of qualities. His functions are eight, viz., (1) creation, (2) protection, (3) dissolution, (4) controlling all things, (5) giving knowledge, (6) manifestation of himself, (7) tying beings down to the world, (8) redemption. He is omniscient, expressible by all words, and entirely different from the individual souls and the inanimate world. He possesses the holy form made up of knowledge, joy, etc., independent of every thing, and one only, assuming different forms. All his forms are his full manifestations, and he is identically the same with his incarnations in qualities, parts, and actions. Lakṣmīis distinct from the Supreme Soul, but entirely dependent on him. She is eternal and blessed (Makta) like the Supreme Soul and is his consort. She has various forms, but no material body, and is thus like the Supreme Soul, and like him ist expressible by all words. She possesses the same extension in space. and time as the Supreme Soul, i. e., is concomitant with him.</p>
<p>Jīvas or individual souls go through the usual succession of existences and are characterised by ignorance or other defects. They are innumerable individually, or as members of groups, such as Ṙjus<sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup> who are fit for attaining Brahmahood, and others who are fit for the attainment of the dignity of Rudra, Garuḍa, Asuras, or demons, etc. They are of three kinds: (1) fit for attaining final bliss, (2) always going through the circle of existences, and (3) fit for the conditon of darkness. The gods, Ṛṣis, and the manes, and the best of men, belong to the first class, ordinary men belong to the second class, and demons, ghosts, and the vilest of men, etc., to the the third class. All these individual souls are distinct from each other and from the Supreme Soul.</p>
<p>Creation begins when the Supreme Soul disturbs the equilibrium of the Prakṛti, which then develops into all the other principles of the Samkhya system, as modified by the Purāṇas, until the mundane egg is produced. Then placing the sentient and non-</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.This account of the system is abridged from a work called Madhvasiddhāntasāraby Padmanābhasūri, printed in Bombay by Javaji Dadaj irnayasagara Press, published at Kumbhakonam in Śaka 1815, corresponding to 1883 A. D. The tedious details are omitted.</p>
<p>sentient objects into his inside, he enters into the mundane egg. Then, at the end of a thousand celestial years he produces from his navel a lotus, which is the seat of the four-faced Brahmadeva; and from this last after a long time the ordinary creation takes place.</p>
<p>All knowledge springs from Paramātman, whatever the means by which it is produced. It is of two kinds-that which leads to worldly existence, and that which leads to Mokṣa. Viṣṇu bestows knowledge on the ignorant, and Mokṣa on those who have knowledge. The knowledge, or feeling which creates an attachment to the body, child or wife, leads to a worldly life. This is not true. knowledge, but ignorance from which results that worldly life, and that ignornce is dispelled by the knowledge of God.</p>
<p>Mokṣa is attained by the direct knowledge or perception of Hari by means of a method of service possible to oneself and in a body fitted for it. That direct perception is possible to all good individual souls from Brahmadeva to the best of men. This direct perception is to be attained by many means.</p>
<p>What are necessary for direct knowledge, which leads to Mokṣa, are (1) Vairāgya, or the disgust of enjoyments of this world. or the next, generated by seeing the vanity of the world by the company of good persons; (2) equanimity (Śama) and self-control (Dama), etc.; (3) acquaintance with the lore; (4) self-surrender (Śaraṇāgati), in which the mind is devoted to God, as the best of all beings, and is full of the highest love and in which everything is resigned to God and he is worshipped with devotedness in the three ways, and which is accompanied with the faith that He will unfailingly protect and the feeling that the devotee is His: (5) attendance on a Guru, or preceptor, and propitiation of him, which is necessary for Mokṣa or redemption (6) acquisition of knowledge from the Guru and not from books, or, in the absence of a Guru, from a good Vaiṣṇava, and, in rare cases, from books also; (7) reflection over what has been taught; (8) devotion, in the order of their merits, to a preceptor and persons. better than oneself and deserving respect; (9) love of God (Paramātmabhakti) consequent on the knowledge of God&rsquo;s greatness and his being the best of all. This love should be firm and higher</p>
<p>than that for all others, and this leads to Mokṣa or eternal bliss. (10) sympathy for those who are inferior, but good men, love for those who are equal, as if they were the same as themselves, and respectful love or reverence for superiors; (11) performing rites and ceremonies deliberately without any desire, which has the effect of purifying the soul; (12) the avoidance of prohibited deeds, i.e., sins. great and small; (13) resigning every act to Hari as done by him. and not by oneself; (14) the knowledge of the comparative position of beings and of Viṣṇu as the highest of all; (15) knowledge. of the five distinctions already mentioned: (16) distinguishing Prakṛti from Puruṣa, all beings (from Nārāyaṇa down to men, with their consorts) being Puruṣas, and the inanimate world being the Prakṛti (17) reprobation of false doctrines; (18) Upāsanāor worship. This last is of two kinds, viz., (1) the learning of the Śastras, (2) meditation. Meditation (Nididhyāsa) is placing Bhagavat. before the mind&rsquo;s eye to the exclusion of everything else. This meditation is possible for one who has a distinct knowledge of a thing acquired after the removal of ignorance, doubt and delusion. by means of reading or hearing something read and reflection. Some people meditate on Bhagavat as a single spirit and others on him. as having four phases as Sat (existence), Cit (knowledge), ĀnandaJoy) Ātman (spirit). Then are given meditations resorted to by gods and some of those mentioned in the Brahmasūtras.</p>
<p>All these eighteen ways lead to the direct knowledge of God, which is possible for all from Brahmadeva to man. The direct knowledge of God attained by men is comparable with the coruscation of lightning, and that attained by gods to the bright disk of the sun. Garuḍa and Rudra have that knowledge in the shape of a reflection, while Brahmadeva has the knowledge of the whole with all its parts, and some have the knowledge of Him as dwelling in the universe and limited by the universe. The direct knowledge is simply mental.</p>
<p>§ 52. The followers of Madhva wear a mark on the forehead. composed of two white perpendicular lines made with an earth called Gopīcandana above the bridge of the nose, and a dark line. in the middle with a reddish spot in the centrel The two white lines are joined by a cross line on the bridge of the nose. They</p>
<p>wear on the shoulders and on the other parts of their body prints, made with the same white earth, of the conch-shell, the discus, and other weapons of Viṣṇu. These are impressed occasionally with a heated metallic stamp on the skin, so as to leave a permanent scar. Members of this sect exist in pretty large numbers in the Kanarese Districts of the Bombay Presidency, Mysore, and on the Western Coast from Gon to South Kanara, and there are only scattered adherents in Northern India. There are eight establishments, or Maṭhas, for the dissemination and preservation of the creed in South Kanara and three in the inner country. Some of these were founded by Ānandatīrtha himself.</p>
<p>Ānandatīrtha composed thirty-seven¹ different treatises. He includes among the authorities enumerated by him in support of his system the Pāñcarātra-Saṁhitās; but it will be seen from the account given above that in his creed there is no place for the Vyūhas, Vāsudeva and others, and the name by which the Supreme Spirit is spoken of is mostly Viṣṇu. Some of His incarnations, especially Rāmaand Krṣṇa, are also adored But the Gopāla-Krṣṇa element seems to be entirely absent from his system, and Rādhāand the cowherdesses are not mentioned.</p>
<p>It thus appears that the Pāñcarātra or Bhāgavata system hast been set aside by Ānandatīrtha or thrown into the background. The old traditional Vāsudevism of the Bhāgavata school gradually disappeared about his time and made room for general. Vaiṣṇavism.</p>
<p>XVII. Nimbārka.</p>
<p>§ 53. We have thus noticed the form which Vaiṣṇavism assumed in the South from the middle of the eleventh century to the middle of the thirteenth. A strong feeling of Bhakti, or love, and a fear of the dangerous consequences of the doctrine of Māyā, or illusion, were the guiding principles of the new development. The influence of this last extended itself to the North, and we can distinguish between two classes of founders of sects, viz.,</p>
<p>(1) those who wrote in Sanskrit,and (2) those who used the vernacular for the propagation of their creed.</p>

<p>The first of the former class we have to notice is Nimbārka Nimbārka is said to have been a Tailanga Brāhmaṇa by birth and to have lived in a village called Nimbā¹, which perhaps is. the same as Nimbāpura in the Bellary District. He was born. on the 3rd of the bright half of Vaiśākha, and his father&rsquo;s name was Jagannātha, who was a Bhāgavata, and his mother&rsquo;s Sarasvati². He is believed by his followers to be an incarnation of the Sudarśana, or the discus of Viṣṇu. As to when he flourished wel have no definite information, but he appears to have lived some time after Rāmānuja³. Nimbārka composed the Vedāntapārijāta-</p>

<p>2.Introduction to the commentary on Daśaślokīby Harivyāsadeva. It is to be regretted that the commentator does not give the year of Nimbārka&rsquo;s birth.</p>
<p>3.In my Report on the Search for Sanskrit Manuscripts for the year 1882-83, I have given two succession lists of spiritual teachers, one of the sect of Ānandatirtha (p. 203) and another of that founded by Nimbārka (pp. 208- 13). This contains 37 names. There is another list in Manuscript 709 of the Collection of 1884-7, which contains 45 names. The two lists agree to No. 32 Harivyāsadeva. After that, while the first has only five names, the second has thirteen names, and none of these agrees with any of the five, so that after Harivyāsadeva, the lino appears to have divided itself into two branches, No. 709 of the same Collection was written in Saṁvat 1800 corresponding to 1750 A. D., when Gosvāmin Dāmodara was living. He was the thirty-third after Nimbārka in the new branch line. The thirty- third after Ānandatirtha died in 1876 A. D. Ānandatirtha according to our revised date died in 1276 A. D., so that thirty-three successors occupied 603 years. Supposing that the thirty-three successors of Nimbārka occupied about the same period, and allowing about fifteen years of life to Dāmodara Gosvāmin, who was living in 1750 A. D., and subtracting from 1765 A. D. 603 years, we have 1162 which is about the date of Nimbārka&rsquo;s death, so that he lived after Rāmānuja. This calculation of ours is of course very rough, and, besides, the date of the Manuscript No, 706, which is read as 1913 by some, but which looks like 1813, conflicts with this calculation, as nine more Ācāryas flourished after Dāmodara. And, if 1813 is the correct date, seven years cannot suffice for these, though 107 may, if the date is read 1913.</p>
<p>saurabha, which is a short commentary on the Brahmasūtras, and also a small work containing ten stanzas of the name of Siddhāntāratna, usually called Daśaśloki, from the number of stanzas contained in it. Śrīnivāsa, the immediate follower of Nimbārka, wrote a commentary called Bhāṣya on the first, and Harivyāsadeva, the thirty-second in the list of succession, wrote on the second. The thirteenth in the list, Devācārya, wrote the Siddhāntajāhnavī, and his successor, Sundarabhaṭṭa, wrote a commentary on it, called Setu. The thirtieth in the list composed a commentary, or Bhāṣya, on the Brahmasūtras. His name was Kesava Kaśmīrin.</p>
<p>§ 52. Nimbārka&rsquo;s Vedāntic theory is monistic as well as pluralistic. The inanimate world, the individual soul and God are distinct from one another as well as identical. Identical they are in the sense that the first two have no independent existence, but are dependent on God for their existence and action. The theory of the Brahmasūtras that Brahman is the material cause of the universe, is thus understood: To be the material cause of an effect is (1) to possess the capacity of assuming the form of that effect, and (2) to be fitted to do so. Brahman possesses various capacities which are of the nature of the animate and inanimate worlds. These in a subtle form constitute its natural condition. This satisfies the first of the two requirements. The capacities again contain in them the rudiment of the effect, i. e., the world, in a subtle form. This meets the second requirement. By realising these capacities. and bringing the subtle rudiment into a gross form, Brahman becomes the material cause of the world. Rāmānuja&rsquo;s theory of Brahman forming with the animate and inanimate world a composite personality and of its being the material cause in so far as the bodily portion of the composite personality becomes developed, is rejected by the school<sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup>. For a further knowledge of the system, I will here give a translation of the Daśaśloki.</p>
<p>I. Jīva, or the individual soul, is knowledge, dependent on Hari, and is in a condition to be associated with, or dissociated from, a body; is an atom, different in different bodies, and is a knower and numberless.</p>
<p>It is called knowledge here to show that it is able to know</p>
<p>without the organs of sense, and it is not to be understood hero that the soul is the mere phenomenon of knowledge, and not a substance, which is the doctrine of Śamkarācārya.</p>
<p>II. The individual soul has his form distorted by its contact with Māyā, or the constituent principle with the three qualities which has no beginning. Its true nature becomes known by the grace of God.</p>
<p>Individual souls are of two sorts: (1) those delivered or in a supremely blissful condition; (2) those tied down to the circle of existences. The first are of two kinds: (I) those who are eternally in a supremely blissful condition, such as (a) Garuḍa, Viṣvaksena, and (b) the crown, ear-ornaments and the flute considered as living beings; and (II) those who are freed from the trammels of life. Of these last some attain to the likeness of God and others are content with the perception of the nature of their own soul. Corresponding to these two last are two kinds of Mumukṣu, those who seek deliverance of either kind.</p>
<p>III. The inanimate objects are of three kinds: (1) not derived from Prakṛti; (2) derived from Prakṛti, and (3) time. In the things derived from Prakṛti we have the ordinary material objects having the three colours, viz., red, white, and dark.</p>
<p>The first class consists of those which are spoken of figuratively. by the use of the names of objects belonging to the second class, such as the sunlike refulgence of the Supreme Soul. It is a rofulgence not arising from the Prakṛti. Similarly the body, hands, feet, and ornaments of God, as well as all the surroundings, such as garden, palace, etc., belong to the first class and are of an inanimate nature, though they are not made of matter, i. e., not derived from Prakṛti¹.</p>
<p>IV. I meditate on the highest Brahman, viz., Krṣṇa, who has eyes like the lotus, who naturally is free from all faults, is the store of all beneficent attributes, who has Vyuhas for his parts, and who is adored by all.</p>
<p>____________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.The physical attributes, given to God by Rāmānuja and the rest and to which the word &lsquo;celestial&rsquo; is sometimes prefixed,are to be understood in this sense.</p>
<p>The Vyūhas here mentioned are those usually referred to in the Pāñcarātra and Rāmānuja systems. The commentators understand. the incarnations also by this expression. One gives a large number of these, divided into classes on certain principles. Krṣṇa is called Vareṇya or adored by all, because he has a holy celestial body and bodily qualities, such as beauty, tenderness, sweetness and charm. All these are of course non-material (Aprākṛta), though inanimate according to Stanza III.</p>
<p>V. I reflect on the daughter of Vṛṣabhānu (Rādhikā), who shines with a corresponding beauty on the left side (of Krṣṇa), ist attended on by thousands of female friends, and who always confers all desired objects.</p>
<p>VI. This Parabrahman should be always worshipped uninterruptedly by men in order to be free from the darkness in the shape of ignorance, in which they are enveloped. So was Nārada, who directly perceived the whole truth, taught by Sanandana and others.</p>
<p>VII. All things having Brahman for their souls in accordance with the Śrutis and Smṛtis, the knowledge that [ Brahman ] is all is true. This is the doctrine of those who know the Vedas, and at the same time the three forms are true as determined from the sacred precepts (Smṛtis) and the Sūtras.</p>
<p>Here is laid down the unity of all things in so far as Brahman. is the inner controlling soul of all and is concomitant with them, and their existence and actions are dependent on it, and also pluralism, since there are three distinct substances, which are called forms of Brahman in the Stanza, vix, the inanimate world, the individual soul and the Supreme Soul.</p>
<p>VIII. There appears no way to salvation except the lotus-like feet of Kṛṣṇa, which are adored by Brahmadeva, Śiva and others Krṣṇa, who, at the desire of a devotee, assumes a form easy of meditation and whose power is unthinkable and whose essence cannot be comprehended.</p>
<p>IX. His grace extends itself to those who have a feeling of helplesṣṇess and other qualifications, and by that grace is generated. Bhakti, or devotion, consisting of special love for Him, Who has</p>
<p>no superior lord. This Bhakti is of two kinds: the highest is one, and the other is that which leads to or is instrumental to it.</p>
<p>By the feeling of helplesṣṇess and other qualifications are meant the six modes of Prapatti given in connection with Rāmānuja&rsquo;s system. The Bhakti which is instrumental to that which is the highest, is of the nature of the six or nine modes mentioned in previous Sections.</p>
<p>X. These five things should be known by the devotees: (1) the nature of the being to be worshipped; (2) the nature of the worshipper: (3) the fruit of Gods&rsquo;s grace; (4) the feeling of enjoyment consequent on Bhakti, or love; (5) obstructions to the attainment of God.</p>
<p>The first is the knowing of the nature of the Supreme Being as existence, intelligence and joy (Saccidānanda ), of his possessing a colestial body (non-material), of his dwelling in such places as the cow-settlement (Vraja), which is called the celestial city (Vyomapura), of his being the cause of all, omnipotent, tender, merciful, gracious towards his devotees, and so forth. The second consists in knowing the worshipper as an atom, possessing knowledge aud joy, and as the servant of Krṣṇa, etc. The third is the self-surrender and the giving up of all actions except the service of God, which results in self-surrender. The fourth arises from serenity, servitude, friendliness, affection, and enthusiasm. These states of mind are consequent upon the peculiar relation to God of each individual, as affection was the feeling of Nanda, Vāsudeva and Devakī, and enthusiasm, of Rādhāand Rukmiṇī. The fifth are such as regarding the body as the soul, dependence. on others than God and one&rsquo;s preceptor, indifference to the com- mands of God contained in the sacred books, worshipping other gods, giving up one&rsquo;s own peculiar duties, ingratitude, spending one&rsquo;s life in a worthless manner, vilification of good men, and many others.</p>
<p>§ 55. These ten Stanzas contain the quintessence of Nimbārka&rsquo;s system. This appears to have Rāmānuja&rsquo;s doctrines for its basis and is a sidewise development of it. It gives predominance to Prapatti or self-surrender of the six kinds, alluded to above, and then, by the grace of God, love for Him is generated. His Sādhana</p>
<p>Bhakti comprehends all the Yogas of Rāmānuja&rsquo;s system. Rāmānuja, as we have already remarked<sup id="fnref:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup>, changes the original sense of Bhakti and renders it equivalent to the Upāsanā, or the meditation prescribed in the Upanṣiads. But Nimbārka keeps to the original sense. His doctrines make a nearor approach to the Tenkalai, or Southern Learning, of the Rāmānujiyas. But the great difference between the two teachers is, that, while Rāmānuja confines himself to Nārāyaṇa and his consorts Lakṣmi, Bhū and Līlā, Nimbārka gives almost an exclusive prominence to Krṣṇa and his mistress, Rādhā, attended on by thousands of her female companions. Thus the fourth element of Vaiṣṇavism which we have mentioned<sup id="fnref:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup> rises to the surface in Vaiṣṇavism about this. time, and retains its place in Northern India, including Bengal, except in the case of those sects whose favourite deity is Rāmaand not Krṣṇa; and to these for the present we will now turn our attention, coming back again to Krṣṇaism later on.</p>
<p>Nimbārka&rsquo;s system is known by the name of Sanakasaṁpradāya, or the tradition originating with Sanaka. Though Nimbārka was a Southerner, he lived at Vṛndāvana near Mathurā, which accounts for the preference given by him to the RadhaKrṣṇaform of Vaiṣṇavism. His followers are scattered over the whole of Northern India, and exist in large numbers near Mathurāand in Bengal. They wear two perpendicular lines of Gopīcandana with a black spot in the middle on the forehead, and use a necklace and rosary of the wood of the Tulasīplant. They are divided into two classes, the ascetics and householders. This distinction appears to have originated at the time of Harivyāsadeva, after whom, as I have observed in a note, the successors of Nimbārka were divided into two branches. The reason for the division was probably this new distinction.</p>
<p>XVIII. Rāmānanda.</p>
<p>§ 56. A spirit of sympathy for the lower castes and classes of Hindu society has from the beginning been a distinguishing feature of Vaiṣṇavism. Still, so far as we have advanced, the great teachers kept these castes and classes into, what might be</p>
<p>called, an outer court, though they were admitted to the benefits of the new dispensation. They had not, as the pure Vedāntinsassert, to do the duties prescribed for their mean position, and rise in succeeding lives until they were finally born as Brāhmaṇas, when alone they could avail themselves of the methods laid down for the attainment of Mokṣa, or deliverance. They could attain this even as members of the lowest caste by resorting to devotion, but the Brahmanic teachers, Rāmānuja and others, made the methods based on the study of the Vedic literature accessible. only to the higher castes, leaving other methods to the rest.</p>
<p>But Rāmānanda now began a radical reform and made no distinction between Brāhmaṇas and members of the degraded. castes, and all could even dine together, provided they were the devotees of Viṣṇu and had been admitted into the fold. Another reform, which must be traced to Rāmānanda, was the use of the Vernaculars for the propagation of the new creed. And a third very important reform made by him was the introduction of the purer and more chaste worship of Rāmā and Sītāinstead of that of Krṣṇa and Rādhā.</p>
<p>Mr. Macauliffe mentions Mailkot as the place of his birth and says that he must have flourished in the end of the fourteenth and the first half of the fifteenth century, which, he states, corresponds with a reckoning which gives 1398 A D., as the date of the birth of Kabīr. This would rather make Rāmānanda live long before. the end of the fourteenth century, as Kabir was his successor, and ordinarily believed to be his pupil¹. The authority² I have. consulted states that he was born at Prayāga as the son of a Kānyakubja Brāhmaṇa, named Punyasadans, and his wife Suśīlā. The date of his birth is given as 4400 of the Kali age, equivalent to 1356 of Vikkrama-Saṁvat. This corresponds to 1299 or 1300 A. D., and is more consistent with the traditional statement that there were three generations between him and Rāmānuja. Thedate of Rāmānuja&rsquo;s death is usually given as 1137 A. D., though. it makes him out as having lived for 120 years. The lapse of three. generations between 1137 and 1300 A. D., is a more reasonable. supposition than between 1137 and the end of the fourteenth century. This last date, therefore, given for Rāmānanda is manifestly wrong, and that occurring in the book I have consulted appears to be correct in all probability.</p>

<p>1.The Sikh Religion, ate., by M. A. Macauliffe, Vol. VI, pp. 100-1. 1908 A. D. is said by Macauliffe to correspond to the 510th year of his ara. By his he must mean Kabīr&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>2.Chapters from the Agastya-Saṁhitāwith a Hindi translation by Rāmā Nārāyaṇa Dāsa, completed in Saṁvat 1960, corresponding to 1904 A. D.</p>
<p>From Prayāga Rāmānanda was sent to Benares for the usual education of a Brāhmaṇa. After he finished this, he became a disciple of Rāghavānanda, a teachar of the Viśiṣṭādvaita school of Rāmānuja After some time he gave up some of the restrictive practices of the sect, such as that of taking food without being seen by anybody, and separated himself from his preceptor, and himself became the founder of a school. As indicated above, he took pupils from the degraded castes also. Thirteen of them became noted and their names are: 1. Anantānanda, 2. Surasarānanda, 3. Sukhānanda, 4. Naraharīyānanda, 5. Yogānanda, 6. Pīpā, 7. Kabīr, 8. Bhāvanānda, 9. Senā, 10. Dhannā, 11. Gālavānanda, 12. Rāidās, and 13. Padmāvatī.</p>
<p>Of these Pīpāwas a Rajput, Kabīr was a Śūdra and spoken of also as a Mahomedan following the profession of a weaver, Senā was a barber, Dhannāa Jāt, Rāidās belonged to the degraded caste of curriers or workers in leather, and Padmāvatīwas a woman. With the first twelve he went about the country visiting holy places, conducting disputations with the advocates of the Māyā doctrine, Jaius, Buddhists, etc., establishing his own Viśiṣṭādvaita theory, and converting men to his views and admitting them as his disciples. Rāmānanda is stated to have died in 1467 of Vikrama-Saṁvat, corresponding to 1411 A. D. This gives him a life of 111 years, which is rather improbable. Some of his pupils became the founders of different schools, and through them the worship of Rāmā spread over an extensive portion of Northern and Central India, successfully competing with that of Gopāla-Krṣṇa.</p>
<p>XIX. Kabīr.</p>
<p>§ 57. The few particulars that have come down to us about the birth and life of Kabīr are these. He was the son of a</p>
<p>Brāhmaṇa widow who cast him away as soon as he was born, to hide her shame, near the Lahar Tank in Benares. A Mahomedan weaver of the name of Nirūwas passing by the way with his wife Nīmā, when the latter saw the child and carried it home. He was nurtured and brought up by her and her husband Nirū, and Kabīr when he had grown up, followed the occupation of a weaver. He showed leanings towards the Hindu faith, and the idea of making Rāmānanda his Guru, or preceptor, arose in his mind. But he conceived it not possible that that sage should receive a Mahomedan as his disciple and therefore had recourse to a contrivance. He laid himself down on the Ghāṭa, or pavement on the Ganges, at which Rāmānanda bathed very early in the morning. On the way Rāmānanda trampled on the boy and exclaimed &ldquo;Rāma, Rāma! What poor creature is it that I have trampled upon ?&rdquo;. Kabīr rose up and received the exclamation &ldquo;Rāma, Rāma&rdquo; as a Mantra communicated to him by Rāmānanda, and he understood that he had thus been made a disciple.</p>
<p>Another account is that, being trampled on, Kabīr rose up and cried aloud, when Rāmānanda told him to be quiet and go on uttering the name of &ldquo;Rāmā&rdquo;. Considering that he had thus been accepted as a pupil, Kabīr went on with his adorations of God, proclaiming that he was the disciple of Rāmānanda. Some Hindus went to the latter and asked him whether he had initiated Kabīr.Thereupon Kabīr was sent for and asked by Rāmānanda, when it was that he had been initiated. Kabīr mentioned to him. the incident of his having been trampled upon the Ghāṭa, Then Rāmānanda remembered the matter and clasped Kabīr to his breast. Since that time Kabīr regularly attended at his master&rsquo;s Maṭha and joined him in his disputations with the Pandits.</p>
<p>For some time Kabīr lived at Manikapur, as is mentioned in one of his Ramainīs. There he heard of the fame of Shaikh Taqqi and of twenty-one Pīrs. He heard their discourses, condemned. their teachings and said: &ldquo;O Shaikhs, of whatever name! listen to me, Open your eyes and see the origin and the end of all things and their creation and dissolution&rdquo;. In one of the books of this sect, Shaikh Taqqi is represented as an enemy of Kabīr, and a Pīr, or the religious guide, of Sikandar Lodi. At his advice the emperor persecuted Kabīr and used various methods to destroy</p>
<p>him. But Kabīr miraculously escaped death and was eventually reconciled to Sikandar Lodi, who received him into his favour.</p>
<p>Kabīr died at Maghar, and there was a dispute between the Hindus and the Mahomedans as to the disposal of his dead body, which was covered by a sheet of cloth. When the sheet was removed, the body had disappeared, and in its stead there was a heap of flowers. The Mahomedans took one-half of the quantity and buried it at Maghar and erected a tomb over it, and the Hindus took their share to Benares, where it was burnt. Kabīr had a wife of the name of Loi, a son of the name Kamāl, and a daughter of the name of Kamālī. But there are miraculous stories. as to how Kabīr came by them.</p>
<p>As to how much of this account is historical and how much legendary, it is difficult to say. But that he was a Mahomedan weaver at the beginning may be accepted as a fact. And that Shaikh Taqqi, a Mahomedan Pīr, who is mentioned in one of the Ramainīs, as stated above, was his rival and that Kabīr lived about the time of Sikandar Lodi may also be regarded as historical. As to whether Kabīr was a disciple of Rāmānanda, there is some question, as will be presently mentioned. Mr. Westcott considers it not impossible that he should have been both a Mahomedan and a Sūfi¹, but all his writings show a complete familiarity with the names occurring in Hindu religious. literature and Hindu manners and customs, so that it appears to me that there is little or nothing in Kabīr&rsquo;s writings calculated to show that his teachings had a Mahomedan basis. The basis appears to be purely Hindu, though Kabīr was a bold and uncompromising reformer and hurled anathemas at the Pandits, the Brāhmaṇas proud of their caste, and the teachers of the existing sects of the Hindus, and thus appears to have come under the influence of Mahomedanism.</p>
<p>The dates given by various writers for the birth and death of Kabīr are conflicting. Mr. Westcott makes him live for 78 years, from 1440 to 1518 A. D.<sup id="fnref:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup>, and according to Mr. Macauliffe he</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.Kabīr and the Kabir Panth by Rev. G. H. Westcott. Cawnpore, 1907, p. 44.</p>
<p>13 [ R. G. Bhandarkar&rsquo;s Works, Vol. IV. ]</p>
<p>was born in Saṁvat 1455, corresponding to A. D. 1398<sup id="fnref:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup>, and ha died in A. D. 1518<sup id="fnref:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup>, having lived for 119 years, five months and twenty-seven days. In a footnote he quotes from an original work the date Śaka 1370, corresponding to 1448 A. D., as the date of his death. Sikandar Lodi was on the throne of Delhi from 1488 to 1517 A. D. The last of the three dates does not harmonise with this, and so it must be given up. Rāmānanda, we have seen, is spoken of as having been born in 1298 A. D. and died in 1411 A. D. If Mr. Westcott&rsquo;s date for Kabīr&rsquo;s birth is true, Kabīr cannot have been a disciple of Rāmānanda. If that of Mr. Macauliffe is accepted, it is just possible that he should have so become, for at the time of Rāmānanda&rsquo;s death, Kabīr must have been thirteen years of age, and he is represented in one of the legends to have been but a boy when he was accepted as a disciple by the old sage. The date 1518 A. D. given by both the writers for his death may be accepted as correct. But if that of his birth given by Mr. Macauliffe is also accepted, we shall have to suppose that Kabīr lived for 119 years; Rāmānanda also according to the dates given in the last section lived for 113 years. Whether both of them lived. such long lives might well be questioned. But, until we have more evidence, the dates for Rāmānanda already noticed, and for Kabīr as given by Mr. Macauliffe may be provisionally accepted, and thus Kabīr might be considered to have really been a disciple of Rāmānanda, though of course, being a boy of thirteen, he could not have taken part in his master&rsquo;s disputations with Pandits. In Kabīr&rsquo;s works, however, so far as I have seen them, Rāmānanda&rsquo;s namedoes not occur, though the name Rāmaas that of the Supreme Being and also the relation of the individual soul with Rāma, as well as his refutation of the doctrine of God&rsquo;s being Videha or Nirguṇa, i. e., without attributes, must have been borrowed from Rāmānanda&rsquo;s doctrines, which again are based on Rāmānuja&rsquo;s system.</p>
<p>§ 58. We now give a translation of a few passages illustra tive of the teachings of Kabīr³.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>3.The edition consulted is that published with a commentary under the ordeft of Raghurajasimha, Maharaja of Rewab, in Saṁvat 1924.</p>
<p>First RamainĪ.¹</p>
<p>1.There was in the inside a substance called Jīva or individual soul; the Internal Light illuminated [it]. 2. And then followed. a woman of the name of &lsquo;desire&rsquo;; and she was called Gāyatrī. 3.That woman gave birth to three sons; Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Maheśa, 4. Then Brahmāasked the woman who was her husband and whose wife she was. 5. (She replied:) &ldquo;Thou and I, I and thou, and there is no third, Thou art my husband and I am thy wife.&rdquo; 6. The father and son had a common wife; and one mother has a two-fold character; there is no son who is good son and who will endeavour to recognise his father.</p>
<p><strong>Second Ramainī.</strong></p>
<p>1.In the light there was sound, which was a woman. 2. And of the woman were Hari, Brahmā and the enemy of the three cities (Śiva). 3.Then Brahmācreated an egg and divided it into fourteen regions. 4-6. Then Hari, Hara and Brahmā settled in three regions, and thus they arranged the whole Brāhmaṇḍa and the six philosophies and ninety-six heresies. Nobody then taught the Veda for his sustenance; and Turuk did not come for making circumcision. 7.The woman brought forth from her womb. children. They became distinct individuals and followed different courses of action. 8.Therefore I and thou are of one blood and. are one life. Distinctness arises from ignorance. 9. From one woman all sprang, and what knowledge is it that brought about distinctness between them? 13 (Sākhī). Kabīr proclaims: All this ordinary world is destructible; without knowing the name of Rāma all individuals are drowned in the ocean of existence.</p>
<p>Kabīr&rsquo;s account of creation seems to be this. In the light of Rāma there existed a substance which was the subtle element, the sum total of all individual souls. And then that substance was illuminated by that light. Then followed a desire in the shape of a woman, which was at the same time called Gāyatrīand sound. (Śabda), and from her the creation took its rise. His idea thus</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.Ramainī is a piece of composition consisting of several Caupāīs (Sk. Catuṣpadī), which are stanzas consisting of four lines with the ends of the first two and of the last two rhyming with each other, and a Sākhī(which is another species of metre) at the end.</p>
<p>seems to be that individual souls came into being, or were developed out of a substance which was their subtle form, at the will of the Supreme Soul, which (will) was uttered in the form of a sound. That is to say, the Supreme Soul was not the material cause of the world, but a distinct subtle entity. What, in the language of the Upanṣiads, became many was this entity and not the Supreme Soul himself. Kabīr&rsquo;s philosophy is thus not a monism, but. dualism. All individuals sprang into existence from the same cause, there was one blood and one life, and consequently the distinction of castes and races was a later fiction. Kabīr thus appears to be an opponent of this distinction.</p>
<p><strong>Fifth Rāmainī.</strong></p>
<p>The substance of the first five Caupāīs seems to be that Hari, Hara and Brahmā, taking the two letters (Rāma), laid the foundation of all learning, and gradually the Vedas and Kitābs (books) came to be composed. 6-8. In all the four ages the devotees devised systems, but were not aware that the bundle they had tied up was torn. Men ran in all directions for salvation, being afraid. Abandoning their lord they ran towards hell.</p>
<p>Eighth Ramainī.</p>
<p>1.The precept &ldquo;Tat tvam asi &quot; ( that thou art) is the message of the Upaniṣads. 2.They lay great stress upon it, and those who are qualified explain it (at great length). 3. Sanaka and Nārada became happy by regarding the highest principle to be distinct. from themselves, 4. The colloquy between Janaka and Yājn̄avalkya comes to the same effect, and that same sweet sentiment was tested by Dattātreya. 5.Vāsiṣṭha and Rāma sang together the same thing, and that same thing was explained to Uddhava. 6.That same thing was substantiated by Janaka, and though her had a body, he was called bodiless (Videha ). 7 (Sakhī). No mortal becomes immortal without abandoning the pride of birth. That which one cannot see by experience is to be considered as &ldquo;unseen&rdquo; or &ldquo;unperceived&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In this Ramainī Kabīr shows acquaintance with the Upanṣiads and other branches of Hiudu sacred literature, so that he cannot have been a mere &ldquo;Sūfi and Mahomedan&rdquo;. He rejects the theory of the identity between the Supreme and the individual souls,</p>
<p>which is regarded as being laid down in the expression &ldquo;That thou art of the Chāndogya Upanṣiad. The commentator says. that by &ldquo;that&rdquo; is to be understood the subtle body of sixteen parts and the expression means &ldquo;Thou art that subtle body&rdquo;. Kabīrtakes all the individuals he has named in this Ramainī to have preached duality.</p>
<p>In the fourteenth Ramainīthere is a condemnation of the several systems of religion-that contained in the Purāṇas, that of Brahmā, Haṁsa, Gopāla, Śaṁbhu, ghosts and goblins and various forms of worship upto the Nevaja of the Mahomedan.</p>
<p>Thirty-fourth Ramainī.</p>
<p>1.The Pandits were misled by the study of the Vedas which are based on the Guṇas, or qualities, and did not know their own nature and their true friend (God). 2.They practise Saṁdhyā, Tarpaṇa, the six rites and various other such ceremonies. 3. In all the four Yugas Gāyatrīhas been taught; ask who obtained salvation (Mukti) by its means. 4. When you are touched by other people, you bathe; tell me who is more degraded than yourselves. 5. You are very proud of your virtues. Too much pride is not good. 6.How can he whose name destroys all pride. bear this proud behaviour? 7.(Sākhī). Giving up the traditional mode of worship of the family, they seek the place of Nirvāṇa; having destroyed the seed and sprout, they became an entity without attributes (Videha or Nirguṇa).</p>
<p>Kabīr here condemns the rites, ceremonies and other practices of the Brāhmaṇas, the pride that is generated in them by these, the contempt in which they hold people of other castes, and also their search of Nirvāṇa, or a condition without any attributes, i. e., the Advaita, or adualistic, system which they follow.</p>
<p><strong>Fortieth Ramainī.</strong></p>
<p>1.The sea, which is a collection of waters, is a ditch, and in it are the sun, the moon, and the thirty-three crores of brothers. 2.In the whirlpools (of such a universe) they (men and gods) have seated themselves and desire happiness, but have not shunned the touch of misery. 3.Nobody knows the secret of misery, and the world has become mad in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>4.Everybody is a fool or a sage in himself and nobody knows Rāma who dwells in the heart. 5. (Sākhī). They themselves are Hari (God), they themselves are lords, they themselves are the slaves of Hari. When there is no guarantee, the lady (Mukti or salvation) goes away disappointed.</p>
<p>Here again there is a condemnation of various systems and of the self-confidence which has given rise to them and the neglect of God dwelling in the heart.</p>
<p>Sākhīs.</p>

<ol start="31">
<li>The crowds went by the path traversed by the Pandits. Lofty is the ascent to Rāma. Kabīr has climbed it. 135. The whole world has gone astray by partiality for one&rsquo;s own system. He who, becoming free from partiality, adores Hari, is a wise sage. 138. The great ones are lost in their own greatness; pridel peers out through every pore; when they are not familiar with a wise preceptor, all the orders of men are of the Camãr caste, i. e., the degraded caste of curriers. 182. The Kali is a wicked age; the world is blind and nobody believes in the true word. He to whom a salutary advice is given, becomes an enemy. 211. Three things went to a holy place (the body, the fickle heart, and the mind which is a thief). They did not destroy a single sin, but on the contrary the mind contracted ten others. 260, The Kabīrs (men in general) polluted the path of Bhakti, or faith, by washing pebbles and stones. Keeping poison within, they have thrown out the nectar. 358. &ldquo;I am the author of the whole creation, there is no other who is superior to me.&rdquo; (This is what some people think). Kabīr says that, when one does not know what one is oneself, one thinks everything to be contained in oneself. 365. In this world all have passed away considering themselves to bei Rāma, but no one actually became Rāma. Kabīr says that those who know Rāma as he truly is, attain all their objects. 366. This world has become mad and has conceived a love for something which can be no matter of experience; and denying all authoritativeness to actual experience, they attach themselves to a soul without attributes (Videha). 372. Seeing a void, men were misled</li>

<li>The bee loiters in the garden, being enticed by the innumerable flowers in it. In the same manner the individual soul loiters among the objects of sense and at the end goes away disappointed. 95. The soul is to the mind as a monkey is to a showman. Making it dance in a variety of ways, it (mind) finally retains it in its own hands. 96. The mind is fickle, a thief and perfect swindler. The gods and the sages fell off in consequence of the mind and mind finds a hundred thousand openings. 136. If a man gives up his belongings, it does not mean much. Egotism, or self-pride, cannot be given up. Self-pride, which led astray the great Munis, devours all. Running after gold and women, men are burnt by the passion generated by an illusion. Kabīr says, how can they be saved, being like cotton which has come in contact with fire? 147. All became subject to the power of illusion: Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Maheśa, and the four, Nārada, Śārada, Sanaks, and Gaṇeśa, the son of Gaurī. 209. Do not kill a poor living creature; the life of all is the same. You will not be free from (the sin of) killing, even if you hear crores of Purāṇas.</li>

<p>Here the first group contains a condemnation of the current religious doctrines; the second gives a specimen of Kabīr&rsquo;s moral teachings, and the third explains the way in which God&rsquo;s graca operates towards the deliverance of man. Kabīr, therefore, was as much a constructive reformer as destructive. In Sākhī260 of the first group, Kabīr, it will be seen, condemns the worship of idols. The religion which he promulgated, therefore, was a pure spiritual theism. The mode of worship used by his followers up to the present day consists of prayers and praises only.</p>
<p>Kabīr founded a Pantha, or a sect, and the Maṭhas, or establishments of that sect exist in several parts of India. The principal one is at Benares, with a branch at Maghar in the Gorakhpur District, where he died. This last is said to be in the charge of a Mahomedan Mahant, or superior. The second was established by Dharmadās, his chief disciple, in the Chattisgarh District of the Central Provinces¹. The followers of Kabīr&rsquo;s sect are to be found principally among the lower castes, but the sage is highly venerated by all Vaiṣṇavas of whatever caste or class.</p>
<p><strong>XX. Other Rāmānandins.</strong></p>
<p>§ 59. Malukdās, who lived about the end of Akbar&rsquo;s reign, i. e, about the end of the sixteenth century, was a worshipper of Rāma. The tradition that he belonged to the school of Rāmānanda appears to be correct. Like Kabīr, he seems to have been a non-idolater, since in a hymn which I have seen, he ridicules men and women who hammer valuable metals into gods, worship them, and, whenever there is a necessity, sell them for the price of the metal, and says that the true way was shown to him by his wise. preceptor. The sect founded by him has seven Maṭhas, or establishments, and its adherents follow the occupation of householders.</p>
<p>Dādu was a cotton cleaner at Ahmedabad. At twelve he removed to Sambhar and finally settled at Naraina, about twenty Kośas from Jaipur. He flourished about 1600 A. D., at the end of Akbar&rsquo;s reign. His doctrines appear to be similar to those of Kabīr. The only mode of worship was Japa, or the repetition ofthe name of Rāma. The sect does not worship Images of Rāma and it erects no temples. Dādu inculcates faith in, and love of, Rāma and meditation on him. His followers His followers are divided into threa classes: (1) Viraktas, (2) Nāgas, and (3) Vistaradhārins. The firstlive the life of ascetics, the second are bearers of arms and enter into the service of princes as soldiers, and the third lead an ordinary life.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.For details, see Rev. G. H. Westcott&rsquo;s Volume on Kabīr referred to above.</p>
<p>Rāidās, a pupil of Rāmānanda, was a founder of a sect the followers of which are to be found in the caste of Camārs. or leather-workers. Nābhājīin his Bhaktamālātolls many legends. about him. Under the name of Rohidās he is known and revered even in the Maratha country, and Mahīpati, the Maratha writer on saints, devotes a chapter to him.</p>
<p>Senāthe barber, a follower of Rāmānanda, is also reported to have founded a sect. He too is known in the Maratha country<sup id="fnref:60"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">60</a></sup>.</p>
<p>XXI. Tulasīdās.</p>
<p>§ 60. Another person who contributed to the propagation of the cult of Rāmaover Northern Indis, was the famous Tulasīdās, whom we will now briefly notice. Tulasīdās belonged to the Saravaryāor Sarayūparīṇa caste of Brāhmaṇas and was born in Saṁvat 1589, corresponding to 1532 A. D., under an inauspicious constellation. He was abandoned by his parents and was picked. up by a Sādhu, or a pious man, in whose company he visited many places in India. His father&rsquo;s name was Ātmārāma Śukla Dūbe, his mother&rsquo;s Hulasī, and his own Rāma Bōta. His father-in-law was a man of the name of Dīnabandhu Pāṭhaka, and hist wife was called RatnāvalīHis son&rsquo;s name was Tāraka.</p>
<p>Tulasīdās commenced the composition of his great work, Rāmacaritamānasa, usually known as Rāmāyaṇa, at Ayodhyāin 1574 A. D., and finished it at Benares. He wrote eleven other works, six of which were smaller. Tulasīdās was not a sturdy reformer like Kabīr and does not seem to have founded a sect or even to have promulgated a definite Vedāntic theory. In this respect he appears to have been, like a host of other persons who flourished in the country, a teacher of the Bhaktimārga, or the path of devotion, which is based upon a dualistic philosophy with a leaning towards spiritual monism of the Advaita system. Tulasīdās died in 1623 A. D.¹</p>
<p>§ 61. I will now give a short specimen of Tulasīdās&rsquo; teachings. from his Rāma-Satasaī, the composition of which, as stated in Dohā 21 of the first chapter, was commenced on Thursday, the ninth of the bright half of Vaiśākha, Saṁvat 1642 = 1585 A. D.</p>
<p>Chapter I.</p>
<p>(Dohā 3) The highest soul, the highest excellent place, than whom or which there is no other, Tulasī understands and hears to be Rāma, the blessed. (Dohā4) &ldquo;Rāma whose attributes confer blessings upon all is himself free from all desires. He fulfils all desires, is the benefactor of all. The sages assert this.&quot;—So says! Tulasī. (Dohā 15) Tulasī sees plainly that in every pore of Rāma there is an endless universe. He is pure, is unchangeable and is irresistible. (Dohā 6) The blessed Jānakīis the mother of the world, and Rāma the father. Both are beneficent. Their grace destroys sin, and creates conscience (confers the knowledge of distinguishing good from evil). (Dohā 44) Where there is Rāma, there is no [evil] desire; where there is [evil] desire, there is no Rāma. Oh Tulasī !the sun and the night do not exist in one place. (Dohā 45) When Rāma is afar, Māyā(illusion or temptation) is strong. When he is known, it becomes tiny or thin. When the sun is at a distance, the shadow is long; when ho is on the head, it is below the feet. (Dohā 48) Says Tulasī : &ldquo;If there is no love for Rāma, all learning is thrown into an oven and Yama takes away knowledge and devours it; everything burns away and the very root is destroyed&rdquo;. (Dohā 57) All things by which a man is surrounded, serve as hindrances, and none proves a help (towards the way of bliss); and, in such circumstances, if the end is good, it can become so only through Rāma&rsquo;s grace.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter II</strong></p>
<p>(Dohā 17) Says Tulsī : &ldquo;Through the disobedience of God, man brings evil on himself and all his associates. The king ofthe Kurus, while governing his kingdom, was reduced to dust along with his army and family&rdquo;. (Doha 18) Says Tulasī: &ldquo;From sweet words results good on all sides. This is a spell that. overcomes everything; avoid all harsh words&rdquo;. (Doha 19) &ldquo;A man attains happiness by the grace of Rāma, and it escapes ono without it&rdquo;, says Tulasì, &ldquo;though they know this, bad men neglect to adore Rāma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.For details, see Dr. Grierson&rsquo;s articles in the Indian Antiquary, Vol. XXII.</p>
<p>Chapter IV.<sup id="fnref:61"><a href="#fn:61" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">61</a></sup></p>
<p>82 (89 B. I). The excellent retentive faculty is called Girāor Sarasvatī, and the immutable Dharma is a Vaṭa tree. Dharma consists of a triad of confluent rivers destroying sin. Oh Tulasī, conceive no dislike for these and accept these.</p>
<p>The triad is given by the commentator as action, knowledge, and Bhakti, or devotion.</p>
<p>83 (90 B. I.). One becomes clean by bathing (in these three. confluent rivers), i. e., grasping the trind by the understanding. The dirt in the shape of immortality is washed off, and then there is no doubt as to the easy attainment of the place of Rama. 84 (91 B. I. ). Forgiveness is holy Vārānasī. Bhakti, or devotion, is like the river of gods (Gaṅgā) and clear knowledge is like Višvešvara. These together with compassion, which is power Pārvatī), shine.</p>
<p>The commentator remarks that just as Benares with the other. three brings about deliverance, so do forgiveness, devotion, knowledge, and compassion.</p>
<p>85 (92 B. I.). Vārānasīis not far from him whose heart dwells in the house which is Kṣamā(forgiveness)—Vārānasī, in which shines, oh Tulasīthe celestial river in the shape of Bhakti, which results in numerous virtuous deeds. 86 (93 B. L.). Kāsīis the bright half of a month and Magaha, or Magadha, is the dark half in which dwell covetousness, infatuation, intoxication, and lust. Oh Tulasīconsidering which is beneficial and which is injurious, do [choose where to] reside during all the watches of the day.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>The editions consulted are those published by Navalkisora at Lakhnau in 1886 and in the Bibliotheco Indica in 1897.</p>
<p>Kāśīis associated with the four virtues mentioned above, and Magadha with the vices noticed here. So one is told to practise what is beneficial and to avoid what is injurious.</p>
<p>87 (94 B. I.). What has gone away will not come again. Therefore do acquire knowledge. The same thing that you have today you will have tomorrow; therefore, oh Tulasī ! give up all infatuation.</p>
<p>The idea seems to be : Do not waste time by procrastination; begin your devotions at once.</p>
<p>88 (95 B. I.). The past and the future hang together on the present. Oh Tulasīdo not entertain any doubt, get through that which is before you at present.</p>
<p>89 (96 B. I.). A good soul is like the Mānasa (lake), and in it is the pure water of the sweet glory of Rāma. Sin is washed off and the heart becomes pure (by bathing in that water); and this calm water is not inaccesible to the wise.</p>
<p>The idea seems to be that in a good soul a taste for devotion to Rāma springs up, and when it is cultivated, the soul become pure.</p>
<p>From these extracts it will be seen that according to Tulasīdās Rāma is the supreme God, and that through his grace man becomes holy and blessed. He should, therefore, be adored; where he is, sin is not, and therefore, for the purification of the mind, he should always be thought of and meditated on. The ways to God usually followed are, he says, inefficacious and as such may be thrown into the fire.</p>
<p>XXII. Vallabha.</p>
<p>§ 62. We will now turn our attention to the more extensive and almost exclusive cult of the Kṛṣṇa of Gokula. The founder of it was Vallabha. He was the son of a Tailaṅga Brāhmaṇa named Lakṣmaṇa Bhaṭṭa, who was a student of the Black Yajurveda and lived at a village named Kānkarava in the Telugu country. On one occasion Lakṣmaṇa Bhaṭṭa went on a pilgrimage to Benares. with his wife, Elamāgāra. On the way she gave birth to a son on the eleventh of the dark half of Vaiśākha of the Vikrama year</p>
<p>1535, corresponding to 1479 A.D.<sup id="fnref:62"><a href="#fn:62" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">62</a></sup> That son was known as Vallabha.</p>
<p>Vallabha lived for some time in Vṛndāvana and for some time. at Mathurā. About that time it is alleged that Gopāla-Krṣṇa manifested himself on the Govardhana Hill by the name of Devadamana, called also Śrī-Nāthajī. The God told Vallabha in at dream to come and see him, informing him that his companions in the cow-settlement, when he became incarnate as Krṣṇa, were born again in the present age, and commissioned him to make. them his attendants, that he might sport with them as in the former age. Accordingly, Vallabha went and saw Devadamana or Śrī-Nāthajī. Śrī-Nāthajī commanded him to erect a shrine for himself and to promulgate the method of worshipping him, without which a man would not be admissible to the Puṣṭimārga, or the path of divine grace, which Vallabha had founded. The meaning of this seems to be that Vallabha connected his system with a special manifestation of Krṣṇa known by the name of Śrī-Nāthajī².</p>
<p>Vallabha&rsquo;s Vedāntic theory is the same as that of an earlier. author of the name of Viṣṇusvāmin. This Viṣṇusvāmin is said. to have been the son of the councillor of a Draviḍa chief dependent upon the Emperor of Delhi<sup id="fnref:63"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">63</a></sup>. Nābhājīin his Bhaktamālāmakes Jñānadeva, Nāmdeva, Trilocana, and lastly Vallabha his successors⁴. The first was Jñānadeva, who is represented as a follower of his system (Saṁpradāya). He was one of three sons born to a man, who became a householder after he had assumed the order of an ascetic. He was, therefore, excommunicated and was not allowed to learn the Vedas. But he himself by his miraculous. power made a male buffalo repeat the Vedas. This story is the same as that related of the Jñānadeva of Mahārāṣṭra, the author of a Vernacular commentary on the Bhagavadgita. But the Marathas do not know of Viṣṇusvāmin as his Guru, or teacher,or of Jñānadevabeing his successor or follower. If, however, the tradition reported by Nābhājīis correct, Viṣṇusvāmin must have lived about the middle of the thirteenth century. The date of the commentary above alluded to is śaka 1212, corresponding to 1290 A. D.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>2.see Harirāya Mahārāja GovardhanaprākaṭyakīVārtā, published in Sāṁvat 1935, p. 11.</p>
<p>4.Ed. by Khemaraj, Bombay, Śaka 1827 (1905 A. D.). pp. 95-98.</p>
<p>The Vedāntic theory of Viṣṇusvāmin which is the same as that of Vallabha is as follows. The one primeval soul was not joyful, because he was alone (BU. I. 4. 3), and, desiring to be many, he himself became the inanimate world, the individual soul, and the inward controlling soul. These sprang from him like sparks from a burning fire and are his parts (MU. II. 1). By his own inscrutable power he rendered the properties of intelligence and joy imperceptible in the first, and his joy alone in the second, while the third has all the attributes perceptible in it. Simple Brahman as such has perceptible joy prevailing in it¹.</p>
<p>§ 63. The following particulars have been gleaned from two works belonging to Vallabhācārya&rsquo;s sect². The whole world hasBrahman for its material cause. The perception of forms. apparently different from the Brahman is due to ignorance or delusion and to the true nature of Brahman being rendered imperceptible. The individual soul is identical with Brahman, a part of Brahman and atomic. From the Akṣara composed of existence, intelligence, and joy (Saccidānanda) particles come out as sparks from fire. From the predominance of the Sat portion in them the joy portion is concealed, and thus we have the indivi dual souls possessing Sat, existence, and Cit, intelligence. The individual soul is not a form of the Supreme Soul altered by a third thing being involved in it, such as the Māyā (illusive power), but is itself the same substance as the Supreme Soul with one attribute rendered imperceptible. The relation between the two is thus that of identity (Advaita), both being in the pristine unchanged form, i. e., identity of untransformed souls (Śuddhādvaita).</p>
<p>The individual soul is of two kinds: (1) going through the circle</p>
<p>__________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.Sakalācāryamatasaṁgraha by Śrīnivāsa, Chowkh. Series.</p>
<p>2.Śuddhādvaitamārtaṇḍa y Giridhara, and Prameyaratnārṇva by Bālakṛṣṇa Bhaṭṭa ,Chowkh. Series.</p>
<p>of existences, and (2) delivered from the trammels of life. The first is subject to misery in consequence of his delusion that his body and senses are his soul. He remains in this condition till he acquires knowledge, sees the vanity of the world and devotes himself to meditation and the love of God, when he is delivered. The delivered souls are: (1) those who have become so while in their previous condition, by the termination of ignorance or delusion, such as Sanaka and others; and (2) those who dwell in the world of the Bhagavat, other than the pervading Vaikuṇṭha¹, where they attain the condition of pure Brahman by the favour of the Bhagavat; (3) there are others, who, having the divine nature in them, and coming in contact with good men, resort to various ways of Bhakti, or the propitiation of God, until perfect love alone for Him comes to dwell in their heart, and finally become the associates of the Bhagavat in His eternal sports and amusements. This last is the Mokṣa, or deliverance.</p>
<p>That class of worldly souls who have no divine nature in them, and in whom evil predominates, are ever moving in the circle of existences. The souls who have the divine nature in them are of two kinds: (1) those who subject themselves to certain moral. discipline (Maryādājīva), and (2) those who depend entirely on God&rsquo;s grace (Puṣṭjīva). Both attain final deliverance, but there is a difference which corresponds to that between (2) and (3) above and which will be further explained below.</p>
<p>Śrī-Kṛṣṇa is the highest Brahman. He has hands and feet not made up of ordinary matter (Aprākṛta), but celestial. His body consists of Sat, existence; Cit, intelligence; Ānanda, joy. He is called Puruṣottama, as the most excellent of all beings, and has all attributes which are not ordinary, but celestial. All his sports</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.I translate the word Vyāpi-Vaikuṇṭha thus. The Vyāpi-Vaikuṇṭha above the Vaikuṇṭha of Viṣṇu, the protector of the world. There dwells. Puruṣottama, who manifests himself variously to his various devotees. To those in whom Bhakti has risen to the highest pitch and has become baunting passion be manifests himself as the sportive. Krṣṇa. In a portion of the Vyāpi-Vaikuṇṭha there is the Goloka with Vṛndāvana in which there are extensive trees, bowers of croopers, and the river Yamunā. The highest Bhaktas are transferred to this Vṛndāvana, and Krṣṇa sports with them there.</p>
<p>are eternal. He, with his four arms or two arms, sports with his various devotees, or Bhaktas, in the extensive Vaikuṇṭha, which contains Vṛndāvana with its large forests. Krṣṇa is, therefore. the hight joy (Paramānanda). By his will, his Sattva portion overcomes the Ānanda or joy portion, and, becoming Akṣara, or unchangeable, he is the cause of all causes and creates the world. Then Akṣarabrahman is of two kinds: (1) that which is recognised by the devotees as the place of Puruṣottama, which has the attributes of the extensive Vaikuṇṭha and others; (2) to the enlightened it appears in the form of existence, intelligence and joy, infinite in time and space, self-manifesting and devoid of all qualities Therefore, in the form in which the enlightened see it, all the positive qualities are hidden or rendered imperceptible by the inscrutable power referred to above, and therefore they are not to be regarded as non-existing. When Brahman is spoken of as devoid of all qualities, what is meant is just this. There are thus. three forms of the Supreme Being, Puruṣottama and the two kinds of the Unchangeable here mentioned.</p>
<p>To explain the controlling of all by Puruṣottama, that form of his that dwells in the sun, the gods, the earth, etc., is called Antaryāmin (the inward controller). It is this inward controller that becomes incarnate in the various forms usually mentioned. The celestial Sattva quatity of Krṣṇa becomes Viṣṇu, and in this form he becomes the protector of all. Similarly the qualities of Rajas and Tamas assume the forms of Brahmadeva and Siva for discharging the functions of creation and destruction.</p>
<p>Puṣṭi is the grace (Anugraha) of God which is to be inferred from its fruit or the results, which are ordinary, or of this world, and extraordinary, or of the next world. Mahāpuṣṭi, or the highest grace, is that which removes great obstacles and conduces: to the attainment of God himself. Puṣṭi enables one to attain the four objects of life. Extraordinary, or special Pusti, conduces to Bhakti, which leads to the attainment of God. The Bhakti, or devotion generated by this special grace, is called Puṣṭibhakti The frame of mind generated by this kind of devotion is the desire of the attainment of God to the exclusion of everything else.</p>
<p>This Puṣṭibhakti is of four kinds: (1) Pravāha-Puṣṭibbakti,</p>
<p>(2) Maryādā-Puṣṭibhakti, (3) Puṣṭi-Puṣṭibhakti, (4) Śuddha-Puṣṭibhakti. The first is the path of those who, while engaged in a worldly life with its me and mine, which is compared to a stream (Pravāha), do acts calculated to bring about the attainment of God. The second is of those who, withdrawing their minds from worldly enjoyments, devote themselves to God by hearing discourses about him, singing his name, and such other processes. The third is of those who already enjoying God&rsquo;s grace are made by another grace competent to acquire knowledge useful for adoration; and thus they come to know all about the ways of God. The followers of this path have to depend on their own efforts for the acquisition of knowledge referred to. The fourth is of those who through mere love devote themselves to the singing and praising of God as if it were a haunting passion. This Bhakti is generated by God himself and does not depend upon man&rsquo;s will as the third, mentioned above, does. First a liking for Himself is generated by God in the mind of a man to whom his grace extends. Then a man sets about acquiring knowledge about God, and all this is called Premabhakti (love-adoration). Now the stages in the development of this are as follows: (1) love or liking (Preman), (2) attachment or addictedness (Āsakti), (3) a haunting passion, which is the mature condition of the first two (Vyasana).</p>
<p>The haunting passion leads to attainment of the end, that is, the highest bliss. Those in whom Bhakti has attained to this pitch reject with scorn the four kinds of Mukti and choose the eternal service of Hari, as noticed in the section on the Pāñcarātra system. By the haunting passion about Hari he is seen everywhere, and therefore everything becomes an object of love, and the devotee identifies himself with everything. Then the inner and the outer world is, for the devotee, full of Puruṣottama, or the highest soul.</p>
<p>The final fruit of this devotion is admission to the eternal sports of Krṣṇa. The Bhaktas join in these sports, assuming the forms of cows, beasts, birds, trees, rivers, etc., and enjoy the company of Puruṣottama, which confers boundless joy. These eternal sports are like those which Krṣṇa went through when he</p>
<p>became incarnate in Vraja and Vṛndāvana. Some of the devoteer become, in the celestial Vrndāvana, Gopas and Gopīs and join is the sports. The Maryādābhaktas attain Mukti called Sāyujya which consists in being one with Hari. The Puṣṭibhaktas reject it with scorn and seek for participation in the sports of Hari.</p>
<p>§ 64. These are the doctrines of the school of Vallabha. will now proceed to give a short description of the practical modes of worship. Vallabha had a son named Viṭṭhaleśa, and they are spoken of respectively as Ācārya and Gosāīṁor Gosvāmin. The latter had seven sons of the names of Giridhara Govindarāya, Bālakṛṣṇa, Gokulanātha, Raghunātha, Yadunātha, and Ghanaśyāma. The Gurus of this sect ordinarily called Mahārājas are descendants of these seven. Each Guru has a temple of his own, and there are no public places of worship. The devotee should visit the temple of his Guru at stated intervals, which are eight in number during the day. The mode of worship is as follows.</p>
<p>The conductor of the worship should rise early in the morning, utter the name of Bhagavat and rinse his mouth and drink a little of the washings of the feet [of Bhagavat], and, with his face to the north or the east, should utter the name of the Ācārya and pray to him and make a bow. The same should be done to Viṭṭhaleśa and the names of his seven sons should be uttered, as well as of one&rsquo;s own Guru, and then a bow should be made to Kṛṣṇa after uttering the names Govardhana and others. Then the river Yamunāshould be remembered and bowed to, and six stanzas of a poem called Bhramaragītā should be repeated; and then the Gopīs, or cowherdesses, should be adored.</p>
<p>After this the worshipper should answer the call of nature, wash his hands, feet and face, and then drink a portion of the washings of the feet of Krṣṇa, and eat the residue of the betel leaves supposed to be eaten by Krṣṇa. Then he should besmear his body with oil and bathe. After bathing he should drink in a little water, after repeating the name of Nārāyaṇa. Then he should make a perpendicular mark on his forehead with white earth, the mark of a lotus on the bosom and of a bamboo leaf on the arms, etc., twelve in all, to represent the twelve</p>
<p>forms of Viṣṇu, Keśava, Nārāyaṇa, Mādhava, etc. He should then print the forms of the various weapons of Viṣṇu on his body, and then, saluting Vallabhācārya, should adore Krṣṇa with the Gopīs. Heshould then open the door of the temple, and going into the sleeping apartments, bring out the wreaths of flowers and all other things used on the previous day, and then sweep and clean the apartments. He should then brush the throne and make all the arrangements necessary for the reception of Krṣṇa awakened from sleep.</p>
<p>He should then approach the bed-room and sing a song calling upon Krṣṇa to rise from sleep, to take the refreshments prepared for him and to go with his companions to the forest for grazing. the cows. Krṣṇa should be brought out and placed on the throne. Rādhāshould be placed to his left hand, and then the worshipper should prostrate himself before her. The refreshments already prepared should then be placed before them, and they should be requested to eat them. Then the bed should be dusted and cleaned and then Krṣṇa should be made to wash his mouth. Other refreshments should be then placed before the two. And at the end of all an Āratī, or waving of lamps, should be gone through with a song. Vallabhācārya should then be saluted.</p>
<p>Then comes the bath of Krṣṇa. After bathing saffron paint should be applied. Then he should be dressed and milk given to him. Afterwards by the churning of milk, froth should be prepared and offered to Krṣṇa. He should be then told to wash his mouth. with water. Then betel leaves should be offered to him. Then a cradle should be adorned and Krṣṇa should he told to get into. it, and then it should be rocked and toys should be got ready for the divine boy.</p>
<p>Afterwards the mid-day dinner should be prepared. A Caukā, or a small four-legged table, should be placed before him and viands of all kinds in cups should be put on the table. The lord should then be told to eat them. A little rice should be placed in a small plate and, mixed with ghee, five or seven mouthfuls. should be held before him. Then lamps should be waved about him. Subsequently all the other dishes should be offered. In this manner the ceremonies go on. A meal is again prepared</p>
<p>at night and Krṣṇa is laid on the sleeping cot and made to sleep again.</p>
<p>Thus the order of the ceremonies is as follows: (1) the ringing of the bell; (2) the blowing of the conoh-shell, (3) awakening of the Lord (Thākurji) and offering morning refreshments, (4) waving of lamps, (5) bathing, (6) dressing, (7) Gopīvallabha food, (8) leading the cows out for grazing, (9) the mid-day dinner, (10) waving of lamps; (11) after the last, the screen is drawn up and the God cannot be seen; this interval is called Anosara or Anavasara,-i. e., no time for seeing him,-(12) the finishing up, (13) the evening meal, (14) going to bed.</p>
<p>Besides the ordinary worship detailed above, the followers of this sect hold a number of feasts and festivals, some of which are in honour of Vallabhācārya, his son and seven grandsons. The influence exercised by Vallabha and his successors over their adherents seems to have been immense, and this has come down to their descendants or existing Gurus of the sect also. This is kept up by the fact that the God cannot be worshipped independently in a public place of worship, but in the house and temple of the Guru or the Maharaja, which therefore has to be regularly visited by the devotees with offerings. The followers of this system consist principally of the trading classes of Gujarāt, Rājputāna and further to the north about Mathura. The principal doctrine which these latter are taught is that all their belongings should be dedicated to their Guru; and this doctrine is not seldom carried to an extreme.</p>
<p>Among the different kinds of Bhakti mentioned above there is only one which contemplates non-attachment to worldly objects. The highest Bhakti as well as the others are generated in the heart of man by the grace of God, and the first even ripens into a haunting passion. This grace of God one may enjoy even while engaged in a worldly life. The Maryādā-Puṣṭi, which is one of the four forms and requires the restraint of passions, does not conduce to the attainment of the highest bliss, which consists in joining in the eternal sports of Hari in the Goloka. The spirit of this system, therefore, sooms to be sportive enjoyments and it connot but be expected to influence the ordinary life of its</p>
<p>followers. Moral rigidity oulminating in indifference to worldly enjoyments and self-abnegation does not appear to be a characteristicof this school. Vallabhācārya himself was a married man, and so were all his successors and so are all the Gurus of the seot, who are as much men of the world as their followers.</p>
<p>§65. From the account we have given, it will be seen that the fourth element of Vaiṣṇavism, that we have described in a preceding section, alone constitutes the religion of Vallabha. The sportive boy Krṣṇa of the cow-settlement with all his pranks is the highest god of this school, and his mistress Rādhā, who is mentioned only in the later books and dignified into his eternal consort, as will be mentioned further on, is the object of the deepest adoration. This sportive Krṣṇa with his Rādhā is transferred to a heaven which is in a region higher than the ordinary Vaikuṇṭha of Nārāyaṇa or Viṣṇu, and is called Goloka. The highest aim of man&rsquo;s life is to get to this place and join in the sports Thus the doings of Krṣṇa in Gokula, and his relations. with the men and women as well as the inferior animals, trees, and even the river Yamunā, constitute the basis of Vallabha&rsquo;s system and also its goal when transferred to Goloka.</p>
<p>XXIII. Caitanya.</p>
<p>§ 66. About the same time as Vallabha, there flourished in Bengal another propagator of the religion of Rādhā and Krṣṇa , who is known by the name of Caitanya. The prominent distinction between the two appears to be, that while Vallabha and those who followed him developed the ceremonial side of the religion, Caitanya and his successors devoted themselves to the cultivation of the emotional side, Caitanya endeavoured to win the hearts of man, by instituting Kirtanas or the fervent singing of songs about the love of Rādhā and Krṣṇa and other devotional matters. The love of the cow-herd god and his mistress. had already become the subject of bewitching songs by Jayadeva in Sanskrit and by other poets in the Vernacular.</p>
<p>Caitanya also was a more courageous reformer in so far as he cried down the mechanical religious ceremonial of the prevalent Hinduism, and preached spiritual devotion and at the same time condemned the distinctions of onstes, and admitted all, including even Mahomedans, as his pupils.</p>
<p>§ 67. Caitanya&rsquo;s original name was Bisambhar (Viśvaṁbhara) Miśra, and his father&rsquo;s name was Jagannātha Miśra and mother&rsquo;s SacīDebī. The father lived originally in Sylhet in Eastern Bengal, but had emigrated to Nadiya (Nabadvīpa) before the birth of Bisambhar, his youngest son. The eldest son&rsquo;s name was Bisvarūpa, who is called Nityānanda in the history of Caitanya. These were the only two sons of Jagannātha, and between these were eight daughters, who died young.</p>
<p>Caitanya was born on the full-moon day of Phālguna in the year 1407 of the Śaka era, corresponding to 1485 A. D. He was afterwards called KrṣṇaCaitanya and was considered by his disciples an incarnation of Krṣṇa himself. As such he is reported to have played pranks with the women of the village, which, however, cannot be considered as historically true. Caitanya is also known by the name of Gaurāṅga, i. e., possessed of a fair and not a dark body, and Gauracandra, or a fair moon. When he was eighteen years of age, he married a wife of the name of LachmīDebīand began to live the life of a householder, taking pupils and giving them secular instruction. Soon after he took. to a wandering life and visited many places in Eastern Bengal. Begging and singing were his occupation, and he is said to have. collected a great deal of money. During his peregrinations his wife died, and on his return home he married another. When he was about twenty-three years of age, he went to Gayāto make offerings to his manes and on his return he began the mission of his life. He condemned the ritualistic system of the Brāhmaṇas and proached faith in Hari and the love of Him as well as singing His name as the only effectual ways to salvation. He also preached the doctrine of the brotherhood of men, denouncing the system of castes.</p>
<p>It is stated that the doctrine of faith and love had been preached before Caitanya by a person of the name Advaitācārys, whose practice it was, after the performance of the usual Brahmanic rites, to go to the banks of the Ganges and call out for the appearance of God to substitute the doctrine of faith and love for</p>
<p>that of the performance of various rites. It is also said that this. Ācārya was at first the instructor of Caitanya and afterwards. became his pupil. Whatever it may have been, the new doctrine was first publicly proclaimed to the exclusion of others. by Kṛṣṇa Caitanya.He was assisted by his brother Nityānanda, who was regarded as an incarnation of Balarāma, the brother of the god Kṛṣṇa.</p>
<p>Caitanya now began to hold meetings for the singing and glorification of the name of Hari. These were at first private. and held in the house of a pupil named Srībāsa. The doings of these devotees met with scorn and ridicule, especially at the hands of the worshippers of Kālī, one of whom put red flowers. and goat&rsquo;s blood on the steps of the door of the house in which the Vaiṣṇva meetings were held. The fervour displayed at these Kīrtanas, or singing of the name of Hari, gradually increased in intensity, until the loud singers, and principally Caitanya himself, swooned away and dropped senseless on the ground.</p>
<p>In the year 1510 Caitanya became a Saṁnyāsin, or an ascetic, and was initiated into the order by Keśab Bhāratīof Katva. After this he first went to Purīto visit the shrine of Jagannātha, and thence wandered about the country for six years preaching his new faith¹. On one occasion he went to Benares, where he is reported to have held a disputation with Prakāśānanda,a teacher of the monistic Vedānta of Śaṁkarācārya. Caitanya condemned Śaṁkara&rsquo;s commentary on the Vedāntasūtra and said that it mystified the sense of the original. Śaṁkarācārya did not give the plain ordinary sense of the words of Bādarāyaṇa but forced his own views into them. The doctrine of development (Pariṇāmavāda) was held by the author of the Sūtras, whileŚaṁkarācārya rejects it and brings in his doctrine of illusion. (Vivartavāda). The former alone is true according to Caitanya. After these wanderings he returned to Purī, where he spent the last eighteen years of his life, and died in Śaka1455, corresponding to 1533 A. D.</p>
<p>§ 68. Some of the doctrines attributed to Caitanya are as</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.The above is no abstract of the account given by J. Beames in his paper published in Ind. Ant. Vol. II, pp. 1 ff.</p>
<p>follows. Kṛṣṇa is the highest god and is so beautiful that he excites love for himself even in the heart of the God of love, and is enamoured of himself. His Parabrahmaśakti (power) pervades the universe and assumes a corporeal form by his wondercreating power (Māyāśakti), though he is the soul of all. He possesses a self-multiplying power (Vilāsaśakti) which is of two kinds. By one of these, in sporting with the cowherdesses, he bocame as many Krṣṇas as were sufficient to give one to every two of them (Prābhavavilāsa ). By the other self-multiplying power (Vaibhavavilāsa) he assumes the forms of the four Vyūhas, or forms of Vāsudeva, Samkarsaṇa, etc., Vāsudeva representing intelligence, SSaṁkarṣaṇa, consciousness, Pradyumna, the love, and Aniruddha, sprotiveness.</p>
<p>Here, it will be seen, the functions of the four Vyūhas are changed, and the principle of love is attributed to Pradyumna, instead of that of the mind as in the older system, and that of sportiveness, instead of self-consciousness, which is transferred to Saṁkarṣaṇa, is attributed to Aniruddha. This change is in consonance with a system of which love and sport form the distin guishing characteristics. All the usual incarnations spring from one or other of the Vyūhas. According as the quality of Sattva, Rajas, or Tamas predominates, Krṣṇa becomes Viṣṇu, Brahmadeva, or Śiva, respectively.</p>
<p>The sports of Krṣṇa go on always, as the rising and setting. of the sun. His eternal sports are carried on in the Goloka, Krṣṇa has three powers: the internal which is intelligence, the external which generates appearances, and the differentiated which forms the Jīva, or individual soul. His chief power is that which creates dilatation of the heart, or joy. This appears to be the power of love. When this love becomes settled in the heart of the devoteo, it constitutes Mahābhāva, or the best feeling. When love attains to the highest pitch, it constitutes itself into Rādhā, who is the most loveable of all and full of all qualities. She was the object of the highest love of Krṣṇa, and being idealised as love, some of the agreeable feelings of the heart are considered her ornaments. The sports of the cowherdesses were due to simple love (Preman), and this it was that Uddhava and other devotees sought to attain.</p>
<p>The Supreme Soul (Paramātman) is boundless and is full intelligence itself. The individual soul is an atom having nintelligence. They are necessarily connected together and this connection can never be destroyed. Kṛṣṇa is the support (Āśraya) and Jīva resta on him (Āśrita ). The relation between the two is identity as well as difference. Thus the Vedāntic theory of Caitanya&rsquo;s system is the same as that of Nimbārka. As the beet is distinct from the honey and hovers about it, and, when it drinks it, is full of it, i. e., is one with it, so the individual soul is at first distinct from the Supreme Soul, seeks the Supreme Soul consistently and continuously, and, when through love he is full of the Supreme Soul, he becomes unconscious of his individual. existence, and becomes, as it were, absorbed in him. Herein is. described the ecstatic condition in which the individual soul becomes one with God, though they are really distinct. Kṛṣṇa is the lord of the power of delusion or ignorance (Māyā), and Jīva is the slave of it. When the latter cuts off its shackles, he dis- tinctly sees his own nature and his true relation to God. Kṛṣṇa is to be approached and attained by Bhakti alone¹.</p>
<p>§ 69. Kṛṣṇa Caitanya, Nityānanda and Advaitānanda are called the three Prabhus, or masters of the sect. The descendants. of Nityānanda live at Nadiya, and those of Advaita at Śāntipur. They are the spiritual heads of the sect. Nityānanda was appointed by Caitanya himself as the superior of the church. His female descendants live at Bālegor, and male ones at Khordunear Barrackpur. There are temples belonging to Caitanya&rsquo;s followers at Māthurā, Vṛndāvana, and three principal ones in Bengal one at Nadiya dedicated to Caitanya, the other at Ambikā, to Nityānanda, and the third at Agradvipa, to Gopinātha. There is a shrine dedicated to Caitanya in the vicinity of Dhākādakṣiṇa in Northern Sylhet, where his father originally lived. It is visited by pilgrims from all parts of the district and even from Bengal. At Khetur, in the Rajaṣāhi district, a temple is erected in his honour, where a religious fair is held in the month of October, which is attended by about 25,000 persons.</p>

<p>The sectarian marks worn by the followers of Caitanya ara two white perpendicular lines on the forehead joined together at the bridge of the nose and a line continued up to the tip of the nose. They also use necklaces of three strings of Tulast berds and a rosary of the same, as a help in the muttering of Hari&rsquo;s The worship of Gurus, or spiritual heads, as gods characterises this system. Most of Advaita&rsquo;s followers observe caste distinctions, but a minority consists of Bairāgis, or recluses In one branch of the sect there are monks as well as nuns. They live in the same convent. And there is only And there is only a platonic relation between them.</p>
<p>A person of the name of Rām Saram Pāl of the Sadgopa caste founded about two hundred years ago a branch of the sect called Kartābhājas, or worshippers of the Kartā, or headman. It admits of recruits from all castes and observes no distinction. The founder, also called Kartā Bābā, died at Ghoṣapur, and his votaries assemble periodically to do honour to him. The spiritual teachers of Caitanya&rsquo;s sect, whether male or female, are celibates.</p>
<p>The three Prabhus, or masters, did not leave any compositions. But Caitanya&rsquo;s pupils, especially Rūpa and Sanātana, wrote s great deal. A work by the latter entitled Rasāmṛtasindhu contains an analysis of the feeling of love, or Bhakti, explaining the states of mind which lead to it and its various forms. A considerable body of literature has grown up round this system of religion.</p>
<p>XXIV. Debasement of Vaiṣṇavism.</p>
<ol start="70">
<li>The worship of Rādhā, more prominently even than that of Kṛṣṇa, has given rise to a sect, the members of which assume the garb of women with all their ordinary manners and affect to be subject even to their monthly sickness. Their appearance and acts are so disgusting that they do not show themselves very much in public, and their number is small. Their goal is the realisation of the position of female companions and attendants of Rādhā; and hence probably they assume the name of Sakhībhāvas (literally, the condition of companions). They deserve notice here only to show that, when the female element is idolised and made the object of special worship, such disgusting corruptions must ensue. The worship of Durgāin the form of Tripurasundarī has led to the same result.</li>
</ol>
<p>Though the Vaiṣṇava systems of Nimbārka, Vallabha and Caitanys are based on the fourth element of Vaiṣṇavism that wer have pointed out in a precoding Section, still that element has undergone an important modification. Before, Kṛṣṇa was a person who had amorous dalliances with the Gopīs generally. But now Kṛṣṇa had a definite consort in Rādhā, who had a large number of female companions, who were probably the original Gopīs. She is indissolubly united with him in the creed of worshippers.</p>
<p>This Rādhā is not mentioned by name in the Harivaṁśa, Viṣṇu-Purāṇa and the Bhāgavata. In the last, however, among the cowherdesses engaged in Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s amorous sports in Vṛndāvana on an autumnal moonlight night, there was one with whom the youthful god carred on his dalliance further, after he had become invisible to the rest. This woman became proud of Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s special attachment for her, whereupon the god disappeared from her also. Here was contained a suggestion which probably led to the creation of Rādhāin later times. In the apocryphal Nāradapañcaāátra-Saṁhitā, as mentioned before<sup id="fnref:64"><a href="#fn:64" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">64</a></sup>, the one single lord is represented to have become two, one a woman and the other a man, who was he himself. He then bad amorous intercourse with her. The woman was Rādhā. In the Brahmavaivarta-Purāṇa she has been made to spring from the primordial body of Kṛṣṇa forming its left. side, and is eternally associated with him in his amorous sports in this world as well as the world of cows (Goloka). The name of Rukmiṇi occurs in the ordinary form of Kṛṣṇaism, but in the systems named above it is entirely absent. The introduction of Rādhā&rsquo;s name, and her elevation to a higher position even than Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s, operated as a degrading element in Vaiṣṇavism, not only because she was a woman, but also because she was originally a mistress of the cowhard god, and her amorous dealing were of an overt character.</p>
<p>In the Rāma cultus, Sītāis a dutiful and loving wife, and is</p>
<p>benignant towards the devotees of her husband. She holds a postition entirely subordinate to Rāma, while Rādhāis often preferredto Kṛṣṇa. There is no amorous suggestion in her story as in that of Rādhā, and consequently the moral influence of Rāmaism is more wholesome. Kabīr does not, so far as I know, mention the name of Sītāat all. He was a strict monotheist, and his Rāma was the supreme lord (Sāheb) only. Those other teachers who followed him maintain the same attitude, so that the Rāma cultus represents a saner and purer form of Hindu religious thought than Rādhākṛṣnaism.</p>
<p>XXV. Nāmadev and Tukārām.</p>
<p>§ 71. The popular Vaiṣṇavism of the Maratha country centres itself round the shrine of Viṭhobāat Paṇḍharpur, which is a city situated on the banks of the Bhīmāor Bhīmarathī. The full name of the god is Viṭṭhal, which is not a Sanskrit name, but the etymology is clear enough. It is stated that the corruption of the Sanskrit name Viṣṇu in the Canarese language is Viṭṭhu, and this looks probable, since Kṛṣṇa is corrupted into Kuṣṭa in the Goanese dialect and Kuṭṭa, Kiṭṭi, or Kṛṣṭa in the Canarese; and we have seen that Viṣṇu, the first portion of the name of the. Hoysala prince Viṣṇuvardhana, was corrupted to Viṭṭi or Biṭṭi<sup id="fnref:65"><a href="#fn:65" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">65</a></sup>. The terminations bāand la are appended to the name Viṣṇu or Viṭṭu to indicate additional sense such as tenderness or reverence. When the shrine was established, we have not the means of determining, but we have clear evidence of its being in existence in the middle of the thirteenth century. In a copperplate Inscription of the reign of Kṛṣṇa of the Yādava dynasty of Devagiri, it is stated that Malliseṭṭi, a general and viceroy of the king, made, while engaged on a military expedition, the grant of a village in the Belgaum district at Pauṇḍarīkakśetra, a holy place situated on the Bhīmarathī, in the vicinity of the god Viṣṇu, in the year. 1171 of the Śaka era corresponding to 1249 A.D<sup id="fnref:66"><a href="#fn:66" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">66</a></sup>. Now if the Pauṇḍarīkakśetra was situated on the Bhīmarathī or Bhīmāriver, it is certainly not unreasonable to suppose that is was the same as Paṇḍharīwhich is the alternative name of Paṇḍharpur; and</p>
<p>the god in whose vicinity the grant was made must therefore. have been Viṭṭhal , or Viṭhobā, here mentioned by his Sanskrit name and not the popular Canarose corruption. In another Inscription on stone, existing at Paṇḍharpur itself and dated 1192 Śaka, which corresponds to 1270 A. D., Bhānu the son of Keśava, is represented to have performed an Aptoryāma sacrifice in Pāṇḍuraṅgapura, in consequence of which crowds of people, and Viṭṭhal a together with the gods, were greatly gratified¹.Here we have another name of Paṇḍharpur, and that was probably given to it because it was the city of Pāṇḍuraṅga.</p>
<p>Pāṇḍaraṅga, or Pāṇḍuraṅga, is according to Hemacandra a name of Rudra or Śiva<sup id="fnref:67"><a href="#fn:67" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">67</a></sup>. And we have a temple of Śiva at Paṇḍharpur, and pilgrims have to visit it first before going to that of Viṭhoba or Viṭṭhal Pāṇḍuraṅga, which is the same as the Pāṇḍuraṅga of Hemcandra, is however in modern times a popular name for Viṭṭhal .Whether then the city was called. Pāṇḍuraṅgapura on account of it containing the temple of Viṣṇu or Viṭṭhal , or that of Śiva is doubtful. But from the wording of the Inscription, in which Viṭṭhal a and Pāṇḍuraṅgapuraare mentioned independently, it would appear as if Viṭṭhal had no connection with the name, and it was given to the city on account of its containing a Śiva temple. But when Viṭhoba&rsquo;s importance increased in later times so vastly that Śiva was thrown entirely into the shade, Panduranga became identical with Viṭṭhala.</p>
<p>The name Pauṇḍarīkaoccuring in the first Inscription seems to owe its origin to a man named Pauṇḍarīka, the popular legend about whom is to the following effect. The region about Paṇḍharpur was, it is said, a forest of the name of Diṇḍiravana. There lived a man of the name of Pauṇḍalīka, who spent all his time in the service of his aged parents, and the god Kṛṣṇawas pleased. with his devotion to them. In the meantime, while Kṛṣṇa Was living at Dvāraka, he remembered Rādhā, who was the object of</p>

<p>1.Early History of the Deccan, Second Ed., p. 115, in which, however, Keśava, the father of Bhānu, is by mistake represented as the sacrificer. [= Volume III of this Edition, page 161.— N. B. U. ]</p>
<p>his fervent love while he was in Gokula. Rādhā, who had, after Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s leaving Gokula, betaken herself to a residence in the Himālaya mountain, for the practice of austerities in consequenos of her separation from Kṛṣṇa, came to know of this through her innate cognitive power, and came at once to Dvārakāand sat on the lap of Kṛṣṇa. Some time after Rukmiṇī, the wedded wife of Kṛṣṇa, came to the place, and Rādhā did not rise up to honour her, as every other woman in similar circumstances did at her approach. Kṛṣṇa even did not take Rādhā to task for this dishonour of Rukmīṇī, and Rukmīṇī got offended, left Dvāraka and wandered about, until she came to Diṇḍiravana, and rested there on the site of the modern Paṇḍharpur. Kṛṣṇa was filled with sorrow at the disappearance of Rukmīṇī and went about in quest of her to all parts of the country, until he came to the place where Rukmiṇī was lying. After some explanations she was reconciled to him, and Kṛṣṇa then went to the hut of Puṇḍalīka to reward him for his devotion to his parents by personal manifestation. Puṇḍalīka being engaged in attending to the wants of his father and mother, was not able to greet him at, once, and threw back a brick (Marāṭhī: vīt) and asked him to stand on it and wait for him until he finished what he was engaged on. Kṛṣṇa stood on the brick and there he was joined by Rukmiṇī, and thus the shrine of Paṇḍharpur grew up.</p>
<p>Puṇḍalīka has been referred to as the originator of the Viṭṭhal cult of devotion both by Nāmadev and Tukārām, and that is the popular belief. The legend points to this fact, and we may therefore take him to be the person who promulgated the cult of Viṭṭhobā, or Viṣṇu, in the Maratha country. He established himself at Paṇḍharpur and it must be on that account that the city is called the holy place (Kṣetra) Pauṇḍarīka, which I identify with the modern name Paṇḍharīin the first Inscription. The Paṇḍuraṅgapura of the second may have become the later Puṇḍhrapur.</p>
<p>There is another historical significance in this legend, and that appears to be this. At first, no woman was connected with the Kṛṣṇa worship, as we have seen in the case of the pure Pāñcsrātra or Bhāgavata system. Then came Rādhā to be associated with him in the North, as we have seen, in the systems of</p>
<p>Nimbārka, Vallabha and Caitanya, while Rukmiṇī, the lawful wife, was united with him in the Maratha country. The Kṛṣṇa of Puṇḍhrapur is almost exclusively known by the name of Viṭṭhala or Viṭhobā, and Rukmiṇī by the name of Rakhamāīor Rakhamābāī. In the religious literature of the country, Viṭṭhala, or Kṛṣṇa, is almost exclusively spoken of as Rukmiṇīpati or Rukmiṇīvara, the lord or husband of Rukmiṇī, and not as Rādhā- vallabha, or the lover of Rādhā. Thus the Vaiṣṇavism of the Maratha country, associated as it is with these two names, is more sober and purer than that of the three systems named above. Rāhīthe Marathi form of Rādhikā, is not unknown, but an insignificant place is assigned to her. The sports of Kṛṣṇa in Gokula are also represented occasionally in the mode of worship, but very little importance is attached to them.</p>
<p>This Vaiṣṇavism of the Marāṭha country found a fertile soil among the lower classes, though it has had followers among Brāhmaṇas and other higher classes also. Like the Vaiṣṇavism of the disciples of Rāmānanda, it had no learned or Sanskrit-knowing promulgators, but its prophets were Sūdras, who, however, had the true religious instinct and possessed a clear spiritual insight. Such were Nāmdev and Tukārām.</p>
<p>§ 72. The family of Nāmdev originally lived at the village called Narasi Vāmanī, situated near Karhad in the Satara District, and now known by the name of Bhayē-Narsingpur or Koleṁ-Narsingpur. It belonged to the tailor caste and followed that occupation or of dealers in cloth. The name of Nāmdev&rsquo;s father was DāmāŚet, and that of his mother, Goṇābāī. They migrated to Pauṇḍhrapur, where Nāmdev was born in the Śaka year 1192, corresponding to 1270 A. D. Nāmdev received ordinary education, but showed little capacity for the usual occupation of his family. He became a devoted worshipper of Viṭhobāand had for his Guru a person named VisobāKhecar, who appears to have been a non-idolater. For Nāmdevsays of him that he gave him the following instruction :—</p>
<p>No.191¹. &ldquo;A stone-god never speaks. What possibility then of his removing the disease of mundane existence? A stone.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.Tukaram Tatya&rsquo;s edition, published in Bombay in 1894,</p>
<p>image is regarded as God, but the true God is wholly different. If a stone-god fulfils desires, how is it he breaks when struck. Those who adore a god made of stone, lose everything through their folly. Those who say and hear that a god of stone speaks. to his devotees, are both of them fools. Those who extol the greatness of such a god and call themselves his devotees, should be regarded as worthless persons and their words should not be heard by the ear. If by chiselling a stone, a god is made of it. and is worshipped with care for many years, will he be of use at any time? Do reflect on this well in your mind. Whether a holy place is small or large, there is no god but stone or water. In the village of Dvādasī(Bārsī)¹ instruction was given that. there is no place which is devoid of God. That God was shown to Nāma in his heart, and thus Khecar conferred a blessing on him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The omnipresence of God and his being neither stock nor stone are well brought out here. The omnipotence of God. Nāmdev brings out in the following :—</p>
<p>No. 151. &quot; The Veda has to speak by thy might and the sun. has to move round; such is the might of thee, the lord of the universe ! Knowing this essential truth, I have surrendered myself to thee. By thy might it is that the clouds have to pour down rain, mountains to rest firm and the wind to blow. Nothing. moves at all (without thee). Oh lord Pāṇḍurang ! thou art the cause of all.”</p>
<p>It will thus be seen that, though Nāmdev worshipped the idol at Paṇḍharpur, he had full knowledge of the true nature of God, as given in treatises like the Upanṣiads; and this God it was that he tried to attain.</p>
<p>No.1029. &ldquo;Your mind is full of vices. What is the use of the pilgrimages you make? What is the use of austere practices, if there is no repentance? The sins resulting from a mental act cannot be effaced by the highest holy place (literally: the father of the holy places). The essence of the matter is very simple : Sin is effaced by repentance&rdquo;, so says Nāmā.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.Bārsīis a town near Paṇḍharpur.</p>
<p>No. 887. &quot; Vows, fasts, and austerities are not at all necessary; nor it is necessary for you to go on a pilgrimage. Be you. watchful in your hearts and always sing the name of Hari. It is not necessary to give up eating food or drinking water; fix your mind on the feet of Hari. Yoga or sacrificial ceremonies or giving up objects of desire is not wanted. Realise a fondness for the feet of Hari. Neither is it necessary for you to contemplate (lit. dwell in ) the one without attributes. Hold fast to the lovel of the name of Hari; says Nāmā, be firm in singing the name. and then Paṇḍurang will render himself manifest to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In these two songs Nāmdev urges upon his hearers the total. inefficacy of the usual modes of purification and of the attainment of God, such as pilgrimages, vaws, fasts, or meditation on the absolute, and sacrifices.</p>
<p>No. 245. &quot; Recognise him alone to be a righteous man, who sees Vāsudeva in all objects, eradicting all pride or egoism. The rest are entangled in the shackles of delusion. To him all wealth is like earth and the nine species of gems are mere stones. The two, desire and anger, he has thrown out and cherishes in his heart (lit. house) quietude and forgiveness. He constantly repeats the name of Govinda, not desisting even for a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No.1004. &quot; Firmly grasp the truth which is Nārāyaṇa. Purity of conduct should not be abandoned; one should not be afraid of the censure of people and thus accomplish one&rsquo;s own purpose. Surrender yourself to your loving friend (God), giving up all ostentation and pride. The censure of people should be regarded as praise and their praise not heeded. One should entertain no longing for being respected and honoured, but should nourish in oneself a liking for devotion. This should be rendered firm in the mind and the name of God should not be neglected even for a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In these songs Nāmdev describes the holy condition of him who is a devotee of Vāsudeva and sees him everywhere, and preaches self-surrender to him, regardless of the criticism of the world.</p>
<p>This is a short specimen of the teachings of Nāmdev. Purity of heart, humility, self-surrender, forgiveness, and the love of God</p>
<p>form the sum and substance of it. Nāmdev wrote songs in Hindīalso and some of these are incorporated in the Grantha-Sāheb, or the Bible of the Sikhs. I will here translate two of these<sup id="fnref:68"><a href="#fn:68" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">68</a></sup>:—</p>
<p>No. 2352. &ldquo;He is one, [but] fills and encompassess many; wherever you look yon find him there. There is scarcely one who understands him, all being deluded by the variegated picture. drawn by Māyā(delusive power). Everything is Govinds, everything is Govinda, there is nothing without Govinda. Just as there is one thread and on it are woven breadthwise and length- wise hundreds of thousands of beads, so is everything woven in the lord. The waves, the foam, and the bubbles of water are not different from water. All this extent of the universe is the sport. of Parabrahma, and when we think of it, is not different from it. Illusive phantoms and the objects seen in dreams are regarded as real. When by the instruction of my Guru my mind awoke, I accepted the truth. Reflecting in your mind, see this all to be the creation of Hari, says Nāmdev; in the inside of every indivi- dual thing there is one Murari alone without any interstice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No.2353. &quot; The pitcher is filled and the water brought to bathe the god. There were forty-two hundreds of thousands of animals in it; there was already Viṭṭhal in them. Whom shall I bathe? Wherever we go there is Viṭṭhal and he over sports in joy. Flowers have been brought and wreaths woven of them for worshipping God. First of all the flowers were smelt by the bees, there was Viṭṭhal there; what shall I do? Milk has been brought and cooked for the offering of Khīr² to God. The milk was first tasted by the calf, in it was Viṭṭhal, what shall I do? Here is Viṭṭhal, there is Viṭṭhal, there is no world without Viṭṭhal. This place and that, thou hast filled. Thou hast filled the whole world, says Nāmāhumbly&quot;³.</p>
<p>In these hymns God&rsquo;s omnipresence is described by Nāmdev.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>2. A preparation of milk and rice mixed with sugar.</p>
<p>3.These two hymns have been translated by Macauliffe in Vol. VI, pp. 41-42 of the Sikh Religion. The readings in the Bombay Ed. have been compared with those in the Grantha-Sāheb, pp. 427-28 of the Lucknow Ed. of 1893,</p>
<p>§ 73. The date assigned to the birth of Nāmdev is, as we have seen, Śaka 1192, that is 1270 A. D. This makes him a contemporary of Jñāndev, the author of the Jñāndevī, which was finished. in 1290 A. D. But the Marāṭhīof the latter work is decidedly archaic, while that of Nāmdev&rsquo;s writings has a considerably more. modern appearance. Nāmdev&rsquo;s Hindi too looks more modern. than that of the thirteenth century, when the poet Canda flourished¹. What this is due to, it is difficult to say. But it appears probable that the traditional date of Nāmdev&rsquo;s birth-Śaka 1192-has been pushed backwards and that he is represented as a contemporary of Jñāndev. We have seen in a former section<sup id="fnref:69"><a href="#fn:69" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">69</a></sup>that Nabhāji in naming the successors of Viṣṇusvāmin places. Jiandey first and Nāmdev afterwards. If we are to judge from Nāmdev&rsquo;s Marāṭhī and Hindī, his date must be put later by about. a century.</p>
<p>Some conception, however, of the time when Nāmdev flourished may be formed from the strong and definite sentiments as to the futility of idol-worship, which his instructor is represented (in one of the hymns translated) to have expressed. Khecar, or Visoba Khecar as he is usually called, appears to have been an uncom- promising opponent of idol-worship from the accounts given of him in the existing biographies. All previous writers, including Rāmānuja, as well as a great many that followed, excused idol- worship in some way or other. If then Khecar&rsquo;s attitude towards it was definitely hostile, he and his pupil Nāmdev must have flourished when the Mahomedan influence had for the first time become very powerful. The Mahomedans established themselves in the Deccan in the beginning of the fourteenth century of the Christian era, and their hatred of idol-worship must have taken about a hundred years to make its way into the understanding of religious Hindus.</p>
<p>But a more direct evidence for the fact that Nāmdev flourished after the Mahomedans had established themselves in the Marāṭhācountry is afforded by his mention in a song (No. 364) of thedestruction of idols by the Turaks, i.e.,Turks. The Mahomedang were often called Turaks in early times by the Hindus. Nāmdev, therefore, probably lived about or after the end of the fourteenth century.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.See my Report on the Search for Sanskrit MSS, 1887-1891, page LXXX. [= Volume II of this Edition, p. 343.-N. B. U.]</p>
<p>It will thus be seen that the date of Nāmdev&rsquo;s birth given with such details is quite wrong. Unfortunately the historical spirit has by no means been the distinguishing feature of the intellectual life of us Indians, and we often confuse different persons together, and attribute to one what belongs to another. Some such confusion must have taken place in the present case.</p>
<p><strong>Tukārām</strong></p>
<p>§ 74. Tukārām was born and lived at a village called Dehu, which is about fourteen miles to the north-east of Poona. The name. of the family to which he belonged was More. It was a family of the Marāṭhācaste, which caste may have sprung from the old order of Kṣatriyas, but is considered to belong to the Śūdra order. Nothing specific is known about the date of his birth, but there is no reason for doubting the truth of the date traditionally assigned to his death, which is Śaka 1571, corresponding to 1649 A. D. Hist biographer, Mahīpati, represents him to have become a bankrupt at the end of the first half of his life, when he was twenty-one years of age. From that it is inferred that he lived for 42 years, and he is thus understood to have been born in 1607-8 A. D.</p>
<p>Seven of Tukārām&rsquo;s ancestors were devoted worshippers of the god Viṭhobā. Of these Viśaṁbhara was the first who made regular pilgrimages to Paṇḍharpur, but after some years he constructed a temple in his own village, and placing the idols of Viṭhoba and Rukmāīin it, dedicated it to their worship. Tukārām&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s name was Bolhojīand he followed the occupation of a potty trader. When he became old, he proposed to entrust the affairs of his family and his business to Sāvjī, his eldest son. But Sāvjīwas a man for whom a worldly life had no interest, and he declined to undertake the business. It was, therefore, made over to Tukārām, who was then thirteen years of age. Tukārām managed the affairs somehow, till he became seventeen years old, when his father died. He naturally felt desolate when this occurred. and being a man of simplicity and liable to be imposed upo gby designing persons, his affairs got into disorder and he incurred loss in his trade.</p>
<p>Tukārām was at first married to a wife who was sickly, and some time later he married another of the name of Jijābāīor Āvalī, the daughter of a well-to-do trader in Poona. When hist affairs got into confusion, Āvalī procured a loan for him and set him up again. A short time after, he made a profit in his new trade, and, while coming back from the place to which he had gone for the sale of his goods, he met a man whe was being carried about by the agents of his creditor, and who was crying out for assistance to relieve him from his debt and the impending imprisonment. To this man Tukārām gave all that he possessed-the capital, and the profit that he had made. He returned to Dehu. empty-handed, and soon after there was a famine, which made him a thorough bankrupt, and his first wife died of hunger.</p>
<p>Tukārām then made up his mind to renounce his business, but his younger brother Kānhyā protested against it. Then,sitting on the banks of the Indrāyaṇī, he told his brother to bring all the documents, deeds and bonds relating to their business, divided them. into two parts, gave one to Kānhyā, and told him to live separately from him, and his own share he threw into the river.</p>
<p>Henceforward he devoted himself to the contemplation of God and singing his praises, spending the day on the top of a hill near Dehu and the night at the temple of Viṭhobain the village.</p>
<p>He read the Marāṭhīworks on religious subjects of the saints and sages who had flourished before him. The idea of giving expression to his thoughts and feelings by composing songs in Marāṭhī soon arose in his mind. The metre used by him was that which is known by the name of Abhang, the measure of which is by no means strict or regular, but which is characterised by the use of rhyming words at specific intervals. A single-minded piety and the desire to be of service to all, even by executing their errands, became settled points in his character. Family matters. had to be attended to by his wife, Āvalī, who often found herself in great straits.</p>
<p>Tukārām&rsquo;s chief occupation was the performance of Kīrtans, which consist of religious discourses interspersed with the singing of songs. These discourses gradually became very attractive and drew in crowds of people. The songs he sung at</p>
<p>these had been often prepared by himself, and some were composed. by him extempore while engaged in the discourse.</p>
<p>Tukārām&rsquo;s fame spread about not only in his village, but in the surrounding country, and it evoked jealousy, especially in. the minds of Brāhmaṇas, who had set themselves up as religious teachers; and he was subjected to persecution. He, however, maintained an evenness of temper throughout, though there were. struggles in the mind. His fame reached the ears of the rising prince, Śivājī, the future king of the Marāṭhā. He was eager to hear Tukārām&rsquo;s Kīrtans, and on one occasion invited him into his presence, sending him messengers with torches, umbrella and horses, as emblems of high honour. Tukārām, however, declined to go and sent him a letter written in his usual metre. On another occasion Śivājī attended his Kīrtan at Lohagaon, about six miles from Poona, and placed before him a plate full of golden coins. Tukārām, of course, declined to receive them, and they were distributed among the Brāhmaṇas there. When his end approached, he is reported to have gathered together a large body of his followers and to have proceeded to the banks of the Indrāyaṇī, all singing loudly and enthusiastically the praises of God and fully absorbed in it. When they approached the river, Tukārām suddenly disappeared. No further account of his death has beenhanded down.</p>
<p>§ 75. It has been already stated that Tukārām had acquired a great facility in composing Abhaṅgs. He spoke in Abhaṅgs and wrote in Abhaṅgs. Some of these only could be written and were written, and others were neglected by him or his immediate followers, but retained in the memory of others. The collections, therefore, of his pieces cannot be expected to be of the same size. There are two such printed in Bombay, one containing 4621 pieces and the other 8441. This latter collection is uncritically made and oftentimes one same piece is given a second time with the opening lines omitted. Still, this is a larger collection and contains Abhaṅgs which are not to be found in the first collection, but are quite in the style of Tukārām with the usual fervent devotion and purity of thought.</p>
<p>We will now give a few specimens:—</p>
<p>First collection, No. 2869. &quot; When the auspicious juncture of Siṁhastha¹ comes, it brings fortune only to barbers and priests. There are crores of sins in the heart, but externally a man shaves the hair on the head and the beard. What has been shaved off, has disappeared. Tell me what else has changed. The vicious habits are not changed, which might be regarded as a mark of the destruction of sins: says Tukā, without devotion and faith everything else is useless trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Second collection, No. 4733. &quot; What hast thou done by going to a holy river? Thou hast only outwardly washed thy skin. In what way has the interior been purified? By this thou hast only added a feather to thy cap (lit. prepared a decoration for thyself). Even if the bitter Vṛndāvana fruit is coated with sugar, the settled quality of the interior (bitterness) is in no way lessered. If peace, forgiveness, and sympathy do not come in, why should you take any trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>First coll., No. 90 (1-2). &ldquo;Sesamum seeds and grains of rice thou hast burnt by throwing into fire, but desire and anger are as mischievous as before. Why hast thou taken trouble in vain, giving up the adoration of Pāṇḍurang?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Tukārām condemns religious practices which concern the body only, and mechanical rites, such as giving oblations, and enforces the necessity of striving for the attainment of spiritual virtue and of the adoration of God.</p>
<p>In No. 2383 ( first coll.,) Tukārām condemns the worship of goddesses, JākhāīJokhāī, of gods like Bhairava and even Gaṇapati, and of ghosts and goblins, and earnestly recommends the adoration of him whose consort is Rakhamāī. Tukārām was thus &amp; devotee only of Viṭhobāof Pāṇḍharpur and a monotheist in this sense. Though he worshipped the idol at the place, still he had always before his mind&rsquo;s eye the great Lord of the universe, as the following will show:—</p>
<p>First coll., No. 4361. &ldquo;Thy greatness is unsearchable. Even the Vedas became silent and the power of the mind becomes stunted.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.When Jupiter is in the sign of Lon, the period is considered favourable for the washing away of sins, nad Hindus go to holy places, such as Nasik, shave their heads and mustaches and bathe in the river.</p>
<p>What possibility is there of my mental power reaching Him, whose light it is that the sun and the moon display? Even the thousand-tongued (the great serpent) is unable to expound thy greatness. How then shall I be able to do so? Says Tukā, we are thy children, thou art our mother place us under the shadow (protection) of thy grace.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Fist coll., No. 4419. &quot; All the world says that there is not a space so minute as a sesamum seed without thee. The old Ṛṣis, sages, poious and holy men said that thou art in the heart of all these things&hellip;&hellip;..Thou hast filled up numberless universes and also a residue still remained. But to me thou hast become. inaccessible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>First Coll., No. 1870. &quot; God is ours, certainly ours, and is the soul of all souls. God is near to us, certainly near, outside and inside. God is benignant, certainly benignant, and fulfils every longing even of a longing nature. God protects us, certainly protects us, and subdues strife and death. God is merciful, certainly merciful, and protects Tukā.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This great God is to be attained only by devoted love and by no other means:—</p>
<p>First coll., No. 810. &quot; This thy nature is beyond the grasp of the mind or of words; and therefore I have made devoted love a measure. I measure the Endless by the measure of love; he is not to be truly measured by any other means. Thou art not to be found by processes of concentration (Yoga), sacrificial rites, practice of austerities, and any bodily exertions, nor by knowledge. Oh Keśave, accept the service which we render to thee in the simplicity of our hearts.&quot;</p>
<p>There is peace and pure indescribable bliss in seeing God:—</p>
<p>Second coll., No. 1411. &quot; Oh Nārāyaṇa, the peace arising. from rest is truly not to be attained without thy feet; even if modes and methods are followed for crores of Kalpas<sup id="fnref:70"><a href="#fn:70" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">70</a></sup>, bliss will not ensue. The bliss of bliss, which is interminable and boundless, which is enjoyed by Hari and Hara, manifest to me, oh thou ! the</p>
<p>sustainer of my soul, oh omniscient, those feet of thine I which produce it ],&quot;</p>
<p>But this God is not to be seen by those whose passions are unrestrained:—</p>
<p>First coll., No. 4420. &quot; The Endless is beyond, and between him and me there are the lofty mountains of desire and anger. I am not able to ascend them, nor do I find any pass. Insurmountable is the ascent of my (mountain-like) enemies. What possibility is there of my attaining Nārāyaṇa, my friend? Pāṇḍuraṅg is lost to me; says Tukā, it is now plain that this valuable life of mine has gone for nothing.&quot;</p>
<p>To curb these passions becomes now his great and earnest aim. He examines his heart carefully and on all occasions in life finds. them present there in one shape or another with all his efforts he fails to restrain them; and addresses fervent prayers again and again to God to help him. The number of these is very large:—</p>
<p>Secord Coll, No. 1430. &quot; With whose support shall I gird up my loins? Oh Pāṇḍuraṅg, I feel depressed. All wicked persons abide in my frame and my mind is subdued by them. All my efforts have proved fruitless. What shall I do? Thou art the only. mother of the helpless; says Tukā, those wicked persons will not leave my frame without thy might.&quot;</p>
<p>The wicked persons are passions.</p>
<p>When in the course of years, Tukārām became famous and was praised everywhere, he found a glow of satisfaction gathering strength in his heart. This he recognised as pride or conceit, and he was greatly afraid of it, and again and again prayed to God to free him from this pride and bestow humility of spirit:—</p>
<p>First coll., No. 1779: &quot; I have become an expert in the unrostricted use of words. The root of the whole matter I have not attained. Therefore, oh king of Pāṇḍharīmy mind is afflicted. Who knows what is in my heart? I am respected or worshipped, and this has given rise to conceit; and my further progress (towards perfection) has been arrested; says Tukā, I do not know the true way and find myself in the hands of egotism.&quot; Again:—</p>
<p>First coll, No. 1133. &quot; What shall I do with fame and worldly</p>
<p>honour and greatness? Do show me thy feet. Do not bring about this (result), that thy servant should go for nothing. If I become. great and bear the burden of ostentatious knowledge, I shall go away from thy feet farther and farther. What possibility is there. of people knowing the internal condition? A man is judged by his external appearances. Even adversity will be sweet to me, if it leads me to thy feet.&quot;</p>
<p>He thus goes on cultivating the virtue of humility, until at last he comes to speak of the death of the self in him as in the following:—</p>
<p>First coll., No. 3474. &quot; I have surrendered my soul to thee and then I have abandoned my individuality (dwelling). Now thy might alone prevails here. I being dead, thou hast established thy station here. Now nothing like me and mine remains here.&quot;</p>
<p>Here he speaks of his ha ing abandoned the self and God&rsquo;s having come to dwell in his heart instead of the self. And more distinctly :—</p>
<p>First Coll., No. 2668. &quot; I have seen my own death with my eyes. The result is incomparable rapture. The three worlds are filled with joy. And I have enjoyed as the soul of all. By my sense of individuality I was confined to one place and by its abandonment I have become all-reaching. The pollution arising from birth and death is at an end and I am free from the littleness resulting from the feeling of me and mine. Nārāyaṇa has now given me a place to dwell in: putting my faith in him I have remained at his feet: Tukā says, the fulfilment of what I undertook I have manifested to the world.&quot;</p>
<p>Here he speaks of the dying of the lower man in himself and the coming to life of the higher man.</p>
<p>There is a large number of pieces conveying instruction to men seeking spiritual advance. A few specimens will now be given:—</p>
<p>First coll. No. 3800. &quot; Therefore one should surrender oneself to God with all one&rsquo;s heart. He will carry one to the opposite bank of the river of life, which is difficult to be crossed. He</p>
<p>whose name is Ananta, or Endless, is very merciful; Tukā says, I have experienced this and therefore announce it to all.&quot;</p>
<p>Second Coll., No. 5383. &ldquo;Fortunate, indeed, are those persons, in whose heart dwells forgiveness and to whom, when there is occasion, courage and strength do not fail; who do not criticise other people by calling them good or bad and who think nothing of worldly greatness or superiority who internally and externally are alike pure like the Gaṅgāand whose heart is tender; Tukāsays, I will wave my body round them and place my head on their feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>First coll., No. 2397. &ldquo;For all beings entertain no hostile. feeling. This one alone is the excellent way. Thus alone will Nārāyaṇa accept thee. All talk without this is useless trouble. Relatives as well as the evil-disposed should be regarded as alike. and the mind devoted to the doing of good to others; Tukāsays, when the mind is pure everything becomes efficacious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>First coll., No. 1368. &ldquo;Do not give up food; do not betake yourself to a forest-dwelling; in all your sufferings and enjoyments think of Nārāyaṇa . A child sitting on the shoulders of its mother feels no trouble. Put an end to all thoughts different from this. Do not get entangled in worldly enjoyments nor abandon them; dedicate everything you do to God, and have done. with it; Tukā says, do not ask me again and again; nothing else. is to be taught but this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Tukārām dissuades men from giving up the world and becoming recluses, and advises them instead to dedicate their lives to the service of God and do everything in a manner to propitiate him.</p>
<p>The question has often been discussed among Marāṭhas whether Tukārām followed the Vedāntic theory of Śaṁkarācārya and regarded everything as an illusion except one soul. There are some Abhaṅgs which exhibit the closest possible approach to that theory such as the following :—</p>
<p>First coll., No. 300. &ldquo;What means crossing a mirage to reach the yonder bank? Children play with golden coins which are but pot-sherds. Is there any profit or loss by those transactions?</p>
<p>Little girls perform marriage (of dolls). Is the relation thus established real? The happiness or misery experienced in a dream is seen not to be true when a man awakes. The expressions, one is born, one is dead, are all false; and the saying that persons are in bondage or are delivered is a mere waste of breath, 50 says Tukā.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the illusive nature of everything is set forth quite in the style of Śaṁkarācārya&rsquo;s world-illusion. Again :—</p>
<p>First coll., No. 1992, &quot; A sugar crystal and sugar powder differ only in the name. There is no difference when sweetness is to be judged. Tell me, oh Pāṇḍuraṅg, how thou and I are distinct. Thou hast moved the world, and me and mine are the results Gold in the form of ornaments is worn on the foot, the hands, nose and the head. When all these are thrown into the crucible, where remains the distinction? Profit and loss are real in the dream when one goes to sleep, both vanish when one is awakened, so says Tukā.&quot;</p>
<p>Here there is a mixture of the two opposite theories, that of Pariṇāma, or development, as in the case of gold and ornaments. made of it, and that of Vivarta, or illusion, as in the case of things seen in a dream. The latter alone is hold by Śaṁkarācārya. Again :—</p>
<p>First coll., No. 2482. &quot; When salt is dissolved in water, what is it that remains distinct? I have thus become one in joy with thee and have lost myself in thee. When fire and camphor are brought together, is there any black remnant? Tukāsays, thou and I were one light.&quot;</p>
<p>Here the losing of self-consciousness in moments of ecstasy appears to be what is meant, and not quite a perfect identity of God and man. Nāmdev and Tukārām were not learned Paṇḍits like Rāmānuja and Mādhva and cannot be expected to formulate a consistent metaphysical theory of the relations between God, man, and the world. On the other hand, Tukārām
was such a devout and sincere lover of God that the idea of such a distinctness between the three as would render such a love possible, was constantly present in his mind, and there are a great many</p>
<p>Abhaṅgs in which he condemns the theory of spiritual monism as in the following:—</p>
<p>First coll, No. 1471. &ldquo;His words should not be listened to, who expounds useless (unsubstantial ) knowledge without Bhakti, or devotion. When monism is expounded without faith and love, the expounder as well as the hearer are troubled and afflicted. Hel who calls himself Brahma and goes on in his usual way, should not be spoken to and is a buffoon. The shameless one who speaks heresy in opposition to the Vedas is an object of soorn among holy men. Even an outeast is superior to him who cuts off the relation between God and his devotee (by asserting them to be identical); so says Tukā</p>
<p>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here is an uncompromising denunciation of spiritual monism. which leaves no scope for Bhakti, or devotion. It is considered as opposed to the Vedas and as a heresy. Again:—</p>
<p>First coll., No. 3753. &quot; For me there is no satisfaction in the doctrine of monism. Sweet to me is the service of thy feet. Confer this gift upon me making it fit (to be given by thee). Thy name and the singing of it are dear to me. The relation between. God and his devotee is a source of elevated joy. Make me feel this, keeping me distinct from thee. All this belongs to thee. Confer it upon me some day.&quot;</p>
<p>Here in his confutation of spiritual monism he takes his stand on the heartfelt charms of the love of God. He sets the innate feelings of his heart against the sophism of the advocates of the Advaits Vedānta.</p>
<p>First coll., No. 1589. &ldquo;I will make the mouth of the knowers of Brahma to water (in longing) and make the delivered ones to abandon the pristine condition (attained in consequence of deliverance). In singing, the whole bodily frame becomes instinct with Brahma and the good fortune ( resulting from it) consists in making God a debtor. I will bring indolence on him whose practice it is to repair to holy places, and make the enjoyment of a life in heaven bitter. I will make the man who practises. austerities give up his pride and put to shame sacrificial rites and charities. I will accomplish the great object of life, viz., love and wealth of devotion, which constitutes the true treasure</p>
<p>of Brahma and its substance; and I will make people say that it was by good fortune that they saw Tukāand became blessed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here his enthusiasm for the love and devotion for God becomes so great, that he instinctively, as it were, out of the strength of his feelings declares all other ways of reaching God, including the monistio Vedānta, as worthless and inefficacious.</p>
<p>Lastly I will here translate the Abhaṅg in which Tukārām sets forth the mission of his life :—</p>
<p>First coll., No. 520. &quot; We lived in the Vaikuṇṭha and have come for this very reason, viz., for bringing into practice truly what the Ṛṣis taught. The world is overgrown with weeds; we. will sweep clean the paths trodden by the righteous and accept what has remained. The old truths have disappeared. Mere: verbal knowledge has brought about destruction. The mind (of man) is eager for worldly enjoyments and the way to God has been. wholly obliterated. We will beat the drum of Bhakti which carries. terror to this sinful age; Tukāsays, proclaim victory with joy¹.&quot;</p>
<p>The above extracts from a voluminous collection will give some indication of the manner in which Tukārām endeavoured to execute his mission. He denounced the merely mechanical rites. and practices, enforced humility and the purification of the heart and a single-minded devotion to God.</p>
<p><strong>XXVI. Résumé of Vaiṣṇavism.</strong></p>
<p>§ 76. We have thus completed our survey of Vaiṣṇavism from about the fifth century before Christ to the middle of the seventeenth. It first appeared as a religious reform, like Buddhism and Jainism, but based on theistic principles. Its early name was Ekāntika Dharma, or the religion of a single-minded love. and devotion to One. In its back-ground stood the Bhagavadgītā, a discourse professing to be preached by Vāsudeva-Kṛṣṇa. It soon assumed a sectarian form and was called the Pāñcarātra or Bhāgavata religion. It was professed by a tribe of Kṣatriyas of the name of Sātvata and was noticed by Megasthenes, about the end of the fourth century before Christ, as the religion of such a specific people. This faith mingled itself with the existing one in Nārāyaṇa, the fountain from which all men have sprung, andwith that in Viṣṇu, whose traces were visible in this world, and. who at the same time had a mysterious nature. In the Bhagavadgītā itself were embodied some of the teachings of the Upaniṣads and a few general doctrines of two kinds of philosophy, the Saṁkhya and the Yoga, which, however, had not yet assumed the character of definite systems.</p>
<p>____________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.The readings of this piece have been compared with those handed down orally and corrected.</p>
<p>Soon after the beginning of the Christian era another element. was contributed to this system of religion by the Ābhīras, or cowherds, who belonged to a foreign tribe, in the shape of the marvellous deeds of the boy-Kṛṣṇa, who came to be regarded as a god, and of his amorous dalliances with cowherdesses. So constituted, Vaiṣṇavism went on till about the end of the eighth century, when the doctrine of spiritual monism and world-illusion was promulgated and dissominated by Śamkarācārya and his followers. This was considered as destructive of the Bhakti, or love, which Vaiṣṇavism enjoined.</p>
<p>And the feeling of hostility to spiritual monism gathered to a head in the eleventh century, when Rāmānuja made strenuous endeavours to put it down and spread the religion of Bhakti in a re-invigorated form. He was followed in the North by Nimbārka, who, however, gave prominence to the fourth or cowherdess element of Vaiṣṇavism and enjoined the worship of Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s mistress. Rādhāalso,Rāmānuja having passed them over in severe silence.</p>
<p>The attacks on spiritual monism and world-illusion were continued in a determined and definite manner in the thirteenth century by Mādhva or Ānandatīrtha, who established the doctrine. of pluralism, and brought into prominence the name of Viṣṇu as that of the supreme God. In the North, Rāmānanda gave a new turn to Vaiṣṇavism by bringing in the name of Rāma, while Rāmānuja, from whom his metaphysical doctrines are derived, laid particular stress on the name Nārāyaṇa. The preachings of Rāmānanda and his disciples were carried on in the Vernacular. Rāmānanda&rsquo;s religious activity is to be referred to the fourteenth century. He was followed by Kabīr in the fifteenth century, who preached strict monotheism, the name of his God being Rāma, and condemned idolatry.</p>
<p>Vallabha in the sixteenth century preached the worship of the boy-Kṛṣṇa and his mistress Rādhā. Caitanys about the same</p>
<p>time promulgated the worship of the grown-up Kṛṣṇa, for ever associated with Rādhā, who was idealised into an image of pure love. The increasing ardency in the love and devotion of God sought for realistic expression, and the conception of Rādhā deepened and acquired an exclusive prominence and importance. The devotion of Caitanya and his followers was sincere and fervent, and even bordered on the frantic; but that of Vallabha and his school was more dramatic than real. Ultimately this conception led to the degradation of Vaiṣṇavism.</p>
<p>In the MārāṭhāCountry, Nāmdev, whose date is uncertain, but who probably lived about the end of the fourteenth century, and Tukārām, in the first half of the seventeenth century, preached the worship of Viṭhobāof Paṇḍharpur as the supreme God, and, discarding Rādhā-Kṛṣṇaism, cultivated a more sober line of devotion. They also resorted to the Vernacular for the dissemination of their ideas. They, as well as Kabīr, and to a certain extent, Caitanya also, condemned the formalism, which prevailed. in the religion of their day, and preached pure love of God. The two Mārāṭhā saints and Kabīr also laid particular stress on the purification of the individual&rsquo;s heart and moral elevation as means to a single-minded and devoted love of God, and as necessary for the attainment of eternal bliss.</p>
<p>The points of contact between these various Vaiṣṇava systems are that their spiritual elements are essentially derived from the Bhagavadgītā, that Vāsudeva as the name of the Supreme Being stands in the background of all, and that spiritual monism and world-illusion are denounced by them equally. The differences arise from the varied importance that they attach to the different spiritual doctrines; the prominence that they give to one or other of the three elements that were mingled with Vāsudevism; the metaphysical theory that they set up; and the ceremonial which they impose upon their followers.</p>
<p>The Bhagavadgītāwas supplemented in later times by the Pāñcarātra Saṁhitās and the Purāṇas such as the Viṣṇu and the Bhāgavata, and other later works of that description. nocasionally elucidated some of the essential doctrines, laid down These the ceremonial, and brought together a vast mass of legendary matter to magnify the importance of their special teachings, and render them attractive.</p>
<p>Part II</p>
<p>ŚAIVISM AND MINOR RELIGIOUS SYSTEMS.<br>
<strong>I. Introductory.<br>
Formation of the Conception of Rudra-Śiva.</strong></p>
<p>§ 77. Some of the phenomena of external nature are pleasing, vivifying and benignant; others are terrible, dispiriting and destructive. In the dawn, the Āryas found the lovely goddess Uṣas, pursued by her lover Sūrya, or the Sun (ṚV. I.115, 2). In the rising sun, they found Mitra, a friendly god, who roused them from sleep and set them to do the work of the day (ṚV. III. 59. 1; VII. 36. 2). And in the sun, who visibly at rising stretched forth his rays as if they were his arms, filling the heaven and the earth, vivifying the world at the end of the night and placing it in the course assigned to it by him, they found Savitr(ṚV. IV. 53, 3). The dreadful and destructive phenomena are usually the storms. that uproot trees and even demolish houses, accompanied by the thunderbolt which strikes down men and beasts dead in a moment; and the epidemics that rage and carry off numbers of mon. In these the old Āryas saw Rudra, who went about howling. with the stormy winds (Maruts), who were his sons ( Rudriyas ).</p>
<p>But human beings do not believe in a purely malignant power reigning in the universe. The dreadful phenomena are attributed to the wrath of a god, which, however, can be appeased by prayer, praise and offerings. Then the god becomes Śiva, or the benignant. This appears to be the natural process by which a belief. in such a god as Rudra-Śiva became established in India in ancient times. We will now trace tho development of the idea of this god until he became the supreme creator, ruler, and pervader of the universe, a knowledge of whom contributed to eternal bliss.</p>
<p>II. The Development of the Idea of Rudra-Śiva.</p>
<p>§ 78. Rudra is represented as discharging brilliant shafts which run about the heaven and the earth (ṚV. VII. 46. 3) and</p>
<p>as possessing weapons which slay cows and men (ṚV. I. 114. 10). Here the destructive agency of lightning seems to have been clearly in view. He is prayed to by the singers to keep these away from them and to protect the two-footed and four-footed beings belonging to them (ṚV. I. 114. 1). When, in consequence of the prayers or in the natural course of things, the cattle go unharmed, Rudra is represented to be Paśupa, or protector of the cattle (ṚV. I. 114. 9).</p>
<p>Rudra is prayed to not to afflict children with disease (RV. VII. 46. 2) and to keep all in the village free from illness (ṚV. I. 114. 1). Rudra was thus believed to cause diseases, and when men recovered from them altogether free from them, that also was attributed to the agency of Rudra; and he is consequently spoken of as possessing healing remedies (ṚV. I. 43. 4) and as the best physician of physicians (ṚV. II. 33. 4) and as possessed of a thousand medicines (ṚV. VII. 46. 3). The singers also pray for the acquisition of those pure and salutary remedies belonging to the Maruts and Rudra, which father Manu desired (ṚV. II. 33. 13).</p>
<p>The general character of the prayers addressed to Rudra is well brought out in the following: &ldquo;Oh Rudra, do not, out of thy anger, injure our children and descendants, our people, our cattle, our houses, and do not kill our men. We invoke thee always with offerings&rdquo; (ṚV. I. 114. 8.). By his power he perceives all earthly beings and by his universal sovereignty he perceives divine beings (ṚV. VIL 46. 2). Here even in the Ṛgveda, Rudra is raised to supreme power.</p>
<p>§ 79. The character of Rudra appears in a much more developed form in the Śatarudriya (TS. IV. 5. 1; VS. chapter 16). Hist benignant form (Ś</p>
<p>ivātanuḥ) is distinguished from its opposite, the malignant. He is called Girīśa or Giritra, &ldquo;lying on a mountain&rdquo;, probably because the thunderbolt that he hurls, springs from a cloud, which is often compared to a mountain and in which he was believed to dwell. The cowherds and the female bearers of waters see him as he creeps along with his blue neck and red complexion, that is, these simple folk working in the open field see a</p>
<p>black aloud tinged red by the soft glow of the lightning. Representing, as Rudra does, the darker powers of nature, he may be expected to dwell away from the habitations of men, and therefore he is called the lord of the paths, of the forests, and of those whot roam in them, of thieves and highway rubbers, who frequent and move about in lonely places te prevent being detected, and also of outcasts who live away from the usual dwellings of men.</p>
<p>In his character as a healer, he appears here as the lord of medicinal herbs and is called a heavenly physician. Being the lord of the open fields or plains, he is the lord of cattle (Paśūnāṁpatiḥ) which roam in them. Then Paśupati became in later times a special appellation of this God. In this manner the range of Rudra became so wide that he came to be called the &ldquo;lord of the quarters&rdquo;. He is called Kapardin, or the wearer of matted hair, which epithet is probably due to his being regarded as identical with Agni, or fire, the fumes of which look like. matted hair. The names Śarva (arrow-wielder), and Bhava also, occur, and when his wrathful nature is thoroughly appeased, he. becomes Śaṁbhu or beneficent, and Śiva or auspicious, which names occur at the end of the Śatarudriya. He is also represented as wearing a hide (Kṛttiṁvasānaḥ). How the epithet arose it is difficult to say. But, being represented as roaming in forests and other lonely places, the idea of investing him with the skinclothing of the savage tribes may have suggested itself to a poet. The Niṣādas, a forest tribe, are compared to Rudras, which fact lends support to this view.</p>
<p>The name Rudra has been generalised and many Rudras are spoken of, and a wish is expressed that they may be far away from the singer. Here the signification of the common name. appears to be an evil spirit. In another place also the name is generalised, but the signification is much better. The Rudras are called Gaṇas or tribes, and Gaṇapatis or leaders of tribes, workmen, potters, cart-makers, carpenters, and Niṣādas or men of the forest-tribes. Thus these followers of handicraft and also the forest-tribe of Niṣādas are brought into close connection with Rudra; probably they were his worshippers or their own peculiar. gods were identified with the Āryan Rudra. This last supposition appears very probable, since the groups of beings, whose</p>
<p>Pati, or lord, he is represented to have been, dwelt in or frequented open fields, forests and waste lands, remote from the habitations of civilised men.</p>
<p>§ 80. In AV. the conception of Rudra is further developed, and he is elevated to a higher platform. Several other. names, by which he was known in later times, are also given, but the bearers of these are spoken of and addressed as separate gods. Bhava and Śarva are treated as two distinct deities and spoken of as ruling (Īśāthe) over two-footed and four-footed beings (IV. 28.1). They are styled the swiftest of all archers, and to them belongs. what is near as well as remote. They are called thousand-eyed. Their range is far and wide (3). Their stroke can not be avoided. by any man or god (5). They are invoked to launch their thunder- bolt against the Yātudhāna, or evil spirit (6). They are implored to deliver the singers from calamity (7). Śarva is called the archer, and Bhava the king (Rājan), and obeisance is made to them, and they are desired to remove their deadly poisons to other places (VI. 93, 2), Obeisance is made to Rudra who is in Agni, who is in the waters, who has entered into the herbs and who has formed all these beings (VII. 87. 1). This verse occurs in AU. (VI) and also inŚU. (IL 17), where, however, it appears in a somewhat altered form, the word Devs being used instead of Rudra.</p>
<p>In describing a particular ox Mahādeva is spoken of as his two arms (IX. 7. 7). Bhava and Sarva are invoked to launch the lightning against the doer of wickedness (X. I. 23). They are called Bhūtapati (the lord of spirits) and Paśupati (the lord of beasts). (XI. 2. 1). They are reverenced as being in their domains in the sky and in the middle regions (XI. 2. 4). Five distinct species of animals, kine, horses, men, goats, and sheep, are marked off as belonging to Paśupati (XI. 2.9). To Ugra, the fierce, belong the four intermediate quarters, the sky, the earth, and the wide atmosphere, and that which has spirit and breathes on the earth (XI. 2. 10). Bhava sees everything on earth. Nothing is far or near to him. He destroys things in the farther ocean, being himself in the preceding ocean (XI. 2. 25). Rudra is implored not to bring on consumption, poison, and celestial fire (XI. 2. 26). Bhava is the lord (Īśa) of the heavens, the</p>
<p>earth, and fills the whole atmosphere (XI. 2. 27). Bhava is addressed as king (Rājan), (XI. 2. 28). A wish is expressed that the arrows of Bhava, Śarva, and Rudra, who is Paśupati ( the lord of beasts) may be always propitious (Sadāśiva ), (XL. 6. 9). Savitṛ is called Āryaman, Varuṇa, Rudra, and Mahādeva (XIII. 4. 4). All the stars and the moon are under Rudra&rsquo;s control (XIII. 4. 28). The gods made Bhava the archer, the protector of the Vrātyas, or outcasts, in the intermediate space of the eastern region, Śarva of the southern region, Paśupati of the western region. Ugra of the northern region, Rudra of the lower region, Mahādeva of the upper region, and Īśānaof all the intermediate regions (XV. 5.1-7).</p>
<p>§ 81. In SB. (VL 1.3.7) and KB. (6.1.9), Rudra is mentioned as the son of Uṣas; and, after he was born, Prajāpati gave him, as he grew up, eight names, seven of which are the same as those. given above from the AV. and the eighth is Aśani, or the thunderbolt. It would be seen that the AV. regards the seven as different though allied gods, though once Rudra is identified with Paśupati. As in the case of the sun-god, the several ways of looking at him gave rise to the conception of several sun-deities. such as Savitṛ, Sūrya, Mitra, Pūṣan, etc., so the same terrible and destructive agency in nature, with its benignant and gracious counterpart, looked at from different points of view, gave rise to the belief in the seven different gods mentioned in the AV. They are all regarded as the names of one god in the ŚB. and KB., and an eighth name is introduced. Of these eight names, four-Rudra, Śarva, Ugra and Aśani, are indicative of the destructive energy, and the other four, viz., Bhava, Paśupati, Mahādeva or Mahān devaḥ, and Īśāna of its beginant counterpart.</p>
<p>It will have been observed that the AV. brings in A Dew element, that of poisons, which the terrific god was believed to send forth and of his shafts being unfailing or the and unavoidable by gods and men. On the other, benignant side, Bhava is represented to be a shining king (Rājan). Rudra is the lord of all creatures. His range is far and wide. He controls the stars and the moon. He reigns in the sky and the middle regions. He is in fire and water, in plants and herbs, and in all beings; and he is the protector of Vrātyas in all quarters; and he is pre-eminently the ruler (Īśāna).</p>
<p>Thus the terrible and the destructive God became, when he was propitiated by men in a variety of ways, a benignant God and attained to the whole majesty of the godhead by the time of the YV. and AV., and it is on this majestic form of the god that the theosophic speculations of ŚU., which we will notice further on, are based.</p>
<p>§ 82. But the darker side of the nat are of this god was never forgotten. A sacrifice called Śūlagava is mentioned in most of the Gṛhyasūtras. A bull is sacrificed to Rudra to appease him. (AG. IV. 9). The rite should be performed beyond the limits. of a village, and its remains should not be brought into it, which rule sufficiently indicates the inauspicious character of the rite. The Vapā, or omentum, should be sacrificed to Rudra by uttering. twelve names, seven of which are the same as the first three in the first group given above, and the four in the second group. Aśani is omitted, and we have the following five additional names, Hara, Mṛḍa, Śiva, Bhīma, and Śaṁkara. Or the Vapāmay be thrown into the fire by uttering six specific names only or the single name Rudra. This Śūlagava sacrifice should be performed in a cow-shed when a cattle disease has to be averted. In PG. (III, 8) the names uttered in throwing the oblations are the wives, Indrāṇī, Rudrāṇī, Śarvāṇī, and Bhavānī. HG. (II. 3. 8) has the same deities as the eight above-mentioned, Bhīma being substituted for Aśani; and oblations are given to the wife of each by repeating the formula &quot; Bhavasya devasya patnyai svāhā&quot; (to the wife of God Bhava) etc.,and not by uttering their proper names.</p>
<p>Directions are given in PG. (III. 15) to render obeisance to Rudra and pray for safe conduct when traversing a path, coming to a place where four roads meat, crossing a river, getting into a ferry-boat, entering a forest, ascending a mountain, passing by a cemetery or by a cow-shed and such other places. Similarly HG.( I. 5. 16) directs that a traveller should adore Rudra by repeating the specific formula given by him, when he comes to the crossing. of four roads or to a heap of cattle-dung, when serpents creep, and when he is overtaken by tornado, or is entering a river, or comes to a variegated scene, sacrificial site or an old large tree.</p>
<p>It will thus be seen that, in the time of the Gṛhyasūtras, Rudra was still a terrible god, who had to be appeased. He was the god that held sway over regions away from home, over fields, wildernesses, cemeteries, mountains, old trees and rivers. Whenever a man came to anything which inspired awe and terror, Rudra was the god thought of and prayed to protect. Herein lies the reason which rendered him in later times the omnipresent supreme lord of the universe to the exclusion of all other Vedio gods except Viṣṇu. Many are the occasions in the life of man, which excite fear; there are epidemic and other diseases, poisons, serpents, storms, thunderbolts and wild and awful scenes, and consequently, the god who brings on these occasions, and protects when appeased, will be thought of oftener than other gods. The lovableness of the works of God, his greatness and majesty and his mysterious nature, are also matters which strike the mind of man; and these appear to have operated in bringing Viṣṇu into prominence.</p>
<p>What contributed to the formation of Vaiṣṇavism were the appearances and occurrences which excited love, admiration and a spirit of worship; while in Rudra-Śaivism the sentiment of fear is at the bottom, howsoever concealed it may have become in certain developments of it, and this sentiment it is that has worked itself out in the formation of various Rudra-Śaiva systems of later times. In the monotheistic religions of other countries. the same god is feared and loved; in India the god that is loved. in Viṣṇu-Nārāyaṇa-Vāsudeva-Kṛṣṇa, while the god that is feared. is Rudra-Śiva.</p>
<p>III. Śvetāśvatara and Atharvaśiras Upaniṣads.</p>
<p>§ 83. Before we proceed to the consideration of the Rudra-Śiva sects, we must devote some time to the consideration of a religio-philosophic treatise which represents the farthest point in the development of the idea of Rudra-Śiva god worshipped by the Indian Āryas generally. This is the Śvetāśvatara-Upaniṣad. It does not appear to be composed in a sectarian spirit. The elevated notions about the nature of God and his relations to man and the world, which had been reached in the time of the early Upaniṣads, have been disentangled from</p>
<p>their connection with the impersonal Brahman and transferred to the God who had at the time when the Upaniṣads were written, acquired a living and active personality in the minds of the people. This god was Rudra-Śiva, who, as we have seen, had by the time of AV. attained to the dignity of the supreme god.</p>
<p>After the preliminaries, the doctrinal points that occur in the first chapter are these: that there are three unborn. elements in the world of these the all-knowing and the ignorant, the ruler and the ruled, are two, and there is a third which has in itself materials of enjoyment and suffering (9). Brahman is of three kinds, viz., the sufferer or enjoyer, what is enjoyed or suffered, and the dispenser or mover. There is nothing further to be known (12). Pradhāna is changeable, the immortal is unchangeable; Hara, the one lord, rules over the changeable and the soul. By meditating on him, by devoting oneself to him, by realising him, the whole ignorance is dispelled (10). By making one&rsquo;s body the lower block of wood, the syllable &ldquo;Om&rdquo; the upper, and by the act of meditation, which is (like) the rubbing of the two blocks against each other, one should perceive the hidden god (14). One finds that soul in oneself who seeks him by means of truth and exertion, as oil in seeds, butter in curds, or water in a spring (15).</p>
<p>The three elements mentioned in 9 and 12 are adopted by Rāmānuja in his system, and these texts are quoted by writers of that school. What is set forth in the tenth is similar to that which occurs in the sixteenth and seventeeth verses of chap. 15 of the BhG.</p>
<p>In the second chapter there is first of all a short mention of the Yoga processes, which lead to the perception of the supreme soul and the purity of the self. When by the purified nature of the individual self, as by a lamp, is known the nature of Brahman, or the god who is unborn, unchangeable, pure in every way, one is free from all bondage (15). The chapter closes with the verse which we have noticed as occurring in the AV.</p>
<p>In the third chapter, we have in the beginning a stanza which sets forth that those become immortal who know him who possessing a net, rules by his ruling powers, rules over all the worlds by</p>
<p>his ruling powers, who alone is the cause of production and growth (1). There is only one Rudra—and they do not recognise another— who rules these worlds by his ruling powers, who is the inmost soul of all men, who contracts everything on the final day, and, creating all beings, protects them (2). He has his eyes everywhere, his face everywhere, as in RV. X. 81. 3 (3). May Rudra, the cause of the production and growth of the gods, the lord of the universe, the great prophet, and who formerly created Hiraṇyagarbha, endow us with a holy will (4). Then follow two verses from the Śatarudriya, praying Rudra to look at the singer with his gracious countenance and not to do harm to men, etc. (5, 6). Knowing the lord (Īśa), who is the highest Brahman and the greatest of all, who dwells in the inside of all beings whatever their form, and who encompasses the whole universe, men become immortal (7). Then follow similar verses expressive of the attributes of the supreme God and prescribing a knowledge of him as the door to immortality.</p>
<p>As formerly remarked<sup id="fnref:71"><a href="#fn:71" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">71</a></sup>,a verse and a half in this chapter occurs word for word in the thirteenth chap, of the BhG. It also deserves remark that the proper names of the supreme being that occur are Īśāna, Īśa, and Śiva, and the epithet Bhāgavat, that is used also, deserves notice (11, 12, 15, 17, 20). In verso 20, which occurs also in the MU., there is Īśam for Ātmanaḥwhich is indicative of the peculiarity of this Upaniṣadwhich we have noticed. There are two verses from the Puruṣasūkta (RV. X. 90),</p>
<p>The fourth chapter opens with the expression of the desire that he who, himself being without form, creates many forms with a certain purpose, in whom in the end as well as in the beginning the universe exists, may endow the adorers with a holy will. Then follows the identification of this supreme soul with fire, sun, wind, moon and a variety of other objects (2-4). We have then the metaphor of one male goat lying down with the female goat and another male goat abandoning her after enjoyment, which represents the soul in the worldly and the delivered conditions (5).</p>
<p>We have next the verse about two birds, the friends and companions of each other, resting on the same tree, one eating the fruit of that tree, and the other simply looking on without eating, which occurs in the RV. (I. 164. 20) and in the MU. (III. 1. 1). The next verse about the weak soul being deluded and in grief and being delivered from his sorrows when he sees the other. soul, who is the ruler (Īśa), occurs in the MU. also (III. 1. 2) but not in the RV.</p>
<p>After two verses there is another, in which Māyā is called Prakṛti and he who uses this Māyā is called Maheśvara (10). Maheśvara is a name of Śiva. Having known the boon-giver, Īśāna, who presides over every productive organ and in whom and from whom are all things, one attains eternal peace or serenity (11) Then there is a repetition here of a verse in the previous chapter (III4), with an unimportant difference of reading (12). Then occurs the second part of the verse in IV., which represents Hiraṇyagarbha to be the lord of two-footed and four-footed animals (X. 121.3), the first part of the latter being paraphrased here (13). This verse was probably suggested by the occurrence of the name of Hiraṇyagarbha in the previous verse.</p>
<p>Having known Śiva (the auspicious), who is minuter than the minute, the creator of the universe, of many forms, and who alone encompasses the universe in this medley of the world, one attains eternal peace (14). That same lord of the universe concealed in all objects is the protector of the world in time. Devoting themselves to him and knowing him thus, the Brahmarṣis and the deities out away nooses of death (15). Knowing Śiva, concealed in all beings, who is as subtle as the essence of milk, other than the butter, knowing the god who alone encompasses the universe, one is free from all nooses (16). This god—this great soul—whose work is the universe always dwells in the hearts of men. He is determined by the heart, the intelligence, and internal consciousness; those who know this become immortal (17).</p>
<p>When there was simple darkness and no. day or light, no entity or non-entity, Śiva alone existed. He was the one unchangeable thing, and he was the bright light of the sun,</p>
<p>and from him sprang all intelligence (18). Here appears anides similar to that expressed in RV. X. 129. No one can seize. him above, transversely or in the middle. There is not another like him. Great is his glory (19). His form is invisible. Nobody sees him with the eye. Those who see him, dwelling in the heart, by the heart and the internal consciousness, become immortal (20). This verse is the same as in KU. (VI.9), excepting in the third. line, which there is the same as the third line of v. 17 above. The chapter ends with two verses containing a prayer to Rudra to proteot, the latter of which is the same as RV. I. 114. 8.</p>
<p>In the first verse of the fifth chapter are mentioned two indestructible beings, Brahman and the other, who are endless, in whom there lie, unobserved, knowledge and ignorance. Ignorance is destructible, knowledge is indestructible; and there is another who rules over knowledge and ignorance (1). In the next verse is mentioned the birth of Kapila and his being fed with knowledge. by him who presides over every productive energy (2). Giving various forms to each group (lit. net), the god resolves everything into the original principle. Creating again the lords of beings, he, the great soul, the ruler, wields sovereignty over all (3). As the sun illuminates all quarters, upper and lower and transversal, so also the god, the Bhagavat, presides over the natures of all productive energies (4). The original cause of the world makes natural powers develop, and brings to a mature condition those who are capable of development. He presides over this universe and puts into operation all the qualities (5). That is concealed in Upanisads, which contain the secret of the Vedas. That origin of Brahman, Brahmadeva knows All the ancient gods and Ṛṣis, who knew that, being absorbed in it, became immortal (6).</p>
<p>The Upaniṣad then proceeds to mention the individual soul, the lord of the vital airs, who performs actions and enjoys or suffers. their fruit, possesses three qualities and follows three ways, and gues through a succession of births in consequence of his actions (7). He is as big as the thumb, bright like the sun, is conscious of himself, and wills, is as minute as the hundredth part of the hundredth part of the point of a bair, and is ondless. In himself he is not a female nor a male nor sexless. This depends on the body assumed by him (8, 9, 10). He assumes many gross and</p>
<p>subtle forms in accordance with his qualities and the qualities of his actions and of the self. But he who effects their union, is another (12). Then follows a verse similar to IV. 14 and the latter part of 16 (13). In the last verse Śiva, the God, the creator and destroyer, is said to bo knowable by Bhāva faith, love, or the pure heart (14).</p>
<p>The sixth chapter appears to be a sort of resumé of what precedes. Among other things it is stated that he who promotes virtue and dispels sin, should be known as existing in oneself (6); that the one God is concealed in all beings, is all-pervading, the internal soul of all beings, presiding over all actions, the support of all beings, the witness of all, the life-giver, absolute and without qualities (11); and that, knowing the cause which is to be understood by means of the Saṁkhya and the Yoga, a man is freefrom all nooses (13).</p>
<p>After this follows a verse to the effect: &quot; nor the sun nor the moon nor the stars nor lightning illuminate him (i. e., make him known); when he shines, everything shines after him, and by his light all this is rendered visible, or is illuminated &ldquo;(14). This verse occurs in KU. (V. 15) and in MU. (II. 2. 10). The work ends with an expression of the author&rsquo;s self-surrender to the god, who shines forth in one&rsquo;s own intelligence, who first created Brahmadeva, and who sent forth the Vedas—the god who has no parts, who does not suffer change, who is all peace, has no defects and is unpolluted, the bridge for crossing over to immortality, and who is like fire that has burnt fuel (18. 19).</p>
<p>§ 84. From this short summary, it will be seen that this Upaniṣad contains verses from the Saṁhitās of the RV. and YV. and others, which must have been in a floating condition, and were appropriated by the Muṇḍaka and Kaṭha Upaniṣads as well as by this; and a great many others, which have not been traced elsewhere, are original. All these contain truths about the nature of God, the individual soul and the inanimate world and the relations between them. The way to redemption is meditation. on the Supreme Soul, which way is characteristic of the Upaniṣad. doctrine in general. Certain Yoga processes are prescribed to reuder this meditation effective, and the final result is a perception of the Supreme Soul as existing everywhere, and this perception constitutes eternal bliss.</p>
<p>This treatise contains the theism of the Upaniṣad</p>
<p>period in its most mature form with a God distinctly personal at the centre. The attributes of the Supreme Soul are often given in very general terms, and he is referred to by the non-sectarian general name Deva, but as ofton that Deva is identified with Rudra, Śiva, Īśāna and Maheśvara, and his powers are spoken of as Īśānīs; but there is no indication whatever that these names have been given. for the purpose of raising Rudra-Śiva to the supreme godhead to the exclusion of another god. Names indicative of Rudra-Śiva appear to have been used, since he was invested with a personality perceived and acknowledged by all. This Upaniṣad, therefore, is not a sectarian treatise like others promulgated in later times, and is often quoted by Śaṁkarācārya, Rāmānuja and other writers of the different schools, and not by those of one schoolonly.</p>
<p>It must have been composed before the BhG., since the latter contains, as already stated<sup id="fnref:72"><a href="#fn:72" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">72</a></sup>, a verse and a half from it, and the nature of the religio-philosophic speculations contained in it, though essentially Upaniṣadic, make a nearer approach to the later Bhakti School than those of any of the older treatises of the class. The description of the godhead and of the final pure serenity are instinct with the glow of love and admiration, and the treatise ends with an expression of self-surrender to the god, who makes himself manifest in one&rsquo;s own intelligence. The Śvetāśvatara-Upaniṣad, therefore, stands at the door of the Bhakti School, and pours its loving adoration on Rudra-Śivainstead of on Vāsudeva-Krṣṇa, as the BhG. did in later times when full swing. Vāsudeva-Kṛṣṇa the Bhakti doctrine was in full swing. had a historic basis; and the circumstances which led to his being invested with the supreme godhesd, occurred in later times, while in the age, in which the Śvetiśvatare-Upaniṣad was composed, Rudra-Śiva was alone in the field as the supreme god, and the germs of Bhakti, or love, which manifested themselves at the time,were directed towards him; but when Vāsudeva-Kṛṣṇa also came into the field, he appealed more to the hearts of men as the</p>
<p>god who had come to dwell amongst them; consequently the germs of Bhakti speedily developed, and he became the object of the heightened feelings in preference to the other.</p>
<p>Umā-Haimavatī.</p>
<p>§ 85. Up to the time at which we have arrived, we meet with no mention of the wife of Rudra or Śiva, but in the Kena-Upaniṣad, which is certainly one of the earlier Upanişads, the name of Umāoccurs. She is called Haimavatī, or the daughter of Himavat, but she is not mentioned in the KnU, as the wife of Rudra or Śiva, though in later times she was known to be so. The story is Brahman conquered the enemies of the gods for them, but the gods took credit to themselves for the victory and were proud of their achievements. Agni, Vāyu and Indra were sitting together, engaged in joyous conversation, when there appeared at some distance a spirit. Agni first went out to see what it was. The spirit asked him the nature and extent of his power and laid down a blade of grass, which it asked him to burn away. Agni was not able to do this and returned bafilled. Then went Vāyu, who also was not able to blow away the blade of grass; afterwards. went Indra, and at his approach the spirit disappeared. Indra was disappointed, but he saw a beautiful woman of the name of Umā-Haimavatī and asked her who the spirit was. She said it was Brahman. The story represents that condition of things, in which the old Vedio gods had lost their power or hold over men, and Brahman had come into prominence as the supreme spirit. Since it was Umā that disclosed the nature of the spirit. It may be understood that the Brahman mentioned was Rudra-Śiva and Umā was his wife. It would thus appear that she had come to be so regarded some time before the Upanṣiad was composed.</p>
<p>§86. The Atharvaśiras is another Upaniṣad appertaining to Rudra. It is a much later work as is shown even by the very variant texts before me, commented on by Nārāyaṇa and Śaṁkarānanda. The gods, it is said, went to heaven and asked Rudra who he was. He said that he alone was, is, or will be, and nothing else. He is in all the quarters, he is Gāyatrī, man, woman, etc., and thus a number of things are mentioned with which he is identical. Then Rudra was invisible to them, and they raised. their arms and praised him saying: &ldquo;He who is Rudra, is</p>
<p>Bhagavat, and who also is Brahimadeva, a how to him&rdquo;. In the similar sentences that follow, instead of Brahmadeva we have. Viṣṇu, Maheśvara, Umā, Skanda, Vināyaka, etc. The sun and the constellation are also included. Then Oṁkāra is mentioned. to which many epithets and opithets of epithets expressive of divine attributes are given, and lastly it is called the one Rudra who is Īśāna, Bhagavat, Maheśvara and Mahādeva, Then follow the etymologies of the epithets or names. The only Rudra he is called, because he alone creates and absorbs everything. He is called Īśāna, because he rules by the powers called the Īśānīs. Then follow four or five verses from SU. with different readings. In some cases.</p>
<p>The substance of what follows is thus given by Śaṁkarānanda. For the knowledge of Rudra one should use moderate food, devote himself to reading (Śravaṇa), thinking (Manana), etc., become a Paramahaṁsa, or a single-minded devotee, and spend his time thus. One should undertake the Pāśupata vow (Vrata), which is of the following nature. Greed and anger should be given up. Forgiveness should be realised. The muttering of Om should be practised, and meditation resulting in Avagati, or perception, should be resorted to. The text, of which this is the explanation, may be generally rendered thus:— &quot; In the inside of the heart exists the subtle body, in which there. are anger, greed and forgiveness. Destroying greed, which is at the bottom of human motives, and concentrating the mind on Rudra, who is one and eternal, one should be moderate in cating and drinking &ldquo;. Then follows a precept to besmear the body. with ashes by repeating the words: &quot; The ash is fire, the ash is water, the ash is earth, everything is ash, the ether is ash, the mind, the eyes and other senses are ash.&rdquo; This is the Pāśupata vow (Vrata), enjoined for the removal of the noose with which the Paśu, or the individual soul, is tied.</p>
<p>Here the besmearing of the body with ashes after repeating a formula, or Mantra, is prescribed as a vow for the devotees of Paśupati, or Rudra-Śiva, calculated to effect a deliverance from the trammels of life. The expression &quot; Paśupāśavimokṣaṇa which means the loosening of the noose tied round the necks of beings, is a characteristic of the Pāśupata sect. This Upaniṣad</p>
<p>therefore belongs to that sect. Before, however, we pass on to the consideration of this sect, we must cast a glance at the position which Rudra-Śiva holds in the Mahābhārata.</p>
<p><strong>IV. Rudra-Śiva in the Mahābhārata and Liṅga Worship.</strong></p>
<p>§ 87. At the beginning of the Bhīṣmaparvan Kṛṣṇa advises Arjuna to make an obeisance to Durgābefore the commencement of the battle and pray for success. Arjuna does so after repeating a hymn in honour of Durgā, containing the names of Umā, mother of Skanda, Kātyāyanī, Karālīand a number of others. In the Vanaparvan Arjuna is represented to have gone to the Himālaya and practised austerities there. Some time after, Śiva appears dressed like a Kirāta, and a severe fight ensues between them. Arjuna is overpowered in the end and lies on the ground exhausted. He then praises Śiva, and, having made an altar of earth, puts flowers on it in the name of Śaṁkara. These, however, appear as placed on the head of the Kirāta, whereupon Arjuna makes him out as Śiva the object of his adoration, and surrenders himself to him. Śiva becomes pleased and offers him whatever he wishes. Arjuna asks for the weapon presided over by Paśupati (Pāśupatāstra), which possesses the power of destroying all formidable enemies (chaps. 38-40).</p>
<p>In the Droṇaparvan again, (chaps. 80-81) the attainment. of the Pāśupatāstra, which appears to be of another kind, consisting of a bow and arrow, by Arjuna, is mentioned. Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa are spoken of as having gone to the Himālaya in a vision and seen Śaṁkara at his dwelling. They bow their heads before him, sing a hymn in his praise, in which they call him the unborn, the creator of the universe, the unchangeable and utter the names which we have given as occurring in earlier works, and thus propitiating him ask for the Pāśupata weapon. They are directed to a lake where the Astra bad been thrown. There they saw two venomous serpents, which, however, assumed at the time the forms of a bow and an arrow, and these Arjuna took away.</p>
<p>In the Sauptikaparvan (chap. 7) Aśvatthāman is mentioned to have propitiated Śaṁkaraand obtained a sword from him. Śiva himself enters into his body, and Aśvatthāman</p>
<p>carries havoc and destruction with the terrible sword in the camp of the Pāṇḍus, killing all their progeny, and even Dhṛṣṭadyumna, who had cut off the head of his father Droṇa. Yudhiṣṭhira asksKṛṣṇa says that he did. Kṛṣṇa how he was able to effect all this. it through the power of Śaṁkara and relatos another story about him. Brahmadeva once told Śaṁkara not to create. WhereuponŚaṁkara concealed himself under water for a long time. When, therefore, there was no creation for such a long period, Brahmadeva created another Prajāpati, who brought into existence a large number of beings. These beings, being afflicted with hunger, went to Prajāpati to devour him. He, being afraid, went to Hiraṇyagarbha, who created two kinds of food for those beings and then they were quicted. After some time Mahādeva rose out of the water, and seeing that new beings had been created and were in a flourishing condition, he cut off his organ of generation as no more necessary, and it stuck into the ground. He then went away to perform austerities at the foot of the Muñjavat mountain.</p>
<p>There is a similar story about Mahādeva&rsquo;s having ceased to create and become a Yogin in the Vāyu Purāṇa (chap.10). Brahmadeva told Nīlalohita (Mahādeva) to create, and bringing to mind his wife Satī, he created thousands of beings exactly like. himself, who were immortal. Thereupon he stopped and rendered himself incapable of procreation. He then resorted to all those processes of the Yoga, which in the Purāṇa is called the PāśupataYoga.</p>
<p>In the Sauptikaparvan, Kṛṣṇa continues the story of Mahādeva and tells Yudhiṣṭhira that when the gods created the rite of sacrifice and assigned no oblation to Rudra, he was full of wrath and destroyed the sacrifice; whereupon they assigned him a portion and the god was pleased.</p>
<p>In the Anuśāsanaparvan (chap. 14),Kṛṣṇa is introduced as recounting the glories of Mahādeva. He says, Jāmbavatī, one of his wives, expressed a desire for as good a son as Rukmiṇī, his chief consort, had. To procure such a son he had recourse to Mahādeva, through whose favour only his wishes could be fulfilled. He then went to the Himālaya, on which Śiva lived. On the way he saw the hermitage of Upamanyu. Upamanyu</p>
<p>enters into a long discourse on the beneficent deeds of Mahādeva. A list is given of persons, including many Daityas, who obtained their desired objects, such as sons, weapons, powers, etc., through the favour of Mahādeva, whom they had propitiated by rigid austere practices and other ways. One of these was Śākalya, to whom was granted the boon that he would be an author and would obtain immortal glory, and his son would be the composer of Sūtras. The persons alluded to here must be the compiler of the RVS.. and the author of the Pāda text. Upamanyu began to practise austerities to propitiate Śiva at the instance of his mother, who, in describing the god&rsquo;s power and beneficence, spoke of him as dancing nakedly and of his having the quarters for his clothing (Digvāsas). In the course of his austerities, Mahādeva, to test Upamanyu&rsquo;s devotion, appears before him in the form of Indra, and offers him many magnificent boons, which Upamanyu refuses, and declares that he would have boons from Śaṁkara alone, and that he would become a worm or a butterfly at the command of Śaṁkara, but did not desire. even the sovereignty of the three worlds given by Indra. In the course of his narrative, Upamanyu says that Mahādeva was the only god, whose organ of generation (Liṅga) is worshipped by men. Heand Umã were the real creators of animals, as these bear the marks of the two, and not the discus or the conch-shell or marks of any other god. Eventually Śiva and Umãappeared before Upamanyu, seated on a strong towering ox, attended on the one side by Brahmadeva seated on the swan, his vehicle, and on the other, by Nārāyaṇa on Garuḍa with the conch-shell, lotus, etc., and conferred on him all the blessings he desired. At his instance Kṛṣṇa also entered on a long course of austerities, at the end of which Mahādeva with Umā appeared before him in the same manner as they did to Upamanyu. The god conferred eight boons upon him, and his consort eight more; besides she promised him sixteen thousand wives. and altogether the number of boons he obtained was twenty-four inclusive of the birth of such a son as he wanted.</p>
<p>§ 88. The characteristics of Śiva, or Mahādeva, as brought. out by these accounts appear to be these. He was a powerful, wrathful and impetuous god, but generous and bountiful, and</p>
<p>spared nothing when he was propitiated. Whenever a man conceived a desire for anything, he was the god to be appealed to for its fulfilment. He lived on the Himālaya with his wife Umā, Pārvatī, or Durgā, who had a number of other names such as Kalī, Karālī, etc., and was attended by a number of beings called. his Gaṇas or hosts. His vehicle was an I. He had, of course, all the attributes of the supreme godhead. He is represented as having betaken himself to the process of Yoga or contemplation, when he had ceased to be creative.</p>
<p>It will be seen that the object of worship in Śaivism is the Liṅga, or phallus. We have found no trace of this characteristic in the earlier literature, so far as we have examined it¹, and the first time we meet with it is in this passage from the Anuśāsanaparvan. We have had occasion in a previous section<sup id="fnref:73"><a href="#fn:73" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">73</a></sup> to remark that Rudra-Śiva had a close connection with stragglers in the forest, with Vrātyas, or those who were not included in the Aryan community, and with the wild tribe of the Niṣādas, and also that the gods of these last were amalgamated with Rudra. Rudra&rsquo;s partiality for serpents and his being the lord of spirits or Bhūtas, were probably due to the influence of the serpent-worship and the devilry of the savage tribes.</p>
<p>There are two places in the RV., in one of which Indra is prayed to not to allow those whose god is Śiśna, to disturb the rites of the singers (VII. 24. 5); and in another he is represented. to have conquered the riches of a city after killing those whose god is Śiśna. Here evidently those whose god was Siśna, or phallus, are meant as the enemies of the Vedic Aryas, who disturbed their holy rites. Notwithstanding all that is said about the matter, my own belief is that the persons here referred to were really some tribe of the aborigines of the country, who worshipped. the phallus. Just then, as the Rudra-Śiva cult borrowed several elements from the dwellers in forests and stragglers in places outof the way, so it may have borrowed this element of phallicworship from the barbarian tribes with whom the Āryas came in contact. This element, however, does not appear to have come. in all at once, especially among the learned classes, whose beliefs. are represented in the literature which we have examined.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.I do not, however, deny the possibility that when the ŚU. in IV. 11 speaks. of the god Īśāna as presiding over every Yoni, und in V. 2, of the lord as presiding over all forms and Yonis, an allusion to the physical fact of the Liṅga and Yoni connected together, may have been meant as typifying the philosophical doctrine of gods presiding over every creative cause.</p>
<p>The Liṅga worship had, it appears, not come into use at the time. of Patañjali; for, the instance he gives under P.V. 3.99, is that of an image or likeness (Pratikṛti) of Śiva as an object of worship, and 2001 not of any emblem of that god. It seems to have been unknown. oven in the time of Wema-Kadphises, for, on the reverse of his coins, there is a human figure of Śiva with a trident in the hand; and there is also an emblem, but it is Nandin or the bull, and not a Liṅga or phallus. But this element must have crept in early enough among ordinary people, who were in closer communication with the uncivilised tribes, and gradually made its way to the higher classes, of whose creed it subsequently became an article. And it is this final stage of its adoption by the higher classes that is represented in Upamanyu&rsquo;s discourse in the Mahābhārata.</p>
<p>From all that we have brought forward from the post-Saṁhitāliterature, it will appear that Rudra-Śiva was a deity whose. worship was common to all Āryas, and who was not at first a sectarian god. As above remarked<sup id="fnref:74"><a href="#fn:74" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">74</a></sup>,he was in charge of the field before the Vaiṣṇava or Vāsudevic deities came in to contest his supremacy. The Gṛhyasūtras, which, as we have seen, give directions as to the adoration of Rudra under various circumstances, cannot be considered as belonging to any Śaiva sect. In the time of Patañjali, images of Śiva, Skanda and Viśākha. made sometimes of precious metals, were kept for common worship by certain religious persons who derived an income from them<sup id="fnref:75"><a href="#fn:75" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">75</a></sup>. The images of Śiva here alluded to cannot have been meant for the use of a particular sect.</p>
<p>V. Origin and Diffusion of the Śaiva Sects and the<br>
Several Classes of Śiva Worshippers.</p>
<p>§ 89, A Śaiva sect is, however, mentioned even by Patañjali. The members of it were known as Śivabhāgavatas, or devotees of Śiva, the Bhagavat, Śiva, we have seen, is called Bhagavat in AU.—A Śivabhāgavata carried in his hand an iron lance as an omblem of the deity he worshipped (under P. V. 2. 76).</p>
<p>In the Nārāyaṇīya section of MBh., the Pāśupata is mentioned.as one of five schools of religious doctrines (Śāntiparvan, chap. 349, v. 64). Śiva-Śrīkaṇṭha, the consort of Umā, the lord of spirits and the son of Brahmadeva, is represented to have revealed the tenets of that school (verse 67). Whether this statement is to be understood in the sense that its founder was a human being. afterwards recognized as an incarnation of Śiva, or whether it is a mere general statement like that contained in the BU. (II. 4. 10) that the Ṛgveda, Yajurveda, etc., are the breath of this great. being, meaning nothing more historically than that the system. gradually came into existence, without any special individual being concerned with it, is a question somewhat difficult to answer definitely; but there is evidence in the Purāṇas and Inscriptions, of the existence of a belief in favour of the first supposition.</p>
<p>The Vāyu-Purāṇa(chap. 23) and the Liṅga-Purāṇa (chap. 24). represent Maheśvara to have told Brahmadeva that when, at the time of Kṛṣṇa-Dvaipāyana during the twenty-eighth repetition of the Yugas, Vāsudeva, the best of Yadus, would be born of Vāsudeva, he would incarnate himself as a Brahmacārin by the name of Lakulin after entering a dead body thrown into &amp; cemetery; the place where this would occur, would be called Kāyāvatāra or Kāyāvarohaṇa, and he would have four pupils of the names of Kuśika, Garga, Mitra and Kauruṣya. These Pāśupatas, with their bodies sprinkled with ashes, resorting to the Yoga of Maheśvara, would in the end go to the world of Rudra.</p>
<p>Now, in an Inscription in the temple of Nātha near that of Ekalingii,14 miles to the north of Udaipur, Rajputana, it is stated that Śiva became incarnate &amp;s a man with a club (Lakula) in his hand, in the country of Bhṛgukaccha, being propitiated by Bhṛgu. Sages, Kuśika and others, conversant with the Pāśupata Yoga, and using ashes and wearing bark-dress and matted hair, are mentioned.</p>
<p>There is another Inscription, usually called the CintraPraśasti, which states that Śiva became incarnate in the form of Bhaṭṭāraka Śrī-Lakulīśa, and dwelt at Kārohaṇa in the Lāṭa country. There appeared in bodily form four pupils of his of the names of Kuśika, Gärgya, Kauruṣa and Maitreya for the strict performance of the Pāśupata vows, and they became originators of four branches. The date of the first Inscription is Vikrama 1028, or 971 A. D., and the second was composed between A. D. 1274 and 1296. In another Inscription dated 943 A. D., found at Hemāvatīin the Sira Taluka, Mysore, Lakulīśa is represented to have been born again as Muninātha Chilluka to preserve the memory of his name and doctrines<sup id="fnref:76"><a href="#fn:76" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">76</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Mādhava calls the Pāśupata system that he explains in his Sarvadarśanasaṁgraha, Nakulīśa-Pāśupata, and quotes a few words from what appears to be a work attributed to him. From all this it appears that there lived a certain person, of the name of Lakulin (the holder of a Lakuṭa, or Laguḍa, or Lakula, i. e., a club) who founded a Pāśupata system. Four schools sprang out of it, and their reputed founders, whether historical or legendary, were considered his pupils. Lakulin ist the same as Nakulin, and the fact that his rise has been represented by the Purāṇas to be contemporaneous with Vāsudeva-Kṛṣṇa, points to the inference that traditionally the system was intended. to take the same place in the Rudra-Śiva cult that the Pāñcarātra did in the Vāsudeva-Kṛṣṇacult. We may, therefore, place the rise of the Pāśupata school mentioned in the Nārāyaṇīya about a century after that of the Pāñcarātra system, i. e., about the second century B. C.</p>
<p>§ 90. Before we proceed further, we will notice the extent of the diffusion of the creed. At the end of the commentary on the Vaiśeṣikasūtras, the author Prśsastapāda ntakes his obeisance to Kaṇāda, the author of the Sūtras, and characterises him as having composed the Vaiśeṣikasūtras after propitiating Maheśvara by the</p>
<p>greatness of his Yoga (meditation or concentration), and Ācāra (practice). These two ways are common to both the Pāśupata and Śaiva systems, as will be seen hereafter, and Kaṇāda, therefore, may have been a follower of the Pāśupata or Śaiva system. Bhāradvāja, the author of the Uddyota, or a gloss on Vātsyāyana&rsquo;s Nyāyabhaṣya, is called Pāśupatācārya, or a teacher belonging to the Pāśupata school, at the end of his work.</p>
<p>Wema Kadphises, a powerful prince of the Kuṣanarace, who ruled over a large part of Northwestern India about the middle of the third century A. D., styles himself on the reverse of his coins a devotee of Maheśvara or a member of the Maheśvara sect, and image of Nandin and another of Śivawith a trident in his hand occur on the obverse. Varāhamihira in the latter part of the sixth century, lays down the rule that the priests to be employed for the installation of an image of Śaṁbhu, should be Brāhmaṇas besmearing their bodies. with ashes. By these he means members of a Śaiva sect, since, in the case of other gods, the names mentioned are those of the sects founded in the names of those gods.</p>
<p>Haribhadra, an old Jaina author, speaks in his Ṣaḍdarśanasamuccaya, of the schools of Gotama and Kaṇāda as professing the Śaiva faith. But his commentator Guṇaratna, (who flourished. in the latter part of the fourteenth century<sup id="fnref:77"><a href="#fn:77" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">77</a></sup>), calls the Vaiśeṣikās Pāśupatas and the other school Śaivas. This last must be a mistake, since Bhāradvāja of the Nyāya school is specifically spoken of as a Pāśupatācārya, as we have seen.</p>
<p>The Chinese traveller Hiuen-Tsiang in the middle of the seventh century mentions the Pāśupatas twelve times in in his book. In some places he saysthat there were temples of Maheśvara at which the Pāśupatas worshipped; in one or two temples, he says that they resided. And at Benares he found about ten thousand sectaries who honoured Maheśvara, besmeared their bodies with ashes, went naked and tied their hair. in knots. These and those who lived in temples must have been like the Bairāgis, or ascetics, of modern times, who had given up the world; but probably the others mentioned by him were the</p>
<p>followers of the Pāśupata faith who lived the ordinary life of householders.</p>
<p>In the copper-plate charter of Nāgavardhana, nephew of Pulakeśin II of Mahārāṣṭra, who ascended the throne in 610 A. D., and was living in 639 A. D., a grant is recorded of a village near Igatpuri in the Nasik District for the worship of the god Kāpāleśvara i. e., the lord of the wearers of garlands of skulls, and for the maintenance of the Mahāvratins residing in the temple. It will hereafter be shown that the name Mahāvratin, or observer of the grent vow designated the Kāpālikas or Kālāmukhas. Thus there. is evidence of the existence in the middle of the seventh centuryof the sect of Kāpālikas in Mahārāṣṭra<sup id="fnref:78"><a href="#fn:78" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">78</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In the Karhad grant of Kṛṣṇa III of the Rāṣtrakūṭadynasty, the king mentions his having granted in Śaka 880 (=958 A. D.), a village to Gaganaśiva, the practiser of great austerities, who was fully versed in all the Śivasiddhāntas and was the pupil of Īśānaśiva, who was an Ācārya, or preceptor, and the head of the establishment at Valkaleśvara in Karahāṭa. These holy men and their establishment seem to have belonged to the Śaiva sect and not to the Pāśupata. The evidence for the existence of Kālāmukha and Śaiva sects in Mysore, in the latter part of the twelfth century, will be given in the next section.</p>
<p>Here it seems necessary to make another distinction. Bāṇa in the Kādambarīrepresents Pāśupatas with red clothing to have been among those who waited to see Tārāpīda&rsquo;s minister Śukanāsa at the door of his house for some private purposes of their own; but in another place he represents Vilāsavatī, the queen of Tārāpīda, to have gone to the temple of Mahākālaon the fourteenth (of the dark half of the month) to worship the god. Bhavabhūti In the Mālatīmādhava (Act III) represents Mālatīto have gone with her mother to the temple of Śaṁkara on the fourteenth of the dark half of the month. This fourteenth day still continues to be sacred to Śiva when special worship is performed. Now Vilāsavatīand Mālatīand her mother can hardly have been meant to be members of that sect, some followers of which with a red clothing were waiting at Śukanāsa&rsquo;s door. It, therefore, appears to be clear that all worshippers of Śiva were not members of any of those</p>
<p>sects the names of which have come down to us, as observed in a previous section.</p>
<p>Rudra-Śiva had gradually from the earliest times grown to be a god commonly worshipped by the Indians, and he has continued. to be their ordinary god to this day. The sects that subsequently arose were based upon specific methods of redemption, when religious and philosophic thought was advancing or perhaps declining, but the old god was resorted to by ordinary people without reference to them. And it must be remarked that those sects must have had. a clerical or ascetic, class as well as a class of lay followers or householders—and probably in some cases at least Hiuen. Tsiang means these last by his Pāśupatas—and a class of Śaiva religious men, as distinct from lay followers, existed in Karahāṭaas we have noticed.</p>
<p>There were thus three classes of Śiva worshippers :—(1) clericals or ascetics, (2) their lay followers, and (3) ordinary people who had no particular connection with any sect. The poets Kālīdasa, Subandhu, Bāṇa, Śrī-Harṣa, Bhaṭṭa-Nārāyaṇa, Bhavabhūti and several others adore Śiva at the beginning of their works. They may have been the lay followers of any of the sects, but, in all likelihood, they belong to the third class. For of these Subandhu, Bāṇa and Bhaṭṭa-Nārāyaṇa invoke Hari or another form of Viṣṇuat the same time, thus showing that they were not exclusive adherents of one of the two gods. The many temples of Śiva constructed by the early Cālukyas and the Rāṣṭrakūṭas, and the Kailāsa and other cave temples at Ellora excavated by the latter, contain no indication of their being intended for a specific Śaiva sect, and therefore they may be regarded as pointing to the diffusion of the general worship of Śiva in Mahārāṣṭra from the seventh to the tenth century.</p>
<p><strong>VI. Names and Doctrines of the Śaiva Sects.</strong></p>
<p>§ 91. The older Śaiva sects had and have a literature of their own, the so-called Āgamas attributed to Śiva himself, and a number of works by human authors. But the literature has not yet been published nor even discovered. I bave, therefore, necessarily to resort to the stray notices about the sects and their</p>
<p>doctrines, contained in works not written by the followers of the systems except in one case. With the more modern sects. the case is different, their literature having recently become. available.</p>
<p>Śaṁkara says that the Māheśvaras maintain that Paśupati has revealed five topics (Br. S. II. 2. 37). Thus the sects were. known by the general name of Māheśvara, and Paśupati, or the god Śiva, was believed to be their founder. Rāmānuja under the same Sūtra, which, however, is numbered 35, speaks of the systems as the tenets of Paśupati. Keśava Kāśmīrin calls the sects the followers of the &ldquo;tenets of Paśupati.&rdquo; Śrīkaṇṭha-Śivācārya calls them the &ldquo;believers in the Āgamas revealed by Parameśvara, or the great god&rdquo;. The name Māheśvara is the old name as is evident from the fact that Wema-Kadphises, as noticed above, and several later princes, especially of the Valabhīdynasty, called. themselves Māheśvaras. Hiuen Tsiang, too, as we have seen, mentions temples of Maheśvara, at which the Pāśupatas worshipped. It also follows that all these sects were at the same time known by the name of Pāśupata sects; and the founder of them all was believed to be the god Paśupati.</p>
<p>The same conclusion is to be deduced from the Mysore Inscriptions that have been published, the only difference being that the original teacher is called Lakulin or Lakulīśa. In one Inscription dated 943 A. D., referred to above, it is stated that Lakulīśa, being afraid that his name and doctrines would be forgotten, became incarnate as Muninātha Cilluks<sup id="fnref:79"><a href="#fn:79" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">79</a></sup>.&rdquo;). This appears to be a general name applicable to all systems. In another dated 1078 A. D. one ascetic is called an ornament to the Lākula school and another is spoken of as &ldquo;a hand to Lākula&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:80"><a href="#fn:80" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">80</a></sup>. This appears to be the general name and does not point to a specific sect. In a third dated 1103 A. D. Someśvara-Sūri ist spoken of as having caused the Lākula doctrine (Siddhānts) to bloom. He is called a Naiyãyikaand Vaīśeṣika<sup id="fnref:81"><a href="#fn:81" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">81</a></sup>.&quot;). This shows</p>
<p>that he belonged to the specific Pāśupata seot. In a fourth dated 1177 A. D. certain ascetics are called upholders of the Lākulāgamasamaya, i. e., the system based upon a work of Lākulin, and adherents of Kālāmukhas<sup id="fnref:82"><a href="#fn:82" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">82</a></sup>.&quot;).Here evidently the Kālāmukhas are called Lākulas, which is the same as Pāśupatas. The names of the ascetics mentioned in this Inscription end in the word śakti and jīya, which appear to be characteristic of the Kālāmukha sect. In a fifth dated 1183 A. D. is noticed a grant to Nāgaśiva-Paṇḍita, who is called an upholder of the Lākula system, and the names of his preceptors in the two preceding generations end in the suffix śiva. Nagaśiva is praised for emipence in Āgama and in Śivatattva³. From the ending suffix śiva in these names and the mention of a proficiency in Āgama and in Śivatattva, it appears that Nāgaśiva was a follower of the Śaiva school and at the same time he was a Lākula, or Pāśupata. A sixth dated 1199 A. D. notices a grant of land to Bammadeva, son of Nāgarāsi, the promoter of the system based upon the work. of Lākulin<sup id="fnref:83"><a href="#fn:83" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">83</a></sup>. The sufflx rāśi is found in a great many names of the devotees of Śiva. Whether it is a characteristic of a specific sect is not clear, but it appears that the bearers of it belong to the Pāśupata, or the Kālāmukha school. In a seventh dated 1213 A. D. a certain religious man is represented as the upholder of the system known by the name of Vāgi-Lākula, i. e. the systemof the learned Lākulin<sup id="fnref:84"><a href="#fn:84" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">84</a></sup>. In an eighth dated 1285 A. D. the grantor is called a supporter of the new system of Lākulin<sup id="fnref:85"><a href="#fn:85" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">85</a></sup>.&quot;). This perhaps refers to the later school of Lingāyatas.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>3.Ep. Carn. Vol, V, ArsikereTaluq No. 89. Another holy person of the name of Nāga with the suffix rāśi instead of śiva is mentioned in Inascr. No. 69 Arsikere Taluq (Ep. Carn. Vol. V, p. 137). A grant in therein recorded to Mādhajīya, a disciple of Nāgarāśi, who belonged to the Kālāmukhas and was himself the disciple of Padmaśiva-Paṇḍita. Another Nāgarāśi is mentioned in Inscr. No. 48 (Ibid.). The grantes in this case is Kalyāṇaśakti, disciple of Śivasaktideva, who was himself the disciple of Nāgarāśi,&ldquo;bound to theKālāmukhas&rdquo;. ThisNāgarāśi, or these twoNāgarāśis, appear to me to the different from theNāgarāśi mentioned in the text. And the use of the terminationrāśi in his case, he being aKālāmukha, and of the wordśakti in the case of two of the pupils, strengthens my supposition that these were characteristic of theKālāmukha sect, the former being applicable to thePāśupata also.</p>
<p>Thus it will be seen that Lākula was the general name by which the Śaiva sects were called, and the specific name Kālāmukha is associated with the general name in one case. This general name has for its basis the historical fact, noticed above, that a person of the name of Lākulin or Lakulīsafounded a Śaiva system corresponding to the Pāñcarātra system, which the Vāyuand Liṅga Purāṇas consider to be contemporaneous with it. The other general name Pāśupata arose by dropping the name of the human individual Lākulin and substituting that of the god Pāśupati, whose incarnation he was believed to be, as is done in the texts of the MBh. quoted above. But that the Śaiva system had a human founder is confirmed by the fact that the name of his work, the Pañcādhyāyī, or Pañcārthavidyā, has been handed down, as will be shown immediately below, and probably the work is extant, even if it has not yet been discovered, as Mādhava mentions a gloss on the perpetual commentary (Bhāṣya) on it, which also will be noticed below.The conclusion therefore appears to be that a certain historical person was the founder of the main Śaiva system which was the same as that explained by Mādhava as Nakulīśa-Pāśupata, and that three other systems arose out of it in later times.</p>
<p>The commentators of Śaṁkara state that there were four of these schools bearing the names of Śaiva, Pāśupata, Kārukasiddhāntin and Kāpālika. Vācaspati, however, calls the third. Kāruṇikasiddhāntin. Rāmānuja and Keśava Kāśmīrin mention the same four schools, but call Kāruṇikasiddhāntin by the name of Kālāmukha. The word Kāruka is probably a corruption of Kāuruṣya, the name of the third of the four (according to the Purāṇas) pupils of Lakuliśa, or this last name may be the Sanskritised form of the original Kāruka<sup id="fnref:86"><a href="#fn:86" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">86</a></sup>. The Śaiva school, however, is called Siddhāntamärga and the Kālāmuklas are called Mahāvratadharas.&quot;). A work of the name of</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>3.These four schools are mentioned in the Vāyavīyasaṁhitā of the Śiva-Purāṇa (II. 24, 177). The Śaiva school, however, is called Siddhāntamärga and the Kālāmukhas are called Mahāvratadharas.</p>
<p>Pañcādhyāyī, dealing with the five topics alluded to above and attributed to Paśupati, is mentioned by Keśava Kāśmīrin and is quoted by Rāmānanda on Kāsīkhaṇḍa¹. This must be the same work as that which is quoted from by Mādhava in the section on Nakulīśa-Pāśupata and attributed by him to Nakulīśa or Lakulīśa.</p>
<p>VII. The Pāśupata System.</p>
<p>§ 92. The five topics mentioned by Śaṁkara and explained by his commentators are these (1) Kārya, or effect, which is Mahat and the rest produced from Pradhāna; (2) Kāraṇa, or the cause. which is Īśvara or Maheśvara and also Pradhāna; (3) Yoga, which is absorption in meditation or the muttering of the syllable Oṁ, contemplation, concentration, eto.;(4) Vidhi, bathing (in ashes) at the three points of time, i. e., the beginning, the middle and the end of the day, and the rest up to Gūdḥacaryā, i. e. incognito movement; (5) Duḥkhānta, which is final deliverance. This is amplified by Mādhavain the section on the Pāśupata sect.</p>
<p>I. Effect (Kārya) is that which is not independent. It is ofthree kinds: (1) cognition (Vidyā), (2) organs (Kalā), and (3) individual soul (Paśu). Of these cognition is the property of the individual and is of two kinds: (1) external, and (2) internal. External cognition is of two kinds: (1) distinct, and (2) indistinct. Distinct external cognition, which is educed by the instruments of knowledge, is called conceptual operation (Citta). For by the conceptual operation every man reduces to definiteness the thing</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.See Aufrecht&rsquo;s Cat. Cat. The Vāyavīya Saṁhita (II, 24, 169) also mentions this work, which it characterises as the highest theosophy (Vidyā) of Śiva and gives Pañcārtha as its name, i, e, Pañcirchavidyt. This Pancarton appears to be alluded to by Mādhava when he refers his reader to the Pāncārthabhāsyādīpikā in bis section on Nakulīśa-Pāśupata. In an Inscription in the temple of Harṣanāth, which exists in the Sīkar principality of the Jaipur state, a person of the name of Viśvarūpa is mentioned as the teacher of the pañcārtha-Lākulāmnāyā, I. e. the sacred book of Lakulin, called Pañcārtha. The Inscriṇtion is dated V, E. 1013= A. D. 957, so that there can be on question that the Pāśupata system was attributed to &rsquo;s buman author named Lakulin, the work composed by him being called Pañcārtha (Ep. Ind. II. p. 123).</p>
<p>The occurrence of the names of the schools and of this book in the Purāṇa shows that its composition was later than the foundation of the school, which, therefore, must be considered as owing nothing to it.</p>
<p>that has been apprehended definitely or indefinitely by the aid of the light in the shape of the external object. The internal cognition is of the nature of virtue or vice, which forms the objective. of the indul and determines for him the body of precepts he has to follow. Organs are dependent on the cognitive individual and are themselves insensate. They are of two kinds: (1) effects, and (2) causes. The effected organs are of ten kinds: the five elements, earth and others, and the five qualities, colour and others. The organs, which are causes, are of thirteen kinds: the five senses, and the five organs of action, and the three internal organs, viz. intelligence, egoism and mind, the functions of which are the determination of the will, the consciousness of the self, and the formation of a plan respectively. The individual (Paśu) is that which has individualism (Paśutva). It is of two kinds: (1) impure, and (2) pure. The impure individual is that which is connected with the body and the organs, while the pure one is unconnected with them. The details should be seen in the Pañcārthabhāsyadīpikāand other works.</p>
<p>II. The cause (Kāraṇa) is that which effects the destruction of the whole creation and its prosperity or promotion. Though it is one, still on account of its various properties and functions it has many forms, such as lord (Pati), naturally powerful (Sādya), eto. To be the lord means to have the unbounded power of knowing and acting. He is, therefore, the eternal ruler. To be a Sādya is to be possessed of supreme sovereignty, which is not incidental, but natural.</p>
<p>III. Yoga is the connecting of the individual soul with god through the conceptual faculty (Citta). It is of two kinds, consisting in (1) action, and (2) cessation from action. The first consists in muttering syllables and formulas, meditation, etc. The second, or cessation from action, consists in mere feeling (Saṁvid).</p>
<p>IV. Vidhi, or process, is an operation which effects or brings about righteousness. It is of two kinds: (1) primary, and (2) secondary. The first, or primary, is conduct (Caryā) which induces righteousness directly. That conduct is of two kinds: (1) vows, and (2) means or doors. The vows consist in besmearing</p>
<p>the body with ashes and lying down in ashes, definite practices (Upahāra), muttering and circumambulation. Thus has Nakulīśa said: &ldquo;One should besprinkle one&rsquo;s body at the three points of the day and lie down in ashes.&rdquo; The definite practices are six. These have been stated by the author of the Sūtras to be laughing, singing, dancing, Huḍukkāra, prostration, and inaudible repetition. With these he says one should worship. Laughing is the making of the sound &lsquo;hā! hā! hā! by the forcible stretch. of the throat and the lips. Singing is the contemplation of the attributes of Maheśvara in accordance with the rules of the science of music. Dancing should be resorted to by contracting and stretching forth hands, feet, etc. and all other principal and subsidiary limbs accompanied by the representation of feeling in accordance with the science of dancing and gesticulation. Huḍukkāra is a holy sound resembling that of an ox made by striking the tongue on the palate. Huḍukis an imitative sound like the sacrificial Vaṣaṭ. When there is a crowd of people, all this should be done so as not to be observed.</p>
<p>The means, or doors, are these: (1) Krāthana, i.e.affecting to be asleep when one is awake; (2) Spandana, which is the moving or the shaking of the limbs as if they were paralysed; (3) Maṇḍana, or the walking as if one&rsquo;s legs and other limbs were disabled;(4) Śṛṅgāraṇa, which is showing oneself to be in love by means of amorous gestures as if on seeing a beautiful young woman; (5) Avitatkaraṇa, which is doing a thing condemned by all as if one were devoid of the sense of discrimination between. what should be done and what should be avoided; (6) Avitadbhāṣaṇa, which is speaking nonsensical and absurd things.</p>
<p>Secondary processes are those which are intended to help the conduct (Caryā), such as besmearing with ashes after worship, and to remove the sense of indecency or impropriety attaching itself to begging and eating the remnant of what others have esten. For this purpose the author of the Sūtras has laid down. that one should besmear his body after the worship and wear the faded flowers and leaves which had been removed from the god. and a Liṅga (the image of the phallus).</p>
<p>V. Duḥkhānta, or final deliverance, is of two kinds: (1) total</p>
<p>destruction of misery, and (2) an elevated condition consisting in the possession of the power of knowing and acting. The power of knowing is of five kinds: (1) Darśana, or seeing all objects which are atomic, concealed or are at a distance, and touching them; (2) Śravaṇa, or the miraculous hearing of all sounds (3) Manana, or the miraculous knowing of all objects of thought; (4) Vijñāna, or the miraculous knowledge of all the sciences with that of the treatises on them and the matter contained in these last; and (5) Sarvajñatva, or the miraculous. knowledge of the principles (of a science), whether mentioned or unmentioned, succinct and detailed, with their divisions and peculiarities. The peculiarities of the present system are such as these: In other systems the destruction of misery is final deliverance; in this system the attainment of the highest powers. is also to be added. With others, that which comes into existence from non-existence is an effect; here the effect is eternal such as Paśu, or the individual soul. In other systems the cause depends for its operation on a subordinate cause; here the great lord acts independently. With others, the fruit of the Yoga, or concentration, is the attainment of an absolute condition; here it is the attainment of the highest powers. With others Vidhi, or process, has for its fruit heaven and other places, from which there is a return to mortal life; in this system the fruit is proximity etc. (to god ), from which there is no return.</p>
<p>The power of acting, though one, is regarded as threefold: (1) Manojavitva, or the power of doing anything instantly: (2) Kāmarūpitva, or the power of assuming variety of shapes. and forms or bodies and senses without an effort; (3) Vikramaṇadharmitva, or the possession of great power, even when the operation of the senses is suspended. Thus then a man acquires these miraculous powers of knowledge and action at the end of a long course of conduct and discipline prescribed by the Pāśupata system.</p>
<p>It will be seen how fantastic and wild the processes prescribed in this system for the attainment of the highest condition are. Rudra-Śiva was the god of the open fields and wild and awful régions away from the habitations of men and worshipped by</p>
<p>aberrant or irregular people. This character did impress itself on the mode of worship for his propitiation, which was developed in later times. The ŚU. endeavoured to humanise Rudra-Śiva; but the wild and outlandish character of the god prevailed. We will now proceed to the consideration of the Śaiva system which seems to have been established in later times. Here also Mādhava will be our main guide, since the many works that he quotes. from are not available.</p>
<p><strong>VIII. The Śaiva System.</strong></p>
<p>§ 93. There are three principles: (1) the lord (Pati), (2) the individual soul (Paśu), and (3) fetters (Pāśa); and the whole system has four Pādas, or parts, which are knowledge (Vidyā), action (Kriyā), meditation ( Yoga), and conduct, or discipline (Caryā). The first part contains an explanation of the nature. of the individual soul (Paśu), fetters (Pāśa), and god (Īśvara), and determines the importance of formulas (Mantra) and the lord presiding over the formulas (Mantreśvara). This leads to initiation (Dikṣā), which is necessary for the acquisition of the highest object of life. The second part contains an explanation of the process of initiation (Dīkṣāvidhi ), which is of many forms and has many parts. The third part explains meditation, or concentration, along with its subsidiary processes.The fourth teaches discipline, or conduct, consisting in doing what is prescribed and avoiding what is proscribed. Without this Yoga is not possible.</p>
<p>I. Now the lord (Pati) is Śiva. Śiva acts, being impelled. thereto by the deeds (Karman) of souls, and produces things to be enjoyed or suffered and their means. The exercise of his He does! creative power thus depends on the Karman of man. everything; therefore, he is omniscient. God has not a body like that of an individual soul which has the fetters of taint and Karman, etc.; but he has a body made up of powers, certain specific five formulas (Mantras<sup id="fnref:87"><a href="#fn:87" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">87</a></sup> and In the Mahämäräynolya Up. 17. The commentator considers these to refer to the five facos of Śiva, respectively. They are Badyojita, Vāmadeva, Aghora, Tasparuṣa and Īśāna. They are also called forms of ŚivaOne of the Dānas, or charitable gifts, mentioned by Hemādri (DānakhaṇḍaVol. I, pp. 789-798 Bibl. Ind.) consists of üve images made of gold or other motal fashioned in a particular manner of these five forms of Śiva. In giving each a certain verse bas to be repeated. These five forms are Ident fed in a Śaiva treatise with the earth, water, fire, wind an d ather, respectively, and they are considered as the creators of these elements la another, viz., Virn-Śaiva-Cintamani, Sholapur 1908 A. D.&quot;)) being imagined to be thedifferent parts of his body. These five are his powers and are also considered his different forms, and by these he does the five actions. which are creation, existence or protection, destruction, concealment, and benefaction. The following four partake of the nature. of Śiva: (1) formulas (Mantras), (2) the deity presiding over the formulas (Mantreśvara), (3) the great god (Maheśvara), and (4) delivered souls (Mukta).</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.These five formulas, or Mantras, are contained in the TA. (X. 43-47) and In the Mahānārāyaṇīya Up. 17. The commentator considers these to refer to the five faces of Śiva, respectively. They are Sadyojāta, Vāmadeva, Aghora, Tasparuṣa and Īśāna. They are also called forms of Śiva One of the Dānas, or charitable gifts, mentioned by Hemādri (Dānakhaṇḍa Vol. I, pp. 789-798 Bibl. Ind.) consists of five images made of gold or other motal fashioned in a particular manner of these five forms of Śiva. In giving each a certain verse bas to be repeated. These five forms are Ident fed in a Śaiva treatise with the earth, water, fire, wind an d ather, respectively, and they are considered as the creators of these elements la another, viz., Vīra-Śaiva-Cintāmani, Sholapur 1908 A. D.</p>
<p>II. The Paśu is the individual soul, who is atomic and known.by the name of Kṣetrajña (self-conscious) and others. It is eternal and all-pervading. It is not incapable of action nor is it one only, as is maintained by other schools of philosophy. When the fetters are removed, he becomes Śiva, possessing eternal and -boundless knowledge and power of action. The Muktas, or delivered ones, are Śivas, who have so become by the favour of him who is eternally Mukta, and is a person with five formulas. (Mantras ) for his body, i. e. he is identified with the god Śiva himself. Though they become Śivas, they are not independent. but depend upon the eternal god, Śiva. Paśu is of three kinds: (1) Vijñānākala, who has shaken off his connection with all the organs (Kalāḥ<sup id="fnref:88"><a href="#fn:88" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">88</a></sup>) in consequence of the destruction of the impression of deeds done, by means of knowledge, meditation, asceticism, or by the enjoyment or suffering of the fruit (Bhoga), and has simple taint (Mala). The second is Pralayākala, whose organs are destroyed by the dissolution of the world. He has both impression of deeds (Karman) and taints (Mala). The third is Śakala, who has all the three fetters, taint (Mala), impression of deeds. (Karman), and material cause (Māyā). Vijñanākala is of two kinds (1) one whose taint (Kaluṣa) has ended, and (2) another whoso taint (Kaluṣa) has not ended. The first are those, who, their taint (Kaluṣa) having ended, are elevated to the position of Vidyeśvaras. The Vidyeśvaras are eight and are as follows: (1) Ananta, or endless, (2) atomic, (3) the most excellent Śiva, (4)</p>
<p>the one-eyed. (5) the one Rudra, (6) he with the three forms, (7) Śrīkaṇṭha, and (6) Śikhaṇḍin. Another author says that Śiva invests the Samāptakaluṣa (one whose taint has ended) with Vidyeśatva, which is of eight kinds, and the Asamāptakaluṣa (one whose taint has not onded) he raises to the dignity of fomulas. (Mantras) which are seven crores. Pralayākala is also of two kinds. The first is one whose two fetters have matured (and about to be shaken off), and the second is different from him. The first attains Mokṣa, and the second, entangled with Puryaṣṭaka, undergoes many births in accordance with his impressisn of deeds. (Karman). The Puryaṣṭaka is a subtle body, wich is composed of elements which are variously enumerated. Of those who have the Puryaṣṭaka, some, who are virtuous, are raised to Bhuvanapatitva by Maheśvara Ananta. Sakala is also of two kinds: (1) one whose taint (kaluṣa) is matured, and (2) one whose taint (kaluṣa) is not matured. The first is raised to the dignity of Mantreśvara of 118 Mantras, i. e of so many kinds. Parameśvara, assuming the form of his preceptor by the process of initiation. and the use of power calculated to counteract the matured taint, confers Mokṣa. Those Aṇus or atomio souls, whose taint has not ripened (i. e. is not in a condition to be wiped away), are made to suffer or enjoy in accordance with their Karman.</p>
<p>III. Pāśa (fetter) is of four kinds: (1) Mala, or taint (2) Karman, or the impression of deeds, (3) Māyā, or material cause, and (4) Rodhaśakti, or obstructive power. Mala, or tsint, is that which conceals the knowing and acting power of the soul and is like the husk enveloping a grain of rice. Karman is the impression of deeds done for the attainment of fruit. It is righteous or un- righteous. It is unbeginning, ever continuing in succesion in the manner of seed and its sprout. Māyāis that into which the whole creation resolves itself at the time of dissolution and from which it springs out at the time of recreation. The obstructive power is the power of Siva which, because it regulates the three other fetters and conceals the true nature of the soul, is itself called a fetter. It performs its function, because it is the principle. of speech by means of which names are given to things and thus. their nature is determined<sup id="fnref:89"><a href="#fn:89" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">89</a></sup>.</p>
<p>§ 94. This constitutes the first part of the system (Vidyāpāda), the nature of the other three parts has been succinetly given above. A few details are these<sup id="fnref:90"><a href="#fn:90" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">90</a></sup>: The second part (Kriyapāda) treats of the accomplishment of Mantra, the twilight adorations, worship, muttering of formulas (Japa), throwing oblations into the fire, acossional ceremonies for the attainment of eternal bliss, anointing of the preceptor and of the person ontering on a course of action for final emancipation (Sādhaka), and one&rsquo;s own initiatory ceremonies necessary to fit one for a wordly and for an eternal life. In the third, or the Yoga part are mentioned the thirty-six principles; the deities presiding over them; the lords of the different worlds; the individual soul; the all-ruling soul, the power (Śakti); the direct perception of Māyāand Mahāmāyā, which are the causes of the world; the attainment of the miraculous powers, minuteness, lightness, eto. for those who concern themselves with the worldly element; the methods of the restraint. of the breath, abstraction, meditation, concentration, and absorption in thought (Samādhi); and the positions of the circles in the body beginning with the root-circle (Mūlādhara, or navel). The fourth part treats of penances, a purificatory ceremony (Pavitrāropaṇa), the foundation, and the natures of Śivaliṅga, of the visible Liṅga of Umā and Maheśvara, and of the lord of Gaṇas, or groups, such as Skanda and Nandin, of the rosary used for the muttering of formulas, and the funeral Śrāddhas. This last part appears to contain matters subsidiary to, and explanatory of, the actions enjoined in the second part. The proscribed actions mentioned above are: (1) the eating of the residue of what is offered to another deity; (2) the vilification of (a) Śiva, (b) of the devotees of Śiva, (c) of the system of Śiva and (d) of the practices enjoined. in the Śaiva system; (3) the enjoyment of things belonging to God; (4) the killing of animals.</p>
<p>§ 95.The doctrines of the Śaiva school are more moderate and rational than those of the Pāśupāta school. This last, as well as the two extreme schools to be mentioned next, are called Atimārgika, or schools that are away from the path or go astray, and are spoken of by Śaṁbhudeva, quoted in the above paragraph, as revealed by Rudra. The Śaiva schools he calls the Siddhāntaśāstra, or the true</p>
<p>Śāstra based upon the Mantras, and says that it was revealed byŚiva. The Vāyavīyasaṁhitāalso calls it the Siddhānta school.</p>
<p>It will have been seen that both this and the Pāśupata schoolare dualistic or pluralistic and maintain that the supreme andindividual souls are distinct entities and the Pradhāna the constituent cause of the material world. In the delivered conditionthe individual soul shakes off its ignorance and weakness andattains boundless knowledge and power of action according tothe Pāśupata doctrine, while the Śaivas hold that he becomesŚiva himself, i. e. attains perfect resemblance with the God Śivawithout, however, the power of creation.</p>
<p>The Śaiva school, that developed itself in later times, and isrepresented by Śaṁbhudeva and Śrīkaṇṭheśivācārya, to benoticed hereafter, and supported also by texts in the Vāyavīyasaṁhitā, holds that Śiva possesses or develops in himself a Śakti,or power, consisting of the rudiments of the individual soul andthe material world, and from this power the whole world isdeveloped. This doctrine may, therefore, be called qualifiedspiritual monism like that of Rāmānuja, in-as-much as Śivacharacterised by the Śakti creates. This last is a tenet of theLiṅgāyat school also.</p>
<p><strong>IX. Kāpāla and Kālāmukha Sects.</strong></p>
<p>§ 96. Rāmānuja tells us under II. 2. 35 or 36 that the Kāpālikas maintain that a man who knows the essence of the sixmarks (Mudrikā) and who is skilful in their use, attains thehighest bliss by concentrating his mind on the soul seated on thefemale organ. The six marks are (1) a necklace, (2) an ornament,(3) an ear-ornament, (4) a crest jewel, (5) ashes, and (6) the sacredthread (Yajñopavīta). He whose body bears these marks is free.from transmigration. The Kālāmukhas hold that the followingare the means for the attainment of desires concerning thisworld and the next:—(1) eating food in a skull; (2) besmearingthe body with the ashes of a dead body; (3) eating the ashes; (4)holding a club; (5) keeping a pot of wine; and (6) worshippingthe god as seated therein. A bracelet of Rudrākṣa, one string ofmatted hair on the head, s skull, besmearing the body with ashes, and such other things are mentioned in the Śaiva</p>
<p>sacred books. They also maintain that people of other castes.become Brāhmaṇas and attain to the highest order by the performance of certain rites. For it is said &ldquo;One becomes aBrāhmaṇa immediately after the process of simple initiation, and a man becomes a holy saint by undertaking the vow of a Kāpāla&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In the Śaṁkaradigvijaya (chap. XV, vv. 1-28) Mādhavabrings Śaṁkara into contact with the Kāpālikas at a place which,according to the commentator, was Ujjayinī. The preceptor ofthe sect came forward to meet Śaṁkara. His body was besmearedwith the ashes taken from a burning-ground. He had a skull inhis hand and also an iron lance. He said to Śaṁkara: &ldquo;Theashes on your body are all right¹. But why dost thou carry anunholy potsherd instead of the holy skull? Why dost thou notworship Kapālin who is Bhairava? How will Bhairava become.pleased unless he is worshipped by the skulls red with the blood.of men and with wine?&rdquo; Then ensues a fight between Sudhanvan,.the king, who accompanied Śaṁkara in his wanderings and theKāpālikas. Śaṁkara also pronounced a curse on them, and theywere all killed. Then Krakaca, the leader of the Kāpālikas,coming up to Śaṁkara, filled the skull in his band with wine,drank half of it and left the other half and invoked Bhairava.Bhairava came up and Krakaca prayed to him to destroy hisenemy; but as Śaṁkara was his own incarnation, he destroyed.Krakaca himself and not Śaṁkara. In Ānandagiri&rsquo;s book theKāpālikas, whom Śaṁkara meets at Ujjayinī, speak of Bhairavabeing the great god, who creates, destroys, etc. They profess tohave their knowing power sharpened by drinking wine andeating a certain kind of food (probably a disgusting substance)and always being embraced by the power (Śakti) of Kapälin, i. e.Bhairava. Bhavabhūti in his Malatimadhava gives Śrisails asthe principal seat of the Kāpālikas. Miraculous powers of speedymovement attained by the practice of Yoga are attributed tothem. The woman Kapālakuṇḍalāwears a garland of humanskulls. She carries away Mālatī, the heroine of the play, fromthe place where she was sleeping in her father&rsquo;s palace in thedead of night and places her before the image of Karāla-Cāmuṇḍānear the cemetery to be killed and sacrificed to the goddess byher preceptor Aghoraghaṇṭa.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Lines of ashes are borne on the body by ordinary Śaiva&rsquo;s also, andŚaṁkara&rsquo;s body was marked with them.</p>
<p>It will be seen how horrible and demoniacal this sect was.The fear which some of the phenomena of external nature inspirein the mind of man led to the Vedicconception of Rudra, andthis has now culminated into the ideal image of the horrid godBhairava with his wife Caṇḍikāwearing a garland of humanskulls and requiring human sacrifices and offerings of wine forhis propitiation. In the account just given there appears to be aconfusion between the sects of Kāpālikas and Kālāmukhas. From.Rāmānuja&rsquo;s account the Kālāmukhas appear to be the mostextreme sect; and they are called Mahavratadharas in the ŚivaPurāṇa as noticed above. Mahävrata means the great vow, andthe greatness of the vow consists in its extraordinary nature,such as eating food placed in a human skull, besmearing the bodywith the ashes of human carcasses and others which are attributedto the Kālāmukhas by Rämänuja. Jagaddhara, the commentatoron the Mālatīmādhava, however, explains Kāpālikavrata byMahāvrata¹, and this explanation appears to be correct, since theascetics dwelling in the temple of Kāpāleśvara in the Nāsikdistrict are, as we have seen, called in the grant Mahāvratins,or the observers of the great vow. The account of Kāpālikasgiven above from other authorities looks like those of the mostextreme sect. Ordinarily, therefore, people do not seem to havemade a sharp distinction between the Kāpālikas and theKālāmukhas.</p>
<p><strong>X. Kashmir Śaivism.</strong></p>
<p>$ 97. It is a relief now to turn away from this ghastly pictureof the wild aberrations of the human intellect and spirit to asystem of Śaivism more humane and rational. The KashmirŚaivism has two branches, the Spandaśātra and the Pratyabhijñāśastra. The authorship of the first is attributed to Vasuguptaand his pupil Kallaṭa. The two principal works of the system.are the Śivasūtram or Śivasūtraṇi and the Spandakārikās whichare fifty-one verses only. The first are said to have been revealed</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.Act I, p. 33, on 1. 127 of my second edition of the play.</p>
<p>to Vasugupta by Śiva himself or by a Siddha, or perfected humanbeing. They were inscribed on a rock on the Mahādeva hill, andVasugupta was directed to the rock by Śiva. Another account isthat they were revealed by the god in a dream, and another accountstill further confers the credit of the revelation on the prefectedhuman being. These two last occurrences are said to have taken.place on the Mahādeva hill. As to the second work, there arealso varying traditions, one ascribing the authorship of the versesto Vasugupta and another to Kallaṭa. A third tradition, however,that Kallaṭa obtained the knowledge of the system from Vasugupta and composed the Spandakārikās for the instruction of hispupils seems to contain the truth¹. What the meaning of theroundabout tradition about the Śivasūtras which do not ascribetheir authorship to Vasugupta directly is, it is difficult to say;perhaps the original work was the Spandakārikās and the proseŚivasūtras were composed in later times in the older or moreorthodox form, and as Vasugupta was probably too near the time.when they were composed and as what he did was known to all,&amp; miraculous origin was given to the new Sūtras and Vasuguptawas represented to have received them from others and not composed them himself.</p>
<p>$ 98. Kallaṭa lived in the reign of Avantivarman<sup id="fnref:91"><a href="#fn:91" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">91</a></sup>, 854 A. D.,wherefore his Guru&rsquo;s literary activity must be referred to the beginning of the ninth century. The followers of this school boldlydeny the necessity of God&rsquo;s having a prompting cause, such asKarman, or a material cause, like the Pradhāns, for the creation ofthe world. Neitherdo they admit that he is himself the materialcause, as the Vedāntasūtras maintain, nor do they think thatsome principle of illusion, such as Māyā, generates appearanceswhich are false. God is sccording to them independent andcreates merely by the force of his will all that comes into existence. He makes the world appear in himself, as if it were distinct from himself, though not so really, as houses or even townsappear in a mirror, and is as unaffected by it as the mirror is by</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1. For these various traditions see my Report on the Search for SanskritManuscripts during 1883-84, p. 77f. [=Volume II of this Edition p 199f.N. B.U.]</p>
<p>the images reflected in it. Neither does he exist only as realisedin the world, which is the conclusion that follows from thedoctrine that he is the material cause.In a verse attributed toVasugupta an obeisance is made to Sūlin, or Śiva, who is represented as portraying a picture of the world without a canvassand a collection of materials¹.</p>
<p>Another illustration that they give of creation without anymaterial or prompting cause is that of a Yogin who createsobjects by his mere will without any materials. God himself byhis own wonder-working power appears in the form of the manyindividual souls, and by means of another power, brings into existence the state of things which goes to form what we call thewakeful and dreamy condition of our life². Thus according tothis system the individual soul is identical with the supremesoul. But the former does not perceive this identity on accountof his impurity.</p>
<p>This impurity, or Mala, is of three kinds. When a soul forgets.his own free and universal nature through ignorance, and believeshimself to be imperfect, and regards things, such as the body,which are not himself, to be himself, and thus reduces himself tofiniteness or subjects himself to limitations, the impurity is called Āṇava (littleness). Then his remaining in the body, which isprepared by the originator of things, called Māyā, is anotherspecies of impurity known as Māyīya, or effected by Māyā. Andwhen under the influence of the internal organ, cr the heart, theorgans of action are set in motion, the impurity arising from itis called Kārma, or resulting from action, such as that consistingin a man&rsquo;s consciousness of having done a good or evil deed.which is to lead to happiness or misery in the end³. These severalkinds of impurity are brought into action by Nāda, which is thefemale element constituting a primeval power (Śakti) of Śivaand from which rises speech.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1. See Mādhava&rsquo;s Sarvadarṡanasaṁgraha, Pratyabhijñādarśana. This verseis quoted in the Kāvyaprakāśa, Chapter IV; and by other writers onAlaṁkāras.</p>
<p>2. See the first note on p. 80 of my Report for 1883-84[ Volume II of thisEdition, p. 203n2 N. B. U.]</p>

<p>Without speech the ideas which render a worldly life possiblecannot stand, or assume a shape or form, and therefore theprinciple of speech is believed to be the origin of the Mala, or impurity, which leads to a worldly life. This power is associatedwith others which are personalised as Ambā, Jyeṣṭha, Raudrī,Vāmā¹.</p>
<p>The impurity vanishes when by means of intense contemplation the vision of the highest being breaks in upon the mind ofthe devotee and absorbs all finite thought. When this conditionbecomes stable, the individual soul is free and becomes thesupreme soul. The breaking in of the vision is called Bhairava,because it is his and is caused by him<sup id="fnref:92"><a href="#fn:92" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">92</a></sup>.</p>
<p>§99. The founder of the Pratyabhijñāschool of KāśmīraŚaivism was Somānanda, the work written by whom is calledŚivadṛṣṭi. But the principal treatise of the school was composedby his pupil Udayākara, and contains verses which are calledSūtras. On these Sūtras there are glosses and detailed explanations by Abhinavagupta, the pupil of the pupil of Somananda<sup id="fnref:93"><a href="#fn:93" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">93</a></sup>.Abhinavagupta wrote between 993 and 1015 A. D<sup id="fnref:94"><a href="#fn:94" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">94</a></sup>., whereforeSomānanda must be taken to have lived in the first quarter of thetenth century.</p>
<p>The doctrines of the creation of the world and of the relationsbetween the individual and supreme souls set forth by thisschool are the same as those maintained by the preceding one.But the way of the perception of the identity is recognition.according to this system. There is an Upanṣiad text⁵, fromwhich it follows that every thing shines when He shines and</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1. Ibid. Sūtra 4, and Spandapradīpikā, V. 42. These several kinds of Mala andNāda correspond to Pāśas, or fetters, viz., Mala, Karman. MāyāandRodhaśakti given by Mādhava in the Śaivadarśana. The word Mala standshere for the Pāśa of that system and Āṇava for its Mala. It is also calledĀṇava by Śambhudeva.</p>
<p>3.Buhler, Report of a Tour made in Kaśmīr; extract from Nos. 465-66, p. OLX.</p>
<p>that everything becomes perceptible by His light, and thus ourknowing power is the same as God&rsquo;s and everything outside of usbecomes an object of knowledge by his illumining power.Capable of knowledge and action as we are, we partake of thenature of God; but there is no reason to place a limit to thisparticipation, and it must be understood that we are God himself. But the joy and elevation, characteristic of God, we areunconscious of in our present condition, and that is due to thefact that we do not recognise that we are God, though we arereally so. Just as a maiden, stricken with love for a youthwhose excellences have been described to her, is not filled withraptures when she is carried to him and looks upon him as anordinary individual, but is overjoyed and devotes her whole.soul to him when she is told that he is the man whose excellenceshad so fascinated her, so is it with the individual soul. Theserene bliss of godly nature he does not feel, though he is himself God, because he is not aware that those high attributes.But when he iswhich belong to the divine nature exist in himled to believe by his preceptor that he possesses them, i. e when.by his instructions he is enabled to recognise God in himself,then it is that the serene bliss dawns upon him. The Spandaschool mentions the dawning of the form or vision of Bhairava,or God, on the mind in the course of meditation and thereby theclearing away of the impurities as the way to the realisation ofthe identity with God, while this maintains that recognition ofoneself as God is the way.</p>
<p>According to Mādhava, these two systems do not enjoin restraint of the breath, concentration, and all that course of fantasticexternal and internal conduct or discipline which the other.These two schools apparentlyschools prescribe as essentialout themselves off from the old traditional Śaivism, whichgradually developed itself into the ghastly Kāpālism or Kālāmukhism, and hence the epithet Pāśupata or Lākula cannot beapplied to them in any sense. A fresh revelation, therefore, wastclaimed for Vasugupta, though some of the doctrines of the more.sober Śaiva school were preserved in the Spanda system.</p>
<p><strong>XI. The Vīrśaiva or Liṅgāyat Sect.</strong></p>
<p>§ 100. The foundation of this sect is generally attributed to</p>
<p>Basava, who was the son of Mādirāja, a Brāhmaṇa supposed to be of the Ārādhya sect. His story is given in the Basavapurāṇa</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>published in 1905, at Poona. From this story it by no means follows that he founded the sect by settling its doctrines and founding what may be called a church. He, however, appears to be a strenuous supporter of the sect. In the beginning of the Basavapurāṇa, Nārada is represented to have gone to Śiva and told him that on earth there were devotees of Viṣṇu, followers of the sacrificial religion, Jainas and Buddhists, but that there were no devotees of his. He mentions Visveśvarārādhya, Paṇḍitārādhya, Ekorāma, the great Yogin, and others as having flourished from time to time and established Śivabhakti, but there is none now. Śiva thereupon told his Nandin to become incarnate on earth for the promotion of his religion and the furtherance of the cause of Vīraśaivas.</p>
<p>From all this it does not appear that Basava was the originator of the sect. He had predecessors, three of whom have just been named. His was a life of political turmoil. From his native. place Bāgevāḍi he went to Kalyāṇa, when Vijjala or Vijjaṇa, was reigning (1157-1167 A. D.). His maternal uncle Baladeva was the minister of the king, and he himself was raised to the position after his death. Basava&rsquo;s sister, a beautiful woman, was married. by the king. He was in charge of the king&rsquo;s treasury and spent large amounts in supporting and entertaining members of Liṅgāyat mendicants, called Jaṅgamas. The matter came to the notice of the king Vijaṇa, who gradually became completely alienated from him, and endeavoured to apprehend him. Basava fled away, and the king sent a few men in persuit. These were easily defeated by Basava, whereupon the king himself advanced with troops to punish him; but Basava had collected a large number of followers and succeeded in defeating him. The king was reconciled to Basava and brought him back to Kalyāṇa, but there could be no true reconcilement, and after a time Basava caused the king to be assassinated.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1. This book and a good many others appertaining to the Liṅgāyat sect have been published under the patronage of an influential and enlightenedmember of the sect, the late Mr. MallāppāVārada of Sholapur.</p>
<p>§ 101. There is a work entitled Vijjalarāyacarita by a Jaina,which also gives an account of Basava and his relations withVijjaṇa. It is written from the point of view of an enemyof Basava, and mentions Basava&rsquo;s sister as having been given tothe king as a mistress, which was perhaps true. But since theLiṅgāyat account and the Jaina account agree in the main.particulars, they may be accepted as historical¹. Basava thuswas a scheming politician and could hardly have been the propounder of a new system of doctrines or the organiser of asect. Besides, in the many Liṅgāyat works now available, hisname is not mentioned as the name of a teacher of any articles offaith. What he did, therefore, appears to have been that be used hispolitical influence to raise the fortunes of the Vīraśaiva sect, to bringit into prominence, and to disseminate the creed. There is anotherman who has been brought forward by Dr. Fleet, on the strengthof certain Inscriptions, as the founder of the Liṅgāyat sect andthat is Ekānta, or Ekāntada, Rāmayya. An account of this person is also given in the second part of the Basavapurāṇa, andthis and that in the Inscriptions come to this that he was anenemy of the Jainas and wished to destroy their gods and shrines.He laid a wager with them that he would cut off his head and layit at the feet of Śiva, and if it should be restored to him and replaced on his shoulders as it was before, the Jainas should consent to throw down their idols and profess a belief in Śaivism.According to the Inscription, this was first done at Ablūr at theplace where it exists, and when Rāmayya compelled the Jainasto destroy their idols, they went to Kalyāṇa and complained toKing Vijjaṇa, who thereupon summoned Rāmayya into his presence and required him to explain why he did so. He offered torepeat the feat of cutting off his head and getting it back again inthe presence of the king. The Basavapurāṇa represents Basavahimself to have been present when Rāmayya laid this wager. Sothat beyond undermining the Jaina seot there is no evidence of Rāmavya&rsquo;s having built up the Vīraśaiva creed.</p>

<p>From all this it does not appear that Basava was the originator of the sect. He had predecessors, three of whom have just been named. His was a life of political turmoil. From his native. place Bāgevāḍi he went to Kalyāṇa, when Vijjala or Vijjaṇa, was reigning (1157-1167 A. D.). His maternal uncle Baladeva was the minister of the king, and he himself was raised to the position after his death. Basava&rsquo;s sister, a beautiful woman, was married. by the king. He was in charge of the king&rsquo;s treasury and spent large amounts in supporting and entertaining members of Liṅgāyat mendicants, called Jaṅgamas. The matter came to the notice of the king Vijaṇa, who gradually became completely alienated from him, and endeavoured to apprehend him. Basava fled away, and the king sent a few men in persuit. These were easily defeated by Basava, whereupon the king himself advanced with troops to punish him; but Basava had collected a large number of followers and succeeded in defeating him. The king was reconciled to Basava and brought him back to Kalyāṇa, but there could be no true reconcilement, and after a time Basava caused the king to be assassinated.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1. This book and a good many others appertaining to the Liṅgāyat seet havebeen published under the patronage of an influential and enlightenedmember of the sect, the late Mr. MallāppāVārada of Sholapur.</p>
<p>§ 101. There is a work entitled Vijjalarāyacarita by a Jaina,which also gives an account of Basava and his relations withVijjaṇa. It is written from the point of view of an enemyof Basava, and mentions Basava&rsquo;s sister as having been given tothe king as a mistress, which was perhaps true. But since theLiṅgāyat account and the Jaina account agree in the main.particulars, they may be accepted as historical¹. Basava thuswas a scheming politician and could hardly have been the propounder of a new system of doctrines or the organiser of asect. Besides, in the many Liṅgāyat works now available, hisname is not mentioned as the name of a teacher of any articles offaith. What he did, therefore, appears to have been that be used hispolitical influence to raise the fortunes of the Vīraśaiva sect, to bringit into prominence, and to disseminate the creed. There is anotherman who has been brought forward by Dr. Fleet, on the strengthof certain Inscriptions, as the founder of the Liṅgāyat sect andthat is Ekānta, or Ekāntada, Rāmayya. An account of this person is also given in the second part of the Basavapurāṇa, andthis and that in the Inscriptions come to this that he was anenemy of the Jainas and wished to destroy their gods and shrines.He laid a wager with them that he would cut off his head and layit at the feet of Śiva, and if it should be restored to him and replaced on his shoulders as it was before, the Jainas should consent to throw down their idols and profess a belief in Śaivism.According to the Inscription, this was first done at Ablūr at theplace where it exists, and when Rāmayya compelled the Jainasto destroy their idols, they went to Kalyāṇa and complained toKing Vijjaṇa, who thereupon summoned Rāmayya into his presence and required him to explain why he did so. He offered torepeat the feat of cutting off his head and getting it back again inthe presence of the king. The Basavapurāṇa represents Basavahimself to have been present when Rāmayya laid this wager. Sothat beyond undermining the Jaina seot there is no evidence of Rāmavya&rsquo;s having built up the Vīraśaiva creed.</p>

<p>choose a Guru, or preceptor, it is necessary to place four metallicvessols full of water at the four cardinal points and one in themiddle. This last belongs to the person to be consecrated as Guruor preceptor, who is supposed to represent an old Ācārya, orteacher, of the name of Viśvarādhya, and the other four to fourother priests chosen as having been brought up in the schools ofRevaṇasiddha, Marulasiddha, Ekorāma and Paṇḍitārādhya andconnected with certain Maṭhas, or establishments<sup id="fnref:95"><a href="#fn:95" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">95</a></sup>. The same.list is given in another treatise<sup id="fnref:96"><a href="#fn:96" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">96</a></sup>. These five vessels. are consocrated to the five faces or forms of Śiva, Sadyojāta, otc, mentioned in a former section<sup id="fnref:97"><a href="#fn:97" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">97</a></sup>. The Ācāryas, or teachers, named aboveare believed to have sprung from the five forms of Śiva in thisKali age<sup id="fnref:98"><a href="#fn:98" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">98</a></sup>. Others bearing other names, born in other ages of theworld, are also mentioned, but with these we have nothing to doOf these five teachers three at least are mentioned as having preceded Basavs in the passage quoted at the beginning of thissection.</p>
<p>It will thus appear that the Vīraśaiva, or Liṅgāyat, systemcame into existence before Basava. It is affiliated to the moderateor sober school of Śaivas known by the name of Śaivadarśana, orSiddhāntadarśana as it is called by its followers; and especiallyto the later form of it alluded to before<sup id="fnref:99"><a href="#fn:99" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">99</a></sup>. But its technical terms,Sthala, Aṅga, Liṅga, etc. and its ideas are entirely different fromthose of that school as explained by Mādhava and others. Andthese terms we do not meet with elsewhere, so that thismodern school. When it originated, it is difficult to say. But it was clearly in a militant condition in the time of Basava. Itmust, therefore, have originated about a hundred years before.The names of two at least of the five teachers as given above endin the word arä</p>
<p>dhya, while in other books all the five have thatepithet attached to their names<sup id="fnref:100"><a href="#fn:100" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">100</a></sup>. This was the name of a sectallied to the Liṅgāyats.</p>
<p>Of the five Ācāryas represented by the five metallic vessels,Mr. Brown¹ does not mention the middle one and calls all the otherfour Ārādhyas, so that all the five preceptors honoured at the timeof initiation and other ceremonies belong to the Ārādhya sect,which, according to Mr. Brown, was a sect of the Vīraśaiva creed.There has been a good deal of ill-feeling between the Ārādhyasand the ordinary Liṅgāyats, and that appears to be due to theretention by the former of some Brāhmaṇic rites, such as repeating the holy Gāyatrīmantra and wearing the sacred thread. Butthe very name Ārādhya, which means one to be adored or worshipped, shows that, before the contention between the two sects.arose the Ārādhyas enjoyed very great respect.</p>
<p>Taking all these circumstances into consideration, what appearsto be the truth is that the Vīraśaiva creed was reduced to a shapeby the Ārādhyas, who must have been men of learning and helyliving, and the subsequent reformers, such as Basava, gave it adecidedly uncompromising and anti-Brāhmaṇical character. And thus these two sects of the Vīraśaiva faith came into existence.We will now give a short account of the doctrines of this school.</p>
<p>§ 103. The One, Highest, Brahman, characterised by existence(Sat), intelligence (Cit), and joy (Ānanda), is the essence of Śiva(Śivatattva) and is called Sthals. Then are given explanations asto why it is called Sthala, two of them based upon an artificialetymology. In the supreme Brahman, or the essence of Śiva,Mahat and other principles exist and are eventually resolved intoit. In the first existence the universe, arising from Prakṛti andPuruṣa, and to it it returns at the end; therefore it is called Sthala.(The first part stha signifies sthāna, or standing, and the secondpart la signifies laya, or resolution.) That name is given to italso because it is the support of the whole moveable and immoveable world and holds all powers, all luminaries, and all souls.It is the resting place of all beings, of all worlds, and of all possessions. It is the highest place to be attained by those who seekthe highest happiness, and therefore it is called the One only andnon-dualistic Sthala (position).</p>
<p>By the agitation of its innate power (Śakti), that Sthala becomes divided into two: (1) Liṅgasthala, (2) Aṅgasthala. Liṅgasthala is Śiva or Rudra and is to be worshipped or adored, whilethe Aṅgasthala is the individual soul, the worshipper or adorer.In the same manner, the Śakti, or power, divides herself into twoby her own will, one of the parts resorting to Śiva and beingcalled Kalā, and the other resorting to the individual soul andbeing called Bhakti, or devotion. Śakti, or power, has got a certainsusceptibility, which leads it to action and entanglement with theworld, while Bhakti is free from that susceptibility and turnsaway from action and from the world and leads to final deliverance. The Śakti, or power makes one an object of worship,while Bhakti makes one a worshipper; therefore, the formerexists in the Liṅga or Śiva, and the latter in the Anga or individual soul. Eventually, by this Bhakti, there is a union betweenthe soul and Śiva.</p>

<p>1.Madras journal of Literature and Science, Vol. XI.</p>
<p>The Liṅga is Śiva himself, and not a mere external emblem ofhim. The Liṅgasthala is divided into three: (1) Bhāvaliṅga, (2)Prāṇaliṅga, and (3) Iṣṭaliṅga. The first is without any parts(Kalā) and is to be perceived by faith. It is simple Sat (existence), not conditioned by space or time, and is higher thanthe highest. The second is to be apprehended by the mind andhas parts and is without parts. The third has parts and isapprehensible by the eye. This confers all desired (iṣṭa) objectsand removes afflictions; or it receives its name because it isworshipped (iṣṭa) with care. The Pranaliṅga is the intelligence(Cit) of the Supreme Soul, and Iṣṭaliṅga, the joy. The first isthe highest principle, the second is the subtle form, and the third,the gross form.</p>
<p>These three Liṅgas, corresponding to the soul, the life and thegross form, and being characterised by use (Prayoga), formulas.(Mantra) and action (Kriyā), form what are called Kalā, Nādaand Bindu. Each of these three is divided into two; the firstInto Mahāliṅga and Prasādaliṅga, the second into Caraliṅga andŚivaliṅga, and the third into Guruliṅga and Ācāraliṅga.These six operated on by six kinds of Śakti, or power, give riseto the following six forms. (1) When the Śiva essenceoperated on by the power of intelligence (Cit), it forms theMahāliṅga, the attributes of which are the absence of birth and</p>
<p>death, freedom from taint, perfection, unity, subtleness, beinghigher than the highest, incurruptibility, unfathomableness,capability of being apprehended by faith and love, and idealistic(Caitanyarūpa (2) When the Śiva essence gets permeatedwith its highest power (Parāśakti), then is produced a principlecalled Sādākhya¹ which is light, eternal, indivisible, imperceptible to the senses, apprehensible by reason, indestructible, and therudiment that develops; and that principle is called Prasādaliṅga.(3) When the Śiva essence is operated on by its primeval power(Ādiśakti), Caraliṅga is produced, which is infinite and pervadesthe internal and external world, which is full of light, is aPuruṣa (a person), and is higher than the Pradhāna or Prakṛti,and capable of being contemplated by the mind alone. (4) Whenpermeated by the will power (Icchāśakti) it forms Śivaliṅga,which is a finite principle with a sense of egoism, possessed ofknowledge and power (Kalā), having a celestial refulgence, withone face, and serene. (5) When perineated with the power ofknowledge (Jñānaśakti) it forms a Guruliṅga, which possessesagency, presides over every system or science that instructs, isfull of light, a boundless ocean of joy, and dwells in human intelligence. (6) When influenced by the power of action.(Kriyāśakti), it is called Ācāraliṅga, which in the shape ofaction serves as the support for the existence of all things, whichis conceivable by the mind, and leads to a life of renunciation.</p>
<p>It will be seen that the original entity becomes divided intoGod and individual soul by its innate power, and the six formsof the first, that are mentioned, are the various ways of lookingat God. The first form is the infinite Being considered independently. The second is the form in which we conceive ofhim as developing or creating by its highest power. The thirdis the form in which he is conceived as distinct from thematerial world. The fourth is a bodily form, the body, however, not being made up of ordinary matter, but celestial like thebody attributed to Nārāyaṇa, or Kṛṣṇa, by the Vaiṣṇavas. Thefifth is the form in which he instructs mankind. And the sixthinvolves the idea of his guiding the individual soul in hisactions until he is delivered. In this form Śiva is the Redeemer.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1. The Sādākhya is the product of the combination of the principle, theŚivaessence, with the two of the five powers, Parāand Ādi. The Sādākhyasarefive (1) Śivasādākhya, which develops into Sadāśiva;(2) Amūrta, or notfinite, which becomes Īśa; (3) Samūrta, or finite, which results in Brahmeśa;(4) Kartṛ, or agent, which becomes Īśvara; (b) Karman, or action, whichdevelops into Īśāna. The Sādākhya alluded to in the test must be Sadāśiva.</p>
<p>Bhakti is the characteristic of the individual souls. It consists in a tendency towards God, and there are three stages inthe progress of this tendency and, corresponding to these, thereare three divisions of the Aṅgasthala, or the subject of the individual soul. The first or highest division is called Yogāṅga, thesecond Bhogāṅga, and the third Tyāgāṅga. By the first, a manobtains happiness by his union with Śiva; by the second, heenjoys along with Śiva; and the last involves the abandonmentof the world as transient or illusory. The first corresponds to theresolution into the cause and to the condition of sound sleep, thesecond to the subtle body and to dreamy sleep, and the third tothe gross body and to the wakeful condition. Two varieties ofeach of these are distinguished. Of the first, or Yogāṅga, wehave the two, Aikya and Śaraṇa. The first consists in sharingthe joys of Śiva after one is convinced of the unreality of thewhole world. This is called SamarasāBhakti, in which Godand the soul are united in blissful experience. The second iscalled Śaraṇabhakti, in which one sees Liṅga, or God, in himselfand everything else. It is a condition of joy for oneself. Thesecond is also of two kinds: (1) Prāṇsliṇgin and (2) Prasādin. Thefirst consists in abandoning all regard for life, renunciation ofegoism, and concentration of the whole mind upon the Liṅga, orGod. The second is realised, when one resigns all the objects ofone&rsquo;s enjoyment to the Liṅga, or God, and serenity (Prasāda) isacquired. The divisions of the last are Mäheśvers and Bhakta.The first is one who has a firm belief in the existence of God, whogoes through the whole discipline consisting in the observance ofvows and restraints, which have Śiva for their object, and truth,morality, cleanliness, etc. and a heroically rigid vow based upona firm belief in the unity of the Liṅga, or God. A Bhakta is one.who, turning his mind away from all objects by which it is attracted and practising devotion and rites, lives a life of indifference to the world¹.</p>
<p>This represents the progress of the soul from indifference tothe world, which is the first step, through the intermediate stages,in a reverse order, to Sāmarasya, or union in blissful experience.with Śiva, which is the highest condition. The goal thus pointedout does not involve a perfect identity between the supreme andindividual souls, or the shaking off of individuality and becoming a simple soul unconscious of itself, which is the doctrine ofthe great non-dualistic school of Śaṁkars.</p>
<p>The belief of the Vīraśaiva school that the original essence ofŚivadivided itself by its own innate power into Liṅga or God,and Aṅga, or the individual soul, and under the influence of otherpowers the essence became the creator of the world, shows that thedoctrine of that school is that the rudiment of the creation existsin God himself in the shape of his power, but this power is notunreal. This doctrine, therefore, resembles that of Rāmānuja, butwith the latter there is a real rudiment of the soul and of the external world characterising God which afterwards develops, butwith the Vīraśaivas there exists a power only in God which leads tocreation; so that it is the power that characterises God accordingto the latter, while the rudiment is his characteristic according tothe former. The Liṅgä</p>
<p>yat school, therefore, is a school of qualified spiritual monism (Viśiṣṭādavaita). It will also have beenseen that the method of redemption taught by this school isthat of Bhakti or love of God, and a course of moral and spiritualdiscipline up to the attainment of Sāmarasya withŚ</p>
<p>iva. In thisrespect also it resembles Rāmānuja&rsquo;s system.</p>
<p>Śrīkaṇthaśivācārya, whose Bhāṣya on the Veāantasūtras haslong been before the public, holds the same view. Under I. 4. 22,he states that the word Ātman in the sense of the individual soulis used to express the supreme soul in BU. (IV. 5. 6), because thelatter is the internal controller of the former and is spoken of asidentical with everything in this sense. Under II. 2. 38, he statesthat Śiva as possessed of powers is the material cause of the world;and in his comment on IV. 4. 3-4, he represents the deliveredsoul as similar to the Supreme Soul, that is, as having the attributes of the latter. And under IV. 4, 2, he speaks of the delivered.soul as Samarasa, or united in blissful experience with the Supreme Soul. Thus Srīkaṇṭha&rsquo;s view appears to be identicalwith that of the Vīraśaivas. Therefore unlike the four older.schools (Pāśupata and others), which are dualistic, these threeŚaiva schools hold a doctrine of qualified spiritual monism.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.The above is an abstract of the matter contained in the Anubhavasūtra of Mayideva, Sholapur, 1909,</p>
<p>§ 104. The highest class of Liṅgāyats is composed of those whocall themselves Liṅgi-Brāhmaṇas, the other castes or classes whowear the Liṅgabeing simply their followers. The Liṅgi-Brāhmaṇas consist of two main classes, the Ācāryasand the Pañcamas.The legendary account given of these is as follows. The Ācāryaswere originally five in number and sprang from the five faces,Sadyojāta, etc., of Śiva spoken of in a former section<sup id="fnref:101"><a href="#fn:101" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">101</a></sup>. They arethe same as those mentioned above as having a metallic vesselplaced in their names on the occasion of any holy ceremony.From these five have sprung up all the priestly classes nowexisting. These five had five Gotras, viz. Vīra, Nandin, Vṛṣabha,Bhṛṅgin, and Skanda, who were originally persons almost as highas Śive himself. From the Īśāna face of Śiva sprang a Gaṇeśvara(leader of a group), who had five faces. From these five faces.sprang five Pañcamas, known by the names of Makhāri, Kālāri,Purāri, Smarāri, and Vedāri, which, the reader will remember,were the names of Śiva himself given to him on account of certaindeeds done by him. From these arose others who are called.Upapañcamas. Each Pañcama has to connect himself with oneof the five Ācāryas as his Guru. The Gotra of the Guru is hisGotra, and there can be no marriage relation between the members of the same Gotra. These Pañcamas have got Gotra, Pravarsand Śākhāof their own, and the Liṅgāyats thus seem to havecopied the Brṅhmanic system. The Pañicamas are spoken of asthe true devotees of Śiva<sup id="fnref:102"><a href="#fn:102" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">102</a></sup>.</p>
<p>According to the ordinary acccunt the true Liṅgāyats aredivided into four classes: (1) Jaṅgamas, or priests, (2) Śīlavants,</p>
<p>or pious, (3) Banjigs, or traders, and (4) Pañcamsālis. The secondand the third classes are based on the occupation or mode of lifefollowed so that even here, there are only the two classes mentioned in the work referred to above. The members of the first orĀcārya class are popularly called Jaṅgamas. Of these there aresome who are called Viraktas (passionless) and who devote themselves to contemplation and other religious exercises and live a lifeof celibacy and asceticism. They maintain a convent (Maṭha)and are adored by all people.</p>
<p>One such convent, which might be called the chief convent, isthat which exists at Chitaldrug in the Mysore territory about ahundred miles from Dharwar. The head monk is held in deepreverence and exercises great influence over the followers of thesect.</p>
<p>The second division of the class comprises those who follow apriestly occupation and conduct all ceremonies. They are marriedmen and lead the life of householders. They exercise religiouscontrol over the Pañcamas and the followers of their sect. Thesepriestly Jaṅgamas are the representatives of one or other of thefive principal establishments located in different parts of thecountry from the Himālaya to the Mysore province. Any knottyquestion concerning the sect is decided by the final orders issuedat one of these establishments. Besides the true Liṅgāyats their isan affiliated class and another composed of half Liṅgāyats. TheLiṅgāyats abstain from meat and drink. Their widows areallowed to marry. And women are not considered polluted anduntouchable during the days of nonthly sickness, as is the case.among Brāhmaṇic Hindus.</p>
<p>$ 105. There is a Dīkṣāceremony among the Vīraśaivas corresponding to Upanayana among the Brāhmaṇas. Instead of theGāyatrīmantra of the latter, they have the Mantra Om namaśŚivāya&rsquo;, and have to wear the Liṅga, or emblem of Śiva, in theplace of Yajñopavīta. On the occasion of the Dīkṣā, the Guruholds a Liṅga in his left hand, worships it in the usual sixteenways, and shows it to the disciple. Then placing it in the lefthand of the disciple and enjolning him to look upon it as his ownsoul and as the highest existing thing and so forth, he ties itround the neck of the disciple with a silken cloth by repeating a</p>
<p>Mantra used by the Brāhmaṇas in putting on the Yajñopavīta,This is called the Liṅgasväyattadīkṣā. This ceremony is performed in the case of girls also, and the women too have to wear theLiṅga like men. The Liṅgais generally put into a box made ofsilver and suspended round the neck. The Vīraśaivas have togo through daily ceremonies similar to the twilight adorations ofthe Brāhmaṇas, and the Mantra repeated on the occasion is thatgiven above, as also the Śiva-Gāyatrī, the first two lines ofwhich are the same as the BrāhmaṇicGāyatrī, and the last is&rsquo;Tan naḥŚvaḥ pracodayāt&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In the marriage ceremony the Mantra to be repeated on theoccasion of the taking hold of the hand of the bride is the sameas among the Brāhmaṇas, and in the ceremony of walking theseven steps together with the bride, the formulas repeated arethe same as those used by Ṛgvedin Brāhmaṇas. But in theirmarriage ceremony, they do not perform the rite of throwingparched rice into the fire as the Brāhmaṇas do. The worship ofthe Liṅga, called Iṣṭa-Liṅga, worn on the body, is their chiefdivine worship; and attendance at temples and worship of theLiṅga therein are by no means necessary for them. They donot concern themselves directly with the public temples of Śiva.</p>
<p>§ 106. There is a traditional legend among the Liṅgāyatsthat, when Śiva brought Brahmadeva into existence, he told himto create the world. But Brahmadeva said that he did not knowhow to do it. Whereupon Śiva created it himself in order that it might serve him as a model. And the Ācāryas and Pañcamas, asdetailed above with their Gotras and Śākhās, are that creation ofŚiva. The true import of this legend is that the Liṅgāyat set upa system for themselves as a rival to the Brāhmaṇic system andthe close resemblance between the two confirms this view. Buta mere copy was not their object, and they introduced severalreforms, especially in the condition of women, as will have beenseen from the above notice. In this respect, this system differsfrom all other schools, Vaiṣṇavs or Śaiva or even Buddhist orJains, who did not set up for themselves a special system ofsocial relations and domestic rites, though, as shown above, thatframed by the Liṅgayats for themselves is a copy of that of theBrāhmaṇas, which, however, is a reformed copy.</p>
<p>The impression that this whole account creates in one is thatLiṅgāyatism owes its origin to a spirit of jealousy of the powerexercised by Brāhmaṇism and of rivalry with the system. Sucha spirit of jealousy and rivalry cannot be expected to have arisenin thoroughly depressed minds. The system therefore must havecome into existence among the spirited members of the upperclasses of non-BrāhmanicHindus under the leadership of a bodyof men composed of Brāhmaṇas known by the name of Ārādhyas.Some of the members of this body did not go far enough in thedesired reform, as mentioned before, and formed a distinct sect¹.</p>
<p>It will thus be seen that all the Liṅgāyats have not sprungup from the Śūdra caste, but there is a mixture of the threehigher orders among them. The claim that the two main classesof the sect put forward of their being Liṅgi-Brāhmaṇas, i, e.,Brāhmaṇas wearing the Liṅgā, seems to be founded on truth.The Ācārya or Jaṅgama class is said to have sprung from thefive holy persons, adored on the occasion of a religious ceremony,whose names end in the suffix ārādhyasignificative of their beingBrāhmaṇas. We might therefore safely take them to be of aBrāhmaṇic descent². As to the Pañcamas, they probably represent the Vaiśya order of the Brāhmaṇicsystem which followedthe occupation of traders and cultivators, and as the Vaiśyasbelong to the class of the twice-born, so also do the Pañcamasand hence they are included in the Liṅgi-Brāhmaṇa group.</p>

<p>1. An Ārādhya sect is mentioned by Anantānandagiri as having come intoconflict with Śaṁkarācārya / SeeŚaṁkarāvljaya, Bibl. Ind., p. 37). In thecorresponding portion of Dhanapati&rsquo;s Dinḍima which accompaniesMādhava&rsquo;s Śaṁkaravijaya the name of the seat does not occur; so that itis questionable whether the Ārādhya seot came into existence beforeŚaṁkara, even if we suppose that the seat mentioned by Anantānandagiriwas the same as the one we have noticed as affiliated to the Liṅgāyats.Or, on the evidence of Anantānandagiri the Ārādhya sect may be considered to have come into existence about the time of Śaṁkarācārya,that is, before the ninth century A. D., and the theory advanced, that theLiṅgāyat reform was carried out within its limits, and a portion of theĀrādhya sect adopted the new creed and developed it, while anotherremained orthodox and staunch to some of the Brāhmaṇicpractices. Tothis portion is to be traced the Ārādhyaseat of the present day.</p>
<p>2. There are Jaṅgamas who know Sanskrit, and I have been in communication with one such of the name of Mallikārjunaśāstrin, who directed me tosome of the books of the seat wich I have followed in this section, and alsogave oral information on some points. He claims to be a Brāhmaṇaauthorised to study the Vedas, his own Vada being the White Yajurveda.</p>
<p><strong>XII. Śaivism in the Draviḍa Country.</strong></p>
<p>§ 107. Śaivism prevails in the Draviḍa or Tamil country,and possesses an extensive literature of its own. It consists ofeleven collections. The first three contain the hymns composedby a saint held in great reverence, of the name Tirun̄ānasambandha. They are three hundred and eighty-four in number,each being called a Padigam, which consists of ten stanzas withan eleventh containing the author&rsquo;s name us ially added. Thenext three were composed by Appar who was an older contemporary of Sambandha, who had renounced Buddhism or ratherJainism and become a Śaiva. The seventh collection belongsto Sundara who was a Brāhmaṇa devotee of a later generation.These seven books are called Devāram and are compared to theBrähmaṇic Veda. In certain processions, while on the one sidethe hymns of the Brähmaṇic Veda are repeated, on the other aresung those contained in the Devaram which are addressed to thedeity. The Tiruvāśagam forms the eighth book, and it resembles.the Upaniṣads. The author of this book is Mānikkavāśagar.The ninth group is made up of hymns composed in imitation ofthe Devāram hymns. One of the writers is Kandarāditya, aCola king, from whom Rājarāja Cola, who came to the throne in984-85 A. D., was fifth in descent. The tenth contains mysticsongs of a Yogin called Tirumular. The eleventh collection iscomposed of miscellaneous pieces, the last ten of which werewritten by Nambi Āndār Nambi. The third of these ten formsthe basis of the Tamil Purāṇa called PeriyaPurāṇa. These elevencollections together with the PeriyaPurāṇa, which are all writtenin the Tamil language, form the sacred literature of the TamilŚaivas. Besides these there are the works of what are called.Santāns-Ācāryas, which are fourteen in number and called.Siddhāntaśāstras. Their contents are of a philosophical nature.</p>

<p>The head monk of the Chitaldrug convent alladed to above was on avisitation to Poons about two months ago with all the state of a spiritualpotentate, having four elephants with him and a number of followers. Hewas a good, courteous and kindly person, bad studied Sanskrit grammarand was able to converse fluently in pure Sanskrit. Some of the books ofthe sect are written in Sanskrit.</p>
<p>The most highly honoured of all these writers is Tiruñānasambandha. He was a Brāhmaṇa by birth, and the poeticfaculty was developed in him very early in life. His hymns arefull of the purest devotional feeling and are melodious. Thetunes in which they were originally sung were Draviḍian, butin later times northern melodies with northern names came to beused. Sambandha&rsquo;s image is set up for worship in every Śaivaltemple, and he is adored by Tamil poets and philosophers in thebeginning of their works. He was a great enemy of Buddhistsand Jainas; and every tenth stanza of his Padigams, or hymns,contains an imprécation against them. On one occasion, he wasinvited by the queen of Kuni Pāṇdya of Madhurā, where he helda disputation with the Buddhists or Jainas, which ended in theconversion of the king to the Saiva faith¹.</p>
<p>In an Inscription in the Rājarājeśvara temple at Tanjore theking Rājarājadeva, after whom the temple was named, makes adaily allowance for the support of the reciters or singers of theTiruppadiyam or the Padigams of Tiruñānasambandba, beforethe twenty-ninth year of his reign². The date of Rājarāja&rsquo;saccession to the throne has been determined by the mention of alunar eclipse in one of his inscriptions to be 984-5 A. D<sup id="fnref:103"><a href="#fn:103" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">103</a></sup>. Thisis consistent with the fact mentioned in another Inscription<sup id="fnref:104"><a href="#fn:104" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">104</a></sup> thathe conquered Satyāśraya, who was the immediate successor ofTailapa, the founder of the later Cālukya dynasty of Mahārāṣṭra,and died in Śaka 930, or 1008 A. D. Thus before the twenty-ninthyear of Rājarāja, i. e. before 1013 A. D., the Padigams of Sambandha had come to be looked upon as so sacred that the recitation or singing of them was considered an act of religious meritlike the repetition of the Śatarudriya by the followers of theBrāhmaṇic Veda. This character the hymns of Sambandhacould not have acquired unless they had come into existenceabout four hundred years before the beginning of the eleventhcentury. This is consistent with the conclusion arrived at byMr. Pillai that Sambandha flourished in the seventh century.</p>

<p>2.South-Indian Inscriptions ed. by E. Hultzsch, Vol. I. p. 252, No. 65.</p>
<p>The Inscriptions in the temples at Kāñcipura contain evidenceof Śaivism being in a flourishing condition in the sixth century.The Pallava king Rājasiṁha constructed a temple, and the godinside was named after him Rājasiṁheśvara. Rājasiṁha appears.from some of the Inscriptions to have been a contemporary of theearly Cālukya prince Pulakeśin I<sup id="fnref:105"><a href="#fn:105" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">105</a></sup>, who may be referred toabout the year 550 A. D., as his son Kīrtivarman I, came to thethrone about the year 567 A. D.².</p>
<p>The Śaivism that prevailed in the Tamil country seems tohave been generally of the ordinary kind, since the hymns in theDevāram sing the praises of Śiva and exhibit forvent devotionalfeeling, but there must have been some Darśana or system ofphilosophy also, since in an Inscription in the Rājasiṁheśvaratemple at Kāñci Atyantakāma, which was another name of Rājasiṁha, is represented as proficient in the system of the Śaivasiddhāntas. And the last species of the Śaiva Iterature detailedabove is, it will have been seen, called Siddhāntaśāstra composedby Santāna-Ācāryas. These must be philosophical works onŚaivism. And the system therein taught appears in all likelihoodto be the same or similar to the Śaivadarśana, which has alreadybeen explained. But what exactly the system taught by theSiddhāntas was, we have not the means of finding out, as none ofthe works is available for examination.</p>
<p>The Periyapurāṇa gives an account of sixty-three Bhaktas ordevotees of Śiva, and these correspond to the Ālvārs of theVaiṣṇavas. The enemies that both these classes of devotees hadto contend with were Jainas, and it appears to me that bothŚaivism and Vaiṣṇavism penetrated to the extreme South ofIndia after the revival of Brāhmaṇism in the North during thefourth and fifth centuries. Buddhism and Jainism had beenintroduced earlier, and were in possession of the field when thetwo later systems of theistic belief were introduced into theSouthern country. Hence arose the necessity of controversiesand contests which these systems carried on with their earlierpredecessors. Whether Śaivism extended itself to the Tamilcountry before the revival, we have not the means of determining.</p>

<p><strong>XIII. The Śāktas or Śakti Worshippers.</strong></p>
<p>§ 108. In the Vedic literature down to the Gṛhyasūtras whichwe have examined for tracing the development of the idea ofRudra-Śiva, no female devotee of predominant power is mentioned.We have such names as Rudrant and Bhavānī, which are simplyderivatives and do not show a belief in the existence of anindependent powerful goddess,Umā, too, is the wife of a godand does not overshadow her male consort. In the MBh,(Bhīṣmaparvan, chap. 23), however, there is a hymn addressedto Durgā by Arjuna under the advice of Kṛṣṇa in which she isprayed to for granting victory in the forthcoming battle. Thisbymn itself shows that at the time when it was composed andinserted in the poem, Durgāhad already acquired such animportance that she was adored by men as a powerful goddess,able to fulfil their desires. Among the names by which she isaddressed occur the following: Kumārī(maiden), Kālī(blackor female time as destroyer), Kāpālī(wearer of skulls), Mahākālī(the great destroyer), Caṇḍī(angry), Kātyayānī (of theKātya family ), Karālā(frightful), Vijayā(Victory), Kauśikī(of the Kusika family ), Umā, Kāntāravāsinī(dwelling in theforest). There is another hymn in the Vīrāṭaparvan (chap. 6)sung by Yudhiṣṭhira. It does not exist in the principal SouthernMSS., and is probably an interpolation, as it contains almost thesame matter as in a similar passage in the Harivaṁsa. Thepoints and epithets in this hymn which deserve notice are these.She is called Mahiṣāsuranāśinī(or the destroyer of the demonin the shape of a buffalo) and she is fond of wine, flesh and beasts.She was born to Yaśodā and dashed against a stone, whereupon</p>
<p>she went to heaven. She is called the most beloved of Nārāyaṇaand the sister of Vāsudeva. She resides permanently on theVindhya mountain.</p>
<p>It is related in the Harivaṁśa (vv. 3236 ff.) that Viṣṇudescended into the Pātāla, and asked sleep in the form of destroying time (NidrāKālarūpiṇī) to become the daughter ofYaśodā. She is told that she would become Kauśikīand wouldhave a permanent residence on the Vindhya mountain. There shewas told that she would kill Śumbha and Niśumbha and wouldbe worshipped by animal sacrifices. There is given a hymn toĀpyā(Durgā) in which she is represented as the goddess ofŚabaras, Pulindas, Barbaras and other wild tribes, and as fond ofwine and flesh.</p>
<p>The goddess that killed the buffalo-demon, was, according tothe Mārkaṇḍeya-Purāṇa (ch. 82) made up of the fierce radianceof Śiva, viṣṇu and Brahmadeva, and all the other gods contributed to the formation of her limbs as well as her ornaments.She is called Caṇḍīand AmbikāThe formation of the goddessthat killed Śumbha and Niśumbha, according to the account.which follows, is thus explained. The gods being oppressed bythe demons Śumbha and Niśumbha went to the Himālayas andpraised the goddess, whereupon Pārvatīcame out to bathe in theGanges. Then Śivā, also called Ambikā, came out of the body ofPārvatī, and said that it was she whom the gods were praising toinduce her to kill Śumbha and Niśumbha, She was calledKāuśikī, because she sprang out from Kośaor frame of Pārvatī&rsquo;sbody. When Ambikācame out of her body, Pārvatī&rsquo;s complexion became dark, and hence she received the name of Kālikā(darkone). In the course of the fight, when Śumbha and Niśumbhapounced upon her, her forehead became dark with anger, andfrom it came Kālīwith a frightful face wearing a garland ofskulls and a tiger-skin and with an infernal weapon (Khaṭvīṅga)in her hand. She killed the demons Caṇḍa and Muṇḍa, and wentback to Ambikā, who thereupon, since she had killed thosedemons, gave her the name Cāmuṇḍā. The seven Śaktis, Brāhmī,Māheśvarī, Kaumārī, Vaiṣṇavī, Varahī, Narasiṁhi and Aindrī, which are the powers or spirits of the gods from whom their</p>
<p>names are derived, are called her excellent forms (Vibhūtis).At the end, the goddess says that she would, in the VaivasvataManu, destroy Śumbha and Niśumbha again by assuming theform of the goddess residing on the Vindhya mountain, and proceeds to give the other forms that she would assume on otheroccasions such as the daughter of Nanda, Śākambharī, Bhīmā,Bhrāmarī, etc.</p>
<p>§ 109. In the account bere given, it will be seen that there isone goddess with a number of different names. But the criticaleye will see that they are not merely names, but indicate differentgoddesses who owed their conception to different historical conditions, but who were afterwards indentified with the one goddessby the usual mental habit of the Hindus. First we have Umā,the protectress, the consort of Śiva. Then we have Haimavatīand Pārvatīwhich are the epithets of Umā, since Siva, herconsort, was Giriśa, or dweller on the mountain, and she was awoman born on the mountain.</p>
<p>Then there are goddesses, dwelling in forests and on theVindhiya mountain, to whom animals and even human beings weresacrificed, and oblations of wine were given and who were alsothe goddesses worshipped by the wild tribes, such as Pulindas,Śabaras and Barbaras. These were fierce goddesses and have thenames of Karālā, Kālī, Caṇḍī, Cāmuṇḍā, and others. It must beadmitted, however, that the first two names came into use whenin an early age Rudra was identified with Agni, whose flames,which were considered his tongues, have those two names andfive others. Probably the ferocity of the later goddesses of thosenames was due to this identification and not to their being theobjects of worship to the ferocicus barbarous tribes. In all likelihood, however, both the elements contributed to give thatcharacter to Kālī, Karālāand Cāmuṇḍā. That an aboriginalelement should have contributed to the formation of Rudra&rsquo;sconsort in later times, as it did in earlier times, towards theformation of Rudra himself as he is represented in the Śatarudriya, is a matter that might be expected.</p>
<p>A third and powerful element in the conception of thesegoddesses is that of Śakti, or power. The powers of willing, acting,</p>
<p>creating, illuding, etc. were conceived of as goddesses as thenoun Śakti is of the feminine gender. The seven goddessesnamed above, Brāhmī, Maheśvarī, eto. owe their origin to thisconception of Śakti and the powers of the seven gods. In latertimes some of the Brāhmaṇic families came to have tutelarygoddesses, and thus we have Kātyayānī, or the goddess of theKātyas, and Kauśikī, the goddess of the Kauśikas. A furtherdevelopment went on especially under the influence of the idea ofŚakti, or power, and thus we have three forms in which thegoddess was worshipped. First we have the ordinary bland.form, in which the goddess is worshipped. Then we have thefierce form, in which she is associated with the schools ofKāpālikas and Kālāmukhas, and animals and human beings aresacrificed. And the third is the sensual form, in which she isthe object of worship with the school of the Sāktas, who are socalled because they are worshippers of Śakti.</p>
<p>§ 110. The Tantras inculcating the worship of the goddess inthese various forms, constitute a considerable body of literature.We will here notice the formation, doctrines and practices of aschool based on one of these forms, that which we have calledsensual. The goddess here is called Ānandabhairavī, Tripurasundarī, and Lalitā. Her dwelling is thus described. There isan ocean of nectar, in which there are five celestial trees. Thenthere is a row or enclosure of Nīpa or Kadamba trees, in themidst of which is a pavilion made of jewel stones. In thatpavilion is situated a palace made of the wish-giving stone,where lies the great Īśānī, the great Tripurasundarī, on a couch,which is Śiva, with Maheśana for its coverlet and Sadaśiva forits pillow. The legs of the couch are Brahmadeva, Hari, Rudraand Īśvara. These are spirits discharging certain functions contsined in the essence of Maheśvara¹. This is a mythologicalexplanation of certain figures in the mystic cirles and of technical terms. The goddess is thus elevated to the highest position.Ānandabhairava or Mahābhairava, which is the name given toŚiva, is the soul of, or is composed of, the nine collections ofthings of which the world is made up, such as time and itsvarious forms (Kālavyūha), existing things like the blue substance (Kulavyūha), names (Nāmavyūha), perception (Jñāvyūha), the five faculties, viz. consciousness, heart, will, intelligence, and mind (Cittavyūha). Mahābhairava is the soul of thegoddess; therefore she also is the soul of, or composed of, thenine collections. Buth, therefore, constitute one entity. Whenthere is Sāmarasya, or community of joy or intonse love betweenthem, creation follows. The female olement, or Mahābhairavī,however, is predominant in the process of creation and the maleelement, or Mahābhairava, in the work of destruction<sup id="fnref:106"><a href="#fn:106" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">106</a></sup>.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.Saundaryalaharīwith Lakṣmīdhara&rsquo;s commentary, Mysore Ed, comment. on vv. 8 and 92.</p>
<p>The metaphysical doctrines of what is called Śāmbhavadarśana, on which the usual practices and rites of the Śaktasprofess to be based, are these². Śiva and Śakti are the primordialsubstances. Śiva in the form of Prakāśa (light) enters intoŚakti in the form of Vimarśa or Sphūrti (feeling or appearance)and assumes the form of a Bindu (drop); and Śakti similarlyenters into Śiva, whereupon the Bindu develops, and there arisesout of it the female element called Nāda (sound). These two,the Bindu and the Nada, becoming united, form one compoundBindu, and that substance represents the intense affinity betweenthe female and male energies and is called Kāma (love). Again,there are two drops, one of which is white and represents themale element, and the other, red, which represents the femaleelement. These form the Kalā; these three again, the compoundBindu, and the white and red drops form one substance called.Kāmakalā. Thus there are four powers united here: (1) theoriginal Bindu representing the material of which the world ismade; (2) Nāda, or sound, upon which depends the naming ofthe substances, arising from the development of the Bindu.Between these two there is intense love, but no creation followssimply from it. They only contain the materials of things andspeech Therefore a productive energy is associated with themby (3) the white male drop which, however, by itself cannctproduce, and by (4) the female red drop which is fecundated bythe male drop.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>2. The following contains in a recast form the matter given in pp. 89-91 ofmy Report on the Search for Sanskrit Manuscripts during 1883-84[Volume II of this Edition, pp. 219-223 N. B. U.]</p>
<p>When all these four principles unite into one substarce,Kāmakalā, the whole creation of words and the things expressedby them (Vāgarthau), proceeds. Another substance called theHārdhakalā is also developed, according to some, along with theNāda, when the female element first enters into the simple Bindu.In a certain text the highest deity, or Kāmakalā is spoken of ashaving the sun (compound Bindu) for her face, fire and moon(the red and white Bindus) for her breasts, and the Hārdhakalā for her organ of generation. This view provides a wombfrom which creation springs out. The creative agent, therefore,is a goddess thus constituted, and she is the highest deity and iscalled Parā, Lalitā, Bhaṭṭārikā and Tripurasundarī. Śiva issymbolically identified with the letter a and Śakti with <em>h,</em> thelast letter of the Sanskrit alphabet. This is called Ardhakalā,or half part, and hence the female element, or womb, mentionedabove is called the half part in the shape of the letter <em>A</em>. This<em>h</em>, or the half part, together with a which stands for Śiva is asymbolic representation of Kāmakalā or Tripurasundarī, who isthe result of the combination of Śiva and Śakti. She is thuscalled Aham, the ego, and is invested with egoism or individuality, and hence it is that all her developments (i. e. the wholecreation) have egoism or individuality; and all souls are butforms of Tripurasundarīand become Tripurasundarīwhen theystudy and practise the Kāmakalāvidyāwith its series of Devīcakras, or mystic circles. <em>A</em> and <em>h</em>, being the first and lastletters of the alphabet, contain between them all letters andthrough them all words, i. e. the whole speech; and just as allthings are produced from Tripurasundarī, so are all words whichexpress the things. She is thus called Parā, the first of the fourkinds of speech. Creation is Pariṇāma, or development, and not Vivarts, or the generation of false appearances. This is thephilosophy of the Śāmbhavadarśana, and it will be seen that,though it admits a male element in the beginning, still it isthoroughly subdued by the female element which becomes predominant; and the highest deity is a goddess, viz. Tripurasundarī.The ambition of every pious follower of the system is to becomeidentical with Tripurasundarī, and one of his religious exercisesis to habituate himself to think that he is a woman. Thus the</p>
<p>followers of the Śakti school justify their appellation by thebelief that God is a woman and it ought to be the aim of all tobecome a woman.</p>
<p>Tripurasundarīis propitiated and eventually attained byassuming the vow (Dīksā) of a devoted worship of her. Thisvow is of three kinds. The first consists in fully concentratingthe mind on the Devī as sitting on the lap of Siva in the Mahāpadmavana (a garden of lotuses), as possessed of a body whichis pure joy and is the original cause of all, and as identical withone&rsquo;s own self. The second is the Cakrapūjā, the worship bymeans of the mystic circles, which is a Bāhyayāga, or materialworship and the third consists in studying and knowing thetrue doctrine. The second is the proper Śakti ceremonial. Itconsists in the worship of a picture of the female organ drawnin the centre of another consisting of a representation of ninesuch organs, the whole of which forms the Śrīcakra The picturesare drawn on a Bhūrja leaf or a piece of silken cloth or on a gold.leaf<sup id="fnref:107"><a href="#fn:107" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">107</a></sup>. With reference to this worship it must be observed thatthere are two classes of Śāktas: (1) Kaulika and (2) Samayin.The former worship the gross material object, while the latterhave a recourse to imagery. The worship of the pictures justmentioned is resorted to by ancient (Pūrva) Kaulas, while themodern (Uttara) Kaulas worship the organ of a living beautifulwoman. The Kaulas worship their goddess by offering to her,and themselves using, wine, flesh, honey (Madhu ), fish and suchother things. Tke Samayins, of course, abstain from suchpractices. There are even Brāhmaṇas, who secretly profess thedoctrines of the Sakta school and worship the goddess Tripurasundarīin accordance with the Pūrva-Kaula or Uttara-Kaula.way. There are no distinctions of caste when the worship of theBhairavīcakra is going on. Men of all castes become Brāhmaṇas,but they resume their own castes when the worship is over<sup id="fnref:108"><a href="#fn:108" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">108</a></sup>.There are several more innocent and decorous modes of worshipping the goddess under the names of Lalits and Upāṅgalalitāmentioned in the ordinary religious books. The worshipof the latter comes off on the fifth lunar day of Āśvina and of</p>
<p>the former for the first ten days. The latter, when so worshippedby women, wards off widowhood<sup id="fnref:109"><a href="#fn:109" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">109</a></sup>.</p>
<p><strong>XIV. The Sect of Gāṇapatyas.</strong></p>
<p>§ 111. Rudra had his hosts of Maruts, who were called hisGaṇas, and the leader of these Gaṇas was Gaṇspati. The nameRudra, as we have seen, was generalised and signified a numberof spirits partaking of the character of the original Rudra; and sowas the name Gaṇspati generalised and meant many leaders ofthe Gaṇas or groups. Another name, Vināyaka, denoting a spiritalso came into use. In the AU. Rudra is identified with manygods or spirits, and among these there is one called Vināyaka.In the MBh. (Anuśāsanaparvan 151, v. 26) Gaṇeśvaras andVināyakas are mentioned amongst the gods, who observe theactions of men and are present everywhere; and again, (v. 57)Vināyakas are said to remove all evil from men when praised.Gaṇeśvaras, or Gaṇspatis, and Vināyakas are here represented,as the former are in the Śatarudriya, many in number andpresent everywhere.</p>
<p>In the Mānavagṛhyasūtra (2. 14) is given an account ofVināyakas. They are four in number. And their names are(1) Śalakaṭaṅkaṭa, (2) Kūṣmāṇḍarājaputra, (3) Usmita, and (4)Devayajana. When possessed by these a person pounds sods of earth, cuts grass, and writes on his body, and sees in dreams.waters, men with shaved heads, camels, pigs, asses, etc., and feelshe is moving in the air, and when walking, sees somebody pursuing him from behind. Again, when possessed by these, PrincesRoyal do not obtain the kingdom, though qualified to govern.Girls do not obtain bridegrooms, though possessed of thenecessary qualities. Women do not get children, even if otherwise qualified. The children of other women die. A learnedteacher qualified to teach does not obtain pupils, and there aremany interruptions and breaks in the course of student. Tradeand agriculture are unsuccessful.signs of being possessed by Vināyaka, is made to go through theA person, who shows suchceremony of bathing in waters brought from four places andwith a little earth from four different quarters thrown into them.</p>
<p>After bathing oblations of mustard oil extracted afresh should beoffered to the four Vināyakas in a ladle made of the wood of theUdumbara tree and poured over the head of the individual.Then food of many sorts, rice, husked and unhusked, flesh, andfish, cooked as well as raw, pulse of various kinds, etc. should beput into a basket and the basket placed on the ground where fourroads meet, the ground first being covered with Kuśagrass.Then certain deities including evil spirits are invoked, and awish expressed that they may be satisfied, and, becoming so,satisfy the worshipper, etc. This is the ceremony which freesthe persons haunted by the Vināyakas.</p>
<p>Yajñavalkya in his Smṛti (I. 271ff.) gives the same ceremonyBut the ceremony appearsand frequently in the same words.He beginsin a somewhat more developed or complicated formby stating that Rudra and Brahmadeva appointed Vināyaka tothe leadership of the Gaṇas, (i. e. made him Gaṇapati), andassigned to him the functions of raising difficulties and obstructions in the actions of men. In the Smṛti, one Vināyaka is onlyaddressed, but instead of the four names occurring in the Sūtra,six are given, viz. (1) Mita, (2) Sammita, (3) Śāla, (4) Kaṭaṅkaṭa,(5) Kūṣmāṇḍsa, and (6) Rajāputra, and these are said to be sixdifferent names of the one Vināyaka. After the basket withvarious kinds of food has been prepared, directions are given tomake an obeisance to Ambikā, the mother of Vināyaka.</p>
<p>The form of the ceremony contained in the Sūtra is unquestionably more ancient than that contained in the other work.But the difference between the two shows that during the periodthat had elapsed between the composition of the Sūtra and that ofthe Smṛti, the four Vināyakas had become one Gaṇapati-Vināyaka,having Ambikāfor his mother. It will thus be seen that, in hisown nature, this last god is an unfriendly or malignant spirit,but capable of being made friendly and benignant by propitiatoryrites. In this respect, he resembles Rudra himself. That theVināyakas had come to be objects of faith before the Christianera, may be taken to follow from the occurrence of the ceremonymentioned above in a Gṛhyasūtra. But the one Gaṇapati-Vināyaka, the son of Ambikā, was introduced into the Hindu pantheonmuch later.</p>
<p>None of the Gupta Inscriptions which I subjected to anexamination on a former occasion¹ contains any mention of hisname or announces any gift or benefaction in his honour. Butin two of the caves at Ellora, there are groups of images of Kāla, Kālī, the Seven Mothers or Śaktis, and Gaṇapati². These cavesare to be referred to the latter part of the eighth century. So thatbetween the end of the fifth and the end of the eighth centurythe Gaṇapati cult must have come into practice, and the Smṛtiof Yajñavalkya. must have been written not earlier than thesixth century. Another Inscription, and an old relic, whichindicate the prevalence of the worship of Gaṇapati, are found ata place called Ghaṭiyālā, 22 miles north-west of Jodhpur. Thereis a column there, on the top of which there are four images ofGaṇapati facing the four quarters. In the opening sentence ofthe Inscription engraved on it, an obeisance is made to Vināyaka.The date of the inscription is Vikrama-Saṁvat 918 = A. D. 862<sup id="fnref:110"><a href="#fn:110" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">110</a></sup>.</p>
<p>When and how the god came to have the elephant&rsquo;s head, it isdifficult to determine. The images in the cave-temples at Ellorahave that head, and Bhavabhūti also in the beginning of theeighth century describes him, in the opening stanza of theMālatīmādhava, as possessed of such a head. Rudra-Śiva andthe gods allied with him were connected closely with forests andwild places, in which elephants also were found. The hide wornby Rudra and by his consort also in one of her forms was thehide of an elephant, and it perhaps suited the fancy of some mento place the head of that animal over the body of a god originallymischievous. Gaṇapati&rsquo;s reputation for wisdom is, I believe, tobe attributed to the confusion between him and Bṛhaspati, whoin ṚV. II. 23. 1 is called Gaṇapati. Bṛhaspati, of course, is theVedic god of wisdom, and is called the sage of sages.</p>
<p>§ 112. Six varieties of the Gāṇapatya sect are mentioned byĀnandagiri, or Anantānandagiri as he is sometimes called, in hisŚaṁkardigvijaya as well as by Dhanapati in his commentary onthe corresponding work of Mādhava. The first consists of thosewho adore Mahāgaṇapati. Mahāgaṇapati is, according to them,the creator, and he alone remains when Brahmadeva and othershave been destroyed at the time of the dissolution. He should bemeditated upon as possessed of his peculiar face with one toothand as embraced by the Śakti. By his own wonderful power, hecreates Brahmadeva and others. One, who repeats the original.Mantra and meditates on this Gaṇapati, attains supreme bliss.The name of the person who expounds these doctrines to theĀcārya is given as Girijāsuta.</p>

<p>Another interlocutor follows. His name is Gaṇapatikumāra,and he adores Haridrāgaṇapati. He takes his stand on ṚV. II.23. 1, and makes out this text to mean &ldquo;We meditate on theewho art the leader of the group of Rudra, Viṣṇu, Brahman, Indraand others, and art the instructor of sages Bhṛgu, Guru, Seśa and others, the highest of all who know the sciences, the greatestlord of the Brahmans engaged in the creation of the world, i. e.adored by Brahman and others in the work of creation andothers&rdquo;. He should be worshipped and meditated on as being dressed in a yellow silken garment, bearing a yellow sacredthread, having four arms, three eyes and his face suffused overby turmeric ointment, and holding a noose and an elephant-goodand a staff in his hand. He who worships the god in this form,obtains emancipation Ganapati is the cause of the whole world,and Brahmāand others are his parts. The worshipper of thisGaṇapati should bear, on buth of his arms, the marks of Gaṇapati&rsquo;s face and one tooth impressed upon them by a heated ironstamp.</p>
<p>Then came Herambasuta, who was the worshipper of Ucchiṣṭagaṇapati. The followers of this variety resort to the left-handedpath (Vāmamārga), which probably was set up in imitation ofthe Kaula worship of Śakti. The form of Gaṇapati meditated.on is very obscene. There is no distinction of caste among thefollowers of this sect. No restriction is to be observed, such asmarriage imposes, and promiscuous intercourse is allowed andalso the use of wine. The follower should have a red mark onhis forehead. All the ordinary ceremonies, such as twilightadorations (Saṁdhyāvandana), are left to a man&rsquo;s own will.</p>
<p>The followers of the other three Gaṇapatis, Navanīta, Svarṇa,and Saṁtāna, worship their god, they say, according to the Sruti.But since Gaṇapati is adored in the beginning of every religiousact, he is the chief god and all the other gods are parts of himand should be worshipped as such. They regard the whole worldas Gaṇapati and adore him as such.</p>
<p>Since the god Gaṇapati-Vināyaka was introduced about thesixth century, it is questionable whether these several sectsexisted at the time of Saṁkarācārya. The imprinting of the faceand the tooth of the god on the arms was a custom common tothem with the Mādhva Vaiṣṇavas, though it is hardly indicativeof the period in which the sect arose. But the worship of Gaṇapati without reference to any particular sect is practised bynearly all Hindus at the beginning of any religious ceremonyand on special occasions. His image made of clay is worshippedwith great pomp in the Maratha country on the fourth lunar dayof the month of Bhādrapada (September), and at Chinchwad nearPoona there is a special establishment for the exclusive worshipof that god.</p>
<p><strong>XV. Skanda or Kārttikeya.</strong></p>
<p>** **§ 113. Another god whose worship was extensively practisedin ancient times, but is now rare, is Skanda or Kārttikeya. Thegeneral belief is that he was the son of Śiva and Pārvatī. Butin the Rāmāyaṇa he is represented as the son of the god of fireand Gaṅgā(I. chap 37). The foetus was thrown by Gaṅgāon the Himavat mountain, and it was nourished by the sixstars constituting the constellation of Kṛttikā (Pleiades), andwas thus called the son of the Kritikās or Kārttikeya. Inthe MBh. (Vanaparvan, chap. 229) also he is represented as theson of Fire, but the mother was Agni&rsquo;s true wife Svāhā, who hadassumed the forms of the wives of six Ṛṣis, whom Agni loved.But here he is called the son of Śiva also, as Agni is a form ofthat god. There are other stories connecting him with Śiva andPārvatī as his parents. But whatever the legend may have beenthere is no question that he was connected with Śiva, and wasthe leader of one of his Gaṇas. There is a Liṅgāyat traditionreported in the section on that sect<sup id="fnref:111"><a href="#fn:111" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">111</a></sup>that he was a founder of a</p>
<p>Gotra, and was a form of Śiva himself. His having the peacockfor his vehicle is also consistent with his connection with Śiva,as peacocks are found in forests of which Rudra and hisattendants were gods. His being the leader of the army of the gods was an idea probably suggested by his being the leader of aGaṇa of Rudra. And in historical times he has been associatedwith Śiva. Under P. V. 3. 99, Patañjali mentions the images ofŚiva, Skanda and Viśakha as being worshipped in his time. Onthe reverse of the coins of the Kuṣana prince Kaniṣka, there arefigures with their names in Greek letters of Skando, Mahaseno,Komaro and Bizago<sup id="fnref:112"><a href="#fn:112" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">112</a></sup>.The first is Skanda, and because he wasthe commander of the army of the gods, he was also called.The third isMahāsena, which is the second name on the coin.Kumāra, which is also a name of Skanda, and the fourth is theSkr. Viśākha. If the first three were the names of one deity only,there was no necessity for giving three names and three figures.These, therefore, must have been regarded as three different godsas Viśākha undoubtedly was from his being mentioned separatelyfrom Skanda by Patañjali. In the story in the MBh. referred toabove Viśākha is mentioned as having arisen from the right sideof Skanda when it was struck by Indra&rsquo;s thunderbolt. This isindicative of the tendency to make the two as one person; andthey appear to have been so made in later times. Or, looking tothe fact that there are two names of Buddha on the coins, the above three may have been the names of one single deity. There arealso three indications of the prevalence of the worship of Skandaor Māhasena in the early centuries. In the year 414 A. D. wasbuilt a Pratolt, or gallery, in the temple of Svāmi-Mahāsena byone Dhruvaśarman at Bilsād<sup id="fnref:113"><a href="#fn:113" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">113</a></sup>. Several holy observances and vows in the name of Kumāra and Kārttikeya are mentioned inHemādri&rsquo;s Vratakhaṇḍa, and the worship of that god has notbecome obsolete even at the present day.</p>
<p><strong>XVI. The Sect of Sauras and the Northern Sun-Worship.</strong></p>
<p>§ 114. Sūrya, or the sun as the orb that is seen in the skyand not as an imaginary god of light, was a Vedic deity. It is</p>
<p>but reasonable to expect that the worship of such a deity shouldnot become obsolete in later times, since the orb of the sun isdaily seen in the sky. In two passages in ṚV. (VII. 60. 1; 62.2)the singer wishes the rising sun to declare him sinless to Mitra,Varuṇa, and other gods. This idea probably arose from the factthat the rising sun by his bright light discloses everything thathas been done in the darkness of the previous night, and thenceit developed into a belief that the sun destroys sins. Kauṣītakiis represented to have adored the sun in the morning, at midday,and in the evening, and having made offerings of water withflowers, sandal, etc. or without (Arghya), prayed for the removalof his sins (KBU. II. 7). And this is what we do or are expectedto do in our twilight and midday adorations.</p>
<p>Water is sipped by repenting a formula expressive of a wishthat the Sun, Manyu and Manyupati may protect the adorer fromsins (AG. Pariśiṣṭa I. 3, and TA. X. 25. 1). After that, three offeringsof water with or without the other ingredients are made to the sunafter repeating the Gāyatrī, and then the water is whirled roundhis head by the adorer by repeating the Mantra &ldquo;That Āditya isBrahman<sup id="fnref:114"><a href="#fn:114" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">114</a></sup>&rdquo; Āśvalāyana directs that, while adoring the morningtwilight, one facing the east should repeat the Gāyatrī-Mantratill the whole disc of the sun has risen, and in the evening withhis face towards the west till the whole has gone down and thestars have begun to appear (AG. III. 7. 4—6).</p>
<p>In the Upanayana ceremony, when the boy is invested withthe sacred thread and other badges of a student&rsquo;s life, he is madeto look at the orb of the sun, when the preceptor, addressing thatdeity, prays &ldquo;Oh god Savitar, this is thy student, protect him.May he not die &quot; (AG. I. 20. 6). Khādira prescribes the adoration of the sun for the enjoyment of riches and for the attainmentof fame (Khādiragṛhyasūtra IV. 1. 14 and 23). The hymnaddressed by Yudhiṣṭhira to the sun after he entered his forestresidence, and his having obtained a vessel from him for theproduction of all the food wanted by him, his family andfollowers, are well-known.</p>
<p>In the seventh century Mayūra, who lived at the court of</p>
<p>Harṣavardhana, composed a hundred stanzas to obtain relieffrom the white leprosy from which he suffered. About the beginning of the eighth century Bhavabhūti makes the Sūtradhāra,or the manager, of the Mālatīmādhava offer prayers to the risingsun to remove all his sins and bestow holy blessings on him.</p>
<p>Thus the sun has been adored since the Vedic times for theremoval of sins, and the bestowal of riches, food, fame, health,and other blessings. At the present day twelve prostrations aremade to Sūrya by repeating twelve of his nemes, all of whichhave a Sanskrit etymology, and there is no foreign look aboutthem. There is also a more elaborate set of such prostrations.</p>
<p>§ 115. It cannot but be expected, therefore, that a schoolshould come into existence for the exclusive worship of the sun.And such a school is that of the Sauras. Ānandagiri bringsŚaṁkarainto contact with the followers of this sect at a place inthe south called Subrahmaṇya situated at the distance of fourteendays&rsquo; journey from Anantaśayana or Trivendram. The name oftheir leader was Divākara, and they wore a circular spot of redsandal on the forehead and bore red flowers. The substance ofthe account of this school given by Divākara is as follows:—</p>
<p>The Supreme Soul, the Sun, is the author of the world. Heis the tutelary deity of the Sauras and is adored by them. TheŚrutis themselves speak of him as the cause of the world, suchas &ldquo;the sun is the soul of moveable and immoveable things&rdquo;(RV. I. 115. 1) and &ldquo;That Āditya is Brahman&rdquo;. Brahman withwhich the sun has thus been identified is the cause of the wholeworld, according to the text, from which all these beings originate,etc. (TU. III. 1. 1.). There is also a Smṛti text in favour of thisdoctrine. There are six classes of devotees of the sun all bearinga mark made by red sandal, wearing a garland of red flowers,and repeating the formula of eight syllables. Some worship theorb of the sun who has just risen as Brahmadeva, the creator,others, the sun on the meridian as Īśvara, the destroyer. He is alsoregarded as the originator. Some regard the setting sun as Viṣṇu,the protector, and, considering him as the cause of the creation.and destruction also and as the highest entity, worship him. Thereare some who resort to all the three suns as a triple form. Others,observing the vow of regularly seeing the orb, adore the Supreme. Soul as existing in it with golden whiskers and golden hair. Onesection of this class is devoted simply to the vow of the observation of the disc, and they see the orb, worship it in the sixteenways, dedicate all their actions to the god, and do not eat with.out seeing the orb. The devotees of the sixth class imprint theorb on their forehead, arms and busom with a heated iron pieceand meditate on the god in their minds continuously. All thesesix classes have to repeat the same Mantra, or formula, of eightsyllables. The followers of this creed like other sectarians interpret various Vedic texts as setting forth the greatness and thesupremacy of their own god. The Puruṣasūkta (ṚV. X. 90) andthe Śatarudriya are so expounded, and the conclusion is that allwho desire emancipation should adore the sun, should bear hismarks on the body, and mutter the Mantra.</p>
<p>§ 116. So far there is no trace of foreign influence in thedevelopment of the Saura system. But such an influence undoubtedly contributed to the growth of the sun-worship prevalentin Northern India from the early centuries of the Christian era.Varāhamihira in the stanza twice quoted before (Bṛhatsaṁhitā,chap. 60, 19) tells us that the installation and consecration of theimages and temples of the sun should be caused to be made bythe Magas, and generally those who worship a certain deityaccording to their special ritual should be made to perform theceremony concerning that deity. This shows that the Magaswere, according to Varāhamihira, the special priests of the sungod. There is a legend concerning this matter in the Bhavisyapurāṇa (chap. 139). Sämba, the son of Kṛṣṇa by Jāmbavati, constructed a temple of the sun on the banks of the Candrabhāgā,the modern Chenab in the Punjab, and no local Brāhmaṇa wouldaccept the office of a regular priest of the temple. He thereuponasked Gauramukha, the priest of Ugrasena. He told him to getMagas, who were special sun-worshippers, from Śakadvīpa. Thenis given the history of the Magas. Sujihva was a Brāhmaṇa ofthe Mihira Gotra. He had a daughter of the name of Nikṣubhā,with whom the sun fell in love. The son of these two was calledJaraśabda or Jaraśasta, and from him sprang all Magas. Theywore a girdle round their waist, which was called Avyaṅga.Thereupon Sāmbā went on the back of Garuḍa, his father&rsquo;s</p>
<p>vehicle, to Śākadvīpa, brought some Magas from it and installedthem into the office of priests of the temple he had constructed.</p>
<p>The Magas have long been known in the literary history ofIndia. There is an Inscription at Govindapur in the GayāDistrict duted Śaka 1059, corresponding to 1137-38 A. D., in theopening stanza of which the Magas, who sprang from the sun,are represented to have been brought into the country by Sāmba.Six great poets, the works of some of whom are extant, are alsomentioned. There are traces of the Magas elsewhere, and there.Are Brāhmaṇas of that name in Rajputana and some otherprovinces of Northern India.</p>
<p>Now these Magas are the Magi of ancient Persia, and thename Jaraśasta mentioned above as occurring in the Bhaviṣyapurāṇaconnects them with the Avesta prophet Zarathushtra.The Avyaṅga, which according to the Purans they wore roundtheir waist, was the same as the Aivyāonghen of the Avestalanguage, which last signifies the Kusti worn by the Parsees atthe present day. Albērūnī, speaking of the Persian priestsMagians, says that they existed in India and were called Magas<sup id="fnref:115"><a href="#fn:115" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">115</a></sup>.The idea of locating them on a continent called Śākadvīpamusthave arisen from the fact that they were foreigners like theŚakas, with whom the Indians had been familiar since thesecond or third century before the Christian era.</p>
<p>Evidently then the worship of the sun or Mihira-worship wasbrought into India by the old Persian priests Magi, but at whoseinstance and under what circumstances they came it is difficultto say. The legendary tradition of their having been brought bySāmba was current in the first half of the twelfth century, as wehave seen from the Inscription. The temple on the Candrabhāgāreferred to above was that which existed at Multan, and a glowingdescription of which is given by the Chinese traveller HiuenTsiang. Four centuries later it was seen by Albērūnī<sup id="fnref:116"><a href="#fn:116" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">116</a></sup>. Itexisted till the seventeenth century, when it was finally destroyedby Auranzeb. Multan is the same as the Sanskrit Mūlasthāna,and this name may have been given to the place, because the</p>
<p>new worship of the sun was first organised there and it was itsoriginal seat.</p>
<p>On the coins of Kaniṣka there occurs a figure with the nameMiiro = Mihira by its side. Mihirais the Sanskritised form ofthe Persian Mihr, which is a corruption of Mithra, the Avesticform of the Vedic Mitra. The cult of Mihr had originated inPersia, and it extended itself up to Asia Minor and even Rome,and the proselytising energy which characterised its firstadherents must have led to its extension towards the east also,and of this extension the figure of Mihira on Kaniṣka&rsquo;s coin is anevidence. The cult, therefore, must have penetrated to Indiaabout the time of that Kuṣana prince, and the Multan temple.which was its original seat must have beeu constructed aboutthe same time.</p>
<p>An Inscription at Mandasaur records the construction of atemple to the sun in the year 437 A. D. by a guild of weavers, andits repair in the year 473 A. D. Another on a copperplate foundat Indore in the Bulandsbahar District in the United Provincesmentions an endowment of Devaviṣṇu in 464 A. D. for lightinga lamp in a temple of the sun. And in a third is recorded agrant in 511 A. D. to a temple of Āditya, or the sun. A greatmany more sun temples have been discovered especially inWestern India from Multan down to Cutch and northern Gujarat¹.The ruins of one exist at Moḍherā, eighteen miles to the south ofPāṭaṇ in the last-named province, and they contain the dateVikrama 1083 corresponding to 1027 A. D. There was anotherat Gwalior constructed in the time of Mihirakula, the HūṇaPrince, in the beginning of the sixth century.</p>
<p>The form of the idol of the sun worshipped in such temples isdescribed by Varāhamihira (Bṛhatsaṁhitā, chap. 58), but thefeatures mentioned by him which have a significance for ourpresent purpose are that his feet and legs should be enclosed orcovered up to the knees and he should be dressed in the fashionprevalent in the North (v. 46), and that he should be encircledby an Avayṅga (v. 47). Accordingly the images of the sunthat are found in the temples mentioned above havebootsreaching up to the knees, and a girdle round the waist withone end hanging downwards<sup id="fnref:117"><a href="#fn:117" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">117</a></sup>. This last is a Persian feature,as we have already seen, and the other also must have the sameor similar origin. It certainly is not Indian. The features of the idol of the sun and the fact of Magas, who were descendedfrom the Persian Magi, being its priests point unmistakably tothe conclusion that the cult was introduced into Indis fromPersis, and I believe that the construction of so many templeswas also due to the foreign influence. For, in the account of theSaura systems we have given above, there is not the remotestallusion to a temple of the sun. According to all appearances,therefore, the cult prevalent in Northern India was entirelydistinct from those systems. It does not appear to have allieditself with any one of these latter. But it was accepted by themass of the Hindus as a general worship of the sun, and thefeelings which it evoked could not have been different from thosewhich the indigenous worship gave rise to. And the manner inwhich devotion to the sun is expressed in the Inscriptions whichwe find in some of the temples, has nothing special or foreign init. The Magas themselves, the priests of the new cult, weregradually thoroughly Hinduised until they became undistinguishable from the other Hindus and formed only a separatecaste.</p>

<p>In the copper-plate grant of Harṣavardhana, who lived in themiddle of the seventh century, his father Prabhākarvardhana,his grandfather Ādityavardhana and his great-grandfather Rājyavardhana are all styled great devotees of the sun (Paramādityabhakta)<sup id="fnref:118"><a href="#fn:118" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">118</a></sup>. This is an evidence to show that the sun cult, probablymade up of a mixture of the indigenous and foreign forms,prevailed in the beginning of the sixth century and was professedby great princes.</p>
<p><strong>XVII. Résumé of Śaivism &amp; Other Minor Systems, Part II.</strong></p>
<p>§ 117. The fearful and destructive phenomena of nature ledto the conception of, and belief in, the god Rudrs, the terriblehowler, accompanied by his groups, or Gaṇas, called sometimes</p>
<p>Rudras or Rudriyas, who were minor howlers. This god, whenpropitiated, became the auspicious Śiva, the beneficent Śaṁkaraand the benignant Śaṁbhu. The conception gradually developedfurther, until Rudra became the god of wild and awful scenes,such as cemeteries, mountains and forests. Of the beasts andsavages that dwelt in these last and of the thieves and outcaststhat resorted to them, he became the lord. Subsequently hedeveloped into the god who pervades the universe. dwells in fireand water in all beings and in herbs and trees and was thesupreme ruler of all. When he rose to this position, he becamethe subject of Upaniṣad speculation, by meditating on whom andseeing whom everywhere in the universe a man attained blissfulserenity.</p>
<p>But the awful and wild side of his nature was not effaced, butwent on developing; and when religious schools such as that ofthe Pāñcarātras came to be established, one with Rudra or Pāśupati as the god to be adored was set up some time after. Its founderwas a human being, who came to be known as Lakuṭin or Lakulin,the holder of a club, and Lakulīśa or Nakulīśa, the lord, theholder of the club. Pāñcartha was the title of the work attributedto him, and his system came to be known by the name of Pāśupata. Two extreme schools were developed out of this, and alsoone, which was more moderate, known by the name of the Śaiva.Traces of these schools have been found from about the secondcentury of the Christian era to about the twelfth.</p>
<p>But the repulsive nature of the two extreme schools and thewild and fantastic character of the other two led to a reaction,and in the beginning of the ninth century we have the first.Kaśmir school; and about a hundred years afterwards wasfounded another. These are very sober in their doctrines andpractices, and may be considered to have been influenced by theschool of Śaṁkara, though an escape from his severe spiritualmonism has been provided for, so as to allow of an individualexistence to the delivered soul.A further reform was effected about the middle of the eleventhcentury by the Liṅgāyat school. The philosophical doctrines ofthis school amount to this: that God is infinite intelligence and</p>
<p>joy, is the creator of the world and the instructor and redeemer ofmankind, and that the individual soul attains to a unity of blissful experience with him by gradually estranging himself fromthe world, pursuing a course of devotional worship, abandoninghimself to God and seeing him in everything. This philosophy seems to have been influenced by the tenets of the school ofRāmānuja, The spirit of the Liṅgāyats was, however, combative,and they set up for themselves a community distinct from thatwhich owes its origin to the Brāhmanic system. All the while,however, during the existence of these schools the generalworship of Rudra-Śiva has prevailed among ordinary people,regardless of the doctrines of these schools.</p>
<p>Śiva was associated with his consort Pārvatīor Umā. Shetoo had a beneficent and majestic character as alluded to in theKnU. But just as an aboriginal element contributed to theformation of the character of Rudra-Śiva, so an aboriginal element of a more distinct nature came to be combined with hisconsort, and she became a berrible goddess that had to beBut since theappeased by animal and even human sacrificeslustful nature of man is very strong in him, that goddess underthe name of Tripurasundarī(the beauty of the three cities) orLalitā(sportively graceful) became the creator of the world, andwas also worshipped with debasing and sensual rites; and thuscame in the school of the Śāktas, who looked forward to anidentity with Tripurasundarīas the goal of their existence.</p>
<p>Gaṇapati as the leader of a host was, of course, connectedwith Rudra-Śiva. That idea became mingled with the idea ofVināyaka, an evil spirit that possessed men, and thus the combined god Gaṇapati-Vināyaka became an object of worship onthe principle that an obstructive and evil spirit should be firstpropitiated before beginning an action. Thereafter he becamethe special god of six minor sects, one of these holding doctrinesas debasing as those of the Śākta cult.</p>
<p>Skanda was more closely connected with Śiva as the lord ofhis Gaṇas or groups; and afterwards came to be believed to behIs son; and his worship prevailed for several centuriesfrom the time of Patañjali downwards and has not becomeobsolete even at the present day.</p>
<p>The Sun was a god worshipped in early times and his cult didnot disappear, as his orb was daily visible. But he became theobject of sectarian worship some time later. About the thirdcentury, however, of the Christian era, another cult of the Sunwas introduced from Persia. It took root on Indian soil andprevailed for a long time in North-Western India, a good manysplendid temples having been erected from time to time for hisworship. A special caste of priests of the name of Magas wasassociated with the cult, and the masses of the Hindu populationadopted it as if it had been indigenous to the country.</p>
<p><strong>XVIII. Hindu Theism and Pantheism.</strong></p>
<p>§ 118. As the theoretic or philosophicportion of the doctrines,taught by the founders of most of the various systems we haveexamined, are based on certain fundamental ideas contained inthe Upaniṣads and the Bhagavadgītā, I deem it necessary to devotethis last section to a consideration of the question as to whatthose ideas definitely are, and to what extent they have beenadopted or modified by the promulgators of those systems tosuit their specific purposes.</p>
<p>In discussing these ideas, some scholars make a broad distinction between Vedantism, which they identify with Pantheism,and Theism. If they find any passage expressive of the immanence of God in the world in a work whose main aim is theistic,they consider such a passage to be interpolated. I have alreadyalluded to this mental attitude in the beginning of the presentwork, but it is necessary to say something more on the subject.If they mean by Theism the Deism of the eighteenth century,according to which the world is a machine constructed and setin motion by God, who remains apart from it, with perhaps theadditional doctrine that he enters into relations with men whoworship him and appeal to him, they are probably right. Butthis is not Hindu Theism. The immanence of God in theexternal world and in the heart of man is its essential doctrine.But that is perfectly consistent with the belief in God&rsquo;s transcendency, that is, his being distinct from the world and manand above them, influencing them, controlling them, protecting them, and listening to prayers. That the ideas of</p>
<p>immanence and transcendency are not incompatible or inconsistent with each other is admitted even by European thinkers.The Theism of the Bhagavadgītā is a Theism of this nature, andconsequently the passages expressive of immanence are by notmeans to be regarded as interpolated. Theism of this nature iscontained in the Upanişads also, though there are pantheisticdoctrines of varied sorts.</p>
<p>Pantheism as formulated by Spinoza is thus stated:— &ldquo;God,though undetermined <em>ab extra</em>, is capable of infinite self-determination. Thus God, the <em>causa suf</em>, manifests himself in an infinitemultiplicity of particular modes. Spinoza is, therefore, both pantheist and pancosmist: God exists only as realised in the cosmos:the cosmos exists only as a manifestation of God¹.&rdquo; The Upaniṣadscontain pantheistic doctrines corresponding to what is stated inthe first two sentences of this quctation. There are affirmationsthat when one thing is known, everything becomes known, as inthe case of a ball of earth, on knowing the true nature of whichone knows the true nature of all that is made of earth, etc.(ChU. VI. 1.4); that when the soul is seen, heard and knownall this becomes known, and the Brahman, the Kṣatra, theseworlds, these gods, these Vedas, these elements, all this is thesoul (BU. IV. 4. 6). Then again there are such statements as:&ldquo;That Sat alone existed in the beginning, one without a second.That reflected &ldquo;I may be many and multiply&rdquo;. It created light&quot;This statement is to the effect that everything existing is a formor modification of God. There are many such passages in theUpaniṣads and several of these are quoted in Śaṁkarācārya&rsquo;sBhaṣya on the Brahmasūtras I. 4. 23-27. But it is by nomeans to be inferred that the Upaniṣad Pantheism is of thenature set forth in the last sentence of the quotation fromSpinoza, that is; Brahman is, not exhausted in the world,but it exists separately also. But the objection to this view isthat Brahman being of the nature of spirit is not like the bodydivisible into parts, so that one may become developed into theworld and another re nain outside; and this is affirmed in a textof the ŚU. (VI. 19). This inconsistency is removed by Bādarā-yaṇa in Brahmasūtras II. 1. 26-27. The argument is that thoughthe Upaniṣads state that the constituent cause of the world isBrahman, they at the same time affirm the existence of Brahmanseparately from the world (ChU. III.12. 6; and VI. 3.2). Thetwo are inconsistent on the theory that Brahman is a spirit andnot discerptible into parts. Though they are thus inconsistentthey must both be accepted on the authority of the sacred texts,since the true nature of Brahman and the world is beyond thereach of human intellect. This solution of the difficulty is inadmissible to non-believers in the sacred texts, but it shows thatBādarāyaṇa does not agree with the latter part of Spnoza&rsquo;sdefinition of Pantheism, i. e., according to him, the sacred textsdo not affirm that &ldquo;God exists only as realised in the cosmos: thecosmos exists only as a manifestation of God&rdquo;. The inconsisteney pointed out by him is based on the impossible conceptionof Brahman&rsquo;s being divisible into parts. But it will not arise ifinstead of bringing in this conception, we suppose that in oneaspect Brahman is the material or constituent cause of the worldor realised in the world, and from another point of view, itremains pure and becomes the object of contemplation and devotion. Whatever it may be, Bādarāyaṇa&rsquo;s view appears to me tobe correct, and the Pantheism of the Upaniṣads is not exactly thesame as that formulated by Spinoza.<br>

<p>But even this partial Pantheism is only one of the doctrinesset forth in the Upaniṣads. As mentioned in the beginning theycontain the rudiments not only of one system of religious philosophy, but of a good many and even of Buddhism.WhenBrahman or the Supreme Soul is affirmed to be distinct from theworld and thus there is a denial of the partial Pantheism I havespoken of, that soul is represented as dwelling in the externalworld and in the soul of man; that is to say. Theism is taughtwith the immanency of God in the world and in man. Forinstance in the BU. III. 7. 7-30<sup id="fnref:119"><a href="#fn:119" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">119</a></sup> we have first &ldquo;He who dwelling.in the earth is distinct from it, whom the earth does not know,whose body the earth is, and who, being in the inside, controls theearth, is the indestructible controlling soul&rdquo;. In the followingpassages up to 30 we have precisely the same statement about water,</p>
<p>fire, the sky, wind, the sun, the moon and stars, the quarters, thelightning, thunderbolt, all the worlds, all the Vedas, all &lsquo;sacrifices,all beings, the vital breath, speech, the eye, the ear, the mind, theskin, light, darkness, the seminal fluid, and the (individual) soul.Here the inward controlling soul is mentioned as distinct fromthe earth and all the rest, up to the individual soul, and still asdwelling in them, controlling them from the inside, and havingthese for his body. The whole section winds up with the affirmation that this controlling soul is not seen, but is the seer is notheard, but hears; is not apprehended by thought, but apprehendsby thought; is not known, but knows; there is no other seer, noother hearer, no other apprehender, and there is no other knower.Herein are brought out the peculiar points of Hindu Theism :God is the only seer, the only hearer, and the only knower, thatis, he is all-seeing, all-hearing, and all-knowing; and nobody cansee him, hear him, or know him. He is distinct from all objects,but dwells in them and controlls them. Texts expressive of suchan immanency are to be found in many places in the Upaniṣads.God being thus distinct from the world, though immanent, canbe the object of devoted meditation, and can be attained by meansof truth, knowledge and purity. Mere immanency of this naturedoes not at all constitute the Pantheism formulated by Spinoza.There is therefore no ground whatever for regarding as aninterpolation the occurrence of texts expressive of it in sucha theistic work as the Bhagavadgītā.</p>
<p>We have noticed above the manner in which Bādarāyaṇaremoves the inconsistency between God&rsquo;s developing himself intothe world, while at the same time he is transcendent, and hisbeing a simple spirit without parts. Śaṁkarācārya fairly explains,I think, Bādarāyaṇa&rsquo;s view. But raising a further objection, hebrings in his own doctrine eventually, that the so-called development of Brahman into the world is fancied by ignorance and isnot true, that is, the world is an illusion. There are two doctrinesative of the relation of God to the world, the so-calledPariṇāmavāda and the Vivartavāda. The former implies realdevelopment and the latter, an illusive development. This last isthe doctrine of Śaṁkarācārya, wherefore his system should becalled Singularism rather than spiritual monism; while the first</p>
<p>is that clearly held by the author of the Sūtras. This is evidentfrom his very definition of Brahman as that from which everything originates, in which everything lives, and into whicheverything resolves itself in the end, and from the manner inwhich in the first Pāda of the Second Chapter he answers theobjections based upon the theory that an intelligent beingcannot develcp into non-intelligent or insensate matter; andŚaṁkarācārya</p>
<p>himself acknowledges at the end of his comment onII. 1. 14 that the author of the Sutras follows the Pariṇāma doctrinethough to save his theory, he imagines without any groundsthat Bādarāyaṇa has in view the ordinary or illusory conditionof things in doing so.</p>
<p>Śaṁkarācārya&rsquo;s Vivartavāda it was which the later schools ofVaiṣṇavism and Śaivism contended against; for even accordingto him, it leaves no scope for the relation of the ruler and theruled, i. e., God and the devotee, in the condition of reality whenall illusion is dispelled and one spirit alone exists (II. 1.14).Most of them adopted Bādarāyaṇa&rsquo;s Pariņāmavāda, but thedistinctness of God, man and the world, which was necessary forthe validity of their doctrines of worship and devotion, theysecured by qualifying the mode of development. By this qualification they also steered clear of the inconsistency pointed outby Bādarāyaṇa in II. 1. 26, so that his mode of satisfaction wasnot necessary for them. Rāmānuja lays down that the rudimentsof the individual souls and of the insensate world exist in Godhimself as his characteristics or body, and with these he developsinto the world, thus giving rise to the three distinct substances, the material world, the individual soul, and God as the controller.Nimbārka maintains that the other two substances do notcharacterise God or form his body, but are dependent upon himfor their existence, and in a subtle form constitute his power orcapacity, which develops into the animate and inanimate world.Viṣṇusvāmin, and therefore Vallabha, hold that the highest God,or Parabrahman, manifests himself as the material world, theindividual soul, and the supreme controller, but in the course ofdeve opent his attributes of intelligence and joy are concealeby his mysterious power, and thus is produced the materialworld, while, his joy alone being concealed, individual souls</p>
<p>come into existence, and when the three are manifest or unconcealed, he becomes the supreme controller. Vallabha adds twoother forms of Parabrahman or Puruṣottama, as mentioned inthe section<sup id="fnref:120"><a href="#fn:120" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">120</a></sup> on this system. Madhva rejects the doctrine ofGod being the constituent cause of the world and consequentlythat of his development, and lays down the five eternaldistinctions between God, man, and the world and betweendifferent individuals and objects involved in the last twoOf the older Śaiva schools, the Pāśupata brings in thePradhāna of the Sāṁkhyas with its developments as the materialcause of the world, with Paśupati as the efficient cause. ŚrīkaṇthaŚivācārya in his comment on Br. S. II. 2. 38, states that accordingto his predecessors, a certain branch of the philosophy based onthe sacred texts revealed by Śiva (Āgamas) held Śiva to be onlythe efficient cause of the world. This must be a reference to theŚaiva school which, as we have already stated, was a dualisticor pluralistic school. The Vāyavīyasaṁhitāaccording to himstates that Śakti, or power, first originates um Śiva, thenceMāyā, thence Avyakta (I. 7. 3). By Māyāis to be understoodthe wonderful creative power of Śiva, as is evident from thefollowing verse 4, and Avyakta means the Pradhāna, as appearsfrom that verse as well as verse 7. He gives another verse whichsets forth that everything from the Śakti to the earth is producedfrom the essence of Śiva, so that Śiva through the Śakti is boththe efficient and the constituent cause of the world. This Śaktiis brought in by those who hold creation to be the development ofŚiva, while it is not wanted for those Śaiva philosophers whowould keep the creative principle Maya or Pradhāna as distinctfrom Śive and undergoing independent development. Śrīkaṇthaexplains the expression Śiva alone existed&rsquo; occurring in ŚU. IV.18, under 1. 4. 27, by &lsquo;Śiva, with whom the Śakti (the power) inthe form of the animate and the inanimate world was united,alone existed so as to form one entity&rsquo;, so that he here understands Śiva as possessed of the Śakti to be the constituent cause.In this respect his doctrine is similar to that of Nimbārka. Butimmediately afterwards he speaks of the Cit and the Acit formingthe body of Siva and thus puts forth the same theory as that</p>
<p>of Rāmānuja. Practically he makes no distinction between thetwo. The theory of the Liṅgāyats is the same as the first formof the theory set forth by Śrīkaṇṭha Śivācārya. Śiva as qualifiedby the Śakti is the creator, that is, is the efficient and the constituent cause of the world. The Kaśmīr Śaivism attributes theproduction of the world to the will of God without anymaterial cause, or affirms that God makes the world appear inhimself.</p>
<p>Thus most of these schools avoid the Pantheism of Spinozaand the incompatibility between God&rsquo;s development into theworld and his transcendency by holding that the rudiments ofthe material and the spiritual world associated with God as hischaracteristics, or as his body, or as his power only undergodevelopment, he himself remaining pure. Viṣṇusvāmin andVallabha, admitting, as they do, the development of Puruṣottamainto the world and at the same time his transcendency, followBādarāyaṇa. The mysterious power which causes the differencesby rendering certain qualities imperceptible, may be comparedto the self-determining power of God involved in Spinoza&rsquo;sstatement. The Kaśmīr Śaivas do not bring in the idea of Godas a constituent cause undergoing development and seem toadmit the doctrine of creation out of nothing.</p>

<p><strong>LECTURE I.</strong></p>
<p><strong>GENERAL LAWS GUIDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF LANGUAGE:<br>
THE DIFFERENT STAGES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SANSKRIT.</strong></p>
<p>The occasion that brings us here together today is the first ofits kind in the history of this University. Hitherto the University of Bombay has been merely an Examining Board. But thisday witnesses the beginning of an attempt to discharge anotherand a more important function of such an institution. The mainidea of a University is that it is a body of men devoted tolearning, and engaged in acquiring knowledge and disseminatingit. A country that has no such bodies of men occupies but a lowposition in the intellectual scale of the world, and contributeslittle to the general advancement of mankind in knowledge. Buta devotion to learning implies sacrifice of worldly interests, andthe poverty of learned men has become proverbial. To enablepersons, therefore, to apply themselves to the pursuit of knowledgewith undivided attention, there exist in connection with suchinstitutions certain appointments tenable for life called professorships or fellowships, endowed by the enlightened liberality ofprivate individuals or of the government of the country.</p>
<p>India and the Bombay University are no exception to thegeneral rule. In other times learning flourished in the countryunder the fostering care of its innumerable princes and chiefs,as well as rich merchants. Though in the words of the poet, Śrīand Sarasvati are, in a sense, constantly hostile to each other, itis Śrīalone at all times and in all countries that can supportSarasvatī, and enable her to live and grow.Hence it is impossible that the Bombay University should rise to the dignity of aseat of learning without such a provision as is found necessary inmore advanced countries. India cannot take her place amongthe intellectual nations of the West, and compete with them inthe advancement of knowledge unless her Universities dischargetheir proper function, unless we have professorships in connectionwith them for the cultivation of science, philosophy, history andphilology.</p>
<p>But we may be told that an Indian does not care for knowledgefor its own sake, and it is only as a means of worldly advancement that he enters the University at all, and, as soon as he takeshis degree, he flings away his books, and no more troubles himselfwith the several branches of knowledge to which he was introduced while within the walls of his college. The reproach istrue, as well as untrue. It is true if it is meant that since thefirst school or college was opened by our Government we havehad very few or none among us who have devoted themselves tothe pursuit of knowledge. But if what it is intended to assert isthat a love of knowledge or learning and an unselfish devotion toit are foreign to the nature of a Hindu, it is altogether untrue.Those ponderous tomes which adorn the library of the Sanskritstudent and those innumerable <em>pustakas</em> in the Sarasvat! Bhāṇḍāras scattered throughout the country tell a different tale. But in this, as in other matters, the circumstances in which our virtueshave grown up and are exercised, are not the circumstances inwhich we are expected to display them, and fail to do so. Loveof learning is ingrained in the very nature of the Hindu, but thelegitimate object of this feeling is Sanskrit literature. A knowledge of English and of English literature and philosophy is, inthe first instance, sought for only for its practical benefits. AHindu would not send his son to an English School if he couldhelp it. A very powerful motive for the pursuit of learning, therespect of the society in which one lives, is also wanting in thecase of the so-called educated Indian. A Śāstri or Paṇḍit isesteemed and treated with respect and consideration by hiscountrymen; the English-knowing Indian may be feared if heholds some Government appointment, but if none, he enjoys noconsideration. The very word <em>vidvān</em> or &rsquo;learned&rsquo; is grudged himby the orthodox Hindu. In one branch of learning, however, vizSanskrit, an English-knowing Indian may meet with appreciationand esteem at the hands of the learned in Europe. That issubject in which he may successfully compete with his Europeanbrother, and in which he has peculiar advantages which the latterdoes not possess. Among his own countrymen he will findsympathy only if he has studied Sanskrit exactly in the old waybut even in this case his heterodoxy, which is the result of his</p>
<p>English education, would stand in the way. But there are indications that a more sympathising and appreciating body of menis growing about us, and the circle will go on widening as education advances. In this, as in other matters, there are hopes thatour countrymen will, in the course of time, chiefly through theagency of Government education, adapt themselves to theircircumstances; and the Hindu&rsquo;s inherent love of learning willgradually extend and engraft itself on the branches of knowledgeto which he has been newly introduced by the European.</p>
<p>But encouragement and support are essentially needed; and,taught by our ancient tradition, we naturally look up for these,in the first instance, to our Government. Hitherto it has confined its endeavours to the education of its subjects, a thing whichwas never before done by any Indian prince, and for whichit has the strongest claims on the gratitude of the Indians. Butwhat Indian princes have all along done, viz, the extension ofsupport and patronage to men of learning, and thus enablingthem to prosecute their studies, has not yet attracted the attentionof our Government, probably because they thought the time hadnot come for it. Next, it is the duty of those of our countrymen,who enjoy princely fortunes, to encourage the growth and advancement of learning among their countrymen. Now the best andmost effectual way, in which learning can thus be encourgedand patronized by all who have the means, is by founding University professorships to be held for life. A beginning, however,has been made, and for it we are indebted to the friends of thelate Rev. Dr. Wilson, and to the good old Doctor himself. For,when his friends raised up the sum and expressed to him theirintention to present it to him, he declined to receive it unconditionally, and, contenting himself with only a life interest in it,proposed that they should hand it over to the University, andfound a philological lectureship. It is in virtue of the advice hethus gave that we meet here today. I only regret that theSyndicate was not able to secure the services of an abler man,and that the duty of inaugurating the Wilsou Lectureship, and,I may say, the new phase on which the University is entering, hasdevolved on me.</p>
<p><strong>* ***</strong></p>
<p>The subject on which the lectures are to be delivered this</p>
<p>yearis the Sanskrit, and the Prakrit languages derived from it.Sanskrit is the language of the religion, law, philosophy, andpoetry of the Hindus; and all their ancient and most reveredbooks on these subjects are written in that language. Even atthe present day the language we use in our daily prayers andin the performance of our various religious rites is Sanskrit;learned men carry on their disputations in Sanskrit, and nowand then we meet with new poems written in that language.Prakrit is a general name given to certain dialects in whichwe find some old books written; and in ordinary Hindu usagethe term is extended to the vernaculars we speak. Marathi,Gujarati, and the various other idioms spoken in Northern India.are Prakrits. The wording of the subject as laid down in thecalendar implies that Sanskrit is the more primitive of these, andthat the Prakrits are derived from it. Our business, therefore, isto trace the history of Sanskrit, to observe how from the veryearliest form in which it is presented to us in the existing literature of the language, it gradually developed or was corruptedinto the modern vernaculars. The Sanskrit which we know of assuch is not now the spoken language of any part of India or ofthe world. It is simply preserved in books, and is used by thelearned. But if the Marathi, Gujarati, and the rest show unmistakable signs of having been derived from this language, itmust have been at one time spoken generally by our ancestors;and in being handed down from generation to generation it hasundergone various modifications and changes, until we have now.come to speak it as we do. But of this more hereafter.</p>
<p>India may justly claim to be the original home of scientificphilology. In one of the most ancient Sanskrit books,Samhits of the Black Yajurveda, there are distinct indications ofthe dawn of linguistic study¹. The Brāhmaṇas of the Vedas.</p>

<p>1.वाग्वै पराच्यव्याकृतावत्तेदेवा इन्द्रमत्रुन्निमां नो वाचं

<p>Speech was once inarticulate and undistinguished (into itsparts). Then the gods said to Indra, &lsquo;Distinguish our speech into parts.&lsquo;He said, &lsquo;I will ask a gift of you. let Soma be poured into one oup for meand Vāyu together.&rsquo; Hence Soma is poured into ons cup for Indra andVāyu together. Then Indra going into its midst distinguished it. Honcedistinct speech is now spokon. Tait. SaṁhitāVI. 4.7.</p>
<p>which rank next to the Saṁhitā, and even the TaittirīyaSaṁhitāitself, the composition of which differs in no particularfrom its rāhmaṇa, are full of etymological explanations of wordsthough often they are fanciful¹. One Ācārya followed another,and they all carefully observed the facts of their language, andlaid down the laws they could discover. They studied and compared the significations and forms of words, observed what wascommon to them, separated the constant element from thatwhich was variable, noticed the several changes that wordsundergo in different circumstances, and by such a process ofphilological analysis completed a system of grammar andetymology. In the Nirukto, Yāska, whose exact date we do notknow, but who must have flourished several centuries beforeChrist, lays down correct principles of the derivation of words.The last of the grammarian Ācāryas were Pāṇini, Kātyāyana,and Patañjali. The Prakrit dialects which sprang from Sanskritwere next made the subject of observation and analysis. Thelaws of phonetic change or decay in accordance with whichSanskrit words become Prakrit were discovered and laid down.The Sanskrit and non-Sanskrit elements in those languages weredistinguished from each other. This branch of philology alsowas worked up by a number of men, though the writings of oneor two only have come down to us.</p>
<p>In this condition Sanskrit philology passed into the hands ofEuropeans. The discovery of Sanskrit and the Indian grammatical system at the close of the 18th century led to a total revolution in the philological ideas of Europeans. Before this timethere was hardly a scientific treatment of linguistic facts, etymological analysis was scarcely known, and philological speculationhad not emancipated itself from the trammels of religion. TheJews were the chosen people of God, and hence their language,the Hebrew, was the most original of all languages, and allothers were derived from it. This was the belief of Europeanscholars, as that of the orthodox Paṇḍit at the present day is thatSanskrit is the primitive language, and all others are corruptions</p>

<p>1. The Ait. Brāhmaṇa rives the etymology of प्रैष(III. 9), of मानुष (III. 23).of जाया(VII. 13); the Tait. Saṁhitā, of रुद्र(I. 5. 1), of वृत्र(II.4.1, and II. 5.2) the Tait. Brāhmaṇa, of अश्व(I.1.5), of नक्षत्र(II, 7. 18) &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
<p>of it; though, however, the Paṇḍit has an excuse in the fact thatthe languages he generally hears spoken about him have reallysprung from Sanskrit. But several circumstances had about thistime prepared Europe for independent thought in philology, andSanskrit supplied the principles upon which it should be conducted and determined the current in which it should run. Thelanguages of Europe, ancient and modern, were compared withSanskrit and with each other. This led to comparative philologyand the classification of languages, and a comparison of the wordsand forms in the different languages led scholars into the secretsof the growth of human speech, and the science of language wasadded to the list of existing branches of knowledge. The progressmade within about fifty years is marvellous, and affords a strikinginstance of the intellectual activity of the Europeans. In thecultivation of philology and the elaboration of this new science,the Germans, of all other nations, have been most prominent, andhave done by far the greater portion of the work. The morelimited field of Prakrit philology with which we are here concerned has not been left uncultivated. Pali, the earliest of thePrakrit dialects, is almost as much studied in Europe as Sanskrit.We have editions of Pali texts by Turnour, a Ceylon Civilian,and a Danish scholar, Faushöll; and of a Native Grammar byKaccāyana, by M. Senart, a Frenchman; an original treatise onthis subject by Clough, and a very useful Dictionary by the Iatelamented Professor Childers¹. The derivation of the languagefrom Sanskrit forms the subject of an essay by the great Frenchscholar, M. Burnouf, and the equally great German scholar,Professor Lassen. There are notices of the Prakrit dialects inone of Colebrooke&rsquo;s essays and in the preface to ProfessorWilson&rsquo;s Hindu Theatre. Lassen also wrote a book entitledInstitutiones Linguee Pracratice, based upon the grammaticalworks of native writers, and upon the Prakrit passages occurring in the Sanskrit dramatic plays. Professor Weber, whose industryand comprehensive grasp are admirable, has published an</p>

<p>elaborate analysis of the language and contents of a Jaina religious work in Prakrit entitled the Bhagavatī, and of the languageof a collection of Prakrit songs by Hāla, together with an editionand translation of the work. Dr. Cowell has brought out a niceedition of the Prākṛta-Prakāśa by Vararuci; and Dr. Muir, whoseworks are so valuable to the student, devotes a large portion ofhis second volume of the</p>
<p>&quot; Sanskrit Texts&rdquo; to Prakrit philology,in which he gives his own views and a summary of those of otherscholars. In Ceylon, Mr. D&rsquo;Alwis has published a work on thePali, and in India, an edition of the Prakrit Grammar of Kramadīśvara has been published in the Bibliotheca Indics, and ofthat of Hemacandra in Bombay by a Jaina priest with theassistance of a Śāstrī¹. The modern vernaculars have not yetsucceeded in attracting the attention of the learned in Europe.Essays on some points of vernacular philology by ProfessorHoernle, of Jayanarayan&rsquo;s College, Benares, have appearedin the Journal of the Bengal Asiatic Society. But the mostimportant work on this subject that has yet appeared is Mr.Beames&rsquo;s Comparative Grammar of the Modern Aryan Languages. Two volumes have been published, and the thirdand last is expected<sup id="fnref:121"><a href="#fn:121" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">121</a></sup></p>
<p>. Mr. Beames has brought his subjectdown to the pronoun; and the forthcoming volume will treatof the verb. Dr. Trump in his valuable Grammar of theSindhi language compares the grammatical forms existingin the several vernaculars, and recent grammarians of Gujarati and Marathi have made attempts in some cases to tracethe grammar of these languages from the Sanskrit throughthe Prakrit. A Gujarati Śāstrī, named Vrajalāl, has written auseful little tract on the history of his vernacular³</p>
<p>. But uponthe whole, it must be acknowledged that vernacular philology isstill in a state of infancy, and a great deal of what has beenwritten is unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>Before I proceed to the subject in hand, it is necessary thatshould trace some of the laws of the development and growth oflanguage, as I shall have occasion to refer to them frequently inthe course of these lectures. Suppose a person wishes to expressthe idea <em>in a</em> <em>village</em>, and the only means at his command arethe roots and independent words in a language such as theSanskrit. Now the word which expresses <em>a</em> <em>village</em> is <strong>ग्राम</strong> , andanother which signifies the interior is <strong>मध्य</strong>. By joining the twotogether in such an expression as <strong>ग्राममध्य</strong>he conveys the ides the<em>interior of</em>, or <em>in</em>, a <em>village</em>. Now this word <strong>मध्य</strong> is pronounced<strong>मज्झ</strong> or <strong>मद्ध</strong> by persons who have either not been taught to pronounce it properly or are not sufficiently careful to do so. Thisagain is reduced to <strong>माझ</strong> or <strong>माध</strong>and thence to <strong>माह</strong>or <strong>मह</strong>, and ultimately to <strong>मा</strong> or <strong>मे</strong>. In this manner <strong>ग्राममध्य</strong> becomes <strong>गाममा</strong> or <strong>गाममे</strong>,which, as you know, are the forms of Gujarati, Sindhi and Hindilocative. In this condition its origin is forgotten by the speakers,and becomes simply a termination signifying <em>in the interior.<em>Again, if a man wants to speak of <em>one who makes a pot</em> and hasnot got a word to express the idea, he naturally puts together thewords <strong>कुम्भ</strong> <em>pot</em> and <strong>कार</strong></em>maker,</em> and uses the compound <strong>कुम्भकार</strong>.After a time, by faulty pronunciation, the <strong>क्</strong> goes out and theword is reduced to <strong>कुम्भा</strong>र. In the same way, as before, the persons.who use the word <strong>कुम्भार</strong> have no consciousness that they areputting together two words, one of which means a <em>pot</em> and theother <em>maker</em>; but the syllable <strong>आर</strong> becomes with them a simpletermination which signifies the doer of the thing expressed bythe base. We thus see that these two very general terminationswere originally independent words, and that in the course oftime they lost that character. If you examine those forms whichconstitute the declensions and conjugations of any language youmay happen to know, you will find that these also have originatedin the same way. When, our remote ancestors wished to say<em>I now</em> do, they put together <strong>कृ</strong> <em>do</em>, नु <em>now</em>, and <strong>मि</strong> <em>I</em>, and said <strong>कृनुमि</strong>,afterwards changed for the sake of euphony to <strong>कृणोमि</strong>. In thesame way <strong>कृणोति</strong>means <em>do now he</em><strong>कृणुतस्</strong><em>do now</em> he (and) <em>thou</em>.<strong>स्</strong> being a corruption of <strong>सि</strong> a pronoun signifying <em>thou</em>, and <strong>कृणोषि</strong><em>do now thou</em>. Or they expressed present time by using a pronounequivalent to <em>here</em> or <em>this</em> and said <strong>बोधति</strong><em>know here he</em>, the <strong>अ</strong></p>
<p>being the same as that we find in the forms <strong>अनेन, अस्मै, अस्मात्</strong>, &amp;c.and signifying something that is near. In this manner we areable to trace the original signification of a good many of theseforms, but since after their invention they are more or lesscorrupted, it becomes a difficult matter to do so in all cases. Still,we know enough to be able to lay it down as certain that this isthe mode in which all our grammatical forms have originated.When a language is in that condition in which grammaticalrelation is expressed by such compounds consciously formed, andboth parts of the compound can be used independently, it is saidto be in the analytic stage. The change of a to <strong>मध्य</strong> to <strong>मा</strong>or <strong>मे ,</strong> orof<strong>कार</strong> to <strong>आर</strong>, or of <strong>तसि</strong> to <strong>तस्</strong>or <strong>तः</strong> is what is called phonetic decay.Though this is usually spoken of in censure as curruption, it isthe means by which a language leaves the analytic stage anddevelops. The words forming the compound grow together, bothbeing altered in the process, and the original sense of the latter isforgotten. It is this circumstance that ronders phonetic changepossible, for, if those who speak the language always used thetwo <em>words</em> in the compound with a conscious desire to expresstheir joint sense, such a corruption would not take place. Phoneticdecay reduces the letter portion to a mere termination, and thusa language arrives at what is called the synthetic stage. All thedead Aryan languages, and most of the living ones also, are inthe synthetic condition, while the Chinese is said to be in theanalytic stage.</p>
<p>Phonetic decay or corruption is a process that is constantlygoing on in a living language. At some stages of its history itis very rapid and at others slow. It sometimes wholly transformswords. Its causes are deeply ingrained in human nature itself.Language is not the end and aim of human life; it is simply aninstrument of communicating thought, and the matter of thoughtis always more important than the expression. The utteranceof a word implies an effort. We have to force the breath throughthe windpipe, check or compress it at different points in itspassage through the mouth, and then let it off. The glottis or theopening of the windpipe, and the tongue and the various parts ofthe mouth are our organs of speech, and an innumerable varietyof sounds may be produced by their means. In pronouncing</p>
<p>certain letters the glottis must be stretched or expanded,while in the case of others it is contracted, which is its morenatural condition. The breath which comes out when it isexpanded is called <em>śvāsa</em> or simple unintonated breath by theold Indian Philologists. But when the glottis is contracted, andthe breath is intonated by the vibration of the vocal chords, itbecomes what is called <em>nāda</em>, i. e., tone or intonated breath.Simple breath is the material cause of the hard consonants, andthe intonated breath of the soft, and of the vowels. When <em>nāda</em>is forced out and allowed to pass away without being obstructed,we pronounce vowels, and when both <em>śvāsa</em> and <em>nāda</em> are obstructed at different parts of the mouth, the sounds that areformed are consonantal. Hence a consonant cannot bepronounced by itself; it is only when the touching organsare separated, and the air allowed to pass through any oneof the vowel positions, that the sound is produced.</p>
<p>When the intonated breath is let off through the rounded lips,it forms <strong>उ</strong>, and with the lower lip a little further off, <strong>ओ</strong>; while ifthe lips completely touch each other, and the breath is thusobstructed in its passage, we have <strong>ब्</strong>which, with a greater forceof respiration, becomes <strong>भ्</strong>, and when it is partly sent into thenose, it assumes the form of <strong>म्.</strong> If the <em>śvāsa</em> is in the same condition as <em>nāda</em> when it forms <strong>ब्</strong> and <strong>भ्</strong>, we have <strong>प्</strong> and <strong>फ्</strong>. Whenthese two kinds of breath are shut up by the tip of the tongueforming a complete contact with the root of the upper teeth, wehave <strong>त्, थ्, द्, ध्</strong>and <strong>न्</strong>. When the contact is effected higher upand the forepart of the tongue is made into a curve, we have <strong>ट्, ठ, ड्, ढ्</strong>and <strong>ण्</strong>. If the middle of the tongue is brought near thepalate, <em>nāda</em> passing through the intervening space forms thevowel <strong>इ</strong>; and when the tongue is a little further off and themouth more open, we have <strong>ए</strong> ; while if there is complete contact,the two kinds of breath give us <strong>च्, छ, ज्, झ्</strong>,and <strong>ञ्</strong> as before.When the root of the tongue touches the lower skirt of the palate,we have similarly <strong>क्, ख्, ग्, घ्</strong>, and <strong>ङ्</strong>. . If the intonated breath isallowed to pass away when the mouth is in its natural positionwith the lips open, we have the vowel <strong>अ</strong>, and, with greater forceof breath, the aspirate <strong>ह</strong>. The vowel portion of <strong>ऋ</strong> and लृ differsfrom <strong>अ</strong> in the whole lower part of the mouth being brought closer</p>
<p>to the upper in pronouncing it, while in pronouncing at the twoparts of the mouth are more widely apart; so that the vowelsound involved in <strong>ऋ</strong> is the closest, <strong>आ</strong>, the most open. The diphthongs <strong>ऐ</strong> and <strong>औ</strong> are <strong>अ + इ</strong> and <strong>अ + उ</strong> pronounced hastily. Inpronouncing the semi-vowels the organs are brought very closeto each other, but do not form a complete contact; so that thebreath is compressed and not shut up. Still, like the mutes, theycannot be pronounced without separating the organs.Wepronounce <strong>त्</strong> when we bring the two lips and the ends of theupper teeth into close proximity, and it thus corresponds to thevowel <strong>उ</strong>; for <strong>य्</strong> theposition is the same as that for <strong>इ</strong>, the proximity only being greater; while <strong>ल्</strong> is formed a little above thedental position by emitting the breath by the sides of the tip ofthe tongue, and <strong>र्</strong> a little below the cerebral. The sibilants <strong>श, ष्</strong>and <strong>स्</strong> are continuous sounds made by letting off the <em>śvāsa</em> orsimple breath with the same force as in the case of the hard.aspirates and through the space between the middle of the tongue.and the palatal, cerebral, and dental or dento-palatal positionsbrought as near to each other as in pronouncing vowels.</p>
<p>You will thus see how minute and laborious these operationsare. The difficulty is increased when we have to pronounce twoor more consonants together. We have first to put the organs ofspeech into one position, and immediately afterwards into another,without leaving the first.Accurate pronunciation thereforerequires great effort, and since, according to an observation ofLocke, labour for labour&rsquo;s sake is against nature, the tendencyalways exists of making as little effort as is consistent with thenecessity of making oneself understood. Hence <strong>मुख</strong> is transformedto <strong>मुह</strong>i. e. only the quantity of breath necessary to pronounce <strong>ख</strong>is let off, and the effort of forming a complete and close contactis saved; <strong>कदलकम्</strong> becomes <strong>कअलअम्</strong>, and thence <strong>केलूं</strong> and <strong>केलें</strong>, wherealso you will see that the contact is avoided; <strong>अर्प</strong> becomes <strong>अप्प</strong>, inwhich case we find that the effort involved in the change fromone position of the vocal organs to another is economized, thoughthe pressure which the organs exert upon each other in thepronunciation of a conjunct continues the same, i. e. we have.a conjunct as before, but the two members are assimilated. Thisis further changed to <strong>आप</strong>in which the pressure is avoided, but</p>
<p>the shortening of the time which this would involve is obviatedby lengthening the preceding vowel. This tendency to phoneticdecay is so powerful that if not counteracted it would in theshort space of a few generations render a language entirelyunintelligible to its former speakers. Children, in their firstessays at speech, often mispronounce words, and if they were leftto themselves, the language of a country would undergo verygreat transformation in a short time. But at home and in schoolsthey are taught to speak the language of their parents correctly,and this result is averted. Education, therefore, is an agencywhich arrests the progress of decay. Another check is affordedby the necessity of making oneself intelligible. If a man is careless about his language, he will not be understood. He has therefore necessarily to endeavour to speak as other people do. Thefeeling of society is also arrayed against the corruption of alanguage. The speech which does not approach the receivedstandard is branded as vulgar. The tendency to corruption isgreatly diminished when a language comes to have a literature.Some races are very careful about their speech, and preserve it ina comparatively pure condition; there are others which corruptit greatly. But even in the case of the former, accidents in itshistory may transform the idiom considerably. If one race comesin contact with another, and gives it its language, it is sure to begreatly corrupted. The alien race cannot catch the pronunciationproperly, or its vocal organs may be naturally so constituted orits previous vocal habits may be of such a nature as to renderthe sounds of the language difficult or impossible to be imitated.If there were no schools and colleges for teaching English to us,we should corrupt the language of our rulers so greatly as torender ourselves perfectly unintelligible to them. The nativesentry&rsquo;s challenge <strong>हुकुम् डर</strong> for &ldquo;who comes there?&rdquo; would be apuzzle to the scientific philologist.</p>
<p>The grammatical terminations which are oftener used thanany particular words suffer the most by this process of decay,and after a time they are confused with each other or droppedaway. When a language is reduced to this condition, it has tofall back upon the expedient with which it started, and tack oncertain words or particles to its nouns and verbs to express the</p>
<p>relations which the old terminations denoted, and thus the analyticstate returns. But the old process goes on again, and thesewords in their turn assume the character of terminations. Sometimes along with a case-form there exists in the language anotherexpression convoying the same sense. When the former goesout of use the latter takes its place, or sometimes the latter drivesout the former. The modern vernaculars have had to resort tothis process of reconstruction in a great measure, and, as in theolder languages, it has already become difficult in several casesto trace the origin of the forms. For instance, in Sanskrit thetermination which expresses future time is , and when it isapplied to the root <strong>दा</strong> <em>to</em> <em>give</em>, we have <strong>दास्यति</strong><em>he will give</em>. This <strong>स्य</strong>is very likely a compound of the root <strong>अस्</strong><em>to be</em> and <strong>या</strong> <em>to go</em>, sothat the contrivance the early Āryans had recourse to, to expressfuturity, was to attach to a root two others expressive of <em>going tobe</em>; <strong>दास्यति</strong>therefore originally meant he <em>goes to be giving</em>, i e.he does not give, but <em>will</em> give since he goes to do it. Now this<strong>दास्यति</strong> in the derived dialects becomes first <strong>दास्सति</strong>, then <strong>दास्सदि</strong>,<strong>दास्सइ दासइदाहइ, दाह</strong> and <strong>दे</strong>in order Phonetic corruption hasthus reduced this form to <strong>दाइ</strong> or <strong>दे</strong>, and that for the present tense.<em>I</em> <em>give</em> has also assumed the same appearance. There is thus nodistinction between them; wherefore, to express future time, ourlanguages have had recourse to a variety of expedients which Ishall endeavour to explain in their proper place. The Hindi,however, has hit upon the same that was used by our earlyancestors, and distinguished futurity by adding to this shrunkenform the past participle of <strong>गम्</strong> to go, which is <strong>गआ</strong>, changed to <strong>गा</strong> by combining the vowels, and thus <strong>देगा</strong>, the form of the future,signifies literally, <em>gone</em> <em>that he (may) give</em>.</p>
<p>Another phenomenon constantly observable in the history ofthe growth of a language is the use of false analogies. Thusin Sanskrit the root <strong>श्रु</strong> <em>to hear</em> takes the augment <strong>नु</strong>in the Presentand three other tenses or moods, and the Sanskrit of <em>he hears</em> is<strong>शृणोति</strong>. Now in the course of time people forgot that this termination was used in these tenses alone, and extended it to theFuture, the past participle, and other derivatives, so that in thePali and the Prakrits the root itself became <strong>सुण = शृण</strong> instead of <strong>श्रु</strong>.This root has descended to most of the modern dialects in this</p>
<p>same form. In the same way <strong>क्री</strong> to buy became <strong>किण, ज्ञा</strong> <em>to know</em>,<strong>जाण, बुध्</strong> t<em>o know</em>, <strong>बुज्झ</strong> and so on. All these exist in the vernaculars so augmented. In the same way, though <strong>कृ</strong> is conjugatedin Sanskrit by adding <strong>उ</strong> to the base according to the rule of theeighth conjugation, and forms <strong>करोति, कुर्वन्ति</strong>&amp;c., in Prakrit it isconjugated according to the rule of the first or the tenth whichare generalised, and has <strong>करइ</strong> or <strong>करेइ</strong>. This arises from the samesort of mistake that children commit, when, for instance,from the analogy of <strong>धरलें</strong> from <strong>धर</strong>, <strong>पडलें</strong> from <strong>पड</strong>&amp;e, they use <strong>करलें</strong>from <strong>कर</strong>, though the correct Marathi form is <strong>केलें</strong> and you mayremember such expressions as &ldquo;<em>I knowed</em>&rdquo; and&rdquo;<em>you was</em>&ldquo;thatDickens puts into the mouth of his lower characters. The Paliand the Prakrits are full of such formations. This law may becalled the law of false analogies or of the generalisation ofgrammatical forms, or formal generalisation, and the effect of itis to do away with anomalies and introduce simplicity in alanguage. It springs from the same causes as phonetic decay,viz. the economisation of effort, and its operation is restricted also by the same causes as those which arrest the progress of phoneticcorruption.</p>
<p>Hitherto we have been considering the growth or the decay ofthe grammar of a language. But the names of objects constitute avery important part of human speech. These are not arbitrary orsimply conventional. The possibility of mere conventional namescan exist only under a supposition of men meeting and agreeingthat they should call such thing by such name. But this impliesa condition of high social and political development, which in anearly state of society does not exist, and, in the absence oflanguage, cannot exist. The process is very artificial, and wouldhardly be worthy of the intellectual nature of man; and though evenin a high state of civilisation a language grows, and new namesspring up, this is not the way in which they do so. The names ofobjects are always expressive of some attribute possessed by thoseobjects, <strong>पृथ्वी</strong><em>the earth is that</em> which is broad, <strong>भानु</strong> <em>the sun</em>, thatwhich shines, <strong>उदन्वत्</strong> <em>the sea</em> that which has water, <strong>पितृ</strong> <em>father</em>, onewho protects, <strong>दुहितृ</strong><em>daughter</em>, one who milks cows. But you willsee that these names are not logical definitions, for they have thedefect of <em>ativyāpti,</em> i. e. are too wide. It is not the earth alone</p>
<p>that is broad, nor the sun alone that shines, nor the sea alone thathas water. But still these things possess these attributes pre-eminently, and hence the terms become restricted to them. What isgeneral is thus rendered particular, and the sense of words is, so tosay, specialized. This process goes on continually in a livinglanguage, not only in the invention of new names, but often itworks in a manner to narrow the sense of existing words. Thus,<strong>वदना</strong> etymologically signifies &lsquo;a feeling,&rsquo; &lsquo;a sensation,&rsquo; thence it isrestricted in Sanskrit to a particular sensation, that of severepain; but the pre-eminent pain is that experienced in child birth,hence <strong>वेण</strong>, the Prakritised form of the word, signifies in Marathithat special pain. So, गर्भिणी in Sanskrit denotes <em>&lsquo;a female that ispregnant,&rsquo;</em> but <strong>गाभण</strong>, the Marathi form of the word, is restricted tolower animals; <strong>ताप</strong> in Sanskrit means &lsquo;heat&rsquo; generally, but inMarathi, and in Gujarati in the form of <strong>ताव</strong>, it signifies a particular kind of hest, viz. &lsquo;fever&rsquo; though the word has not lost itsgeneral sense; <strong>हृदय</strong> denotes originally the heart, in modern.Marathi in the form of <strong>हिय्या</strong> it signifies &lsquo;courage, which is aquality of the heart, though in old Marathi it preserves itsoriginal sense; <strong>पिण्ड</strong> in Sanskrit means &lsquo;a ball&rsquo; generally, but inPanjabi and Gujarati in the form of <strong>पण्ड</strong> it is restricted to thisball of flesh and bones, &rsquo;the body&rsquo;; <strong>चेटक</strong> in Sanskrit signifies &lsquo;anattendant&rsquo;, but in the form of <strong>चेला</strong> it denotes in the Hindi&rsquo;s &lsquo;a pupilor disciple&rsquo;, who, according to Indian custom, is his master&rsquo;sclose attendant, and in Bengali and the Goanese Marathi, in theforms of <strong>चेले</strong> and<strong>चलो</strong> &lsquo;a boy&rsquo; or <em>son</em>, who is constantly about hisparents. Opposed to this is a process which may be calledgeneralisation of the sense. Thus the root <strong>गवेष्</strong>originally signified&rsquo;looking or searching for a cow&rsquo;; it was then extended to anykind of &lsquo;searching&rsquo;, and lastly in the form of <strong>गवसणें</strong> signifiesin Marathi &rsquo;to find&rsquo; <strong>इन्द्र</strong>originally &rsquo;the lord of the gods,&rsquo; is inSanskrit used to signify&rsquo;the lord &lsquo;of any class of beings, suchexpressions as <strong>मानवेंद्र, गजेंद्र</strong>, &amp;c. being very common; and notableexample of this procesa is afforded by the word <strong>राजा</strong> which inSanskrit means &lsquo;a king&rsquo;, but, in the forms of <strong>राय</strong>or <strong>राव</strong>, is in themodern languages used as a title of distinction, and in Marathi,any respectable gentleman not following the priestly occupation,and not a man of learning may be called a rāv. Sometimes, when</p>
<p>by means of phonetic corruption a word is reduced to two formseach of the two sequires a distinct sense. Thus, Sanskrit <strong>वृद्ध</strong> isin the modern languages corrupted to <strong>बुढ्ढा</strong> H.,<strong>बुढो</strong> S., <strong>बुड</strong> B., andin this form it means&rsquo;an old man&rsquo;.It is also corrupted to<strong>बडा</strong> H., <strong>बडो</strong>S., <strong>बड</strong>B., <strong>बडो</strong> G., and <strong>व्हड</strong> Goan. M. in which form itsignifies &lsquo;great&rsquo;, &rsquo;large&rsquo;,or &lsquo;more advanced in age&rsquo;. In thislast sense,the termination <strong>ल</strong> or <strong>र</strong> is appended to it (M. <strong>वडिल</strong>, S.<strong>वडेरो</strong>). The Sanskrit word <strong>क्षण</strong> becomes <strong>छण</strong> in the sense of &lsquo;a festival,&ldquo;in Pali and the Prakrits, but <strong>खण</strong> in the sense of &lsquo;a moment&rsquo;. In Marathi <strong>छण</strong> is further transformed to <strong>सण</strong>and <strong>खण</strong>in the form of<strong>खिण</strong> also occurs in the old literature and in one of its dialects.The Sanskrit <strong>उज्ज्वल</strong> in the form of <strong>उजल</strong> M., <strong>उजल</strong> H., <strong>उजलु</strong> S. उ<strong>जलू</strong>G., <strong>उज्जल</strong> P. means bright, clear, pure, but in the form of उजाडM.,H., G., P., S., B., it means desolate or waste. This sense it.acquired by the first process explained above, since a desolateland is cleared, purified of its tenants or appurtenances. <strong>खुजा</strong>means in Marathi a dwarf and <strong>कुबडा</strong> humpbacked. This lastword exists in the other languages also, and both are derivedfrom the Sanskrit <strong>कुब्ज.</strong></p>
<p>The last phenomenon in the growth of a language which Ishall notice is the gradual disappearance of words. As menadvance in knowledge and civilisation, new ideas and modes ofthinking arise, and the old ones fall into disuse. And sincewords are the representatives of ideas, new words always comein, and the old go out. The changes that the Marathi language,for instance, has undergone in this respect since the time ofJñāneśvara, or the Hindi since the time of Chanda, render theolder books unintelligible to modern readers. There are alsovarious other causes. Sometimes, when another language risesinto importance on account of political circumstances, or when itis admired and esteemed by a nation, as Sanskrit is by Hindus,a great many words are borrowed from it, and necessarily theolder ones go out to make room for them, or disappear becausethey are regarded as vulgar. The opening of an intercoursewith a foreign nation brings about the same result. These causesaccount in a great measure for the fact that so many words inour languages have become obsoleta.JJñāneśvara&rsquo;s Prakrit <strong>पसाय</strong>had to make room for the Sanskrit <strong>प्रसाद, गहिरु</strong>for <strong>गंभीर</strong> and <strong>नाह</strong>for</p>
<p><strong>नाथ</strong>; and the word <strong>जमीन</strong>has well-nigh supplanted the old <strong>भुई</strong>, as <strong>हुकुम</strong>has done <strong>आज्ञा</strong>, which itself must once have driven out sucha word as <strong>आणा</strong> or <strong>आयस</strong>, the Prakrit forms of <strong>आज्ञा</strong> and <strong>आदेश</strong>.</p>
<p>The languages of the civilised nations of the world have beendivided into three families, the Āryan or Indo-European, theSemitic, and the Turanian. The first comprises the Indian branch,consisting of Sanskrit, Pali and the Prakrits, and the modernVernaculars of Northern India and of Ceylon; the Iranic branchconsisting of Zend, the sacred language of the Parsis, the Pehlevīand the other cognate dialects the Hellenic or the Greek branchcomprising the languages of Ancient Greece and its modernrepresentatives; the Italic branch, consisting of the Latin andthe cognate ancient languages of Italy and the dialects derivedfrom Latin, the Italian, the French and the old Provencal, theSpanish, the Portuguese, and the Wallachian; the Keltic or thelanguage of those Kelts or Gauls that so often figure in Romanhistory, and distinguished into two varieties, the Kymric, nowspoken in Wales and in the Province of Brittany in France, andthe Gaelic, spoken in the Isle of Man, the Highlands of Scotland,and Ireland; the Lithuanian and Slavonic, comprising thelanguages of Lithuania, Russia, Bulgaria, and of the Slavonie.races generally; and the Teutonic branch, consisting of the Scandinavian group, i. e. the languages of Sweden, Norway, Iceland,and Denmark, of the High German i. e. the old and the presentlanguage of Germany, and of the Low German, which comprisedthe old Anglo-Saxon and the other languages spoken on thecoasts of Germany, the modern representatives of which are theEnglish, and the dialects spoken in Holland, Friesland, and theNorth of Germany. The second family comprises the Hebrew,the Arabic, the Chaldee, the Syriac, the Carthaginian, and thecognate and derived languages; and the third, the Turkish andthe languages of the Mongolian tribes. To this last family thedialects spoken in Southern India are also to be referred. TheZend approaches Sanskrit the must, but the affinities of thislatter with Greek and Latin are also very striking, and such asto convince even a determined sceptic. Sanskrit has preserveda greater number of ancient forms than any of these languages,hence it is indispensable for purposes of comparative philology.</p>
<p>The literature of Sanskrit presents, as ordinarily considered,two varieties of the language; but a third may also, as I shallpresently endeavour to show, be clearly distinguished. Of thesethe most ancient is that found in the hymns of the RgvedaSaṁhitā. These were composed at different times and by differentṚṣis, and were transmitted from father to son in certain families.Thus the third of the ten collections, which make up the Saṁhitā,bears the names of Viśvāmitra, and the hymns contained in itwere composed by the great patriarch and his descendants. Theseventh is ascribed to Vāsiṣṭha and his family. The compositionof these hymns, therefore, extended over a long period, thelanguage is not the same throughout. and while some of thempresent a variety so close to the later Sanskrit that there is littledifficulty in understanding them, the style of others is so antiquated that they defy all efforts at interpretation, and their sensewas not understood even by the Ṛṣis who flourished in the verynext literary period, that of the Brāhmaṇas. Still for our purposes we may neglect these differences and consider the Vedicvariety of Sanskrit as one.</p>
<p>The chief characteristics of the Vedic language are these:— Itcontains a large number of words that have become obsolete orchanged their sense in the later or classical Sanskrit. There is&amp; greater variety of verbal derivatives, such as <strong>दर्शत</strong>inthe sense of <strong>दर्शनीय</strong>&lsquo;worthy to be seen, or handsome&rsquo;, <strong>जीवस, अवस</strong> &amp;c., abstractnouns from the roots <strong>जीव्, अव्</strong>, &amp;c.,<strong>जनुभ्</strong>&lsquo;something produced&rsquo;, <strong>पपि, बभ्रि, जघ्नि</strong> &amp;c.nouns of agency having a past sense (Pāṇini III. 2. 171), which govern an accusative, <strong>दृशीक</strong>signifying&rsquo;handsome&rsquo; or <strong>मृलीक</strong>, &lsquo;favour,&rsquo; &amp;c. The nominative plural termination of nouns ending <strong>अ</strong> in is <strong>असम्</strong> (Pāṇini VII. 1. 50), as in<strong>विश्वे देवा</strong>सः, as well as <strong>अस्</strong>, as in <strong>यज्ञेन यज्ञमयजन्त देवाः</strong>; and the instrumental plural is <strong>देवेभिः</strong>or <strong>देवैः</strong>: (Pāṇini VII. 1. 10). The vowel casesof nouns in <strong>उ</strong> are often formed by joining the vowels by theusual Saṁdhi rules; as <strong>तन्वम्</strong>or <strong>तनुवम्</strong>, accusative singular of <strong>तनुः</strong>;<strong>मध्वः</strong>and <strong>वस्वः</strong>,genitive singulars of <strong>मधु</strong>and <strong>वसु</strong>. The instrumentalsingular is made up by affixing <strong>आ, या</strong>or <strong>इया</strong>, instead of <strong>ना</strong>, as<strong>मध्वा, उरुया, उर्विया, धृष्णुया</strong>&amp;c. (Pāṇini VII. 1. 39); sometimes ofother nouns also, as <strong>स्वपया, नावया</strong>&amp;o. The nominative and vocative dual of masculine and the plural of neuter nouns in <strong>अ</strong> often</p>
<p>end in <strong>आ</strong>; as <strong>येनेमा विश्वा च्यवना कृतानि</strong> ṚV. II. 12.4, <strong>अश्विना पुरुदंसमानरा</strong> ṚV. I. 3. 2; and the instrumental singular of feminine nounsin <strong>इ</strong> is optionally formed by simplylengthening the vowel(Pāṇini VII. 1.39), as <strong>नविष्ठया मती</strong>ṚV. 1. 82. 2. The locativesingular termination is often dropped, as in <strong>परमे व्योमन</strong>; or its <strong>औ</strong>changed to <strong>आ</strong>, as in <strong>नाभा</strong>for <strong>नाभौ</strong> (Pāṇini VII1. 39). TheParasmaipada first person plural termination of verbs is <strong>मसि</strong>(Päṇini VII. 1. 46), as <strong>नमो भरन्त एमसि</strong>ṚV. I. 1. 7, and that of thethird person plural is often or <strong>रे</strong>, as <strong>रते</strong>, as <strong>दुन्हे</strong> or <strong>दुन्हते</strong>. Other formsalso admit of this <strong>र</strong>, as <strong>अदृश्रमस्य</strong>. The <strong>त</strong> of the Ātmanepada terminations is often dropped (Pāṇini VII. 1. 41 ), as <strong>वस्वईशे</strong>ṚV.I.71.9.There are eight different forms of the mood called <strong>लेट्</strong>by Pāṇini,which has a conditional or subjunctive sense; <strong>सुपथा करत्। प्र ण आयूंषि तारिषत्</strong>,ṚV. I. 25. 12, <strong>स देवानेह वक्षति</strong>ṚV.I. 1. 2. This is lostin classical Sanskrit. The several conjugations or ways offorming the special tenses do exist, but the roots are not restrictedto any particular way, being conjugated sometimes according toone mode and sometimes according to another; as <strong>श्रुधी हवम्</strong>. Thereare some instances in which some tenses other than the specialtenses also admit of the conjugational sign, as <strong>विशृण्विरे</strong>, perfect.Sometimes guṇa is substituted before the <strong>त</strong>of the second personplural imperative, though it is a weak termination, as in <strong>शृणोत</strong>.</p>
<p>The infinitive is formed by adding to roots the terminations <strong>से,ध्यैअध्यै, तवै</strong>and <strong>तवे</strong> ( Pāṇini III. 4.9), as <strong>वक्षे, जीवसे, पिबध्यै, दातवे, हन्तवे</strong>.These are etymologically the forms of the dative singularof such nouns as <strong>वक्ष्, जीवस्, पिबधि</strong>&amp;c. A few other datives aresimilarly used, as <strong>दृशे, रोहिष्यै</strong>&amp;c. (Pāṇini III, 4. 10, 11). Theaccusatives of some nouns are also used as infinitives whengoverned by <strong>शक्</strong>(Pāṇini III 4.12), as <strong>न ये शेकुर्यज्ञियां नावमारुहम्</strong>ṚV. X. 44. 6; also in other places, <strong>चिकितुषो विपृच्छम्</strong> ṚV. VII. 86. 3.The infinitive in classical Sanskrit ends in a, as, which isthe accusative form of such a noun as <strong>कर्तु</strong>, the dative of which,<strong>कर्तवे</strong>, is one of the forms of the Vedic infinitive. The potentialparticiples are often formed by adding <strong>तवै, ए, एण्य</strong> and <strong>त्व</strong>(PāṇiniIIL 4.14), as <strong>नैषा गव्यूतिरभर्तवा उ</strong> ṚV. X. 14.2, <strong>न तेन देव आदिशे</strong> ṚV.VI. 56, 1, <strong>दिदृक्षेण्यः, कर्त्वम्</strong>. The first two, however, ought properlyto be considered as infinitives. The absolutive is sometimesformed by the addition <strong>त्वाय</strong>; as <strong>गत्वाय</strong>. There is such a form as</p>
<p><strong>इष्टीनम्</strong> for <strong>दृष्ट्वा</strong>;and such others as <strong>हत्वी</strong> and <strong>पीत्वी</strong>for <strong>हत्वा</strong> and <strong>पीत्वा</strong>occur often. Those last, as also the usual or classical absolutives,are forms of the instrumental singular of the same nouns, thedative and accusative of which are used as infinitives; <strong>त्वाय</strong>appears also to be an instrumental. There are a great manyother peculiarities which are noticed by Pāṇini, and which youwill find collected in the Siddhānta-Kaumudī. One thing, however, should be borne in mind, that notwithstanding there isin these respects a very groat difference between the Vedic andthe classical Sanskrit, they are in the same phonetic stage, i. e.the vocal elements of words and letters remain the same. Thereare a few such instances, as <strong>सध</strong> for <strong>सह</strong>, and <strong>गृभ्</strong>for <strong>गृह्</strong>, in whichthe mute has disappeared, leaving only the aspirate element, andto these may be added the terminations <strong>मसि</strong>and <strong>असस्</strong> for <strong>मस्</strong> and<strong>अस्</strong>; but both the original and corrupt forms exist in the Vedas,and no general conclusion can be based on these few instances.You will hereafter see that the other dialects I shall speak ofdiffer greatly from the classical Sanskrit in these respects. Thefollowing specimen will give you an idea of Vedic Sanskrit :—</p>
<p>१. यच्चिद्धि ते विशो यथा प्र देव वरुण व्रतम् । मिनीमसि द्यविद्यवि ॥<br>
२. मानो वधाय हत्नवे जिरीलानस्यरीग्धः। मा हृणानस्य मन्यवे ॥<br>
५. कदा क्षत्रश्रियं नरमा वरुणं करामहे। मृलीकायोरुचक्षसम् ॥<br>
७. वेदा यो वीनांपदमन्तरिक्षेण पतताम् ।वेद नावः समुद्रियः ॥<br>
१०. नि षसाद धृतव्रतो वरुणः पस्त्यास्वा । साम्राज्याय सुक्रतुः ॥<br>
११. अतो विश्वान्यद्भुता चिकित्वाँअभि पश्यति। कृतानि या च कर्त्वा ॥<br>
१२. स नो विश्वाहा सुक्रतुरादित्यः सुपथा करत् । प्रण आयूंषि तारिषत् ॥<br>
१९. इमं मेवरुण श्रुधी हवमद्या च मृलय ।त्वामवस्युरा चके ॥</p>
<p>These eight verses contain 72 different padas or grammaticalforms, not counting the prepositions as separate <em>padas</em>. Of these19 have become altogether obsolete in classical Sanskrit, and 12have changed their significations. This, however, is a specimen ofone of the more intelligible hymns, but there are a great manywhich contain a much larger proportion of words that have goneout of use. It is these obsolete words that constitute the chiefdifficulty of understanding the Vedio hymns.</p>
<ol>
<li>The use of <strong>चित्</strong>after <strong>यत्</strong> is unknown to the later dialect,that particle being found joined only to the pronoun <strong>किम्</strong>. Thepreposition <strong>प्र</strong>, though connected with <strong>मिनीमसि</strong>, is separated from it</li>
</ol>
<p>by three words. Though the root of this verb is given in theDhātupāṭha or Pāṇini&rsquo;s list of roots, it has gone out of use. Inmodern Sanskrit we should use <strong>अतिक्रामः</strong>instead. <strong>व्रत</strong> is notnow used in the sense in which it occurs here, though it isconnected with it. We should use <strong>शासन</strong> instead.<strong>द्यविद्यवि</strong> means&rsquo;day by day&rsquo;;in classical Sankrit the word <strong>द्यो</strong> means&rsquo;heaven only. The verse may be translated:— &ldquo;Thoughwho are like subjects break thy law, day after day, O divineVaruṇa!&rdquo; Varuṇa is spoken of frequently as a <em>r</em>ā<em>jan</em>, or king,and men are his subjects, with reference to that attribute of his.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>व<strong>ध</strong>means &lsquo;killing&rsquo;, or &rsquo;execution&rsquo; in classical Sanskrit,but, since <strong>हन्तु</strong> &lsquo;killing&rsquo; qualifies it here, it must mean some suchthing as a weapon or a blow.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>हन्तु</strong> is obsolete. <strong>जिहीलान</strong> is a participle of the Perfect of <strong>हेङ्</strong> or<strong>हीङ्</strong>. The form is obsolete; and a verbal form of the root is notordinarily met with, though a word derived from it does ocour.<strong>हृणान</strong> also is obsolete.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not subject us to the killing blow of the spiteful, nor tothe wrath of the angry,&rdquo; <em>i. e.</em> do not kill us out of spite or wrath.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>क्षत्र</strong> signifies in later Sanskrit the order of the Kṣatriyas orthe warrior caste. Here it is used in the primitive sense of&rsquo;valour&rsquo;, &lsquo;prowess&rsquo;. <strong>नर</strong> does not mean &lsquo;man&rsquo; here, but is usedIn its original sense of <em>manly</em>, <strong>आ</strong> and <strong>करामहे</strong> are separated by aword <strong>मृलीक</strong> &lsquo;favour&rsquo; is obsolete. <strong>चक्षस्</strong>&rsquo;the reach of sight&rsquo;, &lsquo;visual power&rsquo;, has also gone out of use.</li>
</ol>
<p>&ldquo;When shall we call the brave, manly, and far-seeing Varuṇahither to favour us ?&rdquo;</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong>समुद्रियः</strong> This form of the derived adjective is unknown tolater Sanskrit. The genitive singular is formed by changing <strong>ई</strong> to <strong>इय्</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows the path of the birds flying in the sir and ofthe boat on the waters.&rdquo;</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Enforcing his laws, the powerful Varuṇa sits down inhis abode to exercise universal sovereignty.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>अद्भुता</strong>, the termination of the accusative plural, is here dropped; <strong>कर्त्व</strong>is Vedic for <strong>कर्तव्य</strong>; here also <strong>नि</strong>is dropped.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&ldquo;From this place the knowing one sees all secret deeds donor to be done.&rdquo;</p>
<ol start="12">
<li><strong>करत्</strong>and <strong>तारिषत्</strong>are forms of <strong>लेट्</strong>or the Vedicsubjunctive.</li>

<p>&ldquo;May the powerful God make things easy for us all our daysand prolong our lives.&rdquo;</p>
<ol start="19">
<li><strong>श्रुधी</strong>. Conjugated as a root of the second class, with <strong>धि</strong>asthe termination of the imperative singular, lengthened for phoneticpurposes.</li>
</ol>
<p>&ldquo;O Varuṇa, hear this my invocation, and now be propitious.I call on thee, desirous of protection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next form of the language is presented to us in theBrāhmaṇas of the Vedas, such as the Aitareya of the Ṛgvedaand the Śatapatha of the White Yajurveda. A great many ofthose peculiar words which we meet with in the hymns, andwhich are so unintelligible have disappeared, the declensionshave approached the standard of classical Sanskrit, the nominative plural in <strong>असस्</strong>, for instance, and the instrumental plural in <strong>एभिः</strong>having gone out of use. The roots have arranged themselves definitely under certain conjugations. The subjunctivehas mostly become obsolete, though such forms as <strong>निष्पद्यातै</strong>(Śat. I.4.1. 10), and <strong>असत्</strong> (Ait. II. 11) are sometimes met with. Theroots take those forms of the Aorist that Pāṇini assigns to them,and this tense is scrupulously used in the sense mentioned bythat grammarian. Such terminations as <strong>मसि</strong>and the variousmodes of forming the infinitive have disappeared, the ordinaryone in <strong>तुम्</strong> being mostly used (Ait. IV. 8, VIII. 23). Thelanguage is in most respects the same as that usually calledclassical Sanskrit. It is rich in verbal forms of all tenses andmoods. There are however a few peculiarities and archaisms. There are some antiquated words such as <strong>बर्स</strong> &lsquo;an extremity&rsquo;(Ait. II. 2), <strong>अनीक</strong> &lsquo;a shaft,&rsquo; <strong>मन्थाबल</strong> &lsquo;a bat&rsquo; (Ait. III.26); <strong>निष्ठाव</strong>&lsquo;ultimate referee&rsquo; <strong>अववदितृ</strong> &lsquo;one who pronounces a decree,&rsquo; <strong>भगवस्</strong>prosperous&rsquo;, <strong>तत</strong> for <strong>तात</strong>(Ait. V. 14), <strong>इरा</strong> &lsquo;food&rsquo; (Ait. VIII. 7).<strong>शुष्मिण</strong> &lsquo;powerful&rsquo; (Ait. VIII. 8. 23), <strong>मेनि</strong>&lsquo;a destructive instrument,flame&rsquo; (Ait. VIII. 24 ), &amp;c. The dative of feminine nouns is oftenused for the genitive, as <strong>पृथिव्यै राजा स्याः</strong>(Ait. VIII. 23); <strong>सर्वस्यै वाचः… परिगृहीत्यै</strong>; the <strong>त</strong>of the third person singular of the</p>
<p>Ātmanepada is sometimes dropped as in the old dialect, as <strong>सविता वै प्रसवानामीशिे</strong>(Ait. VII. 16); a few roots form their Aorist inanother manner than that mentioned by Pāṇini, as <strong>अज्ञत वा अस्य दन्ताः</strong>( Ait. VII. 14), where <strong>अज्ञत</strong> stands for <strong>अजनिषत अग्रक्षो वै म आत इदं</strong> (Ait. VIII. 23 ) where <strong>अद्रुक्षः</strong>is for <strong>अद्रुहः</strong>; the form of the infinitive governed by the word <strong>ईश्वर</strong>is that which ends in <strong>तोस्र्</strong>as <strong>ईश्वरो ह तु पुरायुषः प्रैतोः</strong>(Ait. VIII. 7); and <strong>ग्रह्</strong>appears in the formof <strong>ग्रभ्</strong> (Ait. III. 26). In the seventh and eighth Pañcikās of the Āitareya Brāhmaṇa some Gāthās or songs are quoted, thelanguage of which is more antiquated than that of the body ofthe work. Notwithstanding these irregularities, these Brāhmaṇasare the best representatives extant of the verbal portion of thatlanguage of which Pāṇini writes the grammar, though he did notmean these when he spoke of the Bhāṣā. But nearly the whole.of that literature which Pāṇini drew from, if he did so at all, hasperished, or to speak more correctly, there is no portion of theextant Sanskrit literature that accurately represents Pāṇini&rsquo;sSanskrit as regards the verb and the Taddhitas or nominal derivatives. Probably the spoken language of his time formed thebasis of his grammar.</p>
<p>The next stage of Sanskrit is presented to us by the work ofYāska, whose language appears to be more ancient than that ofthe rest of the non-Vedic literature. We find a good manyarchaic words and expressions in the Nirukta, such as <strong>उपजन</strong>&lsquo;proximity&rsquo;, <strong>उपेक्षितस्य</strong> in the sense of &lsquo;finding&rsquo; or &lsquo;observing&rsquo;<strong>कर्मन्</strong> &lsquo;signification&rsquo;, <strong>यथो</strong>in the sense of &lsquo;as to&rsquo;,<strong>बिल्म</strong> &lsquo;variety&rsquo;,<strong>उपदेशाय ग्लायन्तः</strong> &lsquo;unable to teach&rsquo;. <strong>शिशिक्ष राज्येन</strong> &lsquo;invested withsovereignty&rsquo;, <strong>नैघण्टुक</strong> &lsquo;subordinate&rsquo;, <strong>अनिर्वाह</strong>&lsquo;celibacy&rsquo;, &amp;c. Thereare also some technical terms which we do not meet with inlater works such as <strong>निवृत्तित्थान</strong>&lsquo;weak terminations&rsquo;, <strong>उपजन</strong> or<strong>उपबन्ध</strong> &lsquo;augment&rsquo;,<strong>नामकरण</strong> &lsquo;a nominal termination&rsquo;, &amp;c. Afterthe time of Yāska, Sanskrit underwent a peculiar change, for theproper understanding of which it is necessary for a timo to consider the styles in which a man may speak or write. There iswhat may be considered as the fluent or flowing style of speech,in which the speaker looks at the actions of men in progress,actions in the course of being done or suffered. A man speakingor writing in this style will use a verb on every occasion. But a</p>
<p>verb may always be analysed into an attribute of the subject andthe connecting link or copula. When one&rsquo;s attention is directedmore to the attribute than to the progress or course of an action,one will use verbal nouns or adjectives. Thus instead of <strong>अश्वमारुक्षत्</strong>aman may say <strong>अश्वमारूढः</strong>,instead of <strong>सोऽवोचत्, उक्तं तेन</strong>, instead of<strong>अयंमांसं भक्षयति मांसभक्षकोयम्</strong>;instead of <strong>मालामग्रथ्नात्, मालां ग्रथितवान्</strong>&amp;c. In the same way a verb may be divided into a noun oradjective denoting the special action it involves, and a verbsignifying action generally, as <strong>पचति</strong>, may be analysed Into<strong>पाकं करोति</strong> or <strong>पक्वंकरोति</strong> and <strong>पच्यते</strong> into <strong>पक्वोभवति</strong>, The later Sanskrit andthe modern Vernaculars are full of such formations. The caseforms may also be similarly analysed into attributive expressions;as <strong>राज्ञः पुरुषः</strong> into <strong>राजसंबन्धी पुरुषः</strong> or <strong>रामेण कृतः कट</strong>: into <strong>रामकर्तृकः कटः</strong>The mode of thought which gives birth to such forms of expression leads also to a freer use of compound nouns by means of whicha whole sentence may be compressed into a small attribute. Inargumentation the ablative of an abstract noun saves a longperiphrasis. This may be considered a petrified form of speech,and as distinguished from the verbal style it may be called thenominal style. In the earliest literature of Sanskrit the fluentor verbal style prevailed. Since this rarely admits of attributiveor nominal expressions, the sentences are short, and the construction easy. Thus, in such books as the Aitareya and Śatapatha Brāhmaṇas, we find short sentences, and an abundance ofverbal forms. Even in the time of Yāska this style prevailed toa large extent, and notwithstanding that his book is on a scientific subject, his language often reminds one of that of the earlierworks, though he must have written serval centuries afterwards.In the time of Pāṇini also verbal forms were in general use, as I shall presently attempt to show. Some time after, however,the petrified or nominal style began to supplant the other. Somehow it commended itself to the genius of the Indian Āryas of thetimes, and the very richness and flexibility of Sanskrit, which allows of a root or noun being twisted in a variety of ways tosuit any sort of construction, greatly facilitated the change. TheItihāsas, the Purāṇas, and the metrical Smṛtis are written in thisstyle. But here it is not carried to such an extravagant extentas is done in later writings, in some of which verbal forms are</p>
<p>rare and in others long and bewildering compounds are frequently met with,andthe construction is complicated and involved.This is the general character of the Sanskrit in which the subsequent poetic and dramatic literature is written and if thelanguage of a certain author is graceful and easy, and not dulland involved, if he does not use long compounds, and writes in amore natural style, it is either because his taste is superior to thatof his contemporaries, or because he belongs to an earlier period.</p>
<p>But it was in the field of philosophy. dialectics and exegesis,scriptural or grammatical, that this nominal style was greatlycultivated and developed. The earliest work of the kind weknow of is Patañjali&rsquo;s Mahābhāṣya on Kātyāyana&rsquo;s Vārtikas ornotes on Pāṇini&rsquo;s Sūtras. Nearly the whole of the philosophicalliterature of the Sanskrit is written more or less in the style ofdisputation. An Indian author does not lead his readers into theprocesses his own mind has gone through in arriving at thedoctrines he lays down; in other words, he does not tell us how hehas come by the opinions he holds, but lays down these doctrinesand sets forth those opinions and conceives objections that maybe raised and answers them. Or before actually stating the truedoctrine or <em>siddhānta</em>, certain others, more or less opposed arestated, and reasons given in support of them (<em>pūrvapakṣa</em>) whichare, of course, refuted. The Mahābhāṣya is written in this manner,but it differs in a good many respects from later works of thekind. Unlike the latter, it gives the very words that an opponent,speaking in his own person, may be expected to use. It therefore really consists of a series of dialogues, often smart, betweenone who maintains the <em>pūrvapakṣa</em>, and another who laysdown the <em>siddh</em>ā<em>nta</em>. Hence, the language is plain andsimple, and the sentences are short, and such as anaturally use in ordinary conversation or oral disputation. Thenominal style, however, as I have ventured to call it, in contradistinction to that of the Brāhmaṇas and also of Yāska, isobservable; but it has of course not yet degenerated into thelong compounds and algebraic expressions of modern times, andis perfectly natural. In this respect it keeps pace with thelanguage of the Itihässs and Smṛtis. Vātsyāyana&rsquo;s Bhāṣya on Gotama&rsquo;s Nyāya Sūtra, and Śabarasvāmin&rsquo;s on that of Jaimini,</p>
<p>as well as the Bhāṣyas on some of the sacrificial Sūtras, arewritten in the same sort of simple and lively style, though however they present a further stage in the downward progress. Butgradually this manner of writing ceased to be used, and thephilosophical style went on progressing until it has come to bewhat it is now. Śaṁkarācārya&rsquo;s Bhāṣya presents it in a middlestage. The sentences are much longer than those of the earlierwriters, the construction is more involved, there is a freer useof attributive adjuncts, and the form is that of an essay or alecture, instead of an oral disputation. But the great Ācārya&rsquo;sstyle is perspicuous throughout, fluent and charming, and notsolidified or petrified, as that of later writers is. These latterhardly ever use a verb, and of the cases only a few are to be met with in their works. The nominative and ablative singularprevail, and long compounds are constantly employed. All ourideas are thrown into the form of nouns, mostly abstract, andeven the participles have become rare. This style is the styleof formulas rather than of discourse. It has reached its climaxin the works of recent <em>Naiyāyikas</em>, but it has been more or less usedby modern writers in all the Śāstras. The movement which beganwith a less frequent use of verbal forms and the employmentof attributive expressions has thus ended in making Sanskrita language of abstract nouns and compound words.</p>
<p>I have used the word style in describing this movement, toshow what important changes in the structure of a languagemay originate from what is in the beginning but a style ormode of speaking or writing. If everybody thought and spokeabout all matters as the Naiyāyika does in his own subject, ourlanguage would be just like his. It would almost have no verbs,no participles, and no cases except one or two. But it is not so.The movement could not be carried so far in other subjects.Hence the real classical Sanskrit is the Sanskrit of the Epics,the Purāṇas, the metrical law-books, the better or earlier specimens of Kāvyas or poems and dramatic plays, and of the earlyphilosophical or exegetical worksAnd if we examine thisliterature we shall find that the greater use of attributive ornominal forms of expression gradually drove out a large portionof the Sanskrit verb, and gave a new character to the language,</p>
<p>which may be thus described:— Very few verbal forms are usedbesides those of such tenses as the Present and Future; participles are frequently met with the verbal forms of some roots,especially of those belonging to the less comprehensive classeshave gone out of use, and in their place we often have a nounexpressive of the special action and a verb expressive of actiongenerally compound words are somewhat freely employed; anda good many of the Taddhita forms or nominal derivatives havedisappeared, and in their stead we have periphrastic expressions.If the treatises of Pāṇini and others had perished, and we had toconstruct a grammar of the Sanskrit from the classical literatureI have above indicated, our Verb and the Taddhita portionwould be very mengre. Professor Benfey attributes the conditionwhich the language thus assumed to the influence of the Prakritaor the spoken vernaculars. But the process appears to me perfectly natural, and no such influence need be supposed. Thechange may in some respects be likened to that which renderedthe Vedic subjunctive and other grammatical forms obsolete inthe later stage of the language. The Prakrits may have givensome words to the Sanskrit, but that they should in this mannerhave influenced its grammatical structure is very unlikely. Itis more natural to suppose that it was the Sanskrit, from whichthe Prakrits evidently sprang, which gave to these latter theirpeculiar character. I shall endeavour to determine the exactrelation between the Sanskrit and these dialects in the concluding lecture.</p>
<p>We have thus observed and determined the change that cameover Sanskrit after the period that elapsed between the Brāhmaṇasand Yāska from an examination of the literature itself. But thefact is borne witness to by Kätyäyana, who observed it in histime and made it the subject of a few <em>vārtikas.</em> Patañjali discussesthe points raised in the following manner.An objector or<em>Pūrvapakṣin</em> is introduced, who says:</p>
<p>PŪRV. <strong>अस्त्यप्रयुक्तः</strong>।There exist (some) words which are notused; for instance, <strong>ऊष, तेर, चक्र, पेच</strong>.(These are forms of thesecond person plural of the Perfect.)</p>
<p>The <em>Siddhāntin</em>, or the principal teacher, who advocates thedoctrine that is finally laid down asks:—</p>
<p>SID. What if they are not used?</p>
<p>PŪRV. You determine the grammatical correctness of wordsfrom their being used. Those then that are not now used are notgrammatically correct.</p>
<p>SID. What you say is, in the first place, inconsistent, viz.,that words exist which are not used. If they exist they cannotbe not used; if not used, they cannot exist. To say that theyexist and are not used is inconsiste You yourself use them(utter them) and say (in the very breath) there are words whichare not used. What other worthy like yourself would you haveto use them in order that they might be considered correct (lit.What other person like yourself is correct or is an authority in the use of words)?</p>
<p>PŪRV. — This is not inconsistent. I say they exist since thosewho know the Śāstra teach their formation by [laying down]rules, and I say they are not used, because they are not usedby people. Now with regard to [your remark], &ldquo;What otherworthy, &amp;o.&rdquo; [ when I say they are not used ] I do not mean thatthey are not used by me.</p>
<p>SID.— What then?</p>
<p>PŪRV.— Not used by people.</p>
<p>SID.— Verily, you also are one amongst the people.</p>
<p>PŪRV.— Yes, I am one, but am not <em>the</em> <em>people.</em></p>
<p>SID.— ( Vārt, <strong>अस्त्यप्रयुक्त इति चेन्नार्थेशब्दप्रयोगात्</strong> ) If youobjectthat they are not used, it will not do (the objection is not valid).</p>
<p>PŪRV.— Why not ?</p>
<p>SID.— Because words are used to designate things. The thingsdo exist which these words are used to designate.the words must be used by somebody. If the things exist, theThewords that denote them must exist).</p>
<p>PŪRV.— (Vārt. <strong>अप्रयोगः प्रयोगान्यत्वात्</strong>). (It does not follow.) Theirnon-use is what one can reasonably infer.</p>
<p>SID.— Why?</p>
<p>PŪRV.— Because they (people) use other words to designatethe things expressed by these words; for instance, <strong>क्व यूयमुषिता</strong>; in</p>
<p>the sense of <strong>ऊष;क्व यूयं तीर्णाः</strong>in the sense of <strong>तेर; क्वयूयंकृतवन्तः</strong> in thein the sense of <strong>चक्रः, क्व यूयं पक्ववन्तः</strong> in the sence of <strong>पेच</strong>.(We here see thatparticiples had come to be used for verbs of the Perfect Tense.)</p>
<p>SID.—(Vārt. <strong>अप्रयुक्ते दीर्घसत्रवत्</strong>) Even if these words are notused, they should be essentially taught by rules just as longsacrificial sessions are. It is in this way. Long sacrificialsessions are such as last for a hundred years and for a thousandyears. In modern times none whatever holds them, but thewriters on sacrifices teach them by rules, simply because I tolearn what has been handed down by tradition from Ṛṣis isreligiously meritorious. And moreover (Vārt. <strong>सर्वे देशान्तरे</strong>) allthese words are used in other places.</p>
<p>PŪRV.— They are not found used.</p>
<p>SID.— An endeavour should be made to find them. Wideindeed is the range over which words are used; the earth withits seven continents, the three worlds, the four Vedas with theiraṅgas or dependent treatises and the mystic portions, in theirvarious recensions, the one hundred branches of the Adhvaryu(Yajur-Veda), the Sāma-Veda with its thousand modes, theBāhvṛcya with its twenty-one varieties, and the Ātharvaṇa.Voda with nine, Vākovākya, the Epics, the Purāṇas and Medicine.This is the extent over which words are used. Without searchingthis extent of the use of words, to say that words are notused is simple rashness. In this wide extent of the use ofwords, certain words appear restricted to certain senses incertain places. Thus, rafa is used in the sense of motionamong the Kambojas; the Āryas use it in the derived formof <strong>शव;हम्मति</strong> is used among the Surāṣṭras, <strong>रंहति</strong> among theeastern and central people, but the Āryas use only <strong>गम्; दाति</strong>isused in the sense of &lsquo;cutting&rsquo; among the easterns, <strong>दात्र</strong> among thenortherners. And those words which you think are not used arealso seen used.</p>
<p>PŪRV.— Where?</p>
<p>SID.—In the Vadn. Thus, <strong>सप्तात्ये रेवती रेवदूंष ।यद्वोरेवती रेवत्यां तमूष । यन्मे नरः श्रुत्यं ब्रह्म चक्र । यत्रा नश्चक्राजरसंतनूनाम्</strong> ।</p>
<p>We here see that the objector says that certain words orforms are not used by people, and therefore they should not be</p>
<p>taught or learnt. The instances that he gives are forms of theperfect of some roots, and he observes that the sense of theseforms is expressed by using other words which are perfect participles of these roots. These statements are not denied by the Siddhāntin, but he does not allow that the forms should not betaught on the account. Though not used, they should be taughtand learnt for the sake of the religious merit consequent thereon,just as the ceremonial of long sacrificial sessions, which are neverheld, is. Then the objector is told that though not used by people, the words may be ourrent in some other country, continent, or world, or they must have been used somewhere in thevast literature of the language. As regards the particular instances, two of them are shown to be used in the Vedas.</p>
<p>It thus follows that in the time of Kātyāyana and Patañjali,such verbal forins had become obsolete, and participles were usedin their place. But it must have been far otherwise in the timeof Pāṇini. He gives minute rules for constructing the innumerable forms of the Sanskrit verb. Our grammarians proceededupon a strictly scientific basis. Nothing is more clear fromseveral observations scattered throughout the work of Patañjali,besides those contained in the above passage, than this, that theIndian Grammarians do not give us the inventions of their ownbrains as they are supposed by some scholars to do. The veryperfection of their observation and analysis has rendered themliable to this reproach. But notwithstanding all that, there canbe no doubt whatever that they scrupulously adhered to usage.If so, the verbal forms taught by Pāṇini must have been currentin the language at some time. We do meet with them in theBrāhmaṇas, but our grammarian does not include these formsamong the peculiarities he has given of the Vedic or Chandas andBrāhmaṇa dialect, and thus does not restrict them to those works.They must therefore be understood as having been in use in theBhāṣā or current language, the grammar of which he teaches inhis Sūtras. And the Bhāṣāthat he means must be that whichwas current in his time. In Pāṇini&rsquo;s time, therefore, the fluentor verbal style of speech was in use, as I have observed before.But it may be argued that though he refers these forms to theBhāṣā, the Bhāṣāhe means may not be that which prevailed</p>
<p>when he lived, but another current before his time and preservedin its literature, on which Pāṇini based his rules. It mattersvery little even if we make this supposition. The only effect isthat the period when the non-Vedic Sanskrit was rich in verbalforms is placed before Pāṇini; but the fact itself that there wassuch a period is undeniable. The supposition, however, is unreasonable. For it is not at all likely that he should neglect thelanguage prevalent in his time and teach that which was currentbefore him, and speak of it as the Bhāṣā, which word literallysignifies the &ldquo;spoken language&rdquo; or vernacular. And the occurrence in the Sūtras of words that became obsolete in laterSanskrit confirms this view. The following are such words:—<strong>अन्ववसर्ग</strong> &lsquo;allowing one his own way&rsquo;, <strong>निरवसित</strong> &rsquo;excommunicated,&rsquo;<strong>प्रत्यवसान</strong> &rsquo;eating,&rsquo; <strong>अभिविधि</strong> &lsquo;including,&rsquo; <strong>स्वकरण</strong> &lsquo;marrying&rsquo;, <strong>उत्सञ्जन</strong>&rsquo;throwing up&rsquo;, <strong>अभ्रेष</strong> &rsquo;equitableness.&rsquo; You will have seen thatthe Vārtika of Kātyāyana which starts the discussion I have translated, and Patañjali&rsquo;s comment on it speak of wordsgenerally as having ceased to be used, though the examples givenconsist of certain verbal forms only. It is, therefore, to be understood that the observation is applicable to other forms andexpressions also taught by Pāṇini which we do not meet with inthe later literature¹.Among such may be noticed <strong>उपाजेकृ</strong>and<strong>अन्याजेकृ</strong>&rsquo;to strengthen&rsquo;, <strong>निवचनेकृ</strong>&rsquo;to be silent&rsquo;, <strong>कणेहन्</strong> and <strong>मनोहन्</strong>&rsquo;to fulfil one&rsquo;s longing,&rsquo; &amp;c. <strong>कणेहन्</strong> occurs in Yāskaalso. Mostof the verbal derivatives ending in the technical termination<strong>णमुल्</strong> must also be so considered, such as <strong>ब्राह्मणवेदं भोजयति</strong>&lsquo;feedsevery Brähmaṇa that he finds, <strong>चेलक्नोपं वृष्ट</strong>,&lsquo;rained till the clotheswere wet,&rsquo; <strong>स्वपोषं पुष्णाति</strong> &lsquo;supports by his own means,&rsquo; <strong>उर्ध्वशोषं शुष्यति</strong>&lsquo;withers standing&rsquo;, &amp;c. A good many Taddhita forms taught inPāṇini&rsquo;s Sütras must also, I think, be put in the same category.</p>
<p>And there is another circumstance which shows that Pāṇini&rsquo;sSanskrit was more ancient than Kātyāyana&rsquo;s. Kātyāyana&rsquo;sVärlikas on Pāṇini, which I have already spoken to you of, touchon various points concerning grammar and the system of Pāṇini.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1. Professor Goldstucker has used the argument based on the occurrence ofobsolete words in the Sūtras and that set forth in the next paragraph, toprove the archaic character of the language as is existed in Pāṇini&rsquo;s timeand some of the instances quoted in the text are the same as his.</p>
<p>The purpose of a great many of them is the proper interpretationof the Sūtras, and there are some which supply links that arewanting in the system, also a good many which teach forms nottaught by Pāṇini, or give the correct forms, when by the strictapplication of Pāṇini&rsquo;s rules we arrive at such as are incorrect.Now, this strict application of Pāṇini&rsquo;s rules is often in themanner of a quibbling logician, and consequently it was probablynever meant by Pāṇini himself. Again, it may also be allowedthat some forms existing in the language may have escapedPāṇini&rsquo;s notice. But even after making allowance for all theseconsiderations, a good many forms taught by Kātyāyana areleft which it is impossible to believe Pāṇini did not observe orknow, if they existed in the language in his time. Though notinfallible, Pāṇini was not an indifferent grammarian. He justlydeserves the reputation he has all along enjoyed of being the preeminent teacher of grammar. He has noticed oven stray factsabout the language. If so, the only reasonable supposition isthat these forms did not exist in the language at the period whenhe lived.</p>
<p>For instance, according to Pāṇini&rsquo;s rules the vocative singularof neuter nouns ending in <strong>अन्</strong> such as <strong>ब्रह्मन्</strong> and <strong>नामन्</strong> is <strong>ब्रह्मन्</strong>andbut Ktyāyana in a Vārtikāon VIII. 2, 8 tells us it is<strong>ब्रह्मन्</strong> or <strong>ब्रह्म</strong> and <strong>नामन्</strong> or <strong>नाम</strong>.</p>
<p>Pāṇini teaches that the forms of the dative, ablative, genitiveand locative singular of the feminine of <strong>द्वितीय</strong> and <strong>तृतीय</strong> areoptionally like those of the corresponding pronouns, <em>i. e.</em> we haveeither <strong>द्वितीयायै</strong> or <strong>द्वितीयस्यै</strong>, <strong>द्वितीयायाः</strong>or <strong>द्वितीयस्याः</strong> &amp;c., but Kātyāyanain a Vārtika on 1. 1. 36 extends this option to the masculine also,and according to him we have <strong>द्वितीयाय</strong> OF <strong>द्वितीयस्मै</strong> or <strong>द्वितीयात्</strong>or<strong>द्वितीयस्मात्</strong>&amp;o., while Pāṇini gives us only the first.</p>
<p>Pāṇini&rsquo;s rule IV. 1, 49 allows of <strong>मातुलानी</strong> only as the feminineof <strong>मातुल</strong>, but Kātyāyans gives <strong>मातुली</strong> also ; <strong>उपाध्यापानी</strong> is not noticedby Pāṇini while Kātyāyans lays down that as well as <strong>उपाध्यायी</strong>inthe sense of &lsquo;wife of the <strong>उपाध्याय</strong>&rsquo;, So also <strong>आर्या</strong> und <strong>क्षत्रिया</strong> areaccording to Pāṇini, &lsquo;a female Ārya&rsquo; and a female Kṣatriya,&lsquo;but Kātyāyans gives <strong>आर्याणी</strong> and <strong>क्षत्रियाणी</strong> as well as <strong>आर्या</strong>and <strong>क्षत्रिया</strong>.</p>
<p>A good many more instances of a similar nature may begiven from other parts of Sanskrit Grammar. Are we then tosuppose that the forms <strong>ब्रह्म, नाम, कर्म</strong>&amp;c. of the vocativesingular, <strong>द्वितीयस्मै</strong> of the dative of <strong>द्वितीय</strong> &amp;o, <strong>मातुली, उपाध्यायानी,आर्याणी, क्षत्रियाणी</strong> and many more such, escaped the observation of such a grammarian as Pāṇini, or that he did notknow them? Is the supposition that they did not exist in thelanguage in his time not more reasonable? It therefore appearsclear to me that the language in Pāṇini&rsquo;s time was in a differentcondition from that in which it was in Kātyāyana&rsquo;s. The chiefdifferences, to point out which has been the object of this discussion, may be thus stated:— In Pāṇini&rsquo;s time a good manywords and expressions were current which afterwards becameobsolete; verbal forms were commonly used which ceased to beused in Kātyāyana&rsquo;s time, and some grammatical forms weredeveloped in the time of the latter, which did not exist inPāṇini&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Pāṇini&rsquo;s Sanskrit must, therefore, be identified with that whichpreceded the Epics, and he must be referred to the literary periodbetween the Brāhmaṇas and Yāska. Hence it is that the Brāhmaṇas, as observed before, are the best existing representativesof the language of which Pāṇini writes the grammar. Kātyāyana,on the other hand, wrote when the language arrived at that stagewhich we have called Classical.</p>
<p>Thus then, we have been able to trace three distinct periodsin the development of Sanskrit. First, we have the Vedio period,to which the Ṛgveda Saṁhitā, the Mantra portion of the Yajurveda, and the more antiquated part of the Atharva-Saṁhitāareto be referred. Then commences another period, at the thresholdof which we find the Brähmaṇas, which, so to say, look backwards to the preceding, that is, they present the Vedic languagein the last stage of its progress towards Pāṇini&rsquo;s Bhāṣā; andlater on, we have Yāska and Pāṇini. This may be called theperiod of Middle Sanskrit. And last of all, there is the Classicalperiod to which belong the Epics, the earliest specimens ofKāvyas and dramatic plays, the metrical Smṛtis, and the grammatical work of Kātyāyana.</p>
<p>Pāṇini&rsquo;s work contains the grammar of Middle Sanskrit, whileKātyāyana&rsquo;s that of Classical Sanskrit, though he gives hissanction to the archaic forms of the former on the principle, as hehimself has stated, on which the authors of the sacrificial Sūtrasteach the ritual of long sacrificial sessions, though they hadceased to be held in their time. Patañjali gives but few formswhich differ from Kātyāyana&rsquo;s, and in no way do they indicatea different stage in the growth of the language; hence his workis to be referred to the same period. The form which the languageassumed at this time became the standard for later writers tofollow, and Kātyāyana and Patañjali are now generally acknowledged authorities on all points concerning the correctness ofSanskrit speech. We shall hereafter see that the last two stageshave left distinct traces on the Prakrits or the derived languages.</p>
<p><strong>LECTURE</strong></p>
<p><strong>PALI AND THE DIALECTS OF THE PERIOD</strong></p>
<p>In the last lecture we traced the development of the Sanskritlanguage until it assumed the form in which it is usually calledClassical Sanskrit. This form it acquired several centuriesbefore Christ, as I shall hereafter endeavour to show, but it hassince preserved it unaltered. The reason is that the number ofpeople using it has been growing smaller and smaller, and nowfor a considerable period, it has remained confined to a fewlearned men who devote long time to its study and use it onlyfor religious and philosophical purposes. But in so far as It hasbeen used for these purposesit has not been free from change, aswas pointed out on the last occasion. The style and modes ofexpression used by Gadadhara Bhaṭṭācārya, the great Naiyãyikaof modern times, are not the same as those of Kaṇaḍa, Gotams,and Vātsyāyana, nor those used by Nāgojibhatts, the same asthose of Kātyāyana and Patañjali. But all these changes haverfollowed one direction. The efforts of our modern writers havebeen mostly, if not altogether, directed to systematizing andreducing to an accurate and definite shape the conceptions ofthose ancient sages, and no new ideas or methods of thought have arisen. They have thus elaborated a highly artificial style,abounding in abstract terms. In other branches of the literaturealso, we may discover some peculiarities and corruptions ofdiction and manner. But still, making due allowance for allthis, the generally received standard of good and correct Sanskritis the same as it was many centuries ago. There are certainmodels which modern writers and speakers have to conform to.</p>
<p>When, however, a language is living, that is, is used bypeople generally and in matters of every-day life, it must undergo very great changes. Men will not waste time and trouble inaccurately ascertaining and imitating the pronunciation of theirfathers, or reproducing exactly the several grammatical formsused by their predecessors. All that is necessary is that theyshould make themselves understood. Old modes of thinking give</p>
<p>place to new ones, and ideas spring up; and both must be represented in the language that is used. Sometimes accidentasin the history of a race, such as its coming in contact or beingincorporated with another race, serve to transform its languagewithin a short time. But the alterations that occur from theseand other causes obey certain laws; and hence the possibility of aScience of Language.</p>
<p>Now, by the operation of influences such as these. Sanskritwas, in very remote times, corrupted, and new dialects arosefrom it. We should have known nothing of these if they had notbeen preserved in their literatures. Of these dialects that which approaches Sanskrit the most is the Pali. This is the sacredlanguage of the Buddhists of Ceylon, Siam, and Burma, andpossesses an extensive literature.</p>
<p>I will introduce my remarks on this dialect by placing beforeyou speoimen :—</p>
<p><strong>सावत्थियं किर अदिण्णपुब्बको नाम ब्राह्मणी अहोसि। तेन कस्साचे किंचिददिग्णपुब्बंतेन तं अदिण्णपुब्बको त्वेव सं जानिंसु । तस्सेकपुत्तको अहोसि पियोमनापो । … तस्स सोलसवस्सकाले पण्डुरोगो उदपादि। माता पुत्तंओलोकेत्वाब्राह्मण पुत्तस्स ते रोगो उप्पन्नो तिकिच्छापेहि नन्ति आह। भोति सचे वेज्जं आनेस्सामिभत्तवेतनं दातब्बंभविस्सति । त्वं मम धनच्छेदनं न ओलोकेसीति । अथ किं करिस्ससिब्राह्मणा ति । यथा में धनच्छेदो न होति तथा करिस्सामीति । सो बेज्जानं सन्तिकं गन्त्वाअमुकरोगस्स नाम तुझे कि भेसज्जंकरोधाति पुच्छि । अथस्स ते यं वा रुक्खतञ्चादिंआचिक्खन्ति । सो तं आहरित्वा पुत्तस्स भेसज्जं करोति । तं करोन्तस्सेबस्स रोगोबलवा अहोसि ।</strong></p>
<p>This is from the Aṭṭhakathāor commentary by Buddhaghoṣaon the Dhammapada. It was written in the fifth century afterChrist, long after Pali had ceased to be &amp; vernaculsr. The following is from the Dhammspada itself, which we have reason tobeliove is much more ancient :—</p>

<p><strong>(A)</strong></p>
<p><strong>PHONOLOGY OF THE PALI DIALECT</strong></p>
<p>Here you will see a great many instances of the laws we laiddown in the last lecture. And first, as regards phonetic corruption, we have in these passages <strong>त्त</strong> for <strong>त्र</strong> as in <strong>पुत्त</strong>for <strong>पुत्र</strong>, for <strong>क्त</strong> asin <strong>भत्त</strong>for <strong>भक्त</strong>, and for <strong>प्त</strong> as in <strong>पत्त</strong> for <strong>प्राप्त</strong> and <strong>प्प</strong> for <strong>त्प</strong> as in <strong>उप्पन्न</strong>for <strong>उत्पन्न</strong>. This change is usually called assimilation of consonants.</p>
<p>In pronouncing a conjunct, one has to pass from one positionof the vocal organs to another without letting off the breathchecked or compressed in the first, an operation of great difficulty.The sound of the first member is indistinct, but when the secondis a weak consonant such as a nasal or a semi-vowel, it glidesinto the first almost as a vowel does, and thus the sound of thefirst acquires greater prominence. In the first position, the vocalorgans strike and press againt each other strongly, and themomentum necessary for this effort is acquired by uttering forcibly and with a jerk the vowel that precedes the conjunct, <em>i. e</em>. <strong>अ</strong>for instance in the word <strong>भक्त</strong>, just as aman previous to strikingand pressing anything with his fist moves the hand with forcethrough some distance. The previous forcible vowel breath andthe subsequent strong contact and pressure form the characteristicof a conjunct consonantal sound. This is the only way of rendering the two members at all distinct, for the first is thus utteredwith the preceding vowel and the second with the following,</p>
<p>Thus, <strong>भक्त</strong>pronounced in the manner I have described becomes <strong>मक्-त</strong>,but, if the previous vowel sound is weak, it becomes <strong>भ-क्त</strong>,in which case, in consequence of the absence of momentum, thepressure cannot be strong, and the conjunct character is not fullybrought out.</p>
<p>What we find in the Pali, therefore, is that the passage fromone vocal position to another is avoided, and the more distinctsound only, whether of the first member or the second, is pronounced with this forcible previous vowel breath and the succeeding strong contact and pressure; that is, we have a conjunctas before, but it is made up not of two different letters, but oftwo of the same kind. Hence the instances noted above and also <strong>धम्म</strong> for <strong>धर्म</strong>, <strong>जम्म</strong> for <strong>जन्म</strong>, <strong>यञ्त्र</strong>for <strong>यज्ञ</strong>, <strong>सदृ</strong>for <strong>शब्द</strong>, <strong>दुद्ध</strong> for <strong>दुग्ध,</strong> <strong>खग्ग</strong>for <strong>खड्ग, मुग्ग</strong> for <strong>मुद्र, अब्भुत</strong> for <strong>अद्भुत, लद्ध</strong>for <strong>लब्ध, उक्का</strong> for उ<strong>ल्का, अप्प</strong>for <strong>अल्प, तप्पन</strong> for <strong>तर्पण, अय्य</strong> for <strong>आर्य</strong> &amp;c. But an attempt is made topronounce the other sound also, and such of its elements as cango in, with that which is uttered without involving changeof position, are transferred to it, that is, in effect, the Pali speakertreated a conjunct consonant as one sound possessing the characteristics of both. Thus the heavy <em>śvāsa</em> or simple breath of <strong>स्, श्,<strong>and <strong>ष्</strong> in the conjuncts <strong>स्क्, ष्क्, श्च्, ष्ट्, स्त्, स्प्</strong> and <strong>ष्प्</strong> is combined withthe distinct sounds <strong>क्, च्, द्, त्</strong>, and <strong>प्</strong>, and we have <strong>ख्, छ्, द्, श्</strong>, and <strong>फ्</strong>for those conjuncts; but, when preceded by a vowel and pronounced with the usual conjunctal characteristic, they become</strong>क्ख,च्छ, ट्ठ, त्थ</strong>, and <strong>प्फ्</strong>; as in <strong>सावत्थियं</strong> for <strong>श्रावस्त्याम्</strong> and <strong>फुसेय्यु</strong>for<strong>स्पृशेयुः</strong>in the sbove, and in <strong>खन्ध</strong> for <strong>स्कन्ध,</strong> <strong>पोक्खर</strong> for <strong>पुष्कर, पच्छा</strong> for<strong>पश्वात्, अच्छरिय</strong> for <strong>आश्वर्य, दिट्ठ</strong>for <strong>दिष्ट, पुट्ठ</strong>for <strong>पुष्ट, मत्थक</strong> for <strong>मस्तक, वत्थु</strong>for <strong>वस्तु फन्द</strong>नfor <strong>स्पन्दन,</strong> and <strong>पुप्फ</strong> for <strong>पुष्प</strong>.</p>
<p>In <strong>न, श्न, ष्ण, स्म, श्म,</strong> and <strong>ष्म,</strong> the consonantal portion of thedistinct sounds, being made up of <em>nāda</em>or intonated breath, theheavy <em>śvāsa</em>or simple breath of the sibilant is first made heavy<em>nāda</em>, that is, the sibilant is changed to the aspirate and we have<strong>न्ह्, ण्ह्</strong>, or <strong>स्ह्</strong> for these conjuncts; as in <strong>पञ्ह</strong>for <strong>प्रश्न, उण्ह</strong>for <strong>उष्णअम्हि</strong> for <strong>अस्मि, अम्ह</strong> for <strong>अश्म</strong>, and <strong>गिम्ह</strong>for <strong>ग्रीष्म</strong>. These correspondto the <strong>त्व, छ</strong> &amp;c., in the above instances, and must, like them, beconsidered as simple sounds, and in our modern languages theyare pronounced as such in certain places, but when preceded by</p>
<p>a vowel they must have, as in other cases, the characteristic ofconjunctal sounds, and be pronounced as <strong>न्न्ह, ण्ण्ह</strong> or <strong>म्म्ह</strong> thoughthey are not so written.</p>
<p>I have already observed that when a following semi-vowel ornasal glides into the sound of the first consonant, this latteracquires prominence. But there are cases in which the semivowel <strong>य्</strong> does not so merge into the preceding; and this takesplace when it is preceded by a dental mute. The palatal <strong>य्</strong> andthe labial <strong>त्</strong> have since remote times been often pronounced intwo ways;— one in which the organs approach each other soclosely that it is difficult to distinguish them from <strong>ज्</strong> and <strong>ब्</strong>; andanother in which they are kept more distant. Hence the confusion between य् and <strong>ज्</strong> and व् and <strong>ब्</strong> that we find so often inmodern pronunciation and in the modern languages. TheBengali invariably makes <strong>ब्</strong> of the Sanskrit <strong>व्</strong>and in most cases<strong>ज्</strong> of <strong>य्</strong> and the people of Northern India follow him to a greatextent. In the Hindi we have many such forms as <strong>जमुना</strong>for <strong>यमुना,बांस</strong> for <strong>वंश, बांझ</strong> for <strong>बन्ध्या</strong>.</p>
<p>The heavy or close pronunciation of <strong>य्</strong>, is favoured by a preceding dental. In pronouncing letters of this class the tongue isnearly horizontal. Consequently, when after the formation of thedental mute it is moved upwards to form <strong>य्</strong>, the force with whichit separates from the teeth carries it nearer to the palate than itshould be. In the cerebral position, in which, the tongue formsa curve with the concave side inwards, the force with which itstip separates acts downwards; hence if a <strong>य्</strong> has to be pronouncedafterwards, the effort is in no way aided, but, if possible, hindered.In this case, therefore, the <strong>य्</strong> is always light; and for a similarreason, it is so when preceded by a guttural. It is also lightwhen preceded by the dental <strong>न्</strong>, since a large portion of theobstructed breath passes through the nose, and the tongue is notseparated from the teeth with any force. Thus in the word <strong>वैद्य</strong> inthe passage I have placed before you, and in <strong>अद्य, पद्य</strong> &amp;e. the <strong>य्</strong>being heavy, does not glide or merge into <strong>द्</strong>, and, being the latterof two successive consonantal sounds, acquires greater distinotness; and the preceding sound must, in virtue of the laws wehave been examining, communicate all its elements to it, except</p>
<p>of course the organic position. The element that is communicatedin this case is the complete contact, wherefore the heavy <strong>य्</strong> becomes a complete <strong>ज्</strong>, and this, when pronounced like a conjunctbecomes **ज्ज्,**In such words as <strong>मध्य, बध्य, उपाध्याय</strong> &amp;c., the preceding has got its heaviness of <em>nāda</em> or tone to communicatebesides the complete contact, and thus the <strong>ज्</strong> becomes <strong>झ्</strong> andthence <strong>ज्झ्</strong>; and so we have <strong>मज्झ, वज्झ, उपज्झाय</strong> &amp;c.In <strong>मृत्यु, प्रेत्य, सत्य</strong>&amp;c., to the <strong>ज्</strong> formed as above must be added the hardness or<em>śvāsa</em> of त्, i. e. the letter <strong>ज्</strong> must be pronounced not with theglottis contracted but stretched, wherefore we have च्and, withthe conjunctal characteristic, <strong>च्च्</strong>. Those words therefore become <strong>मच्चु, पेच्च</strong>,and <strong>सच्च</strong>. If <strong>य्</strong> precedes instead of <strong>त्</strong>, the heavy <em>śvāsa</em> requiredfor its pronunciation is transferred to <strong>ज्</strong>, and so it becomes <strong>छ्</strong>, andthence <strong>च्छ</strong>; as in <strong>रच्छा</strong> for <strong>रथ्पा, नेपच्छ</strong> for <strong>नेपथ्य</strong> &amp;c.</p>
<p>The semi-vowel <strong>व्</strong>is also heavily pronounced when it formsa conjunct with another semi-vowel, and thus we have <strong>पुब्ब</strong>for <strong>पूर्व</strong>, <strong>सब्ब</strong> for <strong>सर्व</strong>, &amp;c. There are also instances of this pronunciationwhen <strong>व्</strong> is preceded by a dental mute as in <strong>उब्बेग</strong>for <strong>उद्वेग,</strong> <strong>सब्भि</strong>for <strong>सद्भिः</strong>&amp;c. In <strong>ऊर्ध्व</strong> the preceding <strong>ध्</strong>, as in <strong>मध्य</strong>, transfers its heavy<em>nāda</em> or tone to त्र्, and makes it <strong>भ्</strong>, and so we have <strong>उब्भ</strong>; but <strong>ऊर्ध्व</strong>is changed <strong>उद्ध</strong> also.</p>
<p>The conjunct <strong>क्ष्</strong> or <strong>क्व्</strong> must in some cases have been pronounced in ancient times like <strong>क्श</strong>, as it is invariably so pronounced by the lower classes of the Marathi people at the presentday. This latter sound is easier to be made than <strong>क्व्</strong>, first becausethe passage from the guttural position of to <strong>क्</strong> the palatal whichIs nearest to it is more natural than that to the more distantcerebral position of <strong>ष</strong>, and also because, in the latter case, afterthe guttural contact, the tongue has to be rounded and thetip brought near the cerebral position. Thus, the whole weightof that organ has to be supported; while in the case of <strong>क्श्</strong>, whenits middle approaches the palatal position in pronouncing <strong>श्</strong>, theforepart falls into a natural position, and no effort is required tohold it there. Now in this <strong>क्श्</strong>, the sound of <strong>श्</strong>, being the latter ofthe two, is by the general rule more distinct than the other;and the complete contact of <strong>क्</strong> being transferred to it, it become<strong>छ्</strong>, because sibilants are produced by the heavy <em>śvāsa</em> as the hard</p>
<p>aspirates are, and thence <strong>च्छ्</strong>; as in <strong>तच्छक</strong>for <strong>तक्षक</strong>, <strong>छण</strong>for <strong>क्षण</strong>inthe sense of &lsquo;a festival&rsquo;, <strong>छुद्द</strong>for <strong>क्षुद्र</strong>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>In such words as <strong>वत्स</strong> and <strong>अप्सरस्</strong>, the prevailing sound is thatof <strong>स्</strong> which, with the complete contact of the preceding त् and प्,ought to become <strong>य्</strong>, as <strong>श्</strong>becomes <strong>छ्</strong> in the above case, on thetheory that <strong>म्</strong> is a dental. But it is not properly a dental, sinceit is formed not at the root of the upper teeth as <strong>त्, थ, द्</strong> &amp;c. are,but considerably above, and not by the tip of the tongue but by apart of it further inwards, which is made into a curve, havingits convex side upwards, and brought near to that position. Inthis last respect it resembles the palatals, though the part of thetongue employed in their case is still further inwards, i. e. themiddle. The sibilant <strong>स्</strong> therefore, has no mute corresponding toit in the sounds of the Sanskrit and Pali languages. The Marathidento-palatals <strong>च्, छ्, ज्, झ्</strong>answer to it completely, being formedin the same position as itself; so that <strong>स्</strong>, when the organic contact is complete, should become the Marathi <strong>छ्</strong>. But these soundsare unknown to the Pali; the speakers of that language couldnot pronounce the Marathi dento-palatals, as the Gujaratis andother northern nations cannot at the present day, and just asthese turn them into pure palatals, so did their ancestors. Hence,that sound which should properly be the dento-palatal <strong>छ्</strong> becomethe palatal <strong>छ्</strong>, and we have <strong>वच्छ</strong> for <strong>वत्स, अच्छरा</strong>for <strong>अप्सरस्</strong>and<strong>मच्छर</strong> for <strong>मत्सर</strong>.</p>
<p>The dentals following a <strong>र्</strong>in a Sanskrit word are in Palioften changed to cerebrals; as in <strong>बद्द्ढति</strong> for <strong>वर्धते, वट्टति</strong> for <strong>वर्तते, छड्डेति</strong>for <strong>छर्दयति, अट्ठ</strong> for <strong>अर्थ</strong> &amp;c.Here, as in the cases we haveexamined, the distinct sound is by the general rule the second,as we may observe even from the optional form for <strong>वर्तते</strong>, andarea for ard. But, as before remarked, in all these Pali transformations of Sanskrit conjuncts we see an attempt to pronounceboth the members. When the speaker, being about to put thevocal organs into the position necessary for the utterance of thefirst letter, which he has first heard though indistinctly, seesthat the second which he has distinctly heard cannot be producedthere, he gives it up, and then passes immediately to the nextposition. But if, at the first, he thinks he can produce somethinglike the second sound, which he has distinctly heard, he pro</p>
<p>nounces the letter there, and does not give up that position.Thus in pronouncing <strong>तर्प्</strong>, he feels that nothing like the sound <strong>प्</strong>can be produced at the position of <strong>र्</strong>, and hence gives it up andpassing on to the lips forms **तप्प्;**but in <strong>वर्त</strong> the <strong>द्</strong> that he pronouncesat the cerebral point sounds a great deal more like <strong>त्</strong> than <strong>प्</strong>, andtherefore he does not pass on to the dental position. But such ofthe Pali speakers as could distinguish between <strong>त्</strong> and <strong>द्</strong> did notstop at the cerebral position to pronounce their conjunct, butpassed on to the dental; hence the optional forms we have noticed.</p>
<p>Such words as <strong>मित्र, सत्र, भद्र</strong>, &amp;c., differ from <strong>वर्ध, वर्त</strong> &amp;c., inhaving the after the <strong>र्</strong> distinct sound, so that the speaker resortsfirst to the dental position, and uttering the distinct sound there,is not carried away by the following <strong>र्</strong> to the cerebral position,the sound of <strong>र्</strong> being weaker. But if in the same word a dentalfollows such a conjunct, that dental is changed to the corresponding cerebral; as in <strong>पटि</strong>for <strong>प्रति</strong>and <strong>पठम</strong> for <strong>प्रथम</strong>. The cerebralelement of these words has made a distinct impression on thespeaker&rsquo;s ear, and he is conscious that his transformation of <strong>प्र</strong>into <strong>प</strong>, which was necessitated by his inherent inability to pronounce the two consonants together, has not brought it out. Hetherefore realizes it by changing the following <strong>ति</strong>and <strong>थ</strong> to <strong>टि</strong> and <strong>ठ</strong>.But if a consonant of another species follows, or if the conjunct ends the word, he cannot give effect to this impression.</p>
<p>The conjuncts in which the second sound is weak and consequently gives way to the first are <strong>क्य्, ख्य्, ग्यू, प्य्, भ्य्, श्य्, स्य्, क्र्, ग्र्, त्र, द्र, ध्र, प्र, भ्र, श्र, स्र, क्ल्, क्व, ज्व, त्व्, द्व्, ध्व्, श्व,</strong>&amp;c., which have a semi-vowel for their latter member, and <strong>ग्न्, त्म, द्न, प्त्</strong>,&amp;c., which have a nasal.Thus we have <strong>सक्क</strong> for <strong>शक्य</strong> or <strong>शाक्य</strong>, <strong>अक्खान</strong> for <strong>आख्यान</strong>, <strong>योग्ग</strong> for<strong>योग्य, कुप्प</strong> for <strong>कुप्य, अब्भन्तर</strong> for <strong>अभ्यन्तर, पस्सति</strong> for <strong>पश्यति, तस्स</strong>for <strong>तस्य,सक्क</strong> for <strong>शक्र, अग्ग</strong> for <strong>अग्र</strong>, <strong>मित्त</strong> for <strong>मित्र, अदृक</strong>for <strong>आर्द्रक, गिद्ध</strong> for <strong>गृध्र,विप्प</strong> for <strong>त्रिप्र अब्भ</strong>for <strong>अभ्र, अस्सम</strong> for <strong>आश्रम, अस्सव</strong> for <strong>आस्रव, सुक्क</strong>for<strong>शुक्ल, पक्क</strong> for <strong>पक्व, पज्जलति</strong> for <strong>प्रज्वलति, नीलत्त</strong>for <strong>नीलत्व, विद्देस</strong>for <strong>विद्वेष,अद्धा</strong> for <strong>अध्वा, अस्स</strong> for <strong>अश्व</strong>, &amp;c., and <strong>अग्गि</strong>for <strong>अग्नि, अ</strong>त्ता for <strong>आत्मा,छद्द</strong> for <strong>छद्म, सोप्प</strong> for <strong>स्वप्न</strong>, &amp;c. The semi-vowel <strong>य्</strong> after <strong>न्</strong> in goingout turns the into the palatal <strong>ञ्</strong>, this latter representing thecombined effect of both; as in <strong>अञ्ञ</strong>for <strong>अन्य, राजञ्ञ</strong>for <strong>राजन्य</strong>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>We have noticed above the change of <strong>क्ष्</strong>to <strong>च्छ्</strong>. but more frequently it is transformed into <strong>क्ख</strong>. This change is due to thelatter <strong>ष्</strong> being pronounced not incorrectly like <strong>श्</strong>, but correctly asa cerebral sound, which being hollow and distinguishable, islost in the sound of <strong>क्</strong>. This last is distinctly heard, and the effect of <strong>ष्</strong> is only to add heavy <em>śvāsa</em> to it and render it <strong>स्व</strong>; and thus thewhole becomes <strong>क्ख्</strong>as in <strong>रुक्ख</strong> for <strong>वृक्ष लक्खण</strong> for <strong>लक्षण</strong>, <strong>पक्ख</strong>for <strong>पक्ष</strong>,&amp;c. Upon the principles we have laid down, it does not matterwhether the Sanskrit conjunct is composed of two or three consonants, since what is done in the Pali is to reproduce only thedistinct consonantal sound with the other attendant characteristics; and thus we have <strong>ण्ह</strong> for <strong>क्ष्ण</strong> or <strong>र्ष्ण</strong> as in <strong>सण्ह</strong> for <strong>श्लक्ष्ण</strong> and<strong>पण्हि</strong> for <strong>पार्ष्णि</strong>, and <strong>म्ह</strong> for <strong>क्ष्म</strong>as in <strong>पम्ह</strong>for <strong>पक्ष्म</strong>, in which words thelast is the distinct sound, and for as in it for <strong>क्ष्म</strong> as in <strong>लक्खी</strong> for <strong>लक्ष्मी</strong>, where the must have been pronounced so as to merge into theprecoding <strong>क्ष्</strong>.</p>
<p>A Sanskrit conjunct at the beginning of a word is reduced toa single letter; and the reason is obvious. For, as I have alreadyobserved, the distinctive oharacteristic of a conjunct consists inthe previous vowel being pronounced with rapidity and force, andin the subsequent strong pressure of the vocal organs, which isrendered possible by the momentum acquired by that forcibleutterance. It is the reproduction of this characteristic thatmakes a single consonant that is pronounced at any one of thevocal positions look like a double. When a previous vowel doesnot exist, that is, when a conjunct begins &amp; word, this characteristic cannot be reproduced; hence there is no double consonant.Thus, we have <strong>खलित</strong> for <strong>स्खलित, कमेण</strong> for <strong>क्रमेण, भ्रमर</strong> for <strong>भ्रमर, फस्स</strong> for<strong>स्पर्श</strong>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>You will have seen that in all the changes of conjunct consonants which we have examined, no element of the two sounds isomitted by the Pali speakers. They had not the patience to hearand reproduce the two consonants immediately after each other,by putting their vocal organs into two different positions, or theylaboure Iunder a physical inaptitude for doing so, their tonguenot being sufficiently trained for the successive movements. Butshort of this, all the constituents of the sound, the <em>śvāsa</em>, light and</p>
<p>heavy, the completeness of contact, and the force of utterance,are represented in their pronunciation, and the amount of muscularexertion involved is the same as in the case of the original.This may be called the energetic mode of pronouncing conjuncts.</p>
<p>There are, however, a few instances in which the componentsare separated by inserting a vowel between them. Thus Sanskrit<strong>सूक्ष्म</strong> is changed to <strong>सुखुम</strong>, <strong>औष्मिक</strong> to <strong>ओसुमिक, श्लेष्म</strong> to <strong>सिलेसुम, स्मरति</strong> to<strong>सुमरति, श्री</strong> and <strong>ह्री</strong>to <strong>सिरी</strong> and <strong>हिरी, बैल्ब</strong> to <strong>बेलुव</strong> and to <strong>औपश्लेषिक</strong> to <strong>ओपसिलेसिक</strong>.The separating vowel is generally such as can be easilypronounced along with the previous or the following consonant,that is, belongs to the same organic position as oither. Thus inthe first four instances we have the labial <strong>उ</strong> in the syllables <strong>खु</strong>and <strong>सु</strong> owing to the influence of the following <strong>म्</strong>.</p>
<p>The conjuncts <strong>र्य्</strong> and <strong>र्ह्</strong> are almost invariably dissolved into<strong>रिय्</strong> and <strong>रह्</strong> as in <strong>कारिय, अरिय, सुरियर विरिय</strong> &amp;c.and <strong>अरह गरहा, वरिह</strong>&amp;c. for <strong>कार्य, अर्य</strong> or<strong>आर्य, सूर्य, वीर्य</strong> &amp;cand <strong>अर्ह,, गर्हा, वर्ह</strong>&amp;c.; and in oneor two instances, we have the first change when the <strong>य्</strong> is precededby a consonant other than <strong>र्</strong> as in <strong>चौतिय</strong>for <strong>चैत्य</strong>. This change isto some extent due to the <strong>य्</strong> being pronounced weak, <em>i. e.</em> almostlike <strong>इ</strong>.</p>
<p>In the same way, we have <strong>सिलोक, सिलेस, सिलाघा, किलेस, किलन्त,गिलान, मिलान, पिलुवति, सुपिन सिनिद्ध, नहान</strong> or <strong>सिनान</strong> &amp;c. for <strong>श्लोक, श्लेष,श्लाघा, केश, कान्त, ग्लान, म्लान, प्लवति स्वप्न,स्निग्ध, स्नान</strong> &amp;c. This mode ofutterance wants the force of the one we have examined, but boththe sounds of a conjunct are clearly reproduced in it.You willhave observed that the second member of the conjunct dissolvedin this way is what may be called an imperfect consonant, *i. e.*a semi-vowel, aspirate, or nasal, in pronouncing which the breathis not completely stopped. They therefore act like a vowel, andrender the sound of the first consonant comparatively distinct andaudible, but are not so weak themselves as to melt away into thatsound. Hence both the sounds are audible; but the Pali speakernot being able to put his vocal organs into two consonantal positions successively, as we have seen, reproduced the two sounds byinterposing a vowel between them. But when in some cases thesecond member was weakly pronounced, it melted away into thefirst, and so we have the optional forms <strong>विस्सरति</strong> for <strong>विस्मरति, सेह्म</strong>for <strong>श्लेष्म,सोप्प</strong> for <strong>स्वप्न</strong> &amp;c. When, however, ita pronunciation</p>
<p>became stronger than that of the first, it prevailed, and so wehave <strong>कय्य</strong>for <strong>कार्य</strong> and <strong>अय्य</strong> for <strong>आर्य</strong>.</p>
<p>Some conjuncts appear also unchanged in this dialect; as <strong>ब्र</strong> inthe words <strong>ब्रह्म, ब्रवीति</strong> and <strong>ब्रूहेति, व्य</strong> in <strong>व्याधि, व्यग्ध, व्यग्ग</strong> &amp;c., <strong>प्ल</strong> in <strong>प्लवङ्ग, प्लवति</strong>,and <strong>प्लव, स्न</strong> in <strong>स्नेह</strong>&amp;c., Such as have a nasal for their firstmember and a mute for the second are also unchanged, since thenasal, even according to the rules of Sanskrit, belongs to the same organic position as the mute.</p>
<p>We will now proceed to notice the changes of single consonants. An unaspirate is changed to an aspirate when it isfollowed in the same word by a sibilant as in <strong>फरसु</strong> for <strong>परशु, फरुस</strong>for <strong>परुष, फुस्स</strong>for <strong>पुष्प, सुखुमार</strong> for <strong>सुकुमार थुस</strong>for <strong>तुष</strong>&amp;c. The heavy<em>śvāsa</em> that forms a constituent of the sibilant sound has made sucha strong impression on the ear of the hearer, that he immediatelyprepares himself to let it out, and thus uses it even in pronouncingthe letters which precede the sibilant and do not require it. Thepronunciation of a word is rendered easier by transferring one ofthe elements of a sound to another or others, that is, by assimilating them to each other as much as possible. In a few instancesthe simple breath or sausa of a previous surd is transferred to thefollowing, originally a sonant, as in <strong>थकेति</strong>for <strong>स्थगयति</strong>. The cerebral unaspirated sonant <strong>ङ्</strong> between two vowels is softened intothe corresponding semi-vowel <strong>ल्</strong>, as in <strong>तालन</strong>for <strong>ताडन, पीलन</strong>for<strong>पीडन, तलाक</strong> for त<strong>डाक</strong> &amp;c. This peculiarity distinguished the oldVedic Sanskrit also; and the sound exists in the modern Marathiand Gujarati, though it is unknown to the other vernaculars.</p>
<p>I have already given instances in which the cerebral <strong>र्</strong> of aprevious syllable in going out changes the dental of the followingto the cerebral, and to these I msy now add <strong>निगण्ठ</strong> for <strong>निर्ग्रन्थ, वण्ट</strong>for <strong>वृन्त</strong>, <strong>कट</strong> for <strong>कृत</strong> &amp;c. In some instances, this change takesplace without such an influencing cause, as in <strong>डसति</strong> and <strong>डंस</strong>for <strong>दशति</strong>and <strong>दंश</strong>, and <strong>डाह</strong>for <strong>दाह</strong>. The same phenomenon is observable in some conjuncts, as in <strong>विदटड्ढ</strong>for <strong>विदग्ध, हेट्ठा</strong>for <strong>अधर्स्तात्</strong> and <strong>ठा</strong> or<strong>ट्ठा</strong> for <strong>स्था</strong>in the several derivatives from that root as <strong>ठाति, ठायी, उट्ठान</strong> &amp;c.The dental nasal <strong>न्</strong> is also similarly changed to <strong>ण्</strong> in afew cases, as in <strong>याण, ओणत, ओणीत, सणिकं</strong> for <strong>ज्ञान, अवनत, अवनीत, शनकैः</strong>&amp;c. The operation of this process is very limited, but still it</p>
<p>exists, and cannot be accounted for in any other way than bysupposing that the vocal organs or the vocal habits of the Palispeakers were more adapted for the production of cerebral sounds,or, in other words, the people had a natural aptitude for them.</p>
<p>Sanskrit <strong>श्</strong> and <strong>ष्</strong> are changed to <strong>म्</strong>, which is the only sibilantin the language. This change involves an economy of effort.The tongue in its several movements becomes a lever with thefulcrum at the inner end where it is fixed in the mouth, and theweight in its centre of gravity. The advantage increases withthe distance from the fulcrum of the point which is moved, thatis, the point where power is applied. Hence gutturals are themost disadvantageous, palatals next, and dentals, the least. Thecerebrals being pronounced by rounding the tongue and raisingit very high, it is a question whether this additional effort doesnot neutralise the advantage they possess over the palatals bytheir position being more distant. Thus <strong>स्र</strong> is the weakest of thesibilants. But in the Pali the change is so universal, that wemust suppose a special inaptitude in the speakers of that languagefor pronouncing <strong>श्</strong> and ष्, as we had to suppose in the case of theconjuncts.</p>
<p>When, however, in a few cases, the peculiarity of the palatal<strong>श्</strong> was distinctly preceived, and it was felt that the substituted <strong>स्</strong>did not bring it out, that sibilant was changed to the corresponding mute of its position, <em>i. e.</em> to <strong>छ्</strong>, which resembles <strong>श्</strong> in theheaviness of the simple breath required for pronouncing it. Wehave thus <strong>छव</strong> for <strong>शव</strong>, <strong>छक</strong> for <strong>शकृत्</strong> and <strong>छाप</strong> for <strong>शाब</strong>. The change of<strong>षट्</strong> &lsquo;six to <strong>छ</strong> is also to be similarly accounted for.</p>
<p>I have already remarked that sometimes <strong>ष्</strong> must at an earlyperiod have been pronounced very much like <strong>श्</strong>. Besides thesechanges there are solitary instances of others, such as the softeningor toning of surds as in <strong>मूग</strong> for <strong>मूक</strong>, or the dropping of the muteelement of the sonant aspirates as in <strong>होति</strong> and <strong>हेट्ठा</strong>for <strong>भवति</strong>and<strong>अधस्तात्</strong>. But these will be more fully discussed in connectionwith the Prakrits and the vernaculars, in which these processeshave a much wider range.</p>
<p>The vowel <strong>ऋ</strong> is changed to <strong>अ</strong> as in <strong>कसि</strong> for <strong>कृषि</strong>, <strong>तण्हा</strong>for <strong>तृष्णा</strong>,<strong>गढ़</strong> for गृह, घत for <strong>घृत</strong>, <strong>मच्चु</strong> for <strong>मृत्यु</strong> &amp;c. to <strong>इ</strong> as in <strong>दिट्ठ</strong>for <strong>दृष्ट, तिण</strong> for</p>
<p><strong>तृण, मिग</strong> for <strong>मृग, तित्ति</strong> for <strong>तृप्ति गिद्ध</strong> for <strong>गृध्र</strong> &amp;c.; and to <strong>उ</strong> as in <strong>भुस</strong> for <strong>भृश, मुदु</strong>for <strong>मृदु मुसा</strong> for <strong>सृषा, बुस</strong>, <strong>वुस</strong> for <strong>वृष, वुट्ठि</strong> for <strong>वृष्टि</strong> &amp;c. The lastchange generally takes place when the vowel is preceded by alabial; so that the vocal position of the consonant influences thatof the vowel. When there is no such influence, it is changed to<strong>अ</strong> and <strong>इ.</strong> Now, the vowel <strong>ऋ</strong> is composed of a consonantal anda vowel element, the former of which is subordinated to thelatter. On this account it does not give to the consonant to whichit is added the character of a conjunct, and the preceding vowel is not rendered heavy^(1**.<strong>)In Pali this consonantal element disappears in virtue of the inherent inability, which we have considered at such length, of passing from one vocal position toanother without letting off the breath; but the previous consonant is not doubled because the usual character of a conjunct isabsent. Or the disappearance may be accounted for by the factthat the consonantal element is so subordinated to the vowelelement as to escape notice, and that the letter, as a whole, isdifficult to pronounce. The vowel element of is pronounced bybringing the root of the tongue in contact with the root of thepalate, <em>i. e.</em> in the position of the gutturals; and is unrepresentedindependently in the Sanskrit or Pali alphabet. Hence it ispronounced either lower down, in the position of <strong>अ</strong>, or higher upin that of <strong>इ</strong>, while it is sometimes carried so far to the outside asthe position of <strong>उ</strong>, especially when a labial precedes. That thecerebral or <strong>र्</strong> element did exist, and was occasionally preceived bythe Pali speakers is proved by such examples as <strong>रिते</strong>for <strong>ऋते</strong> and</strong>रुक्ख** for <strong>वृक्ष</strong>, and also by the circumstance that in some cases,though it disappears, it changes the following dental to a cerebral, as in <strong>वट्ठि</strong>for <strong>वृद्धि, विसट</strong> for <strong>विसृत, कट</strong> for <strong>कृत</strong> &amp;c.. From theseobservations it would appear that the vowel we have been considering must have been in those days pronounced just in themanner in which Marathi Pandits of the present day pronounceit, and not like <strong>अर्, इर्, र्</strong>, or <strong>रि</strong>as is supposed by several European</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1. This fact is accounted for by the authors and the commentators of thePrātiśākhyas by supposing that the vowel element envelops the <strong>र्</strong> on allsides i. e. precedes it and follows it. (See Vājasaneyi-Prātiśākhya, inIndische Studien, Volume V, p. 145; and Atharva-Prātiśākhya, editedby Whitney I, 37.)</p>
<p>scholars. If <strong>घृत</strong> were really <strong>घर्त,</strong> or <strong>मृग, मिर्ग,</strong> the Pali corruptionswould be <strong>घत्त</strong> or <strong>मिग्ग</strong>; and if <strong>सुकृत</strong> were <strong>सुक्रत</strong>, or <strong>तादृश</strong> were <strong>ताद्रिश</strong>,we should have <strong>सुक्कत</strong> or <strong>तद्दिश</strong>instead of <strong>सुकत</strong>and <strong>तादिस</strong>, and thereis no reason why <strong>ऋतु</strong> and <strong>ऋषि</strong> should have lost their and become<strong>उतु</strong> and <strong>इसि</strong> if they were really pronounced like <strong>रितु</strong> or <strong>रतु</strong>and <strong>रिषि</strong>or <strong>रषि</strong>¹.</p>
<p>The sounds of the Sanskrit diphthongs <strong>ऐ</strong> and <strong>औ</strong>are like thoseof <strong>अइ</strong>and <strong>अउ</strong>uttered rapidly, *i. e.*without allowing any appreciable time to elapse between the two elements. In forming <strong>अ.<strong>the tongue and the lips are in a natural position, the lips, however,not being closed but a little opened; while <strong>इ</strong> requires that themiddle of the tongue should be brought close to the palate, and <strong>उ</strong>,that the lips should be completely rounded. Hence, in pronouncing</strong>ऐ</strong> and <strong>औ</strong> it it is necessary to pass from one vocal position <em>immediately</em>to another, a process of which, as we have seen, the Pali speakerswere incapable. These diphthongs are therefore changed to <strong>ए</strong> and<strong>औ</strong> which partake of the character of both the components. In theformation of <strong>ए</strong> the tongue is not horizontal as in the case of <strong>अ</strong>;its middle is raised up but not brought so close to the palate asin the case of <strong>इ</strong>. Similarly, in pronouncing <strong>ओ</strong>the lips are not socompletely rounded as in the formation of <strong>उ</strong>;neither are they in anatural position as in the case of <strong>अ</strong>. These sounds, therefore,being produced in a position between those of <strong>अ</strong>and <strong>इ</strong>, and <strong>अ</strong>and<strong>उ</strong>, combine the characteristics of both, but are simple, <em>i e,</em> formedin one position only. Thus we have <strong>सेल</strong> for <strong>शैल, तेल</strong>for <strong>तैल, केवट्ट</strong>for <strong>कैवर्त, खोम</strong> for <strong>क्षौम, कोसेय्य</strong> for <strong>कौशेय, मोलि</strong> for <strong>मौलि</strong> &amp;c. Similarly <strong>अय</strong> and <strong>अब</strong> frequently become <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong>; asin <strong>कथेति</strong> for <strong>कथयति</strong>,<strong>पूजेति</strong> for <strong>पूजयति</strong>, <strong>नेति</strong> for <strong>नयति, ओधि</strong> for <strong>अवधि, ओकास</strong> for <strong>अवकाश, नोनीत</strong>for <strong>नवनीत</strong>&amp;c. The sounds of these dissyllables differ from thoseof <strong>ऐ</strong> and <strong>औ</strong>in this respect, that the <strong>अ</strong> of the former is not rapidlypronounced as is that involved in these diphthongs; or, in the words of the grammarians, the value of the first अ is one <em>mātrü</em>and of the other one-half. In the same way the <strong>अ</strong> of the twodissyllables is followed by the semi-vowel <strong>य्</strong> and <strong>व्</strong>, while thatof <strong>ऐ</strong>and <strong>औ</strong>has the corresponding vowels <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong> after it. When<strong>अय</strong> and <strong>अव</strong> are hastily pronounced, this distinction disappears,and these dissyllables assume the form of the diphthongs <strong>ऐ</strong> and <strong>औ</strong>,which by the rule just discussed become <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong>.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1. The explanation of this vowel sound and the others that follow is basedupon the mode in which we Marathas pronounce them at the present day,and which is sanctioned by the Prātiśākhyas.</p>
<p>A long vowel is shortened when it is followed by a doubleconsonant; as in <strong>मग्ग</strong> for <strong>मार्ग, पत्त</strong> for <strong>प्राप्त, इक्खण</strong> for <strong>ईक्षण, कित्ति</strong> forfor <strong>कीर्ति, तिच</strong> for <strong>तीव्र रुक्थ</strong> for <strong>रूक्ष, मुत्त</strong> for <strong>मू</strong>त्र &amp;c. The strongpressure that is necessary for the pronunciation of a conjunctcannot be properly exerted, as formerly observed, without momentum, for the acquisition of which the previous vowel has to beuttered with force and with a jerk. For this purpose a shortvowel alone is fitted, but if a long one precedes, its utterancebeing by its nature slow and weak, the organs for want ofmomentum do not strike against each other with force, and hencethe pressure they exert is weak. But the Pali speaker, catchingfrom his Sanskrit teacher only the generally strong nature of thepressure involved in the utterance of conjuncts, realized it to thefullest possible extent, without stopping to observe how much itwas impaired by the length of the previous vowel, by pronouncingthe previous vowel with force and rapidity, and thus renderingit short. And in this way the real quantity of the syllable is notdiminished. Though the vowel is short, the vocal organs takesome time to emerge from the close contact, and the strongpressure resulting from its forcible utterance, and hence the wholesyllable <strong>इक्</strong>, for instance, in <strong>इक्खण</strong>, has the metrical value of along vowel, <em>i. e.</em> is equal to two <em>mātrās</em> or syllabic instants. Inthe original <strong>ईक्षण</strong>, on the contrary, the pressure in the pronunciation of <strong>क्ष</strong>, being weaker in consequence of the slowness of theprevious vowel utterance, occupies less time; so that in the onecase the shortness of the vowel is accompanied by a longer duration of the contactand in the other the length of the vowel isattended by a shorter duration of the contact. The change, then,we have been considering, is due to the pressure necessary for theformation of the conjunctal sounds in these words having made astrong impression on the ear of the Pali speaker. When, however,the length of the vowel prevailed, and neutralized the pressure tosuch an extent as to render it incapable of attracting attention,the conjunct came to be in the condition of one standing at thebeginning of a word; and, like it, preserved only the more distinctsound and dropped the other, leaving the long vowel unchanged.</p>
<p>We have thus <strong>सीस</strong> for <strong>शीर्ष, दीघ</strong>for <strong>दीर्घ, सासप</strong> for <strong>सर्षप</strong>, &amp;c. It is,however, clear that a long vowel followed by a double consonantis an impossibility in Pali. A Sanskrit conjunct, whenever itmade a distinct impression, was pronounced with the usualcharacteristics of that sound, viz., the previous rapid and forciblevowel utterance and the subsequent strong contact and strongpressure, the perceptible effect of which was the shortening of theprevious vowel and the doubling of the following consonant.</p>
<p>Without the momentum acquired from the force and rapidityof the previous vowel utterance, the Pali speaker could not forma strong contact and exert strong pressure, that is, without ashort preceding vowel they could not pronounce a double consonant. If then the Pali has suoh words as <strong>तेत्तिस (त्रयस्त्रिंशत्), सेट्ठि(श्रेष्ठिन्), नेत्त (नेत्र), सोत्थिय (श्रोत्रिय) योग्गा(योग्या), मोक्ख</strong> &amp;c., it followsthat the vowels <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong> sir were in such cases pronounced short.Similarly, when before doubles <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong> are changed to them, asthey often are, they must be short. This change of <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong> to <strong>ए</strong>and <strong>ओ</strong>arises from the fact that the force and rapidity ofthe jerk with which the current of breath is sent up topronounce the former vowels, is apt to prevent the tonguefrom rising as close to the palate or the lower lip to the upper,as is necessary for the formation of <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>उ</strong>, or they areapt to be forced down by the current. And <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong> differ fromइ and उ simply in the distance between the pronouncing organsbeing greater. This change, therefore, really involves an economy,since the effort to raise up the tongue and the lower lip, aerossthe strong current of breath blowing above, is saved. We havethus, <strong>ओट्ठ</strong> for <strong>उष्ट्र, पोक्खर</strong> for <strong>पुष्कर, पोत्थक</strong> for <strong>पुस्तक, सोण्ड</strong> for <strong>शुण्ड, नेक्ख</strong>for <strong>निष्क, नेत्तिंस</strong> for <strong>निस्त्रिंश, वेस्सभू</strong>for <strong>विश्वभू</strong>&amp;c. In some cases bothvowels are in use, as in the word which has another form<strong>निक्ख</strong>. Sometimes, especially before , was invariably pronouncedshort, though no conjunct followed, and to make up for the lossof quantity thus occasioned the consonant was doubled; as in<strong>थेय्य</strong> for <strong>स्थेय, गेय्य</strong> for <strong>गेप कोसेय्य</strong> for <strong>कौशेय</strong> &amp;c. The vowel <strong>ओ</strong> wasalso similarly treated in a few cases, as in <strong>ओस्सजति</strong> for <strong>अवसृजति</strong>.Thus then not only has the Pali a short <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong>, but the speakersof the language seem to have possessed a predilection for thosesounds. Besides the changes we have examined, there are stray</p>
<p>examples of others, such as <strong>उसु</strong>and <strong>उच्छु</strong>for <strong>इषु</strong>and <strong>इक्षु</strong>, in whichthe <strong>उ</strong> of the following syllable influences the utterance of the firstvowel, सोप्पfor <strong>स्वप्न</strong>, in which the semi-vowel व् is dissolved intothe corresponding vowel <strong>उ</strong>, and thence transformed to short **ओ,**मोर for <strong>मयूर</strong>, in which the <strong>य्</strong> being lightly pronounced loses itsconsonantal character and the vowel <strong>ऊ</strong> with the preceding अforms <strong>ओ</strong>, and others.</p>
<p>You will thus have observed that the phonetic changes whichSanskrit words undergo in passing into the Pali may be broughtunder a few general rules. There are not such various and extensive corruptions both of vowels and consonants as we find in thelater dialects and in the modern vernaculars. It has beenestimated that two-fifths of the Fali vocabulary are composed ofpure Sanskrit words, and the remaining three-fifths, of wordsaltered in one or other of the modes explained above. The conclusion to be drawn from these facts is, that when the Pali was inuse, the tradition of the original Sanskrit was not distant; thewords, so to say, did not stray away long from the motherlanguage, so as to undergo extensive alterations. If so, how isit that some of the changes such as the transformation of ए and औinto <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong> and the assimilation of consonants are so universal, the first being without any exception, and the second withbut a few unimportant ones? The principle which guides phoneticchange is the economy of effort, understanding the word in itswidest sense. This economy is observable in the two kinds ofchanges, as well as in the transformation of surds into sonants,the olision of consonants or of some of their elements, the assimilation of the vowels or the single consonants that make up a word,and in several other processes. But in the Pali there are very few instances of some of these, and none at all of others. Thelanguage had not a sufficiently long duration of independentexistence to bring them into extensive operation. If, then, thetwo processes we have noticed are found in full play in that dialect, the reason must be sought for in the vocal peculiarities ofthe people who spoke it. Though they heard conjunct consonantsand the diphthongs <strong>ऐ</strong> and <strong>औ</strong> pronounced by the speakers ofSanskrit, as correctly as the other letters which they did notcorrupt, their organs were not fitted to utter them. These peculiarities may have been natural or acquired. If natural, the people</p>
<p>who first corrupted Sanskrit into the Pali must have belongedto an alien race which came into close contact with the Äryasand learnt their language. If they were acquired, a branch of thesame Āryan race must be supposed to have been isolated in somepart of the country, and to have developed them, in consequence of being cut off from the main body. But this supposition mustbe rejected for the reasons that have been already given. Suchcomplete isolation as could give rise to new vocal peculiaritiesmust be expected to have occasioned greater phonetio decay inother respects than is observable in the Pali. And our analysisof the Sanskrit conjunctal and the Pali double sounds favoursthe first view. For, we have seen that these latter represent allthe elements of the former, but they are combined in a soundproduced in one vocal position only. The Pali speakers endeavoured to reproduce the sound of a conjuct faithfully, their pronunciation was not weak, as is that prevailing in modern times,but energetic and correct in every other respect; but they couldnot combine energy of utterance with two successive movementsof the vocal organs. This could only be because their organswere not sufficiently trained for the purpose; in other words,because the sounds were foreign to them. The condition of menwho have to learn the language of others is similar to that ofchildren, whose organs of speech are being exercised for the first time. Healthy children, whose utterance is energetic, pronouncethe conjuncts almost in the same way as the Pali speakers did.And there is another instance in History of an alien race havingtreated the sounds of the language of a civilized community injust the same way, The Barbarians who overran Italy anddeveloped the Italian from the Latin, showed the same inabilityto pronounce the Latin conjuncts, and assimilated them as ourPali ancestors did.</p>
<p>If this supposition is correct, we must find other traces of thepeculiarities of this alien race. And such we do find. Theexistence of the short and sit in the Pali, and the predilectionthe people showed for them, as well as the change of dentals tocerebrals without any influencing cause, are similarly to beattributed to the natural vocal tendencies of the people. Thesesounds must have existed and played an important part in theoriginal language of this people, so that they were unable to shake</p>
<p>them off entirely, even when they left their own tongue andlearned that of the more civilized Āryas with whom they came tobe closely incorporated. If the original Pali speakers belonged tothe same race as the Dravidians of Southern India of the presentday, we have a reason to believe that their native tongue contained them; for they exist in the Dravidian languages and arevery characteristic of them.</p>
<p>We shall also find in the Pali, and even in the passage placedbefore you, examples of another phenomenon presented by agrowing language. Several new words, unknown to Sanskrit,but formed from Sanskrit roots, have come into use. Such is<strong>मनापो,</strong> derived very likely from <strong>मनस्</strong> &lsquo;mind&rsquo; or &lsquo;heart&rsquo; and <strong>आप्</strong>&rsquo;to obtain&rsquo; &rsquo;to mee&rsquo;t,so that the word signifies &lsquo;something thatcomes up to the wishes of the heart&rsquo;, &lsquo;pleasing. The word <strong>सचे</strong>is from <strong>चेत्</strong> with <strong>स</strong> prefixed, which स seems to be the same as thenominative singular of the masculine of <strong>तद्</strong>. For, it is so used inSanskrit before <strong>चेत्</strong>, though it has there an independent sense; asin <strong>स चेन्मुनिदौहित्रस्तल्लक्षणोपन्नः</strong> (Śakuntala). Often used together inthis way, the two words formed a compound expression, and,the independent character of being forgotten, it came to belooked upon as one word. In the same way, <strong>सन्तिक</strong> must havecome into existence from the frequent use of such expressions as<strong>तस्सन्तिकं, ब्राह्मणस्सन्तिकं</strong>&amp;c. made up of the genitive singular of anoun or pronoun ending in अ and अन्तिक. The portion <strong>सन्तिक</strong>thencame to be regarded as an independent word, and was used assuch. Another new word is <strong>फासु</strong> or <strong>फासुक</strong> &lsquo;agreeable&rsquo;,&lsquo;pleasant&rsquo;,corresponding to such a Sanskrit word as <strong>स्पर्शु</strong> or <strong>स्पर्शुक</strong> formedfrom the analogy of such verbal derivatives as <strong>भिक्षु इच्छु</strong>, or <strong>लावुक,पातु</strong>क &amp;c., and meaning &rsquo;that which is or deserves to be touched&rsquo;,or &lsquo;pleasant to the touch&rsquo;. Other instances are <strong>पिलन्धन</strong> &lsquo;anornament,&rsquo; <strong>पेय्याल</strong> &lsquo;plentiful&rsquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p><strong>(B)</strong></p>
<p><strong>GRAMMAR OF THE PALI DIALECT</strong></p>
<p>We will now proceed to the examination of Pali grammar.When after years of successive creative efforts, the language ofour Āryan ancestors came to be so rich in all kinds of grammatical forms, as the Vedicor middle Sanskrit is, it became cumbrous,and the tendency set in, as we have seen, of dropping away someof them and rendering the grammar simpler.</p>
<p>The duals of both nouns and verbs are unnecessary; the occasions for using them do not often present themselves. Hence, evenin Sanskrit, their use must have been rare, and the Pali, which,in its original form at least, must be taken to represent the currentusage, has dropped them away altogether.</p>
<p>But the manner in which the process of simplification is principally carried on is by the use of false analogies. Thus in Sanskritnouns ending in <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong> of the neuter gender prefix <strong>न्</strong> to theterminations of the vowel cases. But in Pali it is added to thoseof the corresponding cases of masculine nouns also in <strong>मच्चुनो</strong> for<strong>मृत्योः</strong>in the passage before us. Similarly, from the analogy ofneuter nouns in which form their nominative and accusativesingular by adding <strong>म्</strong>, the pronouns <strong>यद्</strong> and <strong>तद्</strong> a come to have <strong>यं</strong> and<strong>तं</strong> for the corresponding cases, instead of the Sanskrit <strong>यद्</strong> and <strong>तद्</strong>.</p>
<p>In Sanskrit, the conjugation that is very often used is thefirst, in which अ is tacked on to the root in the special tenses, andit embraces a large number of the most ordinary roots. Here, inour passage, we find the analogy extended to the root <strong>हिंस्</strong> thepresent tense of which is in the mother dialect ordinarily formedby inserting <strong>न</strong> between the two letters, and adding the termination to the final (<strong>हिनस्ति</strong> 3rd person singular), and we have <strong>हिंसति</strong>.The root <strong>ज्ञा</strong> takes the form of <strong>जा</strong> in the present and other specialtenses, and to it is added the conjugational sign ना, so that itbecomes <strong>जाना</strong>. Now, this special form is generalized, and used inother tenses also, such as the Aorist and the Future. Thus, wehave here <strong>संजानिंसु</strong>, the Aorist 3rd person plural of <strong>ज्ञा</strong>, and in otherplaces we find <strong>जानिस्तति</strong> as one of the forms of the Future. Thespecial forms <strong>इच्छ, पश्य, शृणु, बुध्य</strong>, and <strong>पद्य</strong> are similarly generalized,the last four being phonetically changed to <strong>पस्स, सुण, बुज्झ</strong>and <strong>पज्ज</strong>.</p>
<p>In the same way, in forming the causative of a root, <strong>प</strong> or <strong>आप</strong>is added in Sanskrit to roots ending in <strong>आ</strong> and to a few others. Itis extended to all roots in the Pali, and thus we have <strong>तिकिच्छापेहि</strong>for <strong>चिकित्सय</strong> in the above passage.</p>
<p>The termination <strong>त्वा</strong>of the absolutive is in Sanskrit replacedby <strong>य</strong> when a root has a preposition prefixed to it. But here nosuch distinction is observed, and ldbe is <strong>त्वा</strong> used in all cases.</p>
<p>The operation of this law of false analogies is very extensive</p>
<p>in the grammar of Pali and the later Prakrits; and by its means,new forms have been made up instead of those current in theprimitive language. But side by side with these, we often findthe latter also in use currupted by the usual phonetic laws, andhaving a sort of isolated existence, since they transgress thegeneral rule that has newly come into operation. Thus we have<strong>जानिस्सति, परिसस्सति</strong> and <strong>लभिस्सति</strong> according to the law of analogy;but <strong>ञस्सति</strong> from <strong>ज्ञास्यति, दक्खति</strong> from <strong>द्रक्ष्यति</strong>, and <strong>लच्छाते</strong> from <strong>लप्स्पते</strong>are also in use. These three processes then, <em>viz</em>., the droppingaway of forms, not required for the expression of the currentordinary thought, the formation of new ones on the principle ofanalogy, and the preservation of the old ones in what may becalled an isolated or petrified condition, have contributed to theformation of the grammar of this and the succeeding languages.With these preliminary observations, I will now hastily passunder review the principal points in the grammar of this dialect¹.</p>
<p>Pali and other DialectsThe Pali has lost the dual, and also the dative and ablative cases, except of masculine and neuter nouns ending in अ**^(*)**</p>
<p>.Theonly occasion when the first is ordinarily used is when &lsquo;giving&rsquo;is expressed, but the genitive case has such a comprehensivesignification in Sanskrit that it denotes the dative relation also,and is often used in that sense. Most of the relations expressedby the ablative are denoted by the instrumental, and for theexpression of the peculiar ablative sense, <em>viz</em>., the separation of onething from another, the particle <strong>तम्</strong>had come into very generaluse, even in the parent language. The genitive and instrumentalthus took up the place of those two cases. But people do notforget what they have frequent occasion to use. The great majorityof nouns in Sanskrit end in <strong>अ</strong>, and of these the singular isoftener used than the plural. Hence the singulars of the dativeand ablative of these nouns are preserved in the Pali, notwithstanding the operation of the causes that drove away these casesfrom other places.</p>
<p>The <strong>भ</strong> of the termination of the instrumental plural isoptionally changed to <strong>ह</strong>. The locative singular of masculine andneuter nouns ending in a vowel is formed by adding the pronominal termination <strong>स्मिन्,</strong> phonetically changed to <strong>स्मिं</strong>and <strong>म्हि</strong>; andthe ablative <strong>स्मात्</strong> in the form of <strong>स्मा</strong> or <strong>म्हा</strong>is used optionally in thecase of nouns in <strong>अ</strong>. The termination <strong>स्य</strong> of the genitive singularof this class of nouns is generalized, and in the form of <strong>स्स</strong> appliedto all nouns of the masculine and neuter genders. It should beremembered that in accordance with the general rule, the Sanskritgrammatical forms drop the final consonant, including a visarga,in passing into the Pali. The nasal <strong>म्</strong> is changed to an anusvāra,and since this, like a conjunct consonant, necessitates the rapidutterance of the preceding vowel and renders it heavy, the vowelis shortened. We have thus <strong>नं</strong> for <strong>नाम्, स्सं</strong> for <strong>स्याम्</strong> <strong>यं</strong>for <strong>याम्</strong>, &amp;c.The <strong>न्</strong> of <strong>स्मिन्</strong>and of the syllable <strong>अन्</strong> occurring in some of thecases is also changed to anusvära.</p>
<p>____________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.My authority in this portion of my subject is Kacchāyana, as edited by M. Senart.</p>
<p>*The ablative अग्गिस्मा-म्हा, भिक्खुस्मा-श्हा do, however, occur in the literature.</p>
<p><strong>[THE NOUN]</strong></p>
<p><strong>MASCULINE NOUNS ENDING IN अ</strong></p>
<p>The nominative singular always ends in <strong>ओ</strong>. In Sanskrit wehave this form before a short <strong>अ</strong> or a sonant only. Here it isgeneralized. The accusative plural ends in <strong>ए</strong> as <strong>बुद्धे</strong>. When thefinal consonant is dropped according to the usual phonetic rules,the Sanskrit nominative and accusative plurals become exactlyalike. To distinguish the one from the other, therefore, this formis appropriated in the Pali for the latter. The appears to be thetermination of the nominative plural of pronouns, and it istransferred to nouns in the same way as the others we havenoticed above. But it is used here in an accusative sense.</p>
<p>The forms of the singular and plural of the nominative ofneuter nouns, and of the plural of many more, are the same asthose of the accusative in Sanskrit, and this fact must have ledto a tendency to liken the two cases in other places also. Hence the pronominal nominative came to be used like an accusative.We shall directly see this tendency to confuse the two casesmanifested more clearly as regards the plural, and it may beremarked that as regards both the numbers, it went on increasingat each successive stage, until in the latest Prakrit and in thevernaculars the distinction has entirely disappeared.</p>
<p>The termination of the instrumental plural is <strong>एभि</strong>as in <strong>बुद्धोभि</strong>,with the mute elament dropped, <strong>एहि</strong> which is traced to theVedic <strong>एभिः</strong> in such forms as <strong>देवेभिः</strong>.But t may be explained otherwise. Tho Sanskrit <strong>बुद्धैः</strong>becomes <strong>बुद्धे</strong> by the dropping of the visarga and the change of the diphthong to <strong>ए</strong>, and this is the sameas the locative singular, and is by no means distinctive of aninstrumental sense. Hence to <strong>बुद्धे</strong> was added the instrumentaltermination भि or हिwhich all other nouns in Sanskrit and Palitake.</p>
<p>The other cases are the same as in Sanskrit, subject to thegeneral remarks made above. The ablative and locative singularshave the new pronominal forms in <strong>स्मा</strong> or <strong>म्हा</strong> and <strong>स्मिं</strong> or <strong>म्हि</strong>in addition to the old ones. In the vocative singular, the final <strong>अ</strong> isoptionally lengthened.</p>
<p><strong>MASCULINE NOUNS IN इ AND उ</strong></p>
<p>The nominative and accusative plurals have two forms andthey are the same for both the cases, as <strong>अग्गी</strong> and <strong>अग्गयो,भिक्खू</strong> and<strong>भिक्खवो</strong>. Now <strong>अग्गी</strong> and <strong>भिक्खू</strong> are the Sanskrit accusative plurals<strong>अग्नीन्</strong>and <strong>भिक्षून्,</strong> and <strong>अग्गपो</strong> and <strong>भिक्खवो</strong>the nominative plurals<strong>अग्नयः</strong> and <strong>भिक्षवः</strong>.The distinction between the two is lost, andboth are used indifferently in the sense of the nominative andaccusative.</p>
<p>The termination of the instrumental plural is <strong>भि</strong> or <strong>हि</strong>. Thesingulars of the genitive and locative are, like those of the corresponding neuter nouns or nouns ending in <strong>इन्</strong> such as <strong>दण्डिन्</strong>, formedby the addition of <strong>न्</strong>, as <strong>अग्गिनो</strong>and <strong>भिक्खुनो</strong>, <strong>अग्गिनि</strong> and <strong>भिक्खुनि</strong>.They have also the forms indicated in the general remarks, viz.,<strong>अग्गिस्स</strong> and <strong>भिक्खुस्स</strong>and <strong>अग्गिंस्मि</strong>–<strong>म्हि</strong> and <strong>भिक्खुस्मि</strong>–<strong>म्हि</strong> and thedative and ablative are, as usual, like the genitive and instrumental. The vocative is like the nominative, except in the pluralof nouns in <strong>उ</strong> which ends in <strong>वो</strong> or <strong>वे</strong> as <strong>भिक्खवो</strong> or <strong>भिक्खवे</strong>. The restare old or Sanskrit; the final vowel being, however, lengthened inthe plural of the instrumental and locative, and the syllable <strong>ग्नि</strong>of <strong>अग्नि</strong> being optionally dissolved into <strong>ग्गिनि</strong> in the nominativesingular.</p>
<p><strong>MASCULINE NOUNS IN ऋ</strong></p>
<p>The nominative has the old Sanskrit forms; as <strong>सत्था</strong> and heart <strong>सत्थारो</strong></p>
<p>for <strong>शास्ता</strong> and <strong>शास्तारः</strong>from <strong>शास्तृ</strong>. The accusative plural is thesame as the nominative plural. The augmented form of theSanskrit nominative plural, <em>viz.</em> <strong>सत्थार</strong> for <strong>शास्तार</strong>,is taken as thebase for the plural of the instrumental, genitive, and locative,and declined like nouns in <strong>अ</strong>. The genitive plural is also formedby taking the nominative singular as the base, as <strong>सत्थानं</strong>. Theinstrumental singular has the new base and the old termination<strong>आ</strong>; and thus we have <strong>सत्थारा</strong>. The genitive singular has threeforms, one of them being the old one with the final <strong>र्</strong> dropped, as <strong>सत्थु</strong>, and the other two made up by taking this form as the base,and appending the terminations which nouns in उ as <strong>भिक्खु</strong>take,as <strong>सत्थुस्स</strong> or <strong>सत्थुनो</strong>. The singulars of the accusative and locativehave the Sanskrit forms, as <strong>सत्थारं</strong>and <strong>सत्थार</strong>; and the vocativesingular has besides the old one another with the vowel lengthened,as <strong>सत्थ</strong> or <strong>सत्था</strong>. You will thus see that there are four bases, theold one which gives the old forms, and three new ones, <strong>सत्था</strong>and<strong>सत्थार</strong> generalized from the nominative, and सत्थु, from the genitive.</p>
<p><strong>MASCULINE NOUNS ENDING IN A CONSONANT.</strong></p>
<p>There can be no consonantal declension proper, since a finalconsonant is dropped, and the noun treated as one ending in thepreceding vowel. But relics of the Sanskrit forms of the consonantal bases are preserved and used along with the others.</p>
<p>In the declension of the noun <strong>आत्मन्</strong>, there are two new bases<strong>अत्त</strong> and <strong>अत्तन</strong>, generalized from the forms of the singular of theSanskrit nominative, and of the instrumentals and others, <strong>आत्मा</strong>and <strong>आत्मना</strong> &amp;c., and declined like nouns in . The first is usedin the singular of the accusative, and the plurals of the genitiveand locative, which are <strong>अन्नं, अत्तानं</strong> and <strong>अत्तेसु</strong>; and the second inthe plural of the instrumental which is <strong>अत्तनेहि-भि</strong>. The remainingforms are old, the portion <strong>आत्म</strong>being corrupted to <strong>अत्त</strong>; they are<strong>अत्ता</strong> nominative singular, <strong>अत्तानो</strong>nominative and accusative plural,<strong>अत्तानं</strong> accusstive singular, <strong>अत्तना</strong> instrumental Biupulor, <strong>अत्तनो</strong>genitive singular, and <strong>अत्तनि</strong> locative singular. The vocative is<strong>अत्त</strong> or <strong>अत्ता</strong>, like that of nouns in <strong>अ</strong>.</p>
<p>In the declension of the noun <strong>राजन्</strong>, the base <strong>राज</strong> is used in thesingulars of the accusative, the instrumental, and perhaps theablative also, and the forms are<strong>राजं, राजेन</strong>, and <strong>राजस्मा</strong> or <strong>राजम्हा</strong>.</p>
<p>The old forms are found in the nominative (राजा, राजानो), and inthe singular of the accusative which has thus two forms <strong>राजं</strong> and<strong>राजानं</strong>, and the plural of this last case is, as usual, the same asthat of the first. The singulars of the instrumental, genitive, and locative are the same as those in Sanskrit, but <strong>ज्ञ</strong> beingchanged to <strong>ञ्त्र</strong>, we have <strong>रञ्त्रा</strong>, <strong>रञ्ञो</strong>, and <strong>रञ्ञि</strong>. In the last twocases the conjunct is also dissolved into <strong>जिन</strong>, wherefore we have<strong>राजिनो</strong> and <strong>राजिनि</strong> also. The genitive plural in <strong>रञ्ञं</strong> and, <strong>ज्ञ</strong> beingdissolved into <strong>जुन</strong>, the form <strong>राजूनं</strong> is used, in addition. This <strong>रज्जु</strong>is made the base of the plurals of the instrumental and locative;and thus we have <strong>राजूभि-हि</strong> and <strong>राजूसु</strong>. The vocative singular islike that of nouns in <strong>अ</strong>.</p>
<p>The suffixes <strong>वत्</strong> and <strong>मत्</strong> of such nouns as <strong>गुणवत्</strong> and <strong>सतिमत्</strong> areregarded as if they were <strong>वन्त</strong> and <strong>मन्त</strong>, and the nouns declined likethose ending in at in the singulars of the nominative, accusativeand genitive, and in the plurals of the accusative, instrumental, genitive and locative; and, according to the commentator of Kacchāyana,in the singulars of the instrumental and locative also; as <strong>गुणवन्तो,गुणवन्तं गुणवन्तस्म, गुणवन्ते, गुणवन्तोभि-हि</strong>, <strong>गुणवन्तानं</strong> and <strong>गुणवन्तेसु</strong>; also<strong>गुणवन्तेन</strong> and <strong>गुणवन्तस्मिं-म्हि.</strong> The old forms are preserved in bothnumbers of the nominative and genitive, and in the singulars ofthe instrumental, locative, and vocative; as <strong>गुणवा, गुणवन्तो, गुणवतो,गुणवतं गुणवता, गुणवति</strong>, and <strong>गुणवं</strong>, The nominstive singular is madethe base of other forms of the singulars of the accusative, genitiveand vocative, as <strong>गुणवं, गुणवस्स</strong> and <strong>गुणव</strong>or <strong>गुणवा</strong>. The present participles, Parasmaipada, are similarly declined, the only differencebeing in the nominative singular, as <strong>गच्छं</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>FEMININE NOUNS</strong></p>
<p>The nominative, besides the old forms, has another transferredfrom nouns in <strong>ई</strong>; as <strong>कञ्ञायो</strong>. The singulars of the instrumentaland the succeeding cases, excepting the vocative, have one sameform made up from the Sanskrit genitive by dropping the visargaand shortening the final vowel; as <strong>कञ्ञाय</strong>, instrumental, dative,ablative, genitive, and locative singular. The others andalso the locative singular have the old forms; as <strong>कञ्ञाभि-हि</strong>instrumental and ablative plural, <strong>कञ्ञानं</strong> genitive and dativeplural, and <strong>कञ्ञायं</strong>and <strong>कञ्ञासु</strong>locative singular and plural.</p>
<p>The final member <strong>य</strong> of the conjunct which appears in the caseforms of nouns i<strong>n ई</strong> such as <strong>नन्दी</strong>, is dissolved into <strong>इय</strong>, and thus wehave <strong>नदियो</strong> from the Sanskrit <strong>नद्य</strong>; and this and <strong>नदी</strong> from theSanskrit <strong>नदीः</strong>are both of them the plurals of the nominative andaccusative; <strong>नद्या</strong>the singular of the instrumental is dissolved into<strong>नदिया</strong>, and also <strong>नद्याः</strong> of the ablative and genitive which, afterdropping the visarga, becomes नद्याः^(<strong>*</strong>); and this is extended to thelocative singular, which has also another form <strong>नदियं</strong>, from <strong>नद्याम्</strong>.There is nothing particular about the rest. Nouns in short <strong>इ</strong> aredeclined in exactly the same way, except that Kacchāyana givessuch forms as <strong>रत्त्या</strong>and <strong>रत्त्यं</strong>in addition to <strong>रत्तिया</strong> and <strong>रत्तियं</strong> for thesingular of the ablative and locative.</p>
<p>Nouns in <strong>उ</strong> or <strong>ऊ</strong> follow completely the analogy of those in <strong>ई</strong>;the forms of <strong>वधू</strong>, for instance, are not derived from the corresponding Sanskrit forms of the noun, but are made up by adding thefinal syllables of those of <strong>नदी</strong>; as <strong>वधुयो</strong>nominative and accusativeplural, <strong>वधुया</strong> singular instrumental, ablative, genitive, &amp;c.</p>
<p><strong>NEUTER NOUNS</strong></p>
<p>The singular of the nominative and accusative of neuter nounsending in a vowel is the same as in the parent tongue, but theforms of the plural are optionally like those of the correspondingmasculine nouns; as <strong>रूपा</strong> or <strong>रूपानि</strong> nominative plural, and <strong>रूपे</strong> orरू<strong>पानि</strong>accusative plural; <strong>अट्ठी</strong> ( like <strong>अग्गी</strong>) or <strong>अट्ठीनि</strong>nominative andaccusative plural, <strong>आयू</strong> or <strong>आयूनि</strong> nominative and accusative plural.</p>
<p>As in the case of masculine nouns, such neuter uouns as have&amp; final consonant in Sanskrit drop it and are treated as if theyended in the preceding vowel. But in the singulars the old formsare preserved; as <strong>मनो</strong>or <strong>मनं</strong>nominative and accusative, <strong>मनसा</strong>or<strong>मनेन</strong> instrumental, <strong>मनसो</strong> genitive, <strong>मनसि, मने</strong> or <strong>मनस्मि-म्हि</strong> locative.</p>
<p><strong>PRONOUNS</strong></p>
<p>As pronominal terminations have been transferred to nouns,a few nominal ones have been extended to pronouns, thus carryingon the process of unification a step further. The plural of thenominative of feminine pronouns has a form ending in <strong>यो</strong>, and thesingulars of the instrumental and genitive end in <strong>आय</strong> or <strong>या</strong> andthat of the locative in <strong>यं</strong>, as in the case of the correspondingnouns as <strong>तायो</strong> nominative plural, <strong>ताय</strong> or <strong>तस्सा, इमाय</strong> or <strong>इमस्सा अमुया</strong>or <strong>अमुस्सा</strong> genitive singular and <strong>तायं</strong> or <strong>तस्सं, इमायं</strong> or<strong>इमिस्सं, असूयं</strong> or<strong>अमुस्सं</strong> locative singular, of <strong>तद्, इदम्</strong>and <strong>अदम्</strong>. All pronouns of thethird person, of whatever gender, form the genitive plural byadding <strong>सं</strong> from the Sanskrit <strong>साम्</strong>, and also <strong>सानं</strong> which is made upof <strong>सं</strong>, the pronominal, and <strong>नं</strong>, the nominal termination, so that thesecond form is the genitive of the first taken as a base, as <strong>तेसं</strong>or<strong>तेसानं</strong>, <strong>तासं</strong> or <strong>तासानं</strong>, &amp;c. Similarly, the bases <strong>एती</strong> and <strong>इमी</strong> which are substituted for <strong>एता</strong>and <strong>इमा</strong> in the singulars of the genitiveand locative, and <strong>ती</strong> which optionally replaces <strong>ता</strong> in these cases,have a genitive singular with a double termination; as <strong>तस्सा</strong>, <strong>तिस्सा</strong>or <strong>तिस्साय, एतिस्सा</strong> or <strong>एतिस्साय, इमिस्सा</strong> or <strong>इमिस्साय</strong>, where <strong>स्सा</strong>, Sanskrit<strong>स्याः</strong>, is the pronominal, and <strong>आय</strong> the nominal termination. Theplurals of the nominative and accusative have the same form, as<strong>ते, सब्बे,</strong> <strong>ता</strong>or <strong>तायो</strong>, &amp;c., and the instrumental plural of the masculine has, like that of nouns, the termination <strong>एभि</strong>or <strong>एहि</strong>. Theremaining terminations are the same as in Sanskrit.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>*****The Sanskrit form नद्या corrupted to नज्जा is also found used.</p>
<p>The correlative or remote demonstrative <strong>तद्</strong>has, besides theusual Sanskrit base, another <strong>न</strong> which has all the cases <strong>नं, नेन</strong>, &amp;c.,except the nominative singular. The base is generalized fromthe <strong>एनम्, एनेन</strong> &amp;c. of the accusative, the singular of the instrumental, and the dual of the genitive and locative, which are usedin making <em>anvādeśa</em>as it is called by Pāṇini, <em>i. e.</em> in referring toone who has already been spoken of. The near demonstrativeइदम् has two bases, <strong>अ</strong> and <strong>इम</strong>. In Sanskrit this latter is used inthe nominative dual and plural and in the accusative. Here it isextended to all the cases except the nominative singular, and sowe have <strong>इमे, इमिना, इमेहि, इमस्मा, इमस्स, इमेसं,</strong> <strong>इमस्मिं</strong>, and <strong>इमेसु; इमाय,इमिस्सा</strong>, &amp;c. The first base is used, as in Sanskrit, in all casesexcept the plural of the nominative and accusative and the formsare <strong>अयं, अनेन</strong>, ए<strong>हि, अस्मा</strong> &amp;c. The pronoun <strong>अदस्</strong>has the base <strong>असु</strong> for thenominative singular, and <strong>अमु</strong> for all other cases and this latter islengthened in the plural; as <strong>अमुना, अमूहि अमुस्मा,</strong> <strong>अमुस्स, अमूसं;अमुया,अमुस्सा,</strong> &amp;c. The nominative and accusative of the neuter is <strong>अदुं</strong>.</p>
<p>The singulars of the pronouns of the first and second personsare the same as in Sanskrit as <strong>अहं, मं, मया, मम</strong> or <strong>मे</strong>, snd <strong>मयि;त्वं, त्वं, त्वया, त</strong>वor <strong>ते</strong>, and <strong>त्वयि.</strong> This syllable is optionally dissolved</p>
<p>into <strong>तु</strong>in the nominative and accusative, which have thus <strong>तुवं</strong>,and changed to <strong>त</strong>in the latter as well as in the instrumental andlocative; and so we have <strong>तं, तया</strong>and <strong>तयि</strong>also. The dative andgenitive being confounded, the Sanskrit <strong>मह्यम्</strong>and <strong>तुभ्यम्</strong> of theformer are in the form of <strong>मय्हं</strong>and <strong>तुय्हं</strong> used for both cases. Thelatter has also the forms <strong>ममं</strong> and <strong>अम्हं</strong> and <strong>तुम्हं</strong>, the anusvāra beinginserted from the analogy of the plural. The plural of <strong>अहं</strong>is<strong>मयं</strong> in which the initial <strong>व</strong> of the Sanskrit form is changed to <strong>म</strong>; andin the accusative, instrumental, and locative, the Sanskrit base<strong>अस्म</strong> in the form <strong>अम्ह</strong> is declined like the masculine <strong>तद्</strong>, and theforms are <strong>अम्हे</strong> <strong>अम्हेहि</strong> and <strong>अम्हेसु</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>यु</strong> of <strong>युष्मद्</strong>was probably weakly pronounced, hence thesingular base <strong>तु</strong> has been transferred to the plural, and the peculiarsyllable of this number <strong>स्म</strong> tacked on to it, and the whole in theform of <strong>तुम्ह</strong> is declined like <strong>तद्</strong> in all the cases except the genitive;as <strong>तुम्हे, तुम्हे, तुम्हेहि</strong>&amp;c.The forms of the plurals of the last arelike those in Sanskrit, as <strong>अम्हाकं</strong> and <strong>तुम्हाकं</strong>. The accusative singulars of these pronouns have the forms <strong>ममं</strong> and <strong>तवं</strong>, besides thosementioned above. These are made up by adding anusvāra, thesign of the accusative, to the form of the genitive used as a base.</p>
<p>On the same principle we have <strong>अम्हाकं</strong>and <strong>तुम्हाकं</strong>for the plural,but as the genitive forms have an anusvära already, the additionof the accusative sign makes no difference. This is an isolatedinstance in this dialect of a method of constructing new caseforms, which is, we shall find as we proceed in our investigations,largely used in the later dialects and especially in the modernvernaculars.</p>
<p>You will have seen how naturally the new formations we havenoticed grew up. A language is well learnt by others or correctlytransmitted to them only when they are in constant and closeintercourse with those who know it, or when they are deliberatelytaught. When for some reason or other this is not the case,and the linguistic tradition is imperfect, men proceed from whatis more in use and consequently better known to that which isless used and less known. Nouns in , for instance, constitutea very large portion of the ordinary Sanskrit names. Their case.forms were most used, whence they were well known and those ofthe other nouns not being so often used were less known. In</p>
<p>these cases these less forms had to conform to the model of themore known, and thus we see a tendency to bring nouns as closeas possible to the <strong>अ</strong> declension, as you have seen in such nouns as<strong>आत्मन्, गुणवत्, गच्छत् शास्तृ</strong>, and even <strong>अग्नि</strong>. And it is also clear thatthe new <strong>अ</strong> base is generally taken from the nominative, whichcase is oftener used than others as <strong>अत्त, गुणवन्त इच्छन्त</strong>, and <strong>सत्तार</strong><em>i. e.</em> <strong>शास्तार</strong>. In the same way we have observed a strong tendencyto obliterate the distinction between the nominal and pronominaldeclensions, and fuse them into one, and this tendency hassucceeded everywhere except in the genitive plural. Stillat the time when Pali arose, the traditions of the originalSanskrit were not entirely lost, wherefore we have oftenold forms used side by side with the new ones. The same process is observable in the conjugations of verbs, as I havealready remarked. It will thus be seengroundless is the opinion of those who maintain that these Prakrits orderived languages were simply literary languages, or were constructed by Pandits. But this point will be discussed at lengthhereafter.</p>
<p>Inattention to this law of false analogies or generalization, andto the wide range of its operation in the formation of Paligrammar has led some scholars to set down as Vedic certain formswhich exist in this dialectbut are not to be met with in classicalSanskrit. Such are <strong>इमस्स</strong> the genitive singular masculine of <strong>इदम्,फला</strong> the nominative plural of <strong>फल, अट्टी</strong> and <strong>मधू</strong> nominstive andaccusative plural of <strong>अस्थि</strong> and <strong>मधु, अम्हे</strong> the general plural baseof the pronoun of the first person, and genitive plural of <strong>गो</strong>. Isee no icason why should be regarded as Vedic and notthe other forms that have <strong>इम</strong> for their base, such ss <strong>इमस्मा, इमेसं</strong>,&amp;c., or why <strong>फला</strong>should be so and not <strong>फले</strong> the accusative plural;<strong>अम्ह</strong> and not <strong>तुम्हे, अट्ठी</strong>and not <strong>अट्ठिस्स,</strong> or <strong>गोनं</strong> and not <strong>अभिभूनं</strong>. Ifthese latter forms and a host of others must be explained with reference to a thoroughly different principle, why should the former,which are kindred to them and are as completely capable of thatsame explanation, be traced to a Vedic origin? The fact that theyhappen to resemble certain Vedic forms does not prove theirderivation from them. The same process of generalization and thesame natural tendency to construct the less known forms from the</p>
<p>analogy of those that are more known brought them all into use.The former <strong>फला</strong> and <strong>फले</strong> and <strong>अट्ठी</strong> and <strong>मधू</strong> are, as stated before, madeup upon the analogy of the corresponding masonline, and hereinwe observe the beginning of a tendency to obliterate the distinction between the masculine and neuter, which went on progressing until now, in the Hindi, Sindhi, and other vernaculars ofNorthern India, the neuter gender has totally disappeared, whilein the Marathi the distinction remains in the case of pronounsand certain nouns, and in the Gujarati only in the latter.</p>
<p><strong>II</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE VERB.</strong></p>
<p>We will now examine the Pali verb. The distinction betweerthe special and general tenses and moods is almost lost, thespecial form being used in the general, as in <strong>गच्छिस्सति</strong>the futureof <strong>गम्</strong>, or the general form in the special as <strong>गमेति</strong>. We have also<strong>गमिस्सति</strong> and <strong>गच्छति</strong>.A large number of roots used in ordinary intercourse belong in Sanskrit to the first conjugation; this and thesixth are the easiest of the ten; in many cases there is no practical distinction between them, and in others they are so greatlylike each other that they are capable of being confused together.Hence the rule of constructing verbal forms common to thesetwo conjugations, <em>viz</em>. the additition of the personal terminationsthrough the intervention of <strong>अ</strong>, has become general in Pali. Agood many roots belonging to the other classes are conjugatedaccording to this rule; as <strong>दोहति,</strong> <strong>विदति</strong>, and <strong>रवति</strong>, for <strong>दोग्धि, वेत्ति,</strong> and<strong>रौति</strong>, of the second class; <strong>पोसति</strong> for <strong>पुष्यति</strong>, <strong>मुसति</strong> and <strong>बन्धति</strong> for <strong>मुष्णाति</strong>and <strong>बध्नाति</strong>, &amp;c. The tenth conjugation is almost equally commonin Sanskrit, whence a great many roots are conjugated necessarilyor optionally in this way; as <strong>वदेमि</strong> or<strong>वदामि, गमेति</strong> or <strong>गच्छति,सिलेसेति, वेदेति</strong> or <strong>विदति विगाहेति</strong> &amp;c. from <strong>वद्, गम, श्लिष्विद, गाह्</strong>with<strong>वि</strong>, &amp;c. The <strong>ए</strong> in these formis stands, you will remember, for theSanskrit <strong>अय</strong>, which is the characteristic of the tenth class.</p>
<p>The second conjugation has gone out, except in isolated formssuch as <strong>अत्थि</strong> for <strong>अस्ति</strong>, and the third has left some reduplicatedroots, as <strong>ददामि, जहाति</strong>, &amp;c. The fourth has preserved a good manyof its roots but its u is corrupted according to the usual phoneticrules thus <strong>बुध्य</strong> becomes <strong>बुझ पद्य,पज्ज;नृत्य,नच्च;मञ्ञ</strong>&amp;c. The</p>
<p>fifth and the ninth are confounded, and roots of the former takethe termination of the latter also as <strong>पापुणोति</strong> or <strong>पावुणाति</strong> for <strong>प्राप्नोति;सुणोति</strong> or <strong>सुणाति</strong> for <strong>शृणोति;सक्कोति</strong> or <strong>सक्कणाति</strong> for <strong>शक्नोति</strong>&amp;c. In thelast instance the base is <strong>सक्क</strong> derived from <strong>सक्कोति</strong> the corruption of<strong>शक्नोति</strong>, thus showing that the forms in <strong>ना</strong>are a later growth. Theseventh inserts, as before remarked, a nasal in the body of theroots and transfers them to the first; the eighth remains in a fewcases such as <strong>तन्</strong> and <strong>कृ</strong>, though this last takes a peculiar formalso, as <strong>तनोति, करोति</strong> or <strong>कयिरति</strong>; and the ninth adds <strong>ना</strong>as in Sanskrit,as <strong>किणाति, धुनाति लुनाति पुनाति</strong>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>But it is to be observed that the more common of the rootsbelonging to these conjugations only have preserved their peculiarforms; the rest are conjugated according to the rules of the first,sixth, or tonth. Since the distinction between the special andgeneral tenses and moods is lost, the effect of these conjugationalpeculiarities is only to constitute a new or augmented root.</p>
<p>Of the ten tenses and moods in Sanskrit, the Pali has lost two,the first future and the precative. The two Padas or voicesremain, but the distinction is lost in most cases, such forms as<strong>वुच्चति, लब्भति, पच्चति</strong>&amp;c., though passive, taking Parasmaipadaterminations.</p>
<p>The following are the terminations:—</p>

<p>The terminations of the Present of both Padas are the same asin Sanskrit, with the exception of the plural <strong>ञ</strong>and <strong>म्हे</strong>, the <strong>व्ह</strong>of the second person plural of the Ātmanepada being a corruptionof <strong>ध्वे</strong>. This tense is most in use; hence the Pali speakers learnedit well, so to say, from their Sanskrit teachers.</p>
<p>The other tenses,— except the Future which, like the Present,is also entirely Sanskrit and the moods have preserved such oftheir forms as are more frequently used in ordinary life.Thereis, for instance, greater occasion for the use of the second personsingular of the Imperative Mood, and also for the third personHence these are the same as in Sanskrit, but the second personplural termination <strong>थ</strong> , and the first person singular <strong>मि</strong>and theplural <strong>म</strong>, Parasmaipada, have been transferred from the Present.As to these, even in Sanskrit we find the Present used verygenerally for this Mood in the first person; as in <strong>किं ते भूयःप्रियमुपहराामि</strong>Śāk.,<strong>किं ते भूयः प्रियं करोमि</strong> Mṛc., &amp;c. where the formsshould be <strong>उपहराणि, करवाणि</strong> &amp;e. The rest are the same as in Sanskrit.The second person singular is formed in two ways, <em>viz.</em> withoutadding any termination as in the conjugations which give anending <strong>अ</strong> to the base, and by appending <strong>हि</strong> as is done in theothers. The Ātmanepada <strong>स्व</strong> is changed to <strong>स्सु</strong>, the <strong>व</strong> being dissolved into <strong>उ</strong>, since <strong>स्व</strong> renders the previous vowel heavy, theresulting <strong>सु</strong> is doubled to preserve that effect. The plural <strong>ध्वम्</strong> isaltered to <strong>व्हो</strong>, the <strong>म</strong> and the mute element being dropped, we have<strong>व्ह</strong> the final vowel of which is transformed into <strong>ओ</strong> through theinfluence of the preceding <strong>व्</strong>. The <strong>ऐ</strong> of the first person singularbecomes <strong>ए</strong>, or this may be considered to have been transferredfrom the Present, and for the plural we have <strong>आमसे</strong> which is anold Vedic termination of the Ātmanepads first person plural corrupted in Sanskrit to <strong>आमहे</strong>. The <strong>तं</strong> and <strong>अन्तं</strong> of the third personare the same as the <strong>ताम्</strong> and <strong>अन्ताम्</strong> of the parent language.</p>
<p>The Potential has preserved the old forms of the third persononly, <em>viz</em>., <strong>पचे</strong> for <strong>पचेत्</strong>, and <strong>पचेय्युं</strong>for <strong>पचेयुः</strong>.The <strong>य</strong> is doubled as in<strong>थेय्यं</strong> for <strong>स्तेय</strong> according to a general rule which we have noticedbefore. The singular of this person is also formed by adding <strong>एय्य</strong>made up on the analogy of the plural <strong>एय्यु</strong> and also of such formsas <strong>सुनुयात्</strong>. The final vowel is, however, shortened, but in suchessesas <strong>जानीया</strong>for <strong>जानीयात्</strong> it remains long. This form with thefinal long is used as a base, and the terminations of the firstperson and second person of the Present added to it to form the</p>
<p>corresponding person of the Potential. The Ātmanepada <strong>एथ, एर</strong>,and <strong>एथो</strong> are the same as <strong>एत, एरन्</strong>, and <strong>एथा</strong>: of the Sanskrit <strong>अ</strong>-conjugations, the <strong>त</strong> of <strong>एत</strong> being rendered an aspirate and the <strong>आ</strong> of<strong>एथाः</strong> shortened. The Parasmaipada singular <strong>एयम्</strong> as in <strong>पचेयम्</strong> isadapted for the Ātmanepada in the form <strong>एय्यं</strong> and the plurals ofthe second and first persons are formed by taking <strong>एय्य</strong> as the baseand appending <strong>ध्वम्</strong> corrupted to <strong>व्हो</strong> and <strong>म्हे</strong> of the Present.</p>
<p>In the Imperfect the <strong>आ</strong>and <strong>ऊ</strong> of the third person seem to begeneralized from such forms as <strong>अयात्</strong> and अ<strong>युः</strong>. The termination <strong>उम्</strong>is, as you know, applied in Sanskrit optionally to roots endingin आand necessarily to <strong>विद्</strong>and such as are reduplicated. The<strong>आ</strong> of the singular, however, may be considered as due to thelengthening of the previous अof such Sanskrit forms of the<strong>अ</strong>-conjugations as <strong>अपचत्</strong>, when the final consonant was dropped.This lengthening was brought about by the forcible pronunciationof the <strong>अ</strong> rendered necessary in Sanskrit by the final consonant.The second person singular is <strong>ओ</strong>, which corresponds to theSanskrit <strong>अः</strong>, and <strong>अ</strong> of the first person singular to the <strong>अम्</strong> with thenasal dropped. The Ātmanepada second person singulari <strong>से</strong> istransferred from the Present, <strong>व्हं</strong> is <strong>ध्वम्,</strong> and <strong>इ</strong> is generalized fromthe forms of the non-<strong>अ</strong>-conjugations, such as <strong>अलुनि, अददि</strong>, &amp;c. ThePerfect has preserved the third person singular <strong>अ</strong> and plural <strong>उ</strong>and the first person singular <strong>अ</strong>, of the Parasmaipada; and <strong>रे</strong> ofthe Ātmanepada. Of the rest, <strong>ए</strong> second person singular Parasmaipada is perhaps the <strong>ए</strong> of the Sanskrit Ātmanepada singular of thefirst and third persons; and the <strong>इ</strong> of the Ātmanepada is transferredfrom the Imperfect.</p>
<p>In the Aorist the third person singular <strong>ई</strong>is the termination ofthe fifth form of the Sanskrit Aorist with the final <strong>त्</strong>dropped asusual; and the plural <strong>उं</strong> is generalized from such forms as <strong>अस्थुः</strong>,Some roots, such as <strong>भू</strong> and <strong>कः</strong> have far <strong>सि</strong> for the singular as <strong>अहोसि</strong>,and <strong>अकासि</strong>, the <strong>सि</strong>of which is to be traced to <strong>सांत्</strong>. Another pluraltermination is <strong>इसु</strong> in which we can recognize the Sanskrit <strong>इषुः</strong>. Thesecond person singular <strong>ओ</strong> is from the <strong>अम्</strong> of the second Aorist;and the first person singular is <strong>इं</strong> resulting from the fusion of theaugment <strong>इ</strong> with the <strong>अम्</strong> of the second Aorist. The third personsingular and plural and the first person singular of the Ātmanepada are the same as the corresponding ones of the ParasmaipadaImperfect, both numbers of the second person are the same as thecorresponding Ātmanepada of the Imperfect, and the <strong>म्हे</strong> of thefirst person plural is transferred from the Present.</p>
<p>The terminations of the Second Future are made up as inSanskrit by prefixing <strong>स्स = स्य</strong>to those of the Present. The Ātmanepada first person singular has however <strong>स्सं</strong> instead of <strong>स्से</strong>. Inone instance, <em>viz</em>., <strong>होहिति, होहिन्ति</strong>from <strong>हो</strong>, the <strong>स्स</strong> is corrupted to <strong>इ</strong>.In the Conditional terminations the <strong>स्स</strong> occurs everywhere, butthe other portions are transferred from other tenses. The ending <strong>आ</strong>of the third person singular <strong>स्सा</strong> is of course the <strong>आ</strong> of theImperfect; the <strong>अंसु</strong> of the plural has been transferred from theAorist, Imperfect, or Potential; the <strong>से</strong> and <strong>थ</strong> of <strong>स्से</strong> and <strong>स्सथ</strong> arebrought over from the Ātmanepada and Parasmaipada of thePresent; <strong>स्सं</strong> is <strong>स्यम्</strong>, and the <strong>म्हा</strong> of <strong>स्तम्हा</strong> the plural is from theImperfect. In Sanskrit, the short terminations of the Imperfect and other tenses are added to the <strong>स्य</strong> in the Conditional;but herethere is a mixture of both the short and the long, and also of thetwo Padas. We find the same mixture in the Ātmanepada.</p>
<p>It will thus appear that the Present and Future have preservedmost of the Sanskrit terminations, and the other tenses only abouttwo or three. Besides the terminations that have thus been preserved or transferred by analogy from one tense to another, thereare others which cannot be thus explained. Such are <strong>म्हे</strong> Ātmanepada first person plural of the Present; <strong>त्थ</strong> and <strong>म्ह</strong> of the Parasmaipada second and first person plural, and <strong>त्थ</strong> third person singular. <strong>त्थो</strong>second person singular and <strong>म्हे</strong> first person plural of the Ātmanepada of the Perfect; <strong>त्थ</strong>second person plural and <strong>म्हां</strong> first personplural Parasmaipada, and <strong>त्थ</strong> and <strong>त्थुं</strong>third person singular andplural and <strong>म्हसे</strong> first person plural Ātmanepada, of the Imperfect;<strong>त्थ</strong> second person plural and <strong>म्हा</strong> first person plural Parasmaipadaof the Aorist, and <strong>म्हे</strong> first person plural of the Ātmanepada of thesame; <strong>म्हे</strong> first person plural Ātmanepada of the Future;and <strong>ह्मा</strong>Parasmaipada and <strong>म्हसे</strong> Ātmanepada of the first person of the Conditional. These are unquestionably forms of the root <strong>अम्</strong>tackedon to the base in the particular tenses when the old terminationswere forgotten, or some of them may be traced directly to the terminations of the Sanskrit Aorist, <strong>स्त, स्थाः</strong>and <strong>स्म</strong>, which themselves,</p>
<p>as you know, are forms of <strong>अम्</strong>. Of these, the Parasmaipadasecond person plural is <strong>त्थ</strong> to be traced to the correspondingSanskrit <strong>स्य</strong> of the Present of <strong>अम्</strong> and <strong>म्ह</strong> and <strong>म्हा</strong> first person pluralto the <strong>स्म</strong>of <strong>आस्म</strong>of the Imperfect and <strong>स्मः</strong> of the Present respectively. The penultimate <strong>अ</strong> of स्मःis lengthened for the same reasonas that of <strong>अपचत्</strong> is in forming <strong>अपचा</strong>. The Ātmanepada <strong>त्थो</strong>of thesecond singular comes from the <strong>स्थाः</strong>of <strong>आस्थाः</strong>of the Imperfect, <strong>त्थ</strong>third person singular, from the <strong>स्त</strong> of <strong>अस्त</strong>of the same; and <strong>म्हे</strong>and<strong>ह्यसे</strong> first person plural are to be referred to such Ātmanepadaforms as <strong>स्मे</strong> and <strong>स्मसे</strong>. Of the last two, <strong>स्मे</strong> appears to be a newformation form <strong>स्म</strong>, and <strong>स्मसे</strong> is the old Vedic archetype of <strong>स्महे</strong>.</p>
<p>You will thus see that when the original Sanskrit forms wereforgotten, new ones corresponding to them were constructed in thePali, not only by the use of false analogies, but also by taking oneform distinctively expressive of the sense of a particular mood ortense as a base, and appending first only the personal terminationsof the Present, as in the case of the Potential; and secondly, theforms of the root <strong>अम्</strong>. You will hereafter find that the modernvernaculars have resorted to one at least of these two modes of reconstruction; and similarly, the beginnings in the Pali of a modeof constructing new case-forms widely prevalent in the moderndialects was brought to your notice before; so that the spirit orturn of mind which has been in operation in the formation of thevernacular speech of the country, has been the same since veryremote times.</p>
<p>The terminations with an initial consonant are in the generaltenses appended through the intervention of the vowel <strong>ह</strong>; but insome cases there are forms directly corrupted from Sanskrit; as<strong>दक्खति</strong> Sanskrit <strong>द्रक्ष्यति, मोक्खति = मोक्ष्यति</strong>. The temporal augment <strong>अ</strong>is often omitted, as <strong>गमा</strong> or <strong>अगमा, गमी</strong> Or <strong>अगमी, गमिस्सा</strong> or <strong>अगमिस्सा</strong>.The several varieties of the Aorist, and the many special forms ofthe Perfect, have for the most part gone out of use. The Passiveis formed by the addition of <strong>य</strong> as in Sanskrit, sometimes with theaugiment <strong>इ</strong>, sometimes without, in which last case the conjunctconsonant is corrupted according to the prevailing rules; as<strong>बुज्झियते, पच्चते, लब्भते, करियते</strong>.The forms in a good many cases arethe same in Sankrit, only phonetically altered; as <strong>थीयते, उच्चसे, इज्जते</strong>in which cases we see the that the <strong>आ</strong>of <strong>स्था</strong>is changed to <strong>ई</strong>, and</p>
<p><strong>वच्</strong> and <strong>यज्</strong> under Samprasāraṇa. The causal is formed by adding<strong>आपे</strong> or <strong>आपय</strong> and <strong>ए</strong> or <strong>आय</strong>; as <strong>कारापेति</strong> or <strong>कारापयति</strong> and <strong>कारेति</strong> or <strong>कारप</strong>ति.These forms I have already explained. The Past Passive Participle is formed as in Sanskrit, and in many cases the forms are thesame. The Absolutive is formed by using the terminations <strong>तून,त्वान</strong>, and <strong>त्वा</strong>. The first is the same as the second, the semivowel <strong>क</strong>having only undergone Samprasāraṇa; and they are to be tracedto such Vedic forms as <strong>इष्ट्वीन, कृत्वान</strong> &amp;c., which have disappearedin Classical Sanskrit. The Infinitive is formed by adding <strong>तुं</strong> as inSanskrit, or <strong>तवे</strong>which, I have already observed, is one of the manyways in which the Vedio Infinitive is formed. It has becomeobsolete in the later Sanskrit.</p>
<p>Now if the Pali grew up naturally in the manner I have described, it could not come to possess the several grammatical formsit exhibits unless they were in use in Sankrit at the time when itbranched off. It has, as we have seen, preserved eight of the tenTenses and Moods, whence it follows that verbal forms of thesewere then currant in the language. Pali therefore represents.iddle Sanskrit or the usage that prevailed during the periodbetween the composition of the Brāhmaṇas and Yāska or Pāṇiniand must have begun to be formed during that period. We shallhereafter find that latter Prakrits represent the third stage in thedevelopment of the Sanskrit that in which a good many of theverbal forms ceased to be used; and thus bear to what I havecalled classical Sanskrit the same relation that the Pali does toMiddle Sanskrit.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>We will now proceed to consider those valuable specimens ofthe ancient languages of the country which have been preserved inInscriptions. The most important of these are the edicts of Aśoka,the pious king of Pāṭaliputra in Magadha, the modern Behar, whoflourished in the middle of the third century before Christ. Theseedicts contain the king&rsquo;s religious and moral injunctions to his subjects, and set forth his own ideas. belief, and conduct in thesematters Five different versions of them have been discovered,inscribed on rocks in different parts of the country. There is oneat Girnar, near Jungad in Kathiawar, another at Dhauli in</p>
<p>Kattak, and a third at Kapurdigiri or Śahbazgarhi in Afghanistan.These have been published and examined. The Girnar versionhas been copied several times, but the other two only once, andhence there are a good many imperfections in our existing copiesof them. Another version has recently been discovered atJaugad near Ganjam, in the Northern Circars, and copied by aMadras Civilian. It is unfortunately greatly mutilated, notmore than two of the fourteen edicts being found complete,and but a few words left of some. The fifth has recently beendiscovered by General Cunningham at Khalsi, near Masuri inthe Himalayas, and has not yet been published</p>
<p>^(*)</p>
<p>. Other edictsof the same king are found inscribed on columns which oxist atDelhi, Allahabad, and other places. At Dhauli and Ganjam thereexist, along with the edicts mentioned above, others whichanswer to these. Another Inscription of Aśoka has been found atBabhra in Rajputana, which consists of a letter to the Buddhistcongregation.</p>
<p>These Inscriptions are in three different dialects, closelyrelated to each other. The Girnar dialect is very much like thePali. That of the Dhauli, Ganjam, and Khalsi versions presentspeculiarities which are found in a later Prakrit called Māgadhiby the grammarians. Such are the substitution of <strong>ल्</strong> for <strong>र्, ए</strong> forthe <strong>ओ</strong> of the nominative singular of masculine nouns in <strong>अ, मिं</strong>the termination of the locative instead of the Pali <strong>म्हि</strong>, and <strong>हकस्</strong>for <strong>अहम्</strong>. The Babhra and the column inscriptions are also inthis dialect.The Śahbazgarhi recensionadmits of some conjuncts such as <strong>प्र</strong>, and the sibilants <strong>श्</strong> and <strong>ष्</strong> which in the othersand in Pali are changed to <strong>स्</strong>. But it is a question whether theseare dialectic peculiarities, or are to be attributed to a confusionof the vernacular with Sanskrit. I will now place before youshort specimens of these dialects.</p>
<p><strong>Girnar, edict VIII.</strong></p>
<p><strong>अतिकातंअंतरं राजानो विहारयातां त्रेयासु ।एत मगव्या अत्रानि च एतारिसानिअभिरमकानि अहुंसु। सो देवानंपियोपियदसी राजा दसवसाभिसितो संतो अयायसंबोधिं ।तेनेसा धंमयाता एतयं होति ब्राम्हणसमणानं दसणे च दाने च थैराणं दसणं</strong></p>

<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Published since in Corp. Inso, A sixth version existing nt Mansherainthe Panjab was discovered after the above was published. I have made usoof the latest readings of the versions.</p>
<p><strong>Sanskrit:—</strong></p>
<p><strong>अतिक्रान्तमन्तरं राजानो विहारयात्रां निरयासिषुः । अत्र मृगयान्यानि चैतादृशान्यभिरामकाण्यभूवन । स देवानांप्रियः प्रियदर्शी राजा दशवर्षाभिषिक्तः सन्नयासीत्संबोधिम् ।तेनैषा धर्मयात्रा । अत्रेदं भवति ब्राह्मणश्रमणानां दर्शनं च दानं च स्थविराणां दर्शनं चहिरण्यप्रतिविधानं च जानपदस्य च जनस्प दर्शनं धर्मानुशास्तिश्चधर्मपरिपृच्छा च ।तदोपर्यादेषा भूयोरतिर्भवति देवानां प्रियस्यप्रियदर्शिनो राज्ञो भागेन्यस्मिन् ।</strong></p>
<p>Translation:—</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some time ago kings went on pleasure excursions. Huntingand such others were the diversions here. But Priyadarśin, thefavourite of the gods, began the search of enlightenment when hehad been a crowned monarch for ten years. Hence this excursion(course) of righteousness. It consists of this, <em>viz.</em> seeing Brāhmaṇas and Śramaṇas, and bestowing gifts, seeing the religiouselders and presenting gold, and seeing country-people and givinginstruction in righteousness and in the investigation of the law.Since that time king Priyadarśin has been taking great delightin the glories of the next world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is not usual in these inscriptions to mark the double orassimilated consonants. Hence we do not find them here exceptin the case of double nasals which are indicated by an anusvārafollowed by the nasal. There is, as in Pali, no other phoneticchange; <strong>प्रति</strong> we see becomes <strong>पटि</strong> and <strong>भू</strong> becomes optionally <strong>द्रू</strong>; andराजानो the nominative plural, <strong>राञो</strong> for <strong>राञ्ञो</strong> the genitive singular,<strong>सन्तो</strong> the nominative singular, and all other cases are just likethose in that dialect. We have the Aorist forms ending in ananusvära followed by <strong>सु</strong>, as in Pali. But there are some differences; <strong>एतारिस</strong> is <strong>एतादिस</strong> in Pali as it is in the other recensionsof this same inscription, <strong>अहुंसु</strong> is <strong>अहेंसु</strong>, though <strong>अहुंसु</strong>agrees withthe rules of Pali grammar and must have existed in the language;the <strong>ऐ</strong> of<strong>थैराणं</strong> is opposed to Pali usage, but the engraver mayhave committed a mistake; <strong>त्रेयासु</strong> is for <strong>निय्यासु</strong>, <strong>इ</strong> being changedto <strong>ए</strong>before the conjunct according to the rule we have noticed.<strong>बाम्हण</strong> is <strong>ब्राह्मण</strong> in Pall; but the inscription perhaps represents theprevailing usage more correctly; and the is lengthened in <strong>राञो</strong>probably through mistake. There are thus very few cases of realdifference, and though they might be considered to point to a</p>
<p>dialectical variety of the nature of those we find in the differentversions of the edicts, still the language is in the same stage ofgrowth as the Pali.</p>
<p>The following is the Dhauli version collated with that atKhalsi and completed :—</p>
<p><strong>अतिकंतं अंतलं<sup id="fnref:122"><a href="#fn:122" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">122</a></sup>लाजानो विद्यालयातं नाम निखमिसु । हिदा मिगविया अंनानिचएदिसानि<sup id="fnref:123"><a href="#fn:123" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">123</a></sup> अभिलामानि हुंवंति<sup id="fnref:124"><a href="#fn:124" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">124</a></sup> नं ।स देवानं पिये पियदसी लाजा दसवसभिसते संते<sup id="fnref:125"><a href="#fn:125" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">125</a></sup>निखमि<sup id="fnref:126"><a href="#fn:126" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">126</a></sup>संबोधिं ।तेनता धंमपाता होता<sup id="fnref:127"><a href="#fn:127" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">127</a></sup> इयंहोति समनबा<sup id="fnref:128"><a href="#fn:128" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">128</a></sup>मनानं दसने च दाने च<sup id="fnref:129"><a href="#fn:129" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">129</a></sup>वुढानं दसने च हिलनपटिबिधाने च ।</strong></p>
<p>We here observe the varieties mentioned before, the changeof <strong>र्</strong> to <strong>ल्</strong> and the nominative in <strong>ए</strong>. We also see <strong>निखमिसु</strong>for<strong>त्रेयासु एदिसनि</strong>for <strong>एतारिसानि, बुधानं</strong> or <strong>बुढानं</strong> <strong>(=वृद्धानां)</strong> for <strong>थैरांन</strong> and <strong>बंभन</strong>or <strong>बाभन</strong> for <strong>ब्राह्मण</strong>. So then here we have another dialect.</p>
<p>Kapurdigiri or Śahbazgarhi version:—</p>
<p><strong>अतिक्रंतं अंतरं देवनंप्रिय विहरयत्र नम निकमिषु अत्र म्रुगय अञनि च हेदिशानिअमिरमनि अभवसु सो देवनंप्रिय प्रियद्रसि रज दशवषभिसितो सतो निक्रमि संबोधिंतेनदं ध्रमवत्र अत्रइयं होतिश्रमणब्रमणनं द्रशनेदनं &amp;c.</strong></p>
<p>Here we have the conjuncts <strong>प्रि, त्रा, ब्र,</strong>&amp;c, and the three Sanskritsibilants; and also <strong>होदिशनि</strong> for <strong>ईदृशानि</strong>.</p>
<p>The reason why we have not one same version at all the threeplaces must be that it was the intention of the king to publish theedicts in the dialect of each particular place. The Dhauli-Khalsidialect is as observed before, used in the column inscriptions, andalso in that found at Babhra. The king&rsquo;s predilection for it canbe plausibly accounted for only on the supposition that it was hisown native tongue. If so, this dialect must have prevailed inMagadha, which country was under his immediate rule, and thecapital of which was Pāṭaliputra, where he reigned. And thisaccounts for the fact that it is used in the inscriptions at Dhauliand Ganjam, since they are situated in the contiguous country.One peculiarity of this language, <em>viz.</em> the nominative singular ofnouns in stending in g is met with even in the Girnar recension,</p>
<p>which may be explained by the supposition that the edicts weredrawn up first in the king&rsquo;s dialect but were translated into thedialect of each province, the translation however being notexecuted carefully enough to expunge all peculiarities of theoriginal draft. It would thus appear that the grammarians of thelater languages had more solid grounds than mere fancy forcalling that Prakrit which bears close resemblance to this languageby the name of Māgadhi. Here then we find specimens of threedialects provalent in three widely distant provinces; but weshould bear in mind that the difference between them is small,while in the languages that are spoken in these countries at thepresent day it is so great as to make it difficult for the natives ofone province to understand those of another.</p>
<p>In the many other ancient monuments existing in the countrywe often find inscriptions which are principally in two languages,the Sanskrit and the Pali or Prakrit, understanding by this termsimply a dialect derived from the Sanskrit, Those in the latter(Pali) are mostly connected with Buddhism; though some Buddhistic inscriptions also, such as those discovered by GeneralCunningham at Mathura several years ago, are in Sanskrit.In the caves at Kanheri, Nasik, Junnar, Nanaghat, Karla,and some other places in this Presidency, and in the Bhilsatopes, we have Pali or Prakrit inscriptions. Most of these areshort, but at Nasik we have long ones, in the onves of Uṣavadāta,and Gotamīputra. The language of these latter is Pali; and buta few forms are peculiar, such as <strong>दत्त</strong> and <strong>कित</strong> for which the Pali has <strong>दिण्ण</strong> and <strong>कत</strong>, Past Passive Participles of <strong>दा</strong>and <strong>कृ</strong>; and <strong>वे</strong> forthe numeral two, the Pali form being <strong>द्वे</strong> or <strong>दुवे</strong>. In Uṣavadāta&rsquo;scaves we have one inscription entirely in Sanskrit, the rest arein Pali or Prakrit, but we have an intermixture of Sanskritwords, and the conjuncts <strong>प्र, त्र</strong>, and <strong>क्ष</strong> often appear. In these andsmaller inscriptions we have such words as <strong>वार</strong> for <strong>द्वार, वारसक</strong> for<strong>वार्षिक, वरिस</strong> for <strong>वर्ष,</strong> <strong>उदिस</strong>for <strong>उद्दिश्य</strong>, while the Pali forms of thesewords are <strong>द्वार वस्सिक, वस्स,</strong> and <strong>उद्देसेत्वा</strong>. Some of these inseriptionswere engraved so late as the third century, when the Pali couldhardly have been the vernacular; but it had become the sacred language of the Buddhists; the mendicant priests for whom thecaves were intended and even educated lay members of that persuasion understood it, and hence it was used in these inscriptions as Sanskrit was in others.</p>
<p>The style of Gotamīputra&rsquo;s charters, abounding as it does inlong compounds and elaborate expressions, is very unlike theplain and simple language of Aśoka&rsquo;s edicts. And at the end ofthese and that of his son, we are told that the officers of thesekings who caused the charters to be engraved acted under thecommand, <em>i. e.</em> wrote to the dictation of respected persons whowere the compilers of all such document.&rdquo; It thus appears thatthe Pali was at that time a sacred and a literary language amongthe Buddhists. And as to the language of the other inscriptions,which like those of Gotamīputra and his son were not composedby learned men, one can easily understand how ignorant persons,not knowing Sanskrit or Pali well, but still not ignorant enoughto know nothing of those languages, would confound together.Sanskrit, Pali, and vernacular words. Even in our days we findthe phenomenon in the <em>patrikās</em> or horoscopes written by ourJośis or astrologers, which are neither in pure Sanskrit nor inpure vernacular, but contain a mixture of them both, and theSanskrit words and forms in which are incorrectly written.</p>
<p>And an explanation of this nature I have also to give ofanother variety of language that is found in the writings of theNorthern or Nepalese Buddhists. These unlike those of theCeylonese and Burmese Buddhists are written in Sanskrit, but in such works as the Lalitavistāra or the life of Buddha we find,along with prose passages in pure Sanskrit, a number of verseswhich contain words or forms which are not Sanskrit. Thus, forinstance, we have:—</p>
<p>सर्वशुंभकर्महेतोःफलमिदं शृणुतास्यकर्मस्प<br>
पूजारहो भवितुं सर्वजगे अनुबन्धत इममनन्तयशं॥</p>
<p>You will here see that <strong>कर्मस्य, जगे</strong>,and <strong>यशं</strong>are as in the Pali treated like nouns in <strong>अ,</strong> <strong>अर्ह</strong>is dissolved into <strong>अरह</strong>, and there are afew other instances of this process, such as <strong>किलेश</strong>for <strong>क्लेश, शिरि,</strong> for<strong>श्री, हिरि</strong>for <strong>ष्ट्री</strong>&amp;c. but that generally the conjunct consonants areretained as they are in Sanskrit, and not assimilated. So alsoyou have <strong>चोदेन्ति</strong> for <strong>चोदयन्ति मायाय</strong> genitive singular of <strong>माया,उपजनित्या शुणिष्यति, निरीक्षथ</strong>;Imperative second person plural, <strong>शमेथ</strong>for <strong>शमयत</strong>, &amp;c., and even such words as <strong>मनाप</strong> which are Pali in</p>
<p>every respect. But along with these there are other peculiaritioswhich must be attributed simply to carelessness. For instance,the case terminations are often omitted, a thing never done eitherin Sanskrit or Pali, as <strong>काम सेविति</strong> for <strong>कामंसेवते, सुगत</strong> for <strong>सुगतं</strong> whengoverned by <strong>पूजयितुं मोक्ष भोष्यति</strong> for <strong>मोक्षो भविष्यति</strong>, &amp;c. Such constructions as <strong>क्षान्त्या सोरभ्यसम्पन्नाः</strong> for <strong>क्षान्तिसोरभ्यसंपन्नाःशीलसमाधि तथाप्रज्ञमयं</strong> for <strong>शीलसमाधिमज्ञामयं,</strong> are often to be met with.</p>
<p>This language has therefore no fixed characteristics at all. Wehave seen that in such words as <strong>कर्म, जग</strong> and <strong>यश</strong> above, the finalconsonant is dropped, and these as in Pali and Prakrit madenouns in अ. But <strong>यशस्</strong>is used in the Sanskrit form also, as <strong>कीर्तिर्यशश्च</strong>;and there are instances in which other final consonants arepreserved. Along with such a form as <strong>शुणिष्यति</strong> noted above,which is constructed on the same principle as the Pali <strong>मुणिस्सति</strong>,such a Sanskrit one as <strong>शृण्वन्ति</strong> is found. It therefore appears tome that this is not an independent language; but that the writersof the Gāthās knew the spoken language or Pali, and that theywere imperfectly acquainted with Sanskrit, knowing enough ofit to see that the assimilation of consonants was a vulgarity, butnot acquainted with its grammar. They intended to write in themore polished or literary language, but not knowing it well, oftenused unconsciously the grammatical forms and the peculiarwords of the vernacular. At the time when the Gāthās werewritten the claims of the Pali to be considered a separate languagewore probably not recognised, and it constituted the speech of theuninstructed. Those who in this condition of things wished towrite, could not think of doing so in that form of speech, andtherefore wrote in what they considered the language of educatedmen but they know it imperfectly, and produced such a heterogeneous compound as we have seen.</p>
<p><strong>LECTURE III.</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE PRAKRITS AND THE APABHRAṀŚA.</strong></p>
<p>On the last occasion we examined the language of the sacredbooks of the Southern Buddhists and found that a large portionof the words it contains are pure Sanskrit and the rest areSanskrit words corrupted or transformed according to certain lawsof phonetic decay. Then by the law of false analogy the lessused and less known declensional and conjugational forms havebeen in many cases brought over to the type of those more usedin Sanskrit and consequently better known. So that in the vocabulary and the grammar, the laws of growth I traced in the opening lecture are in operation, but their range is limited, and thedialect is in what may be called the first stage of departure fromSanskrit. We then examined the language of the Inscriptions ofAśoka and found that it is either the same as Pali or in the same stage of development, and that there existed in those times two orthree varieties of speech slightly differing from each other. Today I propose to examine certain other dialects which echibit amuch greater departure from the parent tongue. These are theso-called Prakrits. For a knowledge of these languages we havenot to go beyond India, as in the case of the one we have examined. Prakrit dialects possessed a literature and a portion of it hascome down to us.</p>
<p><strong>THE PRAKRITS.</strong></p>
<p>There exist about six treatises on Prakrit grammar, the mostancient of which is Vararuci&rsquo;s Prākṛtaprakāśa. Next comesHemacandra, a Jaina scholar of Gujarat, who lived in the twelfthcentury. His work on grammar is known by the name of<em>Haimavyākaraṇa</em>, the eight chapter of which he devotes to thegrammar of the Prakrits. Hemacandra&rsquo;s treatment of thesedialects is fuller than Vararuci&rsquo;s; and his observation was wider. He shows a very intimate knowledge of the existing literature ofthese languages, both sacred and profane, Jaina or Brahmanical.His work, and especially the last portion, is full of quotations. Hemust have availed himself of the labours of former scholars, since</p>
<p>he often mentions <em>Pūrvācāryas</em>. Hemacandra also wrote a <em>Koṣa</em>or thesaurus of the Deśīwords existing in these languages. Vararuci gives the grammar of four dialects, which he calls.Mahārāṣṭrī, Śauraseni, Māgadhi, and Paiśāicī. The names of thefirst three themselves would show that they were the languagesspoken or used in the provinces from the names of which theyare derived, but doubts have been raised as to their genuineness,which will be hereafter considered. The Mahārāṣṭrī is called theprincipal Prakrit. For instance, Daṇḍin in his Kāvyādarśa says-</p>
<p>&ldquo;The language prevalent in Mahārāṣṭra they regard as thePrākṛta pre-eminent; it is the ocean of jewels in the shape ofgood literary works, and the Setubandha and others are writtenin it¹.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vararuci devotes the first nine chapters of his work to theMahārāṣṭrī, and then a chapter each to the rest. The peculiarities only of the latter dialects and their differences from theMahārāṣṭrī are given, and in other respects they are to be considered similar to the first. Hemacandra follows the samemethod; but he does not mention the name Mahārāṣṭrī and speaksof the dialect only as the Prakrit. These grammarians and allothers who have written on the subject treat of the grammar ofthe language etymologically. They take Sanskrit as the originallanguage or <em>prakṛti</em> and give rules about the various phoneticaland grammatical changes which have reduced Sanskrit to thePrakrit form. The Pali grammarian Kaccāyanatreats thedialect not as one derived from Sanskrit as these writers do, butas an independent language, though it is very probable he knewSanskrit, since he uses Sanskrit grammatical terms, and hisSūtras greatly resemble those in the Kātantra and even Päṇini.Vararuci and Hemacandra derive Śaurasenīalso from theSanskrit as they do the Mahārāṣṭrī or the principal Prakrit, butmake the Śaurasenīthe Prakrti or basis of the Magadhi and thePaiśāci. This appears to be the tradition; whence it would seemthat older and more developed language or the language of respectable people was the Saurasent, and the other two were thedialects of border countries used by persons in a lower scale ofsociety. They have some of the peculiarities of the Śaurasenī,and come nearer to it than to the Mahārāṣṭrī. Hemacandra givesthe grammar of two more dialects, the Cülikä Paiśäciand theApabhraṁśa, the latter of which was according to Daṇḍin, thelanguage of Ābhīras (cowherds) and others. Another grammarian of the name of Trivikramo gives in his Prākṛtasūtravṛttithe grammar of these six dialects. He lived after Hemacandra,since he mentions him in the introduction to his work,and his book resembles Hemacandra&rsquo;s a good deal. There isanother work by Candra called Ṣaḍbhāṣācandrikāwhich is ameagre production. Another still of the same nature, the authorof which is Lakṣmīdhara, mentions the same six dialects: so that the expression Ṣaḍbhāṣāseems to have become proverbial.</p>

<p>1. <strong>महाराष्ट्राश्रयां भाषां प्रकृष्टं प्राकृतं विदुः।<br>
सागरः सूक्तिरत्नानां सेतुबन्धादि यन्मयम्॥</strong></p>
<p>The Mahārāṣṭrīderived its importance from its literature.From the manner in which Daṇḍin speaks of that literature it appears to have been very extensive and valuable. He himselfmentions one work, the Setubandha, a poem attributed to Kālidāsabut written by one Pravarasens, whose &ldquo;fame,&rdquo; Bāṇa says in hisHarṣacarita,&rdquo; reached the other side of the ocean by means of theSetu.&rdquo; I find in a Ms. in the colophon at the end of each āśvāsaor canto, sometimes <strong>इअ सिरीपवरसेणविरहए दहमुहवहे</strong>(thus in the Daśamukhavadha composed by the prosperous Pravarasena), and sometimes, <strong>इअ परवसेनविरइए कालिदासकर दहमुवहेह</strong> (thus in the Daśamukhavadhu, the work of Kālidāsa, composed by Pravarasena). Somekings of Kaśmir bore the name of Pravarasena, but there is nothingto show that any one of them was the poet who wrote this work.There is a collection of seven hundred songs, chiefly of anamorous nature, by a poet of the name of Hale, which is calledthe Saptaśatī. We have an edition of this in Roman charactersby Prof. Weber. Another long poem entitled the Gauḍavadhakāvya by a poet named Vākpatirāja, who lived at the court ofYaśovarman, king of Kanoj, in the early part of the eighth century,was discovered by Dr. Būhler about three years ago. And severalother works may turn up, if diligent search is made for them.The Kävyaprakāśa contains about 75 Prakrit verses quoted toillustrate the rules laid down by the author, and Śā</p>
<p>rṅgadharaalso gives a good many in his Paddhati.</p>
<p>The religious books of the Jainas form another very extensive</p>
<p>branch of Prakrit literature. Prof. Weber thinks the language ofthese to be later than the Pali and earlier than the Prakrits, so asto occupy a middle position, and calls it Jaina-Māgadhī. ButHemacandra himself, who must have known his religious bookswell, and was, as I have observed, a great Prakrit scholar, treatsit as the principal Prakrit or</p>
<p>।</p>
<p>, and in his grammar ofthis he in several places gives forms of words peculiar to hissacred language, which after the example of his Brahmanicbrothers he calls Ārṣa Prākṛta¹. In giving his first rule aboutthe Māgadhī dialect, <em>viz.</em>, that the nom. sing. of Masc. nouns takesthe termination <strong>ए</strong>, he says:— &ldquo;As to what the fathers have saidabout the Ārṣa (works) being composed in the Ardha-Māgadhīdialect in such words as these: the ancient Sūtra is composed inthe Ardha-Māgadhī dialect&rsquo;, they have said so in consequence ofthe observance of this rule and not of those that follow². Thus ifone chooses to call the sacred language of the Jainas Ardha-Māgadhī on account of this Māgadhī peculiarity and a few otherarchaisms, one may do so; and I shall presently have to observethat the great many dialects which writers on poetics give, differedfrom each other in such insignificant particulars only. But it isclear that Hemacandra considers the distinction to be slight, andidentifies the dialect with the principal Prakrit; and both he andthe Jaina fathers refer it to the class of the Prakrits of thegrammarians³.</p>

<p>1. आर्षम् । ३ । ऋषीणामिदमार्षम् ।आर्षे प्राकृतं बहुलं भवति । तदपि यथास्थानं दर्शयिष्यामः । आर्षे हि सर्वे विधयो विकल्प्यन्ते । He hasalso said before, that therules he is going to give even with regard to the ordinary Prakrit shouldnot be considered universal.</p>
<p>2. यदपि पोराणमद्धमागहमासानिययंहवइ सुत्तमित्यादिनार्षस्यार्धमागधभाषानियतत्वमाम्नायि वृद्धैस्तदपि प्रायोस्यैव विधानाम्नवक्ष्यमाणलक्षणस्य ।</p>
<p>3**.** The only specific grounds one can find in Prof. Weber&rsquo;s book in support ofthe assertion that the Jaina dialect occupies a middle position are these :—1. That uninitial <strong>क्, ग, च्, ज्, त्, द्</strong>and other consonants are dropped in theMahārāṣṭrīleaving only the vowel, and preserved or softened in the Pali,while in the Jaina books <strong>य्</strong> is substituted for them; <em>i. e,</em> the differentstages of phonetic corruption in this case are, the consonants in theiroriginal or softened forms, then for them, and lastly their clision. 2. That<strong>न्</strong> is preserved in the Pali, and changed every where to <strong>ण्ण्</strong>in the ।;while in the Jaina dialect initial <strong>न्</strong> remains unchanged except in enclytics.3. That the loc, sing. of nouns in <strong>अ</strong>ends in <strong>सिं</strong>or <strong>सि</strong>which we find in the</p>
<p>But it is in the dramatic plays that we find these dialectsprincipally used. Writers on Poetics prescribe that a particulardramatic person should speak a particular dialect. Sanskrit isassigned to respectable men of education, and women in holyorders; Śaurasenī, to respectable ladies in their prose speeches,and the Mahārāṣṭrīor the principal Prakrit, in the songs or versesput into their mouths. Śaurasenīis also assigned to inferiorcharacters; and the Māgadhīand Paiśācīto very low persons.The general rule is that a dramatic person should speak thelanguage of the country to which he or she is supposed to belong.Later writers give more minute rules. For instance, the authorof the Sāhityadarpaṇa assigns Māgadhī to the attendants in theroyal seraglio, Ardhamāgadhīto footmen, royal children, and</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>language of the column inscriptions; while it is <strong>स्मि</strong> and <strong>म्हि</strong>in the Pali and<strong>म्मि</strong> in the Prakrit.</p>
<p>Now as to the first, the <strong>य्</strong> is not prior to the elision, but contemporaneousor subsequent to it, being found even in the modern vernaculars. It wasintroduced simply to facilitate pronunciation; <em>i. e,</em> it is a strengthenedform of the vowel. Thus the Prakrit of <strong>पाद</strong> foot is <strong>पाअ</strong>, but in Marathi wehave <strong>पाय</strong>; so<strong>राजन्</strong> Skr.,<strong>राअ</strong>Pr.,<strong>राय</strong> II.; <strong>सोदर</strong> Skr., <strong>सोअर</strong> Pr.,<strong>सोयरा</strong>M., &amp;c. &amp;c. The <strong>य्</strong> occurs not only in Jainn books, but everywhere, *e. g.*in the Gauḍavadhakāvya (see below); and Hemacandra does tell us in hisSūtra <strong>अवर्णो यश्रुतिः</strong>that the <strong>अ</strong>that remains after the elision of a consonant is pronounced like a soft <strong>य</strong>. With regard to the second, initial <strong>न्</strong>isfound unchanged in the Gauḍavadha in a great many places. Thus instanza 242 we have the negative particle <strong>न</strong>, in 241 <strong>निवडइ</strong> for <strong>निपतति</strong>, in245 <strong>नाह</strong> for <strong>नाथ</strong>, and in 251 <strong>नह</strong> for <strong>नख</strong>. These instances I have found onsimply opening the Ms. at random and no grent search was necessary.Hemscandra also in his Sūtra <strong>वादौ</strong>following another, <strong>नो णः</strong>,says thatthe initial <strong>न्</strong> is sometimes changed to <strong>ण्</strong>, sometimes not. As to the third,the termination <strong>सिं</strong>may constitute a peculiarity of the language, butit is by no means au index to its higher antiquity, since it occurs in thepronominal locative of the principal Prakrit. There are several peculiaritios in the Jainn books, and a good many of them are noticed by ourGrammarian, but they do not show an earlier stage of development.</p>
<p>This continues still to be my view, notwithstanding all that has sincebeen published on the subject. Dr. Hoernle, in the introduction to hisedition of Caṇḍa&rsquo;s Prākṛtalakṣaṇamakes an elaborate attempt to provethat the dialect, the grammar of which is given in that book, is more ancient than the Prakrit of Vararnci and Homacandra. But it is not at alldifficult to see that he is altogether on a wrong track. He says there is</p>
<p>merchants, Prācyāto the Vidūṣaka and others, Āvantikītosharpers, warriors, and clever men of the world, Dākṣiṇātyātogamblers, Śākāri to Śakāras. Śakas, and others, Bāhlikāto celestialpersons, Drāviḍīto Draviḍas and others, Ābhirīto cowherds,Cāṇḍalīkīto outcastes, Ābhirīand Śābarī, also to those who livehy selling wood and leaves, and Paiśācīto dealers in charcoal.Hand-maids, if they do not belong to a very low class, shouldspeak Śaurasenrī. Some of the modern grammarians also mentionas large a number of dialects. But whether these were actuallyused by writers of dramatic plays in accordance with the rules ofRhetoricians, or, if they were, what constituted the exact difference between these various languages, it is impossible to determine so long as we have not got satisfactory editions of the plays.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>nothing in Hemacandra corresponding to the rule given by Caṇḍa aboutdropping the final vowel of the first member of a compound when theinitial vowel of the second is followed by a consonant, in such words as<em>dhana</em>+ā<em>ḍhya, deva + indra</em>,. &amp;c.,which in that Prakrit have the forms<em>dhanaḍḍha, devinda,</em> &amp;c. This change, however, does come undor Hemacandra&rsquo;s rule I. 84, which provides for the shortening of a long vowelwhen followed by a conjunct consonant. The short vowels corresponding to<strong>ए</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong> are <strong>इ</strong>and <strong>उ</strong>; grand among the instances given by Hemacandra, wehave <em>narindo</em> for <em>narendra</em>, <em>aburuṭṭha</em> for <em>adharoṣṭha</em>, <em>nïluppala</em> for <em>nïlotpala</em> &amp;c. Dr. Hoernle thinks the changes of <em>i</em> to short <em>e</em> and of <em>u</em> to short <em>o</em>are later Prakrit changes. But he will find many instances of them in thePaliwhich certainly is an older dialect than any JainaPrakrit. Theyare, he says, unknown to Caṇḍa. Caṇḍa&rsquo;s work is a very meagre production,in which very little endeavour is made to classify faces; and thus bemust be supposed to include these changes under his very general rule that<em>one vowel takes the place of another vowel</em>(II. 4). The instance <em>giṇhati</em>incidentally given by him in connection with another rule does not showthat in his Prakrit the form <em>geṇha</em> did not exist. much less that the changeof <em>i</em> to <em>e</em> was unknown. Then with regard to consonants. Dr. Hoernle saysthat there are five points in which the &ldquo;older Prakrit&rdquo; of Caṇḍa, as he callsit. differs from the Prakrit of Vararuci and Hemacoudra. One of these is&quot;the preservation of the dental <em>n</em> in overy ease.&rdquo; For this statement theDoctor quotes the authority of a Sūtra in which we are told by Caṇḍa that<strong>ङ्</strong> and <strong>ञ्</strong> do not exist in the Prakrit, ns compared with another version ofthat Sūtra which says that <strong>ङ्, न्</strong>,and <strong>ञ्</strong> do not exist (II, 14). This lastversion no doubt provides for the change of <strong>न्</strong> in all cases; but the otherwhich denies the non-existence or affirms the existence of <strong>न्</strong> cannot meanthat it exists or la unchanged in <em>all cases</em>. The denial of non-existence or</p>
<p>Still in those cases in which we have the assistance of the olderPrakrit grammarians, the characteristics of each can be madeout with fulness and certainty. To illustrate his rules about theMāgadhī, Hemacandra quotes from the speeches of the fishermanand the two policemen in Śakuntalä, of the Kṣapaṇaka from theMudrārākṣasa, and Rudhirapriyāfrom the Veṇīsaṁhāra.</p>
<p>The points in which the Māgadhī chiefly differs from theprincipal Prakrit and Śaurasenīare these:—<strong>र्</strong> and <strong>स्</strong> of these arechanged to <strong>ल्</strong> and <strong>श्;स्थ</strong>and <strong>र्थ</strong>of Sanskrit to <strong>स्त</strong>, and <strong>ष्ट</strong> to <strong>स्ट</strong>;and<strong>स्</strong> is not assimilated as in <strong>पस्खलदि</strong>from <strong>प्रस्खलति</strong>, the nom. sing. ofmase. nouns ends in <strong>ए</strong> instead of <strong>ओ</strong>, which is the Prakrit ending;the gen. sing. of masc, and neut. nouns optionally in <strong>आह</strong>as <strong>कम्माहः</strong>;and the form of the nom. sing. of the first personal pronoun is <strong>हगे</strong>.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>affirmation of existence only proves its existence or remaining unchangedin <em>some</em> cases. Besides we have a specific rule where we are told that alatter of the <strong>द्</strong> class takes the place of the corresponding letter of the <strong>त्</strong>class ( III. 16), thus providing for the change of <strong>न्</strong> to <strong>ण्</strong>; and the instancegiven is <strong>धण्णं</strong>for <strong>धान्यम्.</strong> But this rule, the Doctor thinks, holds good incases, for which however there is no authority whatever, and he givesnone. Again, he says that his statement is proved by the uniform spollingof the Prakrit examples with w in MSS A and B, which, necording to himcontain the older version of the work. I, however, find that the spellingin his edition, which is the spelling of A and B, follows uniformly, with oneor two exceptions, in which we must suppose a mistake, the rule laid downby Hemacandra, *viz.,*that initial <em>n</em> is optionally changed to <em>ṇ</em>, whilemedial <em>n</em> is necessarily so changed. The instances are:— all the caseterminations which are to be traced to the Sanskrit terminations having <em>n</em>in them, such as <strong>णो, णि,</strong> and <strong>णं; मुणिणो</strong> for <strong>मुनीम्</strong>(I.1), <strong>गयणओ</strong> for<strong>गगनतः</strong> (I. 16), <strong>मणिस्सा</strong> A. II. 21), <strong>नाणी</strong> (1.24) for <strong>ज्ञानी, सक्कीसाणा</strong> for<strong>शक्रेशानी</strong> ( II 1), <strong>काणं</strong> ( IH. 15), <strong>गयणं</strong> for <strong>गगनम्</strong> (II. 21), <strong>पलिणं</strong> for <strong>पीडनम्</strong>( II. 24), <strong>नाणं</strong> for <strong>ज्ञानम्</strong> ( III. 6), <strong>जुव्वणं</strong>for <strong>यौवनम्</strong>( III. 15) and <strong>रअणं</strong>for <strong>रत्नं</strong> (III. 30). The second point is &ldquo;the preservation of themedial single surd unaspirate consonants with the only exception of <em>k.</em>&ldquo;This simply means the preservation of <em>c, t,</em> and <em>p</em> which according to theother grammarians are <em>generally</em> dropped. Caṇḍa agrees with those indropping not only <em>k</em>, but <em>g, j,</em> and d. Whether therefore the preservationof <em>c,t,</em> and <em>p,</em> supposing that Caṇḍa really allows it, marks off hisPrakrit as older than that of Hemacandra or Vararuci is more thanquestionable. But, as a matter of fact in III. 12, he does provide for theirchange to <em>j. d.</em> and *b;*and the change of <em>t</em> to <em>d</em> is n Śaurasenī, *i. e,*a local change, and does not indicate priority of time. Besides, even</p>
<p>If we apply the test furnished by these rules to the severadialects used by the characters in the Mṛcchakaṭika as it is inexisting editions, which play contains a large variety ofcharacters, and consequently of speech, we shall find that thelanguage of the Cāṇḍalas, the Śakāra, his servant Sthāvaraka,and even Kumbhīraka and Vardhamānaka, is Māgadhī, thoughthe rules about <strong>स्थ, र्थ,</strong> and <strong>ष्ट</strong> are scarcely observed. There ishardly any dialectic difference in their speeches.But theSāhityadarpaṇa would lead us to expect his Cāṇḍālika and Śākārīrespectively in the first two cases, and Ardhamagadhi in the lastthree. As before observed, some admixture of Māgadhīcharacteristics constitutes this last dialect. Under this view there areinstances of the use of the Ardhamāgadh, as Lassen remarks, in</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>the dropping of these consonants must have been contemplated by him.For in the instances given in the book, they are dropped in all the manuscripts used by Dr. Hoerale, even in A and B, which according to him contain the older version. Thus we have <strong>एइ</strong>for <strong>एति</strong>(I. 12), गयणओ-उor <strong>गयणाओ-उ</strong> for <strong>गगनतः</strong> (I, 16), <strong>कयं</strong>For <strong>कृतम्</strong> (I. 23 and everywhere else),<strong>इहागओ-उ</strong> for <strong>इहागतः</strong> ( II. I.). <strong>इच्छिअं</strong> for <strong>इच्छितम्</strong> (II. 3). कायव्वं-व्वं for<strong>कर्तव्यम्;सुइणं</strong>for <strong>सूचीनाम्</strong> (II. 4), <strong>नेउरं</strong> for <strong>नूपुरम्</strong> (II. 4). <strong>घयं</strong> for घृतम,काउण for <strong>कृत्वा, दीसइ</strong> for <strong>दृश्यते</strong> ( II. 5) <strong>गच्छ</strong>इfor <strong>गच्छति बइ</strong> for <strong>पतिः</strong>( II. 10 ). <strong>सरिआणं सरियाणं सरिताम्</strong> ( II. 11), <strong>गइ-ई</strong> for <strong>गतिः, मइ-ई</strong> for<strong>मतिः</strong> (II.17), &amp;c. &amp;c. It is very much to be regretted that the Doctor shouldin all these cases have set aside the readings of his manuscripts and invented his own with the <strong>त्, च्</strong> and <strong>प्</strong>standing in the words, instead of being dropped. This invention or restoration, as he calls, it, is based on asingular inference that he deduces from a single word, <strong>कृतं</strong> given as aPrakrit word in the book. He says it must originally have been <strong>कतं</strong>, but thecopyist, not knowing of such a word being in the later Prakrit which heknew, took it as the Sanskrit <strong>कृतं</strong>, and wrote accordingly. If, therefore,<strong>कतं</strong> was the Prakrit word in this case, it must have been so in all thosecases in which <strong>कयं</strong> occurs in the book, and so Dr. Hoernle makes it <strong>कतं</strong>throughout. But it did not strike him that if the copyist knew Prakritenough to see that <strong>कतं</strong> was not a Prakrit word, he must have seen that<strong>कृतं</strong> also was not a Prakrit word and could not have given it as such. Nowthe reason why these consonants were not admitted by Caṇḍa, accordingto the manuscripts A and B, among those that are dropped, but onlyamong those that are softened must be that all these rules are only generaland not universal, and there were as many instances of softoning as ofdropping. Besides, I have already said that Caṇḍa&rsquo;s work is perfunctory,</p>
<p>the Prabodhacandrodayn, The dialect used byMāthura, thekeeperof the gambling-house in the Mṛcchakaṭika, is somewhatdifferent. In his speeches, we sometimes find <strong>ल्</strong> and <strong>श्</strong>used for<strong>र्</strong>, and <strong>म्</strong>,sometimes not. The nom. sing. endsin <strong>ओ</strong>, asinthe Mahārāṣṭrīor ŚaurasenMahārāṣṭrī, in some cases, in others it ends in <strong>ए</strong>as in the Māgadhī, and sometimes <strong>उ</strong> as in the Apeabhraṁśa;and the gen. sing. sometimes ends in आहas in the Māgadhī.Ifthe text is to be depended on, the Dākṣiṇātyāwhich Viśvanātha^(1)attributes to gamblers may be such a mixed languae.</p>
<p>Itwould thus appear that if all these inferior dislects did existand were used hy dramatic writers, they differed from each otherin unimportant particulars, and that most of them belonged tothe Māgadhī species, since the MSS. have confounded tham withthe Māgadhī of the grammarians. Hente we are justified intaking the real number of Prakrit dialects used for literary purposes to be six, <em>viz.,</em> those mentioned by Hemacandra, Trivikrama,and Lakṣmīdhara.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>and does not show accuracy of observation and statement. The thirdpoint is the preservation of the medial single surd aspirate consonnntswith the only exception of <em>kh; i. e.,<em><strong>ठ्, थ्, फ्</strong> are preserved. But 111. 11provides for the change of these to <strong>ह्, ध्र्</strong>, and <strong>भ्</strong>. if welook to th senseofthe Sūtraand also to some af the instances that ure given, The change of</em><em>थ्</em></em> to<strong>ध्</strong> is aŚaurasenīpeculiarity. Of the two remaining polats one is theinsertion of य् toavoid the hintus caused by the dropping of a consonant,about which Ihave already spoken, iid the other is unimporkant.</p>
<p>There is therefore, ne question that the Prakrit, ameagre grammar ofwhich is given in the work edited by Dr. Hoernle, ia not older than Hemecandra&rsquo;s.—(1887).</p>
<p>1. Another gambler without a name is introduced in the game scene,whose linguage Prof. Lassen thinks is Dākṣiṇātyāand Māthura’s, Āvantikī. Very few speathes however, ire given tothe former, aod it fs notpossible to come to any ilotinite conclusion from them; butso far as theygo, there is hardly any difference betwoen bis dialect und that of Māthura.The Professoris led to attributetwo languages to gamblers by the annotater on the Śāhityadarpaṇawhom be quotes, and who explains <strong>धूर्त</strong>by<strong>अक्षदेविन्</strong>.

<p>Daṇḍin mentions a work of the name of Bṛhatkathāwritten inthe language of the ghosts, <em>i.e.</em>. in the Paiśācī. Dr. Bühler hasrecently obtained a trace of the work, and arrangements have beenmade for getting it copied¹. It is traditionally ascribed to a poet ofthe name of Gunāḍhya.</p>
<p>Let us now examine cursorily the principal Prakrit and the Śaurasenīwhich ranks next to it in literary importance, but, which, as the model of the inferior dialects and as the language used by the higher class. of Prakrit-speaking dramatic persons in their prose speeches, is more important than the other. Here, as before, I will place a specimen of each before you:—</p>

<p>In the MS. of the Gauḍavadha, from which the firstextract is given <strong>अ</strong>, and <strong>आ</strong> preceded by <strong>अ</strong> and <strong>इ</strong>, aremarked as <strong>य</strong> and <strong>या</strong>. In MSS. of other works, the doesnot appear; but there can be no question that it representsthe later pronunciation correctly, since as already remarkedin a note, this is observed in some of the modern vernnaoulars. But it is to be pronounced like a strengthened <strong>अ</strong> or <strong>आ</strong></p>
<p>and not like the heavy semi-vowel that I mentioned in my observations on the Pāli.</p>
<p><strong>(I) PHONETIC CHANGES COMMON TO PALI AND PRAKRITS</strong></p>
<p>From these extracts you will observe that phonetic decay hasmade greater progress in these dialects than in the one we haveexamined. The changes in the Pali are, with a few exceptions,such as may be attributed to the circumstances and vocal peculiarities of a foreign race. But in the Prakrits the ususal processes of curruption have a wider range of operation; thoughteven here we shall, as we proceed, find it necessary to ascribe agood deal to an ethnological cause.</p>
<p>And first as regards the phonetic transformations which wehave noticed in the Pali, I have to observe that Prakrits alsoexhibit the same with but slight differences. The vowel <strong>ऋ</strong> ischanged to <strong>अ</strong>as in <strong>घअ</strong>, <strong>तण, मअ</strong>, &amp;c. for <strong>घृत, तृण, मृग,</strong> &amp;c.; to <strong>इ</strong> as in <strong>किवा, हिअअ, किस</strong>, &amp;c. for <strong>कृपा, हृदय, कृश</strong>, &amp;c.; to<strong>उ</strong> as in <strong>पुहई, पाउस, बुट्ठ,</strong>&amp;c., for <strong>पृथिवी, प्रावृष्, वृद्ध,</strong> &amp;c. When standing alone, it is more oftenchanged to <strong>रि</strong> than in Pali; as in <strong>रिद्धी</strong> and <strong>रिच्छ</strong> for <strong>ऋद्धि</strong>and <strong>ऋक्ष;रिण</strong> or <strong>अण, रिजू</strong> or <strong>उजू</strong>, &amp;c., for <strong>ऋण, ऋजु</strong>, &amp;c., while the Pali formsof these words are <strong>इद्धि, अच्छ, अण</strong> and <strong>उजु</strong>.</p>
<p>The diphthongs and at are, as in Pali, changed to <strong>ए</strong>and <strong>ओ</strong>,as in <strong>केलास, वेज्ज, केडव</strong>, &amp;c. for <strong>कैलास, वैद्य, कैटभ</strong>, &amp;c.; and in <strong>जोव्वण,कोमुई कोत्थुह</strong> &amp;c. for <strong>यौवन, कौमुदी, कौस्तुभ</strong> &amp;c.; but in a good manyinstances they are dissolved into their elements <strong>अइ</strong>and <strong>अउ</strong>, as in<strong>दइच्चभइरव, दइवअ, सइर,</strong> &amp;c., for <strong>दैत्य, भैरव, देवत, स्वैर</strong>, &amp;c.;and <strong>पउर, कउसल,सउह, मउली</strong>, &amp;c., for <strong>पौर, कौशल, सौध, मौलि</strong>, &amp;c. This change resembles the dissolution of conjunct consonants into the different members,and like it, is due to a weak or languid way of pronunciation. In<strong>ऐ</strong> and <strong>औ</strong> at the first element or <strong>अ</strong> is rapidly pronounced, and thetemporal value assigned to it by the authors of the Prātiśākhyasis, you will remember, half a matra, while in the Prakrti transformations it is one mātrā.</p>
<p>The long vowels are, as in Pali, shortened when followed bydouble consonants; and there is the same or even stronger evidence of the existence of short <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong>. In Pali short <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong>followed by a conjunct are in certain cases changed to ए and ओ,and from that fact we inferred that they were short. Here in a</p>
<p>great many more cases, when so followed, short <strong>इ</strong> is optionallyInterchangeable with <strong>ए</strong>, and short <strong>उ</strong> is necessarily replaced by <strong>ओ</strong>,as in <strong>पिण्ड</strong> or <strong>पेण्ड</strong>, <strong>पिट्ठ</strong>or <strong>पेट्ठ</strong>, <strong>निद्दा</strong>or <strong>नेद्दा,</strong>&amp;c.;and <strong>तोण्ड, मोण्ड, पोक्खर,</strong>&amp;c.; for <strong>पिण्ड, पिष्ट, निद्रा, तुण्ड, मुण्ड पुष्कर</strong>, &amp;c. In several cases <strong>ए</strong>,not followed by a conjunct, is optionally changed to <strong>इ</strong>, as in <strong>विअणा</strong>or <strong>देअणा</strong>for <strong>वेदना, दिअर</strong> or <strong>देअर</strong> for <strong>देवर</strong> &amp;c. The <strong>ए</strong> in these wordsmust for some reason that we will hereafter consider have beenpronounced short and hence interchangeable with <strong>इ</strong>. Sometimesthe consonant following on <strong>ए</strong> or <strong>ओ</strong> is doubled, as in <strong>तेल्ल, पेम्म, सोत्त,जोव्वन,</strong> &amp;c. for <strong>तैल, प्रेमन्, स्रोतस्, यौवन,</strong> &amp;c.;which could only bebecause those vowels were pronounced short, and the loss ofquantity thus occasioned was made up for by rendering the pronunciation heavy and forcible. In other coses the <strong>ए</strong>was so pronounced by some and not by others; and so we have <strong>एक्क</strong>or <strong>एअ</strong>for <strong>एक, सेव्वा</strong>or <strong>सेवा</strong> for <strong>सेवा</strong> &amp;c. The syllables <strong>अय</strong>and <strong>अव</strong>arechanged to <strong>ए</strong>and <strong>ओ</strong>oftener than in Pali, the <strong>अय</strong>of the causativeand the tenth class becoming <strong>ए</strong> necessarily throughout, as in<strong>कारेइ,हासेइ,कहेइ</strong>for <strong>कारयति, हासयति, कथयति</strong> &amp;c.</p>
<p>All the sibilants are reduced to <strong>स्</strong>as in the Pali, but in theMāgadhī dialect to <strong>ञ्;शालश, पुलिश</strong> for <strong>सारस, पुरुष</strong>, &amp;c. Thesedialects do not possess the cerebral <strong>ल्</strong>, and therefore we have <strong>ल्</strong>in the place of the Pali <strong>ल्</strong>, and in some cases the original Sanskrit<strong>ङ्</strong> as in <strong>तलाअ, गरुल, कीलइ</strong>for the Pali <strong>तलाग, गरुल, कीलाति</strong> andSanskrit त<strong>डाग, गरुड, क्रीडति,</strong> &amp;c., <strong>गुल</strong> or <strong>गुड, णाली</strong> or <strong>णाडी</strong>for thePali <strong>गुल,नाली</strong>, &amp;c.and <strong>पीडेइ, नीड</strong>for the Pali <strong>पालेति, नील</strong>&amp;c.</p>
<p>There are a good many more examples of the change of dentalsto cerebrals than in the Pali, both through the influence of aneighbouring <strong>र्</strong> or without it. The <strong>ट्</strong>and <strong>ठ्</strong> which correspond to<strong>त्</strong> and <strong>थ्</strong> are in most cases softened to <strong>ड्</strong> and <strong>ढ्</strong>. Thus we have <strong>पडि</strong>for the Pali <strong>पटि,</strong> as in <strong>पडिमा, पडिहार</strong>, for <strong>प्रतिमा, प्रतिहार</strong> &amp;c. and<strong>पट्ठडिपडण, वहेडअ</strong> for <strong>प्रभृति, पतन, बिभीतक; डोला</strong> or <strong>दोला, डम्भ</strong> or<strong>दम्भ,डम्भ</strong> or <strong>दम्भ</strong> for <strong>दोला, दम्भ, दर्भ</strong>, &amp;c.; <strong>पढम</strong> ( Pali <strong>पठम</strong>)<strong>, सिढिल, मैढी, ओसढ</strong>for <strong>प्रथम, शिथिल;मेथि, औषध</strong>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>In Pali the dental nasal is changed tour in but a few instances;but here it is so changed throughout, necessarily when uninitial,and optionally when at the beginning of a word; as <strong>कणअ, मअण,बअण</strong>, for <strong>कनक, मदन, वदन</strong> &amp;c.,and <strong>णर</strong> or <strong>नर, णई</strong> or <strong>नई, णेइ</strong> or <strong>नेइ</strong>, for</p>
<p><strong>नर, नदी, नयति,</strong> &amp;c. The opposite process is however observable inthe Paiśācī dialect, where not only have we no instances of thischange but even the original Sanskrit <strong>ण्</strong> is changed to <strong>न्</strong> as in<strong>गुन, गन,</strong> for <strong>गुण, गण</strong>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The conjunct consonants are transformed in the Prakrit in thesame way as in the Pali. In the former however, <strong>ज्ञ्</strong> and <strong>म्प्</strong> arechanged to <strong>ण्ण</strong>, and not to <strong>ञ्ञ्</strong> as in the latter, as in, <strong>णाण, सण्णा, अण्ण,सुण्ण</strong>, for <strong>ज्ञान, संज्ञा, अन्य, शून्य</strong>, &amp;c. To be thus corrupted, <strong>ज्ञ्</strong> mustin the original Sanskrit have been pronounced as if it werecomposed of <strong>ज्</strong> and <strong>न्;</strong> and sometimes the latter must have beenso weakly pronounced that the sound of ज् prevailed over it and thewhole became <strong>ज्ज्</strong>, as in <strong>जाण</strong> or णा<strong>ण, सव्वज</strong> or <strong>सव्वण्ण, मणोज</strong> or <strong>मणोण्ण</strong>,for <strong>ज्ञान, सर्वज्ञ, मनोज्ञ,</strong> &amp;c. In the Paiśācī and the Paiśācī, however,the Pali transformation is retained; as in<strong>मञ्ञा</strong>, for <strong>सक्ञ्ञ, कञ्ञका, अभिमञ्ञ</strong>, for <strong>ज्ञान, सर्वज्ञ, मनोज्ञ,</strong> &amp;c. In the Paiśācī and Paiśācī, however, the Pali transformation is retained; as in <strong>मञ्ञा, सक्ञ्ञ, कञ्ञका, अभिमञ्ञ</strong>, for <strong>संज्ञा, सर्वज्ञ, कन्यका, अभिमन्यु</strong>&amp;c.</p>
<p>The conjunct <strong>र्य्</strong> is sometimes changed to <strong>ज्ज्</strong> corresponding tothe <strong>य्य्</strong> of the older dialect, and ह्य to <strong>ज्झ्</strong>to in which case the heavy<em>n</em>ā<em>da</em> of <strong>ह्</strong>is transferred to the <strong>ज्</strong>which takes the place of <strong>य्</strong> as in change of <strong>ध्य्</strong> to <strong>ज्झ्</strong>.</p>
<p>In Pali the consonants of <strong>ह्य</strong> only interchange places; <em>i. e.</em> itbecomes <strong>यह्</strong>. From this and from the change of the initial uncombined <strong>य्</strong> to <strong>ज्</strong>, it appears that very often the Sanskrit <strong>य्</strong>, waspronounced heavily when the Prakrits arose. The Śaurasenīandthe dialects allied with it have, however, both the Pali and thePrakrit corruptions of <strong>र्य्.</strong></p>
<p>A dental forming a conjunct with a following <strong>ब्</strong>is in a fewcases changed to the corresponding palatal; as in <strong>भोच्चा</strong> for <strong>भुक्त्वा, चच्चर</strong>for <strong>चत्वर, पिच्छी</strong> for<strong>पृथ्वी, विज्जं</strong> for <strong>विद्वान, बुज्झा</strong> for <strong>बुद्ध्वा, झअ</strong> for<strong>ध्वज झुणी</strong> for <strong>ध्वनि, सज्झस</strong> for <strong>साध्वस</strong> &amp;c. This seems to srise fromthe fact that <strong>व्</strong> was pronounced so lightly that it lost its distinctive character, and the conjuncts came to be confused withthose containing a dental and <strong>य्</strong> which, you will remember, arechanged to a double palatal. In Pali the <strong>त्व्</strong> is retained in theseinstances, and the <strong>द्व्</strong> and <strong>ध्व्</strong> are changed to <strong>द्द्</strong> and <strong>द्ध्</strong> according tothe general rules, and the <strong>थ्व्</strong> of <strong>पृथ्वी</strong>becomes <strong>थव्</strong>. Besides theconjuncts disjoined in Pali by the interposition of a vowel, wehave <strong>र्ग्</strong> and <strong>र्ष्</strong> also so treated in the Prakrit, sometimes optionally</p>
<p>and sometimes necessarily. Thus <strong>आदर्श</strong>becomes <strong>आअरिस</strong> or <strong>आअंस</strong>,( P. <strong>आदास</strong> ): <strong>सुदर्शन, सुदरिसण</strong>or <strong>सुदंसण</strong>, ( P. <strong>सुदस्सन</strong>); <strong>वर्ष, वरिस</strong> or <strong>वास</strong>( P. <strong>क्स्स</strong>) : <strong>परामर्श, परामरिस</strong>, ( P. <strong>परामास</strong> ): <strong>अमर्श, अमरिस</strong>, ( P. <strong>अमस्स</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>(II) PHONETIC CHANGES IN THE PRAKRITS</strong></p>
<p>Having noticed the changes common to the Prakrits with thePali, we will proceed to consider others distinctive of the former.Most of these were due to the continuous operation of processeswhich come into play in a living language. The Pali exhibitsbut few instances of these processes. The changes observable init are mostly to be traced to one or two vocal peculiarities of themen who spoke it. At the time when the language received theform in which we now find it, the tradition of the originalSanskrit was still distinct; the Pali had not lived an independentlife detached from its mother for a long time. But with thePrakrits the case is different. They show a great many moreinstances of the usual processes, and consequently a much greaterdeparture from the parent tongue. We will begin by noticingwhat may be called the softening process.</p>
<p>The vowels <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong> are softened, as we have seen, to short <strong>ए</strong>and <strong>ओ</strong>before conjunots. These latter sounds are, as indicated inthe last lecture, more open than the former; that is, do not requirethe tongue to be raised so high as in the case of <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong>. Theyare therefore softer. But since the change principally takes placebefore doubles it may, I believe, be traced to their influence, as Ihave already observed. In that case this would be an instance ofassimilation. But the change of long <strong>ई</strong> and <strong>ऊ</strong> to long <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong> isdue to softening alone; as in <strong>पैऊस</strong> for <strong>पीयूष</strong> <strong>आपेल</strong> for <strong>आपीढ, बहेडअ</strong>for <strong>बिभीतक, केरिस</strong> for <strong>कीदृश</strong>, and <strong>एरिस</strong> for <strong>ईदृश, नेड</strong> for <strong>नीड, पेड</strong>for <strong>पीठ,तम्बोल</strong> for <strong>ताम्बूल, तोणीर</strong> for <strong>तूणीर, थोर</strong> for <strong>स्थूल</strong>, and <strong>गलोई</strong> for <strong>गुडूची</strong> Inthe same way, <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong> are in rare cases softened to <strong>अ</strong>, as in <strong>हलद्वा</strong> for<strong>हंरिद्रा पडंसुअ</strong> for <strong>प्रतिश्रुत्</strong> and <strong>जाहिट्ठिल</strong> for <strong>युधिष्ठिर. अ</strong> requires no movementof the tongue or lips, while <strong>इ</strong>and <strong>उ</strong> do. It is therefore softer thanthose two vowels. Both these changes contradict another principle to be hereafter noticed, the operation of which is wide, andthey must therefore be considered special or peculiar changes.The manner in which <strong>ऋ</strong> is softened has been already detailed.</p>
<p>The semivowel <strong>य्</strong> is often softened to <strong>इ</strong>, as in <strong>विअण</strong> for <strong>व्यजन,विलिअ</strong> for <strong>व्पलीक, थीण</strong> for <strong>स्त्यान, उव्वीढ</strong>for <strong>उव्वीढ</strong>for <strong>उद्ज्याव्यूढ; जीआ</strong> for <strong>ज्या</strong> &amp;c.</p>
<p>Here the effort necessary to bring the middle of the tongue closerto the palate is economized, while the position of the organs inother respects is the same. The <strong>य</strong>of the conjunct <strong>र्य</strong>is sometimessoftened in this way to <strong>इ</strong> and sometimes to <strong>इअ</strong>. In the formercase the resulting <strong>इ</strong> is transferred to the previous syllable andforms <strong>ए</strong> with the <strong>अ</strong> contained in it; as in <strong>पेरन्त</strong> for <strong>पर्यन्त, अच्छेर</strong> for<strong>आश्चर्य, बम्भचेर</strong> for <strong>ब्रह्मचर्य, सुन्देर</strong> for <strong>सौन्दर्यं,</strong> &amp;o. Similarly is changedto <strong>उ</strong> as in <strong>झुणी</strong> for <strong>ध्वनि, बीसुं</strong> for <strong>विष्वक्, गउओ</strong> for <strong>गवय, सुवइ</strong>for <strong>स्वपितिदु</strong> for <strong>द्वि</strong>. &amp;c.</p>
<p>The surds are softened into sonants. The pronunciation of theserequires, as you will remember, less exertion than that of theformer. For, sonants such as <strong>ग्, घ्, द्, ध्</strong>, &amp;c., are pronounced bymeans of <em>nāda</em>, or vocal sound which is produced when the glottisis in its natural condition and the chords vibrate, and the surds<strong>क्, ख्, त्, श्</strong>,&amp;c. are uttered by sending forth simple breath or<em>śvāsa</em>, to produce which it is necessary to stretch the glottis.This effort is saved by changing the surds to sonants. Thus <strong>क्</strong> ischanged to <strong>ग्</strong> as in <strong>मरगअ</strong> for <strong>मरकत</strong> and <strong>गेन्दुआ</strong> for <strong>कन्दुक</strong>; <strong>ट्</strong>to <strong>ड्</strong> as in <strong>नड, भड,</strong> and <strong>घड</strong>, for <strong>नट, भट</strong>, and <strong>घट</strong> and in <strong>पडि</strong> for <strong>प्रति</strong> and theother instances given above; <strong>ठ्</strong>to <strong>ढ्</strong>as in <strong>मढ, सढ, कमढ, कुढार</strong>, and<strong>पढ</strong>, for <strong>मठ, शठ, कमठ, कुठार</strong>, and <strong>पठ</strong>;and <strong>त</strong> and <strong>थ</strong> to <strong>द</strong> and <strong>ध</strong> as in <strong>पद</strong>for <strong>एत, नाध</strong>for <strong>नाथ</strong>&amp;c. (in Śaur.). The cerebral, and <strong>ठ्</strong>resultingfrom the original dentals <strong>त्</strong>and <strong>थ्</strong> are also similarly softened to<strong>ङ्</strong> and <strong>ङ्</strong>as in प<strong>डि</strong>for <strong>प्रति</strong> (प<strong>टि</strong>in Pali), <strong>पहुडि</strong> for प्र<strong>भृति, बहेडअ</strong> for<strong>बिभीतक, हरडई</strong> for <strong>हरीतकी, मडअ</strong> for मृ<strong>तक</strong> &amp;c. and <strong>सिढिल</strong> for <strong>शिथिल</strong>, <strong>पुढवी</strong> for <strong>पृथिवी, पढम</strong> for <strong>प्रथम</strong>, &amp;c. The sonant answering to <strong>प्</strong> is <strong>ब्</strong>but this is further softened to <strong>व्,</strong> as in , <strong>कूव, कवाल, कुणाव, तव</strong>इ, &amp;c.,for <strong>कूप, कपाल, कुणप, तप</strong>ति, &amp;c.</p>
<p>An original <strong>ङ्</strong> is softed to <strong>ल्</strong>, in which case there is a savingof two efforts. The complete contact necessary for the pronunciation of <strong>ङ्</strong> being avoided, we have <strong>ल्</strong>. This sound is similar to <strong>ल्</strong>inthe fact that the breath before the break of the contact or closeapproach is allowed to pass out by the sides of the tongue, but ismore difficult or harder because its position being higher upthe tongue has to be raised higher than in pronouncing<strong>ल्</strong>, the position of which is near the root of the upper teeth. Thisadditional exertion is saved by proceeding from <strong>ङ्</strong>, at once to <strong>ल्</strong>.We have thus <strong>गरुल, तंलाअ, कीलइ</strong>, <strong>दालिम, गुल, नाली, for गरुड, तडाग</strong>,</p>
<p><strong>क्रीडति, दाडिम, गुड, नाडी</strong> &amp;c.. In the Pali, however, you willremember and probably in some unwritten Prakrits also, thecerebral character of the letter was preserved, and we have <strong>ल्</strong>instead of <strong>ल्</strong>.</p>
<p>Sometimes <strong>ङ्</strong> is softened to <strong>र्</strong> only. The position of this islower than that of <strong>ड्</strong>, and the contact is incomplete. It is therefore softer than but harder than <strong>ड्</strong>. This last sound is producedlower still, but a light close approach is formed, and the breath isallowed to escape by the sides of the tongue; while in uttering <strong>र</strong>,the tongue is kept in its position with greater force, and the breathis allowed to vibrate. This change is principally to be met within the case of the <strong>ड्</strong> resulting from an original <strong>ढ्</strong> in such wordsas <strong>एआरह बारह तेरह</strong>, &amp;c, for <strong>एकादश द्वादश त्रयोदश</strong>, &amp;c., the <strong>द्</strong> ofwhich must first have become <strong>ड्</strong>. In <strong>कलम्ब, दोहल</strong>, and <strong>पलित्त</strong>, for<strong>कदम्ब, दोहद,</strong> and <strong>प्रदीप्त</strong>, we have instances of an original <strong>द्</strong> passing <strong>ल्</strong>.</p>
<p>An original <strong>र्</strong> is changed to <strong>ल</strong> which, as just observed, is softerthan <strong>र्,</strong> as in <strong>हलद्दी, दलिद्द, मुहल, इङ्गाल</strong>, &amp;c. for <strong>हरिद्रा, दरिद्र, मुखर,अङ्गार</strong>, &amp;c. When the <strong>र्</strong> forming the first member of a conjunct issoftened in this way, and the following member is weak or isitself capable of becoming , the whole conjunct becomes <strong>ल्ल</strong>; as<strong>पर्यस्त</strong> becomes <strong>पल्लट्टत्थ, पर्याण, पल्लाण;आर्द्र, अल्ल</strong> or <strong>ओल्ल;मर्द, मल्ल</strong>, &amp;c,The sibilant <strong>म्</strong>, which is the only one we have in the Mahārāṣṭrīand Śaurasenī, is sometimes softened to , that is, the simpleheavy breath somewhat compressed at the dental position is madeuncompressed heavy vocsl sound; as in <strong>दिवह, पाहाण, दह, एआरह,बारह</strong> &amp;c., for <strong>दिवस, पाषाण, दश, एकादश द्वादश</strong> &amp;c.</p>
<p>Another phenomenon characteristic of the Prakrits is the dropping away of single uninitial consonants. The <strong>क्</strong> is dropped, as in<strong>सअड, कुम्भआर</strong> for <strong>शकट, कुम्भकार</strong>, &amp;c.; <strong>ग्</strong> as in <strong>नअ, नअर साअर</strong>, for <strong>नग,नगर, सागर,</strong> &amp;c.; <strong>च्</strong> as in <strong>वअण, सूई</strong>, for <strong>वचन, सूचि</strong>, &amp;c.;<strong>ज्</strong> asin <strong>रअअ,राआ, गअ</strong> for <strong>रजत, राजा, गज,</strong> &amp;c.; <strong>त्</strong>as in <strong>विआण, पआवई, गअ</strong>,for <strong>वितान,प्रजापति, गत</strong> &amp;c.; <strong>द्</strong>as in <strong>मअण, पाअ, कअल</strong>, for <strong>मदन, पाद, कदल</strong>, &amp;c.; <strong>प्</strong>followed by any vowel except <strong>अ</strong>, as in <strong>रिऊ, कई, विउल</strong>, for <strong>रिपु कपि,विपुल</strong> &amp;.; <strong>य्</strong>as in <strong>वाउणा, णअण</strong>, for <strong>वायुना, नयन</strong>, &amp;c.; as in <strong>जीज, दिअह</strong>,for <strong>जीव दिवस</strong> &amp;c.The vowel <strong>अ</strong> or <strong>आ</strong> that remains after thealision is, when proceded by <strong>अ</strong> or <strong>आ</strong>, pronounced like a light <strong>य</strong>.Wo find it written in mss. also as in <strong>सयढ, तित्थयरो, नगर</strong>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>In the same way, the mute element of the aspirates is dropped,except in the case of the palatals and of, the or the heavy<em>nāda</em> or vocal sound being alone preserved. Thus we have <strong>मुह,लिह, सही</strong>, for <strong>मुख लिख सखी</strong>, &amp;c., <strong>मेह, माह, पाहुण</strong>, for <strong>मेघ, माघ, प्राघुण</strong>,&amp;c.; <strong>नाह, मिहुण, कहा</strong>, for <strong>नाथ, मिथुन, कथा</strong>, &amp;c.; <strong>बाहेर, वहू, साहु</strong>, for <strong>वधिरवधू, साधु</strong>, &amp;c.; <strong>लाह, सोहग्ग, सोहा</strong>, for <strong>लाभ, सौभाग्य, शोभा</strong>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The range of the operation of these processes is very wide, andthe number of words transformed in accordance with them isvery large. Now, the principle which is at the bottom of thisclision of consonants is the same as that which brings aboutsoftening, viz., economy of exertion. But in a growing languagewhich knows of no accidents in the course of its history, thereis another principle which counteracts this, viz., the necessity ofpronouncing words in the manner to be understood by others.Hence a wholesale elision is impossible; and the natural course isto soften sounds away, until finally they are elided. This of coursemust be a very slow process. But in the Prakrit, and especiallythe Mahārāṣṭrī, we do not find it to be slow.</p>
<p>Elision seems to be a distinguishing characteristic which strikesone very forcibly on reading a Prakrit passage. It is too regular,systematic, and far-reaching, to have been the product of a longcourse of softening. In fact, because it is so systematic andgeneral, some writers have doubted whether the Prakrits weregenuine dialects, and have expressed their belief that they are thecreation of Paṇḍits. But we shall find that the modern vernaculars retain the words shorn of their elements by the Prakrits inthis way; and that these latter dialects were the immediateparents of those we now speak in Northern India. If this generalmutilation of words was brought about by a natural decay, wemust suppose the process to have gone on for a great manycenturies. The Prakrit vocables that have descended to themodern vernaculars have not, since the period when the Prakritsarose about fourteen centuries ago, suffered at all so much asSanskrit words in passing into the Prakrits. We have not droppedaway any of the elements of Prakrit vocables, though we mayhave re-arranged them In some cases. If, then, fourteen centurieshave not been sufficient to make words lose any of their elementsby the action of natural causes, the process by which Sanskrit</p>
<p>words were mutilated and became Prakritmust, if it was naturaland ordinary, have been in operation for a considerably longerperiod, a supposition which appears extremely improbable. And itis questionable whether a language which has not been exposedto accidents in the course of its history suffers so much, evenafter the lapse of any conceivable time. The Teutonic languages,though they have been going through an independent course ofdevelopment, since the period when the ancestors of the modernEnglish and Germans separated from the ancestors of the Hindusin pre-historic ages, have preserved the elements of old Aryanvocables which the Prakrits lost. They may have transformedthe words, but have not mutilated them to any great extent. TheEnglish words <em>father, mother, brother, foot</em>, and others, have all theelements of the old <strong>पितृ, मातृ, भ्रातृ ,पद्</strong>(<strong>पाद</strong>), and others; while the Prakrit <strong>पीआ</strong> or <strong>पीउ, माआ, माइ</strong> or <strong>माउ, भाआ</strong> or <strong>भाउ</strong>, and <strong>पाअ</strong>, and themodern vernacular <strong>पिउ, माउ, मा, माई, भाई, भाउ</strong>, and <strong>पा</strong> or <strong>पाय</strong>, havelost all except the first consonantal sound.</p>
<p>The elision of consonants on a large scale in the Prakrits istherefore to be accounted for in another way than by attributingit to a natural process of decay. The Prakrit words must be takento represent the pronunciation of the corresponding Sanskritwords by an alien race. The vocal organs of the people of thatrace were unused to the utterance of Sanskrit sounds and in thisrespect, they were in the condition of children, making their firstattempts at articulate speech, and elided uninitial consonantalsounds and assimilated cojunct consonants as these do. When a child or a barbarous foreigner listens to an elderly or morecivlized person, he has not the patience to attend to all the soundscomposing a word and to reproduce them carefully, or has notacquired the habit of doing so. The first letter alone makes a strongimpression on his ear, and this he faithfully reproduces; and asto the rest, he realizes their quantity by pronouncing the vowels,but his tongue being untrained, the peculiar movements necessaryfor uttering the consonantal sounds he cannot go through, andavoids. In going over the Pali we had to attribute the assimilation of conjuncts and other peculiarities observable in that dialectto such a cause; and now the elision in the Prakrits that we</p>
<p>have been considering must, I believe, be accounted for in thesame way.</p>
<p>But what could be the historical events which led to thewholesale assimilation of consonants in the first place and to thesimilar elision of uninitial consonants in addition to the assimilation, in the next ? I would put forward the following hypothesis.It would appear that when the Aryas moved from the land of thefive rivers and settled in the country known afterwards asBrahmāvarta and Kurukṣetra, — that is the country aboutThāneśvar, they formed a consolidated community, in which anaboriginal or alien race was incorporated and the language represented by the Pali was the language of this race. When, however,the consolidated community spread eastwards and southwards, they met other alien races, and the dialect, spoken by the lowestclass of the consolidated community, was learnt by these newalien races, and the words which were in the Pali stage, werefurther corrupted into the forms which we find in Prakrits. Thedialects of the Aśoka edicts do not show instances of the Prakritrule of elision, though some peculiarities of one or two laterdialects are discernable in them. Does this necessarily showthat the Prakrits had not developed in the time of Aśoka ?I think not. The dialects of the edicts represent the spokenlanguage of the more cultured portion of the consolidated community, and not that used by the races, which were newly incorporated with the community, and formed a class lower in thescale, though the Prakrits must have begun to be developedabout the time of Aśoka. In the Nasik cave inscriptions of aboutthe second century of the Christian era, we observe someinstances of the Prakrit peculiarity of elision, whence it wouldappear that the Prakrits had then come into existence, thoughthey were still regarded as vulgar and were neglected, theprincipal inscriptions being in the Pali which had then become alearned language. The conclusion we came to in the last lecture,that the Pali represents middle Sanskrit in a vernacular form,while the Prakrits correspond to the last or classical stage, is inharmony with this view.</p>
<p>Another process which transforms the words of a language isassimilation. We have already discussed the assimilation of the</p>
<p>members of a conjunot and of the dipthongal sounds <strong>ऐ</strong> and <strong>औ</strong>,and will now consider the application of the process to thedifferent syllables composing a word. The <strong>अ</strong>of the second syllableof <strong>ईषत्, वेतस्</strong>,and <strong>कृपण</strong>, is changed to <strong>इ</strong>, because the vowel in thefirst is <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>ए</strong>, the <strong>ऋ</strong> of <strong>कृपण</strong> being changed to <strong>इ</strong>;and we have <strong>ईसि,वेडिस,</strong> and <strong>किविण</strong>.Similarly, the <strong>अ</strong> of <strong>मरिच</strong> and <strong>वल्ली</strong>, and the <strong>इ</strong>of<strong>इक्षु</strong> are changed to <strong>इ, ए</strong>,and <strong>उ</strong> through the influence of thefollowing <strong>इ, ई</strong>, and <strong>उ</strong>; and the forms are <strong>मिरिअ, वेल्ली</strong>, and <strong>उच्छु</strong>.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when <strong>य्</strong> as a member of a conjunct is changed toa palatal, it influences the preceding vowel and brings it over toits own position, as in <strong>सेज्जा</strong> for <strong>शय्या, मज्झिम</strong> for <strong>मध्यम, गेज्झ</strong> for <strong>ग्राह्य</strong>,&amp;c. An original palatal also produces similar effect, as in <strong>जिमइ</strong>or <strong>जेमइ</strong> for <strong>जमति</strong>.</p>
<p>In the words <strong>पुढम</strong> for <strong>प्रथम पोम्म</strong> for <strong>पद्म</strong>, and <strong>ओप्पेइ</strong>for <strong>अर्पयति</strong>, theadjoining vowel is changed to a to make it go easily with thelabial <strong>प</strong>. You will observe that it is that yields so readily tothe influence of an adjoining letter, because in pronouncingit no movement of the tongue is necessary. It is soundedby letting off <em>nāda</em> or intonated breath, without offering anyobstruction to it; and this current gives rise to the differentvowels when it is obstructed in various degrees by variousmovements of the tongue and the lips; so that if the organicposition of the previous consonant remains a little longer,or if the following is begun a little earlier, the currentassumes the form that that position gives it. An aspirate or anaspirated mute existing in a word influences an adjoining vowelor a consonant; that is, the heavy breath that is necessary for theutterance of the aspirate mingles itself with the other sounds also.Thus <strong>कासित</strong> becomes <strong>खासिअ;परुष, फरूस; परिध, फलिह; परिखा, फलिहा;पनस, फणस;</strong> and <strong>बिसिनी, भिसिणी</strong>, in which instances <strong>क्, प्</strong>, and <strong>ब्</strong> arechanged to <strong>ख्, फ्,</strong> and <strong>भ्</strong>. In other cases the heavy breath istransferred to an adjoining vowel which becomes <strong>ह्</strong>;as in <strong>फलिह</strong>for <strong>स्फटिक;निहस</strong> for <strong>निकष, विहत्थी</strong> for <strong>वितस्तवबसही</strong> for <strong>वसति, भरह</strong>for<strong>भरत</strong>, in which cases, by the dropping of the mute, we should have,but for this heavy breath, <strong>फलिअ, निअस विअत्थी, वसई</strong>, and <strong>भरअ.</strong> Thewords <strong>सटा</strong> and <strong>शकट</strong> become <strong>सढा</strong> and <strong>सभढ</strong>, the <strong>ठ्</strong> &amp; resulting from thetransference of the heavy breath being softened to <strong>ढ्</strong>.</p>
<p>Another kind of assimilation must be noticed here. Thevowels are open sounds and the consonants close. These beingused together, the openness of the former has a tendency to diminish to assimilate them to the latter, and the closeness of the latter has a similar tendency to yield to the openness of theformer. This latter change involves economy and is the same assoftening; <strong>त्</strong> and <strong>प्</strong>for instance become more and more likevowels, when they are changed to <strong>द्</strong> and <strong>ब्</strong>, and thence <strong>ल्</strong> to and <strong>व्</strong>;while the latter ultimately does become the vowel <strong>उ</strong>. But, theformer does not involve softening in itself but rather hardening,since <strong>ए</strong> or <strong>इ</strong>, and <strong>ओ</strong> or <strong>उ</strong>, to which <strong>अ</strong>is sometimes changed, occasion motions of the tongue and the lips. which the latterdoes not. But in this change, there is an ease of pronunciation,such as is involved in assimilation. Immediately after oneclosing of the passage of the breath, it is easier to make a shorteropening for it such as <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong> require, before another closing,than a longer one, such as the pronunciation of <strong>ए</strong>and <strong>ओ</strong> requires,or a complete one, such as is necessary for <strong>अ</strong>. This last vowel therefore has a tendency to pass off into <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>इ</strong>, or <strong>ओ</strong>and <strong>उ</strong>.But whether the shorter opening is to be made at the middle ofthe palate or at the lips, that is, whether <strong>अ</strong>is to be changed to <strong>ए</strong>and <strong>इ</strong>, or <strong>ओ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong>, depends on the vocal habits of a people. Someare accustomed to open their lips and round them, others not.Similarly, whether the opening shall be the least possible or alittle more, that is, whether <strong>अ</strong> is to be changed to <strong>ए</strong> or <strong>ओ</strong> first,and then to <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>उ</strong>, or at once to <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>उ</strong>, depends upon habit. Andthe ease of pronunciation involved in this kind of assimilation isalso relative. Some people may feel the muscular effort requiredfor <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong> to be more intolerable than the wider or completeopening, and prefer <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong>or even <strong>अ</strong>, as in the instances givenunder vowel softening, and in others occurring in some of themodern vernaculars. The Prakrits change <strong>अ</strong> to <strong>इ</strong> in virtue ofthis law of assimilation, as in <strong>पिक्क</strong>for <strong>पक्क, इङ्गाल</strong> for <strong>अङ्गार, मुइङ्ग</strong>for <strong>मृदङ्ग, सिवि</strong>ण for <strong>स्वप्न</strong>, and <strong>णिडाल</strong> for <strong>ललाट</strong>; and to <strong>ए</strong> in <strong>मेन्दुआ</strong> for<strong>कन्दुक, एत्थ</strong>for <strong>अत्रदेक्ख</strong> for <strong>द्रक्ष</strong>&amp;c.</p>
<p>Opposed to this process of assimilation is dissimilation. Whenthe same vowel occurs in two successive syllables, it is felt to beburdensome, and hence a dissimilar vowel is substituted for it in</p>
<p>one of the two. We have thus <strong>बहडेअ</strong>for <strong>विभीतक, सढिल</strong> for <strong>शिथिल,पुहषी</strong> for <strong>पृथवी, मउल, मउढ</strong>and <strong>मउर</strong> for <strong>मुकुल, मुकुट</strong> and <strong>मुकुर, भिउडी</strong> for<strong>भुकुटी, पुरिस</strong> for <strong>पुरुष, निउर</strong> or <strong>नेउर</strong> for <strong>नूपुर, दुअल्ल</strong>for <strong>दुकूल, सोअमल्ल</strong> for<strong>सौकुमार्य, अगरु</strong> for <strong>अगुरु, गलोइ</strong>for <strong>गुडूची</strong>, and <strong>गरुअ</strong> for <strong>गुरुक</strong>.</p>
<p>The words <strong>अङ्गुदी</strong> and हरडई for <strong>इङ्गुदी</strong>and <strong>हरीतकी</strong> must also beconsidered as instances of the same law, though another syllableintervenes between the two containing the same vowel. Instancesof this process must necessarily be few, since there are not manywords containing the same vowel in successive syllables. But wehave got so many here, that the substitution of a dissimilar vowelin such cases may be considered a general characteristic of thePrakrits. It will also be seen that in these instances, <strong>अ</strong>is subsituted for <strong>इ</strong> throughout, and for <strong>उ</strong>mostly; so that these may alsobe considered as instances in which the most open sound अwaspreferred by the Prakrit speakers to <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>उ</strong>, as involving lessexertion.</p>
<p>The first <strong>अ</strong> of स<strong>मृद्धि, प्रसिद्धि प्रकट, प्रतिपद्, सदृक्ष</strong>, &amp; is lengthenedoptionally and we have <strong>समिद्धि</strong> or <strong>सामिद्धि, पसिद्धि</strong> or <strong>पासिद्धि, प-पाअड,प-पाडिव, स-सारिच्छ</strong>, &amp;c. On the other hand, the <strong>आ</strong> of <strong>यथा, तथा,उत्खात, संस्थापित, प्राकृत, हालिक, कुमार</strong> &amp;c. is optionally shortened; andthese words become <strong>जह-हा,तह-हा, उक्खअ-क्खाअ, संठविअ-ठाविअ, पअडह-पाअड, हलिअ-हालिञ, कुमर-मार</strong> &amp;c.</p>
<p>The <strong>ई</strong> of <strong>पानीय, अलीक, जीवति गभीर, द्वितीय, तृतीय</strong>, &amp;c., is necessarilyshortened, and we have <strong>पाणिअ, अलिअ जिवइ, गहिर दुइअ तहअ</strong>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Changes of this nature seem to be due to some kind of accentwith which the words must have been pronounced. When oneof the syllables of a word is accented, the whole vocal weight ofthat word gravitates towards that syllable. It is sounded withgreater force and pitch and with a jerk which are apt tocause a wider opening between the organs of speech than isnecessary. Hence the less open vowels <strong>अ, इ,</strong> and <strong>उ</strong> have atendency to become more open, *i. e.,*<strong>आ, ए</strong>, and <strong>ओ</strong>. Similarly theforce and the jerk tend to prolong the time occupied by theutterance of the vowel, that is, to lengthen it. And long vowelsoccurring in the unaccented syllables often become short, sincethey are uttered hurriedly or carelessly. Supposing <strong>प्रतिपद्</strong> waspronounced with the accent on <strong>प्र</strong>, that would be a reason why the</p>
<p><strong>प्र</strong> should become <strong>प्रा</strong>in the course of time; and if <strong>द्वितीय</strong>waspronounced with the accent on <strong>य</strong>, we can understand why the<strong>ती</strong> should become short.</p>
<p>But the real nature of the old Sanskrit accents, notwithstandingthe labours of the grammarians, is little understood. How wordswere actually pronounced in this respect it is difficult to say.If the <em>udātta</em> was really the acute accent, it falls in some of theabove words on syllables, by being on which, it could not haveoperated in the manner indicated above. The supposition thatthe <em>svarita</em> was the acute accent fails equally. But perhaps theold accents went out of use very early, and others took up theirplace. Whatever may have been the case, the changes we havebeen considering seem to have risen from an accent of some sort.</p>
<p>The <strong>ए</strong> of <strong>वेदना, चपेटा, देवर</strong>, and <strong>केसर</strong> is optionally changed to <strong>इ</strong>;for, supposing that the accent fell on the second or third syllable,the force necessary to pronounce it could not be successfullyexerted if the mouth had to be previously opened wide for sounding <strong>ए</strong>. It is thus reduced to the close vowel <strong>इ</strong>; and so wehave <strong>विअणा, चविडा, दिअर</strong> and <strong>किसर</strong>. The dropping of initial vowels as in <strong>रण्ण</strong> for <strong>अरण्य</strong>, and <strong>लाबू</strong>for <strong>अलाबू</strong>must also be traced tothose vowels being unaccented. The accent on the penultimatevowel, which is very general in the vernaculars, as will benoticed in the next lecture, had probably its beginning in thesePrakrits, and of this fact these six words are instances. Thispenultimate accent seems to have had a wider range in the laterstage of these dialects represented by the Apabhraṁśa.</p>
<p>There are several instances in these dialects of the interchangeof consonants. The word <strong>स्नुषा</strong>becomes <strong>सुण्हा</strong>, while regularly itought to be <strong>ण्हुसा</strong>; <strong>ण्ह्</strong>and <strong>म्</strong> thus interchange places. Similarly,<strong>करेणू</strong> is transformed to <strong>कणेरू, वाराणसी</strong> to <strong>वाणारसी, अचलपुर</strong> to <strong>अलचपुर,आलान</strong> to <strong>आणाल, लघु</strong> to <strong>हल</strong> ( <strong>लहु</strong> also being used ), <strong>महाराष्ट्र</strong> to <strong>मरहट्ट</strong>, &amp;c.In the case of <strong>विच्छुअ</strong>for <strong>वृश्चिक</strong>, we have an interchange of vowels,for the <strong>उ</strong> resulting from <strong>ऋ</strong> is transferred to <strong>श्च</strong>, and its <strong>इ</strong> to <strong>व</strong>. Inordinary life we often find that s man, speaking hastily, makesthe sounds of a word thus interchange places. When severalpeople happen to do so in the case of particular words, the newtransformations come in the course of time to be regarded as thetrue words and acquire a recognized position.</p>
<p>The Prakrits sometimes change a labial to the nasal of itsclass as in <strong>नीम</strong> for <strong>नीप, आमेल</strong> for <strong>आपीड, कमन्ध</strong> for <strong>कबन्ध, नीमी</strong> for<strong>नीवि, समर</strong> for <strong>शबर</strong>, and <strong>सिमिण</strong> for <strong>स्वप्न</strong>. These are optional changes;the forms of the words with <strong>व</strong>or <strong>ब</strong> instead of <strong>म</strong> also existing.Though the change involves softening, since a portion of thebreath is sent through the nose and the force of the contactweakened, it must be attributed to a tendency to speak throughthe nose.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Prakrits introduced an <em>anusvāra</em> into wordswhich did not originally contain it; where also the breath wasdischarged through the mouth as well as nose.In this manner,<strong>वक</strong> became <strong>वंक अश्रु, अंसु, श्मश्रु, मंसु;स्पर्श, फंस; पुच्छ, एंछ;मूर्धा मुंढा;बुध्न, बुंध;दर्शन, दंसण, वृश्चिक, विंचुअ;मार्जार, मंजार; प्रतिश्रुत्, पडंसआ</strong>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The last syllable of the absolutive termination <strong>ऊण</strong> and of thecase endings <strong>एण</strong> and <strong>एसु</strong> is also sometimes nasalised, as in <strong>काऊणं</strong>or <strong>काऊण</strong> for <strong>कृत्वा</strong> and <strong>वच्छेणं</strong> or <strong>ण</strong>and <strong>वच्छेसुं</strong>or <strong>सु</strong> for <strong>वृक्षेण</strong> and <strong>वृक्षेषु</strong>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the existing <em>ausvāra</em> of a few wordsis dropped, probably from a feeling that its existence in thosewords was due to a mistake and from a desire to correct it. Thuswe have <strong>मास</strong> or <strong>मंस</strong> for <strong>मांस, का</strong>स or <strong>कंस</strong> for <strong>कांस्य, पासु</strong> or <strong>पंसु</strong> for <strong>पांसु,दाणि</strong> or <strong>दाणिं</strong> for <strong>इदानीं</strong>, and of <strong>णं</strong> or <strong>ण</strong>as the termination of thegen. pl. The letter <strong>ल्</strong> is, in a few cases optionally, sometimesnecessarily, transformed into <strong>ण्</strong>, as in <strong>णाहल</strong> or <strong>लाहल, णङ्गुल</strong> or<strong>लङ्गुल, णङ्गूल</strong> or <strong>लङ्गुल</strong>and <strong>णडाल</strong> or <strong>णिडाल</strong>, for <strong>लाहल, लाङ्गल, लाङ्गुल</strong>, and<strong>ललाट</strong>. In the last instance <strong>ट्</strong> is softened and made to exchange its place with the second <strong>ल्</strong>, and the <strong>अ</strong> of <strong>ण</strong> becomes <strong>इ</strong> optionally.This also points to the Prakrit characteristic of speaking throughthe nose.</p>
<p>The remarks I have hitherto made apply to the Mahārāṣṭrīorthe principal Prakrit. The Śaurasenīdiffers from it in but a fewparticulars. It does not drop <strong>त्</strong> and <strong>थ्</strong>, but softens them into <strong>द्</strong>and <strong>ध्</strong>, as in <strong>पुरिद, मारुदि, तधा, नाध</strong>, &amp;c., for <strong>पूरित, मारुति, तथा, नाथ,</strong>&amp;c.The conjunct <strong>न्त</strong> is often changed to <strong>न्द्</strong> as in <strong>निचिन्दो, अन्देडर</strong> for<strong>निश्चिन्त अन्तःपुर</strong> &amp;c.</p>
<p>In addition to these peculiarities, in the Māgadhī the <strong>र्</strong> and <strong>स्</strong>of the principal Prakrit are represented by <strong>ल्</strong> and <strong>ण्</strong> as in <strong>नल, कल,शालश, पुलिश</strong>, for <strong>नर, फर, सारस, पुरुष</strong>, &amp;c. The <strong>स्</strong>of a conjunct is not</p>
<p>assimilated but preserved, and the <strong>ष्</strong> changed to <strong>स्</strong>, as in <strong>पस्खलदिहस्ती</strong> for <strong>प्रस्खलति हस्ती, शुष्क दालु</strong> for <strong>शुष्क दारु, कस्ट</strong>, for <strong>कष्ट</strong> &amp;c. The double<strong>द्</strong> and the conjunct <strong>ष्ठ</strong> are changed to <strong>स्ट्</strong>, and <strong>स्थ्</strong> and <strong>र्थ</strong> to <strong>स्त; ठ्</strong>and <strong>श्</strong> being thus softened to <strong>द्</strong> and <strong>त्</strong>. Thus we have <strong>भस्टालिका</strong> for<strong>भट्टारिका, सुस्टु</strong>, for <strong>सुष्टु. उवस्तिद</strong> for <strong>उपस्थित शस्तबाह</strong> for <strong>सार्थवा</strong>ह, &amp;c.The consonant <strong>ज्</strong> whether original, or derived, as in the Prakritcorruptions of <strong>य्</strong> or <strong>र्य</strong>, was pronounced lightly, that is softened to<strong>य</strong>, as in <strong>याणादि</strong> for <strong>जानाति, अय्य</strong> for <strong>अद्य</strong>&amp;c. The conjuncts <strong>ज्ञ्, न्य्</strong>,and <strong>ण्य्</strong> are, as before mentioned, changed to <strong>ञ्ञ्</strong>, as in Pali; and<strong>च्छ्</strong>to <strong>श्च्</strong>, as in <strong>गश्च, पुश्च</strong>for <strong>गच्छ, पृच्छ</strong>, &amp;c. The <strong>क्ष्</strong>of <strong>प्रेक्ष्</strong>and <strong>चक्ष्</strong>is changed to <strong>स्क्</strong>, as in <strong>पेस्कदि</strong> for <strong>प्रेक्षते</strong> and <strong>आचस्कादि</strong> for <strong>आचक्षते</strong>.</p>
<p>In the Paiśācī, the changes of single consonants that we havenoticed in the case of the Mahārāṣṭrīand Śaurasenīdo not takeplace; that is, the consonants are not dropped or softened, nor arethey transformed by the process of assimilation. The dentalsare not changed to cerebrals, but the original Sanskrit cerebralsare optionally changed to dentals, as in <strong>कुतुम्बक</strong> or <strong>कुटुम्बक</strong> for<strong>कुटुम्बक</strong>; and an original <strong>ण्</strong> to <strong>न्</strong> throughout as in <strong>सुनगन</strong> for गुणगण.Tha sonant <strong>द्</strong>is hardened to <strong>त्</strong>, asin <strong>तामोतर</strong> for <strong>दामोदर, पतेस</strong> for<strong>प्रदेश</strong>, &amp;c. The sibilants are changed to <strong>म्</strong> as in Pali and theprincipal Prakrit, and <strong>ज्ञ्</strong> and <strong>न्य्</strong> to <strong>ञ्ञ्</strong> as in the former.</p>
<p>In the CūlikāPaiśācī, the sonants are throughout changed tosurds, as in <strong>नकर, मक्कन, मेख, बक्ख, राचा, चीमूत</strong>, &amp;c., for <strong>नगर, मार्गण, मेघ,व्याघ्र, राजा, जीमूत</strong>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Phonetically, the Paiśācīappears to be in nearly the same condition as the Pali, but the hardening of sonants is peculiar, andmay be compared to the change of Sanskrit sonants to surds in theTeutonic languages, as in <em>foot</em> for <strong>पढ्</strong>, <em>tooth</em> for <strong>दत्</strong>, <em>know</em> for <strong>ज्ञा</strong>, &amp;c.Such changes involve no economy whatever; and like the changeof dentals to cerebrals, they must be attributed to certain peculiarities of the vocal organs. Even in the operation of the usualprocesses we have, as you will have seen, found very wide scopefor the play of similar special aptitudes. The characteristic ofthe dialect we have been considering, of not changing dentalsto cerebrals as the Pali and the Prakrits do, and even the dentalizing of cerebrals, would appear to be truly Aryan. Perhapsthen, this was the language of an Aryan tribe that had remained</p>
<p>longer in the original seat of the race, and was connected with theancestors of Teutons, so as to develop a phonetic peculiarity resembling theirs, and emigrated to India at a very late period and settledon the borders. Or it might be, that the tribe came to Indiaalong with the others; but living in the mountainous countrieson the border, in a sort of rude independence, it developed thispeculiarity of pronunciation, which to my mind betokens a rudeand uncontrollable force of breath. Since, under this supposition,they could not have come in very close contact with their morecivilized brethren of the plains, their language did not undergosome of those phonetic modifications, which Sanskrit underwentin the mouths of the aboriginal races. And in a Sanskrit versequoted by Mr. Ellis in his preface to Campbell&rsquo;s Grammar of theTelugu language, the countries where the Paiśācī is said to haveprevailed are such border countries as Gāndhāra or Afghanistan,Nepal, Bāhlika or Balk, &amp;c¹.</p>
<p><strong>III THE GRAMMAR OF THE PRAKRITS</strong></p>
<p>We will now proceed to examine the Grammar of the Prakrits.As in the Pali, the dual and the dative case are wanting. Thetermination of the instr. pl. is <strong>हि</strong>, the other Pali <strong>भि</strong> having disappeared. The ablative pl. which was lost in the older dialectis made up by adding <strong>तो</strong>, Skr. <strong>तम्</strong>, to the <strong>हि</strong>of the instr. pl., whichwas used in Pali for the abl., and to <strong>सु</strong>, the termination of thelocative, and using <strong>हिन्तो</strong> and <strong>सुन्तो</strong> as the terminations for allnouns. This <strong>तो</strong> in the from of <strong>दो</strong>and <strong>दु</strong> is also used to form theabl. sing of all nouns. This is according to Vararuci. ButHemacandra gives <strong>दो</strong> and <strong>दु</strong> as the Śaurasenīterminations and <strong>ओ</strong>and <strong>उ</strong> as those in the principal Prakrit, which is according totheusual phonetic rules. The grammarian gives <strong>त्तो</strong>as an additional termination for both numbers, and <strong>ओ</strong>and <strong>उ</strong>to the pluralalso, and <strong>हिन्तो</strong>to the singular². In Prakrit, sometimes consonants are doubled even when there is no conjunct in the originalSanskrit. Hence we have <strong>त्तो</strong>; and the reason why this and <strong>दो</strong> and <strong>दु</strong> or <strong>ओ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong> are extended to the plural is that in Skr. the expression made up of a noun and this termination has both senses; as <strong>ग्रामतः</strong> may mean <em>from a village or villages</em>. The gen. sing. <strong>स्स</strong> from the <strong>स्य</strong> of Sanskrit nouns in <strong>अ</strong> is generalized as in Pali and applied to all masc. and neut. nouns; and the pl. is formed by the old Skr. term. <strong>नाम्</strong>, Prakritized to <strong>णं</strong>, as in the older dialect. The Pali pronominal abl. <strong>स्म</strong> or <strong>म्हा</strong> has disappeared and the loc.<strong>स्मि</strong> for fir has assumed the form of <strong>म्मि</strong> and is used for all nouns of the masc, and neut. genders as in the other language. The voc. pl. is as in Skr. and Pali the same as the nom. pl.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1. Names of other countries in Central or Southern India also occur ; butthe reading of the verse is evidently corrupt.</p>
<p>2. I shall in all my observations on the Prakrits follow Hemacandra, sinceheis full and explicit. Vararuci is indistinct in several cases, and hisrules on that account have been misunderstood by all writers who havefollowed him; and be is incomplete.</p>
<p><strong>Masculine Nouns in अ</strong></p>
<p>The nom., acc., and instr. cases of nouns in <strong>अ</strong> are the same as in Pali; but here the nom. pl. form <strong>वच्छा</strong> is optionally transferred to the acc. pl. also, thus giving another instance of the strong. tendency to confuse the nom, and acc. that I have spoken of The dat. sing. in <strong>आय</strong> like that in Pali, is preserved in solitary instances in which it has the sense of &quot; for the sake of &ldquo;. The abl. sing., besides the general forms mentioned above, has the old one ending in T, as in Pali, and a new one in <strong>आहि</strong> which is used in the plural also. This <strong>आहि</strong> is used in Sanskrit in the words <strong>दक्षिणाहि</strong> and उत्तराहि,<sup id="fnref:130"><a href="#fn:130" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">130</a></sup>which have an ablative signification. It must in its origin be considered the same as the instr. termination <strong>भिस्</strong>. The loc, sing. besides the general form has, as in Pali, the old one in g. The voc. sing. has also the two Pali forms, <strong>देवा देवा</strong> and another <strong>देवो</strong> the same as the nom. sing.</p>
<p><strong>Masculine Nouns in द and उ</strong></p>
<p>The nom. pl. has a form made up according to the analogy of neuter nouns or nouns ending in <strong>इन्</strong>;as <strong>अग्गिणो</strong> and <strong>साहुणो</strong>, This does not exist in the Pali, the analogy being there extended to the gen. and loo. sing. only. The Prakrit has also the two Pali forms <strong>अग्गी</strong> and <strong>अग्गयो</strong>, which latter is transformed into <strong>जग्गओ</strong> and <strong>अग्गउ</strong> and <strong>साहु</strong> and <strong>साइवो</strong>, the latter appearing also in the form of <strong>साहओ</strong> and <strong>साहउ</strong>. The acc. pl. has also the neuter form for
<strong>अग्गिनो</strong> or <strong>साहुणो</strong> in addition to the Pali <strong>अग्गी</strong> or <strong>साहु</strong>. Besides the generalforms mentioned above, the abl. has in the sing, the neuter form <strong>अग्गिणो</strong> or <strong>साहुणों</strong> also. The Pali loc. sing. <strong>अग्गिाण</strong> does not appear.</p>
<p>The other forms of these nouns are like those in the older dialect. The voc. sing. is <strong>अग्गि</strong> or <strong>साहु</strong> as in Pali, and <strong>अग्गी</strong> Or <strong>साहू</strong>. We here see the analogy of neuter nouns or nouns ending in <strong>इन्</strong> extended to all vowel cases except the loc. sing.</p>
<p>Masculine Nouns in ऋ</p>
<p>Two bases, one ending in <strong>आर</strong> an as in <strong>भत्तार</strong> from <strong>भर्तृ</strong> and the other in <strong>उ</strong> as <strong>भत्तु</strong>, are used, the former throughout all the cases. and the latter in all except the sing. of the nom. and soc. The first is declined like nouns in <strong>अ</strong>, and the second like those in <strong>उ</strong> as <strong>साहु</strong>. The nom. sing. has also the old form <strong>भत्ता</strong>. In the Pali, you will remember, the first base is used in the plural of four cases, and the second in the gen. sing. only while the singulars of three cases have the old Sanskrit forms. Here the two bases. have been extended much further and one old form only, that of the nom, sing, remains. Nouns expressive of relationship such as <strong>पितृ, भ्रातृ</strong> and <strong>जामातृ</strong> are declined similarly, the final syllable <strong>आर</strong> being shortened to <strong>अर</strong> as it is in Sanskrit and Pali in those cases where the base is used. The voc. sing. is <strong>भत्त</strong>, and of the latter. cless of nouns it ends in <strong>अ</strong> or <strong>अरं</strong>, as <strong>पिअ</strong> or <strong>पिअरं</strong>.</p>
<p>Masculine Nouns in <strong>अन् अत</strong> ( present participle), <strong>वत्, मत्</strong> &amp;c.</p>
<p><strong>राजन्</strong> has four bases. The old one <strong>राजन्</strong> with the old Sanskrit forms only phonetically corrupted (<strong>ज्ञ्</strong> becoming <strong>ण्ण्</strong>) is used in all the singulars except that of the loc. and in the nom. pl.; as <strong>राआ, राआणी, राआणं, रण्णा, रण्णी</strong> and <strong>रणो</strong>. In Pali it is used in the loc. sing, and gen. pl. also. The second , Prakritised into , <strong>राअ</strong>, is used in both numbers of all cases except the nom. sing., and in Pali in all except the nom. sing. and pl. and the acc. pl. It is declined like a noun in <strong>अ</strong>; as <strong>राआ</strong> nom. pl., tri acc. sing., <strong>राआ-राऐ</strong> ace. pl., <strong>राएण</strong> instr. sing., &amp;o. The third, <strong>राजिन्</strong>, is employed in the gen. sing., in the older dialect; but here, as , in all cases. and numbers except the nom. sing. It is declined like an ordinary Sanskrit noun&rsquo;in <strong>इन्</strong> as <strong>राइणो</strong> nom, and acc. pl., <strong>राइणं</strong> acc. sing., <strong>राइणा</strong> instr. sing., &amp;c. The fourth is <strong>राजान</strong>, Pr.<strong>राआण</strong>, used in all cases and both numbers. Vararuci, however, does not give this, and omits the others in some of the cases. This base is unknownto Pali, but occurs in the word <strong>आत्मन्</strong> in the form of <strong>अत्ताण</strong>, and is used in the plurals of the instr. and loc,, while here it is extended</p>
<p>to all cases. This noun and such others ending in <strong>अन्</strong>are in thePrakrit declined like <strong>राजन्</strong>;the base in <strong>आण</strong>is general to all andused throughout, but the others occur in certain case only. Thevoc. sing, of <strong>राजन्</strong> is <strong>राअं</strong> or <strong>राअ</strong>in the Śaurasenī, the former ofwhich does not occur in the Mahārāṣṭrī.</p>
<p>The base of the present participles ends in <strong>अन्त</strong> and they aredoclined like nouns in <strong>अ</strong>. The Pali, you will remember, uses theold base in some of the cases and has the old forms; but here theyhave disappeared. Similarly <strong>वत् मत्</strong> become and <strong>वन्त</strong> and <strong>मन्त</strong>throughout, i. e., end in <strong>अ</strong>. Other final consonants are droppedand in feminine nouns sometimes <strong>आ</strong>is added.</p>
<p><strong>Feminine and Neuter Nouns</strong></p>
<p>The Prakrit feminine declension differs from the Pali in littlemore than a phonetic corruption of the terminations.</p>
<p>The <strong>य</strong> of the instr., abl., gen. and loc. of nouns in <strong>आ</strong>, and the<strong>या</strong> of those in <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>ई</strong>, are weakened into <strong>ए</strong> or
<strong>इ</strong>or dropped, leavingonly <strong>अ</strong>and <strong>आ</strong>. In the latter class of nouns this <strong>आ</strong> is furtheroptionally shortened to <strong>अ</strong>. Thus we have <strong>मालाए-इ-अ</strong>and <strong>नईए-इ-आ-अ</strong>,&amp;c.</p>
<p>The optional loc. forms in <strong>यं</strong> are lost; and the <strong>यो</strong>of thenom. plurals <strong>मालायो</strong> and <strong>नदियो</strong>leaves only the vowel <strong>ओ</strong>which isagain shortened to <strong>उ</strong>. The abl forms in <strong>दो-दु</strong>or <strong>ओ-उ</strong>are ofcourse new. Fem. nouns in <strong>ऋ</strong> substitute <strong>आ</strong> for the final andare declined like nouns in <strong>आ</strong>; as, <strong>नणन्दा, नणन्दाओ</strong>, &amp;c. <strong>मातृ</strong>,however, has another base <strong>मातरा</strong>when it signifies a &ldquo;goddess.&ldquo;In the Pali four bases are used, the old one, <strong>मातर</strong>, declined likemasc. nouns in <strong>अ, मातु,</strong> and <strong>माता</strong>. This last is used in the gen.pl. only along with <strong>मातराण</strong>, and <strong>मातूनं</strong>.</p>
<p>The nom. and acc. of neuter nouns in <strong>अ</strong>are in the Prakritthe same as in Skr. only phonetically corrupted, as <strong>वणं</strong>sing.,<strong>वणा-इँ-इं-णि</strong> pl.;while the sing. of those in <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong> have an anusvāra optionally attached to them, as <strong>दहि</strong> or <strong>दहिं</strong> a sing., दहीइँ-इ-णिं,pl. The optional Pali plurals in <strong>आ</strong>and <strong>ए</strong> are lost. Sanskrit neuternouns in <strong>अन्</strong> and <strong>अम्</strong> become nouns in <strong>अ</strong>, and are masculine.</p>
<p><strong>Pronouns</strong></p>
<p>The nom. pl. in <strong>ए</strong>is preserved, as in <strong>सव्ये, जे</strong> &amp;c. The gen. pl. has <strong>सिं</strong>for its termination formed by adding a light <strong>इ</strong> to the <strong>साम्</strong> of</p>
<p>Sanskrit, which, according to the usual rules, should be corrupted to <strong>सं</strong>, and is also fromed upon the model of the correspondingnouns as <strong>सव्वेसिं</strong> or <strong>सव्बाण-णं</strong>, <strong>जेसिं</strong>. or<strong>जाण-णं</strong>&amp;c. The Palihas <strong>सं</strong>,and its double gen. <strong>सानं</strong>is wanting. The loc. sing. has the termination <strong>स्सिं</strong>, a form not existing in the older dialect, in additionto the <strong>म्मि</strong>used for nouns, both of which are to be traced to theSkr. <strong>स्मिन्</strong> as in or <strong>सव्वस्सिं</strong>or <strong>सव्वम्मि, जस्सिं</strong> or <strong>जम्मि</strong> &amp;c. This <strong>स्सिं</strong>isfurther changed to <strong>हिं</strong>as in <strong>सव्वहिं, जहिं</strong>, &amp;c., or better, this lattermay be traced to the Pali <strong>म्हि</strong>. Another loc. sing. term. is <strong>त्थ</strong> whichreperesents <strong>त्र</strong>, as <strong>सव्वत्थ, जत्थ</strong> &amp;c. The abl. sing. <strong>स्मात्</strong> is optionallyused after <strong>किम्, यद</strong>, and <strong>तद्</strong>only in the form of<strong>म्हा</strong>, as <strong>कम्हा, जम्हा</strong>,and <strong>तम्हा</strong>; in Pali it is necessarily used after all pronouns. Inother respects pronouns are declined like the correspondingnouns; as <strong>सव्वं, सव्वे</strong>acc.,<strong>सव्वेण सव्वेहिं</strong> Instr., <strong>सव्वत्तो-दो-दु, सव्वाहिन्तो-सुन्तों</strong> abl. The instr. sing. is optionally formed like that of nounsing <strong>इ</strong> in the case of some; as <strong>इमिणा, जिणा</strong>&amp;c.</p>
<p>You will thus observe, that except in the nom. pl., there is nodistinction between the two declensions; the peculiar pronominalforms I have mentioned being only optional. Of the fem. of<strong>तद्, यद्</strong>, and <strong>किम्</strong>, the gen. sing. is optionally <strong>तिस्सा</strong> or <strong>तीसे</strong> &amp;c.,where the base is <strong>ती</strong>&amp;c. The other forms are like those of nounsin <strong>ई</strong>. as <strong>तीआ-ई-ए</strong> &amp;c. This base is used throughout along with theother in <strong>आ</strong>. In Pali it is used in the gen. and loc. sing. onlyalong with the other, and the gen forms are <strong>तिस्सा</strong> and <strong>तिस्साय</strong>,the latter of which is, as I have said, a double genitive. Thisthe Prakrit has preserved in the form of <strong>तीसे</strong>,originally <strong>तिस्से</strong>,where the <strong>ए</strong> represents the <strong>य</strong> of the older dialect, as it does in thefeminine nouns. The other base of <strong>किम्</strong>and <strong>तद्</strong> has also itsgenitive singular in स, as <strong>तास</strong>, formed by transferring the masc.termination or it is to be traced to <strong>तस्सा</strong>. The genitive pluralforms of the masc., such as <strong>तेसिं</strong>and <strong>ताण</strong>, are also sometimes usedin a feminine sense. The loc. sing. of <strong>किम्, यद्</strong>,and <strong>तद्</strong>is optionallyformed by extending the masc. termination <strong>हिं</strong>to the base in <strong>आ</strong>,as <strong>ताहिं</strong>&amp;c. These peculiarities are only optional; so that thefeminine pronouns are declined like nouns in <strong>आ</strong>or <strong>ई</strong>. Thus wehave <strong>जा, जाओ-उ, जीओ-उ</strong> nom., <strong>जं, जाओ-उ, जीओ-उ</strong> acc., जिणा, जाहिं,जीहिंinstr., <strong>जादो-दु जीदो-दु,जाहिन्तो सुन्तो, जीहिन्तो सुन्तो</strong> &amp;c. abl. <strong>जस्सा,जिस्सा, जीसे, जासं, जेसिं, जाण, जीसिं, जीणं</strong>gan., <strong>जाहिं, जासु, जीसु</strong>loc.</p>
<p>The optional instr., abl., gen., and loc. singulars are <strong>जाए-इ-अ</strong> and<strong>जीए-इ-आ-अ</strong>.</p>
<p>The pronoun <strong>न</strong> in the form of <strong>ण</strong> exists as in the Pali; <strong>इदम्</strong> hastwo bases, <strong>इम</strong>, which is used throughout, as <strong>इमो, इमे</strong>nom., <strong>इमं, इमे</strong> acc.,**इमेण-मिणा, इमेहि,**instr. &amp;c; and <strong>अ</strong> from which we have optionally <strong>अअं</strong> nom. sing., <strong>अस्स</strong>and <strong>अस्सि</strong>, gen. and loc. sing, and <strong>एहिं</strong>and <strong>एसु</strong>instr., and loc. plural, and <strong>आहिं</strong> instr. pl. of the feminine.<strong>इमो, इमस्स, इमस्सिं</strong> &amp;c. are also in use. The base <strong>अ</strong> is used in thePali in the instr. sing., gen pl. and abl. sing. also.</p>
<p>The demonstrative <strong>अदस्</strong>, has one base only, <strong>असु</strong>, which is declined like nouns in <strong>उ</strong>;as <strong>अमू, अमुणो</strong>nom., <strong>अमुं अमुणो</strong> acc., <strong>अमुणा, अमूहिं</strong>instr., &amp;c.</p>
<p>The pronoun of the second person has, according to Vararuci,five bases <strong>त, तुम्</strong> or <strong>तुम, तुज्झ, तुम्ह, तुम्म, वो</strong> and <strong>भे</strong>. The first is derived from the त्व of <strong>त्वम्;तुम्</strong> or <strong>तुम</strong> from the same with the <strong>व</strong> softenedto <strong>उ</strong>; <strong>तुज्झ</strong> from <strong>तुभ्यम्</strong> through the intermediate Pali from <strong>तुम्हं</strong>,the last conjunct of which is changed to <strong>ज्झ</strong>, by a rule formerlygiven; <strong>तुम्ह</strong> is made up by putting together the <strong>तु</strong> of the singularand the <strong>स्म</strong> of the plural, as explained in going over the Pali; <strong>तुम्म</strong>is another form of <strong>तुम्ह; वो</strong> is the old Sanskrit <strong>वम्</strong>; and <strong>भे</strong> seems to bederived from the <strong>म्हे</strong> of <strong>तुम्हे</strong> as <strong>वव्भण</strong> is from <strong>ब्राह्मण</strong>. Hemacandraadds <strong>तुब्भ</strong>, to be derived from the Sanskrit <strong>तुभ्यम्</strong> or from <strong>तुम्ह,म्ह</strong>being changed to <strong>ब्भउज्झ</strong>, from <strong>तुज्झ</strong> by the dropping of <strong>त्; तुम्ह</strong>and उय्ह, other forms of <strong>तुभ्यम्</strong>;<strong>तुव</strong>, from <strong>त्व</strong> by the insertion of <strong>उ</strong>; <strong>तुह</strong>,from <strong>तुय्हं; उम्ह</strong>, by the dropping of the <strong>त्</strong> of <strong>तुम्ह</strong>; and <strong>उब्भ</strong>, by treating<strong>तुब्भ</strong> in the same way. The Pali has only a, <strong>त, तु</strong>, and तुम्ह; and theseveral old forms it had are lost in the Prakrit.</p>
<p>Nominal terminations are used in a good many cases. Thuswe have <strong>तं, तुं, तुवं, तुह</strong>, and <strong>तुमं</strong> for the nom. sing., these and <strong>तुए</strong>and<strong>तुमे</strong> for the acc. sing., <strong>तइ, तए, तुमइ, तुमए, तुमे, तुमाइ</strong>, and also <strong>तुमं, भे,ते, दे</strong>, and <strong>दि</strong> for the instr. sing. The form <strong>तुमं</strong> properly belongs to the nom.and acc. cases and to the gen., <strong>दे</strong> and <strong>दि</strong>being only <strong>ते</strong> softened; but several cases are here confounded. Theabl sing. has <strong>तइत्तो-ओ-उ-दो-दु-हि-हिन्तो, तुवत्तो-ओ</strong> &amp;c. <strong>तुमत्तो-ओ</strong> &amp;c.,<strong>तुब्भत्तो-ओ</strong>&amp;c. <strong>तुम्हत्तो-ओ</strong> &amp;c., <strong>तुज्झत्तो-ओ</strong> &amp;c. also <strong>तुय्ह, तुब्भ, तुम्ह</strong>, and<strong>तुज्झ</strong>. The gen. sing. has twenty-one. forms, <em>viz.</em> <strong>तइतुं, ते, तुह, तुहं, तुव, ढम, ढमे, तुमां, इ, दि, इ, ए, तुब्भ, उब्भ, उय्ह, तुम्ह, तुज्झ, उम्ह,</strong></p>
<p>and <strong>उज्झ</strong>. The loc. sing has <strong>तुमे, तुमए तुमाइ तइ, तए, तुम्मि, तुवम्मि, तुहम्मि,तुम्भम्मि, तुम्हम्मि</strong> and <strong>तुज्झम्मि</strong>. The plurals are as follows:—<strong>भे, तुब्भे,उज्झे तुम्ह तुय्हे, उय्हे, तुम्हे, तुज्झे</strong> nom. <strong>वो तुब्भे, उज्झे, तुम्हे, तुज्झे, तुय्हे, उय्हे,भे</strong> acc., <strong>भे, तुब्भेहिं,तुज्झेहिं, तुम्हेहिं, उज्झेहिं, उम्हेहिं,तुय्हेहिं</strong>and <strong>उय्हेहिं</strong> instr.;<strong>तुब्भतो दो-दु-हिन्तो-सुन्तो, तुय्हत्तो-दो</strong> &amp;c., <strong>उय्हत्तो-दो</strong> &amp;c., <strong>उम्हत्तो-दो</strong> &amp;c.,तुम्हत्तो-दो &amp;c.and <strong>तुज्झत्तो-दो</strong> &amp;c. abl; <strong>भे, तुय्ह, तुब्भ, उब्भ, तुब्भाण-णं तुवाण-णं,तुमाण-णं, तुहाण-णं, तुम्हाण-णं, तुम्ह, तुज्झ, उम्ह, उज्झ,तुज्झाण-णं</strong>, gen.; <strong>तुसु, तुव-वेसु, तुम-मेसु, तुह-हेसु तुब्भ-ब्भा-ब्भेसु,तुम्ह म्हा-म्हेसु,तुज्झ-ज्झा-ज्झेसु</strong> loc.</p>
<p>The points to be observed in these forms are these. The nom.sing, has mostly the same forms as the acc. sing. This is due tothe fact that the Sanskrit <strong>त्वाम्</strong>of the acc. becomes, when the <strong>आ</strong>is shortened by a Prakrit phonetic rule, <strong>त्वं</strong>, <em>i. e.</em>, the same as thenom. sing. Hence its Prakrit representatives <strong>तं, तुं, तुवं</strong> at and <strong>तुमं</strong>are the same for both the cases. But a more probable reason,which explains a similar fact in the case of the first personalpronoun also, is that the plurals of the nom, and acc. having bynatural processes already explained become exactly alike, thetwo cases came to be confounded; and the sing. forms also of theone were used for the other. The forms as, <strong>तइ, तए, तुमइ, तुमए, तुमे</strong>, and <strong>तुमाइ</strong>are common to the instr, and loc. sing. This probably arisesfrom the fact that the Sanskrit <strong>त्वया</strong>, when the <strong>य</strong>is softened to <strong>ए</strong>or <strong>इ</strong>, becomes <strong>तए</strong>or <strong>तइ</strong>, and so does the <strong>त्वयि</strong>of the loc.; and whenthe base <strong>त</strong> is seen to be interchangeable with <strong>तुम</strong> in the nom., theterminations <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>इ</strong> which are common to the two cases areapplied to <strong>तुम</strong> also. <strong>ते</strong>and its softened forms <strong>दे</strong> and <strong>दि</strong>, and <strong>तइ</strong>arecommon to the instr, and gen. sing.; <strong>तुय्ह, तुब्भ, तुम्ह, तुज्झ</strong> are common to the abl. sing. and the gen. sing. and pl.; and <strong>भे</strong>to the instr. sing. and pl. and the gen. sing.</p>
<p>Such a confusion of the case-relations must be expected incourse of time. Even in Sanskrit the gen. and instr. &amp;c. areused alike in connection with some participles and the identification of the abl. and the instr. we have already noticed in thePrakrits. The gen. forms <strong>तुय्ह, तुब्भ, तुय्ह, तुज्झ, उब्भ, उम्ह,</strong> and <strong>उज्झ</strong>,all derived from the Sanskrit dat. <strong>तुभ्यम्</strong>and referred to the gen.when that case was lost, are taken as bases, and the terminations<strong>ए</strong> of the nom, and acc. pl., <strong>हि</strong>of the instr. pl., <strong>त्तो, दो, दु, ओ</strong>and <strong>उ</strong> ofthe abl., <strong>ण</strong>or <strong>णं</strong> ot of the gen. pl., and <strong>स्मि</strong>and <strong>सु</strong> of the loc. sing. and</p>
<p>pl. are tacked on to them to form these cases. Here the tendencyto use the genitive form as a base for the formation of the othercases, a trace of which only we observed in the Pali, is seenmore developed.</p>
<p>The pronoun of the first person has, according to Vararuci,the following bases:— <strong>हं</strong> or <strong>अहं</strong> and <strong>म</strong>from the Sanskrit singulars,<strong>मम</strong> the gen. sing., <strong>अम्ह</strong> from <strong>अस्म</strong> and <strong>णो</strong> from <strong>नस्</strong>of which <strong>अम्ह</strong>is used in the plural. Hemacandra adds <strong>मह</strong>and <strong>मज्झ</strong> from <strong>मह्यम्</strong>and <strong>भे</strong>from <strong>म्हे</strong> or <strong>स्मे</strong>. He also gives <strong>अम्हि, अम्मि</strong>, and <strong>म्मि</strong> for thenom, and <strong>अम्मि</strong>for acc. sing. The first is clearly from <strong>अस्मि</strong>1stpers. sing. present of <strong>अस्</strong>, often used in Sanskrit as an indeclinableparticle; and the others are also corruptions of the sanie, just asthe termination <strong>म्मि</strong>of the loc. is a corruption of <strong>स्मिन्</strong>. Thesingular forms, therefore, are:— <strong>अम्मि, म्मि, अम्हि, हं, अहं, अहयं</strong>nom.;<strong>णे, णं, मि, अम्मि, अम्ह, मम्ह, मं, ममं, मिमं अहं</strong> acc.; <strong>मि, मे, ममं ममए, ममाइ,मइ, मए, मयाइ, णे,</strong> instr.; <strong>मइत्तो-दो-दु-ओ-उ-हि-हिन्तो, ममत्तो, महत्तो</strong> &amp;c.,<strong>मज्झत्तो</strong> &amp;c. abl; <strong>मे, मह, मम, मह, महं, मज्झ, मज्झं, अम्ह, अम्हं</strong> gen.; <strong>मि, मइ,ममाइ, मए, मे, अहम्मि, ममम्मि, महम्मि</strong> loc. The plurals are:— <strong>अम्ह, अम्हे,अम्हो, मो,वयं मे</strong> nom. <strong>अम्हे अम्हो, अम्ह, णे</strong> acc.;<strong>अम्हेहिं, अम्हाहि, अम्ह, अम्हे,णे</strong> instr. ; <strong>ममत्तो, अम्हतो, ममाहिन्तो-सुन्तो, अम्हाहिन्तो सुन्तो, ममेसुन्तो, अम्हे,सुन्तो</strong> abl; <strong>णे, णो, मज्झ, अम्ह, अम्हं, अम्हो, अंम्हाण, ममाण, महाण, मज्झाण</strong>gen.; <strong>अम्ह-म्हा-म्हेसु-मम-मेसु, मह-हेमु, मज्झ-ज्झेसु</strong> loc. Here also the sameobservations as those made in the case of the last pronoun areapplicable.</p>
<p>In the Māgadhī the <strong>ओ</strong>of the nom. sing. of nouns ending in <strong>अ</strong>is replaced by <strong>ए</strong> as <strong>एशे पुलिशे</strong> for <strong>एष पुरुषः</strong>. The <strong>स्स</strong> of the gen.sing. is sometimes changed to <strong>ह</strong>and the preceding <strong>अ</strong>is lengthened;as शोणिदाह कुम्भे for <strong>शोणितस्य कुम्भः</strong>.The plural of this case isformed by adding <strong>आहं</strong>, as <strong>कम्माहं</strong> for <strong>कर्मणाम्</strong>, The anusvārarepresents the <strong>ण</strong>of the original termination <strong>आण</strong>, and <strong>ह</strong> is introduced from the analogy of the sing. The regular forms <strong>शोणिदस्स</strong>and <strong>कम्माणं</strong> are also admissible. Such forms as these we shallmeet with hereafter; and they belong to a later stage in the decayof our grammar.</p>
<p><strong>IV. THE PRAKRIT VERB</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Conjugations*:—All the Skr. conjugations, with the exceptionof the second in the case of a few roots ending in a vowel, have</li>
</ul>
<p>been brought over to the <strong>अ</strong>type, <em>i. e</em>., to the first, sixth, and thetenth. Some of the others have left a few traces; as, the fifth andthe ninth have preserved their <strong>ण</strong> in such instances as <strong>सुण, किण, जाण, लुण, पुण, धुण,</strong>— both conjugations being, as you mayremember, confounded in the Pali, the third the root <strong>बीह</strong>—pres.tense <strong>वीहदि</strong>—the <strong>इ</strong> standing for <strong>भ</strong>; the fourth has preserved its <strong>य</strong>assimilated in a good many roots such as <strong>णच्च, बुज्झ, जुज्झ, तुट्ट, नस्स</strong>&amp;c.; and the seventh has preserved its <strong>न्</strong> in <strong>रुन्ध</strong> and others. But you will see that to these forms <strong>अ</strong>is added and they are made roots ending in <strong>अ</strong>; while a greatmany have lost even such traces. In the Pali, you will remember,the conjugational signs added to some of the roots are entire, asthe <strong>ना</strong>of the sixth and the <strong>नो</strong>of the fifth, and <strong>अ</strong> is appended toroots of the seventh conjugation only, <strong>न्</strong> being inserted before thethe last consonant. But here the at takes the place of the endingvowel of the signs of the fifth and other conjugation also, so wehave <strong>सुण, कीण</strong>, and <strong>बीह</strong>.</p>
<p>Thus in the Prakrit most roots end in <strong>अ</strong>. There are some endingin other vowels, such as <strong>हो</strong>and <strong>ठा</strong>, but the rule of conjugation isthe same for all, viz., to add the terminations to the root directly.There can be no consonantal root. Some forms, such as those of<strong>अम्</strong>, have come down from the parent language only phoneticallychanged; but these are not formed in the Prakrit. They are reallySanskrit forms in what I have ventured to call a petrified condition. The roots ending in <strong>अ</strong>change it to optionally, <em>i. e</em>. theyare conjugated according to the model of the first and of the tenth,as is the case to a great extent in the Pali also. The distinctionbetween the special and the general tenses is of course forgotten.</p>
<p>The Prakrits have retained the Present and Future tenses andthe Imperative mood entire; while the Potential and the Aoristhave left the third person singular only. An isolated form ofthe Imperfect such as <strong>आसि</strong> from the root <strong>अस्</strong>remains.</p>
<p>The terminations of the Present Tense are— 3rd pers. sing. <strong>दि</strong>and <strong>दे</strong> in Śaur. and <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>ए</strong> in the principal Prakrit, pl. <strong>न्ति</strong>and <strong>न्ते</strong>;2nd pers. sing. <strong>सि</strong>and <strong>से</strong>, pl. <strong>इत्था</strong>and <strong>ह</strong> for which last the Śaur.has <strong>ध</strong>; 1st pers. sing. <strong>मि</strong>, pl. <strong>मो, मु</strong>, and <strong>म</strong>.</p>
<p>Of these <strong>दे</strong>, or <strong>ए, से,</strong> and <strong>न्ते</strong>, of which the last is not given by</p>
<p>Vararuci, are remnants of the old Ātmanepada, and the firsttwo are used after roots ending in <strong>अ</strong> only. With the exceptionof the first pers. pl. <strong>म</strong>and the 2nd pers. pl. <strong>इत्था</strong>, the terminationscan readily be traced to the corresponding Skr. Parasm. TheSanskrit 2nd pers. pl. <strong>थ</strong>becomes <strong>ध</strong> in the Śaurasenīand <strong>ह</strong> in theMahārāṣṭrīby the phonetic rules already noticed, and <strong>मो</strong>or itsshortened form <strong>मु</strong> is the Skr. <strong>मम्</strong>. In these points the primitiveand derived languages perfectly agree; but <strong>म</strong> and <strong>इत्था</strong> are newterminations and were first used in Pali, the latter however in theform of <strong>त्थ</strong>. The first is, as I have observed, transferred from theImperative and other tensos, and <strong>त्थ</strong> is the Skr. <strong>स्थ</strong> 2nd pers. pl. ofroot <strong>अस्</strong>. To this is prefixed in the Prakrit the usual augment <strong>इ</strong>,which <strong>मो</strong> and <strong>मु</strong> also take optionally. The terminations <strong>मो</strong> and <strong>मु</strong>are unknown to the Pali.</p>
<p>Other forms of the first pors. sing. and pl., made up by adding<strong>म्हि</strong> and <strong>म्ह</strong> or <strong>म्हो</strong>, as in <strong>करोम्हि, करेम्ह, गच्छम्ह</strong> &amp;c., ocour in theplays, though the grammarians have not noticed them. Theseterminations are evidently the Skr. <strong>स्मि</strong>, 1st pers. sing., and <strong>स्मः</strong> or <strong>स्म</strong>,pl. of <strong>अस्</strong>¹. You will remember that a good many verbs aremade up in the Pali by adding forms of this root. Hemacandranotices also another termination of the 3rd pers. pl. <em>viz</em>. <strong>इरे</strong>, whichis transferred from the Perfect.</p>
<p>The Imperative forms are made up by adding <strong>दु</strong> Śaur. <strong>उ</strong>Prakrit, 3rd pers. sing., and <strong>न्तु</strong> pl.; <strong>सु</strong> and <strong>हि</strong> 2nd pers. sing. and <strong>ध</strong>Śaur., <strong>इ</strong> Prakrit, pl.: and <strong>मु</strong> 1st pers. sing. and <strong>मो</strong> pl. The originalform of the root ending in <strong>अ</strong> is also used as the second pers. sing.Of these <strong>टु, न्तु, हि</strong> or अand <strong>सु</strong> from स्व Ātm. are both Skr. and Pali;<strong>ह</strong> (Skr. <strong>थ</strong>) transferred from the Present is used in Pali; but <strong>मु</strong> and<strong>मो</strong> are peculiar to the Prakrit, the Pali using only the termination of its present. Of these <strong>मो</strong> istransferred from the PrakritPresent, and <strong>मु</strong> is made up by adding the <strong>उ</strong> which is peculiar tothe Imperative and distinguishes it from the present. The firstpers. pl. takes <strong>म</strong> also sometimes as in the Pali, but it is not noticedby the grammarians.</p>

Prof. Lassen traces these to the root <strong>अस्</strong>, but <strong>इत्था</strong> to the Skr. <strong>थ</strong> to which<strong>त्</strong> is, he says, prefixed because the previous vowel must have been pronounced with some accent. But considering that many forms of <strong>अस्</strong>are used asterminations it is more natural to take this also as such a form.</p>
<p>The consciousness that the future is made up by prefixing <strong>स्य = स्स</strong>Pr. &amp; Pali to the terminations of the present has never beenlost, and whatever changes these terminations undergo are transferred to the future; so that the Śaurasenīand Māgadhī futurediffers from the Pali in those respects only in which the Presenttenses of the two differ. The <strong>मि</strong> of the first person sing., however,is optionally changed to an anusvāra; or the anusvära may be aremnant of the conditional terminations; as <strong>हसिस्सं</strong>.In the prineipal Prakrit the <strong>स्य</strong> is still further corrupted to <strong>हि, य</strong> being dissolved into <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>स्</strong>changed to <strong>ह</strong>, as in <strong>होहिह</strong>for <strong>भविष्यति, होहिन्ति, भविष्यन्ति</strong>, &amp;c. In the first pers. we have, in addition to this <strong>हि, स्स</strong> which is lengthened as in Skr. and also its other form <strong>हा</strong>aswell as <strong>स्सं</strong> for the whole as in the Śaurasenī, <em>i e.</em>, <strong>होहि-स्सा-हामि</strong>or <strong>होहिस्सं</strong>, &amp;c. A beginning in the direction of the <strong>हि</strong>was, youwill remember, made in Pali. We have also a few petrified Skr.forms such as <strong>दच्छं</strong> for <strong>द्रक्ष्यामि मोच्छं</strong> for <strong>मोक्ष्यामि</strong> which are more conditional than future in their origin; and to these as bases, areadded the terminations of the present and also of the future toform new futures: as <strong>दच्छिइ दच्छिहिइ</strong>, &amp;c. We have also <strong>काहे</strong>and <strong>दाहं</strong>from <strong>कृ</strong>and <strong>दा</strong>.</p>
<p>The only Potential form left is that of the 3rd pers. sing.; as <strong>हसेज्ज</strong>or <strong>हसेज्जा, होज्ज</strong>or <strong>होज्जा</strong>. The termination is the same as in Pali, the<strong>य्य</strong> of the 3rd pers. sing. being altered to <strong>ज</strong>, and the general formof the termination <strong>य्या</strong> to <strong>ज्जा</strong>. After bases ending in <strong>अ, ज्ज</strong> or <strong>ज्जा</strong>becomes <strong>एज्ज</strong>or <strong>एज्जा</strong>, as in skr. and Pali¹. This being an isolatedform and derived from the Potential, which does not signify anyparticular time, it is used in the sense of the Present, Future, orImperative in all numbers and persons; and after roots in <strong>अ</strong> theterminations <strong>सु</strong> and <strong>हि</strong>of the second pers. sing. of the Imperativeare added to to <strong>ज्ज</strong> make up new forms of that mood, as <strong>हसेज्जसु, हसेज्जहि</strong>; and another form <strong>हसेज्जे</strong> is also mentioned². This Potentialform of roots ending in vowels other than is used as a base,and the terminations of the two tenses and one mood are attachedto it to make up now forms for them as <strong>होज्जइ, होज्जाइ होज्जउ,होजाउ</strong>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1. This fact strongly supports my derivation of the forms. Prof. Lassenderives them from the Precative. But the Precative was lost at an earlystage, since it does not exist even in the Pall. The <strong>ए</strong> is not the <strong>अय</strong>of the10th conj, as the Prof. thinks, but the <strong>ए</strong>, which bases ending in <strong>अ</strong>take inthe Pot. in Skr.</p>
<p>2. Prof. Lassen derives these also from the Precative, and against theargument that that mood is rarely used in Skr. itself and was lost in thePali states that the Precative is found in the Vernaculars. But I have notfound it. The forms <strong>करजे, करजी</strong> G.‚<strong>करिये, कंरियो</strong> H.IItrace to the PrakritPotential forms spoken of above.</p>
<p>The Aorist also has left its 3rd pers. sing. only; the termination to be added to roots ending in a vowel, is <strong>सी, ही</strong>, or <strong>हीअ</strong> and<strong>ईअ</strong> to those ending in a consonant or <strong>अ</strong>, <em>i. e.</em>, such as take theaugment <strong>इ</strong> or change the <strong>अ</strong>to <strong>इ</strong>. Of these, <strong>सी</strong>and <strong>ही</strong> are derivedfrom the Parasm. <strong>सीत्</strong>of the fourth form; the first is found inPali, and <strong>ही</strong> is only another form of it. The Pali has <strong>ई</strong> also forthe 3rd pers. sing. corresponding to the <strong>ईत्</strong>affixed to Sanskritroots that take the augment <strong>इ</strong>. This is very likely the origin of<strong>ईअ</strong> also, since we have it after the roots which necessarily admitthe augment; but the <strong>अ</strong>of this and of <strong>हीअ</strong>is difficult to explain.<strong>हीअ</strong>must correspond to some such form as <strong>सीय</strong> or <strong>सीत</strong> which, the<strong>म्</strong> being dropped after the augment <strong>इ</strong>, is reduced to <strong>ईअ</strong>. These<strong>सीय</strong> and <strong>सीत</strong> are forms of the Potential Ātm. of <strong>अम्</strong>, and they mayhave been added as terminations to form the Aorist as otherforms of <strong>अस्</strong>are in this and other tenses in the Pali. Or the <strong>सी</strong>of the Aorist may have been confounded with <strong>सीत</strong>the pot. of <strong>अम्</strong>from its resemblance to it.</p>
<p>These are rare and isolated forms, and past time is mostlyexpressed by the past participle passive which in the case ofintransitive and some transitive verbs has also an active sense.The Sanskrit termination <strong>त</strong>is only phonetically changed to <strong>द</strong>inthe ŚaurasenĀand to <strong>अ</strong> in the Prakrit. Roots ending in <strong>अ</strong>changeit to <strong>इ</strong> before the past participial termination. The past participlesof some roots are not newly formed, but the old Skr. forms havecome down only phonetically altered. This fact should alwaysbe remembered, that there are in all these derived dialects newformations called by Hemacandra <strong>साध्यावस्थ</strong>, as well as old formations, <strong>सिद्धावस्थ</strong>. This arises from the fact of the analogies notbeing made applicable throughout, as they would have been ifthe languages had been artificial Contingency or condition isexpressed by the present participle, as we do in our modernvernaculars.</p>
<p>The infinitive is formed as in Skr. by the addition of
<strong>तुम्</strong>changed to <strong>उं</strong>, the Pali <strong>तवे</strong>being lost, and the absolutive by affixingthe termination <strong>ऊण</strong> (<strong>दूण</strong> Śaurasenī) from the Pali <strong>तू</strong>and theVedic <strong>त्वान</strong>or <strong>त्वीन</strong>. But the termination that is most used in theŚaurasenīis <strong>इअ</strong>from the Sanskrit <strong>य</strong> of roots with prepositionsprefixed. Hemacandra also gives for the principal Prakrit <strong>तूण</strong>and <strong>तुआण</strong>, the origin of which is the same as that of <strong>ऊण, त्ता</strong>from<strong>त्वा, तु,</strong> by the dissolution of the semi-vowel of <strong>त्वा, तुम्,</strong> by a confusion with the infinitive, and <strong>इअ</strong>which is used in the Śaurasenī.Of these, however, <strong>ऊण</strong>is the one that prevails; the others are rare.</p>
<p>The passive is formed by adding <strong>ईय</strong> and <strong>इज्ज</strong>,both of whichcome from the Sanskrit with the augment <strong>इ</strong>prefixed as in Pali, the <strong>य</strong>being transformed to <strong>ज्ज</strong> in one case and leaving its <strong>अ</strong> onlyin the other or being dissolved into <strong>इअ</strong>. Hemacandra gives agood many roots which preserve the Skr. forms, only phoneticallychanged as <strong>दीसइ</strong> from <strong>दृश्यते, वुच्चइ</strong>from <strong>उच्यते, गम्मइ</strong> from <strong>गम्यतेलब्भइ</strong>from <strong>लभ्यते, बज्झइfrom बध्यते</strong> &amp;c.</p>
<p>The causol terminations are <strong>ए</strong> from <strong>अय</strong>and <strong>आवे</strong>from <strong>आपय</strong>.These two are the same as in the Pali, the Sanskrit forms, alsoexisting in the latter, being lost. Hemacandra adds <strong>अ</strong>and <strong>आव</strong>,<em>i. e</em>., the <strong>ए</strong>, answering to <strong>अय</strong>, is lost. But the Sanskrit vowelchanges are preserved even when the <strong>अय</strong> gives place to <strong>अ</strong>; as<strong>दरिसइ</strong>.</p>
<p>The terminations of the absolutive, the infinitive, the potentialparticiple ( <strong>अव्व</strong> from Skr. <strong>तव्य</strong>), and of the Future take theaugment <strong>इ</strong> which also is transformed into a short <strong>ए</strong>of the samenature as that which is found before conjunct consonants, as in <strong>पेण्ड</strong>or <strong>पिण्ड</strong>. We have thus <strong>हसिऊण</strong> or<strong>इसेऊण, हसिडं</strong> or <strong>हसेउं</strong>&amp;c.</p>
<p>You will thus have observed a much greater progress in theoperation of those principles, which we found at work in theconstruction of the Pali. Here as before we find that the lessknown forms are made up on the model of the more known. Thenumber of old forms which still remained in some of the Palideclensions and conjugations, has been greatly reduced in thePrakrits, and a further advance been made in the introductionof uniformity and simplicity in the grammar of the language.</p>
<p>It is also worthy of remark, that in a great measure, the samefalse analogies which are used in the Pali have come down tothe Prakrit, and their range extended. Thus the analogy ofnouns in <strong>इन्</strong> or neuter nouns in <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>उ</strong> has been carried muchfurther in the declension of masculine nouns ending in <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>उ</strong>.Nouns in <strong>ऋ, अन्</strong> and <strong>वत्</strong> have adapted themselves more closely tothe model of those ending in <strong>अ</strong>, their Sanskrit nom. casesupplying the new <strong>अ</strong>base; and the <strong>अ</strong> conjugations have moregenerally prevailed over the rest. The device of using such caseforms as <strong>मम</strong>and <strong>मह्यम्</strong> as bases, and making up the cases byappending the proper terminations has also been more largelyavailed of. Some of these phenomena may be attributed to theoperation of the same invariable laws in the development ofeither, without being an index to a more intimate connectionbetween the two dialects. But there are individual forms in thetwo languages which, though they might be different, are yet thesame in both. Such, for instance, are <strong>वच्छे</strong> acc. pl., the loc. sing.ending in the pronominal <strong>म्हि</strong> or <strong>म्मि</strong>, the double gen. <strong>तिस्साय</strong>, the2nd pers. pl. ending in <strong>इत्था</strong>of the present tense, and a good manyothers. The consonantal and vowel changes also, so far as theygo in the older language, are the same. We may therefore safelyconclude that the Pali represents generally an earlier stage of thesame language which afterwards became the Prakrit or Prakrits.</p>
<p>But there are again in the Prakrits such forms as those of theablative in <strong>दो</strong> and <strong>आहि</strong> instead of the old pronominal <strong>म्हा</strong>, the firstpers. pl. of the Pres. in <strong>मो</strong>or <strong>मु</strong> instead of the Pali <strong>म</strong>, the 1st pers.sing. of the Imperative in <strong>मु</strong>instead of the Pali <strong>मि</strong>, the Śaurasenīabsolutive in <strong>इअ</strong>corresponding to the Sanskrit <strong>य</strong>, which does notexist in the older dialect, and others. These Prakrit forms cannothave been developed out of the Pali forms, but must have grownindependently from the Sanskrit originals.</p>
<p>In the same way, though the Prakrit sounds are generallythe same as, or further developments, of the Pali sounds, thereare a good many which could not have grown out of the latter.Thus the <strong>रि</strong> of the Prakrit words <strong>रिद्धि, रिच्छ, रिण, रिजु</strong>, &amp;c. cannothave been developed out of the <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>अ</strong> of the Pali <strong>इद्धि, अच्छ, अण,उजू</strong> &amp;c, or the <strong>अइ</strong> and <strong>अउ</strong>of such words as <strong>दइच्च, भइरव, पउर कउसल</strong>,</p>
<p>&amp;c., from the <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong>of the corresponding Pali words, or the<strong>ण्ण्</strong> for Sanskrit <strong>ज्ञ्</strong>from the Pali <strong>ञ्ञ्</strong>, though this latter exista insome of the Prakrit dialects, or the <strong>रिस</strong>for <strong>र्श</strong> or र्ष in such wordsas<strong>आअरिस सुदरिसण वरिसे</strong>, and <strong>परामरिस</strong> from the <strong>स्स</strong> or <strong>स</strong> of the Pali<strong>आदास, सुदस्सन, वस्स</strong>, and <strong>परामस</strong>. The Prakrit sounds must in thesecases be traced directly to the corresponding Sanskrit sounds.</p>
<p>It therefore appears that the Prakrits had also an independentdevelopment, which may be accounted for on the supposition,that they sprang not from the Pali but a sister dialect or dialects;or that, though originally they were the same as the Pali, theirsubsequent development was influenced by the parent language,and thus, other sounds and forms not existing in the earlierdialect, came in fresh from Sanskrit. But the first supposition isdiscountenanced by the fact that the resemblance between thePali and the Prakrits extends even to isolated cases; and thesecond is supported by the circumstance that in one importantparticular, the Prakrits resemble the Sanskrit in the last stage ofits development, while the Pali differs in that particular fromboth and agrees with an earlier form of the parent language.We have seen that in later Sanskrit verbal forms, especially ofthe past tenses were rarely used, and participles were employedinstead; and we find that the Prakrits have mostly lost all theSanskrit tenses and moods except three, and past time is generallyexpressed by the past participle and contingency by the present;while the Pali has, as we have seen, preserved eight, includingall the past tenses and the conditional. Middle Sanskrit bearsto later or Classical Sanskrit the same relation, in this respect,that the Pali bears to the Prakrits. The change that came overSanskrit between the two periods left its impress on what maybe called the Vernacular speech. This could not have been thecase, unless Sanskrit had continued to influence that form ofspeech, represented first by the Pali and afterwards by thePrakrits. And it was because it continued so to influence it,that the Prakrits came to have sounds and grammatical formsalso derived direct from Sanskrit and not through the Pali. Thisleads to the conclusion, which will be developed in detail in thelast lecture, that when the Pali and the Prakrits came into existence, Sanskrit had not been dead but was as much a living</p>
<p>language as either of the other two, and both were spoken orused for ordinary purposes, one by men of culture and the otherby ordinary people.</p>
<p>Sanskrit writers distinguish three elements in the Prakritvocabulary which they call Tadbhava, Tatsama, and Deśya.Such words as are derived from Sanskrit are called Tadbhavasuch as<strong>दसण, फस, मग्ग, कण्ण</strong>, &amp;c. Tatsamas are those that arethe same in Sanskrit and Prakrit as <strong>कमल, मण्डल</strong>, &amp;c., the phoneticlaws of the Prakrits not necessitating a change in them, andDeśyas are such as cannot be derived from Sanskrit and mustbe referred to another source. A good many words of this naturewe find used in Prakrit literature; and there exists a kośa orthesaurus of Deśya words by Hemacandra. A large number ofthese Deśya words exist in the modern vernaculars, such as:—</p>
<p>** अक्का** a sister, M., आका<sup id="fnref:131"><a href="#fn:131" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">131</a></sup>,a term of honour used for an elder sister.</p>
<p>** अग्घाडो**an herb; M. <strong>आघाडा.</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>अवडो</strong> awell; M. <strong>आड</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>उडिद</strong>a kind of pulse; M. H. the same.</p>
<p><strong>उङ्घइ</strong>sleeps; H. <strong>उंघना</strong> G. <strong>उंघवुं</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>कुडं, कु़ड्डं, कोड्डं</strong>, wonder; M. <strong>कोड</strong> old.</p>
<p><strong>कोट्टं</strong> a town M, <strong>कोट</strong> a fort.</p>
<p><strong>कोडिम्बो</strong> a basin of wood for water; M. <strong>कोठंबा</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>कोलित्त</strong> a firebrand; M. <strong>कोलित</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>कल्लविअं</strong> to mix a liquid with a solid substance and stir it up;M. <strong>कालवर्णे</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>गोहो</strong> a man, a warrior; M. <strong>घोव</strong> husband.</p>
<p><strong>चोप्पडइ</strong> a man, a warrior; M. <strong>घोव</strong> husband.</p>
<p><strong>चोप्पडइ</strong> rubs, anoints; M. <strong>चोपडणें</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>छिण्णो</strong></p>
<p><strong>छिण्णी</strong>       an adulterer or adulteress; M. <strong>शिदल</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>छिण्णालो</strong></p>
<p>** छिण्णाली**</p>
<p><strong>पोआलो</strong> an ox; M. <strong>पोल</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>पडच्छी</strong>a cow that has no milk; M. <strong>पाउशी</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>पासल्लं</strong> slanting; M. <strong>पासलें</strong>lying down with the face upwards.</p>
<p><strong>पोट्टं</strong> belly; M. <strong>पोट</strong>, H.G. पेट.</p>
<p><strong>फसइ</strong>deceives; M. <strong>फसविणें</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>फुक्का</strong>false, vain; M. <strong>फुका</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>बाउल्ली</strong>adoll; M. <strong>बाउली</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>बप्पो</strong> father, a brave man: M. H. G. <strong>बाप</strong>, M. <strong>बाप्या</strong>an able-bodied man.</p>
<p>There are a great many words set down as Deśyas, which onclose examination will be found to be Tadbhavas. They differfrom ordinary Tadbhavas in having undergone great corruption.The following are instances. Some of the words in the above list.<strong>may also</strong> be considered to be of the same nature. Thus <strong>फंसइ</strong>&lsquo;deceives&rsquo; is a denominative or nominal verb from the word <strong>पाश</strong>&lsquo;asnare&rsquo;;which in our modern dialects has the form of <strong>फोस</strong>; whence<strong>फंसई</strong> is &rsquo;to ensnare&rsquo; or &rsquo;entrap.&rsquo; So also <strong>कुडं, कुड्डं, कोड्डुं</strong>, and the old M.<strong>कोइ</strong> are in all likelihood to be traced to the Skr. <strong>कौतुक</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>उब्बड्डिओ</strong>thrown upwards; Skr. <strong>उइर्तिल</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>कन्दोठ्ठ</strong> alotus; from Skr. <strong>कन्दोत्थ</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>कुद्रुडो</strong> humpbacked. This may be traced to Skr. **कुब्ज-कुम्भ-कुह;**and <strong>ङ</strong> is a termination which is used in a great many nouns.</p>
<p><strong>कुरुच्च</strong> disliked, evidently from Skr. <strong>कु</strong> and <strong>रोच्य</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>कोणी</strong> black; Skr, <strong>कृष्ण-कण्ड-कोण्ह-कोण</strong>,</p>
<p><strong>उज्जह</strong>desolate; from Skr. <strong>उज्ज्वल</strong> bright, pure, cleared of everything, desolate.</p>
<p><strong>बइल्ल</strong> a bullock; from Skr. <strong>बलीवर्द</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>छल्ली</strong> rind, bark; may be from Skr. <strong>शल्य, शल्यक</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>छासी</strong> whey may be from Skr. <strong>तक्र</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>छिवइ</strong>touches; from <strong>छुप्</strong>by a change of vowel.</p>
<p><strong>छिप्प</strong> a tail; from Skr. <strong>पुच्छ</strong> by the consonants interchangingplaces, and the palatal <strong>छ</strong> having its vowel <strong>इ</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>पडोहर</strong> the hind part of a house; from Skr. <strong>पृष्ठगृह</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>पेयालं, पेज्जल</strong>,a measure, a certain quantity, occurs in the Pali andis traced to Skr. <strong>प्राय</strong>. It may also be connected with <strong>प्राज्य</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>बोल्लइ</strong> speaks; from Skr. <strong>ब्रू</strong> by the change of <strong>र्</strong> to <strong>ल्</strong> and thetransference of the vowel to the first consonant—athing oftenobservable; <strong>ब्लू-बुल्ल-बोल्ल</strong>.</p>
<p>The Sanskrit etymology of some of the words given by thelexicographers is evident; and one does not know how they cameto be regarded as Deśyas. Other words changed their sense inthe course of time and so were referred to this class.</p>
<p><strong>पम्हुसइ</strong> forgets; from Skr. <strong>प्रमुष</strong>to steal,—a thing forgotten is asit were stolen.</p>
<p><strong>बहुमुहो</strong> a wicked person:from Skr. <strong>बहुसुख</strong>, because a wickedperson puts on many faces or appearances.</p>
<p><strong>कामकिसोरो</strong> an ass; — a son of Kāma or love, devoted to pleasure,is often a donkey.</p>
<p><strong>कुच्छिमई</strong>pregnant; Skr. <strong>कुक्षि</strong> originally &lsquo;side&rsquo;, came to signify&rsquo;womb,&rsquo; and that womb is worthy of the name which bears achild, hence <strong>कुक्षिमती</strong><em>lit</em>&lsquo;having a womb&rsquo; came to have the signification given.</p>
<p>A good many of the words given by Hemacandra do not occurin the modern Vernaculars, and we have regular Tadbhavas instead; as., <strong>इल्ली</strong>a tiger, <strong>ईसु</strong>a nail, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The number of Deśya words, if properly examined, would begreatly reduced. Still a Deśīelement in the Prakrits and theVernaculars must be admitted. These words must have comeinto the dialects from the language of the aborigines whom theĀryas conquered; and some are found in Sanskrit also.</p>
<p><strong>THE APABHRAṀŚA</strong></p>
<p>The dialect called the Apabhraṁśa by the grammarians presents Indian speech in a further stage of decay, and occupies &amp;middle position between the Prakrit and the modern vernaculars,to some of which, especially to the old Hindi, the Brajabhäsä, andthe Gujarati, it bears striking resemblances, as I shall hereaftershow.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, we have the grammar of this dialect fromHemacandra, Trivikrama, and Kramadīśvara; but Vararuci doesnot mention it. The Apabhraṁśa had a literature of its own.Hemacandra illustrates each of his rules about this dialect byquoting a verse. In the fourth Act of the Vikramorvaśīthe Prakritspeeches of the king in his madness are in this dialect. But it isa question whether they existed there originally, since in several</p>
<p>manuscripts on this side of India they do not appear. The metresemployed in these and in Hemacandra&rsquo;s quotations are the sameas those popularly used in old and modern Hindi or Braj via, <em>dahā</em>or <em>copai.</em> Pandit Vrajalal mentions a work of the name of Muñjarāsa, written in the Apabhraṁśa, from which he gives a shortextract, and another the hero of which is a king of the name ofPrasenajita. He also quotes from another work; but the languageof all those appears to be more modern than Hemacandra&rsquo;s Apabhraṁśa, and that of some of the verses makes a very near approachto the Gujarati. As before, I will introduce my remarks on thisdialect by a specimen.—</p>

<p>&ldquo;He who dies after having gone to the Gaṅgāand to Śivatīrtha, triumphs over the power (world) of death and sports in thehabitation of the gods.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>THE PHONOLOGY OF THE APABHRAṀŚA</strong></p>
<p>The vowel of the derivatives of the pronouns <strong>पद्, तद्, किम्,<strong>and <strong>इदम्</strong> is changed to <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>ए</strong>. In the principal Prikrit we havenoticed a tendency to such a change, and one of our instanceswas <strong>एत्थ</strong>for <strong>अत्र</strong>. From the same tendency we have in the Apabhraṁśa <strong>जेत्यु</strong>for <strong>यत्र,</strong> <strong>तेत्थु</strong>for <strong>तत्र</strong>, and <strong>केत्थु</strong>for <strong>कुत्र</strong>, the <strong>उ</strong> of the latterbeing replaced by <strong>ए</strong>in virtue of the analogy of the other pronouns.In the same way <strong>तद्वत्</strong> &ldquo;in that manner,&rdquo; which aftor dropping thefinal consonant becomes <strong>तङ्</strong>, is changed to <strong>तेम</strong>, <strong>यद्वत्</strong> to <strong>जेम</strong>, and</strong>किम्वत्</strong> to <strong>केम</strong>. This <strong>ए</strong> is also rendered a more close vowel andchanged to <strong>इ</strong>, and thus we have <strong>तिम, जिम,</strong> and <strong>किम</strong>. Thus the basesof these pronouns came to be considered as <strong>ते</strong> or <strong>ति, जे</strong> or <strong>जि</strong>, and<strong>के</strong>, or <strong>कि</strong>, and so we have <strong>तिध</strong>for <strong>तथा जिध</strong>for <strong>यथा</strong> and <strong>किंध</strong> for <strong>कथम्</strong>.The mute element being dropped, these forms become <strong>तिह, जिह</strong>, and <strong>किह</strong>, and further <strong>तेहु, जेहु</strong>and <strong>केहु</strong>. For similar reasons wehave <strong>तेत्तिज</strong> or <strong>तित्तिअ</strong> for <strong>तावत्क, जेत्तिअं</strong> or <strong>जित्तिअ</strong> for <strong>यावक, केत्तिअ</strong> or<strong>कित्तिअ</strong>for <strong>किपत्क</strong>, &amp;c. even in the Prakrits.</p>
<p>The nom. sing. termination of nouns <strong>अ</strong> in is shortened to <strong>उ</strong>,and since a great many nouns were pronounced with this final <strong>उ</strong>and its original sense was forgotten, it was transferred by way ofanalogy to other words or grammatical forms that did not possess</p>
<p>it before and thus we have <strong>पुणु</strong> and <strong>बिणु</strong> for <strong>पुनः</strong> and <strong>विना</strong> and <strong>जेत्यु,तेत्थु, जेहु</strong>, &amp;c., in the above.</p>
<p>The long vowels are sometimes shortened as in the word <strong>गङ्गा</strong>in the last of the above verses.</p>
<p>The consonants <strong>क्</strong> and <strong>ख्</strong> are sometimes softened to <strong>ग्</strong> and <strong>घ्</strong>instead of being dropped, <strong>त्</strong> and <strong>थ्</strong> to <strong>द्</strong> and <strong>ध्</strong>, as in Sauraseni,and <strong>प्</strong> and <strong>फ्</strong>, to <strong>ह्</strong> and <strong>भ</strong>. In the principal Prakrit also this issometimes the case. The labial <strong>ब्</strong> is changed to <strong>म्</strong> in a few moreinstances than in the Prakrits as in <strong>जाम</strong> and <strong>नाम</strong> for <strong>यावत्</strong> and<strong>तावत्</strong>, and <strong>जेम</strong> or <strong>जिम, तेम</strong> or <strong>तिम,</strong> &amp;o. in the above for <strong>यद्वत्, तद्वत्</strong> &amp;e.The complete contact of the lips necessary for the pronunciationof <strong>म्</strong> is avoided in a great many cases, and thus we have <strong>ञ्</strong> for <strong>म्</strong>as in <strong>भवँरु</strong> for <strong>भ्रमर, कवँलु</strong> for <strong>कमल</strong>, &amp;o This is the prevailing rulein most of the vernaculars, as we shall hereafter find. The conjunct <strong>म्ह्</strong>is changed to <strong>म्भ्</strong>, that is, the aspirate <strong>ह्</strong>has been labialized and assimilated to the preceding <strong>म्</strong>, as in f for Prakrit <strong>गिम्ह</strong>and Sanskrit <strong>ग्रीष्म</strong>. A few instances of this change we didfind in the Prakrits and we shall find more in the vernaculars.</p>
<p>The Sanskrit conjunct <strong>त्व्</strong> is changed to <strong>प्प्</strong>; for as <strong>त्</strong> was oftenpronounced as <strong>ग्</strong>, this <strong>ग्</strong> instead of merging into the precedingmute, as semi-vowels often do, acquired prominence as <strong>त्</strong> does,when preceded by a dental; and the being assimilated to it,the whole become <strong>प्प्</strong> as <strong>त्य्</strong>becomes <strong>च्च</strong>, as in <strong>पइ</strong>for <strong>त्वया, प्पण</strong> or <strong>पण</strong>for the abstract termination <strong>त्वन</strong>, and <strong>प्पिण</strong> for <strong>त्वीन्,</strong> the suffix ofthe absolutive. In the Prakrits the <strong>त्म</strong>of <strong>आत्मन्</strong>similarly becomes<strong>प्प</strong> and so we have <strong>अप्पा</strong> for <strong>आत्मा</strong>.The letter <strong>र्</strong>, when the lattermember of a conjunct, is sometimes not assimilated, as in <strong>त्रोप्पि,प्राउ</strong> for <strong>प्रायः</strong>, &amp;c., and sometimes it is introduced even when itdoes not exist in the original, as in <strong>धुं</strong>for <strong>तद्, प्रस्स</strong> for <strong>परस</strong>, &amp;c.With these few exceptions, the rules about the assimilation ofconjuncts, the elision of consonants, and others hold good.generally as in the Prakrits, as you will see from the above extract.</p>
<p><strong>DECLENSION IN THE APABHRAṀŚA</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nouns in अ</strong></p>
<p>The decay of the case terminations is, however, a distinguishing feature of thisdialect. The distinction between the nom.and</p>
<p>acc. case forms which we observed lessening at each stage in thegrowth of our languages is here altogether lost. The <strong>ओ</strong>of thenom. sing. of masculinenouns in <strong>अ</strong>is shortened to <strong>उ</strong>, and used inboth the cases, as <strong>मुअउ</strong>nom. for <strong>मृतकः</strong>, <strong>गड</strong> for <strong>गतः जमलोड</strong> for<strong>एमलोकम्</strong>; and applied to neuter nouns as well, as <strong>कमलु</strong>. The nasalof the neuter is preserved only in nouns which are augmented bythe addition of <strong>क</strong> changed to <strong>अ</strong>, as<strong>कमलउं</strong>for <strong>कमलकम्</strong>. The nom.and acc. pl. of the masculine ends in <strong>आ</strong>; as <strong>दिअहडा, पयडा</strong> &amp;c. inthe above. The neuter nouns preserve the Prakrits <strong>इं</strong> of the pluralas in <strong>कमलइं</strong>. Sometimes words are used in these two caseswithout any terminations; as <strong>विसंदुल</strong>nom. sing., <strong>निच्चल</strong>nom. sing.,<strong>गुण</strong> acc. pl., <strong>गङ्ग</strong> acc. sing., <strong>तित्थ</strong>acc. sing., in the above extract.</p>
<p>The principle observable in the other cases is the same as wehave noticed in the older dialects, viz., a gradual reduction of allthe declensions to a uniformity. The instrumental singular ofnouns in <strong>अ</strong>has two forms, one in <strong>एं</strong> as <strong>देवें</strong>, and the other the oldone <strong>देवेण</strong>. The former is derived from this old form, the final <strong>अ</strong>being dropped, and the nasal assuming the form of an anusvāra.This new termination is transferred to nouns in <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>उ</strong> also, asअग्गिएं. The instrumental pl. is the old one in <strong>हिं</strong>, but the changeof the ending vowel to <strong>ए</strong>is only optionally made; as <strong>गुणेहिं</strong>or<strong>गुणहिं</strong>.</p>
<p>One ablative termination is <strong>हे</strong>which is appended to all nouns,and the other <strong>हु</strong> asin <strong>बच्छहेगुण्हईफलई</strong> or <strong>वच्छहु गृण्हइ</strong>, “gathersfruits from trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course we may trace the first to <strong>हिन्तो</strong>by supposing it firstto be changed to <strong>हेन्तो</strong> by the usual Prakrit rule, and afterwards tohave dropped its second syllable; and to something else. Butit appears to me that a good many of the terminations havingbeen reduced to <strong>ह्</strong>by natural phonetic changes, the others alsohad this inserted in them by analogy, just as the nominativetermination <strong>उ</strong>is introduced in words and forms in which it did. not exist. This process we shall necessarily have to suppose whenwe examine the forms of the present tense. Or the <strong>ह्</strong> may havebeen introduced simply to prevent a histus and connect thevowel-termination with the base. And this is rendered probableby Hemacandra&rsquo;s rule, that the ending syllables <strong>उं, हं, हिं,</strong> and <strong>हं</strong>,are to be lightly pronounced, as the <strong>ए</strong> that is introduced in the</p>
<p>place of a dropped consonant is. The real syllables in these casesare therefore **अं, उं, इं,**and <strong>अं</strong>; and this is confirmed by the factthat the remnants of these Apabhraṁśa terminations existing insome of the modern vernaculars are destitute of this <strong>ह्</strong> and aremere vowel-terminations, as will be seen in a subsequent lecture. Thus, then, <strong>हे</strong> may be considered as the aspirated form of the <strong>ए</strong> ofthe Prakrit feminine ablative, and <strong>हु</strong> of the <strong>उ</strong> of the masculine ablative¹. The operation of the law of false analogies is very wide.The abl. pl. <strong>हुं</strong>, as in <strong>गिरिसिङ्गहुं</strong>, may with Lassen be traced to <strong>सुन्तो</strong>, the <strong>म्</strong> being changed to <strong>ह्</strong> and the syllable <strong>तो</strong> dropped, as <strong>ति</strong>is in the case of the 3rd pers. pl. of the present, as we shall see.</p>
<p>The genitive singular <strong>सु</strong> and <strong>स्सु</strong> as in <strong>सुअणरसु</strong> and <strong>परस्सु</strong> inverse 4 above, I trace to the <strong>स्म</strong> of the Prakrits, the <strong>उ</strong> addedby analogy as observed before. Lassen traces is to <strong>स्व</strong>, which, hesays, must have been added to these nouns to form the genitive;and the being softened to <strong>उ</strong>, it is reduced to <strong>सु</strong>. But this doesnot account for the double <strong>स्स</strong>of the other form; and the additionof such a word as <strong>स्व</strong> to make up a case-form is altogether unexampled. The suffix <strong>हो</strong>, as in <strong>दुल्लहहो</strong>in the same verse, is butanother form of <strong>सु</strong>.The genitive plural <strong>हं</strong>, as in <strong>माणुसहं</strong> for<strong>मनुष्याणाम्</strong>, may with Lassen be derived from the <strong>साम्</strong>of theSanskrit pronominal declension. But the transference of thistermination to nouns is nowhere seen in the Prakrits; <strong>हं</strong> isoptionally appended to nouns in or also; and the characteristic <strong>णं</strong>of the gen. is wanting in this dialect. The more probableexplanation, therefore, is that the <strong>ण</strong> lost its cerebral element andwas reduced merely to a nasal <strong>अ</strong>, or <strong>अ</strong> with an anusvāra, as isthe case in the instrumental singular, and the <strong>ह्</strong> is added, asobserved before, simply to facilitate the pronunciation.</p>
<p>The loc. sing. ends in <strong>ए</strong>, as in <strong>तले</strong>, which we see is the oldtermination, or in <strong>इ</strong>, as in <strong>तलि</strong>, which is a shortened form of <strong>ए</strong>.Kramadīśvara gives also <strong>हिं</strong>which might be traced to the Pali <strong>म्हि</strong>,the Sanskrit <strong>स्मिन्</strong>, or the <strong>स्सिं</strong>of the Prakrit pronominal declension.The language of Jaina works has this <strong>स्सिं</strong>in the case of nounsalso. But even here the Prakrit <strong>स्मि</strong>, may, withreason, besupposed to have changed to <strong>इं</strong>, and the <strong>ह्</strong>to be, as before, a mere<em>spiritus lenis</em>. We have this locative <strong>इं</strong> in the Marathi. The <strong>हिं</strong> isextended to the plural also of these nouns. The vocative is formedby using which is evidently an interjection; as <strong>तरुण हो</strong>&ldquo;O young men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>____________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1**.** Kramadīśvarain Lassan&rsquo;s extract gives <strong>दू</strong>instead of <strong>हु</strong>;but this is anevident misreading.</p>
<p><strong>Nouns in इ or उ</strong></p>
<p>There is no distinction between the nom. and acc. sing. andpl., the original base being used without any modification oraddition.</p>
<p>The instrumental singular is formed by adding <strong>एं</strong> or <strong>ण</strong>, as inthe last class of nouns, or simple anusvāra; as <strong>अग्गिएं, अग्गिण, अग्गिं</strong>,As <strong>एण</strong> becomes <strong>एं</strong>by dropping the final vowel, so does the <strong>इणा</strong> ofthe Prakrit instrumental here become <strong>इं</strong>.</p>
<p>The abl. sing. ends in <strong>हे</strong> as in <strong>गिरिहे</strong> and <strong>तरुहे</strong>; and the gen.sing. also according to Kramadīśvara, Hemacandra being silent.These have been transferred from the feminine. Kramadīśvaraalso gives <strong>हो</strong> and <strong>हं</strong> as the terminations of the sing. of these two.cases; but there must be some misreading here in Lassen&rsquo;sextract from the author, since is a distinctive plural termination. The gen. pl. termination is <strong>हुं</strong> or <strong>हं</strong> as in <strong>तरुहुं, सउणिहं (शकुनीनाम)</strong>.The latter has been traced to the old gen.<strong>ण</strong>, and the formerappears to be only another form of it, with the addition of theusual <strong>उ</strong>.</p>
<p>The loc. sing. has <strong>हि</strong>, as in <strong>कलिहि</strong>; and the pl. has <strong>हिं</strong>and <strong>हुं</strong>, as in <strong>तरुहिं</strong>and <strong>उदुहुं</strong>,.The first must be considered to be the same as fe derivedfrom <strong>स्सिं</strong>or <strong>म्मि</strong>with the anusvāra dropped; or as the <strong>इ</strong> of Prakritfeminine nouns with the <em>spiritus lenis</em> <strong>ह्</strong>. This explanation seemsto be probable, since we have seen other feminine terminationsalso used for the cases of these nouns. The third is to be tracedto the Prakrit <strong>मुं</strong>. Kramadīśvara in Lassen&rsquo;s extract gives <strong>हं</strong> forthe <strong>हुं</strong>of the abl. pl.<strong>हे</strong>, and for that of the gen. pl.; but I have tomake the same remark here as before. The instr, and abl. pluralsare the same as those of nouns in <strong>अ</strong>; as <strong>तरुहिं</strong>and <strong>तरुहुं</strong>. Thus theplural of three cases ends in <strong>हुं</strong> , derived separately of course, andthe plurals of two in <strong>हिं</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Feminine nouns</strong></p>
<p>The plurals of the nom. and acc. of feminine nouns preservethe old <strong>ओ</strong>, or its shortened form <strong>उ</strong>, as in <strong>अङ्गुलिउ जज्जरिआउ</strong> in the</p>
<p>second verse, and <strong>सुन्दरखत्वङ्गाओ विलासिणीओ</strong>. The sing. is theoriginal base, as <strong>जज्जरिआ, विलासिणी</strong> &amp;c.</p>
<p>The instr. sing. termination is <strong>ए</strong>, the old one, as in <strong>ससिमण्डलचन्दिमए, कन्तिए</strong>&amp;o,: the abl is <strong>हे</strong> as in <strong>बालाहे</strong> for <strong>बालायाः</strong>,which is an aspirated <strong>ए</strong>; and the genitive <strong>हे</strong> as in <strong>मुद्धडहे</strong>for <strong>मुग्घायाः</strong> (<strong>ड</strong>being a nominal suffix) may be similarlyexplained or traced to the of the gen. sing. fem. of thepronouns, <strong>किम्, यद्</strong>,and <strong>तद्</strong>, in the Prakrit. I prefer the formerexplanation. This <strong>हे</strong> has been transferred to masculine nouns in<strong>इ</strong> or <strong>उ</strong> as we have seen. The abl. and gen. pl. ends in <strong>हु</strong>, as in<strong>चयसिअहु</strong> for <strong>वपस्याभ्यः</strong> or <strong>वयस्पानाम्</strong>, The anusvāra of the <strong>हु</strong> of theother classes of nouns is here omitted and if correctly so, the <strong>हु</strong>of the abl. may be considered an aspirated form of the <strong>उ</strong>whichis the ablative termination in the Prakrit: and that of thegenitive may be traced to the <strong>सु</strong> of the singular of masculinenouns. The instr. pl. and the loc. sing. and pl. take the sameterminations as masculine nouns in <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>उ</strong>;as <strong>महिर्हि, महिहि</strong>, and<strong>महिहिं तुं</strong>. Lassen gives other terminations; but he appears to menot to have interpreted Kramadīśvara correctly. Those I havegiven are all that I have been able to find.</p>
<p>You will thus see how by the various influences at work, thenatural transformation of <strong>स्</strong>to <strong>ह्</strong>, the elision of some of theelements, and the aspirated pronunciation of the vowels, most ofthe old terminations have been reduced to syllables composed of <strong>ह्</strong>and a vowel with or without an anusvāra. Terminations withsuch weak sounds are not adapted to serve the purposes ofordinary intercourse, since they require on the part of thespeakers such care in pronunciation to render themselves intelligible to each other as we have not seen displayed in the courseof our lingual history. The nominative and accusative throughout, and in certain classes of nouns, the other cases also havecome to have the same forms. So that the purpose of expressingthe different relations can be no longer performed by these poorremnants of the old declensional system; and a process of reconstruction must take place. It has already begun in the Apabhraṁśa; but we shall find it carried on much further in thevernaculars, which may now be said to have completed theirnew declensional system.</p>
<p>The abl. sing. of pronouns ends in <strong>हां</strong>, as <strong>जहां</strong>, &amp;o., which is tobe traced to the Sanskrit <strong>स्मात्</strong>and the Prakrit <strong>म्हा</strong>, and the loc.sing. in <strong>हिं</strong>which has been explained. The gen. sing. of **यद्, तद्,**and <strong>किम्</strong> sre optionally <strong>जासु, तासु,</strong> and <strong>कासु</strong>, made up by adding theususl <strong>उ</strong> to <strong>जास,</strong> <strong>तास</strong>, and <strong>कास</strong>, which again are other forms of <strong>जस्स,तस्स</strong>, and <strong>कस्स</strong>, with one of the consonants dropped and thepreceding vowel lengthened as a compensation, a phenomenonto he noticed in going over the vernaculars. In the feminine,these pronouns have <strong>जहे, तहे</strong>,and <strong>कहे</strong> optionally for the gen. sing.,which are derived from the Prakrit <strong>जिसे, तिसे</strong> and <strong>किसे</strong> and thePali <strong>जिस्साय, तिस्साय</strong>, and <strong>किस्साय</strong>. The base, however, in theApabhraṁśa ends in <strong>अ</strong>and not <strong>ई</strong>, or, the more probable explanation is, that this <strong>हे</strong> is the aspirated form of the <strong>ए</strong>of feminine nours.</p>
<p><strong>इदम्</strong> has <strong>आय</strong> for its base; the instr. and gen. singulars, forinstance, are <strong>आयेण</strong> and <strong>आपहो</strong>. This seems to be taken from thenom. sing. <strong>अअ</strong>, or <strong>अय</strong>by the rule of the substitution of <strong>य</strong> for <strong>अं</strong>.The neuter nom. and acc. sing, is <strong>इमुं</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>एहो</strong> er is nom. and acc. sing. masc. of <strong>एतद्</strong> corresponding to <strong>एसो</strong>,<strong>एह</strong> fem. to <strong>एसा</strong>, and by the application of <strong>उ</strong>to these we have theneuter <strong>एहु.एइ</strong>is the nom. and acc. pl. answering to <strong>एए</strong>Prakrit,with the latter <strong>ए</strong> shortened; and <strong>ओइ</strong> of <strong>अदस</strong> which corresponds tothe form <strong>अमुके</strong>, the <strong>अमु</strong> being changed to <strong>अवुं</strong>by a rule beforementioned, and afterwards to <strong>ओ</strong>; and <strong>के</strong> to <strong>ए</strong>, shortened to <strong>इ</strong>. Inother respects all these pronouns are declined like the corresponding nouns.</p>
<p>The pronouns of the 1st and 2nd persons are thus declined :—</p>

<p>Here we have not the wilderness of forms which we observedin the principal Prakrit. The nom. sing. of the 1st per. is <strong>इउं</strong></p>
<p>corresponding to <strong>अहकम्</strong>, the initial <strong>अ</strong> and the <strong>क्</strong> being elided andthe usual Apabhraṁśa <strong>उ</strong>added. In the Prakrits <strong>अहकम्</strong>, is represented by <strong>अइअं</strong> or <strong>अहयं</strong>, <strong>मइं</strong> is to be traced to the Sanskrit instr.<strong>मया</strong> and the <strong>मयि</strong>, both of which are reduced to the form of <strong>मइ</strong>in the Prakrit. Here it is extended to the acc. also. The pl. base is<strong>अम्ह</strong>, which has been explained. The nom. pl. <strong>अम्हइं</strong>corresponds tosuch a form as <strong>अस्मके</strong>nom. pl., not loc. as Lassen says, through.<strong>अम्हए</strong>; and the gen. pl. has the Apabhraṁśa termination <strong>हं</strong>. Therest are old. <strong>तुह</strong> is a base derived, as I said in going over thePrakrits, from <strong>तुय्हं</strong>and is used in the Prakrit also, <strong>पइं</strong>and <strong>तइं</strong> ofthe acc. instr. and loc. are from <strong>त्वया</strong>and <strong>त्वयि</strong>.The second isfound in the older dialects, the first is peculiar to this. Of thecorruption of <strong>त्व</strong>to <strong>प्प</strong>have already spoken.</p>
<p>The abl. and gen.<strong>तउ</strong>corresponds to a form <strong>त्वक</strong>which withthe Apabhraṁśic <strong>उ</strong> is <strong>तउ</strong>, the <strong>क</strong> being dropped. Or it may betraced to <strong>तव</strong> with the <strong>व</strong> dissolved into <strong>उ</strong>. <strong>तज्झ</strong> is a form found inthe Prakrits also and explained by me as a corruption of the dat.<strong>तुय्हं</strong> in the Pali and Prakrits, derived from the Skr. <strong>तुभ्यस्</strong>.Thedative forms, you will remember, are put under the gen in theolder dislects. The <strong>ध्र</strong>of <strong>तुध्र</strong>is a peculiar Apabhramsic conjunct,formed from <strong>ज्झ्</strong>. The neuter of <strong>तद्</strong>is similarly <strong>त्रं</strong> and <strong>ध्रं</strong>. Thebase of the plural is <strong>तुम्ह</strong>, the same as in the Prakrit; and the nom.pl. <strong>तुम्हइं</strong>is to be traced to <strong>तुष्मके</strong>for <strong>युष्मके</strong> nom. pl. All the formsare similar to those of the first personal pronoun.</p>
<p><strong>THE VERB IN THE APABHRAṀSA</strong></p>
<p>The Present tense of the Apabhraṁśa verb admits, besidesthose of the corresponding Prakrit or Śaurasenī tense, thefollowing forms :— 1st pers. sing. <strong>लहउं</strong>, pl. <strong>लहहुं</strong>; 2nd pers. sing.<strong>लहहि</strong>, pl. <strong>लहहु</strong>; 3rd pers. sing. <strong>लहइ</strong>, pl. <strong>लहहिं</strong>.</p>
<p>It appears that some of these forms have arisen from &amp; confusion of the Present Indicative with the Imperative. The prevailing and distinguishing final of the latter is the vowel <strong>उ</strong>; and here<br>
we see it is appended to the forms of the 1st pers. sing. and 2ndpers. pl., though it does not occur in those forms in any of theolder dialects.</p>
<p>The <strong>ह्</strong> is another characteristio of these paradigms. That ofthe second pers. sing. we get from the old <strong>सि</strong>, and that of the pl.</p>
<p>exists in the Prakrit, being derived from the Skr. <strong>थ</strong>. But thethird pers. pl. and the 1st pers. pl. get it simply by an extensionof the analogy or It may have been introduced to prevent ahiatus and thus may, like those of the cases, have been simplya <em>spiritus lenis.</em> The <strong>हुं</strong> of the latter, however, may be traced to<strong>म्हो, ओ</strong>being shortened to <strong>उ</strong>, just as <strong>म्हा</strong>and <strong>म्हि</strong>of the declensionsbecome <strong>हां</strong>and <strong>हिं</strong>.Instead of the 3rd pers. pl. <strong>न्ति</strong>we have <strong>हिं</strong>inwhich, though the <strong>ह</strong>is due to analogy, the characteristic <strong>इ</strong> andthe nasal are preserved.</p>
<p>You will thus see that in the declensions as well as conjugations the prevails <strong>ह्</strong>in this dialect. The Imperative second pers.sing. ends in , <strong>इ, ए</strong> or <strong>उ</strong>. The first two may be traced to the Prakritand Sankrit <strong>हि, ह्</strong> being dropped as in the Vernaculars; and thelast seems to be substituted for the <strong>अ</strong> of one of the forms in theoriginal dialects by analogy; or it may be the remnant of <strong>मु</strong>,changed first to <strong>हु</strong>, and then to <strong>उ</strong>. But a better and, I may say, the trueexplanation of these forms will be given in going over theVernaculars.</p>
<p>Hemacandra does not give any more forms for the Imperative,but Kramadīśvara gives <strong>ऊ</strong> for the second person plural whichmust very likely be <strong>हु</strong>, the same as in the Present, and <strong>हुं</strong> for thefirst pers. pl. which we have in the Present also. In one of theverses quoted by Hemacandra occurs <strong>पिअहुं</strong> which seems to correspond to <strong>पिबन्तु</strong>, if the reading is correct. The truth seems tobe that the forms of the Imperative were lost, and the sense confounded with that of the Present, but the distinctive forms werethose of the second pers. sing., and in this respect there is ananalogy with Hindi and Gujarati which resemble the Apabhraṁśathe most.</p>
<p>The Future has the Prakrit and Śaurasenīforms in <strong>हि</strong> and <strong>इस्स</strong>;but one <strong>म्</strong> of this latter is dropped, and then the terminations ofthe Apabhraṁśa Present are added.</p>
<p>The terminations of the absolutive are <strong>इ. इउ, अवि, इवि, एवि,एविणु,एष्पि, एप्पिणु, इ</strong>. is the same as the Śaurasenī <strong>इञ्</strong> from the Skr.<strong>य, इउ</strong>is the same, with the usual <strong>उ</strong> added to it, or is to be tracedto the <strong>तुम्</strong> or <strong>इतुम्</strong> which is, as we have seen, confounded in thePrakrit with the absolutive, and the rest are various forms of the</p>
<p>Vedic <strong>त्वीन</strong> with the Prakrit augment <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>ए</strong>,This <strong>त्वीन</strong>is, by arule before mentioned, changed to <strong>प्पिण</strong>, which with <strong>उ</strong>becomes <strong>प्पिणु</strong>and by dropping the final <strong>न</strong>we have <strong>प्पि</strong>. This, however, may bederived also from such a form <strong>त्वी</strong> found in the Vedas. This <strong>प्पि</strong>or <strong>प्पिणु</strong>is then softened to <strong>वि</strong> or <strong>विणु</strong>, as <strong>प्</strong> is so softened in manycases. When the augment <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>ए</strong>is not prefixed, we have <strong>वि</strong> inthe form of <strong>अवि</strong>, the <strong>अ</strong> being the final vowel of the root.</p>
<p>Some of the terminations of the absolutive are also used toform the infinitive, on account of the prevailing confusion between the two. In consequence of this very confusion, recourseis had to other ways of forming the latter which are similar tothose existing in the Prakrits; but these will be noticed hereafter.</p>
<p>The termination <strong>तव्य</strong> of the potential participle assumes theforms of <strong>इएव्वउं, एव्वउं</strong>and <strong>एव</strong>. The first two represent the formwith the addition of <strong>क</strong>; and the <strong>इ</strong> of <strong>इएव्यउं</strong>is the usual augmentThe <strong>अ</strong> of the <strong>त</strong>of <strong>तव्य</strong>which remains after the consonantal portionis dropped, is by the influence of the preceding <strong>इ</strong> changed to <strong>ए</strong>.</p>
<p>In these points which are not noticed here, the Apabhraṁśafollows chiefly the Śaurasenī, and the principal Prakrit also tosome extent. Thus in a great measure it represents those dialectsin a further stage of decay; but it must be considered to havederived some words or forms independently also. Thus the <strong>पइ</strong> ofthe second person pronoun cannot be derived from the Prakrit <strong>तइ</strong>,nor <strong>प्पिण</strong>of the absolutive from <strong>तूण</strong> or <strong>ऊण</strong>, or <strong>पण</strong>of abstract nounsfrom <strong>त्तण</strong>, but directly from the Sanskrit <strong>त्वया, त्यीन</strong> and <strong>त्वन</strong>. Thiscorruption of <strong>त्व</strong>must have existed in some of the older dialectstoo, since, as observed before, we have it in Aśoka&rsquo;s inscriptions;and the Apabhraṁśa derived it as well as a few such peculiarities from them.</p>
<p><strong>LECTURE IV</strong></p>
<p><strong>P ONOLOGY OF THE VERNACULARS OF NORTHERN INDIA</strong></p>
<p>We have now traced the gradual decay of Sanskrit from theform in which it is presented to us in the oldest literary recordsto that which it assumed in the Apabhraṁśa dialect. We haveseen how words lost some of their vocal elements on account ofthe natural tendency of men to economize effort, as well as inconsequence of the fact that the vocal organs of the people, whothrough historical nooidents had to speak that language thoughit was not theirs, were untrained to utter the sounds of thatlanguage, and that they imported into it some sounds to whichthey themselves were previously accustomed. We have alsoobserved the effects of the operation of the law of analogy insimplifying the grammar of the language — an operation, therange of which, in consequence of the ignorance of those sameforeigners, was very extensive. The declensions and conjugations gradually lost their variety, and became reduced to one or two types by the generalization of the rules, originally applicableonly to the nouns and verbs frequently used in ordinary intercourse. At the same time the terminations themselves of someof the cases, tenses, and moods came through numberless analogies to have the same or similar forms, and their vocal bodygradually became attenuated and in some instances they werealtogether dropped. Thus these processes of simplification werecarried on much further than was consistent with intelligibilityin ordinary intercourse. Hence the necessity arose of inventingnew modes of expression for those relations which came to beimperfectly expressed or ceased to be expressed in the old way.As observed in the last lecture, such new expressions are to bemet with in the Apabhraṁśa dialect.</p>
<p>If the Prakrits and the Apabhraṁśa which we have examinedreally represent the speech of the Indian people at certain periodsof their past history, we should expect to find a relation of continuity between them and the prevailing speech of modern times.The words and grammatical forms in the modern vernaculars</p>
<p>should either be the same as those existing in those dialects, orshould be easily deducible from them by laws which we haveobserved to be in operation; and if in the Apabhraṁśa thegrammatical forms came to be in a condition in which reconstruction was necessary, and if accordingly it was begun, weshould find it carried on much further in the vernaculars andthat on principles used in the Apabhraṁśa and the other dialectsand out of materials existing in them. We will therefore proceednow to the examination of the vernaculars with a view to tracethis continuity.</p>
<p>The varieties of speech prevailing in Northern India at thepresent day are almost innumerable. If even a few peculiaritieswere to be regarded as giving individuality to a language, thenumber of dialects spoken in this part of the country wouldexceed even the proverbial fifty-six. But they may be dividedinto classes on the principle of resemblance; and generally thedialects spoken in the adjoining provinces are so alike eachother that they may be regarded as constituting one class or evenone language. Thus we have nine principal languages; andstarting from ourselves, and going northwards, first on thewestern side of the country and then turning to the east andsouth-east, I may state them as the Marathi, the Gujarati, theSindhi, including the Kacchi, the Panjabi, the Kashmiri, the Hindi, the Nepali, the Bengali, and the Oriya.</p>
<p>Of these the Kashmiri and the Nepali have not yet been studied,and no grammars or books are available. Hence my observations will not extend to them. Each of these has its dialects; butthose of some, such as the Gujarati and the Sindhi, differ fromthe main language in unimportant particulars. The same is thecase with the Marathi, except in some corners of the Marathacountry. But in these there are five dialects differing in a greatmany important particulars from the main Marathi. Thus, theGoanese prevails in Goa; the Malvani, my own native tongue,and the Savantvadi, both of which, notwithstanding some minordifferences, may be considered as one, are spoken in the Malvan,Vengorla, and Savantvadi districts. The Chitpavni is used onlyby the caste of Chitpavan Brahmans in the district aboutRatnagiri; the Salsetti is spoken by the original inhabitants of</p>
<p>that island and of Bombay; and the Khandeshi, which is a mixtureof Marathi and Gujarati and contains to an appreciable degreea barbarous element, probably from a Bhil source, prevails inKhandesh.</p>
<p>The Hindi has a great many dialects. Two at least may bedistinguished among the variety of speech prevalent inRajputana, the Mewari spoken in Mewar and the adjoiningdistricts, and the Marwari which prevails in Marwar, Jesselmere,and the other provinces. These, as may be inferred from theirgeographical position, are midway between the Gujarati and theHindi dialects of the North, displaying some of the peculiarcharacteristics of both. Furthernorth, we have the Brajprevailing in the country about Mathura; and to the east,the Kanoji. There is not much difference between these.The language of the history of eighty-four Vaiṣṇavasand other books of the Vallabhācāryan sects, whichis ordinarily supposed to be the Braj,grammatical forms identical with those mentioned by a recent grammarian as peculiar to the Kanoji. There is a good deal of confusion as regards this matter, the characteristics of one beingfound in the printed books together with those belonging toanother. Then further north, we have the Garhawali and theKumaoni spoken in the provinces of Garhawal and Kumaon.</p>
<p>To the east, we have the Avadhi or the dialect of the provinceof Avadha or Ayodhya, and to the south of this again is theRewai spoken in the State of Rewa. Further to the east is theBhojpuri and kindred dialects prevailing in Bihar and theadjacent districts on the confines of Bengal.</p>
<p>The old literature of the Hindi is principally written in twodialects, the Braj, and what is called the Purbi. Sūradāsa&rsquo;s works,Beharilal&rsquo;s Satasai, and others are written in the former; and tothese I may add the Vallabhha works I have already mentioned.The Rāmāyaṇa and Tulasidasa&rsquo;s other works are written in thelatter. The chief distinction between the idioms of Sūradāsa andTulasīdāsa appears to me to be, that the latter uses a great manygrammatical forms which are old, and from which those used bythe former are derived. In this respect Purbi might be considered to be a very old form of the Braj. But there are a few other</p>
<p>distinctions, though it is questionable whether they are enough tojustify the Purbi being considered an independent dialect. Thelanguage of Kabīra&rsquo;s Ramainīand Sākhiīs presents a few peculiarities found in neither of the above. But the characteristics ofSūradāsa and Tulasīdāsa are also to be found in it; so that if weleave out of consideration the other works of Kabīra, in whichthere is probably another variety of speech, the dialect used bythese Hindi poets may be considered to be the same. This hascome to be regarded as the poetic dialect, and most of the otherHindi poets have written in it. Its modern representative is theBraj, in which the commentaries on Tulasīdāsa&rsquo;s, Kabīra&rsquo;s andBehārilāl&rsquo;s works, and on the tenth book of the Bhāgavatathat Ihave seen, are written. This then is the Hindi literary dialect.The language, however, which is used as the medium of instruction in the Government schools in the North-Western Provinces,and in which the books published by the Educational Departmentare written, is now regarded as the Standard Hindi, and its grammatical structure is identical with that of the Urdu spoken bythe Mussalmans. This is rather the dialect in which the Hindusof the different provinces in Northern India communicate witheach other, than that which they speak in their own provinces.</p>
<p>The Panjabi has also several dialects; but little is known aboutthem. Oriyi resembles the Bengali in so many respects that oneof them may be considered a dialect of the other. The similaritybetween the Hindi and the Panjabi is also very great.</p>
<p>I will now give short specimens of these dialects.</p>
<p><strong>I Marathi:</strong></p>

<p>Then again Babe Nānaskjīsaid:&ldquo;O Paṇḍit, hear. Is the religious holiness of Brahmans and Kṣatriyas preserved by the sacred thread or by good deeds?

Then they began to exclaim: &ldquo;O God, he is still but a child, and how wonderfully he speaks&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>V Hindi:</strong></p>

At that time the cowherd boys came one after another and began to see; and Śrīi Kṛṣṇa went forward and stood in the shade of a Kadamba tree in the forest.</p>
<p><strong>VI Braj :</strong></p>

<p>(From the Story of the Manifestation of Govardhananāthjī.)</p>
<p>When all the inhabitants of Vraja heard that Devadamana was greatly fond of cows, they all joined and resolved that all who had cows should esch present one or two. And the inhabtants of Vraja joined and caused each of the twenty-four villages</p>
<p>about the mountain (Govardhana) to present one or two cowseach. And it was resolved that in the twenty villages he whose cow should first calveshould present the calf to Devadamana. In this way thousands of cows were presented to the Prosperous One. Then he used the milk, curds, butter and whey of the cows in his home.</p>

<p>Will you hear then? That year at the time when I was suffering from intermittent fever, remained lying in bed day and night, and had no strength to rise and stand, my lord (husband) came. I had not seen what sort of a man my husband was since. I ceased to be an infant. Nothing is more valuable to a woman than her husband. I had thought that my suffering would become alleviated, if he sat by my side for a few minutes <em>(lit.</em> two daṇḍas ) and spoke with me. Dear sister, you will not believe me when I say that, as soon as he stood by my side, he said, &ldquo;It is sixteen years since I married you and went away. You are one of my wives. I come to you, being in need of money, and will go back soon. I spoketo your father; but he put me off. Do pull out the ornament in your arm (round the wrist), and give it to me.</p>

<p>You will find that in the Marathi passage there are about 58 different words of which 26 or a few less than a half are derived from the Sanskrit through the Prakrits; in the Gujarati there are 42 out of which 23 or a few more than a half are of the latter description; in the Sindhi the proportion is 38 to 21, or somewhat greater than a half; in the Panjabi 44 to 23 or a half; in the High</p>
<p>Hindi 48 to 23 or a little less than a half; in the Braj 45 to 29, <em>i. e.</em> about two-thirds; in the Bengali 71 to 27. <em>i. e,</em> about two-fifths; and in the Oriya 32 to 15 or a little less than a half. I have not taken into consideration other words which do come to us undoubtedly through the Prakrits, but the etymology of which is not so obvious. These would increase the proportion and bring. it to more than one-half in most of the cases. In this list there are three or four words such as <strong>नाम</strong>, and <strong>वह</strong>, which may be called. old Tatsama, since they exist unchanged in the Prakrits, and the rest may be called cld Tadbhavas.</p>
<p>Now in these passages you will also have seen a large number of words such 36 <strong>प्रार्थना, अग्निप्रवेश, आध्वर्य, स्वप्न, बालक, शरीर, नदी, प्रिय, प्रथम, ज्वर, दिवारात्रि, शृङ्ग, स्थान</strong> &amp;c., which are exactly the same as in Sanskrit. They could not have existed in those forms in the Prakrits, and hence it is clear that they were introduced long after the Prakrit period; and the tendency now-a-days in our languages is to introduce more of such words. These may be called modern Tatsamas. But some of these have undergone a corruption since they were adopted. Thus <strong>कर्म</strong> is pronounced <strong>करम; धर्म, धरम;क्षत्रिय, खतरी; कार्य, कारज</strong>; and <strong>कृपा, कर्पा</strong> or <strong>कुर्पा</strong> while the Prakrit corruptions of these are <strong>कम्म. धम्म, खत्तिअ, कज्ज</strong>, and <strong>किवा</strong> .Such words therefore are modern Tadbhavas.</p>
<p>At the end of my observations on the Prakrits in the last lecture, I gave a list of vocables existing in those dialects which are called Deśyas by native grammarians, and showed that several of them existed in our vernaculars also. We observe from the above passages, which contain such words as <strong>मुत्सद्दी, साहेव</strong> and <strong>पातिशाह</strong> ,that there are in the modern dialects words of an Arabic or Persian origin also. Thus we may distinguish these elements in the vocabulary of the vernaculars of Northern India:—1. Old Tadbhavs, 2. Old Tatsama, 3. Modern Tadbhava, 4. Modern Tatsama, 5. Deśya, 6. Arabic, and 7. Persian.</p>
<p>In its nature the old Tatsama element is but a small quantity and the main skeleton of our languages is made up of the old Tadbhava. It forms the principal constituent of the speech of the middle classes. The higher classes, however, use the Modern Tatsama and Tadbhava element to a much larger extent; and</p>
<p>the language spoken by learned men is heavily loaded with pure Sanskrit words. This element has succeeded in driving out a very appreciable portion of the first in some of the languages. The Bengali contains the largest number of pure Sanskrit words, and hence one who knows Sanskrit can master the language in but a few weeks. The old Tadbhava element is reduced to the smallest minimum in what is called Sādhu bhāṣāor the speech of the educated. According to the extent of the modern Tatsama or Tadbhava element, the other languages may be arranged in the following order :—Oriya, Marathi, Hindi, Gujarati, Punjabi, Sindhi.</p>
<p>It must, however, he remarked that the modern Tatsamas appear in a pure or correct Sanskrit form only in the written language. The Bengalis in actually pronouncing these words. corrupt them in a manner which renders them unrecognizable as Sanskrit words; and often in the same way as the old Prakrit speakers did. Thus <strong>आत्मा</strong> is pronounced <strong>अत्ता. ईश्वर इस्सर, मोक्ष मोक्ख</strong>, &amp;c. The same is the case more or less with the speakers of the other languages, so that the pure Sanskrit words that we meet with in the written modern vernaculars, may be considered modern Tadbhavas and in rare cases Prakrit Tadbhavas. The educated classes, however, in Maharashtra and Gujarat, and to a certain extent in the Hindi provinces, pronounce the Sanskrit words correctly. The Sindi, however, contains but a few pure. Sanskrit words; hence it is rich in the old Tadbhava element, while it draws largely upon the Persian and Arabic.</p>
<p>This foreign element is used in our dialects, principally in political matters. Persian and Arabic words are also used in the concerns of ordinary life. but their number is limited. The higher classes and learned men very rarely use them; while that element enters largely into the speech of the Mahomedans in the different provinces and the Parsis. And the Mahomedans in the Hindi area use such a large number of these words that their language is by some considered an independent dialect and called Urdu, but it differs from the High Hindi in nothing further than in the use of these foreign words.</p>
<p>But though the vocabulary of our languages is thus composite,</p>
<p>the grammar is in every way the same that they have inherited from the Prakrits. Here there is no mixture of different elements. A good many of the forms now in use have been constructed since the Prakrit period; but, as I hope to show you, they are simply combinations or adaptations of existing Prakrit forms. Thus we will divide our examination of the vernaculars into three branches. (I) In the first we will trace out the Sanskrit words which were transformed in the Pali and the Prakrits in the various ways we have noticed, and discover the operation of the same or other laws in their further transformation, if they have undergone any, as also in the transformation of other words which remained unchanged in the Prakrits or were imported from Sanskrit at a later period. (II) In the second we will trace out the Prakrit or Apabhramsa grammatical forms (III) and in the third, examine the new or reconstructed forms and find out the principles upon which they have been made up.</p>
<p>The phonetic changes which the words of a living language undergo involve, as a general rule, economy of exertion in its widest sense; but there are some which do not, or which require increased effort. Economy may sometimes be effected in more ways than one. For instance, the assimilation of vowels to consonants may be effected by changing <strong>अ</strong> to <strong>ओ</strong> and thence to <strong>उ</strong>, or to <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>इ</strong>. Some people have a predilection for the former, others for the latter. Again, one mode of change may be economical to some and another opposed to it to others. Thus the assimilation involved in the less open vowels <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong> is of importance to some, but of little consequence to others; and they prefer the economy arising from the change of these vowels to <strong>अ</strong> , since this does not require any movement of the tongue or the lips. Here then we have two kinds of peculiarities. Again, if an ordinary change has a very comprehensive range or is almost universal in a language, and if other ordinary changes do not keep pace with it, and are to be found only in a limited number of instances, that ordinary change must be considered to be due to a peculiar vocal habit or incapacity. The assimilation of conjuncts and of the diphthongs in the Pali and the Prakrits, and the elision of uninitial consonants in the latter, are changes of this nature. And finally, there is all the greater reason</p>
<p>for attributing changes that involve no economy or necessitate greater exertion, such as the change of dentals to cerebrals or of sonants to surds, to vocal peculiarities. These several kinds of peculiarities give distinct individualities, so far as the external forms of words are concerned, to languages derived from one and the same primitive language. Thus then, some phonetic changes are special or peculiar, and others ordinary.</p>
<p>We will now take up in order the instances observable in the Pali and the Prakrits of these two kinds of changes and trace them in the vernaculars, and also endeavour to find out whether these dialects have preserved any of the Pali and Prakrit peculiarities or developed new ones.</p>
<p>And first as regards vowels. The following are some of the in- stances with the vernacular forms of the words in which Sanskrit is <strong>ऋ</strong> changed to <strong>अ ,इ</strong> , or <strong>उ</strong> in the Prakrits:—</p>

<p>Some of the above words have two forms in the Prakrits, but since one of them does not occur in any of the vernaculars, it has been omitted. There are other words having two or even threePrakrit forms, one of which occurs in one of the vernaculars, and the other or others in another. Thus:—</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1. Mr. Beams considers the <strong>उ</strong> of the S.<strong>पिउ, भाउ</strong> &amp;c.,to be the nom, sing, termination and not a transformation of the Sanskrit. But he is evidently wrong, since this <strong>उ</strong> appears in the oblique cases also, as<strong>पिउजो, भाउजो</strong>. &amp;c.; while the nom. sing <strong>उ</strong> does not, as in <strong>देहजो</strong> , icon. sing of <strong>देहु</strong> &ldquo;a country&rdquo;. The words have <strong>उ</strong> even in those language, such as the P. and M., which have discarded the nom. sing. <strong>उ</strong> and it appears even in the feminine word माउ which cannot take the masculine termination <strong>उ.</strong></p>

<p>As the Pali and the Prakrit alphabet, on account of these changes, has no <strong>ऋ</strong>, so do the vernacular alphabets not possess it. Sanskrit words containing the vowel have, however, been recently imported into the languages, but since even in those words, it is not correctly pronounced except by a few learned men, it cannot be said really to exist in vernacular speech, notwithstanding the use of those words. The usual modern pronunciation of the vowel is <strong>र, रि, रु,</strong> or <strong>अर्</strong>.</p>

<p>Another characteristic change we noticed in the Prakrits is the softening <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong> to <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong> before double consonants. A good many words so changed have descended to the vernaculars. Thus:—</p>

<p>The change of <strong>इ</strong> to <strong>ए</strong>, according to the grammarians, optional in the Prakrits and that of <strong>उ</strong>to <strong>ओ</strong>necessary. But in both cases we find two forms in the vernaculars. Still the prevailing forms in the latter are those in <strong>ओ</strong>, while those in <strong>उ</strong>are rare, and mostly to be found in Bengali and Oriya, which languages, and more especially the first, have a predilection for <strong>उ</strong>, in which case it is possible they may have changed the Prakrit <strong>ओ</strong>to <strong>उ</strong>.</p>
<p>In the Pali and Prakrits, the<strong>ए</strong>and <strong>ओ</strong> in these cases are short; but the vernaculars, having dropped one of the following double consonants, have, according to a general rule to be noticed hereafter, lengthened the vowels. When instead of a double consonant, there is a conjunct of a nasal and a mute as in <strong>सेन्दूर</strong>and <strong>तोण्ड</strong>the nasal consonant is reduced to a simple anusvāra or nasal sound, so as to give to the conjunct the character of a simple consonant, and the ए or ओ is pronounced long as in <strong>सेन्दूर</strong>and <strong>तोंड</strong>. In this manner, though the Prakrit short <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong>are, in the instances in which we possess an evidence of their existence, lengthened, I think in some of the vernaculars at least we have these vowels. For in a good many instances in Marathi and Gujarati and air are pronounced short. There is a rule which in Marathi is almost universal, and in Gujarati often observable, in virtue of which the accent or the whole weight of the sound of a word falls on the final <strong>आ</strong>or <strong>एं</strong> of nouns in the former, and the final <strong>ओ</strong> or <strong>ऊं</strong> in the latter; and the preceding vowels are rendered short while in the original Sanskrit and in Hindi they are long. Thus:—</p>
<pre><code>**\[Table 6: Treatment of long vowels in Prakrit and Modern Vernaculars\]**
</code></pre>
<p>Skr. <strong>कीटक</strong>: a worm, Pr. <strong>कीडओ</strong>, H. <strong>कीडा</strong>, M. <strong>किडा</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>कीलकः</strong> a nsil, Pr. <strong>कीलओ</strong>, H. <strong>कीला</strong>, M. <strong>खिला</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>कूपकः</strong> well, Pr, <strong>कूवओ</strong>, H. <strong>कूआ</strong>, G. <strong>कुवो</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>चित्रकः</strong> leopard, Pr. <strong>चितओ</strong>, H. <strong>चीता</strong>, M. <strong>चिता</strong>, G. <strong>चितो</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>चूडकः</strong> a bangle, Pr. <strong>चूडओ</strong>, H. <strong>चूडा</strong>, M, <strong>चुडा</strong>, G. <strong>चुडो</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>चूर्णक</strong>: lime, Pr. <strong>चुण्अओ</strong>, H. <strong>चूना</strong>, M. <strong>चुना</strong>, G, <strong>चुनो.</strong></p>
<p>And many more instances might be given. Similarly in Marathi the preceding long vowels are shortened when the terminations of the oblique cases are applied, as in <strong>भिकेस,पिकास,किडीस,</strong></p>
<p>पिठास, उनास, भुकेस, गुलास, &amp;o., dative singulars of भीक &lsquo;beggery,&rsquo; पीक &lsquo;cгор,&rsquo; &rsquo; कीड ’,a worm, ’ पीठ ’ &lsquo;flour&rsquo;,’ ऊन ’ sun, ’भूक’ ’hunger,’ ’गूल’ ’molasse’, &amp;c. If so, then by a necessary law of Marathi speech, the ए and ओ of गेल ’ gone&rsquo;, केल ’gone&rsquo; मेला ’a gathering&rsquo; जेवढा’ as much&rsquo; पेडा ’sweetmeat&rsquo; घोड ’ a horse&rsquo;, कोलसा &lsquo;charcoal&rsquo;, गोफा ’ the ankle,&rsquo; जोडा&rsquo; a pair,&rsquo; &amp;c., and of शेणास, to Gowdung,&rsquo; शेतास &rsquo;to a field,&lsquo;पेठेस &rsquo;to a market, लेकरास &rsquo;to a child,&rdquo; गोतास &rsquo;to a race, चोरस &rsquo;to a thief,&rsquo; पोरसा &rsquo;to a boy, &amp;c., must be short. And if the Marathi speaker will compare his pronunciation. of मेल, शेत, शेण, गोत, पोर, &amp;c. with that of मेला, शेताम, शेणास, गोतास, , &amp;c., he will find that the quantity of ए and ओ in these latter words is shorter than in the former. Similarly, in Gujarati the first ए and ओ of केवी &lsquo;how large,</p>
<p>पेलो mad man, छोडो ’end,&rsquo; मेलो ’upper storey,&rsquo; मेलो ’a gathering&rsquo; खेलो lap,घोढो a horse चोखा.<em>pl,</em> &lsquo;rice,&rsquo; पोलो &lsquo;broad,&rsquo; पोणा. <em>pl</em> &rsquo;three-quarters,&rdquo; &rsquo; मोगरो ’ jessamine’, कोलसो ’charcoal’, &amp;c., must be short. In Gujarati the penultimate vowel of a monosyllabic root is, as in Hindi, shortened in the causal, as in लागदुं &rsquo;to adhere,&rsquo; लगाडवुं to cause to adhere,&rsquo; &lsquo;join,&rdquo; धावडुं &rsquo; to run,&rsquo; धवाडवुं to cause to run, सीखवुं &rsquo;to learn,&rsquo; सिखाबबुं to teach,&rsquo; शीदवुं &rsquo;to sew,&rsquo; शिवाडवुं &rsquo;to cause to sew,</p>
<p>बीहडुं &rsquo;to fear,</p>
<p>&rsquo; पिहवाडवुं &rsquo;to terrify,&rsquo; &amp;o. But in Hindi the short vowels that take the place of ए and ओ areइ and उ, as in दिखान ’ to show’ from देख्ना &rsquo;to see,’ घुलाना ’to caus to wash&rsquo; from घोना &rsquo;to wash,&rsquo; &amp;c. But in Gujarati the ए and ओ are not changed to इ and उ but remain, as in देखावुडुं &rsquo;to show &lsquo;, लेपाडवुं &rsquo;to cause to take&rsquo; from लेचवुं to take,जोवाडवुं &rsquo;to cause to wash from घोबचुं &rsquo;to wash,&rsquo; जोवाडबुं &rsquo; to show from जोबडुं fo take.&rsquo; धोबाढवूं &rsquo; जोवडुं &rsquo;to see,&rsquo; &amp;c., which they cannot do by the general rule if they are long. They must therefore be pronounced short. And as a matter of fact, it will be found that the Gujarati people in these and several other cases, give a short sound to these vowels. In the Malvani dialect of Marathi ओ is very often pronounced like the English o in <em>pot,</em> and ए like <em>e</em> in <em>pet.</em> In Bengali the ओ to which अ is converted in ordinary speech is also broad and short, and we have reason to believe that both ए and ओ when they really occur in words, are often pronounced short in that and the Bhojpuri and other dialects of Bihar and Mithila,</p>
<p>It may be urged against one of the arguments I have used, that if the ए and ओ in शेतास and गोतासा are short, the first आin.</p>
<p><strong>हातास</strong> &rsquo;to the hand,&rsquo; <strong>कानास</strong> &rsquo;to the ear,&rsquo; &amp;c., must also be short, and consequently these vowels must be changed to अ . But अ is not necessarily the short form of <strong>आ</strong>, or <strong>आ</strong> the long form of <strong>अ</strong>. For in pronouncing <strong>आ</strong>the lips and the upper and lower parts of the mouth are much more widely apart from each other than in pronouncing <strong>अ</strong> ; so that the difference between the two is not simply of quantity but of quality also. The first <strong>आ</strong> of such words as <strong>हातास</strong> and
<strong>मातला</strong> &lsquo;maddened, is therefore short <strong>आ</strong>; that is, in pronouneing it, the vocal organs are in the same condition as in pionouncing long <strong>आ</strong>, but the time occupied is shorter than in the case of the latter. The <strong>अ</strong> that we have got in Sanskrit is short, but in most of the vernaculars we have a long <strong>अ</strong> which takes longer time to pronounce than the Sanskrit <strong>अ</strong> , while the oondition of the vocal organs is the same. The final <strong>अ</strong> of words is silent in the vernaculars, but at the same time the vowel of the preceding syllable is lengthened. Thus
<strong>गुण</strong> &rsquo; virtue&rsquo; &lsquo;is, as a Sanskrit word, pronounced <em>gūṇa,</em> but in Marathi and Gujarati it i</p>
<p>s</p>
<p>gūṇ</p>
<p>; and in Hindi</p>
<p>gūṇ</p>
<p>;</p>
<p>Sanskrit <strong>गुड</strong>gu-ḍa &lsquo;molasses&rsquo; is in Marathi <em>gūl</em>; Sanskrit e <strong>तिल</strong><em>ti-la</em> &lsquo;sesamum&rsquo; is in Marathi and Gujarati <em>tīl</em> and Hindi <em>til.</em> In the same way, the word <strong>रथ</strong> is in Sanskrit pronounc ed <em>ra-tha,</em> but when in vernacular pronunciation it becomes <em>rath</em>, the a is not the short <strong>अ</strong> , but <strong>अ</strong> pronounced long, as if the word were <em>ra-ath</em> without a pause between the two as. The long <strong>अ</strong> and the short are found side by side in such a word as <strong>मदन</strong>, which as pronounced in Sanskrit is <em>madana</em> with three consonants each followed by the Sanskrit or short <strong>अ</strong>. In the modern languages, however, the first syllable has its as in Sanskrit, but that of the second is lengthened, and in the last it is dropped, and the word thus becomes <em>madaan</em>.</p>
<p>This peculiarity of softening <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong> to <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong>
has been pre- served by the vernaculars. It is not necessary that a conjunct consonant should follow. Thus:-</p>
<p>[Table 7 change of इ and उ short ए and ओ in Modern Vernaculars. ]</p>

<p>The <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong> , to which <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong> are thus reduced must be short, since there is no reason here why the quantity should be increased.</p>
<p>Of the instances in which long <strong>ई</strong> and <strong>ऊ</strong> are softened to long <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong> in the Prakrits, the vernaculars have retained the following:—</p>
<p>[Table 8: change of ई and ऊ to long ए and ओ]</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>बिभीतक</strong> myrobalan, Pr. <strong>बहेडओ</strong>, M. बे<strong>हडा</strong>, G. <strong>बेहडूं</strong>. H. P. <strong>बहेडा</strong>,S. <strong>बहेडौ</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>ताम्बूल</strong> betel leaf, Pr. <strong>तम्बोल,</strong> H. P. <strong>तम्बोल</strong> M. <strong>तांबोल</strong>, in <strong>तांबोली</strong> aseller of betel leaves, G.<strong>तंबोल</strong> in <strong>तंबोली</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>स्थूल</strong>, Pr. <strong>थोर</strong>, M. <strong>थोर</strong>.</p>
<p>More modern instances of this change are:—</p>
<p>[Table 9: the same changes in more modern words ]</p>
<p>H. <strong>लीमु</strong> or <strong>लेमु</strong>, B. <strong>लेबु</strong>,a lemon.</p>
<p>H. <strong>मूछ</strong> or <strong>मोछ</strong> mustache, Pr. <strong>मस्सु</strong> or <strong>मसु</strong>.</p>
<p>G.<strong>पेठे</strong>in that manner, from Skr.<strong>पीठिकया</strong>.</p>
<p>G. <strong>बेरवूं</strong> to scatter from Pr. <strong>विइर</strong> Skr. <strong>विकिर</strong>.</p>
<p>G. <strong>खेचवुं</strong> to pull, for H. <strong>खीचना</strong>.</p>
<p>O, <strong>भोक</strong> hunger, for the <strong>भूक</strong> or <strong>भूख</strong> of the others.</p>
<p>Of the few instances in which <strong>इ</strong> is softened to <strong>अ</strong> in the Prakrits, the vernaculars have retained <strong>हलद्वा</strong> in the M. G <strong>हलद</strong>, H. <strong>हलदी</strong>, 0. <strong>हलदी</strong> and P. <strong>हलहदी</strong> or <strong>हलदी</strong>. Though प<strong>डंसुआ</strong> does not occur, still <strong>पडा</strong> which stands for <strong>प्रति</strong> a in this word is preserved in several words, as M. <strong>पडसाद</strong> ,&rsquo;echo&rsquo; for Skr. <strong>प्रतिशब्द, पडजीभ</strong>, &rsquo;the uvula&rsquo; for Skr. <strong>प्रतिजिह्वा,, पडछाया</strong> Or <strong>पडसावली</strong>, H. <strong>परछाई</strong> for Skr. <strong>प्रतिच्छाया</strong> &amp;o. No more instances of this change are given by the grammarians, but, as observed in the last lecture, the substitution of <strong>अ</strong> for <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>उ</strong> in one of the two or more places in which it occurs in some words indicates a tendency in the Prakrits towards this change. The vernaculars have got more instances.Thus:—</p>
<p>[Table 10: इ changed to अ]</p>
<p>M. G. S. <strong>पारख</strong> examination, test, H. P. B. O.<strong>परख</strong>,
Skr.<strong>परीक्षा</strong> pr. <strong>परिक्खा</strong>; also the verb <strong>पारखणें</strong>.</p>

<p>H.<strong>पहरना</strong> or <strong>पहिरना</strong>, S. <strong>पराहणुं</strong>, B. <strong>परण</strong>, to wear, Pr, <strong>परिहाण</strong>, Skr. <strong>परिधान</strong>.</p>
<p>M. G. <strong>पण</strong> but, also. Pr. <strong>पुणो</strong>, Skr. <strong>पुनः.</strong></p>
<p>M. H. <strong>जथा</strong> an hord, Skr. <strong>यूथकः.</strong></p>
<p>P. <strong>पंडत</strong> a learned man, Skr. <strong>पण्डित</strong>.</p>
<p>P. <strong>सगन</strong> an omen, Skr. <strong>शकुन</strong>.</p>
<p>But in Gujarati the tendency has operated very widely, as will be seen from the followingः—</p>
<p><strong>[Table11:The same उ or ऋor इ changed to अ in Gujarati ]</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>And there are many other instances, such as <strong>फरवुं</strong> &rsquo;to walk,&rsquo; <strong>टकवुं</strong> &rsquo;to last, and <strong>मरडवुं</strong> &rsquo;to twist,&rsquo; the Marathi forms of which are <strong>फिरणें, टिकणें</strong>, and <strong>मुरडणें</strong>, Thus Sanskrit Prakrit, and even foreign words such as <strong>मालूम</strong> ’known’ which becomes <strong>मालम</strong>, change their <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>उ</strong> to<strong>अ</strong> . The Gujarati people have thus got a habit of careless pronunciation. After forming the contact necessary for</p>
<p>pronouncing a consonant, they emit the breath; without compressing it at the palatal or labial position, and thus save the trouble of raising the middle of the tongue to the palate, or of rounding the lips.</p>
<p>Under the head of assimilation, the first characteristic vowel change observable in the Pali and the Prakrits which we have to notice, is that of the Sanskrit <strong>ऐ</strong> and <strong>औ</strong> to <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong>. Most of the nouns having <strong>ऐ</strong> and <strong>औ</strong> are in Sanskrit attributives formed from other nouns, and as these are formed in other ways in our language we cannot expect to find many instances of them. Still there are a good many, and enough to show that our vernaculars have inhe- rited these Pali and Prakrit transformations of the Sanskrit <strong>ऐ</strong> and <strong>औ</strong>.Thus:–</p>

<p>The Sanskrit syllables <strong>अय</strong> and<strong>अव</strong> are, you will remember, often changed to <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong> it in the Pali and the Prakrits. The following instances of this change have come down to the vernsculars :-</p>

<p>M. <strong>बोर</strong> jujube fruit Pr. <strong>बो</strong>र for <strong>बवर</strong> or <strong>बअर</strong>, Skr. <strong>बदर</strong>.</p>
<p>The Pali and the Prakrits on account of these changes lost the Sanskrit diphthongs <strong>ऐ</strong> and<strong>औ</strong>. But several of the vernaculars have got them back by combining the vowels <strong>अ</strong> and <strong>इ</strong>,and <strong>अ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong>, short or long, brought together by the elision of consonants in the Prakrits. A hiatus, which requires the intonated breath to be let off twice successively without being stopped or compressed, is mostly felt to be burdensome, and is in consequence avoided in several ways. Where the two vowels can combine into one sound, a diphthong is formed out of them. Thus <strong>ऐ</strong> and <strong>औ</strong> and<strong>औ</strong> are combinations of <strong>अइ</strong> and <strong>अउ</strong>. In pronouncing these last, the breath has to be emitted twice, while in sounding the former, the same current is first let off through the position of <strong>अ</strong>, and afterwards through that of <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong>. The first part of the diphthong is thus a very short <strong>अ</strong>, to which half a mātrā, as previously observed, has been allowed by the grammarians. The following are instances of this formation:—</p>
<p>[Table 14: अ and इ combined into ऐ]</p>
<p>skr. <strong>प्रविष्ट</strong> entered, Pr.<strong>पइठ्ठ</strong> , H. old M.<strong>पैठा.</strong></p>
<p>Skr. <strong>उपविश</strong> sit, Pr. <strong>उवइस</strong> M. H. <strong>वैमणें-ना</strong> by the dropping of the initial <strong>उ</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>उपविष्ट</strong> sat, Pr. <strong>उवइठ्ठ</strong> , H. P. <strong>बैठा</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>खदिर</strong> name of a tree, Pr. <strong>खइर</strong>, , M. P. H. <strong>खैर</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>कपित्थ</strong> name of a tree, Pr.<strong>कवित्थ</strong>, H. <strong>कैथ</strong> bydropping <strong>इ</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr.<strong>बलीवर्द</strong> a bull, Pr.<strong>बइल्ल</strong> , M. H. P. <strong>बैल.</strong></p>
<p>Skr. <strong>तादृश</strong> like that, Pr.<strong>तादिस</strong>, Apabhr, <strong>तइस</strong>, M. H. P.<strong>तैसा</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>महिषी</strong> a female buffalo, Pr.<strong>महीसी</strong>, M. <strong>ह्यैस</strong> H**. भैंस, P. मैंह;**or <strong>मैंस</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>भगिनी</strong> sister, Pr.<strong>भइणी</strong> , P. M. (dial.),<strong>भैण</strong> H.<strong>बैन</strong> (more commonly <strong>बहिन</strong>. )</p>

<p>Skr. <strong>पवित्रक</strong> holy thread, Pr. <strong>पवित्तअ</strong>, B. <strong>पैता</strong>.</p>
<p>In this manner the Hindi, Marathi and Panjabi combine <strong>अ</strong> and <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>ई</strong> into <strong>ऐ</strong>. Sometimes the <strong>ऐ</strong> so formed is dropped by the Marathi, and we have optionally <strong>बसणें</strong> for <strong>बैसणेंं</strong>, <strong>म्हस</strong> for <strong>म्हैस</strong> and <strong>तसा</strong> for <strong>तैसा</strong> . Bengali, and Oriya have <strong>बस</strong> for.<strong>बैस</strong>. The former has <strong>बैस</strong> in addition, so that these languages also seem to have once formed out of the two vowels.</p>
<p>[Table 15: अ and उ combined into औ ]</p>

<p>Skr. <strong>चतुष्क</strong> a squale, Pr. <strong>चउक्क</strong>, M. H. P. <strong>चौक</strong>. Similarly other compounds of <strong>चतुर्</strong>; <strong>चौरस</strong>, <strong>चौकोन, चौमास</strong> &amp;c., B. O.S. also have <strong>चौ</strong>.</p>

<p>Skr.<strong>वधू</strong> a girl, a daughter-in-law, Pr.<strong>बहु</strong> , O. <strong>बौ</strong>.</p>
<p>When sometimes the Prakrits combined <strong>अ</strong> and <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>अ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong>. they formed <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong> out of them. For, as we have seen, the passage from one position to another in the same breath was impossible to the speakers of the Prakrits and the Pali. Thus wel have <strong>मोर</strong> for <strong>मऊर</strong>, Skr. <strong>मयूर</strong>; <strong>थेर</strong> for <strong>थइर</strong>, Skr. <strong>स्थविर</strong> ;<strong>चोत्थ</strong> for <strong>चउत्थ</strong>, Skr. <strong>चतुर्थ</strong> ;<strong>चोग्गुण</strong> for <strong>चउग्गुण</strong>, Skr. <strong>चतुर्गुण</strong> &amp;o.</p>
<p>Similarly <strong>अय</strong> and <strong>अव</strong> form <strong>ऐ</strong> and <strong>औ</strong> in the vernaculars. When final <strong>अ</strong> of <strong>य</strong> and <strong>व</strong> is not pronounced, these semi-vowels easily pass into <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong> which with the previous <strong>अ</strong> form those diphthongs:—</p>
<p>[ Table 16: अय changed to ऐ ]</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>मदन</strong> god of love, Pr. <strong>मअण</strong> or <strong>मयण</strong>, H. <strong>मैन</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>रजनी</strong> night, Pr. <strong>रअणी</strong> or <strong>रयणी</strong>, H. P. <strong>रैन</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr <strong>नयन</strong> the eye, H. <strong>नैन</strong>, P. <strong>नैण</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>भय</strong> fear, H. P. <strong>भै</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>जय</strong> victory, H. P. <strong>जै</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>शत</strong> a hundred, Pr. <strong>सअ</strong> or, <strong>सय</strong>, H. P. <strong>सै</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr.<strong>वचन</strong> speech, Pr. <strong>वअण</strong> or <strong>वयण</strong>, H. <strong>बैन</strong>.</p>
<p>The Marathi does not follow the Hindi and Panjabi here. For, according to the modern way of pronunciation as observed before, the final of words not being pronounced, the vowel of the preceding syllable is lengthened. The <strong>अ</strong> of the first syllable of <strong>भय</strong>and <strong>जय</strong> being thus long, prevents the formation of; while that of being so in such words as <strong>नयन</strong> that semivowel is not reduced to <strong>इ ,</strong> and hence we have no <strong>ऐ</strong>. But these obstacles are set aside in the Hindi and the Panjabi, the tendency to form the diphthongs being strong. When however, the Marathi was in a state of formation it retained the Prakrit peculiarity and changed the syllable <strong>अय</strong> to <strong>ए</strong>, as in <strong>शें</strong> for <strong>शतम्</strong> , <strong>भे</strong>( old ) for <strong>भय</strong>, <strong>एं</strong> of neuter nouns such as <strong>केलें</strong> and <strong>ताम्बें</strong> for the <strong>अयं</strong> of the Prakrit <strong>केलयं</strong> and <strong>तम्बय,के</strong> and <strong>गे</strong> of <strong>केला</strong> and <strong>गेला</strong> for the Prakrit <strong>कय</strong> and <strong>गय</strong> ,&amp;c.This change is due to a weakened pronunciation of <strong>य</strong>. In modern times even <strong>य</strong> is often sounded like <strong>ए</strong>. For, in producing these two sounds the middle of the tongue being raised, the forepart. falls lower than in sounding <strong>इ</strong>. When, therefore, in pronouncing and <strong>य</strong>, the middle is not raised sufficiently high, the sound becomes <strong>ए</strong> and not <strong>इ</strong>, because this requires the forepart also to be raised higher.</p>
<p>Thus in the following instances <strong>अव</strong> changed to <strong>औ</strong>) :—</p>
<p><strong>[ Table 17: अव changed to औ ]</strong></p>
<p>Skr. <strong>धबल</strong> white, Pr. <strong>धवल</strong>, H. P. <strong>धौला</strong>, M. <strong>धवला</strong>.</p>

<p>Here the Panjabi and the Hindi agree perfectly; but the Marathi is not decided, sometimes changing the syllable to <strong>ओ</strong> but more often. for the reasons given in the case of <strong>अय</strong>, retaining it as it is in the original, the <strong>अव</strong>, however, being pronounced like <strong>अव</strong> in some cases, and <strong>अव</strong> with long final <strong>अ</strong> in others. Hindi and Panjabi similarly treat <strong>आइ</strong> or <strong>आई</strong> and <strong>आय</strong> and <strong>आउ</strong> or <strong>आऊ</strong> and <strong>आव</strong> , while the Marathi here completely parts from them. For the <strong>आ</strong> in these syllables is too strong a sound for the Marathi ear to pass off into the very short <strong>अ</strong> of half a mātrā. Even the Hindi preserves <strong>आय</strong> unchanged in a good many cases, as <strong>बाय</strong> for Pr. <strong>वाय</strong>, Skr. <strong>वात</strong> &lsquo;wind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Skr. <strong>भाद्रपद</strong> &amp;c. in which <strong>अइ</strong> forms <strong>ए</strong>. and <strong>अउ</strong> and <strong>अव</strong>, <strong>ओ</strong>; but it will appear that the prevailing rule in that language and in the Panjabi is to change these vowels and semi-vowels into <strong>ऐ</strong> or <strong>औ</strong>. The Braj dialect of Hindi is thoroughly consistent in this respect, having <strong>ऐ</strong> and <strong>औ</strong> even in its grammatical terminations, as <strong>कौ</strong> for High H. <strong>को, करै</strong> for <strong>करे, करौं</strong> for <strong>करूं, करौ</strong> for <strong>करो</strong>, &amp;c. The Marathi agrees with these dialects perfectly only as respects <strong>अ + इ</strong> and <strong>अ+उ</strong>; and the Bengali and Oriya, if we look to the few traces, that they have retained of these Prakrit syllables, seem to agree with the Marathi. But the Gujarati has throughout <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong> for the Hindi and Panjabi <strong>ऐ</strong> and <strong>औ</strong> ; and the Sindhi follows the Gujarati a great way. The Gujarati and Sindhi forms of the words occurring in tables 14-19, are as follows:–</p>

<p>Similarly, though a few Sanskrit words containing <strong>ऐ</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong> do occur in Gujarati dictionaries, these diphthongs are generally pronounced like <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong> as in <strong>जने</strong> for <strong>जैन</strong> ’a follower of the Jaina sec’,<strong>वेर</strong> for <strong>वैर</strong>&rsquo;enmity&rsquo;, &amp;c. The Gujarati, therefore, like the old Prakrits combines <strong>अय</strong> and <strong>अव</strong> and <strong>अइ</strong> and <strong>अउ</strong> into <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong> and since it did not receive the diphthongs <strong>ऐ</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong> from the old Prakrits, its alphabet really does not contain them. As observed before, the syllables <strong>अइ</strong> and <strong>अउ</strong> differ from <strong>ऐ</strong> and <strong>औ</strong> only in two currents of breath being emitted instead of one, in other respects they are alike, both the vowel sounds being contained in the diphthongs. Those syllables as well as <strong>अय</strong> and <strong>अव</strong> should, therefore, naturally pass into those diphthongs as involving the least possible change. If, notwithstanding, the Gujarati people make <strong>ए</strong> or <strong>ओ</strong> out of them, and also give those forms to the <strong>ऐ</strong> and <strong>औ</strong> of Sanskrit and foreign words, it must be so, because their vocal organs are in this respect in the same condition as those of their Pali and Prakrit ancestors. On the other hand, the Hindi, and especially the Braj form of it, presents the old Aryan tendency of pronouncing the diphthongs in somewhat exaggerated form; while the other dialects take up a position between these two in this respect.</p>
<p>Of the words in which an open vowel is changed to one more close, and an approach towards an assimilation to a consonant is thus effected, the vernaculars have preserved the following:–</p>

<p>In a great many more instances,<strong>अ</strong> is thus changed in the vernaculars, and not only before conjuncts as is mostly the case in the Prakrits, but before simple consonants also.</p>
<p>[Table 23 : अ changed to इ in Sindhi]</p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>The Sindhi has the largest number of instances, and this change of <strong>अ</strong> to <strong>इ</strong> constitutes a peculiarity of that language. The Hindi has got a good many, and the Panjabi follows it in almost all cases. Marathi has but a few stray instances, but sometimes, as in <strong>शिवणें</strong> &rsquo;to touch’, H. <strong>छूना</strong>, Skr. <strong>छुप</strong>, but Pr. <strong>छिव</strong>, and in <strong>मिशी</strong>, <strong>इ</strong> takes the place of <strong>उ</strong> also.</p>
<p>The Gujarati has <strong>पिंगलवुं</strong> for <strong>प्रगलनम्</strong> and <strong>ईण्डुं</strong> &lsquo;an egg&rsquo;, for <strong>अण्डकम्</strong> but not many more cases. Bengali and Oriya have also but few instances, and even in most of these, and in those of the Marathi as well as in the Hindi <strong>पिंजरा</strong> and <strong>जिमना</strong>, the <strong>इ</strong> may be regarded as arising from the influence of the neighbouring palatal consonant.</p>
<p>The following are instances in which <strong>अ</strong>, and in one case <strong>आ</strong>, are changed to <strong>ए</strong> :—</p>
<p>[ Table 24</p>
<p>:</p>
<p>अ and आ changed to ए ]</p>

<p>But even here the <strong>ए</strong> of the Marathi <strong>शेवरी, शेण,जेवणें</strong>, and <strong>उजेड</strong>, as of the Hindi,<strong>जेवना</strong> may be attributed to the influence of the preceding palatal.</p>
<p>In the Prakrits there are two instances of the change of <strong>अ</strong> to <strong>उ</strong>, viz. <strong>चुड</strong>and <strong>खुडिओ</strong> for Skr. <strong>चण्ड</strong> &lsquo;fierce‛and <strong>सण्डित</strong> ‛plucked out‛. The latter we have in the vernaculars in the form of <strong>खूट</strong> M. G., <strong>खुटि</strong> S. ‛deficiency‛<strong>खोट</strong> H., <strong>खोड</strong> M. ‛blemish‛and <strong>खुडणें</strong> or <strong>खुटणें</strong> M., <strong>खुटना</strong> H., <strong>खुंटवुं</strong> G. ‛to pluck put‛or <strong>खुटवुं</strong> G. ‛to be deficient‛. The Bengali changes <strong>अ</strong> to <strong>उ</strong> in a good many casesas:—</p>

<p>And where the Sanskrit or the sister dialects have <strong>ओ</strong> , the Bengali has <strong>उ</strong> as in the following words:—</p>
<p>[Table 26 : Skr ओ sit changed to उ in Bengali ]</p>
<p>B. <strong>चुरि</strong> theft, Skr. <strong>चोरिका</strong>, M. H. <strong>चोरी</strong>.</p>
<p>B. <strong>मुचि</strong> a shoemaker, M. H. <strong>मोची</strong>.</p>
<p>B. <strong>पुलि</strong> cake, Skr. <strong>पोलिका</strong> or <strong>पुलिका.</strong> M. <strong>पाली</strong>.</p>
<p>B. <strong>छुडी</strong> a girl, G, <strong>छोडी</strong>.</p>
<p>B. <strong>पु्डन</strong> burning, M. <strong>पोलणें</strong>.</p>
<p>B. <strong>खुदन</strong> digging, H. <strong>खोदना</strong>, M. <strong>खोद</strong>णें.</p>
<p>B. <strong>खुज</strong>न searching, H. <strong>खोजना</strong>.</p>
<p>Thus <strong>उ</strong>, whether for <strong>अ</strong> or <strong>ओ</strong> , is a characteristic of the Bengali.But this characteristic is very likely connected connected with another which distinguishes the Bengali language, viz., to pronounce the non-final <strong>अ</strong> in all cases as a short and broad <strong>ओ</strong> like that in the English word <em>pot.</em> I have observed before that the assimilation of vowels to consonants might be affected by narrowing the passage of the breath by an upward movement of the tongue near the palatal position, or by rounding the lips. Which of these modes is resorted to, depends on the peculiar vocal tendencies of &amp; people. Thus then, to change <strong>अ</strong> to <strong>ए</strong> or <strong>इ</strong> is a peculiarity of the Sindhi, the Panjabi, and the Hindi, and to short <strong>ओ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong> of the Bengali.</p>
<p>The following Prakrit instances of the assimilation of the different vowels of a word have come down to the vernaculars:—</p>
<p>[Table 27 : Assimilation of different vowels of a word]</p>
<p>M. G. P. <strong>वेल</strong> a creeper, H.P. <strong>वेल</strong>, Pr.<strong>वेल्ली</strong>, Skr. <strong>वल्लि</strong>. S.<strong>वल्लि</strong> , Pr.<strong>वल्ली.</strong></p>
<p>M <strong>ऊंस</strong>. sugarcane, H.<strong>ऊख</strong> , Pr. <strong>ऊच्छू</strong>, Skr. <strong>इक्षु</strong>. H. has <strong>इख</strong> also, and P. <strong>इक्ख</strong>.</p>
<p>H. P. S. <strong>सेज</strong> a bed, M. G.<strong>शेज</strong>, Pr.<strong>सेज्जा</strong> , Skr. <strong>शय्या</strong>.</p>
<p>M. <strong>मिरीं</strong>, S. <strong>मिरी</strong> pepper, Pr. <strong>मिरिअं</strong>, Skr, <strong>मरिचम्.</strong></p>
<p>M. <strong>ओपणें</strong> to give over, sssign, Pr. <strong>ओप्प</strong>, Skr. <strong>अर्प</strong>.</p>
<p>There are a few modern instances as in:—</p>
<p>[Table 28: the Assimilation of vowels]</p>
<p>S. <strong>मोहि</strong> a buffalo, Pr. <strong>महिस</strong>.</p>
<p>H, <strong>इम्ली</strong> tamarind tree, Skr. <strong>अम्लि</strong>का.</p>

<p>P. <strong>उंगुल</strong> or <strong>उंगुली</strong> a finger, Skr.<strong>अङ्गुलि</strong>.</p>
<p>Examples of the change of <strong>अ</strong> to <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>ए</strong> under the influence of a palatal consonant have been given in Table 24.</p>
<p>Of the words in which one of two similar vowels is made dissimilar or changed to अ in the Prakrits the vernaculars have preserved the following :—</p>
<p>[Table 29: Dissimilation of vowels]</p>
<p>Skr.<strong>बिभीतक</strong>, Pr., &amp;c., as in table 8.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>हरीतकी</strong> myrobalan, Pr. <strong>हरडई</strong>, M. <strong>हरडी</strong>, S. <strong>हरी</strong>ड.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>मुकुटः</strong>a crown, Pr, <strong>मउडो</strong>, H. <strong>मौड</strong>, G. <strong>मोड</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>मुकुल</strong>: a bud, Pr. <strong>मउलो</strong>, P. <strong>मौल</strong> in <strong>मौलना</strong> to bud.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>शिथिलम्</strong> loose, Pr. <strong>सडिलं</strong> or <strong>सिडिलं</strong>, M. <strong>सढल</strong> in the sense of &rsquo;loose of hand&rsquo; or &rsquo;liberal&rsquo;, H. B. O. <strong>ढीला</strong>, S.<strong>डिरो</strong> or <strong>डरो</strong>, G. <strong>डीलुं</strong> In these the first syllable in elided.</p>
<p>Sindhi has <strong>हिलिडो</strong> also for<strong>सिडिल</strong> in which tha last two consonants have interchanged places <strong>स्</strong> and is changed to</p>
<p><strong>द्</strong>.</p>
<p>Moders instances of this change are:—</p>
<p>[Table 30: Dissimilation of Vowels]</p>
<p>M. <strong>उंदीर</strong> rat, G. <strong>उंदर</strong>, H. B. O. <strong>इंदूर</strong>, Skr. <strong>उन्दुरु</strong>.</p>
<p>H. B. <strong>चूंची</strong> nipple, Skr. <strong>चूचुकम्</strong>.</p>
<p>H. <strong>गेहूं , घेऊं</strong>, or <strong>गोहूं</strong>wheat, P. <strong>घेऊं</strong>, G. <strong>घऊं</strong>, M. <strong>गहूं</strong> or <strong>गंव</strong>, B. <strong>गम</strong>, O, <strong>गहम</strong>, Skr. <strong>गोधूम</strong>.</p>

<p>H, P. <strong>जनेऊ</strong>, from <strong>जण्णोऊअ</strong>, Pr. <strong>जण्णोवईअ</strong>?, Skr.<strong>यज्ञोपवीत.</strong></p>
<p>Here, as well as in the Prakrits, one of the two similar vowels is oftener changed to <strong>अ</strong> than to <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>उ</strong>.</p>
<p>In the Prakrits, you will remember, there are a few instances in which the vowels of the different syllables composing a word exchange places, or the close vowel of one is transferred to another. Of these the M. has <strong>विंचू</strong> &lsquo;scorpion&rsquo;, H. and P. <strong>बिच्छु</strong>, S. <strong>विछुं</strong>and B. and O. <strong>बिछा</strong>. There are a good many more modern instances.</p>
<p>[Table 31: Transposition of Vowels]</p>
<p>H. <strong>अकेला</strong> slone, Pr. <strong>एकल्लअ</strong>.</p>
<p>H. <strong>उंगली</strong> huger, Skr. <strong>अङ्गुली</strong>.</p>
<p>H. P. <strong>मौत</strong> a death, from such a Pr. form as <strong>मत्तु</strong>, Skr.<strong>मृत्यु</strong>; the <strong>उ</strong>beingtransferred to the preceding syllable, forms <strong>औ</strong>with <strong>अ</strong> ; G. <strong>मोत</strong>.</p>
<p>H. <strong>हौले</strong> slowly, from Pr. <strong>हलु</strong>, Skr. <strong>लघु</strong>.</p>
<p>P. <strong>कौडा</strong>bitter, from Pr.<strong>कडुअ</strong>Skr. <strong>कटुक</strong>.</p>
<p>H. M. S.<strong>बूंद</strong>, G. P. <strong>बुंद</strong>, Skr. <strong>बिन्दु</strong>, the <strong>इ</strong> transferred to the second</p>

<p>G. <strong>केड</strong> the waist, Skr. <strong>कटि</strong>.</p>
<p>G. <strong>पीरसवुं</strong>to distribute food, from Skr. <strong>परिवेष</strong>.</p>
<p>G. <strong>बनेवी</strong> sister&rsquo;s husband, <strong>बने</strong> for <strong>बेन</strong> sister, Pr. <strong>भइणी</strong>, and <strong>वी</strong>for <strong>वई</strong>, Skr. <strong>पति</strong>.</p>
<p>B. <strong>शेल</strong> a dart, from Skr. <strong>शल्य</strong>, the <strong>इ</strong>arising from the softening of <strong>य</strong>, being transferred to <strong>श</strong>.</p>
<p>P. <strong>पुर</strong>above, Skr.<strong>उपरी</strong>.</p>
<p>M. <strong>ओंजल</strong> a cavity made by joining the hands, from the word <strong>अंजुली</strong>existing in old Marathi,      and <strong>अंजुली</strong>existing in H. made up on the analogy of the Skr. <strong>अङ्गुलि</strong>.</p>
<p>M. <strong>हिरवा</strong>green from Skr. <strong>हरित</strong> or <strong>हरितक</strong>.</p>
<p>M. <strong>चोंच</strong> a beak, M. (dial.) and B. <strong>टोंच</strong>, Skr.<strong>चंचु</strong>.</p>
<p>Of the Prakrit words with a syllable lengthened or shortened through the influence of an accent of some sort, the vernaculars have preserved a few words. Thus:—</p>
<p>[Table 32: Shortoning of syllables through accent]</p>
<p>M. <strong>पाडवा</strong> the 1st day of the moon&rsquo;s increase, Pr. <strong>पाडिवो</strong>, Skr. <strong>प्रतिपद्</strong> H. has the form with short <strong>प</strong>, <strong>पडिवा</strong>.</p>
<p>M. <strong>सारिखा</strong> like, Pr. <strong>सारिच्छो</strong>or <strong>सारिक्खो</strong> ?, Skr. <strong>सदृक्षः</strong>.</p>
<p>M. <strong>हल्या</strong> &amp; buffalo used for ploughing, Pr. <strong>हलिओ</strong> H. P. <strong>हाली</strong> one who ploughs, Pr. <strong>हालिओ</strong>,        Skr.<strong>हालिक</strong>.</p>
<p>H. <strong>गहिरा</strong> deep, Fr. <strong>गहिरो</strong>, Skr. <strong>गभीरः</strong>.</p>
<p>G. <strong>कुंवर</strong>, H. <strong>कुंबर</strong> or <strong>कुंअर</strong>, Pr. <strong>कुमरो</strong>, Skr. <strong>कुमा</strong>र.</p>
<p>ACCENT IN MODERN VERNACULARS</p>
<p>In modern vernacular pronunciation, there is a law of accentuation, which has produced important results. The penultimate syllable of a word is, in all our dialects, pronounced with a stress,</p>
<p>the tendency of which is to lengthen that syllable and drop the final vowel. In most of them, this tendency has worked itself out thoroughly. The preceding vowel, however, is not always written. long, but still the long or at least the emphasized pronunciation does exist. I have already given <a href="http://#" title="Pp. 394ff.">instances</a> in which while the final <strong>अ</strong> is silent or dropped, the<strong>इ</strong>or <strong>उ</strong>of the preceding syllable is lengthened, and have shown that when that syllable has , it also is pronounced long though not changed to <strong>आ</strong>. The final <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>उ</strong>of Sanskrit words, recently imported into the languages, have been dropped in virtue of this law of accentuation. Thus :—</p>
<p>[Table 33: Skr, इ final dropped through accent]</p>
<p>M. H. G. <strong>पद्धत</strong> method, mode, Skr. <strong>पद्धति</strong>.</p>
<p>M. H. G. P. <strong>गत</strong>condition, Skr. <strong>गति</strong>.</p>
<p>M. G. <strong>विपत</strong>, H. P. <strong>बिपत</strong> misery, Skr. <strong>विपत्ति</strong>.</p>
<p>M. H. P. G. B. <strong>रीत</strong> manner, Skr. <strong>रीति</strong>.</p>
<p>M. H. G. P. B <strong>जात</strong> species, caste, Skr. <strong>जाति</strong>.</p>
<p>M. H. <strong>कीर्ति</strong>,H.G. P. <strong>कीरतं</strong>.fame, Skr. <strong>कीर्त्ति</strong>.</p>
<p>M. H. P. G. <strong>रास</strong> a heap, Skr. <strong>राशि</strong>.</p>
<p>M. H. P. <strong>उपाध</strong> injury, annoyance, Skr. <strong>उपाधि</strong>.</p>
<p>M. H. P. G. <strong>नीत</strong> morality, Skr <strong>नीति</strong>.</p>
<p>H. P. <strong>कब</strong>a poet, Skr. <strong>कवि</strong>.</p>
<p>M. G.<strong>वस्त</strong>, H. P. <strong>बस्त</strong>a thing, Skr.<strong>वस्तु</strong>.</p>
<p>H. P. <strong>साध</strong>a good man, Skr. <strong>साधु</strong>.</p>
<p>M. G. H. P. <strong>मध</strong>honey, Skr. <strong>मधु</strong>.</p>
<p>Bengali and Oriya authors hardly represent the proper vernacular pronunciation. Such words as the above, therefore, do not but probably they do exist. In Sindhi, however, here as well as in other instances to be given, the tendency of this law of accentuation is but partially realised, and such of the above words, as exist in that language, preserve their Sanskrit endings; as <strong>राहि</strong>, or <strong>रासि, जाति, रीति,</strong> &amp;c. Not only does this law characterise the vernacular speech of the day, but it must have been in &lsquo;operation for centuries, since the old Prakrit words, which like. the above, have not recently been imported, but have descended</p>
<p>to the modern languages from the spoken dialects af ancient times, have also been similarly ohanged, Thus:—</p>

<p>Here also the Sindhi preserves the old endings in some cases, and has dropped them in others. In this manner, the final <strong>आ, इ, ई, उ</strong> and
<strong>ऊ</strong> of Sanskrit and Prakrit nouns have been dropped in the vernaculars or changed to a silent <strong>अ</strong>.</p>
<p>Final <strong>ओ</strong> is similarly treated. Even in the Apabhraṁśa period, this rule of accentuation must have prevailed, since the ending vowels are similarly shortened in a good many cases. You will remember that the Prakrit <strong>ओ</strong> of the nominative singular of masculine nouns is mostly shortened to <strong>उ</strong> in that dialect, and sometimes altogether dropped. The modern vernaculars have thus got a great many masculine nouns ending in the silent <strong>अ</strong>, such ss <strong>हात</strong> or <strong>हाथ</strong> &lsquo;hand&rsquo;, <strong>कान</strong> &rsquo;ear&rsquo;, <strong>दांत</strong> &rsquo;tooth&rsquo;, <strong>धीट</strong> &lsquo;bold&rsquo;, <strong>वड</strong> &rsquo;the Bunyan tree&rsquo;, &amp;c. But as before, the Sindhi has in all these. cases preserved the <strong>उ</strong>; as <strong>हथु, कनु, दंतु, डीटु पहु,</strong> &amp;c.</p>
<p>When the final vowel is preceded by another and not by a consonant as in the words just mentioned and in others given. in the above lists, that other vowel being accented by our rule shows a tendency to become long, and the original unaccented final being dropped, the accented vowel becomes final.

<p>Thus then the Sanskrit Prakrit penultimate vowels become final in the vernaculars, and being originally accented in consequence of the law we have been considering, retain that accent in most cases, and are thus lengthened. When the penultimate happens to be <strong>अ</strong> it is lengthened to <strong>आ</strong> as in the following:—</p>

<p>It may be urged that in modern prcnunciation when the penultimate <strong>अ</strong> is accented, it does not become <strong>आ</strong> even though pronounced long, as observed before. How is it then that it becomes <strong>आ</strong> here? In modern times several new modes of pronunciation have arisen, but as regards the matter in hand, to lengthen <strong>अ</strong> into <strong>आ</strong> was the old process. And often when the old processes have disappeared from what is considered the standerd form of a language, they are found preserved in some dialect of that language. Thus, while in the standard Marathi the penultimate <strong>अ</strong> is simply pronounced long, it becomes आ in the Goanese and Malvani dialects.<br>

<p>In this manner, then, the penultimate <strong>अ</strong> in consequence of the accent became <strong>आ</strong>, and the final <strong>उ</strong> and the <strong>अ</strong> of the final <strong>अं</strong> being dropped, itself became final, and has preserved its accent.</p>
<p>An unaccented <strong>अ, आ</strong>, or <strong>उ</strong> is, you will have observed from the above instances, dropped after a close or dissimilar vowel. For, if preserved, its effect would be to change the preceding close vowel to the corresponding semi-vowel. But being accented, that vowel resists the influence and in its turn overpowers the unaccented, and consequently weak, vowel. But when it is possible to combine both into one sound the final is sometimes not dropped.</p>
<p>Thus the <strong>अ</strong> stand <strong>उ</strong> in the above examples are combined into <strong>ओ</strong> in the Gujarati, the Sindhi, and the Goanese, Malvani, and Chitpavni dialects of the Marathi, and the Marvari, Mevari, Kumaoni, and Garhavali dialects of the Hindi; and we have <strong>घोडो, पारो, आंवलो</strong>, or <strong>आंवलो, आंबाडी, बेहडो, कांटो, गोलो, सालो, दिवो, मांचो्,</strong> and <strong>किडो</strong>.</p>
<p>When <strong>अ</strong> follows anothe <strong>आ</strong> , the former, you will remember, is generally changed to a light <strong>य</strong> in the Prakrits. Those dialects tolerated a hiatus when one or both of the vowels were close. But <strong>अ</strong> or <strong>आ</strong> followed by <strong>अ</strong> or <strong>आ</strong> required two complete openings of the mouth, which could not be borne, and hence a close sound <strong>ए</strong> was interposed. Thus <strong>मत्थअं</strong> and <strong>कडअं</strong> , in the above, became <strong>मत्थयं</strong> and <strong>कछयं</strong>, and the <strong>य</strong> being almost as light as the vowel <strong>इ</strong> and being unaccented, is dropped in the Malvani and the other dialects; but in the standard Marathi, as formerly observed, the <strong>अ</strong> and <strong>यं</strong> are combined into <strong>एं</strong>, and so we have <strong>मायें</strong> and <strong>कडें</strong>.</p>
<p>In the Apabhramsa, you will remember, the masculine termination <strong>उ</strong> is transferred by analogy to neuter nouns, and Hemacandra tells us that neuter nouns having a <strong>क</strong> at the end do not drop their nasal termination. Thus, we have <strong>मत्थउं</strong> and <strong>कडउं</strong> from which by combination we have the Gujarati <strong>माथूं</strong> and <strong>कडूं</strong>. Here the nasal sound gives a sort of fixity to the vowel, and hence it does not pass into <strong>ओ</strong> as in the case of masculine nouns, but absorbs the preceding <strong>अ</strong>. The <strong>ओ, एं</strong> and <strong>उ</strong> thus formed are accented like the <strong>आ</strong> of the masculine nouns in the Marathi and others, since they contain the accented penultimate.</p>
<p>Similarly, final unaccented <strong>इ</strong> is not dropped after <strong>अ</strong> or <strong>आ</strong>, but is slurred over and the least possible time is allowed to it, in consequence of which it sounds like the consonant <strong>ए</strong>, and thus forms a sort of diphthong with the preceding <strong>अ</strong> or <strong>आ</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>[Table 38 A: Pr. final changed to य् ]</strong></p>
<p>M. <strong>वह</strong> or <strong>वय्</strong>hedge, Pr. <strong>वइ</strong>, Skr. <strong>वृति</strong>.</p>

<p>M. <strong>शेणवइ</strong>or <strong>य</strong> name of acaste, Pr. <strong>सेणावइ</strong>, Skr. <strong>सेनापति</strong>.</p>
<p>H. <strong>बहनोइ</strong>sister&rsquo;s husband, Pr. <strong>भइणीवइ</strong>, Skr. <strong>भगिनीपति</strong>.</p>
<p>Sometimes the final vowel <strong>इ</strong> absorbs the preceding <strong>अ</strong>; as in</p>
<p>[Table 38 B: Pr. final इ merged in preceding अ]</p>
<p>G. <strong>बनेवी</strong> for <strong>बहनोइ</strong>.</p>
<p>M. <strong>शेणवी</strong>.</p>
<p>M. <strong>दलवी</strong> for Pr. <strong>दलवइ</strong>, Skr <strong>दलपति</strong>.</p>
<p>You will have seen that the Sanskrit nouns, composed of three or more syllables, given in Table 36, with <strong>अ</strong> at for their penultimate. vowel and <strong>क</strong>or any other similar syllable ending in for the final, have dropped one syllable and become nouns ending in <strong>आ</strong> in Marathi, Hindi, Panjabi, and Bengali, and in Oriya also in some cases, and in <strong>ओ</strong>in Gujarati, Sindhi, and in the dialects of the Marathi and Hindi spoken of above. Such of them as are neuter have acquired the ending <strong>एं</strong> or <strong>आं</strong>in Marathi and in <strong>ऊं</strong> in Gujarati.</p>
<p>But these are not the only nouns with a final <strong>आ</strong>and <strong>ओ</strong>and <strong>एं, आं</strong>and <strong>ऊं</strong> in these languages. There are a good many more, both substantives and adjectives, which have these endings. In the Brajabhāṣa also a great many adjectives, nominal and verbal, end in <strong>ओ</strong>or <strong>औ</strong>. The Sanskrit words from which they are derived. are not composed of three syllables, with <strong>क</strong> or another syllable like it preceded by an <strong>अ</strong>, as the final. Thus the substantives H. M. <strong>श्चेला</strong> ‘adisciple&rsquo;, <strong>पुडा</strong>&lsquo;a parcel&rsquo;, <strong>काढा</strong> &rsquo; a decoction, and the adjectives H. <strong>नीला</strong>,M. <strong>निला</strong>&lsquo;blue&rsquo; H. <strong>पीला</strong>, M.<strong>पिलला</strong> ’yellow&rsquo;, and past participles, H. <strong>गया</strong> &lsquo;gone&rsquo;, <strong>मुवा</strong>&lsquo;dead&rsquo;, M.<strong>गेला, मेला</strong>&amp;c., and the corresponding Gujarati, <strong>चेलो, पुढो, काढो, नीलो, पीलो, गयो</strong> and <strong>मुवो</strong>,are</p>
<p>derived from the Sanskrit <strong>चेटः, पुटः, क्वाथः,नीलः, पीतलः</strong>, &amp;c. Similarly such neuter nouns as M. <strong>केलें</strong>(dial.<strong>केलां</strong>), G.<strong>केलुं</strong>M. (dial. <strong>सोनां</strong>), G.<strong>सोनूं</strong> are derived from the Skr. <strong>कदलम्</strong>and <strong>सुवर्णम्</strong>. How then did they get their <strong>आ</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong>and <strong>आं, एं</strong> and <strong>ऊं</strong> ?</p>
<p>A great many nouns in our languages end in , which has now become silent; and these, as I have explained, are derived from the Sanskrit nouns ending in <strong>अ</strong>, the nominative termination being, because it was unaccented, at first reduced to<strong>उ</strong> and afterwards dropped in most of them, but preserved in Sindhi. By that same law of accentuation which brought about the elision of this <strong>ओ</strong>, we have seen, that nouns ending in <strong>क</strong> or such othersyllable preceded by <strong>अ</strong>come to have <strong>आ-ओ</strong> and <strong>एं-आं-ऊं</strong> for their final. By an obvious inference, therefore, those other substantives and adjectives also must have got <strong>कः</strong>or <strong>कम्</strong> in the Prakrits and the Apabhraṁśa in the forms of <strong>ओ</strong> or <strong>अं</strong>and <strong>उ</strong>or <strong>उं</strong>, though in Sanskrit they do not possess them.</p>
<p>The suffix <strong>क</strong>, though actually found in certain words only in Sanskrit, must have been largely used in the spoken language of ancient times, since Pāṇini and his expositors allow of its being appended to all nouns and even verbs and participles, to indicate <a href="http://#" title="Pāṇini, V. 3. 85, 86; V. 4. 4.">littleness</a>, <a href="http://#" title="Pāṇini, V. 3. 74, 75,">contempt</a>, <a href="http://#" title="Pāṇini, V.3. 76, 77.">tenderness</a>, the state of being <a href="http://#" title="Pāṇini, V. 3. 73.">unknown</a>, resemblance or <a href="http://#" title="Pāṇini, V. 3. 96, 97.">copy</a>, and a <a href="http://#" title="Pāṇini, V. 3. 75, 87, 97.">species</a> founded on some of theseparticularities. Words formed by the addition of such a suffix in such senses cannot, of course, be much used in literary works. They are adapted for colloquial purposes, such as our Marathi Pāṇinifor Rama and Pāṇinifor Govinda are.</p>
<p>Accordingly, in the Prakrits and Apabhraṃśa, which were derived from the spoken languages, we find the practice of adding the suffix to be very common. Thus in the fourth act of the Vikramorvaśīwe have Pāṇinifor Pāṇiniformed from the analogy of Pāṇini but properly Pāṇini for Pāṇini</p>
<p>for <strong>युगलकम्</strong>; <strong>जुआणओ</strong> for <strong>युवकः</strong>; <strong>आणत्तओ</strong>for <strong>आज्ञप्तकः</strong>; <strong>परिमंथरओ</strong> for <strong>परिमन्थरकः</strong>; <strong>काननए</strong> for <strong>काननके</strong>; <strong>कुसुमुज्जलए</strong> for <strong>कुसुमोज्ज्वलके</strong>; <strong>लालसओ</strong>for <strong>लालसकः</strong>; <strong>परवारणओ</strong>for <strong>परवारणक</strong>;<strong>लीणओ</strong> for <strong>लीनक</strong>:; <strong>गइन्दओ</strong> for <strong>गजेन्द्रकः</strong>and many others. So also in Hemacandra&rsquo;s quotations from Apabhraṁśaworks, we have <strong>घडिअउ</strong>for <strong>घटितकः</strong>; <strong>विप्पिअयारउ</strong> for <strong>विप्रियकारकः</strong>; <strong>उड्डावन्तिअए</strong> for <strong>उद्रावयन्तिकया</strong>; <strong>दिट्टउ</strong> for <strong>दृष्टकः</strong>; <strong>वल्लहउं</strong>for <strong>बल्लभकम्</strong>;<strong>मुअउ</strong>for <strong>मृतकः</strong> &amp;c.</p>
<p>Now the question is, why is it that certain nouns only which have <strong>आ</strong>and <strong>ओ</strong>or <strong>आं</strong>,<strong>एं</strong>, and <strong>उं</strong> in our vernaculars had <strong>क</strong> appended to them in the Prakrits and not others? The suffix was used only where some additional sense was intended to be expressed. Hence there were some words to which it was not appended at all, and of those to which it was two forms existed, of which the one augmented had unaugmented sense. And in our modern dialects a good many words have these two forms, and of these that with <strong>आ</strong>conveys an additional sense, such as is attributed to <strong>क</strong> by the Sanskrit grammarians.</p>
<p>Thus <strong>दांत</strong> in Marathi expresses &amp; &rsquo;tooth&rsquo; but <strong>दांता</strong>a copy of the animal tooth, that is, &rsquo;the tooth’ of such an instrument as a saw; <strong>मेल</strong> signifies &lsquo;union&rsquo; &lsquo;agreement&rsquo;, but <strong>मेला</strong> expresses a certain union, viz., a concourse of people in a fair or on some festive occasion; <strong>कोंपर</strong> signifies t&rsquo;he elbow&rsquo;,but <strong>कोंपरा</strong>any corner, resembling that made by the elbow; <strong>दोर</strong>means &lsquo;a string’, generally, but <strong>दोरा</strong>a particular string, that is, &rsquo;thread&rsquo; used for sewing, <strong>पाट</strong>denotes generally &lsquo;a strip,&lsquo;and thence the piece of wood used for sitting on, but <strong>पाटा</strong>a slab of stone used for pounding spices; <strong>फांस</strong> signifies &lsquo;a noose’, generally, but <strong>फांसा</strong>a snare for birds or beasts, and also ’a catch,&rsquo; for fastening anything. In the Hindi, Panjabi and Gujarati <strong>बांस</strong>or <strong>वांस</strong>means a bamboo, as does <strong>बांसु</strong>in Sindhi; but in Marathi <strong>वांसा</strong>means &lsquo;a bambu used as a rafter&rsquo; and thence a rafter generally, &amp;c. In Marathi and Hindi <strong>गाभ</strong>signifies‘foetus&rsquo; or &lsquo;womb, but <strong>गाभा</strong> the internal spadix or fruit-receptacle of the plantain-tree or the core or heart of anything. The Panjabi <strong>गम्भ</strong> and <strong>गंब्भा</strong> also mean ‘the womb&rsquo; and the heart or core of anything respectively.</p>
<p>Thus then <strong>क</strong> was appended to a word in the Prakrits to denote some additional sense; and both the augmented and unaugmentedforms of it were in use; and these in some cases have descended to the vernaculars. But in the course of time, in consequence of the frequent use of the augmented forms, the things expressed by the unaugmented words came to be thought of with the addi. tional property, to denote which the <strong>क</strong> was in the first instance affixed. Hence the forms without <strong>क</strong>went out of use, gradually those with it lost the additional sense. It was not possible to preserve this sense except by a comparison with the signification of the unaugmented forms. But as these disappeared, the comparison was impossible. And in some cases the additional sense was so slight, that in the course of time it gradually dropped away, though the two forms of the word did exist. Thus wel have in &rsquo; Marathi <strong>चूर</strong> or <strong>चुरा</strong> &lsquo;fragments&rsquo;, <strong>घेर</strong> or <strong>घेरा</strong>&lsquo;circumference&rsquo;, <strong>खांद</strong> or <strong>खांदा</strong> &rsquo;the shoulder&rsquo;, <strong>जोड</strong> or <strong>जोडा</strong> &lsquo;a pair,&rsquo; <strong>भूस</strong> or <strong>भुसा</strong>&lsquo;chaff’, and others; but there is no preceptible difference in the sense of the two forms, though in the last three cases usage has restricted one of them to one state of things and the other to another. So also one of our dialects has the augmented form, and another the original, the sense being the same.Thus:—</p>
<p>[Table 39: Augmented and unaugmented forms of the same words]</p>
<p>B. <strong>बड</strong>, H. P. <strong>बडा</strong>large or great.</p>
<p>M. <strong>खेल</strong>, H. P. <strong>खेल</strong>, B. <strong>खेला</strong> a play.</p>
<p>H. <strong>दहीना</strong>, B. <strong>डाइन</strong>, O <strong>डाहाण</strong> right hand,</p>
<p>M. <strong>खांब</strong>, M. (dial.) <strong>खांबो,</strong> G. <strong>खंभ</strong>, H. P. <strong>खंभ</strong> or<strong>खंभा</strong>, B. <strong>खंबा</strong>, O, <strong>खंब</strong>apillar.</p>
<p>B. <strong>आम</strong>, H. <strong>आम</strong> or <strong>आम्ब</strong>, P. <strong>अंब</strong>, M. <strong>आंबा</strong>, G. <strong>आंबो</strong> the mango tree.</p>
<p>P. <strong>मच्छ</strong>, H. B. <strong>माछ</strong>, M. <strong>मासा</strong> a fish.</p>
<p>B.<strong>भाल</strong>, H. P. M. <strong>भला</strong>good.</p>
<p>It thus appears that originally the suffix was not necessarily applied to any nouns, but optionally to such as admitted of the additional signification.This additional signification has been preserved in some cases, but lost in others.</p>

<p>You will now have seen, that the Sanskrit and Prakrit final vowels having, for the most part, been dropped by the influence of the accent, the final <strong>आ, आं, ई, ईं, ऊ, ऊं, एं</strong>and <strong>ओ</strong>that we have</p>
<p>now got were originally penultimates or have arisen from a combination of the penultimate and final. The accent which originally fell on the penultimate falls now in consequence of this change on these new finals. Thus, these two accents, that on the penultimate when a word ends in the silent <strong>अ</strong>, and that on the new final, are now to be met with in the vernaculars. The first may be called the original accent, and the second derivative.</p>
<p>The Marathi is of all our dialects the most sensitive to them, and shortens all the other vowels of the word in order to throw the whole force of utterance on the accented syllable. The Sanskrit <strong>मूतक</strong> &lsquo;mourning&rsquo;, <strong>नूतन</strong> &rsquo;new&rsquo;, <strong>पीतल</strong>&lsquo;brass,&rsquo; and the Sanskrit and Prakrit <strong>जीवन्त</strong> (from <strong>जीवन्तः</strong> or <strong>जीवन्तो</strong>) are pronounced as <strong>सुत॑क्, नुत॑न्, पित॑ल्, जिव॑न्त्</strong>, &amp;c, with the penultimate <strong>अ</strong> long and the first vowel short. In this way, in a word composed of three syllables. with the final <strong>अ</strong> silent, the first syllable must be short in Marathi. When a word is composed of more than three syllables, the of the antepenultimate is elided, as in, <strong>अडचण, शहाणपण</strong>, pronounced <strong>अड्रच॑ण्शहाण्पण्</strong>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Similarly, when a word ends in the accented and the other vowels, the preceding vowels are shortened as in the following:—</p>
<p>[Table 40: Accent shortening preceding vowels ].</p>
<p>** किडा**, Skr.<strong>कीटकः</strong>, Pr.<strong>कीडओ</strong>, and the others in Table 6.</p>
<p>Also <strong>चुरा</strong> and <strong>भुसा</strong> which without the <strong>आ</strong> are <strong>चूर</strong> and <strong>भूस</strong> (See p. 422), <strong>विडी, जुई</strong>and such others occurring in Table 35.</p>
<p><strong>पिडी</strong> a step in the scale of descent, a generation, Skr. <strong>पीठिका</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>जुवा</strong> gambling by means of dice, Skr.<strong>द्यूतकः</strong>(by a change of gender).</p>
<p><strong>निला-लें-ली</strong>blue, Skr. <strong>नीलकः-कं-०लिका</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>पिवला-लें-ली</strong> yellow, Skr. <strong>पतिलकः-कं-०लेका</strong>.</p>
<p>When, together with the accented final, a word is composed of three or more syllables, or, more generally, when the accented syllable is preceded by two others or more, the <strong>अ</strong>of that which Immediately precedes is silent or elided, as in the case of <strong>अड्चण</strong> or above, and any other vowel in its place is shortened and sometimes dropped: The other vowels are also pronounced short. Thus —</p>
<p>[Table 41: Elision of अ through Accent.]</p>
<p><strong>शीक</strong> <em>imper. 2nd</em>    <strong>शिकणें</strong>   <em>inf</em>. to learn,<br>
pronounced as<br>
per. sing.the origina।<br>
form of the root.                      <br>
<strong>शिकणें.</strong></p>
<p><strong>पूस</strong>             <strong>पुसणें</strong>    <em>inf.</em> &rsquo;to ask’
<strong>पुस्णें</strong>.             <br>
<strong>रूस</strong>             <strong>रूसतो</strong>   <em>pres. part.</em>&lsquo;he is</p>
<pre><code>                     angry'       
</code></pre>
<p><strong>रूस्तो</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>शीव</strong>            <strong>शिवला</strong>  <em>past part.</em>‘touched’ <strong>शिङ्ला</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>शीव</strong> has similarly  <strong>शिवणे</strong>‘to sew’ <em>inf.</em> <strong>शिङ्तो</strong> &lsquo;he sews,’ <strong>शिवला</strong> ‘sewn.’</p>
<p><strong>कर</strong> &lsquo;do,&rsquo; *pres. part.*unaugmented <strong>करीत</strong>, sugmented <strong>करितो</strong> or <strong>करतो</strong> pronounced as <strong>कर् तो</strong></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>So also <strong>अङ्गुष्ठकः</strong> is <strong>आंग्ठा</strong>, and <strong>श्वशुरकः,</strong> <strong>साम्रा</strong> the penultimate <strong>उ</strong> being dropped.</p>
<p>When the final is unaccented, it is the penultimate that is emphasized, but when it is accented, the penultimate is slurred over. Thus the accentuation of the penultimate leads to the elision of the final vowel, and the accentuation of the final brings about an elision or shortening of the penultimate.</p>
<p><strong>ACCENT IN HINDI</strong></p>
<p>In Hindi also the accent leads to the elision of the <strong>अ</strong>of the previous syllable when more than one precede the accented syllable. Thus <strong>उबटन</strong>‘a cosmetic’ is pronounced is pronounced as <strong>उबटन</strong>, <strong>सूरखपन</strong>as<strong>मूरख्पन</strong> as<strong>मूरखपन</strong> as <strong>मूरख्प॑न, उबटना</strong><em>inf.</em> &rsquo;to rub the body with a cosmetic’, as <strong>उबट्ना करना</strong>as <strong>कर् ना</strong>. The Braj present participle <strong>करत</strong> is pronounced as <strong>कर॑त्</strong> since one syllable only precedes the accented penultimate; but the Hindi <strong>करता</strong>is <strong>कर् ता</strong>as two syllables precede the accented <strong>ता</strong>. The accent leads to the shortening of the preceding vowels in some cases. Thus <strong>गोपाल</strong> &lsquo;cowherd,&rsquo; and <strong>पाताल</strong> &rsquo;the lower regions,’ are sometimes pronounced and written as <strong>गुपाल</strong> and <strong>पताल</strong>;so does <strong>आसिष्</strong>become <strong>आसीस</strong>. In such words as <strong>उपज</strong>&lsquo;produce,’ <strong>उसास</strong>&lsquo;respiration,’ and <strong>उबटन</strong> ‘a cosmetic’, from the Pr. <strong>उप्पज्ज, उस्सास,</strong> and <strong>उब्बट्टण</strong>, Skr. <strong>उत्पद्य</strong>, <strong>उच्छ्वास</strong>, and <strong>उद्वर्तन</strong>, it prevents the lengthening of the initial <strong>उ</strong>, as by the general rule it should be long, since one member of the following double consonant is dropped. The</p>
<p>derived socent also shortens the preceding vowels in such instances as the following :—</p>
<p>[Table 42: Accent in Hindi shortening preceding vowels].</p>
<p>H. <strong>दहिना</strong> southern, Pr. <strong>दाहिणओ</strong>, Skr. <strong>दक्षिणकः</strong>.</p>
<p>H. <strong>दिया</strong> alamp, Pr. <strong>दीवओ</strong>, Skr. <strong>दीपकः</strong> .</p>
<p>H. <strong>जुआ</strong> gambling, Pr.<strong>जूअओ</strong>.Skr. <strong>द्यूतकः</strong> (by a change of gender).</p>
<p>H. <strong>अगला</strong>foremost, the first part of which is <strong>आग</strong>, from Pr. <strong>अग्ग</strong>. Skr. <strong>अग्र</strong>.</p>
<p>H. <strong>अपना</strong> one&rsquo;s own,&hellip;&hellip;.. <strong>आप</strong> from Pr. <strong>अप्प</strong>, Skr <strong>आत्म</strong>.<br>
इ<strong>कठ्ठा</strong> together,&hellip;……<strong>एक</strong>.</p>
<p>H. <strong>फिरा</strong>walked, <strong>पिया</strong>drunk, <strong>सिया</strong>sewn, <strong>छुआ</strong>touched, past participlesof <strong>फीरना, पीना, सीना      छूना</strong>, &amp;c. ८०.</p>
<p>In the same way it prevents the lengthening of a preceding vowel in such cases as <strong>उपजना</strong>&rsquo;to be produced,&rsquo; <strong>उठना</strong>&rsquo;to rise,’<strong>उडना</strong> &rsquo;to fly, &rsquo;the last two being derived from the Prakrit <strong>उत्थाण</strong> and <strong>उड्डयन</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>EXCEPTIONS TO THE ABOVE.</strong></p>
<p>But in a great many cases the accent does not affect the preceding close vowels. The Sanskrit words <strong>सूतक, पीतल,</strong> &amp;c., the first syllable of which is shortened in Marathi, retain it long in the Hindi. The words <strong>उपज,उपजना, उसास,</strong> and othershave their initial vowel optionally lengthened, and in a few cases, such as <strong>ऊपर</strong> and <strong>ऊखल</strong>, it is lengthened without any apparent reason. Similarly, the Hindi forms of <strong>कीटक</strong>and the other words in Table 6 retain the long vowel. It has also <strong>बीडी, जूही</strong>and <strong>सूजी</strong> as in Table 35, and <strong>नीला</strong>&lsquo;blue&rsquo;, <strong>पीला</strong>‘yellow’, <strong>सी</strong>खा, learnt&rsquo;, <strong>मीठा</strong>&lsquo;sweet&rsquo;, <strong>पूछा</strong>&lsquo;asked&rsquo;, <strong>मूआ</strong> &lsquo;dead&rsquo;, <strong>सीखना</strong>&rsquo;to learn, <strong>पूछना</strong>‘to ask&rsquo;, <strong>दूसरा</strong> &amp;c., while in all these cases the Marathi has short <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong>. Perhaps, this weakening of the accent as regards previous <strong>ई</strong> and <strong>ऊ</strong> is due to the development of another accentin Hindi on the initial syllable. To such an accent as this might be attributed the almost universal change of <strong>अय</strong>and <strong>अव</strong> to <strong>ऐ</strong> and <strong>औ</strong>that we have already noticed. The <strong>अ</strong>of the initial syllable, being accented, draws to itself the <strong>य</strong>or <strong>व</strong>of the following and</p>
<p>deprives it of its <strong>अ</strong>, in which cases the <strong>य</strong>or <strong>व</strong> becomes <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>उ</strong>, and then the two form <strong>ऐ</strong> and <strong>औ</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>THE ACCENT IN GUJARATI</strong></p>
<p>The Gujarati follows the Hindi completely, sometimes shortening the preceding vowels as in <strong>कुवो, सुवो</strong>, and <strong>कुमलो</strong> &lsquo;delicate&rsquo;, &rsquo;tender&rsquo;, and dropping it as in <strong>सस्रो</strong> &lsquo;father-in-law&rsquo;, (Skr.<strong>श्वशुरकः</strong>) and<strong>आङ्गुली</strong> &lsquo;finger&rsquo; (Skr. <strong>अङ्गुलिका</strong>), sometimes preventing their being lengthened, as in <strong>उपज, उठघुं</strong>, &amp;c., and very often preserving them long as in <strong>पूरो</strong> &lsquo;full&rsquo;, <strong>शीक्वुं, शीक्यो</strong>, &amp;c.</p>
<p><strong>THE ACCENT IN PANJABI</strong></p>
<p>The Panjabi also keeps the short vowel in such cases as <strong>उचार</strong> &lsquo;utterance&rsquo;, <strong>उजाला</strong> &rsquo;light&rsquo;, though a member of a double is droppedand preserves the long in such casesas <strong>दीया</strong> or <strong>दीवा</strong>, <strong>जुआ, कीडा, पूरा, पूरी</strong> ‘a cake&rsquo;, &amp;c. It has even fewer instances of shortening than the Hindi.</p>
<p><strong>THE ACCENT IN SINDHI</strong></p>
<p>The Sindhi has <strong>जुआ</strong>&lsquo;gambling&rsquo;, <strong>डिओ</strong>&lsquo;a lamp,&rsquo; <strong>पितल</strong>&amp;c., but has such words as <strong>मूतक</strong>, &lsquo;mourning&rsquo;, <strong>कीडो</strong> &lsquo;a worm&rsquo;, <strong>वीडो</strong> &lsquo;a roll of betel leaves, (Skr. <strong>वीटकः</strong>), <strong>पीतो</strong>&lsquo;drunk&rsquo;, &amp;c. In a great many words such as <strong>सुको</strong>&lsquo;dried&rsquo;, <strong>वुधो</strong>&lsquo;heard&rsquo;, <strong>छुतो</strong>&rsquo;touched&rsquo;, <strong>दुधो</strong>&lsquo;milked&rsquo;, the vowel of the preceding syllable is short; but that is due not to the accent on the last syllable but to the peculiarity of the Sindhi not to lengthen the preceding vowels even when a member of a double is dropped.</p>
<p><strong>THE ACCENT IN BENGALI AND ORIYA</strong></p>
<p>The Bengali is more like the Marathi in this respect than the Hindi. Thus we have <strong>भितर</strong>, H. <strong>भीतर</strong> &lsquo;in the interior’, <strong>शुका</strong> dry, H. <strong>भूका; भिजा</strong> or <strong>भिगा</strong> &lsquo;wet’, H. <strong>भीजा</strong> or <strong>भीगा; किडा</strong> &lsquo;a worm&rsquo;, H.<strong>कीडा; जुता</strong> &lsquo;shoes&rsquo;, H.<strong>जूता; खिला</strong>&lsquo;a nail&rsquo;, H. <strong>कीला, उपजन</strong> &rsquo;to be produced, &amp;c. It thus shortens <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong> in the unaccented syllables like the Marathi.</p>
<p>The Oriya follows the Bengali, having <strong>जुडा</strong>, Skr. <strong>जूटक</strong>&lsquo;a knot of hair’, <strong>जुता</strong>&lsquo;shoes&rsquo;, <strong>भिजा</strong>&lsquo;wet&rsquo;, <strong>भितर</strong> &lsquo;in the interior&rsquo;, &amp;c. All these languages, however, treat the unaccented <strong>अ</strong> in words of three or more syllables as the Marathi and Hindi do.</p>
<p><strong>THE ACCENT ON VERNACULAR TERMINATIONS</strong></p>
<p>In Marathi the termination of the oblique form of cases and that of the plural of neuter nouns in <strong>ए</strong> are also accented. The reasonwhy they bear the accent will be considered hereafter. The accent on the causal termination, in consequence of which the preceding vowels are shortened in the Hindi and the Gujarati, has already been mentioned. This also seems to be the same accent that we have been considering. Thus in G. <strong>शिवडाव</strong>&lsquo;make him sew, or <strong>धोवडाव</strong> &lsquo;make him wash&rsquo;, the <strong>आ</strong>being penultimate bears the accent and the final <strong>अ</strong>is dropped. Similarly in <strong>धोवडाववुं</strong>by the general rule, the final vowel being accented the penultimate <strong>अ</strong> is silent. It is because it is so, and the <strong>ववुं</strong>forms the conjunct<strong>व्वुं</strong>, that the <strong>आ</strong>looks as if emphasized just as the first <strong>अ</strong>of <strong>अड्चण</strong> and <strong>कर् ता</strong> is. In the Marathi and other dialectsalso, there is this accent in the case of the causal, and the preceding <strong>ई</strong> and <strong>ऊ</strong> are shortened; as in <strong>निज्॑व्</strong> &lsquo;make him sleep&rsquo;, <strong>निजव्णें</strong>&rsquo;to make one sleep&rsquo;, from the original <strong>नीज</strong> &lsquo;sleep&rsquo;, in <strong>करीव्</strong>cause him to do <strong>करिव्णें</strong>or<strong>करव्णें</strong> ’to cause one to do&rsquo;, &amp;c. In the standard Hindi the <strong>व</strong> is dropped, but still the way of pronunciation remains the same as it was when it existed. In <strong>दिखाना</strong>&rsquo;to show,&lsquo;for instance, the <strong>खा</strong> is pronounced as it would have been if the word had been <strong>दिखावना</strong>. And the forms with <strong>व</strong> exist in the Braj.</p>
<p><strong>ACCENT IN VERNACULAR COMPOUNDS</strong></p>
<p>Compounds in the vernaculars, most of which belong to the Tatpuruṣa, Karmadhāraya, or Dvandva class have an accent on the penultimate or final of the last word, as in the H. <strong>पन् सा॑ल</strong> &lsquo;a place where water is provided for passengers&rsquo;, in which the first word<strong>पानी</strong>becomes <strong>पन्</strong>, <strong>अमरा॑ई</strong>a forest of mango-trees&rsquo;, in which the <strong>आ</strong>of <strong>आम</strong>is shortened, <strong>घुडसा॑ल</strong> &lsquo;a stable&rsquo;, in which we have <strong>घुड</strong>for <strong>घोडा, रन् वास</strong> &lsquo;harem&rsquo;, the <strong>रन्</strong> of which is a shortened form of रानी, and in the G. <strong>अधमुई</strong>&lsquo;half dead’, and the M. <strong>अधम॑ण</strong>’half a maund’.In the Marathi <strong>आम्ररा॑इ,</strong> <strong>रानमाणू॑स,कालमांज॑र</strong>, the <strong>आ</strong> of the first syllable is short though not changed to <strong>अ</strong>; and in <strong>तिर्कांबटे</strong>&lsquo;an arrow and bow&rsquo;, the first word is <strong>तीर्</strong>with the <strong>ई</strong> shortened.</p>
<p>An unaccented initial vowel is dropped in the following instances:—</p>
<p>[Table 43: unaccented initial vowels dropped in vernaculars]</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>उपविश</strong> sit, Pr. <strong>उवइस</strong>, M. H. B. O. <strong>बैस</strong>, G. <strong>बेस</strong>, S.<strong>बिह</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>उपविष्टकः</strong> sat, Pr. <strong>उवइट्टओ</strong>, H. P. <strong>बैठा</strong>, G. <strong>बैठो</strong>, S, <strong>बीठो</strong>,</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>अभ्यन्तर</strong>inside, H. <strong>भीतर</strong>, B. M. (dial.) <strong>भितर</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr.<strong>अरघट्ट</strong>, a water-wheel, Pr.<strong>अरहट्ट</strong>?, H.<strong>रहट</strong>, M.<strong>रहाट</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>अभ्यञ्जनकम्</strong> to soak, M. <strong>भिजणें</strong>, H. <strong>भीजना</strong>, G. <strong>भिजवुं</strong>, B, <strong>भिजिवा</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr.<strong>एकस्थकम्</strong>in one place, Pr.<strong>एकट्ठअं</strong>, H. P. <strong>कट्ठा</strong>, or <strong>इकट्ठा</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>उपरि .</strong> above, Pr. <strong>उवरि</strong>, M. <strong>वर</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr.<strong>उत्सृष्टकः</strong>left, Pr. <strong>उज्छुट्ठओ</strong>, H. <strong>जूठा</strong> &lsquo;what is left after eating&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>उपाध्याय</strong> a preceptor, M. <strong>पाध्या</strong>, P. <strong>पाधे</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr.<strong>उदूढकः</strong>, Pr. <strong>उदूढओ</strong> abridegroom, H. P. <strong>दूल्हा</strong>.</p>
<p>Of the two instances of this change in the Prakrits <strong>लावू</strong> a &lsquo;pumpkin&rsquo; exists in Hindi, and <strong>रण्ण</strong>in the form of <strong>रान</strong> in M. and P. and of <strong>रन</strong> in H. Medial <strong>ऐ</strong> is dropped in Marathi, Bengall, and Oriya in the word <strong>बैस</strong>, and others enumerated before. It is dropped in the G. <strong>माशी</strong>for H. <strong>मौसी</strong>(see p. 391). This elision does not appear to be due to accent since according to our theory it must fall on the <strong>ऐ</strong>in some at least of the cases. The change is due to the process of softening, sitice what takes place here is the simple dropping away of the close element of the diphthong.</p>
<p><strong>THE AVOIDING OF THE HIATUS IN THE VERNACULARS</strong></p>
<p>We will now briefly notice the manner in which the hiatus caused by two vowels coming together in consequence of the olision of uninitial consonants in the Prakrits is avoided. We have seen that <strong>अ</strong>and <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>अ</strong>and <strong>उ</strong> are combined into <strong>ऐ</strong> and <strong>औ</strong>in some of the dialects, and into <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong>in <a href="http://#" title="Pp. 400-406.">others</a>. Final unacdented <strong>अ</strong>and <strong>आ</strong>are dropped when preceded by <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>उ</strong> as in the words given in Table No. 35, and unaccented <strong>उ</strong> preceded by <strong>अ</strong>is dropped in some of the vernaculars, as in Table No. 36, and combined into <strong>ओ</strong>or <strong>उ</strong> in <a href="http://#" title="See P. 418.">others</a>. Final <strong>इ</strong> is preserved or changed to <strong>य</strong>after <strong>अ</strong>in some cases, and combined with it to form <strong>ई</strong><a href="http://#" title="P. 419.">others</a>.</p>
<p>Final accented आand <strong>उ</strong> or <strong>ऊ</strong> are preserved and a hiatus is tolerated; as in H. P. <strong>जुआ</strong>or <strong>जूआ</strong>for <strong>द्यूतक</strong>, and S. P. <strong>पिउ, माउ</strong>, and theM. <strong>भाऊ</strong>for <strong>पितृक, मातृका, भ्रातृक</strong>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Sometimes <strong>ए</strong> or <strong>व्</strong> is inserted in such cases after <strong>इ</strong>and <strong>उ</strong>, as In H. <strong>दिया</strong> for <strong>दिआ</strong>‘alamp&rsquo; and M. <strong>जुवा</strong>, H. <strong>जूवा</strong> for <strong>द्यूतक</strong>.</p>
<p>The syllable <strong>अय</strong> aru, formed in the Prakrits by interposing a <strong>ए</strong> between <strong>अ</strong> and <strong>अ</strong>, Is changed to <strong>ऐ</strong> in modern Hindi as in the words in Table No.16 and to <strong>ए</strong>in the Gujarati and the Sindhi. This latter was the older process; and hence even in the Prakrits we have <strong>केल</strong> for <strong>कयल</strong>, Skr, <strong>कदल</strong>, and <strong>तेरह, तेवीसा</strong>, <strong>तेत्तीसा</strong> for <strong>त्रयोदश, त्रयोविंशति, त्रयस्त्रिंशत्</strong> &amp;c. And in Hindi alsowe haveए in <strong>बेर</strong>‘a plum&rsquo; from <strong>बयर</strong>for Skr. <strong>बदर</strong>, which must have existed in the Prakrits, though the form given by the Grammarians is <strong>बोर</strong> for <strong>बवर</strong>.</p>
<p>Though the Marathi does not, like the Hindi or Gujarati, nowchange <strong>अय</strong> to <strong>ऐ</strong> or <strong>ए</strong>, still as formerly observed, when in a state of formation, it did form <strong>ए</strong>out of it, as in the instances there given, and in the neuter singular termination <strong><a href="http://#" title=" P. 403.">एं</a></strong>. The termination <strong>नेर</strong> occurring at the end of the names of Gujarati and Marathi towns such as <strong>चांपानेर, बडनेर, संगमनेर, पिंपलनेर,</strong> &amp;c, is derived from Pr. <strong>नयर</strong>for Skr. <strong>नगर</strong>&rsquo;town’. The syllables <strong>अया</strong>, arising <strong>अ</strong> from <strong>आ</strong>, are also sometimes changed to <strong>ए</strong> as in H. <strong>अंधेर</strong> or <strong>अंधेरा</strong>, M.<strong>अंधेर</strong>, Pr.<strong>अंधयार</strong>, Skr. <strong>अन्धका</strong>र.After <strong>आ</strong>, the <strong>य</strong> is sometimes changed to <strong>ऐ</strong>and <strong>ए</strong> in the Hindi and Gujarati as in the instances in Tables No.18 and 20, and also in the Marathi in the instance <strong>शेली</strong> from Pr. <strong>छाअलिआ</strong>, Skr. <strong>छागलिका</strong>; but often <strong>आय</strong>and <strong>अया</strong>remain unchanged as in :—</p>
<p>[Table 44: ए inserted to avoid Hiatus]</p>
<p>H. G. <strong>कायर</strong> timid, Pr. <strong>कायर</strong>, Skr. <strong>कातर</strong>.</p>
<p>H. G. M. <strong>घाय</strong> wound or blow, Pr. <strong>घाअ</strong> or <strong>घात</strong>.Skr. <strong>घात</strong>.</p>
<p>H. बाय wind, Pr. <strong>बाअ</strong>, or <strong>वाय</strong>, Skr <strong>वात</strong>.</p>
<p>M. <strong>पाय</strong> the foot, Pr. <strong>पाअ</strong> or <strong>पाय</strong>, Skr. <strong>पाद.</strong></p>
<p>M. H. G. <strong>राय</strong> a king, Pr. <strong>राआ</strong>or <strong>राया,</strong>.Skr. राजा.</p>
<p>H. <strong>गया</strong> gone, G <strong>गयो</strong>, Pr. <strong>गअओ</strong>, or <strong>गयओ</strong>, Skr. <strong>गतकः</strong>.</p>
<p>G. <strong>शियालो</strong>the cold sesson, S. <strong>शियारो</strong>, Pr. <strong>शीअआ (या)लओ</strong>, Skr. <strong>शीतकालकः</strong>.</p>
<p>Sometimes the interposed <strong>य्</strong>is so light that it is dropped and the vowels <strong>अ</strong>and <strong>आ</strong>, or <strong>आ</strong>and <strong>अ</strong>, and in rare cases, <strong>अ</strong>and <strong>अ</strong>, combine and form <strong>आ</strong> as in:—</p>
<p>[Table 45 A: The interposed य्dropped]</p>
<p>B. <strong>पा</strong>, and B. G. <strong>घा</strong>for<strong>पाय</strong> and <strong>घाय</strong> in the above.</p>
<p>M. <strong>आ</strong> of <strong>आला</strong>, Pr. <strong>आअअ</strong>, Skr, <strong>आगत</strong>.</p>
<p>M. <strong>कुंभार</strong> a potter, Pr.<strong>कुंम्भआर</strong>, Skr. <strong>कुंम्भकार</strong>, and generally, the termination <strong>कार</strong>as in <strong>सुवर्णकार</strong> &lsquo;a goldsmith&rsquo; and others, also M. <strong>अंधार</strong> for <strong>अंधकार</strong>.</p>
<p>M. <strong>आर</strong> a Boa constrictor, Pr. <strong>अअअर</strong>, Skr. <strong>अजगर</strong>.</p>
<p>G. <strong>वानुं</strong> a promise, Pr. <strong>वअणअं</strong>, Skr. <strong>वचनकम्</strong>.</p>
<p>H. <strong>बरात</strong>, M. <strong>वरात</strong> a bridal procession, Skr. <strong>वरयात्रा</strong>.</p>
<p>In some cases <strong>व्</strong>is inserted instead of <strong>य्</strong> to prevent the hiatus, as in:—</p>
<p>M. <strong>राव</strong>for <strong>राअ</strong> &lsquo;a king&rsquo;.</p>
<p>H. <strong>पाव</strong>for <strong>पाअ</strong>&rsquo;the foot&rsquo;.</p>
<p>M. <strong>साव</strong>in <strong>सावली</strong> for <strong>छाअ</strong> in <strong>छाया</strong>; <strong>कावरा</strong> for Pr. <strong>काअरअ</strong>, Skr. <strong>कातरक;</strong> <strong>काव</strong>in <strong>कावला</strong> for Pr. <strong>काअ</strong>from Skr. <strong>काक</strong> and a few others.</p>
<p>In the principal Prakrit also we find <strong>पीवलअ</strong>for Skr.<strong>पीतलकम्</strong>&lsquo;yellow&rsquo;, from which we have the Marathi <strong>पिवलें</strong>, and <strong>बोर</strong> has been mentioned above.</p>
<p>A medial <strong>अ</strong> is dropped after <strong>इ, ए</strong> or <strong>उ</strong> a short or long, as in:—</p>
<p>[Table 45 C: Medial अ dropped after, इ, ए or उ]</p>
<p>M. <strong>दीर</strong> for Pr. <strong>दिअर</strong>&lsquo;husband&rsquo;s brother&rsquo;.</p>
<p>G. <strong>पीलुं</strong>, H. <strong>पीला</strong> &lsquo;yellow&rsquo; for Pr. पीअलअं, Skr. पीतलकम्.</p>
<p>M. शिलें‘stale’, H. <strong>सीला</strong> &lsquo;damp&rsquo;, &lsquo;cool&rsquo;, &lsquo;Pr. <strong>सीअलअं</strong>, Skr.<strong>शीतलकम्</strong>.</p>
<p>M. <strong>वेण</strong>a throe,&rsquo; Pr.<strong>वेअणा</strong>, Skr.<strong>वेदना</strong>; M.<strong>जूल</strong>or <strong>जूलें</strong> &rsquo;twins’, Pr. <strong>जुअलं</strong> or <strong>जुअलअं</strong>, Skr. <strong>युगलम्</strong> or <strong>युगलकम्</strong>. Sometimes with the previous <strong>इ</strong>, it forms <strong>ए</strong>; that is, a vowel, partaking of the character of both, is substituted for them; as in:—</p>
<p>[Table 45 D: medial अchanged to ए]</p>
<p>S.<strong>नेलु</strong>&lsquo;a fetter, Pr.<strong>निअडो</strong>,Skr.<strong>निगडः</strong>.</p>
<p>H. P. <strong>नेडे</strong>or <strong>नेरे</strong> ‘near’, Pr. <strong>निअडे</strong>, Skr. <strong>निकटे</strong>.</p>
<p>M. <strong>शेंडी</strong>&rsquo;the tuft of hair on the head&rsquo;, Pr. <strong>शिहण्डिआ</strong>, Skr.<strong>शिखण्डिका</strong>, the <strong>ह</strong>being softened     to<strong>अ</strong>.</p>
<p>H.<strong>बेना</strong> &lsquo;a fan,&rsquo; Pr. <strong>विअणअ</strong>, Skr. <strong>व्यजनक</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>नेडे</strong> has the form <strong>नीडे</strong>also, in which case <strong>अ</strong>is simply dropped and the vowel rendered long as in the M.<strong>दीर</strong>.</p>
<p>The long <strong>आ</strong>is preserved and changes the preceding <strong>इ</strong> to <strong>इय</strong> or <strong>य</strong>as in the H. <strong>सियार</strong> or <strong>स्या</strong>र &lsquo;jackal&rsquo; for Pr. <strong>सिआल</strong>, Skr. <strong>सुगाल</strong>; <strong>याह</strong> &lsquo;marriage,’ for Pr.<strong>विआह</strong>, Skr.<strong>विवाह</strong>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>CONSONANTAL CHANGES IN THE VERNACULARS.</p>
<p>We will now proceed to the consideration of consonantal changes; and first of those due to the process of softening. The semivowel <strong>य्</strong> is often softened to <strong>इ</strong>. In the Prakrits, <strong>व्यजन</strong>‘a fan&rsquo; becomes <strong>विअण</strong> which is preserved in the H. <strong>बेना</strong> and <strong>स्त्यान</strong> is changed to for <strong>थीण</strong>. This word does not occur in the vernaculars, butthe Hindi and Marathi have got <strong>थिजता</strong>and <strong>थिजणें</strong> ‘to congeal&rsquo; from the verb <strong>स्त्यायते</strong>, in which <strong>या</strong>is softenedto<strong>इ</strong>. From <strong>व्यजन</strong>, or rather such a word as <strong>व्यंजन</strong>, we have by a similar softening M. <strong>विंजणा</strong>, H.<strong>विंजना</strong>, G.<strong>विजणो</strong>, S, <strong>विञिणु</strong>. More modern instances are:-</p>
<p>[Table 46 Pra. य् changed to Verna. इ]</p>
<p>H. P. <strong>सिलाई</strong>, P.<strong>सलाई</strong>, Pr.<strong>सलाया</strong>, M.<strong>सलई</strong>a pencil, probe, Skr. <strong>शलाका</strong>.</p>
<p>B. <strong>शेल</strong>a dart, Skr.<strong>शल्य</strong>; the <strong>य</strong>, being changed to <strong>इ</strong>, is transferred to the preceding syllable.</p>
<p>H. P. <strong>जनेत</strong> a bridal procession, Skr. <strong>जन्ययात्रा</strong>.</p>
<p>H. <strong>झाईं</strong> shadow, P. <strong>छाईया</strong>, Skr. <strong>छाया</strong>.</p>
<p>H. P. <strong>बितीत</strong> passed, Skr, <strong>व्यतीत</strong>.</p>
<p>H.P. <strong>बिथा</strong>pain, Skr.<strong>व्यथा</strong>; <strong>विवहार</strong>business, performance, Skr.<strong>व्यवहार</strong>.</p>
<p>H. P. <strong>कलिआण</strong> welfare, Skr. <strong>कल्याण, बिदिआ</strong> learning, Skr.<strong>विद्या</strong>,</p>
<p>P.<strong>पतीज</strong> faith, belief, Skr.<strong>प्रत्यय.</strong></p>
<p>H.<strong>पर्तिछ</strong>visible, Skr.<strong>प्रत्यक्ष</strong>.</p>
<p>The Panjabi always dissolves a Sanskrit <strong>य</strong> contained in a conjunct into <strong>इ + अ</strong>, or sometimes into <strong>इ</strong> simply, while the Hindi often resorts to the latter change. The other languages do not seem to possess many instances of this process. The change of <strong>अय</strong>or <strong>अया</strong>to <strong>ए</strong>, formerly noticed, is also due to this softening process.</p>
<p>In the Prakrits, <strong>व्</strong> is dissolved into <strong>उ</strong> in<strong>झुणी</strong> for Skr <strong>ध्वनि, सुवइ</strong>, for <strong>स्वपिति, दु</strong> for <strong>द्वि, तुवर</strong> for <strong>त्वर</strong>, &amp;c. In Hindi we have <strong>झुन</strong> in the sense of &lsquo;a slight resemblance,&rsquo; a remote <em>sound</em> of the property possessedby another. But another derivative from the word exists in the form <strong>धुन</strong>or <strong>धून</strong>in that language, and of <strong>धून</strong> or <strong>धुनक</strong> in Marathi. From <strong>सुव</strong> H. has <strong>सो</strong> ‘to sleep,’ P. <strong>सौ</strong>, G.<strong>सुव</strong>, and B. and O.<strong>शु</strong> or <strong>शुइ</strong>. <strong>दु</strong> occurs in the forms of <strong>दो</strong>or <strong>दु</strong> when the word stands alone or is compounded, as in H.<strong>दूना</strong>, B.<strong>दुना</strong>, M.<strong>दुणा</strong>, &amp;c., for Pr.<strong>दुअण</strong>, Skr. <strong>द्विगुण</strong>‘two-fold,&rsquo; and <strong>तुवर</strong>by a further dissolution becomes the P. <strong>तुरना</strong>to go,&rsquo; H. P. <strong>तुरंत</strong>, G.<strong>तरत</strong>&lsquo;instantly, pr. part., M. <strong>तूर्त</strong>‘at present’.</p>
<p>More modern instances are:—</p>
<p>[Table 47: व् changed to उor ओ]</p>
<p>H. P. <strong>परोस</strong> to serve food, Skr.<strong>परिवेष</strong>.</p>
<p>H. P.M <strong>पडोसी</strong> a neighbour, <strong>प्रतिवेशी</strong>.</p>
<p>H.<strong>अंगोछा</strong>a towel, <strong>अङ्गवस्त्र</strong>.</p>
<p>H. P. <strong>पतोहू</strong> son&rsquo;s wife, Pr <strong>पुत्तवहू</strong>, Skr. <strong>पुत्रवधू</strong>.</p>
<p>H. P. <strong>जनेऊ</strong>, Pr. <strong>जण्णोवीअ</strong>, Skr. <strong>यज्ञोपवीत</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>व</strong> and <strong>वं</strong> to which <strong>प</strong> and<strong>म</strong> are softened aresimilarly changed to <strong>उ</strong> or <strong>ओ</strong>.</p>
<p>H. P. <strong>बहनोई</strong> sister’shusband, Pr. <strong>बहिनीवई</strong>, Skr, <strong>भगिनीपति</strong>.</p>
<p>H. P. <strong>भादो</strong> name of a month, Pr.<strong>भद्दवअ</strong>Skr, <strong>भाद्रपद</strong>.</p>
<p>H. P. G. <strong>खो-[ना-णा-वुं]</strong> to lose, Pr. <strong>खव</strong>, Skr.<strong>क्षप</strong>.</p>
<p>H. P. B. <strong>छू</strong> to touch, Pr. <strong>छिव</strong>, or <strong>छुव</strong>, Skr. <strong>छुप</strong>.</p>
<p>H. <strong>अनोखा</strong> unexpected, Pr. <strong>अणवेक्ख-[अ]</strong>, Skr. <strong>अनपेक्ष-[क]</strong>.</p>
<p>H. <strong>नोता</strong>, P. <strong>नेउंदा</strong>, G. <strong>नोतरुं</strong>, invitation, A.P. <strong>निवंत्त-[उ]</strong> or **निवंत्र-[उ]**Skr.<strong>निमन्त्र-[कः]</strong>, H, has
<strong>नेवता</strong>also.</p>
<p>H. <strong>पुन्यों</strong> the full-moon day, Ap. <strong>पुण्णिवां</strong>, Skr. <strong>पूर्णिमा</strong>.</p>
<p>H. <strong>सोंह</strong> (of <strong>सोंहीं</strong>) face to face, Ap. <strong>संवुंह</strong>, Skr. <strong>संमुख</strong>.</p>
<p>M. <strong>सोंप</strong> to entrust, Ap.<strong>सवंप्प</strong>, Skr. <strong>समर्प</strong>.</p>
<p>It will be seen that the <strong>ओ</strong>or <strong>उ</strong> to which <strong>व्</strong> is softened often prevails over the preceding and following vowels, as in the words<strong>परोस</strong> and <strong>पडोशी</strong>.</p>
<p>The change of <strong>अव</strong>to <strong>औ</strong>, formerly noticed, I consider as due to the elision of the final <strong>अ</strong>of <strong>व</strong>, consequent upon an accent on the first syllable, though afterwards there is a softening of the <strong>व्</strong> to <strong>उ</strong>. But in the above instances the change of <strong>व्</strong>to <strong>ओ</strong>or <strong>उ</strong> is due to a weak pronunciation or softening alone. The diphthong <strong>ओ</strong>requires, as I have several times observed, a passage from one vocal position immediately to another which involves energetic utterance. The Pali, Prakrit, Gujarati, and Sindhi substitute for it, viz.<strong>ओ</strong>, is due to assimilation. The Hindi <strong>औ</strong>and the corresponding Gujarati <strong>ओ</strong>, therefore, are not due to a weakening of the <strong>व्</strong>, but the <strong>ओ</strong>in the above instances is, since it is not a substitute for <strong>औ</strong>and consequently does not arise from an assimilation of the two sounds, involved in that diphthong.</p>
<p>The following are still more modern instances:—</p>
<p><strong>[Table 48:व् changed to उ]</strong></p>
<p>H. P. <strong>परमेसु</strong>र God, Skr <strong>परमेश्वर</strong>.</p>
<p>M. H. P. <strong>सुर</strong> or <strong>सूर</strong> a musical note, Skr.<strong>स्वर</strong>.</p>
<p>H. P. <strong>सुभाउ</strong>nature, Skr.<strong>स्वभाव</strong>.</p>
<p>P. <strong>सुआमी</strong>master, Skr. <strong>स्वामी</strong>.</p>
<p>In this manner the Panjabis always pronounce the <strong>व्</strong> of Sanskrit words and to a smaller extent, the Hindi people. The Marathi has not many instances of this softening of <strong>व्</strong>.</p>
<p>In the Prakrits there are according to the grammarians but. three instances of the change of <strong>क्</strong> to the sonant <strong>ग्</strong>. Of these <strong>गेन्दुअ</strong> for Skr.<strong>कन्दुक</strong>occurs in the <a href="http://#" title="See Table 22. 55 ">vernaculars</a>. With these exceptions the initial <strong>क्</strong> remains unchanged and the medial is dropped. But the vernaculars, adopting pure Sanskrit wordagain and again in the course of their history, have changed them as we have seen or changed the Prakrit words that came down</p>
<p>to them in virtue of the general or special laws which regulate the development of human speech. Thus, though they did not receive more words with a softened <strong>क्</strong> from the Prakrits, they have now come to possess a good many. Thus:-</p>
<p>[Table 49: Medial कऽoftened to ग्]</p>
<p>M. <strong>सगला</strong>, P. <strong>सगरा, सगला,</strong> or <strong>सगल</strong>, H. <strong>सगल</strong> or <strong>सगला</strong>, G. <strong>सगलो</strong>all for whole, Skr. <strong>सकल</strong> or <strong>सकलक</strong>.</p>
<p>M. <strong>बगला</strong>, H. P. <strong>बगला</strong>, G. <strong>बगलो</strong>, S. <strong>बगो</strong>, B. O. <strong>बग</strong> Skr. <strong>बक</strong> or <strong>बककः</strong>, a crane.</p>
<p>M.H. P. G.<strong>परगट</strong>or <strong>प्रगट</strong>,S.<strong>प्रघटु</strong> visible, manifest,Skr. <strong>प्रकट</strong>.</p>
<p>H. P. G. B. <strong>काग</strong>S. <strong>कांगु</strong> a crow, Skr.<strong>काकः</strong>. H. has<strong>कौवा</strong> or <strong>कौआ</strong>from Pr. <strong>काअ</strong> with the suffix <strong>कः</strong>, i.e., ओ, M. <strong>काव</strong>, of <strong>कावला</strong>, also.</p>

<p>H. <strong>सगुन</strong>, P. <strong>सगन</strong>, G. <strong>सगन</strong> or <strong>शगन</strong>, S. <strong>सगुणु</strong>, B, <strong>शगुन</strong> an auspicious omen, Skr,<strong>शकुनः</strong>,M.<strong>शकुन</strong>. S. has <strong>सोणु</strong>, also from the Pr. <strong>सउणो</strong>.</p>
<p>H, P.<strong>सोग</strong>,S.<strong>सोगु</strong>,grief, Skr.<strong>शोकः</strong>.The others have <strong>शोक</strong>.</p>
<p>H. P. <strong>बिंगा</strong> crooked, Pr.<strong>वङ्कअ</strong>, Skr. <strong>वक्रक</strong>. The others have <strong>वांक</strong> or <strong>बां</strong>क.</p>
<p>P. <strong>सगरांद</strong> passage of the sun into a sign, Skr <strong>संक्रान्ति</strong>. The others have <strong>संक्रां</strong>त.</p>
<p>P. <strong>संगोच</strong> contraction bashfulness, Skr. <strong>संकोच</strong>; H. <strong>सकोच</strong> or <strong>सकुच</strong>, M. <strong>संकोच</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>च्</strong> is softened to the sonant <strong>ज्</strong> as in the following:-</p>
<p><strong>[Table 50:च् softened to ज्]</strong>.</p>
<p>H. <strong>सूजी</strong>a needle, Skr.<strong>सूची</strong>; also &lsquo;a tailor&rsquo; from Skr.<strong>सूचिक</strong>.</p>
<p>H.G. <strong>सूज</strong> or <strong>सूझ</strong>-[ <strong>ना</strong>and <strong>वुं</strong>]to be suggested, Skr.<strong>सूच्य</strong>.</p>
<p>H. <strong>कुंजी</strong>a key, Skr. <strong>कुञ्चिका</strong>.</p>
<p>P. S. <strong>पंज</strong> five, Skr.<strong>पञ्च</strong>;P. <strong>मंजी</strong>a small bedstead, Skr.<strong>मञ्चिका</strong>.There are not many instances of this process.</p>
<p>The Prakrits change an uninitial <strong>द</strong> to <strong>इ</strong> when preceded bya</p>
<p>vowel; and the vernaculars have preserved the words so changed. For instance:-</p>
<p>[Table 51: Medial द् softened to ड्].</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>घटक</strong>: a jar, M. H. <strong>घडा</strong>, G. S. <strong>घडो</strong>, H. P. <strong>घडा</strong>.</p>

<p>Skr. <strong>कीटक</strong>: a worm, M. <strong>किडा</strong>, G. <strong>किडो</strong>, H. <strong>कीडा</strong>.</p>
<p>The instances in which the cerebral <strong>ट्</strong> resulting from an original <strong>त्</strong> has been softened in the Prakrits to <strong>ड्</strong> have been preserved by the vernaculars. The following are some of these:-</p>
<p>[Table 52: ट्( from original त्) softened to ड्]</p>
<p><strong>पड</strong>for Pr. <strong>पडि</strong>, Skr. <strong>प्रति</strong>, in such words as H. G. <strong>पडोसी</strong> &amp; neighbour, M. <strong>पडोशी</strong>, Skr. <strong>प्रतिवेशी</strong>.</p>
<p>M. <strong>पडसाद</strong>, Skr <strong>प्रतिशब्द</strong> echo.</p>
<p>M. <strong>पडसें</strong>, Skr. <strong>प्रतिश्याय</strong> cold, catarrh,</p>
<p>M. <strong>पडछाया</strong> reflection.</p>
<p><strong>पडताला</strong> proof.</p>
<p>G.<strong>पडसाल</strong>, Skr. <strong>प्रतिशाला</strong> a penthouse.</p>
<p>G. <strong>पडघा</strong>, Skr. <strong>प्रतिघात</strong> echo or resonance.</p>
<p><strong>हरडा</strong> or <strong>हरडी</strong> and <strong>बेहडा</strong> asin Table 29; M. <strong>पुढें</strong> forward, so forth, Pr. <strong>पहुडि</strong>, Skr. <strong>प्रभृति</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>पड</strong> of M. <strong>पडणें</strong>, G. <strong>पडवुं</strong>, H. <strong>पडना</strong> to fall, Pr. <strong>पड</strong> Skr. <strong>पत्</strong>.</p>
<p>M. <strong>मढ़ें</strong> a corpse, from Pr. <strong>मडअं</strong>, Skr. <strong>मृतकम्</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>उखाडना</strong>to dig out, to root out, from the Skr. <strong>उत्खात</strong>.</p>
<p>Of the change of <strong>त्</strong> to <strong>द्</strong> there are some instances in the Śaurasenī, and corresponding to these, we have a few in the Panjabi, Sindhi and Gujarati, thus:—</p>
<p>[Table 53: त् softened to द्]</p>
<p>P. <strong>जीउंदा</strong> &rsquo;living&rsquo;, Śaur. pres. part. <strong>जीवन्दो</strong>, Skr. <strong>जीवन्त</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>दा</strong> of the present participle of roots, as <strong>करदा</strong>masc. &lsquo;doing&rsquo;, <strong>आखदा</strong> masc. &lsquo;saying&rsquo; &amp;c. A modern instance is <strong>सगरांद</strong> for the Sanskrit <strong>संक्रान्ति</strong>.</p>
<p>The Sindhi preserves the Śaurasenī present participial affix <strong>न्दो</strong> or <strong>अन्दो</strong>, sometimes changed to <strong>इन्दो</strong> throughout, as in <strong>हलन्दो</strong> &lsquo;moving&rsquo;, <strong>करीन्दो</strong> &lsquo;doing&rsquo;, <strong>हून्दो</strong> &lsquo;being&rsquo;, &amp;c. The same change is observable in other words also as in <strong>खांदि</strong> for Sanskrit <strong>क्षान्ति</strong>.</p>
<p>The Gujarati has the few instances of the Śaurasenī past passive participle in <strong>द</strong> as in <strong>खादुं</strong> &rsquo;eaten&rsquo;, <strong>पीदु</strong> &lsquo;drunk&rsquo;<strong>कीदुं</strong> &lsquo;done&rsquo;, &amp;c. Marathi has <strong>दोंद</strong> for Skr. <strong>तुन्द</strong> &lsquo;belly&rsquo;, and Gujarati <strong>दुंद</strong>.</p>
<p>The labial surd <strong>प्</strong> is, when uninitial, softened in the Prakrits to <strong>व्</strong>. The <strong>व्</strong> is preserved by the Marathi unchanged, but the Hindi softens it in some cases still further to <strong>उ</strong> as already shown(p. 433), and drops it in a great many more cases, according to a very general rule to be hereafter noticed, while the Gujarati changes it sometimes to <strong>म्</strong>. The Sindhi and Bengali follow the Hindi to a large extent in this latter respect. Thus:—</p>
<p>[Table 54: प् softened to व् or उ or म्]</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>वापी</strong> 3 well, Pr. <strong>बावी</strong>, M. <strong>बाव</strong>, G. H. <strong>बाव</strong>in <strong>बावडी</strong>, S. <strong>वाइ</strong> P. <strong>बाउ</strong> in <strong>बाउडी</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>कूपकः</strong> &amp; well, Pr. <strong>कूवो</strong>, G. <strong>कुवो</strong>, H, <strong>कुआ</strong>, 8, <strong>कुहो</strong> for <strong>कुओ</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>कपाट</strong> a door, Pr. <strong>कवाड</strong>, M. <strong>कवाड</strong>, H. <strong>किवाड</strong>, G. <strong>कमाड</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>प्राप</strong> to reach attain, Pr. <strong>पाव</strong>M. <strong>पाव</strong> (in <strong>पावणें</strong>), G. <strong>पाम[वुं]</strong> H. <strong>पा-[ना]</strong>, S. <strong>पाइ-[णु]</strong> B. <strong>पाओ-[वा]</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>प्रस्थाप</strong> to send Pr. <strong>पढाव</strong> M. <strong>पाठव-[णें]</strong> old H. <strong>पठव-[ना]</strong>, H. <strong>पठा-[ना]</strong>. S. <strong>पठ-[णु]</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>छुप्</strong> to touch, Pr. <strong>छिव</strong> or <strong>छुव</strong>, M. <strong>शिव-[णें]</strong>, H. P. B. <strong>छू-</strong>[<strong>ना</strong> &amp;c,] O.<strong>छुं</strong> or <strong>छुंइ</strong>, S.<strong>छुअ-[णु]</strong> or <strong>छुह-[णु</strong>].</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>ताप</strong> to hest, Pr, <strong>ताव</strong>, M. G. H. <strong>ताव-[णें-वुं-ना]</strong>. S. <strong>ताइ [णु]</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>नापित</strong> a barber, Pr. <strong>नाविअ</strong> or <strong>न्हाविअ</strong> M. <strong>न्हावी</strong>, G. <strong>नावी</strong> H. S. <strong>नाई</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>गोपाल–लिक</strong> a cowherd, Pr. <strong>गोवाल-लिअ</strong>, M. <strong>गोवला,</strong> M. G. <strong>गवली</strong>, G. <strong>गोवालियो</strong> H. <strong>गोवाली, ग्वाल (= गोआल), ग्वाली</strong>, S. <strong>गवारु</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>कच्छपः</strong> a tortoise, Pr. <strong>कच्छवो</strong> H. <strong>कछुआ</strong>, S. <strong>कछउ‌ं, कछूं</strong>, M. <strong>कास</strong>व.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>सपत्नी</strong> a fellow-wife, Pr. <strong>सवत्ती</strong>, M. <strong>सवत</strong>, H. <strong>सौत</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>भाद्रपद</strong> name of the sixth month, Pr. <strong>भद्ववअ</strong>, M. <strong>भादवा</strong>, H. <strong>भादो</strong>, S. <strong>बडो</strong>.</p>
<p>The lingual surd aspirate <strong>ठ्</strong> is, it will be remembered, changed in the Prakrits to <strong>ढ्</strong>, and the vernaculars, especially the Hindi, have preserved the instances and even added to them, as will be seen from the following:—</p>
<p>[Table 55: ठ् changed to ढ्]</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>पठ</strong> to read Pr. <strong>पढ़</strong>, M. H. P. S. <strong>पढ</strong> in <strong>पढ़णें-ना-णु</strong>. In H. and P., however, the pronunciation of <strong>ढ</strong>is somewhat different from what it is in M, and in S. it sounds like the conjunct <strong>ड्ह</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>पीठक</strong> &amp; stool, Pr. <strong>पीढअ</strong>, H. <strong>पीढा</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>पीठिका</strong> &amp; series (of generations), Fr. <strong>पीडिआ</strong>, H. <strong>पीडी</strong>, M. <strong>पिडी</strong>, G. <strong>पेढी</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr, <strong>मठ</strong> or <strong>मठिका</strong> a small temple, Pr. <strong>मढ</strong>, H. P. <strong>मडी</strong>, old M. <strong>मड</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr <strong>दंष्ट्रा</strong>, Pr. <strong>दाढा</strong>, H. <strong>डाढ</strong>, M. G. <strong>दाढ</strong>.</p>
<p>Similarly we have H. <strong>लुढना</strong> &rsquo;to roll&rsquo; from Skr. <strong>लुठ्</strong>. In the word <strong>दाढा</strong>, the <strong>ढा</strong> does not represent <strong>ष्ट्र</strong> but <strong>ठ्ठ</strong>, to which thst Skr. conjunct must by the general rules be reduced in the Prakrits. One of</p>
<p>the two <strong>ठ्</strong> is dropped, and the preceding vowel lengthened according to a general rule in the vernaculars to be hereafter noticed. The remaining <strong>ठ्</strong> is softened to <strong>ढ्</strong>. There are other instances of the same change in our dialects. Thus:&ndash;</p>
<p>[Table 56:ट् changed to ढ्].</p>
<p><strong>वेढ</strong> of M. <strong>वेढणें</strong> 8. <strong>वेडहणु</strong>, <strong>बेढ</strong> of H. <strong>बेढना, बेड</strong> of B. <strong>वेडन</strong> &rsquo;to surround&rsquo; from Skr. <strong>वेष्ट</strong> through Pr.<strong>वेढ</strong>. The Gujarati, however, has <strong>वीठवुं</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>काढ</strong> of M. <strong>काढणें</strong>, G. <strong>काढवुं</strong>, H. <strong>काढना; कढ</strong> of S <strong>कढणु,</strong> B. <strong>काडं</strong> to draw out, &lsquo;from Pr.,<strong>कट्ठ</strong> Skr.<strong>कृष्ट</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>कूढ</strong> ofH. <strong>कूढना</strong> to mourn, from Pr.<strong>कुठ्ठ</strong>, Skr.<strong>ष्ट</strong>. Even here the Gujarati has <strong>कूटवुं</strong>.</p>
<p>H.<strong>कोढ</strong>, M. G.<strong>कोड</strong>, S.<strong>कोड्हु</strong> white leprosy, from Skr. <strong>कुष्ट</strong> through Pr.<strong>कोठ्ठ</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>ठ्</strong> arising from the Sanskrit <strong>थ्</strong> is also similarly changed to <strong>ढ्</strong>. M.<strong>सढल</strong>, H.<strong>ढीला</strong>, &amp;c., from the Skr.<strong>शिथिल</strong> as in Table 29.</p>
<p>M. <strong>कढणें</strong> to boil, <strong>काढा</strong> decoction, <strong>कढी</strong> urry, <strong>कढई</strong> cauldron, G, <strong>कद, काटो,</strong> &amp;0. H. <strong>कढना, काढा, कढी,</strong> &amp;c., all from the Skr. root <strong>क्वथ्</strong>.</p>
<p>We have noticed the change of <strong>ड्</strong> to <strong>र्</strong> and <strong>ल्</strong>, and of <strong>र्</strong> to <strong>ल्</strong>, in the Prakrits. Not only have the vernaculars preserved the words so changed, but have carried on the process to such an extent that <strong>ल्</strong> and <strong>र्</strong> have become mutually interchangeable in some of them, especially the Hindi.</p>
<p>[Table 57: ड् changed to ल्]</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>तडाग</strong> a tank, Pr.<strong>तलाअ</strong>, M. G.<strong>तलाव</strong>, H.<strong>तलें</strong>,H.<strong>तलाव</strong>, S. B.<strong>तलाउ</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>दाडिम</strong> pomegranate, Pr. <strong>दालिम</strong>, M. <strong>डालिंब</strong>, G. <strong>दालम</strong>, H. B. <strong>डालिम</strong> H. <strong>दालिम</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr.<strong>गुड</strong> molasses, Pr.<strong>गुल</strong>,</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>पीड</strong> of <strong>पीडयति</strong>to torment, to twist, Pr. <strong>पील</strong>, M. <strong>पिलणें</strong>, G. <strong>पलिवुं</strong>, H. <strong>पिलना</strong>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The numerals with their <strong>द्</strong> changed in the Prakrits to <strong>र्</strong> through an intermediate <strong>ड</strong> have come down to the vernaculars:—</p>

<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>The other Prakrit words <strong>दोहल</strong> and <strong>कलम्ब</strong> in which the <strong>द्</strong>of the Sanskrit <strong>दोहद</strong> and <strong>कदम्ब</strong> is changed to <strong>ल्</strong>are preserved in Marathi in the forms of <strong>डोहाला</strong> snd <strong>कलंब</strong>. Similarly <strong>हरिद्रा</strong>and <strong>अंगार</strong> with the <strong>र्</strong> so changed appear in the vernaculars as shown <a href="http://#" title="See P. 406 and Table 22.">before.</a></p>
<p>The following are later instances:—</p>

<p>Though the change of <strong>ल्</strong> to <strong>र्</strong> does not involve softening, but, must be considered to be due to a predilection for the sound, it would be convenient to notice it here. There is only one instance of this change given by Hemacandra as existing in the Mahārāṣṭrī,</p>
<p>but there are a great many in the vernaculars, so that this appears to be a peculiarly modern process. The Hindi and the Sindhi have, however, of all the vernaculars, the largest number of examples, the rest presenting but a few stray ones. Sometimes both the forms with <strong>ल्</strong> and <strong>र्</strong> are in use, especially in the Hindi.</p>

<p>[INTERCHANGEABLENESS OF ड्, र् AND ल्]</p>
<p>N‌otable instances of the interchangeableness of <strong>ड्, र्</strong> and <strong>ल्</strong>, are afforded by the causal forms of verbal roots in some of the vernaculars. In Hindi, the causal of roots ending in a vowel is formed by inserting <strong>ल्</strong> between it and the termination <strong>आ</strong> which is the remnant of the old Prakrit <strong>आव</strong> pr‌eserved in the Braj and other dialects; as <strong>पिलाना</strong> caus. of <strong>पी</strong> &rsquo;to drink, <strong>खिलाना</strong> of <strong>खा</strong> to eat, <strong>दिलाना</strong> of <strong>दे</strong> &rsquo;to give&rsquo;, <strong>धुलाना</strong> of <strong>धो</strong> &rsquo;to wash&rsquo;, &amp;c. In Gujarati we have <strong>ड्</strong> for <strong>ल्</strong> as <strong>खवाडवुं</strong> to cause to eat,&rsquo; <strong>देवाडवुं</strong> &rsquo;to cause to give,&rsquo; <strong>न्हवाडवुं</strong>&rsquo;to cause to bathe,&rsquo; &lsquo;wash&rsquo; &amp;c. Sometimes instead of <strong>ड्, र्</strong> is optionally used as in <strong>खवराववुं</strong> &rsquo;to cause to eat,&rsquo; <strong>बीहीबराववुं</strong> &rsquo;to threaten,&rsquo; &amp;c. But in Sindhi <strong>र्</strong> always represents the Hindi <strong>ल्</strong> and the Gujarati <strong>ढ्</strong>, as in <strong>दिआरणु</strong> &rsquo;to cause to give, <strong>धुआरणु</strong>&rsquo;to cause to wash,&rsquo; <strong>वेहारणु</strong> &rsquo;to cause to sit&rsquo;.</p>
<p>What the origin is of the <strong>ड्</strong> of these forms, which is more primitive than the <strong>ल्</strong> and <strong>र्</strong> to which it was afterwards changed, will be considered in the next lecture.</p>
<p>Another peculiarly vernacular process, of which Hemacandra gives only one instance, is the transformation of <strong>न्</strong> into <strong>ल्</strong>, in which <strong>न्</strong> is deprived of its nasal element and the complete contact of the vocal organs avoided. Thus:—</p>
<p>[Table 61 Skr. न् initial changed to ल् in vernaculars]</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>निम्ब</strong> a certain tree, Pr. <strong>लिम्ब</strong> or <strong>निम्ब</strong>, for, M. <strong>लिंब</strong>.</p>
<p>M. <strong>लवणे</strong> to bow, Skr. <strong>नमन; लोणी</strong> butter, Skr. <strong>नवनीत</strong> H. <strong>लौटना</strong> to return, Skr. <strong>निवर्त</strong>, Pr. <strong>निवट्ट</strong>; G.<strong>लील</strong> blue, Skr. <strong>नील</strong>; P.<strong>ललेर</strong>, a cocoanut, Skr. <strong>नारीकेल</strong>, H. <strong>नारियेल</strong>.</p>
<p>But there are more instances of the opposite process in the Prakrits; and these have come down to the vernaculars.</p>
<p>[Table 62: Skr. initial ल् changed to न् in vernaculars]</p>
<p>M. G. <strong>नांगर</strong> a plough or anchor, P. <strong>मङ्गलः</strong> or <strong>लाङ्गल</strong>.</p>
<p>M. <strong>निढल</strong>, S. <strong>निराडु</strong>, Pr. <strong>निडाल</strong> or <strong>णडाल</strong>, Skr. <strong>ललाट</strong> forehead.</p>
<p>The H. <strong>नून</strong> salt, Skr. <strong>लवण</strong> ‌is a later instance.</p>
<p>The sibilant <strong>स्</strong>, whether original or derived from the Sanskrit <strong>ञ्</strong>, or <strong>स्</strong>, is in a few cases changed to <strong>ड्</strong> in the Prakrits. For <strong>दिवस</strong> &lsquo;a day&rsquo; we have <strong>दिवह</strong> or <strong>दिअह</strong>, for <strong>पाषाण</strong> &lsquo;a stone&rsquo; <strong>पहाण</strong>, and for <strong>दशन्</strong> &rsquo;ten&rsquo; <strong>दह</strong>. These words, so changed, have come down to the vernaculars, and are found in one or other of them. The various forms of the numerals having the word <strong>दश</strong> at the end have been given above. Of the other words G. has <strong>दिह</strong> &lsquo;a day&rsquo; and <strong>दिहाडो</strong> with the suffix <strong>डो</strong>, P. <strong>दिंह</strong> and <strong>दिहाडा़</strong>, and S. <strong>डि़ंहु</strong> and <strong>डिहाढो</strong>; and S. <strong>पहणउ</strong> &lsquo;a stone&rsquo;. The Sindhi and the Panjabi have given a wider range to this process, as will be seen from the following:—</p>
<p>[Table 63: म्, श् or ष् changed to ह in Vernaculars]</p>
<p>S. <strong>बहु</strong> or <strong>बुहो</strong> chaff, Skr. <strong>बुस</strong>, M. <strong>भुसा</strong>.</p>
<p>S. <strong>बिहु</strong> lotus-stalk, Skr. <strong>बिहु</strong>, M. <strong>भि</strong>सें.</p>
<p>S. <strong>मेंहि</strong> a buffalo, Skr. <strong>महिषी</strong>, M. <strong>म्हैस</strong>.</p>
<p>S. <strong>वेहणु</strong> to sit, Skr. <strong>उपविश</strong>, M. <strong>बैसणें</strong>, G. <strong>बेसवुं</strong>.</p>
<p>S. <strong>बेसाहु</strong> trust, Skr. <strong>विश्वास</strong>.</p>
<p>P. <strong>बीह</strong>, S. <strong>वीह</strong> twenty, Skr. <strong>विंश-[ ति]</strong>, M. <strong>वीस</strong>.</p>
<p>P. <strong>विह</strong> or <strong>विस</strong>, S. <strong>विहु</strong> or <strong>विखु</strong> poison, Skr, <strong>विष</strong>, M. <strong>विस</strong>.</p>
<p>P. स<strong>हुरा</strong>, S. <strong>सहुरो</strong>, Skr <strong>श्वशुर</strong>, M. <strong>सासरा</strong> father-in-law.</p>
<p>P. <strong>तिहा</strong> thirst, Skr. <strong>तृषा</strong>.</p>
<p>P. <strong>फाहा</strong> or <strong>फाही</strong>, S. <strong>फाहो</strong> or <strong>फाही</strong> &amp; snare noose Skr. <strong>पाश</strong>, M. <strong>फांस.</strong></p>
<p>Gujaratis, especially of the uneducated classes, pretty freely pronounce <strong>म्</strong> as <strong>ह्</strong> as in <strong>हमजवुं</strong> for <strong>समजवुं</strong> &rsquo;to understand,&rsquo; <strong>बरह</strong> for <strong>वरस</strong> &rsquo;s year&rsquo; <strong>हाचुं</strong> for <strong>साचुं</strong> &rsquo;true&rsquo;, &amp;c. but the forms with <strong>म्</strong> are also in use. The other dialects do not seem to have many instances of this change. The termination <strong>म्</strong> of verbs of the future tense is in several dialects of the Hindi changed to <strong>ह</strong> as in <strong>करिहै</strong>, G. <strong>करसे</strong> &lsquo;he will do&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The change of <strong>म</strong> to <strong>वं</strong> seems to be an almost entirely later process of which there are scarcely any instances in the Prakrits. It is seen in full operation in the Apabhraṁśa.</p>

<p>Skr. <strong>कर्दम</strong> mud, H. <strong>कांदो</strong>, G. <strong>कादव</strong>.</p>
<p>From the fact that the Marathi, Hindi, Sindhi, and Panjabi contain many instances of this change it is to be gathered that though it does not appear in the Prakrits proper, it must have begun very early, before the vernaculars received their distinctive forms and were isolated from each other. Of all the dialects the Marathi alone has preserved the <strong>व्</strong> of this <strong>वं</strong> in most cases, the Hindi and the others having dropped it or softened it to <strong>उ</strong> in good many instances; while the Gujarati changes it back again to <strong>म्</strong>. Thus, such of the above words as exist in Gujarati have the following forms:—</p>

<p>The reason why I consider this as a change of <strong>वं</strong> back to <strong>म्</strong> and not a preservation of the original Sanskrit and Prakrit <strong>म्</strong>, is that the Gujarati changes <strong>व्</strong> to <strong>म्</strong> in other cases where there is no question as to the <strong>व्</strong> (or <strong>प्</strong>) being the original sound. Thus:—</p>
<p>[Table 66: व् or प् changed to म् in Gujarati]</p>
<p>G. <strong>कमाड</strong> a door, H. <strong>किवाड</strong>, M. <strong>कवाड</strong>, Pr. <strong>कवाड</strong>, Skr. <strong>कपाट</strong>.</p>
<p>G. <strong>शिसम</strong> blackwood, M. <strong>शिसवा</strong>, Pr. <strong>सिंसव</strong>, Skr. <strong>शिंशप</strong>.</p>
<p>G. <strong>पामवुं</strong> to attain, M. <strong>पावणें</strong>, Pr. <strong>पाव</strong>, Skr. <strong>प्राप</strong>.</p>
<p>G. <strong>धाम</strong> in <strong>दोंडधाम</strong> running, Skr. <strong>धाव्</strong>.</p>
<p>Where in Marathi we have व् or ब्, the Gujarati has in some cases म्, as in G. मुक्की a blow, M. बुक्की, G. ठाम &lsquo;&amp; place of residence&rsquo;, M. ठाव, derived in some way from Skr. स्थाप.</p>
<p>There are traces of this change in some of the other dialects too :—</p>
<p><strong>[Table 66 A: म् for प् ]</strong></p>
<p>S. P. मिंनत, B. मिनति, corresponding to M. विनंति, H. बिनति, Pr. विण्णत्ति, Skr. विज्ञप्ति &lsquo;solicitation&rsquo;; B. काछिम, Pr. कच्छव, Skr. कच्छप &rsquo;tortoise&rsquo;: H. धीमर, Skr. धीवर &lsquo;a fisherman&rsquo;; old M. मात, G. बात, Skr. वार्ता &rsquo;news&rsquo;: B. मुछ, H. पुंछ [ ना ], Skr प्रोञ्छ् &rsquo;to wipe away&rsquo;.</p>
<p>This phenomenon of the change of व् to म् the vernaculars, and especially the Gujarati, have inherited from the Piakrits. Of the words so changed the Gujarati has preserved समणुं &lsquo;a dream&rsquo;, the Prakrit form being सिमिण or सुमिण, and some of the others, नीम &lsquo;kind of tree&rsquo;. This last is नीप in Sanskrit; but probably there was an intermediate form नीव.</p>
<p>The vernaculars have thrown away the aspiration of hard and soft aspirate mutes in a good many cases. Thus:—</p>

In the instances given from Marathi, it will be seen that the letters other than those which are softened are aspirates; hence the weakening consists simply in dropping the heavy breath in one of two aspirated sounds, as in the case of the Sindhi <strong>बीख</strong> and <strong>बुख</strong>. The aspirates are preserved when occurring singly, which is not the case in Bengali. Hence Bengali utterance is the weakest, and the Hindi and Panjabi the strongest.</p>
<p>The Marathi reduces a Sanskrit or Prakrit <strong>म्</strong> invariably to <strong>स्</strong>, and in this respect differs from all its cognate dialects. Thus:—</p>

<p>According to a general rule in Marathi, <strong>म्</strong> is changed to <strong>श</strong>when followed by the palatal vowel <strong>इ</strong>or<strong>ए.</strong> This change of <strong>ल्</strong> to <strong>स्</strong> in this dialect is to be accounted for by the fact that the vocal organs of the Marathas have a predilection for the dento-palatals, <strong>च, छ, ज, झ</strong>, to which the Sanskrit palatals are in almost all cases reduced by them, except when they are followed by <strong>इ, ए,</strong> or <strong>य्</strong>. The Sanskrit <strong>छ्</strong> therefore becoming the dento-palatal <strong>छ्</strong> passes into <strong>म्</strong> which differs from it only in the contact of the vocal organs being somewhat less incomplete. The only instances in the Prakrits in which the change appears to be the same as that we have been considering are <strong>ऊसवो</strong> for <strong>उच्छवो</strong> and <strong>ऊसुओ</strong>for <strong>ऊच्छओ</strong>.</p>
<p>I have already given instances of the many words with their uninitial consonants dropped which the vernaculars have inherited from the Prakrits, and shown what further changes they have undergone. This process of elision has not been continuedby any of the vernaculars unless we consider the disappearance of uninitial <strong>व्</strong> (which is very general in Hindi, Sindhi, and Bengali) to be an instance of the process.</p>

<p><strong>THE OF THE CAUSAL TERMINATIONS IN THE VERNACULARS</strong>.</p>
<p>This elision of <strong>व्</strong> appears also in the Hindi causal forms such as<strong>उठाना, चलाना</strong>, <strong>जलाना</strong>, in which the <strong>आ</strong> only of the Prakrit or Marathi termination <strong>आव</strong>or <strong>अव</strong> is retained. The whole termination appears in the Braj and other dialects and in old books, sometimes in the form of <strong>औ</strong>.</p>
<p>The Sindhi causal termination is <strong>आइ</strong>as in <strong>बधाइणु</strong> &rsquo;to cause toincrease.’The <strong>इ</strong> here as well as in some of the Sindhi words given above represents the य which according to the Prakrit rule, takes the place of the dropped <strong>व</strong>, and is, as shown before, changed to <strong>ए</strong> in the other vernaculars. The Sindhi <strong>इ</strong> is a shortened form of this <strong>ए</strong>. The termination <strong>आइ</strong>appears sometimes in its more original form of <strong>आअ</strong> as in <strong>वठाअणु</strong> &rsquo;to cause to take.’</p>
<p>The Bengali too forms its causal by adding <strong>आइ</strong>as in <strong>धराइतेछे</strong>’is causing to be held,’ but the <strong>इ</strong> here seems to be an euphonic addition, which even in their primitive form the verbs take, as in <strong>धरितेछे</strong>‘isholding,’ so that the <strong>व्</strong> is here dropped and the vowel <strong>अ</strong>combined with the preceding as in the Hindi. In the speech of the Maratha lower classes of Southern Konkan <strong>व्</strong> is very often elided, and the causal termination of the Savantvadi dialect is <strong>अय</strong>, as in <strong>करय</strong> &lsquo;cause to do, which corresponds to the Sindhi <strong>कराइ-[णु]</strong>.</p>
<p>[Table 69 A : of म् dropped in the Vernaculars ]</p>
<p>There are instances also in which the <strong>व्</strong> resulting from <strong>म्</strong>is elided:—</p>
<p>H. <strong>कुअंर</strong> &lsquo;a boy,’‘a prince,’ Pr.<strong>कुमर</strong>, Skr. <strong>कुमार; बायां</strong> &rsquo;left-hand-side, Pr. <strong>वामअ</strong>, Skr. <strong>वामकः</strong>, <strong>धुआं</strong> ‘smoke,’ Pr. <strong>धूमअ</strong>, Skr. <strong>धूमक</strong>;<strong>अचाना</strong>; ‘to rinse the mouth,’ Pr. Skr. <strong>आचम</strong>; or <strong>बेराना</strong>&rsquo; ‘tomock’,Skr. <strong>विडम्ब; भुई</strong> ‘ground,’ Skr.B.</p>
<p>There are traces of this change in other dialects too, as in the Oriya <strong>वां</strong> for <strong>वाम</strong> ‘left,’ Gujarati <strong>भांय = भूंई</strong>, S. <strong>भुइं</strong>,Skr. <strong>भूमि</strong>, and the Marathi<strong>भुंई</strong> and the termination <strong>ईं</strong> of the locative, which is to be traced to the Pr. <strong>म्मि</strong>, Skr. <strong>स्मिन्</strong>. In all these instances we may regard <strong>म्</strong> as directly elided, and not the <strong>व्</strong> resulting from it. Hemacandra notices a few instances of the process in the Prakrits.</p>
<p>The vernaculars possess a large number of those Prakrit words, in which the mute element of hard and soft aspirates was dropped leaving only the <strong>इ</strong>. Thus:—</p>
<p>[Table 70: Vernacular इ for Skr. ख]</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>मुख</strong> face, Pr. <strong>मुह</strong>. H. <strong>मुंह</strong>, S. <strong>मुहु</strong>, G. <strong>मोहो</strong>; M. <strong>मोहरे</strong>, P. <strong>मुहेरहं</strong> (with the suffix <strong>र</strong>) in front, H. <strong>मोहरा</strong>;H. <strong>सोंही</strong>, G. <strong>सामुं-मो</strong>, M. <strong>समोर</strong> (with the suffix <strong>र</strong>) from Skr. <strong>संमुख</strong> face to face.</p>

<p>P. <strong>पहिर[णा]</strong> by the consonants interchanging places.</p>
<p>[Table 74: Vernacular ह for Skr. भ]</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>प्रभा</strong> or <strong>प्रभात</strong> light, dawn, Pr, <strong>पहा, पहांअ, पहाद</strong>, H. <strong>पह</strong> or <strong>पोह</strong>, G. <strong>पोह</strong>, M. <strong>पहाट</strong>. The S. <strong>पिरिह</strong>must be a later form. From the same root with the prepositions <strong>वि</strong> and <strong>सु</strong> we have H. <strong>विहान</strong> morning, S . <strong>सुहाउ</strong> light, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>शुभ</strong> to become to adorn, Pr. <strong>सुह</strong>, H. <strong>सोह- [ना]</strong>. S. <strong>सुह-[णु]</strong></p>
<p>Skr, <strong>सौभाग्य</strong> prosperity good fortune, Pr. <strong>सोहग्ग</strong>, H. <strong>सोहाग</strong> or <strong>सुहाग</strong>.</p>
<p>Similarly, H. <strong>पहिचान</strong> ‘recognise’ is from Skr. <strong>प्रत्यभिजाना</strong>, the consonants interchanging places; G. <strong>वहालो</strong> or <strong>वाल्हो</strong>‘dear’ from Skr. <strong>वल्लभःसेहलो</strong> &rsquo;easy’ from <strong>सलभ; वेहच - [वुं]</strong> to ‘distribute or divide&rsquo; from <strong>विभज्</strong> &amp;c.</p>
<p>The existence of many such words as M. H. P. <strong>उपाध</strong>&lsquo;injury,&lsquo;H. P. <strong>साध</strong>‘a good man,&rsquo; M. G. H. P. <strong>मध</strong> &lsquo;honey, H. G<strong>लिख,लख</strong> &rsquo;to write,&rsquo; M. G. H. <strong>नख</strong>‘nail,’ S. <strong>सुभाणे</strong>&lsquo;in the morning’ shows that the popular speech of Northern India has now for a long time ceased to have recourse to this process of dropping the mute element of the aspirates of the Sanskrit words, adopted from time to time from the parent language. Still, however, a few laterinstances, such as S. <strong>पिरिह</strong> ‘dawn,’ H. G. <strong>माह</strong>‘middle’ from <strong>माध</strong>and <strong>मध्य</strong>, and some of the compounds of घर noticed above show that it has not been entirely absent.</p>
<p>The elision of simple mutes and of the mute element of aspirates is a natural phenomenon which one always meets with in the course of lingual development; but its operation is generally slow and it is only in consequence of its systematic occurrence. in the Prakrits that I have attributed it to an ethnological cause and have supposed that the Prakrit speakers belonged to another race than those who spoke Sanskrit and, being unused to Sanskrit sounds, caught only the initial consonants from their Sanskrit teachers and dropped the rest or the mute portion of the rest. When, however, in the course of time they became used to those sounds and the Sanskrit and Prakrit speaking races became united into one community, they ceased to be so dropped, except through the slow and gradual operation of the usual phonetiol laws; and hence it is that in modern times we find Sanskrit words, not shorn of their elements in the manner in which they were in ancient times, as indicated above.</p>
<p>This elision, though it involves economy and is a natural process, constitutes a peculiarity of the Prakrits in so far as it is duel to peculiar historical incidents. We will now notice the peculiarities which do not involve economy and must be attributed to vocal predilections. Of the words in which a Sanskrit dental is changed to a cerebral in the Prakrits the vernaculars have preserved the following:—</p>
<p>[Table 75: Skr. Dentals changed to Cerebrals in Vernaculars]</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>बिभीतक</strong>myrobalan,Pr.<strong>बहेडाओ</strong>,M. <strong>बेहडा</strong>, &amp;c. as in table 8.</p>

<p>Thus then the Pali and Prakrit tendency to pronounce dentals. as cerebrals is seen in a much more exaggerated form in the Sindhi and next to it in the Hindi and the Panjabi, while the other modern dialects seem to have kept it quite within the bounds in which we find it in the ancient dialects, though they have changed more words in that way than they.</p>
<p>In the following instances the cerebral mute in the place of the dental is to be considered as due to the influence of an adjoining <strong>र्</strong>.</p>
<p>[Table 78: Dentals adjoining र्changed to cerebral mute]</p>

<p>Uninitial is changed to <strong>ण्</strong> in the Prakrits invariably, but when it is the beginning of a word is undergoes that change or optionally. In the vernaculars the initial remains unchanged, but when medial it becomes mostly in the Marathi, Gujarati, Sindhi, and Panjabi.</p>

But the general in the rule seems to be that these four dialects have a medial <strong>न्</strong> place of the double <strong>ण्</strong> of the Prakrits, resulting from a Sanskrit conjunct of which <strong>न्</strong> is a member. Thus:—</p>

<p>Skr. <strong>मन्य</strong>, Pr. <strong>मण्ण</strong> M. G. <strong>मान-[णें-वुं]</strong>. S. <strong>मन</strong>णु, P. <strong>मन्नणा</strong> to think, to regard, to obey.</p>
<p>But even here in Marathi, the purely Deshastha Brahmans living in the eastern part of the Deccan or Mahārāṣṭra pronounce the <strong>न्</strong>as <strong>ण्</strong>; and the ordinary <strong>रान, कान, पान, विनंति</strong>, &amp;c., of that dialect become in their mouths <strong>राण, काण, पाण, विणंति</strong>, &amp;c. They have, therefore, preserved in its integrity the old habit of the Prakrit speakers to pronounce the <strong>न्</strong> as <strong>ण्</strong> throughout. On the other hand, the lower class of the Konkani population preserve the Paiśacipeculiarty of reducing <strong>ण्</strong> in all cases to <strong>न्</strong> and pronounce of, <strong>पाणी, वाणी,कोण</strong>, &amp;c, as <strong>पानी, वानी, कोन</strong>, &amp;c, and this peculiarity we find in its fulness in the Hindi, and next to it in the Bengali. Thus the words with a <strong>ण्</strong> in them in the Marathi, Gujarati, Sindhi and Panjabi, given above, have the following forms in Hindi:—</p>
<p><strong>मानूस, दिसना, जन, कहानी, पानी, जानना, कौन, बहिन</strong>,or<strong>बैन, कठिन, जनना, लून</strong> or <strong>नून,अपना, टानना</strong> or <strong>तानना, ननद</strong> or<strong>ननदी</strong>.</p>
<p>And such of these words as are in use in the Bengali have the following:—</p>
<p><strong>मानूश, जन, किहानी, जानन, फोन, बहिन</strong> or <strong>बोन, कठिन, जनन, लोण, आपना, दानना, ननद</strong>.</p>
<p>Other words, in some of which even in Sanskrit a <strong>ण्</strong> appears, are in the Hindi and Bengali thus:—</p>
<p>[Table 83: Original ण् preserved]</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>ब्राह्मण</strong>, H., <strong>बम्हन</strong>, or<strong>बामन</strong>,B.<strong>बामुन</strong>,but S.<strong>बाभणु</strong>, a Brahman.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>शृण</strong>in <strong>शृणोति</strong>, H. <strong>सुन-[ना]</strong>, B. <strong>शुन-[न]</strong>, S. **सुण-[णु]**to hear.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>दक्षिण</strong>, H. <strong>दहिना</strong>, A. <strong>डाइन</strong>, right hand.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>गर्हण</strong> (?), H, B. <strong>गहना</strong>, S. <strong>गहणो</strong>, an ornament worn on the person.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>काण-[कः]</strong>, H. <strong>कान</strong> or <strong>काना</strong>, B. <strong>काना</strong>, S. <strong>काणो</strong>blind of one eye.</p>
<p>Still <strong>ण्</strong>does appear in Bengali books in a few words such as <strong>काण</strong>&rsquo;ear&rsquo;, <strong>लोण</strong>, &lsquo;salt&rsquo;, &amp;c. In the Hindi it seems to be entirely absent.</p>
<p>In the principal Prakrit and the Śaurasenī, all the Sanskrit sibilants are reduced to <strong>स्</strong>. Sanskrit words, therefore, containing the palatal <strong>श्</strong>and the cerebral <strong>ष्</strong>, which in the Prakrits came to have the dental <strong>स्</strong> instead, have the last in the Hindi, Panjabi, Sindhi, Gujarati, and Marathi. But according to a law of Marathi pronunciation, this <strong>स्</strong>, when followed by the palatal vowel or semi-vowel <strong>इ, ए,</strong> or <strong>य्</strong>, is transformed into the palatal <strong>श्</strong>.The foregoing list of words contain many instances that provethese points. Thus:—</p>

<p>Other instances are—</p>

<p>M. <strong>साल</strong>,H. <strong>साल</strong>,Skr. <strong>शाला</strong>‘a school&rsquo; or &lsquo;an establishment.</p>

<p>M. G. <strong>साकली</strong>, H. <strong>सांकली</strong>, <strong>सिकली</strong> &lsquo;achain’, Skr. <strong>शृङ्खला</strong>.</p>
<p>M. <strong>सुक</strong>, H. <strong>सूख</strong>, Skr. <strong>सुष्क</strong>‘dry&rsquo;.</p>
<p>H. <strong>सीख</strong>, Skr. <strong>शिक्ष</strong>&rsquo; to learn.</p>
<p>H. <strong>पीस</strong>, Skr. <strong>पिष्</strong> ‘to grind.’</p>
<p>H. M. G. <strong>नास</strong>, Skr. <strong>नाश</strong>‘destruction&rsquo;.</p>
<p>S.<strong>बस</strong>, Skr. <strong>वर्ष</strong>‘to rain’.</p>
<p>H. P. S. <strong>सेज</strong> ‘a bed,’ Skr. <strong>शय्या</strong>.</p>
<p>[Table 84 C: The Same More Modern Instances]</p>
<p>Even in words adopted later, and consequently treated somewhat differently, from the way in which they were treatedin the Prakrits, the Sanskrit <strong>श्</strong> and <strong>ष्</strong> are reduced to <strong>स्</strong>, as in the H. <strong>तर्सना</strong> &rsquo;to thirst,’ Skr. <strong>तृष्</strong> ; <strong>परवेस</strong> ‘entrance,’ Skr. <strong>प्रवेश ; परसु</strong> ‘ahatchet,’ Skr. <strong>पर्शु ; निसपति</strong>‘lord of the night,&rsquo; &rsquo;the moon,&rsquo; Skr. <strong>निशापति</strong>;S. <strong>वंसु</strong> ‘race,’ ‘descent,’ Skr. <strong>वंश;वर्सणु</strong>‘to rain,’ Skr. <strong>वर्ष</strong> ; <strong>वसिकरणु</strong> ‘to subdue,’ Skr. <strong>वशीकरण</strong> , P. <strong>सोग</strong> &lsquo;sorrow,’ Skr.<strong>शोक; सांत</strong> &lsquo;quietness,’ Skr. <strong>शान्ति</strong> ;<strong>परमेसुर</strong> &lsquo;God,’ Skr. <strong>परमेश्वर</strong>; H. <strong>वरिस</strong>, G. <strong>वरस</strong> &lsquo;a year,’ &lsquo;Skr, <strong>वर्ष</strong>; G, <strong>वरसवुं</strong> ‘to rain,’ Skr. <strong>व</strong>र्ष &amp;c.</p>
<p>The present speakers of the Hindi, the Panjabi, and the Sindhi retain therefore the vocal peculiarity of their Prakrit ancestors of pronouncing Sanskrit <strong>ष्</strong> and <strong>श्</strong> as <strong>स्</strong>.</p>
<p>Of the words given above, the <strong>सींग, सेमल, सीख</strong> and <strong>सेज</strong> of the Hindi become <strong>शिंग, शेवरी, शिक</strong> and <strong>शेज</strong> in Marathi, because they are followed by a palatal vowel. Similarly, we have <strong>शेण</strong>‘cowdung’ Skr. <strong>शकन्; शेगट</strong> &lsquo;atree,’ Skr. <strong>शिग्र ; शेवाल</strong> &lsquo;moss,’ &lsquo;Skr. <strong>शैवाल; शिडी</strong> &rsquo;ladder,&rsquo; Skr. <strong>श्रेडी</strong>, &amp;c. Even the original <strong>स्</strong>of Sanskrit words is pronounced by the Marathas as <strong>श्</strong> under those conditions, as <strong>शेंदूर</strong> ‘red lead,’ Skr. <strong>सिन्दूरः</strong> ; <strong>शिवणें</strong> &rsquo;to sew,’ Skr. <strong>सिव्</strong> ;<strong>माउशी</strong>&lsquo;mother&rsquo;s sister,’ Skr. <strong>मातृष्वसा</strong>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Gujarati too shows the same tendency though it is not so decided; and we have thus <strong>शिंग</strong>‘a horn,’ <strong>शिखवुं</strong>&rsquo;to learn&rsquo; <strong>सिववुं</strong>‘to sew,’ <strong>शिसम</strong>‘blackwood,’ Skr. <strong>शिंशप, शेज</strong>,Skr. <strong>शय्या</strong> &amp;c. But we have also such words as <strong>शिंचवुं</strong>&lsquo;sprinkling,’ Skr. <strong>सिंच, सिजववुं</strong>&rsquo;to boil,&rsquo; <strong>सिडी</strong>‘ladder, &amp;c. So that the Marathi rule does not seem to be strictly applicable to the Gujarati. Still the sound <strong>श्</strong>is as natural to the Gujaratis as to the Marathas, as is shown by such forms as <strong>शुं</strong>for <strong>सुं</strong>‘what?&rsquo;, <strong>करशो</strong>&lsquo;do,’ &amp;c., and in some provinces it is freely used for <strong>स्</strong>in many words.</p>
<p>The Bengali forms of such of the above words as are used in the language have <strong>श्</strong>for the Hindi <strong>स्</strong>, as:—</p>

<p>Bengali books and dictionaries contain a good many words, derived from the old Prakrits or recently adopted from Sanskrit, which contain <strong>स्</strong>in them. The object of the authors in these cases is to give the correct Prakrit or Sanskrit forms, and not to represent the correct Bengali pronunciation. But it is not necessary to hear a Bengali speak or read his language or even Sanskrit for a long time to arrive at the clear conviction that his vocal habits do not admit of the pronunciation of <strong>स्</strong> or, <strong>ष्</strong>,but only of <strong>श्.</strong></p>
<p>Sanskrit and Prakrit <strong>स्</strong> becomes <strong>श्</strong> in his mouth. Thus the Bengalis of the present day possess the same vocal characteristic that is attributed to their ancestors, the speakers of the Māgadhī, by the Prakrit grammarians.</p>
<p>[Table 85 A : श्changed to छ्in the vernaculars]</p>
<p><strong>श्</strong> has a tendency to pass off into <strong>छ्</strong> as we observed in going over the Pali. For the Pali <strong>छक</strong> from the Skr. <strong>शकृत्</strong>‘cowdung,&rdquo; we have <strong>छेणु</strong> in S., <strong>छाणा</strong>in G., &amp;, from <strong>शकन्</strong>, another form of the word; and for the Pali <strong>छाप</strong>, Skr. <strong>शाव</strong>‘the young of an elephant,’we have <strong>छावा</strong> in H. M. &amp;c., the Pr. form being <strong>छाव</strong>. For the Skr. <strong>शेव</strong>the G. has <strong>छेवट, छेडो</strong>, and <strong>छेल्लो</strong>‘last,&rsquo; &rsquo;end,’ with the suffixes. <strong>ट, ड</strong> and <strong>ल</strong> ; for Skr. <strong>शल्ल</strong>‘rind,’ H. has <strong>छल्ली</strong>, for Skr. <strong>शण</strong> ‘hemp,’ O. has <strong>छण</strong> ; for <strong>मूत्रधार</strong>&lsquo;carpenter,’which is <strong>सुतार</strong>in the other dialects and must have been pronounced <strong>शुतार</strong>by the Bengalis, the B. has <strong>छुतार</strong>and O. also. Other instances may be found.</p>
<p>[Table 85 B : ष् changed to ख्in Hindi]</p>
<p>In Hindi Skr. <strong>ष्</strong>is often pronounced as <strong>ख्</strong> as in <strong>भाख</strong>for <strong>भाष</strong>, ‘spoken dialect&rsquo;, <strong>पुरुख</strong> for <strong>पुरुष</strong>, <strong>भेख</strong>for <strong>वेष, विखम</strong> for <strong>विषम</strong> &amp;c. This is to be identified with the practice of the followers of the Mādhyaṁdina recension of the White Yajurveda who read the <strong>ष्</strong>occurring in their books throughout as <strong>ख्</strong>. But other dialects also have a few instances of this change, as <strong>विख</strong>P. M. G., <strong>विखु</strong>S. for Skr. <strong>विष</strong>.</p>
<p>Of the Prakrit words in which a vowel or a mute is aspirated through the influence of an adjoining aspirate or an aspirated mute, the vernaculars have preserved the following :—</p>
<p>[Table 86: Mutes aspirated in the Prakrits and the Vernaculars]</p>
<p>Pr. <strong>पनस</strong>, M. G.<strong>फणस</strong>, Skr. <strong>पनस</strong>a Jacktree. The H. has also <strong>फनस</strong> but more commonly <strong>पनस</strong>.</p>
<p>Pr. <strong>भिस</strong>, M. <strong>भिसें</strong>, H. <strong>भिस</strong>, P. <strong>भेह</strong>, Skr. <strong>बिस</strong>edible lotus root. S. has <strong>बिहु</strong>.</p>
<p>Pr. <strong>खासिअ</strong>, G. H. P. <strong>खांसी</strong>, Skr. <strong>कासित</strong> cough.</p>
<p>There are a good many modern instances:—</p>
<p>[Table 87: Mutes aspirated in the Vernaculars]</p>
<p>M. <strong>फरशी</strong>, G. <strong>फरसी</strong>, H. <strong>फरसा</strong>, Skr. <strong>परशु</strong> an axe.</p>

<p>G. <strong>खसवुं</strong>,H. <strong>खिसना</strong>, Skr. <strong>कृष्यते</strong> to drop away, to be drown.</p>

<p><strong>[Table 86 A : Aspiration transferred]</strong></p>
<p>In some cases the aspirate sound is absorbed in the adjoining mute, and it ceases to exist as a separate component of a word. Thus, from the Pr. <strong>पहुडि</strong>, Skr. <strong>प्रभृति</strong>, we have the M. <strong>पुढें</strong>in <strong>ह्</strong> which the combines with <strong>ड्</strong>, and the M. <em>dial</em>. <strong>फुडें</strong>in which it combines with <strong>प्</strong>. In the same manner the Skr. <strong>मेष</strong>‘sheep&rsquo; becomes, with the usual Apabhraṁśa suffix <strong>ड</strong>or <strong>डअ, मेसडउ</strong> or <strong>मेहडउ</strong>, which in M. and G. assumes the form of <strong>मॆंढा</strong>and <strong>मॆंढा</strong>, the <strong>ह</strong> combining with <strong>ड</strong>. and in H. and P., of <strong>भेडा</strong>, in which the being combined with the preceding <strong>मे</strong> destroys the nasal character of the sound. P. has <strong>मेढा</strong>also, and G. <strong>भेडा</strong>, and B. and O. <strong>मेडा</strong>as well as <strong>भेडा</strong>. By a similar absorption of the <strong>ह्</strong> sound and the reduction of the nasal to a mere Anusvāra, we have H. P. <strong>भैंस</strong>(masc. <strong>भैंसा</strong>), G. <strong>भेंस</strong>, B.<strong>भंईश</strong>, from Skr. <strong>महिषी</strong>‘a female buffalo,&rsquo; and G. M. <strong>भेल</strong> from Pr. <strong>मिस्स</strong>, Skr. <strong>मिश्र</strong>with the suffix <strong>ल</strong>, through an intermediate form <strong>मिहल</strong> or <strong>मेहल</strong>. We have a more ancient instance of the process in the Pr. <strong>संभर</strong>for Skr. <strong>संस्मर</strong>, through the intermediate form <strong>संम्हर</strong>, which has been preserved by the G. in <strong>सांभरवुं</strong>&rsquo;to remember &lsquo;or &lsquo;remind.’</p>
<p>Sometimes a mute is aspirated without any appsrent resson in the Prakrits, and these instances have come down to some of the vernaculars : —</p>
<p>[Table 88 : Mutes aspirated]</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>कुब्ज</strong> humpbacked, Pr. <strong>खुज्जो</strong>, M. <strong>खुजा</strong>; but P. <strong>कोझा</strong>, H. <strong>कुंजा</strong>, B. <strong>कुंजो</strong>, O, <strong>कुंजा</strong>, S, <strong>कुबो</strong> ;M. <strong>कुबड़ा</strong> also.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>कीलकः</strong>a nail, Pr. <strong>खीलओ</strong>, M. <strong>खिला</strong>, G. <strong>खिलो</strong>, B.O. <strong>खील</strong> or <strong>खिला</strong>; the rest <strong>कील</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>कर्पर</strong> potsherd, an earthen cup, Pr. <strong>खप्पर</strong>, M. <strong>खापर</strong>, H. P. <strong>खप्पर</strong>, O. <strong>खपरा</strong> B. <strong>खाबरा</strong>.</p>

<p>M. <strong>घागर</strong>, P. H. <strong>गागर</strong>, Skr. <strong>गर्गरिका</strong>.</p>
<p>G. <strong>खोलो</strong>lap Skr. <strong>क्रोड</strong>.</p>
<p>Of the instances in the Prakrits in which the consonants contained in a word interchange places we have :—</p>
<p>[Table 89 : Interchange of Consonants]</p>

<p>M. <strong>शेपूट</strong> or <strong>शेपटी</strong> tail, G. having <strong>पूछडुं</strong>or <strong>पूछडी</strong>, Skr. <strong>पुच्छ</strong>, with the suffix <strong>ट</strong>, the <strong>छ्</strong> being changed to <strong>श्</strong>by the usual Mrule and the palatal vowel being brought in by the palatal <strong>श्</strong>.</p>
<p>M. <strong>थोडकें</strong>little, Pr.<strong>थोक्क</strong>, Skr.<strong>स्तोक</strong>, with the suffix <strong>ड</strong>.</p>
<p>S. <strong>छुगो</strong> abunch of flowers,Skr. <strong>गुच्छ ; हिलिडो</strong> loose, Pr. <strong>सिडिल</strong>, Skr. <strong>शिथिल</strong>.</p>

<p>TREATMENT OF SKR. CONJUNCTS IN THE VERNACULARS,</p>
<p>We will now trace in the vernaculars the Sanskrit conjunct consonants assimilated in the Pali and the Prakrits, in the order I have observed in treating of them in the lecture on the Pali. And first I will give a few instances of those in which the second member being strong prevails over the first and is doubled.</p>

<p>When <strong>व्</strong> as the latter member of a conjunct is heavily pronounced, the double consonant that takes the place of the conjunct is <strong>प्प</strong>, <strong>ब्ब</strong>, and <strong>ब्भ</strong> according as the preceding member is asurd, a sonant, or an aspirated sonant. Sometimes, when the preceding member is a dental, the substitutes are <strong>च्च</strong>, <strong>ज्ज</strong>, and <strong>ज्झ</strong>. The following are instances of these changes in the vernaculars:—</p>
<p>[Table 93 :व् as second member of a conjunct changed to प्प, ब्ब, ब्भ,च्च,ज्ज, ज्झ]</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>त्व</strong>abstract termination, Apabhr., <strong>प्प</strong>,H. <strong>पा</strong>as in <strong>बुढापा</strong>old age, <strong>मोटापा</strong> fatness, S <strong>पो</strong> as in <strong>माण्हिपो</strong>humanity, from <strong>माण्डु</strong>man.</p>

<p>Similarly <strong>आत्मन्</strong>, with the loss of the nasal sound of <strong>त्म</strong>, becomes <strong>अप्पण</strong> in the Prakrits and <strong>आपण</strong> in M. O. G. <strong>आपन</strong> in B., <strong>पाण</strong> in S. and <strong>आप</strong> in H.P.</p>
<p><strong>[DENTALS CHANGED TO PALATALS]</strong></p>
<p>Dentals have a tendency to become palatals even when not followed by <strong>य्</strong> or <strong>व्</strong>, probably because they do so become when followed by those semi-vowels. Thus, from the Skr. <strong>वादयति</strong> ‘to sound&rsquo; or &lsquo;play on a musical instrument,&rsquo; we have P. <strong>बजाउणा</strong>,H. <strong>बजाना</strong>, M. <strong>वाजविणें</strong>, &amp;c.; from Skr. <strong>निद्रा</strong>&lsquo;sleep,’ M. <strong>नीज</strong>; P. H. <strong>ओछा</strong>;&rsquo;trifling,&rsquo; &lsquo;vain&rsquo;, S. <strong>ओछा</strong>,from very probably, Skr. <strong>वृथा</strong> ;M. <strong>सावज</strong>,H. <strong>साजा</strong>from Skr. <strong>श्वापद</strong> which appears even in the Prakrits to have assumed the form of <strong>सावज</strong>,though <strong>सावय</strong>is usually given; M. H. G. <strong>छी छी</strong>, M. <strong>छे छे</strong>,Pr. <strong>छि छि</strong>from Skr. <strong>धिक् धिक</strong>&amp;c.</p>

H. <strong>बच्चा</strong>, S. <strong>बचो</strong>,B.<strong>बाच्चा</strong>, M.<strong>बच-[डें]</strong>, &amp;c., in the sense of ‘the young one of any animal,’ from the same.</p>

<p>Skr. <strong>उत्सङ्ग</strong>lap, Pr.<strong>उच्छङ्ग</strong>, H.<strong>उछंग</strong>, M. <strong>ओसंग</strong>.</p>
<p>The conjunct <strong>क्ष्</strong>sometimes appears in the Prakrits, and perhaps even in Sanskrit, in the form of <strong>झ्</strong>. The Sanskrit <strong>क्षर</strong> is <strong>ज्झर</strong>in the Prakrits, and this we have in the H. <strong>झरना</strong>, M. <strong>झरणें</strong> and <strong>पाझरणें</strong>in which last <strong>पा</strong>stands for the preposition <strong>प्र. क्षि</strong>is Pr. <strong>झिज्झ</strong>from which we have M;<strong>झिजणें</strong>&rsquo;to waste away&rsquo;, and from <strong>क्षीण</strong>we haveS. <strong>झीणो</strong>, H. <strong>झीन</strong>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>When <strong>र्</strong>followed by <strong>य्</strong> is changed to <strong>ल्</strong>, this last sound prevails. over the <strong>य्</strong>, and the conjunct becomes <strong>ल्ल्</strong> in the Prakrits. The following instances of this change have come down to the vernaculars:—</p>

<p>When <strong>क्</strong>, the first sound of <strong>क्ष्</strong>, prevails and adds to itself the heavy aspiration of <strong>ष्</strong>, the conjunct becomes <strong>क्ख्</strong>. Of this change there are many instances in the vernaculars :—</p>

<p>Skr. <strong>इक्षु</strong> sugar-cane, Pr. <strong>उक्लु</strong> or <strong>इक्खु</strong>, H. <strong>ऊख</strong> or<strong>ईख</strong>, P. <strong>इक्ख</strong>.</p>
<p>Though accordingto Hemacandra and Vararuci, the <strong>क्ष्</strong> of <strong>क्षेत्र, कुक्षि,अक्षि,क्षीर, मक्षिका</strong>and इक्षु<strong>i</strong>s changed to <strong>च्छ्</strong>in the Mahārāṣṭrl or principal Prakrit, still we see that most of the vernaculars derive their forms of these words from such Prakrit formal as had <strong>क्ख्</strong> for the Sanskrit <strong>क्ष्</strong>. But with the exception of <strong>इक्खु</strong>and <strong>खीर</strong> which are mentioned as occurring in the Jaina sacredbooks, these forms are not given as existing in any of the dialects.</p>
<p>This and other similar omissions show that the observation of the Prakrit grammarians was by no means perfect. The Marathi forms of these words, however, with the exception of <strong>अक्षि</strong>, which is unknown to the language, and of <strong>क्षीर</strong>,which is <strong>खीर</strong>,have <strong>म्</strong> or <strong>श्</strong>, which is representative of the Prakrit <strong>छ्</strong>, and hence they are the same as those given by Hemacandra and Vararuci. Here we have one of several indications that the modern Marathi is the direct daughter of the old Mahārāṣṭrlof the grammarians.</p>
<p>It will be seen from the lists given above that the Hindi, Gujarati, Marathi and Bengali mostly drop one component of the doubled consonants, and to make up for the quantity thus lost, lengthen the preceding vowel. In other words, the speakers of those dialects take the same time to pronounce two syllables the latter of which contains a double consonant which the speakers of the Prakrit did; but the preceding forcible vowel utterance and the subsequent strong contact and pressure being avoided, the effect is that one of the two consonants is dropped and the previous vowel lengthened. This then is essentially a case of softening.</p>
<p>The Sindhi drops one of the two consonants, but does not. lengthen the preceding vowel; while the Panjabi generally preserves. the doubled consonants handed down to it by the old Prakrits. The Hindi contains more instances in which the original Prakrit pronunciation is preserved than the other three dialects. Hemacandra notices in the Prakrits the softened pronunciation we have been considering in the case of only, one of which is according to him dropped and the preceding vowel is lengthened, as in <strong>पासइ</strong> for <strong>पस्सइ</strong>, Sk. <strong>पश्यति, मीसं</strong> for <strong>मिस्सं</strong>, Skr, <strong>मिश्रम्</strong>, &amp;c. This lengthening of the previous vowel is in the four dialects prevented, as observed <a href="http://#" title="1 See pp. 424-26,">before,</a> by the accent falling on a subsequent syllable.</p>
<p>In the ‘Pali and the Prakrits, you will remember, the components of some conjuncts such as <strong>र्य्, ई, र्श्, र्ष्, श्ल्, क्ल्, ग्ल्, म्ल्</strong>, &amp;c., are not assimilated but separated by the interposition of a vowel. The vernaculars have preserved some instances of this process:—</p>
<p>[Table 99 Interposition of a vowel between the members of a conjunct]</p>
<p>H. <strong>सराहना</strong> to praise, Pr. <strong>सलाह</strong> Skr. <strong>श्लाघ</strong>.</p>
<p>H. <strong>अगनी</strong>, P. <strong>अगन</strong>, B. <strong>आसुन</strong> fire, Pr. <strong>अगणी</strong> Skr. <strong>अग्नि</strong>.</p>
<p>H. <strong>बरस, बरिस</strong>, M. <strong>वरीस</strong> a year, Pr. <strong>वरिस</strong>, Skr. <strong>वर्ष</strong>. So also H. P.<strong>वरस-[ना-णा]</strong>,G. <strong>वरसवुं</strong>, Skr. <strong>वर्ष</strong>.</p>
<p>H. <strong>गिलान</strong> tired, Pr. <strong>गिलाण</strong>, Skr. <strong>ग्लान</strong>.</p>
<p>M. <strong>किलस</strong>disgust, Pr. <strong>किलेस</strong>, Skr. <strong>क्लेश</strong>distress.</p>
<p>M. <strong>शिलोक</strong>, stanza, Skr. <strong>श्लोक</strong> G. <strong>हरख</strong> joy, Skr. <strong>हर्प</strong> G. <strong>सलखम</strong>, P. Mg, Skr., are later instances of the same nature.</p>
<p>In modern times other conjuncts also are similarly dissolved, and we have a <strong>पर्ताप</strong>S. M., &amp;c. &rsquo;exploit&rsquo; for <strong>प्रताप, खेतर</strong>, P. G., &amp;c. &lsquo;a field&rsquo; for <strong>क्षेत्र, पदमु</strong>S. &lsquo;a lotus&rsquo; for <strong>पद्म, तियाग</strong>P. for <strong>त्या</strong>ग. <strong>तर्सु</strong>S., others <strong>तरास</strong>, &lsquo;vexation&rsquo; for <strong>त्रास, धरम</strong>&lsquo;virtue&rsquo; H. M. G., &amp;c., for <strong>धर्म</strong>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>But the books and dictionaries of some of these languages contain a good many Sanskrit words the conjuncts in which are not changed in any way. This is due to the fact that those languages are now the spoken languages of the educated as well as the uneducated portions of the different communities, and the former pronounce the words correctly, and the forms given to them by the latter are not taken into account by the authors of those books. Again, even the latter, though they interpose a vowel between the components of some conjuncts as shown above, have, to a certain extent, become used to Sanskrit sounds and can pronounce others correctly. But in some of the provinces. the old disability of the Prakrit speakers has been inherited in certain cases by their modern descendants, whether educated or uneducated, and it is very much to be regretted that the writers of books should in such cases write words in their Sanskrit forms. which, when they are read by themselves or others, are read in a quite different way.</p>
<p>The people of Sindh<strong>¹</strong>, whether belonging to the higher or lower classes, and the Bengalis pronounce the conjuct <strong>क्ष्</strong>invariably as <strong>क्ख्</strong>.Thus Sanskrit <strong>नक्षत्र</strong> as <strong>नक्खत्रसाक्षी</strong> as<strong>साखी, मोक्ष</strong> as<strong>मोक्ख</strong>or <strong>मोख</strong>,&amp;c. The speakers of the Hindi more often pronounce as <strong>चा</strong> than as <strong>क्ख्,नक्षत्र</strong> becoming <strong>नच्छंत्तर</strong> with them; <strong>साक्षी, साच्छी; मोक्ष मोच्छ ; लक्ष्मण, लच्छमन ; लक्षणा, लच्छना ; क्षत्रिय, खत्री</strong> or <strong>छत्री ; क्षय, छय ; क्षम, छम</strong> ;&amp;c. The Panjabis pronounce the first three words as <strong>साखी</strong>, and <strong>मोच्छ, लक्षण</strong> as<strong>लच्छण, क्षत्रिय</strong> as <strong>खत्रि</strong>, &amp;c. so that they also agree with the Hindi people, but seem more inclined towardsmaking <strong>क्ख्</strong> of the conjunct. The Marathas, however, pronounce the <strong>क्ष्</strong>properly, though ordinarily they make <strong>क्श्</strong> of it rather than <strong>क्-ष्</strong>, as remarked on a former occasion. Similarly, the Bengali assimilates conjuncts the latter member of which is <strong>व्</strong> or <strong>य्</strong>, <strong>ईश्वर</strong>becoming <strong>इश्शर</strong> and <strong>व्याख्यान बाक्खान</strong> in his mouth. Similarly be pronounces Skr. <strong>आत्मा</strong> as just as his Prakrit ancestors did though it is written correctly.</p>
<p>ASSIMILATION OF MEMBERS OF CONJUNCTS CONTAINING NASALS</p>
<p>Some of the vernaculars assimilate the components of a conjunct made up of a nasal and a mute. Thus the Panjabi hast <strong>डन्न</strong>for <strong>दण्ड</strong> &lsquo;penalty <strong>मुन्नणा</strong> for <strong>मुण्डना</strong> &rsquo;to shave <strong>सुन्न</strong> for <strong>सुण्ड</strong>, Skr. <strong>शुण्डा</strong>&rsquo;the trunk of an elephant&rsquo;, <strong>कन्नहा</strong> for <strong>कन्धा</strong>,Skr. <strong>स्कन्ध</strong>&lsquo;shoulder&rsquo;, <strong>बन्नह</strong>for <strong>बन्ध</strong> &lsquo;binding&rsquo;, <strong>खन्न</strong>for <strong>खन्ड</strong> &lsquo;a piece&rsquo;, <strong>भन्नणा</strong> &rsquo;to break for <strong>भङ्गना</strong> or<strong>भजना, थम्म</strong> for <strong>स्तम्भ</strong> &lsquo;a pillar, &amp;c.In the Bengali <strong>खान</strong> ‘a piece&rsquo;, one of the two <strong>न्</strong> sounds of <strong>खन्न</strong> is dropped and the preceding vowel lengthened. Similarly we have <strong>थाम</strong> ‘to stop’ from <strong>स्तम्भ</strong>. In Sindhi we have <strong>भञु</strong> ‘interruption&rsquo;,for<strong>भङ्ग, चङो</strong>&lsquo;good&rsquo; for <strong>चङ्गो</strong>, M. <strong>चांगला</strong> ;<strong>मञुठ</strong> &lsquo;madder&rsquo; for <strong>मञ्जिष्ट ; पिनु</strong>&lsquo;a ball’ for <strong>पिण्ड; खनु</strong> &lsquo;apiece of bread’ for <strong>खण्ड ; चुमणु</strong> &rsquo;to kiss’ for <strong>चुम्ब</strong>, &amp;c. Here the Sindhi, as is usual with him, drops one component of thedoubled consonants. With this exception, the modern dialects have got no cases of the assimilation of the members of a conjuner unknown to the Prakrits, while, as shown above, the speakers of those dialects tenaciously retain the vocal habit of assimilation of their Prakrit ancestors in a few cases.</p>

<p>1</p>
<p>While I was Head Master of the High School at Hyderabad in Sindh, I introduced about the beginning of 1865 the study of Sanskrit, and the first thing I had to do was to teach correct pronunciation to my pupils. I bad no great difficulty, so far as I can now remember, in making them pronounce the other conjuncts, but when I came to <strong>क्ष्</strong>, all ny endeavours to teach its correct pronunciation failed. I got the most intelligent of my boys to pronounce first <strong>क्</strong> and then <strong>ष्</strong>. This he did very well, whereupon I told him to utter both the sounds one after another immediately; but instead of making <strong>क्-ष्</strong>of them the invariably gave them the form o<strong>f क्ख्</strong>. I then gave up attempt in despair.</p>
<p>And now I close this part of my inquiry. The results at which we have arrived are these: — The vernaculars of Northern India contain the instances and, in some cases, a large number of them, given by the Prakrit grammarians or occurring in Prakrit literature, of every one of the rules or processes of change grouped by me under the heads of softening, assimilation, dissimilation, interchange of places, accentuation, and peculiarities by which Sanskrit words become Prakrit. Most of these processes have been continued and their rangewidened, to such an extent in some of the dialects as to render them distinctive characteristics of those dialects Other processes scarcely or rarely observable in the Prakrits have come into operation, such as the original accent on the penultimate syllable and the final accent derived from it, the avoiding of the hiatus caused by the elision of consonants in the Prakrits in different ways, the change of to and the dropping of one component of a double consonant and the lengthening of a previous vowel; and these have further transformed the Prakrit vocables and changed also those Sanskrit words that have been adopted in later times.</p>
<p>Some of the vocal tendencies and habits of the Prakrit speakers are exihibited by the speakers of the vernaculars. Thus, like the former, the ordinary Gujarati pronounces <strong>ऐ</strong>and <strong>औ</strong> as <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong>, the Deshastha Brahmans and other people of Eastern Mahārāṣṭra have a predilection for <strong>ण्</strong>to which they reduce <strong>न्</strong> in most <a href="http://#" title="I feel it necessary for the present thus to modify the assertion made in p. 454.">cases</a>, the Sindhis make <strong>क्ख्</strong> of <strong>क्ष्</strong>, the Bengalis do the same and also pronounce <strong>श्व्, ख्य्</strong> and <strong>त्म्</strong> as <strong>श्श्</strong>, and <strong>त्त</strong>, and the Hindi people reduce <strong>भ्</strong> to <strong>छ्</strong>. These again and the Konkan lower classes pronounce <strong>ण्</strong> as <strong>न्</strong> like the speakers of the Paiśācī, and the Bengali reduces all the sibilants to <strong>श्</strong>like the speakers of the Māgadhi; while the speakers of the Hindi, Sindhi and the Panjabi exhibit the old Mahārāṣṭri and Śaurasenl characteristic of reducing them to <strong>स्</strong>.</p>
<p>The tendency to pronounce dentals as cerebrals is common to all, though it appears in a very strong form in the mouth of the Sindhis, and next to them in that of the Panjabis and the Hindi people.</p>
<p>The general or almost universal elision of certain uninitial consonants, which was a characteristic of the Prakrits, has disappeared except in isolated cases, and the assimilation of the components of a conjunct, which was also very general, hast become restricted to the few cases I have mentioned, though the words changed in the Prakrits in accordance with these two processes have come down to us in large numbers. While, therefore, this fact shows that the speakers of the Prakrits were in a condition which rendered the two phenomena very general in their speech, and that we are now free from it, the fact that we exhibit some of the same vocal peculiarities which they possessed leads to the conclusion that we are their successors or lineal descendants. And the fact that the vocables in ordinary use in our modern dialects are the same as those in the old Prakrits, whether of a Deśya or Sanskrit origin, and in the latter case, whether derived by the transformation of Sanskrit words in accordance with processes which have ceased or which have continued to operate in the vernaculars, affords strong evidence in favour of the hypothesis that these dialects are but a more developed form of the Prakrits. But to place this hypothesis beyond the reach of cavil we must examine the grammar of our vernaculars; and this I propose doing in the next two lectures.</p>
<p>LECTURE V</p>
<p>REMNANTS OF THE OLDER GRAMMATICAL FORMS IN THE NORTHERN VERNACULARS</p>
<p>I have already directed your attention to the accent on the penultimate syllable of words in the vernaculars of Northern India and the effect it has had in mutilating and transforming the Sanskrit and Prakrit words existing in their vocabularies. Through its influence, you will remember, the final vowel or the vowel of the last syllable is shortened in some cases, and often entirely dropped and the word ends in a consonant or silent . When the consonant of the last syllable is dropped in consequence of the Prakrit law of the elision of uninitial consonants, the final vowel and the vowel of the penultimate syllable are brought together and when they are in this condition, it is possible for them to unite into one sound and thus the final vowel is dropped in some cases and combined with the preceding in others. The Sindhi, however, oftentimes resists the influence of this accent as I have already mentioned.</p>
<p>CASE TERMINATIONS IN THE VERNACULARS.</p>
<p>Now on account of these processes, the nominative singular termination <strong>ओ</strong> of masculine Prakrit nouns ending <strong>अ</strong> in is sometimes shortened to <strong>उ</strong>and in this form we have it in the Sindhi and in old Marathi and Hindi literature. In the other dialects. including the modern Marathi and Hindi, it is dropped except in instances such as <strong>वाटसरु</strong>M. and** आयसु** &lsquo;command&rsquo; H. The Prakrit plural terminations <strong>अ</strong>and <strong>ए</strong> of this case are also dropped everywhere for the same reason and we have such forms as <strong>हाथ</strong>S., <strong>हाथ</strong> H., <strong>हात</strong> M. G. &amp;c. for the nom. pl. and these are the sing. forms also except in the case of the Sindhi, which has <strong>हथु</strong>.</p>
<p>In the Prakrit the plurals of the nominative and accusative cases of all nouns are alike and so are they alike in the vernaculars. The analogy came to be extended to the singulars also in the Apabhraṁśa and accordingly the singulars of the two cases. are the same in the vernaculars. An independent accusative</p>
<p>case made up by affixing a termination to a noun is given in ordinary grammars; but it has the sense of the dative, or rather of the Sanskrit genitive, which expresses relation in general. Thus we say <strong>मी काम करितों</strong> M. ‘I do work,’ <strong>हूं काम करूं छूं</strong>G., <strong>आंवकमुथो कर्यां</strong> B., <strong>मै कमकरदा</strong> P., <strong>मैकाम करता हूं</strong> H., <strong>आमि</strong> or <strong>मुइ काम करि</strong> or <strong>करिते छि</strong> B., <strong>मु कर्मकरु अछि</strong> O., in which instances <strong>काम</strong>etc. are really accusatives and we do not use <strong>कामास, कामने, कमखे, कमनु, कामको, कामके</strong> and <strong>कर्मकु</strong>, which forms are generally referred to the accusative.</p>
<p>The masculine nom, and acc. sing. form in<strong>उ</strong> was in the Apabhraṁśa extended by analogy to the neuter singular also; and, though the peculiar neuter plural termination was preserved, the fact shows that in the vernacular speech of the times there was a tendency to forget the distinction between the two genders. Accordingly we now find that in the Sindhi, the Panjabi, the Hindi, Bengali and Oriya the distinction is entirely lost. In Gujarati also nouns ending in <strong>अ</strong>have retained none of the two neuter terminations, but the Prakrit and Apabhraṁśa <strong>इं</strong> plural of that gender exists in the Marathi combined with the preceding <strong>अ</strong>into <strong>एं</strong> as ‘a fruit&rsquo; sing., <strong>फलें</strong> &lsquo;fruits&rsquo; pl.</p>
<p>This neuter pl. termination is applied in Hindi, Sindhi, and Panjabi to the pl. of fem. nouns ending in <strong>अ</strong> as in <strong>रातें</strong>&rsquo;nights&rsquo; H., <strong>जाला</strong>‘women&rsquo; S. and <strong>गल्लां</strong>&lsquo;words&rsquo; P., though the <strong>इ</strong>is changed to <strong>आ</strong>in the last two cases.</p>
<p>The change of the final syllables <strong>अओ</strong>of Prakrit words resulting from such Sanskrit words as <strong>आम्रातकः-को, पारदः-दो, दीपकः-को</strong> etc. to <strong>आ</strong>by the dropping of the final and lengthening of the penultimate through the force of the general accent on the penultimate in some of the modern dialects such as the Marathi and the Hindi and to <strong>ओ</strong>, into which the two vowels are combined in consequence of the weakness of the accent in such languages as the Gujarati and the Sindhi and in some of the minor dialects of the Marathi, has already been noticed in the last lecture. Similarly the change of the Prakrit final syllables of neuter nouns <strong>अअं</strong>or <strong>अयं</strong> arising from such Sanskrit words as <strong>कदलकम, मस्तकम्</strong> have been changed to <strong>एं</strong> in the Marathi and to <strong>उं</strong> in Gujarati and to <strong>आं</strong>in some of the dialects of the Marathi. This also has been explained. The pl. of such neuter nouns, most of which are formed by</p>
<p>the addition of <strong>क</strong>and may be called augmented nouns, is formed by the addition of the Apabhraṁśa <strong>इं</strong>, which being rendered emphatic by the nasal sound absorbs the previous <strong>अ</strong>or light <strong>य</strong> and thus wehave <strong>केलीं</strong> for Ap. <strong>कअलअ+ इं</strong>= Skr. <strong>कदलक + आनि</strong>.</p>
<p>Fem. nouns in <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>ई</strong> add <strong>आं</strong> as<strong>घोडी-घोडियां</strong> H., <strong>घोडिआं</strong> P. This <strong>यां</strong>or <strong>आं</strong>represents the combination of <strong>य</strong>or <strong>अ</strong>with <strong>इं</strong>; such nouns as घोडीbeing derived from <strong>घोटिका = घोडिआ</strong>. In Panjabi after fem. nouns in <strong>आ</strong> the <strong>ईं</strong> appears distinct, as <strong>बला</strong> a calamity, <strong>बलाईं</strong> nom. pl. In Sindhi the neuter termination is added to the original Prakrit fem. pl. <strong>उ</strong>, shortened from <strong>ओ</strong>, <strong>घोड्यूं</strong>&lsquo;mares&rsquo;nom. pl. <strong>हचा</strong>&lsquo;murder&rsquo; <strong>हचाऊं</strong>‘murders&rsquo;; <strong>जाल</strong>a &lsquo;woman,&rsquo; <strong>जालूं</strong>&lsquo;women&rsquo; nom. pl. This last <strong>जालां</strong> has it also like the P. <strong>रातां</strong>. In Marathi also it is not very unusual to speak of women in the neuter pl. when respect is intended as <strong>राणींसाहेब आलीं</strong>. This transference of neuter termination to the fem. must have taken place when gendersbegan to be confused in the Apabhraṁśa period.</p>
<p>The nom. pl. termination of masc. nouns, which in the Prakrit was <strong>आ</strong>,is preserved by the class of nouns we have been considering i. e. augmented nouns, in Sindhi and Gujarati; while the <strong>ए</strong> of the Prakrit acc. pl. is used for those nouns in the Marathi and its dialects and the Hindi and the Panjabi. When the two cases were thoroughly confounded, one can easily see how this came to pass. Other or unaugmented nouns have dropped both the terminations in all the languages, as has been already noticed.</p>
<p>The Marathi has preserved the Apabhramsa instr. sing. <strong>एं</strong> which is used after nouns in <strong>अ</strong> and the plural <strong>हिं</strong>reduced to <strong>इं</strong>. In all the modern languages the <strong>ह</strong> of the Apabhraṁśaforms is dropped. These terminations are appended to the old instrumental termination <strong>न</strong> and we have <strong>नें</strong>and <strong>नीं</strong>which are now ordinarily used. These you will see are double forms and of such we have many in the various languages. Goan., Mal. and Cit. have <strong>न्</strong> for the sing. and the last has <strong>इं</strong>for the pl.</p>
<p>The loc. Apabhraṁśa<strong>हिं</strong>from the Pali <strong>म्हि</strong>and the Skr. <strong>स्मिन्</strong>is also used, as <strong>घरीं गेला</strong>; this is peculiar to nouns in <strong>अ</strong>, and in Marathi it is reduced to <strong>आं</strong>after the augmented nouns in <strong>आ</strong>, as <strong>गलां, माथां</strong>etc. There are instances of the other locative in <strong>ए</strong>such as <strong>मध्ये</strong> and <strong>मते (माझ्या मते तुम्ही जाये</strong> ‘you should go in my opinion,’</p>
<p>where <strong>मते</strong>is hardly an instrumental); but here evidently the termination <strong>ए</strong> is confounded with the <strong>एं</strong> of the instrumental and we have <strong>माझ्या मतें</strong>lit. &ldquo;by my opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dative <strong>स</strong> is generally considered a remnant of the Skr.<strong>स्य</strong>and Pr.<strong>स्स</strong>. But I have not found it in the Jñaneśvarīand in its place we have <strong>शीं</strong>in the old poets, which is connected with a similar post-position in other languages which will be considered hereafter. None of the minor dialects of the languages have anything like it, but still the derivation may be correct.</p>
<p>Gujarati has the old instrumental in <strong>एं</strong>, but it is confounded. with the corresponding <strong>ए</strong> of the fem. and with the locative <strong>ए</strong> and we have one termination for both, with the nasal dropped. The shortened Apabhraṁśa form in <strong>इ</strong> is found in old Gujarati. It is confounded with that in <strong>इं</strong>, the anusvāra being dropped.</p>
<p><strong>(1) कान्हतणइसंपत्ति इसी जिसी इंद्रह घरि रिद्धि &hellip;&hellip; राजभवनि नवनिधि.</strong></p>
<p>&lsquo;The wealth or affluence of Kanha was as great as that of Indra.&quot;</p>
<p>From the chronicle of Kanhadade-prabandha given in the Gujarati School-paper.</p>
<p>(2) पछि हं माइरी गमि आव्यो। पछिंबीजे दिनि.</p>
<p>Pancopākhyāna, the story of Hiraṇyaka.</p>
<p>In this latter, however, there occurs an anusvāra, which should be correct, the termination is a remnant <strong>हिं</strong>. The Gujarati has also the double instrumental णेंin pronouns, as <strong>तेंणें, जेंंणें</strong>, etc.</p>
<p>The Sindhi has got the ablative terminations <strong>आं, ओं, ऊं,अउ</strong>and <strong>आउ</strong>. The first is from the pronominal instrumental <strong>हां</strong>of the Apabhraṁśaand <strong>म्हा</strong>of the Prakrit; <strong>ओं</strong>and <strong>ऊं</strong> from <strong>हुं</strong> of the former <strong>अउ</strong> and <strong>आउ</strong> and from the corresponding Prakrit. The locative <strong>ए</strong> and its shortened form <strong>इ</strong> are also preserved, but they are used after nouns in <strong>अ</strong>as in the older dialects, as <strong>खुहि</strong>or <strong>खुहेपिओ</strong>&lsquo;he fell into a well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Panjabi possesses the abl. in <strong>हुं</strong>with the <strong>ह</strong> dropped and the <strong>उं</strong> amalgamated with the preceding <strong>अ</strong>into <strong>ओं</strong>as <strong>घरॊं</strong>‘from a house, the locative pl. <strong>हिं</strong>as <strong>घरीं</strong> ‘in the house,’ the instrumental pl. <strong>हिं</strong>as <strong>उअसदें हथीं</strong>‘by the hands’ and the locative sing. in <strong>ए</strong> as <strong>उसदोदरगाहे</strong>‘in his court.’ The instr. in <strong>नें</strong> is also ordinarily used in the form of <strong>नैं</strong>.</p>
<p>The Hindi has scattered instances of the loc. in <strong>एं</strong>, but the instrumental <strong>ने</strong>is common. The Bengali has preserved the former. The instrumental also has <strong>ए</strong>, though the grammarians do not give it, as—</p>
<p><strong>सरोवर मध्ये हंस देखि रूपवती।<br>
परिवार मानसे चलिस शीघ्र गति॥</strong></p>
<p>‘The beautiful one having seen the swan in the lake went in haste with a desire to catch it.’</p>
<p><strong>शनिया भैमीर मन अनङ्गे पीडिल।</strong></p>
<p>‘Having heard (this) the heart of Bhaimīwas oppressed by love.’</p>
<p><strong>गगनथाले केमन दीपरूपे अनुक्षण<br>
शोभि छे शशीतपन</strong></p>
<p>&lsquo;How do the moon and the sun in the form of lamps shine in the plate of the sky !’</p>
<p>The Oriya also possesses the loc. in <strong>ए</strong>and as in the B. and G. it is confounded with the instr. in <strong>एं</strong>, the nasal being lost, as <strong>हातें</strong>&lsquo;in or by the hand.’ This dialect has the Pr. abl. in <strong>उ</strong>also as <strong>हातु</strong>&lsquo;from the hand.’</p>
<p>The nom. pl <strong>ओ</strong>or <strong>उ</strong>of fem. nouns in <strong>आ</strong> or<strong>ई</strong> is preserved in the Mal., Goan and Cit. as <strong>जीभ, जिभो ; साडी, साड्यो;</strong> and <strong>घोडी, घोड्यो</strong> ;but the two latter are derived from the Skr. <strong>शाटिका</strong>and <strong>घोटिका</strong>which are nouns ending in <strong>आ</strong>. The final <strong>आ</strong>, which alone. remains after the elision of the consonant <strong>क्</strong>, is dropped in consequence of the penultimate accent and we have <strong>साडी</strong> and <strong>घोडी</strong>. The <strong>ओ</strong>or <strong>उ</strong> of the plural of the original Prakrit <strong>साडिआओ-उ</strong>also isdropped like the <strong>ओ</strong> or <strong>उ</strong> of <strong>घोडओ-उ</strong> in the ordinary Marathi <strong>घोडा</strong>;and, just as the previous vowel; in this latter is lengthened in consequence the accent and the resulting form is <strong>घोडा</strong>, so the previous <strong>आ</strong> of <strong>साडिआ-ओ-उ</strong> and <strong>घोडिआ-ओ-उ</strong>, being accented, remains and we have <strong>साड्या</strong>, and <strong>घोड्या</strong>for <strong>साडिआ</strong> and <strong>घोडिआ</strong>; but in the dialects of the Marathi, in which the <strong>ओ</strong>or <strong>उ</strong>Masc. nouns in the sing. is preserved, we have <strong>घोडो</strong>and <strong>कांटो</strong>etc.; so also is the <strong>ओ-उ</strong>of the fem. preserved and we have , <strong>साड्यो,घोड्यो</strong>etc.</p>
<p>As to unaugmented fem. nouns in <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>ई</strong>, the final is, of course,dropped by the penultimate accent, but in the plural it ispreserved, being accented, and the termination of the plural <strong>ओ</strong>-<strong>उ</strong>which is unaccented is dropped, as <strong>वेल</strong> sing., <strong>वेली</strong> pl., Skr. <strong>वल्लि</strong>,&lsquo;creeper&rsquo;;<strong>बहिण</strong> sing., <strong>बहिणी</strong> pl. Skr. <strong>भगिनी</strong> &lsquo;sister; <strong>कस</strong> sing.<strong>कुसी-शी</strong>pl. &lsquo;sides&rsquo;;<strong>केल</strong> sing., <strong>केली</strong>pl., Skr. <strong>कदली</strong>etc.</p>
<p>As in the dialects of the Marathi, the pl. <strong>ओ</strong> is preserved inGujarati; but there it is transferred to the pl. of all nouns whatever and the process is going on even in our times, beingextended to the masc. nouns ending in <strong>ओ</strong> also, which formedtheir nom. and acc. pl. formerly by adding <strong>आ</strong>, as <strong>घोडो</strong> sing., <strong>घोडा</strong>pl., but now often <strong>घोडाओ</strong>. The sindhi also has preserved thefem. <strong>ऊ</strong>, as I have already observed, but the nasal of the neuter iscombined with it to form the nom, and acc. pl.</p>
<p><strong>PRONOUNS IN THE VERNACULARS</strong></p>
<p>The nom. sing. of the relative pronoun is in <strong>जो</strong> M. H. P. S. and<strong>जे</strong> in G. O. and B. O. have <strong>जेउं</strong> also. The <strong>ए</strong> of the latter is anotherform of the nom, a to be traced perhaps to the old Magadhl nom.Sing. as in <strong>ऐसे पुलिस</strong> for Skr. <strong>एषः पुरुषः</strong>. The correlative is <strong>तो</strong> in M.and H. and <strong>ते</strong> in G. and <strong>सो</strong> in P. S. and <strong>से</strong> in B. and O. TheHindi has <strong>सो</strong> also. The <strong>सो</strong>is the old Pr. nom. sing., but theoblique base in P. S. B. and O. is the old <strong>त</strong>.</p>
<p>The base of the interrogative pronoun is क as in the olderlanguages. The nom. sing. is <strong>कौन</strong> H., <strong>कौण</strong> P. and <strong>कोण</strong> G.M.and<strong>के</strong> O. and B.—also <strong>केउं</strong> O. The <strong>कोण</strong>and its varieties are to be tracedto the Pr. <strong>कउण</strong>which stands for the Skr. <strong>कः पुनः</strong>.</p>
<p>The near demonstrative is <strong>इह</strong>or <strong>एह</strong>in H. P. nom. sing, whichis also pronounced in other ways; and the nom. pl. <strong>ये</strong>. The first is to be referred to the Ap. <strong>एहो</strong>, Pr. <strong>एसो</strong>, skr. <strong>एषः</strong>; and thelatter to <strong>आये</strong> Ap. The <strong>अय</strong> of the Skr. <strong>अयम्</strong>is generalised in thislanguage and is to be found in all cases of the pronoun. Hence<strong>आये</strong>is the nom. pl. The G. has <strong>ए</strong>, M. <strong>हा</strong> m., <strong>ही</strong>fem., <strong>हें</strong> n., —dial.<strong>हो-ही-ह्यां</strong> for the nom. sing., and the regular <strong>हे</strong> m., <strong>ह्या</strong>. fem., <strong>हीं</strong> n. forthe pl.; O. has <strong>ए, एहि, इहि</strong> nom. sing., and B. <strong>ए</strong>all of which arefrom the Ap. <strong>एहो-एह</strong> or <strong>एहु</strong>.The general oblique base is <strong>य</strong> or <strong>ह</strong> inM., <strong>ए</strong> G., <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>हि</strong> S., and <strong>इ</strong> in the rest, the origin of which is the</p>
<p>same, M. <strong>य</strong>, however, being referred to the Ap. <strong>आय</strong> which is thegeneralised form of <strong>इद</strong>म्.</p>
<p>The distant demonstrative has <strong>उ</strong> for its base. The nom, sing. inH. is <strong>उ, ओ, वह</strong>, pl. <strong>वे</strong>; in P. <strong>उह</strong>, S. <strong>हू</strong> and <strong>हो</strong> and B. <strong>ओ</strong>for both.The S. has also for the sing. G. has <strong>आ</strong> for the sing. and itsusual <strong>आओ</strong> for the pl. All these are to be derived from the Ap.<strong>ओ</strong> nom. and <strong>ओइ</strong> acc. pl., traced to <strong>असु</strong> of the Skr. pronoun <strong>अदम्</strong>.The M. and O. have lost this pronoun.</p>
<p><strong>PERSONAL PRONOUNS IN THE VERNACULARS</strong></p>
<p>The nom. sing. of the first personal pronoun in M. is <strong>मी</strong> and Cit.<strong>मे</strong> both of which are to be traced to the Ap. acc. instr. and loc. <strong>मइं</strong>,Pr. <strong>मइ</strong>, Skr. <strong>मया</strong> and <strong>मयि</strong>. The Goon.has <strong>हांव</strong>, the G. <strong>हुं</strong>, old H. dialects <strong>हौ. हुं,</strong> the Dogar dialect of the P. <strong>हउं</strong>, which are all from theAp. <strong>हउं</strong> to be traced to the Skr. <strong>अहकम्</strong>¹, the <strong>उ</strong>of which is, you willremember, that of the nom. sing, which in that dialect was freelyused as the G. si is at present. The Sindhi si and si are furthercorruptions of these. H. P. have also <strong>मैं</strong> like the Cit. <strong>मे</strong> the originof both being the same. The B. and O. have <strong>मुइ</strong> and <strong>मु</strong> which maybe traced to the Ap. abl. and gen. sing. <strong>महु</strong>, but I should preferconsidering the <strong>इ</strong> of the Ap. and M. forms to be changed to <strong>उ</strong> inconsequence of the usual fondness of the B. and O. for the <strong>उ</strong> soundas noticed in the last lecture.</p>
<p>The pl. of this pronoun in M. is <strong>आह्मी</strong>, dial. <strong>आमी</strong>, B. <strong>आमि</strong>, which is the same as the Ap. <strong>अह्मइ</strong> traced by me to the Skr. <strong>अस्मके</strong>.The G. <strong>अमे</strong> and the O. <strong>अम्भे</strong>are from the usual Ap, and Pr. from <strong>अह्मे</strong>from <strong>अस्मे</strong>generalised from the usual Skr. base <strong>अस्म</strong> by false analogy. In <strong>अम्भे, ह्य</strong>is changed to <strong>म्भ</strong> as it often is. The H. <strong>हम</strong>is this<strong>अह्म</strong> but the aspiration is transferred to the initial <strong>अ</strong>, and the <strong>म</strong>, towhich it is attached in the older and the other dialect, is left free.The termination <strong>अ</strong> is also dropped. The S. and P. have <strong>असीं</strong>. Skr. <strong>स्म</strong>is sometimes changed in the Pr. to <strong>स्म</strong> as in the Māgadhī and Mah.from locative; but in the written Prakrits that have been handeddown to us, the <strong>अस्म</strong> of <strong>अस्मद्</strong> is not found corrupted to <strong>स्स</strong>. It may,however, have been so in some part of the country.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1. Mr. Beames traces them to <strong>हमु</strong> Ap., <strong>अहमम्</strong>Skr., but such forms do not exist.Prof. Lassen to whom he refers, only conjectures <strong>अहमं</strong>to account for <strong>अहअं</strong>,but <strong>अहअं</strong>is clearly derived from <strong>अहकम्</strong>which exists even in Skr. The reading <strong>हमु</strong> in the passage from Kramādīśvara given by Lassen is questionable.Hemacandra has <strong>हउं</strong> distinctly and the form oscurs in many verses.</p>
<p>The second person sing.is in <strong>तूं</strong> all the languages except B.which has <strong>तुइ</strong>. The H. has <strong>तैं</strong> also. Of these <strong>तूं</strong> is the same as theAp. <strong>तुहं</strong>, the <strong>ह</strong> of this dialect being, as you know, dropped throughout; and <strong>तुह</strong> and <strong>तैं</strong>are transferred from the instrumental. The pl.is <strong>तुम्ही</strong> in M. from the Ap. <strong>तुम्हइ</strong>similar to <strong>अम्हइ</strong>, and the B. <strong>तुमि</strong>issoftened from this. The G. has <strong>तमे</strong>, softened from <strong>तुम्हे</strong>, the <strong>उ</strong> beingchanged to <strong>अ</strong> by a peculiarity of the Gujarati, which has beenfully noticed in the last lecture. In the O. <strong>तुह्म</strong> the final <strong>ए</strong> is dropned and a softened form of this is the Hindi तुम. The P. has तुसींto be darived from <strong>तुम</strong> or <strong>युष्म</strong> in the same way as <strong>असीं</strong> from <strong>अस्म</strong>.The S has <strong>तव्हीं, तवीं, तहीं, तईं, अन्हां, अव्हीं, अवी, अहीं, आईं</strong> and <strong>अईं</strong>. In <strong>तव्हीं</strong> we have the <strong>अ</strong>to which <strong>उ</strong> is reduced as in G, and the <strong>म्</strong> of <strong>ह्मी</strong> analysed into its labial and nasal elements. The other three are softenedforms of this same, and in the rest the initiala त is dropped as wehave seen it dropped in the Pr. in the bases <strong>उह्म</strong> for <strong>तुह्म</strong>, <strong>उज्झ</strong> for<strong>तुज्झ, उब्भ</strong>for <strong>तुब्भ</strong>and <strong>उय्ह</strong> for <strong>तुह्य</strong>, both of which exist in thatdialect.</p>
<p><strong>THE VERB IN THE VERNACULARS</strong></p>
<p>The Skr. conjugational distinction is, you will remember, lostin the Prakrits; but the increments that roots undergo in theseveral classes, are preserved and made parts of the roots themselves. Now these roots so augmented have descended to thevernaculars Thus we have <strong>विह</strong>old M. G. &rsquo;to fear&rsquo; from the Skr.<strong>बिभी</strong> of the 3rd class; <strong>बुझ</strong> M. G. &rsquo;to understand,&rsquo; <strong>सिज</strong> M.&rsquo; to becooked, <strong>विझ</strong> S. &rsquo;to throw, &rsquo; M. G. H., etc.to dance,<strong>उपज</strong>M. G. &rsquo;to be born,&rsquo;<strong>निपज</strong> M. G. &rsquo;to issue forth,&rsquo;<strong>जुझ</strong> M. &rsquo;to fight,&rsquo;<strong>माज</strong> M. G. &rsquo;to be maddened&rsquo; and <strong>खिज</strong> old M. G. &rsquo;to be sad&rsquo; fromthe Skr. <strong>बुध्य, स्विद्य, विध्य, मृत्य, उत्पद्य, निष्पद्य, युध्य, माद्य</strong> and <strong>स्विद्य</strong>, all balonging to the 4th class; <strong>सुन</strong> or <strong>सुण</strong> H. S. B. P. O. from Skr. <strong>गृण</strong>of the5th; <strong>आण</strong> M. G. H. P. etc. to know, <strong>क्रिण</strong> B.O.&rsquo;to buy&rsquo; and <strong>गिण्ह</strong>S.&rsquo; to take&rsquo; from the Skr., <strong>जाना, क्रीण</strong> and <strong>गृह्वा</strong> of the 9th class. Wehave roots also in the forms which they have in the second andsixth classes, as <strong>म्हा</strong>and <strong>जा</strong>from <strong>स्ना</strong> and <strong>या</strong> of the 2nd, and <strong>लिख, लिह, तुट, फुट, लिंप</strong>, M., <strong>लिंव</strong> S., <strong>कांत</strong> (Skr. <strong>कृन्त</strong>), also <strong>काट</strong>&rsquo;to out,&rsquo; <strong>सिंच्च</strong> fromthe 6th.</p>
<p><strong>VERBAL TERMINATIONS THE PRESENT</strong></p>
<p>Of the three Pr. tenses and moods the Marathi has preservedtwo, the Present and the Imperative. The third, viz. the Future,is not lost, but the form became by phonetic corruption similarto those of the Present and you will remember, that the differencebetween the two tenses consisted in the intercalatory <strong>स्य</strong>, afterwards dissolved into <strong>सि</strong>, and thence softened to <strong>हि</strong>, which, havingdropped its <strong>ह</strong> in the vernaculars, melted away and another signhad to be added to the Present forms to indicate the Future. ThePresent was used in old Marathi and is used even at present inpoetry, but in ordinary speech it has acquired a past habitualsense. It has a potential signification in some cases as <strong>मी येइं तेथपर्यंत तेथें थांब</strong>.In the Gujarati it has acquired a potential sense inaddition to the old and, to indicate present time distinctly, theforms of the present tense of the substantive verb are used in conjunction with it, as <strong>हुं करुं छुं</strong>. The Brajbhāṣã agrees with the G.in this respect and adds its it <strong>हैं</strong> as <strong>मैं करौं हैं</strong>. In the H. P. and S. itsignifies potentiality only, and in the last āmasc., āfem, areadded to the forms to denote present time. <strong>थो</strong> is the past part, ofthe root <strong>थिअणु</strong>from Skr. <strong>स्थित</strong>, Pr. <strong>थिअ</strong>, which means &lsquo;become&rsquo;
inSindhi. The old Hindi or Braj poots use this tense in the presentalso. In all these languages, however, the old Present tense ofthe auxiliary <strong>अम्</strong> or <strong>आम्</strong> indicates present time alone. B. O. preserve this tense in the old sense throughout.</p>
<p>M. has two forms of this old Present :—</p>

<p>In poetry we have ति and सि for त and स as—</p>
<p>मुचिया काजाचेनि पांडे। देखती आपुलें जीतित्व थोकडें ॥</p>
<p>Jñāneśvarī, I. 112.</p>
<p>ऐशी सामग्री माझ्या आंगी जाणसी तूं।</p>
<p>Jñāneśvarī, III. 162.</p>
<p>The termination <strong>इं</strong> of the first person sing. is derived from thePr. <strong>मि, म्</strong>, being simply converted into an anusvärs, *i. e.,*<strong>मि</strong> when</p>
<p>pronounced without closing the lips, becomes <strong>इं</strong>. In the same waythe Pr. <strong>मु</strong> of the pl. becomes <strong>उं</strong>. The 2nd per. sing. <strong>सि</strong> remainsunaltered, but in ordinary usage the final <strong>इ</strong> is dropped inconsequence of the usual accent on the penultimate. The <strong>ह</strong> ofPr. pl. loses its aspiration, as we have found it to have done in theand thus we have <strong>कर + अ = करा</strong>. The 3rd per. sing. terminationis the same as in pr., viz. <strong>इ</strong>. The pl. has lost its nasal and incurrent Marathi they <strong>इ</strong> also , on account of the penultimate accent.</p>
<p>In the other set the 3rd per. sing. termination is <strong>ए</strong>, the same asin Pr., and to be traced to the Skr. <strong>ते</strong> of the Ātm. In the Prakritthere is no Ātmanepada termination for the 1st per. sing., butstill we have <strong>एं</strong> there. This vowel is inserted before all theconsonantal terminations of the present tense of the verb <strong>आहे</strong>.We have also <strong>ई</strong> in <strong>करीस</strong> and <strong>करीत</strong>, though it has no place in the Pr.This is probably due to the transference of the final <strong>इ</strong> in <strong>करसी</strong>and <strong>करती</strong> to the penultimate syllable.</p>
<p>The first of the two, i. e., the Parasm, set of forms, is used fortransitive verbs and the second or Ātmanepade for those that areintransitive and some that are transitive but denote a sort ofreflexive action as <strong>पढ</strong> &rsquo;to read&rsquo;, <strong>शिक</strong> to &rsquo;learn&rsquo;, <strong>बोल</strong> &rsquo;to speak&rsquo;, <strong>सांग</strong>&rsquo;to tell&rsquo;, etc.</p>
<p>The Cit. has both the padas and the एof the Ātm. is confinedto the 3rd pers sing. in the root <strong>अस</strong> as <strong>तो से</strong> but <strong>मेंसां</strong> or <strong>सइं</strong>. Inthe Mal, we have आ, and the Goan. <strong>अ</strong> long for <strong>ए</strong> as <strong>आसा</strong>, <strong>धावा</strong>and<strong>अस</strong>, the final <strong>अ</strong> being long. In these dialects the 2nd pers. pl.termination is <strong>त</strong>, which is transferred from the corresponding 3rdor is a remnant of the Pr. <strong>इत्था</strong> and the vowels of the first pers.form vṛddhi dipthongs with the preceding base in both the padas;as <strong>मी करैे</strong>&lsquo;I do&rsquo;, or &lsquo;I used to do&rsquo;, <strong>आम्ही करौं</strong>we do^(<strong>1</strong>),&rsquo; or &lsquo;used to do.&lsquo;The Goan, and Cit., however, have the first pers. sing. Ātm.in <strong>आं</strong> also. The Ätm, is not used for roots ending in other vowelsthan <strong>अ</strong>. though tney may be intransitive, as <strong>म्हा, जा, हो, दे,</strong> etc.,andin this particular the Marathi remarkably agrees with the old Pr.<br>
___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1. These vṛddhi forms appear to be due to the penultimate <strong>अ</strong> being pronouncedlong through the accent according to the usual rule and by the combinationof <strong>इं</strong> or <strong>उं</strong> with It; so that the combined sound in <strong>अइं</strong> and <strong>अउं</strong>. When thelangthened <strong>अ</strong> becomes <strong>आ</strong> it overpowers the final <strong>इ</strong> and this latter isdropped and we have <strong>मे करां</strong>Cit. or <strong>हांवकरां</strong> Goan., &lsquo;I do or used to do,just as in <strong>घोडउ</strong> a horse&rsquo; the penultimate is lengthened into <strong>आ</strong> and thefinal <strong>उ</strong> is dropped and we have <strong>घोडा</strong>.</p>

<p>Theso also are from the Pr forms. O. has lost nasal of the Ist.pers. pl. and B. of the sing. also, i. e., it has one same form forboth. O. has lost the <strong>स</strong> of the 2nd pers.sing. and has <strong>उ</strong> in itsplace.

<p>The Hindi 2nd and 3rd person sing. and pl. are derived directly from those in Ap. The <strong>ह</strong>of <strong>करहि-हु-हिं</strong> being dropped as ususl; the forms are <strong>करइ-द-इ-इं</strong> and, when the vowels are combined,we have <strong>करे-रो-रे-रें</strong>.</p>
<p>The G. P. and B forins are exactly slmilar, the only differenceconsisting in the nasal of the 3rd. pers. pl., which has been elidedin the first, as is done in the instrumental singular. The P. and</p>
<p>Ś.<strong>ण</strong>and <strong>नि</strong> must be referred to <strong>न्ति</strong> of the Pr. since the Ap. possessed the Pr. forms as well as the new ones. In old G. MSS, it isusual to write the and of these forms separately. The G. andH. first pers. sing. <strong>करुं</strong> is from the Ap. <strong>करउं</strong>, while the art of the P.<strong>करां</strong>and the S. <strong>हलां</strong>is to be traced rather to the f of the Pr., thanto this <strong>उं</strong> as that of the <strong>सां</strong> in the Cit. and Goan, by the elision of <strong>इ</strong>and the lengthening of the preceding vowel. There are instancesof this change given in the Pr. as we have seen. The S. <strong>उ</strong> of the1st pers. pl. is the same as that in M. and O. and is to be derivedfrom the Ap. <strong>हुं</strong> and the Pr. <strong>मु</strong>. The <strong>एं</strong> of the Hindi 1st per. pl. isbrought over from the 3rd person and this transference was facilitated by the nasal of the original termination; or, since in theAp. both <strong>मि</strong>and <strong>उं</strong> exist, when in a later stage of the language theletter was appropriated and fixed for the sing, the former wasadopted for the pl. and changed to <strong>इं</strong> which became by amalgamation. The G. and P. further dropped the nasal of this ए and interposed a vowel which is probably of the same nature as that in theS.<strong>मार्य्ं</strong>. The S. like the M. inserts <strong>इ</strong> before the terminations in thecase of transitive verbs, as in the forms of <strong>मार</strong> given above, anddoes not when the verbs are intransitive or reflexive as <strong>शिक</strong>and <strong>पढ</strong>.</p>
<p>The forms of the Ap. Present occur in the older Hindi poets. Thus in Tulsidas&rsquo;s Rāmāyaṇawe have :—</p>
<p>3rd per. sing.</p>
<p>शंभु गिरा पुनि मृषा न होई। शिव सर्वज्ञ जान सब कोई ।</p>
<p>Bāla-Kāṇḍa.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But Śambhu&rsquo;s word is not false.<br>
Everybody knows Śiva to be omniscient.&rsquo;</p>
<p>निशिचर एक सिंधु मह रहई। करि माया नभकै खग गहई ॥</p>
<p>Śundars-kāṇḍa.</p>
<p>&lsquo;An evil spirit dwells in the sea and having recourse to deceitcatches hold of the birds in the sky.&rsquo;</p>
<p>संत हंस गुण गहहिंपै परिहरिं वारि विकार ।</p>
<p>Bāla-kāṇḍa.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good men like swans admit merit like milk leaving off thewatery pollution.&rsquo;</p>
<p>नारद शिख जु सुनहिं नरनारी । अवश भवन तजि होंहिं भिखारी ॥</p>
<p>Bāla-K.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Those men and women that listen to the advice of Nāradabecome beggars having abandoned their homes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>2nd per. pL :</p>
<p>करहु कवन कारण तप भारी ।</p>
<p>Bāla-K.</p>
<p>&lsquo;For what reason do you go through excessive austerities ?&rsquo;</p>
<p>विपिन अकेली फिरहुकेहि हेतू ।</p>
<p>Bāla-K.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why do you wander alone in the forest ?&rsquo;</p>
<p>1st pers. sing. :</p>
<p>नारद वचन न मैंपरिहरऊं। बसौभवन उजरो नहिं डरऊं ॥</p>
<p>Bāla-K.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall not neglect the advice of Nārada and shall not beafraid even if thereby the world stands or falls (becomesdesolated).&rsquo;</p>
<p>1st pers. pl :</p>
<p>तात सुनहुसादर मन लाई। कहहुं रामकी कथा सुहाई ॥</p>
<p>Bāla-K.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear one, do hear with an attentive mind; [we] narrate theplessing story of Rāma.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Another reading is <strong>कहौं</strong> which is sing, and the sense is &lsquo;Inarrate.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The old 2nd pers. sing. in <strong>सि</strong> is met with thus:—</p>
<p>भरत सपथ तोहि सत्य कहुपरि हरि कपट दुराइ।<br>
हरप समय विस्मय करसि कारण मोहि सुनाइ॥</p>
<p>Ayo.-K.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I charge thee in the name of Bharata; tell me the truth laying aside all insincerity. On the occasion of joy thou art gloomy;explain to me the reason.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There are also specimens of the Ātm.:</p>
<p>देखें जहं तहं रघुपति ।</p>
<p>Bāla-K.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sees Raghupati here and there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>जो अब करौंसती सन प्रीती। मिटैभक्ति पथ होइ अंनीती ॥</p>
<p>Bāla-K.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If now you are amorous towards the Satī(Pārvatī), the wayof devotion will end and immorality (will) result.&rsquo;</p>
<p>चले बसह चढ़ि ।</p>
<p>Bāla-K.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He goes having sat on the bull.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And it appears that the <strong>ए</strong> of the Present is used after verbs ofthe same kind as in Marathi. The vowel <strong>इ</strong> of the 3rd pers. sing.does not become <strong>ए</strong> as in the modern Hindi and other languages,where the distinction between the two padas is lost, but retains.its original forms as in <strong>धरि पुछी</strong> ( <strong>गइ समीप महेश तब हांसे पूछी कुशलात</strong>&lsquo;when she went near, Maheśa smiling asked her how she fared&rsquo; ).</p>
<p><strong>THE IMPERATIVE</strong></p>
<p>The Marathi, Oriya, and the Bangali have preserved theImperative mood entire; the others, only the second person sing.,the rest being taken over from the old present or the modernPotential.</p>

<p>In the 1st per. sing. the <strong>मु</strong> of the Pr. is changed to <strong>उं</strong>M. i. e.<strong>म</strong> has lost its labial element as in the Present. O. and B. have.got the form of the Present for it, the nasal being dropped.The <strong>मो</strong>of the pl. is similarly changed to <strong>ओं</strong>and is also shortenedor resolved into <strong>ऊं</strong>. The B. has the same form as the sing. The2nd pers. sing. in M. has the form without the termination as inthe Pr., the other made up by adding <strong>ईं</strong> corresponds to that in theAp. ending in that vowel. Intransitive and reflexive roots have<strong>एं</strong> instead of <strong>इं</strong>, which form is also found in the Ap. a <strong>धावें, शिकें,सांगें.</strong></p>
<p>The O. and B. do not possess these terminations but the latterhas <strong>स्</strong> which is to be traced to the Pr. <strong>सु</strong>. The pl. is the same as inthe Pr. the having left its trace in the lengthening of the vowel.</p>
<p>The O. and B. <strong>कर</strong> is also really <strong>करा</strong> pronounced broadly <strong>करो</strong>andthe latter retains <strong>ह</strong> unchanged also. The 3rd pers. sing.termination <strong>उ</strong> of the Pr. is amalgamated with the precedingvowel into <strong>ओ</strong> in M. and <strong>उ</strong> in O. and B. M. has also sometimes <strong>उ</strong>for <strong>ओ</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>क</strong> of the B. is a later addition and is probably to betraced to the Interrogative pronoun beginning with <strong>क</strong>. It is tobe compared with such M. expressions as <strong>जाऊं दे किं</strong>.The O.preserves the 3rd per. pl. <strong>न्तु</strong> unchanged but in the optional formthe final <strong>उ</strong> is dropped. M. and B. have transferred thecharacteristic <strong>उ</strong> to the preceding syllable and the former hasdropped the nasal and the latter the <strong>त</strong>. In M. the <strong>उ</strong>is, as in thesing, changed to <strong>ओ</strong>, but in some cases it is preserved and wehave such forms as <strong>जाऊत, देऊत</strong>etc. We find instances in whichthe <strong>उ</strong> preserves its place after <strong>त</strong>as in the O. Thus in Jñäneśvar! :—</p>
<p><strong>हे वरी भलतें करितु । आतांचि एथें मारितुं।<br>
परी आपण मनेंघातु। नचिंतावा॥ I</strong>–225.</p>
<p>&lsquo;These on their part may do an unwelcome thing, just hereand now kill us but we should not think of doing injury.&rsquo;</p>
<p>H. P. and G. have <strong>कर</strong> for the sing. as in the above; and <strong>करो</strong>pl.the same as that of the Present, which itself is from the Ap. <strong>करहु</strong>,the characteristic Imper. <strong>उ</strong>being attached to the <strong>ह</strong> of the Pr.;and even in the Pr. and M. B. and O. the 2nd per. pl. is the same asin the Present. The P. has also the form in <strong>ई</strong>. The SindhiImperative 2nd per. sing. of intransitive and reflexive verbs endsin <strong>उ</strong> as <strong>हलु</strong> and of transitive verbs and a few others <strong>इ</strong> as <strong>करि</strong>.The <strong>उ</strong> occurs in the Ap. along with the <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>ए</strong> as already noticed.</p>
<p>Though Modern Hindi has lost the Imperative forms for otherpersons than the second, old Hindi poets use them; and for thesecond per. sing. also, they have the Ap. form in <strong>इ</strong> preserved inS. and M. Thus Tulsidas:—</p>
<p>The 2nd pers.sing.        <strong>प्रभु हनुमंतहि कहा बुझाई।</strong><br>
in इ               <strong>घरी बतुरूप अवध पुर जाइ॥</strong></p>
<p>&lsquo;The lord said to Hanumants, &ldquo;Assume the form of a boy andgo to the city of Ayodhyā.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>The 2nd pers. pl. is the same as that of Present which prevailsIn all the languages from the Pr. downwards.</p>
<p>पारवती पहंजाइ तुम प्रेमपरीक्षा हेतु ।</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having gone to Pārvatīexamine her devotion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The 3rd per. sing. ends in <strong>ओ</strong>or <strong>औ</strong>as in the M. and O.</p>
<p>मेरी भव बाधा हरी राधा नागरि सोइ।</p>
<p>—BehārĪlāla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May that polished Rädhä remove my worldly distress.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>करो अनुग्रह सोइ ।</strong> —Tuls. R.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May he confer favours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The 3rd pers. pl. has <strong>हु</strong> which is an Ap. form found in some ofHemacandra&rsquo;s quotations. The <strong>ह</strong> has been introduced simply todistinguish it from the sing.</p>
<p><strong>चरणकमल बंदौंसबकेरे। पुरवहु सकल मनोरथ मेरे ॥</strong> —Tuls. R.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I adore the lotus-like feet of all. May they fulfil all my desires.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The 1st per. sing. is the same as that of the Present and it indifficult to distinguish it; but in such a construction as thefollowing the M. would have the imperative:</p>
<p>चली सती शिव आपसुपाई। करहिं विचार करौका माई ॥</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Satl having got Śiva&rsquo;s permission went, and was thinking what deception to use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pl. also must be the same. Old G. has also the Imper.forms in <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong> as:—</p>
<p>पूछइबात पातशाह इसी। गुजरातिते कहीइकिसी ॥</p>
<p>&ldquo;The emperor asked this matter &ldquo;how is Gujarat ? &quot;</p>
<p>गुजरा स्यूं मांडिसिं कलहु ।माहारइ साथइ कटक मोकलु ॥</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will declare war against Gujarat, send an army with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The G. and S. have another form for the 2nd per. of the Imper.;the terminations of this are <strong>इजि</strong>S., <strong>जे</strong> G. for the sing.and <strong>इजो</strong>and <strong>जो</strong>for the pl. The H. has <strong>जे</strong> and <strong>जो</strong>for roots ending in <strong>ई</strong> and <strong>ऊ</strong>and <strong>इये</strong>and <strong>इयो</strong>for the rest. The P. and B. have <strong>इओ</strong>for the pl.and in the former the singular is confounded with the usual <strong>इ</strong>termination. In M. such form is not now ordinarily used. Inaddresses on letters, however, such expressions as <strong>प्रविष्ट कीजे, दीजे</strong>are used and these forms are found in the works of the oldMarathi poets. Thus in Jñāneśvarī:—</p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;परि यासी घात कीजे । मग आपण राज्यसुख भोगिजे ।<br>
हे स्वप्नींहिमन माझें । करूं न शके ॥</strong> I-213.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This my mind cannot think of doing even in a dream that Ishould kill them and enjoy afterwards the pleasures of sovereignty.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>तरिंअवधान येकलें दीजे । मग सर्व सुखासीं पात्र होईजे ॥</strong> IX - 1.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Give your attention alone and qualify yourself for allhappiness.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>मुनि सांगे नृपनाथ । जनमेजया॥<br>
जे अद्वितीय उत्तम । पवित्रैक निरुपम।<br>
परम मंगलघाम ।अवधारिजो ॥</strong> I-48,49.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Muni narrates this story to Janamejayathe king, saying(you should) attend to this which is unique, excellent, the holything, the unsurpassed and the highest abode of all auspiciousthings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>**आतां देइजो अवधान तुझी बोलावेला मी बोलेन ॥**I-8.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Give attention now; I will speak what you make me speak.&rsquo;</p>
<p>These forms have been traced by Dr. Trump in his SindhiGrammar to the Pr. base in <strong>इज्ज</strong>used in the Present, Imperativeand Future, and derived by Lassen from the present, and by mefrom the Potential; and so far as the form in the S. and G. isconcerned there is used no objection. But these forms are used inthe vernaculars when respect for the person spoken to isintended and the Potential as distinguished from the Imperativeis by no means more respectful in Skr. The H. forms are notassigned each to each number, but both of them are used in thesing, or pl. and its <strong>य</strong> can by no means be derived from <strong>ज</strong>; for,though the contrary process, namely, the changing of <strong>य</strong> to <strong>ज</strong>,iscommon, there is, so far as I am aware, no single well-establishedinstance of the other.</p>
<p>In Skr. nothing is more usual than to use the Passive of the3rd pors. sing. Imperative in respectful solicitation. The secondpers. of the active Imper. is the least respectful, since there is adirect reference in that voice to the agent, and such a referenceto great men is regarded as improper, or in the case of others,not courteous. The 3rd pers, with <strong>भवान्</strong> as the nom. is more so,because the reference is indirect; but the most respectful construction is the Passive as it does not point to the agent at all, butto the thing done by him. Thus the <strong>ज</strong> in these forms is from the<strong>य</strong> of the passive and the Hindi <strong>ईय</strong>from <strong>ईअ</strong>, which is the othercorruption of that termination in the Pr.</p>
<p>The M. <strong>देइजो</strong>corresponds to Skr. <strong>दीयताम्</strong>, the Imper. 3rd pers.sing. termination in that language being <strong>उ</strong>. <strong>दीजे</strong>corresponds to<strong>दीयते</strong> of the Present and the Potential sense may be attributed tothe fact that the whole tense has assumed that sense in thevernaculars The agent may, if the forms are passive, be anyperson and any number since it does not agree with the verb;and this explains the Hindi usage. But generally in solicitationthe person addressed is the second person, though he is referredto indirectly, and he is, when cases are used, put in the instr.as in the Jñāneśvarī:—</p>
<p>द्रोणातें म्हणे पाहिजे तुम्हींसफल ।</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said to Droṇa everything should be looked after by you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These forms become in the G. and S. identified with the secondperson, easily because one of the terminations <strong>ओ</strong>happens to bethe same as that of the Imper. 2nd pers. pl. in those languages;and it got confused with the other Pr. Potential forms in <strong>ज्ज</strong>;wherefore we find in the S. the Imper. 2nd pers. sing. terminations <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong> applied to the base as <strong>थिजि</strong>&lsquo;become&rsquo;, <strong>सुनिजु</strong>&lsquo;hear.&lsquo;This confusion extended to the Hindi also since to roots in <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>उ</strong>it appends <strong>जे</strong> and <strong>जो</strong>; at for the Potential increment <strong>ज</strong> is given inthe Pr. to roots ending in <strong>आ, इ, ओ</strong> etc., i. e. any vowel except <strong>अ</strong>.In the progress of a language confusion is natural and frequentlyobservable.This double etymology explains all the facts ofthe case; while, if we confine ourselves to one, some are notaccounted for.</p>
<p>We have seen that there are two classes of verbs in M. one ofwhich takes the augment <strong>इ</strong> in the Present before the consonantalterminations as <strong>करीस, करीत</strong> and the other takes <strong>ए</strong> or <strong>अ</strong> as<strong>धावें धावत</strong>.The Imper. 2nd pers. sing. of the former is made up by adding <strong>इ</strong>in old or poetic Marathi and of the latter by adding ए. Theformer takes इ in the Future necessarily in the 1st and 3rd pers.sing as <strong>करील, करीन</strong> and optionally in some others as <strong>करतील</strong> or <strong>करितील,करशील</strong> or <strong>करिशील</strong>. This option is extended even to to the Present<strong>करितो</strong> or <strong>करतो</strong> and the past participle <strong>धरिलें</strong> or <strong>धरलें</strong>; while in the</p>
<p>present participle these verbs necessarily take <strong>इ</strong> as <strong>करित आहें</strong>.The latter class takes <strong>ए</strong> in the Future 1st and 3rd pers. sing. andthe option in the last is not allowed, <strong>अ</strong>being added in all, including the present part as <strong>शिकेल, शिकतील</strong> not <strong>शिकितील, शिकला</strong> not<strong>शिकिला, शिकतो</strong> and <strong>शिकत आहे</strong>; so that this olass must have <strong>ए</strong> insome cases and <strong>अ</strong> in the rest.</p>
<p>The Sindhi has a similar distinction. Those roots that take <strong>इ</strong>before the termination of the Pres. as <strong>कर्याथो</strong> &ldquo;I do&rdquo; from theirImper. 2nd pers. sing. in <strong>इ</strong> and insert this in the present part. as<strong>करीन्दो</strong>; while the rest do not add this <strong>इ</strong> as <strong>हलां</strong>1st per. sing., <strong>हलन्दो</strong>pres, part, and take <strong>उ</strong> in the Imper, sing., <strong>हलु</strong> Imper. 2nd pers. sing. We thus see that we have <strong>इ</strong> in the one case and opposed to it arethe vowels <strong>ए, अ</strong>and <strong>उ</strong> in the other. The former is a characteristicof the transitive or the non-reflexive nature of a root while thelatter is that of the opposite.</p>
<p>Why should it be so? The vowels <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>ए</strong> form the distinctivemarks of the Parasm. and Ātm. in Skr. and Pr. A consciousnessof this and of the difference between Parasm, roots and Ätm.roots has been preserved in the modern S. and M. and hencethere is an attempt to insert those vowels in all possible cases;and the base itself of the roots is made to end in them. But inthe Prakrits and to a great extent even in Skr. the base of most ofthe roots (<strong>भण, हस</strong> etc.) has an imperative signification. Hencethe newly constituted base <strong>करीं</strong> and <strong>धावें</strong> also come to have animper. sense. Now these are the forms of the Imper, not only inour language but the old Apabhramia also; hence the process Imention must have been gone through even then. This is abetter explanation of the Ap. forms than deriving them bothfrom <strong>हि</strong>, especially since this is a dialect so prone to bring in <strong>ह</strong>even when it cannot be had that it is not likely to reject analready existing one.</p>
<p>You will thus see how subtle the operation of the law ofanalogy is in the development of a language.</p>
<p>Now as regards the Ap. form <strong>उ</strong>, we see that we have it inSindhi where the other languages have <strong>अ</strong>, so that it is the oldinorganic <strong>उ</strong>which prevails so much in the Ap. And we have</p>
<p>seen that <strong>ई</strong> is used in many more grammatical forms in M. than<strong>ए</strong>, whilst, instead of it, in other places and in the Sindhi in allbut the Imper. 2nd pers. sing. we have <strong>अ</strong>; so that <strong>इ</strong> is made thedistinctive mark of the Parasm. character of a root while itsabsence or the insertion of <strong>ए</strong> indicates the Ātm. character.</p>
<p><strong>THE FUTURE</strong></p>
<p>The third Skr. tense preserved by the Prakrits is the SecondFuture. It has descended to the Gujarati. Thus:—</p>

          <td>करसे</td>
          <td>तेओ करसे</td>
      </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>The <strong>स</strong> of these forms is the old Skr. <strong>स्य</strong>corrupted to <strong>स्स</strong> in the Śaur.and <strong>स</strong> in the Ap. From the Skr. downwards the terminations of the Present in each of the languages are appended, as formerly observed, to this tense. So in G. we find in the 2nd and 3rd pers. the terminations <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong> of the G. Present attached to <strong>स</strong>. But the consciousness of the etymology of these forms has been partially lost;wherefore in 1st pers. we have not <strong>करसुं</strong> for the sing. corresponding to <strong>करूं</strong>, and <strong>करसीये</strong>corresponding to <strong>करूं</strong>,But G. has derived its 1st. pers. pl. <strong>करसुं</strong>directly from the Skr. or Ap. pl. <strong>करिस्समु</strong> or <strong>करिसमु</strong>, and the sing. <strong>करीस</strong> from <strong>करिस्सं</strong>, which, you will remember, was an optional Saur. form in addition to <strong>करिस्सामि</strong>, the nasal being dropped according to the usual Guj. rule.</p>
<p>We have these forms in the Braj-Bhäṣäbut the <strong>स</strong> is corrupted<br>
to <strong>ह</strong>as it very often is. Thus:—</p>

<p>Here in the 1st pers. sing. we have the <strong>औं</strong>of the Pres. Braj asin <strong>करौं</strong>, unlike the G. and in conformity with the ancient practice.You will also observe that the old augment <strong>इ</strong> is preserved. Itmay be suspected that these forms are derived from those in thePr. which have <strong>ह</strong> instead of <strong>स</strong>, but you will have observed thatthere we have <strong>हि</strong> as in <strong>करिहिइ</strong> and here <strong>ह</strong> which represents theŚaur, and Apbhr. <strong>स</strong>.The old Future occurs in Tulsidāsa&rsquo;sRāmāyaṇa.</p>
<p>3rd per. sing. <strong>प्रिया सोच परिहर सब तुमिरह श्री भगवान्।<br>
पारवती जिन निर्मयउसोइ करिहहिं कल्पान॥</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, leave off all anxiety, remember the great God. He whocreated Pārvatī will do her good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the dot on हि is a mistake this is 3rd pers. sing.,</p>
<p>3rd pers. pl. <strong>छमिहहिं सज्जन मोरि ढिटाई।<br>
सुनिहहिंबालवचन मन लाई॥</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Good men will pardon my temerity and hear the words ofthis) child with attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2nd pers. pl.<strong>कहत मम मन अतिसंकुचाई । हंसिहहु सुनिहमारि जडताई ॥</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;I am ashamed in my mind to tell the truth; for, hearing, atmy stupidity you will laugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In these forms the terminations of the Apbhr. Present areappended to the <strong>ह</strong> derived from <strong>स</strong>; but the following are threeinstances of the Braj form occurring in the same work.</p>
<p>1st pers. pl.<strong>तब तब बदन पैठिहौंआई ॥ सत्य कहौंमोहि जान दे माई ॥</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I will enter thy mouth: I tell you the truth, let me go,muther. &quot;</p>
<p>3rd pers. pl. <strong>मम कृत सेतु जो दरशन करिहैं। सो विनुश्रम भवसागर तरिहैं॥</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;They who will visit this bridge constructed by me willcross the ocean of life without trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In an essay published in the Bengal Asiatic Society&rsquo;s Journal,1873, Mr. Beames gives the forms of the Future found in theearliest Hindi poet Cand, which are exactly similar to those inthe Braj, and misled by the latter parts <strong>है, है, हो</strong>etc., which resemblethose of <strong>अस</strong> or <strong>आस</strong> so greatly, traces them to the PeriphrasticFuture of the Skr. <strong>चलितास्मि-सि</strong>etc. But this future is in the firstplace rarely used in Skr. and altogether discarded by the Paliand not a trace of it is to be found in any of the numerousPrakrits. Besides if we derive these forms from the PeriphrasticFuture, we must have in the 3rd pers. such forms as <strong>चलिआ-चलिया</strong>and <strong>चलिआर</strong>. And the old forms which Tulsidas uses of the typeof <strong>चलिहहि</strong>, from which evidently the others are derived, willremain unexplained. There can be little doubt that this derivation is wrong. We have seen the several steps by which wegradually rise to <strong>चलिहै</strong> from <strong>चलिष्यति</strong> and the chain is so wellconnected that this etymology must be admitted as correct.The resemblance to that form in Gujarati also must not beforgotten.</p>
<p><strong>THE PAST TENSE</strong></p>
<p>Past time is, in all the vernaculars, expressed by means ofthe past participle as in the Pr., all the Skr. past tenses being lost,as you will remember, except in isolated cases. This participleis in the older languages passive in the case of transitive verbsgenerally and active when the verb is intransitive and also inthe cases of some transitive verbs such as <strong>शिकलों, प्यालों</strong>etc.This rule is strictly observed in most of the modern dialects andhence in the past tense we have generally no active voice whenthe verb is transitive and the agent is, as in the older languages,put in the instr. thus in H. <strong>लेखकनें पोथी लिखी</strong>, P. <strong>उसने कम कीता</strong>,S. <strong>हुन फकीरखे धनुडिणो</strong>G. <strong>जबेरीलाले मारीपासे माणस मोकल्यो</strong>, M. <strong>पारध्यानेंबाध मारिला</strong>. In all these sentences the last words are past participles and they agree with the object in the Nom. case in number,gender and person. In the O. and B., however, all distinctionbetween gender, number and person being lost, the agreementwith the object is not perceptible. In these languages, and tosome extent in Marathi, this participle is made the base of theregular verbal forms; wherefore I shall have to discuss thispoint again.</p>
<p><strong>THE PAST PARTICIPLE</strong></p>
<p>The Hindi participle ends in <strong>अ</strong> which of course is the sametermination as in Pr., thus Skr. <strong>गत</strong>, Pr. <strong>गअ</strong>, the consonant beingelided, and with the connecting <strong>य्, गय</strong>. When augmented by theaddition of <strong>क</strong> in the manner I have shown in the last lecture andalso in this it is <strong>गया</strong>, the अalone of the <strong>क</strong> being left. In thefeminine the augmented form is <strong>गयी</strong> and where this <strong>य</strong> is notinserted it is <strong>गई</strong>. By adding this augmented form to any rootwhatever the Hindi past participle is formed as <strong>लिखा, पढा</strong> etc.An euphonic <strong>य</strong>intervenes when the root ends in a vowel as <strong>दिया,पीया</strong> etc. Similar to this is the B. and O. past participle as <strong>देखा</strong>in <strong>देखाजाव</strong>B, <strong>लेखा, दिया</strong> O. The S. terminstion is <strong>इओ</strong> and the P.</p>
<p><strong>इआ</strong> As <strong>आगिओ</strong> from <strong>जागणु</strong> &rsquo;to be awake,&rsquo; <strong>पर्खिओ</strong>from <strong>पर्खणु</strong> &rsquo;to remain,&rsquo;<strong>गइआ</strong> &lsquo;gone&rsquo;, <strong>घलिआ</strong> &lsquo;sent;&rsquo; the nom. termination <strong>उ</strong> and the augment<strong>अ</strong> for <strong>क</strong> heing left out of consideration it is reduced to <strong>इअ</strong>. TheG. hss <strong>यो</strong> and the Braj. <strong>यौ</strong>as in <strong>राख्यो, राख्यौ</strong> &lsquo;kept&rsquo; from <strong>राख,कह्यो, कह्यौ</strong>&rsquo;told&rsquo; from <strong>कह</strong>, where also the <strong>ओ</strong> being dropped the termination is i. e. g <strong>इअ</strong> hastily pronounced. These languages therefore preserve the old termination with augment prefixed to itas in the Pr, as <strong>हसिओ, परिओ</strong> etc. Some of the vernsculars andnotably the Sindhi have also inherited from the Pr. readymadeTadbhava forms of the past passive participles as:—</p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>The Sindhi seems to have made up the forms of a few rootson the analogy of these though they do not exist in the Pr. as<strong>झल्तो</strong> from <strong>झल</strong>, Skr. <strong>धृत</strong>, Pr. <strong>धरिओ</strong>; <strong>पीतो</strong> drunk, <strong>कीतो</strong> done; ( P. hasthis also ); but some of these may be modern Tadbhavas.</p>
<p>Marathi does not possess this form and past tense is expressedin that language by a form ending in <strong>ला-ली-लें</strong>. This is adjectivalin nature and passive in the case of transitive verbs and activein that of intransitive or reflexive verbs. It is in every respectthen like the Skr. and Pr. past participle preserved in the otherdislects. But here we have <strong>ल</strong> (<strong>ला</strong>) for the <strong>अ</strong> (<strong>आ</strong>) of those,</p>
<p>This <strong>ल</strong> has been traced to the Skr. <strong>त</strong>; but since in the Mahārāṣṭrīor principal Prakrit that termination leaves its <strong>अ</strong> only,it must be derived from the Śaur.<strong>द</strong> which often becomes <strong>ड</strong>, and<strong>ड</strong> is frequently confounded with <strong>र</strong> and <strong>ल</strong> as we have seen.In Sindhi Skr. <strong>द</strong> is always <strong>ड</strong> as <strong>डे</strong>&lsquo;give&rsquo; from <strong>दा, डुधो</strong>from <strong>दुग्ध</strong>and <strong>डिठो</strong>etc. Similarly even in the Prakrit period, such a changemust have taken place in several words; for instance, the Skr.<strong>दश</strong> in <strong>एकादश</strong> and in some of the succeeding numerals, becomesin the Pali <strong>दस</strong>, but is changed to <strong>रह</strong> in the Pr., which shows that<strong>द</strong> must have become <strong>ड</strong> before it aesumed the form of <strong>र</strong>. <strong>ड</strong> is interchanged with <strong>ल</strong> even in Skr. as <strong>पुरोडाश</strong> or <strong>पुरोलाश</strong>; and in the Pr.and modern dialects we have <strong>कील</strong> for <strong>क्रीड, पील</strong> or <strong>पील</strong> for Skr. <strong>पीड,डालिम</strong> for <strong>दाडिम</strong>etc. So that this etymology is possible; but I shall presently show to you that it is not to the Śaur. that weshould first look for the origin of M. words and forms; especiallyin cases when it stands alone. That the Marathi only shouldexhibit these consonantal changes in the past participle andnone of the other sister dialects and that no instance of theintermediate step between the Śaur. <strong>द</strong> and the M. <strong>ल</strong> should befound here or elsewhere as we find them in similar cases, goesa great way against this derivation.</p>
<p>The Marathi past participle in <strong>ला, ली, लें</strong>is, I think, of thesame nature as similar participles in other cognate languagesending in that termination. We have in G. besides <strong>कह्यो, कर्यो, कह्येलो</strong>and <strong>करेलो</strong> and in s. besides <strong>बिओ</strong> and <strong>दिठो, बिअलु</strong> and <strong>दिठलु</strong>.There is a little difference in the sense, but both are promiscuously used in ordinary usage. B. and O. form their Preteritewith this participle as the base as <strong>गोपाल आमाके कहिल</strong>B. &lsquo;Gopaltold us&rsquo;;<strong>अम्मे कलम देह लेखिल</strong> O. &lsquo;I wrote with a pen.&rsquo; It is alsoused as an adjective as <strong>गलादिन</strong>the past day,&rsquo; <strong>पडिला गछ</strong>&rsquo;the fallentree.&lsquo;Though it does not occur in high Hindi and is notgiven in the grammars of the languages, the lower classes ofthe Hindi population use this participle very commonly as<strong>वेचल</strong> H. &lsquo;sold,&rsquo; <strong>गयल</strong>&lsquo;gone&rsquo;; and it is also found in the works ofKabīra, though I have not seen it in Tulsīdāsa&rsquo;s Rāmāyaṇa, whichis accounted for by the fact that Kabīra was a Sūdra himselfand consequently belonged to those classes which use it at thepresent day. Thus:—</p>
<p>तब बह्मा पूछल महतारी को तोर पुरुष का करितुम नारी ॥</p>
<p>—Rāmāyaṇa II-4.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Brahmāasked his mother: &lsquo;Who is thy husband andwhose wife art thou !&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>चहुजुग भगतन बांधल बाटी । समुझि न परैमोटरी फाटी ॥</p>
<p>—Rāmāyaṇa V-7.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In all the four ages holy men constructed ways but theydid not know that the bundle they had tied had given way orwas torn!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now in the Sindhi participles <strong>ल</strong> is a termination appendedto other or old participles; as <strong>विअ</strong> and <strong>दिठ</strong> with the suffix <strong>ल</strong>become <strong>विअल</strong> and <strong>दिठल</strong>. The Gujarati ones are of the samenature; in <strong>कहेलो, लो</strong> is the suffix and <strong>कहे</strong> is the original participlein <strong>इअ</strong> or <strong>य</strong> or <strong>कहिअ</strong> or <strong>कह्य</strong>which is changed to <strong>ए</strong>, as <strong>य</strong> often is.Even in Marathi in the forms <strong>गेला, केला, आला, आयलो</strong> in the minordialects, <strong>जाहला, मेला, भ्याला, प्पाला</strong> etc., <strong>गे</strong>represents <strong>गय</strong> (Pr. <strong>गअ</strong>,Skr. <strong>गत</strong> ); <strong>के, क</strong>य ( Pr. <strong>कअ</strong>, Skr <strong>कृत</strong>); <strong>आय ,आअ</strong>(Pr. <strong>आअअ</strong>, Skr. <strong>आगत</strong>);<strong>जाह, जाअ</strong>(Pr. <strong>जाअ</strong>, skr. <strong>जात</strong>) <strong>मेमय</strong> ( Pr. <strong>मृत</strong>) <strong>भ्या-भीआ, प्या-पीआ</strong>and so on. In the B. too we have <strong>केल, गेल, आइल</strong> which are justlike the Marathi forms and are to be explained in the same way.In old Marathi we similarly find this <strong>ल</strong> appended to real pastparticiples. In an old Inscription dated Śaka 1128 = 1206 A. D.,the latter portion of which is in the Marathi of the time and being so was difficult to decipher, there occurs the expression<strong>मढा दिन्हला</strong>&lsquo;given to a monastery&rsquo; in which we see that <strong>ला</strong> isappended to <strong>दिन्ह</strong>which is the same as the old Pali and Pr. participle <strong>दिण्ण</strong>of the root <strong>दा</strong>.</p>
<p>In Skr. a great many roots formed their participles by adding<strong>न</strong> instead of <strong>त</strong>and we find several of these and others formedon the analogy of these in old Hindi and Marathi poetry. Inthe works of Tulsīdāsa, Kabīra, Canda and others <strong>कीन्ह</strong>&lsquo;done&rsquo;<strong>लन्हि</strong>&rsquo;taken,&rsquo; &rsquo; &lsquo;known,&rsquo; <strong>दीन्ह</strong> &lsquo;given&rsquo; and such others occur :—</p>
<p>नाना विधि मुनि पूजा कीन्ही । अस्तुति करि पुनि आशिष दीन्ही ॥</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sage worshipped him in several ways, praised him andgave him a blessing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Marathi poets we have added to <strong>न</strong> as Jñāneśvarī.</p>
<p>ते दीनी शब्द अचाट । मिनले एकवट ।</p>
<p>&lsquo;Both these dreadful noises mingled together.&rsquo;</p>
<p>सनकादिकांचिया आशा । वाहीनल्पाबहुबसा ।</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hopes of Sanaka and others increased greatly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ekanātha.</p>
<p>धर्माप्रति घाविम्नला ।</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ran towards Dharma or virtue.&rsquo;</p>
<p>ऐकोनि हासिम्नला गोविंद ।</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hearing this, Govinda smiled&rsquo;.</p>
<p>RukmiṇīSvayaṃvara.</p>
<p>In the following <strong>ला</strong>is applied to old Tadbhava participles:—</p>
<p>में भ्रांति सेजे सुतला । ते स्वप्नसुखभुतला। मग तो ज्ञानोदयीं चेइला। म्हणोनिया ॥</p>
<p>Jñān. V-47.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because when he slept on the bed of delusion he enjoyed thepleasures of a dream and then awoke when the sun of knowledgerose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>भीतरीं पातला उठा उठीं। जेथ जगजेठी श्रीकृष्ण ॥</p>
<p>&lsquo;Went in where the lord of the world Śri Kṛṣṇa was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here <strong>सुत भुत</strong> and <strong>पात</strong>, are from <strong>सुत्त,भुत्त</strong> and <strong>पत्त</strong> Pr. <strong>सुप्त, भुक्त</strong> snd <strong>प्राप्त</strong>Skr.; and to these <strong>ला</strong>, is added. There are other instances in theseworks in which <strong>ला</strong>is added to past Tatsams or later TadbhavaParticiples such as द<strong>ग्धला, लुब्धला, हाणितला, म्हणितला</strong>; and in theInnguage of the day we have <strong>सांगितले, घेतलें मागितलें धुतलें</strong> and oneor two others. In the Jñaneśvarīwe have also such forms as <strong>बिसणैला</strong>&rsquo;excited&rsquo;, <strong>निदैला</strong>&lsquo;slept&rsquo;, and <strong>आभारैला</strong> where the <strong>ऐ</strong> represents the<strong>अय</strong> or <strong>इअ</strong> of the old participle resembling in this respect the Guj<strong>फहेलो</strong>.</p>
<p>When the <strong>अ</strong> or <strong>आ</strong>of the old participle became too weak to beexpressive, this form with the suffix <strong>ल</strong> attached was oftener usedand gradually supplanted the other; and <strong>ल</strong> came in the course oftime to be regarded as the past participle termination. Hence itis applied to roots directly without the intervention of the old <strong>ए</strong>that we have in <strong>केला</strong> and <strong>गेला</strong>; and in low Hindi also, it is appliedin the same way. The original participle was mostly used</p>
<p>predicatively as it it is in classical Skr. also, and this <strong>ल</strong> wasattached to it to form an attributive expression to be used beforenouns. But after time this new form also came to bepredicatively used; and it is now so used in M., G., S. and H.In M. however, when it was put to this purpose, it drove out theold one, and its own attributive sense became faint, though evennow it is not entirely lost in such instances as <strong>झाल्या गोष्टीसउपाय नाहीं</strong>&rsquo;there is no remedy against the thing that has alreadytaken place.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then another <strong>ल</strong> came to be attached to it to adapt it forattributive use, and thus we have now in M. the form <strong>केतेला, गेलेला</strong>etc. with a double <strong>ल</strong>. This <strong>ल</strong> is to be traced to the Pr. <strong>इल्ल</strong>or <strong>उल्ल</strong>which according to Hemacandra is applied in the sense of Bhāvai.e. being the thing signified by the base as <strong>उवदिल्लं, अप्पुल्लं</strong>. These twowords aro in M. <strong>वरील</strong> or <strong>वरला</strong> and <strong>आपुलें</strong> or <strong>आपलें</strong>, in which instanceswe see that the initial <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>उ</strong> of the suffix is optionally dropped.Or according to other writers, quoted by our grammarians, <strong>आल</strong>is also used. And in works such as the Gauḍavadha and in theBhagavatīwe find these suffixes frequently used. These aregenerally applied to all bases; but <strong>ल</strong> is another terminationwhich is restricted to certain nouns such as <strong>विद्युत्, पीत, पत्र, अन्ध</strong>,from which we have <strong>विज्जल, पीतल</strong> etc. In Skr. also this suffix hasn pretty wide range as <strong>चूडाल</strong> Pāṇini V. 2 96 <strong>सिध्मल, कृष्णल, पांसुल,मांसल, स्नेहल</strong> etc, V. 3. 97 <strong>वत्सल</strong> V. 2.98; <strong>फैनल</strong> V. 2-99.</p>
<p><strong>THE PRESENT PARTICIPLE IN THE VERNACULARS</strong></p>
<p>The present participle of the Pr. has lost its <strong>न</strong> M. as <strong>करित,
धावत</strong>, in G. <strong>करत</strong>&lsquo;doing&rsquo;, <strong>चढत</strong> &lsquo;ascending&rsquo;, in H. as <strong>करता</strong> and in B.as <strong>करित, देखित</strong>,while the O. has preserved it as <strong>करन्त, देखन्त</strong>. The S.and P. have preserved the Śaur. form which has <strong>द</strong> instead of <strong>त</strong>and the former has preserved the nasal throughout while theIntter has dropped it after roots in <strong>अ</strong> as S. <strong>मारींदो, हलन्दो,</strong> P. <strong>लिखदा</strong>&lsquo;writing&rdquo; but <strong>जांदा</strong>&lsquo;going&rsquo;, <strong>होंदा</strong>&lsquo;becoming,&rsquo; this participle is used,as in the Pr., in the sense of Skr. Conditional, equivalent to theEnglish Pluperfect Conditional, as M. <strong>तो करता तर होतें</strong>&lsquo;if he haddone it, it would have become, G. <strong>ते करत तो थात</strong>; B. <strong>से यदि तो माकेकहित तबे तुमि विश्वास करिता ना</strong>; if he had told you, you would nothave believed;&rsquo; O.<strong>जेवेसूर्य उदय हुअन्त ते अन्धकार न रहन्ता</strong> &lsquo;if the sun</p>
<p>had arisen, the darkness would not have remained&rsquo;; H. <strong>जो मैं कहता तो मेरी बात न सुनता</strong>&lsquo;if I had told, he would not have listened to mywords;&rsquo; S. <strong>जेहू पाणिअमे न तरंदो</strong>&lsquo;if he had not been swimming&rsquo;, <strong>जे मै घल्लदा</strong> &lsquo;if I were to send.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>THE ABSOLUTIVE IN THE VERNACULARS</strong></p>
<p>The absolutive in M. is formed by adding the termination <strong>ऊन</strong>, as <strong>करून</strong>, the same as the Mahārāṣṭrī<strong>ऊण</strong>. Vararuci, you willremember, gives this termination only, but Hemacandra adds more.</p>
<p>The G. has <strong>इ</strong>, the same as the Ap. <strong>इ</strong> and Pr. <strong>इअ</strong>, Skr. <strong>य</strong>, and <strong>इने</strong>from the Ap. <strong>एप्पिणु</strong> or <strong>एप्पी</strong>, the Vedic Skr. <strong>त्वीन</strong>; or the <strong>ने</strong> of <strong>इने</strong> maybe the same as the particle <strong>ने</strong>which means &lsquo;and&rsquo; added to <strong>इ</strong>.</p>
<p>The Sindhi has <strong>इ</strong> for intransitive and reflexive roots and <strong>ए</strong> fortransitive and another <strong>इओ</strong>or <strong>यो</strong> for both, as <strong>सुणी</strong>&lsquo;having heard&rsquo;,<strong>मारे</strong> having beaten&rsquo; and <strong>सुण्यो</strong>or <strong>मायों</strong>. The first is the same asthe G., but in the <strong>ए</strong>of the transitive roots the <strong>अ</strong>of the original<strong>इअ</strong> seems to be preserved and this termination added to the rootwith the Parasm. sign <strong>इ</strong>. Thus we have first <strong>मारी</strong>and then, <strong>इअ</strong> or <strong>इय</strong>being added, we have <strong>मारीय</strong>, whereupon the <strong>य</strong> with thepreceding <strong>इ</strong> becomes <strong>ए</strong> and we have <strong>मारे</strong>. The last <strong>यो</strong> is the sameas the <strong>इउ</strong> of the Ap., traced to the infinitive, which, you willremember, is confounded with the absolutive.</p>
<p>The H. drops the <strong>इ</strong> of this form and the original root, as <strong>बोल,जा</strong> etc., is used in the sense of the Absol., but to make the sensedistinct <strong>के</strong> or <strong>कर</strong> is added, as<strong>बोलके</strong> or <strong>बोलकर, जाके</strong> or <strong>जाकर</strong>. Ofthese <strong>के</strong> is a real absolutive derived from the Śaur. <strong>किअ</strong>and <strong>कर</strong>is the same as <strong>बोल</strong>, i. e. the usual form of it. Now when one formis felt to be not distinct enough, it is usual in our languages toadd another to it of the same nature. You have instances ofthisprocess in the Pali double genitive <strong>तेसानं</strong>, and in the instr.<strong>नें</strong> and <strong>नीं</strong>of some of our vernaculars.</p>
<p>P. agrees with the H. In H., however, the <strong>इ</strong> is pronounced bya great many people. It is also found in the old posts and in theBrajabhāṣā. The absolutive always ends in this vowel as <strong>करि,मारि</strong>, though often <strong>कै</strong> the same as H.<strong>के</strong> is added, as <strong>करिकै, मारिकै</strong>, etc.</p>
<p>The O. also has <strong>इ</strong> as <strong>करि</strong>and the B. has <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>ए</strong> or <strong>इया</strong> as <strong>देखि,देखे</strong> or <strong>देखिया</strong> &lsquo;having seen&rsquo;. In the last the <strong>अ</strong> of the original <strong>इअ</strong>is preserved and longthened, and the <strong>य</strong> is ouphonic.</p>
<p><strong>THE INFINITIVE OF PURPOSE IN THE VERNACULARS</strong></p>
<p>The infinitive of purpose is preserved in M. as <strong>तो अभ्यास करूं लागला</strong> &lsquo;he began to study.&rsquo; The form in the Pr. is <strong>करिउं</strong>, but theaugment <strong>इ</strong> is lost in M. O. also has it, but its use is somewhatlike that of the Absolutive <strong>विचार करु कहिले</strong> &lsquo;considering he spoke,&rsquo; <strong>खाउ खाउ तृप्त होइला</strong> &rsquo;eating and eating he was satisfied.&rsquo; But theoriginal sense is somewhat preserved, and it is in this sensemade the basis of the present tense definite, which will be considered hereafter. This infinitive and the absolutive are, I havealready observed, confused in the Pr., and in some of the moderndialects the absolutive is used where we in Marathi use theinfinitive: as G. <strong>हुं करी सकुं छुं</strong>&lsquo;I am able to do it,&rsquo; H. <strong>मै कर सकता हुं, बानी जाको नहीं कहि सके है</strong> &lsquo;whom speech cannot express,&rsquo; Br. <strong>मै करि सकौं होंfor</strong> M. <strong>मीक करूं शकतों</strong>. For this infinitive the modernvernaculars however have got a reconstructed form which willbe mentioned in its proper place.</p>
<p><strong>THE POTENTIAL PARTICIPLE IN THE VERNACULARS</strong></p>
<p>The potential participle in Skr. <strong>तव्य,</strong> Pr. <strong>अव्व</strong>, is much used inthe modern dialects and made the base of various verbal formations. In M. we have <strong>करावें</strong> &lsquo;should be done,&rsquo; G. <strong>करदुं</strong>. S. <strong>पसिबो</strong>from <strong>पस</strong>to see, Braj <strong>करवौं</strong>, B. &amp; O. <strong>करिबा</strong>. The H. has lost it, soalso the P.</p>
<p>The Skr. verbal noun in <strong>अन</strong>appears as <strong>करणें</strong>in M., <strong>करणु</strong> S., <strong>करनौ</strong>Braj., <strong>करना</strong> H. and P., <strong>कहन</strong>O. &amp; B., but in these latter it isprobably a modern Tatsama. G. does not possess it. Theseforms are called infinitives by the Vernacular grammarians.Prof. Hornle traces them to the Skr. potential participle in <strong>अनीय</strong>;but, as before remarked, the transition from <strong>नीयं</strong>to <strong>नयं</strong> and thento <strong>नें</strong> is taken for granted; regularly <strong>नीय</strong> ought in the vernacularsto be changed to <strong>नी</strong>as in <strong>पाणी</strong>. According to the observations Imade before the <strong>एं</strong> of <strong>करणें</strong> and <strong>औं</strong> of <strong>करनौं</strong> must be due to <strong>अकम्-अअं-</strong></p>
<p><strong>अयं</strong> Pr. and <strong>अकम्-अउं</strong>Ap., as in M. <strong>केलें</strong>and G. <strong>केलुं</strong>; so that the verbalnoun in M. and H. is an augmented form of the correspondingone in Skr., while that of the Sindhi is from the unaugmentedform. A great many other verbal derivatives have come downto the vernaculars, but I must not go further.</p>
<p><strong>THE PASSIVE IN THE VERNACULARS</strong></p>
<p>The Pr. passive base in <strong>ईअ</strong>and <strong>इज्ज</strong> has been preserved onlyin P. &amp; S. Thus <strong>मारीअ</strong> &lsquo;he may be beaten&rsquo; and <strong>मारीअन</strong> &rsquo;theymay&rsquo; be beaten&rsquo; are forms of the 3rd pers. sing. and pl. of thepassive old Pres, and modern Potential; while <strong>मारीदा</strong>the presentpart. is used as a base to form various tenses. This is the Pr.form in <strong>इअ</strong> the <strong>अ</strong> being lost. Sindhi has <strong>ज</strong> as <strong>पजिणु</strong> &rsquo;to be drunk,&rsquo;<strong>घोइजणु</strong> &rsquo;to be washed,&rsquo; व sing, <strong>धोइजनि</strong> pl 3rd pers. Pres or Pot.The pres part is wanting the potential porticiple from <strong>तव्य</strong>being used instead as <strong>धोइबां</strong>. The augment <strong>इ</strong> is introduced beforethis <strong>ज</strong>where euphony requires it. Old M. possessed these formsand they are very frequently to be met with in our poets as inJñāneśvarī:</p>
<p>आतां आमुचा वलीं नायक। जे रूढ धीर सैनिक । से प्रसंगें आइक । सांगिजति ॥</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now inoidentally will be mentioned, the leaders, provedwarriors and soldiers in our army.&rsquo;</p>
<p>तयापरी तूं देवा । मज झकऊन न येसि माधवा।<br>
जरी पुण्याचा ओलावा । नाशिजैल॥</p>
<p>&ldquo;In thst msnner, O lord Mādhava, you will abandon me andwill not come to me if the moisture of virtue is dried up(IIt will be destroyed).</p>
<p>विचारीं तू अर्जुनु । कींकारुण्यें कीजसी दीनु ।<br>
सांग पां अंधकारें भानु । ग्रासिला आथी॥</p>
<p>&lsquo;Think, Arjuna, you are being msde contemptible by sorrow;say, is the sun ever swallowed up by darkness ?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here we have instsnces of the Present and Future Old Guj.had the passive :</p>
<p>जिहां पूजिजइ सालिग्राम । जिहां जपिइजे हरिनुं नाम।<br>
स्मृति पुराण मानीई गायइ । जीणि दिसि कराय जाग्य।<br>
जिहां षट्दर्शन दीजह त्याग । जिहां…वेदपुराण धर्म बुझीइ॥<br>
नव खंडे अपकीरति रही। माधवि म्लेछआणियासही॥</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where Śālīgrāma is worshipped, where the name of Hari ismuttered in meditation and Smṛtis, Purāṇas and the cows arerespected, in which country sacrifices are performed, where thereare the six philosophies, and alms are given, where Vedas,Purāṇas and duty are understood, there Mādhava for certainbrought the Mlechha and infamy rests (on his name) in the ninedivisions (of the world).&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here we have instances of the forms in जas <strong>पूजिजइ</strong> and in <strong>ई</strong>(Pr. <strong>इअ</strong>) <strong>बुझीइ</strong>; and also of the modern forms as <strong>कराय</strong> which willbe presently considered. In old H. poets we meet with suchforms now and then. Thus Tulsīdāsa :</p>
<p>महिमा आसु जान गणराऊ । प्रथम पुजियत नामप्रभाऊ ॥</p>
<p>&lsquo;The greatness of which (Rāma&rsquo;s name) the lord of theGaṇas (Gaṇapati) knows, he is first worshipped; this is theachievement of the name.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>चहियत युगल किशोर लखि । लोचन युगल अनेक ॥</strong> Behārīlāla.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Many couples of eyes are wanted to see the couple of youngpersons (Rādhāand Kṛṣṇa).</p>
<p>Hero <strong>पूजियत</strong> and <strong>चहियत</strong> are forms of the passive in <strong>ईय</strong>. Theverb <strong>चाहिये</strong> in mod. H. is also a passive forms as <strong>ज्योइये</strong>G. and<strong>पाहिजे</strong> M.</p>
<p>There are also, as in the Pr., Siddha Tadbhava forms of thepassive <strong>बुझणु</strong>S. &rsquo;to be heard,&rsquo; S. &rsquo;to be broken,&rsquo; H. &rsquo;to fleeaway,&rsquo; <strong>भुजणु</strong>S. &rsquo;to be fried,&rsquo;<strong>छिजणु</strong>S. &rsquo;to be plucked&rsquo; from pr. <strong>बुज्झ,मज्ज, भुज्ज</strong> and <strong>छिज्ज</strong>and Skr. <strong>बुध्य, भज्य, भृज्ज्य</strong> and <strong>छिद्य,पच-णें-पु-ना-णु-न</strong>from <strong>पच्च</strong> Pr., <strong>पच्य</strong> Skr. &rsquo;to be cooked&rsquo; in all, though the sense issomewhat altered. <strong>लाभणें</strong> M., <strong>लभणु</strong> S. from Pr. <strong>लब्भ</strong>,Skr. <strong>लभ्य</strong>&rsquo;to beobtained,&rsquo; <strong>बझणु</strong> S., <strong>बझना</strong> H. from Pr., <strong>बज्झ</strong>, Skr. <strong>बध्य</strong> &rsquo;to be bound;&rsquo;<strong>दिसणें-षुं-ना</strong> M, G. H. P. from Pr. <strong>दीस</strong>, Skr.<strong>दृश्य</strong> &rsquo;to be seen&rsquo; also <strong>दीखना</strong>H.; <strong>सुजणें-णुु</strong>M. S., <strong>सूजना</strong>H. P. from Pr.क<strong>ल्ल</strong>, Skr. <strong>कल्य</strong>&rsquo;to be known.&rsquo; <strong>सुचणें-वुं</strong>M. G. from <strong>मुच्च</strong> Pr., Skr. <strong>मूच्च</strong> &rsquo;to occur to one&rsquo;etc.</p>
<p><strong>THE CAUSAL IN THE VERNACULARS</strong></p>
<p>The causal is formed in M. by appending <strong>ईव</strong> or <strong>अव</strong> as <strong>करीवणें</strong>or <strong>करवणें, धावीवणें</strong>or <strong>धाववणें</strong>; you will remember, I have identified.the <strong>ई</strong> that non-reflexive transitive roots take in M. with the</p>
<p>Parasm. <strong>इ</strong>, and <strong>ए</strong> or <strong>अ</strong>of the intransitive and reflexive with theĀtm. Now when a root becomes causative, its reflexive characteris lost, all verbs become transitive, and hence we have <strong>अ</strong> or <strong>ई</strong>promiscuously used after all roots. For this reason even inSkr. all causal verbs are both Parasm. and Ātm. I do not derivethe rule about M. verbs taking <strong>अ</strong>or <strong>इ</strong> from that in Skr., butattribute it to the same causes. In the Goan. and Cit. we have<strong>अय</strong> for <strong>अव</strong>, the <strong>य</strong> being pronounced as a consonant and often likethe vowel <strong>इ</strong>, as <strong>करयणं</strong> or <strong>करइणां</strong>. In the Savantvadi and Vengurladistricts it is formed in the same way, but in the other portionsof the area over which the Mālvaṇīis spoken it is formed as inthe principal Marathi. The <strong>य</strong> stands for <strong>व</strong>; for this semi-vowelis often, by the vulgar, dropped leaving the vowel insteed, as<strong>नआ</strong> for <strong>नवा</strong> like the H. <strong>नया</strong> for <strong>नवा, नाई</strong> for <strong>नावी</strong> etc.</p>
<p>In G. the causal termination is <strong>आव</strong>as <strong>कराववुं</strong> &rsquo;to cause to do,&rsquo; <strong>तपावबुं</strong> &lsquo;make hot;&rsquo; in S. <strong>आइ</strong> as <strong>वधाइणु</strong> &rsquo;tocause increase,&rsquo; <strong>घोआइणु</strong> &rsquo;to cause wash; in P. <strong>आऊ</strong> or <strong>वाऊ</strong> as <strong>कराउना</strong> or <strong>करवाउना</strong>.</p>
<p>In H, it is <strong>आ</strong> as <strong>नचाना, पढाना</strong>, but <strong>नचावना</strong> and <strong>पढावना</strong> are alsoused;and the termination <strong>वा</strong> is invariably added to the first causalto form asecond or double causal as <strong>नचवाना, पढवाना</strong> from <strong>नचाना</strong>and <strong>पढाना</strong>. The <strong>आव</strong>occurs in first causals in poetry, as Tulsīdās:<strong>अब प्रभुचरित</strong> <strong>सुनावह मोहि</strong> &lsquo;Narrate(lit. make me hear) to me the history of the lord;&lsquo;also:—</p>
<p>यथा अनेक वेष धरि नृत्य करैनट कोइ।<br>
सोइ सोइ भाव दिखावैआपुन होइ ना सोइ॥</p>
<p>&lsquo;As an actor assuming various masks dances; so he (the lord)shows this character and that but is not himself that ( what heshows ).&rsquo;</p>
<p>The B. and O. causal is also similarly formed by adding <strong>आ</strong> as<strong>कराइ</strong> &lsquo;I cause to do,&rsquo; <strong>देखाई</strong>&lsquo;I show&rsquo; etc. Here also as in the H.,the <strong>व</strong> of <strong>आव</strong>is elided.</p>
<p>The इ of the S. <strong>आइ</strong>must be the <strong>इ</strong> which we have observed isused after transitive and non-reflexive roots in Pot., the pres. part.etc. as <strong>मारींदो</strong>.</p>
<p>Thus then the causal termination in all the languages is<strong>आव</strong> or <strong>आव</strong>, which is the same as one of the three in Pr. For, you</p>
<p>will remember, the Pr. has <strong>ए, आवे</strong>and, the <strong>ए</strong> of the latter beingdropped, there is another <strong>आव</strong>. We have also a good manyexamples in the vernaculars of the Pr. causals mentioned byHemacandra as formed by dropping all terminations and preserving the vowel changes, guns or viddhi, which roots takebefore the Skr. <strong>अय</strong>or Pr. <strong>ए</strong> Thus:—</p>

<p>I have already mentioned that the causal of some roots isformed in H. by inserting <strong>ल</strong> before the causal termination <strong>आ</strong>.G. has <strong>ड</strong> and Sindhi <strong>र</strong>for <strong>ल</strong>, <strong>खवाढवुं</strong> &rsquo;to cause to eat&rsquo; from <strong>खा</strong>to eat, <strong>देवाडवुं</strong> &rsquo;to cause to give,&rsquo; <strong>देखाडवुं</strong> &rsquo;to show&rsquo; from <strong>देख</strong>&rsquo;to see,&rsquo;<strong>धवाडवुं</strong> to cause to run,&rsquo; <strong>डिअणु</strong>&rsquo;to give,&rsquo; <strong>दिआरणु</strong>&rsquo;to cause to give,&rsquo;<strong>सिखणु-सेखारणु, बेहणु-वेहारणु</strong> &rsquo;to cause to sit.&rsquo; In these instances wehave <strong>वा</strong> or <strong>आ</strong>before <strong>ड</strong>; but in G. all these forms have <strong>आव</strong> optionally added to them when the previous <strong>आ</strong>is dropped as <strong>वचडाववुं</strong> &rsquo;to cause to run,&rsquo; <strong>खवडाववुं</strong> &rsquo;to cause to eat &rsquo;etc.; and inS. we have the causal <strong>आइ</strong>appended to <strong>र</strong> after roots ending in <strong>आ</strong>as <strong>खाराइणु</strong> &rsquo;to cause to eat,&rsquo;<strong>घाराइणु</strong> &rsquo;to cause to wound,&rsquo; <strong>धाराइणु</strong>&rsquo;to cause to suok&rsquo; or &rsquo; to suckle;&rsquo; so that the intervening <strong>आ</strong> isinterchangeable in both these languages with the causal termination and hence some way conveys the same sense. M. has atrace of these forms as <strong>भोंवणें</strong> &rsquo;to turn,&rsquo; to cause to turn,&rsquo;<strong>घावणें</strong> &lsquo;run,&rsquo; <strong>धावडणें</strong>&rsquo;to cause to run,&rsquo; <strong>भिणें-भेडावणें</strong>&rsquo;to threaten.&lsquo;Hemacandra mentions <strong>भमाडो</strong> as the causal base of <strong>भ्रम</strong> and gives<strong>वाउ</strong> in the sense of pushing which is very likely a causal form of<strong>वा</strong>. We have this <strong>घाड</strong>in the sense of sending in M.</p>
<p>We have seen that <strong>द</strong> or<strong>त</strong> is sometimes changed to <strong>ड</strong> and thenceto <strong>र</strong> or <strong>ल</strong> in the Pr. and vernaculars; whence it appears that<strong>पिलाना</strong> is a denominstive or nominal root from <strong>पिला</strong> or <strong>पिडा</strong>or <strong>पीत</strong>,by the application of the usual denominative termination <strong>आप्</strong>,which is also the causal termination. In Skr. such a denominative has the sense of doing the thing expressed by the base as <strong>पीतं करोति-पीतयति</strong>,Śaur. <strong>पीदावेदि</strong>.</p>
<p>We have a great many denominatives from past participles;first in the sense of <em>being</em> the thing expressed by the base, inwhich case the participle has simply the verbal terminationsappended to it, as <strong>लग्गइ</strong> from <strong>लग, अब्भिडइ</strong> from <strong>अभ्येत, कट्टइ</strong>from <strong>कष्ट,पल्लटइ, पल्लत्थइ</strong> from <strong>पर्यस्त</strong> etc.; and secondly in the sense of doing,when <strong>आव</strong> or <strong>आवे</strong> intervenes between the base and the terminations,as <strong>भीदावेदि</strong>in Mālatī-Mādhava, from which we have in M, <strong>भेडावणें</strong>.The forms in which we have <strong>आ</strong> before <strong>ड</strong> as <strong>देवाडवुं, खषाडषुं</strong>etc. aredenominatives from the past participles of original Pr. cauealsas <strong>दाविद</strong> or <strong>खाविद</strong>, the causal fermination <strong>आव</strong> being changed to <strong>औ</strong>and <strong>आ</strong>as in the H. in ordinary causals. In the vernaculars wehave also the first class of denominatives expressive of beinglike the thing denoted by the base, as:—</p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>We have another verbal base in M. which involves the ides ofpower and ability as <strong>करवतें</strong> &lsquo;can be done,&rsquo; <strong>बसवतें</strong>&lsquo;can be sat.&lsquo;These forms are passive when the original verb istransitive, andimpersonal when it is intransitive. In old M. <strong>प</strong>is somesimesseen for <strong>व</strong>:—</p>
<p>जरी वेदें बहुत बोलिलें। विविध भेद सचिले । तरी आपण हितआपुलें । तेंचि घेपे ॥</p>
<p>&lsquo;Even if the Veda has told much and indicated a great manydistinct things, still one should take that which is beneficialto himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>काय झणिपे स्थितप्रज्ञ ?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who should be called <strong>स्थितप्रज्ञ</strong> ?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here the sense is simply passive and does not involve thenotion of power. These forms are to be derived from the pass.of the causal, whence <strong>करवे</strong>is <strong>करव्वइ</strong>Pr. for <strong>कराप्यते</strong>,Skr. <strong>कार्यते</strong>.Power is implied on account of the forms being derived in thismanner; for, <strong>गोविन्देन कर्म कार्यते मया</strong>in Skr. means the work is causedto be done by me by Govinda; when the agent caused istaken to be the same as that who causes, the sense is the work incaused to be done by me by myself, i. e. &lsquo;I am the causer of myselfto do it i. e., &lsquo;I can do it.&rsquo; In G. this causal pass. <strong>अव्व</strong> is transformed into <strong>आ</strong>, as the causal <strong>अव</strong>so often is, and the sense is simplypassive in some cases and passive and causative in others, as<strong>आं छोकरी मूर्ख जणाय छे</strong>&rsquo; this boy is known to be &amp; fool; &rsquo; <strong>आ काम माराथीकरातुं नथी</strong> &rsquo;this work cannot be done from me. There are tracesof these forms in the other languages also, though the grammariars do not notice them, as H. <strong>एकवचन बस्तुर संख्या एक बुझाय</strong>&lsquo;By thesingulars the number of a thing is known to be one,&rsquo; <strong>वह वाक्य कहाता है</strong> &rsquo;that is called a sentence&rsquo; etc^(<strong>1</strong>).</p>
<p>Thus then you will see that we have nearly the whole of thegrammar of the Prakrits, i. e. all their grammatical forms, inour vernaculars. The cases in the forms which they assumedin the Apabhraṁśa have been preserved, some in this languageand some in that, but not all in one and the same. And alongwith them there are sometimes newly constructed forms also.The pronouns are the same as in the Pr. and the Apabhramsa. The two Prakrit tenses and one mood are preserved. All thevernaculars have the Present, though, except in the O. and B.,it has acquired another sense and another word or expression iswanted to restriot it to the signification of the present time.G. S. P. and H. have lost the Imperative, but it is preserved bythe other three languages. The Future is retained by the G. andthe Braj; while this latter possesses the solitary form of the Aoristthat the old Pr. had retained. These are the only really simpleor uncompounded verbal forms existing in our languages; therest are made up by compounding or by using Pres. participlesas bases and appending the Pres. verbal terminations, as will behereafter shown. Past time is almost universally expressed bythe past participle, and this retains the passive, in some casesthe active, character it had in Skr. and Pr. in all those languagesthat have not thoroughly lost the distinction of gender andnumber. The several other Prakrit participles are preserved andwe have no other. The passive forms are seen in Sindhi andPanjabi, the former having one set and the latter the other.The Pr. causal termination is preserved almost unchanged bythe M. and G. while in the other languages it is somewhattransformed. So that, as they are at present, our vernacularshave between them preserved all that the Prakrits had andpreserved nothing that the Prakrits lost.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1. Mr. Beames traces the vernacular causal terminations <strong>अव, इव, उ, आ</strong> etc.to the Skr. <strong>अय</strong>. But this is evidently a mistake. The Pr. &lsquo;<strong>आवे</strong> or <strong>आव</strong> hasescaped him somehow. The <strong>ल</strong> of the Hindi causal forms he alse derivesfrom the <strong>य</strong> of <strong>अय</strong>. But this <strong>य</strong> is too weak to be changed to any other letterthan the vowel <strong>ए</strong>, and <strong>य</strong> is never changed to a semi-vowel excepting inthe doubtful instance <strong>लट्टी</strong> from <strong>वाष्ट</strong>.</p>
<p>And as we ascend higher up in the history of each of theselanguages, we find in use such forms as it has now lost. All ourvernaculars must at one time have been in the condition inwhich we find the Apabhraṃśa, but the dialect of that namewhich is treated of by the grammarians, and specimens of whichwe find in the scraps of literature I have noticed, resemble the G.and the Braj and in a less degree the S. P. and the ordinary H.</p>
<p>The old literary dialect of the H. area was the Braj; and theworks of TulsĪdās, Bihārilāl, KabĪra and others are in that dialect,though these are called old Hindi poets, instead of old Braj poetsas they should be called and as they are called by natives. Inthis old Braj literature we find the Apabhraṁśaforms of thePresent tense unchanged; and from these has directly been derived the Present tense of the modern S., G., P., Braj aud H. TheApbhr. Future is found in the G, and in modern Braj and in the</p>
<p>poets in an older and less corrupt form also, though the <strong>स</strong> isohanged to <strong>ह</strong>. Such Apbhr. forms as <strong>जेम, तेम</strong>are preserved in theG.; and the neuter sing. in <strong>उं</strong> in that dialect as well as in theBraj, where it occurs especially in the verbal nouns or infinitives.The first pers. sing. <strong>हुं</strong> exists in G., old H. and a dialect of thePanjabi. The other dialects also possess, as I have observed,some Ap. peculiarities, but the four named above bear a closerconnection to it.</p>
<p>And since the Apabhraṃśa is referred by the grammarians tothe Śaurasenï type, we may regard these four modern dialects,viz the G. S. P. and H., as the representatives of the old Śaurasenī,which from the name seems to have been the dialect of thecountry about Mathurā.</p>
<p>The distinction between this and the old Mahārāṣṭrīwas, aswe have have seen, not very great and some of the peculiaritieswere such as could not last for many centuries. The change of<strong>त</strong> and <strong>थ</strong> to <strong>द</strong> and <strong>ध</strong>, for instance, instead of elision and <strong>ह</strong> is ofsuch a nature. The law of elision which operated in a greatmany other cases could not long be kept from extending itselfto <strong>त</strong>. But still we do find in the modern G. such forms as <strong>किटुं,पिटुं,खाटुं</strong>etc. for <strong>कृतम्, पीतम्</strong> snd <strong>खादितम्</strong>. This change was madein some cases in the Śaurasenīas in <strong>सउन्दला</strong>, for <strong>शकुन्तला</strong>, and inothers not, as <strong>अय्यउत्त</strong> for <strong>आर्यपुत्र</strong>. And the change of <strong>न्त</strong> to <strong>न्द</strong>and<strong>द</strong> we find in the S. and P. Present Participles. The Śaur.Future which had an intercalatory <strong>स्स</strong> instead of the Mahārāṣṭrī<strong>हि</strong> is, as we have seen, preserved in the G. and the Brai with theslight modification it underwent in the Apabhraṃśa. Then, ifwe follow Vararuci, the Śaur. Absolute termination was <strong>इअ</strong>,and in the prose speeches in the dramatic plays it is this alonethat we find. The absolutive in these four modern languagesis formed by adding this same termination with the <strong>अ</strong> dropped.</p>
<p>Now all these peculiarities are absent from the M. In theold Mahārāṣṭrīverses, occurring in the plays, as well as according to Vararuci, the absolutive termination was <strong>ऊण</strong>, which wefind in the M. alone. The past passive participle of <strong>कृ</strong> and <strong>वृ</strong> inold Mahr. was <strong>कअ</strong> and <strong>मअ,</strong> and we have these forms in the M. in<strong>केला</strong> and <strong>मेला</strong>, as we have seen, while <strong>कि</strong> instead of <strong>के, सु</strong>instead of</p>
<p><strong>मे</strong> occur in the four Śaurasenic dialects and these we find in theplays.The Pres. and Imper. of the M. have been derived fromthe Pr. and not from the Apbbr. forms. Thus then, the M. is themodern representative of the old Mahārāṣṭrī, so that it hardlyadmits of any doubt that the two old languages derived theirnames from the provinces in which they prevailed. The B. and O.have a few peculiarities of the Śaur.; and they seem to occupya middle position between M. on the one hand and the four Apbhr.or Śaur, languages on the other; while the consonantal changes,especially the reduction of all the sibilants to the palatal <strong>श</strong>, pointto their being the descendants of the oldMāgadhī.</p>
<p><strong>LECTURE VI</strong></p>
<p><strong>NEW GRAMMATICAL FORMATIONS IN THE NORTHERN<br>
VERNACULARS</strong></p>
<p>We will now proceed to consider those forms in the grammarof our languages which are not derived from correspondingSanskrit or Prakrit forms, but which have been constructed inrecent times. Such new forms owe their origin to various causes.The old ones lose their distinctive portions and become confusedby phonetic decay; or, having been in long use, lose all freshnessof meaning, and cease to be as expressive as one would wish themto be, or their sense is not exactly that which one desires toconvey. Thus the old Present and Future got confused in ourvernaculars and a new Future was wanted. The old Present itselfacquired a potential sense in some cases and a past habitual sensein others, whence for the expression of present time anotherset of forms was required.</p>
<p>In Sanskrit itself such a phrase as <strong>द्विजाय यवागूः</strong>&lsquo;gruel for aBrahman&rsquo; is not so expressive as <strong>द्विजार्था यवागूः</strong> &lsquo;gruel for aBrahman&rsquo;s purpose&rsquo;; which again is analysed into its separateelements for greater distinctness into <strong>द्विजस्यार्थे यवागूः</strong>&lsquo;gruel forthe purpose of a Brahman&rsquo;.</p>
<p>When different words so brought together are kept distinctand consciously used, there is no growth of new forms. But if byfrequent use and the oblivion of etymology such an expressionas <strong>स्यार्थे</strong>comes to be looked upon as an independent word meaning&quot;for the sake of&rdquo; and applied promiscuously to all nouns,including such as could not originally by the usage of Sanskrithave it, as in <strong>भ्रातृस्यार्थे</strong>, it becomes a termination, and a new caseform grows up and the old one often goes out of use. Then againphonetic decay sets in and by reducing this expression to <strong>स्सठ्ठे</strong>and ultimately to <strong>साठे</strong> ( M. <strong>साठीं</strong> the original word being <strong>सट्ठम्मि</strong>),irrevocably stamps it with the character of a case terminationhaving no meaning by itself. Lastly, if one wishes to say of abook that it belongs to <em>him</em> and looks upon it as possessing thatattribute and subordinates <em>him</em> to it, the expression <strong>तस्य पुस्तकम्</strong></p>
<p>will not serve his purpose, but he must have some such as <strong>तदीयंपुस्तकम्</strong>. And if this way of looking at things becomes general, <strong>तदीय</strong>supersedes <strong>तस्य</strong>. In this way our new forms have grown up.</p>
<p><strong>THE OBLIQUE FORMS</strong></p>
<p>The case terminations are, in the majority of the languages,applied not to the original noun itself but to a certain modifiedform of it called the oblique form, or by the native Marathigrammarians the Sāmānya-rūpa or the common form, because it is used in all the cases.</p>
<p><strong>THE OBLIQUE FORM IN THE MARATHI</strong></p>
<p>There are two Sāmānya-rūpas for the two numbers. In theold languages plurality is expressed by independent terminations,but the new terminations of the modern languages being the samefor both numbers, plurality is denoted by a distinctive obliqueform. Some of the modern languages that have no Sāmānya-rūpa have recourse to a novel way of expressing plurality. Ofall the vernaculars it is the Marathi that is the most particularin the formation of the oblique and has minute rules. Sindhicomes next, then the Hindi and the Panjabi; after these theGujarati, and lastly the Bengali and the Oriya; which may besaid to have no oblique form at all.</p>
<p>The Marathi oblique forms are made up by adding theseterminations :—</p>

<p>(d) Some Masc. and nearly all neuter nouns in <strong>ऊ</strong>. Some ofthese change <strong>ऊ</strong> to <strong>वा</strong>, and others drop it, since it is the<strong>ऊ</strong> of the nom. sing.

The usagein several cases is still unsettled as regards some of these forms.You will observe that there is an anusvāra in the pl. of all forms.Another fact should also be borne in mind that nouns in <strong>ई</strong> and <strong>ऊ</strong>often take the <strong>आ-आं</strong>or <strong>ए-आं</strong>forms though these properly belongto nouns in <strong>अ</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>THE OBLIQUE FORM IN SINDHI</strong></p>
<p>(1) The following classes of nouns take <strong>अ</strong> for the obl. sing.and <strong>आं, एं</strong> and <strong>अनि</strong>for the pl.:—</p>
<p>(a) Masc. nouns, the nom. sing. of which ends in <strong>उ</strong>, as<strong>देहु</strong> &lsquo;a country&rsquo;, <strong>देह-देहनि</strong> obl., <strong>देहजो</strong> sing. &lsquo;of a country&rsquo;, <strong>देहनिजो</strong>pl. &lsquo;of countries&rsquo;, also <strong>देहां-देहें-जो</strong>.</p>
<p>(b) Masc. nouns in <strong>ओ</strong>, which,however, combine the finaland the termination into <strong>ए</strong>as in the Cit. Mar. as <strong>वाढो</strong>&lsquo;acarpenter&rsquo;, obl. <strong>वाढे</strong>sing., <strong>बाढनि, वाढां</strong>and <strong>वाढें</strong>pl.</p>
<p>(2) The following nouns take <strong>अ</strong>for the obl. sing. and <strong>नि, अनि</strong>and <strong>उनि</strong> for the pl. in addition to <strong>आं</strong> and <strong>एं</strong> :—</p>
<p>(a) Maso, nouns in <strong>ई</strong> as <strong>हारी</strong> &lsquo;a peasant&rsquo;, <strong>हारिअ</strong> or <strong>हारिआं</strong> sing.,<strong>हार्यें, हारिएं, हार्या, हारिनि, हार्यनि</strong> and <strong>हार्युनि</strong> pl.</p>
<p>(b) Fem. nouns in <strong>ई</strong> as <strong>घोडी</strong>&lsquo;a mare&rsquo;, obl. <strong>घोडिअ</strong>sing. <strong>घोडिआं,घोडिएं, घोडिनि, घोड्यनि</strong> and <strong>घोडयुनि</strong>pl.</p>
<p>(c) Masc. nouns in <strong>ऊ</strong>; as <strong>माण्हू</strong>&lsquo;a man&rsquo;, obl. <strong>माण्हुअ</strong> sing.,<strong>माण्डुनि, माण्डुअनि, माण्डुआं</strong> and <strong>माण्हुएं</strong> pl.</p>
<p>(3) Nouns in short <strong>इ</strong> have no separate form for the sing. ofthe obl., the nom. form being used; the pl. they form like theabove class, as <strong>गाल्हि</strong>f. &lsquo;a story&rsquo;, obl. <strong>गाल्हि</strong>sing., <strong>गाल्हिआं</strong>, <strong>गाल्हिएं, गाल्हिअनि, गाल्हिउनि</strong>and <strong>गाल्हिनि</strong>pl. Masc. nouns in <strong>इ</strong>, however, donot take the forms in <strong>अनि</strong>and <strong>उनि</strong>; as <strong>केहरि</strong> &lsquo;a lion&rsquo; sing., <strong>केहरिनि-आं-एं</strong>pl.</p>
<p>(4) Fem, nouns in <strong>अ, आ</strong>and <strong>उ</strong> have no separate form for thesing, while in the pl. they take as a &lsquo;wish&rsquo;, obl. <strong>सध</strong>sing., <strong>सधुनि</strong>pl.; <strong>हचा</strong>&lsquo;a murder&rsquo;, obl. <strong>हचा</strong>sing., <strong>हचाउनि</strong> pl.; <strong>विजु</strong>&rsquo;lightning&rsquo;, obl.<strong>विजु</strong> sing.,<strong>विजुनि</strong>pl. The first has <strong>सधां</strong>and <strong>सधें</strong>also for the pl. Herethere is one type for one class of nouns and not two, as is the casesometimes in the M. The form in <strong>उनि</strong>is taken by all femininenouns in <strong>अ, आ</strong> and <strong>ई</strong>and also masc. nouns in <strong>ई</strong>. Masc. nouns in <strong>ऊ</strong>and fem. nouns in <strong>उ</strong> have <strong>उ</strong> in the original base itself and it doesnot belong to the termination.</p>
<p><strong>THE OBLIQUE FORM IN PANJABI</strong></p>
<p>The Panjabi has the termination <strong>ए</strong> for the sing. obl. of nounsending in <strong>आ</strong>. The sing. of all other nouns has no special formwhile <strong>आ</strong> is appended to all nouns to form the obl. pl., beforewhich the final <strong>आ</strong>of nouns preceded by a consonant is changedto <strong>इ</strong>, as <strong>घोडा</strong> &lsquo;a horse,&rsquo; obl. sing. and <strong>घोडिआं</strong>pl. Final <strong>उ</strong>preceded by a vowel combines with this <strong>आं</strong>to form <strong>वां</strong>, as <strong>पिष्ठ</strong>or <strong>पेउ</strong> &lsquo;father,&rsquo; <strong>पेवां</strong>obl. pl.; and final <strong>अ</strong>forms <strong>आं</strong> as व &lsquo;man&rsquo;, <strong>मनुखां</strong>obl. pl. There are no other changes.</p>
<p><strong>THE OBLIQUE FORM IN HINDI</strong></p>
<p>The Hindi, like the Panjabi, has an oblique sing. for nounsin <strong>आ</strong>only. It ends in <strong>ए</strong>, as that of the S. and Cit. M. nouns in<strong>ओ</strong>, Karh. M. and P. noubs in <strong>आ</strong> as; <strong>घोडे-घोडेका</strong>.The pl. obl. ofall nouns whatever is formed by adding <strong>ओं</strong> which amalgamateswith the preceding <strong>अ</strong> of all nouns and the <strong>आ</strong>of such as aremasculine, and combines with <strong>इ</strong> to form <strong>इयों</strong>; as <strong>गांव</strong>&lsquo;a village.&rsquo;<strong>गांवोंका</strong> pl. &lsquo;of villages&rsquo;; <strong>घोडा</strong>&lsquo;a horse&rsquo;, <strong>घोडोंका</strong>pl. &lsquo;of horses&rsquo;;<strong>पति</strong>&lsquo;a master&rsquo;, <strong>पतियोंका</strong>pl. &lsquo;of masters.&rsquo; In other cases it is simplyadded to the noun as <strong>भांलू</strong> &lsquo;a jackal,&rsquo; <strong>भालुओंका</strong> pl. &lsquo;of jackals&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In the Brajbhāṣāand in the old poets the obl. pl. of all nounshas <strong>न</strong> or <strong>नि</strong> instead of <strong>ओं</strong>, as <strong>संत</strong>&lsquo;a good man&rsquo; <strong>संतनका</strong>pl. &lsquo;of good men&rsquo;.This termination is also added to the nom. sing, to form the nom.pl. of those nouns that have no distinctive form for it; as <strong>लोग</strong>&lsquo;people&rsquo; sing. <strong>लोगन</strong> pl.; <strong>भगत</strong> &lsquo;devotee&rsquo;, <strong>भगतन</strong> pl. ( <strong>चहुजुग भगतन बांधलवाटी</strong>— Kabīr).</p>
<p><strong>THE OBLIQUE FORM IN GUJARATI</strong></p>
<p>In G. the obl. form of masc. and neuter nouns ending in <strong>ओ</strong>and <strong>उं</strong> is formed by substituting <strong>आ</strong> for those vowels. The latter</p>
<p>take an anusvära in the pl., and the forms of the former for bothnumbers are alike as <strong>घोडो-घोडा-घोडाने</strong> sing.and pl. &rsquo;to a horse orhorses&rsquo;; <strong>केलुं</strong> &lsquo;a plantain&rsquo;, <strong>केला-केलाने</strong> sing &rsquo;to a plantain&rsquo;, <strong>केलानें</strong>pl.&rsquo;to plantains.&rsquo; But the nom. pl. forms of these are <strong>घोडा</strong>and <strong>केलां</strong>,whence it appears that in the pl. the obl. cases are formed simplyadding the terminations to the nom. pl. and there is no such thingas a common oblique form. And this is the case with the sing, aswell as the pl. of all other nouns; as <strong>माणस</strong>&lsquo;a man&rsquo; nom. sing.,<strong>माणसो</strong> nom. pl <strong>माणसने</strong> sing., <strong>माणसोनें</strong> pl. The plural termination is<strong>ओ</strong> and is thus used in all cases. It is added in these days evento the final <strong>आ</strong> and <strong>आं</strong>of nouns in <strong>ओ</strong>and <strong>उं</strong> to distinguish the pl.forms from the sing. as <strong>घोडा</strong> or <strong>घोडाओ</strong> nom. pl, <strong>घोडाने</strong> or <strong>घोडाओने</strong>dat. pl. But the practice has not yet established itself andmostly the forms without <strong>ओ</strong>are used. Masc. and neut. nounsending in <strong>ओ</strong>or <strong>उं</strong> are often used in the pl. without it in suchinstances as <strong>तिहा घणा माणस छे</strong>in the nom. and other cases.And this is the usual practice in old G. literature; as <strong>लोकना पुत्रना विवाह होईछी</strong>(Panch.): &lsquo;The marriages of the sons of other people areperformed;&rsquo; <strong>सर्व शास्त्रनो परिचय छे</strong>&lsquo;he has a knowledge of all theŚāstraa&rsquo;.</p>
<p>कलजुगना ब्राह्मण जैटला<br>
धर्महीन थासे तेटला<br>
तां घर करसे पोता तणां<br>
स्वर्गारोहणनो कीधी ग्रंथ<br>
जेहमा सकल धर्मनी पंथ</p>
<p>Svārgrohaṇa by Sundarabhaṭṭa.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All the Brahmans of Kaliyuga will be without virtue. Theywill build their homes there. The work Svargārohaṇa wascomposed in which there is the way of all virtues.&rsquo;</p>
<p>अनेक पंखी करे पोकार। गिरिजंगल बहु डुंगरा बली वांदरना ठाठ</p>
<p>Kāvyadohans, Tulasī.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Many birds raise a noise. There are mountains, forestsmany hills; over these is a crowd of monkeys.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The <strong>ओ</strong> however is seen in fem. nouns ending in <strong>ई</strong>:—</p>
<p>समुद्र गांमनी नदीयोसे इसे तेमांधी जल सुकीजसे ॥</p>
<p>Svargārohaṇa.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The water of the sea and of the rivers on land (in villages)will be dried up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>मोठा पर्षत नदियोजैह । तेह तणी नहि लाधेछेह॥</p>
<p>Kāvyadohaṇa, Tulasī.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is no end of great mountains and rivers that exist.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It therefore appears that in masc. and neut. nouns the <strong>ओ</strong>is amodern innovation and that there was no distinction between thesing. and pl. cases except the nom. of nouns in <strong>ओ</strong> and <strong>उं</strong>. Thetrue explanation therefore of the modern <strong>ओ</strong>of the pl. is that fem.nouns in <strong>आ</strong>and <strong>ई</strong> preserved this termination, since they had it inthe Prakrits, as the minor M. dialects have done, and, the sing.and pl. forms of mase. nouns being alike, the fem. <strong>ओ</strong> was transferred to them afterwards to distinguish the pl. as is now beingdone to nouns in <strong>ओ</strong> and <strong>उं</strong>. Thus then the G. noun may be said to have no real Sāmānya-rūpa or oblique form. Adjectives in <strong>ओ</strong>however have a form ending in <strong>ए</strong> when they are used to qualify asubstantive in the instr. or old loc, case in <strong>ए</strong> as <strong>आ काम सारे माणसे कीधुं</strong> &rsquo;this thing was done by a good man&rsquo;, <strong>तलावने काटे छोकरा गिया</strong>&lsquo;boys went to the margin of a tank&rsquo;, but this may be explainedas a remnant of the old agreement between the noun and itsadjective and <strong>सारे</strong>may be regarded as an instr. form and <strong>तलावने</strong>a locative.</p>
<p><strong>ABSENCE OF THE OBLIQUE FORM IN BENGALI AND ORIYA</strong></p>
<p>The Bengali and Oriya apply the case terminations directly tothe nom. and there is no oblique form. The new terminationsbeing, as in all the modern languages, the same for both numbersand there being no oblique form to express the distinctionbetween them as in M. S. H. etc., these languages, like the Guj.,were under the necessity of deriving some expression for denotingplurality. The G. found its fem. <strong>ओ</strong>and employed it for thispurpose, but the B. and O. had no such distinctively pl.termination left to fall back upon and so they have recourse tothe use of a word signifying collection such as <strong>दिग</strong> originally&rsquo;direction, row, line&rsquo;, <strong>गण, समूह</strong>and <strong>सकल</strong> etc., after the noun, theplurality of which is to be expressed. Thus <strong>राजा</strong> &lsquo;a king&rsquo;, <strong>राजार</strong>&lsquo;of a king&rsquo;, <strong>राजादिगेर</strong>&lsquo;of kings&rsquo; lit. &lsquo;of the direction row or line of a</p>
<p>king.&rsquo; Sometimes the word <strong>दिग</strong>is attached to the gen. sing. as<strong>राजारदिगेर</strong> to express the gen relation between the <strong>राजा</strong> and <strong>दिग</strong>,which is understood in the first expression. To nouns denoting inferior animals <strong>समूह</strong> and such words are appended and suchothers as <strong>सकल</strong> to those signifying inanimate creatures as <strong>कुक्कुरेर</strong>of a dog&rsquo; <strong>कुक्कुरसमुहेर</strong>&lsquo;of dogs.&lsquo;The Oriya sign of the plural is<strong>मान</strong> for rational and animate creatures and <strong>सकल समस्त</strong> etc. forirrational or inanimate, as <strong>पुशु</strong> &lsquo;abeast&rsquo;, <strong>पुशुर</strong>sing. &lsquo;of a beast&rsquo;,<strong>पुशुमानकर</strong> &lsquo;of beasts.&lsquo;The B. adds <strong>रा</strong> to the nom, sing. of names ofrational creatures to form the nom. pl., while <strong>समूह, सकल</strong>, etc. areapplied to the rest, as <strong>राजा</strong>&lsquo;a king&rsquo;. &lsquo;kings&rsquo;, <strong>राजारा</strong> &lsquo;kings&rsquo;; <strong>कुक्कुर</strong> &lsquo;adog&rsquo;,<strong>कुक्कुरसमूह</strong>&lsquo;dogs&rsquo;. The O. adds <strong>ए</strong> to <strong>मान</strong>to form the nom. pl. as<strong>पशुमाने</strong>.This is the same as that of <strong>घोडे</strong>in M. and H.</p>
<p><strong>THE NATURE OF THE OBLIQUE FORM</strong></p>
<p>Now the question is what is the nature of this Sāmānya-rūpaor oblique form, why does a noun undergo a certain modificationbefore it becomes fit to receive the termination and what is thesignification of the modified form and of the nasal that appearsin the plural. Let us see how we, at the present day, join certainwords expressive of relation such as <strong>संनिध</strong>or <strong>पार्शी</strong> with &amp; noun.We say <strong>त्याच्या</strong> <strong>सैनिध</strong> or <strong>त्याच्या पार्शी</strong> i. e. put the noun into the gen.case. Now this <strong>त्याच्यापाशीं</strong> is convertible with <strong>त्याजपाशीं</strong>, inwhich <strong>त्याज</strong>is the oblique form of <strong>तो</strong>the demonstrative.Similarly we append even some of the case terminations tothe gen as <strong>माझ्यानें काम करवत नाहीं</strong> I cannot do the work; <strong>त्याच्यांतकांहीं पाणी नाहीं</strong>&rsquo;there is no spirit (lit. water) in him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>May the Sāmānyarüpa then be an original genitive? The gen.is used in the Prakrits and even in Pali, not only with independentwords, but is made the base of some cases also, as we have seen,and the case terminations attached to it; thus <strong>ममं</strong>is acc. sing. of<strong>अहम्</strong> &lsquo;I&rsquo; in the Pali and the Pr., <strong>ममाई</strong> instr, <strong>ममादो, ममाहि</strong> abl.,<strong>ममम्मि</strong>loc. in the latter, in which instances the usual terminations ofthose cases are added to the original gen. form <strong>मम</strong>. We findeverywhere in the history of our languages that after a time theterminations in some cases come to have an independent senseand then they are detached from the original base and used like</p>
<p>ordinary post-positions. Thus, before the loc. <strong>म्मि</strong> was appendedto <strong>मम</strong>, it must have acquired some such sense as &lsquo;in the interiorof&rsquo; and that the whole expression <strong>ममम्मि</strong>might mean in theinterior of me&rsquo;. Similarly in the Apabhraṁśa, some of the postpositions which came into use and which, as I shall hereaftershow, have grown into our case terminations are used with thegen. of the noun to which they are attached.Thus:—<strong>हउंझिज्जउंतउ केहिं पिअ तुहुंपुणु अन्नह रेसि</strong> &lsquo;I pine sway for thee, ohbeloved, but thou for another&rsquo;, in which we have the postposition<strong>केहिं</strong> and <strong>रेसि</strong> having the sense of &lsquo;for&rsquo; used with the genitives <strong>तउं</strong>&rsquo;thy&rsquo; and <strong>अन्नह</strong>&lsquo;of another.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>ANALYSIS OF THE MARATHI OBLIQUE FORM</strong></p>
<p>And if we examine the oblique forms themselves, we shall findthat that they are derived from the Apbhr. and Pr. genitives.Thus the form in <strong>आ</strong> sing, and <strong>आं</strong> pl. which nouns in <strong>अ, आ</strong>etc.take is derived from the Apbhr. <strong>ह</strong> sing. and <strong>हं</strong> or <strong>अं</strong> pl. derivedfrom Pr. <strong>स</strong> and <strong>णं</strong>. The grammarians give the Apbhr. sing.termination as <strong>हो</strong>, but <strong>ह</strong> is also found, as in <strong>अन्नह</strong> in the abovequotation, and in the following occuring in an old work:—</p>
<p>कान्द्र तणइसंपत्ति इसी । जिसी इंद्रह घरि रिद्धि ॥</p>
<p>&lsquo;The wealth of Kanha was like the affluence in the house ofIndra&rsquo; where <strong>इंद्रह</strong> is gen. sing. The <strong>ह</strong> of <strong>इत्थह</strong>, for instance, isreduced to <strong>अ</strong>, the aspirate being lost, as is often the case in thevernaculars, and we have <strong>हत्था</strong>or <strong>हाता</strong>. Similarly <strong>अं</strong>of the pl.combines with the preceding <strong>अ</strong>into <strong>आं</strong>and we have <strong>हातां</strong>.</p>
<p>The second form <strong>ई</strong> and <strong>ईं</strong> is derived from the gen. of nouns in<strong>इ</strong> or <strong>ई</strong> masc. or fem. Thus <strong>केलीइ</strong> is the Pr. gen. sing. from whichwe have <strong>केली</strong>the sing. obl., and <strong>केलिणं</strong>pl., the <strong>णं</strong> of which isreduced to <strong>अं</strong> as in the other case, and we have <strong>केलीअं, -अ</strong>, as provedin the last lecture, generally goes out in the vernaculars, after along vowel even when medial, and after a short dissimilar vowelwhen final, and hence we have ff the obl. pl. Or the sing. <strong>ई</strong>may be derived from another fem, gen. termination अ or the masc.<strong>अ</strong> for <strong>ह</strong>, which, before the preceding short <strong>इ</strong>, goes out since it isfinal, as <strong>कविह-कविअ-कवी</strong>.</p>
<p>The fourth form <strong>उ</strong>and <strong>ऊ</strong> is similarly derived from masc. andfem. nouns in <strong>ऊ</strong>or <strong>ऊ</strong>; as <strong>साहुस्स-साहुइ-साहुअ-साहू</strong> obl. M., thoughwe have not this word in this form in M. where it is <strong>श्वश्रू-सरसू सस्सुअ</strong>gen <strong>सामू</strong>, obl. sing. M.; <strong>सस्मूणं-सस्मूअं-सामूं</strong> obl.pl. M.</p>
<p>The fifth form in <strong>ए</strong> sing, and <strong>आं</strong>pl. is from fem. nouns in <strong>आ</strong>;Pr. <strong>जिब्भाइ</strong> or <strong>जिब्भाए-जिभे</strong>M. obl. sing. and <strong>जिम्भाणं-जिब्भाअं-जिभां</strong>M.obl. pl.</p>
<p>The third form <strong>ई</strong> sing. and <strong>आं</strong>pl. is a mixture of the secondand the fifth and the nouns that take it form their oblique onthe type of the fifth in the Goan. and Māl.</p>
<p><strong>ANALYSIS OF THE SINDHI OBLIQUE FORMS</strong></p>
<p>The Sindhi in its <strong>अ</strong>of the sing. of its first and second forms,shortens the <strong>आ</strong>of the M., i. e. the two <strong>अ</strong> form one strong <strong>अ</strong>; whilein its third or fourth, it either dispenses with the special obliqueor this is the same as the nom., as in the case of the M. <strong>इत्ति, भुई, सामू</strong>etc. The Sindhi plural oblique has one form <strong>आं</strong>, like thecorresponding M. <strong>एं</strong>, which appears to be from the Apbhr. <strong>हें</strong> of thegen. pl. of nouns in short <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>उ</strong> given by Kramādīśvara and therest presents the gen. <strong>न</strong> in an uncorrupted form. Of these <strong>उनि</strong>which all fem. nouns and one set of masc, nouns take appears tobe a combination of the fem. nom. pl. <strong>उ</strong> and the gen. <strong>नि</strong>; i. e. tothe nom. pl. of these nouns the obl. was added instead of tothe original base.</p>
<p><strong>THE HINDI AND THE PUNJABI OBLIQUE FORMS</strong></p>
<p>The P. pl. <strong>आं</strong>is the same as the M. and the H. <strong>ओं</strong>is fromthe Apbhr. <strong>हुं</strong>of nouns in <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>उ</strong>. Or it may be explained as acombination of the fem. <strong>ओं</strong>with the nasal of the gen, as theSindhi <strong>उनि</strong>is.</p>
<p>The Braj <strong>न</strong> also presents the gen. termination in an unchangedform.</p>
<p>This then is the way in which the oblique forms are derived,but as usual the law of false analogy and simplication has beenin operation even here and thus while the M. represents them ina pristine condition, the Sindhi has reduced them to fewer typesand the P. and H. and perhaps the G. to one and the B. and O.have dropped them altogether.</p>
<p>It now remains to show why nouns with various endingsinflect the obl. in M. and S. according to the same type. I havealready shown that the oblique terminations <strong>आ</strong> and <strong>आं</strong> properlybelong to nouns in <strong>अ</strong>. Sindhi mase. nouns in <strong>उ</strong> are, as observed on a former occasion, really nouns in <strong>अ, उ</strong>being the nom. singtermination, whence they take in the sing, <strong>आ</strong>shortened to <strong>अ</strong>.Nouns in <strong>आ</strong> Mar, and P. and in <strong>ओ</strong>S. also form their obliqueaccording to this type. But the sing, base ends in <strong>या</strong>or <strong>ए</strong> in M.and <strong>ए</strong> in others. These nouns, as shown in the last but onelecture, were originally nouns augmented by the addition of <strong>क</strong>.Thus Skr. <strong>घोटक</strong> isPr. <strong>घोडअ</strong> or <strong>घोडय</strong>, since <strong>अ</strong> is pronounced <strong>य</strong>, andwith <strong>ह</strong> or <strong>अ</strong> the gen. termination becomes <strong>घोडय + अ = घोडया</strong>, whichby hasty pronunciation becomes <strong>घोड्या</strong>; but in the older M. poetswe find <strong>घोडया</strong>also. Now in the state of <strong>घोडय</strong>it may become, asI have once stated, <strong>घोडे</strong>, is <strong>कयल</strong>for <strong>कदल</strong> becomes <strong>केल</strong> or <strong>केल</strong>, andafter a long vowel the following <strong>अ</strong> is elided, whence we havethe form of the M. dialects and S. and P. and H. Similarly wehave the plural <strong>घोड्यां</strong>.</p>
<p>Neuter nouns in <strong>एं</strong> are also nouns with a final <strong>क</strong>, as has beenshown, hence their oblique is like that of the Masc. nouns in <strong>आ.कदलकम्-कयलअं-केलें</strong> and <strong>केलय + अ</strong> of the gen. <strong>= केलया-केल्या</strong>.Similarly <strong>सोनें = सुवण्णअ =सुवर्णक</strong> etc.</p>
<p>Masc. nouns in <strong>ई</strong> also take this form. If they do so, theymust be nouns in <strong>अ</strong> originally and as a matter of fact we dofind some of them at least to be so. Thus <strong>न्हावी</strong> is <strong>न्हाविअ</strong> Pr., <strong>नापित</strong>Sk wherefore we have <strong>न्हाविज + आ = न्हाव्या; ताम्बोलिक</strong> is Pr.<strong>तम्बोलिभ</strong> and with the gen. <strong>ह</strong> or <strong>अ</strong> the obl.<strong>ताम्बोल्या; वाणिज</strong> Pr, <strong>वाणिअ</strong>and with for our obl. etc. Similarly is , wherewith gen. <strong>अ</strong>we have M. <strong>मोत्या पाणी</strong> is <strong>पानीअ</strong> and thence <strong>पाण्या</strong>.S. <strong>हारी</strong> is Skr. <strong>हालिक</strong>, Pr. <strong>हालिअ</strong>which is the S. obl. form, since theeffect of two <strong>अ</strong>coming together is in this language to preventthe usual elision and form one strong <strong>अ</strong>.</p>
<p>We thus see that most Mar. and S, masc. nouns in <strong>ई</strong> and M. neuternouns <strong>ई</strong> are derived from Pr. nouns having a final <strong>म</strong>representingSkr. <strong>क</strong> or any other syllable. In the same way Skr. <strong>लडुक</strong>is Pr.<strong>लडुभ</strong> thence <strong>लाडुअ</strong>and with the gen, <strong>अ</strong> for <strong>ह लाडवा</strong> the M. obl.;so also M. <strong>भाउ</strong>must be Pr. <strong>भाउअ</strong>., Skr. <strong>भ्रातृक</strong>; M. <strong>नातु</strong>, Pr. <strong>नत्तुभ</strong>,</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>नप्तृक</strong>, in order that with the gen. <strong>अ</strong> they may yield. <strong>भावा</strong>or<strong>नातवा</strong> Neuter <strong>गलुं</strong>is <strong>गडुअ</strong>, Skr. <strong>गडुक</strong> and hence by the combinationof <strong>गहुअ + अ</strong> we have <strong>गडवा</strong>or <strong>गलवा</strong>. S<strong>माण्हू</strong> must have been <strong>मानुह</strong>from <strong>मानुष</strong>and the aspiration being transferred to <strong>न</strong> we have<strong>माण्हुअ</strong>which is the obl. form. Thus then those M. and S. masc.nouns in <strong>उ</strong> and M. neuter nouns in <strong>ऊं</strong> which take this obliqueform were Pr. nouns in <strong>अ</strong>representing a Skr. syllable ending in<strong>व</strong>, mostly <strong>क</strong>. Now these vernacular nouns in <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>ई</strong>and <strong>व</strong> or <strong>ऊ</strong>which in Skr. bave not a syllable like <strong>त</strong>or <strong>क</strong> at the end musthave the <strong>क</strong> attached to them in the Pr. and Apbhr., as we haveseen it was, to nouns in <strong>अ</strong> which on that account have becomenouns in <strong>ओ</strong>or <strong>आ</strong>in the modern languages.</p>
<p>Those fem. nouns in <strong>अ</strong> that have <strong>ई</strong> or <strong>ईं</strong> for their Sāmānyarūpaterminations must be Skr, and Pr. nouns in <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>ई</strong>as they are ass matter of fact; as <strong>केल</strong> is Pr. <strong>केली</strong> or <strong>कयली</strong>, Skr <strong>कदली भिंत</strong> is Pr.and Skr, <strong>भित्ति</strong>; <strong>पारध,<strong>Skr. <strong>पापर्द्धि</strong>, Pr. <strong>पारधी;बहिण</strong>, Skr. <strong>भगिनी</strong>, Pr. <strong>बहिणी;वांव</strong>, Skr. <strong>वापी</strong>, Pr. <strong>बावी</strong>, and a good many modern Tadbhavassuch as <strong>रीत, गत, विभूत</strong> from <strong>रीति, गति, विभूति</strong> etc. others that end in</strong>ई</strong> and take these terminations were also originally nouns in <strong>इ</strong>or <strong>ई</strong> as <strong>भुई</strong>, Skr. <strong>भूमि</strong> and others. Some masc. nouns in <strong>ई</strong> whichform their obl, in this way must also be derived from corresponding nouns in <strong>ई</strong>, as <strong>इत्ती</strong>is from the Skr. and Pr. Nom. sing. <strong>इत्ती</strong>.And modern Tatsamas in <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>ई</strong> of course can only take thisform. Similarly those nouns that form their oblique by taking<strong>ऊ</strong> and <strong>ऊं</strong>must be originally nouns in <strong>उ</strong> or <strong>ऊ</strong>. Modern Tatsamasending in these vowels also take these forms.</p>
<p>The fifth form has already been traced to the Pr. gen. of fem.nouns in <strong>आ</strong>, whence those nouns that take the form in M. musthave been originally nouns ending in that vowel. Thus <strong>जीभ</strong>,Pr. <strong>जिग्मा</strong>, Skr. <strong>जिह्वा भाक</strong>-Skr. <strong>भाषा</strong> ( mod. Tad. ); <strong>माल-माला-माला; भीक–भिक्खा-भिक्षा;नीज</strong> or<strong>नीद-निद्वा-निद्रा; सांज-संज्झा-संध्या; सेज-सेज्जा-शय्या</strong> etc.All modern fem. Tatsamas in rare inflected in this way. From the fact that fem. nouns in <strong>ई</strong> take <strong>आं</strong> forthe pl. obl. it would appear that they were originally nouns in <strong>आ</strong>.<strong>घोडी</strong> we know must have been Skr. <strong>व</strong> since the masc. is <strong>घोटक</strong>.Its gen. pl. in Pr, therefore was <strong>घोडिआअं</strong>, whence we have <strong>घोड्यां</strong>,but the sing. obl. <strong>घोडी</strong>which is the same as the nominative is not</p>
<p>formed, as it should be, according to our theory. But, as observedbefore, the Goan and Māl. have faithfully preserved the oldtradition here though the ordinary M. has lost it and in thisinstance applies the case terminations to the Nom. and not tospecial obl. form as the other languages do to a much greaterextent. The Goan, and Māl. Sāmānyarūpaof <strong>घोडी</strong>is <strong>घोड्ये</strong> fromPr. gen. <strong>घोडिआइ</strong>, the last two vowels combining into <strong>ए</strong> and the <strong>इ</strong>and <strong>ए</strong> into <strong>ये</strong>. Other instances are <strong>साडी</strong>, Skr. <strong>शाटिका, बाडी-वाटिका,नली-नलिफा, कली कलिका, माशी-मक्षिका, माती-मृतिका, मुदी-मुद्रिका,</strong> the sing. obl of which in the Goan. and Māl. are , <strong>साड्ये, वाड्ये, नल्ये</strong>etc.Similarly those fem. nouns that take this type of the obl. musthave been nouns in आrepresenting such a syllable as <strong>का</strong>.Thus M. <strong>बालू</strong> is Pr. <strong>बालुआ</strong>, Skr <strong>बालुका</strong>, and <strong>बालुआ</strong> with the <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>ए</strong>of the Gen. sing. is <strong>वालवे</strong>and with <strong>आं</strong>of the pl. <strong>वालवांस</strong>; also <strong>जलू-जलोआ</strong>or <strong>जलुआ-जलौका; ऊ</strong> a louse Skr. <strong>यूका, सासू-श्वश्रुका</strong>. The lastand also <strong>वालू</strong>have also the obl. form in <strong>ऊ</strong> and <strong>ऊं</strong>. Several othernouns also, masc, and fem, endingin <strong>ई</strong>and <strong>ऊ</strong>, have the <strong>ई</strong>and <strong>ऊ</strong>form of the obl. as well as the <strong>आ</strong>or <strong>ए</strong>and <strong>आं</strong>form. This arises fromthe practice of adding <strong>क</strong> or <strong>का</strong>optionally in the Pr. just as thereare some nouns which, as we have seen, end both in <strong>अ</strong>and <strong>आ</strong>.</p>
<p>In this way the several types of the M. sāmānyarūpa arosefrom different sets of Pr. nouns, but it is not meant that all thosenouns that in the present state of the languages take one or otherof those types were derived from the corresponding Prakrit set.After the forms came into use, words-from foreign languages forinstance —were introduced which cannot of course be traced to thePrakrit and those were assigned to some one form according tothe gender in the first place and then to fancy or accident; thereis no reason why <strong>दौलत</strong> should be <strong>दौलती</strong>for its oblique and not<strong>दौलते</strong> or <strong>फौज फौजे</strong>and not <strong>फौजी</strong>; the tradition with regard to somePr. nouns also must have been forgotten and then they also havebeen in the condition of these foreign nouns and must have beentreated likewise; and to a certain extent oblivion is the reason whywe have two forms in the case of some nouns and no other.</p>
<p>This then is clearly the origin of the oblique forms; and allthe facts, especially in the Marathi language, harmonize socompletely with it that there can be no doubt whatever as to itstruth. And no other case than the gen. would have served the</p>
<p>purpose of reconstruction. When a language is in an early stage of growth and case forms such as the loc. sing. are made up byJoining two words such as <strong>देव</strong> &lsquo;a shining being&rsquo; and <strong>इ</strong> &rsquo;this&rdquo; or &ldquo;here&rdquo;,imagination is wanted to connect the &lsquo;hore&rsquo; or &rsquo;this&rsquo; with the shiningbeing, i. e. in the place of the shining being. But when alanguage has got the means of expressing the relation denoted by<em>of</em>, it is necessary that it should be used in connection with thenew post-position; otherwise the sense would be incomplete.And thus in Skr., Pr. and the modern languages all such post-positions are appended to the gen. case. The gen. forms of nounsas they were in the Prakrits and the Apabhraṃśa have descendedto the Marathi only somewhat phonetically altered, while theprincipal change that the nouns or crude forms have undergoneis the loss of final <strong>अ</strong>or <strong>आ</strong>answering to such a Skr. syllable as <strong>त, क</strong>or <strong>का</strong> when preceded by a dissimilar vowel, i e. <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>उ</strong>; while theother languages have, in most instances, taken this mutilatedcrude or nom. form as the base for all oblique cases, the M.confines it to its own place and uses the old gen. everywhere andwithout exception if we take the minor dialects also into consideration. The other languages have of course, as has been shown,preserved this gen. in some cases and of them all the S. in thelargest number of instances. Some such as the H. and P. havegeneralized the pl. form of one set of nouns and use it for all.The M. cases are thus more difficult to the learner than those of theother languages, but that is a matter with which we are notconcerned here.</p>
<p><strong>NEW TERMINATIONS IN THE VERNACULARS</strong></p>
<p>We will now proceed to the consideration of the new terminations. These have not necessarily sprung up from independentwords. We have seen that the old terminations such as the न ofthe instr. have been detached and constituted into post-positions.But the most common method the vernaculars have resorted tois to attach the case forms of certain words to the gen. of thenouns. The acc. and dat. terminations in the various dialectsare these : H. <strong>तईं, कों</strong>, Braj. <strong>कौं</strong>‚ B. <strong>के, ते</strong>,O. व, S. <strong>खे, ते</strong>,P. <strong>नूं,ताईं</strong>G. <strong>ने</strong>,M. <strong>स, ला</strong>, and <strong>तें</strong> used in poetry. Of these <strong>स</strong> has been discussed.The Māl, and Goan, have <strong>कां</strong>for pronours and the former <strong>क</strong> for</p>
<p>nouns and the latter <strong>कनां</strong>. Khāndeśīhas <strong>ले</strong>, P. has <strong>ताईं</strong> also for <strong>नू</strong>,Old Bengali has also a dative in <strong>रे</strong>.</p>
<p>बैदर्मीरे हंस कहेमनुष्यवचने</p>
<p>Mah. Nalop. I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The swan said to Vaidarbhīwith human speech.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>THE ORIGIN OFE IN THE VERNACULAR TERMINATIONS</strong></p>
<p>Here we see that a good many languages have the terminationwith an initial <strong>क</strong>. What is its origin? Dr. Caldwell traces it to theDravidian <strong>कु</strong>. But in our whole investigation we have not yetmet a Dravidian influence in the grammar of our languages. Dr.Trump derives the S. <strong>खे</strong> and B. <strong>के</strong> from <strong>कृते</strong>. The last may notunlikely have been derived from it, but the aspiration of the S.<strong>खे</strong> is not accounted for. Trump attributes it to the vowel <strong>ऋ</strong>; butwe have seen that in the old Pr. this goes out, leaving nothingbut <strong>अ, इ</strong> or <strong>उ</strong>, i. e, the consonantal portion of it, which is subordinated to the vowel portion, leaves no trace. There is no otherinstance in which <strong>ऋ</strong> is known to exert such an influence. TheHindi <strong>कौं</strong> he also derives from <strong>कृत</strong> and not <strong>कृते</strong>. But here theAnusvāra is not accounted for and regarded as inorganic. Besides,B Mr. Beames remarks, <strong>कृत</strong> is not a word likely to yield thesense of a dative. It is never used in Skr. or Pr. as equivalent to<strong>कृते</strong>.</p>
<p>To be able to arrive at the probable or correct etymology ofany of these terminations it is necessary to collect and compareany more ancient forms of it that may possibly be found. Nowthere are such forms in the case of the H. <strong>कों</strong>and the Braj <strong>कौं</strong>.The old H. poets often use <strong>कहं, कहुं</strong> and even <strong>काहुं</strong>; for instance inTulsidās&rsquo;s Rāmāyaṇa we have:—</p>
<p>भानु कृशानु सर्व रस खाहीं। तिन कहंमंद कहत कोड नाहीं ॥</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sun and fire swallow all liquids. Nobody calls themstupid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>काम जारि रतिकहंवर दीन्हा । कृपासिंधु यह अतिभल कीन्हा ॥</p>
<p>&lsquo;He burned Kāma but gave a boon to Rati; this was anexcellent act done by the ocean of mercy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>कपिन्हसहित विप्रन कहुं दान विविध विधि दीन्हा॥</p>
<p>&lsquo;He gave various gifts to the monkeys and the Brahmans.&rsquo;</p>
<p>आसन उचित दये सबकाहू। कहौंकहामुख एक उच्छाहू॥</p>
<p>&lsquo;Proper seats were given to all; my mouth is one, how shall Irelate the festivities?&rsquo;</p>
<p>कैकई कहुंपुनि मिले मनकर छोभ न जाइ।</p>
<p>&lsquo;Met Kaikayīagain, but the agitatiton of the heart did notsubside !&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now we have seen that often in the modern languages the <strong>ह</strong> ofolder words is dropped; and thus from <strong>कहुं</strong>we have <strong>कउं</strong> and then<strong>को</strong>or <strong>कौं</strong> by the usual rule that we have noticed in going over thevowel changes. From <strong>कहं</strong> the Mālvaṇīand Goan. <strong>कां</strong>is derived.The <strong>कहं</strong> and <strong>कहुं</strong> are also traced to <strong>कृत</strong> by Dr. Trump. But Mr.Beames derives them from <strong>कक्ष</strong> &lsquo;arm-pit, side&rsquo;, which becomes<strong>काख</strong> and then <strong>काह</strong>, and the anusvāra he traces to the accusativeand thus supposes <strong>कक्षं</strong>to be the original of <strong>कौं</strong>. <strong>कक्ष</strong> is preserved inthe modern languages in the form of <strong>काख</strong>, but the further changeof <strong>ख</strong> to <strong>इ</strong> in the suffix he accounts for by considering it to be alater Tadbhava. And corresponding to these two forms he says wehave the two forms of <strong>स्थान</strong>in the ordinary word <strong>थान</strong>H. &lsquo;a place&rsquo;and in the <strong>ह</strong>of <strong>कहां, जहां</strong>. I have no hesitation in saying that Mr.Beames is altogether wrong in deriving <strong>कहां, जहां</strong> etc., and furtheron <strong>तईं</strong> or <strong>ताई</strong> from <strong>किंस्थान, यत्स्थान, तत्स्थान</strong> etc. Such new expressions in the face of the many good old words existing in Skr. and Pr. couldnot have come in ordinary vernacular use. The B. <strong>एथाय, ओथाय, कोथाय</strong>etc., which have led Mr. Beames to this etymology aremanifestly new combinations of <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>थाय</strong>. <strong>ओ</strong> and <strong>थाय, को</strong> and <strong>थाय</strong>like the barbarous compounds <strong>एखानें, सेखानें</strong> of Skr. and foreignwords derived by the Bengali in its poverty of the old Tadbhavaelement. Neither should we derive the M. <strong>एथ</strong>and later <strong>एथें</strong>from<strong>एतत्स्थान</strong> in the face of the Pr. <strong>एत्थ</strong>from Skr. <strong>अत्र</strong> or <strong>इत्र</strong> which we findeverywhere in Pr. works. Now as regards <strong>काख</strong>, in addition to theobjection which Mr. Beames has not succeeded in answering, it isto be observed that the word is found nowhere used in that sensein old H., G. or M. literature and, that it might be the original ofthe dat, case-affix in nearly all the languages, it is necessary thatit should have been used extensively in Skr. or Pr. or in the oldliterature of the modern languages.</p>
<p>One chief and important source of the modern case affixes hasbeen overlooked by all those who have written on varnacularphilology. The words most fitted to express case relations are thepronouns and the old Aryan case endings have properly beentraced by comparative philologists to pronominal roots. Even inthe vernacular speech of the day we use pronominal expressions.when a simply general sense is wanted as <strong>मी गोविंदाचे एथें गेलों होतों</strong>&lsquo;I went to (lit.) the here of Govinda, i. e. to Govinda&rsquo;s place; <strong>मैनें आपके यहां सेवकको भेजा था</strong>&lsquo;I sent my servant to your here&rsquo;, i. e. yourplace; <strong>हुं मुरलीधरने तहां गयो हतो</strong>&lsquo;I went to Murlidhar&rsquo;s there&rsquo; i. e.,place. These <strong>एथें, यहां</strong>and <strong>तहां</strong>are really remnants of the old Pr.locatives of <strong>इदम्</strong> (in the forms <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>अ</strong> ) and तत्. If these weremore extensively used, they would in the course of time becometerminations, and <strong>तईे</strong>for <strong>तहिं</strong>, the Pr. Apbhr. loc. of <strong>तद</strong>, has becomea termination in H. as <strong>मैं शहरके तईं गया</strong>&lsquo;I went to the there of thetown&rsquo;; <strong>उसके तईं</strong> &rsquo;to him. or for him&rsquo;. In the Apabhraṁśa,according to Hemacandro, <strong>केहिं</strong>and <strong>तेहिं</strong>were used as postpositionsin the sense of &lsquo;for&rsquo; &lsquo;on account of as in the verse formerly given<strong>हउं झिज्जउं तउ केहिं पिअ</strong> &amp;c. These, as they are,appear likeinstrumental plurals of the pronouns <strong>किम्</strong> and <strong>तद्</strong> and they may beso really. The instr. and abl. may pass into the dat, and this intoeither. For, of the several relations denoted by the first twocases one is that between a cause and its effect or reason andconclusion, and a confusion between an antecedent cause orreason and the final cause or purpose is natural. This last isgenerally indicated by the dat. case. Even the English preposition&rsquo;for&rsquo; has these two senses. In the sentence, &lsquo;I bought the book formy own use, it signifies the purposes and in such a one as &lsquo;for this, let people beware&rsquo; it denotes an antecedent reason. In thesame way <strong>साठीं</strong> or <strong>करितां</strong> are in M. used in both these senses. In<strong>त्याच्यासाठीं मी इतका श्रम केला</strong>&lsquo;I took so much trouble for him&rsquo; it hasa dative sense and in <strong>ह्यासाठीं अशी गोष्ट कधीं करू नये</strong>&lsquo;for this, such athing should never be done&rsquo; it has an ablative sense. This factmust be borne in mind as we go on discussing the origin of thecase forms. <strong>केहिं</strong> and <strong>तेहिं</strong> are therefore may be instrumentals.</p>
<p>This explanation is supported by the fact that another Apbhr.post-position in the sense of &lsquo;for&rsquo; or &lsquo;on account of given byHemacandra is <strong>तणेण</strong>which is evidently the sing. instr. of <strong>तण</strong>,</p>
<p>a possessive suffix to be hereafter mentioned. The pl. case formsmay become adverbs or postpositions as the Skr. <strong>शनैः</strong>&rsquo; slowly&rsquo; ,<strong>नीचैः</strong> and <strong>उच्चैः</strong>&rsquo;low&rsquo; and &lsquo;high&rsquo; which must originally have beeninstr. plurals. Another explanation of these forms is that theyare derived from the Pr. gen. plurals <strong>केसिं</strong>and <strong>तेसिं</strong>, the <strong>स</strong> beingchanged to <strong>ह</strong>. The gen. has all along been used in the sense ofthe dat. In Skr. itself it is often so and in the Pr. it drove outthe old dat. altogether and was used instead. In old M. poetrythe obl. form, which we have traced to the Pr. gen., is often usedfor this case or, since in the Apabhr. nouns the termination <strong>हिं</strong>was used for loc. pl. also, the forms <strong>केहिं</strong> and <strong>तेहिं</strong>are not unlikelyto be referred to that case. The loc. is another case which canreadily be adapted to express a dat. acc. sense. Tulsidāsafrequently adds <strong>हिं</strong>to nouns to form this case. Thus—</p>
<p>रुद्रहिं देखि मदन भयमाना।</p>
<p>&lsquo;The god of love was afraid when he saw Rudra.&rsquo;</p>
<p>रामहिं सौपिय जानकी नाइ कमल पदमाथ।<br>
सुत कहुंराज समर्पि वन जाइ मजिथरघुनाथ॥</p>
<p>&lsquo;Having restored Jānakīto Rāmaand bowing your head athis lotus feet and giving the kingdom to your son, go to a forestand adore Raghunātha.&quot;</p>
<p>That these several cases may pass into the dat. acc. is alsoproved by the fact that the forms of the Apabhraṃśa gerund ofinfinitive of purpose, which has essentially a dative sense, arederived from them. Thus Hamacandra gives these terminationsof the infinitive: <strong>एवम्</strong>as in <strong>देवम्</strong> &lsquo;for giving&rsquo; which is an acc. of the pot. part. <strong>देअव्वम्, अण</strong> as in <strong>करण</strong> &lsquo;for doing&rsquo; in which thecase termination is dropped, <strong>अणइम्</strong> so as in <strong>भुंजणइं</strong>&lsquo;for breaking&rsquo;which is the gen. pl of <strong>भञ्जन</strong>and <strong>अणहिं</strong> as in <strong>भुंजणहिं</strong>&lsquo;for enjoying&rsquo;which is loc, sing, or pl. of <strong>भुञ्जण</strong> Pr. for Skr. <strong>भोजन</strong>. Thus then in the Apabhraṃśa pronominal forms had begun to be used as postpositions for expressing case relations. It is not unreasonable,therefore, to expect that we should find traces of the practice inour modern case forms and the forms themselves that were usedin that dialect.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Apabhraṃśa dat. postposition <strong>केहिं</strong>survives in the S. <strong>खे</strong>; theaspiration is thrown on <strong>के</strong> so as to make it <strong>खे</strong> and the followingvowel is dropped. We have already seen several instances ofthis process, but I will add one or two more to the point. The Pr.<strong>कहिं</strong> &lsquo;where&rsquo; is in the Goan. and Māl. <strong>खंय, तहिं</strong>&rsquo;there&rsquo; <strong>थंय, अहिं</strong> &lsquo;here<strong>हंय</strong>. Often the old <strong>ह</strong> is dropped in the modern dialects and thuswe have from <strong>केहिं</strong> the B.<strong>के</strong>. The old H. termination <strong>कहं</strong> is the Pr.<strong>कहिं</strong> &lsquo;where,&rsquo; so that originally the sense of <strong>राम कहं</strong> was Rāma&rsquo;ssomewhere. &lsquo;&lsquo;Send to Räma&rsquo;s somewhere and give it to Rāma&rsquo;ssomewhere came afterwards to mean send it to Räms and&quot;give it to Rāma. The <strong>इ</strong> of the loc. <strong>कर्हि</strong> is here dropped as ismostly the case in the pronominal locatives which in the modernlanguages as well as the Prakrit have become adverbs of place;such are <strong>जहिं</strong>relative &lsquo;where,&rsquo;<strong>तर्हि</strong>&rsquo;their,&rsquo; <strong>अहिं</strong> &lsquo;here&rsquo; and <strong>कहिं</strong>&lsquo;where&rsquo;(interrogative) which have become <strong>जहां तहां, यहां</strong> and कहांand in Tulsidās <strong>जहं, तहं</strong> and <strong>कहं</strong>. Sometimes the <strong>इ</strong> is preserved inthe current speech as in <strong>कहां</strong>or <strong>कहींं</strong> H., <strong>अही, यहां</strong> G. The other dat.termination <strong>कहुं</strong>, the origin <strong>कौं</strong> of <strong>कों</strong>, is either the ablative orgenitive form of <strong>किम्</strong>since <strong>हुं</strong> was in Apabhr. the termination of both these cases. The O. <strong>कुं</strong> is another form of this <strong>कहुं</strong>. The M.<strong>तें</strong> is from the Apabhr. <strong>तहिं</strong>as <strong>के</strong> from कोहिं. The B. has this affixalso used principally in the case of inanimate creatures.</p>
<p>धुयांते गन्ध आछे ओ ताहाते चक्षुते वेदना होय ।</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is smell to smoke and from that harm to the eye results.&rsquo;</p>
<p>तहाते सिंह कहिल।</p>
<p>&lsquo;The lion said to him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The S. has it also.</p>
<p>सोहल्यो शिकारते &rsquo; He went for hunting.&rsquo; <strong>विओ मुस फरिअते</strong> &lsquo;wenton a travel&rsquo;</p>
<p>The P. <strong>ताइ</strong> like the H. <strong>तईं</strong> is from <strong>तहिं</strong> &rsquo;there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The M. <strong>ला</strong>is to be connected with similar terminations in itsown dialects and the other languages. Khāndeśi has. <strong>ले</strong>. H.possesses a post-position <strong>लाय</strong>or <strong>लिये</strong>, P. <strong>लई</strong>, S. <strong>लाइ</strong>all in the senseof &lsquo;for,&rsquo; Braj. <strong>लौं</strong>or <strong>लों</strong> &lsquo;up to&rsquo;. The old H. poets have also <strong>लै</strong> or<strong>लाई</strong> in the sense of the M. <strong>लां</strong>i. e. &rsquo;to&rsquo; or&rsquo; at&rsquo;: <strong>वारंहिं वार पांवलै पदहीं</strong>again and again they fall at her feet;&rsquo; <strong>हरसि उठाय लिये उरलाई</strong></p>
<p>joyfully he arose and pressed him to his bosom.&lsquo;Then thereare other forms in all the languages from <strong>लग.</strong> Goan has <strong>लागीं</strong>inthe sense of &rsquo;to&rsquo; or &lsquo;with,&rsquo; as <strong>माझे लागीं उलप</strong> &lsquo;speak to or withme.&rsquo; H. <strong>लग</strong> &lsquo;up to &lsquo;; P. <strong>लग</strong>&rsquo; near, to&rsquo;; <strong>लागों</strong> &lsquo;from contact with;&rsquo; S. <strong>लगी-लगे</strong> &lsquo;on account of;&rsquo; B. <strong>लागिं-लागिया-लागे</strong> &lsquo;for, on accountof.&rsquo; In G. and H. poetry <strong>लागीं, लगी</strong>or <strong>लागि</strong> are used in these sensesand M. has <strong>लागून</strong> or <strong>लागुनि</strong> also.</p>
<p>All these forms are derived from the old Skr. root <strong>लग</strong>to adhereor stick. The past pass. part, of this is <strong>लग्न</strong>, Pr. <strong>लग्न</strong>. This, likemany similar participles, is made the base of verbal forms inPr. and we have <strong>लग्गइ = लग्नो भवति</strong> &lsquo;adheres, sticks.’ From thiswe have <strong>लागणें-वुं-व</strong>M. G. B. by the usual rules, but S. generallyand H. sometimes do not lengthen the preceding vowel when oneof the two consonants is dropped and we have <strong>लगणु</strong>and <strong>लगना</strong>,though <strong>लागना</strong> is also used in the latter. There is another form<strong>लागयति</strong> of this root which is made up according to the 10thConjugation or which is properly the causal and, when thetermination is dropped as is often the case, we have <strong>लागई</strong>and bythe elision of <strong>ग्</strong> the root becomes <strong>लाअ</strong>and thence, by the usualintroduction of <strong>य</strong>or <strong>व, लाय</strong> or <strong>लाव</strong>.Now <strong>लायणा</strong> exists in the Gosn.and <strong>लाइणु</strong> in the S. while M. has <strong>लावणें</strong>.These mean &rsquo;to make toadhere,&lsquo;&lsquo;apply,’ &lsquo;bring in contact.&lsquo;From <strong>लागणे</strong>and <strong>लायणा</strong> or <strong>लावणें</strong>all the forms we have above noticedhave originated. <strong>लाई, लै, लागी,</strong> <strong>लागिया</strong>are absolutives as also M. <strong>लागोनि</strong>,while the otherM. form <strong>लागीं</strong>is the loc. sing. of the noun <strong>लाग</strong> &lsquo;contact&rsquo; or &rsquo;nearness.&lsquo;The Braj. <strong>लौं</strong> must be from the oldApabhr. abso., <strong>लाउं</strong> of <strong>लाअ</strong>.. The M. dat. <strong>ला</strong>must be from such a form as <strong>लाउं</strong>&lsquo;havingapplied&rsquo; or &lsquo;for applying, &lsquo;since the final <strong>उ</strong>of terminations isdropped in this language as in <strong>जिभा</strong> &rsquo;tongues&rsquo; from <strong>जिभाउ</strong>.</p>
<p>The dative pl. termination <strong>नां</strong> represents an euphonic changeof <strong>ला</strong>necessitated by the preceding anusvāra. Instances of thischange of <strong>ल</strong> to have been given in a previous lecture. Cit. hasboth <strong>ना</strong> and <strong>न्ला</strong>. This <strong>ना</strong>is by some traced to the <strong>णं</strong>of the Pr. gen.pl. as <strong>स</strong> to the <strong>स्स</strong> of the gen. sing. The Cit. however has<strong>ना</strong> or <strong>न्ला</strong>in the pl. while <strong>ला</strong>alone is the sing. termination and the samenessof the sing, and pl. terminations is the great peculiarity of themodern dialect, whence the Cit. <strong>ना</strong>is a form of <strong>ला</strong>and if so, thenit must be so in the standard Marathi also.</p>
<p>Mr. Beames thinks the G. <strong>ने</strong>to be originally <strong>ले</strong> and thus tobelong to the class of terminations we have just examined, the <strong>ल</strong>being changed to <strong>न</strong>. I have not satisfied with this derivation as thereis no corroborative evidence, though the change of <strong>ल</strong>to <strong>न</strong> is notimpossible or unexampled. The gen. termination <strong>नो-नी-नुं</strong>in thislanguage is derived from the old Apabhraṁśa termination <strong>तण</strong>, bythe elision of the initial <strong>त</strong>, as will be hereafter shown. In thesame manner the of the acc, dat, must have been derived fromthe Apabhr. dat. post-position <strong>तणेण</strong>, which, as I have alreadyobserved, is the instr. of <strong>तण</strong>. The last <strong>ण</strong> of this is changed toan anusvära, as that of <strong>देवेण</strong>is, and, just as this becomes <strong>देवें, तणेण</strong>becomes <strong>त</strong>णेंand by the loss of <strong>त, नें</strong> . Or the process which in theApabhr. led to the formation of <strong>तणेण</strong>from <strong>तण</strong>may have beenresorted to when <strong>तण</strong>became <strong>न</strong> in the G. and thus <strong>नें</strong> is the instrumental or locative of the gen. <strong>न</strong> or its obl. form. But theanusvära of which is lost in the G. instr. would show that it isderived directly from <strong>तणेण</strong>. P. <strong>नुं</strong> may likewise be referred to aa form <strong>तणहुं</strong> the abl of <strong>तण</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>THE ORIGIN OF सIN THE VERNACULAR TERMINATIONS</strong></p>
<p>In H. the termination is applied in a dative sense to nounsgoverned by verbs denoting speaking <strong>राजाने ब्राह्मणसे कहा</strong> &lsquo;The kingspoke to the Brahman&rsquo;. It is used in the sense of the instr.,<strong>तरवारसे सीर काटा</strong> &lsquo;Hecut off his head with a sword,&rsquo; <strong>रुक्मिनीका विवाहश्रीकृष्णचन्दसे हुआ</strong> &lsquo;Rukminī&rsquo;s marriage with Śri Kṛṣṇacanda tookplace; and in that of the abl. <strong>इतना वचन ब्राह्मणके मुखसे निकला</strong>Thesewords fell from the mouth of the Brahman.&rsquo; In Braj, we have<strong>सों</strong> for <strong>से</strong>, as<strong>कबीरजी आयकैमोसों कह्यौ</strong>&lsquo;Kabir came and said tome;&rsquo; <strong>गुरुसों पूछि लेइ</strong>&lsquo;He should get it explained from the guru.&lsquo;In old H. also it is used in the form of <strong>सौं</strong>. In old M., as I havealready remarked, we have in the sense of the modern dat.acc. <strong>स</strong> as:—</p>
<p>( 1 ) सारथी शार्ङ्गधर । अर्जुनेसी ॥</p>
<p>Jñān. I-141.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Śārṅgadhara was charioteer to Arjuna.&rsquo;</p>
<p>( 2 ) पंवाड़ा तुवांकेला गंधर्वांसी ॥</p>
<p>II-10.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thou hast made a song for Gandharvas.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>( 3 )</strong> <strong>जे नेदी देवकी यशोदेसी ।<br>
ते गति दीधली पूतनेसी ॥<br>
समान देणेंअरिमित्रांसी।<br>
उदारतेसीं काय वर्णूं ॥</strong></p>
<p>RukmiṇīSvayaṃvara I-82.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He gave that salvation to Pūtanāwhich he did not gave toYaśodāand Devakī. His gifts to friends and foes are alike.How shall I describe his bounty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>(1) परी कषणेसीं म्यां झुंजावें।दे रणीं लागे पाहावें॥</p>
<p>Jñān. I-171.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is necessary in the battlefield to see with whom I shouldfight.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(2) अर्जुन असे पाहत । तो दलभार समस्त । संभ्रमेसीं ॥</p>
<p>Jñān. I-176.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Arjuna was looking at the whole force with an agitated heart.&rsquo;</p>
<p>( 3 ) आणि परलोकही अंतरेल । ऐहिकेसीं ॥</p>
<p>Jñān. II-27.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And the interest of the future life will be lost along with thoseof this&rsquo;</p>
<p>In these last three examples Thas the sense of an instrumental.We do not now use it in the sense in which it is used in the lasttwo passages and say <strong>संभ्रमानें पाहतो</strong> and <strong>ऐहिकासहित अंतरेल</strong>. In theSalsette dialect, however, <strong>सीं</strong>has these senses and also that of anabl. as that of <strong>गांवसीं आयलो</strong>&lsquo;He came from the village.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now we see that the old M. poets do not make a distinctionbetween the <strong>सीं</strong>, which corresponds to our modern <strong>स</strong>, and thatwhich even now we use in the sense of &lsquo;with&rsquo;. They all use it inother senses in which it is used in H., but not in the M. of theday. The Salsette dialect, however, agrees with the H. in its useof this affix. H. uses <strong>से</strong> in one case <strong>उससे कहा</strong> in which we use <strong>स</strong>,as <strong>त्यास सांगितलें</strong>. Some of these circumstances favour the supposition that the origin of the M. dative affix <strong>स</strong>is the same as that ofH. <strong>से</strong> and M. <strong>सीं</strong>. G. poetry has this in the form of <strong>शुं</strong> or <strong>स्यूं</strong>. as<strong>गूजरातिस्यूं मांडिसि कलह</strong> Declare war with Gujarati.&rsquo; S. has <strong>सें</strong> and <strong>सां</strong>in the sense of with.</p>
<p>All these are derived from the word <strong>सम</strong>. As is usual, is inmodern vernaculars changed to <strong>वं</strong> and thus we have <strong>सवं</strong>and withthe instr. affix <strong>ए</strong> we have the <strong>सवें</strong> of the M. poets. I have ina former lecture given a great many instances in which <strong>व</strong> is dissolved into <strong>उ</strong>, which combines with the preceding vowel into <strong>औ</strong>.We thus get the old H. <strong>सौं</strong>and the Braja <strong>सों</strong>, when <strong>अ</strong>and <strong>उ</strong> form <strong>ओ</strong>,while in G. the resulting vowel is <strong>उं</strong> in <strong>शुं</strong>. Another change of <strong>म</strong>that we have noticed is its loss of the labial element and reductionto a vowel and anusvära, wherefore the word becomes <strong>सअं</strong>or <strong>सयं</strong>.Thence the <strong>अय</strong> passes off into <strong>ए</strong>, as we have several times noticed,and so we have <strong>सें</strong>, which with the anusvāra dropped is the H. <strong>से</strong>.The <strong>य</strong> is sometimes, as we have seen, changed to <strong>ई</strong> as in <strong>राइ</strong>from <strong>राअ-राय</strong>and so we have the M. <strong>सीं</strong>. Sometimes <strong>य</strong> does not take theplace of the elided consonant and the vowels are combined,whence we have the S. <strong>सां</strong>. Now the original sense of this wordis with, but this with expresses many relations, the differencesbetween which become wider in the course of time and thus theword <strong>सम</strong> has come to signify &rsquo;to, according to, with (as an instrument) and from&rsquo;.</p>
<p>This instr. termination <strong>नें</strong> (sing.)<strong>नीं</strong>(pl.) M., <strong>ने</strong> H., <strong>नइ</strong> P. have beentraced by Mr. Beames to <strong>ले</strong> or <strong>लै</strong>, which are forms of <strong>लागिं</strong>or <strong>लइ</strong>etc. derived from the root <strong>लग</strong>. One great objection is that thisderivation does not account for the anusvära of <strong>नें</strong> or <strong>नैं</strong>. Hisargument is that the old <strong>एन</strong>of the instr. having been reduced to <strong>एं</strong>,there was no other instrumental case to furnish the <strong>न</strong> of themodern instr. <strong>नें-नीं</strong>; but in the Apabhr, according to Hemacandraboth these forms existed and the instance he gives is</p>
<p>जे महु दिण्णा दिअहडा दइएं पवसन्तेण ।<br>
ताण गणन्तिए अंगुलिउ जज्जरि आउ नहेण ॥</p>
<p>&lsquo;By counting (again and again) [the number of] days whichwere mentioned to me by my beloved when he set out on histravels [ the skin of] my fingers has worn away by the nail.&lsquo;Here <strong>दइएं, पवसन्तेण</strong> and <strong>नहेण</strong> are instances of the instrumental. Thefirst two are expressive of the agent in the passive constructionand the third of the simple instrument; so that the <strong>एण</strong>or <strong>ण</strong> of theinstrumental must have descended to the vernaculars. Again Mr.Beames says that the old H. poets do not use the instr. in <strong>नें</strong>; butthe oldest M. poet Jñāṇeśvara does use it in some cases.His</p>
<p>agent instrumental is very often that which ends in <strong>एं</strong>, butinstances of the use of <strong>नि</strong>, which is another form of <strong>नें</strong>, also occur.</p>
<p>As:—</p>
<p>कीं वारेनि जात आहे।</p>
<p>Jñān. 13-197.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or whether he is going away by the wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>दिसे वारेनि जैसे जाइल।</p>
<p>Jñān. 13-214.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Appears as if it will go away by the wind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>मुकेनि घेतले मौन जैसे।</p>
<p>Jñān. 13-280.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the dumb may be said to have assumed silence deliberately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>उन्हालेनि जो न तापे ।<br>
हिमवंति न कांपे ॥<br>
कायसेनही न वासि पे ।पातलेया ॥</p>
<p>Jñān. 13-347.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is not oppressed by heat or does not shiver by cold and isnot terrified by anything that takes place.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here are instances of the instr. both indicative of the agentand of the simple instrument, but the termination is <strong>नि</strong> insteadof <strong>नें</strong>. Besides these there are instances of the instrumental in <strong>णें</strong>of pronouns as <strong>येणें मानें</strong>Jñān. 13-200 &lsquo;By this standard,&rsquo; <strong>जेणें, तोवें</strong>13-244 &lsquo;By which satisfaction&rsquo;, <strong>तेणें प्रसादें</strong>18-1147 &lsquo;By that grace.&lsquo;Now I have stated my view in the last lecture that <strong>नें</strong> is a doubleinstrumental, the first part being <strong>न</strong> of the old instrumental in <strong>एन</strong>or <strong>एण,</strong> and the second part <strong>एं</strong>, to which that <strong>एण</strong>is reduced. Nowinstead of <strong>एं</strong>, the instr. <strong>इं</strong>is added here. The instr. <strong>इं</strong> represents the<strong>इण</strong> of the Apabhr. instr. in <strong>इण</strong>, which we have in such forms as<strong>पुत्ति</strong>ण mentioned by Pischel. Hindi poets as a rule indicate theagent instrumental by the oblique form, but Sūrdās uses the formending in <strong>नि</strong> or <strong>नें</strong> also.</p>
<p>कान्ह को गिरि गोवर्धनतें और देव नहिं दूजा।<br>
गोपनि सत्य मानि यह लींनी बडो देव गिरिराज॥</p>
<p>Sursāgar, pada 12, page 252.<sup id="fnref:132"><a href="#fn:132" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">132</a></sup></p>
<p>&lsquo;Kānha said, &ldquo;There is no other God besides the mountainGovardhan.&rdquo; Taking it to be the truth the king of mountainswas regarded by the cowherds as a great God.&quot;</p>
<p>Here <strong>गोपनि</strong> is agent instrumental in <strong>नि</strong>.</p>
<p>सबनि देख्यो प्रकट मूरति सहस्रभुजा पसारि।<br>
रुचि सहित गिरि सबनि आगे कराने लैलै खाय॥</p>
<p>Sursāgar, pada 24, page 254.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The manifested form with the thousand arms stretched out wassoen by all; with taste the mountain taking hold of every thingby his hands etc.&quot;</p>
<p>Here <strong>करनि</strong>is the instrumental.</p>
<p>आहिरनिकरि अवज्ञा प्रभुकी सो फल उनकों तुरत दिखावहिं।</p>
<p>Sursāgar, pada 44, page 257.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Disrespect of the Lord has been shown by the cowherds; showto them the fruit of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>एक पुरुषने आज मोहि सपनान्तर दीनों।</p>
<p>Sursāgar, pada 29, page 255.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today a certain dream was shown me by a Being.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here <strong>पुरुषने</strong> is agent instrumental.</p>
<p>The Ablative termination in M. is <strong>हून</strong>, Māl. <strong>सून</strong>,Cit. <strong>ठीं</strong>or <strong>पाष्ठी</strong>(from <strong>पास</strong> and <strong>थीं</strong>), Sals, <strong>सिं</strong>, G. <strong>थी</strong>, S. <strong>खां-खउं-खां तो तां,</strong> P. <strong>तें-थीं-थों</strong>,H. से, Braj. <strong>ते</strong>, H. dial. <strong>र्थी</strong>, B. <strong>होइते तें.</strong> The Sindhi <strong>खां</strong>is the Pr. andApabhr, abl. <strong>कहां</strong>of <strong>किम्</strong>, the aspiration being thrown on <strong>क</strong>, as inthe case of the dat. <strong>खे</strong> and the other instances formerly given;so that the S. abl. etymologically means &lsquo;from his somewhere.&rsquo;<strong>खउं</strong> and <strong>खों</strong> are from the Ap. <strong>कहुं</strong> abl. pl. In the same way <strong>तां</strong>is theold abl. <strong>तहां</strong> and <strong>तों</strong>, the abl. pl. <strong>तहुं</strong>of <strong>तद्</strong>, in both of which theaspirate is elided but in the P. <strong>थों</strong> it is compounded with thepreceding <strong>त</strong>. The form <strong>थी थीं</strong>of the G. and P., and H. dial. andthe Cit. <strong>ठीं</strong>are derived from <strong>तहिं</strong>, the loc. sing. Pr. and Ap. of <strong>तत्</strong>with the aspiration thrown on <strong>त</strong>.</p>
<p>The differences between some of the significations of thedifferent cases are, as I have already observed, so minute thatthey frequently run into one another and when on account ofthis resemblance, one case form becomes identified with anothercase, it afterwards acquires senses more widely different from itsoriginal. Thus <strong>तें पुस्तक मला रामापाशीं मिलाले</strong> <em>i. e.</em> (lit.) &lsquo;The bookmet me in vicinity of Rāmā&rsquo;, easily passes into <strong>रामापासून मिलाले</strong>&lsquo;met me from Rāmā&rsquo;, i. e. &lsquo;got from Rāmā&rsquo;. And the B. <strong>आपने प्रभुर</strong></p>
<p><strong>काछे ताहा पाइलाम</strong> is generally considered equivalent to &lsquo;I got it fromthe master&rsquo;, though <strong>काछे</strong>is like <strong>पाशीं</strong>a loc. form meaning &lsquo;in thevicinity of. Thus the old loc. <strong>तहिं</strong>meaning &lsquo;in that&rsquo; was used asa postposition and thence came to mear &lsquo;from that.&rsquo; Or thetransition is first from the loc, to the dat., which I have spokenof, and thence to the causal abl. and afterwards to the local abl.The Braj. and P. <strong>तें</strong> is from the Apabhr. affix <strong>तेहिं</strong>(=for) mentionedbefore in which we have an instance of this passage of the dat.into the abl., as illustrated before in the M. postposition <strong>साठीं</strong>.In M., S. and B. <strong>तें</strong> has preserved the dative sense. B. has the abl.<strong>तें</strong> also, though some grammarians do not give it, but its seseis that of causal abl. or instr. as:—</p>
<p>शृङ्गेर दीर्घताते आनंदित हइल।</p>
<p>&ldquo;Became glad on account of the length of its horns.&rsquo;</p>
<p>ताहाते चक्षुते वेदना होय ।</p>
<p>&ldquo;From that there is harm to the eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of a different origin are the M. <strong>हून</strong> and <strong>सून</strong>and the B. <strong>होइते</strong>.The first <strong>हुन</strong> Mr. Beames, following Lassen, traces to the <strong>हिन्तो</strong> and<strong>सुन्तो</strong> of the Pr. from a fusion, as it is called, of both, out of whicharose <strong>हुन्तो</strong>, and, the <strong>तो</strong>being lost, the form is <strong>ब्रून</strong>. In a similarway <strong>सून</strong> may be traced to <strong>सुन्तो</strong>,though its independent existencewould make the supposed fusion a fiction. M. however has noinstance of the loss of final <strong>त</strong>and the preservation of <strong>न</strong>; but thechief objection to this derivation is the want of corroborativeevidence. It is possible, but there is nothing to make it certainor even probable. Mr. Beames quotes passages from Canda inwhich <strong>हुन्त</strong>and <strong>हुन्तो</strong> occur in the sense of &lsquo;from.&rsquo; But they maybe derived from the present participle. The B. abl. affix <strong>होइते</strong> isthe loc. of the present participle of <strong>हो</strong>, corresponding to M. <strong>होतां</strong>,which has the sense of the Skr. loc. absolute as <strong>असतां</strong>in <strong>मी करीत असतां तो गेला</strong>&lsquo;while I was doing he went away.&rsquo; In B. too thisloc. has the same sense as <strong>दिन थाकिते कर्म कर</strong>&lsquo;work while it is day.&lsquo;In H. also it is used in the same sense: <strong>द्वारपर देखते क्या है कि सिंह मरा पडा है</strong> &rsquo;looking at the door what did he find ? he found that alion was lying dead (lit. what is there,–a lion lying dead);&rsquo; <strong>भोर होतेहि उसने सखीसे कहा</strong> &lsquo;She told it to her friend immediatelyafter dawn (lit. after it had dawned).&rsquo;</p>
<p>In this sense as in that of the Skr. loc. absolute, the actiondenoted by the present participle is made the starting point ofanother action. &lsquo;My doing&rsquo; in the first instance was the starting point of his going. And herein is the germ of an ablative. In H. <strong>होते</strong>is sometimes used in this sense as <strong>मकानसे होते</strong> &lsquo;outsideof the house, from the house.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the B. <strong>वृक्षहइते फल पडित</strong>the original sense is &rsquo;the tree beingthere, &amp; fruit fell. The M. <strong>द्रून</strong> is the absolutive of <strong>हो</strong>and equivalent to <strong>होऊन</strong> having become which yields an ablative sensemore directly. The <strong>ह</strong> is sometimes dropped and the termination<strong>ऊन</strong> itself is attached in this sense to <strong>आं</strong>&lsquo;in&rsquo;, <strong>वर</strong> &lsquo;above and<strong>पास</strong> &lsquo;side &rsquo; to signify from in &lsquo;,&rsquo; from above&rsquo;, &lsquo;from the side as<strong>आंतून, वरून</strong> and <strong>पासून</strong> which are the sblative affixes used in caseswhen <strong>हून</strong> cannot be applied, and <strong>ऊन</strong> is sometimes affixed tonouns in <strong>अ</strong> directly and not to the oblique form, as <strong>घरून आला</strong>.Thus <strong>गांवाहून आला</strong>means lit. &ldquo;the village having been, he came.&lsquo;The M</p>
<p>āl. <strong>सून</strong> is the absolutive of <strong>अस</strong> instead of <strong>हो</strong>. The H. <strong>से</strong> hasbeen explained.</p>
<p>We have seen that in the course of the development of ourmodern languages the genitive which even in Skr. expressedrelation in general was used for the dative and sometimes forother cases also. The dative thus went out of use and, to expressthe relations which it indicated, various new suffixes, given andexplained above, were brought into use and the old genitive beingattenuated was felt to be too weak to express the usual genitiverelation and it was adapted to serve as the base of all obliquecases to which the newly constituted terminations were appended. The relation of possession as well as other genitive relations,such as that of a thing and the material of which it is made, had thus no special expression left for them. ln Skr. such relationsare indicated, besides the genitive case, by adjectives formed fromthe name of the possessor, material etc. by the addition of specific terminations and from these mostly the genitive terminationsin the modern languages are derived and consequently areadjectival in their nature and agree with the gender of thething possessed or made. The genitive terminations are asfollows:—</p>

<p>In the first lecture I have remarked that in the third stage ofthe development of Sanskrit the nominal style came into useinstead of the verbal style or fluent style. When the languagewas in this condition, adjectival forms expressive of possessionor other relations came into use instead of the genitive case andsuch forms, as :</p>
<p><strong>तदीयम् गृहम्</strong> &rsquo;the house belonging to him,&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>मदीयः छात्रः</strong> &rsquo;the pupil belonging to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>त्वदीया सखी</strong> &rsquo;the female friend belonging to thee,&rsquo;</p>
<p>came into use instead of <strong>तस्य गृहम्</strong> &lsquo;his home,&rsquo; <strong>मम छात्रः</strong>&lsquo;my pupil,&rsquo;<strong>तव सखी</strong> &rsquo;thy female friend.&rsquo; When the use of such adjectivesbecame general the real genitive case, so far as it expressed possession and such other relations between nouns, was driven out andadapted to express the various other relations mentioned before.Thus then we find that the case forms expressive of possessionand other relations mentioned in the vernaculars are of anadjectival character. It is, however, curious to find that in ourseven modern languages they are derived from seven differentforms in Sanskrit and Prakrit.</p>
<p>The M. <strong>चा-ची-चें</strong>must be traced to the <strong>त्य</strong>which certainindeclinables takte in Sanskrit asr or start as <strong>इहत्य</strong> or <strong>अत्रत्य</strong> &lsquo;of this place,&rsquo; <strong>तत्रत्य</strong> &lsquo;of that place,&rsquo; <strong>क्वत्य</strong> or <strong>कुत्रस्य</strong> &lsquo;of what place.&rsquo; <strong>इहत्य</strong> or <strong>अत्रत्य</strong>must by the usual rules be changed to <strong>इहच्च,एथच्च; तत्रत्य</strong> to <strong>तत्थच्च;क्वत्य</strong> or <strong>कुत्रस्य</strong> to <strong>कच्च</strong> or <strong>कुत्थच्च</strong> or <strong>कोत्थच्च. तत्थच्च</strong>is <strong>तेथचा, एत्थच्च</strong>is<strong>एथचा, कोत्थच्च</strong> is <strong>कोठचा</strong>.This <strong>च्च</strong> was generalised and graduallycame to be applied to all nouns to indicate possession and otherrelations.</p>
<p>The G. <strong>नो-नी-नुं</strong> are derived from the Sanskrit termination <strong>तन</strong>,which is applied in the sense of possession to indeclinablesexpressive of time, such as <strong>अद्यतन</strong> &lsquo;of this day, <strong>इदानींतन</strong> &lsquo;of thepresent time,&rsquo; <strong>सायंतन</strong> &lsquo;of evening time, <strong>चिरंतन</strong> &lsquo;of the olden time&rsquo;etc. This was generalised and Hemacandra gives <strong>तण</strong> as a nounexpressive of &lsquo;something related to&rsquo; or &lsquo;belonging to&rsquo; in hisgrammar of the Apbhr. dialect. In the line of the verge of</p>
<p>Premānanda<strong>बाधी विरहतणी वेदना</strong>&rsquo;the agony of separation afflictsand in the expressions previously given, such as <strong>पोतातण</strong>, and<strong>तेहतणो नहि लाधे छेह</strong> etc., this <strong>तण</strong> remains, it will be seen, unchangedand in this form it is often used in G. poetry. By the droppingof the consonant <strong>त</strong>, it is reduced to <strong>अण</strong> or <strong>अन</strong> and thence to <strong>म्</strong>,which with masc., fem., neut. terminations <strong>ओ-ई-उं</strong> becomes**नो-नी-**नं.</p>
<p>The S. <strong>जो-जी</strong> are derived from the Sanskrit possessive termination <strong>ईय</strong> applied to a great many nouns and all pronouns, as<strong>तदीय</strong> belonging to him, <strong>शालीय</strong> belonging to the house <strong>गोंनर्दीय</strong>belonging to or living in Gonarda. Dr. Trump assigns a differentorigin to this Sindhi <strong>जो-जी</strong>, which, as well as the etymologies ofthe corresponding possessive terminations existing in othercognate dialects, hardly bears examination.</p>
<p>Another way of expressing possession is furnished by derivetives of the root <strong>कृ</strong> &rsquo;to do or make. The roar of a lion is his <strong>कार्य</strong>or act. The roar of a lion is a <strong>सिंहकार्य</strong>or lion act, <em>i. e</em>. it is something which belongs to the lion. The word <strong>कार्यं</strong> therefore is adapted to express &lsquo;something belonging to one.&rsquo; Now this <strong>कार्य</strong> is inthe Pr, reduced to <strong>केर</strong>, as the <strong>पर्य</strong>of <strong>पर्यन्त</strong> to <strong>पेर</strong>, and the <strong>श्चर्य</strong>of <strong>आश्चर्य</strong>to <strong>छेर</strong>. From this <strong>केर</strong>, we have <strong>केरको</strong> which means &lsquo;somethingbelonging to one&rsquo; or his property. Madayantikāin the Mālatimādhava calls her body Makaranda&rsquo;s or <strong>केरअ</strong> or <strong>केरक</strong>,since he hadsaved it from the mouth of a lion. Hemacandra gives <strong>केर</strong> as anoun in the Apabbr. dialect expressive of the thing connectedwith another. The instance he gives is <strong>जसुकेरए हुंकारए सुहहुं पडंति तणाइं</strong>&lsquo;From whose mouth grass falls down in consequence of theroar which is the <strong>केरअ</strong> of the lion. He also gives in his grammarof the principal Prakrit <strong>केर</strong> as a termination having the sense ofpossession as in <strong>तुह्यकेर</strong> &lsquo;yours&rsquo; like <strong>तण</strong>. Thus then <strong>केर</strong> which wasfirst a noun came to be used as a postposition expressive ofpossession and was used as such in the principal Prakrit and bythe G. and H. poets:</p>
<p>अंधाकेरी लाकडी है दुबलींनु धन।</p>
<p>Tulasi.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am the stick of the blind [women ] and the wealth of aweak I (woman).&rsquo;</p>
<p>हुकुम होय हजोरी केरी शोषी नाखो बाधोसागर॥</p>
<p>Sāmaladās.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If the command of the lord is received, I will dry up thewhole ocean.’</p>
<p>One of Kabīra&rsquo;s Sākhīis—</p>
<p>दर्पण केरी ओ गुफा सोण्हापैठा धाय।<br>
देखत प्रतिमा आपनि भूखि भूंखि भूंखि मरि जाय॥</p>
<p>&lsquo;A dog enters a room [made up] of mirrors and runs aboutand, seeing his own image, he barks and barks until he dies.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There is another instance :</p>
<p>अमृतकेरी मोटरी सिरसे धरी उतारि।<br>
जाहि कहो मैयेक हौमोहि कहैद्वैचारि॥</p>
<p>&lsquo;I put down from head the parcel containing nectar. To whomsoever I say that I am one, to me he speaks in return two or four.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here we have केरी a possessive postposition. Similarly inTulsidās&rsquo;s Rāmāyaṇa we have <strong>कहु</strong> <strong>खबर बिभीषण केरी</strong> ‛give us newsabout Bibhīṣaṇs, where also we have the same postposition.When the initial <strong>क</strong> is dropped we have <strong>एर</strong> which we find in theHindi <strong>तेरा</strong> and <strong>मेरा</strong> as in Kabīr&rsquo;s Sākhī,</p>
<p>जो तू चाहौमुझको छोडुसकलकी आस।<br>
मेरा ऐसा व्हैरहैसब किछु तेरे पास॥॥</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you want me, give up the desire for everything else;become mine; and you will have everything else with you.’<strong>एर</strong> is the general postposition in the B. as <strong>पापेर</strong> ’of sin,&rsquo;<strong>ईश्वरेर</strong>’ot God,&rsquo; <strong>घरेर</strong>&lsquo;of a house.’</p>
<p>Prof. Hörnle and Mr. Beames derive the suffix from theSkr. past part. <strong>कृत</strong> which they say is reduced to <strong>करिअ</strong>and thenceto <strong>केर</strong>. But I have not met with a trace of <strong>करिअ</strong> as the Pr. form of <strong>करिअ</strong>of <strong>कृत</strong>. The usual form of it is <strong>किअ</strong> or <strong>कअ</strong>. Besides the <strong>इ</strong>is inorganic, being simply &amp; euphonic augment. Such aeuphonic augment cannot persist throughout centuries as the <strong>ए</strong> of <strong>केर</strong>has done until it was perpetuated in the form of <strong>एर</strong> in the B.Besides, <strong>केरक</strong> is, as we have seen, used as a noun in the sense ofproperty. There is no indication that a past pass. part can be soused. It may be used as an abstract noun, as <strong>गतम्</strong> in the sense of</p>
<p>&lsquo;going.&rsquo; So <strong>कृतम्</strong> may at the best acquire the sense of &lsquo;doing&rdquo;, butthe transition of &lsquo;doing&rsquo; to &lsquo;property&rsquo; is hardly possible.</p>
<p>Another derivative of the root has also supplied the vernaculars with a termination expressive of the genitive sense; andthat is <strong>कर</strong>. A good many words in Sanskrit have this <strong>कर</strong> appendedto them such as <strong>यशस्कर</strong>&lsquo;bringing fame&rsquo;, <strong>वचनकर</strong> &lsquo;obedient,&rsquo; <strong>किंकर</strong>&lsquo;servant&rsquo;, <strong>प्रभाकर</strong> &rsquo;the sun,&rsquo; <strong>लिपिकर</strong>&lsquo;a writer&rsquo;, etc. The originalsense is &lsquo;one who does the thing&rsquo; expressed by the nouns to whichis appended, but the derived senses are many, such as cause,habit, obedience and any other relation into which the doing ofa thing brings one with another. When the particular nature ofthis relation is left out of sight, the general sense is &lsquo;related to’ or&quot;belonging to.’ Thus <strong>प्रभाकर</strong>originally meaning &rsquo;the maker oflight’ comes to denote &lsquo;belonging to light&rsquo;; a certain person whois <strong>लिपिकर</strong> or the doer of the writing is a person related or belonging to the writing. Thus <strong>कर</strong>came gradually to signify agenitive relation like the termination <strong>ईय, त्य, तन</strong>etc., noticedabove. In the Marathi <strong>कर</strong> is applied in ordinary use to thename of a place to denote &lsquo;one residing in it&rsquo; or generally&quot;belonging it it&rsquo; as <strong>काशीकर</strong> &lsquo;belonging to Kāśī&rsquo;, <strong>पुणेकर</strong> ’belonging toPoona.’ Instances of this <strong>कर</strong> occur in the old Hindi poets; thusin Tulsidās&rsquo;s Rāmāyaṇa we have—</p>
<p>तजौं न नारदकर उपदेशू ।</p>
<p>Bālak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not set aside the advice of Nārada.&rdquo;</p>
<p>पुनि पुनि हृदय विचार करि घरि सीताकर रूप।</p>
<p>(Ditto).</p>
<p>&lsquo;Again and again reflecting in her mind she (Pārvatī) assumedthe form of Sītā.’</p>
<p>मैंशंकरकर कड़ा न माना ।</p>
<p>(Ditto).</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not obey the word of Śaṁkara.&rsquo;</p>
<p>भरद्वाज सुनु अपर अय राम जन्मकर हेतु।</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh Bharadvāja, hear now another reason for the birth ofRāma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Kabīr too we meet this termination as in:—</p>
<p>तब ब्रह्मा (ब्रह्में) पूछल महतारि।<br>
को तोर पुरुष का ( के) करि तुम नारी।</p>
<p>Kabīr&rsquo;s Rāmaintī, 1-4th Chaupai.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then the mother was asked by Brahma &ldquo;who is thy husbandand whose wife art thou.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here we have <strong>काकरि</strong> or <strong>केकरि</strong>in which we have the feminineof the termination <strong>कर</strong>. In Sanskrit <strong>कार</strong>is almost as much usedas <strong>कर</strong> after nouns and the signification is similar. This <strong>कार</strong>issometimes used in the Bengali in a genitive sense as in <strong>आपनकार</strong>&lsquo;of your honour,&rsquo; <strong>आजकार</strong>&lsquo;of to-day,&rsquo; <strong>कालिकार</strong>&lsquo;of yesterday.&lsquo;From <strong>कर</strong>, when the initial consonant is dropped, we have theOriya genitive suffix <strong>अर</strong>as in <strong>घरर</strong>, while <strong>कार</strong> gives us the <strong>मार</strong> ofthe Hindi <strong>तुझारा</strong> &lsquo;youre,&rsquo; <strong>हमारा</strong> &lsquo;ours snd of the Guj <strong>तारो</strong>&rsquo;thing,&rsquo;<strong>तमारो</strong>&lsquo;yours,&rsquo; <strong>मारो</strong> &lsquo;mine,&rsquo; <strong>अमारो</strong> &lsquo;ours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Another derivative of the root <strong>कृ</strong>. the past pass. part. <strong>कृत</strong>changed to <strong>फअ</strong> in the Prakrit, has been appropriated in Hindi to express genitive relations. As the obl. form has been determined to be a remnant of the old genitive, the <strong>क</strong> appended to itmust mean&rsquo; done of (by) the thing or person&rsquo; denoted by theobl. form. The idea of a thing done by one&rsquo; passes easily intoa thing belonging to one. <strong>पण्डितकृत काव्य</strong> &lsquo;apoem composed bya Pandit&rsquo; becomes easily <strong>पण्डितका काव्य</strong> <em>i.e.</em> the poem of a Pandit.The terminations <strong>का, की</strong> exist in old Hindi along with <strong>केरा, केरी</strong>snd <strong>कर, करी</strong>.</p>
<p>The easiest explanation of the Panjabi <strong>दा-दी</strong>appears to bethat, like the Hindi <strong>का-की</strong>, they are derived from the pastpass, part of <strong>दा</strong> to give ’in the form of <strong>दअ</strong>made up on theanalogy of <strong>कअ</strong> from <strong>कृ</strong>. Other explanations may also be given.It may be said that the <strong>रो-री</strong>of the Marvari dialect and certainG. and H. pronouns, which results from the Sanskrit <strong>कार</strong>, waschanged to <strong>डो-डी</strong>or <strong>डा-डी</strong>, as these consonants are frequentlyconfounded with each other; and thence <strong>डो-डी</strong> or <strong>डा-डी</strong> passedinto <strong>दो-दी</strong> or <strong>दा-दी</strong>. The Sanskrit suffixes used by the vernacularsto express genitive relations must have a final <strong>क</strong> added to them,since, like augmented nouns, the masc. nom. sing. ends in <strong>ओ</strong> or</p>
<p><strong>आ</strong> and the feminine in <strong>ई</strong>. Thus for the original of the M.<strong>चा-ची-चें</strong>we must have <strong>त्यक</strong>, for the G. <strong>नो-नी-नुं तनक</strong>, for S, <strong>जो-जीईयक</strong>, for H <strong>का की कुतक</strong>, and for old H. <strong>केरा</strong> and <strong>री केरक</strong> and for<strong>कर</strong> <strong>करक</strong> and for <strong>कार कारक</strong>. In the fourth lecture I have givenseveral instances of the addition of to all sorts of nouns andadjectives.</p>
<p>The new loc. termination in H. are <strong>में</strong>, Braj. <strong>मैं</strong>and पै, P.ते, S. <strong>मे</strong>,G.<strong>मां</strong>, M. <strong>आंत</strong>and B. <strong>ते</strong>. The forms with an initial <strong>म</strong> are derivedfrom the Skr. <strong>मध्य</strong> which has undergone several transformations.In old H. and G. poetry it occurs in the forms of <strong>माहीं</strong>antil <strong>महं</strong>eto., as :—</p>
<p>शिव संकल्प कीन्हमनमाहीं ।</p>
<p>Tulsi, Bāla-K.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Siva resolved in his mind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>जे हि राखे रघुवीर ते उपरे तेहि कालमहं ।</p>
<p>(Ditto).</p>
<p>&lsquo;Those were safe at that time whom Raghuvīra protected.&rsquo;</p>
<p>एकवार त्रेतायुगमाहीं ।</p>
<p>(Ditto).</p>
<p>&lsquo;Once in Tretāyuga&rsquo;</p>
<p>पुनि मंदिर मई बात जनाई।</p>
<p>&lsquo;He announced the intelligence in the palace.&rsquo;</p>
<p>सुदामा में पृथिवी माहीं ।लीधा दश अवतार ॥</p>
<p>Premānand&rsquo;s SudāmānuṃCaritra.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Sudāma, I have gone through ten incarnations on this earth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>सोरठ माहीं सहुको नाठतुं ।</p>
<p>&lsquo;Everybody fled to Soraṭha.’</p>
<p>The Braj. <strong>मैं</strong>is from <strong>माहिं</strong>, the <strong>ह</strong> being olided and <strong>आ</strong> and <strong>इ</strong> combining into <strong>ऐ</strong>, while in the S. and H. <strong>मे</strong> they form <strong>ए</strong>. In the G.<strong>मा</strong> the whole <strong>हि</strong>of B is dropped. <strong>माहिं</strong> is loc. sing of <strong>माह</strong> for <strong>मध्य</strong>.</p>
<p>The P. and B. <strong>ते</strong> is from <strong>तहिं</strong>, the loc. of <strong>तद्</strong>, or <strong>तेहिं</strong>which we havenoticed as an Apbhr. dative postposition.</p>
<p>H. पै is from Skr.<strong>पार्श्व</strong>, which first becomes <strong>पस्स</strong>, then <strong>पास</strong>, andthen <strong>पाह</strong> or <strong>पह</strong>, and the loc.of <strong>पाह</strong> is <strong>पाहीं</strong>or <strong>पहं</strong>which is its shortened form. <strong>पास</strong> is used as a post-position in H. and <strong>पासे</strong> and <strong>पाशीं</strong>.the loc. forms, in G. and M. respectively. The forms <strong>पाहिं</strong> and पहंoccur in the old H. poets, as :—</p>
<p>शंभु गये कुंभज ऋषि पाहीं।</p>
<p>Tulsi, Bāla-K.</p>
<p>’Śaṁbhu went to Agastya.&rsquo;</p>
<p>गयो कपि राम पहुं।</p>
<p>Tulsi.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The monkey went to Rāma.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The M. <strong>आंत</strong> is from Skr. <strong>अन्तः</strong> and its initial <strong>आ</strong> is dropped aftera dissimilar vowel as <strong>मातीतं</strong> etc.</p>
<p><strong>NEW VERBAL FORMS</strong></p>
<p>We will now briefly examine the reconstructed verbal forms.We have observed that the materials out of which the case formsare constructed are not only independent words having, as in anearlier stage of a language, specific significations, the combination of which nearly constitutes the idea required to be expressed,but also independent case forms and existing terminations whichhave acquired a specific sense. Thus when the terminations cameinto use for both numbers of the cases, the B. and the O. have hadrecourse to the use of independent words such as <strong>दिग</strong>&lsquo;a row.&lsquo;and <strong>मान</strong>&lsquo;a measure or class,&rsquo; <strong>सकल</strong> &lsquo;all etc. to express plurality,while the G. employed the already existing plural termination<strong>ओ</strong>; and such forms as <strong>तहिं</strong> and <strong>कहिं</strong> loc. and <strong>कहुं</strong> abl. were used toexpress case relations and afterwards grew into terminationswhen their etymological sense was forgotten. We have also scenthat, as in the case of the new words that come into a language,the new forms at first express inadequately the sense they aredesigned to convey, but in the course of time imagination andusage give them a definite signification; or like words the formscome by natural transitions to express different relations fromthose they did before. Thus it was that the abl. <strong>कहुं</strong> and the loc.<strong>कहिं</strong> or <strong>तहिं</strong>became dat, affixes or the loc. of the present participle<strong>होइते</strong> came to express an abl. relation.</p>
<p>We shall find these principles at work in the reconstructionof the verb also; and there too you will meet with verbal formsmade up by applying the old personal and other terminationsto new bases which are adjectival in their nature or by addingverbal forms to them or by appending independent words. The</p>
<p>M., S., B. and O. make up some of their tenses and moods in thefirst way; the others do not. We will first examine these. Thebases for their formation are as a matter of course the participlesthat have come down from the Prakrits and there are no other.These are the present, past and the potential participles whichare, as I have just said, adjectival in their nature. Since anadjective must agree with the noun which it qualifies in numberand gender, our new verbs must express both these and the personof the nominative. The old verbal forms examined in the lastlecture express, as Skr. and Pr. verbs do, only the number andperson because they have descended to us from those languages.</p>
<p>In the modern dialects those adjectives only that end in <strong>ओ</strong> or <strong>आ</strong>agree with the noun to which they are referred, <em>i. e.</em> take thefem.termination <strong>ई</strong> when the noun is feminine and the pluralones when it is plural, as <strong>काला-ला घोडा</strong> M. H. &lsquo;a black horse,&rsquo;<strong>काली-ली घोडी</strong> &lsquo;a black mare, <strong>काले-ले घोडे</strong> ‛black horses,&rsquo; <strong>काल्याघोड्या, काली घोडियां</strong>. Similarly, G. and S. When the qualifiednoun is in an abl. case, sing. or pl., these adjectives take the obl.sing form <strong>काल्या घोड्यास</strong> M., <strong>काले घांडेकों</strong> H.,<strong>काल्या चोडीस</strong> M., <strong>कालीघोडीकों</strong> H. Hindi has no obl. form for other nouns than thosewhich end in <strong>आ</strong>and hence in <strong>काली घोडीकों</strong>the adjective remainsunchanged.</p>
<p>Adjectives with other endings are not thus inflected as <strong>खराबघोडा-घोडे-घोडी-घोड्या-घोडियां-घोड्यास घोडेकों</strong> etc. M. H.; while in theB. and O. no adjectives whatever.</p>
<p>Here then we see that, like nouns in <strong>ओ-आ</strong>, adjectives alsowith those endings have preserved the old terminations. Nowthe three participles I have mentioned end in <strong>आ</strong> or <strong>ओ</strong> arisingfrom the original affix <strong>क</strong>, wherefore they must be inflected. InM. and G., however, under certain circumstances the presentparticiple ends in <strong>अ</strong> and therefore is not inflected. The oldPresent has in M. acquired another sense whence a new one cameinto use, the forms of which are as follows:—</p>

<p>These are made up by adding the terminations expressive ofgender and person to the pres. part. which is <strong>करत</strong>. White the fem. <strong>ई</strong>this becomes <strong>करती</strong>, but there is another form in <strong>ये</strong> which appearsto have been arrived at thus:<strong>करन्तअ</strong> ( for <strong>करन्तक</strong> )-<strong>करतय-करतय+ई</strong>of fem.—<strong>करतये</strong>—<strong>करत्ये</strong>.The neuter form is <strong>करते</strong>.These threeforms are used in the sing. while the gender is neglected in the pl.There is however such a form as <strong>करत्यात</strong> used for the 3rd pers. pl.in the pure Deccan in which <strong>करत्यात</strong> is the fem. pl. of <strong>करती</strong>. Tothese adjectival bases are appended the personal terminations ofthe old Pres. for the two numbers, which, you will remember, are3rd pers. sing. <strong>इ</strong>. pl. <strong>त</strong>; 2nd pers. sing. <strong>स</strong>, pl. <strong>आ</strong>; 1st pers. sing. <strong>इं</strong>,pl. <strong>ऊं</strong>.</p>
<p>In the 1st pers. sing. of the new present the <strong>इं</strong> of the 1st pers.sing. is represented by the characteristic anusvära, the vowelsexpressive of gender necessitating the elision of <strong>इ</strong>. In the pl.<strong>करत</strong> and <strong>ऊं</strong> become by combination करतों. The 2nd pers. sing. hasthe <strong>स</strong> of the old Pres. and the pl. the <strong>आ</strong> which with the <strong>त</strong> forms<strong>ता</strong>, to which however an inorganic anusvāra is added bysome. The 3rd pers. sing. has no personal termination, theadjective in its own form expressing that idea, while in the pl.the <strong>त</strong>of the old Pres. is added.</p>
<p>In these forms we see that the of the nom. which is droppedin ordinary nouns and adjectives is retained and we have <strong>करतो</strong>but not <strong>चांगलो</strong>.</p>
<p>In the Goan. and Māl. the gender is not attended to and theforms are the same for all. This arises from the use of the unaugmented participle <strong>करत</strong> and not <strong>करतअ</strong> which retains the inflections. The forms are:—</p>

<p>The terminations are those of the old Pres. of intransitiveroots in these dialects, <em>i. e.</em> the real Pr. terminations without thetransitive or Parasm, augment <strong>ई</strong>. The 2nd pers. pl. <strong>त</strong>, which Ihave traced to the Pr. <strong>इत्था</strong>, is peculiar to the Goan. and Māl. andit is not altogether absent from the ordinary M. In the 1st. pers.sing. Māl, we have the old <strong>इं</strong> from <strong>मि</strong> distinct and not reduced toan amusvära as in the standard dialect and also the Goan.</p>
<p>A process the reverse of that observable in M. as regards thechange in the sense of verbal forms has taken place in theO. and B. The old Pres. in M. has acquired the sense of the PastHabitual and the forms made up by appending the old terminations to the pres. part. express present time, but in the O. and B.this new Present of the M. expresses habitual past action andthe old Pres. retains its present signification. In H. too thepres. part. used alone has the signification of the Past Habitual.</p>
<p>The reason why forms expressive of present time have cometo denote past time is to be sought for in that natural use of thePres, which is called Historic Present. A man in narrating astory transports himself for the sake of vividness into that timewhen the actions are supposed to have taken place and speaks ofthem as if they were present; and when this habit becomes generalin a language, the fact of such an imaginary transfer is forgottenand the Present Tense becomes Past Tense. We have manyinstances of this use of the Skr. Pres. in such books as the Pañcatantra. The forms of the O. Past Habitual are these :—</p>

<p>As in the M., the 3rd pers. sing. has no personal termination;and the pl. is the M. and H. pl. of nouns in <strong>आ</strong> as <strong>घोडे</strong> which wefind in the O. nom. pl. <strong>पशुमाने</strong> &lsquo;beasts&rsquo; also. The second personhas the same termination as the corresponding old Present, viz.<strong>अ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong>. The first person sing. has <strong>इ</strong>and the pl. <strong>ऊं</strong> and they arethe same as the <strong>इं</strong> and <strong>उ</strong> of the Pres., but there is some confusionabout the anusvāras.</p>
<p>Before proceeding it is necessary to mention that O. and B.use the sing, forms in speaking of, and to, inferiors, while thepl. is used in an honorific sense. This is so in all the languages;but these two use even in a singular nominative with the honorific forms or real plurals and a plural one with the inferior forms.This is due to the loss of the original plural of nouns in theselanguages, which I have before mentioned; so that one sameform of the nom. came to be used for both the sing. and pl. verbalforms; but, since the usage common to all our vernaculars didexist, the pl. forms came to be understood in a simply honorificsense, and the sing. in the sense of inferiority. There was nothing in the form of the nom. which expressed plurality and hencethe verbs also ceased to indicate it, though originally fitted todo so. Similarly, the pl. forms of personal pronouns which werenot lost came to be restricted to an honorific signification andthe sing, to that of inferiority. The words which were broughtinto use to indicate plurality expressed an aggregate or collection and thus, being themselves sing., the necessity of pl. verbalforms in connection with them was not felt; and hence they take&amp; verb in the real old sing. But there is this consistency in theuse of the verb, that the honorific pers. pronouns take an honorificverb and the inferior an inferior, <em>i.e.</em> an original pl. nom.takes an original plural verb and an original sing. a singular.</p>
<p>These same forms that we have been discussing have in theS. acquired a future signification and constitute the regularFuture tense of that dialect. The Pres, expresses in all languagesan immediate future—a man&rsquo;s intending shortly to do a thing isconsidered as good as actually doing it. This is the germ offuturity in the signification of forms of the Present tense; andusage may take hold of it and constitute them into a regularFuture. The Sindhi forms are—</p>

<p>Here <strong>हलंद</strong>is the old pres part.The 3d pers, as in the O. andalso M., partially has no personal terminations. The sing, and</p>
<p>the pl. are like those of corresponding adjectives in <strong>ओ</strong>. The 2ndpers, has the termination <strong>एं</strong> and <strong>उ</strong> of the S. old Pres. In the fem.the first is optionally reduced to <strong>अं</strong> and the <strong>उ</strong> combines with thefem. pl. <strong>ऊं</strong>. The first pers. pl. has the corresponding S. pronoun<strong>असीं</strong> &lsquo;we&rsquo; attached to it as a termination as in an early stage ofa language. The sing. <strong>सि</strong> or <strong>असि</strong>is perhaps the same without thenasal and shortened, which changes are made probably to adaptit to the expression of singularity. The adjectival maso. termination appears also in the first pers. sing., as in M., but it is shortened to <strong>उ</strong> and the fem. sing. <strong>ई</strong> and the pl. <strong>ऊ</strong> or <strong>ई ऊ</strong> optionallycombined into <strong>यू</strong> throughout. In the M. the adjectival genderterminations are not used in the pl. Dr. Trump considers thesepersonal terminations as the remnants of the old Pr. forms of <strong>अस्</strong>,which, however, are quite different from these.</p>
<p>The old past part. is similarly made the base of verbal formsexpressive of past time. In S. they are made up just in the sameway as the above, the 3rd pers. having the purely adjectivalforms, without the personal terminations, and the gender affixesappearing in the same places as in the above.</p>

<p>Here as before we have simply adjectival forms for the 3rdpers.; and the verbal terminations of the old Pres. appear in thefirst and second united with the nominal affixes indicative ofgender and number, which however are dropped where they cannot be easily combined with the other, as in the first and secondperson plural mase. It should be remarked that the old masc.termination <strong>उ</strong> or <strong>ओ</strong> is preserved in the 1st pers. sing., as in thenew Pres., and the 2nd pers. pl. has in some cases the affix <strong>त</strong>.,which I have already noticed and traced to the Pr. <strong>इत्था</strong>.</p>
<p>The Cit. and Goan. dialects agree with this in the main, butuse <strong>त</strong> for the 2nd pers. pl. of the Masc. also, as <strong>गेलेत</strong>. Their masc.sing, is <strong>गेलो</strong>and fem. pl. <strong>गेल्यो</strong>, since they do not drop the old <strong>उ</strong> ofthe fem. nom. pl.</p>
<p>The Māl, discards gender in the first and second persons, whenthe verbal terminations are appended, and the first pers. sing.termination is the old <strong>इं</strong>, which before the <strong>ओ</strong>of the others isreduced to an anusvāra, and we have <strong>गेलेइं—लैं</strong> &lsquo;I went. The 2ndpers. pl. termination is <strong>त</strong>throughout, as in the other dialects.</p>

<p>In transitive verbs M. attempts a curious combination. The participle being passive, it must agree with the object and take its number and gender and, if made the base of the verbal forms, its personalso. But unliked the Sindhī, the M.does not use this passive participlefor an object in the first and second persons. Thus <strong>मायैं</strong> and <strong>मार्युसि</strong> in</p>
<p>S. mean &rsquo;thou wert beaten&rsquo; and &lsquo;I was beaten&rsquo;, but we do not use&rsquo;.such forms as <strong>मारिलास</strong> or <strong>मारिलो</strong>to express this sense, though asolitary line from Moropant containing <strong>धरिलास</strong> has been oftenquoted. In these cases we use the impersonal constructionputting the agent and the object in the instr. and dat. and using,the sing, neuter form of the past part., as <strong>त्याणें मला</strong> or <strong>तुला मारिलें</strong>.Thus then this participle can have a nom, object only of the thirdperson. Properly then it ought to take no personal terminationsat all; but when the agent which is always in the instr. caseis of the 2nd pers., the characteristic sing., <strong>स</strong>and pl. <strong>त</strong>of that pers.are appended to the participle, so that it takes the gender andnumber of the object which is in the nom, case and the pers. andnumber of the agent which is in the instr. case. Thus we have<strong>तूं पोथीलिहिलीस</strong> &rsquo;thou transcribedst a book <strong>तूं पोथ्या लिहिल्पास तूं कामकेलेंस</strong> &rsquo;thou didst a work&rsquo;. <strong>तुह्यींपोथी लिहिलीत, पोथ्या लिहिल्यात</strong>.</p>
<p>These forms are condemned by the Translation Departmentof the Director of Public Instruction, but the Marathi speakerscannot dispense with them; <strong>त्वां काम केलें, त्वां पोथीलिहिली</strong>, theproposed substitutes, are felt to be weak and emasculated. Andthe Konkaṇis are not satisfied with second personal forms aloneof this nature and have devised a way of affiliating the past part.with the third personal agent also and, as the old terminations <strong>द</strong>and <strong>त</strong> are not expressive enough, they append to that participle thelast syllable of the agent forms, <em>i. e.</em> the <strong>नें</strong> or <strong>न</strong> of the instr. sing. and <strong>नीं</strong> of the pl. as <strong>त्या साहेबानें-नमला बक्षिसें दिलेनीं</strong>&rsquo;the Saheb gaveme &amp; reward&rsquo; <strong>त्या साहेबांनी मला बक्षिसे दिलेनीं</strong> &rsquo;the Sahebe gave merewards&rsquo;,where the <strong>न</strong> and नींof and <strong>साहेबान</strong> are <strong>साहेबांनीं</strong> added tothe verbs to connect them with them. These forms are not usedin the Deccan except by some KonkaṇīBrahmans settled there;and they are condemned by all good writers.</p>
<p>The O. and the B. do not inflect their adjectives, whether theyend in ओ or any other vowel and have no agent case or instrumental. When the languages came to be in this condition, there wasnothing to mark off the passive nature of the transitive participle.Hence it was forgotten and we have now active verbal formsonly, which are constructed as in the other languages.</p>

<p>As in the Pres., the O. like the other languages does not addverbal terminations to the third pers., but the forms are likethose in M., namely the nom. sing. and pl. masc., though they donot indicate gender here. The other persons have the terminationsof the Present.</p>
<p>The B. has no termination in the third pers. singular, whilethe pl. has the corresponding of the Present in that language.The 2nd pers. sing, has <strong>इ</strong> and the first person sing. <strong>म्</strong>, which arenot used in the B. Present, but are to be traced to the Apabhr.Present preserved in the <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>ऊं</strong> of the H and others; <strong>देखिल + ऊं</strong>is <strong>देखिलांव</strong>like the Goan <strong>करतांव</strong>from <strong>करत + उं</strong>, and the anusvāraand the <strong>व</strong>are hardened into <strong>म्</strong>. The first pers. pl. has the sameform as the sing., and such a confusion is easy in a languagewithout distinction of number. The second pers. pl. appears to bethe old adjectival pl. like the M. <strong>केले</strong> and the O.and the otherform is <strong>देखिला</strong> sing., the two being confounded.</p>
<p><strong>THE FUTURE TENSE</strong></p>
<p>The Skr. potential participle in <strong>तव्य</strong>, Pr. <strong>अव्व</strong>, which impliesduty, has become the base of the O. and B. Future. In Skr. <strong>मयाकर्तव्यम्</strong> means &lsquo;it is to be done by me&rsquo; <em>i. e.</em> it is my duty to do it,and the transition from this idea to &lsquo;I shall do it is natural. Thevery word &lsquo;shall&rsquo; in English, which primarily signifies &lsquo;I owe&rsquo;and has now become the sing of the English Future, is anexample of it. This participle in Skr. and Pr. is impersonal whenthe root is intransitive and passive when it is transitive. Likethe past part, this has lost its passive character in these languagesfor the same reasons. The usual personal terminations areapplied to it as—</p>

<p>In the O., the third pers. sing. has no terminations and the pl.has the nom. pl. <strong>ए</strong>, which we have found in so many cases. Theothers have the usual affixes. The optional <strong>वा</strong>of the first pers. pl.appears to be the adjectival sing. <strong>वा</strong>.</p>
<p>The B. first pers. has no termination; the second has the sameas those we examined in the case of the Past tense and the thirdhas the affixes of the regular Present.</p>
<p>This participle is similarly made the base of a future tense inSindhi; but since its passive character was not forgotten by theSindhis, as by the Bengalis and the Oriyas, the Future tense itforms is the Passive Future. The same terminations as those wehave examined before are appended to it, as <strong>मारिवुसि</strong> &lsquo;I shall bebeaten&rsquo;, <strong>मारिबे</strong> &rsquo;thou shalt be beaten&rsquo; and <strong>मारिबो</strong>&lsquo;he will be beaten.&ldquo;The third person has, as before, no personal affixes. When theverb is intransitive, this participle is used only impersonally inthe masc. sing., the agent being in the instrumental.</p>
<p>In M. however the optional participle has preserved its oldsense and is passive and impersonal, and, when used as a base forverbal forms, takes only the second pers. sing. affix <strong>स</strong> and the pl. <strong>त</strong>.Like the past participle when it is passive it takes the gender andnumber of the object in the nom, and the person and number ofthe agent in the instrumental, 88 <strong>तूं ग्रंथ लिहावास, पोथी वाचावीस आणिदुसरें काम करावेंस</strong> thou shouldst write a work, read a book and dosome other work.’ When the object is in the pl., we have <strong>लिहावेस,वाचाव्यास, करावींस</strong>; and when the agent is in the pl. and the objectsing., we have <strong>लिहावात, वाचावीत, करावेंत</strong>; and when both are in the pl.<strong>लिहावेत, बायाच्यात</strong> and <strong>करावीत</strong>. When the verb is Intransitive, it isimpersonal <em>i. e.</em> has no Nom, with which it should agree, sincethe object alone can be Nom., but it takes the <strong>स</strong> and <strong>त</strong>of the agent,as<strong>तुं जावेंस—तुझीं जावेंत</strong>.</p>
<p>Dr. Trump and Mr. Beames (Jour. R. A. S. Vol. VII), misledby the circumstance that in the B., O. and S. the <strong>व</strong> is pronouncedlike <strong>ब</strong>, have likened these forms to the Latin <em>bo</em> and explain themas made up of the principal root and the Skr. <strong>भू</strong>. But this latterhas in none of the vernaculars assumed the form of <strong>ब</strong> by dropping the vowel and the aspiration, nor are <strong>भ</strong> or the aspiratedconsonants generally ever known to become the corresponding</p>
<p>unaspirates. The genius of the Prakrits and their descendantsis to preserve the aspirate element and to drop the mute. In rarecases the former is thrown on an adjoining letter, but never lost.The usual form in which we have <strong>भू</strong> is <strong>हू</strong>. And this etymologywould not account for the fact that the forms with <strong>य</strong>are passivein S.</p>
<p>In these verbal forms then we observe fresh instances of thelaw of generalization or false analogy. For the Present andFuture tenses verbal or predicative forms, *i. e.*such as indicatethe person of the Nom., were wanted; and so great is the necessityof such forms that we in M. make up such verbs as <strong>करावीस</strong>and<strong>केलीस</strong> agreeing with both the agent and the objectas noticedabove. But the languages being in spite of this want condemned to use participles only, they made the best of what they hadand extended the analogy of the old Pres., which they possessed, to the participles, which they could not avoid, and thus applied thepersonal terminations to the participles and mads verbs of them.The B. and O. rather than make the verbs agree with the object,as the passive nature of the participle base of the verb required,dropped the passive character altogether and made the participlestake the personal tarminations of the agent, while M. reconcilesboth and makes the verb based on the passive participles agreewith the person and number of the agent and the gender andnumber of the object.</p>
<p>We have next to examine the forms that are made up byadding independent words. There are not many of this class.The H. and P. Future is constructed by affixing <strong>गा</strong> sing., <strong>गे</strong> pl.masc., and <strong>गी</strong>sing. and <strong>गीं</strong> pl. fem to the forms of the Present. This <strong>गा</strong> appears to be the past participle of <strong>गम्</strong>and ordinarily it isused in the form of <strong>गया</strong>. Participles of other roots also are in H.sometimes reduced to monosyllabic forms as <strong>दी</strong>for <strong>दिई, की</strong> for <strong>किई</strong>;these are feminine and the corresponding masc. monosyllabicforms are er <strong>दा</strong>and <strong>का</strong>. We have seen that these <strong>का-की</strong> and <strong>दा-दी</strong>are appended to the obl. case form to make up the genitive in H.and P. Similarly the participle <strong>गा-गी</strong> is used to form the Future,so that <strong>करेगा</strong> means &lsquo;gone that he may do.&rsquo; The M. Future isformed by adding <strong>इल</strong> or <strong>ल</strong> to the old Present, as you will see fromthe following forms:—</p>

<p>In the first pers. sing. <strong>ल</strong> and the anusvära of <strong>रीं</strong> together form<strong>न</strong>as they do in several other cases; the pl. is the same as that ofthe Pres. What is the nature of this <strong>ल</strong> or <strong>इल</strong> ? One <strong>ल</strong> that isappended to the past participle we have already examined. Thereis another appended in the Goan. and Māl. to the present part.and the forms thus made up have past habitual and future sense.Thus Goan. <strong>करतालो</strong>means &lsquo;he used to do&rsquo; and <strong>करतलो</strong>Goan.andMāl. &lsquo;he will do.&rsquo; In both cases the base is the present part., butin the first it occurs in the augmented form or the form with theold Skr. <strong>क</strong>. The pres. part. has in the O., as we have seen,acquired a past and in the S. a future sense, the germs of both ofwhich are, as I have explained, contained in its original signification, while here in the Goan. it has both the senses. Now, asit was the practice, as I observed in the last two lectures, toattach <strong>क</strong> and <strong>ल</strong>or <strong>इल</strong> optionally to a great many words, the sameword had often several forms—one without <strong>क</strong>, another with it, athird with <strong>ल</strong>, a fourth without it and a fifth with both <strong>ल</strong> and <strong>क</strong>.These terminations did not signify much originally but afterwards, when the words such as the pres. part. began more andmore to acquire distinct and diverse significations, one of theforms whether with or without <strong>ल</strong> became identified with onesense and the other with another. Thus <strong>करतालो</strong>, made up as it isby the addition of <strong>क</strong>, which has left its <strong>अ</strong>, and of <strong>ल</strong>, was appropriated for the Habitual Past and without to the Future.But that the new additions themselves originally were notexpressive of that sense is shown by the fact that the augmentedform <strong>करता</strong> in <strong>तो करता तर बरें होतें</strong> expresses past conditional in M.and H., while it is the unaugmented <strong>करत</strong> in G. in <strong>ते करत तो सारुंथात</strong> which conveys that sense. Thus then <strong>ल</strong> was applied in M.to the Present verbal forms also and, when the old Future waslost, these came to be appropriated for the Future, just as thepresent participle with <strong>ल</strong> came to have a future signification inthe Goan. and Māl.</p>
<p>The other tenses are made up by adding the verbal forms ofauxiliary roots, but their etymological sense has not yet beenforgotten and they have suffered no phonetic corruption except ina few cases. Hence they can easily be recognised. But thevarious ways in which they affect the sense of the principal rootin the different languages are not without interest. The auxiliaries are et from Skr. <strong>भू</strong>, the Skr. <strong>अस्</strong>or <strong>आस्</strong>, more likely the latter,which assumes the forms of <strong>आछे</strong> B., <strong>अछ</strong>O., G., <strong>है</strong>H. and P., <strong>आहे</strong>M. and S., and Skr. <strong>स्था</strong> from which the H. <strong>था</strong>and the S. <strong>थो</strong>arederived.</p>
<p>You will thus see that in this portion of their grammar thevernaculars have only adapted the materials they inherited fromthe Prakrits to their varying necessities according to the waysresorted to by all the languages in the course of their development. They have got nothing new and have simply given new shapesto the old; and the proposition, that they are descended from thePrakrits, holds good even here.</p>
<p><strong>LECTURE VII.</strong></p>
<p><strong>RELATIONS BETWEEN SANSKRIT, PALI, THE PRAKRITS<br>
AND THE MODERN VERNACULARS.</strong></p>
<p>Thus, gentlemen, have we surveyed the whole field of IndianAryan speech from the Vedic times to our own, and what is it wehave found ? The Vedic dialect lost a great many of its wordsand some grammatical forms, its nouns and roots arranged themselves under definite declensions and conjugations, and thusbecame what I have called Middle Sanskrit.</p>
<p>Till then there was no phonetic corruption except in isolatedinstances. But after that time the process went on rapidly, andwords were altered in form principally by the law of the assimilation of conjunct consonants and a few vowel ohanges. By the law of generalization or false analogy the declensions andconjugations were reduced to the prevailing types; some newwords came into use and a few old ones became obsolete, and thusthe language arrived at a stage of which the Pali, the sacredlanguage of the Southern Buddhists and the inscriptions ofAśoka afford us specimens. Then began a general use of attributive expressions for verbal forms, which had its effect on thethe vernacular or derived languages also, and thus while a goodmany of these forms went out of use in Sanskrit, the number oftenses and moods in the derived languages was reduced to three.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile the process which formed the Pali went on,other laws of phonitic change, and principally that of the elisionof uninital consonants and the reduction of aspirated ones to <strong>ह्</strong>,came into operation. The use of analogy in the simplification ofgrammar proceeded further, a few words of a non-Sanskrit originwere adopted, and thus arose the Prakrits.</p>
<p>There were several dialects of this class, but the distinctionbetween them was not great. After a while in the Prakrits themselves new phonetic processes began, the chief of which were thethe dropping of one of the assimilated consonants and in mostpases lengthening the preceding vowel, and the obviating of the</p>
<p>hiatus caused by the vowels brought together by consonantalelision by combining them or inserting light semi-vowels betweenthem. These were carried on further, the declensional andconjugational terminations were corrupted and mutilated, and theforms began to get confused; case relations came to be expressedby connecting independent words or pronominal forms with thegenitive of the noun; and new verbal forms were constructedfrom the participles by appending the personal terminations onthe analogy of the existing tenses, or by using the roots indicative of existence as auxiliaries.</p>
<p>About this time the Prakrit spoaking people came to bedivided into independent communities, separated from each otherby hills and rivers, or communication between them decreased;and therefore these several processes of destruction and construction were carried on at a varying rate and with a difference ofdetail in each; and thus grew up the modern Hindi, Marathi,Gujarati, Sindhi, &amp;c. This is the whole history. The vernaculars have descended from the Prakrits, and the Prakrits fromSanskrit; and since a language is transmitted from generation togeneration orally, if the modern dialects are spoken languagesthe Prakrits must have been so, and if the Prakrits were spokendialects the Sanskrit must have been so.</p>
<p>But these conclusions have been denied by some scholars.Professor H. H. Wilson says that that the Prakrit of the plays isan artificial modification of the Sanskrit language devised toadapt it to peculiar branches of literature. And the reason hegives is that even in later plays composed but a few centuriesago the Prakrit used is not the vernacular of the day, but thatwhich we find in the very earliest work of the species. But he isby no means certain, and leaves the question undecided. The reasonadvanced by him is evidently of no weight. If I choose at thisday to express my thoughts in Latin and compose a treatise inthat language instead of my vernacular, does that prove thatthat language is artificial ? Latin is sometimes still used inEurope for literary purposes, though it is not the vernacular ofany country. Sanskrit playwriters of later ages, and even a straydramatist at the present day, use the old Prakrits for their inferiorcharacters in orthodox obedience to the rules laid down by the</p>
<p>old authorities on the histrionic art; and since the Prakrits, likeSanskrit, Latin, and other languages are preserved by means ofgrammars and literary works, it is possible to write in them as inthese languages.</p>
<p>Mr. Beames at one time expressed himself decidedly on thispoint: &ldquo;The Prakrit of the poets is clearly not a dialect that everwas spoken.&rdquo; So Dr. Pischel, a German scholar: &ldquo;I agree withMr. Beames, that none of the Prakrits was evera spokenlanguage, and that in order to learn what was the spokenlanguage of the Aryans we must turn principally to the modernvernaculars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This, gentlemen, we have done; we have examined thevernaculars and found that there is not a rule about the changesof letters in passing from Sanskrit into the Prakrit given byVararuci or Hemacandra, of which instances are not found in thevernaculars. Of such as are general the examples are abundant;and in a great many cases even the words in which the change isof a special kind are preserved in the vernaculars in their Prakritform, slightly altered according to the processes that afterwardscame into operation. A good many of the vocal peculiarities ofPali and Prakrit speakers are preserved by the speakers of theGujarati, Marathi, Hindi, Sindhi, and Bengali. I have alreadydrawn your attention to the fact that the ordinary Gujarati cannotpronounce <strong>ऐ</strong> or<strong>औ</strong> but makes <strong>ए</strong> or <strong>ओ</strong> of it, the Marathi Deśastha<strong>ण्</strong> of <strong>न्</strong>, and the Sindhi and Bengali <strong>क्ख</strong> of <strong>क्ष</strong>, and theHindi <strong>क्ख</strong> or <strong>छ</strong> of it and <strong>व</strong> of the sibilant. The Bengali pronouncesa conjunct ending in <strong>य्</strong> as a double consonant and preserves theold Māgadhī peculiarty of reducing all the sibilants to <strong>श्</strong>, whilethe Hindi still manifests the Paiśācī pecularity of making <strong>न्</strong> of <strong>ण्</strong>.The case terminations in the forms they assumed in theApabhraṃśa have been preserved, some in this dialect, some inthat. All the three Prakrit tenses do exist and none other; pasttime is expressed in just the same way as in the Prakrits; theparticiples, the causals, the passives, the denominatives, thenominal and verbal bases, and the remnants of the Sanskritconjugations are just as they were in the Prakrits; and the newverbs and cases are formed out of Prakrit materials only. Then</p>
<p>again a good many of the Deśya or non-Sanskrit words thatexisted in the Prakrits are found in the Vernaculars.</p>
<p>Now if the Prakrits were not spoken dialects, what thesescholars probably mean is that they were artificial adaptations, asProfessor Wilson calls them. But we have seen that they grewup by such natural laws as guide the development of anylanguage whatever. The development of the Prakrit dialectsfrom Sanskrit is parallelled by the development of the Romancelanguages from Latin. If the Prakrit dialects are to be considered artificial, it is difficult to conceive upon what principles theycould have been constructed and for what purpose. A consciousmanufacture of a language would be conducted upon somegeneral principles and would not admit of such isolated forms,not obeying any general rule, as we have noticed. The analogieswould be perfect; but on the contrary we have seen that in thePali and the Prakrits a good many forms are made up accordingto a certain rule brought into use by analogy, as for instancemaking the passive by adding <strong>इज्ज</strong> or <strong>इअ</strong>, while there are otherswhich are not thus constructed but have descended by simplephonetic corruption of Sanskrit forms, as <strong>दीसइ</strong>, <strong>लब्भइ</strong> and others.In all parts of grammar there are such forms, and these havedescended to the modern Vernaculars, as we have seen.</p>
<p>Again, if these had been artificial languages, they would nothave been called after the names of the provinces as we have seenthey were. I have given ressons for believing that though thedifference between the Sauraseni and the Mahārāṣṭrīwas not great,some peculiarities of the former have been preserved by themodern Sindhi, Panjabi, Braja and Hindi, while the Marathirepresents the old Mahārāṣṭrīand some of the peculiarities of theMāgadhī Prakrit are distinctly observable, as we have seen, insome of the Inscriptions of Aśoka, in which it would be absurdto suppose an artificial language was used.</p>
<p>And how, if they were not popular dialects, could the idea ofusing them for women and the inferior characters in dramaticplays have in the first place arisen ? That a poet should makecertain persons in his work speak their peculiar dialect, especiallywhen that is an inferior dialect and likely to create mirth, is</p>
<p>natural, and this device is resorted to by writers in all countries.But it was probably more from considerations of propriety thanliveliness that these languages began to be used by Sanskritdramatists. For they are no less particular about such proprieties,and of even the so-called unities, than other nations. For one ofthe rules of the Art is that one act chould not contain the eventsof more than a day. Similarly the minute directions about theuse of certain Prakrit dialects in the case of certain persons areexplicable only on the supposition that the original idea was torepresent in the dramaa state of things actually existingin the world. For these varied reasonsthese varied reasons it admits of noquestion whatever that the Prakrits of the poets and of thegrammarians were really at one time spoken languages. But itis of course not meant that they were spoken just as we find them written, or that they were necessarily spoken at the time whenthe poets that used thom flourished.</p>
<p>The Prakrits became literary and dead dialects as Sanskrititself had before them, and, as already remarked, they may beused for literary purposes aven now, if one wishes to do so. Thedistinction between the written Prakrits and the corresponding spoken Prakrits cannot be greater than the usual distinctionbetween the language of books and that of ordinary life; andprabably the Prakrits of some of our early plays represent thevernaculars of the time faithfully. I must not omit to mentionthat Mr. Beames has considerably modified his opinion since hewrote the article from which the above extract is taken, for in thebeginning of the Introduction to his Comparative Grammar hespeaks of the Prakrits as spoken languages, and attempts toaccount for the use of so many in the dramatic plays instead ofsetting it down to a mere fancy.</p>
<p>We will next proceed to consider the views that have been putforth, opposed to the conclusions we have arrived at, as regardsthe relation between Sanskrit and the Prakrits and endeavourto determine that relation more definitely than we have done.Professor Weber believes that in the Vedic times there wereseveral dialects, and that by a fusion of these a common languagecalled the Sanskrit was formed, while at the same time thedialects ran on their course and formed the Prakrits. He says:—</p>
<p>&ldquo;I incline to the opinion of those, who deny that the Sanskrit Bhāṣā,properly so called, was ever the common spoken language of thewhole Aryan people, and assign it to the learned alone. Just asour modern High German, arising out of the ancient dialects ofthe Germans, reduced what was common to all to universal rulesand laws, and by the power of analogy obliterated all recollectionsof varieties; and just as, on the other hand, these dialects whilethey gradually degenerated often preserved at the same timefuller and more ancient forms; so also the Vedic dialects becamepartly combined in one stream, in which their individual existencewas lost, and so formed the regular Sanskrit Bhāṣā, and partlyflowed on individually on their own original (Prākṛta) irregularforce, and continued to be the idioms of the different provincesin the corruption of which they participated. The Sanskritlanguage and the Prakrit dialects had, therefore, a common andsimultaneous origin; the latter did not spring out of the former.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Professor Weber gives a few instances of Prakritised Sanskritwords from the Vedic dialect, as he calls it, to show that thedevelopments of the Prakrits began then, but nearly all of theseare from such works as the Upaniṣads, which must be assigned toa very late period when the language was in that confusionwhich we find in the Buddhistic Gāthās.</p>
<p>Now if the development of Sanskrit and the Prakrits wascontemporaneous, how comes it that almost all the words andgrammatical forms in these latter dialects are manifest corruptionsof Sanskrit words and forms? Professor Weber&rsquo;s theory does notaccount for this fact, but this defect is supplied by Mr. Beames,who holds nearly the same view as the Professor. He says:— &ldquo;Theidea of a common language is the creation of modern times, andthe effect of the spread of literature.&rdquo; &ldquo;The most probablehypothesis is, that the Aryans from the earliest times spoke manydialects, all closely akin, all having the same family likeness andtendencies common to all. perhaps in every case mutuallyintelligible, but still distinct and co-existent.&rdquo; In a note we aretold that this is probable but cannot be proved. The dialect ofVedic hymns was, he says, only one of these. Then &ldquo;after a timethe Brahmaṇs consciously and intentionally set themselves tothe task of constructing a sacred language, by preserving and</p>
<p>reducing to rule the grammatical elements of this Vedic tongue.&ldquo;&ldquo;They seized on the salient features of Aryan speech as containedin all dialects, and moulded them into one harmonious whole.&ldquo;They (the popular dialects) were anterior to Sanskrit, contemporary with it, and they finally survived it. Nevertheless, Sanskrit,is older than the dialects. This sounds like a paradox, but it istrue in two senses; first, that &ldquo;as ages rolled on, the vulgardialects went on developing into new forms, while Sanskritremained fixed and fossilized for ever.&ldquo;The second is that&quot;though Panini, who is credited with this feat of constructing theSanskrit language, lived when the early dialects were muchchanged, still among the Brahmans there was a traditionalmemory of the ancient and then obsolete forms of many words&hellip; In teaching his pupils the true principles of speech, Päṇini wouldnaturally use these archaic words in preference to the corruptionscurrent around him, and thus the language which he, to a certainextent, created, was in great part a resuscitation of antiquatedterms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To be able to estimate the views of these writers at their trueworth, it is necessary that we should try to fix the meaning of theword dialect, which is the source of some confusion and endeavourto form some idea of the origin and growth of dialects generallyIf little differences are to be regarded as sufficient to constitute adialect, there are as many dialects as human beings. For just asno two human faces ars exactly alike, no two men speak exactlyalike. Every one has his peculiarities of pronunciation, and isfond of particular words or turns of expression. The principleof individuality is strong in human nature, but its effects arecounteracted by the principle of community, which guides thedevelopment of human life; and the necessity of communicationcompels a man to drop peculiarities in speech and to conform himself to the prevailing model. Thus then, the individual differencescome to be minute and insignifiant, and hence the language ofa community becomes practically one language. But, constitutedas communities generally, but not necessarily, are, they arecomposed of classes; and there is not as much communicationbetween separate classes as within the limits of a class, andhence there come to be class languages, or varieties of speech in</p>
<p>the same community. There may be auch classes, but thesmaller ones may be neglected and we may distinguish betweentwo large ones, generally called the lower and the higher, or theuneducated and educated classes. The languages of these differ,that of the lower class being more subject to those laws of development, growth, or corruption which I traced in the first lecture.Thus an uneducated Englishman uses many such forms as &ldquo;Iknowed,&rdquo; &ldquo;you says, formed upon the prevailing analogies; andhis pronunciation of a good many words is corrupt, as &ldquo;genlman&quot;for &ldquo;gentleman,&rdquo; &ldquo;wot&rdquo; for &ldquo;what,&rdquo; &ldquo;guvner&rdquo; for &ldquo;governor,&rdquo; &amp;c. And in the same way the language of the Marathi, Gujarati orHindi lower classes is not the same as that of the higher. Butstill the word dialect is not used in speaking of these two varieties,one principal reason being that the language of the lower classesis not acknowledged to have an independent existence.</p>
<p>Again, when a community comes to have a literature, thestyle that is used, as a rule, differs from the ordinary conversational style. There are certain words, turns of expression,modes of construction, and even solitary forms which, thoughused in conversation, do not appear in books. Even these twovarieties are not called dialects. The dialects of a languagetherefore or kindred dialects, as they may be called, are thelanguages of kindred communities, which, while they possess alarge body of common words and forms, have also many others.which are different, though in most cases the roots from whichthese are derived are common to all. And according to theproportion in which the similar and dissimilar elements are mixed,the dialects are more or less distant from each other.</p>
<p>The causes that divide men into distinct communities are thecauses that create distinct dialects. The laws of change anddevelopment are always in operation in a language, in a changingcondition of society, and the processes of destruction or disappearance of old words and forms and the construction or appearanceof new ones, are constantly going on. Hence, when after theseparation of men into distinct communities, communicationbetween them is lessened, these processes go on in a varied anddissimilar manner. The conditions of life in their new</p>
<p>habitations may also be different, and when they are so, theybring about a varied linguistic development. But though theprocesses of destruction and construction are always going on ina language, they suppose that the society, whose language it is,is moving and not stationary. The life of a community may,however, be even and unvaried, in which case there will be littlechange in its language. Or certain races may be very conservative, and cling to the past with tenacity. Thus the Lithuanianpeasants of the present day have through a number of ages,though they possess nothing like a literature, preserved a goodmany old Aryan words and forms in a purer condition than alltheir European neighbours. So that even after men are dividedinto distinct communities it is by no means necessary thatdistinot dialects should grow up. They may or they may not.But the possibility of slight difference, such as those whichexist in the speech of the different classes of a community, evenwhen the dialect is the same, is not denied.</p>
<p>Now, if for the various reasons above indicated dialects havecome into existence, these continue until by the development ofcivilisation and by political events kindred communities cometo form a nation; and then by increased communication and thegrowth of a common literature these dialects are fused together,and one harmonious language is formed; though, however, inremote quarters they may continue to have an independentexistence. The writerswhom I have quoted pay exclusiveattention to this fact, of which there are several instances inmodern European history, the most notable of which is the development of the modern German; and lay it down as a universalproposition which requires no proof, that in an early condition ofsociety there must be a plurality of dialects, and that there couldbe no such thing as a common language.</p>
<p>This seems to be the opinion of Professor Max Mūller also.But if there was not one common original dialect, whence are thecommon portion of the words and forms of kindred dialects, andthe common roots derived? And does not comparative philologyitself, in its comparisons and classifications, go upon the assumption that there was such a language? Thus then, since thecreation of dialects depends on causes and the causes may not</p>
<p>exist, it will not do to assume that there were several dialects inVedic times without positive proof or even positive indications.Several independent Aryan communities or tribes may not havemigrated into India, but only one. Or even if more than onetribe came over, they may have been, like Lithuanian peasants,very conservative as regards their language. The circumstanceswe know about the language of the period do not necessitate thesupposition of a plurality of dialects.</p>
<p>Besides, if according to Professor Weber these originallyexisting dialects went on in their own isolated course as theidioms of different provinces, and became the Pali and the Prakrits,we should expect to find much greater divergences between them,produced in the course of the many centuries that elapsed betweenthe Vedic period and that in which they were as we now findthem. But the distinction between the dialects of the Inscriptionsof Aśoka and even between the different Prakrits is by no means.great, and concerns chiefly the pronunciation of individual letters.The pleaof linguistic conservatism which I have before used ina certain case cannot be brought in here, since those earlydialects resembling the language of the Vedas, as they must havedone if they existed, were already very greatly corrupted inpassing into the Pali or the Prakrits. Surely such very extensivechanges as from the Vedic to the Prakrit form, if carried on indifferent provinces by different communities, must occasion verygreat divergences, greater even than we find between the modernVernaculars. For the degree of departure from the old Prakrits.which these last exhibit is not so great as that which the Prakriisdo from the Vedic dialect. The divergence ought to be at leastas great, but it certainly is not so.</p>
<p>Now, the way in which the supposed contemporaneous development of Sanskrit and the Prakrits is accounted for by Mr. Beamesis, as we have seen, this:— That the Prakrits arose by a naturaldevelopment while Sanskrit was created by the Brahmans, andprincipally by Päṇini, out of the Vedic dialect and the salient points of Prakrit speech, and by a resuscitation of antiquated terms.Hence it contains the old words and forms from which those inthe Prakrits are derived. And this also accounts for the existenceof what Mr. Beames calls an Aryan but non-Sanskriticelement</p>
<p>in the Prakrits, by which he probably means either those fewforms that are not found in classical Sanskrit but must bereferred to the Vedic dialect, or others that must be Aryan,though not found either in Classical or Vedic Sanskrit. Of thelatter there are almost no instances which may be regarded asbeyond the possibility of doubt.</p>
<p>But such a theory is calculated to bring relief to a puzzledphilologist who, not knowing to what Sanskrit word to trace anyPrakrit or Vernacular word, will at once get out of the difficultyby putting it down as an Aryan word not found in Sanskrit.But how is it possible to create such a language as the Sanskritout of the elements indicated by Mr. Beames? A literary style,as distinguished from a conversational style, is what one canunderstand, but a language which never had anything tocorrespond to it in ordinary vernacular speech, but is simplycreated, is inconceivable. And if the creation of a sacredlanguage was the conscious and deliberate aim of the Brahmans,and Pāṇini resuscitated old or obsolete words, why did they orhe not include in the new language all the innumerable oldobsolete Vedic words and grammatical forms, which would have,from the very reverence that was paid to the Vedas, renderedtheir invention more sacred; and why should they, instead ofdoing so, have distinguished between a Chāndasa or Vedic, andBhāṣa or popular, speech? And, if the inventors seized all thesalient features of the popular dialects, would they have left afew but striking Vedic peculiarties in the popular speech, such asthe absolutive <strong>त्वान</strong> in <strong>तून</strong> or, unrepresented in their new language?And how could they from the popular dialects, in which theconjugations and declensions wereand declensions were reduced to fewer types,construct the innumerable forms of the Sanskrit noun or verb,Perfects, Aorists and the lost tenses or moods? And whatmust have been the basis of the incalculable Taddhita or nominal,and Kṛt or verbal derivatives, which have left but few traces inthe Prakrits? Even the Vedio dialect is not calculated to affordmuch help. For if the grammar of the later Sanskrit had beenframed by the conscious inventors upon the model of the Vedio,the declensions, conjugations, and the derivatives would have beenlike the Vedic; whereas, as a matter of fact, the differences aregreat, and some of these I pointed out in the first lecture.</p>
<p>There remains the third alternative, that there was a traditional memory of these forms. But why should they have beencommitted to memory when there was no motive ? The sacredformulas which Mr. Beames says were orally transmitted do not,if they were the same as those that have come down to us,contain a large number of such forms; and, if they were different,they are simply imaginary. And, though the Vedas were andare committed to memory, the literally incalculable number ofcase forms, verbal forms, Taddhitas, and Kṛdantas, in the absenceof any general rules which were laid down afterwards, as thetheory supposes, by the grammarian-creators of the languages, itis thoroughly impossible to commit to memory, —impossible, asthe great author of the Mahābhāṣya says, even for Indra, withBṛhaspati for his teacher and a thousand celestial years duringwhich to learn them. Of course it is a different thing when theyare current in a language which one learns from one&rsquo;s childhood,though even in this case very few know all the words and formswhich are current in their own country, and nearly all only suchas they are immediately concerned with. And what is theevidence for the truth of this theory? Absolutely none is given.It is simply the vague feeling of an individual or individuals,and not a conclusion arrived at after a deliberate weighing ofevidence; while it sets at naught the clearest evidence availablein the works of the grammarians themselves, which I shallpresently adduce.</p>
<p>The theory, therefore, is utterly untenable, and the contemporaneous development of Sanskrit and the Prakrits derived from it,to account for which it was invented, is an impossibility.</p>
<p>Professor Aufrecht, though he does not believe in a pluralityof Vedic dialects, derives the Prakrits from the Vedic languageand assigns Sanskrit to schools of the learned, but does notexplain its genesis. Those who believe the Vernacular dialectsto be derived directly from the Vedic must explain the origin ofClassical Sanskrit in some such way as Mr. Beames has done;there is no other way.</p>
<p>Dismissing feelings which we have been considering so long,we will for a time examine the reason or reasons that are given</p>
<p>for doubting the derivation of the Pali and the Prakrits fromSanskrit. Thus Professor Childers, in the preface to his PaliDictionary, states the relations between Sanskrit and Pali in thefollowing lucid manner :—</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we compare Pali with classical Sanskrit, we find that abouttwo-fifths of the vocabulary consists of words identical in formwith their Sanskrit equivalents, as Nāga, Buddha, Nidāna.Nearly all the remaining words present a more or less late orcorrupte form …Words of the above two classes nearly exhaustthe Pali vocabulary; but their remains a small though importantresiduum of forms distinctly older than Sanskrit, and found onlyin the oldest known Sanskrit, that of the Vedas. Nay, I do notfeel sure that Pali does not retain a few precious relics older thanthe most ancient Sanskrit, and only to be explained through theallied Indo-Germanic languages. It results from all this thatPali cannot be derived from Sanskrit; both, though mostintimately connected, being independent corruptions of the lost.Aryan speech which is their common parent; but that Pali is onthe whole in a decidedly later stage than Sanskrit, and, to adopta metaphor popularised by Max Mūller, stands to it in therelation of a younger sister.&rdquo; Then in a foot-note he gives theseVedio forms in the Pali :the infinitive in <em>tave</em>, as kātava&quot;fordoing,&rdquo; the absolutive or gerund in <em>tvāna</em>, as katvāna &ldquo;havingdone.&rdquo; These two terminations, however, occur only occasionally,the usual ones are the Sanskrit <em>tum</em> and <em>tvā</em>, The next two,<em>imassa</em>, genitive singular of <em>ageṃ</em>, and gonum, genitive plural of<em>go</em> &ldquo;a cow,&rdquo; I consider as made up by false analogy, as I havealready indicated; <em>tinnam</em>, genitive plural of <em>tri</em>, is similar. Then<em>vidū</em> from <em>vid</em>to know and meaning &ldquo;one who knows;&rdquo; divo,which is masculine in the Veda and in the Pali, while it isfeminine in Sanskrit; the Imperative first person plural in āmaseas in yamāmase, &ldquo;I shall or may restrain&rdquo; kasāmase, &ldquo;I shall ormay plough;&rdquo; the Imperfect akāof karoti from the Vedic akat.Pali has the Vedic I, but this is a sound natural under certaincircumstances, since we have it in Marathi and Gujarati, andkuham corresponding to the Vedio kuha. The Vedic Instrumentalplural termination of nouns in <strong>अ</strong>is retained in the Pali and alsocorrupted to ehi. Professor Childers, however, thinks it is</p>
<p>corrupted from the Sanskrit ablative bhyas. I agree with thosewho derive it from the Vedic affix. To these may be added thethe Prakrit <strong>कुणइ</strong> &ldquo;he does,&rdquo; in which there is a remnant of thefifth conjugation, while the root belongs to the eighth class; andalso the affix <strong>त्तण</strong>of abstract nouns, while it is <strong>त्व</strong> in ordinarySanskrit. Prakrit possesses <strong>तूण</strong> or <strong>ऊण</strong> corresponding to the Pali<strong>त्वान</strong> or <strong>तून</strong> and the instrumental affix <strong>एहि</strong>.</p>
<p>Then in another note Professor Childers gives the Pali garu&quot;heavy&rdquo; or &ldquo;great&quot;while Sanskrit has <strong>गुरु</strong>, though the <strong>गर</strong> appearsin the Sanskrit comparative and superlative forms <strong>गरीयस्</strong> and<strong>गरिष्ठ</strong>. The <strong>अ</strong>is seen in the Greek word Barus and Latin gravis.The Potential <strong>अस्स</strong> &ldquo;let him be,&rdquo; is also said not to have anythingto correspond to it in Sanskrit; but it may be traced to the Vedicsubjunctive or <strong>लेट्, असत्</strong>, or regarded as a corruption of <strong>अस्यात्</strong> forSanskrit <strong>स्यात्</strong>, the <strong>अ</strong>though dropped in Sanskrit being broughtover by analogy from the singular of the other tenses. He alsogives <strong>इध</strong>, while Sanskrit has <strong>इह</strong>, which is doubtful, and also<strong>सब्बधि</strong> &ldquo;everywhere&rdquo; the <strong>धि</strong>in which corresponds to fi in someGreek words. The Pali <strong>धि</strong>is the locative singular of the root,the instrumental singular of which is preserved in the Sanskrit<strong>धा</strong> in <strong>एकधा</strong>, <strong>पञ्चधा</strong> &amp;c. Of these the Prakrits have <strong>गर</strong> in suchwords as <strong>गरुअ, गारव</strong>, &amp;c., and <strong>इध</strong>.</p>
<p>Here the question is reduced to a point. Two-fifths of thewords in the Pali are pure Sanskrit, the rest are corrupt Sanskrit,while there are about six or seven forms which are lost inClassical Sanskrit but exist in Vedic Sanskrit; and there are one or two which exist in neither. The dialect then from which thePali was corrupted or immediately sprang, granting for a momentthat it was different from the Sanskrit, had two-fifths of its wordsexactly like those in Sanskrit, and the other three-fifths fromwhich the Pali corruptions were derived were also exactly likeSanskrit, but it contained these eight or nine forms whichSanskrit has lost. In other words, Pali itself, if we take theoriginal forms of the corrupt three-fifths of its words intoconsideration, is exactly like Sanskrit but for these nine forms.Is the dialect for this difference to be considered an independent dialect ? Is the distinction enough to entitle the Pali or its</p>
<p>supposed immediate parent to be considered a dialect, that is, alanguage, elaborated, according to the definition given before,from the ancient speech by a community distinct from that whichelaborated the Sanskrit ? If any one thinks it is, he may do so,and regard the Pali as a distinct dialect; but he must for thesame reason consider Surat Gujarati and Ahmedabad GujaratiKonkani Marathi and Deccani Marathi or the Marathi, Gujarati,English and any other language as spoken by the uneducatedclasses of the population, and as spoken by the educated, to bedistinct dialects of the same ancient speech. In the samecommunity, as I have observed, varieties of speech may or doprevail and must prevail, but the distinction between them isnot enough to constitute them distinct dialects; wherefore.Sanskrit and the immediate parent of the Pali or the uncorruptPall must be considered as one language, even though the lattercontained a few more ancient forms, and if both were one, thePali must be regarded as the daughter of Sanskrit and not itssister. Some of its few peculiarities it may have derived from thespoken variety of Sanskrit, and the rest from that in use amongthe inferior classes. It often happens that the lower classessometimes retain an old word or form after it has been given upby those above them, whence it is likely that the Pali wascorrupted from the language of those classes. And as a matterof fact it was for a long time the speech of the uneducated, aswill be presently shown. These observations apply to the laterPrakrits also; wherefore, if these derived languages were spoken,that from which they were derived, i. e., Sanskrit, must havebeen a spoken language also.</p>
<p>And, independently of this consideration, there is positive evidence that Sanskrit was a spoken language. Yāska in the Niruktafrequently refers to the Vedic dialect and to another called Bhāṣā,the peculiarities of which mentioned by him are observable inClassical Sanskrit. Pāṇini in his Grammar gives a good manyrules which are exclusively applicable to the dialect of the Vedas,to which he refers by using the words Chandas, Nigama, Mantraand Brāhmṇa, and others which are applicable to the Bhāṣāalone,but by far the largest number of his Sūtras have reference to both.Now, since Bhāṣā, or the ordinary Sanskrit, is thus distinguished</p>
<p>from the dialect of the Vedas, it must be the language in use atthe time when these writers lived. &ldquo;Bhāṣā,&rdquo; as used by them,is a proper name, but in later Sanskrit it acquired a genericsignification and meant language generally. The root from which the word is derived, signifies &ldquo;to speak,&rdquo; wherefore the originalsense of the word as a proper noun must have been the &ldquo;speech&quot;or &ldquo;the spoken language.&rdquo; And, because this was its signification, it afterwards came to denote &ldquo;explanation.&rdquo; When we askfor an explanation of something that is obsoure and unintelligible,what we mean is that the sense should be expressed to us in theordinary language of men, a language that we can understand.Thus such a sentence as <strong>स्थितप्रज्ञस्य का भाषा</strong>,means &ldquo;what is theVernacular of <strong>स्थितप्रज्ञ</strong>,&rdquo; an expression similar to &ldquo;what is theEnglish of it ?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pāṇini refers certain points expressly to popular usage. Hesays that the names of countries are conventional, and no grammatical analysis should be given of them, because it is fictitious;these should be used as we find them used. Similarly he saysgrammarians should not make rules to teach such things as these:—That the two words of a compound express the thing denoted bythe principal word as qualified by the sense of the subordinateword; as for instance, <strong>राजपुरुष</strong>, a compound of <strong>राजन्</strong> &ldquo;a king&rdquo; and<strong>पुरुष</strong>&ldquo;a man,&rdquo; does not denote &ldquo;a king,&rdquo; but &quot; a man, and not&quot;man&rdquo; <em>alone</em> but as <em>connected with a king</em>, i. e. a king&rsquo;s man orofficer and that the base and the termination express the sense ofthe termination as qualified by that of the base;as <strong>औपगव</strong> signifiesnot <strong>उपगु</strong>but a child, and not a child <em>alone</em> but a child as <em>connectedwith</em><strong>उपगु</strong>i. e. Upagu&rsquo;s child. For the significations of words areto be learnt from usage.</p>
<p>In the introduction to the Mahābhāṣya Patañjali tells us thatsome persons in his or Kātyāyana&rsquo;s time considered the study ofgrammar to be unnecessary. For said they, &ldquo;Vedic words orforms we know from the Veda, and those current in popular usagefrom that usage; grammar is useless.&ldquo;Now the grammar whichis thus declared useless is the grammar both of the Vedic andClassical Sanskrit; and the depreciators of the science profess toderive a knowledge of the first dialect from the Vedic books, andof the second not from other books but from popular usage. Hence</p>
<p>Sanskrit must have been in the time of those two grammariansa spoken language.</p>
<p>Similarly in the passage from the same work which I placedbefore you in the first lecture, you will remember that the objector(or Pūrvapakṣin) argues that, since usage is the authority uponwhich the grammarians go, certain verbal forms which are nolonger used by people ought not to be taught by the grammarions,and says that instead of those verbal forms participles are employed. The principal teacher (Siddhāntin) does not deny thefacts, but refers the objector to the vast literature of the language,where he may find them used, though obsolete at the time. It isevident from the whole passage, that Sanskrit was then a spokenlanguage though some of its verbal forms had fallen into desuetude. I have also shown that the language was considerablychanged between the times of Pāṇini and Kātyāyans, and havecalled the Sanskrit that prevailed when Pāṇini and Yāska flourished Middle Sanskrit, and that which was current in the timeof Kātyāyana, Classical Sanskrit. Now these changes from theone form to the other could not have taken place if the languagehad been dead or petrified into a merely literary language.</p>
<p>I am at a loss to see why some scholars should find it sodifficult to belive that Sanskrit was a vernacular. If its declensions and conjugations are considered too complicated for thelanguage of everyday life, it must not be forgotten that sucha fact did not prevent the ancient languages of Europe from becoming spoken languages. And this objection would do equallywell against the Vedic dialect, which or others like which, areregarded as the vernaculars of their times, and which are richerin inflexions than the later Sanskrit. Then it is held that theartificial regularity of Sanskrit makes it improbable that it shouldhave been a vernacular. Where is this artificial regularity ? Onthe contrary, it is the absence of regularity that renders its grammar so difficult and complicated. There is a freedom in thechoice of words, expressions, and forms. In every department ofits grammar there are innumerable optional forms;nouns andverbal roots are often declined and conjugated in several ways.One same root in a good many cases forms its special tenses inmore ways than one, and in the nominal derivatives, the verbal</p>
<p>derivatives, the formation of the feminine and the uses of casesand tenses there is a freedom which some may consider a license.The only difference is, that Sanskrit has had the most perfectgrammarians in the world, who observed all the facts of theirlanguage and laid them down as unchangeable fact, and it is thiswhich gives that language a stiffened appearance.</p>
<p>Then Saṁdhis or euphonic combinations of letters, whichare necessary in Sanskrit, are regarded as inconsistent with thecharacter of a spoken language. It is, however, not denied thatsuch combinations are observable in all languages, and particularly so in Latin and Greek; but it is urged that in Sanskritthere is a regularity or universality about them which is notfound anywhere else. It should not, however, be forgotten thatSaṁdhi in the same word and the same compound, and of a preposition with a root is alone necessary. Between different wordsit is optional, which means that it was on occasions neglected.Now Saṁdhi in the same word is necessary by a law of nature.The Sanskrit does not allow a hiatus; and this is a characteristicof most of the modern idioms also. Some languages, such as ourPrakrits and the old languages of Europe, tolerate it. But theeuphonic combination of consonants in the same word is necessory even in Latin; as in rex=reg-s, scriptus scrib-tus,cinctum=cing-tum, lectum=leg-tum, tractum from traho, thoughthe h like the Sanskrit <strong>ह</strong> stands for an original gh; d and t combine to form an s, as defendo, defensum; sedeo, sessum; claudo,clausum; &amp;c. Prepositions are really parts of words, and henceby the same law, they also must form one harmonious sound withthe initial letter of the word to which they are attached; andmodern vernaculars have got corruptions of the combined words,which shows that they must have been used in those forms in thecolloquial Sanskrit; thus Sk., <strong>पर्यन्त</strong>, Pr. <strong>पल्लट्ट</strong>, M. <strong>पाल</strong>ट; Sk. <strong>प्रत्यभिजाना</strong>,Pr. <strong>पच्चहिआण</strong>, H. <strong>पहिचान</strong>; Sk. <strong>अत्यर्थ</strong>, Pr. <strong>अञ्चट्ट</strong>, M. <strong>अचाट</strong>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Now, as to compounds, this peculiarity of the Sanskrit hasbeen carried to an extravagant extent by later writers, but Päṇiniallows only certain formations of this nature. These grew up asindependent words in the language, and hence in the matter ofSaṁdhi were treated like other words. In the spoken languagethe euphonic combinations we have been considering were not</p>
<p>consciously made, but the words themselves acquired those formsby habitual use in the same manner as in other tongues. Thegrammarians, however, discovered and laid down these rules;and the practice of using them in books even in combininingdifferent words gained ground, though, however, many instancesin which there is no such Saṁdhi are found in the Itihäsasand the Purāṇas. But if in colloquial speech such a combinationwas not possible, the grammarians do not enjoin that it should bemade; and very probably it was not made.</p>
<p>And traces of many expressions, which only a colloquial useof language can generate, have been preserved, not so much inthe literature, as by the grammarians. Such is one expressive ofan intensive or excessive action, composed of the Imperativesecond person form of a root repeated, followed by a verbal formof the same in any tense of the Indicative and in any person ornumber; as <strong>खाद खादेति खादति</strong>, lit. &ldquo;eat, ent, he eats,&rdquo; i. e. eats much,<strong>कुरु कुर्विति करोति</strong> &ldquo;do, do, he does,&rdquo; i. e. does much. This expression exists in Marathi and is considered so colloquial that noMarathi grammarian has noticed it, as <strong>खा खा खातो, कर कर करतो</strong>,inwhich, as in Sanskrit, <strong>खा</strong> and <strong>कर</strong> are forms of the Imperativesecond person singular.</p>
<p>A similar expression is used when several actions are attributed to the same agent; as <strong>ओदनं</strong> <strong>भुङ्क्षसक्तून पिबधानाः खादेत्येवायमभ्यवहरति</strong>&ldquo;Eat rice, drink barely water, devour fried grain, in this wayhe fills his stomach; &quot; which in Marathi is a <strong>भात जेव पेज पी लाह्या खा असें पोढ भरतो</strong>.In this case the Indicative should signify a generalaction of which the Imperatives denote the species, and we mayhave here <strong>करोति</strong> &ldquo;does instead of <strong>अभ्यवहरति</strong>.</p>
<p>Similarly those innumerable expressions consisting of a formmade up by adding <strong>अम्</strong>, technically <strong>णमुल्</strong>, to a root, preceded by anoun, and of a verbal form of the same root must be colloquial;as <strong>हस्तग्राहं गृह्णाति</strong>&ldquo;holds by the hand,&rdquo; <strong>जीवनाशं नश्यति</strong> &ldquo;he perishes,&rdquo;<strong>उदरपूरं भुङ्क्ते</strong>&ldquo;eats o stomachful,&rdquo; <strong>यथाकारमहं भोक्ष्येतथाकारं भोक्ष्येकि तवानेन</strong>&ldquo;I will eat as I eat&rsquo;(as I like), what have you to do with it ?&quot;&amp;c.Etymologically <strong>हस्ताग्राहम्,जीवनाशम्</strong> &amp;c. are accusatives, and theymay in these cases be called cognate accusatives, and the expressions somewhat resemble such ones in English, as &ldquo;run a race,&ldquo;&ldquo;walk a walk, &quot; &ldquo;die a death,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p>The compounds <strong>दण्डादण्डि, केशाकेशि</strong>&amp;c., meaning &ldquo;a scuffle inwhich there is a brandishing of sticks and seizing each other bythe hair,&rdquo; and a great many others made up of Imperative formsof verbs,or of a verb and its object, which are used as nouns, areof a nature suited for the purposes of a light conversation; as <strong>अत्रखादतमोदता वर्तते</strong> &rsquo;eat and enjoy is the rule here,&rdquo; <strong>अत्राश्नौतपिबता वर्तते</strong>&quot;&rsquo;eat and drink&rsquo; is the rule here,&rdquo; sengon,&rdquo; <strong>उद्धरोत्मृजा तस्य दानशौण्डीरस्य गृहे</strong>&ldquo;&ldquo;take out and give&rsquo; is what takes place in the house of thatbountiful man,&rdquo;<strong>जहिस्तम्बोयम्</strong>&ldquo;he is one who constantly says,&lsquo;strike the sheafs of corn&rdquo;.<strong>एहिस्वागता वर्तते</strong> &quot; &lsquo;come, welcome to&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p>Sanskrit was not the only language spoken in the times ofKātyāyana and Patañjali. In the Mahābhāṣya there are severalpassages which contain allusions to a dialect arising from a corruption of Sanskrit. Thus, in the comment on the Vārtika: SiddheŚabdārthasaṁbandhe: we are told, with reference to the question, whether words are created or exist of themselves, that Pāṇini&rsquo;srules suppose that they are not created but exist of themselves;and sois the relation between them and the things they denote,i. e. their power of expression, uncreated and self-existent, and, according to another interpretation of the Vārtiks, the thingsalso which words denote are so. How is it known that all theseare self-existent? Because in the affairs of the world or in ordinary life men think of certain things and use words to expressthem; they do not set about producing words before doing so.But this is not the case with those things that are created andself-existent. If a man wishes to do something with an earthernpot, he goes to the house of a potter and says,&ldquo;Make a pot forme, I have to do something by its means.&ldquo;Now, if he has touse words, he does not in the same way go to the house of agrammarian and say, &ldquo;Make words, I want to use them; butimmediately that he thinks of this thing and that he uses words[for expressing them]. Weil then, if words are to be taken fromordinary life [and are not made by grammarians], what is it thatthe Śāstra [grammar] does? &ldquo;The Śāstra lays down a restrictionby observing which a man may attain religious merit. It doeswhat other Śāstras in ordinary life do. Thus, while it is possibleto satisfy hunger by eating anything whatever, it is enjoined that</p>
<p>one shall not est a domesticated fowl or pig; and the object is,that he may by regulating his conduct thus attain religiousmerit. In the same way this Śāstra (grammar) tells us that,while it is possible to express one&rsquo;s meaning by using correctwords or incorrect words, correct ones alone which it teachesshould be used to secure the religious merit arising therefrom.&ldquo;After this follows the discussion translated in the first lecture;and then we have another of which the following is a portion:—</p>
<p>PŪRV. Does religious merit arise from a knowledge of correctwords or from their use ?</p>
<p>SID. What is the difference ?</p>
<p>PŪRV. If you say religious merit arise from their knowledge,religious de-merit also must arise. For he, who knows what wordsare correct, also knows what words are incorrect. If merit resultsfrom the knowledge of those that are correct, demerit must resultfrom the knowledge of those that are incorrect. Or greater de-meritmust arise [from their knowledge], as the number of incorrectwords is larger, and that of correct words smaller. For the corruptions of one correct word are manifold; as, for instance, the corruptions of the correct word <strong>गो</strong> are <strong>गावी, गोणी, गोता</strong>, <strong>गोपोतलिका</strong> &amp;c.And the Ṛṣi also indicates (in a passage which is quoted) thatthe restriction as to correct words concerns their use [and notknowledge].</p>
<p>SID. Well, then, let it be that religious merit arises fromtheir use [and not from knowledge ].</p>
<p>PŪRV. If from their use, the whole world would obtainheavenly folicity.</p>
<p>SID. And now why should you be jealous if the whole worldobtain heavenly felicity ?</p>
<p>PŪRV. No, certainly, I am not jealous. But what I mean is,that it thus becomes useless to make any effort; such effort onlyas is fruitful should be made. If you get the fruit without anyeffort, the effort is useless. [The effort meant is that involved in the study of grammar, i. e, of correct words. People use somecorrect words at least without studying grammar, and, if eternalfelicity results from the <em>use</em> of such words, they get it withoutmaking the effort of studying the subject ].</p>
<p>SID. Why, verily those who make the effort will largely usecorrect words, and will obtain a large amount of heavenly felicity.</p>
<p>PŪRV. That the fruit does not follow the effort is also an observed fact. For there are persons who though they have madethe effort are seen to be incompetent [in the use of correct words],while others, who have not, are competent; wherefore it is possible, the fruit, i. e. heavenly felicity, may not follow.</p>
<p>SID. Well then, religious merit arises not from knowledgealone, neither from use alone.</p>
<p>PŪRV. From what then ?</p>
<p>SID. Heavenly felicity arises from the use of correct wordswhen it is accompanied by the knowledge, that they are correct,derived from a study of the Śāstra.</p>
<p>And thus it goes on.</p>
<p>Now it is clear from all this that correct words, i. e. Sanskrit,was spoken in those days by all, but that incorrect words had gotmixed up with it, and the object of grammar was to teach howto avoid incorrect words or corruptions, though there were menwho could speak correctly without knowing grammar. And thisis the state in which more or less all languages are at all times;and even at the present day the purpose of grammar is consideredto be to teach how to speak correctly. By the way, it will be seenhow Sanskrit grammariens disilnelly declare that they teach nothing that does not exist, that they do not create words, but separate the correct ones from suoi as are incorrect. But what didPatañjalii consider to he the standard of correct Sanskrit : whowas it that spoke the language correctly, and in whose speechwere corruptions observable ? This is clear from another passage at the beginning of the third pāda of the first chapter of theMahābhāṣya. Patañjali interprets the Sūtra <strong>भूवादयो धातवः</strong>(I. III 1)in a manner to yield such a connotative definition of a dhātu orroot as this, that a dhātu is that which denotes action or being.Then a question is raised, if this is the way to distinguish a rootwhy should a list of roots be given; in other words, if we havegot a connotative definition, a definition by enumeration is notwanted. In this case there is a difference of opinion betweenKātyāyana and Patañjali.</p>
<p>PŪRV. If you have given a connotative definition now, enumeration should not be made, i. e. a list of roots should not begiven.</p>
<p>SID. It should be made.</p>
<p>PŪRV. What for ?</p>
<p>SID. The enumeration of [the verbal roots] bhi and othersshould be made for the purpose of excluding nouns (Prātipadika)and the verbs that begin with <strong>आणपयति</strong>[.e. If the roots are notactually enumerated, nouns also which express action or beingmay come under the the connotative definition. In the same wayit will extend to roots used in ordinary life, which are not Sanskrit, such as <strong>आणपयति</strong> and others].</p>
<p>PŪRV. What verbs are those which begin with <strong>आणपयति</strong> ?</p>
<p>SID. <strong>आणपयति</strong> and <strong>वड्ढति</strong>. And enumeration should alsobe made in order that the anubandhas or indicatory letters andaccents of roots may be made known; <em>i. e.</em> that one may knowwhat the accents and indicatory letters of roots are. It is not possibe to know the accents or indicatory letters unless the rootsare enumerated. [Anubandhas are certain letters attached toroots to denote some, conjugational or other peculiarity belongingto them ].</p>
<p>PŪRV. Now those roots whose accents are capsple of beinginferred. <em>i. e.</em>, are <strong>उदात्त</strong>, and which have no anubandhas, but stillare inserted in the list, may be omitted from it. [i. e. When thoseroots which have the <strong>अनुदात्त</strong> accent are enumerated, it may beinferred that the rest have the other or <strong>उदात्त</strong>accent ].</p>
<p>SID. Even those should be enumerated in order that <strong>आणपयति</strong>and others [i. e., corrupt Sanskrit roots) may be excluded.</p>
<p>Hereupon Patañjali disagrees with Kātyāyans and says:—</p>
<p>PAT. NO, <strong>आणपयति</strong> and others will be excluded, because theusage of the educated or Śiṣṭas is to be followed. This usage ofthe Śiṣṭas must be necessarily referred to in other cases even;for instance, in order to exclude the altered forms of those rootsthat are enumerated. For in ordinary life they use <strong>कसि</strong>for <strong>कृषि</strong>and <strong>दिसि</strong>for <strong>दृशि</strong>. [The sense is, that since in grammar we followthe usage of the Śiṣṭas or educated, these verbs <strong>आणपयति, वट्टति</strong></p>
<p>and <strong>बड्ढति</strong>, and also <strong>कसि</strong> for <strong>कृषि</strong> and <strong>दिसि</strong> for <strong>दृशि</strong> which sre notused by them, will necessarily be excluded from our connotativedefinition; hence for the purpose of excluding them enumerationis not wanted].</p>
<p>Now <strong>आणपयति</strong> is a corruption of the Sanskrit <strong>आज्ञापयति, वट्टति</strong>of <strong>वर्तते,</strong> and <strong>वट्ठति</strong>of <strong>वर्धते, ते</strong> Ātm. being replaced by <strong>ति</strong>Parasm., and<strong>कम्</strong> for <strong>कृष्</strong>, and <strong>दिम्</strong>for <strong>दृश्</strong>. These and such other corruptionswere in use at the time, but Patañjali clearly lays down that theywere not used by the Śiṣṭas or educated people, and thereforethey belonged to the language of the vulgar. Now all these rootsare found in the Pali in these very forms, <strong>आणपयति</strong>being, however, <strong>आणापयति</strong>; but the reading in the MSS. and the Benareslithographed edition which I have consulted is faulty. So alsoof the corruptions of the word <strong>गो</strong>given by our author, we find<strong>गावी</strong> in Professor Childers&rsquo;s Pali Dictionary, and <strong>गोण</strong>the masculine of <strong>गोणी</strong>. Thus our grammarians recognise one language only,the Sanskrit, and these words and forms which are found in thePali they assign to the speech of the vulgar.</p>
<p>In another passage still we are told more definitely who theŚiṣṭas were that spoke the Sanskrit language correctly withoutstudying Pāṇini&rsquo;s grammar, and whose usage was the standardof correctness. Pāṇini&rsquo;s Sūtra VI. III, 109, lays down that suchwords as <strong>पृषोदर</strong>should be regarded as correct in the form in whichthey are upadiṣṭa, i. e, used or uttered; the changes in them suchas the elision, or augmentation, of letters or the alteration oftheir forms do not obey any general rules laid down by him, butstill the words exhibiting those changes should be taken as correct, just as they are used. Now the Pūrvapakṣin raises thequestion :—</p>
<p>PŪRV. What is meant by upadiṣṭa ?</p>
<p>SID. Uttered (used).</p>
<p>PŪRV. How does it come to mean that ?</p>
<p>SID. The root &lsquo;dis&rsquo; signifies &lsquo;uttering&rsquo;. One utters (uses),letters, and says that they are thus upadiṣṭa.</p>
<p>PŪRV. By whom upadiṣṭa(uttered or used) ?</p>
<p>SID. By the Śiṣṭas.</p>
<p>PŪRV. Who are the Śiṣṭas ?</p>
<p>SID. The grammarians.</p>
<p>PŪRV, How so ?</p>
<p>SID. The character of a Śiṣṭa is conferred upon one by theknowledge of the science (Śāstra):and the grammarians know thescience [of grammar].</p>
<p>PŪRV. If a man is made Śiṣṭa by the science, and the sciencedepends upon a man&rsquo;s being Śiṣṭa, this is reasoning in a circle.An argument in a circle does not hold. [The circle is, one is Śiṣṭa,and consequently an authority in matters of language if he hasstudied grammar and grammar itself depends on the usage ofthe Śiṣṭa.]</p>
<p>SID. Well, then, the character of a Śiṣṭa is conferred uponone by the country in which he lives and by his conduct. Thatsort of conduct must be associated with residence in Āryāvartaalone (lit. that sort of conduct must be in Āryāvarta alone).</p>
<p>PŪRV. Which is Āryāvarta ?</p>
<p>SID. The country which is to the east of the Ādarśa, west ofKālkavans, south of the Himālaya, and north of the Pāriyātra.Those Brahmans in this country of the Āryas who do not store upriches (lit. who keep only so much grain as la contained in a jar).who are not greedy, who do good disinterestedly, and who withoutany effort are conversant with a certain branch of knowledge arethe worshipful Śiṣṭas.</p>
<p>PŪRV. If, then, the Śiṣṭas are an authority as regards language, what function does the Aṣṭādbyāyī(Pāṇini&rsquo;s grammar)perform ?</p>
<p>SID. The purpose of the Aṣṭādbyāyī is to enable us to findout the Śiṣṭas.</p>
<p>PŪRV. How is it possible to find out the Śiṣṭas by means ofthe Aṣṭādbyāyī ?</p>
<p>SID. A student of the Aṣṭādbyāyī finds a man who has notstudied the book using words just as they are taught in theAṣṭādbyāyī. He then thinks, &ldquo;Verily, this man possesses somegood luck or innate nature by means of which, though he has not</p>
<p>studied the Aṣṭādbyāyī, he uses words just as they are taught inthat book. Verily he knows other words also &quot; [not taught in theAṣṭādbyāyī, such as <strong>पृषोदर</strong>]. Thus, the purpose of the Aṣṭādbyāyīis to enable one to find out who is a Śiṣṭa [in order that he mayrefer to him and learn such words as do not obey the rules laiddown by Pāṇini, but still are correct].</p>
<p>Here then we have the clearest possible evidence that Sanskritwas the vernacular of holy or respectable Brahmans of Āryāvartaor Northern India, who could speak the language correctlywithout the study of grammar. The corrupt language mentionedby Patañjali which was composed of correct and incorrect words,that is, a dialect like the Pali, must, therefore, have been thevernacular of the other classes. And this is what you may sayeven with regard to the modern vernaculars. Who is it thatspeaks good or correct Marathi ? Of course, Brahmans of culture. The language of the other classes is not correct Marathi. Theword Śiṣṭa may be translated by &ldquo;a man of education or culture;&ldquo;and this education or culture has, since remote times, been almostconfined to Brahmans.</p>
<p>Thus the dialects of the Inscriptions of Aśoka and the Paliwere the vernaculars of the non-Brahmanic classes; but a greaterimportance must evidently have been attached to them in thetimes of Aśoka than is now assigned to the Marathi of the non-Brahmanic classes, since they are used by him in the Inscriptions.They are, however, not recognized as independent languages byour grammarians who treated them as we treat the Marathi ofthe lower classes; but they were in use and bore the same relationto Sanskrit that low Marathi does to high Marathi, the Englishof the lower classes in England to the speech of the higher. Andthe English of the lower classes contains, as we have seen, agreat many such grammatical forms as &ldquo;I knowed,&rdquo; and &ldquo;yousays, &ldquo;along with others that are correct.</p>
<p>It is on account of the mixture of such correct words and formswith others that were incorrect that the Pali was not regardedas an independent dialect. The case was different with thePrakrits They assumed a more settled and fixed character, andwere used over a larger area, and thus came to be considered and</p>
<p>treated as separate languages. But the propagators of Buddhism,who like all teachers of a new religion, addressed themselves tothe lower or uneducated classes, soon raised this speech intoimportance. They wrote their religious works in it, and in thecourse of time it became their sacred language; but it isunknown in India as an independent tongue. From thesepassages in the Mahābhāṣya, therefore, it is clear that it is by nomeans true, us is generally supposed, that Sanskrit had ceasedto be a spoken language when the Pali arose. The two varietiesof speech existed side by side; but as education and cultureretrograded, the number of Sanskrit speakers gradually decreased,and the lower variety went on spreading itself over a wider areaand developed into the Prakrits.</p>
<p>This contemporaneous existence of the Sanskrit and Pali andthe Prakrits as the spoken languages of two classes of thecommunity explains, and is therefore confirmed by, several factsthat we noticed before. If, when the Pall arose, Sanskrit becamea dead language, it could not influence the grammar of the lowdialects. Though words from a language that has ceased to bespoken may be adopted into a spoken dialect, the grammarremains intact. Even a living language if it is foreign, does notaffect it. But we have seen that the gradual disappearance ofverbal forms is a phenomenon common to both Sanskrit and Paliand that the latter derived some grammatical forms from theformer, which did not possess when they were in the stagerepresented by the Pali. This could not have been the case if thetwo languages, Sanskrit and Pali, bad not existed as two varietiesof the varnaculars of a homogeneous community.</p>
<p>The fact that Sanskrit words are so greatly corrupted as tobe difficult of recognition and are set down as Deśyas by thenative grammarians, while others can easily be traced to theiroriginal forms, also points to the same conclusion. Those thatare greatly corrupted were early adopted into the language, andremoved from subsequent influence. Most of the others, thatexhibit only ordinary changes, are such as denote elementarynotions, and must therefore have been adopted as early as thoseof the first sort. But, because they were such elementary wordsthey were heard again and again in their original forms as used</p>
<p>by the higher classes; and thus a further corruption was prevented; and they exhibit only such changes as were necessitated bythe vocal habits of the Prakrit speakers.</p>
<p>Another fact is the use of Sanskrit for the higher charactersin the plays, and Prakrit for women and the lower ones. Thissupposes that when the idea first originated, and for a considerable period subsequent to it, though not afterwards whendramatic plays were written more according to rule than with aview to exhibit any existing state of things women and personsin a low condition could understand Sanskrit, but not speak it.It was the same with Sanskrit then, as it is with Marathi, forinstance, now. A Citpāvanīor Mālvaṇīwoman speaks in herown dialect when conversing with an educated Marathi butunderstands the standard Marathi that he uses, though she cannotspeak it herself. And this is the case everywhere; a person in alow condition understands what is said to him by one belongingto the higher classes, but cannot himself speak like him, andmust use his own variety of the language. Thus then at thetime when the earliest Sanskrit dramatic plays were written, thatlanguage must have been in vernacular use to such an extentas to be intelligible to uneducated persons. And that educateddramatic characters do actually speak it, shows that those whomthey represent used it in real life. Again, the dramas werecomposed to entertain an audience, and were actually acted. Ifthe audience did not understand Sanskrit, as well as Prakrit, thepoet defeated his own purpose by making some of his charactersspeak in that language.</p>
<p>Sanskrit went on gradually losing ground, the number of thosewho speak it grew smaller and smaller, and after a time it ceasedto be used by anybody for the ordinary concerns of life, thougheven now Paṇḍits carry on their disputations in it. But at alltimes it has been acting the parent to the vernaculars and adorning and enriching them. The ancient Prakrits borrowed everything from it when it was in vernacular use; but the modernPrakrits mostly adopt such words as express abstract notions.There is, however, an apparent difference in the manner in whichthe borrowed words were treated by the Prakrits, and are treatedby the modern dialects. A Sanskrit word when used by</p>
<p>a Prakrit-speaking person was changed according to his habitsof pronunciation; but in modern times it is preserved in a stateof purity. This, however, is due to the fact that in modern timesthe educated classes as well as their uneducated brethren, speakthe vernaculars, and it is the former that pronounce the wordproperly. But the latter, and often women belonging to theformer, corrupt it. Now the Prakrit was, as I have shown, for along time the language of precisely these persons. It is theirpronunciation that is recorded by the Prakrit grammarians andpoets. In some provinces in modern times, even the higher classesmispronounce the Sanskrit words adopted into the vernaculars,and also in reading Sanskrit books. But in the printed booksthe correct orthography is used.</p>
<p>As I have observed in a previous lecture and at the beginningof this, some of the vocal habits of the Prakrit speakers havecome down to their modern descendants: but not all. The lapseof time and other causes have generated other peculiarities.Hence a Sanskrit word in these days is not corrupted in exactlythe same way as in ancient times; and thus we get what arecalled modern Tadbhavas. Thus, then, as the Sindhi and Bengalicannot but pronounce Sanskrit <strong>मोक्ष</strong> as <strong>मोक्ख</strong>,and the Hindustanias <strong>मोछ</strong>,or the average Gujarati, the Sanskrit word <strong>मौन</strong> as <strong>मोक्ष</strong>, and <strong>जैन</strong>as <strong>जेन</strong>, so did his old Prakrit ancestors.</p>
<p>It should be borne in mind that the Prakrit corruption ofSanskrit words were not necessarily caused by their continualuse for a number of ages, but were due in a good many cases tothe vocal peculiarities of the men that used them. Most of thosewords that represent only the ordinary changes are words of thisclass; i. e. the corruptions simply represent, as I have above observed, the transformation which they underwent in the mouthof &amp; Prakrit speaker. At all times Sanskrit words have beencoming into the popular languages; but in old times they were pronounced in a manner natural to the men of these times, andthus became Prakrit words; and now they are pronounced insome cases in the same manner, but in a great many in another,and thus they become modern Tadbhavas; while the educatedclasses often, though not always, pronounce them correctly, and</p>
<p>thus we have modern Tatsamas. This is the way to accountfor the fact that there are so many pure Sanskrit words in ourvernaculars, while there were but a few in the old Prakrits; andwe need not connect their introduction with the expulsion ofBuddhism and the selfish schemes of the Brahmans, with whichit has nothing to do, as is done by one writer.</p>
<p>We will now try to form some idea of the chronology andhistorical causes of the several linguistic changes we have noticed.The Later or Classical Sanskrit is in the same phonetic conditionas the Vedic dialect from which it sprang; and it was for a longsuccession of centuries, spoken by the Indian Aryans. If it wasso, the corruptions observable in the other variety of speech orlow Sanskrit, as it may be called, must have been due to thevocal peculiarities of another race than that which elaboratedthe Classical from the Vedic Sanskrit. The univeral assimilationof conjunot consonants which we observe in the Pali could nothave proceeded from the same community that could speakSanskrit with purity. And such an extensive assimilation wefind in the Italian, which was formed out of the Latin spoken bythe lower classes of the ancient Roman population by the barbarianraces that overran the country. As remarked in the openinglecture, phonetic corruption is rapid and extensive when one.Taco learns and adopts the language of another. The Pali corruptions, therefore, represent the manner in which a foreign racepronounced the Sanskrit of the Aryans. And from such historyas we can glean from Sanskrit Literature, we know that the Aryanrace when it emigrated to India came in contact with other races.After a time some of these were incorporated into the Aryan community, and formed its fourth order, known by the name ofŚūdras. As long as these Sūdras were in thoroughly degradedcondition and remained distinct from the other three orders, theirspeech produced no perceptible effect on that of the latter. Butafter a time this order began to mingle with the rest, principallyby means of inter-marriages, which must have extensively takenplace, since some Smrtis or Indian law-books allow them undercertain circumstances and others prohibit them; so that theorthodox belief of learned Pandits at the present day is that theKṣatriya and Vaiśya orders do not exist, and that all those who</p>
<p>are not Brahmans are Śūdras. But there are indications thateven Brahmanhood did not escape pollution. As this combinationproceeded, the Śūdra corruptions of the language came into preminence, and after a time such a language as Pali became theordinary speech of the uneducated. By the time of Aśoka, wemay suppose, the so-called Aśiṣṭa or uneducated people, who spokethe incorrect, or corrupt language, comprehended among themthe greater portion of the military, trading, and cultivatingclasses. Professor Childers is of opinion that there are no Deśyaor non-Aryan words in the Pali. But the Prakrits do possess someat least, and you will remember that they exhibit other phoneticchanges of which the chief is the elision of consonants. Up tothe time of Aśoka and even to that of Patañjali, these phenomenaare not observable in the popular speech, though they may haveexisted in the speech of the very lowest classes. It, therefore,appears that, when this amalgamated community, with Sanskritand Pali as the two forms of speech prevailing among the higherand the lower classes, spread over different parts of NorthernIndia from the Himālayas to the southern confines of the Marathacountry, they came in contact in the provinces with other raceswhich led to the further corruptions we have been speaking of;and thus the Prakrits were formed. These new races while theyadopted the language of the conquerors gave them a few of theirown words.</p>
<p>Patañjali lived in the middle of the second century before.Christ and king Aśoka in the middle of the third. BetweenPatañjali and Kãtyāyanaa petty long time must have elapsed,since in the Mahābhāṣya various readings or emendations in afew cases of the Vārtikas of the latter are noticed and sometimestheir interpretations as given by other writers; so that a sort ofliterature must have grown round the Vārtikas. I am, therefore, inclined to accept the popular tradition which refers Kātyāyanatothe period of the Nandas, i. e., to about the first quarter of thefourth century before Christ. Now we have seen that in thetime of this grammarian the Sanskrit language assumed adifferent form from that it had in that of Pāṇini; and by thetime of Patañjali very great reverence had come to be paid tothis last author. For in giving the uses of grammar, the author</p>
<p>of the Mahābhāṣya says that it is the duty of a Brähmapa to studythe Vedas along with their Aṅgas or illustrative Śãstras; andof the six Aṅgas grammar is the chief. Patañjali is not likely toyield this honour to any other than Pāṇini&rsquo;s grammar. Toaccount for these and some of the other circumstances noticedby Dr. Goldstūcker, we must place Pāṇini ahout four centuriesbefore Kātyāyana, i. e. refer him to about the 8th century beforeChrist. Yäska must have flourished a short time before him. Though the Pali or an idiom very close to it was the language ofthe uneducated classes in the times of ātyāyans, Aśoka, andPatañjali, still its formation must be dated some centuries earliersince in its verb it represents what I have called Middle Sanskritor the Sanskrit of Yāska and Pāṇini. Yāśka notices local varietiesof Sanskrit words and gives one or two instances, but makes noallusion to any Apabhraṁśas or corruptions, though from thenature of his work he may be expected to do so; while Kātyāyanaand Patañjali mention them frequently, as we have seenif they existed in his time, therefore, they must have beeninsignificant and unimportant, and did not enter into the speechof any class of the Aryan society to any appreciable extent.After his time, however, i. e. about the seventh or sixth centuryB. C., the elaboration of the Pali, or Low Sanskrit as it might becalled, began in a decided manner; and the language continuedto be spoken up to the time of Patañjali. Till then it did notspecifically assume a Prakrit form though in the Inscriptions ofAśoka some of the characteristics of a later Prakrit, the Māgadhī,were developed, as we have seen, in one province, very likelyMagadha itself.</p>
<p>The Prakrits must have begun to be formed about that time,but did not then attain any distinctive character; and thevernacular speech probably did not finally leave the Pali stagetill a very long time afterwards. About the time when theInscriptions in the cave-temples were composed, the Pali was,as I have stated, a sacred and literary language. The longer andmore important of the Inscriptions are therefore in that language.But in a good many of the shorter Inscriptions, especially of private individuals, we have words exhibiting Prakrit characteristics<sup id="fnref:133"><a href="#fn:133" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">133</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The growth of the specifio Prakrits, therefore, must be referredto the early centuries of the Christain era; and we maytherefore infer that about the time our first dramatic plays werewritten they were actually the spoken dialects of those classes ofthe people whose representatives use them in those works,… .</p>
<p>About the sixth or seventh century the Apabhraṁśa wasdeveloped in the country in which the Brajbhäṣäprevails inmodern times; or, if the speeches in that dialect contained in thefourth act of the Vikramorvaśiya were really composed by Kālidāsa, which, as remarked in a former lecture, we have the gravestreasons for doubting, its growth must be assigned to a somewhatearlier period. Daṇḍin mentions the Apabhraṁśa, and a goodmany verses fiom his Kāvyādarśa are found in Vāmana&rsquo;sAlaṁkāravṛtti; and if this be the same Vāmana that lived atthe court of Jayäpiḍa, king of Kāsmir, who reigned from 751A. C. to 782 A. C., Daṇḍin must have flourished before the eighthcentury.</p>
<p>The Modern vernaculars seem to have begun to assume adistinctive character about the tenth century. In the CopperPlate Inseription containing the name of Bhāskarācārya, dated1128 Śaka or 1206 A. C., which I ones mentioned before, Marathisin its specific character, andso also does Hindi in thework of Cand, who flourished about the same time.</p>
<p>And now, gentlemen, I close. It was impossible in the course,of these lectures to do justice to the subject without entering intomatters which are not interesting, except to those who havealready paid some attention to it. Besides, the subject was wideand I was compelled to compress a great many facts into a smallspace, but in spite of this, and though I frequently omitted large,portions of what I had written, the lectures were long and tedious.I am, therefore, obliged to you for the honour you have done meby your presence here, notwithstanding these drawbacks, and mythanks are specially due to those who have attended the coursethroughout.</p>

<p><strong>PREFATORY NOTE</strong></p>
<p>This volume contains a reprint of (i)&rdquo; Vaiṣṇavism, Śaivism, and Minor Religious Systems&quot;included in the <em>Grundriss der Indoarischen Philologie</em> and first published in 1913; and (ii)&rdquo; Wilson Philological Lectures on Sanskrit and the Derived Languages&rdquo; delivered in 1877 and first published in a collected form in 1914. The first work was issued without any Preface. The Preface to the second work is dated, Sangam, Poona, 22nd June, 1914, and is reproduced below:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was appointed Wilson Philological Lecturer in 1877 and was thus the first lecturer under the Endowment. My subject was the Sanskrit and the Prakrit languages derived from it. I understood the Prakrit in a comprehensive sense, so as to include modern Vernaculars of Northern India also; and thus delivered a course of seven lectures on Sanskrit in its several forms, the Pall and the Dialects of the period, the Prakrits and the Apabhramsa, Phonology of the Vernaculars, Remnants of the older Grammatical Forms in the Vernaculars, New Grammatical Formations to supply the place of the forms that had disappeared, and the General Questions as to the relation between these several languages. The method I followed is strictly historical, tracing the modern Vernaculars from the original Sanskrit through all the different stages of development of which we have evidence, and assigning the different transformations to their causes, natural or physical, racial, and historical. These lectures, with the exception of the fifth and sixth, were thoroughly revised afterwards and the first two and the seventh were published in Vol. XVI of the Journal, BBRAS, between the years 1883 and 1885; while the third and the fourth were published between 1887 and 1889. The other two lectures remained in manuscript for a long time, until I finished in 1911 my book on &ldquo;Vaiṣṇavism, Śaivism etc, which was written for the series of Encyclopedia of Indo-Aryan Research, which is being published at Strassburg by Karl J. Trubner. These have now been revised and I publish them for the first time along with a reprint of the five lectures in the present volume. The delay in the publication has been due to my having had to attend to more urgent work, such as the preparation of a translation of the Vāyu Purāṇa for the &ldquo;Sacred Books of the East, which had afterwards to be given up, the preparation of my Early History of the Deccan and the Search for Sanskrit Manuscripts and writing my several Reports on them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As, since 1908, my eye-sight has greatly impaired and I am unable to read mattor printed in ordinary type or an ordinary manuscript, I have had to depend on Readers and Amanuenses. The work on &ldquo;Vaiṣṇavism, Śaivism, etc.&rdquo; was written under these conditions, but the publication of the present volume was undertaken by my eldest son, Professor Shridhar Ramkrishna Bhandarkar, who has been associated with me in a good deal of my literary work. The lectures were all carried through the press by him at the sacrifice of a good deal of time and trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I regret to find some misprints in the present volume, but one-half of them occur in the fifth and the sixth lectures, which had to be set up from manuscript. There are comparatively few instances in the reprints of the other five lectures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Bhandarker&rsquo;s classical work on Vaiṣṇavism, Śaivism, and Minor Religious Systems, being included in a costly German Series of publications, was not easily accessible to students in India, although greatly in demand. Sir Ramkrishna accordingly purchased from Messrs. Walter de Gruyter &amp; Co., Berlin, assign of the firm Karl J. Trubner of Strassburg, the right to issue an <em>Indian Edition</em> of the work, and this right the B. O. R. Institute. has purchased from him. The Indian Edition of the first book was issued separately in 1928. In the present volume it is incorporated along with the Wilson Philological Lectures.</p>
<p>The three Indexes to Vaiṣṇavism Śaivism and Minor Religious Systems were originally compiled by Dr. V. S. Sukthankar, M. A., Ph. D. The same have been retained here with necessary changes in pagination. The Indexes to the Wilson Philological Lectures have been prepared by me.</p>
<p>I was suddenly taken ill by paralysis on Thursday, September 8, 1927, I was unconscious for more than a month, and I am not yet completely recovered, although—thank God—I am slowly. but surely regaining strength. For more than one year, Mr. G. N. Shrigondekar, B. A., of the Publication Department of the Bhandarkar Institute had to do the proof-correction and all other work in connection with this volume. To him and to all friends I am very sincerely thankful for all they did. Recently, I am recommended for Invalid&rsquo;s Pension.</p>
<p>With the present volume, three Volumes of Sir R. G. Bhandarkar&rsquo;s works are now ready. The fourth volume, which however will be the first in order, will be ready next year. It may then be considered whether I may be able to compile a short biography of Sir R. G. Bhandarkar as originally contemplated.</p>
<p>The publication of the present volume in time for the annual literary tribute to be paid by the Bhandarkar Or. R. Institute would not have been feasible in my present invalid state had not the Press and the Publication Departments of the Institute—and especially Dr. V. G. Paranjpe, M. A., LL. B., D. LITT., the Superintendent of both,—come to my assistance. I offer him here my grateful thanks for the assistance, the extent of which cannot be adequately gauged.</p>

<p><strong>VAIṢṆAVISM, ŚAIVISM AND MINOR RELIGIOUS SYSTEMS.</strong></p>
<p>PART I<br>
VAIṢṆAVISM.<br>
<strong>I. Introductory.</strong></p>
<p>§The<sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> old Vedic gods became indissolubly involved in the elaborate and mechanical system of worship that had grown up.Speculations as regards the appropriateness of the rules and modest of worship, and their efficacy as regards man&rsquo;s good in this world and the next, became prevalent. But all this did not satisfy the religious spirit of the people. Religious speculation of a more. natural order came to be established about the close of the Hymnperiod and was continued into that of the Upaniṣads. The various problems about God, man, and the world, engaged the attention of many thinkers, and a variety of solutions was arrived at. It is generally believed that the Upaniṣads teach a system of Pantheism; but a close examination will show that they teach not one, but various systems of doctrines as regards the nature of God, man, and the world and the relations between them. The religio-philosophic systems of modern times, which are mutually inconsistent, quote texts from the Upaniṣads as an authority for their special doctrines. These references to the old books are correct in the most prominent cases, but when the advocates of the systems force into other texts of an opposite nature a meaning consistent with their own special doctrines, they are manifestly wrong. That the Upaniṣads teach not one but various systems must follow. from the fact that they are compilations just as the ṚgvedaSaṁhitāis The speculations of the old, seers were clothed by them in words, and these were handed down orally and came to form a large floating mass. When the idea of collecting these speculations arose, they were incorporated into books for the use of individual Vedic schools. Hence it is that we find certain</p>
<p>verses, passages and whole sections occurring in one Upaniṣad reproduced in another¹.</p>
<p>No doubt, the idea of the immanence of God in the world is very prominent in the Upaniṣads. But if that is what constitutes Pantheism, the liberal religious thought of the present day in Europe also must be regarded as Pantheistic. With the immanence of God is associated his transcendence also, as stated in the Vedānta-Sutra II. 1. 27.In addition to these two doctrines the Upaniṣads teach that God is the protector of all beings, is the lord of all and dwells in the heart of man, that seeing him as he is and everywhere, is eterual bliss; that this is to be attained by contemplation and the purification of the soul, and that in the blissful condition the individual soul attains to a perfect similarity with the supreme soul. They also teach the absorption of the individual soul into the supreme as of a river into the ocean, and the unconsciousness of the soul when everything but. himself fades away from his knowledge. In this respect the doctrine may be regarded as Pantheistic or as setting forth the illusory character of all phenomena. Speculation in the Upaniṣad times was very free, and it veared round even to the denial of the soul as a substance.</p>
<p>In the subsequent development of religious thought and worship, these Upaniṣad doctrines played an active part The Heno-</p>

<p>1.See the passage about the superiority of Prāṇa and other bodily elements which occurs in ChU. (V.1.1) and in BU. (VI. 1. 1): that about the Pañcāgnividyāoccurring in the former (V. 4. 1) and the latter (VI. 2. 9); and that about proud Balaki and Ajātaśatru which occurs in the KBU. (IV) and BU. (II. 1), and others (TU. II. 8 and BU. IV. 3. 33). As to the recurrence of verses se MU, SU. and KU.</p>
<p>2.See the passage quoted by Śaṁkārcārya in his commentary on the Sūtra.</p>
<p>3.Paramah sāmyam upaiti. See MB. III. 1. 3. The opinion expressed by some eminent scholars that the burden of the Upaniṣad teaching is the illusive character of the world and the reality of one soul only, is manifestly wrong, and I may even say, is indicative of an uncritical judgment. As stated in the text, the Upaniṣads from the very nature of the compilations cannot but be expected to teach not one, but many systems of doctrine.</p>
<p>4.Seethe passange from BU. III, 2, 13, quoted in my paper&quot;A Peep into the Early History of India&rdquo;, JBBRAS, Vol. XX, P. - 361.[ = Vol. I. P. 7 of this Editions. - N.B.U.].</p>
<p>theism, so fully explained by Max Muller, and its ultimate result, the identification of the various gods, also influenced later thinkers. The conception that the supreme spirit manifests himself in various forms which we find expressed in the Upaniṣadsis a development, in the opposite direction, of the idea that one God, for instance Agni, is the same as Varuna, Mitra, Indra and Aryaman.<sup id="fnref1:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> If these several gods are one, one god may become several. This led to the conception of Incarnations or Avatāras, which plays such a prominent part in the later religious systems.</p>
<p>But for ordinary people, an adorable object, with a more distinct personality than that which the theistic portions of the Upaniṣads attributed to God, was necessary and the philosophia speculations did not answer practical needs. Thus some of the old Vedic gods, and others, which were new, became the objects of worship.</p>
<p>II. The Rise of a New Theistic System.</p>
<p>§2. The tide of free speculations culminated in the east into such systems as those of Buddhism and Jainism; and though they denied the existence of God as a creator, or did not use the ides for the promotion of righteousness, and the former practically denied the existence of the human soul as a substance, still, these systems had the needful personal element in the shape of their founders. In the west, however, a theistic system with a god who had come to dwell among men arose. The various religious systems and superstitions that prevailed in the fourth century. B. C. are given in the following passage, occurring in the Niddess, which though of the nature of a commentary is regarded as one of the books of the Pall Buddhistic Canon<sup id="fnref1:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>: &ldquo;The deity of the lay followers of the Ājivakas is the Ājivakas, of those of the Nighanthas is the Nighanthas, of those of the Jaṭilas (ascetics wearing long matted hair) is the Jaṭilas, of those of the Paribbājakasis the Paribbājakas, of those of the Avaruddhakas is the Avaruddhakas, and the deity of those who are devoted to an elephant, a horse, a cow, a dog, a crow, Vāsudeva, Baladeva, Puṇṇabhadda, Maṇibhadda, Aggi, Nāgas, Supaṇṇas, Yakkhas,</p>
<p>Asuras, Gandhabbas, Mahārājas, Canda, Suriya, India, Brahmā, Deva, Disā is the elephant, the horse, the cow, the dog, the crow, Vāsudeva, Baladeva, Puṇṇabhadda, Maṇibhadda, etc., respectively.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here a Buddhist who cannot but be expected to show scant courtesy to religious systems other than his own, places the worshippers of Vāsudeva and Baladeva on the same level with those of fire, moon, sun and Brahmā, and even elephants, crows, dogs, etc. But the worship of Vāsudeva was destined to become the predominant religion of a large part of India even to the supersession of that of fire, sun, moon and Brahmāand, of course, of the superstitious adoration of the lower animals. And it will be now our duty to trace its rise and progress.</p>
<p>§ 3. In his comment on Pāṇini IV. 3 98, Patañjali distinctly states that the Vāsudeva contained in the Sūtra is the name of the &quot; worshipful &ldquo;, i. e., of one who is pre-eminently worshipful, i. e., God.<sup id="fnref1:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> The worship of Vāsudeva must be regarded to be as old as Pāṇini.</p>
<p>In an Inscription found at Ghosundi in Rajputāna<sup id="fnref1:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>which unfortunately is in a mutilated condition, the construction of a wall round the hall of worship of Saṁkarṣaṇa and Vāsudeva is mentioned. From the form of the characters in the Inscription it appears to have been engraved at least two hundred years B. C.</p>
<p>In another Inscription recently discovered at Besnagar,<sup id="fnref1:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> Heliodora represents himself to have erected a Garuḍadhvaja or a column with the image of Garuḍa at the top in honour of Vāsudeva, the god of gods. Heliodora calls himself a Bhāgavaṭa, was the son of Diya, was a native of Takṣaśila and is spoken of as an ambassador of the Yavana and as such came on a political mission from. Aṁtalikita to Bhagabhadra who must have ruled over EasternMalwa. In this Inscription occurs the name Aṁtalikita which in all likelihood is the same as Antialkidas of the Bactro-Greek coins. This name as well as the form of the characters show that it belongs to the earlier part of the second century before the</p>
<p>Christian era. At that timeVāsudeva was worshipped as the god of gods and his worshippers were called Bhāgavatas The Bhāgavata religion prevailed in the northwestern part of India and was adopted even by the Greeks.</p>
<p>In the Inscription No. 1 in the large cave at Nānāghāt,<sup id="fnref1:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> the names of Saṁkarṣaṇa and Vāsudeva, in a Dvandva compound, occur along with those of other deities in the opening invocation. This Inscription appears from the form of the characters to belong to the first century before the Christian era.</p>
<p>In the passage in the Mahabhāṣya in which Patañjali, to account for the appearance of the name Vāsudeva in Pāṇini IV. 3. 98, says that this is not the name of a Kṣatriya, but that of the Worshipful One, the question to be considered is whether Patañjali means this Vāsudeva to be quite unconnected with the Vāsudeva of the Vṛṣṇi race. From the occurrence of the names Vāsudeva and Baladeva close to each other in the passage from the Niddessa referred to above, and that of Saṁkarṣaṇa and Vāsudeva as worshipful or divine persons in a Dvandva compound in two of three above Inscriptions, it appears that the Vasudeva referred to by Patañjali as the Worshipful One must be the Vāsudeva of the race. But to account for the appearance of the name in the Sūtra, though the required form can he made up in accordance with the next Sūtra (Panini, IV. 3. 99), Patañjali says that Pāṇini looks at Vāsudeva in his capacity as a divine person and not as a Kṣatriya One must take it in this sense, since the Ghosundi Inscription noticed above, in which Saṁkarṣaṇa and Vāsudeva are associated as worshipful persons, must be older than Patañjali himself. Besides, Patañjali begins the discussion of the Sutra by first taking Vāsudeva as the name of a Kṣatriya. and raising an objection against it. This objection is answered in one way, Vāsudeva being still regarded as a Kṣatriya, and it is only optionally that he gives another explanation, that that name is not the name of a Kṣatriya, but of a divine person. This optional explanation given in the last resort must, therefore, be understood in the sense given above. And from all the accounts of the Bhagavata school contained in the whole literature it is clear that the worshipful Vāsudeva belonged to the Vṛṣṇii race.</p>
<p>III. Analysis of the Nārāyaṇiya Section of the Mahābhārata.</p>
<p>§ 4. Having thus established on irrefragable evidence thex existence during the three or four centuries before Christ of a religion with Vāsudeva as its central figure, and of a school of hist followers, known by the name of Bhāgavata, I will now proceed to examine the detailed accounts contained in the literature and especially in the Mahābhārata. This was not done before, because the date of the Mahābhārata or any portion of it cannot be ascertained with any approach to certainty. The Nārāyaṇīya section. of the Śantiparvan, to which we shall devote a detailed considersation, is, however, older than Śaṁkarācarya who quotes from it.</p>
<p>Nārada is represented to have gone to the Badarikāśrama to see Nara and Nārāyaṇa The latter was engaged in the performance of religious rites. Nārada asked Nārāyaṇa whom he worshipped, while he himself was the Supreme Lord. Nārāyaṇa told him that he worshipped his original Prakṛti (form), the source of all that is and that is to ba. Nara and Nārāyaṇa as well as Krṣṇa and Hari, sons of Dharma, are represented as the forms of the Supreme.</p>
<p>Nārada flies into the sky to see that original Prakṛti and alights on a peak of Meru. There he saw white men without sense, not esting anything, sinless, with heads like umbrellas, making a sound like that of thundering clouds and devoted to Bhgavat. Then Yudhiṣṭhira asks Bhiṣma who those people were, and how they came to be what they were. Bhiṣma tells the story of the king Vasu Uparicara, who worshipped God according to the Sātvata Vidhi (form of ritual). He was a glorious king honoured by Indra, devoted to truth and holy. The best of the learned in the Pañcarātra system were honoured with the first seat at dinner by him.</p>
<p>The narrator then proceeds to mention the Citrasikhaṇḍins, who appear to be the original promulgators of this religion. The mountain Meru was the place where they revealed it. They were. Seven, consisting of Marici, Atri, Angiras, Pulastys, Pulaha,</p>
<p>Kratu, and Vasiṣṭha. The eighth was Svāyaṁbhuva. From these eight, emanated this excellent Sāstra. This they promulgated in the presence of the great Bhagavat, who said to the Rṣis: &ldquo;You have composed a hundred thousand excellent Ślokas (stanzas), which contain rules for all the affairs of men and are in harmony with Yajus, Sāman, Re, and Atharvānṅgiras, and lay down precepts about the religion of action as well as that of contemplation or repose. I created Brahman from my peaceful and Rudra from my wrathful nature. This Śāstra will be handed down from person to person until it reaches Bṛhaspati. From Bṛhaspati the king. Vasu will obtain it. The king will follow this Śāstra and will become my devotee. After his death this Śāstra will be lost.&rdquo; Telling all this the great god disappeared. Then the Citraśikhanḍins spread the religion until it reached Bṛhaspati.</p>
<p>Then the old Kalpa having ended and the son of Aṅgiras, the priest of the gods, being born, the gods were happy. The king Vasu Uparicars was his first pupil. He learned this Śāstra from Bṛhaspati. At one time he brought forward an extensive horsesacrifice, but no animal was killed on the occasion. The oblations were devised in accordance with the words of the Araṇyakas. The god of gods showed himself to Vasu and accepted his oblation, but was unseen by anybody else. Since the oblation was taken away by Fari without showing himself to Bṛhaspati, the lattar got angry and dashed upwards the sacrifical ladle. At that sacrifice, Ekats, Dvita, and Trita, sons of Prjāpati, and sixteen Rsis, many of whom are known as the authors of literary works, such as Medhātithi, Tittiri, and Taṇḍya are represented to have been present.</p>
<p>When Bṛhaspatil was angry, they all said that the great Hari was not to be seen by any man at random, but by one who was favoured by his graca. Ekata, Dvits and Trita said: &ldquo;On one occasion we went to the north for the attainment of eternal bliss near the Milky Ocean, and practised austerities for four thousand years and at the end a voice in the sir declared: Well, how can you see that great Lord? In the Milky Ocean there is a White Island where there are men possessing the lustre of the moon, who are the devotees of the god, possess no senses, do not eat any thing and being devoted solely to the god (Ekāntin or monothaistic) ara absorbed in him, who is bright like the sun. Go to</p>
<p>that island; there shines my soul&rsquo;. Accordingly we went to the white island, and, dazzled by the light of that being, were not able to see him. Then the truth flashed upon us that the god cannot be seen by us unless we have gone through susterities. After further susterities for a hundred years we saw the men of the lustre of the moon with their minds fully absorbed in the contemplation of God. The refulgence of each man was like that of the sun on the last day. Then we heard a sound: Jitam te Puṇḍarikākṣa etc. (Triumphant art thou, Lotus-eyed one !). A short time after, a voice in the air declared: &lsquo;Go you away as you came. That great being is not to be seen by one who is not devoted to him. Then we returned without being able to see him. How then will you be able to see him?&rdquo; Having heard this from Ekats, Dvita and Trita, Bṛhaspati finished the sacrifice.</p>
<p>Vasu Uparicara had to live in a hole in the earth on account of the ourse of the Rṣis, who in a controversy with the gods maintained that no animal should be sacrificed, but only vegetable, grain, while the gods contended that a goat should be sacrificed. The question was referred to Vasu who declared in favour of the gods. Vasu was raised from the hole by Nārāyaṇa, whom he had devotedly worshipped, by sending his Garuda to lift him up. He was thence taken to the Brahmaworld.</p>
<p>The story of Nārada&rsquo;s visit to Śvetadvipa is then continued. He praises the great Being by uttering names expressive of his purity and grandeur, and the great Being then manifested himself to him saying that he was not to be seen by one who was not solely devoted to him (Ekāntin), and that, as Nārada was such a one, he showed himself to him. He then proceeds to explain to him the religion of Vāsudeva. Vāsudeva is the supreme soul, the internal soul of all souls. He is the supreme creator. All living beings are represented by Saṁkarṣaṇa, who is a form of Vāsudeva. From Saṁkarṣaṇa sprang Pradyumna, the mind, and from Pradyumna, Aniruddha, self-consciousness. &ldquo;Those who are devoted to me enter into me and are released.&rdquo; The great being calls four above mentioned his forms (Mūrtis). The production of one form from another is also mentioned; all these forms are however, styled his forms (Mūrtis). He then proceeds to mention the creation of gods and all other things by himself and their final</p>
<p>dissolution into himself. Then are mentioned his incarnations (Avatāras), viz. Varāha, Narasiṁha, the oppressor of Bali, Rāma of the Bhṛgu race and destroyer of the Kṣatriyas, Rāma Dāśarathi, and &ldquo;he who will come into existence for the destruction of Kaṁsa at Mathurā and after having killed many demons will finally settle at Dvārakā.&rdquo; In this manner having done all things by his four Mūrtis, he destroyed Dvārakā with the Sātvatas and went to Brahmsloks After Nārada had heard this from the supreme Nārāyaṇa, he returned to Badarikāśrama.</p>
<p>What follows at the end of chapter 339 and in the next four chapters has little bearing on our subject, except that in one of them the etymological sense of Vāsudeva is given as one who covers the whole world and is the resting-place (Adhivāsa) of all beings.</p>
<p>In chapter 344 the path of those who are free from sin is given thus:—The sun is the gate, and after entrance all their material impurities being burnt, they remain as atoms in him then released from him, they enter into the Aniruddha form, and becoming mind, enter into the Pradyumna form. Leaving that form, they enter into that of Saṁkarṣaṇa, i. e., the form of the individual soul (Jīva). Afterwards being free from the three Guṇas, they enter into the Supreme Soul, who exists everywhere and who is Vāsudeva.</p>
<p>In chapter 346 Vaiśaṁpāyana relates to Janamejaya that the Dharma which Nārada got from the Lord of the world&rsquo;, Nārāyana himself, in all its details and peculiarities, was explained briefly to him (Janamejaya) in the Harigita. In chapter 348 this Ekāntika Dharma is represented to be the same as that which was communicated to Arjuna at the beginning of the war. At the creation of each Brahmā, this Dharma was revealed by Nārāyana, and then at the end of the Brahmā it was lost. In the account of the fourth Brahmā the Dharma revealed is twice called. Sātvata. In this manner it goes on up to the present or the seventh Brahmā, in which that Dharma was first communicated to Pitāmaha, and from him it passed in succession to Dakṣa, his grandson, the eldest Āditya, Vivasvat, Manu and Ikṣvāku. Later on it is stated that this original great eternal Dharma, difficult to be known and to be followed, is professed by the Sātvatas.</p>
<p>This Dharma is associated with the non-slaughter ofanimals(Ahiṁsā) and when properly exercised, the lord Hari is pleased with it. Sometimes one Vyūha or form of the Lord is taught and sometimes two, three or four. Vaiśaṁpayana winds up by saying that he has thus explained the Ekāntadharma.</p>
<p>§ 5. Here we have two accounts, the second of which is interwoven with the first. The former, however, appear to relate to a more ancient condition of things. The points to be noticed are these: 1. At the sacrifice instituted by Vasu Uparicara no animals were killed. 2. The oblations were devised in accordance with the teachings of the Āraṇyakas which include the Upaniṣads. 3. The chief deity was the God of gods, who is also called Hari. 4. This Hari or God of gods is not to be seen by one who follows the sacrificial mode of worship, such as Bṛhaspati did, nor by persons who practise austerities for thousands of years, as Ekata, Dvita and Trita did, but by one who worships Him with devotion as Vasu Uparicara did.</p>
<p>Here then is an attempt to introduce a religious reform on more conservative principles than Buddhism and Jainism did. The repudiation of the slaughter of animals and the inefficacy of sacrificial worship and austerities are common to this religious reform with Buddhism. But that the supreme lord Hari is to be worshipped with devotion, and the words of the Āraṇyakas are not to be rejected, are doctrines which are peculiar to it. Vasu Uparicara&rsquo;s story goes so far only.</p>
<p>In the main account, according to which Nārada visited the White Island, wo have a re-assertion of the doctrine that the Supreme Soul can be seen by one who worships him with devotion. The great Nārāyaṇa manifests himself to him and explains the religion of Vāsudeva and his three other forms (Vyūhas). He also mentions the future incarnations of Vāsudeva, and one of these is that assumed at Mathurā for the destruction of Kaṁsa. The supreme Nārāyaṇa indentifies himself with Vāsudeva in hisfour forms (Vyūhas). At the end it is stated that the religion is followed by the Sātvatas.</p>
<p>These two accounts seem to represent two stages in the progress of reform. In the earlier one the worship of Vāsudeva and</p>
<p>his three other forms is not known. The Supreme God is named Hari, and his worship has net thoroughly emancipated itself from the religion of sacrifices. The reform had no reference to specific historical personages and was promulgated by certain sages who are called Citraśikhaṇḍins and whose names had been handed down by tradition. The later account connects the reform with Vāsudeva and his brother, son and grandson, and the new religion is represented to have been identical with that taught in the Bhagavadgītā. This reformed system is said to have been promulgated by Nārāyaṇa himself.</p>
<p>It thus appears that the idea of a religion of devotion arose in earlier times, but it received a definite shape when Vāsudeva revealed the Gitā to Arjuna, and led to the formation of an Independent sect, when his brother, son and grandson were associated with him as his forms presiding over certain psychological categories, or as persons areated by him for the purpose. That sect became conterminous with the race of the Sātvatas. We have now to consider who these Sātvatas were.</p>
<p>IV. The Sātvatas and their Religion.</p>
<p>§ 6. In the Ādiparvan, Vāsudeva addressing the Vṛṣṇis says that Pārtha does not think them who are Sātvatas to be covetous. Vāsudeva is called Sātvata in Ādip. 218. 12; Kṛtavarman in Ādip. 221, 31; Sātyaki in Droṇap. 97. 36; and Janārdans in Udyogap. 70. 7. At the end of chap. 66 of the Bhīṣmaparvan, Bhīṣma says: &ldquo;This eternal god, mysterious, beneficent and loving should be known as Vāsudeva, and Brāhmaṇas, Kṣatriyas. Vaiśyas and Sūdras worship him by their devoted actions. At the end of the Dvāpara and the beginning of the Kali age, he was sung or expounded by Saṁkarṣaṇa according to the Sātvata rites (Vidhi).</p>
<p>At the end of chap. 12 of the third book of the Viṣṇu-Purāna it is stated in the account of the genealogy of the Yādavas and the Vṛṣṇis that Sātvata was the son of Aṁśa, and all his descendants were after him called Sātvatas. The Bhāgavata represents the Sātvatas as calling the highest Brahman Bhagavat and Vāsudeva (IX.9.49), and having a peculiar mode of worshipping him. It mentions the Sātvatas along with the Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis, which were Yādava tribes (I. 14. 25; III. 1. 29), and calls Vāsudeva, Sātvatarsabha (X. 58. 42; XI. 27. 5).</p>
<p>In Patañjali under Pāṇini IV. 1. 114, Vāsudeva and Baladeva are given as derivatives from Vṛṣṇinames in the sense of sons of Vāsudeva and Baladeva. Instances given by the Kāśika of the same are Vāsudeva and Āniruddha. Here Āniruddha means the son of Aniruddha, and therefore Vāsudeva must mean the son of Vāsudeva and not of Vasudeva, as will appear from what follows. In the latter work under Pāṇini VI. 2.34, Sini-Vāsudevāḥ is given as a Dvandva of royal Vṛṣṇinames, each of them being in the plural, and Saṁkarṣaṇa-Vāsudevau as a Dvandva of royal Vṛṣṇi names each being in the singular, so that Vāsudeva means both the individual of that name and his sons.</p>
<p>From all this and such other passages from Patañjali it will appear that Sātvata was another name of the Vṛṣṇi race of which Vāsudeva, Saṁkarṣaṇa, and Aniruddha were members, and that the Sātvatas had a religion of their own according to which Vāsudeva was worshipped as the Supreme Being, and thus the account given above from the Nārāyaṇīya is amply confirmed.</p>
<p>§ 7. It therefore appears that this religion of devotion to Vāsudeva ascends as high into antiquity as Pāṇini himself. As I have mentioned elsewhere, the Kṣatriyas engaged themselves in active speculations on religious matters about the time of the Upaniṣads¹, and are mentioned even as the original possessors of the new knowledge. Siddhārtha and Mahāvira founded in this period of intellectual fermentation new systems of religion in the east or the Magadha country, which discarded or passed over in silence the doctrine of the existence even of God and laid down selfabnegation and a course of strict moral conduct as the way to salvation. They belonged to the Sākya and Jñātṛka races of Kṣatriyas, and Buddhism and Jainism might be considered to be the religions of those tribes. The west, however, was not so radical in its speculations, and the race of Sātvatas developed a system of religion which took up the ideas of a Supreme God and devotion to him as the mode of salvation.</p>
<p>These Sātvatas and the worship of Vāsudeva-Kṛṣṇa seem clearly to be alluded to by Megasthenes, who was the Macedonian</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.Vorhandlungen des VII. Internet. Orientalisten-Congress zu Wien. Ar. Sect., pp. 108-9. [ This article is included in Vol. I of this Edition. N.B.U.]</p>
<p>ambassador at the court of Candragupta, the Maurya. Candragupta reigned in the last quarter of the fourth century B. C. The statement of Megasthenes is that Herakles was specially worshipped by the Sourasenoi, an Indian nation, in whose land are two great cities, Methora and Kleisobora, and through it flows the navigable river Jobares. The Sourasenoi were the Sūrasenās, a tribe of Kṣatriyas, who lived in the region in which was situated Mathurā, corresponding to Methora in the above passage, and in which flowed the river Jubares, which has been idententified with the Jumna or Yamunā. If the Vāsudeva-Kṛṣṇa worship prevailed in the time of the first Maurya, it must have originated long before the establishment of the Maurya dynasty, and my assertion that it owes its origin to the stream of thought which began with the Upaniṣads and culminated in the east in Buddhism and Jainism, and arose about the time of the latter, is confirmed.</p>
<p>The name expressive of the Supreme Spirit was, however, in the early period Vāsudeva alone. In the passage from the Niddesaand the three Inscriptions Vāsudeva is the name that occurs.</p>
<p>In the Bhagavadgītā (VII. 19 ) it is stated that &ldquo;He who possesses knowledge gives himself up to me, believing Vāsudeva to be all&rdquo; Even in the Bhāgavata Mantra of twelve syllables which is usually repeated at the present day and which is mentioned by Hemādri, it is to Vāsudeva that obeisance is made.<sup id="fnref1:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> p. 225. The Mantra is Orh nameBhagavate Visudevāya.&rdquo;) In Bhiṣmap.chap. 65 Brahmadeva, addressing the Supreme Spirit (Purusa Parameśvara), entreats him to become the increaser of the Yadu race, and then, referring apparently to a foregone age, he says: O Vāsudeva! this great secret I have communicated to thee through thy favour as it really is. Having created thyself as the God Saṁkarṣaṇa, thoudidst procreate thy son Pradyumna. He created Aniruddha who is Viṣṇu himself, and he created me (Brahmadeva), who am made up of Vāsudeva and created by thee. Dividing thyself in this way be born as a human being again.&rdquo; In the beginning of chapter 66 of the same Parvan, Prajāpati speaks of himself as having asked the supreme lord of all to dwell in the world of men as Vāsudeva (to become incarnate). This Supreme Spirit should, it is said,</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.Vrntakhaṇḍa (Bibl. Ind.) p. 225. The Mantra is Orh name Bhagavate Vāsudevāya.</p>
<p>be known as Vāsudeva, and throughout the chapter that name alone is used in speaking of the eternal God.</p>
<p>The substance of these two chapters seems to be that in a formar ago the Supreme Spirit Vāsudeva created Saṁkarṣaṇa and the rest up to the Brahmā himself, and on the present occasion the latter asked him again to be born in the Yadu race as Vāsudeva, dividing himself into four parts as on the previous occasion. Thus Vāsudeva was the name of the teacher of the religion of devotion, and there appears to be an implication here that he existed with the other three in a previous age. Even as a member of the Vṛṣṇirace the name Vāsudeva occurs in the examples quoted above from the Mahabhasya and Kāśika and no other.</p>
<p>In the passages quoted by me in my article¹ on &ldquo;Allusions to Kṛṣṇa etc.,&rdquo; the name Kṛṣṇa occurs three times, Vāsudeva in three passages and Janārdana in one. But in Kielhorn&rsquo;s Edition of the Mahābhāṣya, which is more accurate than the Benares edition which I then used, the reading Kṛṣṇa in two of the three places is supported by one Manuscript only and Vāsudeva occurs instead of Kṛṣṇa in one of the two places and the other is entirely omitted, so that Vāsudeva is used four times and Kṛṣṇa only once. In the Bhagavadgītā (X. 37) the Bhagavat says that of the Vṛṣṇis he is Vāsudeva.</p>
<p>In the Buddhist Ghatajātakathe two eldest sons of Upasāgara and Devagabbha are named Vāsudeva and Baladeva. In the prose narrative no other name is given, but the names Kaṇha and Keśava occur in the verses that are interwoven with the prose. The commentator remarks on the first verse that he is there addressed by his Gotra name Kapha, for he belonged to the Kaṇhāyana Gotra, thus showing his belief that Vāsudevawas the true proper name of the person. This belief he expresses again in his commentary on a verse occurring in the Mahāummaggajātaka, in which Jambāvātī is mentioned as the beloved queen of Vāsudeva Kaṇha. Here also Vāsudeva is mentioned as belonging to the Kaṇhāyana Gotra, and from the verse itself, in which Vāsudevassa Kaṇhassa occurs, it would appear, that Kaṇha<br>
___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1. Ind. Ant., Vol. III, pp. 14 ff. [This article is included in Vol. I of this Edition.—N. B. U.]</p>
<p>was the family name, the sense being Vāsudeva, the Kaṇha, so that the author of the verse itself would seem to regard Vāsudeva as the proper name of the individual, and thus he and the prose narrative agree.</p>
<p>§ 8. Thus then Vāsudeva appears to be a proper name and not a patronymic, and when the Vāsudeva religion or the Bhāgavata school took its rise, that was the name by which the Supreme. Deity was known. The conception of Vāsudeva as his father must have arisen afterwards, as appears to me from the example Vāsudevaḥ given in the Mahābhāṣya in the sense of &ldquo;son or descendant of Vāsudeva &ldquo;, and not &ldquo;of Vāsudeva&rdquo;, as must be inferred from the analogous instance of Bāladeva from Baladeva. Baladeva was associated with Vāsudeva and not with Vasudeva.</p>
<p>Kṛṣṇa, Janārdara, and Keśava do not appear to be Vṛṣṇinames and were given to Vāsudeva in subsequent times when his worship had widely spread. All these three occur in Patañjali also, but the two latter only once so far as I know. But of those the name Kṛṣṇa is more important than the other two and many others that are used. It appears to be as much a proper name as Vāsudeva, though the latter has a religious signification specially attached to it. How then did this name Kṛṣṇa come to be used ? It was the name of one of the Vedic Rṣis, the composer of hymn. 74 of the eighth Maṇḍala. He speaks of himself as Kṛṣṇa in verses 3 and 4 of the hymn. The author of the Anukramaṇī calls him an Āṅgirasa or descendant of Aṅgirasa. In the KB. (XXX. 9) apparently the same Kṛṣṇa Āṅgirasa is alluded to and is represented to have seen the evening libation in its connection with the Brāhmaṇācchaṁsin priest. Kṛṣṇa occurs in a Gaṇa attached to Pāṇini, IV. 1. 96. In the Gaṇa connected with Pāṇini IV. 1. 99 Kṛṣṇa and Raṇa are represented to form the Gotra names Kārṣṇāyana and Rāṇāyana. These were Brāhmaṇa Gotras falling under the group of Vāsiṣṭhas. The former is the Gotra alluded to by the commentator on the verses in the Jātakas noticed above. But he apparently does not confine it to the Brāhmaṇa class. Then the name Kṛṣṇa as the son of Devaki occurs In the Chāndogya Upaniṣad (III. 17). He was the pupil of Ghora, who was an Āṅgirasa. If Kṛṣṇa was also an Āṅgirasa, which is not improbable, it must be inferred that there was a tradition about Kṛṣṇa</p>
<p>as a sage from the time of the Ṛgvedic hymns to the time of the Chāndogya-Upanṣiad, and about a Gotra of the name of Kārṣṇāyana, which literally means collection of Kṛṣṇas, of which the original Kṛṣṇa was the founder. This tradition gave rise to the identification of the sage Kṛṣṇa with Vāsudeva, when he was raised to the rank of the supreme deity. Just as the name Janamejaya, the son of Parikṣit, which occurs in the AB., was in subsequent times used as the name of the person to whom the Mahābhārata was narrated, and a genealogy was given to him from Arjuna, the Pāṇḍava, so it is possible that Vāsudeva was identified with the sage Kṛṣṇa and a genealogy given to him in the Vṛṣṇi race through Śūra and Vasudevas.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best explanation of the fact of Vāsudeva having been called Kṛṣṇa is that given by the commentator of the Gāthās or verses of the Jātakas, supported, as it appears to me, by the author of the Gāthās himself, that Kṛṣṇa was a Gotra name. The Gotras Kārṣṇāyana which corresponds to Kaṇhāyanais not only mentioned as a Brāhmaṇa Gotra belonging to the Vāsiṣṭha group in the Gaṇa alluded to above, but is stated to have belonged to the Pārāśara subdivision of that group in the Matsyapurāṇa, ch. 200¹. Though this was a Brāhmaṇa and Pārāśara Gotra, it could be assumed for sacrificial purposes by a Kṣatriya, for according to Āśvalāyana (Sr. S. XII. 15) the Gotra and the ancestors invoked of the Kṣatriyas are those of their priests or chaplains, and the only Ṛṣi ancestors that all the Kṣatriyas have are Mānava, Aila and Paurūravasa. The name of these do not distinguish one Kṣatriya family from another, and, to answar the purposes of such a distinction, the Gotra and ancestors of the priest are assumed. Vāsudeva therefore belonged to the Kārṣṇāyana Gotra, though it was a Brāhmaṇa and Pārāśara Gotra, and as belonging to this Gotra he could be called Kṛṣṇa by name. Having come to be known by that name, all the traditions about the learning and spiritual insight of the old Kṛṣṇa, and also of his being the son of Devakī were engrafted on him, and thus in the Sabhāparvan 38, Bhīṣma says that one of the two reasons for giving the highest honours to Kṛṣṇa was that he possessed the knowledge of the Vedas and dependent treatises (Vedāṅgas), and that he was also a sacrificial priest (Ṛtvij). The Hindu habit of</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.Quoted also in Puruṣottama&rsquo;s Pravaramañjarī, Mysore edition.</p>
<p>thought of identifying one god with others by regarding the latter either as forms or incarnations of the former, and thus evolving monotheism out of polytheism, led to the identification of this Vāsudeva with other gods and with the boy Kṛṣṇa of Gokula. These we will notice later on.</p>
<p>§ 9. In the Nārāyaṇīyawe have an explanation of the Bhāgavata or Pāñcarātra system. This system also we will notice in its ripened form later. In the meanwhile we will turn our attention to the statement that the Ekāntika-Dharma founded by Vāsudeva has been explained in the Harīgitāand on the occasion when the armies of the Kurus and the Pāṇḍavas stood face to face and Arjuna lost heart. The allusion is of course to the Bhagavadgita.</p>
<p>This passage is noticed in the Bhaktisūtra (83) and its commentary, in which it is stated that Ekāntabhāva (which is the subject of the Nārāyaṇiya), or devotion to one only, is Bhakti alone, since the former is recognised in that passage as identical with the main topic of the Bhagavadgītā. But the Bhagavadgītā contains no allusion to the Vyūhas or forms of the Supreme, Saṁkarṣaṇa and others, while the latter form a characteristic of the Bhāgavata school. The Gitā, however, mentions as the Prakrtis of Vāsudeva the five elements, the mind, Buddhi or knowledge, and egoism as well as Jīva (VII4, 5). The last is identified with Saṁkarṣaṇa in the Bhāgavata system, egoism with Aniruddha, and mind, with which probably Buddhi is associated, with Pradyumna.</p>
<p>What appears to be the fact is this: The Bhagavadgītāwas composed before the doctrines of the Bhāgavata school were reduced to a system, and it was then that the three of the Prakṛtis of the Supreme were personified into Saṁkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha, who were members of the family of Vāsudeva. In the prevalent worship, however, Saṁkarṣaṇa alone. is found associated with Vāsudevain early times, as is seen from the Inscriptions, and the passage from the Niddesa noticed in the beginning.<sup id="fnref1:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> Patañjali also notices, under Pāṇini II. 2. 34, a verse in which it is stated that certain musical instruments are sounded in a gathering in the temple of Dhanapati, Rāma and Keśava.</p>
<p>Here Rāma and Keśava are Balarāma and Vāsudeva-Kṛṣṇa, and it is clear that there were festive gatherings at their temples in Patañjali&rsquo;s time. If the passage in Patañjali under Pāṇini VI. 3. 6, &ldquo;Janārdana with himself as the fourth&rdquo;, i. e., with three companions, may be taken to allude to the three Vyūhas, then it must be understood that the four Vyūhas, Vāsudeva, Saṁkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha, were known in Patañjali&rsquo;s time. Still it is doubtful, and it may be taken for granted that the two Vyūhas, Vāsudeva and Saṁkarṣaṇa, only were known up to the time of the latest Inscription which is to be referred to about the beginning of the first century before the Christian era, so that the system of four Vyūhas was not fully developed up to that time.</p>
<p>If this reasoning is correct, it will be seen that the date of the Bhagavadgītāwhich contains no mention of the Vyūhas, or personified forms, is much earlier than those of the Inscriptions, the Niddesa and Patañjali, i. e., it was composed not latter than the beginning of the fourth century before the Christian era. How much earlier it is difficult to say. At the time when the Gītāwas conceived and composed, the identification of Vāsudeva with Nārāyaṇa had not taken place, nor had his being an incarnation of Viṣṇu come to be acknowledged, as appears from the work itself. When his Virāj or universe-form was shown to Arjuna, as represented in the eleventh chapter, he is twice addressed by the latter as Viṣṇu on account of his dazzling brilliance, which rendered everything hot, and filled the whole universe. Here Viṣṇu is alluded to as the chief of the Ādityas and not as the supreme being, and Vāsudeva was Viṣṇu in this sense, as mentioned in chapter 10, because the best thing of a group or class is represented to be his Vibhūti or special manifestation.</p>
<p>§ 10. A characteristic of a new system of religion that comes into vogue is, that the followers are not satisfied with the idea, that the person known as the founder originated the system. They push back the origin by many ages. Siddhārthaka was preceded by many Buddhas, so was Mahāvīra by many Tirthaṁkaras. So in the case of the Bhāgavata school we have seen that that system was taught by Nārāyaṇa at the beginning of each Brahman, and</p>
<p>in the existing Brahman it was first taught to Pitāmaha or Prajāpati and thence it passed to Dakṣa, Vivasvat, Manu and Ikṣvāku. This last order of its revelation is alluded to at the beginning of the fourth chapter of the Gītā, which confirms the tradition noticed in the Nārāyaṇiya about the identity of the religion of the Gītāwith the Ekāntika religion revealed by Nārāyaṇa. In this respect of pushing back the origin the Bhāgavata system resembles Buddhism and Jainism.</p>
<p>V. Substance of the Bhagavadgītā.</p>
<p>§ 11. We will now pass under review the main contents of the Bhagavadītā, as from all appearances it is the earliest exposition of the Bhakti system or the Ekāntika Dharma.</p>
<p>Chapter II. Arjuna is reluctant to fight because it involves the destruction of his near and revered relatives and of other men. Bhagavat endeavours to remove the reluctance by speaking of the eternity and indestructibility of the human soul. Here are two stanzas which ocour, with a variation in one of the lines, in the Kaṭha Upaniṣad. Then to fight is spoken of as the duty of a Kṣatriya for whom there is no other good than a just fight. This mode of thinking is characterised as being Sāṁkhya, and the Yoga mode then follows.</p>
<p>The condition of mind in the Yoga mode is a determined will. Those who according to the precepts of the Veda perform rites for fulfillment of various desires, cannot have a determined steadfast will. For attaining such a will one should think only of the deed to be done and not of the fruits to be derived from it. With a concentrated mind and without any attachment to other objects one should devote oneself to the deed alone. By such devotion to acts with a determined will, man finally attains inflexibility of will becomes Sthitaprajn̄a), and all his desires being uprooted, he attains complete serenity of soul or the Brāhmīcondition. When he is in this condition at the time of death, he obtains comes to the same doctrine as that quiescence in Brahman. This stated in the Kaṭha and Bṛhadāraṇyaka-Upaniṣads, that when all desires in the heart are uprooted, the mortal becomes immortal and attains to Brahman.<sup id="fnref1:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> The discipline, however, prescribed for</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.Yadāsarve pramucyante kāmāỵesỵa hṛdi sritāḥ, KU, VI. 14, and also BU. IV. 4. 7.</p>
<p>the attainment of this end is not simply moral, but religious also, since it is stated that after having controlled the senses which reader the mind restless, a man should devote himself to Bhagavat.</p>
<p>§ 12. Chapter III. There are two paths, that of devotion to knowledge for the Sāṁkhyas, and that of devotion to Karman or action for the Yogins. Every one is born for a life of activity, but the deeds done do not tie him down to the world, if he does them for worship (Yajña) and not for his private purposes. No Karman is necessary for one whose enjoyments consist in himself, who is satisfied with himself and contented in himself. But for other people action is necessary, and it must be done without any selfish desire. Janaka and others obtained perfection by devoting themselves to actions alone, i. e., by the pursuit of an active life. But the action should be dedicated to the Supreme, and one should not seek any fruit for himself. But such a frame of mind is not attainable by ordinary men, who are under the influence of their physical nature and sensual passions.</p>
<p>Then a question is asked what it is that prompts man to sin. The reply is that it is desire and anger which are all-powerful and envelop a man&rsquo;s spiritual existence. Desire acts through the senses, but intelligence is superior to the senses, and superior to this latter is the will (Buddhi) and the soul is superior to Buddhi. Knowing oneself to be higher than Buddhi, one should curb oneself by efforts and kill desire which acts through the series, viz., senses, intellect, will. Here the superiority of one faculty over another is an idea borrowed from the Kaṭha-Upaniṣad. In connection with the teaching that action should be done disinterestedly, Bhagavat makes the closest possible approach to the Sāṁkhya doctrine that the soul being deluded by egoism (Ahaṁkāra) regards himself as the agent of the actions done by the qualities of nature (Prakṛti), and that, misled by the qualities of nature, he forms an attachment to the qualities and actions..</p>
<p>§ 13. Chapter IV. The chapter begins with Bhagavat&rsquo;s mention of his communication of this system to Vivasvat in the first instance, as alluded to above.<sup id="fnref1:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> Incidentally the question of his ex</p>
<p>istence at the time of Vivasvat comes up, and he then explains hisbeing born again and again, and assuming incarnations for the destruction of the wicked by means of his Prakṛti. They who know the incarnations and the celestial deeds of Bhagavat, are released from the body and are not born again. By means of knowledge, men, being purified and their passions destroyed, and being devoted to him and resorting to him and resting on him, attained to the condition of Bhagavat. Bhagavat resorts to men in the manner in which they resort to him; men everywhere follow his path.</p>
<p>The idea of action without attachment is further developed. The metaphorical Yajñas are mentioned, such as the sacrifice of the senses into the fire of restraint, of the objects of the senses into the senses, of the operation of the senses and of the vital breaths into the fire of Yoga, which is the control of the self. All these Yajñas cannot be accomplished without acts. Of these the Yajñas of knowledge is the best for by its means one sees all things in one-self and in God (Supreme spirit). This highest knowledge brings about freedom from all sin, and destroys the polluting effect of action. The realisation of the Yoga sets aside the significance of the actions. This highest knowledge puts an end to all doubt and one becomes a spirit-a spirit totally free. When acts are done in this condition, they do not defile a person. Here the tendency to rationalise Yajñas or sacrifices, which set in in the Upanṣiad period, is seen in a developed form, since the restraint of the senses, the attainmeut of knowledge, and such other practices are characterised as Yajñas or sacrifices.</p>
<p>Another point that deserves notice is the statement that Bhagavat deals with men in the manner in which they deal with him, that is, the spirit with which God is approached by men is reciprocated by God. This is followed by the affirmation that men everywhere, whatever the differences of their views, follow the path of Bhagavat. Here lies, in germ, the principle that all religions have a basis of truth in them.</p>
<p>§ 14. Chapter V. Sāṁkhya and Yoga are brought into connection with Saṁnyāsa and Karmayoga. They are not independent of each other. Following either thoroughly, one obtains the fruit of both. The place which is obtained bp Sāṁkhyas is obtained also</p>
<p>by Yogas. For Jñānayajña or sacrifice of knowledge enabling a man to see all things in himself and in God, and this knowledge bringing about freedom from sin, the same condition is attained to, which an active life or pursuit of actions (Karmayoga) brings about, when the actions are done disinterestedly or without aiming at the fruit, with an eye directed towards Brahman only, the true essence of things. Though this is so, still Saṁnyāsa is difficult to be realised without Yoga. With Yoga one attains to it soon. A Yogin does not think that he does something when he sees, hears, cats, sleeps, etc. This is so when these acts are done without any attachment, the aim being the realisation of Brahman. The Yogins perform deeds by their body, mind, will, or simply by their senses, without any attachment for the sake of spiritual purification. By means of Yoga, Jñāna is obtained, and in this condition man looks at all things alike. When a man looks at all things with the same regard, what he aims at is the Brahman and in it he rests. This leads to the consideration of the final peaca in Brahman and the method of attaining it. This pesce in Brahman resembles the condition of an Arbat in Buddhism, but the Bhagavadītādoes not end there and adds that in this condition of deliverance a person comes to know the Supreme Soul as one to whom all kinds of worship and austere practices are directed as the lord of all worlds and the friend of all beings; and it is this knowledge that leads to peace.</p>
<p>§ 15. Chapter VI. He who does not attach himself to the result of his actions and does what he ought to do, is Samnyásin as well as Yogin. Karman or action is necessary to become a sage. (Muni). When he has attained the dignity of a sage, the essence of it is peace. Then follows a description of the state of a man who has attained Yoga. Practice of Yoga, or contemplation, is then described. When a man goes through the Yoga practices, he attains serenity in Bhagavat, i. e., becomes absorbed in him in peace. All the functions of the mind are suspended in the condition of Yoga. Seeing himself by himself he rests in himself.</p>
<p>Then follows an explanation of the process of abstraction and concentration. A Yogin sees himself in all things and all things in himself, looks at all things in the same light. The Supreme Spirit is not lost to him who sees Him everywhere and sees everything in</p>
<p>Him, the Supreme Spirit. He who looks upon the Bhagavat as one, though he exists in all things, exists in him, though he moves about everywhere. He who regards all as himself (and looks upon them in the same light) in matters of happiness and misery is the best Yogin. Then Arjuna remarks on the difficulty of this Yoga &ldquo;The mind&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;is restless&rdquo;. But Bhagavat replies that it can be controlled by practice as well as by reflection on the vanity of things (Vairāgya ). At the end Bhagavat teaches that he is the greatest Yogin, who, having faith in him, adores him with his whole soul centred in him.</p>
<p>The Yoga described in this chapter is found in some of the Upanṣiads, especially in the Svetaśvatara. The affirmation &ldquo;sees himself in himself and everywhere else&rdquo; occurs in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka (IV. 4. 23). The author winds up the chapter with a verse which is in every sense theistic, as he does the fifth chapter, in order, it would appear, that the description of the mental discipline contained in the last chapter, and of Yoga in this, might not lead to non-theistic conclusions. Care is taken to bring the whole into connection with the Supreme Soul.</p>
<p>§ 16. Chapter VII. In the last six chapters has been explained the whole process of Karmayoga from beginning to act regardless of the fruit, to the attainment of the condition of Yogin, who acting solely with a view to the acquisition of the Brahma condition, is free from passions, looks upon all things alike; and it is added at the end that he is the best of the Yogins, who adores Bhagavat with faith and with a devoted heart. This is added to show that the processes up to the attainment of the Yoga condition, are difficult to be practised by men with such passions as we possess, and the way to be free from them is to surrender oneself to God; and therefore in this chapter Bhagavat goes on to explain the nature of created beings and of his relation to them. He begins by saying that God&rsquo;s Prakṛti is eightfold: the five elements, mind, will (Buddhi), and egoism. Jīva is another Prakṛti, which supports the world. From these are produced all objects or beings. Bhagavat is the source and the last resting place of the world. There is nothing further than him. All these things are strung together in him as gems in á string. That which is the characteristic excellence of a thing is Bhagavat himself. All</p>
<p>the three qualities and the conditions resulting from them proceed from him. Bhagavat is not in them and they are not in him. Bhagavat is beyond all these three conditions. The world, deluded by the conditions resulting from the three qualities, does not know Bhagavat, the Supreme Spirit, who is beyond them all. This Māyāof Bhagavat consisting of these qualities is very difficult to be got over, and this Māyā they get rid of, who take refuge in him. Wicked men do not resort to Bhagavat, their understanding being clouded by Māyā and resorting to Āsura or demoniacal condition.</p>
<p>The devotees of Bhagavat are of four kinds. Of these the Jñānin, or the enlightened, is the best. The Jñānin sticks to Bhagavat as his best refuge. The enlightened man surrenders himself to him, regarding Vāsudeva as everything. Other people ture attached to other deities and undertake different vows faith in their deities is generated by Bhagavat and strengthened by him. They worship those deities with that faith and attain fruit. That fruit is yielded by Bhagavat himself. But it is perishable. Not knowing Bhagavat&rsquo;s true nature, which is unchangeable and excellent, ignorant people regard him as something indiscrete at first and afterwards made discrete. He is not intelligible to all beings, being enveloped in Yogamāyā (mystic power). He knows the past, the present and the future, and nobody knows him. By likes and dislikes all beings are deluded, and those only, who are released from the infatuation of likes and dislikes, with their sins being destroyed by the practice of virtue, adore the Supreme. Those who know Bhagavat to be Adhiyajña (presiding over worship) and Adhibhūta (presiding over beings), come to know him when they depart this life.</p>
<p>For the idea of all existing things being strung together in the Supreme, we may compare MU. II. 2.5, and BU. III. 8. 3-4; 6-7. Ordinary people are represented as resorting to other deities, led by several desires. The Bhagavat confirms their faith in their deities, and the fruits that they get from them are perishable. Here appears the same idea as that noticed in chap. IV and to be noticed in chap. IX, viz, that the worshippers of other gods are really Bhagavat&rsquo;s worshippers, and that there is a principle of unity in all religions.</p>
<p>§ 17. Chapter VIII.<sup id="fnref1:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> Arjuna begins by putting questions about the three subjects mentioned in the last verse of the last chapter, and about Brahman and Adhyātma. Bhagavat then explains these. About perceiving him at the time of death he says: &ldquo;He who leaves his body while remembering me at the time of death, attains to the same condition as mine.&rdquo; Finally he states that he who departs this life, while meditating on the all-knowing, eternal ruler, who is smaller than the smallest thing, who is the protector of all, whose form is unthinkable, whose brilliance is like that of the sun, and who is beyond all darkness—with devotion, his whole soul gathered between the brows with the power of concentration, reaches that Supreme Being, who is higher than the highest. He then mentions the attainment of the Unchangeable, with the mind concentrated, and the reaching of the final goal after leaving the body by means of a Yoga process and by the utterance of the syllable &lsquo;Om&rsquo; and the remembrance of Bhagavat all the while. Bhagavat is easily attainable by one who meditates on him with asingleness of mind and is devoted to him. Every being is subject to transmigration, but is free from it when he reaches Bhagavat.</p>
<p>During the night of Brahman all these things are resolved into the indiscrate (Avyakta), and, when the day dawns; they spring out again from it. There is another substance, different from the Avyakta and itself indiscrate (Avyakta), which is not destroyed when all others are destroyed. This substance which is indiscrete, is unchangeable and that is the highest resting place, which being attained to, there is no return. That is Bhagavat&rsquo;s highest abode. Thatsuprame soul, in whom all these beings are and who has spread out all this, is to he attained by single-minded devotion. Then he proceeds to mention the two paths. Those who die while the sun is in his northern course (Uttarāyaṇa) go to Brahman, and those who die while he is in his southern course (Dakṣināyana) go to the orb of the moon, from which the soul returns.</p>
<p>It is worthy of observation that after mentioning that the man who meditates on the Supreme at the time of death reaches him, he mentions the attain nent of the Akṣara, which is the highest</p>
<p>goal, by resorting to a Yoga process. This seems to be like looking back on the Yoga practices for the attainment of the Akṣara (Brahman) mentioned in the Upanṣiads, such as the Muṇḍaka (II. 2. 3), and the Śvetāśvatara ( I. 14). In the first passage, the syllable &lsquo;Om&rsquo; is compared to a bow, the soul to the arrow, and Brahman to the target which is to be hit. In the second a person is instructed to use his own body as the nether wooden piece and the Praṇava as the upper one, and, practising meditations, which is like rubbing of the wooden pieces against each other, to discover the God hidden like Agni in the pieces of wood. Here the Akṣara Brahman of the Muṇḍaka is transformed into Deva (God) in the Śvetāśvatara-Upanṣiad, and the Bhagavadgītā also prescribes the meditating on Bhagavat while the syllable &lsquo;Om&rsquo; is heing uttered. Here, therefore, we see the effort to invest the unchangeable and indiscrete Brahman with a strong distinct personality. Later on in the chapter, another Avyakta is mentioned, besides that into which all things are resolved at the dissolution of the universe. This Avyakta is eternal and indestructible and is called Akṣara and the highest goal. Here, however, this Aksara is at once rendered theistio by being spoken of as the highest abode or condition of Bhagavat</p>
<p>§ 18. Chapter IX. In this chapter Bhagavat proceeds to explain the direct and indirect knowledge which constitute the royal lore and the royal secret. It is to be directly perceived. It is holy and easy to be practised. The Bhagavat spread out all this universe. All things are in him and he is not in them, and still the objects are not in him. Wonderful is his lordly power. He is the sustainer of all beings and is not in them. His self brings all things into existence. As the air which exists in the sky is everywhere, so all beings are in him. At the dissolution of the world all beings are dissolved into his Prakṛti, and at the beginning of a new Kalps they are discharged forth again. All these acts do not contaminate him, as he does them without any desire. With himself as the director, the Prakṛti brings forth the moveable and immoveable things. Foolish men disregard him who has assumed a human form, not knowing his true nature, viz., that he is the lord and the great ruler of all; but great souls, assuming a godly nature, knowing him to be the origin of all beings, adore him</p>
<p>with single-mindedness. Some people worship him by Jñānayajñai. e., a rationalised sacrifice, taking him as one or several, or as having his face in all directions.</p>
<p>He is a subsidiary as well as the main sacrifice. He is Svadhā, herbs, Mantra, ghee. He is Agni and he is also oblation. He is father, mother, nourisher and grandfather of the world. He is Rc, Sāman, etc. He is the way, sustainer, lord, witness, shelter and friends etc. The knowers of the three Vedas, the drinkers of Soma, worshipping him by means of sacrifice, desire habitation in heaven, where they enjoy many pleasures. After their merit has been exhausted, they come back to the mortal world again. Those who thus follow the ritual of the three Vedas come and go. He looks after the welfare of those who think of him and meditate on him with single-mindedness and adore him. Those who worship. other deities must be considered as worshipping him, but they do so not according to prescribed rules. He is the receiver and lord of all kinds of Yajñas or worship, but those people do not know him as he really is, and therefore they fail. Those who worship other deities attain to them, and his worshippers attain to him. All the oblations thrown into the fire, all that is eaten and given and the austerities practised should be dedicated to him. In this way these actions do not serve as a bondage, and one becomes a real Saṁnyāsin and goes to him. He who adores Bhagavat with single-mindedness, becomes holy, even if he be wicked. He becomes immediately holy and obtains peace. Even women, Vaiśyas and Śūdras, when they resort to him, attain to the highest place. The seeker of the good should direct his mind towards him, should be his devotee, should worship him, should how to him, and acting in this way, and being thus fully devoted to him, he will reach him..</p>
<p>Here the performance of sacrificial rites is, in the manner which has become usual, mentioned as efficacious for the acquisition of a place in heaven. From this place persons return when their merit is exhausted, but there is no return when a man devotes himself to Bhagavat with all his heart. God is further personalised and brought home to man by being declared as his father, mother, nourisher, grandfather, friend, refuge, etc. The attitude to other gods is of toleration. The worship offered to</p>
<p>them is really offered to Bhagavat, but the worshippers do not know Bhagavat as he truly is, and therefore go wrong.</p>
<p>§ 19. Chapter X. The gods and Rṣis do not know the origin of Bhagavat. He was before them all. He who knows Bhagavat to be the unborn and unleginning lord of all worlds, is free from all sins. All the mental conditions, knowledge, absence of ignorance, forgiveness, truth, self-control, serenity, pain and pleasure, etc., are from him. The seven ancient Maharṣis and four Manus sprang from him, whose descendants are all these men. Good men adore Bhagavat with pure faith, knowing him to be the origin of all and that everything is set in motion by him. They, with their minds directed towards him, with their souls centred in him, enlighten each other, speak about him, and thus they are satisfied and are happy. Out of sympathy for them he dispels the darkness of ignorance by the light of knowledge, being himself in his true condition. When they adore him thus constantly full of love, he grants them that condition of mind by means of which they reach him.</p>
<p>Then questioned by Arjuna as to the Vibhūtis or excellent forms of each species or group, which pervade the world, Bhagavat proceeds to mention them. He is the soul that dwells in the heart of men and is the origin, the middle and the end of all beings. He is VViṣṇu of the Ādityas, the sun of all shining things, Kapila of the Siddhas, Prahlāda of all Daityas, Rāma of wielders of weapons, philosopoy (Adhyātma) of all lores, Dvandva of compounds, Kirti (fame) of all females, Vāsudeva of Vṛṣṇis and Dhanaṁjaya of Pāṇḍavas. That object which has excellence and splendour should be known as arising from his lustre.</p>
<p>There is to be observed here one special characteristic of the Bhakti school, and that is that all the devotees meet together, enlighten each other as to the nature of God, and contribute by discourses on him to each other&rsquo;s elevation and gratification. This is almost a characteristic mark of Bhaktas as distinguished from the Yogins, who have to go through their exercises singly and in solitute.</p>
<p>§20. Chapter XI. The Virāj form of God, i. e., all being looked at simultaneously as constituting one whole, as also his destructive</p>
<p>form, in which all enter into his mouth and are absorbed, is described in this chapter. Arjuna praises him that he does not see the end, the beginning, the middle of him, that he is the guardian of eternal righteousness and entreats him to give up this frightful form and assume the more usual and the more agreeable human form. In verse 30, Arjuna addresses him as Viṣṇu saying that his dazzling brilliance makes everything hot and his lustre has filled the whole universe.</p>
<p>The idea of looking at the universe as a form of god is as old as the Puruṣasūkta (RV. X. 90). God&rsquo;s having eyes everywhere, face everywhere, arms everywhere and the feet everywhere is expressed in RV. X. 81. 3. This verse is repeated in Śvetāśvatara-Upanṣiad III. 3.</p>
<p>§ 21. Chapter XII. This chapter starts with a question as to the difference between the contemplation on the original indiscrete cause which is unchangeable (Akṣara ), and the worship of him (Vāsudeva ), and the reply is, they are the best devotees, who, fixing their minds upon him, meditate on him with a concentrated attention and faith. Those who, with their senses restrained, meditate on the Indiscrete, Unchangeable, Undefinable, as existing everywhere and unthinkable, also reach him, but the trouble to them is greater. Bhagavat delivers from the ocean of death those, who, dedicating all their actions to him and meditating on him, worship him; and he teaches Arjuna to fix his mind on him and concentrate his will on him, and, if he cannot fix his mind firmly upon him, then to endeavour to obtain him by continued remembrance of him. If this last is not feasible, he should perform deeds for his sake, and doing this he would obtain success. If, however, he is not able to do this, with his mind fixed on him, he should abandon desire for the fruit of all his actions. Then follows an enumeration of the virtues of those who are devotees of God and are specially dear to him, such as not hating any being, being the friend of all, being humble, being indifferent to praise or censure, etc.</p>
<p>In this chapter the meditation on the Akṣara or unchangeable indiscrete cause is again mentioned as opposed to the worship of Bhagavat as a personal God. In similar passages in the previous chapters, the personalisation is effected at once by inserting a</p>
<p>clause applicable only to a personal God. But here the meditation on Avyakta is spoken of as successful, but is condemned as being very difficult to be practised, and the theistic aim of the work is kept in view.</p>
<p>§ 22. Chapter XIII. This body is the Kṣetra, and he who knows this body as his own, is Kṣetrajña. The Bhagavat is also Kṣetrajña in all the Kṣetras. This subject about the Kṣetra and Kṣetrajña has been variously treated by the Rṣis in verses of various metres, and determined by the words of the Brahmasūtra unfolding reasong Kṣetra consists of the twenty-four elements mentioned in the Sāṁkhya system and desire, hatred, pleasure and pain, and body, life and courage, which are Ātmaguṇas according to the Vaiśeṣikas. Bhagavat then proceeds to enumerate the virtues, such as humility, sincerity, etc., which consistute, it is said, Jñāna or knowledge, but which are to be taken as means to knowledge. Then arealluded to knowledge, or true philosophy, and its roverse. Нe then mentions the Jñeya, or thing to be known, and it is Parabrahman, which has no beginning nor end, which is neither existent nor non-existent, and which has hands and feet everywhere, and which has eyes, head and face everywhere, which has ears everywhere, and which pervades all. And thus the description of godhead proceeds in the words of the Upanṣiads.</p>
<p>Prakṛti and Puruṣa are unbeginning. All changes and qualities are produced from Prakṛti. Prakṛti is the cause in bringing about effect, and Puruṣa is the cause in the enjoyment and sufferance of happiness and misery. The Puruṣa, being connected with Prakṛti, enjoys or endures the properties or effects of the Prakṛti; and the cause is his being connected with the Guṇas or qualities. Besides all these various principles, there is in this body Puruṣa, the Supreme Soul, who is the witness of everything, who is the sustainer, enjoyer and the great lord. By meditation some see the self by self, others see it by Sāṁkhyayoga and Karmayoga. Any moving or unmoving thing that comes into existence is produced by the union of Kṣetra and Kṣetrajña. He, who sees the Supreme Lord equally in all things, who is not destroyed when other things are destroyed, sees truly. Seeing God equally in all things, a man does no injury to himself, and attains to the highest goal. He truly sees, who sees all acts as done by Prakṛti</p>
<p>and Puruṣa as not the actor. When he regards all seperate beings. as existing in one place, and sees development proceeding thence, he becomes Brahman. The Supreme Spirit, though dwelling in the body, does not do anything and is not contaminated, because he is unbeginning and is devoid of qualities and unchangeable. The spirit is not contaminated, just as space or ether existing. everywhere is not. Just as the sun illuminates the whole world, so does the Kṣetrajñailluminate the Kṣetra.</p>
<p>The Karmayoga, leading up to the condition of a Yogin, who looks at all things with the same regard and makes no distinction. between them and himself, has been described in the first six chapters. In the next six the Bhaktiyoga, or loving adoration of God, is the subject treated of; and the final effect of it is the formation of the fully righteous character which distinguishes aBhakta who is dear to Bhagavat. With chapter XIII begins the consideration of subsidiary subjects. In this Bhagavat speaks of the Kṣetra and Kṣetrajña, or the soul and its dwelling place, and of another soul, that is, himself also dwelling in the Kṣetra. In connection with this subject he refers to the poetic works of the previous Rsis and to the words of the Brahmasūtra.</p>
<p>What these works are it is difficult to say; but what follows is, first, the mention of the twenty-four principles generally associated with the Sāṁkhyasystem, as well as seven others, all of which constitute the Kṣetra; secondly, the enumeration of the virtues. that qualify one to the attainment of knowledge: thirdly, the statement about knowledge (Jñāna), or that which is true philosophy, and also Ajñāna, which is the reverse; and fourthly, the description of the Jñeya or the thing to be known, which is Parabrahman or the Supreme Soul. This last contains the attributes given in the Upaniṣads, and a verse and a half are verbally quoted from the SU. There are also other statements in the concluding verses which resemble KU. V. 11, and ŚU, V. 4. Then there is a statement about the nature of the Prakṛti and Puruṣaquite in keeping with the Sāṁkhyasystem; but the existence of the highest spirit in the body along with the animal soul is mentioned. Thus is the atheism of the Sāṁkhyasystem studiously avoided, whenever there is a reference to its doctrines. Then</p>
<p>follow reflections on God and the seeing of the Supreme Soul everywhere.</p>
<p>The works, therefore, upon which this chapter is based are some of the Upaniṣads and some treatises setting forth the constitution of the world and the principles of morality. These treatises may have been the discourses first independent and afterwards included in the Śāntiparvan and other parts of the Mahābhārata, or they may have been others of which we have no trace; but there is no mention here of the Sāṁkhya system by name nor a special reference to it as elaborated in later times by Īśvarakṛṣṇa. The idea of the twenty-four principles is ancient and seems to have been appropriated afterwards by the founders. of the philosophic systems, as it suited their purpose. But no chronological conclusions can be deduced from the mention of those twenty-four principles. The doctrine that all action proceeds from the Prakṛti, and the soul is inactive and simply enjoys or suffers, which is a true Sāṁkhya doctrine, but is calculated. to absolve a man from moral responsibility, is also mentioned; but it appears to come incidentally along with the twenty-four principles.</p>
<p>§ 23. Chapter XIV. The great Brahman is the womb (Yoni) for Bhagavat into which he throws seed. Of all the wombs that produce bodily forms, Brahman is the greatest. Bhagavat then proceeds to detail the nature of the three Guṇas, their products and their results in the future world. These Guṇas prove as bondage, and when they are got over, then the man is free from the bondage. and becomes immortal. The distinguishing characteristic of one who is free from these three Guṇas is a quiet undisturbed serene mood, in which happiness and misery are alike, and gold, olod of earth and stone are alike, in which agreeable and disagreeable. things are alike, and praise and censure are also alike, etc. He who invariably resorts to Bhagavatby Bhaktiyoga becomes free from these three Guṇas and attains to the condition of Brahman.Bhagavat is the support of the immortal and unchanging Brahman and of eternal righteousness (duty) and of unending happiness.</p>
<p>Here then is a distinct affirmation of the soul&rsquo;s attainment of freedom from passions by means of continuous devotion to Bhaga</p>
<p>vat or God. The word Brahmayoni occurs in MU. III. 1. 3, and is to be interpreted, in the light of the opening statement in the above, as one whose Yoni is Brahman.</p>
<p>§ 24. Chapter XV. Bhagavat proceeds to the comparison of Saṁsāra, or the whole extent of things, to the Pippal-tree. This tree is to be cut by the weapon of indifference or non-attachment; and then should be sought that place from which there is no return. One should surrender himself to the original Puruṣa. Those reach that unchanging position or place, who are free from pride, ignorance, desires, and the pair of happiness and misery. That is the highest abode of Bhagavat, which is not illuminated by the sun, the moon or the fire. When a soul departs from a body, it takes away the Indriyas, of which Manas is the sixth, and brings them in when it assumes another body. The soul itself is a part of Bhagavat and is eternal. This soul, placing itself in these six Indriyas, resorts to all objects of sense. The brilliance. existing in the sun, which illumines the whole world, and which exists in the moon as well as in fire, is to be known as that of Bhagavat. By becoming Soma, Bhagavat raises all herbs. By becoming fire be contributes to digestion. He dwells in the heart. of all. From him proceeds consciousness of one&rsquo;s condition, knowledge, and the rejection of what is not true. Bhagavat alone is to be known by means of all the Vedas and as the author of Vedāntas and the knower of the Veds. There are two souls in the world, one that changes, and the other that is unchangeable. Besides these. there is another who is the highest and is called Paramātman, and who as the unchangeable lord supports all the three worlds after entering into them. Bhagavat is known to be that Highest Soul in the ordinary world and also in the Vedas.</p>
<p>There is one new point brought out in this chapter. And that is that the animal soul goes out of the body along with the six senses and enters new ones in that condition.The comparison of the composite universe to the Pippal-tree ocours in KU. (VI.1), MaiU. (VI. 4), and the non-illumination of the highest abode of Bhagavat is mentioned in a verse in KU. (V. 15), MU, (II. 2. 10), and SU. (VI. 14). The doctrine of the existence of the third highest Puruṣa should also be noted as a characteristic of this theistic work. The triad, Kṣara, Akṣara or Ātman (individual</p>
<p>soul), and the ruling one God, is mentioned in SU. (I. 10), which work is a precursor of the Bhagavadgītā.</p>
<p>§ 25. Chapter XVI. Bhagavat now proceeds to enumerate the virtues which constitute the divine endowments (DaivīSaṁpad), and the vices that constitute demoniacal possessions. From divine. endowments results final deliverance, and from the demoniacal possessions, follows destruction. There are two classes of created beings: one is divine and the other demoniacal. In persons of the latter class there is no purity nor correct conduct nor truth. They regard the world as unreal, without substratum or support, without God, disconnected and what more, springing from lust. Holding this view these wicked and dull persons with their ferocious deeds bring about the destruction of the world. Full of insatiable lust and possessed of vanity, pride, and arrogance, they act in an un holy manner, sticking to their own false conceits. They accumulate wealth by foul means for enjoyment and boasting of their possessions, their power, their parentage, they treat others with contempt and eventually go to the infernal regions. If they worship at all, they simply utter the name and assume a false garb. They are full of egotism and hate Bhagavat, as abiding in their own bodies and those of others. These wicked men he consigns to the race of the demons. Desire, anger and covetousness. are the three doors to hell. These three, therefore, should be abandoned. He who avoids these three doors reaches the highest goal. He who abandons sacred precepts and acts according. to his own will, does not obtain success, happiness or the highest goal. The sacred precepts must, therefore, be followed whenever a man has to do anything or avoid anything.</p>
<p>Here two classes of men, good and bad, are mentioned. Among the latter are included not only worldly men who do not care for God or morality, but the followers of philosophical or religious systems, different from that of Bhagavat seem also to be included. They set aside the sacred Śāstra or precepts, denied God, as Buddhists and Jainas did, and regarded the world as unsubstantial or unreal, as the former did.</p>
<p>§ 26. Chapter XVII. Arjuna asks: &ldquo;What is the frame of mind of those who set aside the sacred precepts and still worship</p>
<p>with faith? Is it characterised by the quality of goodness, activity or ignorance?&rdquo; Bhagavat answers: &ldquo;Faith is of three kinds, characterised by goodness, activity, and darkness or ignorance. The faith of a man depends upon the quality of his heart. A man is what faith makes of him. As is his faith, so is the man&rdquo;. The good worship gods, the active, Yakṣas and Rakṣases or evil spirits, and the ignorant, ghosts and spectres. Men of demoniacal frame of mind perform terrible ansterities full of ostentation and egotism, and cause attenuation of the elements composing the body and of the Bhagavat who dwells in it. He then mentions three kinds of food, modes of worship, austerities and gifts, in keeping with the threo qualities. For instance, in the case of worship or sacrifice, that is in keeping with the quality of goodness, which is performed without any regard for the fruit and in accordance with the sacred ritual. That springs from the quality of activity, which is done for the attainment of fruit and out of ostentation; and that which is done without regard for the sacred precepts and without Dakṣiṇāor rewards to the priest and without any faith, proceeds from the quality of ignorance. As to charitable gifts, those spring from the quality of goodness, which are made because it is a duty to give to one from whom no return is expected; while that which is made with an interested motive and with a desire for return, springs from the quality of activity. And in this manner all the four subjects are treated. At the end the doing of good acts by is mentioned. the repetition of the syllables &ldquo;Om, tat, sat&rdquo; is mentioned.</p>
<p>In this chapter the truth that man&rsquo;s religious faith and the character of the God that he worships, depend upon his own character whether good or bad, is clearly recognised. Not only the nature of the God worshipped, but also the diet, the mode of worship, charity or gifts, and the practice of austerity differ according as a man&rsquo;s nature is influenced by one or other of the three qualities, goodness, activity, and ignorance.</p>
<p>§ 27.Chapter XVIII. This chapter begins with a question by Arjuna as to the principles of renunciation and abandonment. Bhagavat replies that renunciation is the giving up of works springing from desires, and abandonment is the abandonment of fruits of actions. Some say that all Karmian should be abandond; others say that worship, charity and austerity should not be given</p>
<p>up. The decision is that these last should not be abandoned, as they bring about purity of the soul.The actions should be done. without being attached to them or desiring for the fruits. That duty that must be done, should not be abandoned. Giving up. that duty is an ignorant deed. When action is avoided because it is wearisome, its abandonment springs from the quality of passion. When the essential action is done because it should be done without any desire for fruit or attachment, that abandonment springs from goodness. It is not possible for a living being. to abandon all actions. He who abandons only the fruit, is really. one who has abandoned actions. According to the Sāṁkhya doctrine, there are five different causes: the resting place, agent, instrument, varied movements and fate. In this manner it goes on, Some acts or states of mind are represented to vary according. to the three qualities, such as knowledge, the deed done and the doer, Buddhi or will, firmness and happiness, and the duties of the different castes.</p>
<p>The man who worships Him, from whom all beings have sprung and who has spread out all this, by doing the duties assigned to him, for which the three qualities have fitted him, attains final success. He then proceeds to mention all those virtues and other states of mind, such as self-control, freedom and passions, which conduce to the realisation of the Brahma-condition. When this condition is realised, a man is free from sorrow and desire, and, being equally disposed towards all beings, he develops in himself the highest love for Bhagavat, and knowing Bhagavat fully and truly,enters into the Bhagavat. One should do all acts, intent only upon God, and then one obtains the eternal place by the favour of God. A man should fix his mind upon Bhagavat alone, dedicating all his actions to him, and then he gets over all evils by the grace of Bhagavat.</p>
<p>Then Bhagavat winds up the whole by teaching Arjuna to surrender himself with all his heart to God (the Ruler), who abides in the hearts of all things and moves them, as if forming parts of a wheel; and then he says, by his favour Arjuna would obtain perfect peace and an eternal resting-place. He is further instructed to dedicate his whole mind to Bhagavat, to become</p>
<p>his devotee, to worship him, to bow to him, and in this way he (Arjuns) would reach him. This is styled the deepest secret. Then Arjuna is told to set aside all other methods of salvation and surrender himself to Bhagavat alone, and Bhagavat would then. free him from all his sins. And thus the chapter ends.</p>
<p>This is the Ekāntika Dharms or monotheistic religion, which,as the Nārāyaṇīya tells us, was communicated to Arjuna. The method of salvation here revealed is to lead a life of action, but the fruit of the action one should not be intent on. The action should be done disinterestedly, that is, a man should be selfless in doing it. The action should be dedicated to Brahman, that is, it should be done because the Universal Order requires it to be done. This is tantamount to saying that one should do one&rsquo;s duty. because it is a duty. When a more personel interpretation is given to it, the doctrine comes to this, that one should act with the sole object of carrying out God&rsquo;s will. The frame of mind. that is generated by consistently acting in this manner, is free- dom from passion, a sense of the omnipresence of God and an equal regard for all things. This leads to the realisation of the highest love of God, and, knowing Bhagavat thoroughly, by this means a man is absorbed in him.</p>
<p>But to do one&rsquo;s duty consistently and selflessly is a matter difficult, since all beings are subject to the influence of the three. qualities or, in our modern phraseology, of passions and appetencies.These can be got over by surrendering oneself to God.</p>
<p>VI. The Sources of the Religion of the Bhagavadgītā.</p>
<p>§ 28. This constant insistence on action being done without any regard for the fruit, that is, distinterestedly or selflessly. forms &amp; peculiarity of the Bhagavadgītā. But the idea is not new. In the Īśopaniṣad it is stated in the second verse, that a man should desire to live a hundred years doing actions resolutely. and in that way and no other, will action not contaminate him. And the non-contamination as the result of an elevated state of mind is spoken of in ChU. IV. 14. 3; BU. 4. 23; and MaiU. VI. 20.</p>
<p>The attributes of the Supreme Being the Gītādraws from the Upaniṣads, as has been already shown in the remarks on the different chapters. While the personality of God is fully acknowledged in certain parts of the Upaniṣads, mere Brahman, the personality of which is not so distinct, is also spoken of in some places. When the Bhagavadgītātakes in these passages, it takes care to distinctly personalise the Akṣara or Brahman, as we have. shown. The source from which the Gītā derives its doctrines about the conquest of the self and the attainment of a condition of a peace and serenity, is the general atmosphere of religious and moral sentiment, that came to prevail from the beginning of the earliest Upaniṣad speculations to the formation of definite roligious systems,orthodox and heterodox.Consequently, though the Gītā speaks of the Brahma-Nirvāṇa, it ought not to be supposed that it borrows this doctrine of final peace and serenity from Buddhism. The source resorted to by these systems was commonto all.</p>
<p>Besides the Upaniṣads and the religious and moral atmosphere. prevalent at that time, the Gītā avails itself of the philosophy that. had come into existence in early times. This is the philosophy. of the Sāṁkhya and the Yoga. Though the twenty-four principles. of the former system, together with the Puruṣa or soul as the twenty-fifth, as known in later times, and the doctrine of the activity of the Prakṛti only and the non-activity of Puruṣa, aro alluded to in the Bhagavadgītā, still it adds another soul called the Uttama Puruṣa or the Supreme Soul, which is not found in the later Sāṁkhya, thus giving a theistic character to the philosophy. In their account of the creation, the Puraṇas follow this philosophy, and the later Vaiṣṇava and Śaivasystems adopt it in a more or less qualified manner.</p>
<p>But the word Sāṁkhya does not seem to be used in the Bhagavadgītā to indicate the later non-theistic system. In the second chapter and in the fifth, Sāṁkhya indicates &amp; philosophy based upon knowledge, and Yogs, one based on action. Again the five causes, that are alluded in the last chapter as mentioned in the Sāṁkhya system, do not appear to be known. to the later Sāṁkhya. The speculative philosophy, therefore, that existed about the time of the Śvetāśvatara-Upaniṣad and the Bhagavadgītā, was known by the name of Sāṁkhya, and out. of it grew the non-theistic system of later times. The Yoga,</p>
<p>the philosophy of action, too did prevail, but it culminated, as indicated before, into a concentration of mind, the ordinary operation being suspended, on the Brahman, Akṣara, or the Supreme Soul.</p>
<p>§ 29. Thus the Bhagavadgītāis the result of development of the religious and philosophic speculation that prevailed before the rise of Buddhism. But the origin of the idea of Bhakti, or love. of God, which is the characteristic of the work, has formed the subject of a great deal of speculation in modern times, and to this point we will now turn. In the Upaniṣads, Upāsanã, or fervent meditation of a number of things such as Manas (mind), the sun, the Puruṣa in the sun or the moon, food, vital breath, etc., regarded as Brahman, i.e., thinking of them as Brahman-is proscribed. Such a fervent meditation cannot but magnify the thing and give it a glorious form so as to excite admiration and even love. Again what is called the Internal Ātman (soul) is said in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka to be dearer than a son, wealth and everything. else (I. 4. 8.). Here the word Ātman may possibly be taken to mean one&rsquo;s own soul. In the same Upaniṣad there is another passage which runs thus: &ldquo;This is that Great Unborn, who is of the form of thought among vital airs, who dwells in the cavity of the heart, who is controller of all, ruler of all, the lord of all, By doing good or evil deeds he does not become better or worse. He is the ruler of all beings, he is the causeway or dike that separates things from one another and prevents them being confused together (he is the preserver of order). The Brāhmaṇas desire to know him by the words of the Vedas, by worship, charity and austerity. Knowing him, one becomes a sage. The recluses desiring him as the place to live in, renounce the world. On this account the wise, men of old did not desire progeny, saying to themselves: What shall we do with progeny, when we have got this Being, this world to live in?&rsquo;; and thus they gave up desire for sons, wealth and the world and lived the life of mendicants&rdquo; (IV. 4. 22).</p>
<p>Now, if those wise men of old gave up all the pleasures of the world to contemplate and dwell with the Supreme Being, so eloquently described, must it not be considered that they were actuated by love for Him, though the word Bhakti does not occur</p>
<p>here? And at the bottom of all those rapturous sayings about the peace attained by seeing the Supreme Soul in the world and the heart of man, there must be a feeling akin to love. And during the period when the Ṛgveda poetry was composed, love for God or gods was often an abiding sentiment in the heart of the poet, as is evident from the words: &ldquo;Dyaus is my father&rdquo; (RV. I. 104. 33), &ldquo;Aditi (the boundless) is father, mother, and son&rdquo; (RV. I. 89. 10); and from such prayers as &quot; O father Dyaus, avert all evils&rdquo;, &ldquo;Be accessible to us and gracious as a father to the son&rdquo;, etc. Though the later sacrificial ritual destroyed the spirit of these verses and converted them into simple verbal formulae, still, the feeling that was in the heart at the time when they were composed, must have continued, though it found no expression for a time and exhibited itself again mixed with wonder and admiration in the times of the Upaniṣads. It certainly was not absent during this last period. The text about the two birds, the friends and companions of each other, by which are meant the Supreme and Individual souls exists in the Ṛksaṁhitā(I. 164. 20) and is repeated in the Muṇḍaka-Upanişad (VII. 1.1).</p>
<p>In the last (MU. III. 2. 3), and in the KU. (II. 23), there is a verse to the effect that this Supreme Soul is not to be attained by lectures (from a teacher), nor by intelligence, nor by much learning; he is to be attained by him whom the Supreme Soul favours; to him he discloses his form. Again we have the dootrine that the supremely wise Being, the life of all, leads a man to do good deeds, whom he desires to elevate (KBU. III. 8); and another, that God dwelling in the heart of all beings, controls. them which latter forms the subject of a celebrated passage in the BU. III. 7. From this it is clear that the doctrine that the individual soul is dependent on the Supreme and that the latter alone works out his salvation, was acknowledged in Upaniṣad times.</p>
<p>§ 30. In this manner all the points that constitute the Ekāntika religion of the Bhagavadgītāare to be found in the older religious. literature. The word Bhakti, however, in the sense of love is not to be found except in a verse in SU. But that word is not alwaysused in the sense of love even by Rāmānuja. In his system Bhakti means constant meditation and corresponds to the Upāsanāof</p>
<p>the Upaniṣads. The word etymologically signifies resorting to and then loving the thing resorted to. It is used in this sense by Pāṇini in Sūtra IV. 3.95; but the word, as explained by the commentators, has a passive sense and means a thing resorted. to, liked or loved: and general and special terminations are prescribed, which, when affixed to a noun, indicate one by whom the thing expressed by the noun is liked or loved. In this senso the word Bhakti is used by Yāska also, when he speaks of certain things ns Agnibhaktīni, Indrabhaktīni, i. o., things which resort to, or relate themselves to, Agni, occ. Thus the idea of love was associated with the word in early times, though it then signified loved instead of love. Properly speaking, by the rules of Pāṇini himself, it ought to signify the latter, as the suffix // indicates Bhāva or condition. Howsoevor the word may have come into use in later tintes, the thing expressed by it. viz., love for the Ātman or the Supreme Suul, was an idea implied and often expressed by the word Priya or Prayas in the Upaniṣad period.</p>
<p>§ 31. The state of things which must have led to the evoluttion of the religion of the Gītā seems to me to be this. About the time when the systems of religion we have been considering Brose, there was a tendency amongst the people which often worked itself out, as is evident from the Pali Birth-Stories, to give up worldly life and betake themselves to a residence in forests or mountains. Even Buddhism, Jainism and other like systems considered an ascetic life to be a sine qua non of religious elevation. There is reason to believe that Śramaṇas existed before the rise of Buddhism. The religious systems that had sprung up were mostly atheistic. The Indian mind had become prone to indulge in mere moral discourses and thoughts of moral exaltasion, unassociated with a theistic faith, as appears clear from Buddhism and other systems, and also from dry moral dissertations of which the Mahābhāratais fall. Such a system as that of the Bhagavadgītā was, therefore, necessary to counterset these tendencies. Theistic ideas were so scattered in the Upaniṣads, that it was necessary for practical purposes to work them up into a system of redemption capable of bing grasped castiy.</p>
<p>These appear to be the conditions under which the Gītācame</p>
<p>into existence. I am not inclined to dissolve Vāsudeva and Arjuna into solar myths; but Vāsudeva could not have been living when the Bhagavadgītāwas composed as a discourse delivered by him, any more than Buddha was living when his discourses were. reduced to the form of books. It is worthy of remark that both of them are called Bhagavats when speaking. Vāsudeva must already have been doified before the Bhagavadgītāwas written.</p>
<p>As regards the attitude of the Bhagavat to the older belief, it is evident that it is conservative and he came to fulfil the law and not supersede it. It must already have been seen that he looks at the sacrificial religion from almost the same point of view as the Upaniṣads. The cherishing of desires which the sacrificial rites encourged is considered harmful, and the fruit attained by means of them is perishable. It was because this. Ekāntikareligion was so conservative, that it gradually made its way into Hindu society in general, though it did not succeed. in uprooting the religion of sacrifices. Still it always retained. its character as a religion for women and for all castes, Śūdras included, and in its later development it was associated with such Vedic rites as then remained when it was professed by the Brāhmaṇas, but not so associated when its followers were of lower castes, among whom it continued to exercise great influence. The Bhagavat&rsquo;s attitude towards the worshippers of other gods. has already been explained. It was strictly liberal. All worship. to whomsoever it was directed, reaches him ultimately, but the devotees of other gods do not know Bhagavat as he truly is and thus go wrong. This attitude must have had something to do with the influence of the Vāsudeva-Kṛṣṇa cult over the lower classes.</p>
<p><strong>VII. Identification of Vāsudeva with Nārāyaṇa.</strong></p>
<p>§ 32. The word Nārāyaṇais similar to Nāḍāyaṇa, which last is formed by P. IV. 1. 99 and means the Gotra Nāḍāyaṇa. The termination is significative and means in this case the resting place or the place to which Nāḍa or a collection of Naḍas go. So Nārāyaṇameans the resting place or goal of Nāra or a collection of Nāras<sup id="fnref1:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. In theNārāyaṇīya (XII. 341) Keśava or</p>
<p>Hari says to Arjuna that he is known as the resting place or goal of men (Narāṇām). The word Nṛor Naṛa is also used to denote gods as manly persons, especially in the Vodas, so that Nārāyaṇa may be construed as the resting place or goal of gods. There is a tradition which connects Nārāyaṇa with the primeval waters. Manu (1.10), and also Hari in the above passage say that the waters were called Nārās because they were the sons of Nara, and, since they were the first resting place of Brahmāin the first case and of Hari in the second, the two were called Nārāyaṇas. The Purāṇas, such as the Vāyu and the Viṣṇu, agree with Manu. Again there is a tradition that Brahmadeva sprang from the lotus in the navel of Nārāyaṇa or Viṣṇu (M Bh. III, 12, 34 and XII 349. 18), In the Vāyu-Purāṇa Nārāyaṇa is represented as prior to Avyakta or matter in an undeveloped form, and from Avyakta sprang the mundane egg, and from the latter arose Brahmadeva.</p>
<p>All these traditions in various forms seem to go back to RV. X. 82.5 and 6, which may be thus translated: &ldquo;Prior to the sky, prior to this earth, prior to the living gods, what is that embryo. which the waters held first and in which all the gods existed? The waters held that same embryo in which all gods exist or find themselves; on the navel of the unborn stood something in which. all beings stood&rdquo;. In this we have first the waters mentioned; on those waters stood the embryo, which corresponds to the Brahmāof the later tradition, who created everything; and the unborn corresponds to Nārāyaṇa from whose navel he sprang. In this embryo all the gods, it is said, found themselves. This corresponds to the Naras, men or gods, whose goal or resting place was Nārāyaṇa, so that this confirms the identity between Brahmāand Nārāyaṇa mentioned by Manu and some of the Purāṇas. Nārāyaṇa therefore, who,by the other authorities cited above, is considered prior to Brahmadeva and to the Svayaṁbhūof Manu, is another. person and has a cosmic character and is not a historical or mythological individual. This idea of Nārāyaṇa was developed in the period of the later Brāhmaṇas and Āraṇyakas.</p>
<p>In the Śatapatha-Brāhmaṇa (XII. 3. 4), Puruṣa Nārāyaṇa is represented to have sent forth from the place of sacrifice Vasus, Rudras and Ādityas by means of the morning, midday and evening libations respectively, he alone remaining in the place, Fra</p>
<p>jāpati tells him to sacrifice again, and the substance of the whole. is that Nārāyaṇaplaced himself in all the worlds, in all the gods, in all the Vedas and in all the vital airs, and they were placed in him. This shadows forth the rising of Nārāyaṇato the dignity of the Supreme Soul, who pervades all and in whom all things. exist and who in the beginning sent forth all the gods, being himself their receptacle or resting place as indicated in RV. X. 82. 6. In another place (XIIL 6. 1) Puruṣa Nārāyaṇais mentioned as having conceived the idea of a Pañcarātra Sattra (continued sacrifices for five days) as the means of obtaining superiority over all beings and becoming all beings. He performed the sacrifices and attained to that dignity. Here also Nārāyaṇa&rsquo;s becoming the Supreme Ruler and becoming all are spoken of, Nārāyaṇais represented as the author of the Puruṣasūkta (RV. X. 90). This appears to be as much a fanciful representation, as that of Viśvakarman and others as authors of other hymns As in these last cases, it has a connection with the deity to which the hymn refers, so that Nārāyaṇa is another name of the Puruṣa, and these two names are associated together, as we have seen, in the above citations from the Śatapatha-Brāhmana. In the Taittiriya-Āraṇyaka (X. 11) Nārāyaṇais described with all the attributes of the Supreme soul, which are usually found mentioned in the Upaniṣads.</p>
<p>In the Mahābhārata and Purāṇas, he figures as the supreme god, especially in connection with the creation; mythologically he is represented as lying on the body of a huge serpent in the ocean. of milk, the original conception of his connection with the primeval waters being still kept to. Nārāyaṇathus became an object of worship. In the Ghosuṇḍi Inscription noticed before<sup id="fnref1:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>, there is what appears to be a dedication of an enclosure to Nārāyaṇa(Nārāyaṇa-Vāṭikā),</p>
<p>§33. The heaven of this Nārāyaṇawas the Śvetadvīpa or white. island. In the Kathāsaritsāgara (54. 19, 21, 23) Naravāhanadatta is represented to have been carried to the white island by Devasiddhi and to Hari reposing on the body of the serpent Śeṣa and attended by Nārada and other devotees. In another place in the same work (115, 101-3) certain gods are spoken of as having gone to Śvetadvīpa and seen Hari in a house made of great gems,</p>
<p>lying on the serpent bed with Lakṣmīsitting at his feet. In the Harivaṁśa (14,384 ) it is stated that Yogins and Kāpilasāṁkhyas, who desire Mokṣa or final deliverance, go to the white island or Śvetadvīpa, by reciting the prayer and praise composed by Balin. Evidently, therefore, Śvetadvīpa or white island is the heaven in which Nārāyaṇa, spoken of sometimes as Hari, dwells. It corresponds to the Vaikuṇṭha of Viṣṇu, the Kailāsa of Śiva, and the Goloka of Gopālakṛṣṇna; and to that heaven of Nārāyaṇa it was that Nārada went and saw him and learned from him the monotheistic religion of Vāsudeva. There is, therefore, no need to suppose that the white island was a Christian country peopled by white races .</p>
<p>§ 34. Nārāyaṇa, being thus evolved as the Supreme Being in the later Brāhmanicperiod, was, of course, prior to Vāsudeva, and in the epic times when the worship of the latter arose, Vāsudeva was identified with Nārāyaṇa. In the Vanaparvan (chaps. 188, 189) there is a description of the condition of things at the time of dissolution of the universe, in which it is stated that there. was water everywhere and there was a boy lying on couch on a branch of a Nyagrodha tree. He opened his mouth and took in Mārkaṇḍeya, who roamed in the inside and saw the whole universe and was struck with wonder. Then the boy vomited or threw him out, when he saw again the waters alone. Mārkaṇḍeya then asked the boy who he was; then he said: &ldquo;Formerly I gave to the waters the name of Nārāḥ, and those were my resting place (Ayana), and therefore I am Nārāyaṇa&rdquo;, and thus he goes on to describe his greatness. Finally Mārkaṇḍeya, who tells the whole story, says. to Yudhiṣṭhira that Janārdana, his relative, is this same Nārāyaṇa. The burden of the whole of the Nārāyaṇīya section seems to be this identity between Nārāyaṇa and Vāsudeva.</p>
<p>Besides this Nārāyaṇa, the creator of all, there was a tradition about another who was always associated with Nara. This companionship seems to be traceable to the Upaniṣad idea of two birds. dwelling in a tree, friends and associates of each other. That one of those, who is called the lord and the onlooker, is in the present. tradition Nārāyaṇa, and the other, who is engaged in eating the fruit of the tree, Nara. The old idea was transferred to the new conception of Nārāyaṇa as the resting place or abode of all men. In</p>
<p>the opening chapter of the Nārāyaṇīya it is stated that Nārāyaṇathe eternal soul of the universe, with four forms became the son of Dharma. The four forms or four sons were Nara, Nārāyaṇa, Hari and Kṛṣṇa. The first two of these devoted themselves to the practice of austerities in the Badarikāśrama.</p>
<p>The same story is given in the Vāmana-Purāṇa (chap. 6). These four are represented as the sons of Dharma and had Ahiṁsā(non-killing) as their mother. This story seems to be significant. About the time when the new systems of religion arose, the ideas. that were undergoing fermentation were Dharma or righteousness and Ahiṁsāor non-slaughter, as against the old ceremonial of sacrificial rites and the killing of animals in accordance with it. These four names, therefore, were names connected with the introduction of a new system of religion, not heterodox, which concerned itself with righteousness and non-slaughter of animals. That is what appears to be meant by Dharma being called the father of these four and Ahiṁsātheir mother.</p>
<p>Nara and Nārāyaṇaare sometimes called Ṛṣis, and that is probably to be traced to the conception of Nārāyaṇaas the Rṣi or composer of the Puruṣasūkta. These gods must have been very famous at the time when the Mahābhārata was composed, since in the opening stanza of the different books obeisance is made to these two gods. In the Vanaparvan (12. 46, 47) Janārdana is represented to have said to Arjuna: &ldquo;Oh invincible one, thou art Nara and I am Hari Nārāyaṇa, and we, the sages Nara-Nārāyaṇa, have come to this world at the proper time; thou art not different from me, oh Pārtha, and I am not different from thee; it is not possible to know any difference between us.&rdquo; In chap. 30 (verse 1) of the same Parvan, the God of gods (Śiva) says to Arjuna: &ldquo;In a former birth (body) thou wast Nara and with Nārāyaṇafor thy companion, performedst austerities for many thousands of years in Badari&rdquo;. In the Udyogaparvan (49.19) it is said: &ldquo;The two heores, Vāsudeva and Arjuna, who are great warriors, are the old gods Naraand Nārāyaṇa. This is the tradition.&rdquo; In this manner there are a good many examples of the identification of Arjuna and Vāsudeva with Nara and Nārāyaṇa. And thus the old tradition about the two Ṛṣis who</p>
<p>are warriors at the same time was brought into connection with the two interlocutors of the Bhagavadgītā.</p>
<p><strong>VIII. Identification of Vāsudeva with Viṣṇu.</strong></p>
<p>§ 35. Viṣṇu is a Vedic deity. There are but few hymns addressed to him in ṚV., but his personality is by no means unimportant. The long strides which he takes, and the three steps: by which he measures the universe, are always described with an enthusiastic spirit. His first two steps can be discerned and approached by men, but the third no one car dare transgress, and it is beyond the flight of birds (ṚV. I. 155.5). The wise see the highest place of Viṣṇu(Paramam padam), as it were an eye fixed in the heaven (ṚV. I. 22. 201. In the highest place of Viṣṇu there is a well of honey, and there the gods rejoice (ṚV. I 154, 5). Viṣṇu appears as the comrade and helper of Indra.</p>
<p>Viṣṇu, however, in spite of his comparatively subordinate position in ṚV, began to rise in importance in the time of the Brāhmaṇas, while during the epic and Purāṇic period he rose to the rank of the supreme spirit. The moment which seems to have been in operation during this process of elevation, was reverence for the third step or the mysterious highest abode of Viṣṇu beyond the ken of all. In the Brāhmaṇic period we have the mention of Agni as the lowest of the gods and Viṣṇu as the highest (AB.1.1). Then we have a story in Śatapatha-Brāhmaṇa and Taittiriya-Āraṇyaka of a sacrificial session held by the gods for the attainment of splendour, glory and food. They proposed to themselves that he amongst them, who by his deeds reached the end of the sacrifice before the others, should attain the highest place among them all. Viṣṇu reached the end before the others, and he thus became the highest of the gods; and therefore they say that Viṣṇu is the highest of the gods (ŚB. XIV. 1. 1.). When this was written, Viṣṇu had already attained to the supreme dignity, and the story is invented to account for it. There is again in the same Brāhmaṇa (1. 2. 5) the story of Viṣṇu the dwarf. When the gods and Asuras were contending for a place of sacrifice, the latter agreed that they would allow as much land for the former as was equal to the size of the dwarf. Viṣṇu was then made to lie down, but gradually he grew so large as to encompass the</p>
<p>whole earth, and so the gods got the whole earth. Here a miraculous power has been attributed to Viṣṇu, though he is not necessarily the Supreme Spirit.</p>
<p>In the Maitri-Upaniṣad (VI. 13) food is called the form of Bhagavad-Viṣṇu, which sustains the universe. In the Kaṭha-Upaniṣad (III. 9) the progress of the human soul is compared to a journey, and the end of the path which he traverses is called. the highest place of VViṣṇu (Paramam padam). This is the final goal and the abode of eternal bliss, and the use of the word in this sense lends support to the view that the elevation of Viṣṇu to the dignity of the Supreme Being was due to the fact that the expression was capable of being used to denote this sense. Some time after, Viṣṇu became even a household god. In the ceremony of the seven steps contained in the marriage ritual, the bridegroom has to say to the bride, when she puts forth a step :&rdquo; May Viṣṇu lead you or be with you.&rdquo; This formula occurs in the Gṛhya-sūtras of Āpastamba, Hiraṇyakeśin and Pāraskara, but not in that of Āśvalāyana. In epic times Viṣṇu grew to be in every respect. the Supreme Spirit; and Vāsudeva is identified with Viṣṇu. In chapters 65 and 66 of the Bhīṣmaparvan noticed before<sup id="fnref1:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>, the Supreme Spirit is addressed as Nārāyaṇa and Viṣṇu and is identified with Vāsudeva.</p>
<p>In the Anugītā portion of the Āśvamedhikaparvan (chap.53-55) Kṛṣṇa, while returning to Dvārakā, meets on the way a sage of the name of Uttaṅka of the Bhṛgu race. The sage asks Kṛṣṇa whether he had established peace between the contending kinsmen, Pāṇḍus and Kurus, and established affectionate relations between them. Kṛṣṇa replies that the Kurus had been destroyed and the Pāṇḍus were in possession of the supreme sovereignty. The sage got angry and said that he would pronounce a curse against Kṛṣṇa , but if he explained to him the philosophy of the soul (Adhyātma), he would desist. Kṛṣṇa then does explain this philosophy at the request of Uttaṅka and shows him his universal form (Virāt svarūpam). The Svarūpa is the same as, or similar to, that shown to Arjuns according to the Bhagavadgītā, but it is here called the Vaiṣṇava form (Rūpa), which name does not occur. in the other passage. Thus then between the period of the Bhāga</p>
<p>vadgītāand that of the Anugītā, the identity of Vāsudeva-Kṛṣṇa with Viṣṇu had become an established fact. In the Śāntiparvan (chap. 43) Yudhiṣṭhira addressing Kṛṣṇa sings a hymn of praise, in which Kṛṣṇa is identified with Viṣṇu. In the epic times, Viṣṇu is regarded as the Supreme Spirit, but the names of Nārāyaṇa and Vāsudeva-Viṣṇu apparently occur more frequently or are more. prominent.</p>
<p>§ 36. Still many parts of the Māhābharata represent a condi tion of things in which the divinity Vāsudeva-Kṛṣṇa was not generally acknowledged. In the above passage from the Anugītā, the sage Uttaṇka is about to pronounce a curse on Kṛṣṇa, as if he was an ordinary individual, and desists only when his universal form is shown to him. Similarly in many passages noticed by Dr. Muir (O. S. T. IV, pp. 205ff.) Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s divinity is denied; and Saṁjaya and Bhīṣma make strenuous efforts to establish it.</p>
<p>What appears to be the fact is, that the religion of Vāsudeva, in which divine honours were paid to him, was professed by the Sātvatas, as observed in several of the passages noticed above, and its gradual extension to other tribes and people of the country is shadowed forth in these portions of the great epic. In the Purāṇictimes, however, the cult of Vāsudeva ceased to be militant, and three streams of religious thought, namely, the one flowing from Viṣṇu, the Vedic god at its source, another from Nārāyaṇa, the cosmic and philosophic god, and the third from Vāsudeva, the historical god, mingled together decisively and thus formed the later Vaiṣṇavism. There is however, a fourth stream, which in modern times in some. of the systems of Vaiṣṇavism has acquired an aln ost exclusive predominance, and to this we shall now direct our attention.</p>

Cowherd God (Gopāla-Kṛṣṇa).</strong></p>
<p>§ 37. There is no allusion to the cowherd Kṛṣṇain the authorities we have hitberto quoted. The Inscriptions, the work of Patañjali and even the Nārāyaṇīya itself indicate no knowledge of the existence of such a god. In the last the Avātars of Vāsudevais mentioned as having been assumed for the destruction of Kaṁsa, but of none of the demens whom the cowered Kṛṣṇakilled in the</p>
<p>cow-settlement (Gokula). The contrast between this and the statements in the Harivaṁśa (vv. 5876-5878), Vāyu-Purāṇa, chap. 98, vv. 100-102, and Bhāgavata-Purāṇa, II. 7, of Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s Avatara having been assumed for destroying all the demons that appeared in the cow-settlement as well as of Kaṁsa-is significant. When these works were written, the legend about the cowherd Kṛṣṇa must have already become current and his identification with Vāsudeva-Kṛṣṇa been effected. And the story of the Vṛṣṇi prince Vāsudeva having been brought up in a cow-settlement is incongruous with his later career as depicted in the Mahābhārata. Nor does any part of it require the presupposition of such a boyhood as has been ascribed to him.</p>
<p>In the Sabhāparvan (chap. 41), however, Śiśupāla in traducing Kṛṣṇa alludes to his valorous deeds, such as the killing of Pūtanā and others, which were done in the cow-settlement, and speaks of Bhiṣma&rsquo;s having praised them. But the praise bestowed on Kṛṣṇa by Bhiṣma (chap. 38) does not contain a mention of these deeds. This passage therefore is interpolated¹.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.The Southern Recension of the Mahābhārata contains many interpolations.. In the Nārāyaṇīya, chap. 338 of the Northern Recension corresponds to chap, 344 of the Southern. We have six verses in the latter which are not contained in the former. They speak of animals made of flour being killed. Instead of real live animals. This is a later doctrine, which is strongly advocated by the Mādhva Vaiṣṇavas, but denied with as much pertinacity by Smārtas. In the present case in the Sabhāparvan, chap. 22, vv. 27-36 about Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s doings in Gokula are in S, and not in N. Chapter 23 in S, about Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s birth and removal to Gokuls is not in N. Chapter 24, 8, vv. 4-5 about Jarāsaṁidha&rsquo;s declining to fight with Kṛṣṇa , because he was a Gopa, are not found in chap. 21, N, which corresponds to that chapter. Chapters. 33 and 34 in S. are not in N. The first is about Sahadeva&rsquo;s expedition to the Pāṇḍya country and the second about Ghaṭotkaca&rsquo;s being sent to Laṅka and Vibhīṣaṇa&rsquo;s paying tribute out of respect for Kṛṣṇa. At the end of chap. 39 in S, corresponding to chap. 36 in N, there is an interpolated passage, in which the worship done to Kṛṣṇa is derided as having been done to a Gopa or cowlerd. This is not found in N. Chapters 42-61 in 8, are not found in N. They contain a mention of the Avatāras of Viṣṇu and his exploits it Gokula. Chap. 64 in S, corresponds to chap. 41 in N. Thus attempts have always been made to bring by means of interpolations the stories told in the Mahābhārata to the form which they subsequently assume. The passage dealt with in the text is a clear interpolation.</p>
<p>The name Govinda does occur in the Bhagavadgītāand other parts of Mahābhārata. It is an ancient name, being derived by a Vārttika on P. III. 1. 138. If this name was given to Kṛṣṇa, be cause of his having had to do with cows, while a boy in Gokula, and his previous history in the cow-settlement was known, when the genuine portions of the Mahābhārata were composed, we should have found an etymology of the name expressive of that connection. But, on the contrary, in the Ādiparvan it is stated that Govinda is so called, because in the form of a boar he found the earth (Go) in the waters, which ho agitated (chap. 21. 12); and in the Śāntiparvan (chap. 342. 70) Vāsudeva says: &ldquo;I am called Govinda by the gods, because formerly I found the earth which was lost and lodged in a den&rdquo;. The origin of the name may be traced to this legend, but more probably Govinda is a later form of Govid, which in the Ṛgveda is used as an epithet of Indra in the sense of the finder of the cows. This opithet, as another. Keśiniṣūdana which is also applicable to Indra, must have been transferred to Vāsudeva-Kṛṣṇa, when he came to be looked upon as the chief god.</p>
<p>From all this it appears that the story of Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s boyhood in the Gokula was unknown till about the beginning of the Christian Era. The Harivaṁśa which is the chief authority for it, contains the word Dīnāra, corresponding to the Latin word Denarius, and oonsequently must have been written about the third century of the Christian era. Some time before that the stories of Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s boyhood must have been current. The nature of the tribe of cowherds among whom Kṛṣṇa lived, is to he gathered from the words of the boy-god-addressed to his foster-father Nanda, in order to dissuade him from celebrating a festival to Indra, and induce. him to worship the mountain Govardhana instead. &ldquo;We sre cowherds,&rdquo; he says, he says, &ldquo;wandering in forests, maintaining our selves on cows, which are cows, which are our wealth; cows are our deities, and mountains and forests&rdquo; (H. 3808). The cowherds lived in a Ghoṣa or temporary encampment, which was capable of being easily removed from place to place, as when they left Vraja and encamped in Vṛndāvana (H. 3532). Ghoṣa is defined as Ābhirapallī, which is generally understood as the enclosure of cowherds.</p>
<p>But the original signification of the word Ābhīra is not a cow</p>
<p>herd. It is the name of a race, whose original oooupation was the tending of cows; and consequently the name became in later. times equivalent to a &lsquo;cowherd&rsquo;. For these reasons the cowherda among whom the boy-god Kṛṣṇa lived, belong to a nomadic tribe of the name of Ābhīras. These Ābhīras occupied the tract of country from Madhuvana near Mathurāto Anūpa and Ānarta, the regions about Dvāraka (H. 5161-5163). The Ābhīras are mentioned in the Mahābhārata (Mausalaparvan, chap. 7) as having attacked Arjuna, who was carrying the women of the Vṛṣṇis from Dvāraka to Kurukṣetra after the extinction of the male members. of the Vṛṣṇirace. They are described as robbers and Mleochas, and lived near Pañcanada, which is probably Punjab. The Viṣṇu-Purāṇa locates them near the Aparāntas (Konkan) and Saurāṣtras, and Varāhamihira assigns them nearly the same position. Though they are mentioned as the southern people ( Bṛ. S. 14. 12), and as living in the southwest (Bṛ. S. 14. 18), the Ābhīras must have. migrated in large hordes into the country. They were at first. mere nomads and afterwards settled in the country from about the eastern confines of the Punjab to the vicinity of Mathurāand in the south up to Saurāṣṭra and Kathiavad, i. e., they must have. occupied the whole of Raiputāna and a tract to the northeast of it. After they were settled, they took to various occupations, one. of which was of course the old one, namely the tending of cows.</p>
<p>The descendants of the old Ābhīras are called Āhirs at the present day, and we have now Āhirs following the occupation of carpenters, goldsmiths, cowherds and even priesthood. At one time they founded a kingdom in the nothern part of the Maratha country, and an Inscription of the ninth year of the Ābhīra king. Iśvarasena, the son of Ābhīra Śivadatta, is found at Nasik<sup id="fnref1:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>. From the form of the characters the Inscription probably belongs. to the end of the third century. The Purāṇas mention a dynasty of Ābhīras composed of ten <a href="http://3" title="See Vāyu-Purāṇa, vol. II, chap. 37, page 453, Bibl. Ind,">princes</a>. Another Inscription of an earlier date is found at Gundā<sup id="fnref1:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>in Kathiavad, in which the charities of Rudrabhūti, a general, who is called an Ābhīra, are mentioned. The Inscription belongs to the reign of a Kṣatrapa</p>
<p>king of the name of Rudrasiṁha, who held power in Śaka 102 corresponding to 180 A. D.</p>
<p>If then about the end of the second century and in the third, the Ābhiras enjoyed high political position, they must have migrated into the country in the first century. They probably brought with them the worship of the boy-god and the story of his humble birth, his reputed father&rsquo;s knowledge that he was not his son, and the massacre of the innocents.The two last correspond to Nanda&rsquo;s knowing that he was not the father of Kṛṣṇa and Kaṁsa&rsquo;s killing all children. The stories of Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s hoyhood, such as that of killing Dhenuka, a demon in the form of a wild ass, were brought by Ābhiras<sup id="fnref1:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>, and others were developed after they came to India. It is possible that they brought with them the name Christ also, and this name probably led to the identification of the boy-god with Vāsudeva-Kṛṣṇa, The Goanese and the Bengalis often pronounce the name Kṛṣṇa as Kuṣṭo or Kriṣṭo, and so the Christ of the Ābhiras was recognised as the Sanskrit Kṛṣṇa.</p>
<p>The dalliance of Kṛṣṇa with cowherdesses, which introduced an element inconsistent with the advance of morality into the Vāsudeva religion, was also an after-growth, consequent upon the freer intercourse between the wandering Ābhīras and their more civilised Āryan neighbours. Morality cannot be expected. to be high or strict among races in the condition of the Ābhīras at the time and their gay neighbours took advantage of its looseness. Besides, the Ābhīrawomen must have been fair and handsome as those of the Āhir-Gavaliyas or cowherds of the present day are.</p>
<p>§ 38. The story in the Buddhistic Ghatajātaka represents Vāsudeva and his brothers to be the sons of Kaṁsa&rsquo;s sister Devagabbhāand Upasāgara. They were made over to a man of the name of Andhakaveṇhu and to his wife Nandagopā who was the attendant of Devagabbhā. In this version there is a remi niscence of Devakī in the name Devagabbhā; and Nanda and Yaśodā or Gopāof Gokula are compounded together to form the name of the maid-servant who brought up Devagabbhā&rsquo;s sons as</p>
<p>her sons. And in Andhakaveṇhu the names of the two kindred Yādava tribes, Andhaka and Vṛṣṇi, are compounded together, and the compound becomes the name of the husband of the maid-servant. Now as Andhaka and Vṛṣṇi were according to the highest authorities two distinot names, and were the names of the two tribes, this story contains a confused reminiscence of the true legend and was of a later growth. All the Jātakas were not written at one and the same time. While sone belong to a pre-Christian period, others must be assigned to post-Christian times, and the Ghatajātaka appears to me to belong to the latter class. The compound Nandagopā, therefore, though it contains a clear reminiscence of the foster-parents of the boy-god Kṛṣṇa, cannot be considered to point to a pre-Christian period for the identification of Vāsudeva-Kṛṣṇa with Gopāla-Kṛṣṇa.</p>
<p>X. The Pāñcarātra or Bhāgavata System.</p>
<p>§ 39. We have thus gone over the last element which goes to form the Vaiṣṇavism of the later times. That element, however, does not formi a prominent part, or forms no part at all, of the systems which are based upon the old Pāñcarātra doctrines As we have seen, the Ekāntika Dharma or monotheistic religion was that which was promulgated by the Bhagavadgītā; but the Pāñcarātrasystem, consisting, as it did, of the worship of Vāsudeva and his several forms, shows no organic connection with that work, though Bhakti or devotion is common to both. That system must have developed in about the third century B. C., as. we have already seen from the Inscriptions and passages in books referred to before. Their being free from the Gopāla-Kṛṣṇa element is thus intelligible, and the later Vaiṣṇava systems, such as that of Rāmānuja and Madhva, which more or less recognise the old Bhāgavata doctrines or ideas, have entirely neglected that element. In other systems, however, it is recognised and in a general way in popular Vaiṣṇavism.</p>
<p>The authorities on which the Bhāgavata system was based are the Pāñcarātra-Saṁhitās; and Rāmānuja in his comments on the Brahmasūtras, II. 2. 39-42, quotes from some of these. The first quotation is from the Pauṣkara-Saṁhitā, which is intended to show that, when Brāhmaṇas worship the fourfold soul with the</p>
<p>traditional names, it should be considered authoritative. The second is from the Sātvata-Saṁhitā, which is to the effect that this great Śāstra contains the secret of Brahman and imparts discrimination to Brāhmaṇas who worship the true Brahmani bearing the name of Vāsudeva. There are two from the Parama-Saṁhitā. One of these gives the nature of Prakṛti, which is unsentient, of use to another than &ldquo;itself&rdquo;, eternal, always changeable, composed of three qualities, and is the sphere within which the action of agents is done. The other represents somebody, probably Śāṇḍilya himself, as saying that he has studied all the Vedas with the dependent treatises and Vākovākya, but not. having found the way to supreme bliss clearly stated in them.</p>
<p>One of these Saṁhitās, bearing the name of Sātvata, has been printed and is available. It begins by saying that Narada saw Paraśurāma on the Malaya Mountain and was told by him to visit the Ṛsis, who were in search of the place of Hari, and to instruct them in the Sātvatamethod of worship (Kriyāmārga). Nārada does this and explains to them the secret traditional methods (Rahasyāmnāya). Nārāyana is spoken of here as the supreme spirit. The secret methods were formerly explained by the bearer of the discus (Vāsudeva ), when asked by Saṁkarṣaṇa. Saṁkarṣaṇa spoke to Viṣṇu at the beginning of the Tretāage, asking why his countenance had become red. The answer is: &ldquo;Because the people will be afflicted with passion in this age&rdquo;. Being asked how they will be delivered from passion, Saṁkarṣaṇa is told that they will be delivered by adoring the eternal and highest Brahman in three ways. The Supreme Spirit, who has hands and feet and eyes everywhere and is endowed with six Guṇas or qualities, is Para or the Highest. It is one and the support of all. Besides this there is a triad, each member of which is distinguished from the others by a distinction in knowledge and other qualities. These three should be known as Vyūhas, or forms, who confer the desired fruit with ease.</p>
<p>Balarāma then asks about the mode of service. Bhagvat then explains it as follows&rdquo; When the pure Brāhman, which is the aim and end of the creation, exists in the heart of qualified Brāhmaṇas, who worship Vāsudeva, the highest Śāstra, which is a</p>
<p>great Upaniṣad of Brahman, springs forth from it for the redemption of the world and confers discrimination; it contains divine. methods and has for its fruit final deliverance¹. I will then explain that to you which is of verious kinds. This Śāstra, along with Rahasya, is fruitful to those who have gone through Yoga with its eight parts, and whose soul is devoted to mental sacrifice. The Yogins, who are Brāhmaṇas guided by the Vedas and who have given up the mixed worship, are competent for the worship. of the single one, dwelling in the heart. The three orders, Kṣatriya and others, and those who are Prapanna or have resorted to self-surrender are competent for the worship of the four Vyūhas accompanied by Mantras, and also unaccompanied by them, so far as regards the series of ceremonies concerning the four Vyūhas as well as the actions and the collection of Mantras concerning the Vibhavas². All these persons should be free from attachment and absorbed in the performance of their duties and be devotees of the supreme lord by their deeds, words and mind. In this manner, the four (orders) become competent, when they are initiated (for service) with Mantras. Hear now the process concerning the single form &ldquo;. Then follows the statement of the mystic arrangement of letters and formulae and the meditations. This work throughout contains the mystic modes of worship by means of Mantras variously arranged.</p>
<p>The allusion at the end of Chapter 66 of the Bhīṣmaparvan to Saṁkarsaṇa&rsquo;s having sung or expounded Vāsudeva according to the Sātvata rites (Vidhi) refers in all probability to such rites as are detailed in this Sātvata-Saṁhitā.</p>
<p>Śaṁkarācārya, in his notice of the BhāgavataSchool under Bṛ. S. II. 2. 42, gives five methods of worshipping the supreme lord, Bhāgavat Vāsudeva, in his fourfold form, which, along with the explanations given by the commentators, are as follows:- (1) Abhigamana or going to the temple of the deity with the speech, the body and the mind centred on him; (2) Upādāns or collecting the materials of worship; (3) Ijyāor worship; (4) Svādhyaya or the muttering of the usual Mantra; (5) Yoga ormeditation. By worshipping him in these ways for a hundred. years, all sin is destroyed and the devotee reaches Bhagavat.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.Two lines out of this are contained in the quotations from Rāmānuja given. above.</p>
<p>2.Vibbavas are the incarnations of the Supreme Spirit.</p>
<p>§40. The book called Nāradapañcarātra, published by the Asiatic Society of Bengal, contains the Saṁhitācalled Jñānāmṛitasāra. The glories of the boy Kṛṣṇa are sung in this work. Nārada desiring to know Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s greatness and the methods of his worship is recommended to go to Śaṁkara, or Śiva, and seek instruction from him. Nārada repairs to Kailāsa and enters the palace of Śaṁkara, which has seven gates. At these gates there are pictures and sculptures relating to the scenes of Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s childhood and his various deeds in the cow-settlement, such as Vṛṇḍavana, Yamunā, Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s sitting on the Kadamba tree with the garments of the cowherdesses and their return from bath in the Yamunā river in a naked condition, the destruction of the serpent Kāliya, the holding up of the Govardhana mountain on the palm of his hand, the journey to Mathurā and the lamentations of the. Gopīs and his foster-parents, etc. Sculptures representing some of these events were discovered on a pillar excavated at Mandor near Jodhpur about two years ago<sup id="fnref1:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>. The age of the pillar has been considered not earlier than the fourth century A. D. The idea of imagining such sculptures on the gates of Śiva&rsquo;s palace could have. occurred to a writer only when the practice of adorning gates and pillars with such sculptures had become general. The Jñānāmṛtasāra, therefore, could not have been earlier than fourthcentury and appears to me to be considerably later, as will be presently shown.</p>
<p>Goloka or the world of cows is the heaven in which Kṛṣṇa dwells and which is reached by those who adore him, and several Mantras are given in this book, the reciters of which are rewarded. with a place in that heaven. The servitude of Hari through devotion is the highest Mukti or absolution according to this work. There are six modes of adoring Hari; viz., (1) remembrance of him, (2) utterance, ( of his name and glory ). ( 3 ) salutation, (4) resorting to his feet, (5) constant worship of him with devotion, and (6) surrender of the whole soul to him. The Bhāgavata-Purāṇa adds three more, viz., hearing (his praise ), servitude, and companionship (Ṡakhyam). These last two are preliminary to</p>
<p>the surrendering of the whole soul. In this book Rādhā is mentioned as the highest of the women whom Kṛṣṇa loved, and she is represented to have been formed by the original lord becoming two, one of which was Rādhā (IL 3. 24ff.). The exaltation of this woman is thus one of the main objects of this Saṁhitā.</p>
<p>The Saṁhitā we have been considering, seems thus to be entirely devoted to the advancement of the cult of the Kṛṣṇa of the cow-settlement or Gokula and of his beloved mistress Rādhā, now raised to the dignity of his eternal consort. The Vyūhas which form a peculiarity of the Pāñcarātra School, are not mentioned. in it. The creed afterwards promulgated by Vallabhāoārya is exactly similar to that set forth in this book. This Saṁhitā, therefore, must have heen written a short time before Vallabha, that is about the beginning of the sixteenth century. The Rāmānujiyas consider this Saṁhitā to be apocryphal.</p>
<p>XI. The Avatāras of Viṣṇu or Nārāyaṇa.</p>
<p>§ 41. An Avatāra or incarnation of a god differs from mereidentification of two gods in this, that in the former case the god that is considered an incarnation acts like a human being, or even a brute, at the same time that he has the miraculous powers of a god. The transition, however, from the idea of identification to that of incarnation is easy. The person in the flesh is identified with the god who is a mere spirit, so that the habit of thought which in Vedic times led to the identification of some of the Vedic deities with Agni, has been at work even in this conception of the Avatāras.</p>
<p>The Avatāras of Nārāyaṇaor Viṣṇu are variously given by the various authorities. In the passage in the Nārāyaṇīyatranslated above<sup id="fnref1:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>,&rsquo; six only are given, viz, the boar, the manlion, the dwarf, Rāma of the Bhṛgu race,Rāma Dāśarathi and that assumed for the destruction of Kaṁsa (Vāsudeva-KṛṣṇaThis passage is followed after a short interval by another in which the incarnations are given as ten, the additions being Haṁsa (swan), Kūrma (turtoise), and Matsya (fish) in the beignning and Kalkin at the end. The one preceding Kalkin is called Sātvata, i. e.. Vāsudeva-Kṛṣṇa. This passage, following so closely on the</p>
<p>first, appears to be interpolated when the number of Avatāras became fixed at ten.</p>
<p>The Harivaṁśa mentions the six given in the first of these two passages. The Vāyu-Purāṇa gives the incarnations in two passages (Chap. 97, vv. 72. and Chap. 98, vv. 63ff.), in the first of which there are twelve, but some of them appear rather to be incarnations of Śiva and Indra. In the second the number ten, which about that time must have come into usage, is made up by adding to the six mentioned above the four: Dattātreya, one unnamed called the fifth, Vedavyāsa, and Kalkin. In the Varāha-Purāņa we have the ten incarnations which came to be accepted later, oon- taining the Fish, Tortoise, Buddha, and Kalkin, in addition to the six mentioned above. The Agni-Purāṇa gives the same ten.</p>
<p>The Bhāgavata-Purāṇa enumerates the incarnations in three. different passages. In the first, contained in Chapter 3 of Book I, twenty-two are mentioned. In the passage in Chapter 7 of Book II, we have twenty-three, and in Chapter 4 of Book XI, sixteen are given. It deserves notice that among the Avatāras mentioned in this Purāṇa are Sanatkumāra; the divine sage (Nārada), who expounded the Sātvata system; Kapila who explain d to Āsuri the Sāṁkhyasystem, which determines the collection. of principles; Dattātreya, who is represented to have taught Ānvīkṣikī to Alarka and the Prahrāda and the attainment of excellence hy means of Yoga to Yadu and Haihaya; Ṛṣabha, son of Nābhi and Merudevī, who abandoned attachment to all things, acquired serenity, and looking at all things alike and possessing Yoga power, acted as if he were a non-living creature; and lastly Dhanvantari, the teacher of the science of medicine.</p>
<p>Ṛṣabha, from the parentage given here and other indications, appears clearly to be the same as the first Tīrthaṁkara of the Jainas. He was probably raised to the dignity of an incarnation as the Buddha of the Buddhists was. There is hardly a wide-spread cult of any of these incarnations except Dattātreya, who is adored and worshipped by a large number of people to this day, and Rāma of whom more will have to be said hereafter. Kṛṣṇa, of course, though. included in the Avatāras stands on independent grounds and his worship over the widest area is due, not to his having been con</p>
<p>sidered an Avatāra, but to his being the peculiar object of adora. tion of the followers of a new religion or religious reform, as I have ventured to call it, which first took its rise among the Sātvatas.</p>
<p><strong>XII. Later Traces of the Bhāgavata School;<br>
and General Vaiṣṇavism.</strong></p>
<p>§ 42. We will now resume the chronological thread we have traced from Megasthenes to the latest Inscription, that at Nanaghat, which is to be referred to the first century B. C. For about four centuries after this there are no epigraphical or sculptural traces of any Brāhmanic religious system; and they reappear about the time when the Guptas rose to power in the first quarter of the fourth century. The Gupta princes, Candragupta II, Kumāragupta, and Skandagupta, are styled Paramabhāgavatas on their coins. They were thus worshippers of Bhagavat or Vāsudeva. Their dates range from 400 to 464 A. D.</p>
<p>On a panel at Udayagiri, there is a figure of a four-armed god, who is probably Viṣṇu. The Inscription below bears the date. 82 G. E., i. e.. 400 A. D.<sup id="fnref1:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup></p>
<p>There is a pillar at Bhitari in the Ghazipur District of the U. P., on which there is an Inscription which records the installation of an image of Śārṅgin and the grant of a village for its worship by Skandagupts, whose dates range between 454 and 464 A. D<sup id="fnref1:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>. Śārṅgin must have been Vāsudeva-Kṛṣṇa,Skanda- gupta himself being a Bhāgavata.</p>
<p>A temple of Viṣṇu was erected in 456 A. D. by Cakrapālita, son of Parṇadatta, appointed viceroy of Surāṣṭra or Kathiavad by Skandagupta. The Inscription, which records this, opens with an invocation of Viṣṇu in the Vāmana or the dwarf incarnation<sup id="fnref1:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In an Inscription at Eran in the Sagar district, C. P., belonging to the reign of Budhagupta and bearing the date 165 G. E., corresponding to 483 A. D., Mātrviṣṇu and his younger brother Dhanyaviṣṇuare represented to have erected &amp; Dhvajastambha or flag-</p>
<p>staff in honour of the god Janārdana. Mātṛviṣṇu is called a great devotee of Bhāgavat (Atyanta-Bhagavad-bhakta<sup id="fnref1:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>). The god Janārdana must therefore be Vāsudeva-Krṣṇa.</p>
<p>A copper-plate Inscription of A. D. 495, found near the village. of Khoh in Baghelkhand, records the grant of a village, by a chief named Jayanātha, to Bhagavat for repairs to the temple of that god and for the performance of ordinary ceremonies<sup id="fnref1:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>.</p>
<p>An Inscription on an iron pillar near Kutub Minar at Delhi speaks of that pillar as a flag-staff to Viṣṇu erected by a great king named Candra, who enjoyed universal sovereignty and was a great devotee of Viṣṇu. The Inscription is not dated, but if the Candra referred to here was Candragupta II, it belongs to the latter part of the fourth century or the beginning of the fifth<sup id="fnref1:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In his Meghadūta (v. 15) Kalidāsa compares the cloud adorned with a piece of a rain-bow, with Viṣṇu in the shape of the cow-herd. adorned with a shining peacock feather. Here there is an identification of Gopāla-Krṣṇa with Viṣṇu; and, if the Vikramāditya who was the patron of Kalidāsa was Candragupta II of the Gupta Dynasty, this must be considered to be a record belonging to the early part of the fifth century.</p>
<p>We have already alluded to the sculptures on a pillar excavated at Mandor near Jodhpur. These sculptures represent the overturning of a cart by the baby Krṣṇa, the holding of the Govardhana Mountain by Krṣṇa on the palm of his hand, and such other events. I refer them tentatively to the fifth century.</p>
<p>In Śaka 500, Maṅgalīśa, a prince belonging to the early Cālukya dynasty of the Deccan, got a cave scooped out, in which a temple to Viṣṇu was constructed, and an image of Viṣṇu was installed in it. The provision for the performance of Nārāyaṇabali (offerings to Nārāyaṇa) was made by assigning the revenues of a village for the purpose<sup id="fnref1:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>. In this cave-temple there are figures. of Viṣṇu and Nārāyaṇa lying on the body of a serpent, with Lakşmīrubbing his feet, and of the Boar and Narasiṁha incarna</p>
<p>tions, and of Harihara in which the peculiar marks of Hari, or Viṣṇu, and of Hara, or Śiva, are combined<sup id="fnref1:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In mentioning the priests who are qualified to install and conseorate the images of certain gods, Varāhamihira says that this function in the case of Viṣṇu should be assigned to Bhāgavatas<sup id="fnref1:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>. Bhāgavatas were thus recognised in his time as the peculiar worshippers of Viṣṇu. Varāhamihira died in Śaka, i. e. 587 A.D.<sup id="fnref1:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup></p>
<p>Amarasiṁha, the author of the well-known Kośa or thesaurus, was a Buddhist. After giving the words expressive of gods. generally, when he comes to the names of particular gods, he begins by giving those of Buddha and proceeds next to give the names Viṣṇu, Nārāyaṇa etc., of which we have thirty-nine. After finishing these he says that Vāsudeva was his father. This means that the thirty-nine names proviously given are the names of Vāsudeva. If we examine these, we shall find that hefore Amare&rsquo;s time Vāsudeva had already been identified with Viṣṇu and NārāyaṇaExcept the name Dāmodara, there is no other con- necting Vāsudeva with Gokula, and the etymology of Dāmodara which connects him with that cow-settlement is doubtful. While Kaṁsārāti, or the enemy of Kaṁsa, does occur, we have no such name as Pūtanāri, the enemy of Pūtanā, or any other derived. from the names of the many demons he slew while he was a boy. There are also no names of incarnations except the doubtful one, Balidhvaṁsin, which however, has been interpreted by one. commentator as the destroyer of ignorance by means of Bali or oblations. There are, of course, several names derived from those. of other demons, such as Madhuripu and Kaitabhajit, but these are not the enemies destroyed by Viṣṇu in his incarnations as they are usually mentioned. After giving the name of the father of Vāsudeva-Kṛṣṇa, Amara proceeds to mention those of Saṁkarsana, or Baladeva, and afterwards of Pradyumna and Aniruddha. Thereafter he mentions those of Lakṣmi, the wife of Nārāyaṇa or Viṣṇu, then those of the weapons of the god and his ornaments, and ends with the names of Garuḍa, the vehicle of Viṣṇu After</p>
<p>finishing these he proceeds to the other great god of the Hindus, Śambhu or Śiva.</p>
<p>Here Amara appears clearly to have in view the four forms, or Vyūhas, of Vāsudeva recognised by the Bhāgavatas, so that in his time the prevalent form of Vaiṣṇavism was that embraced by the Bhāgavatas. Amara&rsquo;s exact age is doubtful, but, if he was a Buddhist, he must have belonged to the Mahāyāna sect, the sacred language of which was Sanskrit. This system was in full swing in the fourth, fifth and sixth centuries¹. Amarasiṁha, therefore, must have flourished in this last century, or, if we believe in the traditional verse which asserts his contemporaneousness with Kalidāsa and in Candragupta II as Vikramāditya, the famous patron of learning, he must have flourished in the early part of the fifth century. The identity of Vāsudeva-Kṛṣṇa with GopalaKṛṣṇa is very rarely alluded to, while that with Viṣṇu and Nārāyaṇaa is clearly set forth.</p>
<p>About the middle of the seventh century, Bāṇain his Harṣacarita represents a sage of the name of Divākaramitra, who, originally a Brāhmaṇa, became a Buddhist, as being surrounded in the Vindhya mountains, where he had his abode, by followers of a number of sects two of which were the Bhāgavatas and Pāñcarātras.</p>
<p>In the Daśāvatāra temple at Ellora there is a figure of Viṣṇu on the body of a serpent with Lakṣmi rubbing his feet and Brahmāseated on a lotus coming out of his navel. There are also images of the Narasiṁha, Vāmana and Varāha incarnations, as well as of Kṛṣṇa holding the Govardhana Mountain over the flocks of the cow-settlement. This temple was constructed about the middle of the eighth century in the time of Dantidurga of the Rāṣṭrakūṭa race. There are similar figures of Avatāras in the Kailāsa temple. scooped out in the latter part of the eighth century, in the time of Kṛṣṇa I, uncle of Dantidurga. Among these is also the scene of the destruction of Kāliya by Kṛṣṇa.</p>
<p>There is an Inscription in a cave at Pabhosa, about 32 miles south-west of Allahabad, which probably had a human figure. above and runs thus: &ldquo;The maker of the images of Sri-Kṛṣṇa andthe milk-maids&rdquo;. The date is uncertain, but the Inscription is referred to the seventh or eighth century by Bühler<sup id="fnref1:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>.</p>

<p>1.Vide my &lsquo;Peep into the Early History of India&rsquo;, JBBRAS, Vol. XX. p. 305;</p>
<p>[=Volume I of this Edition, p. 48 N. B. U.]</p>
<p>At Sirpur in the Raipur district, C. P.. over the front of a shrine-door there is a sculpture of Viṣṇu or Nārāyaṇa reclining on the folds of the serpent Śeṣa, and from his navel springs a lotus on which is seated Brahmā. Down the two outer sides of the shrinedoor are some of the incarnations of Viṣṇu , one of which is that of Rāma and another of Buddha, whose image is in the usual meditative attitude. The temple belongs probably to the eighth century².</p>
<p>At Osia, 32 miles north of Jodhpur, there is an old temple adjoining to the house of the local Jahagirdar. On two pilasters. projecting from the shrine into the Sabhāmaṇḍapa, are two images of deities both seated on Garuḍa. Both have four hands, but one. of them holds a conch-shell, the discus, the mace and the lotus, and the other bears a plough-share and a mace in his two hands, the other two being empty. The last has his head canopied by a five-hooded serpent. They are apparently Vāsudeva and Saṁkarṣaṇa. The temple cannot be later than the ninth century³.</p>
<p>In a work called Dharmaparīkṣā, Amitagati, the author, who was a Digambara Jaina, says that there were according to the legendary lore current among the Jainas sixty-three eminent men: the twelve supreme sovereigns, the twenty-four Arhats (Jinas), and nine Rāmas, nine Keśavas, and the nine enemies of these mine. The last of the Viṣṇus ( Keśavas) was the son of Vāsudeva, and his Brāhmaṇa devotees call him the pure, the supreme being. They say: &ldquo;He who meditates upon the god Viṣṇu, who is allpervading, a whole without parts, indestructible and unchangeable, who frees a man from old age and death, is free from misery&rdquo;.He is traditionally known to have ton forms or incarnations. These ten forms are the same as mentioned in the Varāha and AgniPurāṇas<sup id="fnref1:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup> and which are now generally accepted. Thus Buddha had come to be recognised as an incarnation of Viṣṇu before</p>

<p>the date of the Dharmaparīkṣa, which is Vikrāma 1070, corresponding to 1014 A. D. If the approximate date assigned to the temple at Sirpur is correct, Buddha must have been admitted into the Brāhmaṇicpantheon before the eighth century. Amitagati also speaks of the mighty Viṣṇu having become a cowherd in Nanda&rsquo;s Gokula and of the all-knowing, all-pervading protector of the world (Rāma) as being oppressed by the fire. of separation from Sitä like a mortal lover¹.</p>
<p>Hence, we have evidence of the existence of the cult of Viṣṇu, principally in accordance with the mode professed by the Bhāgavatas from the fourth to the eleventh century. The doctrine of the incarnations had also become an article of ordinary faith, and the founder of Buddhism and the first Tirthaṁkara of the Jainas also came later to be recognised as incarnations of Viṣṇu.</p>
<p>XIII. The Cult of Rāma.</p>
<p>§ The architectural remains passed under review contain only figures of the incarnations of Viṣṇu and are not to be taken. as proving the existence of the cult of any of these incarnations. But at the present day the cult of Rāmaexists over a pretty wide area. In the temples and other religious structures hitherto noticed, there is none dedicated to his worship nor any flag-staff like those erected in honour of Janārdana or Vāsudeva-Kṛṣṇa. Rāma, however, was considered as an incarnation of Viṣṇu even in very early times. There are passages in the Rāmayaṇa pointing to this, but there is good reason to believe that they are spurious or interpolated. But the passage in the Nārāyaṇīya, which we have. frequently referred to, contains his name, and so do all the Purāṇas that have been noticed. These in themselves are not sufficient to enable us to determine approximately the period in which he came to be regarded as an incarnation. But in the tenth chapter of the Raghuvaṁśa the story of the birth of Rāma is preceded by the usual appeal to Viṣṇu or Nārāyaṇa lying on the body of the great serpent, with Lakṣmi rubbing his feet, in the milky ocean and his promise to be born as a son of Daśaratha for the destruction of Rāvaṇa.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.For Amitagati&rsquo;s work, see Vol. II of this edition, pp. 308ff.[N.B.U.]</p>
<p>[R. G. Bhandarker&rsquo;s Works, Vol. IV.]</p>
<p>Amitagati also speaks in 1014 A. D., as we have seen<sup id="fnref1:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>, of Rāma&rsquo;s being regarded as the all-knowing, all-pervading protector of the world. The Vāyu-Purāṇa, which is the earliest work of that class, must have been written about the fifth century; so that the belief in Rāma&rsquo;s being an incarnation of Viṣṇu existed. in all probability in the early centuries of the Christian Era. But there is no mention of his name in such a work as that of Patañjali, nor is there any old Inscription in which it occurs. Amarasiṁha, too, has no place for him in his scheme of Brāhmaṇic gods. These circumstances, as well as those mentioned above, show that, though he was regarded as an Avatāra, there was no cult in his honour. Still, as depicted by Vālmīki, Rāma was a high-souled hero, and poets, including those nameless ones. who wrote Purāṇas in the names of old Ṛṣi, particularly Bhavabhūti, still more highly exalted his character. Rāma, therefore, won a place in the heart of the Indian people, and that must have. soon led to the foundation of the cult. But when this took place it is difficult to say. Madhva or Ānandatīrtha, the founder of a sect to be noticed hereafter, is represented to have brought the image of Digvijaya Rāma from Badarikāśrama and sent Naraharitīrtha to Jagannātha about the year 1264 A. D<sup id="fnref1:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>., to bring what was called the original idols of Rāma and Sits. The cult of Rāma, therefore, must have come into existence about the eleventh century. There exist manuals giving the modes of worship by means of Mantras or formulae and magic circles, like those proscribed in the Sātvata-Saṁhitāfor the worship of Vāsudeva. The ceremony in connection with his birth on the 9th of the bright half of Caitra is given in his Vratakhaṇḍa<sup id="fnref1:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>.&quot;)by Hemādri, who flourished in the thirteenth century. That writer, as well as Vṛddhā-Hārita⁴, gives the modes of worshipping him as an incarnation along with others on certain occasions, so that it appears that his worship as an incarnation has been of a longer duration than that based on terms of equality with Vāsudeva-Kṛṣṇa.</p>
<p>Twenty-four images, differing from each other in the order in which the four objects, viz., the conch-shell, disous, mace</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>and lotus, are placed in the four hands of the principal god Vāsudeva or Viṣṇu, are mentioned by both those authors, and the twenty-four names¹ corresponding to the twenty-four images. Keśava, Nārāyaṇa, Govinda, etc., which include those of the four Vyūhas, are repeated by us at the beginning of every ceremony that we perform at the present day; that is, obeisance is made to the twenty-four forms of the god by using the word Namaḥ (salutations) after the dative of each of the names, and the sense is &lsquo;Saluations to Keśava, Nārāyaṇa, etc,&rsquo;. The name of Rāma, however, is not included in them, while two other Avatāras, Narasiṁha and Vāmana, are mentioned. Every Śrāddha ceremony is wound up by the expression May Janārdana-Vāsudeva, who is a form of the ancestors, or the father, grandfather and great grandfather, be satisfied by this act&rdquo;. All this shows that Vāsudevism has penetrated into every one of our ordinary ceremonies, which include a repetition even of Vedic Mantras, while this is not at all the case. with the cult of Rāma, which is, therefore of a modern growth.</p>
<p>There is a work, entitled the Adhyātma-Rāmāyaṇa, which Ekanātha<sup id="fnref1:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>, a Mahārāṣṭra saint, who flourished in the sixteenth century, calls a modern treatise, composed of excerpts from older writings and having no pretence to be considered as emanating from the old Ṛṣis. The object of this work throughout has. been to set forth the divinity of Rāma. The first book of it com- prises what is called Rāmahṛdaya, which which was narrated to Hanūmat by Sītā, who says that as the original Prakṛti, she does every thing and did all the deeds mentioned in the Rāmayaṇa, while Rāma as the only existing soul is inactive, unchangeable and blessed, and is a mere witness of her deeds. After she has concluded, Rāma explains the threefold nature of the knowing spirit, viz., (1) the original, (2) that conditioned by Buddhi or</p>

<p>finiteintelligence, and (3) the appearances, the last two of which are fictitious. The fifth canto of the last book is styled Rāmagītā, which is meant to correspond to the Bhagavadgītāof Vāsudeva and which is narrated by Rāma to Lakṣmaṇa, who takes the place of Arjuna. The doctrine is thoroughly adualistic as that of the previous portion. The world and the individual soul are illusory, and one spirit alone exists. There is another book called Rāmagitā published in Madras, which represents itself to be contained in a larger work called Sattvapārāyaṇa and is composed of eighteen chapters like the genuine Bhagavadgītā. It is narrated. to Hanūmat by Rāma. In the beginning it professes itself to be based on the one hundred and eight Upanṣiads, some of which are manifestly very rocent. This work, therefore, must be a very modern compilation. Thus the works designed to give importance to Rāma as a religious teacher are of recent origin.</p>
<p>XIV. Vāsudevism or Vaiṣṇavism in the South,</p>
<p>§ 44. We have seen that Saṁkarṣaṇa and Vāsudeva had come to be worshipped as gods in the Maratha country by about the first century B. C. The cult must have spread further south up to the Tamil country, but there is no evidence to show at what time it was introduced there. The Bhāgavata-Purāṇa (Book XI, chap. 5, vv. 38-40) says, in the usual prophetic. style, that in the Kali age there will be found men here. and there devoted to Nārāyaṇa, but in large numbers. in the Draviḍa country, where flow the rivors Tamraparṇī, Kāverīand others, and that those who drink the water of these rivers will mostly be pure-hearted devotees of Vāsudeva. When the Purāṇa goes out of its beaten track to make such a statement as this, the fame of the devotees of Vāsudeva, who had flourished in the Tamil country, must have spread over either parts of India. when the Purāṇa was compiled. The Purāṇa was regarded as sacred in the thirteenth century, when Ānandatīrtha, who flourished between about 1199 and 1278 A.D., places it on the same level as the Mahābhārata and devotes a treatise to the determination of its drift, as to that of the latter. About the same time Bopadeva prepared an abstract of it at the request of the councillor Hemādri. The Bhāgavata, therefore, must have been composed at the least</p>
<p>two centuries before Ānandatīrtha to account for the reputation of the sacred character which it acquired in his time. It cannot be very much older, for its style often looks modern and in copying from the older Purāṇas it falls into mistakes, such as the one pointed out by me in another place¹. The Draviḍa devotees, therefore, noticed in the Bhāgavata, must have mostly flourished before the eleventh century.</p>
<p>These devotees, who are known by the name of Ālvārs, are generally reckoned as twelve in number and are divided into three classes by S. Krishnaswami Aiyengar<sup id="fnref1:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup> in accordance with the received chronology which he follows to determine. their sequence, though in itself it assigns a preposterously high antiquity to them.

<p>The date of the first, ordinarily given, is B. C. 4203 and of the last, B. C. 2706, and the others range between these two. Not only are these dates fanciful, but even the sequence shown above is unreliable. Krishnaswami places the last in the earlier half of the eighth century A. D., and all the preceding ones impliedly before that date. But there is distinct evidence to show that Kulaśekhara flourished much later. He was a king of Travancore, and one ofthe works composed by him styled Mukundamāla contains a verse from the Bhāgavata-Purāṇa (XI. 2. 36)<sup id="fnref1:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.Early History of the Deccan (Second Edition), pp. 32-33. [=Vol. III, p. 46 of this Edition-N. B. U.]</p>
<p>Again in an Inscription on a tablet, existing in a temple at Narēgal in the Dharwar district, translated by Dr. Fleet<sup id="fnref1:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>, it is stated that Permāḍi of the Sinda dynasty vanquished Kulaśekharāṅka, besieged Chaṭṭa, pursued Jayakśin, and seized upon the royal power of Poysala and invested Dhorasamudra, the capital of the Poysala dynasty. In another Inscription<sup id="fnref1:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>this Permāḍi is represented to be a vassal of Jagadekamalla II, whose dates range between A. D. 1138 and 1150. While the former was in power as Mahāmaṇḍaleśvara in the seventh year of Jagadekamalla, i. e., in A. D. 1144, a certain grant was made by a body of sellers of betel. leaves and nuts. The Kulaśekharāṅka, mentioned as being. vanquished by this Permāḍi, must be a prince reigning on the western coast, as the others, Jayakeśin, the Kadamba prince of Goa, the Hoysala king, and so forth, were. Putting this statement and the quotation from the Bhāgavata-Purāṇa together, it appears. highly probable that the Ālvār Kulaśekhara lived in the first half of the twelfth century. The sequence, therefore, given above cannot be implicitly believed in.</p>
<p>Still it may be admitted that the earliest Ālvārs flourished about the time of the revival of Brāhamaṇism and Hinduism in the North, which extended up to the Maratha country, as wel have shown from Inscriptions and antiquarian remains, and must have extended still farther to the South. The earliest Ālvārs may be placed before about the fifth or sixth century, but there is nothing to show that Vaiṣṇavism had not penetrated to the Tamil country earlier, i. e., about the first century. But an impetus, such as the rise of the Ālvārs indicates, could in all probability come. only from the energy of the revival. The hostile relations into which the Ālvārs and the Śaiva saints, Nāyanmārs, came with the Buddhists and Jainas, lend support to the view we have. advocated.</p>
<p>TheĀlvārs composed mostly in Tamil, what are called Prabandhas or songs in praise of the deity full of piety and devotion and</p>
<p>containing also religious truth. They are considered as very sacred and spoken of as the Vaiṣṇava Veda. The reverence paid to the Ālvārs is very great, and their images are placed by the side of the god representing Viṣṇuor Nārāyaṇa in some form and worshipped.It may be noted here that Kulaśekhara-Ālvār&rsquo;s favourite deity was Rāma, the son of Daśaratha.</p>
<p>XV. Rāmānuja.</p>
<p>§ 45. There were two classes of teachers among the Vaiṣṇavaof the South, viz, the Ālvārs and the Ācāryas. The former devoted themselves to the culture of the feeling of love and devotion for Viṣṇu or Nārāyaṇa, and composed songs, while the object of the latter was to carry on disputations and controversies and seek to establish their own theories and creeds. The first class we have already noticed briefly. The first of the second class appears to have been Nāthamuni. His successor was Yāmunācārya or Yāmunamuni. Rāmānuja succeeded Yāmunamuni, one of whose last directions to his successor was to compose a commentary on Bādārayana&rsquo;s Brahmasūtra. The necessity for such a work was felt by the leaders of the Vaiṣṇava falth, since they found it not. possible to maintain the doctrine of Bhakti or love in the face of the theory of Advaita or Monism of Spirit set up by Śaṁkarācārya as based upon the Brahmasūtras and the Upaniṣads.</p>
<p>During the period of the revival of Brāhmanism and Hinduism. there was such a fermentation of thought as that which existed when Buddhism, Jainism and other heterodox systems on the one. hand, and Vāsudevism on the other, arose. The present fermentation, however, did not rest on independent thought, but was based upon the sacred works that had been handed down from the earlier times. The Pali Buddhism made way for the Sanskrit Mahāyānism, and against this last, controversies were carried on by the School of Nyāya founded by Gautama and by the Mimāṁsakas, especially by Śabarsvāmin and Kumārilabhaṭṭa. But the Mimāṁsakas attacked not only the Buddhists, but the Aupaniṣadas, or a school of thought based upon the Upaniṣads.They maintained the efficacy of the sacrificial religion alone and denied it to the faith and practices of the latter school. The efforts of this. school were therefore directed towards the maintenance of their position that their system alone can lead to supreme bliss.</p>
<p>The person who appeared prominently on the scene on this occasion was Gauḍapādācārya and some time after him the pupil of his pupil, Śaṁkarācārya. The theory that this latter set up, was that there exists one spirit alone, and the feelings of individuality and other attributes of the animal spirit and the variety of the inanimate world, owe their origin to a principle of illusion, and are consequently unreal. This doctrine left no room for the exercise of love and piety in the world of reality, though its followers allow it in the ordinary illusive condition of the human souls, and therefore it laid the axe at the root of Vaiṣṇavism. The great wish of the Southern leaders of the latter faith was the overthrow of this doctrine of illusion, or Mãyã, on the same Aupaniṣada grounds on which it was set up. And this wish of his predecessor was carried out by Rāmānuja, and henceforward every Vaiṣṇava system, and even., in one or two cases, Śaiva systems had to tack on Aupaniṣada or Vedāntic theories to their own doctrines.</p>
<p>§ 46. Rāmānuja was born in Śaka 938 corresponding to 1016. or 1017 A. D. In his youth he lived at Kāñcīpura or Conjeevaram and was a pupil of Yādavaprakāśa, who was an Advaita philosopher and therefore professed spiritual monism. Rāmānuja whose inclinations were towards Vaiṣṇavism, was dissatisfied with the teachings of his master, and the ultimate result was his seperation from him. He applied himself to the study of the Prabandhas of the Ālvārs and drank in their spirit. When he became a successor of Yāmunācārya, he lived at Śrīraṅgam, near Trichinopoly, and did his life&rsquo;s work there. He is said to have gone on a pilgrimage to the noted holy places of Upper India. In the latter. years of his age he was subjected to persecution by the Cols Fprince of his time, who wanted him to renounce Vaiṣṇavism for Śaivism, in consequence of which he took refuge in 1096 A. D. in the dominions of the Hoysala Yādava princes, who reigned in Mysore and whose capital was Dvarasamudra, the modern Halebid. There he converted Vitthala Deva, popularly called Biṭṭi Deva, Biṭṭi being, in all likelihood, the corruption of Viṭṭhala or Viṭṭhi. This took place in 1098 A. D. Viṭṭhala Deva was not the reigning prince, but administered some of the frontier provinces in the name of his brother Ballāla, who was on the</p>
<p>throne¹. Viṭṭhala Deva or Biṭṭi Deva was called Viṣṇuvardhana after his conversion to Vaiṣṇavism. This is the ordinary account. But what appeurs true is that his name was originally Viṣṇu, which was corrupted into Biṭṭu or Biṭṭi in the Kanarese, the vernacular of the district, so that his original name Biṭṭi Deva is the same as Viṣṇu Deva which he is represented to have assumed after his conversion. He reigned from 1104 to 1141 A. D<sup id="fnref1:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>. Rāmānuja composed the following works: Vedāntasāra,—Vedārthasaṁgraha, Vedāntadīpa, and commentaries, or Bhāṣyas, on the Brahṁasūtras and the Bhagavadgītā³.</p>
<p>§ 47.The Vedāntic theory, or the theory based upon the Brahmasūtras and the Upaniṣads, which Rāmānuja set up to provide scope for the feeling of Bhakti, or love for God and the spirit of worship, was that there are three eternal principles, the individual or animal soul (Cit), the insensate world (Acit), and the Supreme Soul (Īśvara).</p>
<p>There are Upanṣiad texts to support this, and one of them is that in the SU. (I. 12) to the effect that all Brahman, regarded as composed of the enjoyer or sufferer, the objects. from which enjoyment or suffering springs, and the controller or mover, is threefold. But the Brahmasūtras lay it down. on the authority of the Upanṣiad that Brahman is the material. as well as the efficient cause of the world. To make this possible. in his system, Rāmānuja resorts to the passage in BU. of the Mādhyaṁdina school, beginning from III. 7. 3, in which the Supreme Soul is stated to be the internal controller (Antaryāmin) of the individual soul as well as of the external world. The form that he gives to his theory is that the individual soul and the insensate world are the attributes of the Supreme Soul. They constitute his body, as stated in the Upanṣiad also, and thus, they with the controlling inward Supreme Soul constitute one entity called Brahman, just as the body and the in-dwelling soul constitute the human being.</p>

<p>1.See KrishnaswamīAiyangar&rsquo;s paper in No. 8 of the magazine Viśiṣṭādvaitin for most of these facts.</p>
<p>3.See Krishnaswamī&rsquo;s paper alluded to al above.</p>
<p>Before creation the body of the Supreme Soul exists in a subtle form, and when creation takes place, it develops in the form of the existing universe; thus Brahman is the material cause of the external world. It is also the efficient cause, when, as the internal controlling soul, it wills to creat. The subtle form of the insensate world is the Prakṛti, a term first invented by the original author of the Sāṁkhya doctrine. It develops under the guidance of the in-dwelling Supreme Spirit until the mundane egg is produced. The successive stages of Mahat, Ahaṁkāra, etc., are like those of the Sāṁkhya system, which has been adopted by the Purāṇas also in the account of the creation. And the creation after the production of the mundane egg is also made by Īśvara as the internal controller of Brahmadeva, Dakṣa, etc.</p>
<p>Īśvara or God is free from all faults or defects. He is eternal, pervades all living and non-living things, is the internal controller. of all, is pure joy or blessedness, is possessed of the auspicious qualities of knowledge, power, etc., is the creator, protector and destroyer of the world, and is resorted to by those who are afflicted, who wish to gain knowledge, who seek to attain a certain end, and who are already enlightened¹. He confers the fourfold fruit of existence². He is possessed of a wonderful celestial body of unsurpassable beauty and has for his consorts Lakṣmi³, Bhū (the earth), and Līlā(sport).</p>
<p>This Īśvara appears in five different modes :—</p>
<p>I. Para or the highest, in which mode, Nārāyaṇa, called also Para-Brahman and Para-Vāsudeva, lives in a city called Vaikuṇṭha, which is guarded by certain persons and which has door-keepers; seated in a pavilion of gems on a couch in the form of the serpent Śeṣa, placed on a throne having the eight legs, Dharma and others; attended by Śrī, Bhū and Līlā; holding the celestial weapons, conch-shell, discus, and others; adorned. with celestial ornaments, such as a tiara and others: possessed of numberless auspicious attributes, knowledge, power, and others;and his presence being enjoyed by the eternal spirits, such as Ananta, Garuḍa, Viṣvaksena, and others, and by delivered souls.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.These are the four, Ārta, Jijn̄āsu, atc., mentioned in BhG. (7. 16).</p>
<p>2.Artha, or worldly prosperity, Kāma, or the objects of desire, Dharma, or religious merit, and Mokṣa, or final deliverance, are the four objects of existence.</p>
<p>3.From the Tattvatrayaof Lokācārya.</p>
<p>II. Vyūha, in which the Para himself has assumed four forma, Vāsudeva, Saṁkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha for convenience of worship, and for purposes such as creation, etc. Of these. Vāsudeva is possessed of the six qualities; Saṁkarṣaṇa has two, viz., omniscience and sustaining power! Pradyumna two, viz. controlling power and unchangeableness, and Aniruddha, creative power and all-overcoming prowess¹.</p>
<p>III. Vibhava, which mode consists of the ten Avatāras, fish, tortoise, etc.</p>
<p>IV. Antaryāmin, in which mode he dwells in the heart and is to be seen by Yogins and accompanies the individual souls even when they go to heaven or hell.</p>
<p>V. Idols or images set up in houses, villages, towns, etc., made up of a material chosen by the worshipper, in which he dwells. with a body not made up of matter<sup id="fnref1:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Other authorities leave out Vāsudeva from the Vyūhas and have the other three only. The Arthapañcaka has another form. of the Antaryāmin, in which form he dwells in everything and rules over all, is bodiless, all-pervading and store of all good attributes, and is called Viṣṇu, Nārāyaṇa, Vāsudeva³, etc.</p>
<p>Self-consciousness, knowledge, union as a soul with a body, agency, are attributes common to the supreme and individual souls<sup id="fnref1:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>. The latter is self-illumined, joyous, eternal, atomic, imperceptible to the senses, unthinkable, devoid of parts, unchangeable, the substratum of knowledge, subject to God&rsquo;s control, depending on God&rsquo;s existence for his own existence and an attribute of God<sup id="fnref1:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup>. This description of the individual soul differs agreat deal from that of SŚaṁkarācārya, who attributes no agency or substantiality to it; and the dependence on God in a variety of ways cannot, of course, be thought of under the doctrine of spiritual monism. The soul&rsquo;s being an atom is also denied by Śamkara&rsquo;s school and various others. The souls are many and are divided into:—</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.These are translations of the words Jñāna, Bala, Aiśvarya, Virya, Śakti, and Tējas, according to the definitions in the Yatīndramatadīpikā.</p>
<p>3.See my Report on the Search for Sanskrit Manuscripts during 1883-84, p. 69, [Volume II of this Edition, p. 184-N. B. U.]</p>
<p>(1) Baddha or tied down to the circle of existences from Brahmadeva to the vilest worm, as well as the vegetable souls;</p>
<p>(2) Mukta or finally delivered; and</p>
<p>(3) Nitya or eternal.</p>
<p>Of the first class, those that are rational, that is, not brutes or vegetables, are of two sorts: (1) desirous of enjoyment; (2) desirous of final deliverance. Of those that are desirous of enjoyment, some devote themselves to the acquisition of wealth and the satisfaction of carnal desires, and others, who seek to attain the happiness of heaven, perform all rites and sacrifices, make pilgrimages to holy places and give in charity. Some of these devote themselves to Bhagavat and others to other deities.</p>
<p>Some of those who desire final deliverance seek the consciousness of their pure soul only (Kevalin), and others eternal bliss. Of these latter, some are Bhaktas, who seek to attain God by resorting to Bhakti with all its details, having first of all studied the Vedas and acquainted themselves with the Vedānta and the philosophy of rites (Karman). The three upper orders alone can practise Bhakti, but not the Sūdras. Others are Prapannas, who are those who take refuge in God, feeling themselves poor and helpless. Of Prapannas, some seek the first three objects of life, while the rest, finding no happiness in these, renouncing everything worldly, desire eternal bliss ( Mokṣa) alone, and, seeking the advice of a preceptor and acquiring from him the impulse to action, fling themselves on the will of God, not having the power of going through the Bhakti process and being helpless. This Prapatti or surrender to God can be practised by all orders, including Śūdras<sup id="fnref1:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup>.</p>
<p>What are necessary for the efficacy of the method of Bhakti,</p>
<p>are Karmayoga or the performance of actions, and Jñānayoga or the acquisition of knowledge Karmayoga is the performance of all acts, rites and ceremonies without regard for the fruit resulting from them. These are the worship of the deity, practice of austerity, pilgrimage to holy places, giving in charity and sacrifices.</p>
<p>This Karmayoga purifies the soul and leads to Jñānayoga, or acquisition of knowledge. This knowledge consists in seeing oneself as distinct from Prakṛti, or matter, and as an attribute of God himself (Śeṣa). This Jñānayoga leads to Bhakti.</p>
<p>Bhaktiyoga, or the method of Bhakti, consists in continuous meditation accompanied by the practice of the eight Yoga processes, Yama, Niyama, etc. This is to be attained. by (1) the purification of the body by the use of unpolluted and unprohibited food, (2) chastity, (3) constant practice, (4) the performance of five great rites and ceremonies according to one&rsquo;s means, (5) virtues such as truth, uprightness, compassion, obarity, non-destruction of life, (6) hopefulness or absence of despondency, and (7) absence of elatedness. Bhakti, as promoted by these seven means, assumes the form of actually seeing (God) and produces the final mental perception.</p>
<p>Prapatti consists in the resolution to yield, the avoidance of opposition¹, a faith that God will protect, acceptance of him as saviour or praying him to save and sense of helplessness resulting in throwing one&rsquo;s whole soul on him². Prapatti thus comes to selfsurrender<sup id="fnref1:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The Arthspañcaka mentions a fifth way called Acāryābhimanāyoga, which is for one who is unable to follow any of the others, and consists in surrendering oneself to an Ācārya or preceptor and being guided by him in everything. The preceptor goesthrough all that is necessary to effect his pupil&rsquo;s deliverance as a mother takes medicine herself to cure an infant.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.The two expressions thus translated have also been otherwise oxplained as bearing good-will to all and the absence of ill-will.</p>
<p>2.There is another ronding hare which should be translated as&quot;throwing one-self upon him and a feeling of helplessness.&rdquo; Thus there are six constituents of Prapatti. These are;(1)Ānukūlyasya saṁkalpaḥ (2) prātikūlyasya varjanam, (3) rakṣiṣyantīti viśvāso (4) gōptṛvavaraṇaṁ tathā, (5)ātmanikṣepa - (6) karpaṇneṣaḍvidhāśaraṇāgatiḥ.</p>
<p>Sixteen modes of worship are to be practised by the devotees of Viṣṇu, as stated in a passage quoted from the Padma-Purāṇa by a recent writer of the Rāmānuja school. Eight of these are the same. as those included in the nine modes of Bhakti enumerated in al previous Section<sup id="fnref1:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>as mentioned in the Bhāgavata-Purāṇa, Sakhya, or friendship or companionship, boing omitted. The other eight are : (1) imprinting the marks of the conch-shell and the discus. and other weapons of Hari on the body; (2) the making of a vertical mark on the forehead; (3) repeating of Mantras on the occasion; (4) drinking the water used in washing the feet of Hari; (5) the eating of the offerings of cooked food made to him; (6) doing service to his devotees: (7) the observance of fast on the 11th of the bright and dark halves of each lunar month; (8) laying Tulasi leaves on the idol of Hari.</p>
<p>A text from the Hārītasmṛti is also quoted giving nine modes of worship (Bhakti), three of which are common to it with the Bhāgavata-Purāṇa. The other six are the same as the eight in the above, the first two being combined and the third being omitted. The vertical mark on the forehead mentioned above consists of two lines made with white earth and a connecting cross line at the bottom, with, in the middle, a yellow line made with turmeric powder or a red line composed of the same material reddened by mixing it with lime.</p>
<p>§ 48. In Northern India there are not many followers of Rāmānuja; in Southern India there is a very large number. There are two Schools among them, known by the names of Vaḍakalai or northern learning, and Tenkalai or southern learning. The essential difference between them is brought out by the different illustrations² that they give of the connection between God&rsquo;s grace and man&rsquo;s effort in bringing about final deliverance. The illustration. used by the former, or the northern, is that of a female monkey and her cub. The cub has to hold fast its mother on the abdomen tobe conveyed to a safe place. The southerners use the illustration of the cat and its kittens. The female cat catches hold of the kitten, without any effort on its part, and takes it to a place of safety. In the first case the doctrine is that the process of deliverance must begin with an act of a person seeking it. In the other case the process begins with God himself.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>2.The following remarks are based on Viśiṣṭādvaitin, Vol. I, No. 8, pp. 200ff., and Mr. Govindacharya&rsquo;s article, JRAS, 1910, pp. 1103 ff.</p>
<p>In keeping with this distinction is the idea of Prapatti or self-surrender held by the two Sects. The first maintains that Prapatti is one of the ways resorted to by the devotee and begins with him. The southern School holds that it is not one of the ways, but it is. a frame of mind which characterises all those who seek absolution, and reject all other ways in favour of this. Those who resort to other ways have not arrived at the right mood which leads to God. When a soul is in this frame of mind, God himself takes. entire possession of him, while by the other ways, man, as it were, makes approaches towards him. The Vaḍakalai lays down that Prapatti is for those who cannot follow other ways, such as Karmayoga, Jñānayoga and Bhaktiyoga, while the Tenkalai holds that it is necessary for all, whether able or not, to follow the other ways. The first School says that one should give himself up to God when one finds other ways, which have been resorted to, to be fruitless. The second holds that self-abandonment to God. should precede the trial of other ways Self-assertiveness is the characteristic of the first, but it is forbidden by the second and self- abandonment is enjoined. The northerners say that the six ways of Prapatti or self-surrender given above are preliminaries to the Prapatti which results from them. The southerners say that Prapatti must take place first and then the six follow as results.</p>
<p>The nothern School teaches that a person belonging to an inferior caste should be treated well only so far as conversation by words is concerned. The southerners say that they should be. admitted to an equal treatment in all respects and no distinction be made. The syllable Om should be omitted from the eight- syllabled Mantra, according to the Vaḍakalai, when taught to others than Brāhmaṇas; the Tenkalai does not make this distinction and provides for the teaching of the whole Mantra in the same form to all<sup id="fnref1:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup>.</p>
<p>§ 49. It will be seen from the short summery here given that Rāmānuja derives his metaphysical doctrines from texts in the Upaniṣads and from the Brahmasūtras, while his theory of the external world is that adopted by the Purāṇas and based on the twenty-four elements of the Sāṁkhya system. His Vaiṣṇavism is the Vāsudevism of the old Pāñcarātra system combined with the Nārāyaṇa and Viṣṇu elements. The last name does not occur. often in the literature of his school. The most prominent name is NNārāyaṇa, though Vāsudeva takes his proper place when the Supreme Soul and the Vyūhas are spoken of. The name of Gopālakṛṣṇa is conspicuous by its absence, and Ramānuja&rsquo;s system is free from that repulsive form which Vaiṣṇavism assumes when Rādhāand other cowherdesses are introduced. Rāma too does not appear to be a favourite deity. Rāmānuja&rsquo;s doctrines as to the way of reaching the Supreme Soul are the same as, or amplified forms of, those in the Bhagavadgītā. But in this system Bhakti is reduced to the form of a continuous meditation on the Supreme Soul. It thus corresponds to the Upāsanãs, or meditations, described by Bādarāyaṇa, and does not mean a boundless love for God, as the word is commonly understood, though the meditation that is enjoined implies tacitly a feeling of love.</p>
<p>The tendency of Rāmānuja&rsquo;s system seems to be to give an exclusive Brāhmaṇic form to the traditional method of Bhakti, or devotion to God, and this is distinctly seen in the doctrines of the Vaḍakalai; while Tenkalai, or southern learning, is more liberal and so shapes the doctrines of the system as to make them applicable to Śūdras also. But we shall find the Śūdras asserting themselves when we come to the disciples of Rāmānanda and to the Marāṭha saints and teachers, Nāmdeva and Tukārāma.</p>
<p>The fifth Upāya, or way to God, given in the Arthapañcaka, of surrendering oneself completely to a teacher or preceptor, doing nothing oneself and the preceptor doing all that is necessary for one&rsquo;s redemption, seems suspicious. It has a striking resemblance to the Christian doctrine of Christ suffering, or in the words of our author, going through the processes necessary for redemption, the believer doing nothing but putting complete faith in his saviour. If the prevalence of Christianity in and before the time of Rāmānuja in the country about Madras is a proved fact, this</p>
<p>doctrine as well as some of the finer points in the theory of Prapatti may be traced to the influence of Christianity. Rāmānuja&rsquo;s system is known by the name of Śrīsaṁpradāya or the tradition springing from Śrī.</p>
<p><strong>XVI Madhva or Ānandatīrtha</strong></p>
<p>§ 50. The great object of the Vaiṣṇava teachers of the eleventh century and upwards was to confute the theory of Māyā, or the unreality of the world, and establish the doctrine of Bhakti, or love and faith, on a secure basis Rāmānuja effected this by the system which he promulgated and which we have already noticed. But in order to reconcile his doctrine with the theory set forth in the Brahmasūtras on the basis of the Upanṣiad, that God is the material as well as the efficient cause of the world, he propounded the doctrine of God&rsquo;s being a composite person, having for his body the individual souls and the inanimate world. Even this Madhva considered objectionable as having a tendency to depreciate the independent majesty of God, and therefore he denies his being the material cause of the world. All the Sūtras of Bādarāyaṇa which set forth that doctrine have been interpreted by him. in an entirely different way. Probably he would have set aside the Brahmsūtras altogether, but he could not do so, since the work had acquired an uncontested authoritativeness as regards. religious truth before his time. He had therefore to show that his system did not go against the Brahmsūtras, and therefore accepted them and interpreted them in almost a fantastic manner. Texts from the Upanişads, too, which do not agree with his doctrines, he treats similarly.</p>
<p>In opposition to the pure monism of Śaṁkara and the qualified. monism of Rāmānuja, Ānandatīrthasets forth five eternal distinotions or individualities, viz., the distinction between</p>
<p>(1) God and the individual spirit,</p>
<p>(2) God and the inanimate world,</p>
<p>(3) the individual spirit and the inanimate world,</p>
<p>(4) one individual spirit and another,</p>
<p>(5) one inanimate object and another.</p>
<p>According to the Madhvavijaya, or the history of the triumphs of Madhva, by Nārāyaṇa, the son of Trivikrama, there was in the</p>
<p>town of Rajatapīṭha a family known by the name of Madhyageha.Mādhva&rsquo;s father was called Madhyagehabhaṭṭa¹; the name given. to Madhva after his birth was Vāsudeva. After Vāsudeva had received the usual education of a Brāhmaṇa, he was initiated as an anchorite by Acyutaprekṣācarya who thus became his Guru. After his initiation he went to Badarikāśrama in the Himālaya and brought back the idols of Digvijaya Rāmaand Vedavyāsa. He was raised to the seat of high priest in the presenceof kings.</p>
<p>Ānandatīrṭha went from country to country, putting down the advocates of the doctrine of Māyāand others, established the Vaiṣṇava creed. He had for his pupils Padmanābhatīrṭha, Naraharitīrṭha, Mādhavatīrṭha, and Akṣobhyattīrṭha. Naraharitīrṭha was sent to Jagannātha in Orissa to bring the original idols of Rāma and Sītā. Ānandatīrtha&rsquo;s other names. were Pūrṇaprajña and Madhyamandāra, or wish-giving tree of the family of Madhya.</p>
<p>The date of his death given in the list preserved in several of the Maṭhas, or establishments of the sect, is Śaka 1119, and as he lived for seventy-nine years, the death of his birth has been given as Śaka 1040. But these statements are open to serious doubts. There is an Inscription in the Kūrmeśvara temple at Śrīkūrmam in the Chicacole Taluka of the Ganjam District, in which Naraharitīrṭha is represented to have constructed a temple and placed in it an idol of Yogānandanarasiṁha in the year Śaka 1203<sup id="fnref1:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup>.The first person therein mentioned is Puruṣottamatīrṭha, who is the same as Acyutaprekṣa<sup id="fnref1:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup>, then his pupil Ānandatīrṭha, and the last is Narabaritīrṭha, the pupil of Ānandatīrtha. This Narabaritīrṭha is considered by some, to have been the ruler of Orissa. But this arises from a confusion between him and a king bearing the same name, in the slightly modified form of Narasiṁha, who was the actual ruler of the country from about Śaka 1191 to</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.Kallianpur in the Udipi Taluka of the district of South Kanara is stated to be the birth-place of Madhva. It was probably the same as the Rajatapīṭhaof the Madhvavijnya. (Imp. Gas, Vol. XIV, page 314.)</p>
<p>1225. He is mentioned in an Inscription at Śrīkūrmam of Naraharitīrtha himself, hearing the date Śaka 1215, which is represented as the eighteenth year of the king&rsquo;s reign<sup id="fnref1:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup>. He was Narasiṁha II, and was the prince panegyrised in a work on rhetoric, the Ekāvali². Naraharitīrtha&rsquo;s other dates gathered from other Inscriptions range between Śaka 1186 and 1212<sup id="fnref1:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup>. All these epigraphical records confirm the truth of the tradition that Naraharitīrtha was sent by Ānandatīrtha to Orissa. He appears to have. hold a very high position there.</p>
<p>Now if Naraharitīrtha&rsquo;s active period extended from Śaka 1186 to 1215, his master could not have died in Śaka 1119, i. e., fully 67 years before. It seems, therefore, reasonable to take the date. given in Madhva&rsquo;s Mahābhāratatātparyanirṇaya, which is 4300 of the Kali age, to be the correct date of his birth. It corresponds to Śaka 1121, which, bearing in mind the fact that some use the current year of an era and some the past, we must regard as equivalent to Śaka 1119, the date given in the lists for Ānandatīrtha&rsquo;s death. But instead of taking it as the date of his death, we shall have to regard it as the date of his birth. He lived for 79 years according to the current account, so that his death must be placed in Śaka 1198⁴. The two dates may, therefore, be taken as settled.</p>
<p>Ānandatīrtha thus lived in the first three quarters of the thirteenth century. He was succeeded, according to the list, by Padmanabhatīrtha who held the pontificate for seven years, i, e., up. to Śaka 1205. He was succeeded by Naraharitīrtha who occupied. the pontifical seat for nine years, i, e., up to Śaka 1214, or, if we regard 1121 as the date of the first pontiff&rsquo;s birth according to the strict interpretation of the Kali date, up to Śaka 1216; and, as wel have seen, his latest date in the Inscriptions is Śaka 1215.</p>

<p>4.This agrees with the tradition existing in the Maṭha at Phalmāru, near Mulki in South Canara, to the effect that Ānandatīrtha was born in Śaka 1119 and died in Śaka 1199, Ep. Ind., VI, p. 263, note.</p>
<p>with some modifications of their own¹. God is a substance. The supreme soul possesses innumerable or an infinite number of qualities. His functions are eight, viz., (1) creation, (2) protection, (3) dissolution, (4) controlling all things, (5) giving knowledge, (6) manifestation of himself, (7) tying beings down to the world, (8) redemption. He is omniscient, expressible by all words, and entirely different from the individual souls and the inanimate world. He possesses the holy form made up of knowledge, joy, etc., independent of every thing, and one only, assuming different forms. All his forms are his full manifestations, and he is identically the same with his incarnations in qualities, parts, and actions. Lakṣmīis distinct from the Supreme Soul, but entirely dependent on him. She is eternal and blessed (Makta) like the Supreme Soul and is his consort. She has various forms, but no material body, and is thus like the Supreme Soul, and like him ist expressible by all words. She possesses the same extension in space. and time as the Supreme Soul, i. e., is concomitant with him.</p>
<p>Jīvas or individual souls go through the usual succession of existences and are characterised by ignorance or other defects. They are innumerable individually, or as members of groups, such as Ṙjus<sup id="fnref1:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup> who are fit for attaining Brahmahood, and others who are fit for the attainment of the dignity of Rudra, Garuḍa, Asuras, or demons, etc. They are of three kinds: (1) fit for attaining final bliss, (2) always going through the circle of existences, and (3) fit for the conditon of darkness. The gods, Ṛṣis, and the manes, and the best of men, belong to the first class, ordinary men belong to the second class, and demons, ghosts, and the vilest of men, etc., to the the third class. All these individual souls are distinct from each other and from the Supreme Soul.</p>
<p>Creation begins when the Supreme Soul disturbs the equilibrium of the Prakṛti, which then develops into all the other principles of the Samkhya system, as modified by the Purāṇas, until the mundane egg is produced. Then placing the sentient and non-</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.This account of the system is abridged from a work called Madhvasiddhāntasāraby Padmanābhasūri, printed in Bombay by Javaji Dadaj irnayasagara Press, published at Kumbhakonam in Śaka 1815, corresponding to 1883 A. D. The tedious details are omitted.</p>
<p>sentient objects into his inside, he enters into the mundane egg. Then, at the end of a thousand celestial years he produces from his navel a lotus, which is the seat of the four-faced Brahmadeva; and from this last after a long time the ordinary creation takes place.</p>
<p>All knowledge springs from Paramātman, whatever the means by which it is produced. It is of two kinds-that which leads to worldly existence, and that which leads to Mokṣa. Viṣṇu bestows knowledge on the ignorant, and Mokṣa on those who have knowledge. The knowledge, or feeling which creates an attachment to the body, child or wife, leads to a worldly life. This is not true. knowledge, but ignorance from which results that worldly life, and that ignornce is dispelled by the knowledge of God.</p>
<p>Mokṣa is attained by the direct knowledge or perception of Hari by means of a method of service possible to oneself and in a body fitted for it. That direct perception is possible to all good individual souls from Brahmadeva to the best of men. This direct perception is to be attained by many means.</p>
<p>What are necessary for direct knowledge, which leads to Mokṣa, are (1) Vairāgya, or the disgust of enjoyments of this world. or the next, generated by seeing the vanity of the world by the company of good persons; (2) equanimity (Śama) and self-control (Dama), etc.; (3) acquaintance with the lore; (4) self-surrender (Śaraṇāgati), in which the mind is devoted to God, as the best of all beings, and is full of the highest love and in which everything is resigned to God and he is worshipped with devotedness in the three ways, and which is accompanied with the faith that He will unfailingly protect and the feeling that the devotee is His: (5) attendance on a Guru, or preceptor, and propitiation of him, which is necessary for Mokṣa or redemption (6) acquisition of knowledge from the Guru and not from books, or, in the absence of a Guru, from a good Vaiṣṇava, and, in rare cases, from books also; (7) reflection over what has been taught; (8) devotion, in the order of their merits, to a preceptor and persons. better than oneself and deserving respect; (9) love of God (Paramātmabhakti) consequent on the knowledge of God&rsquo;s greatness and his being the best of all. This love should be firm and higher</p>
<p>than that for all others, and this leads to Mokṣa or eternal bliss. (10) sympathy for those who are inferior, but good men, love for those who are equal, as if they were the same as themselves, and respectful love or reverence for superiors; (11) performing rites and ceremonies deliberately without any desire, which has the effect of purifying the soul; (12) the avoidance of prohibited deeds, i.e., sins. great and small; (13) resigning every act to Hari as done by him. and not by oneself; (14) the knowledge of the comparative position of beings and of Viṣṇu as the highest of all; (15) knowledge. of the five distinctions already mentioned: (16) distinguishing Prakṛti from Puruṣa, all beings (from Nārāyaṇa down to men, with their consorts) being Puruṣas, and the inanimate world being the Prakṛti (17) reprobation of false doctrines; (18) Upāsanāor worship. This last is of two kinds, viz., (1) the learning of the Śastras, (2) meditation. Meditation (Nididhyāsa) is placing Bhagavat. before the mind&rsquo;s eye to the exclusion of everything else. This meditation is possible for one who has a distinct knowledge of a thing acquired after the removal of ignorance, doubt and delusion. by means of reading or hearing something read and reflection. Some people meditate on Bhagavat as a single spirit and others on him. as having four phases as Sat (existence), Cit (knowledge), ĀnandaJoy) Ātman (spirit). Then are given meditations resorted to by gods and some of those mentioned in the Brahmasūtras.</p>
<p>All these eighteen ways lead to the direct knowledge of God, which is possible for all from Brahmadeva to man. The direct knowledge of God attained by men is comparable with the coruscation of lightning, and that attained by gods to the bright disk of the sun. Garuḍa and Rudra have that knowledge in the shape of a reflection, while Brahmadeva has the knowledge of the whole with all its parts, and some have the knowledge of Him as dwelling in the universe and limited by the universe. The direct knowledge is simply mental.</p>
<p>§ 52. The followers of Madhva wear a mark on the forehead. composed of two white perpendicular lines made with an earth called Gopīcandana above the bridge of the nose, and a dark line. in the middle with a reddish spot in the centrel The two white lines are joined by a cross line on the bridge of the nose. They</p>
<p>wear on the shoulders and on the other parts of their body prints, made with the same white earth, of the conch-shell, the discus, and other weapons of Viṣṇu. These are impressed occasionally with a heated metallic stamp on the skin, so as to leave a permanent scar. Members of this sect exist in pretty large numbers in the Kanarese Districts of the Bombay Presidency, Mysore, and on the Western Coast from Gon to South Kanara, and there are only scattered adherents in Northern India. There are eight establishments, or Maṭhas, for the dissemination and preservation of the creed in South Kanara and three in the inner country. Some of these were founded by Ānandatīrtha himself.</p>
<p>Ānandatīrtha composed thirty-seven¹ different treatises. He includes among the authorities enumerated by him in support of his system the Pāñcarātra-Saṁhitās; but it will be seen from the account given above that in his creed there is no place for the Vyūhas, Vāsudeva and others, and the name by which the Supreme Spirit is spoken of is mostly Viṣṇu. Some of His incarnations, especially Rāmaand Krṣṇa, are also adored But the Gopāla-Krṣṇa element seems to be entirely absent from his system, and Rādhāand the cowherdesses are not mentioned.</p>
<p>It thus appears that the Pāñcarātra or Bhāgavata system hast been set aside by Ānandatīrtha or thrown into the background. The old traditional Vāsudevism of the Bhāgavata school gradually disappeared about his time and made room for general. Vaiṣṇavism.</p>
<p>XVII. Nimbārka.</p>
<p>§ 53. We have thus noticed the form which Vaiṣṇavism assumed in the South from the middle of the eleventh century to the middle of the thirteenth. A strong feeling of Bhakti, or love, and a fear of the dangerous consequences of the doctrine of Māyā, or illusion, were the guiding principles of the new development. The influence of this last extended itself to the North, and we can distinguish between two classes of founders of sects, viz.,</p>
<p>(1) those who wrote in Sanskrit,and (2) those who used the vernacular for the propagation of their creed.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.For the names of these, see the Granthamālikāstotra in my Report on the Search for Sanskrit Manuscripts during 1882-83, p. 207. [= Volume II of this Edition, p. 24f. N. B. U. ]</p>
<p>The first of the former class we have to notice is Nimbārka Nimbārka is said to have been a Tailanga Brāhmaṇa by birth and to have lived in a village called Nimbā¹, which perhaps is. the same as Nimbāpura in the Bellary District. He was born. on the 3rd of the bright half of Vaiśākha, and his father&rsquo;s name was Jagannātha, who was a Bhāgavata, and his mother&rsquo;s Sarasvati². He is believed by his followers to be an incarnation of the Sudarśana, or the discus of Viṣṇu. As to when he flourished wel have no definite information, but he appears to have lived some time after Rāmānuja³. Nimbārka composed the Vedāntapārijāta-</p>

<p>2.Introduction to the commentary on Daśaślokīby Harivyāsadeva. It is to be regretted that the commentator does not give the year of Nimbārka&rsquo;s birth.</p>
<p>3.In my Report on the Search for Sanskrit Manuscripts for the year 1882-83, I have given two succession lists of spiritual teachers, one of the sect of Ānandatirtha (p. 203) and another of that founded by Nimbārka (pp. 208- 13). This contains 37 names. There is another list in Manuscript 709 of the Collection of 1884-7, which contains 45 names. The two lists agree to No. 32 Harivyāsadeva. After that, while the first has only five names, the second has thirteen names, and none of these agrees with any of the five, so that after Harivyāsadeva, the lino appears to have divided itself into two branches, No. 709 of the same Collection was written in Saṁvat 1800 corresponding to 1750 A. D., when Gosvāmin Dāmodara was living. He was the thirty-third after Nimbārka in the new branch line. The thirty- third after Ānandatirtha died in 1876 A. D. Ānandatirtha according to our revised date died in 1276 A. D., so that thirty-three successors occupied 603 years. Supposing that the thirty-three successors of Nimbārka occupied about the same period, and allowing about fifteen years of life to Dāmodara Gosvāmin, who was living in 1750 A. D., and subtracting from 1765 A. D. 603 years, we have 1162 which is about the date of Nimbārka&rsquo;s death, so that he lived after Rāmānuja. This calculation of ours is of course very rough, and, besides, the date of the Manuscript No, 706, which is read as 1913 by some, but which looks like 1813, conflicts with this calculation, as nine more Ācāryas flourished after Dāmodara. And, if 1813 is the correct date, seven years cannot suffice for these, though 107 may, if the date is read 1913.</p>
<p>saurabha, which is a short commentary on the Brahmasūtras, and also a small work containing ten stanzas of the name of Siddhāntāratna, usually called Daśaśloki, from the number of stanzas contained in it. Śrīnivāsa, the immediate follower of Nimbārka, wrote a commentary called Bhāṣya on the first, and Harivyāsadeva, the thirty-second in the list of succession, wrote on the second. The thirteenth in the list, Devācārya, wrote the Siddhāntajāhnavī, and his successor, Sundarabhaṭṭa, wrote a commentary on it, called Setu. The thirtieth in the list composed a commentary, or Bhāṣya, on the Brahmasūtras. His name was Kesava Kaśmīrin.</p>
<p>§ 52. Nimbārka&rsquo;s Vedāntic theory is monistic as well as pluralistic. The inanimate world, the individual soul and God are distinct from one another as well as identical. Identical they are in the sense that the first two have no independent existence, but are dependent on God for their existence and action. The theory of the Brahmasūtras that Brahman is the material cause of the universe, is thus understood: To be the material cause of an effect is (1) to possess the capacity of assuming the form of that effect, and (2) to be fitted to do so. Brahman possesses various capacities which are of the nature of the animate and inanimate worlds. These in a subtle form constitute its natural condition. This satisfies the first of the two requirements. The capacities again contain in them the rudiment of the effect, i. e., the world, in a subtle form. This meets the second requirement. By realising these capacities. and bringing the subtle rudiment into a gross form, Brahman becomes the material cause of the world. Rāmānuja&rsquo;s theory of Brahman forming with the animate and inanimate world a composite personality and of its being the material cause in so far as the bodily portion of the composite personality becomes developed, is rejected by the school<sup id="fnref1:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup>. For a further knowledge of the system, I will here give a translation of the Daśaśloki.</p>
<p>I. Jīva, or the individual soul, is knowledge, dependent on Hari, and is in a condition to be associated with, or dissociated from, a body; is an atom, different in different bodies, and is a knower and numberless.</p>
<p>It is called knowledge here to show that it is able to know</p>
<p>without the organs of sense, and it is not to be understood hero that the soul is the mere phenomenon of knowledge, and not a substance, which is the doctrine of Śamkarācārya.</p>
<p>II. The individual soul has his form distorted by its contact with Māyā, or the constituent principle with the three qualities which has no beginning. Its true nature becomes known by the grace of God.</p>
<p>Individual souls are of two sorts: (1) those delivered or in a supremely blissful condition; (2) those tied down to the circle of existences. The first are of two kinds: (I) those who are eternally in a supremely blissful condition, such as (a) Garuḍa, Viṣvaksena, and (b) the crown, ear-ornaments and the flute considered as living beings; and (II) those who are freed from the trammels of life. Of these last some attain to the likeness of God and others are content with the perception of the nature of their own soul. Corresponding to these two last are two kinds of Mumukṣu, those who seek deliverance of either kind.</p>
<p>III. The inanimate objects are of three kinds: (1) not derived from Prakṛti; (2) derived from Prakṛti, and (3) time. In the things derived from Prakṛti we have the ordinary material objects having the three colours, viz., red, white, and dark.</p>
<p>The first class consists of those which are spoken of figuratively. by the use of the names of objects belonging to the second class, such as the sunlike refulgence of the Supreme Soul. It is a rofulgence not arising from the Prakṛti. Similarly the body, hands, feet, and ornaments of God, as well as all the surroundings, such as garden, palace, etc., belong to the first class and are of an inanimate nature, though they are not made of matter, i. e., not derived from Prakṛti¹.</p>
<p>IV. I meditate on the highest Brahman, viz., Krṣṇa, who has eyes like the lotus, who naturally is free from all faults, is the store of all beneficent attributes, who has Vyuhas for his parts, and who is adored by all.</p>
<p>____________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.The physical attributes, given to God by Rāmānuja and the rest and to which the word &lsquo;celestial&rsquo; is sometimes prefixed,are to be understood in this sense.</p>
<p>The Vyūhas here mentioned are those usually referred to in the Pāñcarātra and Rāmānuja systems. The commentators understand. the incarnations also by this expression. One gives a large number of these, divided into classes on certain principles. Krṣṇa is called Vareṇya or adored by all, because he has a holy celestial body and bodily qualities, such as beauty, tenderness, sweetness and charm. All these are of course non-material (Aprākṛta), though inanimate according to Stanza III.</p>
<p>V. I reflect on the daughter of Vṛṣabhānu (Rādhikā), who shines with a corresponding beauty on the left side (of Krṣṇa), ist attended on by thousands of female friends, and who always confers all desired objects.</p>
<p>VI. This Parabrahman should be always worshipped uninterruptedly by men in order to be free from the darkness in the shape of ignorance, in which they are enveloped. So was Nārada, who directly perceived the whole truth, taught by Sanandana and others.</p>
<p>VII. All things having Brahman for their souls in accordance with the Śrutis and Smṛtis, the knowledge that [ Brahman ] is all is true. This is the doctrine of those who know the Vedas, and at the same time the three forms are true as determined from the sacred precepts (Smṛtis) and the Sūtras.</p>
<p>Here is laid down the unity of all things in so far as Brahman. is the inner controlling soul of all and is concomitant with them, and their existence and actions are dependent on it, and also pluralism, since there are three distinct substances, which are called forms of Brahman in the Stanza, vix, the inanimate world, the individual soul and the Supreme Soul.</p>
<p>VIII. There appears no way to salvation except the lotus-like feet of Kṛṣṇa, which are adored by Brahmadeva, Śiva and others Krṣṇa, who, at the desire of a devotee, assumes a form easy of meditation and whose power is unthinkable and whose essence cannot be comprehended.</p>
<p>IX. His grace extends itself to those who have a feeling of helplesṣṇess and other qualifications, and by that grace is generated. Bhakti, or devotion, consisting of special love for Him, Who has</p>
<p>no superior lord. This Bhakti is of two kinds: the highest is one, and the other is that which leads to or is instrumental to it.</p>
<p>By the feeling of helplesṣṇess and other qualifications are meant the six modes of Prapatti given in connection with Rāmānuja&rsquo;s system. The Bhakti which is instrumental to that which is the highest, is of the nature of the six or nine modes mentioned in previous Sections.</p>
<p>X. These five things should be known by the devotees: (1) the nature of the being to be worshipped; (2) the nature of the worshipper: (3) the fruit of Gods&rsquo;s grace; (4) the feeling of enjoyment consequent on Bhakti, or love; (5) obstructions to the attainment of God.</p>
<p>The first is the knowing of the nature of the Supreme Being as existence, intelligence and joy (Saccidānanda ), of his possessing a colestial body (non-material), of his dwelling in such places as the cow-settlement (Vraja), which is called the celestial city (Vyomapura), of his being the cause of all, omnipotent, tender, merciful, gracious towards his devotees, and so forth. The second consists in knowing the worshipper as an atom, possessing knowledge aud joy, and as the servant of Krṣṇa, etc. The third is the self-surrender and the giving up of all actions except the service of God, which results in self-surrender. The fourth arises from serenity, servitude, friendliness, affection, and enthusiasm. These states of mind are consequent upon the peculiar relation to God of each individual, as affection was the feeling of Nanda, Vāsudeva and Devakī, and enthusiasm, of Rādhāand Rukmiṇī. The fifth are such as regarding the body as the soul, dependence. on others than God and one&rsquo;s preceptor, indifference to the com- mands of God contained in the sacred books, worshipping other gods, giving up one&rsquo;s own peculiar duties, ingratitude, spending one&rsquo;s life in a worthless manner, vilification of good men, and many others.</p>
<p>§ 55. These ten Stanzas contain the quintessence of Nimbārka&rsquo;s system. This appears to have Rāmānuja&rsquo;s doctrines for its basis and is a sidewise development of it. It gives predominance to Prapatti or self-surrender of the six kinds, alluded to above, and then, by the grace of God, love for Him is generated. His Sādhana</p>
<p>Bhakti comprehends all the Yogas of Rāmānuja&rsquo;s system. Rāmānuja, as we have already remarked<sup id="fnref1:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup>, changes the original sense of Bhakti and renders it equivalent to the Upāsanā, or the meditation prescribed in the Upanṣiads. But Nimbārka keeps to the original sense. His doctrines make a nearor approach to the Tenkalai, or Southern Learning, of the Rāmānujiyas. But the great difference between the two teachers is, that, while Rāmānuja confines himself to Nārāyaṇa and his consorts Lakṣmi, Bhū and Līlā, Nimbārka gives almost an exclusive prominence to Krṣṇa and his mistress, Rādhā, attended on by thousands of her female companions. Thus the fourth element of Vaiṣṇavism which we have mentioned<sup id="fnref1:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup> rises to the surface in Vaiṣṇavism about this. time, and retains its place in Northern India, including Bengal, except in the case of those sects whose favourite deity is Rāmaand not Krṣṇa; and to these for the present we will now turn our attention, coming back again to Krṣṇaism later on.</p>
<p>Nimbārka&rsquo;s system is known by the name of Sanakasaṁpradāya, or the tradition originating with Sanaka. Though Nimbārka was a Southerner, he lived at Vṛndāvana near Mathurā, which accounts for the preference given by him to the RadhaKrṣṇaform of Vaiṣṇavism. His followers are scattered over the whole of Northern India, and exist in large numbers near Mathurāand in Bengal. They wear two perpendicular lines of Gopīcandana with a black spot in the middle on the forehead, and use a necklace and rosary of the wood of the Tulasīplant. They are divided into two classes, the ascetics and householders. This distinction appears to have originated at the time of Harivyāsadeva, after whom, as I have observed in a note, the successors of Nimbārka were divided into two branches. The reason for the division was probably this new distinction.</p>
<p>XVIII. Rāmānanda.</p>
<p>§ 56. A spirit of sympathy for the lower castes and classes of Hindu society has from the beginning been a distinguishing feature of Vaiṣṇavism. Still, so far as we have advanced, the great teachers kept these castes and classes into, what might be</p>
<p>called, an outer court, though they were admitted to the benefits of the new dispensation. They had not, as the pure Vedāntinsassert, to do the duties prescribed for their mean position, and rise in succeeding lives until they were finally born as Brāhmaṇas, when alone they could avail themselves of the methods laid down for the attainment of Mokṣa, or deliverance. They could attain this even as members of the lowest caste by resorting to devotion, but the Brahmanic teachers, Rāmānuja and others, made the methods based on the study of the Vedic literature accessible. only to the higher castes, leaving other methods to the rest.</p>
<p>But Rāmānanda now began a radical reform and made no distinction between Brāhmaṇas and members of the degraded. castes, and all could even dine together, provided they were the devotees of Viṣṇu and had been admitted into the fold. Another reform, which must be traced to Rāmānanda, was the use of the Vernaculars for the propagation of the new creed. And a third very important reform made by him was the introduction of the purer and more chaste worship of Rāmā and Sītāinstead of that of Krṣṇa and Rādhā.</p>
<p>Mr. Macauliffe mentions Mailkot as the place of his birth and says that he must have flourished in the end of the fourteenth and the first half of the fifteenth century, which, he states, corresponds with a reckoning which gives 1398 A D., as the date of the birth of Kabīr. This would rather make Rāmānanda live long before. the end of the fourteenth century, as Kabir was his successor, and ordinarily believed to be his pupil¹. The authority² I have. consulted states that he was born at Prayāga as the son of a Kānyakubja Brāhmaṇa, named Punyasadans, and his wife Suśīlā. The date of his birth is given as 4400 of the Kali age, equivalent to 1356 of Vikkrama-Saṁvat. This corresponds to 1299 or 1300 A. D., and is more consistent with the traditional statement that there were three generations between him and Rāmānuja. Thedate of Rāmānuja&rsquo;s death is usually given as 1137 A. D., though. it makes him out as having lived for 120 years. The lapse of three. generations between 1137 and 1300 A. D., is a more reasonable. supposition than between 1137 and the end of the fourteenth century. This last date, therefore, given for Rāmānanda is manifestly wrong, and that occurring in the book I have consulted appears to be correct in all probability.</p>

<p>1.The Sikh Religion, ate., by M. A. Macauliffe, Vol. VI, pp. 100-1. 1908 A. D. is said by Macauliffe to correspond to the 510th year of his ara. By his he must mean Kabīr&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>2.Chapters from the Agastya-Saṁhitāwith a Hindi translation by Rāmā Nārāyaṇa Dāsa, completed in Saṁvat 1960, corresponding to 1904 A. D.</p>
<p>From Prayāga Rāmānanda was sent to Benares for the usual education of a Brāhmaṇa. After he finished this, he became a disciple of Rāghavānanda, a teachar of the Viśiṣṭādvaita school of Rāmānuja After some time he gave up some of the restrictive practices of the sect, such as that of taking food without being seen by anybody, and separated himself from his preceptor, and himself became the founder of a school. As indicated above, he took pupils from the degraded castes also. Thirteen of them became noted and their names are: 1. Anantānanda, 2. Surasarānanda, 3. Sukhānanda, 4. Naraharīyānanda, 5. Yogānanda, 6. Pīpā, 7. Kabīr, 8. Bhāvanānda, 9. Senā, 10. Dhannā, 11. Gālavānanda, 12. Rāidās, and 13. Padmāvatī.</p>
<p>Of these Pīpāwas a Rajput, Kabīr was a Śūdra and spoken of also as a Mahomedan following the profession of a weaver, Senā was a barber, Dhannāa Jāt, Rāidās belonged to the degraded caste of curriers or workers in leather, and Padmāvatīwas a woman. With the first twelve he went about the country visiting holy places, conducting disputations with the advocates of the Māyā doctrine, Jaius, Buddhists, etc., establishing his own Viśiṣṭādvaita theory, and converting men to his views and admitting them as his disciples. Rāmānanda is stated to have died in 1467 of Vikrama-Saṁvat, corresponding to 1411 A. D. This gives him a life of 111 years, which is rather improbable. Some of his pupils became the founders of different schools, and through them the worship of Rāmā spread over an extensive portion of Northern and Central India, successfully competing with that of Gopāla-Krṣṇa.</p>
<p>XIX. Kabīr.</p>
<p>§ 57. The few particulars that have come down to us about the birth and life of Kabīr are these. He was the son of a</p>
<p>Brāhmaṇa widow who cast him away as soon as he was born, to hide her shame, near the Lahar Tank in Benares. A Mahomedan weaver of the name of Nirūwas passing by the way with his wife Nīmā, when the latter saw the child and carried it home. He was nurtured and brought up by her and her husband Nirū, and Kabīr when he had grown up, followed the occupation of a weaver. He showed leanings towards the Hindu faith, and the idea of making Rāmānanda his Guru, or preceptor, arose in his mind. But he conceived it not possible that that sage should receive a Mahomedan as his disciple and therefore had recourse to a contrivance. He laid himself down on the Ghāṭa, or pavement on the Ganges, at which Rāmānanda bathed very early in the morning. On the way Rāmānanda trampled on the boy and exclaimed &ldquo;Rāma, Rāma! What poor creature is it that I have trampled upon ?&rdquo;. Kabīr rose up and received the exclamation &ldquo;Rāma, Rāma&rdquo; as a Mantra communicated to him by Rāmānanda, and he understood that he had thus been made a disciple.</p>
<p>Another account is that, being trampled on, Kabīr rose up and cried aloud, when Rāmānanda told him to be quiet and go on uttering the name of &ldquo;Rāmā&rdquo;. Considering that he had thus been accepted as a pupil, Kabīr went on with his adorations of God, proclaiming that he was the disciple of Rāmānanda. Some Hindus went to the latter and asked him whether he had initiated Kabīr.Thereupon Kabīr was sent for and asked by Rāmānanda, when it was that he had been initiated. Kabīr mentioned to him. the incident of his having been trampled upon the Ghāṭa, Then Rāmānanda remembered the matter and clasped Kabīr to his breast. Since that time Kabīr regularly attended at his master&rsquo;s Maṭha and joined him in his disputations with the Pandits.</p>
<p>For some time Kabīr lived at Manikapur, as is mentioned in one of his Ramainīs. There he heard of the fame of Shaikh Taqqi and of twenty-one Pīrs. He heard their discourses, condemned. their teachings and said: &ldquo;O Shaikhs, of whatever name! listen to me, Open your eyes and see the origin and the end of all things and their creation and dissolution&rdquo;. In one of the books of this sect, Shaikh Taqqi is represented as an enemy of Kabīr, and a Pīr, or the religious guide, of Sikandar Lodi. At his advice the emperor persecuted Kabīr and used various methods to destroy</p>
<p>him. But Kabīr miraculously escaped death and was eventually reconciled to Sikandar Lodi, who received him into his favour.</p>
<p>Kabīr died at Maghar, and there was a dispute between the Hindus and the Mahomedans as to the disposal of his dead body, which was covered by a sheet of cloth. When the sheet was removed, the body had disappeared, and in its stead there was a heap of flowers. The Mahomedans took one-half of the quantity and buried it at Maghar and erected a tomb over it, and the Hindus took their share to Benares, where it was burnt. Kabīr had a wife of the name of Loi, a son of the name Kamāl, and a daughter of the name of Kamālī. But there are miraculous stories. as to how Kabīr came by them.</p>
<p>As to how much of this account is historical and how much legendary, it is difficult to say. But that he was a Mahomedan weaver at the beginning may be accepted as a fact. And that Shaikh Taqqi, a Mahomedan Pīr, who is mentioned in one of the Ramainīs, as stated above, was his rival and that Kabīr lived about the time of Sikandar Lodi may also be regarded as historical. As to whether Kabīr was a disciple of Rāmānanda, there is some question, as will be presently mentioned. Mr. Westcott considers it not impossible that he should have been both a Mahomedan and a Sūfi¹, but all his writings show a complete familiarity with the names occurring in Hindu religious. literature and Hindu manners and customs, so that it appears to me that there is little or nothing in Kabīr&rsquo;s writings calculated to show that his teachings had a Mahomedan basis. The basis appears to be purely Hindu, though Kabīr was a bold and uncompromising reformer and hurled anathemas at the Pandits, the Brāhmaṇas proud of their caste, and the teachers of the existing sects of the Hindus, and thus appears to have come under the influence of Mahomedanism.</p>
<p>The dates given by various writers for the birth and death of Kabīr are conflicting. Mr. Westcott makes him live for 78 years, from 1440 to 1518 A. D.<sup id="fnref1:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup>, and according to Mr. Macauliffe he</p>

<p>1.Kabīr and the Kabir Panth by Rev. G. H. Westcott. Cawnpore, 1907, p. 44.</p>
<p>13 [ R. G. Bhandarkar&rsquo;s Works, Vol. IV. ]</p>
<p>was born in Saṁvat 1455, corresponding to A. D. 1398<sup id="fnref1:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup>, and ha died in A. D. 1518<sup id="fnref1:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup>, having lived for 119 years, five months and twenty-seven days. In a footnote he quotes from an original work the date Śaka 1370, corresponding to 1448 A. D., as the date of his death. Sikandar Lodi was on the throne of Delhi from 1488 to 1517 A. D. The last of the three dates does not harmonise with this, and so it must be given up. Rāmānanda, we have seen, is spoken of as having been born in 1298 A. D. and died in 1411 A. D. If Mr. Westcott&rsquo;s date for Kabīr&rsquo;s birth is true, Kabīr cannot have been a disciple of Rāmānanda. If that of Mr. Macauliffe is accepted, it is just possible that he should have so become, for at the time of Rāmānanda&rsquo;s death, Kabīr must have been thirteen years of age, and he is represented in one of the legends to have been but a boy when he was accepted as a disciple by the old sage. The date 1518 A. D. given by both the writers for his death may be accepted as correct. But if that of his birth given by Mr. Macauliffe is also accepted, we shall have to suppose that Kabīr lived for 119 years; Rāmānanda also according to the dates given in the last section lived for 113 years. Whether both of them lived. such long lives might well be questioned. But, until we have more evidence, the dates for Rāmānanda already noticed, and for Kabīr as given by Mr. Macauliffe may be provisionally accepted, and thus Kabīr might be considered to have really been a disciple of Rāmānanda, though of course, being a boy of thirteen, he could not have taken part in his master&rsquo;s disputations with Pandits. In Kabīr&rsquo;s works, however, so far as I have seen them, Rāmānanda&rsquo;s namedoes not occur, though the name Rāmaas that of the Supreme Being and also the relation of the individual soul with Rāma, as well as his refutation of the doctrine of God&rsquo;s being Videha or Nirguṇa, i. e., without attributes, must have been borrowed from Rāmānanda&rsquo;s doctrines, which again are based on Rāmānuja&rsquo;s system.</p>
<p>§ 58. We now give a translation of a few passages illustra tive of the teachings of Kabīr³.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>3.The edition consulted is that published with a commentary under the ordeft of Raghurajasimha, Maharaja of Rewab, in Saṁvat 1924.</p>
<p>First RamainĪ.¹</p>
<p>1.There was in the inside a substance called Jīva or individual soul; the Internal Light illuminated [it]. 2. And then followed. a woman of the name of &lsquo;desire&rsquo;; and she was called Gāyatrī. 3.That woman gave birth to three sons; Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Maheśa, 4. Then Brahmāasked the woman who was her husband and whose wife she was. 5. (She replied:) &ldquo;Thou and I, I and thou, and there is no third, Thou art my husband and I am thy wife.&rdquo; 6. The father and son had a common wife; and one mother has a two-fold character; there is no son who is good son and who will endeavour to recognise his father.</p>
<p><strong>Second Ramainī.</strong></p>
<p>1.In the light there was sound, which was a woman. 2. And of the woman were Hari, Brahmā and the enemy of the three cities (Śiva). 3.Then Brahmācreated an egg and divided it into fourteen regions. 4-6. Then Hari, Hara and Brahmā settled in three regions, and thus they arranged the whole Brāhmaṇḍa and the six philosophies and ninety-six heresies. Nobody then taught the Veda for his sustenance; and Turuk did not come for making circumcision. 7.The woman brought forth from her womb. children. They became distinct individuals and followed different courses of action. 8.Therefore I and thou are of one blood and. are one life. Distinctness arises from ignorance. 9. From one woman all sprang, and what knowledge is it that brought about distinctness between them? 13 (Sākhī). Kabīr proclaims: All this ordinary world is destructible; without knowing the name of Rāma all individuals are drowned in the ocean of existence.</p>
<p>Kabīr&rsquo;s account of creation seems to be this. In the light of Rāma there existed a substance which was the subtle element, the sum total of all individual souls. And then that substance was illuminated by that light. Then followed a desire in the shape of a woman, which was at the same time called Gāyatrīand sound. (Śabda), and from her the creation took its rise. His idea thus</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.Ramainī is a piece of composition consisting of several Caupāīs (Sk. Catuṣpadī), which are stanzas consisting of four lines with the ends of the first two and of the last two rhyming with each other, and a Sākhī(which is another species of metre) at the end.</p>
<p>seems to be that individual souls came into being, or were developed out of a substance which was their subtle form, at the will of the Supreme Soul, which (will) was uttered in the form of a sound. That is to say, the Supreme Soul was not the material cause of the world, but a distinct subtle entity. What, in the language of the Upanṣiads, became many was this entity and not the Supreme Soul himself. Kabīr&rsquo;s philosophy is thus not a monism, but. dualism. All individuals sprang into existence from the same cause, there was one blood and one life, and consequently the distinction of castes and races was a later fiction. Kabīr thus appears to be an opponent of this distinction.</p>
<p><strong>Fifth Rāmainī.</strong></p>
<p>The substance of the first five Caupāīs seems to be that Hari, Hara and Brahmā, taking the two letters (Rāma), laid the foundation of all learning, and gradually the Vedas and Kitābs (books) came to be composed. 6-8. In all the four ages the devotees devised systems, but were not aware that the bundle they had tied up was torn. Men ran in all directions for salvation, being afraid. Abandoning their lord they ran towards hell.</p>
<p>Eighth Ramainī.</p>
<p>1.The precept &ldquo;Tat tvam asi &quot; ( that thou art) is the message of the Upaniṣads. 2.They lay great stress upon it, and those who are qualified explain it (at great length). 3. Sanaka and Nārada became happy by regarding the highest principle to be distinct. from themselves, 4. The colloquy between Janaka and Yājn̄avalkya comes to the same effect, and that same sweet sentiment was tested by Dattātreya. 5.Vāsiṣṭha and Rāma sang together the same thing, and that same thing was explained to Uddhava. 6.That same thing was substantiated by Janaka, and though her had a body, he was called bodiless (Videha ). 7 (Sakhī). No mortal becomes immortal without abandoning the pride of birth. That which one cannot see by experience is to be considered as &ldquo;unseen&rdquo; or &ldquo;unperceived&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In this Ramainī Kabīr shows acquaintance with the Upanṣiads and other branches of Hiudu sacred literature, so that he cannot have been a mere &ldquo;Sūfi and Mahomedan&rdquo;. He rejects the theory of the identity between the Supreme and the individual souls,</p>
<p>which is regarded as being laid down in the expression &ldquo;That thou art of the Chāndogya Upanṣiad. The commentator says. that by &ldquo;that&rdquo; is to be understood the subtle body of sixteen parts and the expression means &ldquo;Thou art that subtle body&rdquo;. Kabīrtakes all the individuals he has named in this Ramainī to have preached duality.</p>
<p>In the fourteenth Ramainīthere is a condemnation of the several systems of religion-that contained in the Purāṇas, that of Brahmā, Haṁsa, Gopāla, Śaṁbhu, ghosts and goblins and various forms of worship upto the Nevaja of the Mahomedan.</p>
<p>Thirty-fourth Ramainī.</p>
<p>1.The Pandits were misled by the study of the Vedas which are based on the Guṇas, or qualities, and did not know their own nature and their true friend (God). 2.They practise Saṁdhyā, Tarpaṇa, the six rites and various other such ceremonies. 3. In all the four Yugas Gāyatrīhas been taught; ask who obtained salvation (Mukti) by its means. 4. When you are touched by other people, you bathe; tell me who is more degraded than yourselves. 5. You are very proud of your virtues. Too much pride is not good. 6.How can he whose name destroys all pride. bear this proud behaviour? 7.(Sākhī). Giving up the traditional mode of worship of the family, they seek the place of Nirvāṇa; having destroyed the seed and sprout, they became an entity without attributes (Videha or Nirguṇa).</p>
<p>Kabīr here condemns the rites, ceremonies and other practices of the Brāhmaṇas, the pride that is generated in them by these, the contempt in which they hold people of other castes, and also their search of Nirvāṇa, or a condition without any attributes, i. e., the Advaita, or adualistic, system which they follow.</p>
<p><strong>Fortieth Ramainī.</strong></p>
<p>1.The sea, which is a collection of waters, is a ditch, and in it are the sun, the moon, and the thirty-three crores of brothers. 2.In the whirlpools (of such a universe) they (men and gods) have seated themselves and desire happiness, but have not shunned the touch of misery. 3.Nobody knows the secret of misery, and the world has become mad in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>4.Everybody is a fool or a sage in himself and nobody knows Rāma who dwells in the heart. 5. (Sākhī). They themselves are Hari (God), they themselves are lords, they themselves are the slaves of Hari. When there is no guarantee, the lady (Mukti or salvation) goes away disappointed.</p>
<p>Here again there is a condemnation of various systems and of the self-confidence which has given rise to them and the neglect of God dwelling in the heart.</p>
<p>Sākhīs.</p>
<p>I.</p>
<ol start="31">
<li>The crowds went by the path traversed by the Pandits. Lofty is the ascent to Rāma. Kabīr has climbed it. 135. The whole world has gone astray by partiality for one&rsquo;s own system. He who, becoming free from partiality, adores Hari, is a wise sage. 138. The great ones are lost in their own greatness; pridel peers out through every pore; when they are not familiar with a wise preceptor, all the orders of men are of the Camãr caste, i. e., the degraded caste of curriers. 182. The Kali is a wicked age; the world is blind and nobody believes in the true word. He to whom a salutary advice is given, becomes an enemy. 211. Three things went to a holy place (the body, the fickle heart, and the mind which is a thief). They did not destroy a single sin, but on the contrary the mind contracted ten others. 260, The Kabīrs (men in general) polluted the path of Bhakti, or faith, by washing pebbles and stones. Keeping poison within, they have thrown out the nectar. 358. &ldquo;I am the author of the whole creation, there is no other who is superior to me.&rdquo; (This is what some people think). Kabīr says that, when one does not know what one is oneself, one thinks everything to be contained in oneself. 365. In this world all have passed away considering themselves to bei Rāma, but no one actually became Rāma. Kabīr says that those who know Rāma as he truly is, attain all their objects. 366. This world has become mad and has conceived a love for something which can be no matter of experience; and denying all authoritativeness to actual experience, they attach themselves to a soul without attributes (Videha). 372. Seeing a void, men were misled</li>
</ol>
<p>and went about searching in all quarters till they died, but did not find a form without attributes.</p>

<li>The bee loiters in the garden, being enticed by the innumerable flowers in it. In the same manner the individual soul loiters among the objects of sense and at the end goes away disappointed. 95. The soul is to the mind as a monkey is to a showman. Making it dance in a variety of ways, it (mind) finally retains it in its own hands. 96. The mind is fickle, a thief and perfect swindler. The gods and the sages fell off in consequence of the mind and mind finds a hundred thousand openings. 136. If a man gives up his belongings, it does not mean much. Egotism, or self-pride, cannot be given up. Self-pride, which led astray the great Munis, devours all. Running after gold and women, men are burnt by the passion generated by an illusion. Kabīr says, how can they be saved, being like cotton which has come in contact with fire? 147. All became subject to the power of illusion: Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Maheśa, and the four, Nārada, Śārada, Sanaks, and Gaṇeśa, the son of Gaurī. 209. Do not kill a poor living creature; the life of all is the same. You will not be free from (the sin of) killing, even if you hear crores of Purāṇas.</li>

If you. water the root of a tree, you will obtain a sufficiency of flowers. and fruits. 310.

<p>inspires him with the corresponding thoughts (calculated to enable him to achieve success).</p>
<p>Here the first group contains a condemnation of the current religious doctrines; the second gives a specimen of Kabīr&rsquo;s moral teachings, and the third explains the way in which God&rsquo;s graca operates towards the deliverance of man. Kabīr, therefore, was as much a constructive reformer as destructive. In Sākhī260 of the first group, Kabīr, it will be seen, condemns the worship of idols. The religion which he promulgated, therefore, was a pure spiritual theism. The mode of worship used by his followers up to the present day consists of prayers and praises only.</p>
<p>Kabīr founded a Pantha, or a sect, and the Maṭhas, or establishments of that sect exist in several parts of India. The principal one is at Benares, with a branch at Maghar in the Gorakhpur District, where he died. This last is said to be in the charge of a Mahomedan Mahant, or superior. The second was established by Dharmadās, his chief disciple, in the Chattisgarh District of the Central Provinces¹. The followers of Kabīr&rsquo;s sect are to be found principally among the lower castes, but the sage is highly venerated by all Vaiṣṇavas of whatever caste or class.</p>
<p><strong>XX. Other Rāmānandins.</strong></p>
<p>§ 59. Malukdās, who lived about the end of Akbar&rsquo;s reign, i. e, about the end of the sixteenth century, was a worshipper of Rāma. The tradition that he belonged to the school of Rāmānanda appears to be correct. Like Kabīr, he seems to have been a non-idolater, since in a hymn which I have seen, he ridicules men and women who hammer valuable metals into gods, worship them, and, whenever there is a necessity, sell them for the price of the metal, and says that the true way was shown to him by his wise. preceptor. The sect founded by him has seven Maṭhas, or establishments, and its adherents follow the occupation of householders.</p>
<p>Dādu was a cotton cleaner at Ahmedabad. At twelve he removed to Sambhar and finally settled at Naraina, about twenty Kośas from Jaipur. He flourished about 1600 A. D., at the end of Akbar&rsquo;s reign. His doctrines appear to be similar to those of Kabīr. The only mode of worship was Japa, or the repetition ofthe name of Rāma. The sect does not worship Images of Rāma and it erects no temples. Dādu inculcates faith in, and love of, Rāma and meditation on him. His followers His followers are divided into threa classes: (1) Viraktas, (2) Nāgas, and (3) Vistaradhārins. The firstlive the life of ascetics, the second are bearers of arms and enter into the service of princes as soldiers, and the third lead an ordinary life.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.For details, see Rev. G. H. Westcott&rsquo;s Volume on Kabīr referred to above.</p>
<p>Rāidās, a pupil of Rāmānanda, was a founder of a sect the followers of which are to be found in the caste of Camārs. or leather-workers. Nābhājīin his Bhaktamālātolls many legends. about him. Under the name of Rohidās he is known and revered even in the Maratha country, and Mahīpati, the Maratha writer on saints, devotes a chapter to him.</p>
<p>Senāthe barber, a follower of Rāmānanda, is also reported to have founded a sect. He too is known in the Maratha country<sup id="fnref1:60"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">60</a></sup>.</p>
<p>XXI. Tulasīdās.</p>
<p>§ 60. Another person who contributed to the propagation of the cult of Rāmaover Northern Indis, was the famous Tulasīdās, whom we will now briefly notice. Tulasīdās belonged to the Saravaryāor Sarayūparīṇa caste of Brāhmaṇas and was born in Saṁvat 1589, corresponding to 1532 A. D., under an inauspicious constellation. He was abandoned by his parents and was picked. up by a Sādhu, or a pious man, in whose company he visited many places in India. His father&rsquo;s name was Ātmārāma Śukla Dūbe, his mother&rsquo;s Hulasī, and his own Rāma Bōta. His father-in-law was a man of the name of Dīnabandhu Pāṭhaka, and hist wife was called RatnāvalīHis son&rsquo;s name was Tāraka.</p>
<p>Tulasīdās commenced the composition of his great work, Rāmacaritamānasa, usually known as Rāmāyaṇa, at Ayodhyāin 1574 A. D., and finished it at Benares. He wrote eleven other works, six of which were smaller. Tulasīdās was not a sturdy reformer like Kabīr and does not seem to have founded a sect or even to have promulgated a definite Vedāntic theory. In this respect he appears to have been, like a host of other persons who flourished in the country, a teacher of the Bhaktimārga, or the path of devotion, which is based upon a dualistic philosophy with a leaning towards spiritual monism of the Advaita system. Tulasīdās died in 1623 A. D.¹</p>
<p>§ 61. I will now give a short specimen of Tulasīdās&rsquo; teachings. from his Rāma-Satasaī, the composition of which, as stated in Dohā 21 of the first chapter, was commenced on Thursday, the ninth of the bright half of Vaiśākha, Saṁvat 1642 = 1585 A. D.</p>
<p>Chapter I.</p>
<p>(Dohā 3) The highest soul, the highest excellent place, than whom or which there is no other, Tulasī understands and hears to be Rāma, the blessed. (Dohā4) &ldquo;Rāma whose attributes confer blessings upon all is himself free from all desires. He fulfils all desires, is the benefactor of all. The sages assert this.&quot;—So says! Tulasī. (Dohā 15) Tulasī sees plainly that in every pore of Rāma there is an endless universe. He is pure, is unchangeable and is irresistible. (Dohā 6) The blessed Jānakīis the mother of the world, and Rāma the father. Both are beneficent. Their grace destroys sin, and creates conscience (confers the knowledge of distinguishing good from evil). (Dohā 44) Where there is Rāma, there is no [evil] desire; where there is [evil] desire, there is no Rāma. Oh Tulasī !the sun and the night do not exist in one place. (Dohā 45) When Rāma is afar, Māyā(illusion or temptation) is strong. When he is known, it becomes tiny or thin. When the sun is at a distance, the shadow is long; when ho is on the head, it is below the feet. (Dohā 48) Says Tulasī : &ldquo;If there is no love for Rāma, all learning is thrown into an oven and Yama takes away knowledge and devours it; everything burns away and the very root is destroyed&rdquo;. (Dohā 57) All things by which a man is surrounded, serve as hindrances, and none proves a help (towards the way of bliss); and, in such circumstances, if the end is good, it can become so only through Rāma&rsquo;s grace.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter II</strong></p>
<p>(Dohā 17) Says Tulsī : &ldquo;Through the disobedience of God, man brings evil on himself and all his associates. The king ofthe Kurus, while governing his kingdom, was reduced to dust along with his army and family&rdquo;. (Doha 18) Says Tulasī: &ldquo;From sweet words results good on all sides. This is a spell that. overcomes everything; avoid all harsh words&rdquo;. (Doha 19) &ldquo;A man attains happiness by the grace of Rāma, and it escapes ono without it&rdquo;, says Tulasì, &ldquo;though they know this, bad men neglect to adore Rāma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.For details, see Dr. Grierson&rsquo;s articles in the Indian Antiquary, Vol. XXII.</p>
<p>Chapter IV.<sup id="fnref1:61"><a href="#fn:61" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">61</a></sup></p>
<p>82 (89 B. I). The excellent retentive faculty is called Girāor Sarasvatī, and the immutable Dharma is a Vaṭa tree. Dharma consists of a triad of confluent rivers destroying sin. Oh Tulasī, conceive no dislike for these and accept these.</p>
<p>The triad is given by the commentator as action, knowledge, and Bhakti, or devotion.</p>
<p>83 (90 B. I.). One becomes clean by bathing (in these three. confluent rivers), i. e., grasping the trind by the understanding. The dirt in the shape of immortality is washed off, and then there is no doubt as to the easy attainment of the place of Rama. 84 (91 B. I. ). Forgiveness is holy Vārānasī. Bhakti, or devotion, is like the river of gods (Gaṅgā) and clear knowledge is like Višvešvara. These together with compassion, which is power Pārvatī), shine.</p>
<p>The commentator remarks that just as Benares with the other. three brings about deliverance, so do forgiveness, devotion, knowledge, and compassion.</p>
<p>85 (92 B. I.). Vārānasīis not far from him whose heart dwells in the house which is Kṣamā(forgiveness)—Vārānasī, in which shines, oh Tulasīthe celestial river in the shape of Bhakti, which results in numerous virtuous deeds. 86 (93 B. L.). Kāsīis the bright half of a month and Magaha, or Magadha, is the dark half in which dwell covetousness, infatuation, intoxication, and lust. Oh Tulasīconsidering which is beneficial and which is injurious, do [choose where to] reside during all the watches of the day.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>The editions consulted are those published by Navalkisora at Lakhnau in 1886 and in the Bibliotheco Indica in 1897.</p>
<p>Kāśīis associated with the four virtues mentioned above, and Magadha with the vices noticed here. So one is told to practise what is beneficial and to avoid what is injurious.</p>
<p>87 (94 B. I.). What has gone away will not come again. Therefore do acquire knowledge. The same thing that you have today you will have tomorrow; therefore, oh Tulasī ! give up all infatuation.</p>
<p>The idea seems to be : Do not waste time by procrastination; begin your devotions at once.</p>
<p>88 (95 B. I.). The past and the future hang together on the present. Oh Tulasīdo not entertain any doubt, get through that which is before you at present.</p>
<p>89 (96 B. I.). A good soul is like the Mānasa (lake), and in it is the pure water of the sweet glory of Rāma. Sin is washed off and the heart becomes pure (by bathing in that water); and this calm water is not inaccesible to the wise.</p>
<p>The idea seems to be that in a good soul a taste for devotion to Rāma springs up, and when it is cultivated, the soul become pure.</p>
<p>From these extracts it will be seen that according to Tulasīdās Rāma is the supreme God, and that through his grace man becomes holy and blessed. He should, therefore, be adored; where he is, sin is not, and therefore, for the purification of the mind, he should always be thought of and meditated on. The ways to God usually followed are, he says, inefficacious and as such may be thrown into the fire.</p>
<p>XXII. Vallabha.</p>
<p>§ 62. We will now turn our attention to the more extensive and almost exclusive cult of the Kṛṣṇa of Gokula. The founder of it was Vallabha. He was the son of a Tailaṅga Brāhmaṇa named Lakṣmaṇa Bhaṭṭa, who was a student of the Black Yajurveda and lived at a village named Kānkarava in the Telugu country. On one occasion Lakṣmaṇa Bhaṭṭa went on a pilgrimage to Benares. with his wife, Elamāgāra. On the way she gave birth to a son on the eleventh of the dark half of Vaiśākha of the Vikrama year</p>
<p>1535, corresponding to 1479 A.D.<sup id="fnref1:62"><a href="#fn:62" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">62</a></sup> That son was known as Vallabha.</p>
<p>Vallabha lived for some time in Vṛndāvana and for some time. at Mathurā. About that time it is alleged that Gopāla-Krṣṇa manifested himself on the Govardhana Hill by the name of Devadamana, called also Śrī-Nāthajī. The God told Vallabha in at dream to come and see him, informing him that his companions in the cow-settlement, when he became incarnate as Krṣṇa, were born again in the present age, and commissioned him to make. them his attendants, that he might sport with them as in the former age. Accordingly, Vallabha went and saw Devadamana or Śrī-Nāthajī. Śrī-Nāthajī commanded him to erect a shrine for himself and to promulgate the method of worshipping him, without which a man would not be admissible to the Puṣṭimārga, or the path of divine grace, which Vallabha had founded. The meaning of this seems to be that Vallabha connected his system with a special manifestation of Krṣṇa known by the name of Śrī-Nāthajī².</p>
<p>Vallabha&rsquo;s Vedāntic theory is the same as that of an earlier. author of the name of Viṣṇusvāmin. This Viṣṇusvāmin is said. to have been the son of the councillor of a Draviḍa chief dependent upon the Emperor of Delhi<sup id="fnref1:63"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">63</a></sup>. Nābhājīin his Bhaktamālāmakes Jñānadeva, Nāmdeva, Trilocana, and lastly Vallabha his successors⁴. The first was Jñānadeva, who is represented as a follower of his system (Saṁpradāya). He was one of three sons born to a man, who became a householder after he had assumed the order of an ascetic. He was, therefore, excommunicated and was not allowed to learn the Vedas. But he himself by his miraculous. power made a male buffalo repeat the Vedas. This story is the same as that related of the Jñānadeva of Mahārāṣṭra, the author of a Vernacular commentary on the Bhagavadgita. But the Marathas do not know of Viṣṇusvāmin as his Guru, or teacher,or of Jñānadevabeing his successor or follower. If, however, the tradition reported by Nābhājīis correct, Viṣṇusvāmin must have lived about the middle of the thirteenth century. The date of the commentary above alluded to is śaka 1212, corresponding to 1290 A. D.</p>

<p>The Vedāntic theory of Viṣṇusvāmin which is the same as that of Vallabha is as follows. The one primeval soul was not joyful, because he was alone (BU. I. 4. 3), and, desiring to be many, he himself became the inanimate world, the individual soul, and the inward controlling soul. These sprang from him like sparks from a burning fire and are his parts (MU. II. 1). By his own inscrutable power he rendered the properties of intelligence and joy imperceptible in the first, and his joy alone in the second, while the third has all the attributes perceptible in it. Simple Brahman as such has perceptible joy prevailing in it¹.</p>
<p>§ 63. The following particulars have been gleaned from two works belonging to Vallabhācārya&rsquo;s sect². The whole world hasBrahman for its material cause. The perception of forms. apparently different from the Brahman is due to ignorance or delusion and to the true nature of Brahman being rendered imperceptible. The individual soul is identical with Brahman, a part of Brahman and atomic. From the Akṣara composed of existence, intelligence, and joy (Saccidānanda) particles come out as sparks from fire. From the predominance of the Sat portion in them the joy portion is concealed, and thus we have the indivi dual souls possessing Sat, existence, and Cit, intelligence. The individual soul is not a form of the Supreme Soul altered by a third thing being involved in it, such as the Māyā (illusive power), but is itself the same substance as the Supreme Soul with one attribute rendered imperceptible. The relation between the two is thus that of identity (Advaita), both being in the pristine unchanged form, i. e., identity of untransformed souls (Śuddhādvaita).</p>
<p>The individual soul is of two kinds: (1) going through the circle</p>

<p>2.Śuddhādvaitamārtaṇḍa y Giridhara, and Prameyaratnārṇva by Bālakṛṣṇa Bhaṭṭa ,Chowkh. Series.</p>
<p>of existences, and (2) delivered from the trammels of life. The first is subject to misery in consequence of his delusion that his body and senses are his soul. He remains in this condition till he acquires knowledge, sees the vanity of the world and devotes himself to meditation and the love of God, when he is delivered. The delivered souls are: (1) those who have become so while in their previous condition, by the termination of ignorance or delusion, such as Sanaka and others; and (2) those who dwell in the world of the Bhagavat, other than the pervading Vaikuṇṭha¹, where they attain the condition of pure Brahman by the favour of the Bhagavat; (3) there are others, who, having the divine nature in them, and coming in contact with good men, resort to various ways of Bhakti, or the propitiation of God, until perfect love alone for Him comes to dwell in their heart, and finally become the associates of the Bhagavat in His eternal sports and amusements. This last is the Mokṣa, or deliverance.</p>
<p>That class of worldly souls who have no divine nature in them, and in whom evil predominates, are ever moving in the circle of existences. The souls who have the divine nature in them are of two kinds: (1) those who subject themselves to certain moral. discipline (Maryādājīva), and (2) those who depend entirely on God&rsquo;s grace (Puṣṭjīva). Both attain final deliverance, but there is a difference which corresponds to that between (2) and (3) above and which will be further explained below.</p>
<p>Śrī-Kṛṣṇa is the highest Brahman. He has hands and feet not made up of ordinary matter (Aprākṛta), but celestial. His body consists of Sat, existence; Cit, intelligence; Ānanda, joy. He is called Puruṣottama, as the most excellent of all beings, and has all attributes which are not ordinary, but celestial. All his sports</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.I translate the word Vyāpi-Vaikuṇṭha thus. The Vyāpi-Vaikuṇṭha above the Vaikuṇṭha of Viṣṇu, the protector of the world. There dwells. Puruṣottama, who manifests himself variously to his various devotees. To those in whom Bhakti has risen to the highest pitch and has become baunting passion be manifests himself as the sportive. Krṣṇa. In a portion of the Vyāpi-Vaikuṇṭha there is the Goloka with Vṛndāvana in which there are extensive trees, bowers of croopers, and the river Yamunā. The highest Bhaktas are transferred to this Vṛndāvana, and Krṣṇa sports with them there.</p>
<p>are eternal. He, with his four arms or two arms, sports with his various devotees, or Bhaktas, in the extensive Vaikuṇṭha, which contains Vṛndāvana with its large forests. Krṣṇa is, therefore. the hight joy (Paramānanda). By his will, his Sattva portion overcomes the Ānanda or joy portion, and, becoming Akṣara, or unchangeable, he is the cause of all causes and creates the world. Then Akṣarabrahman is of two kinds: (1) that which is recognised by the devotees as the place of Puruṣottama, which has the attributes of the extensive Vaikuṇṭha and others; (2) to the enlightened it appears in the form of existence, intelligence and joy, infinite in time and space, self-manifesting and devoid of all qualities Therefore, in the form in which the enlightened see it, all the positive qualities are hidden or rendered imperceptible by the inscrutable power referred to above, and therefore they are not to be regarded as non-existing. When Brahman is spoken of as devoid of all qualities, what is meant is just this. There are thus. three forms of the Supreme Being, Puruṣottama and the two kinds of the Unchangeable here mentioned.</p>
<p>To explain the controlling of all by Puruṣottama, that form of his that dwells in the sun, the gods, the earth, etc., is called Antaryāmin (the inward controller). It is this inward controller that becomes incarnate in the various forms usually mentioned. The celestial Sattva quatity of Krṣṇa becomes Viṣṇu, and in this form he becomes the protector of all. Similarly the qualities of Rajas and Tamas assume the forms of Brahmadeva and Siva for discharging the functions of creation and destruction.</p>
<p>Puṣṭi is the grace (Anugraha) of God which is to be inferred from its fruit or the results, which are ordinary, or of this world, and extraordinary, or of the next world. Mahāpuṣṭi, or the highest grace, is that which removes great obstacles and conduces: to the attainment of God himself. Puṣṭi enables one to attain the four objects of life. Extraordinary, or special Pusti, conduces to Bhakti, which leads to the attainment of God. The Bhakti, or devotion generated by this special grace, is called Puṣṭibhakti The frame of mind generated by this kind of devotion is the desire of the attainment of God to the exclusion of everything else.</p>
<p>This Puṣṭibhakti is of four kinds: (1) Pravāha-Puṣṭibbakti,</p>
<p>(2) Maryādā-Puṣṭibhakti, (3) Puṣṭi-Puṣṭibhakti, (4) Śuddha-Puṣṭibhakti. The first is the path of those who, while engaged in a worldly life with its me and mine, which is compared to a stream (Pravāha), do acts calculated to bring about the attainment of God. The second is of those who, withdrawing their minds from worldly enjoyments, devote themselves to God by hearing discourses about him, singing his name, and such other processes. The third is of those who already enjoying God&rsquo;s grace are made by another grace competent to acquire knowledge useful for adoration; and thus they come to know all about the ways of God. The followers of this path have to depend on their own efforts for the acquisition of knowledge referred to. The fourth is of those who through mere love devote themselves to the singing and praising of God as if it were a haunting passion. This Bhakti is generated by God himself and does not depend upon man&rsquo;s will as the third, mentioned above, does. First a liking for Himself is generated by God in the mind of a man to whom his grace extends. Then a man sets about acquiring knowledge about God, and all this is called Premabhakti (love-adoration). Now the stages in the development of this are as follows: (1) love or liking (Preman), (2) attachment or addictedness (Āsakti), (3) a haunting passion, which is the mature condition of the first two (Vyasana).</p>
<p>The haunting passion leads to attainment of the end, that is, the highest bliss. Those in whom Bhakti has attained to this pitch reject with scorn the four kinds of Mukti and choose the eternal service of Hari, as noticed in the section on the Pāñcarātra system. By the haunting passion about Hari he is seen everywhere, and therefore everything becomes an object of love, and the devotee identifies himself with everything. Then the inner and the outer world is, for the devotee, full of Puruṣottama, or the highest soul.</p>
<p>The final fruit of this devotion is admission to the eternal sports of Krṣṇa. The Bhaktas join in these sports, assuming the forms of cows, beasts, birds, trees, rivers, etc., and enjoy the company of Puruṣottama, which confers boundless joy. These eternal sports are like those which Krṣṇa went through when he</p>
<p>became incarnate in Vraja and Vṛndāvana. Some of the devoteer become, in the celestial Vrndāvana, Gopas and Gopīs and join is the sports. The Maryādābhaktas attain Mukti called Sāyujya which consists in being one with Hari. The Puṣṭibhaktas reject it with scorn and seek for participation in the sports of Hari.</p>
<p>§ 64. These are the doctrines of the school of Vallabha. will now proceed to give a short description of the practical modes of worship. Vallabha had a son named Viṭṭhaleśa, and they are spoken of respectively as Ācārya and Gosāīṁor Gosvāmin. The latter had seven sons of the names of Giridhara Govindarāya, Bālakṛṣṇa, Gokulanātha, Raghunātha, Yadunātha, and Ghanaśyāma. The Gurus of this sect ordinarily called Mahārājas are descendants of these seven. Each Guru has a temple of his own, and there are no public places of worship. The devotee should visit the temple of his Guru at stated intervals, which are eight in number during the day. The mode of worship is as follows.</p>
<p>The conductor of the worship should rise early in the morning, utter the name of Bhagavat and rinse his mouth and drink a little of the washings of the feet [of Bhagavat], and, with his face to the north or the east, should utter the name of the Ācārya and pray to him and make a bow. The same should be done to Viṭṭhaleśa and the names of his seven sons should be uttered, as well as of one&rsquo;s own Guru, and then a bow should be made to Kṛṣṇa after uttering the names Govardhana and others. Then the river Yamunāshould be remembered and bowed to, and six stanzas of a poem called Bhramaragītā should be repeated; and then the Gopīs, or cowherdesses, should be adored.</p>
<p>After this the worshipper should answer the call of nature, wash his hands, feet and face, and then drink a portion of the washings of the feet of Krṣṇa, and eat the residue of the betel leaves supposed to be eaten by Krṣṇa. Then he should besmear his body with oil and bathe. After bathing he should drink in a little water, after repeating the name of Nārāyaṇa. Then he should make a perpendicular mark on his forehead with white earth, the mark of a lotus on the bosom and of a bamboo leaf on the arms, etc., twelve in all, to represent the twelve</p>
<p>forms of Viṣṇu, Keśava, Nārāyaṇa, Mādhava, etc. He should then print the forms of the various weapons of Viṣṇu on his body, and then, saluting Vallabhācārya, should adore Krṣṇa with the Gopīs. Heshould then open the door of the temple, and going into the sleeping apartments, bring out the wreaths of flowers and all other things used on the previous day, and then sweep and clean the apartments. He should then brush the throne and make all the arrangements necessary for the reception of Krṣṇa awakened from sleep.</p>
<p>He should then approach the bed-room and sing a song calling upon Krṣṇa to rise from sleep, to take the refreshments prepared for him and to go with his companions to the forest for grazing. the cows. Krṣṇa should be brought out and placed on the throne. Rādhāshould be placed to his left hand, and then the worshipper should prostrate himself before her. The refreshments already prepared should then be placed before them, and they should be requested to eat them. Then the bed should be dusted and cleaned and then Krṣṇa should be made to wash his mouth. Other refreshments should be then placed before the two. And at the end of all an Āratī, or waving of lamps, should be gone through with a song. Vallabhācārya should then be saluted.</p>
<p>Then comes the bath of Krṣṇa. After bathing saffron paint should be applied. Then he should be dressed and milk given to him. Afterwards by the churning of milk, froth should be prepared and offered to Krṣṇa. He should be then told to wash his mouth. with water. Then betel leaves should be offered to him. Then a cradle should be adorned and Krṣṇa should he told to get into. it, and then it should be rocked and toys should be got ready for the divine boy.</p>
<p>Afterwards the mid-day dinner should be prepared. A Caukā, or a small four-legged table, should be placed before him and viands of all kinds in cups should be put on the table. The lord should then be told to eat them. A little rice should be placed in a small plate and, mixed with ghee, five or seven mouthfuls. should be held before him. Then lamps should be waved about him. Subsequently all the other dishes should be offered. In this manner the ceremonies go on. A meal is again prepared</p>
<p>at night and Krṣṇa is laid on the sleeping cot and made to sleep again.</p>
<p>Thus the order of the ceremonies is as follows: (1) the ringing of the bell; (2) the blowing of the conoh-shell, (3) awakening of the Lord (Thākurji) and offering morning refreshments, (4) waving of lamps, (5) bathing, (6) dressing, (7) Gopīvallabha food, (8) leading the cows out for grazing, (9) the mid-day dinner, (10) waving of lamps; (11) after the last, the screen is drawn up and the God cannot be seen; this interval is called Anosara or Anavasara,-i. e., no time for seeing him,-(12) the finishing up, (13) the evening meal, (14) going to bed.</p>
<p>Besides the ordinary worship detailed above, the followers of this sect hold a number of feasts and festivals, some of which are in honour of Vallabhācārya, his son and seven grandsons. The influence exercised by Vallabha and his successors over their adherents seems to have been immense, and this has come down to their descendants or existing Gurus of the sect also. This is kept up by the fact that the God cannot be worshipped independently in a public place of worship, but in the house and temple of the Guru or the Maharaja, which therefore has to be regularly visited by the devotees with offerings. The followers of this system consist principally of the trading classes of Gujarāt, Rājputāna and further to the north about Mathura. The principal doctrine which these latter are taught is that all their belongings should be dedicated to their Guru; and this doctrine is not seldom carried to an extreme.</p>
<p>Among the different kinds of Bhakti mentioned above there is only one which contemplates non-attachment to worldly objects. The highest Bhakti as well as the others are generated in the heart of man by the grace of God, and the first even ripens into a haunting passion. This grace of God one may enjoy even while engaged in a worldly life. The Maryādā-Puṣṭi, which is one of the four forms and requires the restraint of passions, does not conduce to the attainment of the highest bliss, which consists in joining in the eternal sports of Hari in the Goloka. The spirit of this system, therefore, sooms to be sportive enjoyments and it connot but be expected to influence the ordinary life of its</p>
<p>followers. Moral rigidity oulminating in indifference to worldly enjoyments and self-abnegation does not appear to be a characteristicof this school. Vallabhācārya himself was a married man, and so were all his successors and so are all the Gurus of the seot, who are as much men of the world as their followers.</p>
<p>§65. From the account we have given, it will be seen that the fourth element of Vaiṣṇavism, that we have described in a preceding section, alone constitutes the religion of Vallabha. The sportive boy Krṣṇa of the cow-settlement with all his pranks is the highest god of this school, and his mistress Rādhā, who is mentioned only in the later books and dignified into his eternal consort, as will be mentioned further on, is the object of the deepest adoration. This sportive Krṣṇa with his Rādhā is transferred to a heaven which is in a region higher than the ordinary Vaikuṇṭha of Nārāyaṇa or Viṣṇu, and is called Goloka. The highest aim of man&rsquo;s life is to get to this place and join in the sports Thus the doings of Krṣṇa in Gokula, and his relations. with the men and women as well as the inferior animals, trees, and even the river Yamunā, constitute the basis of Vallabha&rsquo;s system and also its goal when transferred to Goloka.</p>
<p>XXIII. Caitanya.</p>
<p>§ 66. About the same time as Vallabha, there flourished in Bengal another propagator of the religion of Rādhā and Krṣṇa , who is known by the name of Caitanya. The prominent distinction between the two appears to be, that while Vallabha and those who followed him developed the ceremonial side of the religion, Caitanya and his successors devoted themselves to the cultivation of the emotional side, Caitanya endeavoured to win the hearts of man, by instituting Kirtanas or the fervent singing of songs about the love of Rādhā and Krṣṇa and other devotional matters. The love of the cow-herd god and his mistress. had already become the subject of bewitching songs by Jayadeva in Sanskrit and by other poets in the Vernacular.</p>
<p>Caitanya also was a more courageous reformer in so far as he cried down the mechanical religious ceremonial of the prevalent Hinduism, and preached spiritual devotion and at the same time condemned the distinctions of onstes, and admitted all, including even Mahomedans, as his pupils.</p>
<p>§ 67. Caitanya&rsquo;s original name was Bisambhar (Viśvaṁbhara) Miśra, and his father&rsquo;s name was Jagannātha Miśra and mother&rsquo;s SacīDebī. The father lived originally in Sylhet in Eastern Bengal, but had emigrated to Nadiya (Nabadvīpa) before the birth of Bisambhar, his youngest son. The eldest son&rsquo;s name was Bisvarūpa, who is called Nityānanda in the history of Caitanya. These were the only two sons of Jagannātha, and between these were eight daughters, who died young.</p>
<p>Caitanya was born on the full-moon day of Phālguna in the year 1407 of the Śaka era, corresponding to 1485 A. D. He was afterwards called KrṣṇaCaitanya and was considered by his disciples an incarnation of Krṣṇa himself. As such he is reported to have played pranks with the women of the village, which, however, cannot be considered as historically true. Caitanya is also known by the name of Gaurāṅga, i. e., possessed of a fair and not a dark body, and Gauracandra, or a fair moon. When he was eighteen years of age, he married a wife of the name of LachmīDebīand began to live the life of a householder, taking pupils and giving them secular instruction. Soon after he took. to a wandering life and visited many places in Eastern Bengal. Begging and singing were his occupation, and he is said to have. collected a great deal of money. During his peregrinations his wife died, and on his return home he married another. When he was about twenty-three years of age, he went to Gayāto make offerings to his manes and on his return he began the mission of his life. He condemned the ritualistic system of the Brāhmaṇas and proached faith in Hari and the love of Him as well as singing His name as the only effectual ways to salvation. He also preached the doctrine of the brotherhood of men, denouncing the system of castes.</p>
<p>It is stated that the doctrine of faith and love had been preached before Caitanya by a person of the name Advaitācārys, whose practice it was, after the performance of the usual Brahmanic rites, to go to the banks of the Ganges and call out for the appearance of God to substitute the doctrine of faith and love for</p>
<p>that of the performance of various rites. It is also said that this. Ācārya was at first the instructor of Caitanya and afterwards. became his pupil. Whatever it may have been, the new doctrine was first publicly proclaimed to the exclusion of others. by Kṛṣṇa Caitanya.He was assisted by his brother Nityānanda, who was regarded as an incarnation of Balarāma, the brother of the god Kṛṣṇa.</p>
<p>Caitanya now began to hold meetings for the singing and glorification of the name of Hari. These were at first private. and held in the house of a pupil named Srībāsa. The doings of these devotees met with scorn and ridicule, especially at the hands of the worshippers of Kālī, one of whom put red flowers. and goat&rsquo;s blood on the steps of the door of the house in which the Vaiṣṇva meetings were held. The fervour displayed at these Kīrtanas, or singing of the name of Hari, gradually increased in intensity, until the loud singers, and principally Caitanya himself, swooned away and dropped senseless on the ground.</p>
<p>In the year 1510 Caitanya became a Saṁnyāsin, or an ascetic, and was initiated into the order by Keśab Bhāratīof Katva. After this he first went to Purīto visit the shrine of Jagannātha, and thence wandered about the country for six years preaching his new faith¹. On one occasion he went to Benares, where he is reported to have held a disputation with Prakāśānanda,a teacher of the monistic Vedānta of Śaṁkarācārya. Caitanya condemned Śaṁkara&rsquo;s commentary on the Vedāntasūtra and said that it mystified the sense of the original. Śaṁkarācārya did not give the plain ordinary sense of the words of Bādarāyaṇa but forced his own views into them. The doctrine of development (Pariṇāmavāda) was held by the author of the Sūtras, whileŚaṁkarācārya rejects it and brings in his doctrine of illusion. (Vivartavāda). The former alone is true according to Caitanya. After these wanderings he returned to Purī, where he spent the last eighteen years of his life, and died in Śaka1455, corresponding to 1533 A. D.</p>
<p>§ 68. Some of the doctrines attributed to Caitanya are as</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.The above is no abstract of the account given by J. Beames in his paper published in Ind. Ant. Vol. II, pp. 1 ff.</p>
<p>follows. Kṛṣṇa is the highest god and is so beautiful that he excites love for himself even in the heart of the God of love, and is enamoured of himself. His Parabrahmaśakti (power) pervades the universe and assumes a corporeal form by his wondercreating power (Māyāśakti), though he is the soul of all. He possesses a self-multiplying power (Vilāsaśakti) which is of two kinds. By one of these, in sporting with the cowherdesses, he bocame as many Krṣṇas as were sufficient to give one to every two of them (Prābhavavilāsa ). By the other self-multiplying power (Vaibhavavilāsa) he assumes the forms of the four Vyūhas, or forms of Vāsudeva, Samkarsaṇa, etc., Vāsudeva representing intelligence, SSaṁkarṣaṇa, consciousness, Pradyumna, the love, and Aniruddha, sprotiveness.</p>
<p>Here, it will be seen, the functions of the four Vyūhas are changed, and the principle of love is attributed to Pradyumna, instead of that of the mind as in the older system, and that of sportiveness, instead of self-consciousness, which is transferred to Saṁkarṣaṇa, is attributed to Aniruddha. This change is in consonance with a system of which love and sport form the distin guishing characteristics. All the usual incarnations spring from one or other of the Vyūhas. According as the quality of Sattva, Rajas, or Tamas predominates, Krṣṇa becomes Viṣṇu, Brahmadeva, or Śiva, respectively.</p>
<p>The sports of Krṣṇa go on always, as the rising and setting. of the sun. His eternal sports are carried on in the Goloka, Krṣṇa has three powers: the internal which is intelligence, the external which generates appearances, and the differentiated which forms the Jīva, or individual soul. His chief power is that which creates dilatation of the heart, or joy. This appears to be the power of love. When this love becomes settled in the heart of the devoteo, it constitutes Mahābhāva, or the best feeling. When love attains to the highest pitch, it constitutes itself into Rādhā, who is the most loveable of all and full of all qualities. She was the object of the highest love of Krṣṇa, and being idealised as love, some of the agreeable feelings of the heart are considered her ornaments. The sports of the cowherdesses were due to simple love (Preman), and this it was that Uddhava and other devotees sought to attain.</p>
<p>The Supreme Soul (Paramātman) is boundless and is full intelligence itself. The individual soul is an atom having nintelligence. They are necessarily connected together and this connection can never be destroyed. Kṛṣṇa is the support (Āśraya) and Jīva resta on him (Āśrita ). The relation between the two is identity as well as difference. Thus the Vedāntic theory of Caitanya&rsquo;s system is the same as that of Nimbārka. As the beet is distinct from the honey and hovers about it, and, when it drinks it, is full of it, i. e., is one with it, so the individual soul is at first distinct from the Supreme Soul, seeks the Supreme Soul consistently and continuously, and, when through love he is full of the Supreme Soul, he becomes unconscious of his individual. existence, and becomes, as it were, absorbed in him. Herein is. described the ecstatic condition in which the individual soul becomes one with God, though they are really distinct. Kṛṣṇa is the lord of the power of delusion or ignorance (Māyā), and Jīva is the slave of it. When the latter cuts off its shackles, he dis- tinctly sees his own nature and his true relation to God. Kṛṣṇa is to be approached and attained by Bhakti alone¹.</p>
<p>§ 69. Kṛṣṇa Caitanya, Nityānanda and Advaitānanda are called the three Prabhus, or masters of the sect. The descendants. of Nityānanda live at Nadiya, and those of Advaita at Śāntipur. They are the spiritual heads of the sect. Nityānanda was appointed by Caitanya himself as the superior of the church. His female descendants live at Bālegor, and male ones at Khordunear Barrackpur. There are temples belonging to Caitanya&rsquo;s followers at Māthurā, Vṛndāvana, and three principal ones in Bengal one at Nadiya dedicated to Caitanya, the other at Ambikā, to Nityānanda, and the third at Agradvipa, to Gopinātha. There is a shrine dedicated to Caitanya in the vicinity of Dhākādakṣiṇa in Northern Sylhet, where his father originally lived. It is visited by pilgrims from all parts of the district and even from Bengal. At Khetur, in the Rajaṣāhi district, a temple is erected in his honour, where a religious fair is held in the month of October, which is attended by about 25,000 persons.</p>

<p>The sectarian marks worn by the followers of Caitanya ara two white perpendicular lines on the forehead joined together at the bridge of the nose and a line continued up to the tip of the nose. They also use necklaces of three strings of Tulast berds and a rosary of the same, as a help in the muttering of Hari&rsquo;s The worship of Gurus, or spiritual heads, as gods characterises this system. Most of Advaita&rsquo;s followers observe caste distinctions, but a minority consists of Bairāgis, or recluses In one branch of the sect there are monks as well as nuns. They live in the same convent. And there is only And there is only a platonic relation between them.</p>
<p>A person of the name of Rām Saram Pāl of the Sadgopa caste founded about two hundred years ago a branch of the sect called Kartābhājas, or worshippers of the Kartā, or headman. It admits of recruits from all castes and observes no distinction. The founder, also called Kartā Bābā, died at Ghoṣapur, and his votaries assemble periodically to do honour to him. The spiritual teachers of Caitanya&rsquo;s sect, whether male or female, are celibates.</p>
<p>The three Prabhus, or masters, did not leave any compositions. But Caitanya&rsquo;s pupils, especially Rūpa and Sanātana, wrote s great deal. A work by the latter entitled Rasāmṛtasindhu contains an analysis of the feeling of love, or Bhakti, explaining the states of mind which lead to it and its various forms. A considerable body of literature has grown up round this system of religion.</p>
<p>XXIV. Debasement of Vaiṣṇavism.</p>
<ol start="70">
<li>The worship of Rādhā, more prominently even than that of Kṛṣṇa, has given rise to a sect, the members of which assume the garb of women with all their ordinary manners and affect to be subject even to their monthly sickness. Their appearance and acts are so disgusting that they do not show themselves very much in public, and their number is small. Their goal is the realisation of the position of female companions and attendants of Rādhā; and hence probably they assume the name of Sakhībhāvas (literally, the condition of companions). They deserve notice here only to show that, when the female element is idolised and made the object of special worship, such disgusting corruptions must ensue. The worship of Durgāin the form of Tripurasundarī has led to the same result.</li>
</ol>
<p>Though the Vaiṣṇava systems of Nimbārka, Vallabha and Caitanys are based on the fourth element of Vaiṣṇavism that wer have pointed out in a precoding Section, still that element has undergone an important modification. Before, Kṛṣṇa was a person who had amorous dalliances with the Gopīs generally. But now Kṛṣṇa had a definite consort in Rādhā, who had a large number of female companions, who were probably the original Gopīs. She is indissolubly united with him in the creed of worshippers.</p>
<p>This Rādhā is not mentioned by name in the Harivaṁśa, Viṣṇu-Purāṇa and the Bhāgavata. In the last, however, among the cowherdesses engaged in Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s amorous sports in Vṛndāvana on an autumnal moonlight night, there was one with whom the youthful god carred on his dalliance further, after he had become invisible to the rest. This woman became proud of Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s special attachment for her, whereupon the god disappeared from her also. Here was contained a suggestion which probably led to the creation of Rādhāin later times. In the apocryphal Nāradapañcaāátra-Saṁhitā, as mentioned before<sup id="fnref1:64"><a href="#fn:64" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">64</a></sup>, the one single lord is represented to have become two, one a woman and the other a man, who was he himself. He then bad amorous intercourse with her. The woman was Rādhā. In the Brahmavaivarta-Purāṇa she has been made to spring from the primordial body of Kṛṣṇa forming its left. side, and is eternally associated with him in his amorous sports in this world as well as the world of cows (Goloka). The name of Rukmiṇi occurs in the ordinary form of Kṛṣṇaism, but in the systems named above it is entirely absent. The introduction of Rādhā&rsquo;s name, and her elevation to a higher position even than Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s, operated as a degrading element in Vaiṣṇavism, not only because she was a woman, but also because she was originally a mistress of the cowhard god, and her amorous dealing were of an overt character.</p>
<p>In the Rāma cultus, Sītāis a dutiful and loving wife, and is</p>
<p>benignant towards the devotees of her husband. She holds a postition entirely subordinate to Rāma, while Rādhāis often preferredto Kṛṣṇa. There is no amorous suggestion in her story as in that of Rādhā, and consequently the moral influence of Rāmaism is more wholesome. Kabīr does not, so far as I know, mention the name of Sītāat all. He was a strict monotheist, and his Rāma was the supreme lord (Sāheb) only. Those other teachers who followed him maintain the same attitude, so that the Rāma cultus represents a saner and purer form of Hindu religious thought than Rādhākṛṣnaism.</p>
<p>XXV. Nāmadev and Tukārām.</p>
<p>§ 71. The popular Vaiṣṇavism of the Maratha country centres itself round the shrine of Viṭhobāat Paṇḍharpur, which is a city situated on the banks of the Bhīmāor Bhīmarathī. The full name of the god is Viṭṭhal, which is not a Sanskrit name, but the etymology is clear enough. It is stated that the corruption of the Sanskrit name Viṣṇu in the Canarese language is Viṭṭhu, and this looks probable, since Kṛṣṇa is corrupted into Kuṣṭa in the Goanese dialect and Kuṭṭa, Kiṭṭi, or Kṛṣṭa in the Canarese; and we have seen that Viṣṇu, the first portion of the name of the. Hoysala prince Viṣṇuvardhana, was corrupted to Viṭṭi or Biṭṭi<sup id="fnref1:65"><a href="#fn:65" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">65</a></sup>. The terminations bāand la are appended to the name Viṣṇu or Viṭṭu to indicate additional sense such as tenderness or reverence. When the shrine was established, we have not the means of determining, but we have clear evidence of its being in existence in the middle of the thirteenth century. In a copperplate Inscription of the reign of Kṛṣṇa of the Yādava dynasty of Devagiri, it is stated that Malliseṭṭi, a general and viceroy of the king, made, while engaged on a military expedition, the grant of a village in the Belgaum district at Pauṇḍarīkakśetra, a holy place situated on the Bhīmarathī, in the vicinity of the god Viṣṇu, in the year. 1171 of the Śaka era corresponding to 1249 A.D<sup id="fnref1:66"><a href="#fn:66" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">66</a></sup>. Now if the Pauṇḍarīkakśetra was situated on the Bhīmarathī or Bhīmāriver, it is certainly not unreasonable to suppose that is was the same as Paṇḍharīwhich is the alternative name of Paṇḍharpur; and</p>
<p>the god in whose vicinity the grant was made must therefore. have been Viṭṭhal , or Viṭhobā, here mentioned by his Sanskrit name and not the popular Canarose corruption. In another Inscription on stone, existing at Paṇḍharpur itself and dated 1192 Śaka, which corresponds to 1270 A. D., Bhānu the son of Keśava, is represented to have performed an Aptoryāma sacrifice in Pāṇḍuraṅgapura, in consequence of which crowds of people, and Viṭṭhal a together with the gods, were greatly gratified¹.Here we have another name of Paṇḍharpur, and that was probably given to it because it was the city of Pāṇḍuraṅga.</p>
<p>Pāṇḍaraṅga, or Pāṇḍuraṅga, is according to Hemacandra a name of Rudra or Śiva<sup id="fnref1:67"><a href="#fn:67" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">67</a></sup>. And we have a temple of Śiva at Paṇḍharpur, and pilgrims have to visit it first before going to that of Viṭhoba or Viṭṭhal Pāṇḍuraṅga, which is the same as the Pāṇḍuraṅga of Hemcandra, is however in modern times a popular name for Viṭṭhal .Whether then the city was called. Pāṇḍuraṅgapura on account of it containing the temple of Viṣṇu or Viṭṭhal , or that of Śiva is doubtful. But from the wording of the Inscription, in which Viṭṭhal a and Pāṇḍuraṅgapuraare mentioned independently, it would appear as if Viṭṭhal had no connection with the name, and it was given to the city on account of its containing a Śiva temple. But when Viṭhoba&rsquo;s importance increased in later times so vastly that Śiva was thrown entirely into the shade, Panduranga became identical with Viṭṭhala.</p>
<p>The name Pauṇḍarīkaoccuring in the first Inscription seems to owe its origin to a man named Pauṇḍarīka, the popular legend about whom is to the following effect. The region about Paṇḍharpur was, it is said, a forest of the name of Diṇḍiravana. There lived a man of the name of Pauṇḍalīka, who spent all his time in the service of his aged parents, and the god Kṛṣṇawas pleased. with his devotion to them. In the meantime, while Kṛṣṇa Was living at Dvāraka, he remembered Rādhā, who was the object of</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.Early History of the Deccan, Second Ed., p. 115, in which, however, Keśava, the father of Bhānu, is by mistake represented as the sacrificer. [= Volume III of this Edition, page 161.— N. B. U. ]</p>
<p>his fervent love while he was in Gokula. Rādhā, who had, after Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s leaving Gokula, betaken herself to a residence in the Himālaya mountain, for the practice of austerities in consequenos of her separation from Kṛṣṇa, came to know of this through her innate cognitive power, and came at once to Dvārakāand sat on the lap of Kṛṣṇa. Some time after Rukmiṇī, the wedded wife of Kṛṣṇa, came to the place, and Rādhā did not rise up to honour her, as every other woman in similar circumstances did at her approach. Kṛṣṇa even did not take Rādhā to task for this dishonour of Rukmīṇī, and Rukmīṇī got offended, left Dvāraka and wandered about, until she came to Diṇḍiravana, and rested there on the site of the modern Paṇḍharpur. Kṛṣṇa was filled with sorrow at the disappearance of Rukmīṇī and went about in quest of her to all parts of the country, until he came to the place where Rukmiṇī was lying. After some explanations she was reconciled to him, and Kṛṣṇa then went to the hut of Puṇḍalīka to reward him for his devotion to his parents by personal manifestation. Puṇḍalīka being engaged in attending to the wants of his father and mother, was not able to greet him at, once, and threw back a brick (Marāṭhī: vīt) and asked him to stand on it and wait for him until he finished what he was engaged on. Kṛṣṇa stood on the brick and there he was joined by Rukmiṇī, and thus the shrine of Paṇḍharpur grew up.</p>
<p>Puṇḍalīka has been referred to as the originator of the Viṭṭhal cult of devotion both by Nāmadev and Tukārām, and that is the popular belief. The legend points to this fact, and we may therefore take him to be the person who promulgated the cult of Viṭṭhobā, or Viṣṇu, in the Maratha country. He established himself at Paṇḍharpur and it must be on that account that the city is called the holy place (Kṣetra) Pauṇḍarīka, which I identify with the modern name Paṇḍharīin the first Inscription. The Paṇḍuraṅgapura of the second may have become the later Puṇḍhrapur.</p>
<p>There is another historical significance in this legend, and that appears to be this. At first, no woman was connected with the Kṛṣṇa worship, as we have seen in the case of the pure Pāñcsrātra or Bhāgavata system. Then came Rādhā to be associated with him in the North, as we have seen, in the systems of</p>
<p>Nimbārka, Vallabha and Caitanya, while Rukmiṇī, the lawful wife, was united with him in the Maratha country. The Kṛṣṇa of Puṇḍhrapur is almost exclusively known by the name of Viṭṭhala or Viṭhobā, and Rukmiṇī by the name of Rakhamāīor Rakhamābāī. In the religious literature of the country, Viṭṭhala, or Kṛṣṇa, is almost exclusively spoken of as Rukmiṇīpati or Rukmiṇīvara, the lord or husband of Rukmiṇī, and not as Rādhā- vallabha, or the lover of Rādhā. Thus the Vaiṣṇavism of the Maratha country, associated as it is with these two names, is more sober and purer than that of the three systems named above. Rāhīthe Marathi form of Rādhikā, is not unknown, but an insignificant place is assigned to her. The sports of Kṛṣṇa in Gokula are also represented occasionally in the mode of worship, but very little importance is attached to them.</p>
<p>This Vaiṣṇavism of the Marāṭha country found a fertile soil among the lower classes, though it has had followers among Brāhmaṇas and other higher classes also. Like the Vaiṣṇavism of the disciples of Rāmānanda, it had no learned or Sanskrit-knowing promulgators, but its prophets were Sūdras, who, however, had the true religious instinct and possessed a clear spiritual insight. Such were Nāmdev and Tukārām.</p>
<p>§ 72. The family of Nāmdev originally lived at the village called Narasi Vāmanī, situated near Karhad in the Satara District, and now known by the name of Bhayē-Narsingpur or Koleṁ-Narsingpur. It belonged to the tailor caste and followed that occupation or of dealers in cloth. The name of Nāmdev&rsquo;s father was DāmāŚet, and that of his mother, Goṇābāī. They migrated to Pauṇḍhrapur, where Nāmdev was born in the Śaka year 1192, corresponding to 1270 A. D. Nāmdev received ordinary education, but showed little capacity for the usual occupation of his family. He became a devoted worshipper of Viṭhobāand had for his Guru a person named VisobāKhecar, who appears to have been a non-idolater. For Nāmdevsays of him that he gave him the following instruction :—</p>
<p>No.191¹. &ldquo;A stone-god never speaks. What possibility then of his removing the disease of mundane existence? A stone.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.Tukaram Tatya&rsquo;s edition, published in Bombay in 1894,</p>
<p>image is regarded as God, but the true God is wholly different. If a stone-god fulfils desires, how is it he breaks when struck. Those who adore a god made of stone, lose everything through their folly. Those who say and hear that a god of stone speaks. to his devotees, are both of them fools. Those who extol the greatness of such a god and call themselves his devotees, should be regarded as worthless persons and their words should not be heard by the ear. If by chiselling a stone, a god is made of it. and is worshipped with care for many years, will he be of use at any time? Do reflect on this well in your mind. Whether a holy place is small or large, there is no god but stone or water. In the village of Dvādasī(Bārsī)¹ instruction was given that. there is no place which is devoid of God. That God was shown to Nāma in his heart, and thus Khecar conferred a blessing on him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The omnipresence of God and his being neither stock nor stone are well brought out here. The omnipotence of God. Nāmdev brings out in the following :—</p>
<p>No. 151. &quot; The Veda has to speak by thy might and the sun. has to move round; such is the might of thee, the lord of the universe ! Knowing this essential truth, I have surrendered myself to thee. By thy might it is that the clouds have to pour down rain, mountains to rest firm and the wind to blow. Nothing. moves at all (without thee). Oh lord Pāṇḍurang ! thou art the cause of all.”</p>
<p>It will thus be seen that, though Nāmdev worshipped the idol at Paṇḍharpur, he had full knowledge of the true nature of God, as given in treatises like the Upanṣiads; and this God it was that he tried to attain.</p>
<p>No.1029. &ldquo;Your mind is full of vices. What is the use of the pilgrimages you make? What is the use of austere practices, if there is no repentance? The sins resulting from a mental act cannot be effaced by the highest holy place (literally: the father of the holy places). The essence of the matter is very simple : Sin is effaced by repentance&rdquo;, so says Nāmā.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.Bārsīis a town near Paṇḍharpur.</p>
<p>No. 887. &quot; Vows, fasts, and austerities are not at all necessary; nor it is necessary for you to go on a pilgrimage. Be you. watchful in your hearts and always sing the name of Hari. It is not necessary to give up eating food or drinking water; fix your mind on the feet of Hari. Yoga or sacrificial ceremonies or giving up objects of desire is not wanted. Realise a fondness for the feet of Hari. Neither is it necessary for you to contemplate (lit. dwell in ) the one without attributes. Hold fast to the lovel of the name of Hari; says Nāmā, be firm in singing the name. and then Paṇḍurang will render himself manifest to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In these two songs Nāmdev urges upon his hearers the total. inefficacy of the usual modes of purification and of the attainment of God, such as pilgrimages, vaws, fasts, or meditation on the absolute, and sacrifices.</p>
<p>No. 245. &quot; Recognise him alone to be a righteous man, who sees Vāsudeva in all objects, eradicting all pride or egoism. The rest are entangled in the shackles of delusion. To him all wealth is like earth and the nine species of gems are mere stones. The two, desire and anger, he has thrown out and cherishes in his heart (lit. house) quietude and forgiveness. He constantly repeats the name of Govinda, not desisting even for a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No.1004. &quot; Firmly grasp the truth which is Nārāyaṇa. Purity of conduct should not be abandoned; one should not be afraid of the censure of people and thus accomplish one&rsquo;s own purpose. Surrender yourself to your loving friend (God), giving up all ostentation and pride. The censure of people should be regarded as praise and their praise not heeded. One should entertain no longing for being respected and honoured, but should nourish in oneself a liking for devotion. This should be rendered firm in the mind and the name of God should not be neglected even for a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In these songs Nāmdev describes the holy condition of him who is a devotee of Vāsudeva and sees him everywhere, and preaches self-surrender to him, regardless of the criticism of the world.</p>
<p>This is a short specimen of the teachings of Nāmdev. Purity of heart, humility, self-surrender, forgiveness, and the love of God</p>
<p>form the sum and substance of it. Nāmdev wrote songs in Hindīalso and some of these are incorporated in the Grantha-Sāheb, or the Bible of the Sikhs. I will here translate two of these<sup id="fnref1:68"><a href="#fn:68" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">68</a></sup>:—</p>
<p>No. 2352. &ldquo;He is one, [but] fills and encompassess many; wherever you look yon find him there. There is scarcely one who understands him, all being deluded by the variegated picture. drawn by Māyā(delusive power). Everything is Govinds, everything is Govinda, there is nothing without Govinda. Just as there is one thread and on it are woven breadthwise and length- wise hundreds of thousands of beads, so is everything woven in the lord. The waves, the foam, and the bubbles of water are not different from water. All this extent of the universe is the sport. of Parabrahma, and when we think of it, is not different from it. Illusive phantoms and the objects seen in dreams are regarded as real. When by the instruction of my Guru my mind awoke, I accepted the truth. Reflecting in your mind, see this all to be the creation of Hari, says Nāmdev; in the inside of every indivi- dual thing there is one Murari alone without any interstice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No.2353. &quot; The pitcher is filled and the water brought to bathe the god. There were forty-two hundreds of thousands of animals in it; there was already Viṭṭhal in them. Whom shall I bathe? Wherever we go there is Viṭṭhal and he over sports in joy. Flowers have been brought and wreaths woven of them for worshipping God. First of all the flowers were smelt by the bees, there was Viṭṭhal there; what shall I do? Milk has been brought and cooked for the offering of Khīr² to God. The milk was first tasted by the calf, in it was Viṭṭhal, what shall I do? Here is Viṭṭhal, there is Viṭṭhal, there is no world without Viṭṭhal. This place and that, thou hast filled. Thou hast filled the whole world, says Nāmāhumbly&quot;³.</p>
<p>In these hymns God&rsquo;s omnipresence is described by Nāmdev.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>2. A preparation of milk and rice mixed with sugar.</p>
<p>3.These two hymns have been translated by Macauliffe in Vol. VI, pp. 41-42 of the Sikh Religion. The readings in the Bombay Ed. have been compared with those in the Grantha-Sāheb, pp. 427-28 of the Lucknow Ed. of 1893,</p>
<p>§ 73. The date assigned to the birth of Nāmdev is, as we have seen, Śaka 1192, that is 1270 A. D. This makes him a contemporary of Jñāndev, the author of the Jñāndevī, which was finished. in 1290 A. D. But the Marāṭhīof the latter work is decidedly archaic, while that of Nāmdev&rsquo;s writings has a considerably more. modern appearance. Nāmdev&rsquo;s Hindi too looks more modern. than that of the thirteenth century, when the poet Canda flourished¹. What this is due to, it is difficult to say. But it appears probable that the traditional date of Nāmdev&rsquo;s birth-Śaka 1192-has been pushed backwards and that he is represented as a contemporary of Jñāndev. We have seen in a former section<sup id="fnref1:69"><a href="#fn:69" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">69</a></sup>that Nabhāji in naming the successors of Viṣṇusvāmin places. Jiandey first and Nāmdev afterwards. If we are to judge from Nāmdev&rsquo;s Marāṭhī and Hindī, his date must be put later by about. a century.</p>
<p>Some conception, however, of the time when Nāmdev flourished may be formed from the strong and definite sentiments as to the futility of idol-worship, which his instructor is represented (in one of the hymns translated) to have expressed. Khecar, or Visoba Khecar as he is usually called, appears to have been an uncom- promising opponent of idol-worship from the accounts given of him in the existing biographies. All previous writers, including Rāmānuja, as well as a great many that followed, excused idol- worship in some way or other. If then Khecar&rsquo;s attitude towards it was definitely hostile, he and his pupil Nāmdev must have flourished when the Mahomedan influence had for the first time become very powerful. The Mahomedans established themselves in the Deccan in the beginning of the fourteenth century of the Christian era, and their hatred of idol-worship must have taken about a hundred years to make its way into the understanding of religious Hindus.</p>
<p>But a more direct evidence for the fact that Nāmdev flourished after the Mahomedans had established themselves in the Marāṭhācountry is afforded by his mention in a song (No. 364) of thedestruction of idols by the Turaks, i.e.,Turks. The Mahomedang were often called Turaks in early times by the Hindus. Nāmdev, therefore, probably lived about or after the end of the fourteenth century.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.See my Report on the Search for Sanskrit MSS, 1887-1891, page LXXX. [= Volume II of this Edition, p. 343.-N. B. U.]</p>
<p>It will thus be seen that the date of Nāmdev&rsquo;s birth given with such details is quite wrong. Unfortunately the historical spirit has by no means been the distinguishing feature of the intellectual life of us Indians, and we often confuse different persons together, and attribute to one what belongs to another. Some such confusion must have taken place in the present case.</p>
<p><strong>Tukārām</strong></p>
<p>§ 74. Tukārām was born and lived at a village called Dehu, which is about fourteen miles to the north-east of Poona. The name. of the family to which he belonged was More. It was a family of the Marāṭhācaste, which caste may have sprung from the old order of Kṣatriyas, but is considered to belong to the Śūdra order. Nothing specific is known about the date of his birth, but there is no reason for doubting the truth of the date traditionally assigned to his death, which is Śaka 1571, corresponding to 1649 A. D. Hist biographer, Mahīpati, represents him to have become a bankrupt at the end of the first half of his life, when he was twenty-one years of age. From that it is inferred that he lived for 42 years, and he is thus understood to have been born in 1607-8 A. D.</p>
<p>Seven of Tukārām&rsquo;s ancestors were devoted worshippers of the god Viṭhobā. Of these Viśaṁbhara was the first who made regular pilgrimages to Paṇḍharpur, but after some years he constructed a temple in his own village, and placing the idols of Viṭhoba and Rukmāīin it, dedicated it to their worship. Tukārām&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s name was Bolhojīand he followed the occupation of a potty trader. When he became old, he proposed to entrust the affairs of his family and his business to Sāvjī, his eldest son. But Sāvjīwas a man for whom a worldly life had no interest, and he declined to undertake the business. It was, therefore, made over to Tukārām, who was then thirteen years of age. Tukārām managed the affairs somehow, till he became seventeen years old, when his father died. He naturally felt desolate when this occurred. and being a man of simplicity and liable to be imposed upo gby designing persons, his affairs got into disorder and he incurred loss in his trade.</p>
<p>Tukārām was at first married to a wife who was sickly, and some time later he married another of the name of Jijābāīor Āvalī, the daughter of a well-to-do trader in Poona. When hist affairs got into confusion, Āvalī procured a loan for him and set him up again. A short time after, he made a profit in his new trade, and, while coming back from the place to which he had gone for the sale of his goods, he met a man whe was being carried about by the agents of his creditor, and who was crying out for assistance to relieve him from his debt and the impending imprisonment. To this man Tukārām gave all that he possessed-the capital, and the profit that he had made. He returned to Dehu. empty-handed, and soon after there was a famine, which made him a thorough bankrupt, and his first wife died of hunger.</p>
<p>Tukārām then made up his mind to renounce his business, but his younger brother Kānhyā protested against it. Then,sitting on the banks of the Indrāyaṇī, he told his brother to bring all the documents, deeds and bonds relating to their business, divided them. into two parts, gave one to Kānhyā, and told him to live separately from him, and his own share he threw into the river.</p>
<p>Henceforward he devoted himself to the contemplation of God and singing his praises, spending the day on the top of a hill near Dehu and the night at the temple of Viṭhobain the village.</p>
<p>He read the Marāṭhīworks on religious subjects of the saints and sages who had flourished before him. The idea of giving expression to his thoughts and feelings by composing songs in Marāṭhī soon arose in his mind. The metre used by him was that which is known by the name of Abhang, the measure of which is by no means strict or regular, but which is characterised by the use of rhyming words at specific intervals. A single-minded piety and the desire to be of service to all, even by executing their errands, became settled points in his character. Family matters. had to be attended to by his wife, Āvalī, who often found herself in great straits.</p>
<p>Tukārām&rsquo;s chief occupation was the performance of Kīrtans, which consist of religious discourses interspersed with the singing of songs. These discourses gradually became very attractive and drew in crowds of people. The songs he sung at</p>
<p>these had been often prepared by himself, and some were composed. by him extempore while engaged in the discourse.</p>
<p>Tukārām&rsquo;s fame spread about not only in his village, but in the surrounding country, and it evoked jealousy, especially in. the minds of Brāhmaṇas, who had set themselves up as religious teachers; and he was subjected to persecution. He, however, maintained an evenness of temper throughout, though there were. struggles in the mind. His fame reached the ears of the rising prince, Śivājī, the future king of the Marāṭhā. He was eager to hear Tukārām&rsquo;s Kīrtans, and on one occasion invited him into his presence, sending him messengers with torches, umbrella and horses, as emblems of high honour. Tukārām, however, declined to go and sent him a letter written in his usual metre. On another occasion Śivājī attended his Kīrtan at Lohagaon, about six miles from Poona, and placed before him a plate full of golden coins. Tukārām, of course, declined to receive them, and they were distributed among the Brāhmaṇas there. When his end approached, he is reported to have gathered together a large body of his followers and to have proceeded to the banks of the Indrāyaṇī, all singing loudly and enthusiastically the praises of God and fully absorbed in it. When they approached the river, Tukārām suddenly disappeared. No further account of his death has beenhanded down.</p>
<p>§ 75. It has been already stated that Tukārām had acquired a great facility in composing Abhaṅgs. He spoke in Abhaṅgs and wrote in Abhaṅgs. Some of these only could be written and were written, and others were neglected by him or his immediate followers, but retained in the memory of others. The collections, therefore, of his pieces cannot be expected to be of the same size. There are two such printed in Bombay, one containing 4621 pieces and the other 8441. This latter collection is uncritically made and oftentimes one same piece is given a second time with the opening lines omitted. Still, this is a larger collection and contains Abhaṅgs which are not to be found in the first collection, but are quite in the style of Tukārām with the usual fervent devotion and purity of thought.</p>
<p>We will now give a few specimens:—</p>
<p>First collection, No. 2869. &quot; When the auspicious juncture of Siṁhastha¹ comes, it brings fortune only to barbers and priests. There are crores of sins in the heart, but externally a man shaves the hair on the head and the beard. What has been shaved off, has disappeared. Tell me what else has changed. The vicious habits are not changed, which might be regarded as a mark of the destruction of sins: says Tukā, without devotion and faith everything else is useless trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Second collection, No. 4733. &quot; What hast thou done by going to a holy river? Thou hast only outwardly washed thy skin. In what way has the interior been purified? By this thou hast only added a feather to thy cap (lit. prepared a decoration for thyself). Even if the bitter Vṛndāvana fruit is coated with sugar, the settled quality of the interior (bitterness) is in no way lessered. If peace, forgiveness, and sympathy do not come in, why should you take any trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>First coll., No. 90 (1-2). &ldquo;Sesamum seeds and grains of rice thou hast burnt by throwing into fire, but desire and anger are as mischievous as before. Why hast thou taken trouble in vain, giving up the adoration of Pāṇḍurang?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Tukārām condemns religious practices which concern the body only, and mechanical rites, such as giving oblations, and enforces the necessity of striving for the attainment of spiritual virtue and of the adoration of God.</p>
<p>In No. 2383 ( first coll.,) Tukārām condemns the worship of goddesses, JākhāīJokhāī, of gods like Bhairava and even Gaṇapati, and of ghosts and goblins, and earnestly recommends the adoration of him whose consort is Rakhamāī. Tukārām was thus &amp; devotee only of Viṭhobāof Pāṇḍharpur and a monotheist in this sense. Though he worshipped the idol at the place, still he had always before his mind&rsquo;s eye the great Lord of the universe, as the following will show:—</p>
<p>First coll., No. 4361. &ldquo;Thy greatness is unsearchable. Even the Vedas became silent and the power of the mind becomes stunted.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.When Jupiter is in the sign of Lon, the period is considered favourable for the washing away of sins, nad Hindus go to holy places, such as Nasik, shave their heads and mustaches and bathe in the river.</p>
<p>What possibility is there of my mental power reaching Him, whose light it is that the sun and the moon display? Even the thousand-tongued (the great serpent) is unable to expound thy greatness. How then shall I be able to do so? Says Tukā, we are thy children, thou art our mother place us under the shadow (protection) of thy grace.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Fist coll., No. 4419. &quot; All the world says that there is not a space so minute as a sesamum seed without thee. The old Ṛṣis, sages, poious and holy men said that thou art in the heart of all these things&hellip;&hellip;..Thou hast filled up numberless universes and also a residue still remained. But to me thou hast become. inaccessible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>First Coll., No. 1870. &quot; God is ours, certainly ours, and is the soul of all souls. God is near to us, certainly near, outside and inside. God is benignant, certainly benignant, and fulfils every longing even of a longing nature. God protects us, certainly protects us, and subdues strife and death. God is merciful, certainly merciful, and protects Tukā.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This great God is to be attained only by devoted love and by no other means:—</p>
<p>First coll., No. 810. &quot; This thy nature is beyond the grasp of the mind or of words; and therefore I have made devoted love a measure. I measure the Endless by the measure of love; he is not to be truly measured by any other means. Thou art not to be found by processes of concentration (Yoga), sacrificial rites, practice of austerities, and any bodily exertions, nor by knowledge. Oh Keśave, accept the service which we render to thee in the simplicity of our hearts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is peace and pure indescribable bliss in seeing God:—</p>
<p>Second coll., No. 1411. &quot; Oh Nārāyaṇa, the peace arising. from rest is truly not to be attained without thy feet; even if modes and methods are followed for crores of Kalpas<sup id="fnref1:70"><a href="#fn:70" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">70</a></sup>, bliss will not ensue. The bliss of bliss, which is interminable and boundless, which is enjoyed by Hari and Hara, manifest to me, oh thou ! the</p>
<p>sustainer of my soul, oh omniscient, those feet of thine I which produce it ],&rdquo;</p>
<p>But this God is not to be seen by those whose passions are unrestrained:—</p>
<p>First coll., No. 4420. &quot; The Endless is beyond, and between him and me there are the lofty mountains of desire and anger. I am not able to ascend them, nor do I find any pass. Insurmountable is the ascent of my (mountain-like) enemies. What possibility is there of my attaining Nārāyaṇa, my friend? Pāṇḍuraṅg is lost to me; says Tukā, it is now plain that this valuable life of mine has gone for nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To curb these passions becomes now his great and earnest aim. He examines his heart carefully and on all occasions in life finds. them present there in one shape or another with all his efforts he fails to restrain them; and addresses fervent prayers again and again to God to help him. The number of these is very large:—</p>
<p>Secord Coll, No. 1430. &quot; With whose support shall I gird up my loins? Oh Pāṇḍuraṅg, I feel depressed. All wicked persons abide in my frame and my mind is subdued by them. All my efforts have proved fruitless. What shall I do? Thou art the only. mother of the helpless; says Tukā, those wicked persons will not leave my frame without thy might.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wicked persons are passions.</p>
<p>When in the course of years, Tukārām became famous and was praised everywhere, he found a glow of satisfaction gathering strength in his heart. This he recognised as pride or conceit, and he was greatly afraid of it, and again and again prayed to God to free him from this pride and bestow humility of spirit:—</p>
<p>First coll., No. 1779: &quot; I have become an expert in the unrostricted use of words. The root of the whole matter I have not attained. Therefore, oh king of Pāṇḍharīmy mind is afflicted. Who knows what is in my heart? I am respected or worshipped, and this has given rise to conceit; and my further progress (towards perfection) has been arrested; says Tukā, I do not know the true way and find myself in the hands of egotism.&rdquo; Again:—</p>
<p>First coll, No. 1133. &quot; What shall I do with fame and worldly</p>
<p>honour and greatness? Do show me thy feet. Do not bring about this (result), that thy servant should go for nothing. If I become. great and bear the burden of ostentatious knowledge, I shall go away from thy feet farther and farther. What possibility is there. of people knowing the internal condition? A man is judged by his external appearances. Even adversity will be sweet to me, if it leads me to thy feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thus goes on cultivating the virtue of humility, until at last he comes to speak of the death of the self in him as in the following:—</p>
<p>First coll., No. 3474. &quot; I have surrendered my soul to thee and then I have abandoned my individuality (dwelling). Now thy might alone prevails here. I being dead, thou hast established thy station here. Now nothing like me and mine remains here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here he speaks of his ha ing abandoned the self and God&rsquo;s having come to dwell in his heart instead of the self. And more distinctly :—</p>
<p>First Coll., No. 2668. &quot; I have seen my own death with my eyes. The result is incomparable rapture. The three worlds are filled with joy. And I have enjoyed as the soul of all. By my sense of individuality I was confined to one place and by its abandonment I have become all-reaching. The pollution arising from birth and death is at an end and I am free from the littleness resulting from the feeling of me and mine. Nārāyaṇa has now given me a place to dwell in: putting my faith in him I have remained at his feet: Tukā says, the fulfilment of what I undertook I have manifested to the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here he speaks of the dying of the lower man in himself and the coming to life of the higher man.</p>
<p>There is a large number of pieces conveying instruction to men seeking spiritual advance. A few specimens will now be given:—</p>
<p>First coll. No. 3800. &quot; Therefore one should surrender oneself to God with all one&rsquo;s heart. He will carry one to the opposite bank of the river of life, which is difficult to be crossed. He</p>
<p>whose name is Ananta, or Endless, is very merciful; Tukā says, I have experienced this and therefore announce it to all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Second Coll., No. 5383. &ldquo;Fortunate, indeed, are those persons, in whose heart dwells forgiveness and to whom, when there is occasion, courage and strength do not fail; who do not criticise other people by calling them good or bad and who think nothing of worldly greatness or superiority who internally and externally are alike pure like the Gaṅgāand whose heart is tender; Tukāsays, I will wave my body round them and place my head on their feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>First coll., No. 2397. &ldquo;For all beings entertain no hostile. feeling. This one alone is the excellent way. Thus alone will Nārāyaṇa accept thee. All talk without this is useless trouble. Relatives as well as the evil-disposed should be regarded as alike. and the mind devoted to the doing of good to others; Tukāsays, when the mind is pure everything becomes efficacious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>First coll., No. 1368. &ldquo;Do not give up food; do not betake yourself to a forest-dwelling; in all your sufferings and enjoyments think of Nārāyaṇa . A child sitting on the shoulders of its mother feels no trouble. Put an end to all thoughts different from this. Do not get entangled in worldly enjoyments nor abandon them; dedicate everything you do to God, and have done. with it; Tukā says, do not ask me again and again; nothing else. is to be taught but this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Tukārām dissuades men from giving up the world and becoming recluses, and advises them instead to dedicate their lives to the service of God and do everything in a manner to propitiate him.</p>
<p>The question has often been discussed among Marāṭhas whether Tukārām followed the Vedāntic theory of Śaṁkarācārya and regarded everything as an illusion except one soul. There are some Abhaṅgs which exhibit the closest possible approach to that theory such as the following :—</p>
<p>First coll., No. 300. &ldquo;What means crossing a mirage to reach the yonder bank? Children play with golden coins which are but pot-sherds. Is there any profit or loss by those transactions?</p>
<p>Little girls perform marriage (of dolls). Is the relation thus established real? The happiness or misery experienced in a dream is seen not to be true when a man awakes. The expressions, one is born, one is dead, are all false; and the saying that persons are in bondage or are delivered is a mere waste of breath, 50 says Tukā.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the illusive nature of everything is set forth quite in the style of Śaṁkarācārya&rsquo;s world-illusion. Again :—</p>
<p>First coll., No. 1992, &quot; A sugar crystal and sugar powder differ only in the name. There is no difference when sweetness is to be judged. Tell me, oh Pāṇḍuraṅg, how thou and I are distinct. Thou hast moved the world, and me and mine are the results Gold in the form of ornaments is worn on the foot, the hands, nose and the head. When all these are thrown into the crucible, where remains the distinction? Profit and loss are real in the dream when one goes to sleep, both vanish when one is awakened, so says Tukā.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here there is a mixture of the two opposite theories, that of Pariṇāma, or development, as in the case of gold and ornaments. made of it, and that of Vivarta, or illusion, as in the case of things seen in a dream. The latter alone is hold by Śaṁkarācārya. Again :—</p>
<p>First coll., No. 2482. &quot; When salt is dissolved in water, what is it that remains distinct? I have thus become one in joy with thee and have lost myself in thee. When fire and camphor are brought together, is there any black remnant? Tukāsays, thou and I were one light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the losing of self-consciousness in moments of ecstasy appears to be what is meant, and not quite a perfect identity of God and man. Nāmdev and Tukārām were not learned Paṇḍits like Rāmānuja and Mādhva and cannot be expected to formulate a consistent metaphysical theory of the relations between God, man, and the world. On the other hand, Tukārām
was such a devout and sincere lover of God that the idea of such a distinctness between the three as would render such a love possible, was constantly present in his mind, and there are a great many</p>
<p>Abhaṅgs in which he condemns the theory of spiritual monism as in the following:—</p>
<p>First coll, No. 1471. &ldquo;His words should not be listened to, who expounds useless (unsubstantial ) knowledge without Bhakti, or devotion. When monism is expounded without faith and love, the expounder as well as the hearer are troubled and afflicted. Hel who calls himself Brahma and goes on in his usual way, should not be spoken to and is a buffoon. The shameless one who speaks heresy in opposition to the Vedas is an object of soorn among holy men. Even an outeast is superior to him who cuts off the relation between God and his devotee (by asserting them to be identical); so says Tukā</p>
<p>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here is an uncompromising denunciation of spiritual monism. which leaves no scope for Bhakti, or devotion. It is considered as opposed to the Vedas and as a heresy. Again:—</p>
<p>First coll., No. 3753. &quot; For me there is no satisfaction in the doctrine of monism. Sweet to me is the service of thy feet. Confer this gift upon me making it fit (to be given by thee). Thy name and the singing of it are dear to me. The relation between. God and his devotee is a source of elevated joy. Make me feel this, keeping me distinct from thee. All this belongs to thee. Confer it upon me some day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here in his confutation of spiritual monism he takes his stand on the heartfelt charms of the love of God. He sets the innate feelings of his heart against the sophism of the advocates of the Advaits Vedānta.</p>
<p>First coll., No. 1589. &ldquo;I will make the mouth of the knowers of Brahma to water (in longing) and make the delivered ones to abandon the pristine condition (attained in consequence of deliverance). In singing, the whole bodily frame becomes instinct with Brahma and the good fortune ( resulting from it) consists in making God a debtor. I will bring indolence on him whose practice it is to repair to holy places, and make the enjoyment of a life in heaven bitter. I will make the man who practises. austerities give up his pride and put to shame sacrificial rites and charities. I will accomplish the great object of life, viz., love and wealth of devotion, which constitutes the true treasure</p>
<p>of Brahma and its substance; and I will make people say that it was by good fortune that they saw Tukāand became blessed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here his enthusiasm for the love and devotion for God becomes so great, that he instinctively, as it were, out of the strength of his feelings declares all other ways of reaching God, including the monistio Vedānta, as worthless and inefficacious.</p>
<p>Lastly I will here translate the Abhaṅg in which Tukārām sets forth the mission of his life :—</p>
<p>First coll., No. 520. &quot; We lived in the Vaikuṇṭha and have come for this very reason, viz., for bringing into practice truly what the Ṛṣis taught. The world is overgrown with weeds; we. will sweep clean the paths trodden by the righteous and accept what has remained. The old truths have disappeared. Mere: verbal knowledge has brought about destruction. The mind (of man) is eager for worldly enjoyments and the way to God has been. wholly obliterated. We will beat the drum of Bhakti which carries. terror to this sinful age; Tukāsays, proclaim victory with joy¹.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The above extracts from a voluminous collection will give some indication of the manner in which Tukārām endeavoured to execute his mission. He denounced the merely mechanical rites. and practices, enforced humility and the purification of the heart and a single-minded devotion to God.</p>
<p><strong>XXVI. Résumé of Vaiṣṇavism.</strong></p>
<p>§ 76. We have thus completed our survey of Vaiṣṇavism from about the fifth century before Christ to the middle of the seventeenth. It first appeared as a religious reform, like Buddhism and Jainism, but based on theistic principles. Its early name was Ekāntika Dharma, or the religion of a single-minded love. and devotion to One. In its back-ground stood the Bhagavadgītā, a discourse professing to be preached by Vāsudeva-Kṛṣṇa. It soon assumed a sectarian form and was called the Pāñcarātra or Bhāgavata religion. It was professed by a tribe of Kṣatriyas of the name of Sātvata and was noticed by Megasthenes, about the end of the fourth century before Christ, as the religion of such a specific people. This faith mingled itself with the existing one in Nārāyaṇa, the fountain from which all men have sprung, andwith that in Viṣṇu, whose traces were visible in this world, and. who at the same time had a mysterious nature. In the Bhagavadgītā itself were embodied some of the teachings of the Upaniṣads and a few general doctrines of two kinds of philosophy, the Saṁkhya and the Yoga, which, however, had not yet assumed the character of definite systems.</p>
<p>____________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.The readings of this piece have been compared with those handed down orally and corrected.</p>
<p>Soon after the beginning of the Christian era another element. was contributed to this system of religion by the Ābhīras, or cowherds, who belonged to a foreign tribe, in the shape of the marvellous deeds of the boy-Kṛṣṇa, who came to be regarded as a god, and of his amorous dalliances with cowherdesses. So constituted, Vaiṣṇavism went on till about the end of the eighth century, when the doctrine of spiritual monism and world-illusion was promulgated and dissominated by Śamkarācārya and his followers. This was considered as destructive of the Bhakti, or love, which Vaiṣṇavism enjoined.</p>
<p>And the feeling of hostility to spiritual monism gathered to a head in the eleventh century, when Rāmānuja made strenuous endeavours to put it down and spread the religion of Bhakti in a re-invigorated form. He was followed in the North by Nimbārka, who, however, gave prominence to the fourth or cowherdess element of Vaiṣṇavism and enjoined the worship of Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s mistress. Rādhāalso,Rāmānuja having passed them over in severe silence.</p>
<p>The attacks on spiritual monism and world-illusion were continued in a determined and definite manner in the thirteenth century by Mādhva or Ānandatīrtha, who established the doctrine. of pluralism, and brought into prominence the name of Viṣṇu as that of the supreme God. In the North, Rāmānanda gave a new turn to Vaiṣṇavism by bringing in the name of Rāma, while Rāmānuja, from whom his metaphysical doctrines are derived, laid particular stress on the name Nārāyaṇa. The preachings of Rāmānanda and his disciples were carried on in the Vernacular. Rāmānanda&rsquo;s religious activity is to be referred to the fourteenth century. He was followed by Kabīr in the fifteenth century, who preached strict monotheism, the name of his God being Rāma, and condemned idolatry.</p>
<p>Vallabha in the sixteenth century preached the worship of the boy-Kṛṣṇa and his mistress Rādhā. Caitanys about the same</p>
<p>time promulgated the worship of the grown-up Kṛṣṇa, for ever associated with Rādhā, who was idealised into an image of pure love. The increasing ardency in the love and devotion of God sought for realistic expression, and the conception of Rādhā deepened and acquired an exclusive prominence and importance. The devotion of Caitanya and his followers was sincere and fervent, and even bordered on the frantic; but that of Vallabha and his school was more dramatic than real. Ultimately this conception led to the degradation of Vaiṣṇavism.</p>
<p>In the MārāṭhāCountry, Nāmdev, whose date is uncertain, but who probably lived about the end of the fourteenth century, and Tukārām, in the first half of the seventeenth century, preached the worship of Viṭhobāof Paṇḍharpur as the supreme God, and, discarding Rādhā-Kṛṣṇaism, cultivated a more sober line of devotion. They also resorted to the Vernacular for the dissemination of their ideas. They, as well as Kabīr, and to a certain extent, Caitanya also, condemned the formalism, which prevailed. in the religion of their day, and preached pure love of God. The two Mārāṭhā saints and Kabīr also laid particular stress on the purification of the individual&rsquo;s heart and moral elevation as means to a single-minded and devoted love of God, and as necessary for the attainment of eternal bliss.</p>
<p>The points of contact between these various Vaiṣṇava systems are that their spiritual elements are essentially derived from the Bhagavadgītā, that Vāsudeva as the name of the Supreme Being stands in the background of all, and that spiritual monism and world-illusion are denounced by them equally. The differences arise from the varied importance that they attach to the different spiritual doctrines; the prominence that they give to one or other of the three elements that were mingled with Vāsudevism; the metaphysical theory that they set up; and the ceremonial which they impose upon their followers.</p>
<p>The Bhagavadgītāwas supplemented in later times by the Pāñcarātra Saṁhitās and the Purāṇas such as the Viṣṇu and the Bhāgavata, and other later works of that description. nocasionally elucidated some of the essential doctrines, laid down These the ceremonial, and brought together a vast mass of legendary matter to magnify the importance of their special teachings, and render them attractive.</p>
<p>Part II</p>
<p>ŚAIVISM AND MINOR RELIGIOUS SYSTEMS.<br>
<strong>I. Introductory.<br>
Formation of the Conception of Rudra-Śiva.</strong></p>
<p>§ 77. Some of the phenomena of external nature are pleasing, vivifying and benignant; others are terrible, dispiriting and destructive. In the dawn, the Āryas found the lovely goddess Uṣas, pursued by her lover Sūrya, or the Sun (ṚV. I.115, 2). In the rising sun, they found Mitra, a friendly god, who roused them from sleep and set them to do the work of the day (ṚV. III. 59. 1; VII. 36. 2). And in the sun, who visibly at rising stretched forth his rays as if they were his arms, filling the heaven and the earth, vivifying the world at the end of the night and placing it in the course assigned to it by him, they found Savitr(ṚV. IV. 53, 3). The dreadful and destructive phenomena are usually the storms. that uproot trees and even demolish houses, accompanied by the thunderbolt which strikes down men and beasts dead in a moment; and the epidemics that rage and carry off numbers of mon. In these the old Āryas saw Rudra, who went about howling. with the stormy winds (Maruts), who were his sons ( Rudriyas ).</p>
<p>But human beings do not believe in a purely malignant power reigning in the universe. The dreadful phenomena are attributed to the wrath of a god, which, however, can be appeased by prayer, praise and offerings. Then the god becomes Śiva, or the benignant. This appears to be the natural process by which a belief. in such a god as Rudra-Śiva became established in India in ancient times. We will now trace tho development of the idea of this god until he became the supreme creator, ruler, and pervader of the universe, a knowledge of whom contributed to eternal bliss.</p>
<p>II. The Development of the Idea of Rudra-Śiva.</p>
<p>§ 78. Rudra is represented as discharging brilliant shafts which run about the heaven and the earth (ṚV. VII. 46. 3) and</p>
<p>as possessing weapons which slay cows and men (ṚV. I. 114. 10). Here the destructive agency of lightning seems to have been clearly in view. He is prayed to by the singers to keep these away from them and to protect the two-footed and four-footed beings belonging to them (ṚV. I. 114. 1). When, in consequence of the prayers or in the natural course of things, the cattle go unharmed, Rudra is represented to be Paśupa, or protector of the cattle (ṚV. I. 114. 9).</p>
<p>Rudra is prayed to not to afflict children with disease (RV. VII. 46. 2) and to keep all in the village free from illness (ṚV. I. 114. 1). Rudra was thus believed to cause diseases, and when men recovered from them altogether free from them, that also was attributed to the agency of Rudra; and he is consequently spoken of as possessing healing remedies (ṚV. I. 43. 4) and as the best physician of physicians (ṚV. II. 33. 4) and as possessed of a thousand medicines (ṚV. VII. 46. 3). The singers also pray for the acquisition of those pure and salutary remedies belonging to the Maruts and Rudra, which father Manu desired (ṚV. II. 33. 13).</p>
<p>The general character of the prayers addressed to Rudra is well brought out in the following: &ldquo;Oh Rudra, do not, out of thy anger, injure our children and descendants, our people, our cattle, our houses, and do not kill our men. We invoke thee always with offerings&rdquo; (ṚV. I. 114. 8.). By his power he perceives all earthly beings and by his universal sovereignty he perceives divine beings (ṚV. VIL 46. 2). Here even in the Ṛgveda, Rudra is raised to supreme power.</p>
<p>§ 79. The character of Rudra appears in a much more developed form in the Śatarudriya (TS. IV. 5. 1; VS. chapter 16). Hist benignant form (Ś</p>
<p>ivātanuḥ) is distinguished from its opposite, the malignant. He is called Girīśa or Giritra, &ldquo;lying on a mountain&rdquo;, probably because the thunderbolt that he hurls, springs from a cloud, which is often compared to a mountain and in which he was believed to dwell. The cowherds and the female bearers of waters see him as he creeps along with his blue neck and red complexion, that is, these simple folk working in the open field see a</p>
<p>black aloud tinged red by the soft glow of the lightning. Representing, as Rudra does, the darker powers of nature, he may be expected to dwell away from the habitations of men, and therefore he is called the lord of the paths, of the forests, and of those whot roam in them, of thieves and highway rubbers, who frequent and move about in lonely places te prevent being detected, and also of outcasts who live away from the usual dwellings of men.</p>
<p>In his character as a healer, he appears here as the lord of medicinal herbs and is called a heavenly physician. Being the lord of the open fields or plains, he is the lord of cattle (Paśūnāṁpatiḥ) which roam in them. Then Paśupati became in later times a special appellation of this God. In this manner the range of Rudra became so wide that he came to be called the &ldquo;lord of the quarters&rdquo;. He is called Kapardin, or the wearer of matted hair, which epithet is probably due to his being regarded as identical with Agni, or fire, the fumes of which look like. matted hair. The names Śarva (arrow-wielder), and Bhava also, occur, and when his wrathful nature is thoroughly appeased, he. becomes Śaṁbhu or beneficent, and Śiva or auspicious, which names occur at the end of the Śatarudriya. He is also represented as wearing a hide (Kṛttiṁvasānaḥ). How the epithet arose it is difficult to say. But, being represented as roaming in forests and other lonely places, the idea of investing him with the skinclothing of the savage tribes may have suggested itself to a poet. The Niṣādas, a forest tribe, are compared to Rudras, which fact lends support to this view.</p>
<p>The name Rudra has been generalised and many Rudras are spoken of, and a wish is expressed that they may be far away from the singer. Here the signification of the common name. appears to be an evil spirit. In another place also the name is generalised, but the signification is much better. The Rudras are called Gaṇas or tribes, and Gaṇapatis or leaders of tribes, workmen, potters, cart-makers, carpenters, and Niṣādas or men of the forest-tribes. Thus these followers of handicraft and also the forest-tribe of Niṣādas are brought into close connection with Rudra; probably they were his worshippers or their own peculiar. gods were identified with the Āryan Rudra. This last supposition appears very probable, since the groups of beings, whose</p>
<p>Pati, or lord, he is represented to have been, dwelt in or frequented open fields, forests and waste lands, remote from the habitations of civilised men.</p>
<p>§ 80. In AV. the conception of Rudra is further developed, and he is elevated to a higher platform. Several other. names, by which he was known in later times, are also given, but the bearers of these are spoken of and addressed as separate gods. Bhava and Śarva are treated as two distinct deities and spoken of as ruling (Īśāthe) over two-footed and four-footed beings (IV. 28.1). They are styled the swiftest of all archers, and to them belongs. what is near as well as remote. They are called thousand-eyed. Their range is far and wide (3). Their stroke can not be avoided. by any man or god (5). They are invoked to launch their thunder- bolt against the Yātudhāna, or evil spirit (6). They are implored to deliver the singers from calamity (7). Śarva is called the archer, and Bhava the king (Rājan), and obeisance is made to them, and they are desired to remove their deadly poisons to other places (VI. 93, 2), Obeisance is made to Rudra who is in Agni, who is in the waters, who has entered into the herbs and who has formed all these beings (VII. 87. 1). This verse occurs in AU. (VI) and also inŚU. (IL 17), where, however, it appears in a somewhat altered form, the word Devs being used instead of Rudra.</p>
<p>In describing a particular ox Mahādeva is spoken of as his two arms (IX. 7. 7). Bhava and Sarva are invoked to launch the lightning against the doer of wickedness (X. I. 23). They are called Bhūtapati (the lord of spirits) and Paśupati (the lord of beasts). (XI. 2. 1). They are reverenced as being in their domains in the sky and in the middle regions (XI. 2. 4). Five distinct species of animals, kine, horses, men, goats, and sheep, are marked off as belonging to Paśupati (XI. 2.9). To Ugra, the fierce, belong the four intermediate quarters, the sky, the earth, and the wide atmosphere, and that which has spirit and breathes on the earth (XI. 2. 10). Bhava sees everything on earth. Nothing is far or near to him. He destroys things in the farther ocean, being himself in the preceding ocean (XI. 2. 25). Rudra is implored not to bring on consumption, poison, and celestial fire (XI. 2. 26). Bhava is the lord (Īśa) of the heavens, the</p>
<p>earth, and fills the whole atmosphere (XI. 2. 27). Bhava is addressed as king (Rājan), (XI. 2. 28). A wish is expressed that the arrows of Bhava, Śarva, and Rudra, who is Paśupati ( the lord of beasts) may be always propitious (Sadāśiva ), (XL. 6. 9). Savitṛ is called Āryaman, Varuṇa, Rudra, and Mahādeva (XIII. 4. 4). All the stars and the moon are under Rudra&rsquo;s control (XIII. 4. 28). The gods made Bhava the archer, the protector of the Vrātyas, or outcasts, in the intermediate space of the eastern region, Śarva of the southern region, Paśupati of the western region. Ugra of the northern region, Rudra of the lower region, Mahādeva of the upper region, and Īśānaof all the intermediate regions (XV. 5.1-7).</p>
<p>§ 81. In SB. (VL 1.3.7) and KB. (6.1.9), Rudra is mentioned as the son of Uṣas; and, after he was born, Prajāpati gave him, as he grew up, eight names, seven of which are the same as those. given above from the AV. and the eighth is Aśani, or the thunderbolt. It would be seen that the AV. regards the seven as different though allied gods, though once Rudra is identified with Paśupati. As in the case of the sun-god, the several ways of looking at him gave rise to the conception of several sun-deities. such as Savitṛ, Sūrya, Mitra, Pūṣan, etc., so the same terrible and destructive agency in nature, with its benignant and gracious counterpart, looked at from different points of view, gave rise to the belief in the seven different gods mentioned in the AV. They are all regarded as the names of one god in the ŚB. and KB., and an eighth name is introduced. Of these eight names, four-Rudra, Śarva, Ugra and Aśani, are indicative of the destructive energy, and the other four, viz., Bhava, Paśupati, Mahādeva or Mahān devaḥ, and Īśāna of its beginant counterpart.</p>
<p>It will have been observed that the AV. brings in A Dew element, that of poisons, which the terrific god was believed to send forth and of his shafts being unfailing or the and unavoidable by gods and men. On the other, benignant side, Bhava is represented to be a shining king (Rājan). Rudra is the lord of all creatures. His range is far and wide. He controls the stars and the moon. He reigns in the sky and the middle regions. He is in fire and water, in plants and herbs, and in all beings; and he is the protector of Vrātyas in all quarters; and he is pre-eminently the ruler (Īśāna).</p>
<p>Thus the terrible and the destructive God became, when he was propitiated by men in a variety of ways, a benignant God and attained to the whole majesty of the godhead by the time of the YV. and AV., and it is on this majestic form of the god that the theosophic speculations of ŚU., which we will notice further on, are based.</p>
<p>§ 82. But the darker side of the nat are of this god was never forgotten. A sacrifice called Śūlagava is mentioned in most of the Gṛhyasūtras. A bull is sacrificed to Rudra to appease him. (AG. IV. 9). The rite should be performed beyond the limits. of a village, and its remains should not be brought into it, which rule sufficiently indicates the inauspicious character of the rite. The Vapā, or omentum, should be sacrificed to Rudra by uttering. twelve names, seven of which are the same as the first three in the first group given above, and the four in the second group. Aśani is omitted, and we have the following five additional names, Hara, Mṛḍa, Śiva, Bhīma, and Śaṁkara. Or the Vapāmay be thrown into the fire by uttering six specific names only or the single name Rudra. This Śūlagava sacrifice should be performed in a cow-shed when a cattle disease has to be averted. In PG. (III, 8) the names uttered in throwing the oblations are the wives, Indrāṇī, Rudrāṇī, Śarvāṇī, and Bhavānī. HG. (II. 3. 8) has the same deities as the eight above-mentioned, Bhīma being substituted for Aśani; and oblations are given to the wife of each by repeating the formula &quot; Bhavasya devasya patnyai svāhā&quot; (to the wife of God Bhava) etc.,and not by uttering their proper names.</p>
<p>Directions are given in PG. (III. 15) to render obeisance to Rudra and pray for safe conduct when traversing a path, coming to a place where four roads meat, crossing a river, getting into a ferry-boat, entering a forest, ascending a mountain, passing by a cemetery or by a cow-shed and such other places. Similarly HG.( I. 5. 16) directs that a traveller should adore Rudra by repeating the specific formula given by him, when he comes to the crossing. of four roads or to a heap of cattle-dung, when serpents creep, and when he is overtaken by tornado, or is entering a river, or comes to a variegated scene, sacrificial site or an old large tree.</p>
<p>It will thus be seen that, in the time of the Gṛhyasūtras, Rudra was still a terrible god, who had to be appeased. He was the god that held sway over regions away from home, over fields, wildernesses, cemeteries, mountains, old trees and rivers. Whenever a man came to anything which inspired awe and terror, Rudra was the god thought of and prayed to protect. Herein lies the reason which rendered him in later times the omnipresent supreme lord of the universe to the exclusion of all other Vedio gods except Viṣṇu. Many are the occasions in the life of man, which excite fear; there are epidemic and other diseases, poisons, serpents, storms, thunderbolts and wild and awful scenes, and consequently, the god who brings on these occasions, and protects when appeased, will be thought of oftener than other gods. The lovableness of the works of God, his greatness and majesty and his mysterious nature, are also matters which strike the mind of man; and these appear to have operated in bringing Viṣṇu into prominence.</p>
<p>What contributed to the formation of Vaiṣṇavism were the appearances and occurrences which excited love, admiration and a spirit of worship; while in Rudra-Śaivism the sentiment of fear is at the bottom, howsoever concealed it may have become in certain developments of it, and this sentiment it is that has worked itself out in the formation of various Rudra-Śaiva systems of later times. In the monotheistic religions of other countries. the same god is feared and loved; in India the god that is loved. in Viṣṇu-Nārāyaṇa-Vāsudeva-Kṛṣṇa, while the god that is feared. is Rudra-Śiva.</p>
<p>III. Śvetāśvatara and Atharvaśiras Upaniṣads.</p>
<p>§ 83. Before we proceed to the consideration of the Rudra-Śiva sects, we must devote some time to the consideration of a religio-philosophic treatise which represents the farthest point in the development of the idea of Rudra-Śiva god worshipped by the Indian Āryas generally. This is the Śvetāśvatara-Upaniṣad. It does not appear to be composed in a sectarian spirit. The elevated notions about the nature of God and his relations to man and the world, which had been reached in the time of the early Upaniṣads, have been disentangled from</p>
<p>their connection with the impersonal Brahman and transferred to the God who had at the time when the Upaniṣads were written, acquired a living and active personality in the minds of the people. This god was Rudra-Śiva, who, as we have seen, had by the time of AV. attained to the dignity of the supreme god.</p>
<p>After the preliminaries, the doctrinal points that occur in the first chapter are these: that there are three unborn. elements in the world of these the all-knowing and the ignorant, the ruler and the ruled, are two, and there is a third which has in itself materials of enjoyment and suffering (9). Brahman is of three kinds, viz., the sufferer or enjoyer, what is enjoyed or suffered, and the dispenser or mover. There is nothing further to be known (12). Pradhāna is changeable, the immortal is unchangeable; Hara, the one lord, rules over the changeable and the soul. By meditating on him, by devoting oneself to him, by realising him, the whole ignorance is dispelled (10). By making one&rsquo;s body the lower block of wood, the syllable &ldquo;Om&rdquo; the upper, and by the act of meditation, which is (like) the rubbing of the two blocks against each other, one should perceive the hidden god (14). One finds that soul in oneself who seeks him by means of truth and exertion, as oil in seeds, butter in curds, or water in a spring (15).</p>
<p>The three elements mentioned in 9 and 12 are adopted by Rāmānuja in his system, and these texts are quoted by writers of that school. What is set forth in the tenth is similar to that which occurs in the sixteenth and seventeeth verses of chap. 15 of the BhG.</p>
<p>In the second chapter there is first of all a short mention of the Yoga processes, which lead to the perception of the supreme soul and the purity of the self. When by the purified nature of the individual self, as by a lamp, is known the nature of Brahman, or the god who is unborn, unchangeable, pure in every way, one is free from all bondage (15). The chapter closes with the verse which we have noticed as occurring in the AV.</p>
<p>In the third chapter, we have in the beginning a stanza which sets forth that those become immortal who know him who possessing a net, rules by his ruling powers, rules over all the worlds by</p>
<p>his ruling powers, who alone is the cause of production and growth (1). There is only one Rudra—and they do not recognise another— who rules these worlds by his ruling powers, who is the inmost soul of all men, who contracts everything on the final day, and, creating all beings, protects them (2). He has his eyes everywhere, his face everywhere, as in RV. X. 81. 3 (3). May Rudra, the cause of the production and growth of the gods, the lord of the universe, the great prophet, and who formerly created Hiraṇyagarbha, endow us with a holy will (4). Then follow two verses from the Śatarudriya, praying Rudra to look at the singer with his gracious countenance and not to do harm to men, etc. (5, 6). Knowing the lord (Īśa), who is the highest Brahman and the greatest of all, who dwells in the inside of all beings whatever their form, and who encompasses the whole universe, men become immortal (7). Then follow similar verses expressive of the attributes of the supreme God and prescribing a knowledge of him as the door to immortality.</p>
<p>As formerly remarked<sup id="fnref1:71"><a href="#fn:71" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">71</a></sup>,a verse and a half in this chapter occurs word for word in the thirteenth chap, of the BhG. It also deserves remark that the proper names of the supreme being that occur are Īśāna, Īśa, and Śiva, and the epithet Bhāgavat, that is used also, deserves notice (11, 12, 15, 17, 20). In verso 20, which occurs also in the MU., there is Īśam for Ātmanaḥwhich is indicative of the peculiarity of this Upaniṣadwhich we have noticed. There are two verses from the Puruṣasūkta (RV. X. 90),</p>
<p>The fourth chapter opens with the expression of the desire that he who, himself being without form, creates many forms with a certain purpose, in whom in the end as well as in the beginning the universe exists, may endow the adorers with a holy will. Then follows the identification of this supreme soul with fire, sun, wind, moon and a variety of other objects (2-4). We have then the metaphor of one male goat lying down with the female goat and another male goat abandoning her after enjoyment, which represents the soul in the worldly and the delivered conditions (5).</p>
<p>We have next the verse about two birds, the friends and companions of each other, resting on the same tree, one eating the fruit of that tree, and the other simply looking on without eating, which occurs in the RV. (I. 164. 20) and in the MU. (III. 1. 1). The next verse about the weak soul being deluded and in grief and being delivered from his sorrows when he sees the other. soul, who is the ruler (Īśa), occurs in the MU. also (III. 1. 2) but not in the RV.</p>
<p>After two verses there is another, in which Māyā is called Prakṛti and he who uses this Māyā is called Maheśvara (10). Maheśvara is a name of Śiva. Having known the boon-giver, Īśāna, who presides over every productive organ and in whom and from whom are all things, one attains eternal peace or serenity (11) Then there is a repetition here of a verse in the previous chapter (III4), with an unimportant difference of reading (12). Then occurs the second part of the verse in IV., which represents Hiraṇyagarbha to be the lord of two-footed and four-footed animals (X. 121.3), the first part of the latter being paraphrased here (13). This verse was probably suggested by the occurrence of the name of Hiraṇyagarbha in the previous verse.</p>
<p>Having known Śiva (the auspicious), who is minuter than the minute, the creator of the universe, of many forms, and who alone encompasses the universe in this medley of the world, one attains eternal peace (14). That same lord of the universe concealed in all objects is the protector of the world in time. Devoting themselves to him and knowing him thus, the Brahmarṣis and the deities out away nooses of death (15). Knowing Śiva, concealed in all beings, who is as subtle as the essence of milk, other than the butter, knowing the god who alone encompasses the universe, one is free from all nooses (16). This god—this great soul—whose work is the universe always dwells in the hearts of men. He is determined by the heart, the intelligence, and internal consciousness; those who know this become immortal (17).</p>
<p>When there was simple darkness and no. day or light, no entity or non-entity, Śiva alone existed. He was the one unchangeable thing, and he was the bright light of the sun,</p>
<p>and from him sprang all intelligence (18). Here appears anides similar to that expressed in RV. X. 129. No one can seize. him above, transversely or in the middle. There is not another like him. Great is his glory (19). His form is invisible. Nobody sees him with the eye. Those who see him, dwelling in the heart, by the heart and the internal consciousness, become immortal (20). This verse is the same as in KU. (VI.9), excepting in the third. line, which there is the same as the third line of v. 17 above. The chapter ends with two verses containing a prayer to Rudra to proteot, the latter of which is the same as RV. I. 114. 8.</p>
<p>In the first verse of the fifth chapter are mentioned two indestructible beings, Brahman and the other, who are endless, in whom there lie, unobserved, knowledge and ignorance. Ignorance is destructible, knowledge is indestructible; and there is another who rules over knowledge and ignorance (1). In the next verse is mentioned the birth of Kapila and his being fed with knowledge. by him who presides over every productive energy (2). Giving various forms to each group (lit. net), the god resolves everything into the original principle. Creating again the lords of beings, he, the great soul, the ruler, wields sovereignty over all (3). As the sun illuminates all quarters, upper and lower and transversal, so also the god, the Bhagavat, presides over the natures of all productive energies (4). The original cause of the world makes natural powers develop, and brings to a mature condition those who are capable of development. He presides over this universe and puts into operation all the qualities (5). That is concealed in Upanisads, which contain the secret of the Vedas. That origin of Brahman, Brahmadeva knows All the ancient gods and Ṛṣis, who knew that, being absorbed in it, became immortal (6).</p>
<p>The Upaniṣad then proceeds to mention the individual soul, the lord of the vital airs, who performs actions and enjoys or suffers. their fruit, possesses three qualities and follows three ways, and gues through a succession of births in consequence of his actions (7). He is as big as the thumb, bright like the sun, is conscious of himself, and wills, is as minute as the hundredth part of the hundredth part of the point of a bair, and is ondless. In himself he is not a female nor a male nor sexless. This depends on the body assumed by him (8, 9, 10). He assumes many gross and</p>
<p>subtle forms in accordance with his qualities and the qualities of his actions and of the self. But he who effects their union, is another (12). Then follows a verse similar to IV. 14 and the latter part of 16 (13). In the last verse Śiva, the God, the creator and destroyer, is said to bo knowable by Bhāva faith, love, or the pure heart (14).</p>
<p>The sixth chapter appears to be a sort of resumé of what precedes. Among other things it is stated that he who promotes virtue and dispels sin, should be known as existing in oneself (6); that the one God is concealed in all beings, is all-pervading, the internal soul of all beings, presiding over all actions, the support of all beings, the witness of all, the life-giver, absolute and without qualities (11); and that, knowing the cause which is to be understood by means of the Saṁkhya and the Yoga, a man is freefrom all nooses (13).</p>
<p>After this follows a verse to the effect: &quot; nor the sun nor the moon nor the stars nor lightning illuminate him (i. e., make him known); when he shines, everything shines after him, and by his light all this is rendered visible, or is illuminated &ldquo;(14). This verse occurs in KU. (V. 15) and in MU. (II. 2. 10). The work ends with an expression of the author&rsquo;s self-surrender to the god, who shines forth in one&rsquo;s own intelligence, who first created Brahmadeva, and who sent forth the Vedas—the god who has no parts, who does not suffer change, who is all peace, has no defects and is unpolluted, the bridge for crossing over to immortality, and who is like fire that has burnt fuel (18. 19).</p>
<p>§ 84. From this short summary, it will be seen that this Upaniṣad contains verses from the Saṁhitās of the RV. and YV. and others, which must have been in a floating condition, and were appropriated by the Muṇḍaka and Kaṭha Upaniṣads as well as by this; and a great many others, which have not been traced elsewhere, are original. All these contain truths about the nature of God, the individual soul and the inanimate world and the relations between them. The way to redemption is meditation. on the Supreme Soul, which way is characteristic of the Upaniṣad. doctrine in general. Certain Yoga processes are prescribed to reuder this meditation effective, and the final result is a perception of the Supreme Soul as existing everywhere, and this perception constitutes eternal bliss.</p>
<p>This treatise contains the theism of the Upaniṣad</p>
<p>period in its most mature form with a God distinctly personal at the centre. The attributes of the Supreme Soul are often given in very general terms, and he is referred to by the non-sectarian general name Deva, but as ofton that Deva is identified with Rudra, Śiva, Īśāna and Maheśvara, and his powers are spoken of as Īśānīs; but there is no indication whatever that these names have been given. for the purpose of raising Rudra-Śiva to the supreme godhead to the exclusion of another god. Names indicative of Rudra-Śiva appear to have been used, since he was invested with a personality perceived and acknowledged by all. This Upaniṣad, therefore, is not a sectarian treatise like others promulgated in later times, and is often quoted by Śaṁkarācārya, Rāmānuja and other writers of the different schools, and not by those of one schoolonly.</p>
<p>It must have been composed before the BhG., since the latter contains, as already stated<sup id="fnref1:72"><a href="#fn:72" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">72</a></sup>, a verse and a half from it, and the nature of the religio-philosophic speculations contained in it, though essentially Upaniṣadic, make a nearer approach to the later Bhakti School than those of any of the older treatises of the class. The description of the godhead and of the final pure serenity are instinct with the glow of love and admiration, and the treatise ends with an expression of self-surrender to the god, who makes himself manifest in one&rsquo;s own intelligence. The Śvetāśvatara-Upaniṣad, therefore, stands at the door of the Bhakti School, and pours its loving adoration on Rudra-Śivainstead of on Vāsudeva-Krṣṇa, as the BhG. did in later times when full swing. Vāsudeva-Kṛṣṇa the Bhakti doctrine was in full swing. had a historic basis; and the circumstances which led to his being invested with the supreme godhesd, occurred in later times, while in the age, in which the Śvetiśvatare-Upaniṣad was composed, Rudra-Śiva was alone in the field as the supreme god, and the germs of Bhakti, or love, which manifested themselves at the time,were directed towards him; but when Vāsudeva-Kṛṣṇa also came into the field, he appealed more to the hearts of men as the</p>
<p>god who had come to dwell amongst them; consequently the germs of Bhakti speedily developed, and he became the object of the heightened feelings in preference to the other.</p>
<p>Umā-Haimavatī.</p>
<p>§ 85. Up to the time at which we have arrived, we meet with no mention of the wife of Rudra or Śiva, but in the Kena-Upaniṣad, which is certainly one of the earlier Upanişads, the name of Umāoccurs. She is called Haimavatī, or the daughter of Himavat, but she is not mentioned in the KnU, as the wife of Rudra or Śiva, though in later times she was known to be so. The story is Brahman conquered the enemies of the gods for them, but the gods took credit to themselves for the victory and were proud of their achievements. Agni, Vāyu and Indra were sitting together, engaged in joyous conversation, when there appeared at some distance a spirit. Agni first went out to see what it was. The spirit asked him the nature and extent of his power and laid down a blade of grass, which it asked him to burn away. Agni was not able to do this and returned bafilled. Then went Vāyu, who also was not able to blow away the blade of grass; afterwards. went Indra, and at his approach the spirit disappeared. Indra was disappointed, but he saw a beautiful woman of the name of Umā-Haimavatī and asked her who the spirit was. She said it was Brahman. The story represents that condition of things, in which the old Vedio gods had lost their power or hold over men, and Brahman had come into prominence as the supreme spirit. Since it was Umā that disclosed the nature of the spirit. It may be understood that the Brahman mentioned was Rudra-Śiva and Umā was his wife. It would thus appear that she had come to be so regarded some time before the Upanṣiad was composed.</p>
<p>§86. The Atharvaśiras is another Upaniṣad appertaining to Rudra. It is a much later work as is shown even by the very variant texts before me, commented on by Nārāyaṇa and Śaṁkarānanda. The gods, it is said, went to heaven and asked Rudra who he was. He said that he alone was, is, or will be, and nothing else. He is in all the quarters, he is Gāyatrī, man, woman, etc., and thus a number of things are mentioned with which he is identical. Then Rudra was invisible to them, and they raised. their arms and praised him saying: &ldquo;He who is Rudra, is</p>
<p>Bhagavat, and who also is Brahimadeva, a how to him&rdquo;. In the similar sentences that follow, instead of Brahmadeva we have. Viṣṇu, Maheśvara, Umā, Skanda, Vināyaka, etc. The sun and the constellation are also included. Then Oṁkāra is mentioned. to which many epithets and opithets of epithets expressive of divine attributes are given, and lastly it is called the one Rudra who is Īśāna, Bhagavat, Maheśvara and Mahādeva, Then follow the etymologies of the epithets or names. The only Rudra he is called, because he alone creates and absorbs everything. He is called Īśāna, because he rules by the powers called the Īśānīs. Then follow four or five verses from SU. with different readings. In some cases.</p>
<p>The substance of what follows is thus given by Śaṁkarānanda. For the knowledge of Rudra one should use moderate food, devote himself to reading (Śravaṇa), thinking (Manana), etc., become a Paramahaṁsa, or a single-minded devotee, and spend his time thus. One should undertake the Pāśupata vow (Vrata), which is of the following nature. Greed and anger should be given up. Forgiveness should be realised. The muttering of Om should be practised, and meditation resulting in Avagati, or perception, should be resorted to. The text, of which this is the explanation, may be generally rendered thus:— &quot; In the inside of the heart exists the subtle body, in which there. are anger, greed and forgiveness. Destroying greed, which is at the bottom of human motives, and concentrating the mind on Rudra, who is one and eternal, one should be moderate in cating and drinking &ldquo;. Then follows a precept to besmear the body. with ashes by repeating the words: &quot; The ash is fire, the ash is water, the ash is earth, everything is ash, the ether is ash, the mind, the eyes and other senses are ash.&rdquo; This is the Pāśupata vow (Vrata), enjoined for the removal of the noose with which the Paśu, or the individual soul, is tied.</p>
<p>Here the besmearing of the body with ashes after repeating a formula, or Mantra, is prescribed as a vow for the devotees of Paśupati, or Rudra-Śiva, calculated to effect a deliverance from the trammels of life. The expression &quot; Paśupāśavimokṣaṇa which means the loosening of the noose tied round the necks of beings, is a characteristic of the Pāśupata sect. This Upaniṣad</p>
<p>therefore belongs to that sect. Before, however, we pass on to the consideration of this sect, we must cast a glance at the position which Rudra-Śiva holds in the Mahābhārata.</p>
<p><strong>IV. Rudra-Śiva in the Mahābhārata and Liṅga Worship.</strong></p>
<p>§ 87. At the beginning of the Bhīṣmaparvan Kṛṣṇa advises Arjuna to make an obeisance to Durgābefore the commencement of the battle and pray for success. Arjuna does so after repeating a hymn in honour of Durgā, containing the names of Umā, mother of Skanda, Kātyāyanī, Karālīand a number of others. In the Vanaparvan Arjuna is represented to have gone to the Himālaya and practised austerities there. Some time after, Śiva appears dressed like a Kirāta, and a severe fight ensues between them. Arjuna is overpowered in the end and lies on the ground exhausted. He then praises Śiva, and, having made an altar of earth, puts flowers on it in the name of Śaṁkara. These, however, appear as placed on the head of the Kirāta, whereupon Arjuna makes him out as Śiva the object of his adoration, and surrenders himself to him. Śiva becomes pleased and offers him whatever he wishes. Arjuna asks for the weapon presided over by Paśupati (Pāśupatāstra), which possesses the power of destroying all formidable enemies (chaps. 38-40).</p>
<p>In the Droṇaparvan again, (chaps. 80-81) the attainment. of the Pāśupatāstra, which appears to be of another kind, consisting of a bow and arrow, by Arjuna, is mentioned. Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa are spoken of as having gone to the Himālaya in a vision and seen Śaṁkara at his dwelling. They bow their heads before him, sing a hymn in his praise, in which they call him the unborn, the creator of the universe, the unchangeable and utter the names which we have given as occurring in earlier works, and thus propitiating him ask for the Pāśupata weapon. They are directed to a lake where the Astra bad been thrown. There they saw two venomous serpents, which, however, assumed at the time the forms of a bow and an arrow, and these Arjuna took away.</p>
<p>In the Sauptikaparvan (chap. 7) Aśvatthāman is mentioned to have propitiated Śaṁkaraand obtained a sword from him. Śiva himself enters into his body, and Aśvatthāman</p>
<p>carries havoc and destruction with the terrible sword in the camp of the Pāṇḍus, killing all their progeny, and even Dhṛṣṭadyumna, who had cut off the head of his father Droṇa. Yudhiṣṭhira asksKṛṣṇa says that he did. Kṛṣṇa how he was able to effect all this. it through the power of Śaṁkara and relatos another story about him. Brahmadeva once told Śaṁkara not to create. WhereuponŚaṁkara concealed himself under water for a long time. When, therefore, there was no creation for such a long period, Brahmadeva created another Prajāpati, who brought into existence a large number of beings. These beings, being afflicted with hunger, went to Prajāpati to devour him. He, being afraid, went to Hiraṇyagarbha, who created two kinds of food for those beings and then they were quicted. After some time Mahādeva rose out of the water, and seeing that new beings had been created and were in a flourishing condition, he cut off his organ of generation as no more necessary, and it stuck into the ground. He then went away to perform austerities at the foot of the Muñjavat mountain.</p>
<p>There is a similar story about Mahādeva&rsquo;s having ceased to create and become a Yogin in the Vāyu Purāṇa (chap.10). Brahmadeva told Nīlalohita (Mahādeva) to create, and bringing to mind his wife Satī, he created thousands of beings exactly like. himself, who were immortal. Thereupon he stopped and rendered himself incapable of procreation. He then resorted to all those processes of the Yoga, which in the Purāṇa is called the PāśupataYoga.</p>
<p>In the Sauptikaparvan, Kṛṣṇa continues the story of Mahādeva and tells Yudhiṣṭhira that when the gods created the rite of sacrifice and assigned no oblation to Rudra, he was full of wrath and destroyed the sacrifice; whereupon they assigned him a portion and the god was pleased.</p>
<p>In the Anuśāsanaparvan (chap. 14),Kṛṣṇa is introduced as recounting the glories of Mahādeva. He says, Jāmbavatī, one of his wives, expressed a desire for as good a son as Rukmiṇī, his chief consort, had. To procure such a son he had recourse to Mahādeva, through whose favour only his wishes could be fulfilled. He then went to the Himālaya, on which Śiva lived. On the way he saw the hermitage of Upamanyu. Upamanyu</p>
<p>enters into a long discourse on the beneficent deeds of Mahādeva. A list is given of persons, including many Daityas, who obtained their desired objects, such as sons, weapons, powers, etc., through the favour of Mahādeva, whom they had propitiated by rigid austere practices and other ways. One of these was Śākalya, to whom was granted the boon that he would be an author and would obtain immortal glory, and his son would be the composer of Sūtras. The persons alluded to here must be the compiler of the RVS.. and the author of the Pāda text. Upamanyu began to practise austerities to propitiate Śiva at the instance of his mother, who, in describing the god&rsquo;s power and beneficence, spoke of him as dancing nakedly and of his having the quarters for his clothing (Digvāsas). In the course of his austerities, Mahādeva, to test Upamanyu&rsquo;s devotion, appears before him in the form of Indra, and offers him many magnificent boons, which Upamanyu refuses, and declares that he would have boons from Śaṁkara alone, and that he would become a worm or a butterfly at the command of Śaṁkara, but did not desire. even the sovereignty of the three worlds given by Indra. In the course of his narrative, Upamanyu says that Mahādeva was the only god, whose organ of generation (Liṅga) is worshipped by men. Heand Umã were the real creators of animals, as these bear the marks of the two, and not the discus or the conch-shell or marks of any other god. Eventually Śiva and Umãappeared before Upamanyu, seated on a strong towering ox, attended on the one side by Brahmadeva seated on the swan, his vehicle, and on the other, by Nārāyaṇa on Garuḍa with the conch-shell, lotus, etc., and conferred on him all the blessings he desired. At his instance Kṛṣṇa also entered on a long course of austerities, at the end of which Mahādeva with Umā appeared before him in the same manner as they did to Upamanyu. The god conferred eight boons upon him, and his consort eight more; besides she promised him sixteen thousand wives. and altogether the number of boons he obtained was twenty-four inclusive of the birth of such a son as he wanted.</p>
<p>§ 88. The characteristics of Śiva, or Mahādeva, as brought. out by these accounts appear to be these. He was a powerful, wrathful and impetuous god, but generous and bountiful, and</p>
<p>spared nothing when he was propitiated. Whenever a man conceived a desire for anything, he was the god to be appealed to for its fulfilment. He lived on the Himālaya with his wife Umā, Pārvatī, or Durgā, who had a number of other names such as Kalī, Karālī, etc., and was attended by a number of beings called. his Gaṇas or hosts. His vehicle was an I. He had, of course, all the attributes of the supreme godhead. He is represented as having betaken himself to the process of Yoga or contemplation, when he had ceased to be creative.</p>
<p>It will be seen that the object of worship in Śaivism is the Liṅga, or phallus. We have found no trace of this characteristic in the earlier literature, so far as we have examined it¹, and the first time we meet with it is in this passage from the Anuśāsanaparvan. We have had occasion in a previous section<sup id="fnref1:73"><a href="#fn:73" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">73</a></sup> to remark that Rudra-Śiva had a close connection with stragglers in the forest, with Vrātyas, or those who were not included in the Aryan community, and with the wild tribe of the Niṣādas, and also that the gods of these last were amalgamated with Rudra. Rudra&rsquo;s partiality for serpents and his being the lord of spirits or Bhūtas, were probably due to the influence of the serpent-worship and the devilry of the savage tribes.</p>
<p>There are two places in the RV., in one of which Indra is prayed to not to allow those whose god is Śiśna, to disturb the rites of the singers (VII. 24. 5); and in another he is represented. to have conquered the riches of a city after killing those whose god is Śiśna. Here evidently those whose god was Siśna, or phallus, are meant as the enemies of the Vedic Aryas, who disturbed their holy rites. Notwithstanding all that is said about the matter, my own belief is that the persons here referred to were really some tribe of the aborigines of the country, who worshipped. the phallus. Just then, as the Rudra-Śiva cult borrowed several elements from the dwellers in forests and stragglers in places outof the way, so it may have borrowed this element of phallicworship from the barbarian tribes with whom the Āryas came in contact. This element, however, does not appear to have come. in all at once, especially among the learned classes, whose beliefs. are represented in the literature which we have examined.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.I do not, however, deny the possibility that when the ŚU. in IV. 11 speaks. of the god Īśāna as presiding over every Yoni, und in V. 2, of the lord as presiding over all forms and Yonis, an allusion to the physical fact of the Liṅga and Yoni connected together, may have been meant as typifying the philosophical doctrine of gods presiding over every creative cause.</p>
<p>The Liṅga worship had, it appears, not come into use at the time. of Patañjali; for, the instance he gives under P.V. 3.99, is that of an image or likeness (Pratikṛti) of Śiva as an object of worship, and 2001 not of any emblem of that god. It seems to have been unknown. oven in the time of Wema-Kadphises, for, on the reverse of his coins, there is a human figure of Śiva with a trident in the hand; and there is also an emblem, but it is Nandin or the bull, and not a Liṅga or phallus. But this element must have crept in early enough among ordinary people, who were in closer communication with the uncivilised tribes, and gradually made its way to the higher classes, of whose creed it subsequently became an article. And it is this final stage of its adoption by the higher classes that is represented in Upamanyu&rsquo;s discourse in the Mahābhārata.</p>
<p>From all that we have brought forward from the post-Saṁhitāliterature, it will appear that Rudra-Śiva was a deity whose. worship was common to all Āryas, and who was not at first a sectarian god. As above remarked<sup id="fnref1:74"><a href="#fn:74" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">74</a></sup>,he was in charge of the field before the Vaiṣṇava or Vāsudevic deities came in to contest his supremacy. The Gṛhyasūtras, which, as we have seen, give directions as to the adoration of Rudra under various circumstances, cannot be considered as belonging to any Śaiva sect. In the time of Patañjali, images of Śiva, Skanda and Viśākha. made sometimes of precious metals, were kept for common worship by certain religious persons who derived an income from them<sup id="fnref1:75"><a href="#fn:75" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">75</a></sup>. The images of Śiva here alluded to cannot have been meant for the use of a particular sect.</p>
<p>V. Origin and Diffusion of the Śaiva Sects and the<br>
Several Classes of Śiva Worshippers.</p>
<p>§ 89, A Śaiva sect is, however, mentioned even by Patañjali. The members of it were known as Śivabhāgavatas, or devotees of Śiva, the Bhagavat, Śiva, we have seen, is called Bhagavat in AU.—A Śivabhāgavata carried in his hand an iron lance as an omblem of the deity he worshipped (under P. V. 2. 76).</p>
<p>In the Nārāyaṇīya section of MBh., the Pāśupata is mentioned.as one of five schools of religious doctrines (Śāntiparvan, chap. 349, v. 64). Śiva-Śrīkaṇṭha, the consort of Umā, the lord of spirits and the son of Brahmadeva, is represented to have revealed the tenets of that school (verse 67). Whether this statement is to be understood in the sense that its founder was a human being. afterwards recognized as an incarnation of Śiva, or whether it is a mere general statement like that contained in the BU. (II. 4. 10) that the Ṛgveda, Yajurveda, etc., are the breath of this great. being, meaning nothing more historically than that the system. gradually came into existence, without any special individual being concerned with it, is a question somewhat difficult to answer definitely; but there is evidence in the Purāṇas and Inscriptions, of the existence of a belief in favour of the first supposition.</p>
<p>The Vāyu-Purāṇa(chap. 23) and the Liṅga-Purāṇa (chap. 24). represent Maheśvara to have told Brahmadeva that when, at the time of Kṛṣṇa-Dvaipāyana during the twenty-eighth repetition of the Yugas, Vāsudeva, the best of Yadus, would be born of Vāsudeva, he would incarnate himself as a Brahmacārin by the name of Lakulin after entering a dead body thrown into &amp; cemetery; the place where this would occur, would be called Kāyāvatāra or Kāyāvarohaṇa, and he would have four pupils of the names of Kuśika, Garga, Mitra and Kauruṣya. These Pāśupatas, with their bodies sprinkled with ashes, resorting to the Yoga of Maheśvara, would in the end go to the world of Rudra.</p>
<p>Now, in an Inscription in the temple of Nātha near that of Ekalingii,14 miles to the north of Udaipur, Rajputana, it is stated that Śiva became incarnate &amp;s a man with a club (Lakula) in his hand, in the country of Bhṛgukaccha, being propitiated by Bhṛgu. Sages, Kuśika and others, conversant with the Pāśupata Yoga, and using ashes and wearing bark-dress and matted hair, are mentioned.</p>
<p>There is another Inscription, usually called the CintraPraśasti, which states that Śiva became incarnate in the form of Bhaṭṭāraka Śrī-Lakulīśa, and dwelt at Kārohaṇa in the Lāṭa country. There appeared in bodily form four pupils of his of the names of Kuśika, Gärgya, Kauruṣa and Maitreya for the strict performance of the Pāśupata vows, and they became originators of four branches. The date of the first Inscription is Vikrama 1028, or 971 A. D., and the second was composed between A. D. 1274 and 1296. In another Inscription dated 943 A. D., found at Hemāvatīin the Sira Taluka, Mysore, Lakulīśa is represented to have been born again as Muninātha Chilluka to preserve the memory of his name and doctrines<sup id="fnref1:76"><a href="#fn:76" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">76</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Mādhava calls the Pāśupata system that he explains in his Sarvadarśanasaṁgraha, Nakulīśa-Pāśupata, and quotes a few words from what appears to be a work attributed to him. From all this it appears that there lived a certain person, of the name of Lakulin (the holder of a Lakuṭa, or Laguḍa, or Lakula, i. e., a club) who founded a Pāśupata system. Four schools sprang out of it, and their reputed founders, whether historical or legendary, were considered his pupils. Lakulin ist the same as Nakulin, and the fact that his rise has been represented by the Purāṇas to be contemporaneous with Vāsudeva-Kṛṣṇa, points to the inference that traditionally the system was intended. to take the same place in the Rudra-Śiva cult that the Pāñcarātra did in the Vāsudeva-Kṛṣṇacult. We may, therefore, place the rise of the Pāśupata school mentioned in the Nārāyaṇīya about a century after that of the Pāñcarātra system, i. e., about the second century B. C.</p>
<p>§ 90. Before we proceed further, we will notice the extent of the diffusion of the creed. At the end of the commentary on the Vaiśeṣikasūtras, the author Prśsastapāda ntakes his obeisance to Kaṇāda, the author of the Sūtras, and characterises him as having composed the Vaiśeṣikasūtras after propitiating Maheśvara by the</p>
<p>greatness of his Yoga (meditation or concentration), and Ācāra (practice). These two ways are common to both the Pāśupata and Śaiva systems, as will be seen hereafter, and Kaṇāda, therefore, may have been a follower of the Pāśupata or Śaiva system. Bhāradvāja, the author of the Uddyota, or a gloss on Vātsyāyana&rsquo;s Nyāyabhaṣya, is called Pāśupatācārya, or a teacher belonging to the Pāśupata school, at the end of his work.</p>
<p>Wema Kadphises, a powerful prince of the Kuṣanarace, who ruled over a large part of Northwestern India about the middle of the third century A. D., styles himself on the reverse of his coins a devotee of Maheśvara or a member of the Maheśvara sect, and image of Nandin and another of Śivawith a trident in his hand occur on the obverse. Varāhamihira in the latter part of the sixth century, lays down the rule that the priests to be employed for the installation of an image of Śaṁbhu, should be Brāhmaṇas besmearing their bodies. with ashes. By these he means members of a Śaiva sect, since, in the case of other gods, the names mentioned are those of the sects founded in the names of those gods.</p>
<p>Haribhadra, an old Jaina author, speaks in his Ṣaḍdarśanasamuccaya, of the schools of Gotama and Kaṇāda as professing the Śaiva faith. But his commentator Guṇaratna, (who flourished. in the latter part of the fourteenth century<sup id="fnref1:77"><a href="#fn:77" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">77</a></sup>), calls the Vaiśeṣikās Pāśupatas and the other school Śaivas. This last must be a mistake, since Bhāradvāja of the Nyāya school is specifically spoken of as a Pāśupatācārya, as we have seen.</p>
<p>The Chinese traveller Hiuen-Tsiang in the middle of the seventh century mentions the Pāśupatas twelve times in in his book. In some places he saysthat there were temples of Maheśvara at which the Pāśupatas worshipped; in one or two temples, he says that they resided. And at Benares he found about ten thousand sectaries who honoured Maheśvara, besmeared their bodies with ashes, went naked and tied their hair. in knots. These and those who lived in temples must have been like the Bairāgis, or ascetics, of modern times, who had given up the world; but probably the others mentioned by him were the</p>
<p>followers of the Pāśupata faith who lived the ordinary life of householders.</p>
<p>In the copper-plate charter of Nāgavardhana, nephew of Pulakeśin II of Mahārāṣṭra, who ascended the throne in 610 A. D., and was living in 639 A. D., a grant is recorded of a village near Igatpuri in the Nasik District for the worship of the god Kāpāleśvara i. e., the lord of the wearers of garlands of skulls, and for the maintenance of the Mahāvratins residing in the temple. It will hereafter be shown that the name Mahāvratin, or observer of the grent vow designated the Kāpālikas or Kālāmukhas. Thus there. is evidence of the existence in the middle of the seventh centuryof the sect of Kāpālikas in Mahārāṣṭra<sup id="fnref1:78"><a href="#fn:78" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">78</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In the Karhad grant of Kṛṣṇa III of the Rāṣtrakūṭadynasty, the king mentions his having granted in Śaka 880 (=958 A. D.), a village to Gaganaśiva, the practiser of great austerities, who was fully versed in all the Śivasiddhāntas and was the pupil of Īśānaśiva, who was an Ācārya, or preceptor, and the head of the establishment at Valkaleśvara in Karahāṭa. These holy men and their establishment seem to have belonged to the Śaiva sect and not to the Pāśupata. The evidence for the existence of Kālāmukha and Śaiva sects in Mysore, in the latter part of the twelfth century, will be given in the next section.</p>
<p>Here it seems necessary to make another distinction. Bāṇa in the Kādambarīrepresents Pāśupatas with red clothing to have been among those who waited to see Tārāpīda&rsquo;s minister Śukanāsa at the door of his house for some private purposes of their own; but in another place he represents Vilāsavatī, the queen of Tārāpīda, to have gone to the temple of Mahākālaon the fourteenth (of the dark half of the month) to worship the god. Bhavabhūti In the Mālatīmādhava (Act III) represents Mālatīto have gone with her mother to the temple of Śaṁkara on the fourteenth of the dark half of the month. This fourteenth day still continues to be sacred to Śiva when special worship is performed. Now Vilāsavatīand Mālatīand her mother can hardly have been meant to be members of that sect, some followers of which with a red clothing were waiting at Śukanāsa&rsquo;s door. It, therefore, appears to be clear that all worshippers of Śiva were not members of any of those</p>
<p>sects the names of which have come down to us, as observed in a previous section.</p>
<p>Rudra-Śiva had gradually from the earliest times grown to be a god commonly worshipped by the Indians, and he has continued. to be their ordinary god to this day. The sects that subsequently arose were based upon specific methods of redemption, when religious and philosophic thought was advancing or perhaps declining, but the old god was resorted to by ordinary people without reference to them. And it must be remarked that those sects must have had. a clerical or ascetic, class as well as a class of lay followers or householders—and probably in some cases at least Hiuen. Tsiang means these last by his Pāśupatas—and a class of Śaiva religious men, as distinct from lay followers, existed in Karahāṭaas we have noticed.</p>
<p>There were thus three classes of Śiva worshippers :—(1) clericals or ascetics, (2) their lay followers, and (3) ordinary people who had no particular connection with any sect. The poets Kālīdasa, Subandhu, Bāṇa, Śrī-Harṣa, Bhaṭṭa-Nārāyaṇa, Bhavabhūti and several others adore Śiva at the beginning of their works. They may have been the lay followers of any of the sects, but, in all likelihood, they belong to the third class. For of these Subandhu, Bāṇa and Bhaṭṭa-Nārāyaṇa invoke Hari or another form of Viṣṇuat the same time, thus showing that they were not exclusive adherents of one of the two gods. The many temples of Śiva constructed by the early Cālukyas and the Rāṣṭrakūṭas, and the Kailāsa and other cave temples at Ellora excavated by the latter, contain no indication of their being intended for a specific Śaiva sect, and therefore they may be regarded as pointing to the diffusion of the general worship of Śiva in Mahārāṣṭra from the seventh to the tenth century.</p>
<p><strong>VI. Names and Doctrines of the Śaiva Sects.</strong></p>
<p>§ 91. The older Śaiva sects had and have a literature of their own, the so-called Āgamas attributed to Śiva himself, and a number of works by human authors. But the literature has not yet been published nor even discovered. I bave, therefore, necessarily to resort to the stray notices about the sects and their</p>
<p>doctrines, contained in works not written by the followers of the systems except in one case. With the more modern sects. the case is different, their literature having recently become. available.</p>
<p>Śaṁkara says that the Māheśvaras maintain that Paśupati has revealed five topics (Br. S. II. 2. 37). Thus the sects were. known by the general name of Māheśvara, and Paśupati, or the god Śiva, was believed to be their founder. Rāmānuja under the same Sūtra, which, however, is numbered 35, speaks of the systems as the tenets of Paśupati. Keśava Kāśmīrin calls the sects the followers of the &ldquo;tenets of Paśupati.&rdquo; Śrīkaṇṭha-Śivācārya calls them the &ldquo;believers in the Āgamas revealed by Parameśvara, or the great god&rdquo;. The name Māheśvara is the old name as is evident from the fact that Wema-Kadphises, as noticed above, and several later princes, especially of the Valabhīdynasty, called. themselves Māheśvaras. Hiuen Tsiang, too, as we have seen, mentions temples of Maheśvara, at which the Pāśupatas worshipped. It also follows that all these sects were at the same time known by the name of Pāśupata sects; and the founder of them all was believed to be the god Paśupati.</p>
<p>The same conclusion is to be deduced from the Mysore Inscriptions that have been published, the only difference being that the original teacher is called Lakulin or Lakulīśa. In one Inscription dated 943 A. D., referred to above, it is stated that Lakulīśa, being afraid that his name and doctrines would be forgotten, became incarnate as Muninātha Cilluks<sup id="fnref1:79"><a href="#fn:79" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">79</a></sup>.&rdquo;). This appears to be a general name applicable to all systems. In another dated 1078 A. D. one ascetic is called an ornament to the Lākula school and another is spoken of as &ldquo;a hand to Lākula&rdquo;<sup id="fnref1:80"><a href="#fn:80" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">80</a></sup>. This appears to be the general name and does not point to a specific sect. In a third dated 1103 A. D. Someśvara-Sūri ist spoken of as having caused the Lākula doctrine (Siddhānts) to bloom. He is called a Naiyãyikaand Vaīśeṣika<sup id="fnref1:81"><a href="#fn:81" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">81</a></sup>.&quot;). This shows</p>
<p>that he belonged to the specific Pāśupata seot. In a fourth dated 1177 A. D. certain ascetics are called upholders of the Lākulāgamasamaya, i. e., the system based upon a work of Lākulin, and adherents of Kālāmukhas<sup id="fnref1:82"><a href="#fn:82" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">82</a></sup>.&quot;).Here evidently the Kālāmukhas are called Lākulas, which is the same as Pāśupatas. The names of the ascetics mentioned in this Inscription end in the word śakti and jīya, which appear to be characteristic of the Kālāmukha sect. In a fifth dated 1183 A. D. is noticed a grant to Nāgaśiva-Paṇḍita, who is called an upholder of the Lākula system, and the names of his preceptors in the two preceding generations end in the suffix śiva. Nagaśiva is praised for emipence in Āgama and in Śivatattva³. From the ending suffix śiva in these names and the mention of a proficiency in Āgama and in Śivatattva, it appears that Nāgaśiva was a follower of the Śaiva school and at the same time he was a Lākula, or Pāśupata. A sixth dated 1199 A. D. notices a grant of land to Bammadeva, son of Nāgarāsi, the promoter of the system based upon the work. of Lākulin<sup id="fnref1:83"><a href="#fn:83" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">83</a></sup>. The sufflx rāśi is found in a great many names of the devotees of Śiva. Whether it is a characteristic of a specific sect is not clear, but it appears that the bearers of it belong to the Pāśupata, or the Kālāmukha school. In a seventh dated 1213 A. D. a certain religious man is represented as the upholder of the system known by the name of Vāgi-Lākula, i. e. the systemof the learned Lākulin<sup id="fnref1:84"><a href="#fn:84" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">84</a></sup>. In an eighth dated 1285 A. D. the grantor is called a supporter of the new system of Lākulin<sup id="fnref1:85"><a href="#fn:85" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">85</a></sup>.&quot;). This perhaps refers to the later school of Lingāyatas.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>3.Ep. Carn. Vol, V, ArsikereTaluq No. 89. Another holy person of the name of Nāga with the suffix rāśi instead of śiva is mentioned in Inascr. No. 69 Arsikere Taluq (Ep. Carn. Vol. V, p. 137). A grant in therein recorded to Mādhajīya, a disciple of Nāgarāśi, who belonged to the Kālāmukhas and was himself the disciple of Padmaśiva-Paṇḍita. Another Nāgarāśi is mentioned in Inscr. No. 48 (Ibid.). The grantes in this case is Kalyāṇaśakti, disciple of Śivasaktideva, who was himself the disciple of Nāgarāśi,&ldquo;bound to theKālāmukhas&rdquo;. ThisNāgarāśi, or these twoNāgarāśis, appear to me to the different from theNāgarāśi mentioned in the text. And the use of the terminationrāśi in his case, he being aKālāmukha, and of the wordśakti in the case of two of the pupils, strengthens my supposition that these were characteristic of theKālāmukha sect, the former being applicable to thePāśupata also.</p>
<p>Thus it will be seen that Lākula was the general name by which the Śaiva sects were called, and the specific name Kālāmukha is associated with the general name in one case. This general name has for its basis the historical fact, noticed above, that a person of the name of Lākulin or Lakulīsafounded a Śaiva system corresponding to the Pāñcarātra system, which the Vāyuand Liṅga Purāṇas consider to be contemporaneous with it. The other general name Pāśupata arose by dropping the name of the human individual Lākulin and substituting that of the god Pāśupati, whose incarnation he was believed to be, as is done in the texts of the MBh. quoted above. But that the Śaiva system had a human founder is confirmed by the fact that the name of his work, the Pañcādhyāyī, or Pañcārthavidyā, has been handed down, as will be shown immediately below, and probably the work is extant, even if it has not yet been discovered, as Mādhava mentions a gloss on the perpetual commentary (Bhāṣya) on it, which also will be noticed below.The conclusion therefore appears to be that a certain historical person was the founder of the main Śaiva system which was the same as that explained by Mādhava as Nakulīśa-Pāśupata, and that three other systems arose out of it in later times.</p>
<p>The commentators of Śaṁkara state that there were four of these schools bearing the names of Śaiva, Pāśupata, Kārukasiddhāntin and Kāpālika. Vācaspati, however, calls the third. Kāruṇikasiddhāntin. Rāmānuja and Keśava Kāśmīrin mention the same four schools, but call Kāruṇikasiddhāntin by the name of Kālāmukha. The word Kāruka is probably a corruption of Kāuruṣya, the name of the third of the four (according to the Purāṇas) pupils of Lakuliśa, or this last name may be the Sanskritised form of the original Kāruka<sup id="fnref1:86"><a href="#fn:86" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">86</a></sup>. The Śaiva school, however, is called Siddhāntamärga and the Kālāmuklas are called Mahāvratadharas.&quot;). A work of the name of</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>3.These four schools are mentioned in the Vāyavīyasaṁhitā of the Śiva-Purāṇa (II. 24, 177). The Śaiva school, however, is called Siddhāntamärga and the Kālāmukhas are called Mahāvratadharas.</p>
<p>Pañcādhyāyī, dealing with the five topics alluded to above and attributed to Paśupati, is mentioned by Keśava Kāśmīrin and is quoted by Rāmānanda on Kāsīkhaṇḍa¹. This must be the same work as that which is quoted from by Mādhava in the section on Nakulīśa-Pāśupata and attributed by him to Nakulīśa or Lakulīśa.</p>
<p>VII. The Pāśupata System.</p>
<p>§ 92. The five topics mentioned by Śaṁkara and explained by his commentators are these (1) Kārya, or effect, which is Mahat and the rest produced from Pradhāna; (2) Kāraṇa, or the cause. which is Īśvara or Maheśvara and also Pradhāna; (3) Yoga, which is absorption in meditation or the muttering of the syllable Oṁ, contemplation, concentration, eto.;(4) Vidhi, bathing (in ashes) at the three points of time, i. e., the beginning, the middle and the end of the day, and the rest up to Gūdḥacaryā, i. e. incognito movement; (5) Duḥkhānta, which is final deliverance. This is amplified by Mādhavain the section on the Pāśupata sect.</p>
<p>I. Effect (Kārya) is that which is not independent. It is ofthree kinds: (1) cognition (Vidyā), (2) organs (Kalā), and (3) individual soul (Paśu). Of these cognition is the property of the individual and is of two kinds: (1) external, and (2) internal. External cognition is of two kinds: (1) distinct, and (2) indistinct. Distinct external cognition, which is educed by the instruments of knowledge, is called conceptual operation (Citta). For by the conceptual operation every man reduces to definiteness the thing</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.See Aufrecht&rsquo;s Cat. Cat. The Vāyavīya Saṁhita (II, 24, 169) also mentions this work, which it characterises as the highest theosophy (Vidyā) of Śiva and gives Pañcārtha as its name, i, e, Pañcirchavidyt. This Pancarton appears to be alluded to by Mādhava when he refers his reader to the Pāncārthabhāsyādīpikā in bis section on Nakulīśa-Pāśupata. In an Inscription in the temple of Harṣanāth, which exists in the Sīkar principality of the Jaipur state, a person of the name of Viśvarūpa is mentioned as the teacher of the pañcārtha-Lākulāmnāyā, I. e. the sacred book of Lakulin, called Pañcārtha. The Inscriṇtion is dated V, E. 1013= A. D. 957, so that there can be on question that the Pāśupata system was attributed to &rsquo;s buman author named Lakulin, the work composed by him being called Pañcārtha (Ep. Ind. II. p. 123).</p>
<p>The occurrence of the names of the schools and of this book in the Purāṇa shows that its composition was later than the foundation of the school, which, therefore, must be considered as owing nothing to it.</p>
<p>that has been apprehended definitely or indefinitely by the aid of the light in the shape of the external object. The internal cognition is of the nature of virtue or vice, which forms the objective. of the indul and determines for him the body of precepts he has to follow. Organs are dependent on the cognitive individual and are themselves insensate. They are of two kinds: (1) effects, and (2) causes. The effected organs are of ten kinds: the five elements, earth and others, and the five qualities, colour and others. The organs, which are causes, are of thirteen kinds: the five senses, and the five organs of action, and the three internal organs, viz. intelligence, egoism and mind, the functions of which are the determination of the will, the consciousness of the self, and the formation of a plan respectively. The individual (Paśu) is that which has individualism (Paśutva). It is of two kinds: (1) impure, and (2) pure. The impure individual is that which is connected with the body and the organs, while the pure one is unconnected with them. The details should be seen in the Pañcārthabhāsyadīpikāand other works.</p>
<p>II. The cause (Kāraṇa) is that which effects the destruction of the whole creation and its prosperity or promotion. Though it is one, still on account of its various properties and functions it has many forms, such as lord (Pati), naturally powerful (Sādya), eto. To be the lord means to have the unbounded power of knowing and acting. He is, therefore, the eternal ruler. To be a Sādya is to be possessed of supreme sovereignty, which is not incidental, but natural.</p>
<p>III. Yoga is the connecting of the individual soul with god through the conceptual faculty (Citta). It is of two kinds, consisting in (1) action, and (2) cessation from action. The first consists in muttering syllables and formulas, meditation, etc. The second, or cessation from action, consists in mere feeling (Saṁvid).</p>
<p>IV. Vidhi, or process, is an operation which effects or brings about righteousness. It is of two kinds: (1) primary, and (2) secondary. The first, or primary, is conduct (Caryā) which induces righteousness directly. That conduct is of two kinds: (1) vows, and (2) means or doors. The vows consist in besmearing</p>
<p>the body with ashes and lying down in ashes, definite practices (Upahāra), muttering and circumambulation. Thus has Nakulīśa said: &ldquo;One should besprinkle one&rsquo;s body at the three points of the day and lie down in ashes.&rdquo; The definite practices are six. These have been stated by the author of the Sūtras to be laughing, singing, dancing, Huḍukkāra, prostration, and inaudible repetition. With these he says one should worship. Laughing is the making of the sound &lsquo;hā! hā! hā! by the forcible stretch. of the throat and the lips. Singing is the contemplation of the attributes of Maheśvara in accordance with the rules of the science of music. Dancing should be resorted to by contracting and stretching forth hands, feet, etc. and all other principal and subsidiary limbs accompanied by the representation of feeling in accordance with the science of dancing and gesticulation. Huḍukkāra is a holy sound resembling that of an ox made by striking the tongue on the palate. Huḍukis an imitative sound like the sacrificial Vaṣaṭ. When there is a crowd of people, all this should be done so as not to be observed.</p>
<p>The means, or doors, are these: (1) Krāthana, i.e.affecting to be asleep when one is awake; (2) Spandana, which is the moving or the shaking of the limbs as if they were paralysed; (3) Maṇḍana, or the walking as if one&rsquo;s legs and other limbs were disabled;(4) Śṛṅgāraṇa, which is showing oneself to be in love by means of amorous gestures as if on seeing a beautiful young woman; (5) Avitatkaraṇa, which is doing a thing condemned by all as if one were devoid of the sense of discrimination between. what should be done and what should be avoided; (6) Avitadbhāṣaṇa, which is speaking nonsensical and absurd things.</p>
<p>Secondary processes are those which are intended to help the conduct (Caryā), such as besmearing with ashes after worship, and to remove the sense of indecency or impropriety attaching itself to begging and eating the remnant of what others have esten. For this purpose the author of the Sūtras has laid down. that one should besmear his body after the worship and wear the faded flowers and leaves which had been removed from the god. and a Liṅga (the image of the phallus).</p>
<p>V. Duḥkhānta, or final deliverance, is of two kinds: (1) total</p>
<p>destruction of misery, and (2) an elevated condition consisting in the possession of the power of knowing and acting. The power of knowing is of five kinds: (1) Darśana, or seeing all objects which are atomic, concealed or are at a distance, and touching them; (2) Śravaṇa, or the miraculous hearing of all sounds (3) Manana, or the miraculous knowing of all objects of thought; (4) Vijñāna, or the miraculous knowledge of all the sciences with that of the treatises on them and the matter contained in these last; and (5) Sarvajñatva, or the miraculous. knowledge of the principles (of a science), whether mentioned or unmentioned, succinct and detailed, with their divisions and peculiarities. The peculiarities of the present system are such as these: In other systems the destruction of misery is final deliverance; in this system the attainment of the highest powers. is also to be added. With others, that which comes into existence from non-existence is an effect; here the effect is eternal such as Paśu, or the individual soul. In other systems the cause depends for its operation on a subordinate cause; here the great lord acts independently. With others, the fruit of the Yoga, or concentration, is the attainment of an absolute condition; here it is the attainment of the highest powers. With others Vidhi, or process, has for its fruit heaven and other places, from which there is a return to mortal life; in this system the fruit is proximity etc. (to god ), from which there is no return.</p>
<p>The power of acting, though one, is regarded as threefold: (1) Manojavitva, or the power of doing anything instantly: (2) Kāmarūpitva, or the power of assuming variety of shapes. and forms or bodies and senses without an effort; (3) Vikramaṇadharmitva, or the possession of great power, even when the operation of the senses is suspended. Thus then a man acquires these miraculous powers of knowledge and action at the end of a long course of conduct and discipline prescribed by the Pāśupata system.</p>
<p>It will be seen how fantastic and wild the processes prescribed in this system for the attainment of the highest condition are. Rudra-Śiva was the god of the open fields and wild and awful régions away from the habitations of men and worshipped by</p>
<p>aberrant or irregular people. This character did impress itself on the mode of worship for his propitiation, which was developed in later times. The ŚU. endeavoured to humanise Rudra-Śiva; but the wild and outlandish character of the god prevailed. We will now proceed to the consideration of the Śaiva system which seems to have been established in later times. Here also Mādhava will be our main guide, since the many works that he quotes. from are not available.</p>
<p><strong>VIII. The Śaiva System.</strong></p>
<p>§ 93. There are three principles: (1) the lord (Pati), (2) the individual soul (Paśu), and (3) fetters (Pāśa); and the whole system has four Pādas, or parts, which are knowledge (Vidyā), action (Kriyā), meditation ( Yoga), and conduct, or discipline (Caryā). The first part contains an explanation of the nature. of the individual soul (Paśu), fetters (Pāśa), and god (Īśvara), and determines the importance of formulas (Mantra) and the lord presiding over the formulas (Mantreśvara). This leads to initiation (Dikṣā), which is necessary for the acquisition of the highest object of life. The second part contains an explanation of the process of initiation (Dīkṣāvidhi ), which is of many forms and has many parts. The third part explains meditation, or concentration, along with its subsidiary processes.The fourth teaches discipline, or conduct, consisting in doing what is prescribed and avoiding what is proscribed. Without this Yoga is not possible.</p>
<p>I. Now the lord (Pati) is Śiva. Śiva acts, being impelled. thereto by the deeds (Karman) of souls, and produces things to be enjoyed or suffered and their means. The exercise of his He does! creative power thus depends on the Karman of man. everything; therefore, he is omniscient. God has not a body like that of an individual soul which has the fetters of taint and Karman, etc.; but he has a body made up of powers, certain specific five formulas (Mantras<sup id="fnref1:87"><a href="#fn:87" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">87</a></sup> and In the Mahämäräynolya Up. 17. The commentator considers these to refer to the five facos of Śiva, respectively. They are Badyojita, Vāmadeva, Aghora, Tasparuṣa and Īśāna. They are also called forms of ŚivaOne of the Dānas, or charitable gifts, mentioned by Hemādri (DānakhaṇḍaVol. I, pp. 789-798 Bibl. Ind.) consists of üve images made of gold or other motal fashioned in a particular manner of these five forms of Śiva. In giving each a certain verse bas to be repeated. These five forms are Ident fed in a Śaiva treatise with the earth, water, fire, wind an d ather, respectively, and they are considered as the creators of these elements la another, viz., Virn-Śaiva-Cintamani, Sholapur 1908 A. D.&quot;)) being imagined to be thedifferent parts of his body. These five are his powers and are also considered his different forms, and by these he does the five actions. which are creation, existence or protection, destruction, concealment, and benefaction. The following four partake of the nature. of Śiva: (1) formulas (Mantras), (2) the deity presiding over the formulas (Mantreśvara), (3) the great god (Maheśvara), and (4) delivered souls (Mukta).</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.These five formulas, or Mantras, are contained in the TA. (X. 43-47) and In the Mahānārāyaṇīya Up. 17. The commentator considers these to refer to the five faces of Śiva, respectively. They are Sadyojāta, Vāmadeva, Aghora, Tasparuṣa and Īśāna. They are also called forms of Śiva One of the Dānas, or charitable gifts, mentioned by Hemādri (Dānakhaṇḍa Vol. I, pp. 789-798 Bibl. Ind.) consists of five images made of gold or other motal fashioned in a particular manner of these five forms of Śiva. In giving each a certain verse bas to be repeated. These five forms are Ident fed in a Śaiva treatise with the earth, water, fire, wind an d ather, respectively, and they are considered as the creators of these elements la another, viz., Vīra-Śaiva-Cintāmani, Sholapur 1908 A. D.</p>
<p>II. The Paśu is the individual soul, who is atomic and known.by the name of Kṣetrajña (self-conscious) and others. It is eternal and all-pervading. It is not incapable of action nor is it one only, as is maintained by other schools of philosophy. When the fetters are removed, he becomes Śiva, possessing eternal and -boundless knowledge and power of action. The Muktas, or delivered ones, are Śivas, who have so become by the favour of him who is eternally Mukta, and is a person with five formulas. (Mantras ) for his body, i. e. he is identified with the god Śiva himself. Though they become Śivas, they are not independent. but depend upon the eternal god, Śiva. Paśu is of three kinds: (1) Vijñānākala, who has shaken off his connection with all the organs (Kalāḥ<sup id="fnref1:88"><a href="#fn:88" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">88</a></sup>) in consequence of the destruction of the impression of deeds done, by means of knowledge, meditation, asceticism, or by the enjoyment or suffering of the fruit (Bhoga), and has simple taint (Mala). The second is Pralayākala, whose organs are destroyed by the dissolution of the world. He has both impression of deeds (Karman) and taints (Mala). The third is Śakala, who has all the three fetters, taint (Mala), impression of deeds. (Karman), and material cause (Māyā). Vijñanākala is of two kinds (1) one whose taint (Kaluṣa) has ended, and (2) another whoso taint (Kaluṣa) has not ended. The first are those, who, their taint (Kaluṣa) having ended, are elevated to the position of Vidyeśvaras. The Vidyeśvaras are eight and are as follows: (1) Ananta, or endless, (2) atomic, (3) the most excellent Śiva, (4)</p>
<p>the one-eyed. (5) the one Rudra, (6) he with the three forms, (7) Śrīkaṇṭha, and (6) Śikhaṇḍin. Another author says that Śiva invests the Samāptakaluṣa (one whose taint has ended) with Vidyeśatva, which is of eight kinds, and the Asamāptakaluṣa (one whose taint has not onded) he raises to the dignity of fomulas. (Mantras) which are seven crores. Pralayākala is also of two kinds. The first is one whose two fetters have matured (and about to be shaken off), and the second is different from him. The first attains Mokṣa, and the second, entangled with Puryaṣṭaka, undergoes many births in accordance with his impressisn of deeds. (Karman). The Puryaṣṭaka is a subtle body, wich is composed of elements which are variously enumerated. Of those who have the Puryaṣṭaka, some, who are virtuous, are raised to Bhuvanapatitva by Maheśvara Ananta. Sakala is also of two kinds: (1) one whose taint (kaluṣa) is matured, and (2) one whose taint (kaluṣa) is not matured. The first is raised to the dignity of Mantreśvara of 118 Mantras, i. e of so many kinds. Parameśvara, assuming the form of his preceptor by the process of initiation. and the use of power calculated to counteract the matured taint, confers Mokṣa. Those Aṇus or atomio souls, whose taint has not ripened (i. e. is not in a condition to be wiped away), are made to suffer or enjoy in accordance with their Karman.</p>
<p>III. Pāśa (fetter) is of four kinds: (1) Mala, or taint (2) Karman, or the impression of deeds, (3) Māyā, or material cause, and (4) Rodhaśakti, or obstructive power. Mala, or tsint, is that which conceals the knowing and acting power of the soul and is like the husk enveloping a grain of rice. Karman is the impression of deeds done for the attainment of fruit. It is righteous or un- righteous. It is unbeginning, ever continuing in succesion in the manner of seed and its sprout. Māyāis that into which the whole creation resolves itself at the time of dissolution and from which it springs out at the time of recreation. The obstructive power is the power of Siva which, because it regulates the three other fetters and conceals the true nature of the soul, is itself called a fetter. It performs its function, because it is the principle. of speech by means of which names are given to things and thus. their nature is determined<sup id="fnref1:89"><a href="#fn:89" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">89</a></sup>.</p>
<p>§ 94. This constitutes the first part of the system (Vidyāpāda), the nature of the other three parts has been succinetly given above. A few details are these<sup id="fnref1:90"><a href="#fn:90" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">90</a></sup>: The second part (Kriyapāda) treats of the accomplishment of Mantra, the twilight adorations, worship, muttering of formulas (Japa), throwing oblations into the fire, acossional ceremonies for the attainment of eternal bliss, anointing of the preceptor and of the person ontering on a course of action for final emancipation (Sādhaka), and one&rsquo;s own initiatory ceremonies necessary to fit one for a wordly and for an eternal life. In the third, or the Yoga part are mentioned the thirty-six principles; the deities presiding over them; the lords of the different worlds; the individual soul; the all-ruling soul, the power (Śakti); the direct perception of Māyāand Mahāmāyā, which are the causes of the world; the attainment of the miraculous powers, minuteness, lightness, eto. for those who concern themselves with the worldly element; the methods of the restraint. of the breath, abstraction, meditation, concentration, and absorption in thought (Samādhi); and the positions of the circles in the body beginning with the root-circle (Mūlādhara, or navel). The fourth part treats of penances, a purificatory ceremony (Pavitrāropaṇa), the foundation, and the natures of Śivaliṅga, of the visible Liṅga of Umā and Maheśvara, and of the lord of Gaṇas, or groups, such as Skanda and Nandin, of the rosary used for the muttering of formulas, and the funeral Śrāddhas. This last part appears to contain matters subsidiary to, and explanatory of, the actions enjoined in the second part. The proscribed actions mentioned above are: (1) the eating of the residue of what is offered to another deity; (2) the vilification of (a) Śiva, (b) of the devotees of Śiva, (c) of the system of Śiva and (d) of the practices enjoined. in the Śaiva system; (3) the enjoyment of things belonging to God; (4) the killing of animals.</p>
<p>§ 95.The doctrines of the Śaiva school are more moderate and rational than those of the Pāśupāta school. This last, as well as the two extreme schools to be mentioned next, are called Atimārgika, or schools that are away from the path or go astray, and are spoken of by Śaṁbhudeva, quoted in the above paragraph, as revealed by Rudra. The Śaiva schools he calls the Siddhāntaśāstra, or the true</p>
<p>Śāstra based upon the Mantras, and says that it was revealed byŚiva. The Vāyavīyasaṁhitāalso calls it the Siddhānta school.</p>
<p>It will have been seen that both this and the Pāśupata schoolare dualistic or pluralistic and maintain that the supreme andindividual souls are distinct entities and the Pradhāna the constituent cause of the material world. In the delivered conditionthe individual soul shakes off its ignorance and weakness andattains boundless knowledge and power of action according tothe Pāśupata doctrine, while the Śaivas hold that he becomesŚiva himself, i. e. attains perfect resemblance with the God Śivawithout, however, the power of creation.</p>
<p>The Śaiva school, that developed itself in later times, and isrepresented by Śaṁbhudeva and Śrīkaṇṭheśivācārya, to benoticed hereafter, and supported also by texts in the Vāyavīyasaṁhitā, holds that Śiva possesses or develops in himself a Śakti,or power, consisting of the rudiments of the individual soul andthe material world, and from this power the whole world isdeveloped. This doctrine may, therefore, be called qualifiedspiritual monism like that of Rāmānuja, in-as-much as Śivacharacterised by the Śakti creates. This last is a tenet of theLiṅgāyat school also.</p>
<p><strong>IX. Kāpāla and Kālāmukha Sects.</strong></p>
<p>§ 96. Rāmānuja tells us under II. 2. 35 or 36 that the Kāpālikas maintain that a man who knows the essence of the sixmarks (Mudrikā) and who is skilful in their use, attains thehighest bliss by concentrating his mind on the soul seated on thefemale organ. The six marks are (1) a necklace, (2) an ornament,(3) an ear-ornament, (4) a crest jewel, (5) ashes, and (6) the sacredthread (Yajñopavīta). He whose body bears these marks is free.from transmigration. The Kālāmukhas hold that the followingare the means for the attainment of desires concerning thisworld and the next:—(1) eating food in a skull; (2) besmearingthe body with the ashes of a dead body; (3) eating the ashes; (4)holding a club; (5) keeping a pot of wine; and (6) worshippingthe god as seated therein. A bracelet of Rudrākṣa, one string ofmatted hair on the head, s skull, besmearing the body with ashes, and such other things are mentioned in the Śaiva</p>
<p>sacred books. They also maintain that people of other castes.become Brāhmaṇas and attain to the highest order by the performance of certain rites. For it is said &ldquo;One becomes aBrāhmaṇa immediately after the process of simple initiation, and a man becomes a holy saint by undertaking the vow of a Kāpāla&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In the Śaṁkaradigvijaya (chap. XV, vv. 1-28) Mādhavabrings Śaṁkara into contact with the Kāpālikas at a place which,according to the commentator, was Ujjayinī. The preceptor ofthe sect came forward to meet Śaṁkara. His body was besmearedwith the ashes taken from a burning-ground. He had a skull inhis hand and also an iron lance. He said to Śaṁkara: &ldquo;Theashes on your body are all right¹. But why dost thou carry anunholy potsherd instead of the holy skull? Why dost thou notworship Kapālin who is Bhairava? How will Bhairava become.pleased unless he is worshipped by the skulls red with the blood.of men and with wine?&rdquo; Then ensues a fight between Sudhanvan,.the king, who accompanied Śaṁkara in his wanderings and theKāpālikas. Śaṁkara also pronounced a curse on them, and theywere all killed. Then Krakaca, the leader of the Kāpālikas,coming up to Śaṁkara, filled the skull in his band with wine,drank half of it and left the other half and invoked Bhairava.Bhairava came up and Krakaca prayed to him to destroy hisenemy; but as Śaṁkara was his own incarnation, he destroyed.Krakaca himself and not Śaṁkara. In Ānandagiri&rsquo;s book theKāpālikas, whom Śaṁkara meets at Ujjayinī, speak of Bhairavabeing the great god, who creates, destroys, etc. They profess tohave their knowing power sharpened by drinking wine andeating a certain kind of food (probably a disgusting substance)and always being embraced by the power (Śakti) of Kapälin, i. e.Bhairava. Bhavabhūti in his Malatimadhava gives Śrisails asthe principal seat of the Kāpālikas. Miraculous powers of speedymovement attained by the practice of Yoga are attributed tothem. The woman Kapālakuṇḍalāwears a garland of humanskulls. She carries away Mālatī, the heroine of the play, fromthe place where she was sleeping in her father&rsquo;s palace in thedead of night and places her before the image of Karāla-Cāmuṇḍānear the cemetery to be killed and sacrificed to the goddess byher preceptor Aghoraghaṇṭa.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Lines of ashes are borne on the body by ordinary Śaiva&rsquo;s also, andŚaṁkara&rsquo;s body was marked with them.</p>
<p>It will be seen how horrible and demoniacal this sect was.The fear which some of the phenomena of external nature inspirein the mind of man led to the Vedicconception of Rudra, andthis has now culminated into the ideal image of the horrid godBhairava with his wife Caṇḍikāwearing a garland of humanskulls and requiring human sacrifices and offerings of wine forhis propitiation. In the account just given there appears to be aconfusion between the sects of Kāpālikas and Kālāmukhas. From.Rāmānuja&rsquo;s account the Kālāmukhas appear to be the mostextreme sect; and they are called Mahavratadharas in the ŚivaPurāṇa as noticed above. Mahävrata means the great vow, andthe greatness of the vow consists in its extraordinary nature,such as eating food placed in a human skull, besmearing the bodywith the ashes of human carcasses and others which are attributedto the Kālāmukhas by Rämänuja. Jagaddhara, the commentatoron the Mālatīmādhava, however, explains Kāpālikavrata byMahāvrata¹, and this explanation appears to be correct, since theascetics dwelling in the temple of Kāpāleśvara in the Nāsikdistrict are, as we have seen, called in the grant Mahāvratins,or the observers of the great vow. The account of Kāpālikasgiven above from other authorities looks like those of the mostextreme sect. Ordinarily, therefore, people do not seem to havemade a sharp distinction between the Kāpālikas and theKālāmukhas.</p>
<p><strong>X. Kashmir Śaivism.</strong></p>
<p>$ 97. It is a relief now to turn away from this ghastly pictureof the wild aberrations of the human intellect and spirit to asystem of Śaivism more humane and rational. The KashmirŚaivism has two branches, the Spandaśātra and the Pratyabhijñāśastra. The authorship of the first is attributed to Vasuguptaand his pupil Kallaṭa. The two principal works of the system.are the Śivasūtram or Śivasūtraṇi and the Spandakārikās whichare fifty-one verses only. The first are said to have been revealed</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.Act I, p. 33, on 1. 127 of my second edition of the play.</p>
<p>to Vasugupta by Śiva himself or by a Siddha, or perfected humanbeing. They were inscribed on a rock on the Mahādeva hill, andVasugupta was directed to the rock by Śiva. Another account isthat they were revealed by the god in a dream, and another accountstill further confers the credit of the revelation on the prefectedhuman being. These two last occurrences are said to have taken.place on the Mahādeva hill. As to the second work, there arealso varying traditions, one ascribing the authorship of the versesto Vasugupta and another to Kallaṭa. A third tradition, however,that Kallaṭa obtained the knowledge of the system from Vasugupta and composed the Spandakārikās for the instruction of hispupils seems to contain the truth¹. What the meaning of theroundabout tradition about the Śivasūtras which do not ascribetheir authorship to Vasugupta directly is, it is difficult to say;perhaps the original work was the Spandakārikās and the proseŚivasūtras were composed in later times in the older or moreorthodox form, and as Vasugupta was probably too near the time.when they were composed and as what he did was known to all,&amp; miraculous origin was given to the new Sūtras and Vasuguptawas represented to have received them from others and not composed them himself.</p>
<p>$ 98. Kallaṭa lived in the reign of Avantivarman<sup id="fnref1:91"><a href="#fn:91" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">91</a></sup>, 854 A. D.,wherefore his Guru&rsquo;s literary activity must be referred to the beginning of the ninth century. The followers of this school boldlydeny the necessity of God&rsquo;s having a prompting cause, such asKarman, or a material cause, like the Pradhāns, for the creation ofthe world. Neitherdo they admit that he is himself the materialcause, as the Vedāntasūtras maintain, nor do they think thatsome principle of illusion, such as Māyā, generates appearanceswhich are false. God is sccording to them independent andcreates merely by the force of his will all that comes into existence. He makes the world appear in himself, as if it were distinct from himself, though not so really, as houses or even townsappear in a mirror, and is as unaffected by it as the mirror is by</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1. For these various traditions see my Report on the Search for SanskritManuscripts during 1883-84, p. 77f. [=Volume II of this Edition p 199f.N. B.U.]</p>
<p>the images reflected in it. Neither does he exist only as realisedin the world, which is the conclusion that follows from thedoctrine that he is the material cause.In a verse attributed toVasugupta an obeisance is made to Sūlin, or Śiva, who is represented as portraying a picture of the world without a canvassand a collection of materials¹.</p>
<p>Another illustration that they give of creation without anymaterial or prompting cause is that of a Yogin who createsobjects by his mere will without any materials. God himself byhis own wonder-working power appears in the form of the manyindividual souls, and by means of another power, brings into existence the state of things which goes to form what we call thewakeful and dreamy condition of our life². Thus according tothis system the individual soul is identical with the supremesoul. But the former does not perceive this identity on accountof his impurity.</p>
<p>This impurity, or Mala, is of three kinds. When a soul forgets.his own free and universal nature through ignorance, and believeshimself to be imperfect, and regards things, such as the body,which are not himself, to be himself, and thus reduces himself tofiniteness or subjects himself to limitations, the impurity is called Āṇava (littleness). Then his remaining in the body, which isprepared by the originator of things, called Māyā, is anotherspecies of impurity known as Māyīya, or effected by Māyā. Andwhen under the influence of the internal organ, cr the heart, theorgans of action are set in motion, the impurity arising from itis called Kārma, or resulting from action, such as that consistingin a man&rsquo;s consciousness of having done a good or evil deed.which is to lead to happiness or misery in the end³. These severalkinds of impurity are brought into action by Nāda, which is thefemale element constituting a primeval power (Śakti) of Śivaand from which rises speech.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>Without speech the ideas which render a worldly life possiblecannot stand, or assume a shape or form, and therefore theprinciple of speech is believed to be the origin of the Mala, or impurity, which leads to a worldly life. This power is associatedwith others which are personalised as Ambā, Jyeṣṭha, Raudrī,Vāmā¹.</p>
<p>The impurity vanishes when by means of intense contemplation the vision of the highest being breaks in upon the mind ofthe devotee and absorbs all finite thought. When this conditionbecomes stable, the individual soul is free and becomes thesupreme soul. The breaking in of the vision is called Bhairava,because it is his and is caused by him<sup id="fnref1:92"><a href="#fn:92" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">92</a></sup>.</p>
<p>§99. The founder of the Pratyabhijñāschool of KāśmīraŚaivism was Somānanda, the work written by whom is calledŚivadṛṣṭi. But the principal treatise of the school was composedby his pupil Udayākara, and contains verses which are calledSūtras.

<p>The doctrines of the creation of the world and of the relationsbetween the individual and supreme souls set forth by thisschool are the same as those maintained by the preceding one.But the way of the perception of the identity is recognition.according to this system.

<p>that everything becomes perceptible by His light, and thus ourknowing power is the same as God&rsquo;s and everything outside of usbecomes an object of knowledge by his illumining power.Capable of knowledge and action as we are, we partake of thenature of God; but there is no reason to place a limit to thisparticipation, and it must be understood that we are God himself. But the joy and elevation, characteristic of God, we areunconscious of in our present condition, and that is due to thefact that we do not recognise that we are God, though we arereally so. Just as a maiden, stricken with love for a youthwhose excellences have been described to her, is not filled withraptures when she is carried to him and looks upon him as anordinary individual, but is overjoyed and devotes her whole.soul to him when she is told that he is the man whose excellenceshad so fascinated her, so is it with the individual soul. Theserene bliss of godly nature he does not feel, though he is himself God, because he is not aware that those high attributes.But when he iswhich belong to the divine nature exist in himled to believe by his preceptor that he possesses them, i. e when.by his instructions he is enabled to recognise God in himself,then it is that the serene bliss dawns upon him. The Spandaschool mentions the dawning of the form or vision of Bhairava,or God, on the mind in the course of meditation and thereby theclearing away of the impurities as the way to the realisation ofthe identity with God, while this maintains that recognition ofoneself as God is the way.</p>
<p>According to Mādhava, these two systems do not enjoin restraint of the breath, concentration, and all that course of fantasticexternal and internal conduct or discipline which the other.These two schools apparentlyschools prescribe as essentialout themselves off from the old traditional Śaivism, whichgradually developed itself into the ghastly Kāpālism or Kālāmukhism, and hence the epithet Pāśupata or Lākula cannot beapplied to them in any sense. A fresh revelation, therefore, wastclaimed for Vasugupta, though some of the doctrines of the more.sober Śaiva school were preserved in the Spanda system.</p>
<p><strong>XI. The Vīrśaiva or Liṅgāyat Sect.</strong></p>
<p>§ 100. The foundation of this sect is generally attributed to</p>
<p>Basava, who was the son of Mādirāja, a Brāhmaṇa supposed to be of the Ārādhya sect. His story is given in the Basavapurāṇa</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>published in 1905, at Poona. From this story it by no means follows that he founded the sect by settling its doctrines and founding what may be called a church. He, however, appears to be a strenuous supporter of the sect. In the beginning of the Basavapurāṇa, Nārada is represented to have gone to Śiva and told him that on earth there were devotees of Viṣṇu, followers of the sacrificial religion, Jainas and Buddhists, but that there were no devotees of his. He mentions Visveśvarārādhya, Paṇḍitārādhya, Ekorāma, the great Yogin, and others as having flourished from time to time and established Śivabhakti, but there is none now. Śiva thereupon told his Nandin to become incarnate on earth for the promotion of his religion and the furtherance of the cause of Vīraśaivas.</p>
<p>From all this it does not appear that Basava was the originator of the sect. He had predecessors, three of whom have just been named. His was a life of political turmoil. From his native. place Bāgevāḍi he went to Kalyāṇa, when Vijjala or Vijjaṇa, was reigning (1157-1167 A. D.). His maternal uncle Baladeva was the minister of the king, and he himself was raised to the position after his death. Basava&rsquo;s sister, a beautiful woman, was married. by the king. He was in charge of the king&rsquo;s treasury and spent large amounts in supporting and entertaining members of Liṅgāyat mendicants, called Jaṅgamas. The matter came to the notice of the king Vijaṇa, who gradually became completely alienated from him, and endeavoured to apprehend him. Basava fled away, and the king sent a few men in persuit. These were easily defeated by Basava, whereupon the king himself advanced with troops to punish him; but Basava had collected a large number of followers and succeeded in defeating him. The king was reconciled to Basava and brought him back to Kalyāṇa, but there could be no true reconcilement, and after a time Basava caused the king to be assassinated.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1. This book and a good many others appertaining to the Liṅgāyat sect have been published under the patronage of an influential and enlightenedmember of the sect, the late Mr. MallāppāVārada of Sholapur.</p>
<p>§ 101. There is a work entitled Vijjalarāyacarita by a Jaina,which also gives an account of Basava and his relations withVijjaṇa. It is written from the point of view of an enemyof Basava, and mentions Basava&rsquo;s sister as having been given tothe king as a mistress, which was perhaps true. But since theLiṅgāyat account and the Jaina account agree in the main.particulars, they may be accepted as historical¹. Basava thuswas a scheming politician and could hardly have been the propounder of a new system of doctrines or the organiser of asect. Besides, in the many Liṅgāyat works now available, hisname is not mentioned as the name of a teacher of any articles offaith. What he did, therefore, appears to have been that be used hispolitical influence to raise the fortunes of the Vīraśaiva sect, to bringit into prominence, and to disseminate the creed. There is anotherman who has been brought forward by Dr. Fleet, on the strengthof certain Inscriptions, as the founder of the Liṅgāyat sect andthat is Ekānta, or Ekāntada, Rāmayya. An account of this person is also given in the second part of the Basavapurāṇa, andthis and that in the Inscriptions come to this that he was anenemy of the Jainas and wished to destroy their gods and shrines.He laid a wager with them that he would cut off his head and layit at the feet of Śiva, and if it should be restored to him and replaced on his shoulders as it was before, the Jainas should consent to throw down their idols and profess a belief in Śaivism.According to the Inscription, this was first done at Ablūr at theplace where it exists, and when Rāmayya compelled the Jainasto destroy their idols, they went to Kalyāṇa and complained toKing Vijjaṇa, who thereupon summoned Rāmayya into his presence and required him to explain why he did so. He offered torepeat the feat of cutting off his head and getting it back again inthe presence of the king. The Basavapurāṇa represents Basavahimself to have been present when Rāmayya laid this wager. Sothat beyond undermining the Jaina seot there is no evidence of Rāmavya&rsquo;s having built up the Vīraśaiva creed.</p>

This last belongs to the person to be consecrated as Guruor preceptor, who is supposed to represent an old Ācārya, orteacher, of the name of Viśvarādhya, and the other four to fourother priests chosen as having been brought up in the schools ofRevaṇasiddha, Marulasiddha, Ekorāma and Paṇḍitārādhya andconnected with certain Maṭhas, or establishments<sup id="fnref1:95"><a href="#fn:95" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">95</a></sup>. The same.list is given in another treatise<sup id="fnref1:96"><a href="#fn:96" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">96</a></sup>. These five vessels. are consocrated to the five faces or forms of Śiva, Sadyojāta, otc, mentioned in a former section<sup id="fnref1:97"><a href="#fn:97" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">97</a></sup>. The Ācāryas, or teachers, named aboveare believed to have sprung from the five forms of Śiva in thisKali age<sup id="fnref1:98"><a href="#fn:98" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">98</a></sup>. Others bearing other names, born in other ages of theworld, are also mentioned, but with these we have nothing to doOf these five teachers three at least are mentioned as having preceded Basavs in the passage quoted at the beginning of thissection.</p>
<p>It will thus appear that the Vīraśaiva, or Liṅgāyat, systemcame into existence before Basava. It is affiliated to the moderateor sober school of Śaivas known by the name of Śaivadarśana, orSiddhāntadarśana as it is called by its followers; and especiallyto the later form of it alluded to before<sup id="fnref1:99"><a href="#fn:99" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">99</a></sup>. But its technical terms,Sthala, Aṅga, Liṅga, etc. and its ideas are entirely different fromthose of that school as explained by Mādhava and others. Andthese terms we do not meet with elsewhere, so that thismodern school. When it originated, it is difficult to say. But it was clearly in a militant condition in the time of Basava. Itmust, therefore, have originated about a hundred years before.The names of two at least of the five teachers as given above endin the word arä</p>
<p>dhya, while in other books all the five have thatepithet attached to their names<sup id="fnref1:100"><a href="#fn:100" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">100</a></sup>. This was the name of a sectallied to the Liṅgāyats.</p>
<p>Of the five Ācāryas represented by the five metallic vessels,Mr. Brown¹ does not mention the middle one and calls all the otherfour Ārādhyas, so that all the five preceptors honoured at the timeof initiation and other ceremonies belong to the Ārādhya sect,which, according to Mr. Brown, was a sect of the Vīraśaiva creed.There has been a good deal of ill-feeling between the Ārādhyasand the ordinary Liṅgāyats, and that appears to be due to theretention by the former of some Brāhmaṇic rites, such as repeating the holy Gāyatrīmantra and wearing the sacred thread. Butthe very name Ārādhya, which means one to be adored or worshipped, shows that, before the contention between the two sects.arose the Ārādhyas enjoyed very great respect.</p>
<p>Taking all these circumstances into consideration, what appearsto be the truth is that the Vīraśaiva creed was reduced to a shapeby the Ārādhyas, who must have been men of learning and helyliving, and the subsequent reformers, such as Basava, gave it adecidedly uncompromising and anti-Brāhmaṇical character. And thus these two sects of the Vīraśaiva faith came into existence.We will now give a short account of the doctrines of this school.</p>
<p>§ 103. The One, Highest, Brahman, characterised by existence(Sat), intelligence (Cit), and joy (Ānanda), is the essence of Śiva(Śivatattva) and is called Sthals. Then are given explanations asto why it is called Sthala, two of them based upon an artificialetymology. In the supreme Brahman, or the essence of Śiva,Mahat and other principles exist and are eventually resolved intoit. In the first existence the universe, arising from Prakṛti andPuruṣa, and to it it returns at the end; therefore it is called Sthala.(The first part stha signifies sthāna, or standing, and the secondpart la signifies laya, or resolution.) That name is given to italso because it is the support of the whole moveable and immoveable world and holds all powers, all luminaries, and all souls.It is the resting place of all beings, of all worlds, and of all possessions. It is the highest place to be attained by those who seekthe highest happiness, and therefore it is called the One only andnon-dualistic Sthala (position).</p>
<p>By the agitation of its innate power (Śakti), that Sthala becomes divided into two: (1) Liṅgasthala, (2) Aṅgasthala. Liṅgasthala is Śiva or Rudra and is to be worshipped or adored, whilethe Aṅgasthala is the individual soul, the worshipper or adorer.In the same manner, the Śakti, or power, divides herself into twoby her own will, one of the parts resorting to Śiva and beingcalled Kalā, and the other resorting to the individual soul andbeing called Bhakti, or devotion. Śakti, or power, has got a certainsusceptibility, which leads it to action and entanglement with theworld, while Bhakti is free from that susceptibility and turnsaway from action and from the world and leads to final deliverance. The Śakti, or power makes one an object of worship,while Bhakti makes one a worshipper; therefore, the formerexists in the Liṅga or Śiva, and the latter in the Anga or individual soul. Eventually, by this Bhakti, there is a union betweenthe soul and Śiva.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.Madras journal of Literature and Science, Vol. XI.</p>
<p>The Liṅga is Śiva himself, and not a mere external emblem ofhim. The Liṅgasthala is divided into three: (1) Bhāvaliṅga, (2)Prāṇaliṅga, and (3) Iṣṭaliṅga. The first is without any parts(Kalā) and is to be perceived by faith. It is simple Sat (existence), not conditioned by space or time, and is higher thanthe highest. The second is to be apprehended by the mind andhas parts and is without parts. The third has parts and isapprehensible by the eye. This confers all desired (iṣṭa) objectsand removes afflictions; or it receives its name because it isworshipped (iṣṭa) with care. The Pranaliṅga is the intelligence(Cit) of the Supreme Soul, and Iṣṭaliṅga, the joy. The first isthe highest principle, the second is the subtle form, and the third,the gross form.</p>
<p>These three Liṅgas, corresponding to the soul, the life and thegross form, and being characterised by use (Prayoga), formulas.(Mantra) and action (Kriyā), form what are called Kalā, Nādaand Bindu. Each of these three is divided into two; the firstInto Mahāliṅga and Prasādaliṅga, the second into Caraliṅga andŚivaliṅga, and the third into Guruliṅga and Ācāraliṅga.These six operated on by six kinds of Śakti, or power, give riseto the following six forms. (1) When the Śiva essenceoperated on by the power of intelligence (Cit), it forms theMahāliṅga, the attributes of which are the absence of birth and</p>
<p>death, freedom from taint, perfection, unity, subtleness, beinghigher than the highest, incurruptibility, unfathomableness,capability of being apprehended by faith and love, and idealistic(Caitanyarūpa (2) When the Śiva essence gets permeatedwith its highest power (Parāśakti), then is produced a principlecalled Sādākhya¹ which is light, eternal, indivisible, imperceptible to the senses, apprehensible by reason, indestructible, and therudiment that develops; and that principle is called Prasādaliṅga.(3) When the Śiva essence is operated on by its primeval power(Ādiśakti), Caraliṅga is produced, which is infinite and pervadesthe internal and external world, which is full of light, is aPuruṣa (a person), and is higher than the Pradhāna or Prakṛti,and capable of being contemplated by the mind alone. (4) Whenpermeated by the will power (Icchāśakti) it forms Śivaliṅga,which is a finite principle with a sense of egoism, possessed ofknowledge and power (Kalā), having a celestial refulgence, withone face, and serene. (5) When perineated with the power ofknowledge (Jñānaśakti) it forms a Guruliṅga, which possessesagency, presides over every system or science that instructs, isfull of light, a boundless ocean of joy, and dwells in human intelligence. (6) When influenced by the power of action.(Kriyāśakti), it is called Ācāraliṅga, which in the shape ofaction serves as the support for the existence of all things, whichis conceivable by the mind, and leads to a life of renunciation.</p>
<p>It will be seen that the original entity becomes divided intoGod and individual soul by its innate power, and the six formsof the first, that are mentioned, are the various ways of lookingat God. The first form is the infinite Being considered independently. The second is the form in which we conceive ofhim as developing or creating by its highest power. The thirdis the form in which he is conceived as distinct from thematerial world. The fourth is a bodily form, the body, however, not being made up of ordinary matter, but celestial like thebody attributed to Nārāyaṇa, or Kṛṣṇa, by the Vaiṣṇavas. Thefifth is the form in which he instructs mankind. And the sixthinvolves the idea of his guiding the individual soul in hisactions until he is delivered. In this form Śiva is the Redeemer.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1. The Sādākhya is the product of the combination of the principle, theŚivaessence, with the two of the five powers, Parāand Ādi. The Sādākhyasarefive (1) Śivasādākhya, which develops into Sadāśiva;(2) Amūrta, or notfinite, which becomes Īśa; (3) Samūrta, or finite, which results in Brahmeśa;(4) Kartṛ, or agent, which becomes Īśvara; (b) Karman, or action, whichdevelops into Īśāna. The Sādākhya alluded to in the test must be Sadāśiva.</p>
<p>Bhakti is the characteristic of the individual souls. It consists in a tendency towards God, and there are three stages inthe progress of this tendency and, corresponding to these, thereare three divisions of the Aṅgasthala, or the subject of the individual soul. The first or highest division is called Yogāṅga, thesecond Bhogāṅga, and the third Tyāgāṅga. By the first, a manobtains happiness by his union with Śiva; by the second, heenjoys along with Śiva; and the last involves the abandonmentof the world as transient or illusory. The first corresponds to theresolution into the cause and to the condition of sound sleep, thesecond to the subtle body and to dreamy sleep, and the third tothe gross body and to the wakeful condition. Two varieties ofeach of these are distinguished. Of the first, or Yogāṅga, wehave the two, Aikya and Śaraṇa. The first consists in sharingthe joys of Śiva after one is convinced of the unreality of thewhole world. This is called SamarasāBhakti, in which Godand the soul are united in blissful experience. The second iscalled Śaraṇabhakti, in which one sees Liṅga, or God, in himselfand everything else. It is a condition of joy for oneself. Thesecond is also of two kinds: (1) Prāṇsliṇgin and (2) Prasādin. Thefirst consists in abandoning all regard for life, renunciation ofegoism, and concentration of the whole mind upon the Liṅga, orGod. The second is realised, when one resigns all the objects ofone&rsquo;s enjoyment to the Liṅga, or God, and serenity (Prasāda) isacquired. The divisions of the last are Mäheśvers and Bhakta.The first is one who has a firm belief in the existence of God, whogoes through the whole discipline consisting in the observance ofvows and restraints, which have Śiva for their object, and truth,morality, cleanliness, etc. and a heroically rigid vow based upona firm belief in the unity of the Liṅga, or God. A Bhakta is one.who, turning his mind away from all objects by which it is attracted and practising devotion and rites, lives a life of indifference to the world¹.</p>
<p>This represents the progress of the soul from indifference tothe world, which is the first step, through the intermediate stages,in a reverse order, to Sāmarasya, or union in blissful experience.with Śiva, which is the highest condition. The goal thus pointedout does not involve a perfect identity between the supreme andindividual souls, or the shaking off of individuality and becoming a simple soul unconscious of itself, which is the doctrine ofthe great non-dualistic school of Śaṁkars.</p>
<p>The belief of the Vīraśaiva school that the original essence ofŚivadivided itself by its own innate power into Liṅga or God,and Aṅga, or the individual soul, and under the influence of otherpowers the essence became the creator of the world, shows that thedoctrine of that school is that the rudiment of the creation existsin God himself in the shape of his power, but this power is notunreal. This doctrine, therefore, resembles that of Rāmānuja, butwith the latter there is a real rudiment of the soul and of the external world characterising God which afterwards develops, butwith the Vīraśaivas there exists a power only in God which leads tocreation; so that it is the power that characterises God accordingto the latter, while the rudiment is his characteristic according tothe former. The Liṅgä</p>
<p>yat school, therefore, is a school of qualified spiritual monism (Viśiṣṭādavaita). It will also have beenseen that the method of redemption taught by this school isthat of Bhakti or love of God, and a course of moral and spiritualdiscipline up to the attainment of Sāmarasya withŚ</p>
<p>iva. In thisrespect also it resembles Rāmānuja&rsquo;s system.</p>
<p>Śrīkaṇthaśivācārya, whose Bhāṣya on the Veāantasūtras haslong been before the public, holds the same view. Under I. 4. 22,he states that the word Ātman in the sense of the individual soulis used to express the supreme soul in BU. (IV. 5. 6), because thelatter is the internal controller of the former and is spoken of asidentical with everything in this sense. Under II. 2. 38, he statesthat Śiva as possessed of powers is the material cause of the world;and in his comment on IV. 4. 3-4, he represents the deliveredsoul as similar to the Supreme Soul, that is, as having the attributes of the latter. And under IV. 4, 2, he speaks of the delivered.soul as Samarasa, or united in blissful experience with the Supreme Soul. Thus Srīkaṇṭha&rsquo;s view appears to be identicalwith that of the Vīraśaivas. Therefore unlike the four older.schools (Pāśupata and others), which are dualistic, these threeŚaiva schools hold a doctrine of qualified spiritual monism.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.The above is an abstract of the matter contained in the Anubhavasūtra of Mayideva, Sholapur, 1909,</p>
<p>§ 104. The highest class of Liṅgāyats is composed of those whocall themselves Liṅgi-Brāhmaṇas, the other castes or classes whowear the Liṅgabeing simply their followers. The Liṅgi-Brāhmaṇas consist of two main classes, the Ācāryasand the Pañcamas.The legendary account given of these is as follows. The Ācāryaswere originally five in number and sprang from the five faces,Sadyojāta, etc., of Śiva spoken of in a former section<sup id="fnref1:101"><a href="#fn:101" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">101</a></sup>. They arethe same as those mentioned above as having a metallic vesselplaced in their names on the occasion of any holy ceremony.From these five have sprung up all the priestly classes nowexisting. These five had five Gotras, viz. Vīra, Nandin, Vṛṣabha,Bhṛṅgin, and Skanda, who were originally persons almost as highas Śive himself. From the Īśāna face of Śiva sprang a Gaṇeśvara(leader of a group), who had five faces. From these five faces.sprang five Pañcamas, known by the names of Makhāri, Kālāri,Purāri, Smarāri, and Vedāri, which, the reader will remember,were the names of Śiva himself given to him on account of certaindeeds done by him. From these arose others who are called.Upapañcamas. Each Pañcama has to connect himself with oneof the five Ācāryas as his Guru. The Gotra of the Guru is hisGotra, and there can be no marriage relation between the members of the same Gotra. These Pañcamas have got Gotra, Pravarsand Śākhāof their own, and the Liṅgāyats thus seem to havecopied the Brṅhmanic system. The Pañicamas are spoken of asthe true devotees of Śiva<sup id="fnref1:102"><a href="#fn:102" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">102</a></sup>.</p>
<p>According to the ordinary acccunt the true Liṅgāyats aredivided into four classes: (1) Jaṅgamas, or priests, (2) Śīlavants,</p>
<p>or pious, (3) Banjigs, or traders, and (4) Pañcamsālis. The secondand the third classes are based on the occupation or mode of lifefollowed so that even here, there are only the two classes mentioned in the work referred to above. The members of the first orĀcārya class are popularly called Jaṅgamas. Of these there aresome who are called Viraktas (passionless) and who devote themselves to contemplation and other religious exercises and live a lifeof celibacy and asceticism. They maintain a convent (Maṭha)and are adored by all people.</p>
<p>One such convent, which might be called the chief convent, isthat which exists at Chitaldrug in the Mysore territory about ahundred miles from Dharwar. The head monk is held in deepreverence and exercises great influence over the followers of thesect.</p>
<p>The second division of the class comprises those who follow apriestly occupation and conduct all ceremonies. They are marriedmen and lead the life of householders. They exercise religiouscontrol over the Pañcamas and the followers of their sect. Thesepriestly Jaṅgamas are the representatives of one or other of thefive principal establishments located in different parts of thecountry from the Himālaya to the Mysore province. Any knottyquestion concerning the sect is decided by the final orders issuedat one of these establishments. Besides the true Liṅgāyats their isan affiliated class and another composed of half Liṅgāyats. TheLiṅgāyats abstain from meat and drink. Their widows areallowed to marry. And women are not considered polluted anduntouchable during the days of nonthly sickness, as is the case.among Brāhmaṇic Hindus.</p>
<p>$ 105. There is a Dīkṣāceremony among the Vīraśaivas corresponding to Upanayana among the Brāhmaṇas. Instead of theGāyatrīmantra of the latter, they have the Mantra Om namaśŚivāya&rsquo;, and have to wear the Liṅga, or emblem of Śiva, in theplace of Yajñopavīta. On the occasion of the Dīkṣā, the Guruholds a Liṅga in his left hand, worships it in the usual sixteenways, and shows it to the disciple. Then placing it in the lefthand of the disciple and enjolning him to look upon it as his ownsoul and as the highest existing thing and so forth, he ties itround the neck of the disciple with a silken cloth by repeating a</p>
<p>Mantra used by the Brāhmaṇas in putting on the Yajñopavīta,This is called the Liṅgasväyattadīkṣā. This ceremony is performed in the case of girls also, and the women too have to wear theLiṅga like men. The Liṅgais generally put into a box made ofsilver and suspended round the neck. The Vīraśaivas have togo through daily ceremonies similar to the twilight adorations ofthe Brāhmaṇas, and the Mantra repeated on the occasion is thatgiven above, as also the Śiva-Gāyatrī, the first two lines ofwhich are the same as the BrāhmaṇicGāyatrī, and the last is&rsquo;Tan naḥŚvaḥ pracodayāt&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In the marriage ceremony the Mantra to be repeated on theoccasion of the taking hold of the hand of the bride is the sameas among the Brāhmaṇas, and in the ceremony of walking theseven steps together with the bride, the formulas repeated arethe same as those used by Ṛgvedin Brāhmaṇas. But in theirmarriage ceremony, they do not perform the rite of throwingparched rice into the fire as the Brāhmaṇas do. The worship ofthe Liṅga, called Iṣṭa-Liṅga, worn on the body, is their chiefdivine worship; and attendance at temples and worship of theLiṅga therein are by no means necessary for them. They donot concern themselves directly with the public temples of Śiva.</p>
<p>§ 106. There is a traditional legend among the Liṅgāyatsthat, when Śiva brought Brahmadeva into existence, he told himto create the world. But Brahmadeva said that he did not knowhow to do it. Whereupon Śiva created it himself in order that it might serve him as a model. And the Ācāryas and Pañcamas, asdetailed above with their Gotras and Śākhās, are that creation ofŚiva. The true import of this legend is that the Liṅgāyat set upa system for themselves as a rival to the Brāhmaṇic system andthe close resemblance between the two confirms this view. Buta mere copy was not their object, and they introduced severalreforms, especially in the condition of women, as will have beenseen from the above notice. In this respect, this system differsfrom all other schools, Vaiṣṇavs or Śaiva or even Buddhist orJains, who did not set up for themselves a special system ofsocial relations and domestic rites, though, as shown above, thatframed by the Liṅgayats for themselves is a copy of that of theBrāhmaṇas, which, however, is a reformed copy.</p>
<p>The impression that this whole account creates in one is thatLiṅgāyatism owes its origin to a spirit of jealousy of the powerexercised by Brāhmaṇism and of rivalry with the system. Sucha spirit of jealousy and rivalry cannot be expected to have arisenin thoroughly depressed minds. The system therefore must havecome into existence among the spirited members of the upperclasses of non-BrāhmanicHindus under the leadership of a bodyof men composed of Brāhmaṇas known by the name of Ārādhyas.Some of the members of this body did not go far enough in thedesired reform, as mentioned before, and formed a distinct sect¹.</p>
<p>It will thus be seen that all the Liṅgāyats have not sprungup from the Śūdra caste, but there is a mixture of the threehigher orders among them. The claim that the two main classesof the sect put forward of their being Liṅgi-Brāhmaṇas, i, e.,Brāhmaṇas wearing the Liṅgā, seems to be founded on truth.The Ācārya or Jaṅgama class is said to have sprung from thefive holy persons, adored on the occasion of a religious ceremony,whose names end in the suffix ārādhyasignificative of their beingBrāhmaṇas. We might therefore safely take them to be of aBrāhmaṇic descent². As to the Pañcamas, they probably represent the Vaiśya order of the Brāhmaṇicsystem which followedthe occupation of traders and cultivators, and as the Vaiśyasbelong to the class of the twice-born, so also do the Pañcamasand hence they are included in the Liṅgi-Brāhmaṇa group.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1. An Ārādhya sect is mentioned by Anantānandagiri as having come intoconflict with Śaṁkarācārya / SeeŚaṁkarāvljaya, Bibl. Ind., p. 37). In thecorresponding portion of Dhanapati&rsquo;s Dinḍima which accompaniesMādhava&rsquo;s Śaṁkaravijaya the name of the seat does not occur; so that itis questionable whether the Ārādhya seot came into existence beforeŚaṁkara, even if we suppose that the seat mentioned by Anantānandagiriwas the same as the one we have noticed as affiliated to the Liṅgāyats.Or, on the evidence of Anantānandagiri the Ārādhya sect may be considered to have come into existence about the time of Śaṁkarācārya,that is, before the ninth century A. D., and the theory advanced, that theLiṅgāyat reform was carried out within its limits, and a portion of theĀrādhya sect adopted the new creed and developed it, while anotherremained orthodox and staunch to some of the Brāhmaṇicpractices. Tothis portion is to be traced the Ārādhyaseat of the present day.</p>
<p>2. There are Jaṅgamas who know Sanskrit, and I have been in communication with one such of the name of Mallikārjunaśāstrin, who directed me tosome of the books of the seat wich I have followed in this section, and alsogave oral information on some points. He claims to be a Brāhmaṇaauthorised to study the Vedas, his own Vada being the White Yajurveda.</p>
<p><strong>XII. Śaivism in the Draviḍa Country.</strong></p>
<p>§ 107. Śaivism prevails in the Draviḍa or Tamil country,and possesses an extensive literature of its own. It consists ofeleven collections. The first three contain the hymns composedby a saint held in great reverence, of the name Tirun̄ānasambandha. They are three hundred and eighty-four in number,each being called a Padigam, which consists of ten stanzas withan eleventh containing the author&rsquo;s name us ially added. Thenext three were composed by Appar who was an older contemporary of Sambandha, who had renounced Buddhism or ratherJainism and become a Śaiva. The seventh collection belongsto Sundara who was a Brāhmaṇa devotee of a later generation.These seven books are called Devāram and are compared to theBrähmaṇic Veda. In certain processions, while on the one sidethe hymns of the Brähmaṇic Veda are repeated, on the other aresung those contained in the Devaram which are addressed to thedeity. The Tiruvāśagam forms the eighth book, and it resembles.the Upaniṣads. The author of this book is Mānikkavāśagar.The ninth group is made up of hymns composed in imitation ofthe Devāram hymns. One of the writers is Kandarāditya, aCola king, from whom Rājarāja Cola, who came to the throne in984-85 A. D., was fifth in descent. The tenth contains mysticsongs of a Yogin called Tirumular. The eleventh collection iscomposed of miscellaneous pieces, the last ten of which werewritten by Nambi Āndār Nambi. The third of these ten formsthe basis of the Tamil Purāṇa called PeriyaPurāṇa. These elevencollections together with the PeriyaPurāṇa, which are all writtenin the Tamil language, form the sacred literature of the TamilŚaivas. Besides these there are the works of what are called.Santāns-Ācāryas, which are fourteen in number and called.Siddhāntaśāstras. Their contents are of a philosophical nature.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>The head monk of the Chitaldrug convent alladed to above was on avisitation to Poons about two months ago with all the state of a spiritualpotentate, having four elephants with him and a number of followers. Hewas a good, courteous and kindly person, bad studied Sanskrit grammarand was able to converse fluently in pure Sanskrit. Some of the books ofthe sect are written in Sanskrit.</p>
<p>The most highly honoured of all these writers is Tiruñānasambandha. He was a Brāhmaṇa by birth, and the poeticfaculty was developed in him very early in life. His hymns arefull of the purest devotional feeling and are melodious. Thetunes in which they were originally sung were Draviḍian, butin later times northern melodies with northern names came to beused. Sambandha&rsquo;s image is set up for worship in every Śaivaltemple, and he is adored by Tamil poets and philosophers in thebeginning of their works. He was a great enemy of Buddhistsand Jainas; and every tenth stanza of his Padigams, or hymns,contains an imprécation against them. On one occasion, he wasinvited by the queen of Kuni Pāṇdya of Madhurā, where he helda disputation with the Buddhists or Jainas, which ended in theconversion of the king to the Saiva faith¹.</p>
<p>In an Inscription in the Rājarājeśvara temple at Tanjore theking Rājarājadeva, after whom the temple was named, makes adaily allowance for the support of the reciters or singers of theTiruppadiyam or the Padigams of Tiruñānasambandba, beforethe twenty-ninth year of his reign². The date of Rājarāja&rsquo;saccession to the throne has been determined by the mention of alunar eclipse in one of his inscriptions to be 984-5 A. D<sup id="fnref1:103"><a href="#fn:103" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">103</a></sup>. Thisis consistent with the fact mentioned in another Inscription<sup id="fnref1:104"><a href="#fn:104" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">104</a></sup> thathe conquered Satyāśraya, who was the immediate successor ofTailapa, the founder of the later Cālukya dynasty of Mahārāṣṭra,and died in Śaka 930, or 1008 A. D. Thus before the twenty-ninthyear of Rājarāja, i. e. before 1013 A. D., the Padigams of Sambandha had come to be looked upon as so sacred that the recitation or singing of them was considered an act of religious meritlike the repetition of the Śatarudriya by the followers of theBrāhmaṇic Veda. This character the hymns of Sambandhacould not have acquired unless they had come into existenceabout four hundred years before the beginning of the eleventhcentury. This is consistent with the conclusion arrived at byMr. Pillai that Sambandha flourished in the seventh century.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1. The above account is mostly taken from the able paper of P. SundaramPillai published in the Ind. Ant. Vol. XXV, pp. 113ff. It is to be regrettedthat Mr. Pillai does not give us precise information as to whether it wasthe Buddhists against whom Sambandha direcss bis attacks or the Jainas.</p>
<p>2.South-Indian Inscriptions ed. by E. Hultzsch, Vol. I. p. 252, No. 65.</p>
<p>The Inscriptions in the temples at Kāñcipura contain evidenceof Śaivism being in a flourishing condition in the sixth century.The Pallava king Rājasiṁha constructed a temple, and the godinside was named after him Rājasiṁheśvara. Rājasiṁha appears.from some of the Inscriptions to have been a contemporary of theearly Cālukya prince Pulakeśin I<sup id="fnref1:105"><a href="#fn:105" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">105</a></sup>, who may be referred toabout the year 550 A. D., as his son Kīrtivarman I, came to thethrone about the year 567 A. D.².</p>
<p>The Śaivism that prevailed in the Tamil country seems tohave been generally of the ordinary kind, since the hymns in theDevāram sing the praises of Śiva and exhibit forvent devotionalfeeling, but there must have been some Darśana or system ofphilosophy also, since in an Inscription in the Rājasiṁheśvaratemple at Kāñci Atyantakāma, which was another name of Rājasiṁha, is represented as proficient in the system of the Śaivasiddhāntas. And the last species of the Śaiva Iterature detailedabove is, it will have been seen, called Siddhāntaśāstra composedby Santāna-Ācāryas. These must be philosophical works onŚaivism. And the system therein taught appears in all likelihoodto be the same or similar to the Śaivadarśana, which has alreadybeen explained. But what exactly the system taught by theSiddhāntas was, we have not the means of finding out, as none ofthe works is available for examination.</p>
<p>The Periyapurāṇa gives an account of sixty-three Bhaktas ordevotees of Śiva, and these correspond to the Ālvārs of theVaiṣṇavas. The enemies that both these classes of devotees hadto contend with were Jainas, and it appears to me that bothŚaivism and Vaiṣṇavism penetrated to the extreme South ofIndia after the revival of Brāhmaṇism in the North during thefourth and fifth centuries. Buddhism and Jainism had beenintroduced earlier, and were in possession of the field when thetwo later systems of theistic belief were introduced into theSouthern country. Hence arose the necessity of controversiesand contests which these systems carried on with their earlierpredecessors. Whether Śaivism extended itself to the Tamilcountry before the revival, we have not the means of determining.</p>

<p><strong>XIII. The Śāktas or Śakti Worshippers.</strong></p>
<p>§ 108. In the Vedic literature down to the Gṛhyasūtras whichwe have examined for tracing the development of the idea ofRudra-Śiva, no female devotee of predominant power is mentioned.We have such names as Rudrant and Bhavānī, which are simplyderivatives and do not show a belief in the existence of anindependent powerful goddess,Umā, too, is the wife of a godand does not overshadow her male consort. In the MBh,(Bhīṣmaparvan, chap. 23), however, there is a hymn addressedto Durgā by Arjuna under the advice of Kṛṣṇa in which she isprayed to for granting victory in the forthcoming battle. Thisbymn itself shows that at the time when it was composed andinserted in the poem, Durgāhad already acquired such animportance that she was adored by men as a powerful goddess,able to fulfil their desires. Among the names by which she isaddressed occur the following: Kumārī(maiden), Kālī(blackor female time as destroyer), Kāpālī(wearer of skulls), Mahākālī(the great destroyer), Caṇḍī(angry), Kātyayānī (of theKātya family ), Karālā(frightful), Vijayā(Victory), Kauśikī(of the Kusika family ), Umā, Kāntāravāsinī(dwelling in theforest). There is another hymn in the Vīrāṭaparvan (chap. 6)sung by Yudhiṣṭhira. It does not exist in the principal SouthernMSS., and is probably an interpolation, as it contains almost thesame matter as in a similar passage in the Harivaṁsa. Thepoints and epithets in this hymn which deserve notice are these.She is called Mahiṣāsuranāśinī(or the destroyer of the demonin the shape of a buffalo) and she is fond of wine, flesh and beasts.She was born to Yaśodā and dashed against a stone, whereupon</p>
<p>she went to heaven. She is called the most beloved of Nārāyaṇaand the sister of Vāsudeva. She resides permanently on theVindhya mountain.</p>
<p>It is related in the Harivaṁśa (vv. 3236 ff.) that Viṣṇudescended into the Pātāla, and asked sleep in the form of destroying time (NidrāKālarūpiṇī) to become the daughter ofYaśodā. She is told that she would become Kauśikīand wouldhave a permanent residence on the Vindhya mountain. There shewas told that she would kill Śumbha and Niśumbha and wouldbe worshipped by animal sacrifices. There is given a hymn toĀpyā(Durgā) in which she is represented as the goddess ofŚabaras, Pulindas, Barbaras and other wild tribes, and as fond ofwine and flesh.</p>
<p>The goddess that killed the buffalo-demon, was, according tothe Mārkaṇḍeya-Purāṇa (ch. 82) made up of the fierce radianceof Śiva, viṣṇu and Brahmadeva, and all the other gods contributed to the formation of her limbs as well as her ornaments.She is called Caṇḍīand AmbikāThe formation of the goddessthat killed Śumbha and Niśumbha, according to the account.which follows, is thus explained. The gods being oppressed bythe demons Śumbha and Niśumbha went to the Himālayas andpraised the goddess, whereupon Pārvatīcame out to bathe in theGanges. Then Śivā, also called Ambikā, came out of the body ofPārvatī, and said that it was she whom the gods were praising toinduce her to kill Śumbha and Niśumbha, She was calledKāuśikī, because she sprang out from Kośaor frame of Pārvatī&rsquo;sbody. When Ambikācame out of her body, Pārvatī&rsquo;s complexion became dark, and hence she received the name of Kālikā(darkone). In the course of the fight, when Śumbha and Niśumbhapounced upon her, her forehead became dark with anger, andfrom it came Kālīwith a frightful face wearing a garland ofskulls and a tiger-skin and with an infernal weapon (Khaṭvīṅga)in her hand. She killed the demons Caṇḍa and Muṇḍa, and wentback to Ambikā, who thereupon, since she had killed thosedemons, gave her the name Cāmuṇḍā. The seven Śaktis, Brāhmī,Māheśvarī, Kaumārī, Vaiṣṇavī, Varahī, Narasiṁhi and Aindrī, which are the powers or spirits of the gods from whom their</p>
<p>names are derived, are called her excellent forms (Vibhūtis).At the end, the goddess says that she would, in the VaivasvataManu, destroy Śumbha and Niśumbha again by assuming theform of the goddess residing on the Vindhya mountain, and proceeds to give the other forms that she would assume on otheroccasions such as the daughter of Nanda, Śākambharī, Bhīmā,Bhrāmarī, etc.</p>
<p>§ 109. In the account bere given, it will be seen that there isone goddess with a number of different names. But the criticaleye will see that they are not merely names, but indicate differentgoddesses who owed their conception to different historical conditions, but who were afterwards indentified with the one goddessby the usual mental habit of the Hindus. First we have Umā,the protectress, the consort of Śiva. Then we have Haimavatīand Pārvatīwhich are the epithets of Umā, since Siva, herconsort, was Giriśa, or dweller on the mountain, and she was awoman born on the mountain.</p>
<p>Then there are goddesses, dwelling in forests and on theVindhiya mountain, to whom animals and even human beings weresacrificed, and oblations of wine were given and who were alsothe goddesses worshipped by the wild tribes, such as Pulindas,Śabaras and Barbaras. These were fierce goddesses and have thenames of Karālā, Kālī, Caṇḍī, Cāmuṇḍā, and others. It must beadmitted, however, that the first two names came into use whenin an early age Rudra was identified with Agni, whose flames,which were considered his tongues, have those two names andfive others. Probably the ferocity of the later goddesses of thosenames was due to this identification and not to their being theobjects of worship to the ferocicus barbarous tribes. In all likelihood, however, both the elements contributed to give thatcharacter to Kālī, Karālāand Cāmuṇḍā. That an aboriginalelement should have contributed to the formation of Rudra&rsquo;sconsort in later times, as it did in earlier times, towards theformation of Rudra himself as he is represented in the Śatarudriya, is a matter that might be expected.</p>
<p>A third and powerful element in the conception of thesegoddesses is that of Śakti, or power. The powers of willing, acting,</p>
<p>creating, illuding, etc. were conceived of as goddesses as thenoun Śakti is of the feminine gender. The seven goddessesnamed above, Brāhmī, Maheśvarī, eto. owe their origin to thisconception of Śakti and the powers of the seven gods. In latertimes some of the Brāhmaṇic families came to have tutelarygoddesses, and thus we have Kātyayānī, or the goddess of theKātyas, and Kauśikī, the goddess of the Kauśikas. A furtherdevelopment went on especially under the influence of the idea ofŚakti, or power, and thus we have three forms in which thegoddess was worshipped. First we have the ordinary bland.form, in which the goddess is worshipped. Then we have thefierce form, in which she is associated with the schools ofKāpālikas and Kālāmukhas, and animals and human beings aresacrificed. And the third is the sensual form, in which she isthe object of worship with the school of the Sāktas, who are socalled because they are worshippers of Śakti.</p>
<p>§ 110. The Tantras inculcating the worship of the goddess inthese various forms, constitute a considerable body of literature.We will here notice the formation, doctrines and practices of aschool based on one of these forms, that which we have calledsensual. The goddess here is called Ānandabhairavī, Tripurasundarī, and Lalitā. Her dwelling is thus described. There isan ocean of nectar, in which there are five celestial trees. Thenthere is a row or enclosure of Nīpa or Kadamba trees, in themidst of which is a pavilion made of jewel stones. In thatpavilion is situated a palace made of the wish-giving stone,where lies the great Īśānī, the great Tripurasundarī, on a couch,which is Śiva, with Maheśana for its coverlet and Sadaśiva forits pillow. The legs of the couch are Brahmadeva, Hari, Rudraand Īśvara. These are spirits discharging certain functions contsined in the essence of Maheśvara¹. This is a mythologicalexplanation of certain figures in the mystic cirles and of technical terms. The goddess is thus elevated to the highest position.Ānandabhairava or Mahābhairava, which is the name given toŚiva, is the soul of, or is composed of, the nine collections ofthings of which the world is made up, such as time and itsvarious forms (Kālavyūha), existing things like the blue substance (Kulavyūha), names (Nāmavyūha), perception (Jñāvyūha), the five faculties, viz. consciousness, heart, will, intelligence, and mind (Cittavyūha). Mahābhairava is the soul of thegoddess; therefore she also is the soul of, or composed of, thenine collections. Buth, therefore, constitute one entity. Whenthere is Sāmarasya, or community of joy or intonse love betweenthem, creation follows. The female olement, or Mahābhairavī,however, is predominant in the process of creation and the maleelement, or Mahābhairava, in the work of destruction<sup id="fnref1:106"><a href="#fn:106" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">106</a></sup>.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.Saundaryalaharīwith Lakṣmīdhara&rsquo;s commentary, Mysore Ed, comment. on vv. 8 and 92.</p>
<p>The metaphysical doctrines of what is called Śāmbhavadarśana, on which the usual practices and rites of the Śaktasprofess to be based, are these². Śiva and Śakti are the primordialsubstances. Śiva in the form of Prakāśa (light) enters intoŚakti in the form of Vimarśa or Sphūrti (feeling or appearance)and assumes the form of a Bindu (drop); and Śakti similarlyenters into Śiva, whereupon the Bindu develops, and there arisesout of it the female element called Nāda (sound). These two,the Bindu and the Nada, becoming united, form one compoundBindu, and that substance represents the intense affinity betweenthe female and male energies and is called Kāma (love). Again,there are two drops, one of which is white and represents themale element, and the other, red, which represents the femaleelement. These form the Kalā; these three again, the compoundBindu, and the white and red drops form one substance called.Kāmakalā. Thus there are four powers united here: (1) theoriginal Bindu representing the material of which the world ismade; (2) Nāda, or sound, upon which depends the naming ofthe substances, arising from the development of the Bindu.Between these two there is intense love, but no creation followssimply from it. They only contain the materials of things andspeech Therefore a productive energy is associated with themby (3) the white male drop which, however, by itself cannctproduce, and by (4) the female red drop which is fecundated bythe male drop.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>2. The following contains in a recast form the matter given in pp. 89-91 ofmy Report on the Search for Sanskrit Manuscripts during 1883-84[Volume II of this Edition, pp. 219-223 N. B. U.]</p>
<p>When all these four principles unite into one substarce,Kāmakalā, the whole creation of words and the things expressedby them (Vāgarthau), proceeds. Another substance called theHārdhakalā is also developed, according to some, along with theNāda, when the female element first enters into the simple Bindu.In a certain text the highest deity, or Kāmakalā is spoken of ashaving the sun (compound Bindu) for her face, fire and moon(the red and white Bindus) for her breasts, and the Hārdhakalā for her organ of generation. This view provides a wombfrom which creation springs out. The creative agent, therefore,is a goddess thus constituted, and she is the highest deity and iscalled Parā, Lalitā, Bhaṭṭārikā and Tripurasundarī. Śiva issymbolically identified with the letter a and Śakti with <em>h,</em> thelast letter of the Sanskrit alphabet. This is called Ardhakalā,or half part, and hence the female element, or womb, mentionedabove is called the half part in the shape of the letter <em>A</em>. This<em>h</em>, or the half part, together with a which stands for Śiva is asymbolic representation of Kāmakalā or Tripurasundarī, who isthe result of the combination of Śiva and Śakti. She is thuscalled Aham, the ego, and is invested with egoism or individuality, and hence it is that all her developments (i. e. the wholecreation) have egoism or individuality; and all souls are butforms of Tripurasundarīand become Tripurasundarīwhen theystudy and practise the Kāmakalāvidyāwith its series of Devīcakras, or mystic circles. <em>A</em> and <em>h</em>, being the first and lastletters of the alphabet, contain between them all letters andthrough them all words, i. e. the whole speech; and just as allthings are produced from Tripurasundarī, so are all words whichexpress the things. She is thus called Parā, the first of the fourkinds of speech. Creation is Pariṇāma, or development, and not Vivarts, or the generation of false appearances. This is thephilosophy of the Śāmbhavadarśana, and it will be seen that,though it admits a male element in the beginning, still it isthoroughly subdued by the female element which becomes predominant; and the highest deity is a goddess, viz. Tripurasundarī.The ambition of every pious follower of the system is to becomeidentical with Tripurasundarī, and one of his religious exercisesis to habituate himself to think that he is a woman. Thus the</p>
<p>followers of the Śakti school justify their appellation by thebelief that God is a woman and it ought to be the aim of all tobecome a woman.</p>
<p>Tripurasundarīis propitiated and eventually attained byassuming the vow (Dīksā) of a devoted worship of her. Thisvow is of three kinds. The first consists in fully concentratingthe mind on the Devī as sitting on the lap of Siva in the Mahāpadmavana (a garden of lotuses), as possessed of a body whichis pure joy and is the original cause of all, and as identical withone&rsquo;s own self. The second is the Cakrapūjā, the worship bymeans of the mystic circles, which is a Bāhyayāga, or materialworship and the third consists in studying and knowing thetrue doctrine. The second is the proper Śakti ceremonial. Itconsists in the worship of a picture of the female organ drawnin the centre of another consisting of a representation of ninesuch organs, the whole of which forms the Śrīcakra The picturesare drawn on a Bhūrja leaf or a piece of silken cloth or on a gold.leaf<sup id="fnref1:107"><a href="#fn:107" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">107</a></sup>. With reference to this worship it must be observed thatthere are two classes of Śāktas: (1) Kaulika and (2) Samayin.The former worship the gross material object, while the latterhave a recourse to imagery. The worship of the pictures justmentioned is resorted to by ancient (Pūrva) Kaulas, while themodern (Uttara) Kaulas worship the organ of a living beautifulwoman. The Kaulas worship their goddess by offering to her,and themselves using, wine, flesh, honey (Madhu ), fish and suchother things. Tke Samayins, of course, abstain from suchpractices. There are even Brāhmaṇas, who secretly profess thedoctrines of the Sakta school and worship the goddess Tripurasundarīin accordance with the Pūrva-Kaula or Uttara-Kaula.way. There are no distinctions of caste when the worship of theBhairavīcakra is going on. Men of all castes become Brāhmaṇas,but they resume their own castes when the worship is over<sup id="fnref1:108"><a href="#fn:108" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">108</a></sup>.There are several more innocent and decorous modes of worshipping the goddess under the names of Lalits and Upāṅgalalitāmentioned in the ordinary religious books.

<p><strong>XIV. The Sect of Gāṇapatyas.</strong></p>
<p>§ 111. Rudra had his hosts of Maruts, who were called hisGaṇas, and the leader of these Gaṇas was Gaṇspati. The nameRudra, as we have seen, was generalised and signified a numberof spirits partaking of the character of the original Rudra; and sowas the name Gaṇspati generalised and meant many leaders ofthe Gaṇas or groups. Another name, Vināyaka, denoting a spiritalso came into use. In the AU. Rudra is identified with manygods or spirits, and among these there is one called Vināyaka.In the MBh. (Anuśāsanaparvan 151, v. 26) Gaṇeśvaras andVināyakas are mentioned amongst the gods, who observe theactions of men and are present everywhere; and again, (v. 57)Vināyakas are said to remove all evil from men when praised.Gaṇeśvaras, or Gaṇspatis, and Vināyakas are here represented,as the former are in the Śatarudriya, many in number andpresent everywhere.</p>
<p>In the Mānavagṛhyasūtra (2. 14) is given an account ofVināyakas. They are four in number. And their names are(1) Śalakaṭaṅkaṭa, (2) Kūṣmāṇḍarājaputra, (3) Usmita, and (4)Devayajana. When possessed by these a person pounds sods of earth, cuts grass, and writes on his body, and sees in dreams.waters, men with shaved heads, camels, pigs, asses, etc., and feelshe is moving in the air, and when walking, sees somebody pursuing him from behind. Again, when possessed by these, PrincesRoyal do not obtain the kingdom, though qualified to govern.Girls do not obtain bridegrooms, though possessed of thenecessary qualities. Women do not get children, even if otherwise qualified. The children of other women die. A learnedteacher qualified to teach does not obtain pupils, and there aremany interruptions and breaks in the course of student. Tradeand agriculture are unsuccessful.signs of being possessed by Vināyaka, is made to go through theA person, who shows suchceremony of bathing in waters brought from four places andwith a little earth from four different quarters thrown into them.</p>
<p>After bathing oblations of mustard oil extracted afresh should beoffered to the four Vināyakas in a ladle made of the wood of theUdumbara tree and poured over the head of the individual.Then food of many sorts, rice, husked and unhusked, flesh, andfish, cooked as well as raw, pulse of various kinds, etc. should beput into a basket and the basket placed on the ground where fourroads meet, the ground first being covered with Kuśagrass.Then certain deities including evil spirits are invoked, and awish expressed that they may be satisfied, and, becoming so,satisfy the worshipper, etc. This is the ceremony which freesthe persons haunted by the Vināyakas.</p>
<p>Yajñavalkya in his Smṛti (I. 271ff.) gives the same ceremonyBut the ceremony appearsand frequently in the same words.He beginsin a somewhat more developed or complicated formby stating that Rudra and Brahmadeva appointed Vināyaka tothe leadership of the Gaṇas, (i. e. made him Gaṇapati), andassigned to him the functions of raising difficulties and obstructions in the actions of men. In the Smṛti, one Vināyaka is onlyaddressed, but instead of the four names occurring in the Sūtra,six are given, viz. (1) Mita, (2) Sammita, (3) Śāla, (4) Kaṭaṅkaṭa,(5) Kūṣmāṇḍsa, and (6) Rajāputra, and these are said to be sixdifferent names of the one Vināyaka. After the basket withvarious kinds of food has been prepared, directions are given tomake an obeisance to Ambikā, the mother of Vināyaka.</p>
<p>The form of the ceremony contained in the Sūtra is unquestionably more ancient than that contained in the other work.But the difference between the two shows that during the periodthat had elapsed between the composition of the Sūtra and that ofthe Smṛti, the four Vināyakas had become one Gaṇapati-Vināyaka,having Ambikāfor his mother. It will thus be seen that, in hisown nature, this last god is an unfriendly or malignant spirit,but capable of being made friendly and benignant by propitiatoryrites. In this respect, he resembles Rudra himself. That theVināyakas had come to be objects of faith before the Christianera, may be taken to follow from the occurrence of the ceremonymentioned above in a Gṛhyasūtra. But the one Gaṇapati-Vināyaka, the son of Ambikā, was introduced into the Hindu pantheonmuch later.</p>
<p>None of the Gupta Inscriptions which I subjected to anexamination on a former occasion¹ contains any mention of hisname or announces any gift or benefaction in his honour. Butin two of the caves at Ellora, there are groups of images of Kāla, Kālī, the Seven Mothers or Śaktis, and Gaṇapati². These cavesare to be referred to the latter part of the eighth century. So thatbetween the end of the fifth and the end of the eighth centurythe Gaṇapati cult must have come into practice, and the Smṛtiof Yajñavalkya. must have been written not earlier than thesixth century. Another Inscription, and an old relic, whichindicate the prevalence of the worship of Gaṇapati, are found ata place called Ghaṭiyālā, 22 miles north-west of Jodhpur. Thereis a column there, on the top of which there are four images ofGaṇapati facing the four quarters. In the opening sentence ofthe Inscription engraved on it, an obeisance is made to Vināyaka.The date of the inscription is Vikrama-Saṁvat 918 = A. D. 862<sup id="fnref1:110"><a href="#fn:110" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">110</a></sup>.</p>
<p>When and how the god came to have the elephant&rsquo;s head, it isdifficult to determine. The images in the cave-temples at Ellorahave that head, and Bhavabhūti also in the beginning of theeighth century describes him, in the opening stanza of theMālatīmādhava, as possessed of such a head. Rudra-Śiva andthe gods allied with him were connected closely with forests andwild places, in which elephants also were found. The hide wornby Rudra and by his consort also in one of her forms was thehide of an elephant, and it perhaps suited the fancy of some mento place the head of that animal over the body of a god originallymischievous. Gaṇapati&rsquo;s reputation for wisdom is, I believe, tobe attributed to the confusion between him and Bṛhaspati, whoin ṚV. II. 23. 1 is called Gaṇapati. Bṛhaspati, of course, is theVedic god of wisdom, and is called the sage of sages.</p>
<p>§ 112. Six varieties of the Gāṇapatya sect are mentioned byĀnandagiri, or Anantānandagiri as he is sometimes called, in hisŚaṁkardigvijaya as well as by Dhanapati in his commentary onthe corresponding work of Mādhava. The first consists of thosewho adore Mahāgaṇapati. Mahāgaṇapati is, according to them,the creator, and he alone remains when Brahmadeva and othershave been destroyed at the time of the dissolution. He should bemeditated upon as possessed of his peculiar face with one toothand as embraced by the Śakti. By his own wonderful power, hecreates Brahmadeva and others. One, who repeats the original.Mantra and meditates on this Gaṇapati, attains supreme bliss.The name of the person who expounds these doctrines to theĀcārya is given as Girijāsuta.</p>

<p>2.In Rāvaṇa-ki-khai, in the circumambulatory passage and Rāmeśvara temples. See Cave-Temples by Fergusson and Burgess.</p>
<p>Another interlocutor follows. His name is Gaṇapatikumāra,and he adores Haridrāgaṇapati. He takes his stand on ṚV. II.23. 1, and makes out this text to mean &ldquo;We meditate on theewho art the leader of the group of Rudra, Viṣṇu, Brahman, Indraand others, and art the instructor of sages Bhṛgu, Guru, Seśa and others, the highest of all who know the sciences, the greatestlord of the Brahmans engaged in the creation of the world, i. e.adored by Brahman and others in the work of creation andothers&rdquo;. He should be worshipped and meditated on as being dressed in a yellow silken garment, bearing a yellow sacredthread, having four arms, three eyes and his face suffused overby turmeric ointment, and holding a noose and an elephant-goodand a staff in his hand. He who worships the god in this form,obtains emancipation Ganapati is the cause of the whole world,and Brahmāand others are his parts. The worshipper of thisGaṇapati should bear, on buth of his arms, the marks of Gaṇapati&rsquo;s face and one tooth impressed upon them by a heated ironstamp.</p>
<p>Then came Herambasuta, who was the worshipper of Ucchiṣṭagaṇapati. The followers of this variety resort to the left-handedpath (Vāmamārga), which probably was set up in imitation ofthe Kaula worship of Śakti. The form of Gaṇapati meditated.on is very obscene. There is no distinction of caste among thefollowers of this sect. No restriction is to be observed, such asmarriage imposes, and promiscuous intercourse is allowed andalso the use of wine. The follower should have a red mark onhis forehead. All the ordinary ceremonies, such as twilightadorations (Saṁdhyāvandana), are left to a man&rsquo;s own will.</p>
<p>The followers of the other three Gaṇapatis, Navanīta, Svarṇa,and Saṁtāna, worship their god, they say, according to the Sruti.But since Gaṇapati is adored in the beginning of every religiousact, he is the chief god and all the other gods are parts of himand should be worshipped as such. They regard the whole worldas Gaṇapati and adore him as such.</p>
<p>Since the god Gaṇapati-Vināyaka was introduced about thesixth century, it is questionable whether these several sectsexisted at the time of Saṁkarācārya. The imprinting of the faceand the tooth of the god on the arms was a custom common tothem with the Mādhva Vaiṣṇavas, though it is hardly indicativeof the period in which the sect arose. But the worship of Gaṇapati without reference to any particular sect is practised bynearly all Hindus at the beginning of any religious ceremonyand on special occasions. His image made of clay is worshippedwith great pomp in the Maratha country on the fourth lunar dayof the month of Bhādrapada (September), and at Chinchwad nearPoona there is a special establishment for the exclusive worshipof that god.</p>
<p><strong>XV. Skanda or Kārttikeya.</strong></p>
<p>** **§ 113. Another god whose worship was extensively practisedin ancient times, but is now rare, is Skanda or Kārttikeya. Thegeneral belief is that he was the son of Śiva and Pārvatī. Butin the Rāmāyaṇa he is represented as the son of the god of fireand Gaṅgā(I. chap 37). The foetus was thrown by Gaṅgāon the Himavat mountain, and it was nourished by the sixstars constituting the constellation of Kṛttikā (Pleiades), andwas thus called the son of the Kritikās or Kārttikeya. Inthe MBh. (Vanaparvan, chap. 229) also he is represented as theson of Fire, but the mother was Agni&rsquo;s true wife Svāhā, who hadassumed the forms of the wives of six Ṛṣis, whom Agni loved.But here he is called the son of Śiva also, as Agni is a form ofthat god. There are other stories connecting him with Śiva andPārvatī as his parents. But whatever the legend may have beenthere is no question that he was connected with Śiva, and wasthe leader of one of his Gaṇas. There is a Liṅgāyat traditionreported in the section on that sect<sup id="fnref1:111"><a href="#fn:111" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">111</a></sup>that he was a founder of a</p>
<p>Gotra, and was a form of Śiva himself. His having the peacockfor his vehicle is also consistent with his connection with Śiva,as peacocks are found in forests of which Rudra and hisattendants were gods. His being the leader of the army of the gods was an idea probably suggested by his being the leader of aGaṇa of Rudra. And in historical times he has been associatedwith Śiva. Under P. V. 3. 99, Patañjali mentions the images ofŚiva, Skanda and Viśakha as being worshipped in his time. Onthe reverse of the coins of the Kuṣana prince Kaniṣka, there arefigures with their names in Greek letters of Skando, Mahaseno,Komaro and Bizago<sup id="fnref1:112"><a href="#fn:112" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">112</a></sup>.The first is Skanda, and because he wasthe commander of the army of the gods, he was also called.The third isMahāsena, which is the second name on the coin.Kumāra, which is also a name of Skanda, and the fourth is theSkr. Viśākha. If the first three were the names of one deity only,there was no necessity for giving three names and three figures.These, therefore, must have been regarded as three different godsas Viśākha undoubtedly was from his being mentioned separatelyfrom Skanda by Patañjali. In the story in the MBh. referred toabove Viśākha is mentioned as having arisen from the right sideof Skanda when it was struck by Indra&rsquo;s thunderbolt. This isindicative of the tendency to make the two as one person; andthey appear to have been so made in later times. Or, looking tothe fact that there are two names of Buddha on the coins, the above three may have been the names of one single deity. There arealso three indications of the prevalence of the worship of Skandaor Māhasena in the early centuries. In the year 414 A. D. wasbuilt a Pratolt, or gallery, in the temple of Svāmi-Mahāsena byone Dhruvaśarman at Bilsād<sup id="fnref1:113"><a href="#fn:113" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">113</a></sup>. Several holy observances and vows in the name of Kumāra and Kārttikeya are mentioned inHemādri&rsquo;s Vratakhaṇḍa, and the worship of that god has notbecome obsolete even at the present day.</p>
<p><strong>XVI. The Sect of Sauras and the Northern Sun-Worship.</strong></p>
<p>§ 114. Sūrya, or the sun as the orb that is seen in the skyand not as an imaginary god of light, was a Vedic deity. It is</p>
<p>but reasonable to expect that the worship of such a deity shouldnot become obsolete in later times, since the orb of the sun isdaily seen in the sky. In two passages in ṚV. (VII. 60. 1; 62.2)the singer wishes the rising sun to declare him sinless to Mitra,Varuṇa, and other gods. This idea probably arose from the factthat the rising sun by his bright light discloses everything thathas been done in the darkness of the previous night, and thenceit developed into a belief that the sun destroys sins. Kauṣītakiis represented to have adored the sun in the morning, at midday,and in the evening, and having made offerings of water withflowers, sandal, etc. or without (Arghya), prayed for the removalof his sins (KBU. II. 7). And this is what we do or are expectedto do in our twilight and midday adorations.</p>
<p>Water is sipped by repenting a formula expressive of a wishthat the Sun, Manyu and Manyupati may protect the adorer fromsins (AG. Pariśiṣṭa I. 3, and TA. X. 25. 1). After that, three offeringsof water with or without the other ingredients are made to the sunafter repeating the Gāyatrī, and then the water is whirled roundhis head by the adorer by repeating the Mantra &ldquo;That Āditya isBrahman<sup id="fnref1:114"><a href="#fn:114" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">114</a></sup>&rdquo; Āśvalāyana directs that, while adoring the morningtwilight, one facing the east should repeat the Gāyatrī-Mantratill the whole disc of the sun has risen, and in the evening withhis face towards the west till the whole has gone down and thestars have begun to appear (AG. III. 7. 4—6).</p>
<p>In the Upanayana ceremony, when the boy is invested withthe sacred thread and other badges of a student&rsquo;s life, he is madeto look at the orb of the sun, when the preceptor, addressing thatdeity, prays &ldquo;Oh god Savitar, this is thy student, protect him.May he not die &quot; (AG. I. 20. 6). Khādira prescribes the adoration of the sun for the enjoyment of riches and for the attainmentof fame (Khādiragṛhyasūtra IV. 1. 14 and 23). The hymnaddressed by Yudhiṣṭhira to the sun after he entered his forestresidence, and his having obtained a vessel from him for theproduction of all the food wanted by him, his family andfollowers, are well-known.</p>
<p>In the seventh century Mayūra, who lived at the court of</p>
<p>Harṣavardhana, composed a hundred stanzas to obtain relieffrom the white leprosy from which he suffered. About the beginning of the eighth century Bhavabhūti makes the Sūtradhāra,or the manager, of the Mālatīmādhava offer prayers to the risingsun to remove all his sins and bestow holy blessings on him.</p>
<p>Thus the sun has been adored since the Vedic times for theremoval of sins, and the bestowal of riches, food, fame, health,and other blessings. At the present day twelve prostrations aremade to Sūrya by repeating twelve of his nemes, all of whichhave a Sanskrit etymology, and there is no foreign look aboutthem. There is also a more elaborate set of such prostrations.</p>
<p>§ 115. It cannot but be expected, therefore, that a schoolshould come into existence for the exclusive worship of the sun.And such a school is that of the Sauras. Ānandagiri bringsŚaṁkarainto contact with the followers of this sect at a place inthe south called Subrahmaṇya situated at the distance of fourteendays&rsquo; journey from Anantaśayana or Trivendram. The name oftheir leader was Divākara, and they wore a circular spot of redsandal on the forehead and bore red flowers. The substance ofthe account of this school given by Divākara is as follows:—</p>
<p>The Supreme Soul, the Sun, is the author of the world. Heis the tutelary deity of the Sauras and is adored by them. TheŚrutis themselves speak of him as the cause of the world, suchas &ldquo;the sun is the soul of moveable and immoveable things&rdquo;(RV. I. 115. 1) and &ldquo;That Āditya is Brahman&rdquo;. Brahman withwhich the sun has thus been identified is the cause of the wholeworld, according to the text, from which all these beings originate,etc. (TU. III. 1. 1.). There is also a Smṛti text in favour of thisdoctrine. There are six classes of devotees of the sun all bearinga mark made by red sandal, wearing a garland of red flowers,and repeating the formula of eight syllables. Some worship theorb of the sun who has just risen as Brahmadeva, the creator,others, the sun on the meridian as Īśvara, the destroyer. He is alsoregarded as the originator. Some regard the setting sun as Viṣṇu,the protector, and, considering him as the cause of the creation.and destruction also and as the highest entity, worship him. Thereare some who resort to all the three suns as a triple form. Others,observing the vow of regularly seeing the orb, adore the Supreme. Soul as existing in it with golden whiskers and golden hair. Onesection of this class is devoted simply to the vow of the observation of the disc, and they see the orb, worship it in the sixteenways, dedicate all their actions to the god, and do not eat with.out seeing the orb. The devotees of the sixth class imprint theorb on their forehead, arms and busom with a heated iron pieceand meditate on the god in their minds continuously. All thesesix classes have to repeat the same Mantra, or formula, of eightsyllables. The followers of this creed like other sectarians interpret various Vedic texts as setting forth the greatness and thesupremacy of their own god. The Puruṣasūkta (ṚV. X. 90) andthe Śatarudriya are so expounded, and the conclusion is that allwho desire emancipation should adore the sun, should bear hismarks on the body, and mutter the Mantra.</p>
<p>§ 116. So far there is no trace of foreign influence in thedevelopment of the Saura system. But such an influence undoubtedly contributed to the growth of the sun-worship prevalentin Northern India from the early centuries of the Christian era.Varāhamihira in the stanza twice quoted before (Bṛhatsaṁhitā,chap. 60, 19) tells us that the installation and consecration of theimages and temples of the sun should be caused to be made bythe Magas, and generally those who worship a certain deityaccording to their special ritual should be made to perform theceremony concerning that deity. This shows that the Magaswere, according to Varāhamihira, the special priests of the sungod. There is a legend concerning this matter in the Bhavisyapurāṇa (chap. 139). Sämba, the son of Kṛṣṇa by Jāmbavati, constructed a temple of the sun on the banks of the Candrabhāgā,the modern Chenab in the Punjab, and no local Brāhmaṇa wouldaccept the office of a regular priest of the temple. He thereuponasked Gauramukha, the priest of Ugrasena. He told him to getMagas, who were special sun-worshippers, from Śakadvīpa. Thenis given the history of the Magas. Sujihva was a Brāhmaṇa ofthe Mihira Gotra. He had a daughter of the name of Nikṣubhā,with whom the sun fell in love. The son of these two was calledJaraśabda or Jaraśasta, and from him sprang all Magas. Theywore a girdle round their waist, which was called Avyaṅga.Thereupon Sāmbā went on the back of Garuḍa, his father&rsquo;s</p>
<p>vehicle, to Śākadvīpa, brought some Magas from it and installedthem into the office of priests of the temple he had constructed.</p>
<p>The Magas have long been known in the literary history ofIndia. There is an Inscription at Govindapur in the GayāDistrict duted Śaka 1059, corresponding to 1137-38 A. D., in theopening stanza of which the Magas, who sprang from the sun,are represented to have been brought into the country by Sāmba.Six great poets, the works of some of whom are extant, are alsomentioned. There are traces of the Magas elsewhere, and there.Are Brāhmaṇas of that name in Rajputana and some otherprovinces of Northern India.</p>
<p>Now these Magas are the Magi of ancient Persia, and thename Jaraśasta mentioned above as occurring in the Bhaviṣyapurāṇaconnects them with the Avesta prophet Zarathushtra.The Avyaṅga, which according to the Purans they wore roundtheir waist, was the same as the Aivyāonghen of the Avestalanguage, which last signifies the Kusti worn by the Parsees atthe present day. Albērūnī, speaking of the Persian priestsMagians, says that they existed in India and were called Magas<sup id="fnref1:115"><a href="#fn:115" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">115</a></sup>.The idea of locating them on a continent called Śākadvīpamusthave arisen from the fact that they were foreigners like theŚakas, with whom the Indians had been familiar since thesecond or third century before the Christian era.</p>
<p>Evidently then the worship of the sun or Mihira-worship wasbrought into India by the old Persian priests Magi, but at whoseinstance and under what circumstances they came it is difficultto say. The legendary tradition of their having been brought bySāmba was current in the first half of the twelfth century, as wehave seen from the Inscription. The temple on the Candrabhāgāreferred to above was that which existed at Multan, and a glowingdescription of which is given by the Chinese traveller HiuenTsiang. Four centuries later it was seen by Albērūnī<sup id="fnref1:116"><a href="#fn:116" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">116</a></sup>. Itexisted till the seventeenth century, when it was finally destroyedby Auranzeb. Multan is the same as the Sanskrit Mūlasthāna,and this name may have been given to the place, because the</p>
<p>new worship of the sun was first organised there and it was itsoriginal seat.</p>
<p>On the coins of Kaniṣka there occurs a figure with the nameMiiro = Mihira by its side. Mihirais the Sanskritised form ofthe Persian Mihr, which is a corruption of Mithra, the Avesticform of the Vedic Mitra. The cult of Mihr had originated inPersia, and it extended itself up to Asia Minor and even Rome,and the proselytising energy which characterised its firstadherents must have led to its extension towards the east also,and of this extension the figure of Mihira on Kaniṣka&rsquo;s coin is anevidence. The cult, therefore, must have penetrated to Indiaabout the time of that Kuṣana prince, and the Multan temple.which was its original seat must have beeu constructed aboutthe same time.</p>
<p>An Inscription at Mandasaur records the construction of atemple to the sun in the year 437 A. D. by a guild of weavers, andits repair in the year 473 A. D. Another on a copperplate foundat Indore in the Bulandsbahar District in the United Provincesmentions an endowment of Devaviṣṇu in 464 A. D. for lightinga lamp in a temple of the sun. And in a third is recorded agrant in 511 A. D. to a temple of Āditya, or the sun. A greatmany more sun temples have been discovered especially inWestern India from Multan down to Cutch and northern Gujarat¹.The ruins of one exist at Moḍherā, eighteen miles to the south ofPāṭaṇ in the last-named province, and they contain the dateVikrama 1083 corresponding to 1027 A. D. There was anotherat Gwalior constructed in the time of Mihirakula, the HūṇaPrince, in the beginning of the sixth century.</p>
<p>The form of the idol of the sun worshipped in such temples isdescribed by Varāhamihira (Bṛhatsaṁhitā, chap. 58), but thefeatures mentioned by him which have a significance for ourpresent purpose are that his feet and legs should be enclosed orcovered up to the knees and he should be dressed in the fashionprevalent in the North (v. 46), and that he should be encircledby an Avayṅga (v. 47). Accordingly the images of the sunthat are found in the temples mentioned above havebootsreaching up to the knees, and a girdle round the waist withone end hanging downwards<sup id="fnref1:117"><a href="#fn:117" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">117</a></sup>. This last is a Persian feature,as we have already seen, and the other also must have the sameor similar origin. It certainly is not Indian. The features of the idol of the sun and the fact of Magas, who were descendedfrom the Persian Magi, being its priests point unmistakably tothe conclusion that the cult was introduced into Indis fromPersis, and I believe that the construction of so many templeswas also due to the foreign influence. For, in the account of theSaura systems we have given above, there is not the remotestallusion to a temple of the sun. According to all appearances,therefore, the cult prevalent in Northern India was entirelydistinct from those systems. It does not appear to have allieditself with any one of these latter. But it was accepted by themass of the Hindus as a general worship of the sun, and thefeelings which it evoked could not have been different from thosewhich the indigenous worship gave rise to. And the manner inwhich devotion to the sun is expressed in the Inscriptions whichwe find in some of the temples, has nothing special or foreign init. The Magas themselves, the priests of the new cult, weregradually thoroughly Hinduised until they became undistinguishable from the other Hindus and formed only a separatecaste.</p>

<p>In the copper-plate grant of Harṣavardhana, who lived in themiddle of the seventh century, his father Prabhākarvardhana,his grandfather Ādityavardhana and his great-grandfather Rājyavardhana are all styled great devotees of the sun (Paramādityabhakta)<sup id="fnref1:118"><a href="#fn:118" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">118</a></sup>. This is an evidence to show that the sun cult, probablymade up of a mixture of the indigenous and foreign forms,prevailed in the beginning of the sixth century and was professedby great princes.</p>
<p><strong>XVII. Résumé of Śaivism &amp; Other Minor Systems, Part II.</strong></p>
<p>§ 117. The fearful and destructive phenomena of nature ledto the conception of, and belief in, the god Rudrs, the terriblehowler, accompanied by his groups, or Gaṇas, called sometimes</p>
<p>Rudras or Rudriyas, who were minor howlers. This god, whenpropitiated, became the auspicious Śiva, the beneficent Śaṁkaraand the benignant Śaṁbhu. The conception gradually developedfurther, until Rudra became the god of wild and awful scenes,such as cemeteries, mountains and forests. Of the beasts andsavages that dwelt in these last and of the thieves and outcaststhat resorted to them, he became the lord. Subsequently hedeveloped into the god who pervades the universe. dwells in fireand water in all beings and in herbs and trees and was thesupreme ruler of all. When he rose to this position, he becamethe subject of Upaniṣad speculation, by meditating on whom andseeing whom everywhere in the universe a man attained blissfulserenity.</p>
<p>But the awful and wild side of his nature was not effaced, butwent on developing; and when religious schools such as that ofthe Pāñcarātras came to be established, one with Rudra or Pāśupati as the god to be adored was set up some time after. Its founderwas a human being, who came to be known as Lakuṭin or Lakulin,the holder of a club, and Lakulīśa or Nakulīśa, the lord, theholder of the club. Pāñcartha was the title of the work attributedto him, and his system came to be known by the name of Pāśupata. Two extreme schools were developed out of this, and alsoone, which was more moderate, known by the name of the Śaiva.Traces of these schools have been found from about the secondcentury of the Christian era to about the twelfth.</p>
<p>But the repulsive nature of the two extreme schools and thewild and fantastic character of the other two led to a reaction,and in the beginning of the ninth century we have the first.Kaśmir school; and about a hundred years afterwards wasfounded another. These are very sober in their doctrines andpractices, and may be considered to have been influenced by theschool of Śaṁkara, though an escape from his severe spiritualmonism has been provided for, so as to allow of an individualexistence to the delivered soul.A further reform was effected about the middle of the eleventhcentury by the Liṅgāyat school. The philosophical doctrines ofthis school amount to this: that God is infinite intelligence and</p>
<p>joy, is the creator of the world and the instructor and redeemer ofmankind, and that the individual soul attains to a unity of blissful experience with him by gradually estranging himself fromthe world, pursuing a course of devotional worship, abandoninghimself to God and seeing him in everything. This philosophy seems to have been influenced by the tenets of the school ofRāmānuja, The spirit of the Liṅgāyats was, however, combative,and they set up for themselves a community distinct from thatwhich owes its origin to the Brāhmanic system. All the while,however, during the existence of these schools the generalworship of Rudra-Śiva has prevailed among ordinary people,regardless of the doctrines of these schools.</p>
<p>Śiva was associated with his consort Pārvatīor Umā. Shetoo had a beneficent and majestic character as alluded to in theKnU. But just as an aboriginal element contributed to theformation of the character of Rudra-Śiva, so an aboriginal element of a more distinct nature came to be combined with hisconsort, and she became a berrible goddess that had to beBut since theappeased by animal and even human sacrificeslustful nature of man is very strong in him, that goddess underthe name of Tripurasundarī(the beauty of the three cities) orLalitā(sportively graceful) became the creator of the world, andwas also worshipped with debasing and sensual rites; and thuscame in the school of the Śāktas, who looked forward to anidentity with Tripurasundarīas the goal of their existence.</p>
<p>Gaṇapati as the leader of a host was, of course, connectedwith Rudra-Śiva. That idea became mingled with the idea ofVināyaka, an evil spirit that possessed men, and thus the combined god Gaṇapati-Vināyaka became an object of worship onthe principle that an obstructive and evil spirit should be firstpropitiated before beginning an action. Thereafter he becamethe special god of six minor sects, one of these holding doctrinesas debasing as those of the Śākta cult.</p>
<p>Skanda was more closely connected with Śiva as the lord ofhis Gaṇas or groups; and afterwards came to be believed to behIs son; and his worship prevailed for several centuriesfrom the time of Patañjali downwards and has not becomeobsolete even at the present day.</p>
<p>The Sun was a god worshipped in early times and his cult didnot disappear, as his orb was daily visible. But he became theobject of sectarian worship some time later. About the thirdcentury, however, of the Christian era, another cult of the Sunwas introduced from Persia. It took root on Indian soil andprevailed for a long time in North-Western India, a good manysplendid temples having been erected from time to time for hisworship. A special caste of priests of the name of Magas wasassociated with the cult, and the masses of the Hindu populationadopted it as if it had been indigenous to the country.</p>
<p><strong>XVIII. Hindu Theism and Pantheism.</strong></p>
<p>§ 118. As the theoretic or philosophicportion of the doctrines,taught by the founders of most of the various systems we haveexamined, are based on certain fundamental ideas contained inthe Upaniṣads and the Bhagavadgītā, I deem it necessary to devotethis last section to a consideration of the question as to whatthose ideas definitely are, and to what extent they have beenadopted or modified by the promulgators of those systems tosuit their specific purposes.</p>
<p>In discussing these ideas, some scholars make a broad distinction between Vedantism, which they identify with Pantheism,and Theism. If they find any passage expressive of the immanence of God in the world in a work whose main aim is theistic,they consider such a passage to be interpolated. I have alreadyalluded to this mental attitude in the beginning of the presentwork, but it is necessary to say something more on the subject.If they mean by Theism the Deism of the eighteenth century,according to which the world is a machine constructed and setin motion by God, who remains apart from it, with perhaps theadditional doctrine that he enters into relations with men whoworship him and appeal to him, they are probably right. Butthis is not Hindu Theism. The immanence of God in theexternal world and in the heart of man is its essential doctrine.But that is perfectly consistent with the belief in God&rsquo;s transcendency, that is, his being distinct from the world and manand above them, influencing them, controlling them, protecting them, and listening to prayers. That the ideas of</p>
<p>immanence and transcendency are not incompatible or inconsistent with each other is admitted even by European thinkers.The Theism of the Bhagavadgītā is a Theism of this nature, andconsequently the passages expressive of immanence are by notmeans to be regarded as interpolated. Theism of this nature iscontained in the Upanişads also, though there are pantheisticdoctrines of varied sorts.</p>
<p>Pantheism as formulated by Spinoza is thus stated:— &ldquo;God,though undetermined <em>ab extra</em>, is capable of infinite self-determination. Thus God, the <em>causa suf</em>, manifests himself in an infinitemultiplicity of particular modes. Spinoza is, therefore, both pantheist and pancosmist: God exists only as realised in the cosmos:the cosmos exists only as a manifestation of God¹.&rdquo; The Upaniṣadscontain pantheistic doctrines corresponding to what is stated inthe first two sentences of this quctation. There are affirmationsthat when one thing is known, everything becomes known, as inthe case of a ball of earth, on knowing the true nature of whichone knows the true nature of all that is made of earth, etc.(ChU. VI. 1.4); that when the soul is seen, heard and knownall this becomes known, and the Brahman, the Kṣatra, theseworlds, these gods, these Vedas, these elements, all this is thesoul (BU. IV. 4. 6). Then again there are such statements as:&ldquo;That Sat alone existed in the beginning, one without a second.That reflected &ldquo;I may be many and multiply&rdquo;. It created light&quot;This statement is to the effect that everything existing is a formor modification of God. There are many such passages in theUpaniṣads and several of these are quoted in Śaṁkarācārya&rsquo;sBhaṣya on the Brahmasūtras I. 4. 23-27. But it is by nomeans to be inferred that the Upaniṣad Pantheism is of thenature set forth in the last sentence of the quotation fromSpinoza, that is; Brahman is, not exhausted in the world,but it exists separately also. But the objection to this view isthat Brahman being of the nature of spirit is not like the bodydivisible into parts, so that one may become developed into theworld and another re nain outside; and this is affirmed in a textof the ŚU. (VI. 19). This inconsistency is removed by Bādarā-yaṇa in Brahmasūtras II. 1. 26-27. The argument is that thoughthe Upaniṣads state that the constituent cause of the world isBrahman, they at the same time affirm the existence of Brahmanseparately from the world (ChU. III.12. 6; and VI. 3.2). Thetwo are inconsistent on the theory that Brahman is a spirit andnot discerptible into parts. Though they are thus inconsistentthey must both be accepted on the authority of the sacred texts,since the true nature of Brahman and the world is beyond thereach of human intellect. This solution of the difficulty is inadmissible to non-believers in the sacred texts, but it shows thatBādarāyaṇa does not agree with the latter part of Spnoza&rsquo;sdefinition of Pantheism, i. e., according to him, the sacred textsdo not affirm that &ldquo;God exists only as realised in the cosmos: thecosmos exists only as a manifestation of God&rdquo;. The inconsisteney pointed out by him is based on the impossible conceptionof Brahman&rsquo;s being divisible into parts. But it will not arise ifinstead of bringing in this conception, we suppose that in oneaspect Brahman is the material or constituent cause of the worldor realised in the world, and from another point of view, itremains pure and becomes the object of contemplation and devotion. Whatever it may be, Bādarāyaṇa&rsquo;s view appears to me tobe correct, and the Pantheism of the Upaniṣads is not exactly thesame as that formulated by Spinoza.<br>
___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.Encyclopedia Britarica, Eleventh Edition, Vol XX, p. 683a, under Pantheism.</p>
<p>But even this partial Pantheism is only one of the doctrinesset forth in the Upaniṣads. As mentioned in the beginning theycontain the rudiments not only of one system of religious philosophy, but of a good many and even of Buddhism.WhenBrahman or the Supreme Soul is affirmed to be distinct from theworld and thus there is a denial of the partial Pantheism I havespoken of, that soul is represented as dwelling in the externalworld and in the soul of man; that is to say. Theism is taughtwith the immanency of God in the world and in man. Forinstance in the BU. III. 7. 7-30<sup id="fnref1:119"><a href="#fn:119" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">119</a></sup> we have first &ldquo;He who dwelling.in the earth is distinct from it, whom the earth does not know,whose body the earth is, and who, being in the inside, controls theearth, is the indestructible controlling soul&rdquo;. In the followingpassages up to 30 we have precisely the same statement about water,</p>
<p>fire, the sky, wind, the sun, the moon and stars, the quarters, thelightning, thunderbolt, all the worlds, all the Vedas, all &lsquo;sacrifices,all beings, the vital breath, speech, the eye, the ear, the mind, theskin, light, darkness, the seminal fluid, and the (individual) soul.Here the inward controlling soul is mentioned as distinct fromthe earth and all the rest, up to the individual soul, and still asdwelling in them, controlling them from the inside, and havingthese for his body. The whole section winds up with the affirmation that this controlling soul is not seen, but is the seer is notheard, but hears; is not apprehended by thought, but apprehendsby thought; is not known, but knows; there is no other seer, noother hearer, no other apprehender, and there is no other knower.Herein are brought out the peculiar points of Hindu Theism :God is the only seer, the only hearer, and the only knower, thatis, he is all-seeing, all-hearing, and all-knowing; and nobody cansee him, hear him, or know him. He is distinct from all objects,but dwells in them and controlls them. Texts expressive of suchan immanency are to be found in many places in the Upaniṣads.God being thus distinct from the world, though immanent, canbe the object of devoted meditation, and can be attained by meansof truth, knowledge and purity. Mere immanency of this naturedoes not at all constitute the Pantheism formulated by Spinoza.There is therefore no ground whatever for regarding as aninterpolation the occurrence of texts expressive of it in sucha theistic work as the Bhagavadgītā.</p>
<p>We have noticed above the manner in which Bādarāyaṇaremoves the inconsistency between God&rsquo;s developing himself intothe world, while at the same time he is transcendent, and hisbeing a simple spirit without parts. Śaṁkarācārya fairly explains,I think, Bādarāyaṇa&rsquo;s view. But raising a further objection, hebrings in his own doctrine eventually, that the so-called development of Brahman into the world is fancied by ignorance and isnot true, that is, the world is an illusion. There are two doctrinesative of the relation of God to the world, the so-calledPariṇāmavāda and the Vivartavāda. The former implies realdevelopment and the latter, an illusive development. This last isthe doctrine of Śaṁkarācārya, wherefore his system should becalled Singularism rather than spiritual monism; while the first</p>
<p>is that clearly held by the author of the Sūtras. This is evidentfrom his very definition of Brahman as that from which everything originates, in which everything lives, and into whicheverything resolves itself in the end, and from the manner inwhich in the first Pāda of the Second Chapter he answers theobjections based upon the theory that an intelligent beingcannot develcp into non-intelligent or insensate matter; andŚaṁkarācārya</p>
<p>himself acknowledges at the end of his comment onII. 1. 14 that the author of the Sutras follows the Pariṇāma doctrinethough to save his theory, he imagines without any groundsthat Bādarāyaṇa has in view the ordinary or illusory conditionof things in doing so.</p>
<p>Śaṁkarācārya&rsquo;s Vivartavāda it was which the later schools ofVaiṣṇavism and Śaivism contended against; for even accordingto him, it leaves no scope for the relation of the ruler and theruled, i. e., God and the devotee, in the condition of reality whenall illusion is dispelled and one spirit alone exists (II. 1.14).Most of them adopted Bādarāyaṇa&rsquo;s Pariņāmavāda, but thedistinctness of God, man and the world, which was necessary forthe validity of their doctrines of worship and devotion, theysecured by qualifying the mode of development. By this qualification they also steered clear of the inconsistency pointed outby Bādarāyaṇa in II. 1. 26, so that his mode of satisfaction wasnot necessary for them. Rāmānuja lays down that the rudimentsof the individual souls and of the insensate world exist in Godhimself as his characteristics or body, and with these he developsinto the world, thus giving rise to the three distinct substances, the material world, the individual soul, and God as the controller.Nimbārka maintains that the other two substances do notcharacterise God or form his body, but are dependent upon himfor their existence, and in a subtle form constitute his power orcapacity, which develops into the animate and inanimate world.Viṣṇusvāmin, and therefore Vallabha, hold that the highest God,or Parabrahman, manifests himself as the material world, theindividual soul, and the supreme controller, but in the course ofdeve opent his attributes of intelligence and joy are concealeby his mysterious power, and thus is produced the materialworld, while, his joy alone being concealed, individual souls</p>
<p>come into existence, and when the three are manifest or unconcealed, he becomes the supreme controller. Vallabha adds twoother forms of Parabrahman or Puruṣottama, as mentioned inthe section<sup id="fnref1:120"><a href="#fn:120" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">120</a></sup> on this system. Madhva rejects the doctrine ofGod being the constituent cause of the world and consequentlythat of his development, and lays down the five eternaldistinctions between God, man, and the world and betweendifferent individuals and objects involved in the last twoOf the older Śaiva schools, the Pāśupata brings in thePradhāna of the Sāṁkhyas with its developments as the materialcause of the world, with Paśupati as the efficient cause. ŚrīkaṇthaŚivācārya in his comment on Br. S. II. 2. 38, states that accordingto his predecessors, a certain branch of the philosophy based onthe sacred texts revealed by Śiva (Āgamas) held Śiva to be onlythe efficient cause of the world. This must be a reference to theŚaiva school which, as we have already stated, was a dualisticor pluralistic school. The Vāyavīyasaṁhitāaccording to himstates that Śakti, or power, first originates um Śiva, thenceMāyā, thence Avyakta (I. 7. 3). By Māyāis to be understoodthe wonderful creative power of Śiva, as is evident from thefollowing verse 4, and Avyakta means the Pradhāna, as appearsfrom that verse as well as verse 7. He gives another verse whichsets forth that everything from the Śakti to the earth is producedfrom the essence of Śiva, so that Śiva through the Śakti is boththe efficient and the constituent cause of the world. This Śaktiis brought in by those who hold creation to be the development ofŚiva, while it is not wanted for those Śaiva philosophers whowould keep the creative principle Maya or Pradhāna as distinctfrom Śive and undergoing independent development. Śrīkaṇthaexplains the expression Śiva alone existed&rsquo; occurring in ŚU. IV.18, under 1. 4. 27, by &lsquo;Śiva, with whom the Śakti (the power) inthe form of the animate and the inanimate world was united,alone existed so as to form one entity&rsquo;, so that he here understands Śiva as possessed of the Śakti to be the constituent cause.In this respect his doctrine is similar to that of Nimbārka. Butimmediately afterwards he speaks of the Cit and the Acit formingthe body of Siva and thus puts forth the same theory as that</p>
<p>of Rāmānuja. Practically he makes no distinction between thetwo. The theory of the Liṅgāyats is the same as the first formof the theory set forth by Śrīkaṇṭha Śivācārya. Śiva as qualifiedby the Śakti is the creator, that is, is the efficient and the constituent cause of the world. The Kaśmīr Śaivism attributes theproduction of the world to the will of God without anymaterial cause, or affirms that God makes the world appear inhimself.</p>
<p>Thus most of these schools avoid the Pantheism of Spinozaand the incompatibility between God&rsquo;s development into theworld and his transcendency by holding that the rudiments ofthe material and the spiritual world associated with God as hischaracteristics, or as his body, or as his power only undergodevelopment, he himself remaining pure. Viṣṇusvāmin andVallabha, admitting, as they do, the development of Puruṣottamainto the world and at the same time his transcendency, followBādarāyaṇa. The mysterious power which causes the differencesby rendering certain qualities imperceptible, may be comparedto the self-determining power of God involved in Spinoza&rsquo;sstatement. The Kaśmīr Śaivas do not bring in the idea of Godas a constituent cause undergoing development and seem toadmit the doctrine of creation out of nothing.</p>

<p><strong>GENERAL LAWS GUIDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF LANGUAGE:<br>
THE DIFFERENT STAGES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SANSKRIT.</strong></p>
<p>The occasion that brings us here together today is the first ofits kind in the history of this University. Hitherto the University of Bombay has been merely an Examining Board. But thisday witnesses the beginning of an attempt to discharge anotherand a more important function of such an institution. The mainidea of a University is that it is a body of men devoted tolearning, and engaged in acquiring knowledge and disseminatingit. A country that has no such bodies of men occupies but a lowposition in the intellectual scale of the world, and contributeslittle to the general advancement of mankind in knowledge. Buta devotion to learning implies sacrifice of worldly interests, andthe poverty of learned men has become proverbial. To enablepersons, therefore, to apply themselves to the pursuit of knowledgewith undivided attention, there exist in connection with suchinstitutions certain appointments tenable for life called professorships or fellowships, endowed by the enlightened liberality ofprivate individuals or of the government of the country.</p>
<p>India and the Bombay University are no exception to thegeneral rule. In other times learning flourished in the countryunder the fostering care of its innumerable princes and chiefs,as well as rich merchants. Though in the words of the poet, Śrīand Sarasvati are, in a sense, constantly hostile to each other, itis Śrīalone at all times and in all countries that can supportSarasvatī, and enable her to live and grow.Hence it is impossible that the Bombay University should rise to the dignity of aseat of learning without such a provision as is found necessary inmore advanced countries. India cannot take her place amongthe intellectual nations of the West, and compete with them inthe advancement of knowledge unless her Universities dischargetheir proper function, unless we have professorships in connectionwith them for the cultivation of science, philosophy, history andphilology.</p>
<p>But we may be told that an Indian does not care for knowledgefor its own sake, and it is only as a means of worldly advancement that he enters the University at all, and, as soon as he takeshis degree, he flings away his books, and no more troubles himselfwith the several branches of knowledge to which he was introduced while within the walls of his college. The reproach istrue, as well as untrue. It is true if it is meant that since thefirst school or college was opened by our Government we havehad very few or none among us who have devoted themselves tothe pursuit of knowledge. But if what it is intended to assert isthat a love of knowledge or learning and an unselfish devotion toit are foreign to the nature of a Hindu, it is altogether untrue.Those ponderous tomes which adorn the library of the Sanskritstudent and those innumerable <em>pustakas</em> in the Sarasvat! Bhāṇḍāras scattered throughout the country tell a different tale. But in this, as in other matters, the circumstances in which our virtueshave grown up and are exercised, are not the circumstances inwhich we are expected to display them, and fail to do so. Loveof learning is ingrained in the very nature of the Hindu, but thelegitimate object of this feeling is Sanskrit literature. A knowledge of English and of English literature and philosophy is, inthe first instance, sought for only for its practical benefits. AHindu would not send his son to an English School if he couldhelp it. A very powerful motive for the pursuit of learning, therespect of the society in which one lives, is also wanting in thecase of the so-called educated Indian. A Śāstri or Paṇḍit isesteemed and treated with respect and consideration by hiscountrymen; the English-knowing Indian may be feared if heholds some Government appointment, but if none, he enjoys noconsideration. The very word <em>vidvān</em> or &rsquo;learned&rsquo; is grudged himby the orthodox Hindu. In one branch of learning, however, vizSanskrit, an English-knowing Indian may meet with appreciationand esteem at the hands of the learned in Europe. That issubject in which he may successfully compete with his Europeanbrother, and in which he has peculiar advantages which the latterdoes not possess. Among his own countrymen he will findsympathy only if he has studied Sanskrit exactly in the old waybut even in this case his heterodoxy, which is the result of his</p>
<p>English education, would stand in the way. But there are indications that a more sympathising and appreciating body of menis growing about us, and the circle will go on widening as education advances. In this, as in other matters, there are hopes thatour countrymen will, in the course of time, chiefly through theagency of Government education, adapt themselves to theircircumstances; and the Hindu&rsquo;s inherent love of learning willgradually extend and engraft itself on the branches of knowledgeto which he has been newly introduced by the European.</p>
<p>But encouragement and support are essentially needed; and,taught by our ancient tradition, we naturally look up for these,in the first instance, to our Government. Hitherto it has confined its endeavours to the education of its subjects, a thing whichwas never before done by any Indian prince, and for whichit has the strongest claims on the gratitude of the Indians. Butwhat Indian princes have all along done, viz, the extension ofsupport and patronage to men of learning, and thus enablingthem to prosecute their studies, has not yet attracted the attentionof our Government, probably because they thought the time hadnot come for it. Next, it is the duty of those of our countrymen,who enjoy princely fortunes, to encourage the growth and advancement of learning among their countrymen. Now the best andmost effectual way, in which learning can thus be encourgedand patronized by all who have the means, is by founding University professorships to be held for life. A beginning, however,has been made, and for it we are indebted to the friends of thelate Rev. Dr. Wilson, and to the good old Doctor himself. For,when his friends raised up the sum and expressed to him theirintention to present it to him, he declined to receive it unconditionally, and, contenting himself with only a life interest in it,proposed that they should hand it over to the University, andfound a philological lectureship. It is in virtue of the advice hethus gave that we meet here today. I only regret that theSyndicate was not able to secure the services of an abler man,and that the duty of inaugurating the Wilsou Lectureship, and,I may say, the new phase on which the University is entering, hasdevolved on me.</p>
<p><strong>* ***</strong></p>
<p>The subject on which the lectures are to be delivered this</p>
<p>yearis the Sanskrit, and the Prakrit languages derived from it.Sanskrit is the language of the religion, law, philosophy, andpoetry of the Hindus; and all their ancient and most reveredbooks on these subjects are written in that language. Even atthe present day the language we use in our daily prayers andin the performance of our various religious rites is Sanskrit;learned men carry on their disputations in Sanskrit, and nowand then we meet with new poems written in that language.Prakrit is a general name given to certain dialects in whichwe find some old books written; and in ordinary Hindu usagethe term is extended to the vernaculars we speak. Marathi,Gujarati, and the various other idioms spoken in Northern India.are Prakrits. The wording of the subject as laid down in thecalendar implies that Sanskrit is the more primitive of these, andthat the Prakrits are derived from it. Our business, therefore, isto trace the history of Sanskrit, to observe how from the veryearliest form in which it is presented to us in the existing literature of the language, it gradually developed or was corruptedinto the modern vernaculars. The Sanskrit which we know of assuch is not now the spoken language of any part of India or ofthe world. It is simply preserved in books, and is used by thelearned. But if the Marathi, Gujarati, and the rest show unmistakable signs of having been derived from this language, itmust have been at one time spoken generally by our ancestors;and in being handed down from generation to generation it hasundergone various modifications and changes, until we have now.come to speak it as we do. But of this more hereafter.</p>
<p>India may justly claim to be the original home of scientificphilology. In one of the most ancient Sanskrit books,Samhits of the Black Yajurveda, there are distinct indications ofthe dawn of linguistic study¹. The Brāhmaṇas of the Vedas.</p>

<p>Speech was once inarticulate and undistinguished (into itsparts). Then the gods said to Indra, &lsquo;Distinguish our speech into parts.&lsquo;He said, &lsquo;I will ask a gift of you. let Soma be poured into one oup for meand Vāyu together.&rsquo; Hence Soma is poured into ons cup for Indra andVāyu together. Then Indra going into its midst distinguished it. Honcedistinct speech is now spokon. Tait. SaṁhitāVI. 4.7.</p>
<p>which rank next to the Saṁhitā, and even the TaittirīyaSaṁhitāitself, the composition of which differs in no particularfrom its rāhmaṇa, are full of etymological explanations of wordsthough often they are fanciful¹. One Ācārya followed another,and they all carefully observed the facts of their language, andlaid down the laws they could discover. They studied and compared the significations and forms of words, observed what wascommon to them, separated the constant element from thatwhich was variable, noticed the several changes that wordsundergo in different circumstances, and by such a process ofphilological analysis completed a system of grammar andetymology. In the Nirukto, Yāska, whose exact date we do notknow, but who must have flourished several centuries beforeChrist, lays down correct principles of the derivation of words.The last of the grammarian Ācāryas were Pāṇini, Kātyāyana,and Patañjali. The Prakrit dialects which sprang from Sanskritwere next made the subject of observation and analysis. Thelaws of phonetic change or decay in accordance with whichSanskrit words become Prakrit were discovered and laid down.The Sanskrit and non-Sanskrit elements in those languages weredistinguished from each other. This branch of philology alsowas worked up by a number of men, though the writings of oneor two only have come down to us.</p>
<p>In this condition Sanskrit philology passed into the hands ofEuropeans. The discovery of Sanskrit and the Indian grammatical system at the close of the 18th century led to a total revolution in the philological ideas of Europeans. Before this timethere was hardly a scientific treatment of linguistic facts, etymological analysis was scarcely known, and philological speculationhad not emancipated itself from the trammels of religion. TheJews were the chosen people of God, and hence their language,the Hebrew, was the most original of all languages, and allothers were derived from it. This was the belief of Europeanscholars, as that of the orthodox Paṇḍit at the present day is thatSanskrit is the primitive language, and all others are corruptions</p>

<p>of it; though, however, the Paṇḍit has an excuse in the fact thatthe languages he generally hears spoken about him have reallysprung from Sanskrit. But several circumstances had about thistime prepared Europe for independent thought in philology, andSanskrit supplied the principles upon which it should be conducted and determined the current in which it should run. Thelanguages of Europe, ancient and modern, were compared withSanskrit and with each other. This led to comparative philologyand the classification of languages, and a comparison of the wordsand forms in the different languages led scholars into the secretsof the growth of human speech, and the science of language wasadded to the list of existing branches of knowledge. The progressmade within about fifty years is marvellous, and affords a strikinginstance of the intellectual activity of the Europeans. In thecultivation of philology and the elaboration of this new science,the Germans, of all other nations, have been most prominent, andhave done by far the greater portion of the work. The morelimited field of Prakrit philology with which we are here concerned has not been left uncultivated. Pali, the earliest of thePrakrit dialects, is almost as much studied in Europe as Sanskrit.We have editions of Pali texts by Turnour, a Ceylon Civilian,and a Danish scholar, Faushöll; and of a Native Grammar byKaccāyana, by M. Senart, a Frenchman; an original treatise onthis subject by Clough, and a very useful Dictionary by the Iatelamented Professor Childers¹. The derivation of the languagefrom Sanskrit forms the subject of an essay by the great Frenchscholar, M. Burnouf, and the equally great German scholar,Professor Lassen. There are notices of the Prakrit dialects inone of Colebrooke&rsquo;s essays and in the preface to ProfessorWilson&rsquo;s Hindu Theatre. Lassen also wrote a book entitledInstitutiones Linguee Pracratice, based upon the grammaticalworks of native writers, and upon the Prakrit passages occurring in the Sanskrit dramatic plays. Professor Weber, whose industryand comprehensive grasp are admirable, has published an</p>

The modern vernaculars have not yetsucceeded in attracting the attention of the learned in Europe.Essays on some points of vernacular philology by ProfessorHoernle, of Jayanarayan&rsquo;s College, Benares, have appearedin the Journal of the Bengal Asiatic Society. But the mostimportant work on this subject that has yet appeared is Mr.Beames&rsquo;s Comparative Grammar of the Modern Aryan Languages. Two volumes have been published, and the thirdand last is expected<sup id="fnref1:121"><a href="#fn:121" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">121</a></sup></p>
<p>. Mr. Beames has brought his subjectdown to the pronoun; and the forthcoming volume will treatof the verb. Dr. Trump in his valuable Grammar of theSindhi language compares the grammatical forms existingin the several vernaculars, and recent grammarians of Gujarati and Marathi have made attempts in some cases to tracethe grammar of these languages from the Sanskrit throughthe Prakrit. A Gujarati Śāstrī, named Vrajalāl, has written auseful little tract on the history of his vernacular³</p>
<p>. But uponthe whole, it must be acknowledged that vernacular philology isstill in a state of infancy, and a great deal of what has beenwritten is unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>Before I proceed to the subject in hand, it is necessary thatshould trace some of the laws of the development and growth oflanguage, as I shall have occasion to refer to them frequently inthe course of these lectures. Suppose a person wishes to expressthe idea <em>in a</em> <em>village</em>, and the only means at his command arethe roots and independent words in a language such as theSanskrit. Now the word which expresses <em>a</em> <em>village</em> is <strong>ग्राम</strong> , andanother which signifies the interior is <strong>मध्य</strong>. By joining the twotogether in such an expression as <strong>ग्राममध्य</strong>he conveys the ides the<em>interior of</em>, or <em>in</em>, a <em>village</em>. Now this word <strong>मध्य</strong> is pronounced<strong>मज्झ</strong> or <strong>मद्ध</strong> by persons who have either not been taught to pronounce it properly or are not sufficiently careful to do so. Thisagain is reduced to <strong>माझ</strong> or <strong>माध</strong>and thence to <strong>माह</strong>or <strong>मह</strong>, and ultimately to <strong>मा</strong> or <strong>मे</strong>. In this manner <strong>ग्राममध्य</strong> becomes <strong>गाममा</strong> or <strong>गाममे</strong>,which, as you know, are the forms of Gujarati, Sindhi and Hindilocative. In this condition its origin is forgotten by the speakers,and becomes simply a termination signifying <em>in the interior.<em>Again, if a man wants to speak of <em>one who makes a pot</em> and hasnot got a word to express the idea, he naturally puts together thewords <strong>कुम्भ</strong> <em>pot</em> and <strong>कार</strong></em>maker,</em> and uses the compound <strong>कुम्भकार</strong>.After a time, by faulty pronunciation, the <strong>क्</strong> goes out and theword is reduced to <strong>कुम्भा</strong>र. In the same way, as before, the persons.who use the word <strong>कुम्भार</strong> have no consciousness that they areputting together two words, one of which means a <em>pot</em> and theother <em>maker</em>; but the syllable <strong>आर</strong> becomes with them a simpletermination which signifies the doer of the thing expressed bythe base. We thus see that these two very general terminationswere originally independent words, and that in the course oftime they lost that character. If you examine those forms whichconstitute the declensions and conjugations of any language youmay happen to know, you will find that these also have originatedin the same way. When, our remote ancestors wished to say<em>I now</em> do, they put together <strong>कृ</strong> <em>do</em>, नु <em>now</em>, and <strong>मि</strong> <em>I</em>, and said <strong>कृनुमि</strong>,afterwards changed for the sake of euphony to <strong>कृणोमि</strong>. In thesame way <strong>कृणोति</strong>means <em>do now he</em><strong>कृणुतस्</strong><em>do now</em> he (and) <em>thou</em>.<strong>स्</strong> being a corruption of <strong>सि</strong> a pronoun signifying <em>thou</em>, and <strong>कृणोषि</strong><em>do now thou</em>. Or they expressed present time by using a pronounequivalent to <em>here</em> or <em>this</em> and said <strong>बोधति</strong><em>know here he</em>, the <strong>अ</strong></p>
<p>being the same as that we find in the forms <strong>अनेन, अस्मै, अस्मात्</strong>, &amp;c.and signifying something that is near. In this manner we areable to trace the original signification of a good many of theseforms, but since after their invention they are more or lesscorrupted, it becomes a difficult matter to do so in all cases. Still,we know enough to be able to lay it down as certain that this isthe mode in which all our grammatical forms have originated.When a language is in that condition in which grammaticalrelation is expressed by such compounds consciously formed, andboth parts of the compound can be used independently, it is saidto be in the analytic stage. The change of a to <strong>मध्य</strong> to <strong>मा</strong>or <strong>मे ,</strong> orof<strong>कार</strong> to <strong>आर</strong>, or of <strong>तसि</strong> to <strong>तस्</strong>or <strong>तः</strong> is what is called phonetic decay.Though this is usually spoken of in censure as curruption, it isthe means by which a language leaves the analytic stage anddevelops. The words forming the compound grow together, bothbeing altered in the process, and the original sense of the latter isforgotten. It is this circumstance that ronders phonetic changepossible, for, if those who speak the language always used thetwo <em>words</em> in the compound with a conscious desire to expresstheir joint sense, such a corruption would not take place. Phoneticdecay reduces the letter portion to a mere termination, and thusa language arrives at what is called the synthetic stage. All thedead Aryan languages, and most of the living ones also, are inthe synthetic condition, while the Chinese is said to be in theanalytic stage.</p>
<p>Phonetic decay or corruption is a process that is constantlygoing on in a living language. At some stages of its history itis very rapid and at others slow. It sometimes wholly transformswords. Its causes are deeply ingrained in human nature itself.Language is not the end and aim of human life; it is simply aninstrument of communicating thought, and the matter of thoughtis always more important than the expression. The utteranceof a word implies an effort. We have to force the breath throughthe windpipe, check or compress it at different points in itspassage through the mouth, and then let it off. The glottis or theopening of the windpipe, and the tongue and the various parts ofthe mouth are our organs of speech, and an innumerable varietyof sounds may be produced by their means. In pronouncing</p>
<p>certain letters the glottis must be stretched or expanded,while in the case of others it is contracted, which is its morenatural condition. The breath which comes out when it isexpanded is called <em>śvāsa</em> or simple unintonated breath by theold Indian Philologists. But when the glottis is contracted, andthe breath is intonated by the vibration of the vocal chords, itbecomes what is called <em>nāda</em>, i. e., tone or intonated breath.Simple breath is the material cause of the hard consonants, andthe intonated breath of the soft, and of the vowels. When <em>nāda</em>is forced out and allowed to pass away without being obstructed,we pronounce vowels, and when both <em>śvāsa</em> and <em>nāda</em> are obstructed at different parts of the mouth, the sounds that areformed are consonantal. Hence a consonant cannot bepronounced by itself; it is only when the touching organsare separated, and the air allowed to pass through any oneof the vowel positions, that the sound is produced.</p>
<p>When the intonated breath is let off through the rounded lips,it forms <strong>उ</strong>, and with the lower lip a little further off, <strong>ओ</strong>; while ifthe lips completely touch each other, and the breath is thusobstructed in its passage, we have <strong>ब्</strong>which, with a greater forceof respiration, becomes <strong>भ्</strong>, and when it is partly sent into thenose, it assumes the form of <strong>म्.</strong> If the <em>śvāsa</em> is in the same condition as <em>nāda</em> when it forms <strong>ब्</strong> and <strong>भ्</strong>, we have <strong>प्</strong> and <strong>फ्</strong>. Whenthese two kinds of breath are shut up by the tip of the tongueforming a complete contact with the root of the upper teeth, wehave <strong>त्, थ्, द्, ध्</strong>and <strong>न्</strong>. When the contact is effected higher upand the forepart of the tongue is made into a curve, we have <strong>ट्, ठ, ड्, ढ्</strong>and <strong>ण्</strong>. If the middle of the tongue is brought near thepalate, <em>nāda</em> passing through the intervening space forms thevowel <strong>इ</strong>; and when the tongue is a little further off and themouth more open, we have <strong>ए</strong> ; while if there is complete contact,the two kinds of breath give us <strong>च्, छ, ज्, झ्</strong>,and <strong>ञ्</strong> as before.When the root of the tongue touches the lower skirt of the palate,we have similarly <strong>क्, ख्, ग्, घ्</strong>, and <strong>ङ्</strong>. . If the intonated breath isallowed to pass away when the mouth is in its natural positionwith the lips open, we have the vowel <strong>अ</strong>, and, with greater forceof breath, the aspirate <strong>ह</strong>. The vowel portion of <strong>ऋ</strong> and लृ differsfrom <strong>अ</strong> in the whole lower part of the mouth being brought closer</p>
<p>to the upper in pronouncing it, while in pronouncing at the twoparts of the mouth are more widely apart; so that the vowelsound involved in <strong>ऋ</strong> is the closest, <strong>आ</strong>, the most open. The diphthongs <strong>ऐ</strong> and <strong>औ</strong> are <strong>अ + इ</strong> and <strong>अ + उ</strong> pronounced hastily. Inpronouncing the semi-vowels the organs are brought very closeto each other, but do not form a complete contact; so that thebreath is compressed and not shut up. Still, like the mutes, theycannot be pronounced without separating the organs.Wepronounce <strong>त्</strong> when we bring the two lips and the ends of theupper teeth into close proximity, and it thus corresponds to thevowel <strong>उ</strong>; for <strong>य्</strong> theposition is the same as that for <strong>इ</strong>, the proximity only being greater; while <strong>ल्</strong> is formed a little above thedental position by emitting the breath by the sides of the tip ofthe tongue, and <strong>र्</strong> a little below the cerebral. The sibilants <strong>श, ष्</strong>and <strong>स्</strong> are continuous sounds made by letting off the <em>śvāsa</em> orsimple breath with the same force as in the case of the hard.aspirates and through the space between the middle of the tongue.and the palatal, cerebral, and dental or dento-palatal positionsbrought as near to each other as in pronouncing vowels.</p>
<p>You will thus see how minute and laborious these operationsare. The difficulty is increased when we have to pronounce twoor more consonants together. We have first to put the organs ofspeech into one position, and immediately afterwards into another,without leaving the first.Accurate pronunciation thereforerequires great effort, and since, according to an observation ofLocke, labour for labour&rsquo;s sake is against nature, the tendencyalways exists of making as little effort as is consistent with thenecessity of making oneself understood. Hence <strong>मुख</strong> is transformedto <strong>मुह</strong>i. e. only the quantity of breath necessary to pronounce <strong>ख</strong>is let off, and the effort of forming a complete and close contactis saved; <strong>कदलकम्</strong> becomes <strong>कअलअम्</strong>, and thence <strong>केलूं</strong> and <strong>केलें</strong>, wherealso you will see that the contact is avoided; <strong>अर्प</strong> becomes <strong>अप्प</strong>, inwhich case we find that the effort involved in the change fromone position of the vocal organs to another is economized, thoughthe pressure which the organs exert upon each other in thepronunciation of a conjunct continues the same, i. e. we have.a conjunct as before, but the two members are assimilated. Thisis further changed to <strong>आप</strong>in which the pressure is avoided, but</p>
<p>the shortening of the time which this would involve is obviatedby lengthening the preceding vowel. This tendency to phoneticdecay is so powerful that if not counteracted it would in theshort space of a few generations render a language entirelyunintelligible to its former speakers. Children, in their firstessays at speech, often mispronounce words, and if they were leftto themselves, the language of a country would undergo verygreat transformation in a short time. But at home and in schoolsthey are taught to speak the language of their parents correctly,and this result is averted. Education, therefore, is an agencywhich arrests the progress of decay. Another check is affordedby the necessity of making oneself intelligible. If a man is careless about his language, he will not be understood. He has therefore necessarily to endeavour to speak as other people do. Thefeeling of society is also arrayed against the corruption of alanguage. The speech which does not approach the receivedstandard is branded as vulgar. The tendency to corruption isgreatly diminished when a language comes to have a literature.Some races are very careful about their speech, and preserve it ina comparatively pure condition; there are others which corruptit greatly. But even in the case of the former, accidents in itshistory may transform the idiom considerably. If one race comesin contact with another, and gives it its language, it is sure to begreatly corrupted. The alien race cannot catch the pronunciationproperly, or its vocal organs may be naturally so constituted orits previous vocal habits may be of such a nature as to renderthe sounds of the language difficult or impossible to be imitated.If there were no schools and colleges for teaching English to us,we should corrupt the language of our rulers so greatly as torender ourselves perfectly unintelligible to them. The nativesentry&rsquo;s challenge <strong>हुकुम् डर</strong> for &ldquo;who comes there?&rdquo; would be apuzzle to the scientific philologist.</p>
<p>The grammatical terminations which are oftener used thanany particular words suffer the most by this process of decay,and after a time they are confused with each other or droppedaway. When a language is reduced to this condition, it has tofall back upon the expedient with which it started, and tack oncertain words or particles to its nouns and verbs to express the</p>
<p>relations which the old terminations denoted, and thus the analyticstate returns. But the old process goes on again, and thesewords in their turn assume the character of terminations. Sometimes along with a case-form there exists in the language anotherexpression convoying the same sense. When the former goesout of use the latter takes its place, or sometimes the latter drivesout the former. The modern vernaculars have had to resort tothis process of reconstruction in a great measure, and, as in theolder languages, it has already become difficult in several casesto trace the origin of the forms. For instance, in Sanskrit thetermination which expresses future time is , and when it isapplied to the root <strong>दा</strong> <em>to</em> <em>give</em>, we have <strong>दास्यति</strong><em>he will give</em>. This <strong>स्य</strong>is very likely a compound of the root <strong>अस्</strong><em>to be</em> and <strong>या</strong> <em>to go</em>, sothat the contrivance the early Āryans had recourse to, to expressfuturity, was to attach to a root two others expressive of <em>going tobe</em>; <strong>दास्यति</strong>therefore originally meant he <em>goes to be giving</em>, i e.he does not give, but <em>will</em> give since he goes to do it. Now this<strong>दास्यति</strong> in the derived dialects becomes first <strong>दास्सति</strong>, then <strong>दास्सदि</strong>,<strong>दास्सइ दासइदाहइ, दाह</strong> and <strong>दे</strong>in order Phonetic corruption hasthus reduced this form to <strong>दाइ</strong> or <strong>दे</strong>, and that for the present tense.<em>I</em> <em>give</em> has also assumed the same appearance. There is thus nodistinction between them; wherefore, to express future time, ourlanguages have had recourse to a variety of expedients which Ishall endeavour to explain in their proper place. The Hindi,however, has hit upon the same that was used by our earlyancestors, and distinguished futurity by adding to this shrunkenform the past participle of <strong>गम्</strong> to go, which is <strong>गआ</strong>, changed to <strong>गा</strong> by combining the vowels, and thus <strong>देगा</strong>, the form of the future,signifies literally, <em>gone</em> <em>that he (may) give</em>.</p>
<p>Another phenomenon constantly observable in the history ofthe growth of a language is the use of false analogies. Thusin Sanskrit the root <strong>श्रु</strong> <em>to hear</em> takes the augment <strong>नु</strong>in the Presentand three other tenses or moods, and the Sanskrit of <em>he hears</em> is<strong>शृणोति</strong>. Now in the course of time people forgot that this termination was used in these tenses alone, and extended it to theFuture, the past participle, and other derivatives, so that in thePali and the Prakrits the root itself became <strong>सुण = शृण</strong> instead of <strong>श्रु</strong>.This root has descended to most of the modern dialects in this</p>
<p>same form. In the same way <strong>क्री</strong> to buy became <strong>किण, ज्ञा</strong> <em>to know</em>,<strong>जाण, बुध्</strong> t<em>o know</em>, <strong>बुज्झ</strong> and so on. All these exist in the vernaculars so augmented. In the same way, though <strong>कृ</strong> is conjugatedin Sanskrit by adding <strong>उ</strong> to the base according to the rule of theeighth conjugation, and forms <strong>करोति, कुर्वन्ति</strong>&amp;c., in Prakrit it isconjugated according to the rule of the first or the tenth whichare generalised, and has <strong>करइ</strong> or <strong>करेइ</strong>. This arises from the samesort of mistake that children commit, when, for instance,from the analogy of <strong>धरलें</strong> from <strong>धर</strong>, <strong>पडलें</strong> from <strong>पड</strong>&amp;e, they use <strong>करलें</strong>from <strong>कर</strong>, though the correct Marathi form is <strong>केलें</strong> and you mayremember such expressions as &ldquo;<em>I knowed</em>&rdquo; and&rdquo;<em>you was</em>&ldquo;thatDickens puts into the mouth of his lower characters. The Paliand the Prakrits are full of such formations. This law may becalled the law of false analogies or of the generalisation ofgrammatical forms, or formal generalisation, and the effect of itis to do away with anomalies and introduce simplicity in alanguage. It springs from the same causes as phonetic decay,viz. the economisation of effort, and its operation is restricted also by the same causes as those which arrest the progress of phoneticcorruption.</p>
<p>Hitherto we have been considering the growth or the decay ofthe grammar of a language. But the names of objects constitute avery important part of human speech. These are not arbitrary orsimply conventional. The possibility of mere conventional namescan exist only under a supposition of men meeting and agreeingthat they should call such thing by such name. But this impliesa condition of high social and political development, which in anearly state of society does not exist, and, in the absence oflanguage, cannot exist. The process is very artificial, and wouldhardly be worthy of the intellectual nature of man; and though evenin a high state of civilisation a language grows, and new namesspring up, this is not the way in which they do so. The names ofobjects are always expressive of some attribute possessed by thoseobjects, <strong>पृथ्वी</strong><em>the earth is that</em> which is broad, <strong>भानु</strong> <em>the sun</em>, thatwhich shines, <strong>उदन्वत्</strong> <em>the sea</em> that which has water, <strong>पितृ</strong> <em>father</em>, onewho protects, <strong>दुहितृ</strong><em>daughter</em>, one who milks cows. But you willsee that these names are not logical definitions, for they have thedefect of <em>ativyāpti,</em> i. e. are too wide. It is not the earth alone</p>
<p>that is broad, nor the sun alone that shines, nor the sea alone thathas water. But still these things possess these attributes pre-eminently, and hence the terms become restricted to them. What isgeneral is thus rendered particular, and the sense of words is, so tosay, specialized. This process goes on continually in a livinglanguage, not only in the invention of new names, but often itworks in a manner to narrow the sense of existing words. Thus,<strong>वदना</strong> etymologically signifies &lsquo;a feeling,&rsquo; &lsquo;a sensation,&rsquo; thence it isrestricted in Sanskrit to a particular sensation, that of severepain; but the pre-eminent pain is that experienced in child birth,hence <strong>वेण</strong>, the Prakritised form of the word, signifies in Marathithat special pain. So, गर्भिणी in Sanskrit denotes <em>&lsquo;a female that ispregnant,&rsquo;</em> but <strong>गाभण</strong>, the Marathi form of the word, is restricted tolower animals; <strong>ताप</strong> in Sanskrit means &lsquo;heat&rsquo; generally, but inMarathi, and in Gujarati in the form of <strong>ताव</strong>, it signifies a particular kind of hest, viz. &lsquo;fever&rsquo; though the word has not lost itsgeneral sense; <strong>हृदय</strong> denotes originally the heart, in modern.Marathi in the form of <strong>हिय्या</strong> it signifies &lsquo;courage, which is aquality of the heart, though in old Marathi it preserves itsoriginal sense; <strong>पिण्ड</strong> in Sanskrit means &lsquo;a ball&rsquo; generally, but inPanjabi and Gujarati in the form of <strong>पण्ड</strong> it is restricted to thisball of flesh and bones, &rsquo;the body&rsquo;; <strong>चेटक</strong> in Sanskrit signifies &lsquo;anattendant&rsquo;, but in the form of <strong>चेला</strong> it denotes in the Hindi&rsquo;s &lsquo;a pupilor disciple&rsquo;, who, according to Indian custom, is his master&rsquo;sclose attendant, and in Bengali and the Goanese Marathi, in theforms of <strong>चेले</strong> and<strong>चलो</strong> &lsquo;a boy&rsquo; or <em>son</em>, who is constantly about hisparents. Opposed to this is a process which may be calledgeneralisation of the sense. Thus the root <strong>गवेष्</strong>originally signified&rsquo;looking or searching for a cow&rsquo;; it was then extended to anykind of &lsquo;searching&rsquo;, and lastly in the form of <strong>गवसणें</strong> signifiesin Marathi &rsquo;to find&rsquo; <strong>इन्द्र</strong>originally &rsquo;the lord of the gods,&rsquo; is inSanskrit used to signify&rsquo;the lord &lsquo;of any class of beings, suchexpressions as <strong>मानवेंद्र, गजेंद्र</strong>, &amp;c. being very common; and notableexample of this procesa is afforded by the word <strong>राजा</strong> which inSanskrit means &lsquo;a king&rsquo;, but, in the forms of <strong>राय</strong>or <strong>राव</strong>, is in themodern languages used as a title of distinction, and in Marathi,any respectable gentleman not following the priestly occupation,and not a man of learning may be called a rāv. Sometimes, when</p>
<p>by means of phonetic corruption a word is reduced to two formseach of the two sequires a distinct sense. Thus, Sanskrit <strong>वृद्ध</strong> isin the modern languages corrupted to <strong>बुढ्ढा</strong> H.,<strong>बुढो</strong> S., <strong>बुड</strong> B., andin this form it means&rsquo;an old man&rsquo;.It is also corrupted to<strong>बडा</strong> H., <strong>बडो</strong>S., <strong>बड</strong>B., <strong>बडो</strong> G., and <strong>व्हड</strong> Goan. M. in which form itsignifies &lsquo;great&rsquo;, &rsquo;large&rsquo;,or &lsquo;more advanced in age&rsquo;. In thislast sense,the termination <strong>ल</strong> or <strong>र</strong> is appended to it (M. <strong>वडिल</strong>, S.<strong>वडेरो</strong>). The Sanskrit word <strong>क्षण</strong> becomes <strong>छण</strong> in the sense of &lsquo;a festival,&ldquo;in Pali and the Prakrits, but <strong>खण</strong> in the sense of &lsquo;a moment&rsquo;. In Marathi <strong>छण</strong> is further transformed to <strong>सण</strong>and <strong>खण</strong>in the form of<strong>खिण</strong> also occurs in the old literature and in one of its dialects.The Sanskrit <strong>उज्ज्वल</strong> in the form of <strong>उजल</strong> M., <strong>उजल</strong> H., <strong>उजलु</strong> S. उ<strong>जलू</strong>G., <strong>उज्जल</strong> P. means bright, clear, pure, but in the form of उजाडM.,H., G., P., S., B., it means desolate or waste. This sense it.acquired by the first process explained above, since a desolateland is cleared, purified of its tenants or appurtenances. <strong>खुजा</strong>means in Marathi a dwarf and <strong>कुबडा</strong> humpbacked. This lastword exists in the other languages also, and both are derivedfrom the Sanskrit <strong>कुब्ज.</strong></p>
<p>The last phenomenon in the growth of a language which Ishall notice is the gradual disappearance of words. As menadvance in knowledge and civilisation, new ideas and modes ofthinking arise, and the old ones fall into disuse. And sincewords are the representatives of ideas, new words always comein, and the old go out. The changes that the Marathi language,for instance, has undergone in this respect since the time ofJñāneśvara, or the Hindi since the time of Chanda, render theolder books unintelligible to modern readers. There are alsovarious other causes. Sometimes, when another language risesinto importance on account of political circumstances, or when itis admired and esteemed by a nation, as Sanskrit is by Hindus,a great many words are borrowed from it, and necessarily theolder ones go out to make room for them, or disappear becausethey are regarded as vulgar. The opening of an intercoursewith a foreign nation brings about the same result. These causesaccount in a great measure for the fact that so many words inour languages have become obsoleta.JJñāneśvara&rsquo;s Prakrit <strong>पसाय</strong>had to make room for the Sanskrit <strong>प्रसाद, गहिरु</strong>for <strong>गंभीर</strong> and <strong>नाह</strong>for</p>
<p><strong>नाथ</strong>; and the word <strong>जमीन</strong>has well-nigh supplanted the old <strong>भुई</strong>, as <strong>हुकुम</strong>has done <strong>आज्ञा</strong>, which itself must once have driven out sucha word as <strong>आणा</strong> or <strong>आयस</strong>, the Prakrit forms of <strong>आज्ञा</strong> and <strong>आदेश</strong>.</p>
<p>The languages of the civilised nations of the world have beendivided into three families, the Āryan or Indo-European, theSemitic, and the Turanian. The first comprises the Indian branch,consisting of Sanskrit, Pali and the Prakrits, and the modernVernaculars of Northern India and of Ceylon; the Iranic branchconsisting of Zend, the sacred language of the Parsis, the Pehlevīand the other cognate dialects the Hellenic or the Greek branchcomprising the languages of Ancient Greece and its modernrepresentatives; the Italic branch, consisting of the Latin andthe cognate ancient languages of Italy and the dialects derivedfrom Latin, the Italian, the French and the old Provencal, theSpanish, the Portuguese, and the Wallachian; the Keltic or thelanguage of those Kelts or Gauls that so often figure in Romanhistory, and distinguished into two varieties, the Kymric, nowspoken in Wales and in the Province of Brittany in France, andthe Gaelic, spoken in the Isle of Man, the Highlands of Scotland,and Ireland; the Lithuanian and Slavonic, comprising thelanguages of Lithuania, Russia, Bulgaria, and of the Slavonie.races generally; and the Teutonic branch, consisting of the Scandinavian group, i. e. the languages of Sweden, Norway, Iceland,and Denmark, of the High German i. e. the old and the presentlanguage of Germany, and of the Low German, which comprisedthe old Anglo-Saxon and the other languages spoken on thecoasts of Germany, the modern representatives of which are theEnglish, and the dialects spoken in Holland, Friesland, and theNorth of Germany. The second family comprises the Hebrew,the Arabic, the Chaldee, the Syriac, the Carthaginian, and thecognate and derived languages; and the third, the Turkish andthe languages of the Mongolian tribes. To this last family thedialects spoken in Southern India are also to be referred. TheZend approaches Sanskrit the must, but the affinities of thislatter with Greek and Latin are also very striking, and such asto convince even a determined sceptic. Sanskrit has preserveda greater number of ancient forms than any of these languages,hence it is indispensable for purposes of comparative philology.</p>
<p>The literature of Sanskrit presents, as ordinarily considered,two varieties of the language; but a third may also, as I shallpresently endeavour to show, be clearly distinguished. Of thesethe most ancient is that found in the hymns of the RgvedaSaṁhitā. These were composed at different times and by differentṚṣis, and were transmitted from father to son in certain families.Thus the third of the ten collections, which make up the Saṁhitā,bears the names of Viśvāmitra, and the hymns contained in itwere composed by the great patriarch and his descendants. Theseventh is ascribed to Vāsiṣṭha and his family. The compositionof these hymns, therefore, extended over a long period, thelanguage is not the same throughout. and while some of thempresent a variety so close to the later Sanskrit that there is littledifficulty in understanding them, the style of others is so antiquated that they defy all efforts at interpretation, and their sensewas not understood even by the Ṛṣis who flourished in the verynext literary period, that of the Brāhmaṇas. Still for our purposes we may neglect these differences and consider the Vedicvariety of Sanskrit as one.</p>
<p>The chief characteristics of the Vedic language are these:— Itcontains a large number of words that have become obsolete orchanged their sense in the later or classical Sanskrit. There is&amp; greater variety of verbal derivatives, such as <strong>दर्शत</strong>inthe sense of <strong>दर्शनीय</strong>&lsquo;worthy to be seen, or handsome&rsquo;, <strong>जीवस, अवस</strong> &amp;c., abstractnouns from the roots <strong>जीव्, अव्</strong>, &amp;c.,<strong>जनुभ्</strong>&lsquo;something produced&rsquo;, <strong>पपि, बभ्रि, जघ्नि</strong> &amp;c.nouns of agency having a past sense (Pāṇini III. 2. 171), which govern an accusative, <strong>दृशीक</strong>signifying&rsquo;handsome&rsquo; or <strong>मृलीक</strong>, &lsquo;favour,&rsquo; &amp;c. The nominative plural termination of nouns ending <strong>अ</strong> in is <strong>असम्</strong> (Pāṇini VII. 1. 50), as in<strong>विश्वे देवा</strong>सः, as well as <strong>अस्</strong>, as in <strong>यज्ञेन यज्ञमयजन्त देवाः</strong>; and the instrumental plural is <strong>देवेभिः</strong>or <strong>देवैः</strong>: (Pāṇini VII. 1. 10). The vowel casesof nouns in <strong>उ</strong> are often formed by joining the vowels by theusual Saṁdhi rules; as <strong>तन्वम्</strong>or <strong>तनुवम्</strong>, accusative singular of <strong>तनुः</strong>;<strong>मध्वः</strong>and <strong>वस्वः</strong>,genitive singulars of <strong>मधु</strong>and <strong>वसु</strong>. The instrumentalsingular is made up by affixing <strong>आ, या</strong>or <strong>इया</strong>, instead of <strong>ना</strong>, as<strong>मध्वा, उरुया, उर्विया, धृष्णुया</strong>&amp;c. (Pāṇini VII. 1. 39); sometimes ofother nouns also, as <strong>स्वपया, नावया</strong>&amp;o. The nominative and vocative dual of masculine and the plural of neuter nouns in <strong>अ</strong> often</p>
<p>end in <strong>आ</strong>; as <strong>येनेमा विश्वा च्यवना कृतानि</strong> ṚV. II. 12.4, <strong>अश्विना पुरुदंसमानरा</strong> ṚV. I. 3. 2; and the instrumental singular of feminine nounsin <strong>इ</strong> is optionally formed by simplylengthening the vowel(Pāṇini VII. 1.39), as <strong>नविष्ठया मती</strong>ṚV. 1. 82. 2. The locativesingular termination is often dropped, as in <strong>परमे व्योमन</strong>; or its <strong>औ</strong>changed to <strong>आ</strong>, as in <strong>नाभा</strong>for <strong>नाभौ</strong> (Pāṇini VII1. 39). TheParasmaipada first person plural termination of verbs is <strong>मसि</strong>(Päṇini VII. 1. 46), as <strong>नमो भरन्त एमसि</strong>ṚV. I. 1. 7, and that of thethird person plural is often or <strong>रे</strong>, as <strong>रते</strong>, as <strong>दुन्हे</strong> or <strong>दुन्हते</strong>. Other formsalso admit of this <strong>र</strong>, as <strong>अदृश्रमस्य</strong>. The <strong>त</strong> of the Ātmanepada terminations is often dropped (Pāṇini VII. 1. 41 ), as <strong>वस्वईशे</strong>ṚV.I.71.9.There are eight different forms of the mood called <strong>लेट्</strong>by Pāṇini,which has a conditional or subjunctive sense; <strong>सुपथा करत्। प्र ण आयूंषि तारिषत्</strong>,ṚV. I. 25. 12, <strong>स देवानेह वक्षति</strong>ṚV.I. 1. 2. This is lostin classical Sanskrit. The several conjugations or ways offorming the special tenses do exist, but the roots are not restrictedto any particular way, being conjugated sometimes according toone mode and sometimes according to another; as <strong>श्रुधी हवम्</strong>. Thereare some instances in which some tenses other than the specialtenses also admit of the conjugational sign, as <strong>विशृण्विरे</strong>, perfect.Sometimes guṇa is substituted before the <strong>त</strong>of the second personplural imperative, though it is a weak termination, as in <strong>शृणोत</strong>.</p>
<p>The infinitive is formed by adding to roots the terminations <strong>से,ध्यैअध्यै, तवै</strong>and <strong>तवे</strong> ( Pāṇini III. 4.9), as <strong>वक्षे, जीवसे, पिबध्यै, दातवे, हन्तवे</strong>.These are etymologically the forms of the dative singularof such nouns as <strong>वक्ष्, जीवस्, पिबधि</strong>&amp;c. A few other datives aresimilarly used, as <strong>दृशे, रोहिष्यै</strong>&amp;c. (Pāṇini III, 4. 10, 11). Theaccusatives of some nouns are also used as infinitives whengoverned by <strong>शक्</strong>(Pāṇini III 4.12), as <strong>न ये शेकुर्यज्ञियां नावमारुहम्</strong>ṚV. X. 44. 6; also in other places, <strong>चिकितुषो विपृच्छम्</strong> ṚV. VII. 86. 3.The infinitive in classical Sanskrit ends in a, as, which isthe accusative form of such a noun as <strong>कर्तु</strong>, the dative of which,<strong>कर्तवे</strong>, is one of the forms of the Vedic infinitive. The potentialparticiples are often formed by adding <strong>तवै, ए, एण्य</strong> and <strong>त्व</strong>(PāṇiniIIL 4.14), as <strong>नैषा गव्यूतिरभर्तवा उ</strong> ṚV. X. 14.2, <strong>न तेन देव आदिशे</strong> ṚV.VI. 56, 1, <strong>दिदृक्षेण्यः, कर्त्वम्</strong>. The first two, however, ought properlyto be considered as infinitives. The absolutive is sometimesformed by the addition <strong>त्वाय</strong>; as <strong>गत्वाय</strong>. There is such a form as</p>
<p><strong>इष्टीनम्</strong> for <strong>दृष्ट्वा</strong>;and such others as <strong>हत्वी</strong> and <strong>पीत्वी</strong>for <strong>हत्वा</strong> and <strong>पीत्वा</strong>occur often. Those last, as also the usual or classical absolutives,are forms of the instrumental singular of the same nouns, thedative and accusative of which are used as infinitives; <strong>त्वाय</strong>appears also to be an instrumental. There are a great manyother peculiarities which are noticed by Pāṇini, and which youwill find collected in the Siddhānta-Kaumudī. One thing, however, should be borne in mind, that notwithstanding there isin these respects a very groat difference between the Vedic andthe classical Sanskrit, they are in the same phonetic stage, i. e.the vocal elements of words and letters remain the same. Thereare a few such instances, as <strong>सध</strong> for <strong>सह</strong>, and <strong>गृभ्</strong>for <strong>गृह्</strong>, in whichthe mute has disappeared, leaving only the aspirate element, andto these may be added the terminations <strong>मसि</strong>and <strong>असस्</strong> for <strong>मस्</strong> and<strong>अस्</strong>; but both the original and corrupt forms exist in the Vedas,and no general conclusion can be based on these few instances.You will hereafter see that the other dialects I shall speak ofdiffer greatly from the classical Sanskrit in these respects. Thefollowing specimen will give you an idea of Vedic Sanskrit :—</p>
<p>१. यच्चिद्धि ते विशो यथा प्र देव वरुण व्रतम् । मिनीमसि द्यविद्यवि ॥<br>
२. मानो वधाय हत्नवे जिरीलानस्यरीग्धः। मा हृणानस्य मन्यवे ॥<br>
५. कदा क्षत्रश्रियं नरमा वरुणं करामहे। मृलीकायोरुचक्षसम् ॥<br>
७. वेदा यो वीनांपदमन्तरिक्षेण पतताम् ।वेद नावः समुद्रियः ॥<br>
१०. नि षसाद धृतव्रतो वरुणः पस्त्यास्वा । साम्राज्याय सुक्रतुः ॥<br>
११. अतो विश्वान्यद्भुता चिकित्वाँअभि पश्यति। कृतानि या च कर्त्वा ॥<br>
१२. स नो विश्वाहा सुक्रतुरादित्यः सुपथा करत् । प्रण आयूंषि तारिषत् ॥<br>
१९. इमं मेवरुण श्रुधी हवमद्या च मृलय ।त्वामवस्युरा चके ॥</p>
<p>These eight verses contain 72 different padas or grammaticalforms, not counting the prepositions as separate <em>padas</em>. Of these19 have become altogether obsolete in classical Sanskrit, and 12have changed their significations. This, however, is a specimen ofone of the more intelligible hymns, but there are a great manywhich contain a much larger proportion of words that have goneout of use. It is these obsolete words that constitute the chiefdifficulty of understanding the Vedio hymns.</p>
<ol>
<li>The use of <strong>चित्</strong>after <strong>यत्</strong> is unknown to the later dialect,that particle being found joined only to the pronoun <strong>किम्</strong>. Thepreposition <strong>प्र</strong>, though connected with <strong>मिनीमसि</strong>, is separated from it</li>
</ol>
<p>by three words. Though the root of this verb is given in theDhātupāṭha or Pāṇini&rsquo;s list of roots, it has gone out of use. Inmodern Sanskrit we should use <strong>अतिक्रामः</strong>instead. <strong>व्रत</strong> is notnow used in the sense in which it occurs here, though it isconnected with it. We should use <strong>शासन</strong> instead.<strong>द्यविद्यवि</strong> means&rsquo;day by day&rsquo;;in classical Sankrit the word <strong>द्यो</strong> means&rsquo;heaven only. The verse may be translated:— &ldquo;Thoughwho are like subjects break thy law, day after day, O divineVaruṇa!&rdquo; Varuṇa is spoken of frequently as a <em>r</em>ā<em>jan</em>, or king,and men are his subjects, with reference to that attribute of his.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>व<strong>ध</strong>means &lsquo;killing&rsquo;, or &rsquo;execution&rsquo; in classical Sanskrit,but, since <strong>हन्तु</strong> &lsquo;killing&rsquo; qualifies it here, it must mean some suchthing as a weapon or a blow.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>हन्तु</strong> is obsolete. <strong>जिहीलान</strong> is a participle of the Perfect of <strong>हेङ्</strong> or<strong>हीङ्</strong>. The form is obsolete; and a verbal form of the root is notordinarily met with, though a word derived from it does ocour.<strong>हृणान</strong> also is obsolete.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not subject us to the killing blow of the spiteful, nor tothe wrath of the angry,&rdquo; <em>i. e.</em> do not kill us out of spite or wrath.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>क्षत्र</strong> signifies in later Sanskrit the order of the Kṣatriyas orthe warrior caste. Here it is used in the primitive sense of&rsquo;valour&rsquo;, &lsquo;prowess&rsquo;. <strong>नर</strong> does not mean &lsquo;man&rsquo; here, but is usedIn its original sense of <em>manly</em>, <strong>आ</strong> and <strong>करामहे</strong> are separated by aword <strong>मृलीक</strong> &lsquo;favour&rsquo; is obsolete. <strong>चक्षस्</strong>&rsquo;the reach of sight&rsquo;, &lsquo;visual power&rsquo;, has also gone out of use.</li>
</ol>
<p>&ldquo;When shall we call the brave, manly, and far-seeing Varuṇahither to favour us ?&rdquo;</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong>समुद्रियः</strong> This form of the derived adjective is unknown tolater Sanskrit. The genitive singular is formed by changing <strong>ई</strong> to <strong>इय्</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows the path of the birds flying in the sir and ofthe boat on the waters.&rdquo;</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Enforcing his laws, the powerful Varuṇa sits down inhis abode to exercise universal sovereignty.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>अद्भुता</strong>, the termination of the accusative plural, is here dropped; <strong>कर्त्व</strong>is Vedic for <strong>कर्तव्य</strong>; here also <strong>नि</strong>is dropped.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&ldquo;From this place the knowing one sees all secret deeds donor to be done.&rdquo;</p>
<ol start="12">
<li><strong>करत्</strong>and <strong>तारिषत्</strong>are forms of <strong>लेट्</strong>or the Vedicsubjunctive.</li>
</ol>
<p>&ldquo;May the powerful God make things easy for us all our daysand prolong our lives.&rdquo;</p>
<ol start="19">
<li><strong>श्रुधी</strong>. Conjugated as a root of the second class, with <strong>धि</strong>asthe termination of the imperative singular, lengthened for phoneticpurposes.</li>
</ol>
<p>&ldquo;O Varuṇa, hear this my invocation, and now be propitious.I call on thee, desirous of protection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next form of the language is presented to us in theBrāhmaṇas of the Vedas, such as the Aitareya of the Ṛgvedaand the Śatapatha of the White Yajurveda. A great many ofthose peculiar words which we meet with in the hymns, andwhich are so unintelligible have disappeared, the declensionshave approached the standard of classical Sanskrit, the nominative plural in <strong>असस्</strong>, for instance, and the instrumental plural in <strong>एभिः</strong>having gone out of use. The roots have arranged themselves definitely under certain conjugations. The subjunctivehas mostly become obsolete, though such forms as <strong>निष्पद्यातै</strong>(Śat. I.4.1. 10), and <strong>असत्</strong> (Ait. II. 11) are sometimes met with. Theroots take those forms of the Aorist that Pāṇini assigns to them,and this tense is scrupulously used in the sense mentioned bythat grammarian. Such terminations as <strong>मसि</strong>and the variousmodes of forming the infinitive have disappeared, the ordinaryone in <strong>तुम्</strong> being mostly used (Ait. IV. 8, VIII. 23). Thelanguage is in most respects the same as that usually calledclassical Sanskrit. It is rich in verbal forms of all tenses andmoods. There are however a few peculiarities and archaisms. There are some antiquated words such as <strong>बर्स</strong> &lsquo;an extremity&rsquo;(Ait. II. 2), <strong>अनीक</strong> &lsquo;a shaft,&rsquo; <strong>मन्थाबल</strong> &lsquo;a bat&rsquo; (Ait. III.26); <strong>निष्ठाव</strong>&lsquo;ultimate referee&rsquo; <strong>अववदितृ</strong> &lsquo;one who pronounces a decree,&rsquo; <strong>भगवस्</strong>prosperous&rsquo;, <strong>तत</strong> for <strong>तात</strong>(Ait. V. 14), <strong>इरा</strong> &lsquo;food&rsquo; (Ait. VIII. 7).<strong>शुष्मिण</strong> &lsquo;powerful&rsquo; (Ait. VIII. 8. 23), <strong>मेनि</strong>&lsquo;a destructive instrument,flame&rsquo; (Ait. VIII. 24 ), &amp;c. The dative of feminine nouns is oftenused for the genitive, as <strong>पृथिव्यै राजा स्याः</strong>(Ait. VIII. 23); <strong>सर्वस्यै वाचः… परिगृहीत्यै</strong>; the <strong>त</strong>of the third person singular of the</p>
<p>Ātmanepada is sometimes dropped as in the old dialect, as <strong>सविता वै प्रसवानामीशिे</strong>(Ait. VII. 16); a few roots form their Aorist inanother manner than that mentioned by Pāṇini, as <strong>अज्ञत वा अस्य दन्ताः</strong>( Ait. VII. 14), where <strong>अज्ञत</strong> stands for <strong>अजनिषत अग्रक्षो वै म आत इदं</strong> (Ait. VIII. 23 ) where <strong>अद्रुक्षः</strong>is for <strong>अद्रुहः</strong>; the form of the infinitive governed by the word <strong>ईश्वर</strong>is that which ends in <strong>तोस्र्</strong>as <strong>ईश्वरो ह तु पुरायुषः प्रैतोः</strong>(Ait. VIII. 7); and <strong>ग्रह्</strong>appears in the formof <strong>ग्रभ्</strong> (Ait. III. 26). In the seventh and eighth Pañcikās of the Āitareya Brāhmaṇa some Gāthās or songs are quoted, thelanguage of which is more antiquated than that of the body ofthe work. Notwithstanding these irregularities, these Brāhmaṇasare the best representatives extant of the verbal portion of thatlanguage of which Pāṇini writes the grammar, though he did notmean these when he spoke of the Bhāṣā. But nearly the whole.of that literature which Pāṇini drew from, if he did so at all, hasperished, or to speak more correctly, there is no portion of theextant Sanskrit literature that accurately represents Pāṇini&rsquo;sSanskrit as regards the verb and the Taddhitas or nominal derivatives. Probably the spoken language of his time formed thebasis of his grammar.</p>
<p>The next stage of Sanskrit is presented to us by the work ofYāska, whose language appears to be more ancient than that ofthe rest of the non-Vedic literature. We find a good manyarchaic words and expressions in the Nirukta, such as <strong>उपजन</strong>&lsquo;proximity&rsquo;, <strong>उपेक्षितस्य</strong> in the sense of &lsquo;finding&rsquo; or &lsquo;observing&rsquo;<strong>कर्मन्</strong> &lsquo;signification&rsquo;, <strong>यथो</strong>in the sense of &lsquo;as to&rsquo;,<strong>बिल्म</strong> &lsquo;variety&rsquo;,<strong>उपदेशाय ग्लायन्तः</strong> &lsquo;unable to teach&rsquo;. <strong>शिशिक्ष राज्येन</strong> &lsquo;invested withsovereignty&rsquo;, <strong>नैघण्टुक</strong> &lsquo;subordinate&rsquo;, <strong>अनिर्वाह</strong>&lsquo;celibacy&rsquo;, &amp;c. Thereare also some technical terms which we do not meet with inlater works such as <strong>निवृत्तित्थान</strong>&lsquo;weak terminations&rsquo;, <strong>उपजन</strong> or<strong>उपबन्ध</strong> &lsquo;augment&rsquo;,<strong>नामकरण</strong> &lsquo;a nominal termination&rsquo;, &amp;c. Afterthe time of Yāska, Sanskrit underwent a peculiar change, for theproper understanding of which it is necessary for a timo to consider the styles in which a man may speak or write. There iswhat may be considered as the fluent or flowing style of speech,in which the speaker looks at the actions of men in progress,actions in the course of being done or suffered. A man speakingor writing in this style will use a verb on every occasion. But a</p>
<p>verb may always be analysed into an attribute of the subject andthe connecting link or copula. When one&rsquo;s attention is directedmore to the attribute than to the progress or course of an action,one will use verbal nouns or adjectives. Thus instead of <strong>अश्वमारुक्षत्</strong>aman may say <strong>अश्वमारूढः</strong>,instead of <strong>सोऽवोचत्, उक्तं तेन</strong>, instead of<strong>अयंमांसं भक्षयति मांसभक्षकोयम्</strong>;instead of <strong>मालामग्रथ्नात्, मालां ग्रथितवान्</strong>&amp;c. In the same way a verb may be divided into a noun oradjective denoting the special action it involves, and a verbsignifying action generally, as <strong>पचति</strong>, may be analysed Into<strong>पाकं करोति</strong> or <strong>पक्वंकरोति</strong> and <strong>पच्यते</strong> into <strong>पक्वोभवति</strong>, The later Sanskrit andthe modern Vernaculars are full of such formations. The caseforms may also be similarly analysed into attributive expressions;as <strong>राज्ञः पुरुषः</strong> into <strong>राजसंबन्धी पुरुषः</strong> or <strong>रामेण कृतः कट</strong>: into <strong>रामकर्तृकः कटः</strong>The mode of thought which gives birth to such forms of expression leads also to a freer use of compound nouns by means of whicha whole sentence may be compressed into a small attribute. Inargumentation the ablative of an abstract noun saves a longperiphrasis. This may be considered a petrified form of speech,and as distinguished from the verbal style it may be called thenominal style. In the earliest literature of Sanskrit the fluentor verbal style prevailed. Since this rarely admits of attributiveor nominal expressions, the sentences are short, and the construction easy. Thus, in such books as the Aitareya and Śatapatha Brāhmaṇas, we find short sentences, and an abundance ofverbal forms. Even in the time of Yāska this style prevailed toa large extent, and notwithstanding that his book is on a scientific subject, his language often reminds one of that of the earlierworks, though he must have written serval centuries afterwards.In the time of Pāṇini also verbal forms were in general use, as I shall presently attempt to show. Some time after, however,the petrified or nominal style began to supplant the other. Somehow it commended itself to the genius of the Indian Āryas of thetimes, and the very richness and flexibility of Sanskrit, which allows of a root or noun being twisted in a variety of ways tosuit any sort of construction, greatly facilitated the change. TheItihāsas, the Purāṇas, and the metrical Smṛtis are written in thisstyle. But here it is not carried to such an extravagant extentas is done in later writings, in some of which verbal forms are</p>
<p>rare and in others long and bewildering compounds are frequently met with,andthe construction is complicated and involved.This is the general character of the Sanskrit in which the subsequent poetic and dramatic literature is written and if thelanguage of a certain author is graceful and easy, and not dulland involved, if he does not use long compounds, and writes in amore natural style, it is either because his taste is superior to thatof his contemporaries, or because he belongs to an earlier period.</p>
<p>But it was in the field of philosophy. dialectics and exegesis,scriptural or grammatical, that this nominal style was greatlycultivated and developed. The earliest work of the kind weknow of is Patañjali&rsquo;s Mahābhāṣya on Kātyāyana&rsquo;s Vārtikas ornotes on Pāṇini&rsquo;s Sūtras. Nearly the whole of the philosophicalliterature of the Sanskrit is written more or less in the style ofdisputation. An Indian author does not lead his readers into theprocesses his own mind has gone through in arriving at thedoctrines he lays down; in other words, he does not tell us how hehas come by the opinions he holds, but lays down these doctrinesand sets forth those opinions and conceives objections that maybe raised and answers them. Or before actually stating the truedoctrine or <em>siddhānta</em>, certain others, more or less opposed arestated, and reasons given in support of them (<em>pūrvapakṣa</em>) whichare, of course, refuted. The Mahābhāṣya is written in this manner,but it differs in a good many respects from later works of thekind. Unlike the latter, it gives the very words that an opponent,speaking in his own person, may be expected to use. It therefore really consists of a series of dialogues, often smart, betweenone who maintains the <em>pūrvapakṣa</em>, and another who laysdown the <em>siddh</em>ā<em>nta</em>. Hence, the language is plain andsimple, and the sentences are short, and such as anaturally use in ordinary conversation or oral disputation. Thenominal style, however, as I have ventured to call it, in contradistinction to that of the Brāhmaṇas and also of Yāska, isobservable; but it has of course not yet degenerated into thelong compounds and algebraic expressions of modern times, andis perfectly natural. In this respect it keeps pace with thelanguage of the Itihässs and Smṛtis. Vātsyāyana&rsquo;s Bhāṣya on Gotama&rsquo;s Nyāya Sūtra, and Śabarasvāmin&rsquo;s on that of Jaimini,</p>
<p>as well as the Bhāṣyas on some of the sacrificial Sūtras, arewritten in the same sort of simple and lively style, though however they present a further stage in the downward progress. Butgradually this manner of writing ceased to be used, and thephilosophical style went on progressing until it has come to bewhat it is now. Śaṁkarācārya&rsquo;s Bhāṣya presents it in a middlestage. The sentences are much longer than those of the earlierwriters, the construction is more involved, there is a freer useof attributive adjuncts, and the form is that of an essay or alecture, instead of an oral disputation. But the great Ācārya&rsquo;sstyle is perspicuous throughout, fluent and charming, and notsolidified or petrified, as that of later writers is. These latterhardly ever use a verb, and of the cases only a few are to be met with in their works. The nominative and ablative singularprevail, and long compounds are constantly employed. All ourideas are thrown into the form of nouns, mostly abstract, andeven the participles have become rare. This style is the styleof formulas rather than of discourse. It has reached its climaxin the works of recent <em>Naiyāyikas</em>, but it has been more or less usedby modern writers in all the Śāstras. The movement which beganwith a less frequent use of verbal forms and the employmentof attributive expressions has thus ended in making Sanskrita language of abstract nouns and compound words.</p>
<p>I have used the word style in describing this movement, toshow what important changes in the structure of a languagemay originate from what is in the beginning but a style ormode of speaking or writing. If everybody thought and spokeabout all matters as the Naiyāyika does in his own subject, ourlanguage would be just like his. It would almost have no verbs,no participles, and no cases except one or two. But it is not so.The movement could not be carried so far in other subjects.Hence the real classical Sanskrit is the Sanskrit of the Epics,the Purāṇas, the metrical law-books, the better or earlier specimens of Kāvyas or poems and dramatic plays, and of the earlyphilosophical or exegetical worksAnd if we examine thisliterature we shall find that the greater use of attributive ornominal forms of expression gradually drove out a large portionof the Sanskrit verb, and gave a new character to the language,</p>
<p>which may be thus described:— Very few verbal forms are usedbesides those of such tenses as the Present and Future; participles are frequently met with the verbal forms of some roots,especially of those belonging to the less comprehensive classeshave gone out of use, and in their place we often have a nounexpressive of the special action and a verb expressive of actiongenerally compound words are somewhat freely employed; anda good many of the Taddhita forms or nominal derivatives havedisappeared, and in their stead we have periphrastic expressions.If the treatises of Pāṇini and others had perished, and we had toconstruct a grammar of the Sanskrit from the classical literatureI have above indicated, our Verb and the Taddhita portionwould be very mengre. Professor Benfey attributes the conditionwhich the language thus assumed to the influence of the Prakritaor the spoken vernaculars. But the process appears to me perfectly natural, and no such influence need be supposed. Thechange may in some respects be likened to that which renderedthe Vedic subjunctive and other grammatical forms obsolete inthe later stage of the language. The Prakrits may have givensome words to the Sanskrit, but that they should in this mannerhave influenced its grammatical structure is very unlikely. Itis more natural to suppose that it was the Sanskrit, from whichthe Prakrits evidently sprang, which gave to these latter theirpeculiar character. I shall endeavour to determine the exactrelation between the Sanskrit and these dialects in the concluding lecture.</p>
<p>We have thus observed and determined the change that cameover Sanskrit after the period that elapsed between the Brāhmaṇasand Yāska from an examination of the literature itself. But thefact is borne witness to by Kätyäyana, who observed it in histime and made it the subject of a few <em>vārtikas.</em> Patañjali discussesthe points raised in the following manner.An objector or<em>Pūrvapakṣin</em> is introduced, who says:</p>
<p>PŪRV. <strong>अस्त्यप्रयुक्तः</strong>।There exist (some) words which are notused; for instance, <strong>ऊष, तेर, चक्र, पेच</strong>.(These are forms of thesecond person plural of the Perfect.)</p>
<p>The <em>Siddhāntin</em>, or the principal teacher, who advocates thedoctrine that is finally laid down asks:—</p>
<p>SID. What if they are not used?</p>
<p>PŪRV. You determine the grammatical correctness of wordsfrom their being used. Those then that are not now used are notgrammatically correct.</p>
<p>SID. What you say is, in the first place, inconsistent, viz.,that words exist which are not used. If they exist they cannotbe not used; if not used, they cannot exist. To say that theyexist and are not used is inconsiste You yourself use them(utter them) and say (in the very breath) there are words whichare not used. What other worthy like yourself would you haveto use them in order that they might be considered correct (lit.What other person like yourself is correct or is an authority in the use of words)?</p>
<p>PŪRV. — This is not inconsistent. I say they exist since thosewho know the Śāstra teach their formation by [laying down]rules, and I say they are not used, because they are not usedby people. Now with regard to [your remark], &ldquo;What otherworthy, &amp;o.&rdquo; [ when I say they are not used ] I do not mean thatthey are not used by me.</p>
<p>SID.— What then?</p>
<p>PŪRV.— Not used by people.</p>
<p>SID.— Verily, you also are one amongst the people.</p>
<p>PŪRV.— Yes, I am one, but am not <em>the</em> <em>people.</em></p>
<p>SID.— ( Vārt, <strong>अस्त्यप्रयुक्त इति चेन्नार्थेशब्दप्रयोगात्</strong> ) If youobjectthat they are not used, it will not do (the objection is not valid).</p>
<p>PŪRV.— Why not ?</p>
<p>SID.— Because words are used to designate things. The thingsdo exist which these words are used to designate.the words must be used by somebody. If the things exist, theThewords that denote them must exist).</p>
<p>PŪRV.— (Vārt. <strong>अप्रयोगः प्रयोगान्यत्वात्</strong>). (It does not follow.) Theirnon-use is what one can reasonably infer.</p>
<p>SID.— Why?</p>
<p>PŪRV.— Because they (people) use other words to designatethe things expressed by these words; for instance, <strong>क्व यूयमुषिता</strong>; in</p>
<p>the sense of <strong>ऊष;क्व यूयं तीर्णाः</strong>in the sense of <strong>तेर; क्वयूयंकृतवन्तः</strong> in thein the sense of <strong>चक्रः, क्व यूयं पक्ववन्तः</strong> in the sence of <strong>पेच</strong>.(We here see thatparticiples had come to be used for verbs of the Perfect Tense.)</p>
<p>SID.—(Vārt. <strong>अप्रयुक्ते दीर्घसत्रवत्</strong>) Even if these words are notused, they should be essentially taught by rules just as longsacrificial sessions are. It is in this way. Long sacrificialsessions are such as last for a hundred years and for a thousandyears. In modern times none whatever holds them, but thewriters on sacrifices teach them by rules, simply because I tolearn what has been handed down by tradition from Ṛṣis isreligiously meritorious. And moreover (Vārt. <strong>सर्वे देशान्तरे</strong>) allthese words are used in other places.</p>
<p>PŪRV.— They are not found used.</p>
<p>SID.— An endeavour should be made to find them. Wideindeed is the range over which words are used; the earth withits seven continents, the three worlds, the four Vedas with theiraṅgas or dependent treatises and the mystic portions, in theirvarious recensions, the one hundred branches of the Adhvaryu(Yajur-Veda), the Sāma-Veda with its thousand modes, theBāhvṛcya with its twenty-one varieties, and the Ātharvaṇa.Voda with nine, Vākovākya, the Epics, the Purāṇas and Medicine.This is the extent over which words are used. Without searchingthis extent of the use of words, to say that words are notused is simple rashness. In this wide extent of the use ofwords, certain words appear restricted to certain senses incertain places. Thus, rafa is used in the sense of motionamong the Kambojas; the Āryas use it in the derived formof <strong>शव;हम्मति</strong> is used among the Surāṣṭras, <strong>रंहति</strong> among theeastern and central people, but the Āryas use only <strong>गम्; दाति</strong>isused in the sense of &lsquo;cutting&rsquo; among the easterns, <strong>दात्र</strong> among thenortherners. And those words which you think are not used arealso seen used.</p>
<p>PŪRV.— Where?</p>
<p>SID.—In the Vadn. Thus, <strong>सप्तात्ये रेवती रेवदूंष ।यद्वोरेवती रेवत्यां तमूष । यन्मे नरः श्रुत्यं ब्रह्म चक्र । यत्रा नश्चक्राजरसंतनूनाम्</strong> ।</p>
<p>We here see that the objector says that certain words orforms are not used by people, and therefore they should not be</p>
<p>taught or learnt. The instances that he gives are forms of theperfect of some roots, and he observes that the sense of theseforms is expressed by using other words which are perfect participles of these roots. These statements are not denied by the Siddhāntin, but he does not allow that the forms should not betaught on the account. Though not used, they should be taughtand learnt for the sake of the religious merit consequent thereon,just as the ceremonial of long sacrificial sessions, which are neverheld, is. Then the objector is told that though not used by people, the words may be ourrent in some other country, continent, or world, or they must have been used somewhere in thevast literature of the language. As regards the particular instances, two of them are shown to be used in the Vedas.</p>
<p>It thus follows that in the time of Kātyāyana and Patañjali,such verbal forins had become obsolete, and participles were usedin their place. But it must have been far otherwise in the timeof Pāṇini. He gives minute rules for constructing the innumerable forms of the Sanskrit verb. Our grammarians proceededupon a strictly scientific basis. Nothing is more clear fromseveral observations scattered throughout the work of Patañjali,besides those contained in the above passage, than this, that theIndian Grammarians do not give us the inventions of their ownbrains as they are supposed by some scholars to do. The veryperfection of their observation and analysis has rendered themliable to this reproach. But notwithstanding all that, there canbe no doubt whatever that they scrupulously adhered to usage.If so, the verbal forms taught by Pāṇini must have been currentin the language at some time. We do meet with them in theBrāhmaṇas, but our grammarian does not include these formsamong the peculiarities he has given of the Vedic or Chandas andBrāhmaṇa dialect, and thus does not restrict them to those works.They must therefore be understood as having been in use in theBhāṣā or current language, the grammar of which he teaches inhis Sūtras. And the Bhāṣāthat he means must be that whichwas current in his time. In Pāṇini&rsquo;s time, therefore, the fluentor verbal style of speech was in use, as I have observed before.But it may be argued that though he refers these forms to theBhāṣā, the Bhāṣāhe means may not be that which prevailed</p>
<p>when he lived, but another current before his time and preservedin its literature, on which Pāṇini based his rules. It mattersvery little even if we make this supposition. The only effect isthat the period when the non-Vedic Sanskrit was rich in verbalforms is placed before Pāṇini; but the fact itself that there wassuch a period is undeniable. The supposition, however, is unreasonable. For it is not at all likely that he should neglect thelanguage prevalent in his time and teach that which was currentbefore him, and speak of it as the Bhāṣā, which word literallysignifies the &ldquo;spoken language&rdquo; or vernacular. And the occurrence in the Sūtras of words that became obsolete in laterSanskrit confirms this view. The following are such words:—<strong>अन्ववसर्ग</strong> &lsquo;allowing one his own way&rsquo;, <strong>निरवसित</strong> &rsquo;excommunicated,&rsquo;<strong>प्रत्यवसान</strong> &rsquo;eating,&rsquo; <strong>अभिविधि</strong> &lsquo;including,&rsquo; <strong>स्वकरण</strong> &lsquo;marrying&rsquo;, <strong>उत्सञ्जन</strong>&rsquo;throwing up&rsquo;, <strong>अभ्रेष</strong> &rsquo;equitableness.&rsquo; You will have seen thatthe Vārtika of Kātyāyana which starts the discussion I have translated, and Patañjali&rsquo;s comment on it speak of wordsgenerally as having ceased to be used, though the examples givenconsist of certain verbal forms only. It is, therefore, to be understood that the observation is applicable to other forms andexpressions also taught by Pāṇini which we do not meet with inthe later literature¹.Among such may be noticed <strong>उपाजेकृ</strong>and<strong>अन्याजेकृ</strong>&rsquo;to strengthen&rsquo;, <strong>निवचनेकृ</strong>&rsquo;to be silent&rsquo;, <strong>कणेहन्</strong> and <strong>मनोहन्</strong>&rsquo;to fulfil one&rsquo;s longing,&rsquo; &amp;c. <strong>कणेहन्</strong> occurs in Yāskaalso. Mostof the verbal derivatives ending in the technical termination<strong>णमुल्</strong> must also be so considered, such as <strong>ब्राह्मणवेदं भोजयति</strong>&lsquo;feedsevery Brähmaṇa that he finds, <strong>चेलक्नोपं वृष्ट</strong>,&lsquo;rained till the clotheswere wet,&rsquo; <strong>स्वपोषं पुष्णाति</strong> &lsquo;supports by his own means,&rsquo; <strong>उर्ध्वशोषं शुष्यति</strong>&lsquo;withers standing&rsquo;, &amp;c. A good many Taddhita forms taught inPāṇini&rsquo;s Sütras must also, I think, be put in the same category.</p>
<p>And there is another circumstance which shows that Pāṇini&rsquo;sSanskrit was more ancient than Kātyāyana&rsquo;s. Kātyāyana&rsquo;sVärlikas on Pāṇini, which I have already spoken to you of, touchon various points concerning grammar and the system of Pāṇini.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1. Professor Goldstucker has used the argument based on the occurrence ofobsolete words in the Sūtras and that set forth in the next paragraph, toprove the archaic character of the language as is existed in Pāṇini&rsquo;s timeand some of the instances quoted in the text are the same as his.</p>
<p>The purpose of a great many of them is the proper interpretationof the Sūtras, and there are some which supply links that arewanting in the system, also a good many which teach forms nottaught by Pāṇini, or give the correct forms, when by the strictapplication of Pāṇini&rsquo;s rules we arrive at such as are incorrect.Now, this strict application of Pāṇini&rsquo;s rules is often in themanner of a quibbling logician, and consequently it was probablynever meant by Pāṇini himself. Again, it may also be allowedthat some forms existing in the language may have escapedPāṇini&rsquo;s notice. But even after making allowance for all theseconsiderations, a good many forms taught by Kātyāyana areleft which it is impossible to believe Pāṇini did not observe orknow, if they existed in the language in his time. Though notinfallible, Pāṇini was not an indifferent grammarian. He justlydeserves the reputation he has all along enjoyed of being the preeminent teacher of grammar. He has noticed oven stray factsabout the language. If so, the only reasonable supposition isthat these forms did not exist in the language at the period whenhe lived.</p>
<p>For instance, according to Pāṇini&rsquo;s rules the vocative singularof neuter nouns ending in <strong>अन्</strong> such as <strong>ब्रह्मन्</strong> and <strong>नामन्</strong> is <strong>ब्रह्मन्</strong>andbut Ktyāyana in a Vārtikāon VIII. 2, 8 tells us it is<strong>ब्रह्मन्</strong> or <strong>ब्रह्म</strong> and <strong>नामन्</strong> or <strong>नाम</strong>.</p>
<p>Pāṇini teaches that the forms of the dative, ablative, genitiveand locative singular of the feminine of <strong>द्वितीय</strong> and <strong>तृतीय</strong> areoptionally like those of the corresponding pronouns, <em>i. e.</em> we haveeither <strong>द्वितीयायै</strong> or <strong>द्वितीयस्यै</strong>, <strong>द्वितीयायाः</strong>or <strong>द्वितीयस्याः</strong> &amp;c., but Kātyāyanain a Vārtika on 1. 1. 36 extends this option to the masculine also,and according to him we have <strong>द्वितीयाय</strong> OF <strong>द्वितीयस्मै</strong> or <strong>द्वितीयात्</strong>or<strong>द्वितीयस्मात्</strong>&amp;o., while Pāṇini gives us only the first.</p>
<p>Pāṇini&rsquo;s rule IV. 1, 49 allows of <strong>मातुलानी</strong> only as the feminineof <strong>मातुल</strong>, but Kātyāyans gives <strong>मातुली</strong> also ; <strong>उपाध्यापानी</strong> is not noticedby Pāṇini while Kātyāyans lays down that as well as <strong>उपाध्यायी</strong>inthe sense of &lsquo;wife of the <strong>उपाध्याय</strong>&rsquo;, So also <strong>आर्या</strong> und <strong>क्षत्रिया</strong> areaccording to Pāṇini, &lsquo;a female Ārya&rsquo; and a female Kṣatriya,&lsquo;but Kātyāyans gives <strong>आर्याणी</strong> and <strong>क्षत्रियाणी</strong> as well as <strong>आर्या</strong>and <strong>क्षत्रिया</strong>.</p>
<p>A good many more instances of a similar nature may begiven from other parts of Sanskrit Grammar. Are we then tosuppose that the forms <strong>ब्रह्म, नाम, कर्म</strong>&amp;c. of the vocativesingular, <strong>द्वितीयस्मै</strong> of the dative of <strong>द्वितीय</strong> &amp;o, <strong>मातुली, उपाध्यायानी,आर्याणी, क्षत्रियाणी</strong> and many more such, escaped the observation of such a grammarian as Pāṇini, or that he did notknow them? Is the supposition that they did not exist in thelanguage in his time not more reasonable? It therefore appearsclear to me that the language in Pāṇini&rsquo;s time was in a differentcondition from that in which it was in Kātyāyana&rsquo;s. The chiefdifferences, to point out which has been the object of this discussion, may be thus stated:— In Pāṇini&rsquo;s time a good manywords and expressions were current which afterwards becameobsolete; verbal forms were commonly used which ceased to beused in Kātyāyana&rsquo;s time, and some grammatical forms weredeveloped in the time of the latter, which did not exist inPāṇini&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Pāṇini&rsquo;s Sanskrit must, therefore, be identified with that whichpreceded the Epics, and he must be referred to the literary periodbetween the Brāhmaṇas and Yāska. Hence it is that the Brāhmaṇas, as observed before, are the best existing representativesof the language of which Pāṇini writes the grammar. Kātyāyana,on the other hand, wrote when the language arrived at that stagewhich we have called Classical.</p>
<p>Thus then, we have been able to trace three distinct periodsin the development of Sanskrit. First, we have the Vedio period,to which the Ṛgveda Saṁhitā, the Mantra portion of the Yajurveda, and the more antiquated part of the Atharva-Saṁhitāareto be referred. Then commences another period, at the thresholdof which we find the Brähmaṇas, which, so to say, look backwards to the preceding, that is, they present the Vedic languagein the last stage of its progress towards Pāṇini&rsquo;s Bhāṣā; andlater on, we have Yāska and Pāṇini. This may be called theperiod of Middle Sanskrit. And last of all, there is the Classicalperiod to which belong the Epics, the earliest specimens ofKāvyas and dramatic plays, the metrical Smṛtis, and the grammatical work of Kātyāyana.</p>
<p>Pāṇini&rsquo;s work contains the grammar of Middle Sanskrit, whileKātyāyana&rsquo;s that of Classical Sanskrit, though he gives hissanction to the archaic forms of the former on the principle, as hehimself has stated, on which the authors of the sacrificial Sūtrasteach the ritual of long sacrificial sessions, though they hadceased to be held in their time. Patañjali gives but few formswhich differ from Kātyāyana&rsquo;s, and in no way do they indicatea different stage in the growth of the language; hence his workis to be referred to the same period. The form which the languageassumed at this time became the standard for later writers tofollow, and Kātyāyana and Patañjali are now generally acknowledged authorities on all points concerning the correctness ofSanskrit speech. We shall hereafter see that the last two stageshave left distinct traces on the Prakrits or the derived languages.</p>
<p><strong>LECTURE</strong></p>
<p><strong>PALI AND THE DIALECTS OF THE PERIOD</strong></p>
<p>In the last lecture we traced the development of the Sanskritlanguage until it assumed the form in which it is usually calledClassical Sanskrit. This form it acquired several centuriesbefore Christ, as I shall hereafter endeavour to show, but it hassince preserved it unaltered. The reason is that the number ofpeople using it has been growing smaller and smaller, and nowfor a considerable period, it has remained confined to a fewlearned men who devote long time to its study and use it onlyfor religious and philosophical purposes. But in so far as It hasbeen used for these purposesit has not been free from change, aswas pointed out on the last occasion. The style and modes ofexpression used by Gadadhara Bhaṭṭācārya, the great Naiyãyikaof modern times, are not the same as those of Kaṇaḍa, Gotams,and Vātsyāyana, nor those used by Nāgojibhatts, the same asthose of Kātyāyana and Patañjali. But all these changes haverfollowed one direction. The efforts of our modern writers havebeen mostly, if not altogether, directed to systematizing andreducing to an accurate and definite shape the conceptions ofthose ancient sages, and no new ideas or methods of thought have arisen. They have thus elaborated a highly artificial style,abounding in abstract terms. In other branches of the literaturealso, we may discover some peculiarities and corruptions ofdiction and manner. But still, making due allowance for allthis, the generally received standard of good and correct Sanskritis the same as it was many centuries ago. There are certainmodels which modern writers and speakers have to conform to.</p>
<p>When, however, a language is living, that is, is used bypeople generally and in matters of every-day life, it must undergo very great changes. Men will not waste time and trouble inaccurately ascertaining and imitating the pronunciation of theirfathers, or reproducing exactly the several grammatical formsused by their predecessors. All that is necessary is that theyshould make themselves understood. Old modes of thinking give</p>
<p>place to new ones, and ideas spring up; and both must be represented in the language that is used. Sometimes accidentasin the history of a race, such as its coming in contact or beingincorporated with another race, serve to transform its languagewithin a short time. But the alterations that occur from theseand other causes obey certain laws; and hence the possibility of aScience of Language.</p>
<p>Now, by the operation of influences such as these. Sanskritwas, in very remote times, corrupted, and new dialects arosefrom it. We should have known nothing of these if they had notbeen preserved in their literatures. Of these dialects that which approaches Sanskrit the most is the Pali. This is the sacredlanguage of the Buddhists of Ceylon, Siam, and Burma, andpossesses an extensive literature.</p>
<p>I will introduce my remarks on this dialect by placing beforeyou speoimen :—</p>
<p><strong>सावत्थियं किर अदिण्णपुब्बको नाम ब्राह्मणी अहोसि। तेन कस्साचे किंचिददिग्णपुब्बंतेन तं अदिण्णपुब्बको त्वेव सं जानिंसु । तस्सेकपुत्तको अहोसि पियोमनापो । … तस्स सोलसवस्सकाले पण्डुरोगो उदपादि। माता पुत्तंओलोकेत्वाब्राह्मण पुत्तस्स ते रोगो उप्पन्नो तिकिच्छापेहि नन्ति आह। भोति सचे वेज्जं आनेस्सामिभत्तवेतनं दातब्बंभविस्सति । त्वं मम धनच्छेदनं न ओलोकेसीति । अथ किं करिस्ससिब्राह्मणा ति । यथा में धनच्छेदो न होति तथा करिस्सामीति । सो बेज्जानं सन्तिकं गन्त्वाअमुकरोगस्स नाम तुझे कि भेसज्जंकरोधाति पुच्छि । अथस्स ते यं वा रुक्खतञ्चादिंआचिक्खन्ति । सो तं आहरित्वा पुत्तस्स भेसज्जं करोति । तं करोन्तस्सेबस्स रोगोबलवा अहोसि ।</strong></p>
<p>This is from the Aṭṭhakathāor commentary by Buddhaghoṣaon the Dhammapada. It was written in the fifth century afterChrist, long after Pali had ceased to be &amp; vernaculsr. The following is from the Dhammspada itself, which we have reason tobeliove is much more ancient :—</p>

<p><strong>(A)</strong></p>
<p><strong>PHONOLOGY OF THE PALI DIALECT</strong></p>
<p>Here you will see a great many instances of the laws we laiddown in the last lecture. And first, as regards phonetic corruption, we have in these passages <strong>त्त</strong> for <strong>त्र</strong> as in <strong>पुत्त</strong>for <strong>पुत्र</strong>, for <strong>क्त</strong> asin <strong>भत्त</strong>for <strong>भक्त</strong>, and for <strong>प्त</strong> as in <strong>पत्त</strong> for <strong>प्राप्त</strong> and <strong>प्प</strong> for <strong>त्प</strong> as in <strong>उप्पन्न</strong>for <strong>उत्पन्न</strong>. This change is usually called assimilation of consonants.</p>
<p>In pronouncing a conjunct, one has to pass from one positionof the vocal organs to another without letting off the breathchecked or compressed in the first, an operation of great difficulty.The sound of the first member is indistinct, but when the secondis a weak consonant such as a nasal or a semi-vowel, it glidesinto the first almost as a vowel does, and thus the sound of thefirst acquires greater prominence. In the first position, the vocalorgans strike and press againt each other strongly, and themomentum necessary for this effort is acquired by uttering forcibly and with a jerk the vowel that precedes the conjunct, <em>i. e</em>. <strong>अ</strong>for instance in the word <strong>भक्त</strong>, just as aman previous to strikingand pressing anything with his fist moves the hand with forcethrough some distance. The previous forcible vowel breath andthe subsequent strong contact and pressure form the characteristicof a conjunct consonantal sound. This is the only way of rendering the two members at all distinct, for the first is thus utteredwith the preceding vowel and the second with the following,</p>
<p>Thus, <strong>भक्त</strong>pronounced in the manner I have described becomes <strong>मक्-त</strong>,but, if the previous vowel sound is weak, it becomes <strong>भ-क्त</strong>,in which case, in consequence of the absence of momentum, thepressure cannot be strong, and the conjunct character is not fullybrought out.</p>
<p>What we find in the Pali, therefore, is that the passage fromone vocal position to another is avoided, and the more distinctsound only, whether of the first member or the second, is pronounced with this forcible previous vowel breath and the succeeding strong contact and pressure; that is, we have a conjunctas before, but it is made up not of two different letters, but oftwo of the same kind. Hence the instances noted above and also <strong>धम्म</strong> for <strong>धर्म</strong>, <strong>जम्म</strong> for <strong>जन्म</strong>, <strong>यञ्त्र</strong>for <strong>यज्ञ</strong>, <strong>सदृ</strong>for <strong>शब्द</strong>, <strong>दुद्ध</strong> for <strong>दुग्ध,</strong> <strong>खग्ग</strong>for <strong>खड्ग, मुग्ग</strong> for <strong>मुद्र, अब्भुत</strong> for <strong>अद्भुत, लद्ध</strong>for <strong>लब्ध, उक्का</strong> for उ<strong>ल्का, अप्प</strong>for <strong>अल्प, तप्पन</strong> for <strong>तर्पण, अय्य</strong> for <strong>आर्य</strong> &amp;c. But an attempt is made topronounce the other sound also, and such of its elements as cango in, with that which is uttered without involving changeof position, are transferred to it, that is, in effect, the Pali speakertreated a conjunct consonant as one sound possessing the characteristics of both. Thus the heavy <em>śvāsa</em> or simple breath of <strong>स्, श्,<strong>and <strong>ष्</strong> in the conjuncts <strong>स्क्, ष्क्, श्च्, ष्ट्, स्त्, स्प्</strong> and <strong>ष्प्</strong> is combined withthe distinct sounds <strong>क्, च्, द्, त्</strong>, and <strong>प्</strong>, and we have <strong>ख्, छ्, द्, श्</strong>, and <strong>फ्</strong>for those conjuncts; but, when preceded by a vowel and pronounced with the usual conjunctal characteristic, they become</strong>क्ख,च्छ, ट्ठ, त्थ</strong>, and <strong>प्फ्</strong>; as in <strong>सावत्थियं</strong> for <strong>श्रावस्त्याम्</strong> and <strong>फुसेय्यु</strong>for<strong>स्पृशेयुः</strong>in the sbove, and in <strong>खन्ध</strong> for <strong>स्कन्ध,</strong> <strong>पोक्खर</strong> for <strong>पुष्कर, पच्छा</strong> for<strong>पश्वात्, अच्छरिय</strong> for <strong>आश्वर्य, दिट्ठ</strong>for <strong>दिष्ट, पुट्ठ</strong>for <strong>पुष्ट, मत्थक</strong> for <strong>मस्तक, वत्थु</strong>for <strong>वस्तु फन्द</strong>नfor <strong>स्पन्दन,</strong> and <strong>पुप्फ</strong> for <strong>पुष्प</strong>.</p>
<p>In <strong>न, श्न, ष्ण, स्म, श्म,</strong> and <strong>ष्म,</strong> the consonantal portion of thedistinct sounds, being made up of <em>nāda</em>or intonated breath, theheavy <em>śvāsa</em>or simple breath of the sibilant is first made heavy<em>nāda</em>, that is, the sibilant is changed to the aspirate and we have<strong>न्ह्, ण्ह्</strong>, or <strong>स्ह्</strong> for these conjuncts; as in <strong>पञ्ह</strong>for <strong>प्रश्न, उण्ह</strong>for <strong>उष्णअम्हि</strong> for <strong>अस्मि, अम्ह</strong> for <strong>अश्म</strong>, and <strong>गिम्ह</strong>for <strong>ग्रीष्म</strong>. These correspondto the <strong>त्व, छ</strong> &amp;c., in the above instances, and must, like them, beconsidered as simple sounds, and in our modern languages theyare pronounced as such in certain places, but when preceded by</p>
<p>a vowel they must have, as in other cases, the characteristic ofconjunctal sounds, and be pronounced as <strong>न्न्ह, ण्ण्ह</strong> or <strong>म्म्ह</strong> thoughthey are not so written.</p>
<p>I have already observed that when a following semi-vowel ornasal glides into the sound of the first consonant, this latteracquires prominence. But there are cases in which the semivowel <strong>य्</strong> does not so merge into the preceding; and this takesplace when it is preceded by a dental mute. The palatal <strong>य्</strong> andthe labial <strong>त्</strong> have since remote times been often pronounced intwo ways;— one in which the organs approach each other soclosely that it is difficult to distinguish them from <strong>ज्</strong> and <strong>ब्</strong>; andanother in which they are kept more distant. Hence the confusion between य् and <strong>ज्</strong> and व् and <strong>ब्</strong> that we find so often inmodern pronunciation and in the modern languages. TheBengali invariably makes <strong>ब्</strong> of the Sanskrit <strong>व्</strong>and in most cases<strong>ज्</strong> of <strong>य्</strong> and the people of Northern India follow him to a greatextent. In the Hindi we have many such forms as <strong>जमुना</strong>for <strong>यमुना,बांस</strong> for <strong>वंश, बांझ</strong> for <strong>बन्ध्या</strong>.</p>
<p>The heavy or close pronunciation of <strong>य्</strong>, is favoured by a preceding dental. In pronouncing letters of this class the tongue isnearly horizontal. Consequently, when after the formation of thedental mute it is moved upwards to form <strong>य्</strong>, the force with whichit separates from the teeth carries it nearer to the palate than itshould be. In the cerebral position, in which, the tongue formsa curve with the concave side inwards, the force with which itstip separates acts downwards; hence if a <strong>य्</strong> has to be pronouncedafterwards, the effort is in no way aided, but, if possible, hindered.In this case, therefore, the <strong>य्</strong> is always light; and for a similarreason, it is so when preceded by a guttural. It is also lightwhen preceded by the dental <strong>न्</strong>, since a large portion of theobstructed breath passes through the nose, and the tongue is notseparated from the teeth with any force. Thus in the word <strong>वैद्य</strong> inthe passage I have placed before you, and in <strong>अद्य, पद्य</strong> &amp;e. the <strong>य्</strong>being heavy, does not glide or merge into <strong>द्</strong>, and, being the latterof two successive consonantal sounds, acquires greater distinotness; and the preceding sound must, in virtue of the laws wehave been examining, communicate all its elements to it, except</p>
<p>of course the organic position. The element that is communicatedin this case is the complete contact, wherefore the heavy <strong>य्</strong> becomes a complete <strong>ज्</strong>, and this, when pronounced like a conjunctbecomes **ज्ज्,**In such words as <strong>मध्य, बध्य, उपाध्याय</strong> &amp;c., the preceding has got its heaviness of <em>nāda</em> or tone to communicatebesides the complete contact, and thus the <strong>ज्</strong> becomes <strong>झ्</strong> andthence <strong>ज्झ्</strong>; and so we have <strong>मज्झ, वज्झ, उपज्झाय</strong> &amp;c.In <strong>मृत्यु, प्रेत्य, सत्य</strong>&amp;c., to the <strong>ज्</strong> formed as above must be added the hardness or<em>śvāsa</em> of त्, i. e. the letter <strong>ज्</strong> must be pronounced not with theglottis contracted but stretched, wherefore we have च्and, withthe conjunctal characteristic, <strong>च्च्</strong>. Those words therefore become <strong>मच्चु, पेच्च</strong>,and <strong>सच्च</strong>. If <strong>य्</strong> precedes instead of <strong>त्</strong>, the heavy <em>śvāsa</em> requiredfor its pronunciation is transferred to <strong>ज्</strong>, and so it becomes <strong>छ्</strong>, andthence <strong>च्छ</strong>; as in <strong>रच्छा</strong> for <strong>रथ्पा, नेपच्छ</strong> for <strong>नेपथ्य</strong> &amp;c.</p>
<p>The semi-vowel <strong>व्</strong>is also heavily pronounced when it formsa conjunct with another semi-vowel, and thus we have <strong>पुब्ब</strong>for <strong>पूर्व</strong>, <strong>सब्ब</strong> for <strong>सर्व</strong>, &amp;c. There are also instances of this pronunciationwhen <strong>व्</strong> is preceded by a dental mute as in <strong>उब्बेग</strong>for <strong>उद्वेग,</strong> <strong>सब्भि</strong>for <strong>सद्भिः</strong>&amp;c. In <strong>ऊर्ध्व</strong> the preceding <strong>ध्</strong>, as in <strong>मध्य</strong>, transfers its heavy<em>nāda</em> or tone to त्र्, and makes it <strong>भ्</strong>, and so we have <strong>उब्भ</strong>; but <strong>ऊर्ध्व</strong>is changed <strong>उद्ध</strong> also.</p>
<p>The conjunct <strong>क्ष्</strong> or <strong>क्व्</strong> must in some cases have been pronounced in ancient times like <strong>क्श</strong>, as it is invariably so pronounced by the lower classes of the Marathi people at the presentday. This latter sound is easier to be made than <strong>क्व्</strong>, first becausethe passage from the guttural position of to <strong>क्</strong> the palatal whichIs nearest to it is more natural than that to the more distantcerebral position of <strong>ष</strong>, and also because, in the latter case, afterthe guttural contact, the tongue has to be rounded and thetip brought near the cerebral position. Thus, the whole weightof that organ has to be supported; while in the case of <strong>क्श्</strong>, whenits middle approaches the palatal position in pronouncing <strong>श्</strong>, theforepart falls into a natural position, and no effort is required tohold it there. Now in this <strong>क्श्</strong>, the sound of <strong>श्</strong>, being the latter ofthe two, is by the general rule more distinct than the other;and the complete contact of <strong>क्</strong> being transferred to it, it become<strong>छ्</strong>, because sibilants are produced by the heavy <em>śvāsa</em> as the hard</p>
<p>aspirates are, and thence <strong>च्छ्</strong>; as in <strong>तच्छक</strong>for <strong>तक्षक</strong>, <strong>छण</strong>for <strong>क्षण</strong>inthe sense of &lsquo;a festival&rsquo;, <strong>छुद्द</strong>for <strong>क्षुद्र</strong>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>In such words as <strong>वत्स</strong> and <strong>अप्सरस्</strong>, the prevailing sound is thatof <strong>स्</strong> which, with the complete contact of the preceding त् and प्,ought to become <strong>य्</strong>, as <strong>श्</strong>becomes <strong>छ्</strong> in the above case, on thetheory that <strong>म्</strong> is a dental. But it is not properly a dental, sinceit is formed not at the root of the upper teeth as <strong>त्, थ, द्</strong> &amp;c. are,but considerably above, and not by the tip of the tongue but by apart of it further inwards, which is made into a curve, havingits convex side upwards, and brought near to that position. Inthis last respect it resembles the palatals, though the part of thetongue employed in their case is still further inwards, i. e. themiddle. The sibilant <strong>स्</strong> therefore, has no mute corresponding toit in the sounds of the Sanskrit and Pali languages. The Marathidento-palatals <strong>च्, छ्, ज्, झ्</strong>answer to it completely, being formedin the same position as itself; so that <strong>स्</strong>, when the organic contact is complete, should become the Marathi <strong>छ्</strong>. But these soundsare unknown to the Pali; the speakers of that language couldnot pronounce the Marathi dento-palatals, as the Gujaratis andother northern nations cannot at the present day, and just asthese turn them into pure palatals, so did their ancestors. Hence,that sound which should properly be the dento-palatal <strong>छ्</strong> becomethe palatal <strong>छ्</strong>, and we have <strong>वच्छ</strong> for <strong>वत्स, अच्छरा</strong>for <strong>अप्सरस्</strong>and<strong>मच्छर</strong> for <strong>मत्सर</strong>.</p>
<p>The dentals following a <strong>र्</strong>in a Sanskrit word are in Palioften changed to cerebrals; as in <strong>बद्द्ढति</strong> for <strong>वर्धते, वट्टति</strong> for <strong>वर्तते, छड्डेति</strong>for <strong>छर्दयति, अट्ठ</strong> for <strong>अर्थ</strong> &amp;c.Here, as in the cases we haveexamined, the distinct sound is by the general rule the second,as we may observe even from the optional form for <strong>वर्तते</strong>, andarea for ard. But, as before remarked, in all these Pali transformations of Sanskrit conjuncts we see an attempt to pronounceboth the members. When the speaker, being about to put thevocal organs into the position necessary for the utterance of thefirst letter, which he has first heard though indistinctly, seesthat the second which he has distinctly heard cannot be producedthere, he gives it up, and then passes immediately to the nextposition. But if, at the first, he thinks he can produce somethinglike the second sound, which he has distinctly heard, he pro</p>
<p>nounces the letter there, and does not give up that position.Thus in pronouncing <strong>तर्प्</strong>, he feels that nothing like the sound <strong>प्</strong>can be produced at the position of <strong>र्</strong>, and hence gives it up andpassing on to the lips forms **तप्प्;**but in <strong>वर्त</strong> the <strong>द्</strong> that he pronouncesat the cerebral point sounds a great deal more like <strong>त्</strong> than <strong>प्</strong>, andtherefore he does not pass on to the dental position. But such ofthe Pali speakers as could distinguish between <strong>त्</strong> and <strong>द्</strong> did notstop at the cerebral position to pronounce their conjunct, butpassed on to the dental; hence the optional forms we have noticed.</p>
<p>Such words as <strong>मित्र, सत्र, भद्र</strong>, &amp;c., differ from <strong>वर्ध, वर्त</strong> &amp;c., inhaving the after the <strong>र्</strong> distinct sound, so that the speaker resortsfirst to the dental position, and uttering the distinct sound there,is not carried away by the following <strong>र्</strong> to the cerebral position,the sound of <strong>र्</strong> being weaker. But if in the same word a dentalfollows such a conjunct, that dental is changed to the corresponding cerebral; as in <strong>पटि</strong>for <strong>प्रति</strong>and <strong>पठम</strong> for <strong>प्रथम</strong>. The cerebralelement of these words has made a distinct impression on thespeaker&rsquo;s ear, and he is conscious that his transformation of <strong>प्र</strong>into <strong>प</strong>, which was necessitated by his inherent inability to pronounce the two consonants together, has not brought it out. Hetherefore realizes it by changing the following <strong>ति</strong>and <strong>थ</strong> to <strong>टि</strong> and <strong>ठ</strong>.But if a consonant of another species follows, or if the conjunct ends the word, he cannot give effect to this impression.</p>
<p>The conjuncts in which the second sound is weak and consequently gives way to the first are <strong>क्य्, ख्य्, ग्यू, प्य्, भ्य्, श्य्, स्य्, क्र्, ग्र्, त्र, द्र, ध्र, प्र, भ्र, श्र, स्र, क्ल्, क्व, ज्व, त्व्, द्व्, ध्व्, श्व,</strong>&amp;c., which have a semi-vowel for their latter member, and <strong>ग्न्, त्म, द्न, प्त्</strong>,&amp;c., which have a nasal.Thus we have <strong>सक्क</strong> for <strong>शक्य</strong> or <strong>शाक्य</strong>, <strong>अक्खान</strong> for <strong>आख्यान</strong>, <strong>योग्ग</strong> for<strong>योग्य, कुप्प</strong> for <strong>कुप्य, अब्भन्तर</strong> for <strong>अभ्यन्तर, पस्सति</strong> for <strong>पश्यति, तस्स</strong>for <strong>तस्य,सक्क</strong> for <strong>शक्र, अग्ग</strong> for <strong>अग्र</strong>, <strong>मित्त</strong> for <strong>मित्र, अदृक</strong>for <strong>आर्द्रक, गिद्ध</strong> for <strong>गृध्र,विप्प</strong> for <strong>त्रिप्र अब्भ</strong>for <strong>अभ्र, अस्सम</strong> for <strong>आश्रम, अस्सव</strong> for <strong>आस्रव, सुक्क</strong>for<strong>शुक्ल, पक्क</strong> for <strong>पक्व, पज्जलति</strong> for <strong>प्रज्वलति, नीलत्त</strong>for <strong>नीलत्व, विद्देस</strong>for <strong>विद्वेष,अद्धा</strong> for <strong>अध्वा, अस्स</strong> for <strong>अश्व</strong>, &amp;c., and <strong>अग्गि</strong>for <strong>अग्नि, अ</strong>त्ता for <strong>आत्मा,छद्द</strong> for <strong>छद्म, सोप्प</strong> for <strong>स्वप्न</strong>, &amp;c. The semi-vowel <strong>य्</strong> after <strong>न्</strong> in goingout turns the into the palatal <strong>ञ्</strong>, this latter representing thecombined effect of both; as in <strong>अञ्ञ</strong>for <strong>अन्य, राजञ्ञ</strong>for <strong>राजन्य</strong>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>We have noticed above the change of <strong>क्ष्</strong>to <strong>च्छ्</strong>. but more frequently it is transformed into <strong>क्ख</strong>. This change is due to thelatter <strong>ष्</strong> being pronounced not incorrectly like <strong>श्</strong>, but correctly asa cerebral sound, which being hollow and distinguishable, islost in the sound of <strong>क्</strong>. This last is distinctly heard, and the effect of <strong>ष्</strong> is only to add heavy <em>śvāsa</em> to it and render it <strong>स्व</strong>; and thus thewhole becomes <strong>क्ख्</strong>as in <strong>रुक्ख</strong> for <strong>वृक्ष लक्खण</strong> for <strong>लक्षण</strong>, <strong>पक्ख</strong>for <strong>पक्ष</strong>,&amp;c. Upon the principles we have laid down, it does not matterwhether the Sanskrit conjunct is composed of two or three consonants, since what is done in the Pali is to reproduce only thedistinct consonantal sound with the other attendant characteristics; and thus we have <strong>ण्ह</strong> for <strong>क्ष्ण</strong> or <strong>र्ष्ण</strong> as in <strong>सण्ह</strong> for <strong>श्लक्ष्ण</strong> and<strong>पण्हि</strong> for <strong>पार्ष्णि</strong>, and <strong>म्ह</strong> for <strong>क्ष्म</strong>as in <strong>पम्ह</strong>for <strong>पक्ष्म</strong>, in which words thelast is the distinct sound, and for as in it for <strong>क्ष्म</strong> as in <strong>लक्खी</strong> for <strong>लक्ष्मी</strong>, where the must have been pronounced so as to merge into theprecoding <strong>क्ष्</strong>.</p>
<p>A Sanskrit conjunct at the beginning of a word is reduced toa single letter; and the reason is obvious. For, as I have alreadyobserved, the distinctive oharacteristic of a conjunct consists inthe previous vowel being pronounced with rapidity and force, andin the subsequent strong pressure of the vocal organs, which isrendered possible by the momentum acquired by that forcibleutterance. It is the reproduction of this characteristic thatmakes a single consonant that is pronounced at any one of thevocal positions look like a double. When a previous vowel doesnot exist, that is, when a conjunct begins &amp; word, this characteristic cannot be reproduced; hence there is no double consonant.Thus, we have <strong>खलित</strong> for <strong>स्खलित, कमेण</strong> for <strong>क्रमेण, भ्रमर</strong> for <strong>भ्रमर, फस्स</strong> for<strong>स्पर्श</strong>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>You will have seen that in all the changes of conjunct consonants which we have examined, no element of the two sounds isomitted by the Pali speakers. They had not the patience to hearand reproduce the two consonants immediately after each other,by putting their vocal organs into two different positions, or theylaboure Iunder a physical inaptitude for doing so, their tonguenot being sufficiently trained for the successive movements. Butshort of this, all the constituents of the sound, the <em>śvāsa</em>, light and</p>
<p>heavy, the completeness of contact, and the force of utterance,are represented in their pronunciation, and the amount of muscularexertion involved is the same as in the case of the original.This may be called the energetic mode of pronouncing conjuncts.</p>
<p>There are, however, a few instances in which the componentsare separated by inserting a vowel between them. Thus Sanskrit<strong>सूक्ष्म</strong> is changed to <strong>सुखुम</strong>, <strong>औष्मिक</strong> to <strong>ओसुमिक, श्लेष्म</strong> to <strong>सिलेसुम, स्मरति</strong> to<strong>सुमरति, श्री</strong> and <strong>ह्री</strong>to <strong>सिरी</strong> and <strong>हिरी, बैल्ब</strong> to <strong>बेलुव</strong> and to <strong>औपश्लेषिक</strong> to <strong>ओपसिलेसिक</strong>.The separating vowel is generally such as can be easilypronounced along with the previous or the following consonant,that is, belongs to the same organic position as oither. Thus inthe first four instances we have the labial <strong>उ</strong> in the syllables <strong>खु</strong>and <strong>सु</strong> owing to the influence of the following <strong>म्</strong>.</p>
<p>The conjuncts <strong>र्य्</strong> and <strong>र्ह्</strong> are almost invariably dissolved into<strong>रिय्</strong> and <strong>रह्</strong> as in <strong>कारिय, अरिय, सुरियर विरिय</strong> &amp;c.and <strong>अरह गरहा, वरिह</strong>&amp;c. for <strong>कार्य, अर्य</strong> or<strong>आर्य, सूर्य, वीर्य</strong> &amp;cand <strong>अर्ह,, गर्हा, वर्ह</strong>&amp;c.; and in oneor two instances, we have the first change when the <strong>य्</strong> is precededby a consonant other than <strong>र्</strong> as in <strong>चौतिय</strong>for <strong>चैत्य</strong>. This change isto some extent due to the <strong>य्</strong> being pronounced weak, <em>i. e.</em> almostlike <strong>इ</strong>.</p>
<p>In the same way, we have <strong>सिलोक, सिलेस, सिलाघा, किलेस, किलन्त,गिलान, मिलान, पिलुवति, सुपिन सिनिद्ध, नहान</strong> or <strong>सिनान</strong> &amp;c. for <strong>श्लोक, श्लेष,श्लाघा, केश, कान्त, ग्लान, म्लान, प्लवति स्वप्न,स्निग्ध, स्नान</strong> &amp;c. This mode ofutterance wants the force of the one we have examined, but boththe sounds of a conjunct are clearly reproduced in it.You willhave observed that the second member of the conjunct dissolvedin this way is what may be called an imperfect consonant, *i. e.*a semi-vowel, aspirate, or nasal, in pronouncing which the breathis not completely stopped. They therefore act like a vowel, andrender the sound of the first consonant comparatively distinct andaudible, but are not so weak themselves as to melt away into thatsound. Hence both the sounds are audible; but the Pali speakernot being able to put his vocal organs into two consonantal positions successively, as we have seen, reproduced the two sounds byinterposing a vowel between them. But when in some cases thesecond member was weakly pronounced, it melted away into thefirst, and so we have the optional forms <strong>विस्सरति</strong> for <strong>विस्मरति, सेह्म</strong>for <strong>श्लेष्म,सोप्प</strong> for <strong>स्वप्न</strong> &amp;c. When, however, ita pronunciation</p>
<p>became stronger than that of the first, it prevailed, and so wehave <strong>कय्य</strong>for <strong>कार्य</strong> and <strong>अय्य</strong> for <strong>आर्य</strong>.</p>
<p>Some conjuncts appear also unchanged in this dialect; as <strong>ब्र</strong> inthe words <strong>ब्रह्म, ब्रवीति</strong> and <strong>ब्रूहेति, व्य</strong> in <strong>व्याधि, व्यग्ध, व्यग्ग</strong> &amp;c., <strong>प्ल</strong> in <strong>प्लवङ्ग, प्लवति</strong>,and <strong>प्लव, स्न</strong> in <strong>स्नेह</strong>&amp;c., Such as have a nasal for their firstmember and a mute for the second are also unchanged, since thenasal, even according to the rules of Sanskrit, belongs to the same organic position as the mute.</p>
<p>We will now proceed to notice the changes of single consonants. An unaspirate is changed to an aspirate when it isfollowed in the same word by a sibilant as in <strong>फरसु</strong> for <strong>परशु, फरुस</strong>for <strong>परुष, फुस्स</strong>for <strong>पुष्प, सुखुमार</strong> for <strong>सुकुमार थुस</strong>for <strong>तुष</strong>&amp;c. The heavy<em>śvāsa</em> that forms a constituent of the sibilant sound has made sucha strong impression on the ear of the hearer, that he immediatelyprepares himself to let it out, and thus uses it even in pronouncingthe letters which precede the sibilant and do not require it. Thepronunciation of a word is rendered easier by transferring one ofthe elements of a sound to another or others, that is, by assimilating them to each other as much as possible. In a few instancesthe simple breath or sausa of a previous surd is transferred to thefollowing, originally a sonant, as in <strong>थकेति</strong>for <strong>स्थगयति</strong>. The cerebral unaspirated sonant <strong>ङ्</strong> between two vowels is softened intothe corresponding semi-vowel <strong>ल्</strong>, as in <strong>तालन</strong>for <strong>ताडन, पीलन</strong>for<strong>पीडन, तलाक</strong> for त<strong>डाक</strong> &amp;c. This peculiarity distinguished the oldVedic Sanskrit also; and the sound exists in the modern Marathiand Gujarati, though it is unknown to the other vernaculars.</p>
<p>I have already given instances in which the cerebral <strong>र्</strong> of aprevious syllable in going out changes the dental of the followingto the cerebral, and to these I msy now add <strong>निगण्ठ</strong> for <strong>निर्ग्रन्थ, वण्ट</strong>for <strong>वृन्त</strong>, <strong>कट</strong> for <strong>कृत</strong> &amp;c. In some instances, this change takesplace without such an influencing cause, as in <strong>डसति</strong> and <strong>डंस</strong>for <strong>दशति</strong>and <strong>दंश</strong>, and <strong>डाह</strong>for <strong>दाह</strong>. The same phenomenon is observable in some conjuncts, as in <strong>विदटड्ढ</strong>for <strong>विदग्ध, हेट्ठा</strong>for <strong>अधर्स्तात्</strong> and <strong>ठा</strong> or<strong>ट्ठा</strong> for <strong>स्था</strong>in the several derivatives from that root as <strong>ठाति, ठायी, उट्ठान</strong> &amp;c.The dental nasal <strong>न्</strong> is also similarly changed to <strong>ण्</strong> in afew cases, as in <strong>याण, ओणत, ओणीत, सणिकं</strong> for <strong>ज्ञान, अवनत, अवनीत, शनकैः</strong>&amp;c. The operation of this process is very limited, but still it</p>
<p>exists, and cannot be accounted for in any other way than bysupposing that the vocal organs or the vocal habits of the Palispeakers were more adapted for the production of cerebral sounds,or, in other words, the people had a natural aptitude for them.</p>
<p>Sanskrit <strong>श्</strong> and <strong>ष्</strong> are changed to <strong>म्</strong>, which is the only sibilantin the language. This change involves an economy of effort.The tongue in its several movements becomes a lever with thefulcrum at the inner end where it is fixed in the mouth, and theweight in its centre of gravity. The advantage increases withthe distance from the fulcrum of the point which is moved, thatis, the point where power is applied. Hence gutturals are themost disadvantageous, palatals next, and dentals, the least. Thecerebrals being pronounced by rounding the tongue and raisingit very high, it is a question whether this additional effort doesnot neutralise the advantage they possess over the palatals bytheir position being more distant. Thus <strong>स्र</strong> is the weakest of thesibilants. But in the Pali the change is so universal, that wemust suppose a special inaptitude in the speakers of that languagefor pronouncing <strong>श्</strong> and ष्, as we had to suppose in the case of theconjuncts.</p>
<p>When, however, in a few cases, the peculiarity of the palatal<strong>श्</strong> was distinctly preceived, and it was felt that the substituted <strong>स्</strong>did not bring it out, that sibilant was changed to the corresponding mute of its position, <em>i. e.</em> to <strong>छ्</strong>, which resembles <strong>श्</strong> in theheaviness of the simple breath required for pronouncing it. Wehave thus <strong>छव</strong> for <strong>शव</strong>, <strong>छक</strong> for <strong>शकृत्</strong> and <strong>छाप</strong> for <strong>शाब</strong>. The change of<strong>षट्</strong> &lsquo;six to <strong>छ</strong> is also to be similarly accounted for.</p>
<p>I have already remarked that sometimes <strong>ष्</strong> must at an earlyperiod have been pronounced very much like <strong>श्</strong>. Besides thesechanges there are solitary instances of others, such as the softeningor toning of surds as in <strong>मूग</strong> for <strong>मूक</strong>, or the dropping of the muteelement of the sonant aspirates as in <strong>होति</strong> and <strong>हेट्ठा</strong>for <strong>भवति</strong>and<strong>अधस्तात्</strong>. But these will be more fully discussed in connectionwith the Prakrits and the vernaculars, in which these processeshave a much wider range.</p>
<p>The vowel <strong>ऋ</strong> is changed to <strong>अ</strong> as in <strong>कसि</strong> for <strong>कृषि</strong>, <strong>तण्हा</strong>for <strong>तृष्णा</strong>,<strong>गढ़</strong> for गृह, घत for <strong>घृत</strong>, <strong>मच्चु</strong> for <strong>मृत्यु</strong> &amp;c. to <strong>इ</strong> as in <strong>दिट्ठ</strong>for <strong>दृष्ट, तिण</strong> for</p>
<p><strong>तृण, मिग</strong> for <strong>मृग, तित्ति</strong> for <strong>तृप्ति गिद्ध</strong> for <strong>गृध्र</strong> &amp;c.; and to <strong>उ</strong> as in <strong>भुस</strong> for <strong>भृश, मुदु</strong>for <strong>मृदु मुसा</strong> for <strong>सृषा, बुस</strong>, <strong>वुस</strong> for <strong>वृष, वुट्ठि</strong> for <strong>वृष्टि</strong> &amp;c. The lastchange generally takes place when the vowel is preceded by alabial; so that the vocal position of the consonant influences thatof the vowel. When there is no such influence, it is changed to<strong>अ</strong> and <strong>इ.</strong> Now, the vowel <strong>ऋ</strong> is composed of a consonantal anda vowel element, the former of which is subordinated to thelatter. On this account it does not give to the consonant to whichit is added the character of a conjunct, and the preceding vowel is not rendered heavy^(1**.<strong>)In Pali this consonantal element disappears in virtue of the inherent inability, which we have considered at such length, of passing from one vocal position toanother without letting off the breath; but the previous consonant is not doubled because the usual character of a conjunct isabsent. Or the disappearance may be accounted for by the factthat the consonantal element is so subordinated to the vowelelement as to escape notice, and that the letter, as a whole, isdifficult to pronounce. The vowel element of is pronounced bybringing the root of the tongue in contact with the root of thepalate, <em>i. e.</em> in the position of the gutturals; and is unrepresentedindependently in the Sanskrit or Pali alphabet. Hence it ispronounced either lower down, in the position of <strong>अ</strong>, or higher upin that of <strong>इ</strong>, while it is sometimes carried so far to the outside asthe position of <strong>उ</strong>, especially when a labial precedes. That thecerebral or <strong>र्</strong> element did exist, and was occasionally preceived bythe Pali speakers is proved by such examples as <strong>रिते</strong>for <strong>ऋते</strong> and</strong>रुक्ख** for <strong>वृक्ष</strong>, and also by the circumstance that in some cases,though it disappears, it changes the following dental to a cerebral, as in <strong>वट्ठि</strong>for <strong>वृद्धि, विसट</strong> for <strong>विसृत, कट</strong> for <strong>कृत</strong> &amp;c.. From theseobservations it would appear that the vowel we have been considering must have been in those days pronounced just in themanner in which Marathi Pandits of the present day pronounceit, and not like <strong>अर्, इर्, र्</strong>, or <strong>रि</strong>as is supposed by several European</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1. This fact is accounted for by the authors and the commentators of thePrātiśākhyas by supposing that the vowel element envelops the <strong>र्</strong> on allsides i. e. precedes it and follows it. (See Vājasaneyi-Prātiśākhya, inIndische Studien, Volume V, p. 145; and Atharva-Prātiśākhya, editedby Whitney I, 37.)</p>
<p>scholars. If <strong>घृत</strong> were really <strong>घर्त,</strong> or <strong>मृग, मिर्ग,</strong> the Pali corruptionswould be <strong>घत्त</strong> or <strong>मिग्ग</strong>; and if <strong>सुकृत</strong> were <strong>सुक्रत</strong>, or <strong>तादृश</strong> were <strong>ताद्रिश</strong>,we should have <strong>सुक्कत</strong> or <strong>तद्दिश</strong>instead of <strong>सुकत</strong>and <strong>तादिस</strong>, and thereis no reason why <strong>ऋतु</strong> and <strong>ऋषि</strong> should have lost their and become<strong>उतु</strong> and <strong>इसि</strong> if they were really pronounced like <strong>रितु</strong> or <strong>रतु</strong>and <strong>रिषि</strong>or <strong>रषि</strong>¹.</p>
<p>The sounds of the Sanskrit diphthongs <strong>ऐ</strong> and <strong>औ</strong>are like thoseof <strong>अइ</strong>and <strong>अउ</strong>uttered rapidly, *i. e.*without allowing any appreciable time to elapse between the two elements. In forming <strong>अ.<strong>the tongue and the lips are in a natural position, the lips, however,not being closed but a little opened; while <strong>इ</strong> requires that themiddle of the tongue should be brought close to the palate, and <strong>उ</strong>,that the lips should be completely rounded. Hence, in pronouncing</strong>ऐ</strong> and <strong>औ</strong> it it is necessary to pass from one vocal position <em>immediately</em>to another, a process of which, as we have seen, the Pali speakerswere incapable. These diphthongs are therefore changed to <strong>ए</strong> and<strong>औ</strong> which partake of the character of both the components. In theformation of <strong>ए</strong> the tongue is not horizontal as in the case of <strong>अ</strong>;its middle is raised up but not brought so close to the palate asin the case of <strong>इ</strong>. Similarly, in pronouncing <strong>ओ</strong>the lips are not socompletely rounded as in the formation of <strong>उ</strong>;neither are they in anatural position as in the case of <strong>अ</strong>. These sounds, therefore,being produced in a position between those of <strong>अ</strong>and <strong>इ</strong>, and <strong>अ</strong>and<strong>उ</strong>, combine the characteristics of both, but are simple, <em>i e,</em> formedin one position only. Thus we have <strong>सेल</strong> for <strong>शैल, तेल</strong>for <strong>तैल, केवट्ट</strong>for <strong>कैवर्त, खोम</strong> for <strong>क्षौम, कोसेय्य</strong> for <strong>कौशेय, मोलि</strong> for <strong>मौलि</strong> &amp;c. Similarly <strong>अय</strong> and <strong>अब</strong> frequently become <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong>; asin <strong>कथेति</strong> for <strong>कथयति</strong>,<strong>पूजेति</strong> for <strong>पूजयति</strong>, <strong>नेति</strong> for <strong>नयति, ओधि</strong> for <strong>अवधि, ओकास</strong> for <strong>अवकाश, नोनीत</strong>for <strong>नवनीत</strong>&amp;c. The sounds of these dissyllables differ from thoseof <strong>ऐ</strong> and <strong>औ</strong>in this respect, that the <strong>अ</strong> of the former is not rapidlypronounced as is that involved in these diphthongs; or, in the words of the grammarians, the value of the first अ is one <em>mātrü</em>and of the other one-half. In the same way the <strong>अ</strong> of the twodissyllables is followed by the semi-vowel <strong>य्</strong> and <strong>व्</strong>, while thatof <strong>ऐ</strong>and <strong>औ</strong>has the corresponding vowels <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong> after it. When<strong>अय</strong> and <strong>अव</strong> are hastily pronounced, this distinction disappears,and these dissyllables assume the form of the diphthongs <strong>ऐ</strong> and <strong>औ</strong>,which by the rule just discussed become <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong>.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1. The explanation of this vowel sound and the others that follow is basedupon the mode in which we Marathas pronounce them at the present day,and which is sanctioned by the Prātiśākhyas.</p>
<p>A long vowel is shortened when it is followed by a doubleconsonant; as in <strong>मग्ग</strong> for <strong>मार्ग, पत्त</strong> for <strong>प्राप्त, इक्खण</strong> for <strong>ईक्षण, कित्ति</strong> forfor <strong>कीर्ति, तिच</strong> for <strong>तीव्र रुक्थ</strong> for <strong>रूक्ष, मुत्त</strong> for <strong>मू</strong>त्र &amp;c. The strongpressure that is necessary for the pronunciation of a conjunctcannot be properly exerted, as formerly observed, without momentum, for the acquisition of which the previous vowel has to beuttered with force and with a jerk. For this purpose a shortvowel alone is fitted, but if a long one precedes, its utterancebeing by its nature slow and weak, the organs for want ofmomentum do not strike against each other with force, and hencethe pressure they exert is weak. But the Pali speaker, catchingfrom his Sanskrit teacher only the generally strong nature of thepressure involved in the utterance of conjuncts, realized it to thefullest possible extent, without stopping to observe how much itwas impaired by the length of the previous vowel, by pronouncingthe previous vowel with force and rapidity, and thus renderingit short. And in this way the real quantity of the syllable is notdiminished. Though the vowel is short, the vocal organs takesome time to emerge from the close contact, and the strongpressure resulting from its forcible utterance, and hence the wholesyllable <strong>इक्</strong>, for instance, in <strong>इक्खण</strong>, has the metrical value of along vowel, <em>i. e.</em> is equal to two <em>mātrās</em> or syllabic instants. Inthe original <strong>ईक्षण</strong>, on the contrary, the pressure in the pronunciation of <strong>क्ष</strong>, being weaker in consequence of the slowness of theprevious vowel utterance, occupies less time; so that in the onecase the shortness of the vowel is accompanied by a longer duration of the contactand in the other the length of the vowel isattended by a shorter duration of the contact. The change, then,we have been considering, is due to the pressure necessary for theformation of the conjunctal sounds in these words having made astrong impression on the ear of the Pali speaker. When, however,the length of the vowel prevailed, and neutralized the pressure tosuch an extent as to render it incapable of attracting attention,the conjunct came to be in the condition of one standing at thebeginning of a word; and, like it, preserved only the more distinctsound and dropped the other, leaving the long vowel unchanged.</p>
<p>We have thus <strong>सीस</strong> for <strong>शीर्ष, दीघ</strong>for <strong>दीर्घ, सासप</strong> for <strong>सर्षप</strong>, &amp;c. It is,however, clear that a long vowel followed by a double consonantis an impossibility in Pali. A Sanskrit conjunct, whenever itmade a distinct impression, was pronounced with the usualcharacteristics of that sound, viz., the previous rapid and forciblevowel utterance and the subsequent strong contact and strongpressure, the perceptible effect of which was the shortening of theprevious vowel and the doubling of the following consonant.</p>
<p>Without the momentum acquired from the force and rapidityof the previous vowel utterance, the Pali speaker could not forma strong contact and exert strong pressure, that is, without ashort preceding vowel they could not pronounce a double consonant. If then the Pali has suoh words as <strong>तेत्तिस (त्रयस्त्रिंशत्), सेट्ठि(श्रेष्ठिन्), नेत्त (नेत्र), सोत्थिय (श्रोत्रिय) योग्गा(योग्या), मोक्ख</strong> &amp;c., it followsthat the vowels <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong> sir were in such cases pronounced short.Similarly, when before doubles <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong> are changed to them, asthey often are, they must be short. This change of <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong> to <strong>ए</strong>and <strong>ओ</strong>arises from the fact that the force and rapidity ofthe jerk with which the current of breath is sent up topronounce the former vowels, is apt to prevent the tonguefrom rising as close to the palate or the lower lip to the upper,as is necessary for the formation of <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>उ</strong>, or they areapt to be forced down by the current. And <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong> differ fromइ and उ simply in the distance between the pronouncing organsbeing greater. This change, therefore, really involves an economy,since the effort to raise up the tongue and the lower lip, aerossthe strong current of breath blowing above, is saved. We havethus, <strong>ओट्ठ</strong> for <strong>उष्ट्र, पोक्खर</strong> for <strong>पुष्कर, पोत्थक</strong> for <strong>पुस्तक, सोण्ड</strong> for <strong>शुण्ड, नेक्ख</strong>for <strong>निष्क, नेत्तिंस</strong> for <strong>निस्त्रिंश, वेस्सभू</strong>for <strong>विश्वभू</strong>&amp;c. In some cases bothvowels are in use, as in the word which has another form<strong>निक्ख</strong>. Sometimes, especially before , was invariably pronouncedshort, though no conjunct followed, and to make up for the lossof quantity thus occasioned the consonant was doubled; as in<strong>थेय्य</strong> for <strong>स्थेय, गेय्य</strong> for <strong>गेप कोसेय्य</strong> for <strong>कौशेय</strong> &amp;c. The vowel <strong>ओ</strong> wasalso similarly treated in a few cases, as in <strong>ओस्सजति</strong> for <strong>अवसृजति</strong>.Thus then not only has the Pali a short <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong>, but the speakersof the language seem to have possessed a predilection for thosesounds. Besides the changes we have examined, there are stray</p>
<p>examples of others, such as <strong>उसु</strong>and <strong>उच्छु</strong>for <strong>इषु</strong>and <strong>इक्षु</strong>, in whichthe <strong>उ</strong> of the following syllable influences the utterance of the firstvowel, सोप्पfor <strong>स्वप्न</strong>, in which the semi-vowel व् is dissolved intothe corresponding vowel <strong>उ</strong>, and thence transformed to short **ओ,**मोर for <strong>मयूर</strong>, in which the <strong>य्</strong> being lightly pronounced loses itsconsonantal character and the vowel <strong>ऊ</strong> with the preceding अforms <strong>ओ</strong>, and others.</p>
<p>You will thus have observed that the phonetic changes whichSanskrit words undergo in passing into the Pali may be broughtunder a few general rules. There are not such various and extensive corruptions both of vowels and consonants as we find in thelater dialects and in the modern vernaculars. It has beenestimated that two-fifths of the Fali vocabulary are composed ofpure Sanskrit words, and the remaining three-fifths, of wordsaltered in one or other of the modes explained above. The conclusion to be drawn from these facts is, that when the Pali was inuse, the tradition of the original Sanskrit was not distant; thewords, so to say, did not stray away long from the motherlanguage, so as to undergo extensive alterations. If so, how isit that some of the changes such as the transformation of ए and औinto <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong> and the assimilation of consonants are so universal, the first being without any exception, and the second withbut a few unimportant ones? The principle which guides phoneticchange is the economy of effort, understanding the word in itswidest sense. This economy is observable in the two kinds ofchanges, as well as in the transformation of surds into sonants,the olision of consonants or of some of their elements, the assimilation of the vowels or the single consonants that make up a word,and in several other processes. But in the Pali there are very few instances of some of these, and none at all of others. Thelanguage had not a sufficiently long duration of independentexistence to bring them into extensive operation. If, then, thetwo processes we have noticed are found in full play in that dialect, the reason must be sought for in the vocal peculiarities ofthe people who spoke it. Though they heard conjunct consonantsand the diphthongs <strong>ऐ</strong> and <strong>औ</strong> pronounced by the speakers ofSanskrit, as correctly as the other letters which they did notcorrupt, their organs were not fitted to utter them. These peculiarities may have been natural or acquired. If natural, the people</p>
<p>who first corrupted Sanskrit into the Pali must have belongedto an alien race which came into close contact with the Äryasand learnt their language. If they were acquired, a branch of thesame Āryan race must be supposed to have been isolated in somepart of the country, and to have developed them, in consequence of being cut off from the main body. But this supposition mustbe rejected for the reasons that have been already given. Suchcomplete isolation as could give rise to new vocal peculiaritiesmust be expected to have occasioned greater phonetio decay inother respects than is observable in the Pali. And our analysisof the Sanskrit conjunctal and the Pali double sounds favoursthe first view. For, we have seen that these latter represent allthe elements of the former, but they are combined in a soundproduced in one vocal position only. The Pali speakers endeavoured to reproduce the sound of a conjuct faithfully, their pronunciation was not weak, as is that prevailing in modern times,but energetic and correct in every other respect; but they couldnot combine energy of utterance with two successive movementsof the vocal organs. This could only be because their organswere not sufficiently trained for the purpose; in other words,because the sounds were foreign to them. The condition of menwho have to learn the language of others is similar to that ofchildren, whose organs of speech are being exercised for the first time. Healthy children, whose utterance is energetic, pronouncethe conjuncts almost in the same way as the Pali speakers did.And there is another instance in History of an alien race havingtreated the sounds of the language of a civilized community injust the same way, The Barbarians who overran Italy anddeveloped the Italian from the Latin, showed the same inabilityto pronounce the Latin conjuncts, and assimilated them as ourPali ancestors did.</p>
<p>If this supposition is correct, we must find other traces of thepeculiarities of this alien race. And such we do find. Theexistence of the short and sit in the Pali, and the predilectionthe people showed for them, as well as the change of dentals tocerebrals without any influencing cause, are similarly to beattributed to the natural vocal tendencies of the people. Thesesounds must have existed and played an important part in theoriginal language of this people, so that they were unable to shake</p>
<p>them off entirely, even when they left their own tongue andlearned that of the more civilized Āryas with whom they came tobe closely incorporated. If the original Pali speakers belonged tothe same race as the Dravidians of Southern India of the presentday, we have a reason to believe that their native tongue contained them; for they exist in the Dravidian languages and arevery characteristic of them.</p>
<p>We shall also find in the Pali, and even in the passage placedbefore you, examples of another phenomenon presented by agrowing language. Several new words, unknown to Sanskrit,but formed from Sanskrit roots, have come into use. Such is<strong>मनापो,</strong> derived very likely from <strong>मनस्</strong> &lsquo;mind&rsquo; or &lsquo;heart&rsquo; and <strong>आप्</strong>&rsquo;to obtain&rsquo; &rsquo;to mee&rsquo;t,so that the word signifies &lsquo;something thatcomes up to the wishes of the heart&rsquo;, &lsquo;pleasing. The word <strong>सचे</strong>is from <strong>चेत्</strong> with <strong>स</strong> prefixed, which स seems to be the same as thenominative singular of the masculine of <strong>तद्</strong>. For, it is so used inSanskrit before <strong>चेत्</strong>, though it has there an independent sense; asin <strong>स चेन्मुनिदौहित्रस्तल्लक्षणोपन्नः</strong> (Śakuntala). Often used together inthis way, the two words formed a compound expression, and,the independent character of being forgotten, it came to belooked upon as one word. In the same way, <strong>सन्तिक</strong> must havecome into existence from the frequent use of such expressions as<strong>तस्सन्तिकं, ब्राह्मणस्सन्तिकं</strong>&amp;c. made up of the genitive singular of anoun or pronoun ending in अ and अन्तिक. The portion <strong>सन्तिक</strong>thencame to be regarded as an independent word, and was used assuch. Another new word is <strong>फासु</strong> or <strong>फासुक</strong> &lsquo;agreeable&rsquo;,&lsquo;pleasant&rsquo;,corresponding to such a Sanskrit word as <strong>स्पर्शु</strong> or <strong>स्पर्शुक</strong> formedfrom the analogy of such verbal derivatives as <strong>भिक्षु इच्छु</strong>, or <strong>लावुक,पातु</strong>क &amp;c., and meaning &rsquo;that which is or deserves to be touched&rsquo;,or &lsquo;pleasant to the touch&rsquo;. Other instances are <strong>पिलन्धन</strong> &lsquo;anornament,&rsquo; <strong>पेय्याल</strong> &lsquo;plentiful&rsquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p><strong>(B)</strong></p>
<p><strong>GRAMMAR OF THE PALI DIALECT</strong></p>
<p>We will now proceed to the examination of Pali grammar.When after years of successive creative efforts, the language ofour Āryan ancestors came to be so rich in all kinds of grammatical forms, as the Vedicor middle Sanskrit is, it became cumbrous,and the tendency set in, as we have seen, of dropping away someof them and rendering the grammar simpler.</p>
<p>The duals of both nouns and verbs are unnecessary; the occasions for using them do not often present themselves. Hence, evenin Sanskrit, their use must have been rare, and the Pali, which,in its original form at least, must be taken to represent the currentusage, has dropped them away altogether.</p>
<p>But the manner in which the process of simplification is principally carried on is by the use of false analogies. Thus in Sanskritnouns ending in <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong> of the neuter gender prefix <strong>न्</strong> to theterminations of the vowel cases. But in Pali it is added to thoseof the corresponding cases of masculine nouns also in <strong>मच्चुनो</strong> for<strong>मृत्योः</strong>in the passage before us. Similarly, from the analogy ofneuter nouns in which form their nominative and accusativesingular by adding <strong>म्</strong>, the pronouns <strong>यद्</strong> and <strong>तद्</strong> a come to have <strong>यं</strong> and<strong>तं</strong> for the corresponding cases, instead of the Sanskrit <strong>यद्</strong> and <strong>तद्</strong>.</p>
<p>In Sanskrit, the conjugation that is very often used is thefirst, in which अ is tacked on to the root in the special tenses, andit embraces a large number of the most ordinary roots. Here, inour passage, we find the analogy extended to the root <strong>हिंस्</strong> thepresent tense of which is in the mother dialect ordinarily formedby inserting <strong>न</strong> between the two letters, and adding the termination to the final (<strong>हिनस्ति</strong> 3rd person singular), and we have <strong>हिंसति</strong>.The root <strong>ज्ञा</strong> takes the form of <strong>जा</strong> in the present and other specialtenses, and to it is added the conjugational sign ना, so that itbecomes <strong>जाना</strong>. Now, this special form is generalized, and used inother tenses also, such as the Aorist and the Future. Thus, wehave here <strong>संजानिंसु</strong>, the Aorist 3rd person plural of <strong>ज्ञा</strong>, and in otherplaces we find <strong>जानिस्तति</strong> as one of the forms of the Future. Thespecial forms <strong>इच्छ, पश्य, शृणु, बुध्य</strong>, and <strong>पद्य</strong> are similarly generalized,the last four being phonetically changed to <strong>पस्स, सुण, बुज्झ</strong>and <strong>पज्ज</strong>.</p>
<p>In the same way, in forming the causative of a root, <strong>प</strong> or <strong>आप</strong>is added in Sanskrit to roots ending in <strong>आ</strong> and to a few others. Itis extended to all roots in the Pali, and thus we have <strong>तिकिच्छापेहि</strong>for <strong>चिकित्सय</strong> in the above passage.</p>
<p>The termination <strong>त्वा</strong>of the absolutive is in Sanskrit replacedby <strong>य</strong> when a root has a preposition prefixed to it. But here nosuch distinction is observed, and ldbe is <strong>त्वा</strong> used in all cases.</p>
<p>The operation of this law of false analogies is very extensive</p>
<p>in the grammar of Pali and the later Prakrits; and by its means,new forms have been made up instead of those current in theprimitive language. But side by side with these, we often findthe latter also in use currupted by the usual phonetic laws, andhaving a sort of isolated existence, since they transgress thegeneral rule that has newly come into operation. Thus we have<strong>जानिस्सति, परिसस्सति</strong> and <strong>लभिस्सति</strong> according to the law of analogy;but <strong>ञस्सति</strong> from <strong>ज्ञास्यति, दक्खति</strong> from <strong>द्रक्ष्यति</strong>, and <strong>लच्छाते</strong> from <strong>लप्स्पते</strong>are also in use. These three processes then, <em>viz</em>., the droppingaway of forms, not required for the expression of the currentordinary thought, the formation of new ones on the principle ofanalogy, and the preservation of the old ones in what may becalled an isolated or petrified condition, have contributed to theformation of the grammar of this and the succeeding languages.With these preliminary observations, I will now hastily passunder review the principal points in the grammar of this dialect¹.</p>
<p>Pali and other DialectsThe Pali has lost the dual, and also the dative and ablative cases, except of masculine and neuter nouns ending in अ**^(*)**</p>
<p>.Theonly occasion when the first is ordinarily used is when &lsquo;giving&rsquo;is expressed, but the genitive case has such a comprehensivesignification in Sanskrit that it denotes the dative relation also,and is often used in that sense. Most of the relations expressedby the ablative are denoted by the instrumental, and for theexpression of the peculiar ablative sense, <em>viz</em>., the separation of onething from another, the particle <strong>तम्</strong>had come into very generaluse, even in the parent language. The genitive and instrumentalthus took up the place of those two cases. But people do notforget what they have frequent occasion to use. The great majorityof nouns in Sanskrit end in <strong>अ</strong>, and of these the singular isoftener used than the plural. Hence the singulars of the dativeand ablative of these nouns are preserved in the Pali, notwithstanding the operation of the causes that drove away these casesfrom other places.</p>
<p>The <strong>भ</strong> of the termination of the instrumental plural isoptionally changed to <strong>ह</strong>. The locative singular of masculine andneuter nouns ending in a vowel is formed by adding the pronominal termination <strong>स्मिन्,</strong> phonetically changed to <strong>स्मिं</strong>and <strong>म्हि</strong>; andthe ablative <strong>स्मात्</strong> in the form of <strong>स्मा</strong> or <strong>म्हा</strong>is used optionally in thecase of nouns in <strong>अ</strong>. The termination <strong>स्य</strong> of the genitive singularof this class of nouns is generalized, and in the form of <strong>स्स</strong> appliedto all nouns of the masculine and neuter genders. It should beremembered that in accordance with the general rule, the Sanskritgrammatical forms drop the final consonant, including a visarga,in passing into the Pali. The nasal <strong>म्</strong> is changed to an anusvāra,and since this, like a conjunct consonant, necessitates the rapidutterance of the preceding vowel and renders it heavy, the vowelis shortened. We have thus <strong>नं</strong> for <strong>नाम्, स्सं</strong> for <strong>स्याम्</strong> <strong>यं</strong>for <strong>याम्</strong>, &amp;c.The <strong>न्</strong> of <strong>स्मिन्</strong>and of the syllable <strong>अन्</strong> occurring in some of thecases is also changed to anusvära.</p>
<p>____________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1.My authority in this portion of my subject is Kacchāyana, as edited by M. Senart.</p>
<p>*The ablative अग्गिस्मा-म्हा, भिक्खुस्मा-श्हा do, however, occur in the literature.</p>
<p><strong>[THE NOUN]</strong></p>
<p><strong>MASCULINE NOUNS ENDING IN अ</strong></p>
<p>The nominative singular always ends in <strong>ओ</strong>. In Sanskrit wehave this form before a short <strong>अ</strong> or a sonant only. Here it isgeneralized. The accusative plural ends in <strong>ए</strong> as <strong>बुद्धे</strong>. When thefinal consonant is dropped according to the usual phonetic rules,the Sanskrit nominative and accusative plurals become exactlyalike. To distinguish the one from the other, therefore, this formis appropriated in the Pali for the latter. The appears to be thetermination of the nominative plural of pronouns, and it istransferred to nouns in the same way as the others we havenoticed above. But it is used here in an accusative sense.</p>
<p>The forms of the singular and plural of the nominative ofneuter nouns, and of the plural of many more, are the same asthose of the accusative in Sanskrit, and this fact must have ledto a tendency to liken the two cases in other places also. Hence the pronominal nominative came to be used like an accusative.We shall directly see this tendency to confuse the two casesmanifested more clearly as regards the plural, and it may beremarked that as regards both the numbers, it went on increasingat each successive stage, until in the latest Prakrit and in thevernaculars the distinction has entirely disappeared.</p>
<p>The termination of the instrumental plural is <strong>एभि</strong>as in <strong>बुद्धोभि</strong>,with the mute elament dropped, <strong>एहि</strong> which is traced to theVedic <strong>एभिः</strong> in such forms as <strong>देवेभिः</strong>.But t may be explained otherwise. Tho Sanskrit <strong>बुद्धैः</strong>becomes <strong>बुद्धे</strong> by the dropping of the visarga and the change of the diphthong to <strong>ए</strong>, and this is the sameas the locative singular, and is by no means distinctive of aninstrumental sense. Hence to <strong>बुद्धे</strong> was added the instrumentaltermination भि or हिwhich all other nouns in Sanskrit and Palitake.</p>
<p>The other cases are the same as in Sanskrit, subject to thegeneral remarks made above. The ablative and locative singularshave the new pronominal forms in <strong>स्मा</strong> or <strong>म्हा</strong> and <strong>स्मिं</strong> or <strong>म्हि</strong>in addition to the old ones. In the vocative singular, the final <strong>अ</strong> isoptionally lengthened.</p>
<p><strong>MASCULINE NOUNS IN इ AND उ</strong></p>
<p>The nominative and accusative plurals have two forms andthey are the same for both the cases, as <strong>अग्गी</strong> and <strong>अग्गयो,भिक्खू</strong> and<strong>भिक्खवो</strong>. Now <strong>अग्गी</strong> and <strong>भिक्खू</strong> are the Sanskrit accusative plurals<strong>अग्नीन्</strong>and <strong>भिक्षून्,</strong> and <strong>अग्गपो</strong> and <strong>भिक्खवो</strong>the nominative plurals<strong>अग्नयः</strong> and <strong>भिक्षवः</strong>.The distinction between the two is lost, andboth are used indifferently in the sense of the nominative andaccusative.</p>
<p>The termination of the instrumental plural is <strong>भि</strong> or <strong>हि</strong>. Thesingulars of the genitive and locative are, like those of the corresponding neuter nouns or nouns ending in <strong>इन्</strong> such as <strong>दण्डिन्</strong>, formedby the addition of <strong>न्</strong>, as <strong>अग्गिनो</strong>and <strong>भिक्खुनो</strong>, <strong>अग्गिनि</strong> and <strong>भिक्खुनि</strong>.They have also the forms indicated in the general remarks, viz.,<strong>अग्गिस्स</strong> and <strong>भिक्खुस्स</strong>and <strong>अग्गिंस्मि</strong>–<strong>म्हि</strong> and <strong>भिक्खुस्मि</strong>–<strong>म्हि</strong> and thedative and ablative are, as usual, like the genitive and instrumental. The vocative is like the nominative, except in the pluralof nouns in <strong>उ</strong> which ends in <strong>वो</strong> or <strong>वे</strong> as <strong>भिक्खवो</strong> or <strong>भिक्खवे</strong>. The restare old or Sanskrit; the final vowel being, however, lengthened inthe plural of the instrumental and locative, and the syllable <strong>ग्नि</strong>of <strong>अग्नि</strong> being optionally dissolved into <strong>ग्गिनि</strong> in the nominativesingular.</p>
<p><strong>MASCULINE NOUNS IN ऋ</strong></p>
<p>The nominative has the old Sanskrit forms; as <strong>सत्था</strong> and heart <strong>सत्थारो</strong></p>
<p>for <strong>शास्ता</strong> and <strong>शास्तारः</strong>from <strong>शास्तृ</strong>. The accusative plural is thesame as the nominative plural. The augmented form of theSanskrit nominative plural, <em>viz.</em> <strong>सत्थार</strong> for <strong>शास्तार</strong>,is taken as thebase for the plural of the instrumental, genitive, and locative,and declined like nouns in <strong>अ</strong>. The genitive plural is also formedby taking the nominative singular as the base, as <strong>सत्थानं</strong>. Theinstrumental singular has the new base and the old termination<strong>आ</strong>; and thus we have <strong>सत्थारा</strong>. The genitive singular has threeforms, one of them being the old one with the final <strong>र्</strong> dropped, as <strong>सत्थु</strong>, and the other two made up by taking this form as the base,and appending the terminations which nouns in उ as <strong>भिक्खु</strong>take,as <strong>सत्थुस्स</strong> or <strong>सत्थुनो</strong>. The singulars of the accusative and locativehave the Sanskrit forms, as <strong>सत्थारं</strong>and <strong>सत्थार</strong>; and the vocativesingular has besides the old one another with the vowel lengthened,as <strong>सत्थ</strong> or <strong>सत्था</strong>. You will thus see that there are four bases, theold one which gives the old forms, and three new ones, <strong>सत्था</strong>and<strong>सत्थार</strong> generalized from the nominative, and सत्थु, from the genitive.</p>
<p><strong>MASCULINE NOUNS ENDING IN A CONSONANT.</strong></p>
<p>There can be no consonantal declension proper, since a finalconsonant is dropped, and the noun treated as one ending in thepreceding vowel. But relics of the Sanskrit forms of the consonantal bases are preserved and used along with the others.</p>
<p>In the declension of the noun <strong>आत्मन्</strong>, there are two new bases<strong>अत्त</strong> and <strong>अत्तन</strong>, generalized from the forms of the singular of theSanskrit nominative, and of the instrumentals and others, <strong>आत्मा</strong>and <strong>आत्मना</strong> &amp;c., and declined like nouns in . The first is usedin the singular of the accusative, and the plurals of the genitiveand locative, which are <strong>अन्नं, अत्तानं</strong> and <strong>अत्तेसु</strong>; and the second inthe plural of the instrumental which is <strong>अत्तनेहि-भि</strong>. The remainingforms are old, the portion <strong>आत्म</strong>being corrupted to <strong>अत्त</strong>; they are<strong>अत्ता</strong> nominative singular, <strong>अत्तानो</strong>nominative and accusative plural,<strong>अत्तानं</strong> accusstive singular, <strong>अत्तना</strong> instrumental Biupulor, <strong>अत्तनो</strong>genitive singular, and <strong>अत्तनि</strong> locative singular. The vocative is<strong>अत्त</strong> or <strong>अत्ता</strong>, like that of nouns in <strong>अ</strong>.</p>
<p>In the declension of the noun <strong>राजन्</strong>, the base <strong>राज</strong> is used in thesingulars of the accusative, the instrumental, and perhaps theablative also, and the forms are<strong>राजं, राजेन</strong>, and <strong>राजस्मा</strong> or <strong>राजम्हा</strong>.</p>
<p>The old forms are found in the nominative (राजा, राजानो), and inthe singular of the accusative which has thus two forms <strong>राजं</strong> and<strong>राजानं</strong>, and the plural of this last case is, as usual, the same asthat of the first. The singulars of the instrumental, genitive, and locative are the same as those in Sanskrit, but <strong>ज्ञ</strong> beingchanged to <strong>ञ्त्र</strong>, we have <strong>रञ्त्रा</strong>, <strong>रञ्ञो</strong>, and <strong>रञ्ञि</strong>. In the last twocases the conjunct is also dissolved into <strong>जिन</strong>, wherefore we have<strong>राजिनो</strong> and <strong>राजिनि</strong> also. The genitive plural in <strong>रञ्ञं</strong> and, <strong>ज्ञ</strong> beingdissolved into <strong>जुन</strong>, the form <strong>राजूनं</strong> is used, in addition. This <strong>रज्जु</strong>is made the base of the plurals of the instrumental and locative;and thus we have <strong>राजूभि-हि</strong> and <strong>राजूसु</strong>. The vocative singular islike that of nouns in <strong>अ</strong>.</p>
<p>The suffixes <strong>वत्</strong> and <strong>मत्</strong> of such nouns as <strong>गुणवत्</strong> and <strong>सतिमत्</strong> areregarded as if they were <strong>वन्त</strong> and <strong>मन्त</strong>, and the nouns declined likethose ending in at in the singulars of the nominative, accusativeand genitive, and in the plurals of the accusative, instrumental, genitive and locative; and, according to the commentator of Kacchāyana,in the singulars of the instrumental and locative also; as <strong>गुणवन्तो,गुणवन्तं गुणवन्तस्म, गुणवन्ते, गुणवन्तोभि-हि</strong>, <strong>गुणवन्तानं</strong> and <strong>गुणवन्तेसु</strong>; also<strong>गुणवन्तेन</strong> and <strong>गुणवन्तस्मिं-म्हि.</strong> The old forms are preserved in bothnumbers of the nominative and genitive, and in the singulars ofthe instrumental, locative, and vocative; as <strong>गुणवा, गुणवन्तो, गुणवतो,गुणवतं गुणवता, गुणवति</strong>, and <strong>गुणवं</strong>, The nominstive singular is madethe base of other forms of the singulars of the accusative, genitiveand vocative, as <strong>गुणवं, गुणवस्स</strong> and <strong>गुणव</strong>or <strong>गुणवा</strong>. The present participles, Parasmaipada, are similarly declined, the only differencebeing in the nominative singular, as <strong>गच्छं</strong>.</p>

<p>The nominative, besides the old forms, has another transferredfrom nouns in <strong>ई</strong>; as <strong>कञ्ञायो</strong>. The singulars of the instrumentaland the succeeding cases, excepting the vocative, have one sameform made up from the Sanskrit genitive by dropping the visargaand shortening the final vowel; as <strong>कञ्ञाय</strong>, instrumental, dative,ablative, genitive, and locative singular. The others andalso the locative singular have the old forms; as <strong>कञ्ञाभि-हि</strong>instrumental and ablative plural, <strong>कञ्ञानं</strong> genitive and dativeplural, and <strong>कञ्ञायं</strong>and <strong>कञ्ञासु</strong>locative singular and plural.</p>
<p>The final member <strong>य</strong> of the conjunct which appears in the caseforms of nouns i<strong>n ई</strong> such as <strong>नन्दी</strong>, is dissolved into <strong>इय</strong>, and thus wehave <strong>नदियो</strong> from the Sanskrit <strong>नद्य</strong>; and this and <strong>नदी</strong> from theSanskrit <strong>नदीः</strong>are both of them the plurals of the nominative andaccusative; <strong>नद्या</strong>the singular of the instrumental is dissolved into<strong>नदिया</strong>, and also <strong>नद्याः</strong> of the ablative and genitive which, afterdropping the visarga, becomes नद्याः^(<strong>*</strong>); and this is extended to thelocative singular, which has also another form <strong>नदियं</strong>, from <strong>नद्याम्</strong>.There is nothing particular about the rest. Nouns in short <strong>इ</strong> aredeclined in exactly the same way, except that Kacchāyana givessuch forms as <strong>रत्त्या</strong>and <strong>रत्त्यं</strong>in addition to <strong>रत्तिया</strong> and <strong>रत्तियं</strong> for thesingular of the ablative and locative.</p>
<p>Nouns in <strong>उ</strong> or <strong>ऊ</strong> follow completely the analogy of those in <strong>ई</strong>;the forms of <strong>वधू</strong>, for instance, are not derived from the corresponding Sanskrit forms of the noun, but are made up by adding thefinal syllables of those of <strong>नदी</strong>; as <strong>वधुयो</strong>nominative and accusativeplural, <strong>वधुया</strong> singular instrumental, ablative, genitive, &amp;c.</p>
<p><strong>NEUTER NOUNS</strong></p>
<p>The singular of the nominative and accusative of neuter nounsending in a vowel is the same as in the parent tongue, but theforms of the plural are optionally like those of the correspondingmasculine nouns; as <strong>रूपा</strong> or <strong>रूपानि</strong> nominative plural, and <strong>रूपे</strong> orरू<strong>पानि</strong>accusative plural; <strong>अट्ठी</strong> ( like <strong>अग्गी</strong>) or <strong>अट्ठीनि</strong>nominative andaccusative plural, <strong>आयू</strong> or <strong>आयूनि</strong> nominative and accusative plural.</p>
<p>As in the case of masculine nouns, such neuter uouns as have&amp; final consonant in Sanskrit drop it and are treated as if theyended in the preceding vowel. But in the singulars the old formsare preserved; as <strong>मनो</strong>or <strong>मनं</strong>nominative and accusative, <strong>मनसा</strong>or<strong>मनेन</strong> instrumental, <strong>मनसो</strong> genitive, <strong>मनसि, मने</strong> or <strong>मनस्मि-म्हि</strong> locative.</p>
<p><strong>PRONOUNS</strong></p>
<p>As pronominal terminations have been transferred to nouns,a few nominal ones have been extended to pronouns, thus carryingon the process of unification a step further. The plural of thenominative of feminine pronouns has a form ending in <strong>यो</strong>, and thesingulars of the instrumental and genitive end in <strong>आय</strong> or <strong>या</strong> andthat of the locative in <strong>यं</strong>, as in the case of the correspondingnouns as <strong>तायो</strong> nominative plural, <strong>ताय</strong> or <strong>तस्सा, इमाय</strong> or <strong>इमस्सा अमुया</strong>or <strong>अमुस्सा</strong> genitive singular and <strong>तायं</strong> or <strong>तस्सं, इमायं</strong> or<strong>इमिस्सं, असूयं</strong> or<strong>अमुस्सं</strong> locative singular, of <strong>तद्, इदम्</strong>and <strong>अदम्</strong>. All pronouns of thethird person, of whatever gender, form the genitive plural byadding <strong>सं</strong> from the Sanskrit <strong>साम्</strong>, and also <strong>सानं</strong> which is made upof <strong>सं</strong>, the pronominal, and <strong>नं</strong>, the nominal termination, so that thesecond form is the genitive of the first taken as a base, as <strong>तेसं</strong>or<strong>तेसानं</strong>, <strong>तासं</strong> or <strong>तासानं</strong>, &amp;c. Similarly, the bases <strong>एती</strong> and <strong>इमी</strong> which are substituted for <strong>एता</strong>and <strong>इमा</strong> in the singulars of the genitiveand locative, and <strong>ती</strong> which optionally replaces <strong>ता</strong> in these cases,have a genitive singular with a double termination; as <strong>तस्सा</strong>, <strong>तिस्सा</strong>or <strong>तिस्साय, एतिस्सा</strong> or <strong>एतिस्साय, इमिस्सा</strong> or <strong>इमिस्साय</strong>, where <strong>स्सा</strong>, Sanskrit<strong>स्याः</strong>, is the pronominal, and <strong>आय</strong> the nominal termination. Theplurals of the nominative and accusative have the same form, as<strong>ते, सब्बे,</strong> <strong>ता</strong>or <strong>तायो</strong>, &amp;c., and the instrumental plural of the masculine has, like that of nouns, the termination <strong>एभि</strong>or <strong>एहि</strong>. Theremaining terminations are the same as in Sanskrit.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>*****The Sanskrit form नद्या corrupted to नज्जा is also found used.</p>
<p>The correlative or remote demonstrative <strong>तद्</strong>has, besides theusual Sanskrit base, another <strong>न</strong> which has all the cases <strong>नं, नेन</strong>, &amp;c.,except the nominative singular. The base is generalized fromthe <strong>एनम्, एनेन</strong> &amp;c. of the accusative, the singular of the instrumental, and the dual of the genitive and locative, which are usedin making <em>anvādeśa</em>as it is called by Pāṇini, <em>i. e.</em> in referring toone who has already been spoken of. The near demonstrativeइदम् has two bases, <strong>अ</strong> and <strong>इम</strong>. In Sanskrit this latter is used inthe nominative dual and plural and in the accusative. Here it isextended to all the cases except the nominative singular, and sowe have <strong>इमे, इमिना, इमेहि, इमस्मा, इमस्स, इमेसं,</strong> <strong>इमस्मिं</strong>, and <strong>इमेसु; इमाय,इमिस्सा</strong>, &amp;c. The first base is used, as in Sanskrit, in all casesexcept the plural of the nominative and accusative and the formsare <strong>अयं, अनेन</strong>, ए<strong>हि, अस्मा</strong> &amp;c. The pronoun <strong>अदस्</strong>has the base <strong>असु</strong> for thenominative singular, and <strong>अमु</strong> for all other cases and this latter islengthened in the plural; as <strong>अमुना, अमूहि अमुस्मा,</strong> <strong>अमुस्स, अमूसं;अमुया,अमुस्सा,</strong> &amp;c. The nominative and accusative of the neuter is <strong>अदुं</strong>.</p>
<p>The singulars of the pronouns of the first and second personsare the same as in Sanskrit as <strong>अहं, मं, मया, मम</strong> or <strong>मे</strong>, snd <strong>मयि;त्वं, त्वं, त्वया, त</strong>वor <strong>ते</strong>, and <strong>त्वयि.</strong> This syllable is optionally dissolved</p>
<p>into <strong>तु</strong>in the nominative and accusative, which have thus <strong>तुवं</strong>,and changed to <strong>त</strong>in the latter as well as in the instrumental andlocative; and so we have <strong>तं, तया</strong>and <strong>तयि</strong>also. The dative andgenitive being confounded, the Sanskrit <strong>मह्यम्</strong>and <strong>तुभ्यम्</strong> of theformer are in the form of <strong>मय्हं</strong>and <strong>तुय्हं</strong> used for both cases. Thelatter has also the forms <strong>ममं</strong> and <strong>अम्हं</strong> and <strong>तुम्हं</strong>, the anusvāra beinginserted from the analogy of the plural. The plural of <strong>अहं</strong>is<strong>मयं</strong> in which the initial <strong>व</strong> of the Sanskrit form is changed to <strong>म</strong>; andin the accusative, instrumental, and locative, the Sanskrit base<strong>अस्म</strong> in the form <strong>अम्ह</strong> is declined like the masculine <strong>तद्</strong>, and theforms are <strong>अम्हे</strong> <strong>अम्हेहि</strong> and <strong>अम्हेसु</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>यु</strong> of <strong>युष्मद्</strong>was probably weakly pronounced, hence thesingular base <strong>तु</strong> has been transferred to the plural, and the peculiarsyllable of this number <strong>स्म</strong> tacked on to it, and the whole in theform of <strong>तुम्ह</strong> is declined like <strong>तद्</strong> in all the cases except the genitive;as <strong>तुम्हे, तुम्हे, तुम्हेहि</strong>&amp;c.The forms of the plurals of the last arelike those in Sanskrit, as <strong>अम्हाकं</strong> and <strong>तुम्हाकं</strong>. The accusative singulars of these pronouns have the forms <strong>ममं</strong> and <strong>तवं</strong>, besides thosementioned above. These are made up by adding anusvāra, thesign of the accusative, to the form of the genitive used as a base.</p>
<p>On the same principle we have <strong>अम्हाकं</strong>and <strong>तुम्हाकं</strong>for the plural,but as the genitive forms have an anusvära already, the additionof the accusative sign makes no difference. This is an isolatedinstance in this dialect of a method of constructing new caseforms, which is, we shall find as we proceed in our investigations,largely used in the later dialects and especially in the modernvernaculars.</p>
<p>You will have seen how naturally the new formations we havenoticed grew up. A language is well learnt by others or correctlytransmitted to them only when they are in constant and closeintercourse with those who know it, or when they are deliberatelytaught. When for some reason or other this is not the case,and the linguistic tradition is imperfect, men proceed from whatis more in use and consequently better known to that which isless used and less known. Nouns in , for instance, constitutea very large portion of the ordinary Sanskrit names. Their case.forms were most used, whence they were well known and those ofthe other nouns not being so often used were less known. In</p>
<p>these cases these less forms had to conform to the model of themore known, and thus we see a tendency to bring nouns as closeas possible to the <strong>अ</strong> declension, as you have seen in such nouns as<strong>आत्मन्, गुणवत्, गच्छत् शास्तृ</strong>, and even <strong>अग्नि</strong>. And it is also clear thatthe new <strong>अ</strong> base is generally taken from the nominative, whichcase is oftener used than others as <strong>अत्त, गुणवन्त इच्छन्त</strong>, and <strong>सत्तार</strong><em>i. e.</em> <strong>शास्तार</strong>. In the same way we have observed a strong tendencyto obliterate the distinction between the nominal and pronominaldeclensions, and fuse them into one, and this tendency hassucceeded everywhere except in the genitive plural. Stillat the time when Pali arose, the traditions of the originalSanskrit were not entirely lost, wherefore we have oftenold forms used side by side with the new ones. The same process is observable in the conjugations of verbs, as I havealready remarked. It will thus be seengroundless is the opinion of those who maintain that these Prakrits orderived languages were simply literary languages, or were constructed by Pandits. But this point will be discussed at lengthhereafter.</p>
<p>Inattention to this law of false analogies or generalization, andto the wide range of its operation in the formation of Paligrammar has led some scholars to set down as Vedic certain formswhich exist in this dialectbut are not to be met with in classicalSanskrit. Such are <strong>इमस्स</strong> the genitive singular masculine of <strong>इदम्,फला</strong> the nominative plural of <strong>फल, अट्टी</strong> and <strong>मधू</strong> nominstive andaccusative plural of <strong>अस्थि</strong> and <strong>मधु, अम्हे</strong> the general plural baseof the pronoun of the first person, and genitive plural of <strong>गो</strong>. Isee no icason why should be regarded as Vedic and notthe other forms that have <strong>इम</strong> for their base, such ss <strong>इमस्मा, इमेसं</strong>,&amp;c., or why <strong>फला</strong>should be so and not <strong>फले</strong> the accusative plural;<strong>अम्ह</strong> and not <strong>तुम्हे, अट्ठी</strong>and not <strong>अट्ठिस्स,</strong> or <strong>गोनं</strong> and not <strong>अभिभूनं</strong>. Ifthese latter forms and a host of others must be explained with reference to a thoroughly different principle, why should the former,which are kindred to them and are as completely capable of thatsame explanation, be traced to a Vedic origin? The fact that theyhappen to resemble certain Vedic forms does not prove theirderivation from them. The same process of generalization and thesame natural tendency to construct the less known forms from the</p>
<p>analogy of those that are more known brought them all into use.The former <strong>फला</strong> and <strong>फले</strong> and <strong>अट्ठी</strong> and <strong>मधू</strong> are, as stated before, madeup upon the analogy of the corresponding masonline, and hereinwe observe the beginning of a tendency to obliterate the distinction between the masculine and neuter, which went on progressing until now, in the Hindi, Sindhi, and other vernaculars ofNorthern India, the neuter gender has totally disappeared, whilein the Marathi the distinction remains in the case of pronounsand certain nouns, and in the Gujarati only in the latter.</p>
<p><strong>II</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE VERB.</strong></p>
<p>We will now examine the Pali verb. The distinction betweerthe special and general tenses and moods is almost lost, thespecial form being used in the general, as in <strong>गच्छिस्सति</strong>the futureof <strong>गम्</strong>, or the general form in the special as <strong>गमेति</strong>. We have also<strong>गमिस्सति</strong> and <strong>गच्छति</strong>.A large number of roots used in ordinary intercourse belong in Sanskrit to the first conjugation; this and thesixth are the easiest of the ten; in many cases there is no practical distinction between them, and in others they are so greatlylike each other that they are capable of being confused together.Hence the rule of constructing verbal forms common to thesetwo conjugations, <em>viz</em>. the additition of the personal terminationsthrough the intervention of <strong>अ</strong>, has become general in Pali. Agood many roots belonging to the other classes are conjugatedaccording to this rule; as <strong>दोहति,</strong> <strong>विदति</strong>, and <strong>रवति</strong>, for <strong>दोग्धि, वेत्ति,</strong> and<strong>रौति</strong>, of the second class; <strong>पोसति</strong> for <strong>पुष्यति</strong>, <strong>मुसति</strong> and <strong>बन्धति</strong> for <strong>मुष्णाति</strong>and <strong>बध्नाति</strong>, &amp;c. The tenth conjugation is almost equally commonin Sanskrit, whence a great many roots are conjugated necessarilyor optionally in this way; as <strong>वदेमि</strong> or<strong>वदामि, गमेति</strong> or <strong>गच्छति,सिलेसेति, वेदेति</strong> or <strong>विदति विगाहेति</strong> &amp;c. from <strong>वद्, गम, श्लिष्विद, गाह्</strong>with<strong>वि</strong>, &amp;c. The <strong>ए</strong> in these formis stands, you will remember, for theSanskrit <strong>अय</strong>, which is the characteristic of the tenth class.</p>
<p>The second conjugation has gone out, except in isolated formssuch as <strong>अत्थि</strong> for <strong>अस्ति</strong>, and the third has left some reduplicatedroots, as <strong>ददामि, जहाति</strong>, &amp;c. The fourth has preserved a good manyof its roots but its u is corrupted according to the usual phoneticrules thus <strong>बुध्य</strong> becomes <strong>बुझ पद्य,पज्ज;नृत्य,नच्च;मञ्ञ</strong>&amp;c. The</p>
<p>fifth and the ninth are confounded, and roots of the former takethe termination of the latter also as <strong>पापुणोति</strong> or <strong>पावुणाति</strong> for <strong>प्राप्नोति;सुणोति</strong> or <strong>सुणाति</strong> for <strong>शृणोति;सक्कोति</strong> or <strong>सक्कणाति</strong> for <strong>शक्नोति</strong>&amp;c. In thelast instance the base is <strong>सक्क</strong> derived from <strong>सक्कोति</strong> the corruption of<strong>शक्नोति</strong>, thus showing that the forms in <strong>ना</strong>are a later growth. Theseventh inserts, as before remarked, a nasal in the body of theroots and transfers them to the first; the eighth remains in a fewcases such as <strong>तन्</strong> and <strong>कृ</strong>, though this last takes a peculiar formalso, as <strong>तनोति, करोति</strong> or <strong>कयिरति</strong>; and the ninth adds <strong>ना</strong>as in Sanskrit,as <strong>किणाति, धुनाति लुनाति पुनाति</strong>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>But it is to be observed that the more common of the rootsbelonging to these conjugations only have preserved their peculiarforms; the rest are conjugated according to the rules of the first,sixth, or tonth. Since the distinction between the special andgeneral tenses and moods is lost, the effect of these conjugationalpeculiarities is only to constitute a new or augmented root.</p>
<p>Of the ten tenses and moods in Sanskrit, the Pali has lost two,the first future and the precative. The two Padas or voicesremain, but the distinction is lost in most cases, such forms as<strong>वुच्चति, लब्भति, पच्चति</strong>&amp;c., though passive, taking Parasmaipadaterminations.</p>
<p>The following are the terminations:—</p>

<p>The terminations of the Present of both Padas are the same asin Sanskrit, with the exception of the plural <strong>ञ</strong>and <strong>म्हे</strong>, the <strong>व्ह</strong>of the second person plural of the Ātmanepada being a corruptionof <strong>ध्वे</strong>. This tense is most in use; hence the Pali speakers learnedit well, so to say, from their Sanskrit teachers.</p>
<p>The other tenses,— except the Future which, like the Present,is also entirely Sanskrit and the moods have preserved such oftheir forms as are more frequently used in ordinary life.Thereis, for instance, greater occasion for the use of the second personsingular of the Imperative Mood, and also for the third personHence these are the same as in Sanskrit, but the second personplural termination <strong>थ</strong> , and the first person singular <strong>मि</strong>and theplural <strong>म</strong>, Parasmaipada, have been transferred from the Present.As to these, even in Sanskrit we find the Present used verygenerally for this Mood in the first person; as in <strong>किं ते भूयःप्रियमुपहराामि</strong>Śāk.,<strong>किं ते भूयः प्रियं करोमि</strong> Mṛc., &amp;c. where the formsshould be <strong>उपहराणि, करवाणि</strong> &amp;e. The rest are the same as in Sanskrit.The second person singular is formed in two ways, <em>viz.</em> withoutadding any termination as in the conjugations which give anending <strong>अ</strong> to the base, and by appending <strong>हि</strong> as is done in theothers. The Ātmanepada <strong>स्व</strong> is changed to <strong>स्सु</strong>, the <strong>व</strong> being dissolved into <strong>उ</strong>, since <strong>स्व</strong> renders the previous vowel heavy, theresulting <strong>सु</strong> is doubled to preserve that effect. The plural <strong>ध्वम्</strong> isaltered to <strong>व्हो</strong>, the <strong>म</strong> and the mute element being dropped, we have<strong>व्ह</strong> the final vowel of which is transformed into <strong>ओ</strong> through theinfluence of the preceding <strong>व्</strong>. The <strong>ऐ</strong> of the first person singularbecomes <strong>ए</strong>, or this may be considered to have been transferredfrom the Present, and for the plural we have <strong>आमसे</strong> which is anold Vedic termination of the Ātmanepads first person plural corrupted in Sanskrit to <strong>आमहे</strong>. The <strong>तं</strong> and <strong>अन्तं</strong> of the third personare the same as the <strong>ताम्</strong> and <strong>अन्ताम्</strong> of the parent language.</p>
<p>The Potential has preserved the old forms of the third persononly, <em>viz</em>., <strong>पचे</strong> for <strong>पचेत्</strong>, and <strong>पचेय्युं</strong>for <strong>पचेयुः</strong>.The <strong>य</strong> is doubled as in<strong>थेय्यं</strong> for <strong>स्तेय</strong> according to a general rule which we have noticedbefore. The singular of this person is also formed by adding <strong>एय्य</strong>made up on the analogy of the plural <strong>एय्यु</strong> and also of such formsas <strong>सुनुयात्</strong>. The final vowel is, however, shortened, but in suchessesas <strong>जानीया</strong>for <strong>जानीयात्</strong> it remains long. This form with thefinal long is used as a base, and the terminations of the firstperson and second person of the Present added to it to form the</p>
<p>corresponding person of the Potential. The Ātmanepada <strong>एथ, एर</strong>,and <strong>एथो</strong> are the same as <strong>एत, एरन्</strong>, and <strong>एथा</strong>: of the Sanskrit <strong>अ</strong>-conjugations, the <strong>त</strong> of <strong>एत</strong> being rendered an aspirate and the <strong>आ</strong> of<strong>एथाः</strong> shortened. The Parasmaipada singular <strong>एयम्</strong> as in <strong>पचेयम्</strong> isadapted for the Ātmanepada in the form <strong>एय्यं</strong> and the plurals ofthe second and first persons are formed by taking <strong>एय्य</strong> as the baseand appending <strong>ध्वम्</strong> corrupted to <strong>व्हो</strong> and <strong>म्हे</strong> of the Present.</p>
<p>In the Imperfect the <strong>आ</strong>and <strong>ऊ</strong> of the third person seem to begeneralized from such forms as <strong>अयात्</strong> and अ<strong>युः</strong>. The termination <strong>उम्</strong>is, as you know, applied in Sanskrit optionally to roots endingin आand necessarily to <strong>विद्</strong>and such as are reduplicated. The<strong>आ</strong> of the singular, however, may be considered as due to thelengthening of the previous अof such Sanskrit forms of the<strong>अ</strong>-conjugations as <strong>अपचत्</strong>, when the final consonant was dropped.This lengthening was brought about by the forcible pronunciationof the <strong>अ</strong> rendered necessary in Sanskrit by the final consonant.The second person singular is <strong>ओ</strong>, which corresponds to theSanskrit <strong>अः</strong>, and <strong>अ</strong> of the first person singular to the <strong>अम्</strong> with thenasal dropped. The Ātmanepada second person singulari <strong>से</strong> istransferred from the Present, <strong>व्हं</strong> is <strong>ध्वम्,</strong> and <strong>इ</strong> is generalized fromthe forms of the non-<strong>अ</strong>-conjugations, such as <strong>अलुनि, अददि</strong>, &amp;c. ThePerfect has preserved the third person singular <strong>अ</strong> and plural <strong>उ</strong>and the first person singular <strong>अ</strong>, of the Parasmaipada; and <strong>रे</strong> ofthe Ātmanepada. Of the rest, <strong>ए</strong> second person singular Parasmaipada is perhaps the <strong>ए</strong> of the Sanskrit Ātmanepada singular of thefirst and third persons; and the <strong>इ</strong> of the Ātmanepada is transferredfrom the Imperfect.</p>
<p>In the Aorist the third person singular <strong>ई</strong>is the termination ofthe fifth form of the Sanskrit Aorist with the final <strong>त्</strong>dropped asusual; and the plural <strong>उं</strong> is generalized from such forms as <strong>अस्थुः</strong>,Some roots, such as <strong>भू</strong> and <strong>कः</strong> have far <strong>सि</strong> for the singular as <strong>अहोसि</strong>,and <strong>अकासि</strong>, the <strong>सि</strong>of which is to be traced to <strong>सांत्</strong>. Another pluraltermination is <strong>इसु</strong> in which we can recognize the Sanskrit <strong>इषुः</strong>. Thesecond person singular <strong>ओ</strong> is from the <strong>अम्</strong> of the second Aorist;and the first person singular is <strong>इं</strong> resulting from the fusion of theaugment <strong>इ</strong> with the <strong>अम्</strong> of the second Aorist. The third personsingular and plural and the first person singular of the Ātmanepada are the same as the corresponding ones of the ParasmaipadaImperfect, both numbers of the second person are the same as thecorresponding Ātmanepada of the Imperfect, and the <strong>म्हे</strong> of thefirst person plural is transferred from the Present.</p>
<p>The terminations of the Second Future are made up as inSanskrit by prefixing <strong>स्स = स्य</strong>to those of the Present. The Ātmanepada first person singular has however <strong>स्सं</strong> instead of <strong>स्से</strong>. Inone instance, <em>viz</em>., <strong>होहिति, होहिन्ति</strong>from <strong>हो</strong>, the <strong>स्स</strong> is corrupted to <strong>इ</strong>.In the Conditional terminations the <strong>स्स</strong> occurs everywhere, butthe other portions are transferred from other tenses. The ending <strong>आ</strong>of the third person singular <strong>स्सा</strong> is of course the <strong>आ</strong> of theImperfect; the <strong>अंसु</strong> of the plural has been transferred from theAorist, Imperfect, or Potential; the <strong>से</strong> and <strong>थ</strong> of <strong>स्से</strong> and <strong>स्सथ</strong> arebrought over from the Ātmanepada and Parasmaipada of thePresent; <strong>स्सं</strong> is <strong>स्यम्</strong>, and the <strong>म्हा</strong> of <strong>स्तम्हा</strong> the plural is from theImperfect. In Sanskrit, the short terminations of the Imperfect and other tenses are added to the <strong>स्य</strong> in the Conditional;but herethere is a mixture of both the short and the long, and also of thetwo Padas. We find the same mixture in the Ātmanepada.</p>
<p>It will thus appear that the Present and Future have preservedmost of the Sanskrit terminations, and the other tenses only abouttwo or three. Besides the terminations that have thus been preserved or transferred by analogy from one tense to another, thereare others which cannot be thus explained. Such are <strong>म्हे</strong> Ātmanepada first person plural of the Present; <strong>त्थ</strong> and <strong>म्ह</strong> of the Parasmaipada second and first person plural, and <strong>त्थ</strong> third person singular. <strong>त्थो</strong>second person singular and <strong>म्हे</strong> first person plural of the Ātmanepada of the Perfect; <strong>त्थ</strong>second person plural and <strong>म्हां</strong> first personplural Parasmaipada, and <strong>त्थ</strong> and <strong>त्थुं</strong>third person singular andplural and <strong>म्हसे</strong> first person plural Ātmanepada, of the Imperfect;<strong>त्थ</strong> second person plural and <strong>म्हा</strong> first person plural Parasmaipadaof the Aorist, and <strong>म्हे</strong> first person plural of the Ātmanepada of thesame; <strong>म्हे</strong> first person plural Ātmanepada of the Future;and <strong>ह्मा</strong>Parasmaipada and <strong>म्हसे</strong> Ātmanepada of the first person of the Conditional. These are unquestionably forms of the root <strong>अम्</strong>tackedon to the base in the particular tenses when the old terminationswere forgotten, or some of them may be traced directly to the terminations of the Sanskrit Aorist, <strong>स्त, स्थाः</strong>and <strong>स्म</strong>, which themselves,</p>
<p>as you know, are forms of <strong>अम्</strong>. Of these, the Parasmaipadasecond person plural is <strong>त्थ</strong> to be traced to the correspondingSanskrit <strong>स्य</strong> of the Present of <strong>अम्</strong> and <strong>म्ह</strong> and <strong>म्हा</strong> first person pluralto the <strong>स्म</strong>of <strong>आस्म</strong>of the Imperfect and <strong>स्मः</strong> of the Present respectively. The penultimate <strong>अ</strong> of स्मःis lengthened for the same reasonas that of <strong>अपचत्</strong> is in forming <strong>अपचा</strong>. The Ātmanepada <strong>त्थो</strong>of thesecond singular comes from the <strong>स्थाः</strong>of <strong>आस्थाः</strong>of the Imperfect, <strong>त्थ</strong>third person singular, from the <strong>स्त</strong> of <strong>अस्त</strong>of the same; and <strong>म्हे</strong>and<strong>ह्यसे</strong> first person plural are to be referred to such Ātmanepadaforms as <strong>स्मे</strong> and <strong>स्मसे</strong>. Of the last two, <strong>स्मे</strong> appears to be a newformation form <strong>स्म</strong>, and <strong>स्मसे</strong> is the old Vedic archetype of <strong>स्महे</strong>.</p>
<p>You will thus see that when the original Sanskrit forms wereforgotten, new ones corresponding to them were constructed in thePali, not only by the use of false analogies, but also by taking oneform distinctively expressive of the sense of a particular mood ortense as a base, and appending first only the personal terminationsof the Present, as in the case of the Potential; and secondly, theforms of the root <strong>अम्</strong>. You will hereafter find that the modernvernaculars have resorted to one at least of these two modes of reconstruction; and similarly, the beginnings in the Pali of a modeof constructing new case-forms widely prevalent in the moderndialects was brought to your notice before; so that the spirit orturn of mind which has been in operation in the formation of thevernacular speech of the country, has been the same since veryremote times.</p>
<p>The terminations with an initial consonant are in the generaltenses appended through the intervention of the vowel <strong>ह</strong>; but insome cases there are forms directly corrupted from Sanskrit; as<strong>दक्खति</strong> Sanskrit <strong>द्रक्ष्यति, मोक्खति = मोक्ष्यति</strong>. The temporal augment <strong>अ</strong>is often omitted, as <strong>गमा</strong> or <strong>अगमा, गमी</strong> Or <strong>अगमी, गमिस्सा</strong> or <strong>अगमिस्सा</strong>.The several varieties of the Aorist, and the many special forms ofthe Perfect, have for the most part gone out of use. The Passiveis formed by the addition of <strong>य</strong> as in Sanskrit, sometimes with theaugiment <strong>इ</strong>, sometimes without, in which last case the conjunctconsonant is corrupted according to the prevailing rules; as<strong>बुज्झियते, पच्चते, लब्भते, करियते</strong>.The forms in a good many cases arethe same in Sankrit, only phonetically altered; as <strong>थीयते, उच्चसे, इज्जते</strong>in which cases we see the that the <strong>आ</strong>of <strong>स्था</strong>is changed to <strong>ई</strong>, and</p>
<p><strong>वच्</strong> and <strong>यज्</strong> under Samprasāraṇa. The causal is formed by adding<strong>आपे</strong> or <strong>आपय</strong> and <strong>ए</strong> or <strong>आय</strong>; as <strong>कारापेति</strong> or <strong>कारापयति</strong> and <strong>कारेति</strong> or <strong>कारप</strong>ति.These forms I have already explained. The Past Passive Participle is formed as in Sanskrit, and in many cases the forms are thesame. The Absolutive is formed by using the terminations <strong>तून,त्वान</strong>, and <strong>त्वा</strong>. The first is the same as the second, the semivowel <strong>क</strong>having only undergone Samprasāraṇa; and they are to be tracedto such Vedic forms as <strong>इष्ट्वीन, कृत्वान</strong> &amp;c., which have disappearedin Classical Sanskrit. The Infinitive is formed by adding <strong>तुं</strong> as inSanskrit, or <strong>तवे</strong>which, I have already observed, is one of the manyways in which the Vedio Infinitive is formed. It has becomeobsolete in the later Sanskrit.</p>
<p>Now if the Pali grew up naturally in the manner I have described, it could not come to possess the several grammatical formsit exhibits unless they were in use in Sankrit at the time when itbranched off. It has, as we have seen, preserved eight of the tenTenses and Moods, whence it follows that verbal forms of thesewere then currant in the language. Pali therefore represents.iddle Sanskrit or the usage that prevailed during the periodbetween the composition of the Brāhmaṇas and Yāska or Pāṇiniand must have begun to be formed during that period. We shallhereafter find that latter Prakrits represent the third stage in thedevelopment of the Sanskrit that in which a good many of theverbal forms ceased to be used; and thus bear to what I havecalled classical Sanskrit the same relation that the Pali does toMiddle Sanskrit.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>We will now proceed to consider those valuable specimens ofthe ancient languages of the country which have been preserved inInscriptions. The most important of these are the edicts of Aśoka,the pious king of Pāṭaliputra in Magadha, the modern Behar, whoflourished in the middle of the third century before Christ. Theseedicts contain the king&rsquo;s religious and moral injunctions to his subjects, and set forth his own ideas. belief, and conduct in thesematters Five different versions of them have been discovered,inscribed on rocks in different parts of the country. There is oneat Girnar, near Jungad in Kathiawar, another at Dhauli in</p>
<p>Kattak, and a third at Kapurdigiri or Śahbazgarhi in Afghanistan.These have been published and examined. The Girnar versionhas been copied several times, but the other two only once, andhence there are a good many imperfections in our existing copiesof them. Another version has recently been discovered atJaugad near Ganjam, in the Northern Circars, and copied by aMadras Civilian. It is unfortunately greatly mutilated, notmore than two of the fourteen edicts being found complete,and but a few words left of some. The fifth has recently beendiscovered by General Cunningham at Khalsi, near Masuri inthe Himalayas, and has not yet been published</p>
<p>^(*)</p>
<p>. Other edictsof the same king are found inscribed on columns which oxist atDelhi, Allahabad, and other places. At Dhauli and Ganjam thereexist, along with the edicts mentioned above, others whichanswer to these. Another Inscription of Aśoka has been found atBabhra in Rajputana, which consists of a letter to the Buddhistcongregation.</p>
<p>These Inscriptions are in three different dialects, closelyrelated to each other. The Girnar dialect is very much like thePali. That of the Dhauli, Ganjam, and Khalsi versions presentspeculiarities which are found in a later Prakrit called Māgadhiby the grammarians. Such are the substitution of <strong>ल्</strong> for <strong>र्, ए</strong> forthe <strong>ओ</strong> of the nominative singular of masculine nouns in <strong>अ, मिं</strong>the termination of the locative instead of the Pali <strong>म्हि</strong>, and <strong>हकस्</strong>for <strong>अहम्</strong>. The Babhra and the column inscriptions are also inthis dialect.The Śahbazgarhi recensionadmits of some conjuncts such as <strong>प्र</strong>, and the sibilants <strong>श्</strong> and <strong>ष्</strong> which in the othersand in Pali are changed to <strong>स्</strong>. But it is a question whether theseare dialectic peculiarities, or are to be attributed to a confusionof the vernacular with Sanskrit. I will now place before youshort specimens of these dialects.</p>

<p>Published since in Corp. Inso, A sixth version existing nt Mansherainthe Panjab was discovered after the above was published. I have made usoof the latest readings of the versions.</p>

<p><strong>अतिक्रान्तमन्तरं राजानो विहारयात्रां निरयासिषुः । अत्र मृगयान्यानि चैतादृशान्यभिरामकाण्यभूवन । स देवानांप्रियः प्रियदर्शी राजा दशवर्षाभिषिक्तः सन्नयासीत्संबोधिम् ।तेनैषा धर्मयात्रा । अत्रेदं भवति ब्राह्मणश्रमणानां दर्शनं च दानं च स्थविराणां दर्शनं चहिरण्यप्रतिविधानं च जानपदस्य च जनस्प दर्शनं धर्मानुशास्तिश्चधर्मपरिपृच्छा च ।तदोपर्यादेषा भूयोरतिर्भवति देवानां प्रियस्यप्रियदर्शिनो राज्ञो भागेन्यस्मिन् ।</strong></p>
<p>Translation:—</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some time ago kings went on pleasure excursions. Huntingand such others were the diversions here. But Priyadarśin, thefavourite of the gods, began the search of enlightenment when hehad been a crowned monarch for ten years. Hence this excursion(course) of righteousness. It consists of this, <em>viz.</em> seeing Brāhmaṇas and Śramaṇas, and bestowing gifts, seeing the religiouselders and presenting gold, and seeing country-people and givinginstruction in righteousness and in the investigation of the law.Since that time king Priyadarśin has been taking great delightin the glories of the next world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is not usual in these inscriptions to mark the double orassimilated consonants. Hence we do not find them here exceptin the case of double nasals which are indicated by an anusvārafollowed by the nasal. There is, as in Pali, no other phoneticchange; <strong>प्रति</strong> we see becomes <strong>पटि</strong> and <strong>भू</strong> becomes optionally <strong>द्रू</strong>; andराजानो the nominative plural, <strong>राञो</strong> for <strong>राञ्ञो</strong> the genitive singular,<strong>सन्तो</strong> the nominative singular, and all other cases are just likethose in that dialect. We have the Aorist forms ending in ananusvära followed by <strong>सु</strong>, as in Pali. But there are some differences; <strong>एतारिस</strong> is <strong>एतादिस</strong> in Pali as it is in the other recensionsof this same inscription, <strong>अहुंसु</strong> is <strong>अहेंसु</strong>, though <strong>अहुंसु</strong>agrees withthe rules of Pali grammar and must have existed in the language;the <strong>ऐ</strong> of<strong>थैराणं</strong> is opposed to Pali usage, but the engraver mayhave committed a mistake; <strong>त्रेयासु</strong> is for <strong>निय्यासु</strong>, <strong>इ</strong> being changedto <strong>ए</strong>before the conjunct according to the rule we have noticed.<strong>बाम्हण</strong> is <strong>ब्राह्मण</strong> in Pall; but the inscription perhaps represents theprevailing usage more correctly; and the is lengthened in <strong>राञो</strong>probably through mistake. There are thus very few cases of realdifference, and though they might be considered to point to a</p>
<p>dialectical variety of the nature of those we find in the differentversions of the edicts, still the language is in the same stage ofgrowth as the Pali.</p>
<p>The following is the Dhauli version collated with that atKhalsi and completed :—</p>

<p>We here observe the varieties mentioned before, the changeof <strong>र्</strong> to <strong>ल्</strong> and the nominative in <strong>ए</strong>. We also see <strong>निखमिसु</strong>for<strong>त्रेयासु एदिसनि</strong>for <strong>एतारिसानि, बुधानं</strong> or <strong>बुढानं</strong> <strong>(=वृद्धानां)</strong> for <strong>थैरांन</strong> and <strong>बंभन</strong>or <strong>बाभन</strong> for <strong>ब्राह्मण</strong>. So then here we have another dialect.</p>
<p>Kapurdigiri or Śahbazgarhi version:—</p>
<p><strong>अतिक्रंतं अंतरं देवनंप्रिय विहरयत्र नम निकमिषु अत्र म्रुगय अञनि च हेदिशानिअमिरमनि अभवसु सो देवनंप्रिय प्रियद्रसि रज दशवषभिसितो सतो निक्रमि संबोधिंतेनदं ध्रमवत्र अत्रइयं होतिश्रमणब्रमणनं द्रशनेदनं &amp;c.</strong></p>
<p>Here we have the conjuncts <strong>प्रि, त्रा, ब्र,</strong>&amp;c, and the three Sanskritsibilants; and also <strong>होदिशनि</strong> for <strong>ईदृशानि</strong>.</p>
<p>The reason why we have not one same version at all the threeplaces must be that it was the intention of the king to publish theedicts in the dialect of each particular place. The Dhauli-Khalsidialect is as observed before, used in the column inscriptions, andalso in that found at Babhra. The king&rsquo;s predilection for it canbe plausibly accounted for only on the supposition that it was hisown native tongue. If so, this dialect must have prevailed inMagadha, which country was under his immediate rule, and thecapital of which was Pāṭaliputra, where he reigned. And thisaccounts for the fact that it is used in the inscriptions at Dhauliand Ganjam, since they are situated in the contiguous country.One peculiarity of this language, <em>viz.</em> the nominative singular ofnouns in stending in g is met with even in the Girnar recension,</p>
<p>which may be explained by the supposition that the edicts weredrawn up first in the king&rsquo;s dialect but were translated into thedialect of each province, the translation however being notexecuted carefully enough to expunge all peculiarities of theoriginal draft. It would thus appear that the grammarians of thelater languages had more solid grounds than mere fancy forcalling that Prakrit which bears close resemblance to this languageby the name of Māgadhi. Here then we find specimens of threedialects provalent in three widely distant provinces; but weshould bear in mind that the difference between them is small,while in the languages that are spoken in these countries at thepresent day it is so great as to make it difficult for the natives ofone province to understand those of another.</p>
<p>In the many other ancient monuments existing in the countrywe often find inscriptions which are principally in two languages,the Sanskrit and the Pali or Prakrit, understanding by this termsimply a dialect derived from the Sanskrit, Those in the latter(Pali) are mostly connected with Buddhism; though some Buddhistic inscriptions also, such as those discovered by GeneralCunningham at Mathura several years ago, are in Sanskrit.In the caves at Kanheri, Nasik, Junnar, Nanaghat, Karla,and some other places in this Presidency, and in the Bhilsatopes, we have Pali or Prakrit inscriptions. Most of these areshort, but at Nasik we have long ones, in the onves of Uṣavadāta,and Gotamīputra. The language of these latter is Pali; and buta few forms are peculiar, such as <strong>दत्त</strong> and <strong>कित</strong> for which the Pali has <strong>दिण्ण</strong> and <strong>कत</strong>, Past Passive Participles of <strong>दा</strong>and <strong>कृ</strong>; and <strong>वे</strong> forthe numeral two, the Pali form being <strong>द्वे</strong> or <strong>दुवे</strong>. In Uṣavadāta&rsquo;scaves we have one inscription entirely in Sanskrit, the rest arein Pali or Prakrit, but we have an intermixture of Sanskritwords, and the conjuncts <strong>प्र, त्र</strong>, and <strong>क्ष</strong> often appear. In these andsmaller inscriptions we have such words as <strong>वार</strong> for <strong>द्वार, वारसक</strong> for<strong>वार्षिक, वरिस</strong> for <strong>वर्ष,</strong> <strong>उदिस</strong>for <strong>उद्दिश्य</strong>, while the Pali forms of thesewords are <strong>द्वार वस्सिक, वस्स,</strong> and <strong>उद्देसेत्वा</strong>. Some of these inseriptionswere engraved so late as the third century, when the Pali couldhardly have been the vernacular; but it had become the sacred language of the Buddhists; the mendicant priests for whom thecaves were intended and even educated lay members of that persuasion understood it, and hence it was used in these inscriptions as Sanskrit was in others.</p>
<p>The style of Gotamīputra&rsquo;s charters, abounding as it does inlong compounds and elaborate expressions, is very unlike theplain and simple language of Aśoka&rsquo;s edicts. And at the end ofthese and that of his son, we are told that the officers of thesekings who caused the charters to be engraved acted under thecommand, <em>i. e.</em> wrote to the dictation of respected persons whowere the compilers of all such document.&rdquo; It thus appears thatthe Pali was at that time a sacred and a literary language amongthe Buddhists. And as to the language of the other inscriptions,which like those of Gotamīputra and his son were not composedby learned men, one can easily understand how ignorant persons,not knowing Sanskrit or Pali well, but still not ignorant enoughto know nothing of those languages, would confound together.Sanskrit, Pali, and vernacular words. Even in our days we findthe phenomenon in the <em>patrikās</em> or horoscopes written by ourJośis or astrologers, which are neither in pure Sanskrit nor inpure vernacular, but contain a mixture of them both, and theSanskrit words and forms in which are incorrectly written.</p>
<p>And an explanation of this nature I have also to give ofanother variety of language that is found in the writings of theNorthern or Nepalese Buddhists. These unlike those of theCeylonese and Burmese Buddhists are written in Sanskrit, but in such works as the Lalitavistāra or the life of Buddha we find,along with prose passages in pure Sanskrit, a number of verseswhich contain words or forms which are not Sanskrit. Thus, forinstance, we have:—</p>
<p>सर्वशुंभकर्महेतोःफलमिदं शृणुतास्यकर्मस्प<br>
पूजारहो भवितुं सर्वजगे अनुबन्धत इममनन्तयशं॥</p>
<p>You will here see that <strong>कर्मस्य, जगे</strong>,and <strong>यशं</strong>are as in the Pali treated like nouns in <strong>अ,</strong> <strong>अर्ह</strong>is dissolved into <strong>अरह</strong>, and there are afew other instances of this process, such as <strong>किलेश</strong>for <strong>क्लेश, शिरि,</strong> for<strong>श्री, हिरि</strong>for <strong>ष्ट्री</strong>&amp;c. but that generally the conjunct consonants areretained as they are in Sanskrit, and not assimilated. So alsoyou have <strong>चोदेन्ति</strong> for <strong>चोदयन्ति मायाय</strong> genitive singular of <strong>माया,उपजनित्या शुणिष्यति, निरीक्षथ</strong>;Imperative second person plural, <strong>शमेथ</strong>for <strong>शमयत</strong>, &amp;c., and even such words as <strong>मनाप</strong> which are Pali in</p>
<p>every respect. But along with these there are other peculiaritioswhich must be attributed simply to carelessness. For instance,the case terminations are often omitted, a thing never done eitherin Sanskrit or Pali, as <strong>काम सेविति</strong> for <strong>कामंसेवते, सुगत</strong> for <strong>सुगतं</strong> whengoverned by <strong>पूजयितुं मोक्ष भोष्यति</strong> for <strong>मोक्षो भविष्यति</strong>, &amp;c. Such constructions as <strong>क्षान्त्या सोरभ्यसम्पन्नाः</strong> for <strong>क्षान्तिसोरभ्यसंपन्नाःशीलसमाधि तथाप्रज्ञमयं</strong> for <strong>शीलसमाधिमज्ञामयं,</strong> are often to be met with.</p>
<p>This language has therefore no fixed characteristics at all. Wehave seen that in such words as <strong>कर्म, जग</strong> and <strong>यश</strong> above, the finalconsonant is dropped, and these as in Pali and Prakrit madenouns in अ. But <strong>यशस्</strong>is used in the Sanskrit form also, as <strong>कीर्तिर्यशश्च</strong>;and there are instances in which other final consonants arepreserved. Along with such a form as <strong>शुणिष्यति</strong> noted above,which is constructed on the same principle as the Pali <strong>मुणिस्सति</strong>,such a Sanskrit one as <strong>शृण्वन्ति</strong> is found. It therefore appears tome that this is not an independent language; but that the writersof the Gāthās knew the spoken language or Pali, and that theywere imperfectly acquainted with Sanskrit, knowing enough ofit to see that the assimilation of consonants was a vulgarity, butnot acquainted with its grammar. They intended to write in themore polished or literary language, but not knowing it well, oftenused unconsciously the grammatical forms and the peculiarwords of the vernacular. At the time when the Gāthās werewritten the claims of the Pali to be considered a separate languagewore probably not recognised, and it constituted the speech of theuninstructed. Those who in this condition of things wished towrite, could not think of doing so in that form of speech, andtherefore wrote in what they considered the language of educatedmen but they know it imperfectly, and produced such a heterogeneous compound as we have seen.</p>
<p><strong>LECTURE III.</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE PRAKRITS AND THE APABHRAṀŚA.</strong></p>
<p>On the last occasion we examined the language of the sacredbooks of the Southern Buddhists and found that a large portionof the words it contains are pure Sanskrit and the rest areSanskrit words corrupted or transformed according to certain lawsof phonetic decay. Then by the law of false analogy the lessused and less known declensional and conjugational forms havebeen in many cases brought over to the type of those more usedin Sanskrit and consequently better known. So that in the vocabulary and the grammar, the laws of growth I traced in the opening lecture are in operation, but their range is limited, and thedialect is in what may be called the first stage of departure fromSanskrit. We then examined the language of the Inscriptions ofAśoka and found that it is either the same as Pali or in the same stage of development, and that there existed in those times two orthree varieties of speech slightly differing from each other. Today I propose to examine certain other dialects which echibit amuch greater departure from the parent tongue. These are theso-called Prakrits. For a knowledge of these languages we havenot to go beyond India, as in the case of the one we have examined. Prakrit dialects possessed a literature and a portion of it hascome down to us.</p>
<p><strong>THE PRAKRITS.</strong></p>
<p>There exist about six treatises on Prakrit grammar, the mostancient of which is Vararuci&rsquo;s Prākṛtaprakāśa. Next comesHemacandra, a Jaina scholar of Gujarat, who lived in the twelfthcentury. His work on grammar is known by the name of<em>Haimavyākaraṇa</em>, the eight chapter of which he devotes to thegrammar of the Prakrits. Hemacandra&rsquo;s treatment of thesedialects is fuller than Vararuci&rsquo;s; and his observation was wider. He shows a very intimate knowledge of the existing literature ofthese languages, both sacred and profane, Jaina or Brahmanical.His work, and especially the last portion, is full of quotations. Hemust have availed himself of the labours of former scholars, since</p>
<p>he often mentions <em>Pūrvācāryas</em>. Hemacandra also wrote a <em>Koṣa</em>or thesaurus of the Deśīwords existing in these languages. Vararuci gives the grammar of four dialects, which he calls.Mahārāṣṭrī, Śauraseni, Māgadhi, and Paiśāicī. The names of thefirst three themselves would show that they were the languagesspoken or used in the provinces from the names of which theyare derived, but doubts have been raised as to their genuineness,which will be hereafter considered. The Mahārāṣṭrī is called theprincipal Prakrit. For instance, Daṇḍin in his Kāvyādarśa says-</p>
<p>&ldquo;The language prevalent in Mahārāṣṭra they regard as thePrākṛta pre-eminent; it is the ocean of jewels in the shape ofgood literary works, and the Setubandha and others are writtenin it¹.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vararuci devotes the first nine chapters of his work to theMahārāṣṭrī, and then a chapter each to the rest. The peculiarities only of the latter dialects and their differences from theMahārāṣṭrī are given, and in other respects they are to be considered similar to the first. Hemacandra follows the samemethod; but he does not mention the name Mahārāṣṭrī and speaksof the dialect only as the Prakrit. These grammarians and allothers who have written on the subject treat of the grammar ofthe language etymologically. They take Sanskrit as the originallanguage or <em>prakṛti</em> and give rules about the various phoneticaland grammatical changes which have reduced Sanskrit to thePrakrit form. The Pali grammarian Kaccāyanatreats thedialect not as one derived from Sanskrit as these writers do, butas an independent language, though it is very probable he knewSanskrit, since he uses Sanskrit grammatical terms, and hisSūtras greatly resemble those in the Kātantra and even Päṇini.Vararuci and Hemacandra derive Śaurasenīalso from theSanskrit as they do the Mahārāṣṭrī or the principal Prakrit, butmake the Śaurasenīthe Prakrti or basis of the Magadhi and thePaiśāci. This appears to be the tradition; whence it would seemthat older and more developed language or the language of respectable people was the Saurasent, and the other two were thedialects of border countries used by persons in a lower scale ofsociety. They have some of the peculiarities of the Śaurasenī,and come nearer to it than to the Mahārāṣṭrī. Hemacandra givesthe grammar of two more dialects, the Cülikä Paiśäciand theApabhraṁśa, the latter of which was according to Daṇḍin, thelanguage of Ābhīras (cowherds) and others. Another grammarian of the name of Trivikramo gives in his Prākṛtasūtravṛttithe grammar of these six dialects. He lived after Hemacandra,since he mentions him in the introduction to his work,and his book resembles Hemacandra&rsquo;s a good deal. There isanother work by Candra called Ṣaḍbhāṣācandrikāwhich is ameagre production. Another still of the same nature, the authorof which is Lakṣmīdhara, mentions the same six dialects: so that the expression Ṣaḍbhāṣāseems to have become proverbial.</p>

<p>1. <strong>महाराष्ट्राश्रयां भाषां प्रकृष्टं प्राकृतं विदुः।<br>
सागरः सूक्तिरत्नानां सेतुबन्धादि यन्मयम्॥</strong></p>
<p>The Mahārāṣṭrīderived its importance from its literature.From the manner in which Daṇḍin speaks of that literature it appears to have been very extensive and valuable. He himselfmentions one work, the Setubandha, a poem attributed to Kālidāsabut written by one Pravarasens, whose &ldquo;fame,&rdquo; Bāṇa says in hisHarṣacarita,&rdquo; reached the other side of the ocean by means of theSetu.&rdquo; I find in a Ms. in the colophon at the end of each āśvāsaor canto, sometimes <strong>इअ सिरीपवरसेणविरहए दहमुहवहे</strong>(thus in the Daśamukhavadha composed by the prosperous Pravarasena), and sometimes, <strong>इअ परवसेनविरइए कालिदासकर दहमुवहेह</strong> (thus in the Daśamukhavadhu, the work of Kālidāsa, composed by Pravarasena). Somekings of Kaśmir bore the name of Pravarasena, but there is nothingto show that any one of them was the poet who wrote this work.There is a collection of seven hundred songs, chiefly of anamorous nature, by a poet of the name of Hale, which is calledthe Saptaśatī. We have an edition of this in Roman charactersby Prof. Weber. Another long poem entitled the Gauḍavadhakāvya by a poet named Vākpatirāja, who lived at the court ofYaśovarman, king of Kanoj, in the early part of the eighth century,was discovered by Dr. Būhler about three years ago. And severalother works may turn up, if diligent search is made for them.The Kävyaprakāśa contains about 75 Prakrit verses quoted toillustrate the rules laid down by the author, and Śā</p>
<p>rṅgadharaalso gives a good many in his Paddhati.</p>
<p>The religious books of the Jainas form another very extensive</p>
<p>branch of Prakrit literature. Prof. Weber thinks the language ofthese to be later than the Pali and earlier than the Prakrits, so asto occupy a middle position, and calls it Jaina-Māgadhī. ButHemacandra himself, who must have known his religious bookswell, and was, as I have observed, a great Prakrit scholar, treatsit as the principal Prakrit or</p>
<p>।</p>
<p>, and in his grammar ofthis he in several places gives forms of words peculiar to hissacred language, which after the example of his Brahmanicbrothers he calls Ārṣa Prākṛta¹. In giving his first rule aboutthe Māgadhī dialect, <em>viz.</em>, that the nom. sing. of Masc. nouns takesthe termination <strong>ए</strong>, he says:— &ldquo;As to what the fathers have saidabout the Ārṣa (works) being composed in the Ardha-Māgadhīdialect in such words as these: the ancient Sūtra is composed inthe Ardha-Māgadhī dialect&rsquo;, they have said so in consequence ofthe observance of this rule and not of those that follow². Thus ifone chooses to call the sacred language of the Jainas Ardha-Māgadhī on account of this Māgadhī peculiarity and a few otherarchaisms, one may do so; and I shall presently have to observethat the great many dialects which writers on poetics give, differedfrom each other in such insignificant particulars only. But it isclear that Hemacandra considers the distinction to be slight, andidentifies the dialect with the principal Prakrit; and both he andthe Jaina fathers refer it to the class of the Prakrits of thegrammarians³.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1. आर्षम् । ३ । ऋषीणामिदमार्षम् ।आर्षे प्राकृतं बहुलं भवति । तदपि यथास्थानं दर्शयिष्यामः । आर्षे हि सर्वे विधयो विकल्प्यन्ते । He hasalso said before, that therules he is going to give even with regard to the ordinary Prakrit shouldnot be considered universal.</p>
<p>2. यदपि पोराणमद्धमागहमासानिययंहवइ सुत्तमित्यादिनार्षस्यार्धमागधभाषानियतत्वमाम्नायि वृद्धैस्तदपि प्रायोस्यैव विधानाम्नवक्ष्यमाणलक्षणस्य ।</p>
<p>3**.** The only specific grounds one can find in Prof. Weber&rsquo;s book in support ofthe assertion that the Jaina dialect occupies a middle position are these :—1. That uninitial <strong>क्, ग, च्, ज्, त्, द्</strong>and other consonants are dropped in theMahārāṣṭrīleaving only the vowel, and preserved or softened in the Pali,while in the Jaina books <strong>य्</strong> is substituted for them; <em>i. e,</em> the differentstages of phonetic corruption in this case are, the consonants in theiroriginal or softened forms, then for them, and lastly their clision. 2. That<strong>न्</strong> is preserved in the Pali, and changed every where to <strong>ण्ण्</strong>in the ।;while in the Jaina dialect initial <strong>न्</strong> remains unchanged except in enclytics.3. That the loc, sing. of nouns in <strong>अ</strong>ends in <strong>सिं</strong>or <strong>सि</strong>which we find in the</p>
<p>But it is in the dramatic plays that we find these dialectsprincipally used. Writers on Poetics prescribe that a particulardramatic person should speak a particular dialect. Sanskrit isassigned to respectable men of education, and women in holyorders; Śaurasenī, to respectable ladies in their prose speeches,and the Mahārāṣṭrīor the principal Prakrit, in the songs or versesput into their mouths. Śaurasenīis also assigned to inferiorcharacters; and the Māgadhīand Paiśācīto very low persons.The general rule is that a dramatic person should speak thelanguage of the country to which he or she is supposed to belong.Later writers give more minute rules. For instance, the authorof the Sāhityadarpaṇa assigns Māgadhī to the attendants in theroyal seraglio, Ardhamāgadhīto footmen, royal children, and</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>language of the column inscriptions; while it is <strong>स्मि</strong> and <strong>म्हि</strong>in the Pali and<strong>म्मि</strong> in the Prakrit.</p>
<p>Now as to the first, the <strong>य्</strong> is not prior to the elision, but contemporaneousor subsequent to it, being found even in the modern vernaculars. It wasintroduced simply to facilitate pronunciation; <em>i. e,</em> it is a strengthenedform of the vowel. Thus the Prakrit of <strong>पाद</strong> foot is <strong>पाअ</strong>, but in Marathi wehave <strong>पाय</strong>; so<strong>राजन्</strong> Skr.,<strong>राअ</strong>Pr.,<strong>राय</strong> II.; <strong>सोदर</strong> Skr., <strong>सोअर</strong> Pr.,<strong>सोयरा</strong>M., &amp;c. &amp;c. The <strong>य्</strong> occurs not only in Jainn books, but everywhere, *e. g.*in the Gauḍavadhakāvya (see below); and Hemacandra does tell us in hisSūtra <strong>अवर्णो यश्रुतिः</strong>that the <strong>अ</strong>that remains after the elision of a consonant is pronounced like a soft <strong>य</strong>. With regard to the second, initial <strong>न्</strong>isfound unchanged in the Gauḍavadha in a great many places. Thus instanza 242 we have the negative particle <strong>न</strong>, in 241 <strong>निवडइ</strong> for <strong>निपतति</strong>, in245 <strong>नाह</strong> for <strong>नाथ</strong>, and in 251 <strong>नह</strong> for <strong>नख</strong>. These instances I have found onsimply opening the Ms. at random and no grent search was necessary.Hemscandra also in his Sūtra <strong>वादौ</strong>following another, <strong>नो णः</strong>,says thatthe initial <strong>न्</strong> is sometimes changed to <strong>ण्</strong>, sometimes not. As to the third,the termination <strong>सिं</strong>may constitute a peculiarity of the language, butit is by no means au index to its higher antiquity, since it occurs in thepronominal locative of the principal Prakrit. There are several peculiaritios in the Jainn books, and a good many of them are noticed by ourGrammarian, but they do not show an earlier stage of development.</p>
<p>This continues still to be my view, notwithstanding all that has sincebeen published on the subject. Dr. Hoernle, in the introduction to hisedition of Caṇḍa&rsquo;s Prākṛtalakṣaṇamakes an elaborate attempt to provethat the dialect, the grammar of which is given in that book, is more ancient than the Prakrit of Vararnci and Homacandra. But it is not at alldifficult to see that he is altogether on a wrong track. He says there is</p>
<p>merchants, Prācyāto the Vidūṣaka and others, Āvantikītosharpers, warriors, and clever men of the world, Dākṣiṇātyātogamblers, Śākāri to Śakāras. Śakas, and others, Bāhlikāto celestialpersons, Drāviḍīto Draviḍas and others, Ābhirīto cowherds,Cāṇḍalīkīto outcastes, Ābhirīand Śābarī, also to those who livehy selling wood and leaves, and Paiśācīto dealers in charcoal.Hand-maids, if they do not belong to a very low class, shouldspeak Śaurasenrī. Some of the modern grammarians also mentionas large a number of dialects. But whether these were actuallyused by writers of dramatic plays in accordance with the rules ofRhetoricians, or, if they were, what constituted the exact difference between these various languages, it is impossible to determine so long as we have not got satisfactory editions of the plays.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>nothing in Hemacandra corresponding to the rule given by Caṇḍa aboutdropping the final vowel of the first member of a compound when theinitial vowel of the second is followed by a consonant, in such words as<em>dhana</em>+ā<em>ḍhya, deva + indra</em>,. &amp;c.,which in that Prakrit have the forms<em>dhanaḍḍha, devinda,</em> &amp;c. This change, however, does come undor Hemacandra&rsquo;s rule I. 84, which provides for the shortening of a long vowelwhen followed by a conjunct consonant. The short vowels corresponding to<strong>ए</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong> are <strong>इ</strong>and <strong>उ</strong>; grand among the instances given by Hemacandra, wehave <em>narindo</em> for <em>narendra</em>, <em>aburuṭṭha</em> for <em>adharoṣṭha</em>, <em>nïluppala</em> for <em>nïlotpala</em> &amp;c. Dr. Hoernle thinks the changes of <em>i</em> to short <em>e</em> and of <em>u</em> to short <em>o</em>are later Prakrit changes. But he will find many instances of them in thePaliwhich certainly is an older dialect than any JainaPrakrit. Theyare, he says, unknown to Caṇḍa. Caṇḍa&rsquo;s work is a very meagre production,in which very little endeavour is made to classify faces; and thus bemust be supposed to include these changes under his very general rule that<em>one vowel takes the place of another vowel</em>(II. 4). The instance <em>giṇhati</em>incidentally given by him in connection with another rule does not showthat in his Prakrit the form <em>geṇha</em> did not exist. much less that the changeof <em>i</em> to <em>e</em> was unknown. Then with regard to consonants. Dr. Hoernle saysthat there are five points in which the &ldquo;older Prakrit&rdquo; of Caṇḍa, as he callsit. differs from the Prakrit of Vararuci and Hemacoudra. One of these is&quot;the preservation of the dental <em>n</em> in overy ease.&rdquo; For this statement theDoctor quotes the authority of a Sūtra in which we are told by Caṇḍa that<strong>ङ्</strong> and <strong>ञ्</strong> do not exist in the Prakrit, ns compared with another version ofthat Sūtra which says that <strong>ङ्, न्</strong>,and <strong>ञ्</strong> do not exist (II, 14). This lastversion no doubt provides for the change of <strong>न्</strong> in all cases; but the otherwhich denies the non-existence or affirms the existence of <strong>न्</strong> cannot meanthat it exists or la unchanged in <em>all cases</em>. The denial of non-existence or</p>
<p>Still in those cases in which we have the assistance of the olderPrakrit grammarians, the characteristics of each can be madeout with fulness and certainty. To illustrate his rules about theMāgadhī, Hemacandra quotes from the speeches of the fishermanand the two policemen in Śakuntalä, of the Kṣapaṇaka from theMudrārākṣasa, and Rudhirapriyāfrom the Veṇīsaṁhāra.</p>
<p>The points in which the Māgadhī chiefly differs from theprincipal Prakrit and Śaurasenīare these:—<strong>र्</strong> and <strong>स्</strong> of these arechanged to <strong>ल्</strong> and <strong>श्;स्थ</strong>and <strong>र्थ</strong>of Sanskrit to <strong>स्त</strong>, and <strong>ष्ट</strong> to <strong>स्ट</strong>;and<strong>स्</strong> is not assimilated as in <strong>पस्खलदि</strong>from <strong>प्रस्खलति</strong>, the nom. sing. ofmase. nouns ends in <strong>ए</strong> instead of <strong>ओ</strong>, which is the Prakrit ending;the gen. sing. of masc, and neut. nouns optionally in <strong>आह</strong>as <strong>कम्माहः</strong>;and the form of the nom. sing. of the first personal pronoun is <strong>हगे</strong>.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>affirmation of existence only proves its existence or remaining unchangedin <em>some</em> cases. Besides we have a specific rule where we are told that alatter of the <strong>द्</strong> class takes the place of the corresponding letter of the <strong>त्</strong>class ( III. 16), thus providing for the change of <strong>न्</strong> to <strong>ण्</strong>; and the instancegiven is <strong>धण्णं</strong>for <strong>धान्यम्.</strong> But this rule, the Doctor thinks, holds good incases, for which however there is no authority whatever, and he givesnone. Again, he says that his statement is proved by the uniform spollingof the Prakrit examples with w in MSS A and B, which, necording to himcontain the older version of the work. I, however, find that the spellingin his edition, which is the spelling of A and B, follows uniformly, with oneor two exceptions, in which we must suppose a mistake, the rule laid downby Hemacandra, *viz.,*that initial <em>n</em> is optionally changed to <em>ṇ</em>, whilemedial <em>n</em> is necessarily so changed. The instances are:— all the caseterminations which are to be traced to the Sanskrit terminations having <em>n</em>in them, such as <strong>णो, णि,</strong> and <strong>णं; मुणिणो</strong> for <strong>मुनीम्</strong>(I.1), <strong>गयणओ</strong> for<strong>गगनतः</strong> (I. 16), <strong>मणिस्सा</strong> A. II. 21), <strong>नाणी</strong> (1.24) for <strong>ज्ञानी, सक्कीसाणा</strong> for<strong>शक्रेशानी</strong> ( II 1), <strong>काणं</strong> ( IH. 15), <strong>गयणं</strong> for <strong>गगनम्</strong> (II. 21), <strong>पलिणं</strong> for <strong>पीडनम्</strong>( II. 24), <strong>नाणं</strong> for <strong>ज्ञानम्</strong> ( III. 6), <strong>जुव्वणं</strong>for <strong>यौवनम्</strong>( III. 15) and <strong>रअणं</strong>for <strong>रत्नं</strong> (III. 30). The second point is &ldquo;the preservation of themedial single surd unaspirate consonants with the only exception of <em>k.</em>&ldquo;This simply means the preservation of <em>c, t,</em> and <em>p</em> which according to theother grammarians are <em>generally</em> dropped. Caṇḍa agrees with those indropping not only <em>k</em>, but <em>g, j,</em> and d. Whether therefore the preservationof <em>c,t,</em> and <em>p,</em> supposing that Caṇḍa really allows it, marks off hisPrakrit as older than that of Hemacandra or Vararuci is more thanquestionable. But, as a matter of fact in III. 12, he does provide for theirchange to <em>j. d.</em> and *b;*and the change of <em>t</em> to <em>d</em> is n Śaurasenī, *i. e,*a local change, and does not indicate priority of time. Besides, even</p>
<p>If we apply the test furnished by these rules to the severadialects used by the characters in the Mṛcchakaṭika as it is inexisting editions, which play contains a large variety ofcharacters, and consequently of speech, we shall find that thelanguage of the Cāṇḍalas, the Śakāra, his servant Sthāvaraka,and even Kumbhīraka and Vardhamānaka, is Māgadhī, thoughthe rules about <strong>स्थ, र्थ,</strong> and <strong>ष्ट</strong> are scarcely observed. There ishardly any dialectic difference in their speeches.But theSāhityadarpaṇa would lead us to expect his Cāṇḍālika and Śākārīrespectively in the first two cases, and Ardhamagadhi in the lastthree. As before observed, some admixture of Māgadhīcharacteristics constitutes this last dialect. Under this view there areinstances of the use of the Ardhamāgadh, as Lassen remarks, in</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>the dropping of these consonants must have been contemplated by him.For in the instances given in the book, they are dropped in all the manuscripts used by Dr. Hoerale, even in A and B, which according to him contain the older version. Thus we have <strong>एइ</strong>for <strong>एति</strong>(I. 12), गयणओ-उor <strong>गयणाओ-उ</strong> for <strong>गगनतः</strong> (I, 16), <strong>कयं</strong>For <strong>कृतम्</strong> (I. 23 and everywhere else),<strong>इहागओ-उ</strong> for <strong>इहागतः</strong> ( II. I.). <strong>इच्छिअं</strong> for <strong>इच्छितम्</strong> (II. 3). कायव्वं-व्वं for<strong>कर्तव्यम्;सुइणं</strong>for <strong>सूचीनाम्</strong> (II. 4), <strong>नेउरं</strong> for <strong>नूपुरम्</strong> (II. 4). <strong>घयं</strong> for घृतम,काउण for <strong>कृत्वा, दीसइ</strong> for <strong>दृश्यते</strong> ( II. 5) <strong>गच्छ</strong>इfor <strong>गच्छति बइ</strong> for <strong>पतिः</strong>( II. 10 ). <strong>सरिआणं सरियाणं सरिताम्</strong> ( II. 11), <strong>गइ-ई</strong> for <strong>गतिः, मइ-ई</strong> for<strong>मतिः</strong> (II.17), &amp;c. &amp;c. It is very much to be regretted that the Doctor shouldin all these cases have set aside the readings of his manuscripts and invented his own with the <strong>त्, च्</strong> and <strong>प्</strong>standing in the words, instead of being dropped. This invention or restoration, as he calls, it, is based on asingular inference that he deduces from a single word, <strong>कृतं</strong> given as aPrakrit word in the book. He says it must originally have been <strong>कतं</strong>, but thecopyist, not knowing of such a word being in the later Prakrit which heknew, took it as the Sanskrit <strong>कृतं</strong>, and wrote accordingly. If, therefore,<strong>कतं</strong> was the Prakrit word in this case, it must have been so in all thosecases in which <strong>कयं</strong> occurs in the book, and so Dr. Hoernle makes it <strong>कतं</strong>throughout. But it did not strike him that if the copyist knew Prakritenough to see that <strong>कतं</strong> was not a Prakrit word, he must have seen that<strong>कृतं</strong> also was not a Prakrit word and could not have given it as such. Nowthe reason why these consonants were not admitted by Caṇḍa, accordingto the manuscripts A and B, among those that are dropped, but onlyamong those that are softened must be that all these rules are only generaland not universal, and there were as many instances of softoning as ofdropping. Besides, I have already said that Caṇḍa&rsquo;s work is perfunctory,</p>
<p>the Prabodhacandrodayn, The dialect used byMāthura, thekeeperof the gambling-house in the Mṛcchakaṭika, is somewhatdifferent. In his speeches, we sometimes find <strong>ल्</strong> and <strong>श्</strong>used for<strong>र्</strong>, and <strong>म्</strong>,sometimes not. The nom. sing. endsin <strong>ओ</strong>, asinthe Mahārāṣṭrīor ŚaurasenMahārāṣṭrī, in some cases, in others it ends in <strong>ए</strong>as in the Māgadhī, and sometimes <strong>उ</strong> as in the Apeabhraṁśa;and the gen. sing. sometimes ends in आहas in the Māgadhī.Ifthe text is to be depended on, the Dākṣiṇātyāwhich Viśvanātha^(1)attributes to gamblers may be such a mixed languae.</p>
<p>Itwould thus appear that if all these inferior dislects did existand were used hy dramatic writers, they differed from each otherin unimportant particulars, and that most of them belonged tothe Māgadhī species, since the MSS. have confounded tham withthe Māgadhī of the grammarians. Hente we are justified intaking the real number of Prakrit dialects used for literary purposes to be six, <em>viz.,</em> those mentioned by Hemacandra, Trivikrama,and Lakṣmīdhara.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>and does not show accuracy of observation and statement. The thirdpoint is the preservation of the medial single surd aspirate consonnntswith the only exception of <em>kh; i. e.,<em><strong>ठ्, थ्, फ्</strong> are preserved. But 111. 11provides for the change of these to <strong>ह्, ध्र्</strong>, and <strong>भ्</strong>. if welook to th senseofthe Sūtraand also to some af the instances that ure given, The change of</em><em>थ्</em></em> to<strong>ध्</strong> is aŚaurasenīpeculiarity. Of the two remaining polats one is theinsertion of य् toavoid the hintus caused by the dropping of a consonant,about which Ihave already spoken, iid the other is unimporkant.</p>
<p>There is therefore, ne question that the Prakrit, ameagre grammar ofwhich is given in the work edited by Dr. Hoernle, ia not older than Hemecandra&rsquo;s.—(1887).</p>
<p>1. Another gambler without a name is introduced in the game scene,whose linguage Prof. Lassen thinks is Dākṣiṇātyāand Māthura’s, Āvantikī. Very few speathes however, ire given tothe former, aod it fs notpossible to come to any ilotinite conclusion from them; butso far as theygo, there is hardly any difference betwoen bis dialect und that of Māthura.The Professoris led to attributetwo languages to gamblers by the annotater on the Śāhityadarpaṇawhom be quotes, and who explains <strong>धूर्त</strong>by<strong>अक्षदेविन्</strong>. But if the word is to be so understood, <strong>दव्यिताम्</strong> in the next lineis not wanted, ond neithar <strong>योध</strong> nor <strong>नागारिक</strong>, For, supposing tha warriorsand clever worldly mon ware gamblers, gambling was oot confined to them;whence thereis no reason to mention then lo particular.</p>
<p>Daṇḍin mentions a work of the name of Bṛhatkathāwritten inthe language of the ghosts, <em>i.e.</em>. in the Paiśācī. Dr. Bühler hasrecently obtained a trace of the work, and arrangements have beenmade for getting it copied¹. It is traditionally ascribed to a poet ofthe name of Gunāḍhya.</p>
<p>Let us now examine cursorily the principal Prakrit and the Śaurasenīwhich ranks next to it in literary importance, but, which, as the model of the inferior dialects and as the language used by the higher class. of Prakrit-speaking dramatic persons in their prose speeches, is more important than the other. Here, as before, I will place a specimen of each before you:—</p>

<p>In the MS. of the Gauḍavadha, from which the firstextract is given <strong>अ</strong>, and <strong>आ</strong> preceded by <strong>अ</strong> and <strong>इ</strong>, aremarked as <strong>य</strong> and <strong>या</strong>. In MSS. of other works, the doesnot appear; but there can be no question that it representsthe later pronunciation correctly, since as already remarkedin a note, this is observed in some of the modern vernnaoulars. But it is to be pronounced like a strengthened <strong>अ</strong> or <strong>आ</strong></p>
<p>and not like the heavy semi-vowel that I mentioned in my observations on the Pāli.</p>
<p><strong>(I) PHONETIC CHANGES COMMON TO PALI AND PRAKRITS</strong></p>
<p>From these extracts you will observe that phonetic decay hasmade greater progress in these dialects than in the one we haveexamined. The changes in the Pali are, with a few exceptions,such as may be attributed to the circumstances and vocal peculiarities of a foreign race. But in the Prakrits the ususal processes of curruption have a wider range of operation; thoughteven here we shall, as we proceed, find it necessary to ascribe agood deal to an ethnological cause.</p>
<p>And first as regards the phonetic transformations which wehave noticed in the Pali, I have to observe that Prakrits alsoexhibit the same with but slight differences. The vowel <strong>ऋ</strong> ischanged to <strong>अ</strong>as in <strong>घअ</strong>, <strong>तण, मअ</strong>, &amp;c. for <strong>घृत, तृण, मृग,</strong> &amp;c.; to <strong>इ</strong> as in <strong>किवा, हिअअ, किस</strong>, &amp;c. for <strong>कृपा, हृदय, कृश</strong>, &amp;c.; to<strong>उ</strong> as in <strong>पुहई, पाउस, बुट्ठ,</strong>&amp;c., for <strong>पृथिवी, प्रावृष्, वृद्ध,</strong> &amp;c. When standing alone, it is more oftenchanged to <strong>रि</strong> than in Pali; as in <strong>रिद्धी</strong> and <strong>रिच्छ</strong> for <strong>ऋद्धि</strong>and <strong>ऋक्ष;रिण</strong> or <strong>अण, रिजू</strong> or <strong>उजू</strong>, &amp;c., for <strong>ऋण, ऋजु</strong>, &amp;c., while the Pali formsof these words are <strong>इद्धि, अच्छ, अण</strong> and <strong>उजु</strong>.</p>
<p>The diphthongs and at are, as in Pali, changed to <strong>ए</strong>and <strong>ओ</strong>,as in <strong>केलास, वेज्ज, केडव</strong>, &amp;c. for <strong>कैलास, वैद्य, कैटभ</strong>, &amp;c.; and in <strong>जोव्वण,कोमुई कोत्थुह</strong> &amp;c. for <strong>यौवन, कौमुदी, कौस्तुभ</strong> &amp;c.; but in a good manyinstances they are dissolved into their elements <strong>अइ</strong>and <strong>अउ</strong>, as in<strong>दइच्चभइरव, दइवअ, सइर,</strong> &amp;c., for <strong>दैत्य, भैरव, देवत, स्वैर</strong>, &amp;c.;and <strong>पउर, कउसल,सउह, मउली</strong>, &amp;c., for <strong>पौर, कौशल, सौध, मौलि</strong>, &amp;c. This change resembles the dissolution of conjunct consonants into the different members,and like it, is due to a weak or languid way of pronunciation. In<strong>ऐ</strong> and <strong>औ</strong> at the first element or <strong>अ</strong> is rapidly pronounced, and thetemporal value assigned to it by the authors of the Prātiśākhyasis, you will remember, half a matra, while in the Prakrti transformations it is one mātrā.</p>
<p>The long vowels are, as in Pali, shortened when followed bydouble consonants; and there is the same or even stronger evidence of the existence of short <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong>. In Pali short <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong>followed by a conjunct are in certain cases changed to ए and ओ,and from that fact we inferred that they were short. Here in a</p>
<p>great many more cases, when so followed, short <strong>इ</strong> is optionallyInterchangeable with <strong>ए</strong>, and short <strong>उ</strong> is necessarily replaced by <strong>ओ</strong>,as in <strong>पिण्ड</strong> or <strong>पेण्ड</strong>, <strong>पिट्ठ</strong>or <strong>पेट्ठ</strong>, <strong>निद्दा</strong>or <strong>नेद्दा,</strong>&amp;c.;and <strong>तोण्ड, मोण्ड, पोक्खर,</strong>&amp;c.; for <strong>पिण्ड, पिष्ट, निद्रा, तुण्ड, मुण्ड पुष्कर</strong>, &amp;c. In several cases <strong>ए</strong>,not followed by a conjunct, is optionally changed to <strong>इ</strong>, as in <strong>विअणा</strong>or <strong>देअणा</strong>for <strong>वेदना, दिअर</strong> or <strong>देअर</strong> for <strong>देवर</strong> &amp;c. The <strong>ए</strong> in these wordsmust for some reason that we will hereafter consider have beenpronounced short and hence interchangeable with <strong>इ</strong>. Sometimesthe consonant following on <strong>ए</strong> or <strong>ओ</strong> is doubled, as in <strong>तेल्ल, पेम्म, सोत्त,जोव्वन,</strong> &amp;c. for <strong>तैल, प्रेमन्, स्रोतस्, यौवन,</strong> &amp;c.;which could only bebecause those vowels were pronounced short, and the loss ofquantity thus occasioned was made up for by rendering the pronunciation heavy and forcible. In other coses the <strong>ए</strong>was so pronounced by some and not by others; and so we have <strong>एक्क</strong>or <strong>एअ</strong>for <strong>एक, सेव्वा</strong>or <strong>सेवा</strong> for <strong>सेवा</strong> &amp;c. The syllables <strong>अय</strong>and <strong>अव</strong>arechanged to <strong>ए</strong>and <strong>ओ</strong>oftener than in Pali, the <strong>अय</strong>of the causativeand the tenth class becoming <strong>ए</strong> necessarily throughout, as in<strong>कारेइ,हासेइ,कहेइ</strong>for <strong>कारयति, हासयति, कथयति</strong> &amp;c.</p>
<p>All the sibilants are reduced to <strong>स्</strong>as in the Pali, but in theMāgadhī dialect to <strong>ञ्;शालश, पुलिश</strong> for <strong>सारस, पुरुष</strong>, &amp;c. Thesedialects do not possess the cerebral <strong>ल्</strong>, and therefore we have <strong>ल्</strong>in the place of the Pali <strong>ल्</strong>, and in some cases the original Sanskrit<strong>ङ्</strong> as in <strong>तलाअ, गरुल, कीलइ</strong>for the Pali <strong>तलाग, गरुल, कीलाति</strong> andSanskrit त<strong>डाग, गरुड, क्रीडति,</strong> &amp;c., <strong>गुल</strong> or <strong>गुड, णाली</strong> or <strong>णाडी</strong>for thePali <strong>गुल,नाली</strong>, &amp;c.and <strong>पीडेइ, नीड</strong>for the Pali <strong>पालेति, नील</strong>&amp;c.</p>
<p>There are a good many more examples of the change of dentalsto cerebrals than in the Pali, both through the influence of aneighbouring <strong>र्</strong> or without it. The <strong>ट्</strong>and <strong>ठ्</strong> which correspond to<strong>त्</strong> and <strong>थ्</strong> are in most cases softened to <strong>ड्</strong> and <strong>ढ्</strong>. Thus we have <strong>पडि</strong>for the Pali <strong>पटि,</strong> as in <strong>पडिमा, पडिहार</strong>, for <strong>प्रतिमा, प्रतिहार</strong> &amp;c. and<strong>पट्ठडिपडण, वहेडअ</strong> for <strong>प्रभृति, पतन, बिभीतक; डोला</strong> or <strong>दोला, डम्भ</strong> or<strong>दम्भ,डम्भ</strong> or <strong>दम्भ</strong> for <strong>दोला, दम्भ, दर्भ</strong>, &amp;c.; <strong>पढम</strong> ( Pali <strong>पठम</strong>)<strong>, सिढिल, मैढी, ओसढ</strong>for <strong>प्रथम, शिथिल;मेथि, औषध</strong>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>In Pali the dental nasal is changed tour in but a few instances;but here it is so changed throughout, necessarily when uninitial,and optionally when at the beginning of a word; as <strong>कणअ, मअण,बअण</strong>, for <strong>कनक, मदन, वदन</strong> &amp;c.,and <strong>णर</strong> or <strong>नर, णई</strong> or <strong>नई, णेइ</strong> or <strong>नेइ</strong>, for</p>
<p><strong>नर, नदी, नयति,</strong> &amp;c. The opposite process is however observable inthe Paiśācī dialect, where not only have we no instances of thischange but even the original Sanskrit <strong>ण्</strong> is changed to <strong>न्</strong> as in<strong>गुन, गन,</strong> for <strong>गुण, गण</strong>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The conjunct consonants are transformed in the Prakrit in thesame way as in the Pali. In the former however, <strong>ज्ञ्</strong> and <strong>म्प्</strong> arechanged to <strong>ण्ण</strong>, and not to <strong>ञ्ञ्</strong> as in the latter, as in, <strong>णाण, सण्णा, अण्ण,सुण्ण</strong>, for <strong>ज्ञान, संज्ञा, अन्य, शून्य</strong>, &amp;c. To be thus corrupted, <strong>ज्ञ्</strong> mustin the original Sanskrit have been pronounced as if it werecomposed of <strong>ज्</strong> and <strong>न्;</strong> and sometimes the latter must have beenso weakly pronounced that the sound of ज् prevailed over it and thewhole became <strong>ज्ज्</strong>, as in <strong>जाण</strong> or णा<strong>ण, सव्वज</strong> or <strong>सव्वण्ण, मणोज</strong> or <strong>मणोण्ण</strong>,for <strong>ज्ञान, सर्वज्ञ, मनोज्ञ,</strong> &amp;c. In the Paiśācī and the Paiśācī, however,the Pali transformation is retained; as in<strong>मञ्ञा</strong>, for <strong>सक्ञ्ञ, कञ्ञका, अभिमञ्ञ</strong>, for <strong>ज्ञान, सर्वज्ञ, मनोज्ञ,</strong> &amp;c. In the Paiśācī and Paiśācī, however, the Pali transformation is retained; as in <strong>मञ्ञा, सक्ञ्ञ, कञ्ञका, अभिमञ्ञ</strong>, for <strong>संज्ञा, सर्वज्ञ, कन्यका, अभिमन्यु</strong>&amp;c.</p>
<p>The conjunct <strong>र्य्</strong> is sometimes changed to <strong>ज्ज्</strong> corresponding tothe <strong>य्य्</strong> of the older dialect, and ह्य to <strong>ज्झ्</strong>to in which case the heavy<em>n</em>ā<em>da</em> of <strong>ह्</strong>is transferred to the <strong>ज्</strong>which takes the place of <strong>य्</strong> as in change of <strong>ध्य्</strong> to <strong>ज्झ्</strong>.</p>
<p>In Pali the consonants of <strong>ह्य</strong> only interchange places; <em>i. e.</em> itbecomes <strong>यह्</strong>. From this and from the change of the initial uncombined <strong>य्</strong> to <strong>ज्</strong>, it appears that very often the Sanskrit <strong>य्</strong>, waspronounced heavily when the Prakrits arose. The Śaurasenīandthe dialects allied with it have, however, both the Pali and thePrakrit corruptions of <strong>र्य्.</strong></p>
<p>A dental forming a conjunct with a following <strong>ब्</strong>is in a fewcases changed to the corresponding palatal; as in <strong>भोच्चा</strong> for <strong>भुक्त्वा, चच्चर</strong>for <strong>चत्वर, पिच्छी</strong> for<strong>पृथ्वी, विज्जं</strong> for <strong>विद्वान, बुज्झा</strong> for <strong>बुद्ध्वा, झअ</strong> for<strong>ध्वज झुणी</strong> for <strong>ध्वनि, सज्झस</strong> for <strong>साध्वस</strong> &amp;c. This seems to srise fromthe fact that <strong>व्</strong> was pronounced so lightly that it lost its distinctive character, and the conjuncts came to be confused withthose containing a dental and <strong>य्</strong> which, you will remember, arechanged to a double palatal. In Pali the <strong>त्व्</strong> is retained in theseinstances, and the <strong>द्व्</strong> and <strong>ध्व्</strong> are changed to <strong>द्द्</strong> and <strong>द्ध्</strong> according tothe general rules, and the <strong>थ्व्</strong> of <strong>पृथ्वी</strong>becomes <strong>थव्</strong>. Besides theconjuncts disjoined in Pali by the interposition of a vowel, wehave <strong>र्ग्</strong> and <strong>र्ष्</strong> also so treated in the Prakrit, sometimes optionally</p>
<p>and sometimes necessarily. Thus <strong>आदर्श</strong>becomes <strong>आअरिस</strong> or <strong>आअंस</strong>,( P. <strong>आदास</strong> ): <strong>सुदर्शन, सुदरिसण</strong>or <strong>सुदंसण</strong>, ( P. <strong>सुदस्सन</strong>); <strong>वर्ष, वरिस</strong> or <strong>वास</strong>( P. <strong>क्स्स</strong>) : <strong>परामर्श, परामरिस</strong>, ( P. <strong>परामास</strong> ): <strong>अमर्श, अमरिस</strong>, ( P. <strong>अमस्स</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>(II) PHONETIC CHANGES IN THE PRAKRITS</strong></p>
<p>Having noticed the changes common to the Prakrits with thePali, we will proceed to consider others distinctive of the former.Most of these were due to the continuous operation of processeswhich come into play in a living language. The Pali exhibitsbut few instances of these processes. The changes observable init are mostly to be traced to one or two vocal peculiarities of themen who spoke it. At the time when the language received theform in which we now find it, the tradition of the originalSanskrit was still distinct; the Pali had not lived an independentlife detached from its mother for a long time. But with thePrakrits the case is different. They show a great many moreinstances of the usual processes, and consequently a much greaterdeparture from the parent tongue. We will begin by noticingwhat may be called the softening process.</p>
<p>The vowels <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong> are softened, as we have seen, to short <strong>ए</strong>and <strong>ओ</strong>before conjunots. These latter sounds are, as indicated inthe last lecture, more open than the former; that is, do not requirethe tongue to be raised so high as in the case of <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong>. Theyare therefore softer. But since the change principally takes placebefore doubles it may, I believe, be traced to their influence, as Ihave already observed. In that case this would be an instance ofassimilation. But the change of long <strong>ई</strong> and <strong>ऊ</strong> to long <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong> isdue to softening alone; as in <strong>पैऊस</strong> for <strong>पीयूष</strong> <strong>आपेल</strong> for <strong>आपीढ, बहेडअ</strong>for <strong>बिभीतक, केरिस</strong> for <strong>कीदृश</strong>, and <strong>एरिस</strong> for <strong>ईदृश, नेड</strong> for <strong>नीड, पेड</strong>for <strong>पीठ,तम्बोल</strong> for <strong>ताम्बूल, तोणीर</strong> for <strong>तूणीर, थोर</strong> for <strong>स्थूल</strong>, and <strong>गलोई</strong> for <strong>गुडूची</strong> Inthe same way, <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong> are in rare cases softened to <strong>अ</strong>, as in <strong>हलद्वा</strong> for<strong>हंरिद्रा पडंसुअ</strong> for <strong>प्रतिश्रुत्</strong> and <strong>जाहिट्ठिल</strong> for <strong>युधिष्ठिर. अ</strong> requires no movementof the tongue or lips, while <strong>इ</strong>and <strong>उ</strong> do. It is therefore softer thanthose two vowels. Both these changes contradict another principle to be hereafter noticed, the operation of which is wide, andthey must therefore be considered special or peculiar changes.The manner in which <strong>ऋ</strong> is softened has been already detailed.</p>
<p>The semivowel <strong>य्</strong> is often softened to <strong>इ</strong>, as in <strong>विअण</strong> for <strong>व्यजन,विलिअ</strong> for <strong>व्पलीक, थीण</strong> for <strong>स्त्यान, उव्वीढ</strong>for <strong>उव्वीढ</strong>for <strong>उद्ज्याव्यूढ; जीआ</strong> for <strong>ज्या</strong> &amp;c.</p>
<p>Here the effort necessary to bring the middle of the tongue closerto the palate is economized, while the position of the organs inother respects is the same. The <strong>य</strong>of the conjunct <strong>र्य</strong>is sometimessoftened in this way to <strong>इ</strong> and sometimes to <strong>इअ</strong>. In the formercase the resulting <strong>इ</strong> is transferred to the previous syllable andforms <strong>ए</strong> with the <strong>अ</strong> contained in it; as in <strong>पेरन्त</strong> for <strong>पर्यन्त, अच्छेर</strong> for<strong>आश्चर्य, बम्भचेर</strong> for <strong>ब्रह्मचर्य, सुन्देर</strong> for <strong>सौन्दर्यं,</strong> &amp;o. Similarly is changedto <strong>उ</strong> as in <strong>झुणी</strong> for <strong>ध्वनि, बीसुं</strong> for <strong>विष्वक्, गउओ</strong> for <strong>गवय, सुवइ</strong>for <strong>स्वपितिदु</strong> for <strong>द्वि</strong>. &amp;c.</p>
<p>The surds are softened into sonants. The pronunciation of theserequires, as you will remember, less exertion than that of theformer. For, sonants such as <strong>ग्, घ्, द्, ध्</strong>, &amp;c., are pronounced bymeans of <em>nāda</em>, or vocal sound which is produced when the glottisis in its natural condition and the chords vibrate, and the surds<strong>क्, ख्, त्, श्</strong>,&amp;c. are uttered by sending forth simple breath or<em>śvāsa</em>, to produce which it is necessary to stretch the glottis.This effort is saved by changing the surds to sonants. Thus <strong>क्</strong> ischanged to <strong>ग्</strong> as in <strong>मरगअ</strong> for <strong>मरकत</strong> and <strong>गेन्दुआ</strong> for <strong>कन्दुक</strong>; <strong>ट्</strong>to <strong>ड्</strong> as in <strong>नड, भड,</strong> and <strong>घड</strong>, for <strong>नट, भट</strong>, and <strong>घट</strong> and in <strong>पडि</strong> for <strong>प्रति</strong> and theother instances given above; <strong>ठ्</strong>to <strong>ढ्</strong>as in <strong>मढ, सढ, कमढ, कुढार</strong>, and<strong>पढ</strong>, for <strong>मठ, शठ, कमठ, कुठार</strong>, and <strong>पठ</strong>;and <strong>त</strong> and <strong>थ</strong> to <strong>द</strong> and <strong>ध</strong> as in <strong>पद</strong>for <strong>एत, नाध</strong>for <strong>नाथ</strong>&amp;c. (in Śaur.). The cerebral, and <strong>ठ्</strong>resultingfrom the original dentals <strong>त्</strong>and <strong>थ्</strong> are also similarly softened to<strong>ङ्</strong> and <strong>ङ्</strong>as in प<strong>डि</strong>for <strong>प्रति</strong> (प<strong>टि</strong>in Pali), <strong>पहुडि</strong> for प्र<strong>भृति, बहेडअ</strong> for<strong>बिभीतक, हरडई</strong> for <strong>हरीतकी, मडअ</strong> for मृ<strong>तक</strong> &amp;c. and <strong>सिढिल</strong> for <strong>शिथिल</strong>, <strong>पुढवी</strong> for <strong>पृथिवी, पढम</strong> for <strong>प्रथम</strong>, &amp;c. The sonant answering to <strong>प्</strong> is <strong>ब्</strong>but this is further softened to <strong>व्,</strong> as in , <strong>कूव, कवाल, कुणाव, तव</strong>इ, &amp;c.,for <strong>कूप, कपाल, कुणप, तप</strong>ति, &amp;c.</p>
<p>An original <strong>ङ्</strong> is softed to <strong>ल्</strong>, in which case there is a savingof two efforts. The complete contact necessary for the pronunciation of <strong>ङ्</strong> being avoided, we have <strong>ल्</strong>. This sound is similar to <strong>ल्</strong>inthe fact that the breath before the break of the contact or closeapproach is allowed to pass out by the sides of the tongue, but ismore difficult or harder because its position being higher upthe tongue has to be raised higher than in pronouncing<strong>ल्</strong>, the position of which is near the root of the upper teeth. Thisadditional exertion is saved by proceeding from <strong>ङ्</strong>, at once to <strong>ल्</strong>.We have thus <strong>गरुल, तंलाअ, कीलइ</strong>, <strong>दालिम, गुल, नाली, for गरुड, तडाग</strong>,</p>
<p><strong>क्रीडति, दाडिम, गुड, नाडी</strong> &amp;c.. In the Pali, however, you willremember and probably in some unwritten Prakrits also, thecerebral character of the letter was preserved, and we have <strong>ल्</strong>instead of <strong>ल्</strong>.</p>
<p>Sometimes <strong>ङ्</strong> is softened to <strong>र्</strong> only. The position of this islower than that of <strong>ड्</strong>, and the contact is incomplete. It is therefore softer than but harder than <strong>ड्</strong>. This last sound is producedlower still, but a light close approach is formed, and the breath isallowed to escape by the sides of the tongue; while in uttering <strong>र</strong>,the tongue is kept in its position with greater force, and the breathis allowed to vibrate. This change is principally to be met within the case of the <strong>ड्</strong> resulting from an original <strong>ढ्</strong> in such wordsas <strong>एआरह बारह तेरह</strong>, &amp;c, for <strong>एकादश द्वादश त्रयोदश</strong>, &amp;c., the <strong>द्</strong> ofwhich must first have become <strong>ड्</strong>. In <strong>कलम्ब, दोहल</strong>, and <strong>पलित्त</strong>, for<strong>कदम्ब, दोहद,</strong> and <strong>प्रदीप्त</strong>, we have instances of an original <strong>द्</strong> passing <strong>ल्</strong>.</p>
<p>An original <strong>र्</strong> is changed to <strong>ल</strong> which, as just observed, is softerthan <strong>र्,</strong> as in <strong>हलद्दी, दलिद्द, मुहल, इङ्गाल</strong>, &amp;c. for <strong>हरिद्रा, दरिद्र, मुखर,अङ्गार</strong>, &amp;c. When the <strong>र्</strong> forming the first member of a conjunct issoftened in this way, and the following member is weak or isitself capable of becoming , the whole conjunct becomes <strong>ल्ल</strong>; as<strong>पर्यस्त</strong> becomes <strong>पल्लट्टत्थ, पर्याण, पल्लाण;आर्द्र, अल्ल</strong> or <strong>ओल्ल;मर्द, मल्ल</strong>, &amp;c,The sibilant <strong>म्</strong>, which is the only one we have in the Mahārāṣṭrīand Śaurasenī, is sometimes softened to , that is, the simpleheavy breath somewhat compressed at the dental position is madeuncompressed heavy vocsl sound; as in <strong>दिवह, पाहाण, दह, एआरह,बारह</strong> &amp;c., for <strong>दिवस, पाषाण, दश, एकादश द्वादश</strong> &amp;c.</p>
<p>Another phenomenon characteristic of the Prakrits is the dropping away of single uninitial consonants. The <strong>क्</strong> is dropped, as in<strong>सअड, कुम्भआर</strong> for <strong>शकट, कुम्भकार</strong>, &amp;c.; <strong>ग्</strong> as in <strong>नअ, नअर साअर</strong>, for <strong>नग,नगर, सागर,</strong> &amp;c.; <strong>च्</strong> as in <strong>वअण, सूई</strong>, for <strong>वचन, सूचि</strong>, &amp;c.;<strong>ज्</strong> asin <strong>रअअ,राआ, गअ</strong> for <strong>रजत, राजा, गज,</strong> &amp;c.; <strong>त्</strong>as in <strong>विआण, पआवई, गअ</strong>,for <strong>वितान,प्रजापति, गत</strong> &amp;c.; <strong>द्</strong>as in <strong>मअण, पाअ, कअल</strong>, for <strong>मदन, पाद, कदल</strong>, &amp;c.; <strong>प्</strong>followed by any vowel except <strong>अ</strong>, as in <strong>रिऊ, कई, विउल</strong>, for <strong>रिपु कपि,विपुल</strong> &amp;.; <strong>य्</strong>as in <strong>वाउणा, णअण</strong>, for <strong>वायुना, नयन</strong>, &amp;c.; as in <strong>जीज, दिअह</strong>,for <strong>जीव दिवस</strong> &amp;c.The vowel <strong>अ</strong> or <strong>आ</strong> that remains after thealision is, when proceded by <strong>अ</strong> or <strong>आ</strong>, pronounced like a light <strong>य</strong>.Wo find it written in mss. also as in <strong>सयढ, तित्थयरो, नगर</strong>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>In the same way, the mute element of the aspirates is dropped,except in the case of the palatals and of, the or the heavy<em>nāda</em> or vocal sound being alone preserved. Thus we have <strong>मुह,लिह, सही</strong>, for <strong>मुख लिख सखी</strong>, &amp;c., <strong>मेह, माह, पाहुण</strong>, for <strong>मेघ, माघ, प्राघुण</strong>,&amp;c.; <strong>नाह, मिहुण, कहा</strong>, for <strong>नाथ, मिथुन, कथा</strong>, &amp;c.; <strong>बाहेर, वहू, साहु</strong>, for <strong>वधिरवधू, साधु</strong>, &amp;c.; <strong>लाह, सोहग्ग, सोहा</strong>, for <strong>लाभ, सौभाग्य, शोभा</strong>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The range of the operation of these processes is very wide, andthe number of words transformed in accordance with them isvery large. Now, the principle which is at the bottom of thisclision of consonants is the same as that which brings aboutsoftening, viz., economy of exertion. But in a growing languagewhich knows of no accidents in the course of its history, thereis another principle which counteracts this, viz., the necessity ofpronouncing words in the manner to be understood by others.Hence a wholesale elision is impossible; and the natural course isto soften sounds away, until finally they are elided. This of coursemust be a very slow process. But in the Prakrit, and especiallythe Mahārāṣṭrī, we do not find it to be slow.</p>
<p>Elision seems to be a distinguishing characteristic which strikesone very forcibly on reading a Prakrit passage. It is too regular,systematic, and far-reaching, to have been the product of a longcourse of softening. In fact, because it is so systematic andgeneral, some writers have doubted whether the Prakrits weregenuine dialects, and have expressed their belief that they are thecreation of Paṇḍits. But we shall find that the modern vernaculars retain the words shorn of their elements by the Prakrits inthis way; and that these latter dialects were the immediateparents of those we now speak in Northern India. If this generalmutilation of words was brought about by a natural decay, wemust suppose the process to have gone on for a great manycenturies. The Prakrit vocables that have descended to themodern vernaculars have not, since the period when the Prakritsarose about fourteen centuries ago, suffered at all so much asSanskrit words in passing into the Prakrits. We have not droppedaway any of the elements of Prakrit vocables, though we mayhave re-arranged them In some cases. If, then, fourteen centurieshave not been sufficient to make words lose any of their elementsby the action of natural causes, the process by which Sanskrit</p>
<p>words were mutilated and became Prakritmust, if it was naturaland ordinary, have been in operation for a considerably longerperiod, a supposition which appears extremely improbable. And itis questionable whether a language which has not been exposedto accidents in the course of its history suffers so much, evenafter the lapse of any conceivable time. The Teutonic languages,though they have been going through an independent course ofdevelopment, since the period when the ancestors of the modernEnglish and Germans separated from the ancestors of the Hindusin pre-historic ages, have preserved the elements of old Aryanvocables which the Prakrits lost. They may have transformedthe words, but have not mutilated them to any great extent. TheEnglish words <em>father, mother, brother, foot</em>, and others, have all theelements of the old <strong>पितृ, मातृ, भ्रातृ ,पद्</strong>(<strong>पाद</strong>), and others; while the Prakrit <strong>पीआ</strong> or <strong>पीउ, माआ, माइ</strong> or <strong>माउ, भाआ</strong> or <strong>भाउ</strong>, and <strong>पाअ</strong>, and themodern vernacular <strong>पिउ, माउ, मा, माई, भाई, भाउ</strong>, and <strong>पा</strong> or <strong>पाय</strong>, havelost all except the first consonantal sound.</p>
<p>The elision of consonants on a large scale in the Prakrits istherefore to be accounted for in another way than by attributingit to a natural process of decay. The Prakrit words must be takento represent the pronunciation of the corresponding Sanskritwords by an alien race. The vocal organs of the people of thatrace were unused to the utterance of Sanskrit sounds and in thisrespect, they were in the condition of children, making their firstattempts at articulate speech, and elided uninitial consonantalsounds and assimilated cojunct consonants as these do. When a child or a barbarous foreigner listens to an elderly or morecivlized person, he has not the patience to attend to all the soundscomposing a word and to reproduce them carefully, or has notacquired the habit of doing so. The first letter alone makes a strongimpression on his ear, and this he faithfully reproduces; and asto the rest, he realizes their quantity by pronouncing the vowels,but his tongue being untrained, the peculiar movements necessaryfor uttering the consonantal sounds he cannot go through, andavoids. In going over the Pali we had to attribute the assimilation of conjuncts and other peculiarities observable in that dialectto such a cause; and now the elision in the Prakrits that we</p>
<p>have been considering must, I believe, be accounted for in thesame way.</p>
<p>But what could be the historical events which led to thewholesale assimilation of consonants in the first place and to thesimilar elision of uninitial consonants in addition to the assimilation, in the next ? I would put forward the following hypothesis.It would appear that when the Aryas moved from the land of thefive rivers and settled in the country known afterwards asBrahmāvarta and Kurukṣetra, — that is the country aboutThāneśvar, they formed a consolidated community, in which anaboriginal or alien race was incorporated and the language represented by the Pali was the language of this race. When, however,the consolidated community spread eastwards and southwards, they met other alien races, and the dialect, spoken by the lowestclass of the consolidated community, was learnt by these newalien races, and the words which were in the Pali stage, werefurther corrupted into the forms which we find in Prakrits. Thedialects of the Aśoka edicts do not show instances of the Prakritrule of elision, though some peculiarities of one or two laterdialects are discernable in them. Does this necessarily showthat the Prakrits had not developed in the time of Aśoka ?I think not. The dialects of the edicts represent the spokenlanguage of the more cultured portion of the consolidated community, and not that used by the races, which were newly incorporated with the community, and formed a class lower in thescale, though the Prakrits must have begun to be developedabout the time of Aśoka. In the Nasik cave inscriptions of aboutthe second century of the Christian era, we observe someinstances of the Prakrit peculiarity of elision, whence it wouldappear that the Prakrits had then come into existence, thoughthey were still regarded as vulgar and were neglected, theprincipal inscriptions being in the Pali which had then become alearned language. The conclusion we came to in the last lecture,that the Pali represents middle Sanskrit in a vernacular form,while the Prakrits correspond to the last or classical stage, is inharmony with this view.</p>
<p>Another process which transforms the words of a language isassimilation. We have already discussed the assimilation of the</p>
<p>members of a conjunot and of the dipthongal sounds <strong>ऐ</strong> and <strong>औ</strong>,and will now consider the application of the process to thedifferent syllables composing a word. The <strong>अ</strong>of the second syllableof <strong>ईषत्, वेतस्</strong>,and <strong>कृपण</strong>, is changed to <strong>इ</strong>, because the vowel in thefirst is <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>ए</strong>, the <strong>ऋ</strong> of <strong>कृपण</strong> being changed to <strong>इ</strong>;and we have <strong>ईसि,वेडिस,</strong> and <strong>किविण</strong>.Similarly, the <strong>अ</strong> of <strong>मरिच</strong> and <strong>वल्ली</strong>, and the <strong>इ</strong>of<strong>इक्षु</strong> are changed to <strong>इ, ए</strong>,and <strong>उ</strong> through the influence of thefollowing <strong>इ, ई</strong>, and <strong>उ</strong>; and the forms are <strong>मिरिअ, वेल्ली</strong>, and <strong>उच्छु</strong>.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when <strong>य्</strong> as a member of a conjunct is changed toa palatal, it influences the preceding vowel and brings it over toits own position, as in <strong>सेज्जा</strong> for <strong>शय्या, मज्झिम</strong> for <strong>मध्यम, गेज्झ</strong> for <strong>ग्राह्य</strong>,&amp;c. An original palatal also produces similar effect, as in <strong>जिमइ</strong>or <strong>जेमइ</strong> for <strong>जमति</strong>.</p>
<p>In the words <strong>पुढम</strong> for <strong>प्रथम पोम्म</strong> for <strong>पद्म</strong>, and <strong>ओप्पेइ</strong>for <strong>अर्पयति</strong>, theadjoining vowel is changed to a to make it go easily with thelabial <strong>प</strong>. You will observe that it is that yields so readily tothe influence of an adjoining letter, because in pronouncingit no movement of the tongue is necessary. It is soundedby letting off <em>nāda</em> or intonated breath, without offering anyobstruction to it; and this current gives rise to the differentvowels when it is obstructed in various degrees by variousmovements of the tongue and the lips; so that if the organicposition of the previous consonant remains a little longer,or if the following is begun a little earlier, the currentassumes the form that that position gives it. An aspirate or anaspirated mute existing in a word influences an adjoining vowelor a consonant; that is, the heavy breath that is necessary for theutterance of the aspirate mingles itself with the other sounds also.Thus <strong>कासित</strong> becomes <strong>खासिअ;परुष, फरूस; परिध, फलिह; परिखा, फलिहा;पनस, फणस;</strong> and <strong>बिसिनी, भिसिणी</strong>, in which instances <strong>क्, प्</strong>, and <strong>ब्</strong> arechanged to <strong>ख्, फ्,</strong> and <strong>भ्</strong>. In other cases the heavy breath istransferred to an adjoining vowel which becomes <strong>ह्</strong>;as in <strong>फलिह</strong>for <strong>स्फटिक;निहस</strong> for <strong>निकष, विहत्थी</strong> for <strong>वितस्तवबसही</strong> for <strong>वसति, भरह</strong>for<strong>भरत</strong>, in which cases, by the dropping of the mute, we should have,but for this heavy breath, <strong>फलिअ, निअस विअत्थी, वसई</strong>, and <strong>भरअ.</strong> Thewords <strong>सटा</strong> and <strong>शकट</strong> become <strong>सढा</strong> and <strong>सभढ</strong>, the <strong>ठ्</strong> &amp; resulting from thetransference of the heavy breath being softened to <strong>ढ्</strong>.</p>
<p>Another kind of assimilation must be noticed here. Thevowels are open sounds and the consonants close. These beingused together, the openness of the former has a tendency to diminish to assimilate them to the latter, and the closeness of the latter has a similar tendency to yield to the openness of theformer. This latter change involves economy and is the same assoftening; <strong>त्</strong> and <strong>प्</strong>for instance become more and more likevowels, when they are changed to <strong>द्</strong> and <strong>ब्</strong>, and thence <strong>ल्</strong> to and <strong>व्</strong>;while the latter ultimately does become the vowel <strong>उ</strong>. But, theformer does not involve softening in itself but rather hardening,since <strong>ए</strong> or <strong>इ</strong>, and <strong>ओ</strong> or <strong>उ</strong>, to which <strong>अ</strong>is sometimes changed, occasion motions of the tongue and the lips. which the latterdoes not. But in this change, there is an ease of pronunciation,such as is involved in assimilation. Immediately after oneclosing of the passage of the breath, it is easier to make a shorteropening for it such as <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong> require, before another closing,than a longer one, such as the pronunciation of <strong>ए</strong>and <strong>ओ</strong> requires,or a complete one, such as is necessary for <strong>अ</strong>. This last vowel therefore has a tendency to pass off into <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>इ</strong>, or <strong>ओ</strong>and <strong>उ</strong>.But whether the shorter opening is to be made at the middle ofthe palate or at the lips, that is, whether <strong>अ</strong>is to be changed to <strong>ए</strong>and <strong>इ</strong>, or <strong>ओ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong>, depends on the vocal habits of a people. Someare accustomed to open their lips and round them, others not.Similarly, whether the opening shall be the least possible or alittle more, that is, whether <strong>अ</strong> is to be changed to <strong>ए</strong> or <strong>ओ</strong> first,and then to <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>उ</strong>, or at once to <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>उ</strong>, depends upon habit. Andthe ease of pronunciation involved in this kind of assimilation isalso relative. Some people may feel the muscular effort requiredfor <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong> to be more intolerable than the wider or completeopening, and prefer <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong>or even <strong>अ</strong>, as in the instances givenunder vowel softening, and in others occurring in some of themodern vernaculars. The Prakrits change <strong>अ</strong> to <strong>इ</strong> in virtue ofthis law of assimilation, as in <strong>पिक्क</strong>for <strong>पक्क, इङ्गाल</strong> for <strong>अङ्गार, मुइङ्ग</strong>for <strong>मृदङ्ग, सिवि</strong>ण for <strong>स्वप्न</strong>, and <strong>णिडाल</strong> for <strong>ललाट</strong>; and to <strong>ए</strong> in <strong>मेन्दुआ</strong> for<strong>कन्दुक, एत्थ</strong>for <strong>अत्रदेक्ख</strong> for <strong>द्रक्ष</strong>&amp;c.</p>
<p>Opposed to this process of assimilation is dissimilation. Whenthe same vowel occurs in two successive syllables, it is felt to beburdensome, and hence a dissimilar vowel is substituted for it in</p>
<p>one of the two. We have thus <strong>बहडेअ</strong>for <strong>विभीतक, सढिल</strong> for <strong>शिथिल,पुहषी</strong> for <strong>पृथवी, मउल, मउढ</strong>and <strong>मउर</strong> for <strong>मुकुल, मुकुट</strong> and <strong>मुकुर, भिउडी</strong> for<strong>भुकुटी, पुरिस</strong> for <strong>पुरुष, निउर</strong> or <strong>नेउर</strong> for <strong>नूपुर, दुअल्ल</strong>for <strong>दुकूल, सोअमल्ल</strong> for<strong>सौकुमार्य, अगरु</strong> for <strong>अगुरु, गलोइ</strong>for <strong>गुडूची</strong>, and <strong>गरुअ</strong> for <strong>गुरुक</strong>.</p>
<p>The words <strong>अङ्गुदी</strong> and हरडई for <strong>इङ्गुदी</strong>and <strong>हरीतकी</strong> must also beconsidered as instances of the same law, though another syllableintervenes between the two containing the same vowel. Instancesof this process must necessarily be few, since there are not manywords containing the same vowel in successive syllables. But wehave got so many here, that the substitution of a dissimilar vowelin such cases may be considered a general characteristic of thePrakrits. It will also be seen that in these instances, <strong>अ</strong>is subsituted for <strong>इ</strong> throughout, and for <strong>उ</strong>mostly; so that these may alsobe considered as instances in which the most open sound अwaspreferred by the Prakrit speakers to <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>उ</strong>, as involving lessexertion.</p>
<p>The first <strong>अ</strong> of स<strong>मृद्धि, प्रसिद्धि प्रकट, प्रतिपद्, सदृक्ष</strong>, &amp; is lengthenedoptionally and we have <strong>समिद्धि</strong> or <strong>सामिद्धि, पसिद्धि</strong> or <strong>पासिद्धि, प-पाअड,प-पाडिव, स-सारिच्छ</strong>, &amp;c. On the other hand, the <strong>आ</strong> of <strong>यथा, तथा,उत्खात, संस्थापित, प्राकृत, हालिक, कुमार</strong> &amp;c. is optionally shortened; andthese words become <strong>जह-हा,तह-हा, उक्खअ-क्खाअ, संठविअ-ठाविअ, पअडह-पाअड, हलिअ-हालिञ, कुमर-मार</strong> &amp;c.</p>
<p>The <strong>ई</strong> of <strong>पानीय, अलीक, जीवति गभीर, द्वितीय, तृतीय</strong>, &amp;c., is necessarilyshortened, and we have <strong>पाणिअ, अलिअ जिवइ, गहिर दुइअ तहअ</strong>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Changes of this nature seem to be due to some kind of accentwith which the words must have been pronounced. When oneof the syllables of a word is accented, the whole vocal weight ofthat word gravitates towards that syllable. It is sounded withgreater force and pitch and with a jerk which are apt tocause a wider opening between the organs of speech than isnecessary. Hence the less open vowels <strong>अ, इ,</strong> and <strong>उ</strong> have atendency to become more open, *i. e.,*<strong>आ, ए</strong>, and <strong>ओ</strong>. Similarly theforce and the jerk tend to prolong the time occupied by theutterance of the vowel, that is, to lengthen it. And long vowelsoccurring in the unaccented syllables often become short, sincethey are uttered hurriedly or carelessly. Supposing <strong>प्रतिपद्</strong> waspronounced with the accent on <strong>प्र</strong>, that would be a reason why the</p>
<p><strong>प्र</strong> should become <strong>प्रा</strong>in the course of time; and if <strong>द्वितीय</strong>waspronounced with the accent on <strong>य</strong>, we can understand why the<strong>ती</strong> should become short.</p>
<p>But the real nature of the old Sanskrit accents, notwithstandingthe labours of the grammarians, is little understood. How wordswere actually pronounced in this respect it is difficult to say.If the <em>udātta</em> was really the acute accent, it falls in some of theabove words on syllables, by being on which, it could not haveoperated in the manner indicated above. The supposition thatthe <em>svarita</em> was the acute accent fails equally. But perhaps theold accents went out of use very early, and others took up theirplace. Whatever may have been the case, the changes we havebeen considering seem to have risen from an accent of some sort.</p>
<p>The <strong>ए</strong> of <strong>वेदना, चपेटा, देवर</strong>, and <strong>केसर</strong> is optionally changed to <strong>इ</strong>;for, supposing that the accent fell on the second or third syllable,the force necessary to pronounce it could not be successfullyexerted if the mouth had to be previously opened wide for sounding <strong>ए</strong>. It is thus reduced to the close vowel <strong>इ</strong>; and so wehave <strong>विअणा, चविडा, दिअर</strong> and <strong>किसर</strong>. The dropping of initial vowels as in <strong>रण्ण</strong> for <strong>अरण्य</strong>, and <strong>लाबू</strong>for <strong>अलाबू</strong>must also be traced tothose vowels being unaccented. The accent on the penultimatevowel, which is very general in the vernaculars, as will benoticed in the next lecture, had probably its beginning in thesePrakrits, and of this fact these six words are instances. Thispenultimate accent seems to have had a wider range in the laterstage of these dialects represented by the Apabhraṁśa.</p>
<p>There are several instances in these dialects of the interchangeof consonants. The word <strong>स्नुषा</strong>becomes <strong>सुण्हा</strong>, while regularly itought to be <strong>ण्हुसा</strong>; <strong>ण्ह्</strong>and <strong>म्</strong> thus interchange places. Similarly,<strong>करेणू</strong> is transformed to <strong>कणेरू, वाराणसी</strong> to <strong>वाणारसी, अचलपुर</strong> to <strong>अलचपुर,आलान</strong> to <strong>आणाल, लघु</strong> to <strong>हल</strong> ( <strong>लहु</strong> also being used ), <strong>महाराष्ट्र</strong> to <strong>मरहट्ट</strong>, &amp;c.In the case of <strong>विच्छुअ</strong>for <strong>वृश्चिक</strong>, we have an interchange of vowels,for the <strong>उ</strong> resulting from <strong>ऋ</strong> is transferred to <strong>श्च</strong>, and its <strong>इ</strong> to <strong>व</strong>. Inordinary life we often find that s man, speaking hastily, makesthe sounds of a word thus interchange places. When severalpeople happen to do so in the case of particular words, the newtransformations come in the course of time to be regarded as thetrue words and acquire a recognized position.</p>
<p>The Prakrits sometimes change a labial to the nasal of itsclass as in <strong>नीम</strong> for <strong>नीप, आमेल</strong> for <strong>आपीड, कमन्ध</strong> for <strong>कबन्ध, नीमी</strong> for<strong>नीवि, समर</strong> for <strong>शबर</strong>, and <strong>सिमिण</strong> for <strong>स्वप्न</strong>. These are optional changes;the forms of the words with <strong>व</strong>or <strong>ब</strong> instead of <strong>म</strong> also existing.Though the change involves softening, since a portion of thebreath is sent through the nose and the force of the contactweakened, it must be attributed to a tendency to speak throughthe nose.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Prakrits introduced an <em>anusvāra</em> into wordswhich did not originally contain it; where also the breath wasdischarged through the mouth as well as nose.In this manner,<strong>वक</strong> became <strong>वंक अश्रु, अंसु, श्मश्रु, मंसु;स्पर्श, फंस; पुच्छ, एंछ;मूर्धा मुंढा;बुध्न, बुंध;दर्शन, दंसण, वृश्चिक, विंचुअ;मार्जार, मंजार; प्रतिश्रुत्, पडंसआ</strong>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The last syllable of the absolutive termination <strong>ऊण</strong> and of thecase endings <strong>एण</strong> and <strong>एसु</strong> is also sometimes nasalised, as in <strong>काऊणं</strong>or <strong>काऊण</strong> for <strong>कृत्वा</strong> and <strong>वच्छेणं</strong> or <strong>ण</strong>and <strong>वच्छेसुं</strong>or <strong>सु</strong> for <strong>वृक्षेण</strong> and <strong>वृक्षेषु</strong>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the existing <em>ausvāra</em> of a few wordsis dropped, probably from a feeling that its existence in thosewords was due to a mistake and from a desire to correct it. Thuswe have <strong>मास</strong> or <strong>मंस</strong> for <strong>मांस, का</strong>स or <strong>कंस</strong> for <strong>कांस्य, पासु</strong> or <strong>पंसु</strong> for <strong>पांसु,दाणि</strong> or <strong>दाणिं</strong> for <strong>इदानीं</strong>, and of <strong>णं</strong> or <strong>ण</strong>as the termination of thegen. pl. The letter <strong>ल्</strong> is, in a few cases optionally, sometimesnecessarily, transformed into <strong>ण्</strong>, as in <strong>णाहल</strong> or <strong>लाहल, णङ्गुल</strong> or<strong>लङ्गुल, णङ्गूल</strong> or <strong>लङ्गुल</strong>and <strong>णडाल</strong> or <strong>णिडाल</strong>, for <strong>लाहल, लाङ्गल, लाङ्गुल</strong>, and<strong>ललाट</strong>. In the last instance <strong>ट्</strong> is softened and made to exchange its place with the second <strong>ल्</strong>, and the <strong>अ</strong> of <strong>ण</strong> becomes <strong>इ</strong> optionally.This also points to the Prakrit characteristic of speaking throughthe nose.</p>
<p>The remarks I have hitherto made apply to the Mahārāṣṭrīorthe principal Prakrit. The Śaurasenīdiffers from it in but a fewparticulars. It does not drop <strong>त्</strong> and <strong>थ्</strong>, but softens them into <strong>द्</strong>and <strong>ध्</strong>, as in <strong>पुरिद, मारुदि, तधा, नाध</strong>, &amp;c., for <strong>पूरित, मारुति, तथा, नाथ,</strong>&amp;c.The conjunct <strong>न्त</strong> is often changed to <strong>न्द्</strong> as in <strong>निचिन्दो, अन्देडर</strong> for<strong>निश्चिन्त अन्तःपुर</strong> &amp;c.</p>
<p>In addition to these peculiarities, in the Māgadhī the <strong>र्</strong> and <strong>स्</strong>of the principal Prakrit are represented by <strong>ल्</strong> and <strong>ण्</strong> as in <strong>नल, कल,शालश, पुलिश</strong>, for <strong>नर, फर, सारस, पुरुष</strong>, &amp;c. The <strong>स्</strong>of a conjunct is not</p>
<p>assimilated but preserved, and the <strong>ष्</strong> changed to <strong>स्</strong>, as in <strong>पस्खलदिहस्ती</strong> for <strong>प्रस्खलति हस्ती, शुष्क दालु</strong> for <strong>शुष्क दारु, कस्ट</strong>, for <strong>कष्ट</strong> &amp;c. The double<strong>द्</strong> and the conjunct <strong>ष्ठ</strong> are changed to <strong>स्ट्</strong>, and <strong>स्थ्</strong> and <strong>र्थ</strong> to <strong>स्त; ठ्</strong>and <strong>श्</strong> being thus softened to <strong>द्</strong> and <strong>त्</strong>. Thus we have <strong>भस्टालिका</strong> for<strong>भट्टारिका, सुस्टु</strong>, for <strong>सुष्टु. उवस्तिद</strong> for <strong>उपस्थित शस्तबाह</strong> for <strong>सार्थवा</strong>ह, &amp;c.The consonant <strong>ज्</strong> whether original, or derived, as in the Prakritcorruptions of <strong>य्</strong> or <strong>र्य</strong>, was pronounced lightly, that is softened to<strong>य</strong>, as in <strong>याणादि</strong> for <strong>जानाति, अय्य</strong> for <strong>अद्य</strong>&amp;c. The conjuncts <strong>ज्ञ्, न्य्</strong>,and <strong>ण्य्</strong> are, as before mentioned, changed to <strong>ञ्ञ्</strong>, as in Pali; and<strong>च्छ्</strong>to <strong>श्च्</strong>, as in <strong>गश्च, पुश्च</strong>for <strong>गच्छ, पृच्छ</strong>, &amp;c. The <strong>क्ष्</strong>of <strong>प्रेक्ष्</strong>and <strong>चक्ष्</strong>is changed to <strong>स्क्</strong>, as in <strong>पेस्कदि</strong> for <strong>प्रेक्षते</strong> and <strong>आचस्कादि</strong> for <strong>आचक्षते</strong>.</p>
<p>In the Paiśācī, the changes of single consonants that we havenoticed in the case of the Mahārāṣṭrīand Śaurasenīdo not takeplace; that is, the consonants are not dropped or softened, nor arethey transformed by the process of assimilation. The dentalsare not changed to cerebrals, but the original Sanskrit cerebralsare optionally changed to dentals, as in <strong>कुतुम्बक</strong> or <strong>कुटुम्बक</strong> for<strong>कुटुम्बक</strong>; and an original <strong>ण्</strong> to <strong>न्</strong> throughout as in <strong>सुनगन</strong> for गुणगण.Tha sonant <strong>द्</strong>is hardened to <strong>त्</strong>, asin <strong>तामोतर</strong> for <strong>दामोदर, पतेस</strong> for<strong>प्रदेश</strong>, &amp;c. The sibilants are changed to <strong>म्</strong> as in Pali and theprincipal Prakrit, and <strong>ज्ञ्</strong> and <strong>न्य्</strong> to <strong>ञ्ञ्</strong> as in the former.</p>
<p>In the CūlikāPaiśācī, the sonants are throughout changed tosurds, as in <strong>नकर, मक्कन, मेख, बक्ख, राचा, चीमूत</strong>, &amp;c., for <strong>नगर, मार्गण, मेघ,व्याघ्र, राजा, जीमूत</strong>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Phonetically, the Paiśācīappears to be in nearly the same condition as the Pali, but the hardening of sonants is peculiar, andmay be compared to the change of Sanskrit sonants to surds in theTeutonic languages, as in <em>foot</em> for <strong>पढ्</strong>, <em>tooth</em> for <strong>दत्</strong>, <em>know</em> for <strong>ज्ञा</strong>, &amp;c.Such changes involve no economy whatever; and like the changeof dentals to cerebrals, they must be attributed to certain peculiarities of the vocal organs. Even in the operation of the usualprocesses we have, as you will have seen, found very wide scopefor the play of similar special aptitudes. The characteristic ofthe dialect we have been considering, of not changing dentalsto cerebrals as the Pali and the Prakrits do, and even the dentalizing of cerebrals, would appear to be truly Aryan. Perhapsthen, this was the language of an Aryan tribe that had remained</p>
<p>longer in the original seat of the race, and was connected with theancestors of Teutons, so as to develop a phonetic peculiarity resembling theirs, and emigrated to India at a very late period and settledon the borders. Or it might be, that the tribe came to Indiaalong with the others; but living in the mountainous countrieson the border, in a sort of rude independence, it developed thispeculiarity of pronunciation, which to my mind betokens a rudeand uncontrollable force of breath. Since, under this supposition,they could not have come in very close contact with their morecivilized brethren of the plains, their language did not undergosome of those phonetic modifications, which Sanskrit underwentin the mouths of the aboriginal races. And in a Sanskrit versequoted by Mr. Ellis in his preface to Campbell&rsquo;s Grammar of theTelugu language, the countries where the Paiśācī is said to haveprevailed are such border countries as Gāndhāra or Afghanistan,Nepal, Bāhlika or Balk, &amp;c¹.</p>
<p><strong>III THE GRAMMAR OF THE PRAKRITS</strong></p>
<p>We will now proceed to examine the Grammar of the Prakrits.As in the Pali, the dual and the dative case are wanting. Thetermination of the instr. pl. is <strong>हि</strong>, the other Pali <strong>भि</strong> having disappeared. The ablative pl. which was lost in the older dialectis made up by adding <strong>तो</strong>, Skr. <strong>तम्</strong>, to the <strong>हि</strong>of the instr. pl., whichwas used in Pali for the abl., and to <strong>सु</strong>, the termination of thelocative, and using <strong>हिन्तो</strong> and <strong>सुन्तो</strong> as the terminations for allnouns. This <strong>तो</strong> in the from of <strong>दो</strong>and <strong>दु</strong> is also used to form theabl. sing of all nouns. This is according to Vararuci. ButHemacandra gives <strong>दो</strong> and <strong>दु</strong> as the Śaurasenīterminations and <strong>ओ</strong>and <strong>उ</strong> as those in the principal Prakrit, which is according totheusual phonetic rules. The grammarian gives <strong>त्तो</strong>as an additional termination for both numbers, and <strong>ओ</strong>and <strong>उ</strong>to the pluralalso, and <strong>हिन्तो</strong>to the singular². In Prakrit, sometimes consonants are doubled even when there is no conjunct in the originalSanskrit. Hence we have <strong>त्तो</strong>; and the reason why this and <strong>दो</strong> and <strong>दु</strong> or <strong>ओ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong> are extended to the plural is that in Skr. the expression made up of a noun and this termination has both senses; as <strong>ग्रामतः</strong> may mean <em>from a village or villages</em>. The gen. sing. <strong>स्स</strong> from the <strong>स्य</strong> of Sanskrit nouns in <strong>अ</strong> is generalized as in Pali and applied to all masc. and neut. nouns; and the pl. is formed by the old Skr. term. <strong>नाम्</strong>, Prakritized to <strong>णं</strong>, as in the older dialect. The Pali pronominal abl. <strong>स्म</strong> or <strong>म्हा</strong> has disappeared and the loc.<strong>स्मि</strong> for fir has assumed the form of <strong>म्मि</strong> and is used for all nouns of the masc, and neut. genders as in the other language. The voc. pl. is as in Skr. and Pali the same as the nom. pl.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1. Names of other countries in Central or Southern India also occur ; butthe reading of the verse is evidently corrupt.</p>
<p>2. I shall in all my observations on the Prakrits follow Hemacandra, sinceheis full and explicit. Vararuci is indistinct in several cases, and hisrules on that account have been misunderstood by all writers who havefollowed him; and be is incomplete.</p>
<p><strong>Masculine Nouns in अ</strong></p>
<p>The nom., acc., and instr. cases of nouns in <strong>अ</strong> are the same as in Pali; but here the nom. pl. form <strong>वच्छा</strong> is optionally transferred to the acc. pl. also, thus giving another instance of the strong. tendency to confuse the nom, and acc. that I have spoken of The dat. sing. in <strong>आय</strong> like that in Pali, is preserved in solitary instances in which it has the sense of &quot; for the sake of &ldquo;. The abl. sing., besides the general forms mentioned above, has the old one ending in T, as in Pali, and a new one in <strong>आहि</strong> which is used in the plural also. This <strong>आहि</strong> is used in Sanskrit in the words <strong>दक्षिणाहि</strong> and उत्तराहि,<sup id="fnref1:130"><a href="#fn:130" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">130</a></sup>which have an ablative signification. It must in its origin be considered the same as the instr. termination <strong>भिस्</strong>. The loc, sing. besides the general form has, as in Pali, the old one in g. The voc. sing. has also the two Pali forms, <strong>देवा देवा</strong> and another <strong>देवो</strong> the same as the nom. sing.</p>
<p><strong>Masculine Nouns in द and उ</strong></p>
<p>The nom. pl. has a form made up according to the analogy of neuter nouns or nouns ending in <strong>इन्</strong>;as <strong>अग्गिणो</strong> and <strong>साहुणो</strong>, This does not exist in the Pali, the analogy being there extended to the gen. and loo. sing. only. The Prakrit has also the two Pali forms <strong>अग्गी</strong> and <strong>अग्गयो</strong>, which latter is transformed into <strong>जग्गओ</strong> and <strong>अग्गउ</strong> and <strong>साहु</strong> and <strong>साइवो</strong>, the latter appearing also in the form of <strong>साहओ</strong> and <strong>साहउ</strong>. The acc. pl. has also the neuter form for
<strong>अग्गिनो</strong> or <strong>साहुणो</strong> in addition to the Pali <strong>अग्गी</strong> or <strong>साहु</strong>. Besides the generalforms mentioned above, the abl. has in the sing, the neuter form <strong>अग्गिणो</strong> or <strong>साहुणों</strong> also. The Pali loc. sing. <strong>अग्गिाण</strong> does not appear.</p>
<p>The other forms of these nouns are like those in the older dialect. The voc. sing. is <strong>अग्गि</strong> or <strong>साहु</strong> as in Pali, and <strong>अग्गी</strong> Or <strong>साहू</strong>. We here see the analogy of neuter nouns or nouns ending in <strong>इन्</strong> extended to all vowel cases except the loc. sing.</p>
<p>Masculine Nouns in ऋ</p>
<p>Two bases, one ending in <strong>आर</strong> an as in <strong>भत्तार</strong> from <strong>भर्तृ</strong> and the other in <strong>उ</strong> as <strong>भत्तु</strong>, are used, the former throughout all the cases. and the latter in all except the sing. of the nom. and soc. The first is declined like nouns in <strong>अ</strong>, and the second like those in <strong>उ</strong> as <strong>साहु</strong>. The nom. sing. has also the old form <strong>भत्ता</strong>. In the Pali, you will remember, the first base is used in the plural of four cases, and the second in the gen. sing. only while the singulars of three cases have the old Sanskrit forms. Here the two bases. have been extended much further and one old form only, that of the nom, sing, remains. Nouns expressive of relationship such as <strong>पितृ, भ्रातृ</strong> and <strong>जामातृ</strong> are declined similarly, the final syllable <strong>आर</strong> being shortened to <strong>अर</strong> as it is in Sanskrit and Pali in those cases where the base is used. The voc. sing. is <strong>भत्त</strong>, and of the latter. cless of nouns it ends in <strong>अ</strong> or <strong>अरं</strong>, as <strong>पिअ</strong> or <strong>पिअरं</strong>.</p>
<p>Masculine Nouns in <strong>अन् अत</strong> ( present participle), <strong>वत्, मत्</strong> &amp;c.</p>
<p><strong>राजन्</strong> has four bases. The old one <strong>राजन्</strong> with the old Sanskrit forms only phonetically corrupted (<strong>ज्ञ्</strong> becoming <strong>ण्ण्</strong>) is used in all the singulars except that of the loc. and in the nom. pl.; as <strong>राआ, राआणी, राआणं, रण्णा, रण्णी</strong> and <strong>रणो</strong>. In Pali it is used in the loc. sing, and gen. pl. also. The second , Prakritised into , <strong>राअ</strong>, is used in both numbers of all cases except the nom. sing., and in Pali in all except the nom. sing. and pl. and the acc. pl. It is declined like a noun in <strong>अ</strong>; as <strong>राआ</strong> nom. pl., tri acc. sing., <strong>राआ-राऐ</strong> ace. pl., <strong>राएण</strong> instr. sing., &amp;o. The third, <strong>राजिन्</strong>, is employed in the gen. sing., in the older dialect; but here, as , in all cases. and numbers except the nom. sing. It is declined like an ordinary Sanskrit noun&rsquo;in <strong>इन्</strong> as <strong>राइणो</strong> nom, and acc. pl., <strong>राइणं</strong> acc. sing., <strong>राइणा</strong> instr. sing., &amp;c. The fourth is <strong>राजान</strong>, Pr.<strong>राआण</strong>, used in all cases and both numbers. Vararuci, however, does not give this, and omits the others in some of the cases. This base is unknownto Pali, but occurs in the word <strong>आत्मन्</strong> in the form of <strong>अत्ताण</strong>, and is used in the plurals of the instr. and loc,, while here it is extended</p>
<p>to all cases. This noun and such others ending in <strong>अन्</strong>are in thePrakrit declined like <strong>राजन्</strong>;the base in <strong>आण</strong>is general to all andused throughout, but the others occur in certain case only. Thevoc. sing, of <strong>राजन्</strong> is <strong>राअं</strong> or <strong>राअ</strong>in the Śaurasenī, the former ofwhich does not occur in the Mahārāṣṭrī.</p>
<p>The base of the present participles ends in <strong>अन्त</strong> and they aredoclined like nouns in <strong>अ</strong>. The Pali, you will remember, uses theold base in some of the cases and has the old forms; but here theyhave disappeared. Similarly <strong>वत् मत्</strong> become and <strong>वन्त</strong> and <strong>मन्त</strong>throughout, i. e., end in <strong>अ</strong>. Other final consonants are droppedand in feminine nouns sometimes <strong>आ</strong>is added.</p>
<p><strong>Feminine and Neuter Nouns</strong></p>
<p>The Prakrit feminine declension differs from the Pali in littlemore than a phonetic corruption of the terminations.</p>
<p>The <strong>य</strong> of the instr., abl., gen. and loc. of nouns in <strong>आ</strong>, and the<strong>या</strong> of those in <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>ई</strong>, are weakened into <strong>ए</strong> or
<strong>इ</strong>or dropped, leavingonly <strong>अ</strong>and <strong>आ</strong>. In the latter class of nouns this <strong>आ</strong> is furtheroptionally shortened to <strong>अ</strong>. Thus we have <strong>मालाए-इ-अ</strong>and <strong>नईए-इ-आ-अ</strong>,&amp;c.</p>
<p>The optional loc. forms in <strong>यं</strong> are lost; and the <strong>यो</strong>of thenom. plurals <strong>मालायो</strong> and <strong>नदियो</strong>leaves only the vowel <strong>ओ</strong>which isagain shortened to <strong>उ</strong>. The abl forms in <strong>दो-दु</strong>or <strong>ओ-उ</strong>are ofcourse new. Fem. nouns in <strong>ऋ</strong> substitute <strong>आ</strong> for the final andare declined like nouns in <strong>आ</strong>; as, <strong>नणन्दा, नणन्दाओ</strong>, &amp;c. <strong>मातृ</strong>,however, has another base <strong>मातरा</strong>when it signifies a &ldquo;goddess.&ldquo;In the Pali four bases are used, the old one, <strong>मातर</strong>, declined likemasc. nouns in <strong>अ, मातु,</strong> and <strong>माता</strong>. This last is used in the gen.pl. only along with <strong>मातराण</strong>, and <strong>मातूनं</strong>.</p>
<p>The nom. and acc. of neuter nouns in <strong>अ</strong>are in the Prakritthe same as in Skr. only phonetically corrupted, as <strong>वणं</strong>sing.,<strong>वणा-इँ-इं-णि</strong> pl.;while the sing. of those in <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong> have an anusvāra optionally attached to them, as <strong>दहि</strong> or <strong>दहिं</strong> a sing., दहीइँ-इ-णिं,pl. The optional Pali plurals in <strong>आ</strong>and <strong>ए</strong> are lost. Sanskrit neuternouns in <strong>अन्</strong> and <strong>अम्</strong> become nouns in <strong>अ</strong>, and are masculine.</p>
<p><strong>Pronouns</strong></p>
<p>The nom. pl. in <strong>ए</strong>is preserved, as in <strong>सव्ये, जे</strong> &amp;c. The gen. pl. has <strong>सिं</strong>for its termination formed by adding a light <strong>इ</strong> to the <strong>साम्</strong> of</p>
<p>Sanskrit, which, according to the usual rules, should be corrupted to <strong>सं</strong>, and is also fromed upon the model of the correspondingnouns as <strong>सव्वेसिं</strong> or <strong>सव्बाण-णं</strong>, <strong>जेसिं</strong>. or<strong>जाण-णं</strong>&amp;c. The Palihas <strong>सं</strong>,and its double gen. <strong>सानं</strong>is wanting. The loc. sing. has the termination <strong>स्सिं</strong>, a form not existing in the older dialect, in additionto the <strong>म्मि</strong>used for nouns, both of which are to be traced to theSkr. <strong>स्मिन्</strong> as in or <strong>सव्वस्सिं</strong>or <strong>सव्वम्मि, जस्सिं</strong> or <strong>जम्मि</strong> &amp;c. This <strong>स्सिं</strong>isfurther changed to <strong>हिं</strong>as in <strong>सव्वहिं, जहिं</strong>, &amp;c., or better, this lattermay be traced to the Pali <strong>म्हि</strong>. Another loc. sing. term. is <strong>त्थ</strong> whichreperesents <strong>त्र</strong>, as <strong>सव्वत्थ, जत्थ</strong> &amp;c. The abl. sing. <strong>स्मात्</strong> is optionallyused after <strong>किम्, यद</strong>, and <strong>तद्</strong>only in the form of<strong>म्हा</strong>, as <strong>कम्हा, जम्हा</strong>,and <strong>तम्हा</strong>; in Pali it is necessarily used after all pronouns. Inother respects pronouns are declined like the correspondingnouns; as <strong>सव्वं, सव्वे</strong>acc.,<strong>सव्वेण सव्वेहिं</strong> Instr., <strong>सव्वत्तो-दो-दु, सव्वाहिन्तो-सुन्तों</strong> abl. The instr. sing. is optionally formed like that of nounsing <strong>इ</strong> in the case of some; as <strong>इमिणा, जिणा</strong>&amp;c.</p>
<p>You will thus observe, that except in the nom. pl., there is nodistinction between the two declensions; the peculiar pronominalforms I have mentioned being only optional. Of the fem. of<strong>तद्, यद्</strong>, and <strong>किम्</strong>, the gen. sing. is optionally <strong>तिस्सा</strong> or <strong>तीसे</strong> &amp;c.,where the base is <strong>ती</strong>&amp;c. The other forms are like those of nounsin <strong>ई</strong>. as <strong>तीआ-ई-ए</strong> &amp;c. This base is used throughout along with theother in <strong>आ</strong>. In Pali it is used in the gen. and loc. sing. onlyalong with the other, and the gen forms are <strong>तिस्सा</strong> and <strong>तिस्साय</strong>,the latter of which is, as I have said, a double genitive. Thisthe Prakrit has preserved in the form of <strong>तीसे</strong>,originally <strong>तिस्से</strong>,where the <strong>ए</strong> represents the <strong>य</strong> of the older dialect, as it does in thefeminine nouns. The other base of <strong>किम्</strong>and <strong>तद्</strong> has also itsgenitive singular in स, as <strong>तास</strong>, formed by transferring the masc.termination or it is to be traced to <strong>तस्सा</strong>. The genitive pluralforms of the masc., such as <strong>तेसिं</strong>and <strong>ताण</strong>, are also sometimes usedin a feminine sense. The loc. sing. of <strong>किम्, यद्</strong>,and <strong>तद्</strong>is optionallyformed by extending the masc. termination <strong>हिं</strong>to the base in <strong>आ</strong>,as <strong>ताहिं</strong>&amp;c. These peculiarities are only optional; so that thefeminine pronouns are declined like nouns in <strong>आ</strong>or <strong>ई</strong>. Thus wehave <strong>जा, जाओ-उ, जीओ-उ</strong> nom., <strong>जं, जाओ-उ, जीओ-उ</strong> acc., जिणा, जाहिं,जीहिंinstr., <strong>जादो-दु जीदो-दु,जाहिन्तो सुन्तो, जीहिन्तो सुन्तो</strong> &amp;c. abl. <strong>जस्सा,जिस्सा, जीसे, जासं, जेसिं, जाण, जीसिं, जीणं</strong>gan., <strong>जाहिं, जासु, जीसु</strong>loc.</p>
<p>The optional instr., abl., gen., and loc. singulars are <strong>जाए-इ-अ</strong> and<strong>जीए-इ-आ-अ</strong>.</p>
<p>The pronoun <strong>न</strong> in the form of <strong>ण</strong> exists as in the Pali; <strong>इदम्</strong> hastwo bases, <strong>इम</strong>, which is used throughout, as <strong>इमो, इमे</strong>nom., <strong>इमं, इमे</strong> acc.,**इमेण-मिणा, इमेहि,**instr. &amp;c; and <strong>अ</strong> from which we have optionally <strong>अअं</strong> nom. sing., <strong>अस्स</strong>and <strong>अस्सि</strong>, gen. and loc. sing, and <strong>एहिं</strong>and <strong>एसु</strong>instr., and loc. plural, and <strong>आहिं</strong> instr. pl. of the feminine.<strong>इमो, इमस्स, इमस्सिं</strong> &amp;c. are also in use. The base <strong>अ</strong> is used in thePali in the instr. sing., gen pl. and abl. sing. also.</p>
<p>The demonstrative <strong>अदस्</strong>, has one base only, <strong>असु</strong>, which is declined like nouns in <strong>उ</strong>;as <strong>अमू, अमुणो</strong>nom., <strong>अमुं अमुणो</strong> acc., <strong>अमुणा, अमूहिं</strong>instr., &amp;c.</p>
<p>The pronoun of the second person has, according to Vararuci,five bases <strong>त, तुम्</strong> or <strong>तुम, तुज्झ, तुम्ह, तुम्म, वो</strong> and <strong>भे</strong>. The first is derived from the त्व of <strong>त्वम्;तुम्</strong> or <strong>तुम</strong> from the same with the <strong>व</strong> softenedto <strong>उ</strong>; <strong>तुज्झ</strong> from <strong>तुभ्यम्</strong> through the intermediate Pali from <strong>तुम्हं</strong>,the last conjunct of which is changed to <strong>ज्झ</strong>, by a rule formerlygiven; <strong>तुम्ह</strong> is made up by putting together the <strong>तु</strong> of the singularand the <strong>स्म</strong> of the plural, as explained in going over the Pali; <strong>तुम्म</strong>is another form of <strong>तुम्ह; वो</strong> is the old Sanskrit <strong>वम्</strong>; and <strong>भे</strong> seems to bederived from the <strong>म्हे</strong> of <strong>तुम्हे</strong> as <strong>वव्भण</strong> is from <strong>ब्राह्मण</strong>. Hemacandraadds <strong>तुब्भ</strong>, to be derived from the Sanskrit <strong>तुभ्यम्</strong> or from <strong>तुम्ह,म्ह</strong>being changed to <strong>ब्भउज्झ</strong>, from <strong>तुज्झ</strong> by the dropping of <strong>त्; तुम्ह</strong>and उय्ह, other forms of <strong>तुभ्यम्</strong>;<strong>तुव</strong>, from <strong>त्व</strong> by the insertion of <strong>उ</strong>; <strong>तुह</strong>,from <strong>तुय्हं; उम्ह</strong>, by the dropping of the <strong>त्</strong> of <strong>तुम्ह</strong>; and <strong>उब्भ</strong>, by treating<strong>तुब्भ</strong> in the same way. The Pali has only a, <strong>त, तु</strong>, and तुम्ह; and theseveral old forms it had are lost in the Prakrit.</p>
<p>Nominal terminations are used in a good many cases. Thuswe have <strong>तं, तुं, तुवं, तुह</strong>, and <strong>तुमं</strong> for the nom. sing., these and <strong>तुए</strong>and<strong>तुमे</strong> for the acc. sing., <strong>तइ, तए, तुमइ, तुमए, तुमे, तुमाइ</strong>, and also <strong>तुमं, भे,ते, दे</strong>, and <strong>दि</strong> for the instr. sing. The form <strong>तुमं</strong> properly belongs to the nom.and acc. cases and to the gen., <strong>दे</strong> and <strong>दि</strong>being only <strong>ते</strong> softened; but several cases are here confounded. Theabl sing. has <strong>तइत्तो-ओ-उ-दो-दु-हि-हिन्तो, तुवत्तो-ओ</strong> &amp;c. <strong>तुमत्तो-ओ</strong> &amp;c.,<strong>तुब्भत्तो-ओ</strong>&amp;c. <strong>तुम्हत्तो-ओ</strong> &amp;c., <strong>तुज्झत्तो-ओ</strong> &amp;c. also <strong>तुय्ह, तुब्भ, तुम्ह</strong>, and<strong>तुज्झ</strong>. The gen. sing. has twenty-one. forms, <em>viz.</em> <strong>तइतुं, ते, तुह, तुहं, तुव, ढम, ढमे, तुमां, इ, दि, इ, ए, तुब्भ, उब्भ, उय्ह, तुम्ह, तुज्झ, उम्ह,</strong></p>
<p>and <strong>उज्झ</strong>. The loc. sing has <strong>तुमे, तुमए तुमाइ तइ, तए, तुम्मि, तुवम्मि, तुहम्मि,तुम्भम्मि, तुम्हम्मि</strong> and <strong>तुज्झम्मि</strong>. The plurals are as follows:—<strong>भे, तुब्भे,उज्झे तुम्ह तुय्हे, उय्हे, तुम्हे, तुज्झे</strong> nom. <strong>वो तुब्भे, उज्झे, तुम्हे, तुज्झे, तुय्हे, उय्हे,भे</strong> acc., <strong>भे, तुब्भेहिं,तुज्झेहिं, तुम्हेहिं, उज्झेहिं, उम्हेहिं,तुय्हेहिं</strong>and <strong>उय्हेहिं</strong> instr.;<strong>तुब्भतो दो-दु-हिन्तो-सुन्तो, तुय्हत्तो-दो</strong> &amp;c., <strong>उय्हत्तो-दो</strong> &amp;c., <strong>उम्हत्तो-दो</strong> &amp;c.,तुम्हत्तो-दो &amp;c.and <strong>तुज्झत्तो-दो</strong> &amp;c. abl; <strong>भे, तुय्ह, तुब्भ, उब्भ, तुब्भाण-णं तुवाण-णं,तुमाण-णं, तुहाण-णं, तुम्हाण-णं, तुम्ह, तुज्झ, उम्ह, उज्झ,तुज्झाण-णं</strong>, gen.; <strong>तुसु, तुव-वेसु, तुम-मेसु, तुह-हेसु तुब्भ-ब्भा-ब्भेसु,तुम्ह म्हा-म्हेसु,तुज्झ-ज्झा-ज्झेसु</strong> loc.</p>
<p>The points to be observed in these forms are these. The nom.sing, has mostly the same forms as the acc. sing. This is due tothe fact that the Sanskrit <strong>त्वाम्</strong>of the acc. becomes, when the <strong>आ</strong>is shortened by a Prakrit phonetic rule, <strong>त्वं</strong>, <em>i. e.</em>, the same as thenom. sing. Hence its Prakrit representatives <strong>तं, तुं, तुवं</strong> at and <strong>तुमं</strong>are the same for both the cases. But a more probable reason,which explains a similar fact in the case of the first personalpronoun also, is that the plurals of the nom, and acc. having bynatural processes already explained become exactly alike, thetwo cases came to be confounded; and the sing. forms also of theone were used for the other. The forms as, <strong>तइ, तए, तुमइ, तुमए, तुमे</strong>, and <strong>तुमाइ</strong>are common to the instr, and loc. sing. This probably arisesfrom the fact that the Sanskrit <strong>त्वया</strong>, when the <strong>य</strong>is softened to <strong>ए</strong>or <strong>इ</strong>, becomes <strong>तए</strong>or <strong>तइ</strong>, and so does the <strong>त्वयि</strong>of the loc.; and whenthe base <strong>त</strong> is seen to be interchangeable with <strong>तुम</strong> in the nom., theterminations <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>इ</strong> which are common to the two cases areapplied to <strong>तुम</strong> also. <strong>ते</strong>and its softened forms <strong>दे</strong> and <strong>दि</strong>, and <strong>तइ</strong>arecommon to the instr, and gen. sing.; <strong>तुय्ह, तुब्भ, तुम्ह, तुज्झ</strong> are common to the abl. sing. and the gen. sing. and pl.; and <strong>भे</strong>to the instr. sing. and pl. and the gen. sing.</p>
<p>Such a confusion of the case-relations must be expected incourse of time. Even in Sanskrit the gen. and instr. &amp;c. areused alike in connection with some participles and the identification of the abl. and the instr. we have already noticed in thePrakrits. The gen. forms <strong>तुय्ह, तुब्भ, तुय्ह, तुज्झ, उब्भ, उम्ह,</strong> and <strong>उज्झ</strong>,all derived from the Sanskrit dat. <strong>तुभ्यम्</strong>and referred to the gen.when that case was lost, are taken as bases, and the terminations<strong>ए</strong> of the nom, and acc. pl., <strong>हि</strong>of the instr. pl., <strong>त्तो, दो, दु, ओ</strong>and <strong>उ</strong> ofthe abl., <strong>ण</strong>or <strong>णं</strong> ot of the gen. pl., and <strong>स्मि</strong>and <strong>सु</strong> of the loc. sing. and</p>
<p>pl. are tacked on to them to form these cases. Here the tendencyto use the genitive form as a base for the formation of the othercases, a trace of which only we observed in the Pali, is seenmore developed.</p>
<p>The pronoun of the first person has, according to Vararuci,the following bases:— <strong>हं</strong> or <strong>अहं</strong> and <strong>म</strong>from the Sanskrit singulars,<strong>मम</strong> the gen. sing., <strong>अम्ह</strong> from <strong>अस्म</strong> and <strong>णो</strong> from <strong>नस्</strong>of which <strong>अम्ह</strong>is used in the plural. Hemacandra adds <strong>मह</strong>and <strong>मज्झ</strong> from <strong>मह्यम्</strong>and <strong>भे</strong>from <strong>म्हे</strong> or <strong>स्मे</strong>. He also gives <strong>अम्हि, अम्मि</strong>, and <strong>म्मि</strong> for thenom, and <strong>अम्मि</strong>for acc. sing. The first is clearly from <strong>अस्मि</strong>1stpers. sing. present of <strong>अस्</strong>, often used in Sanskrit as an indeclinableparticle; and the others are also corruptions of the sanie, just asthe termination <strong>म्मि</strong>of the loc. is a corruption of <strong>स्मिन्</strong>. Thesingular forms, therefore, are:— <strong>अम्मि, म्मि, अम्हि, हं, अहं, अहयं</strong>nom.;<strong>णे, णं, मि, अम्मि, अम्ह, मम्ह, मं, ममं, मिमं अहं</strong> acc.; <strong>मि, मे, ममं ममए, ममाइ,मइ, मए, मयाइ, णे,</strong> instr.; <strong>मइत्तो-दो-दु-ओ-उ-हि-हिन्तो, ममत्तो, महत्तो</strong> &amp;c.,<strong>मज्झत्तो</strong> &amp;c. abl; <strong>मे, मह, मम, मह, महं, मज्झ, मज्झं, अम्ह, अम्हं</strong> gen.; <strong>मि, मइ,ममाइ, मए, मे, अहम्मि, ममम्मि, महम्मि</strong> loc. The plurals are:— <strong>अम्ह, अम्हे,अम्हो, मो,वयं मे</strong> nom. <strong>अम्हे अम्हो, अम्ह, णे</strong> acc.;<strong>अम्हेहिं, अम्हाहि, अम्ह, अम्हे,णे</strong> instr. ; <strong>ममत्तो, अम्हतो, ममाहिन्तो-सुन्तो, अम्हाहिन्तो सुन्तो, ममेसुन्तो, अम्हे,सुन्तो</strong> abl; <strong>णे, णो, मज्झ, अम्ह, अम्हं, अम्हो, अंम्हाण, ममाण, महाण, मज्झाण</strong>gen.; <strong>अम्ह-म्हा-म्हेसु-मम-मेसु, मह-हेमु, मज्झ-ज्झेसु</strong> loc. Here also the sameobservations as those made in the case of the last pronoun areapplicable.</p>
<p>In the Māgadhī the <strong>ओ</strong>of the nom. sing. of nouns ending in <strong>अ</strong>is replaced by <strong>ए</strong> as <strong>एशे पुलिशे</strong> for <strong>एष पुरुषः</strong>. The <strong>स्स</strong> of the gen.sing. is sometimes changed to <strong>ह</strong>and the preceding <strong>अ</strong>is lengthened;as शोणिदाह कुम्भे for <strong>शोणितस्य कुम्भः</strong>.The plural of this case isformed by adding <strong>आहं</strong>, as <strong>कम्माहं</strong> for <strong>कर्मणाम्</strong>, The anusvārarepresents the <strong>ण</strong>of the original termination <strong>आण</strong>, and <strong>ह</strong> is introduced from the analogy of the sing. The regular forms <strong>शोणिदस्स</strong>and <strong>कम्माणं</strong> are also admissible. Such forms as these we shallmeet with hereafter; and they belong to a later stage in the decayof our grammar.</p>
<p><strong>IV. THE PRAKRIT VERB</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Conjugations*:—All the Skr. conjugations, with the exceptionof the second in the case of a few roots ending in a vowel, have</li>
</ul>
<p>been brought over to the <strong>अ</strong>type, <em>i. e</em>., to the first, sixth, and thetenth. Some of the others have left a few traces; as, the fifth andthe ninth have preserved their <strong>ण</strong> in such instances as <strong>सुण, किण, जाण, लुण, पुण, धुण,</strong>— both conjugations being, as you mayremember, confounded in the Pali, the third the root <strong>बीह</strong>—pres.tense <strong>वीहदि</strong>—the <strong>इ</strong> standing for <strong>भ</strong>; the fourth has preserved its <strong>य</strong>assimilated in a good many roots such as <strong>णच्च, बुज्झ, जुज्झ, तुट्ट, नस्स</strong>&amp;c.; and the seventh has preserved its <strong>न्</strong> in <strong>रुन्ध</strong> and others. But you will see that to these forms <strong>अ</strong>is added and they are made roots ending in <strong>अ</strong>; while a greatmany have lost even such traces. In the Pali, you will remember,the conjugational signs added to some of the roots are entire, asthe <strong>ना</strong>of the sixth and the <strong>नो</strong>of the fifth, and <strong>अ</strong> is appended toroots of the seventh conjugation only, <strong>न्</strong> being inserted before thethe last consonant. But here the at takes the place of the endingvowel of the signs of the fifth and other conjugation also, so wehave <strong>सुण, कीण</strong>, and <strong>बीह</strong>.</p>
<p>Thus in the Prakrit most roots end in <strong>अ</strong>. There are some endingin other vowels, such as <strong>हो</strong>and <strong>ठा</strong>, but the rule of conjugation isthe same for all, viz., to add the terminations to the root directly.There can be no consonantal root. Some forms, such as those of<strong>अम्</strong>, have come down from the parent language only phoneticallychanged; but these are not formed in the Prakrit. They are reallySanskrit forms in what I have ventured to call a petrified condition. The roots ending in <strong>अ</strong>change it to optionally, <em>i. e</em>. theyare conjugated according to the model of the first and of the tenth,as is the case to a great extent in the Pali also. The distinctionbetween the special and the general tenses is of course forgotten.</p>
<p>The Prakrits have retained the Present and Future tenses andthe Imperative mood entire; while the Potential and the Aoristhave left the third person singular only. An isolated form ofthe Imperfect such as <strong>आसि</strong> from the root <strong>अस्</strong>remains.</p>
<p>The terminations of the Present Tense are— 3rd pers. sing. <strong>दि</strong>and <strong>दे</strong> in Śaur. and <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>ए</strong> in the principal Prakrit, pl. <strong>न्ति</strong>and <strong>न्ते</strong>;2nd pers. sing. <strong>सि</strong>and <strong>से</strong>, pl. <strong>इत्था</strong>and <strong>ह</strong> for which last the Śaur.has <strong>ध</strong>; 1st pers. sing. <strong>मि</strong>, pl. <strong>मो, मु</strong>, and <strong>म</strong>.</p>
<p>Of these <strong>दे</strong>, or <strong>ए, से,</strong> and <strong>न्ते</strong>, of which the last is not given by</p>
<p>Vararuci, are remnants of the old Ātmanepada, and the firsttwo are used after roots ending in <strong>अ</strong> only. With the exceptionof the first pers. pl. <strong>म</strong>and the 2nd pers. pl. <strong>इत्था</strong>, the terminationscan readily be traced to the corresponding Skr. Parasm. TheSanskrit 2nd pers. pl. <strong>थ</strong>becomes <strong>ध</strong> in the Śaurasenīand <strong>ह</strong> in theMahārāṣṭrīby the phonetic rules already noticed, and <strong>मो</strong>or itsshortened form <strong>मु</strong> is the Skr. <strong>मम्</strong>. In these points the primitiveand derived languages perfectly agree; but <strong>म</strong> and <strong>इत्था</strong> are newterminations and were first used in Pali, the latter however in theform of <strong>त्थ</strong>. The first is, as I have observed, transferred from theImperative and other tensos, and <strong>त्थ</strong> is the Skr. <strong>स्थ</strong> 2nd pers. pl. ofroot <strong>अस्</strong>. To this is prefixed in the Prakrit the usual augment <strong>इ</strong>,which <strong>मो</strong> and <strong>मु</strong> also take optionally. The terminations <strong>मो</strong> and <strong>मु</strong>are unknown to the Pali.</p>
<p>Other forms of the first pors. sing. and pl., made up by adding<strong>म्हि</strong> and <strong>म्ह</strong> or <strong>म्हो</strong>, as in <strong>करोम्हि, करेम्ह, गच्छम्ह</strong> &amp;c., ocour in theplays, though the grammarians have not noticed them. Theseterminations are evidently the Skr. <strong>स्मि</strong>, 1st pers. sing., and <strong>स्मः</strong> or <strong>स्म</strong>,pl. of <strong>अस्</strong>¹. You will remember that a good many verbs aremade up in the Pali by adding forms of this root. Hemacandranotices also another termination of the 3rd pers. pl. <em>viz</em>. <strong>इरे</strong>, whichis transferred from the Perfect.</p>
<p>The Imperative forms are made up by adding <strong>दु</strong> Śaur. <strong>उ</strong>Prakrit, 3rd pers. sing., and <strong>न्तु</strong> pl.; <strong>सु</strong> and <strong>हि</strong> 2nd pers. sing. and <strong>ध</strong>Śaur., <strong>इ</strong> Prakrit, pl.: and <strong>मु</strong> 1st pers. sing. and <strong>मो</strong> pl. The originalform of the root ending in <strong>अ</strong> is also used as the second pers. sing.Of these <strong>टु, न्तु, हि</strong> or अand <strong>सु</strong> from स्व Ātm. are both Skr. and Pali;<strong>ह</strong> (Skr. <strong>थ</strong>) transferred from the Present is used in Pali; but <strong>मु</strong> and<strong>मो</strong> are peculiar to the Prakrit, the Pali using only the termination of its present. Of these <strong>मो</strong> istransferred from the PrakritPresent, and <strong>मु</strong> is made up by adding the <strong>उ</strong> which is peculiar tothe Imperative and distinguishes it from the present. The firstpers. pl. takes <strong>म</strong> also sometimes as in the Pali, but it is not noticedby the grammarians.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1. Prof. Lassen traces these to the root <strong>अस्</strong>, but <strong>इत्था</strong> to the Skr. <strong>थ</strong> to which<strong>त्</strong> is, he says, prefixed because the previous vowel must have been pronounced with some accent. But considering that many forms of <strong>अस्</strong>are used asterminations it is more natural to take this also as such a form.</p>
<p>The consciousness that the future is made up by prefixing <strong>स्य = स्स</strong>Pr. &amp; Pali to the terminations of the present has never beenlost, and whatever changes these terminations undergo are transferred to the future; so that the Śaurasenīand Māgadhī futurediffers from the Pali in those respects only in which the Presenttenses of the two differ. The <strong>मि</strong> of the first person sing., however,is optionally changed to an anusvāra; or the anusvära may be aremnant of the conditional terminations; as <strong>हसिस्सं</strong>.In the prineipal Prakrit the <strong>स्य</strong> is still further corrupted to <strong>हि, य</strong> being dissolved into <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>स्</strong>changed to <strong>ह</strong>, as in <strong>होहिह</strong>for <strong>भविष्यति, होहिन्ति, भविष्यन्ति</strong>, &amp;c. In the first pers. we have, in addition to this <strong>हि, स्स</strong> which is lengthened as in Skr. and also its other form <strong>हा</strong>aswell as <strong>स्सं</strong> for the whole as in the Śaurasenī, <em>i e.</em>, <strong>होहि-स्सा-हामि</strong>or <strong>होहिस्सं</strong>, &amp;c. A beginning in the direction of the <strong>हि</strong>was, youwill remember, made in Pali. We have also a few petrified Skr.forms such as <strong>दच्छं</strong> for <strong>द्रक्ष्यामि मोच्छं</strong> for <strong>मोक्ष्यामि</strong> which are more conditional than future in their origin; and to these as bases, areadded the terminations of the present and also of the future toform new futures: as <strong>दच्छिइ दच्छिहिइ</strong>, &amp;c. We have also <strong>काहे</strong>and <strong>दाहं</strong>from <strong>कृ</strong>and <strong>दा</strong>.</p>
<p>The only Potential form left is that of the 3rd pers. sing.; as <strong>हसेज्ज</strong>or <strong>हसेज्जा, होज्ज</strong>or <strong>होज्जा</strong>. The termination is the same as in Pali, the<strong>य्य</strong> of the 3rd pers. sing. being altered to <strong>ज</strong>, and the general formof the termination <strong>य्या</strong> to <strong>ज्जा</strong>. After bases ending in <strong>अ, ज्ज</strong> or <strong>ज्जा</strong>becomes <strong>एज्ज</strong>or <strong>एज्जा</strong>, as in skr. and Pali¹. This being an isolatedform and derived from the Potential, which does not signify anyparticular time, it is used in the sense of the Present, Future, orImperative in all numbers and persons; and after roots in <strong>अ</strong> theterminations <strong>सु</strong> and <strong>हि</strong>of the second pers. sing. of the Imperativeare added to to <strong>ज्ज</strong> make up new forms of that mood, as <strong>हसेज्जसु, हसेज्जहि</strong>; and another form <strong>हसेज्जे</strong> is also mentioned². This Potentialform of roots ending in vowels other than is used as a base,and the terminations of the two tenses and one mood are attachedto it to make up now forms for them as <strong>होज्जइ, होज्जाइ होज्जउ,होजाउ</strong>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1. This fact strongly supports my derivation of the forms. Prof. Lassenderives them from the Precative. But the Precative was lost at an earlystage, since it does not exist even in the Pall. The <strong>ए</strong> is not the <strong>अय</strong>of the10th conj, as the Prof. thinks, but the <strong>ए</strong>, which bases ending in <strong>अ</strong>take inthe Pot. in Skr.</p>
<p>2. Prof. Lassen derives these also from the Precative, and against theargument that that mood is rarely used in Skr. itself and was lost in thePali states that the Precative is found in the Vernaculars. But I have notfound it. The forms <strong>करजे, करजी</strong> G.‚<strong>करिये, कंरियो</strong> H.IItrace to the PrakritPotential forms spoken of above.</p>
<p>The Aorist also has left its 3rd pers. sing. only; the termination to be added to roots ending in a vowel, is <strong>सी, ही</strong>, or <strong>हीअ</strong> and<strong>ईअ</strong> to those ending in a consonant or <strong>अ</strong>, <em>i. e.</em>, such as take theaugment <strong>इ</strong> or change the <strong>अ</strong>to <strong>इ</strong>. Of these, <strong>सी</strong>and <strong>ही</strong> are derivedfrom the Parasm. <strong>सीत्</strong>of the fourth form; the first is found inPali, and <strong>ही</strong> is only another form of it. The Pali has <strong>ई</strong> also forthe 3rd pers. sing. corresponding to the <strong>ईत्</strong>affixed to Sanskritroots that take the augment <strong>इ</strong>. This is very likely the origin of<strong>ईअ</strong> also, since we have it after the roots which necessarily admitthe augment; but the <strong>अ</strong>of this and of <strong>हीअ</strong>is difficult to explain.<strong>हीअ</strong>must correspond to some such form as <strong>सीय</strong> or <strong>सीत</strong> which, the<strong>म्</strong> being dropped after the augment <strong>इ</strong>, is reduced to <strong>ईअ</strong>. These<strong>सीय</strong> and <strong>सीत</strong> are forms of the Potential Ātm. of <strong>अम्</strong>, and they mayhave been added as terminations to form the Aorist as otherforms of <strong>अस्</strong>are in this and other tenses in the Pali. Or the <strong>सी</strong>of the Aorist may have been confounded with <strong>सीत</strong>the pot. of <strong>अम्</strong>from its resemblance to it.</p>
<p>These are rare and isolated forms, and past time is mostlyexpressed by the past participle passive which in the case ofintransitive and some transitive verbs has also an active sense.The Sanskrit termination <strong>त</strong>is only phonetically changed to <strong>द</strong>inthe ŚaurasenĀand to <strong>अ</strong> in the Prakrit. Roots ending in <strong>अ</strong>changeit to <strong>इ</strong> before the past participial termination. The past participlesof some roots are not newly formed, but the old Skr. forms havecome down only phonetically altered. This fact should alwaysbe remembered, that there are in all these derived dialects newformations called by Hemacandra <strong>साध्यावस्थ</strong>, as well as old formations, <strong>सिद्धावस्थ</strong>. This arises from the fact of the analogies notbeing made applicable throughout, as they would have been ifthe languages had been artificial Contingency or condition isexpressed by the present participle, as we do in our modernvernaculars.</p>
<p>The infinitive is formed as in Skr. by the addition of
<strong>तुम्</strong>changed to <strong>उं</strong>, the Pali <strong>तवे</strong>being lost, and the absolutive by affixingthe termination <strong>ऊण</strong> (<strong>दूण</strong> Śaurasenī) from the Pali <strong>तू</strong>and theVedic <strong>त्वान</strong>or <strong>त्वीन</strong>. But the termination that is most used in theŚaurasenīis <strong>इअ</strong>from the Sanskrit <strong>य</strong> of roots with prepositionsprefixed. Hemacandra also gives for the principal Prakrit <strong>तूण</strong>and <strong>तुआण</strong>, the origin of which is the same as that of <strong>ऊण, त्ता</strong>from<strong>त्वा, तु,</strong> by the dissolution of the semi-vowel of <strong>त्वा, तुम्,</strong> by a confusion with the infinitive, and <strong>इअ</strong>which is used in the Śaurasenī.Of these, however, <strong>ऊण</strong>is the one that prevails; the others are rare.</p>
<p>The passive is formed by adding <strong>ईय</strong> and <strong>इज्ज</strong>,both of whichcome from the Sanskrit with the augment <strong>इ</strong>prefixed as in Pali, the <strong>य</strong>being transformed to <strong>ज्ज</strong> in one case and leaving its <strong>अ</strong> onlyin the other or being dissolved into <strong>इअ</strong>. Hemacandra gives agood many roots which preserve the Skr. forms, only phoneticallychanged as <strong>दीसइ</strong> from <strong>दृश्यते, वुच्चइ</strong>from <strong>उच्यते, गम्मइ</strong> from <strong>गम्यतेलब्भइ</strong>from <strong>लभ्यते, बज्झइfrom बध्यते</strong> &amp;c.</p>
<p>The causol terminations are <strong>ए</strong> from <strong>अय</strong>and <strong>आवे</strong>from <strong>आपय</strong>.These two are the same as in the Pali, the Sanskrit forms, alsoexisting in the latter, being lost. Hemacandra adds <strong>अ</strong>and <strong>आव</strong>,<em>i. e</em>., the <strong>ए</strong>, answering to <strong>अय</strong>, is lost. But the Sanskrit vowelchanges are preserved even when the <strong>अय</strong> gives place to <strong>अ</strong>; as<strong>दरिसइ</strong>.</p>
<p>The terminations of the absolutive, the infinitive, the potentialparticiple ( <strong>अव्व</strong> from Skr. <strong>तव्य</strong>), and of the Future take theaugment <strong>इ</strong> which also is transformed into a short <strong>ए</strong>of the samenature as that which is found before conjunct consonants, as in <strong>पेण्ड</strong>or <strong>पिण्ड</strong>. We have thus <strong>हसिऊण</strong> or<strong>इसेऊण, हसिडं</strong> or <strong>हसेउं</strong>&amp;c.</p>
<p>You will thus have observed a much greater progress in theoperation of those principles, which we found at work in theconstruction of the Pali. Here as before we find that the lessknown forms are made up on the model of the more known. Thenumber of old forms which still remained in some of the Palideclensions and conjugations, has been greatly reduced in thePrakrits, and a further advance been made in the introductionof uniformity and simplicity in the grammar of the language.</p>
<p>It is also worthy of remark, that in a great measure, the samefalse analogies which are used in the Pali have come down tothe Prakrit, and their range extended. Thus the analogy ofnouns in <strong>इन्</strong> or neuter nouns in <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>उ</strong> has been carried muchfurther in the declension of masculine nouns ending in <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>उ</strong>.Nouns in <strong>ऋ, अन्</strong> and <strong>वत्</strong> have adapted themselves more closely tothe model of those ending in <strong>अ</strong>, their Sanskrit nom. casesupplying the new <strong>अ</strong>base; and the <strong>अ</strong> conjugations have moregenerally prevailed over the rest. The device of using such caseforms as <strong>मम</strong>and <strong>मह्यम्</strong> as bases, and making up the cases byappending the proper terminations has also been more largelyavailed of. Some of these phenomena may be attributed to theoperation of the same invariable laws in the development ofeither, without being an index to a more intimate connectionbetween the two dialects. But there are individual forms in thetwo languages which, though they might be different, are yet thesame in both. Such, for instance, are <strong>वच्छे</strong> acc. pl., the loc. sing.ending in the pronominal <strong>म्हि</strong> or <strong>म्मि</strong>, the double gen. <strong>तिस्साय</strong>, the2nd pers. pl. ending in <strong>इत्था</strong>of the present tense, and a good manyothers. The consonantal and vowel changes also, so far as theygo in the older language, are the same. We may therefore safelyconclude that the Pali represents generally an earlier stage of thesame language which afterwards became the Prakrit or Prakrits.</p>
<p>But there are again in the Prakrits such forms as those of theablative in <strong>दो</strong> and <strong>आहि</strong> instead of the old pronominal <strong>म्हा</strong>, the firstpers. pl. of the Pres. in <strong>मो</strong>or <strong>मु</strong> instead of the Pali <strong>म</strong>, the 1st pers.sing. of the Imperative in <strong>मु</strong>instead of the Pali <strong>मि</strong>, the Śaurasenīabsolutive in <strong>इअ</strong>corresponding to the Sanskrit <strong>य</strong>, which does notexist in the older dialect, and others. These Prakrit forms cannothave been developed out of the Pali forms, but must have grownindependently from the Sanskrit originals.</p>
<p>In the same way, though the Prakrit sounds are generallythe same as, or further developments, of the Pali sounds, thereare a good many which could not have grown out of the latter.Thus the <strong>रि</strong> of the Prakrit words <strong>रिद्धि, रिच्छ, रिण, रिजु</strong>, &amp;c. cannothave been developed out of the <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>अ</strong> of the Pali <strong>इद्धि, अच्छ, अण,उजू</strong> &amp;c, or the <strong>अइ</strong> and <strong>अउ</strong>of such words as <strong>दइच्च, भइरव, पउर कउसल</strong>,</p>
<p>&amp;c., from the <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong>of the corresponding Pali words, or the<strong>ण्ण्</strong> for Sanskrit <strong>ज्ञ्</strong>from the Pali <strong>ञ्ञ्</strong>, though this latter exista insome of the Prakrit dialects, or the <strong>रिस</strong>for <strong>र्श</strong> or र्ष in such wordsas<strong>आअरिस सुदरिसण वरिसे</strong>, and <strong>परामरिस</strong> from the <strong>स्स</strong> or <strong>स</strong> of the Pali<strong>आदास, सुदस्सन, वस्स</strong>, and <strong>परामस</strong>. The Prakrit sounds must in thesecases be traced directly to the corresponding Sanskrit sounds.</p>
<p>It therefore appears that the Prakrits had also an independentdevelopment, which may be accounted for on the supposition,that they sprang not from the Pali but a sister dialect or dialects;or that, though originally they were the same as the Pali, theirsubsequent development was influenced by the parent language,and thus, other sounds and forms not existing in the earlierdialect, came in fresh from Sanskrit. But the first supposition isdiscountenanced by the fact that the resemblance between thePali and the Prakrits extends even to isolated cases; and thesecond is supported by the circumstance that in one importantparticular, the Prakrits resemble the Sanskrit in the last stage ofits development, while the Pali differs in that particular fromboth and agrees with an earlier form of the parent language.We have seen that in later Sanskrit verbal forms, especially ofthe past tenses were rarely used, and participles were employedinstead; and we find that the Prakrits have mostly lost all theSanskrit tenses and moods except three, and past time is generallyexpressed by the past participle and contingency by the present;while the Pali has, as we have seen, preserved eight, includingall the past tenses and the conditional. Middle Sanskrit bearsto later or Classical Sanskrit the same relation, in this respect,that the Pali bears to the Prakrits. The change that came overSanskrit between the two periods left its impress on what maybe called the Vernacular speech. This could not have been thecase, unless Sanskrit had continued to influence that form ofspeech, represented first by the Pali and afterwards by thePrakrits. And it was because it continued so to influence it,that the Prakrits came to have sounds and grammatical formsalso derived direct from Sanskrit and not through the Pali. Thisleads to the conclusion, which will be developed in detail in thelast lecture, that when the Pali and the Prakrits came into existence, Sanskrit had not been dead but was as much a living</p>
<p>language as either of the other two, and both were spoken orused for ordinary purposes, one by men of culture and the otherby ordinary people.</p>
<p>Sanskrit writers distinguish three elements in the Prakritvocabulary which they call Tadbhava, Tatsama, and Deśya.Such words as are derived from Sanskrit are called Tadbhavasuch as<strong>दसण, फस, मग्ग, कण्ण</strong>, &amp;c. Tatsamas are those that arethe same in Sanskrit and Prakrit as <strong>कमल, मण्डल</strong>, &amp;c., the phoneticlaws of the Prakrits not necessitating a change in them, andDeśyas are such as cannot be derived from Sanskrit and mustbe referred to another source. A good many words of this naturewe find used in Prakrit literature; and there exists a kośa orthesaurus of Deśya words by Hemacandra. A large number ofthese Deśya words exist in the modern vernaculars, such as:—</p>
<p>** अक्का** a sister, M., आका<sup id="fnref1:131"><a href="#fn:131" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">131</a></sup>,a term of honour used for an elder sister.</p>

<p>There are a great many words set down as Deśyas, which onclose examination will be found to be Tadbhavas. They differfrom ordinary Tadbhavas in having undergone great corruption.The following are instances. Some of the words in the above list.<strong>may also</strong> be considered to be of the same nature. Thus <strong>फंसइ</strong>&lsquo;deceives&rsquo; is a denominative or nominal verb from the word <strong>पाश</strong>&lsquo;asnare&rsquo;;which in our modern dialects has the form of <strong>फोस</strong>; whence<strong>फंसई</strong> is &rsquo;to ensnare&rsquo; or &rsquo;entrap.&rsquo; So also <strong>कुडं, कुड्डं, कोड्डुं</strong>, and the old M.<strong>कोइ</strong> are in all likelihood to be traced to the Skr. <strong>कौतुक</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>कन्दोठ्ठ</strong> alotus; from Skr. <strong>कन्दोत्थ</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>छिवइ</strong>touches; from <strong>छुप्</strong>by a change of vowel.</p>
<p><strong>छिप्प</strong> a tail; from Skr. <strong>पुच्छ</strong> by the consonants interchangingplaces, and the palatal <strong>छ</strong> having its vowel <strong>इ</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>पडोहर</strong> the hind part of a house; from Skr. <strong>पृष्ठगृह</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>पेयालं, पेज्जल</strong>,a measure, a certain quantity, occurs in the Pali andis traced to Skr. <strong>प्राय</strong>. It may also be connected with <strong>प्राज्य</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>बोल्लइ</strong> speaks; from Skr. <strong>ब्रू</strong> by the change of <strong>र्</strong> to <strong>ल्</strong> and thetransference of the vowel to the first consonant—athing oftenobservable; <strong>ब्लू-बुल्ल-बोल्ल</strong>.</p>
<p>The Sanskrit etymology of some of the words given by thelexicographers is evident; and one does not know how they cameto be regarded as Deśyas. Other words changed their sense inthe course of time and so were referred to this class.</p>
<p><strong>पम्हुसइ</strong> forgets; from Skr. <strong>प्रमुष</strong>to steal,—a thing forgotten is asit were stolen.</p>
<p><strong>बहुमुहो</strong> a wicked person:from Skr. <strong>बहुसुख</strong>, because a wickedperson puts on many faces or appearances.</p>
<p><strong>कामकिसोरो</strong> an ass; — a son of Kāma or love, devoted to pleasure,is often a donkey.</p>
<p><strong>कुच्छिमई</strong>pregnant; Skr. <strong>कुक्षि</strong> originally &lsquo;side&rsquo;, came to signify&rsquo;womb,&rsquo; and that womb is worthy of the name which bears achild, hence <strong>कुक्षिमती</strong><em>lit</em>&lsquo;having a womb&rsquo; came to have the signification given.</p>
<p>A good many of the words given by Hemacandra do not occurin the modern Vernaculars, and we have regular Tadbhavas instead; as., <strong>इल्ली</strong>a tiger, <strong>ईसु</strong>a nail, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The number of Deśya words, if properly examined, would begreatly reduced. Still a Deśīelement in the Prakrits and theVernaculars must be admitted. These words must have comeinto the dialects from the language of the aborigines whom theĀryas conquered; and some are found in Sanskrit also.</p>
<p><strong>THE APABHRAṀŚA</strong></p>
<p>The dialect called the Apabhraṁśa by the grammarians presents Indian speech in a further stage of decay, and occupies &amp;middle position between the Prakrit and the modern vernaculars,to some of which, especially to the old Hindi, the Brajabhäsä, andthe Gujarati, it bears striking resemblances, as I shall hereaftershow.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, we have the grammar of this dialect fromHemacandra, Trivikrama, and Kramadīśvara; but Vararuci doesnot mention it. The Apabhraṁśa had a literature of its own.Hemacandra illustrates each of his rules about this dialect byquoting a verse. In the fourth Act of the Vikramorvaśīthe Prakritspeeches of the king in his madness are in this dialect. But it isa question whether they existed there originally, since in several</p>
<p>manuscripts on this side of India they do not appear. The metresemployed in these and in Hemacandra&rsquo;s quotations are the sameas those popularly used in old and modern Hindi or Braj via, <em>dahā</em>or <em>copai.</em> Pandit Vrajalal mentions a work of the name of Muñjarāsa, written in the Apabhraṁśa, from which he gives a shortextract, and another the hero of which is a king of the name ofPrasenajita. He also quotes from another work; but the languageof all those appears to be more modern than Hemacandra&rsquo;s Apabhraṁśa, and that of some of the verses makes a very near approachto the Gujarati. As before, I will introduce my remarks on thisdialect by a specimen.—</p>

<p>&ldquo;I worship that good man, so rarely to be met with in thisKali age, who conceals his own merits and gives publicity to thoseof others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He who dies after having gone to the Gaṅgāand to Śivatīrtha, triumphs over the power (world) of death and sports in thehabitation of the gods.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>THE PHONOLOGY OF THE APABHRAṀŚA</strong></p>
<p>The vowel of the derivatives of the pronouns <strong>पद्, तद्, किम्,<strong>and <strong>इदम्</strong> is changed to <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>ए</strong>. In the principal Prikrit we havenoticed a tendency to such a change, and one of our instanceswas <strong>एत्थ</strong>for <strong>अत्र</strong>. From the same tendency we have in the Apabhraṁśa <strong>जेत्यु</strong>for <strong>यत्र,</strong> <strong>तेत्थु</strong>for <strong>तत्र</strong>, and <strong>केत्थु</strong>for <strong>कुत्र</strong>, the <strong>उ</strong> of the latterbeing replaced by <strong>ए</strong>in virtue of the analogy of the other pronouns.In the same way <strong>तद्वत्</strong> &ldquo;in that manner,&rdquo; which aftor dropping thefinal consonant becomes <strong>तङ्</strong>, is changed to <strong>तेम</strong>, <strong>यद्वत्</strong> to <strong>जेम</strong>, and</strong>किम्वत्</strong> to <strong>केम</strong>. This <strong>ए</strong> is also rendered a more close vowel andchanged to <strong>इ</strong>, and thus we have <strong>तिम, जिम,</strong> and <strong>किम</strong>. Thus the basesof these pronouns came to be considered as <strong>ते</strong> or <strong>ति, जे</strong> or <strong>जि</strong>, and<strong>के</strong>, or <strong>कि</strong>, and so we have <strong>तिध</strong>for <strong>तथा जिध</strong>for <strong>यथा</strong> and <strong>किंध</strong> for <strong>कथम्</strong>.The mute element being dropped, these forms become <strong>तिह, जिह</strong>, and <strong>किह</strong>, and further <strong>तेहु, जेहु</strong>and <strong>केहु</strong>. For similar reasons wehave <strong>तेत्तिज</strong> or <strong>तित्तिअ</strong> for <strong>तावत्क, जेत्तिअं</strong> or <strong>जित्तिअ</strong> for <strong>यावक, केत्तिअ</strong> or<strong>कित्तिअ</strong>for <strong>किपत्क</strong>, &amp;c. even in the Prakrits.</p>
<p>The nom. sing. termination of nouns <strong>अ</strong> in is shortened to <strong>उ</strong>,and since a great many nouns were pronounced with this final <strong>उ</strong>and its original sense was forgotten, it was transferred by way ofanalogy to other words or grammatical forms that did not possess</p>
<p>it before and thus we have <strong>पुणु</strong> and <strong>बिणु</strong> for <strong>पुनः</strong> and <strong>विना</strong> and <strong>जेत्यु,तेत्थु, जेहु</strong>, &amp;c., in the above.</p>
<p>The long vowels are sometimes shortened as in the word <strong>गङ्गा</strong>in the last of the above verses.</p>
<p>The consonants <strong>क्</strong> and <strong>ख्</strong> are sometimes softened to <strong>ग्</strong> and <strong>घ्</strong>instead of being dropped, <strong>त्</strong> and <strong>थ्</strong> to <strong>द्</strong> and <strong>ध्</strong>, as in Sauraseni,and <strong>प्</strong> and <strong>फ्</strong>, to <strong>ह्</strong> and <strong>भ</strong>. In the principal Prakrit also this issometimes the case. The labial <strong>ब्</strong> is changed to <strong>म्</strong> in a few moreinstances than in the Prakrits as in <strong>जाम</strong> and <strong>नाम</strong> for <strong>यावत्</strong> and<strong>तावत्</strong>, and <strong>जेम</strong> or <strong>जिम, तेम</strong> or <strong>तिम,</strong> &amp;o. in the above for <strong>यद्वत्, तद्वत्</strong> &amp;e.The complete contact of the lips necessary for the pronunciationof <strong>म्</strong> is avoided in a great many cases, and thus we have <strong>ञ्</strong> for <strong>म्</strong>as in <strong>भवँरु</strong> for <strong>भ्रमर, कवँलु</strong> for <strong>कमल</strong>, &amp;o This is the prevailing rulein most of the vernaculars, as we shall hereafter find. The conjunct <strong>म्ह्</strong>is changed to <strong>म्भ्</strong>, that is, the aspirate <strong>ह्</strong>has been labialized and assimilated to the preceding <strong>म्</strong>, as in f for Prakrit <strong>गिम्ह</strong>and Sanskrit <strong>ग्रीष्म</strong>. A few instances of this change we didfind in the Prakrits and we shall find more in the vernaculars.</p>
<p>The Sanskrit conjunct <strong>त्व्</strong> is changed to <strong>प्प्</strong>; for as <strong>त्</strong> was oftenpronounced as <strong>ग्</strong>, this <strong>ग्</strong> instead of merging into the precedingmute, as semi-vowels often do, acquired prominence as <strong>त्</strong> does,when preceded by a dental; and the being assimilated to it,the whole become <strong>प्प्</strong> as <strong>त्य्</strong>becomes <strong>च्च</strong>, as in <strong>पइ</strong>for <strong>त्वया, प्पण</strong> or <strong>पण</strong>for the abstract termination <strong>त्वन</strong>, and <strong>प्पिण</strong> for <strong>त्वीन्,</strong> the suffix ofthe absolutive. In the Prakrits the <strong>त्म</strong>of <strong>आत्मन्</strong>similarly becomes<strong>प्प</strong> and so we have <strong>अप्पा</strong> for <strong>आत्मा</strong>.The letter <strong>र्</strong>, when the lattermember of a conjunct, is sometimes not assimilated, as in <strong>त्रोप्पि,प्राउ</strong> for <strong>प्रायः</strong>, &amp;c., and sometimes it is introduced even when itdoes not exist in the original, as in <strong>धुं</strong>for <strong>तद्, प्रस्स</strong> for <strong>परस</strong>, &amp;c.With these few exceptions, the rules about the assimilation ofconjuncts, the elision of consonants, and others hold good.generally as in the Prakrits, as you will see from the above extract.</p>
<p><strong>DECLENSION IN THE APABHRAṀŚA</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nouns in अ</strong></p>
<p>The decay of the case terminations is, however, a distinguishing feature of thisdialect. The distinction between the nom.and</p>
<p>acc. case forms which we observed lessening at each stage in thegrowth of our languages is here altogether lost. The <strong>ओ</strong>of thenom. sing. of masculinenouns in <strong>अ</strong>is shortened to <strong>उ</strong>, and used inboth the cases, as <strong>मुअउ</strong>nom. for <strong>मृतकः</strong>, <strong>गड</strong> for <strong>गतः जमलोड</strong> for<strong>एमलोकम्</strong>; and applied to neuter nouns as well, as <strong>कमलु</strong>. The nasalof the neuter is preserved only in nouns which are augmented bythe addition of <strong>क</strong> changed to <strong>अ</strong>, as<strong>कमलउं</strong>for <strong>कमलकम्</strong>. The nom.and acc. pl. of the masculine ends in <strong>आ</strong>; as <strong>दिअहडा, पयडा</strong> &amp;c. inthe above. The neuter nouns preserve the Prakrits <strong>इं</strong> of the pluralas in <strong>कमलइं</strong>. Sometimes words are used in these two caseswithout any terminations; as <strong>विसंदुल</strong>nom. sing., <strong>निच्चल</strong>nom. sing.,<strong>गुण</strong> acc. pl., <strong>गङ्ग</strong> acc. sing., <strong>तित्थ</strong>acc. sing., in the above extract.</p>
<p>The principle observable in the other cases is the same as wehave noticed in the older dialects, viz., a gradual reduction of allthe declensions to a uniformity. The instrumental singular ofnouns in <strong>अ</strong>has two forms, one in <strong>एं</strong> as <strong>देवें</strong>, and the other the oldone <strong>देवेण</strong>. The former is derived from this old form, the final <strong>अ</strong>being dropped, and the nasal assuming the form of an anusvāra.This new termination is transferred to nouns in <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>उ</strong> also, asअग्गिएं. The instrumental pl. is the old one in <strong>हिं</strong>, but the changeof the ending vowel to <strong>ए</strong>is only optionally made; as <strong>गुणेहिं</strong>or<strong>गुणहिं</strong>.</p>
<p>One ablative termination is <strong>हे</strong>which is appended to all nouns,and the other <strong>हु</strong> asin <strong>बच्छहेगुण्हईफलई</strong> or <strong>वच्छहु गृण्हइ</strong>, “gathersfruits from trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course we may trace the first to <strong>हिन्तो</strong>by supposing it firstto be changed to <strong>हेन्तो</strong> by the usual Prakrit rule, and afterwards tohave dropped its second syllable; and to something else. Butit appears to me that a good many of the terminations havingbeen reduced to <strong>ह्</strong>by natural phonetic changes, the others alsohad this inserted in them by analogy, just as the nominativetermination <strong>उ</strong>is introduced in words and forms in which it did. not exist. This process we shall necessarily have to suppose whenwe examine the forms of the present tense. Or the <strong>ह्</strong> may havebeen introduced simply to prevent a histus and connect thevowel-termination with the base. And this is rendered probableby Hemacandra&rsquo;s rule, that the ending syllables <strong>उं, हं, हिं,</strong> and <strong>हं</strong>,are to be lightly pronounced, as the <strong>ए</strong> that is introduced in the</p>
<p>place of a dropped consonant is. The real syllables in these casesare therefore **अं, उं, इं,**and <strong>अं</strong>; and this is confirmed by the factthat the remnants of these Apabhraṁśa terminations existing insome of the modern vernaculars are destitute of this <strong>ह्</strong> and aremere vowel-terminations, as will be seen in a subsequent lecture. Thus, then, <strong>हे</strong> may be considered as the aspirated form of the <strong>ए</strong> ofthe Prakrit feminine ablative, and <strong>हु</strong> of the <strong>उ</strong> of the masculine ablative¹. The operation of the law of false analogies is very wide.The abl. pl. <strong>हुं</strong>, as in <strong>गिरिसिङ्गहुं</strong>, may with Lassen be traced to <strong>सुन्तो</strong>, the <strong>म्</strong> being changed to <strong>ह्</strong> and the syllable <strong>तो</strong> dropped, as <strong>ति</strong>is in the case of the 3rd pers. pl. of the present, as we shall see.</p>
<p>The genitive singular <strong>सु</strong> and <strong>स्सु</strong> as in <strong>सुअणरसु</strong> and <strong>परस्सु</strong> inverse 4 above, I trace to the <strong>स्म</strong> of the Prakrits, the <strong>उ</strong> addedby analogy as observed before. Lassen traces is to <strong>स्व</strong>, which, hesays, must have been added to these nouns to form the genitive;and the being softened to <strong>उ</strong>, it is reduced to <strong>सु</strong>. But this doesnot account for the double <strong>स्स</strong>of the other form; and the additionof such a word as <strong>स्व</strong> to make up a case-form is altogether unexampled. The suffix <strong>हो</strong>, as in <strong>दुल्लहहो</strong>in the same verse, is butanother form of <strong>सु</strong>.The genitive plural <strong>हं</strong>, as in <strong>माणुसहं</strong> for<strong>मनुष्याणाम्</strong>, may with Lassen be derived from the <strong>साम्</strong>of theSanskrit pronominal declension. But the transference of thistermination to nouns is nowhere seen in the Prakrits; <strong>हं</strong> isoptionally appended to nouns in or also; and the characteristic <strong>णं</strong>of the gen. is wanting in this dialect. The more probableexplanation, therefore, is that the <strong>ण</strong> lost its cerebral element andwas reduced merely to a nasal <strong>अ</strong>, or <strong>अ</strong> with an anusvāra, as isthe case in the instrumental singular, and the <strong>ह्</strong> is added, asobserved before, simply to facilitate the pronunciation.</p>
<p>The loc. sing. ends in <strong>ए</strong>, as in <strong>तले</strong>, which we see is the oldtermination, or in <strong>इ</strong>, as in <strong>तलि</strong>, which is a shortened form of <strong>ए</strong>.Kramadīśvara gives also <strong>हिं</strong>which might be traced to the Pali <strong>म्हि</strong>,the Sanskrit <strong>स्मिन्</strong>, or the <strong>स्सिं</strong>of the Prakrit pronominal declension.The language of Jaina works has this <strong>स्सिं</strong>in the case of nounsalso. But even here the Prakrit <strong>स्मि</strong>, may, withreason, besupposed to have changed to <strong>इं</strong>, and the <strong>ह्</strong>to be, as before, a mere<em>spiritus lenis</em>. We have this locative <strong>इं</strong> in the Marathi. The <strong>हिं</strong> isextended to the plural also of these nouns. The vocative is formedby using which is evidently an interjection; as <strong>तरुण हो</strong>&ldquo;O young men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>____________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1**.** Kramadīśvarain Lassan&rsquo;s extract gives <strong>दू</strong>instead of <strong>हु</strong>;but this is anevident misreading.</p>
<p><strong>Nouns in इ or उ</strong></p>
<p>There is no distinction between the nom. and acc. sing. andpl., the original base being used without any modification oraddition.</p>
<p>The instrumental singular is formed by adding <strong>एं</strong> or <strong>ण</strong>, as inthe last class of nouns, or simple anusvāra; as <strong>अग्गिएं, अग्गिण, अग्गिं</strong>,As <strong>एण</strong> becomes <strong>एं</strong>by dropping the final vowel, so does the <strong>इणा</strong> ofthe Prakrit instrumental here become <strong>इं</strong>.</p>
<p>The abl. sing. ends in <strong>हे</strong> as in <strong>गिरिहे</strong> and <strong>तरुहे</strong>; and the gen.sing. also according to Kramadīśvara, Hemacandra being silent.These have been transferred from the feminine. Kramadīśvaraalso gives <strong>हो</strong> and <strong>हं</strong> as the terminations of the sing. of these two.cases; but there must be some misreading here in Lassen&rsquo;sextract from the author, since is a distinctive plural termination. The gen. pl. termination is <strong>हुं</strong> or <strong>हं</strong> as in <strong>तरुहुं, सउणिहं (शकुनीनाम)</strong>.The latter has been traced to the old gen.<strong>ण</strong>, and the formerappears to be only another form of it, with the addition of theusual <strong>उ</strong>.</p>
<p>The loc. sing. has <strong>हि</strong>, as in <strong>कलिहि</strong>; and the pl. has <strong>हिं</strong>and <strong>हुं</strong>, as in <strong>तरुहिं</strong>and <strong>उदुहुं</strong>,.The first must be considered to be the same as fe derivedfrom <strong>स्सिं</strong>or <strong>म्मि</strong>with the anusvāra dropped; or as the <strong>इ</strong> of Prakritfeminine nouns with the <em>spiritus lenis</em> <strong>ह्</strong>. This explanation seemsto be probable, since we have seen other feminine terminationsalso used for the cases of these nouns. The third is to be tracedto the Prakrit <strong>मुं</strong>. Kramadīśvara in Lassen&rsquo;s extract gives <strong>हं</strong> forthe <strong>हुं</strong>of the abl. pl.<strong>हे</strong>, and for that of the gen. pl.; but I have tomake the same remark here as before. The instr, and abl. pluralsare the same as those of nouns in <strong>अ</strong>; as <strong>तरुहिं</strong>and <strong>तरुहुं</strong>. Thus theplural of three cases ends in <strong>हुं</strong> , derived separately of course, andthe plurals of two in <strong>हिं</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Feminine nouns</strong></p>
<p>The plurals of the nom. and acc. of feminine nouns preservethe old <strong>ओ</strong>, or its shortened form <strong>उ</strong>, as in <strong>अङ्गुलिउ जज्जरिआउ</strong> in the</p>
<p>second verse, and <strong>सुन्दरखत्वङ्गाओ विलासिणीओ</strong>. The sing. is theoriginal base, as <strong>जज्जरिआ, विलासिणी</strong> &amp;c.</p>
<p>The instr. sing. termination is <strong>ए</strong>, the old one, as in <strong>ससिमण्डलचन्दिमए, कन्तिए</strong>&amp;o,: the abl is <strong>हे</strong> as in <strong>बालाहे</strong> for <strong>बालायाः</strong>,which is an aspirated <strong>ए</strong>; and the genitive <strong>हे</strong> as in <strong>मुद्धडहे</strong>for <strong>मुग्घायाः</strong> (<strong>ड</strong>being a nominal suffix) may be similarlyexplained or traced to the of the gen. sing. fem. of thepronouns, <strong>किम्, यद्</strong>,and <strong>तद्</strong>, in the Prakrit. I prefer the formerexplanation. This <strong>हे</strong> has been transferred to masculine nouns in<strong>इ</strong> or <strong>उ</strong> as we have seen. The abl. and gen. pl. ends in <strong>हु</strong>, as in<strong>चयसिअहु</strong> for <strong>वपस्याभ्यः</strong> or <strong>वयस्पानाम्</strong>, The anusvāra of the <strong>हु</strong> of theother classes of nouns is here omitted and if correctly so, the <strong>हु</strong>of the abl. may be considered an aspirated form of the <strong>उ</strong>whichis the ablative termination in the Prakrit: and that of thegenitive may be traced to the <strong>सु</strong> of the singular of masculinenouns. The instr. pl. and the loc. sing. and pl. take the sameterminations as masculine nouns in <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>उ</strong>;as <strong>महिर्हि, महिहि</strong>, and<strong>महिहिं तुं</strong>. Lassen gives other terminations; but he appears to menot to have interpreted Kramadīśvara correctly. Those I havegiven are all that I have been able to find.</p>
<p>You will thus see how by the various influences at work, thenatural transformation of <strong>स्</strong>to <strong>ह्</strong>, the elision of some of theelements, and the aspirated pronunciation of the vowels, most ofthe old terminations have been reduced to syllables composed of <strong>ह्</strong>and a vowel with or without an anusvāra. Terminations withsuch weak sounds are not adapted to serve the purposes ofordinary intercourse, since they require on the part of thespeakers such care in pronunciation to render themselves intelligible to each other as we have not seen displayed in the courseof our lingual history. The nominative and accusative throughout, and in certain classes of nouns, the other cases also havecome to have the same forms. So that the purpose of expressingthe different relations can be no longer performed by these poorremnants of the old declensional system; and a process of reconstruction must take place. It has already begun in the Apabhraṁśa; but we shall find it carried on much further in thevernaculars, which may now be said to have completed theirnew declensional system.</p>
<p>The abl. sing. of pronouns ends in <strong>हां</strong>, as <strong>जहां</strong>, &amp;o., which is tobe traced to the Sanskrit <strong>स्मात्</strong>and the Prakrit <strong>म्हा</strong>, and the loc.sing. in <strong>हिं</strong>which has been explained. The gen. sing. of **यद्, तद्,**and <strong>किम्</strong> sre optionally <strong>जासु, तासु,</strong> and <strong>कासु</strong>, made up by adding theususl <strong>उ</strong> to <strong>जास,</strong> <strong>तास</strong>, and <strong>कास</strong>, which again are other forms of <strong>जस्स,तस्स</strong>, and <strong>कस्स</strong>, with one of the consonants dropped and thepreceding vowel lengthened as a compensation, a phenomenonto he noticed in going over the vernaculars. In the feminine,these pronouns have <strong>जहे, तहे</strong>,and <strong>कहे</strong> optionally for the gen. sing.,which are derived from the Prakrit <strong>जिसे, तिसे</strong> and <strong>किसे</strong> and thePali <strong>जिस्साय, तिस्साय</strong>, and <strong>किस्साय</strong>. The base, however, in theApabhraṁśa ends in <strong>अ</strong>and not <strong>ई</strong>, or, the more probable explanation is, that this <strong>हे</strong> is the aspirated form of the <strong>ए</strong>of feminine nours.</p>
<p><strong>इदम्</strong> has <strong>आय</strong> for its base; the instr. and gen. singulars, forinstance, are <strong>आयेण</strong> and <strong>आपहो</strong>. This seems to be taken from thenom. sing. <strong>अअ</strong>, or <strong>अय</strong>by the rule of the substitution of <strong>य</strong> for <strong>अं</strong>.The neuter nom. and acc. sing, is <strong>इमुं</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>एहो</strong> er is nom. and acc. sing. masc. of <strong>एतद्</strong> corresponding to <strong>एसो</strong>,<strong>एह</strong> fem. to <strong>एसा</strong>, and by the application of <strong>उ</strong>to these we have theneuter <strong>एहु.एइ</strong>is the nom. and acc. pl. answering to <strong>एए</strong>Prakrit,with the latter <strong>ए</strong> shortened; and <strong>ओइ</strong> of <strong>अदस</strong> which corresponds tothe form <strong>अमुके</strong>, the <strong>अमु</strong> being changed to <strong>अवुं</strong>by a rule beforementioned, and afterwards to <strong>ओ</strong>; and <strong>के</strong> to <strong>ए</strong>, shortened to <strong>इ</strong>. Inother respects all these pronouns are declined like the corresponding nouns.</p>
<p>The pronouns of the 1st and 2nd persons are thus declined :—</p>

<p>Here we have not the wilderness of forms which we observedin the principal Prakrit. The nom. sing. of the 1st per. is <strong>इउं</strong></p>
<p>corresponding to <strong>अहकम्</strong>, the initial <strong>अ</strong> and the <strong>क्</strong> being elided andthe usual Apabhraṁśa <strong>उ</strong>added. In the Prakrits <strong>अहकम्</strong>, is represented by <strong>अइअं</strong> or <strong>अहयं</strong>, <strong>मइं</strong> is to be traced to the Sanskrit instr.<strong>मया</strong> and the <strong>मयि</strong>, both of which are reduced to the form of <strong>मइ</strong>in the Prakrit. Here it is extended to the acc. also. The pl. base is<strong>अम्ह</strong>, which has been explained. The nom. pl. <strong>अम्हइं</strong>corresponds tosuch a form as <strong>अस्मके</strong>nom. pl., not loc. as Lassen says, through.<strong>अम्हए</strong>; and the gen. pl. has the Apabhraṁśa termination <strong>हं</strong>. Therest are old. <strong>तुह</strong> is a base derived, as I said in going over thePrakrits, from <strong>तुय्हं</strong>and is used in the Prakrit also, <strong>पइं</strong>and <strong>तइं</strong> ofthe acc. instr. and loc. are from <strong>त्वया</strong>and <strong>त्वयि</strong>.The second isfound in the older dialects, the first is peculiar to this. Of thecorruption of <strong>त्व</strong>to <strong>प्प</strong>have already spoken.</p>
<p>The abl. and gen.<strong>तउ</strong>corresponds to a form <strong>त्वक</strong>which withthe Apabhraṁśic <strong>उ</strong> is <strong>तउ</strong>, the <strong>क</strong> being dropped. Or it may betraced to <strong>तव</strong> with the <strong>व</strong> dissolved into <strong>उ</strong>. <strong>तज्झ</strong> is a form found inthe Prakrits also and explained by me as a corruption of the dat.<strong>तुय्हं</strong> in the Pali and Prakrits, derived from the Skr. <strong>तुभ्यस्</strong>.Thedative forms, you will remember, are put under the gen in theolder dislects. The <strong>ध्र</strong>of <strong>तुध्र</strong>is a peculiar Apabhramsic conjunct,formed from <strong>ज्झ्</strong>. The neuter of <strong>तद्</strong>is similarly <strong>त्रं</strong> and <strong>ध्रं</strong>. Thebase of the plural is <strong>तुम्ह</strong>, the same as in the Prakrit; and the nom.pl. <strong>तुम्हइं</strong>is to be traced to <strong>तुष्मके</strong>for <strong>युष्मके</strong> nom. pl. All the formsare similar to those of the first personal pronoun.</p>
<p><strong>THE VERB IN THE APABHRAṀSA</strong></p>
<p>The Present tense of the Apabhraṁśa verb admits, besidesthose of the corresponding Prakrit or Śaurasenī tense, thefollowing forms :— 1st pers. sing. <strong>लहउं</strong>, pl. <strong>लहहुं</strong>; 2nd pers. sing.<strong>लहहि</strong>, pl. <strong>लहहु</strong>; 3rd pers. sing. <strong>लहइ</strong>, pl. <strong>लहहिं</strong>.</p>
<p>It appears that some of these forms have arisen from &amp; confusion of the Present Indicative with the Imperative. The prevailing and distinguishing final of the latter is the vowel <strong>उ</strong>; and here<br>
we see it is appended to the forms of the 1st pers. sing. and 2ndpers. pl., though it does not occur in those forms in any of theolder dialects.</p>
<p>The <strong>ह्</strong> is another characteristio of these paradigms. That ofthe second pers. sing. we get from the old <strong>सि</strong>, and that of the pl.</p>
<p>exists in the Prakrit, being derived from the Skr. <strong>थ</strong>. But thethird pers. pl. and the 1st pers. pl. get it simply by an extensionof the analogy or It may have been introduced to prevent ahiatus and thus may, like those of the cases, have been simplya <em>spiritus lenis.</em> The <strong>हुं</strong> of the latter, however, may be traced to<strong>म्हो, ओ</strong>being shortened to <strong>उ</strong>, just as <strong>म्हा</strong>and <strong>म्हि</strong>of the declensionsbecome <strong>हां</strong>and <strong>हिं</strong>.Instead of the 3rd pers. pl. <strong>न्ति</strong>we have <strong>हिं</strong>inwhich, though the <strong>ह</strong>is due to analogy, the characteristic <strong>इ</strong> andthe nasal are preserved.</p>
<p>You will thus see that in the declensions as well as conjugations the prevails <strong>ह्</strong>in this dialect. The Imperative second pers.sing. ends in , <strong>इ, ए</strong> or <strong>उ</strong>. The first two may be traced to the Prakritand Sankrit <strong>हि, ह्</strong> being dropped as in the Vernaculars; and thelast seems to be substituted for the <strong>अ</strong> of one of the forms in theoriginal dialects by analogy; or it may be the remnant of <strong>मु</strong>,changed first to <strong>हु</strong>, and then to <strong>उ</strong>. But a better and, I may say, the trueexplanation of these forms will be given in going over theVernaculars.</p>
<p>Hemacandra does not give any more forms for the Imperative,but Kramadīśvara gives <strong>ऊ</strong> for the second person plural whichmust very likely be <strong>हु</strong>, the same as in the Present, and <strong>हुं</strong> for thefirst pers. pl. which we have in the Present also. In one of theverses quoted by Hemacandra occurs <strong>पिअहुं</strong> which seems to correspond to <strong>पिबन्तु</strong>, if the reading is correct. The truth seems tobe that the forms of the Imperative were lost, and the sense confounded with that of the Present, but the distinctive forms werethose of the second pers. sing., and in this respect there is ananalogy with Hindi and Gujarati which resemble the Apabhraṁśathe most.</p>
<p>The Future has the Prakrit and Śaurasenīforms in <strong>हि</strong> and <strong>इस्स</strong>;but one <strong>म्</strong> of this latter is dropped, and then the terminations ofthe Apabhraṁśa Present are added.</p>
<p>The terminations of the absolutive are <strong>इ. इउ, अवि, इवि, एवि,एविणु,एष्पि, एप्पिणु, इ</strong>. is the same as the Śaurasenī <strong>इञ्</strong> from the Skr.<strong>य, इउ</strong>is the same, with the usual <strong>उ</strong> added to it, or is to be tracedto the <strong>तुम्</strong> or <strong>इतुम्</strong> which is, as we have seen, confounded in thePrakrit with the absolutive, and the rest are various forms of the</p>
<p>Vedic <strong>त्वीन</strong> with the Prakrit augment <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>ए</strong>,This <strong>त्वीन</strong>is, by arule before mentioned, changed to <strong>प्पिण</strong>, which with <strong>उ</strong>becomes <strong>प्पिणु</strong>and by dropping the final <strong>न</strong>we have <strong>प्पि</strong>. This, however, may bederived also from such a form <strong>त्वी</strong> found in the Vedas. This <strong>प्पि</strong>or <strong>प्पिणु</strong>is then softened to <strong>वि</strong> or <strong>विणु</strong>, as <strong>प्</strong> is so softened in manycases. When the augment <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>ए</strong>is not prefixed, we have <strong>वि</strong> inthe form of <strong>अवि</strong>, the <strong>अ</strong> being the final vowel of the root.</p>
<p>Some of the terminations of the absolutive are also used toform the infinitive, on account of the prevailing confusion between the two. In consequence of this very confusion, recourseis had to other ways of forming the latter which are similar tothose existing in the Prakrits; but these will be noticed hereafter.</p>
<p>The termination <strong>तव्य</strong> of the potential participle assumes theforms of <strong>इएव्वउं, एव्वउं</strong>and <strong>एव</strong>. The first two represent the formwith the addition of <strong>क</strong>; and the <strong>इ</strong> of <strong>इएव्यउं</strong>is the usual augmentThe <strong>अ</strong> of the <strong>त</strong>of <strong>तव्य</strong>which remains after the consonantal portionis dropped, is by the influence of the preceding <strong>इ</strong> changed to <strong>ए</strong>.</p>
<p>In these points which are not noticed here, the Apabhraṁśafollows chiefly the Śaurasenī, and the principal Prakrit also tosome extent. Thus in a great measure it represents those dialectsin a further stage of decay; but it must be considered to havederived some words or forms independently also. Thus the <strong>पइ</strong> ofthe second person pronoun cannot be derived from the Prakrit <strong>तइ</strong>,nor <strong>प्पिण</strong>of the absolutive from <strong>तूण</strong> or <strong>ऊण</strong>, or <strong>पण</strong>of abstract nounsfrom <strong>त्तण</strong>, but directly from the Sanskrit <strong>त्वया, त्यीन</strong> and <strong>त्वन</strong>. Thiscorruption of <strong>त्व</strong>must have existed in some of the older dialectstoo, since, as observed before, we have it in Aśoka&rsquo;s inscriptions;and the Apabhraṁśa derived it as well as a few such peculiarities from them.</p>
<p><strong>LECTURE IV</strong></p>
<p><strong>P ONOLOGY OF THE VERNACULARS OF NORTHERN INDIA</strong></p>
<p>We have now traced the gradual decay of Sanskrit from theform in which it is presented to us in the oldest literary recordsto that which it assumed in the Apabhraṁśa dialect. We haveseen how words lost some of their vocal elements on account ofthe natural tendency of men to economize effort, as well as inconsequence of the fact that the vocal organs of the people, whothrough historical nooidents had to speak that language thoughit was not theirs, were untrained to utter the sounds of thatlanguage, and that they imported into it some sounds to whichthey themselves were previously accustomed. We have alsoobserved the effects of the operation of the law of analogy insimplifying the grammar of the language — an operation, therange of which, in consequence of the ignorance of those sameforeigners, was very extensive. The declensions and conjugations gradually lost their variety, and became reduced to one or two types by the generalization of the rules, originally applicableonly to the nouns and verbs frequently used in ordinary intercourse. At the same time the terminations themselves of someof the cases, tenses, and moods came through numberless analogies to have the same or similar forms, and their vocal bodygradually became attenuated and in some instances they werealtogether dropped. Thus these processes of simplification werecarried on much further than was consistent with intelligibilityin ordinary intercourse. Hence the necessity arose of inventingnew modes of expression for those relations which came to beimperfectly expressed or ceased to be expressed in the old way.As observed in the last lecture, such new expressions are to bemet with in the Apabhraṁśa dialect.</p>
<p>If the Prakrits and the Apabhraṁśa which we have examinedreally represent the speech of the Indian people at certain periodsof their past history, we should expect to find a relation of continuity between them and the prevailing speech of modern times.The words and grammatical forms in the modern vernaculars</p>
<p>should either be the same as those existing in those dialects, orshould be easily deducible from them by laws which we haveobserved to be in operation; and if in the Apabhraṁśa thegrammatical forms came to be in a condition in which reconstruction was necessary, and if accordingly it was begun, weshould find it carried on much further in the vernaculars andthat on principles used in the Apabhraṁśa and the other dialectsand out of materials existing in them. We will therefore proceednow to the examination of the vernaculars with a view to tracethis continuity.</p>
<p>The varieties of speech prevailing in Northern India at thepresent day are almost innumerable. If even a few peculiaritieswere to be regarded as giving individuality to a language, thenumber of dialects spoken in this part of the country wouldexceed even the proverbial fifty-six. But they may be dividedinto classes on the principle of resemblance; and generally thedialects spoken in the adjoining provinces are so alike eachother that they may be regarded as constituting one class or evenone language. Thus we have nine principal languages; andstarting from ourselves, and going northwards, first on thewestern side of the country and then turning to the east andsouth-east, I may state them as the Marathi, the Gujarati, theSindhi, including the Kacchi, the Panjabi, the Kashmiri, the Hindi, the Nepali, the Bengali, and the Oriya.</p>
<p>Of these the Kashmiri and the Nepali have not yet been studied,and no grammars or books are available. Hence my observations will not extend to them. Each of these has its dialects; butthose of some, such as the Gujarati and the Sindhi, differ fromthe main language in unimportant particulars. The same is thecase with the Marathi, except in some corners of the Marathacountry. But in these there are five dialects differing in a greatmany important particulars from the main Marathi. Thus, theGoanese prevails in Goa; the Malvani, my own native tongue,and the Savantvadi, both of which, notwithstanding some minordifferences, may be considered as one, are spoken in the Malvan,Vengorla, and Savantvadi districts. The Chitpavni is used onlyby the caste of Chitpavan Brahmans in the district aboutRatnagiri; the Salsetti is spoken by the original inhabitants of</p>
<p>that island and of Bombay; and the Khandeshi, which is a mixtureof Marathi and Gujarati and contains to an appreciable degreea barbarous element, probably from a Bhil source, prevails inKhandesh.</p>
<p>The Hindi has a great many dialects. Two at least may bedistinguished among the variety of speech prevalent inRajputana, the Mewari spoken in Mewar and the adjoiningdistricts, and the Marwari which prevails in Marwar, Jesselmere,and the other provinces. These, as may be inferred from theirgeographical position, are midway between the Gujarati and theHindi dialects of the North, displaying some of the peculiarcharacteristics of both. Furthernorth, we have the Brajprevailing in the country about Mathura; and to the east,the Kanoji. There is not much difference between these.The language of the history of eighty-four Vaiṣṇavasand other books of the Vallabhācāryan sects, whichis ordinarily supposed to be the Braj,grammatical forms identical with those mentioned by a recent grammarian as peculiar to the Kanoji. There is a good deal of confusion as regards this matter, the characteristics of one beingfound in the printed books together with those belonging toanother. Then further north, we have the Garhawali and theKumaoni spoken in the provinces of Garhawal and Kumaon.</p>
<p>To the east, we have the Avadhi or the dialect of the provinceof Avadha or Ayodhya, and to the south of this again is theRewai spoken in the State of Rewa. Further to the east is theBhojpuri and kindred dialects prevailing in Bihar and theadjacent districts on the confines of Bengal.</p>
<p>The old literature of the Hindi is principally written in twodialects, the Braj, and what is called the Purbi. Sūradāsa&rsquo;s works,Beharilal&rsquo;s Satasai, and others are written in the former; and tothese I may add the Vallabhha works I have already mentioned.The Rāmāyaṇa and Tulasidasa&rsquo;s other works are written in thelatter. The chief distinction between the idioms of Sūradāsa andTulasīdāsa appears to me to be, that the latter uses a great manygrammatical forms which are old, and from which those used bythe former are derived. In this respect Purbi might be considered to be a very old form of the Braj. But there are a few other</p>
<p>distinctions, though it is questionable whether they are enough tojustify the Purbi being considered an independent dialect. Thelanguage of Kabīra&rsquo;s Ramainīand Sākhiīs presents a few peculiarities found in neither of the above. But the characteristics ofSūradāsa and Tulasīdāsa are also to be found in it; so that if weleave out of consideration the other works of Kabīra, in whichthere is probably another variety of speech, the dialect used bythese Hindi poets may be considered to be the same. This hascome to be regarded as the poetic dialect, and most of the otherHindi poets have written in it. Its modern representative is theBraj, in which the commentaries on Tulasīdāsa&rsquo;s, Kabīra&rsquo;s andBehārilāl&rsquo;s works, and on the tenth book of the Bhāgavatathat Ihave seen, are written. This then is the Hindi literary dialect.The language, however, which is used as the medium of instruction in the Government schools in the North-Western Provinces,and in which the books published by the Educational Departmentare written, is now regarded as the Standard Hindi, and its grammatical structure is identical with that of the Urdu spoken bythe Mussalmans. This is rather the dialect in which the Hindusof the different provinces in Northern India communicate witheach other, than that which they speak in their own provinces.</p>
<p>The Panjabi has also several dialects; but little is known aboutthem. Oriyi resembles the Bengali in so many respects that oneof them may be considered a dialect of the other. The similaritybetween the Hindi and the Panjabi is also very great.</p>
<p>I will now give short specimens of these dialects.</p>
<p><strong>I Marathi:</strong></p>
<p><strong>कित्येक लोक मुत्सही याणीं पदर पसरोन प्रार्थना आईसाहेबांची केली जे तुम्हीं अग्निप्रवेश केलिया नंतर संपादिलेलें राज्य लयास आजच जातें प्राण महाराज कांहींठेवीत नाहींत हा प्रकार घडतो शाहाजी महाराजांचे व शिवाजी महाराजांचें नांव जगीं नाहीसे होतें सर्वोवर साहेबीं दृष्टि देवून राजयांस वोसंगास घेऊन सादेबीं अग्नि न घेतांमानस कठिण करून राहावें। हेंकाम करून गेलिया वंशक्षय महाराजांचा वडिलींचकेला ऐसें जगीं प्रसिद्धता दिसतें तेव्हां आई साहेबांस राइविलें ।</strong></p>
<p>(From an old Bakhara or Chronical of Shivaji.)</p>
<p>Some counsellors supplicated the lady-mother in an humbleattitude saying: &lsquo;If you will burn yourself by fire, the kingdomwhich has been acquired goes to ruin this very day; and it will</p>
<p>happen that the king will not bear life; the name of Shahaji Maharaj and Shivaji Maharaj will not remain in the world. Therefore,your ladyship, looking to all these things, should make the kingsit in your lap ( protect), and, not resorting to fire, render yourmind firm, and live. If you do this (burn yourself), it will plainlyappear to all the world that you destroyed the race of the Mahārāj Thus they prevailed on her to live.</p>
<p><strong>II Gujarati :</strong></p>
<p><strong>दमयंती तो महा आश्चर्य लाग्युं अने भ्रान्ति पड़ी के आ ते स्वप्न के साचुं\। एवाअनेक विचार करती चालेछे एवामांएक अशोक वृक्ष दीठो त्यां दीन दमयंती आवीनेकहेछे के ओ प्रिपदर्शन अशोक तारा नामनो महिमा राखी मारा शोकनोनाश करीसत्यनामी था। पण कोण उत्तर आये।</strong></p>
<p>(From Mr. Mansukharāma‛s Nala-Damayantī)</p>
<p>Damayanti felt greatly astonished and was in doubt whetherit was a reality or a dream. While moving on, engaged in varioussuch thoughts, sho saw an Aśoka tree. Going there she said &ldquo;Olovely Aśoka, having regard to the greatness of thy name, destroymy <em>Śoka</em>(sorrow) and deserve that name.&rdquo; But who wouldanswer?</p>
<p><strong>III Sindhi :</strong></p>
<p><strong>गिरतार कोटमे राइ डिआचु नाले हिकडो पातिशाहु हो । तहिंजे भेणु फकीरखांवुर्योसांई मुखे पुटु डे। फकीर हुनखे चिओ पुटु तोखे थींदो पर राइ डिआचजो सिरुवढींदो। हुन चिओ उहोपुटु ई बनि पिओ जो भूजे भाउजो सिरु वडे।पर फकीरजोचवणु थिओ सो टरे की न । थोरे घणे डिहाडे माइअ पुटुजण्यो ।</strong></p>
<pre><code>                         (From the story of Rāi Ḍiāca in Major Stack‛s Grammar.)

<p>There was s Pāṭiśāha(king ) of the name of Rṭi Ḍiāca. Hissister begged of a Fakir: &ldquo;Sire, give me a son.&rdquo; The Fakir saidto her: &ldquo;A son will be ( born ) to thee, but he will cut off thehead of Rāi Ḍiāca&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;Accursed be (<em>lit.</em> fall into awilderness) the son who should cut off my brother&rsquo;s head.&rdquo; Butthe Fakir&rsquo;s word cannot prove vain.

<p>Then again Babe Nānaskjīsaid:&ldquo;O Paṇḍit, hear. Is the religious holiness of Brahmans and Kṣatriyas preserved by the sacred thread or by good deeds? Hear, O Paṇḍit, if one who is invested with the sacred thread does wicked deeds, does he remain a Brahman or ṣatriya or become a Caṇḍāla ?&rdquo; When Śrī Guru Bābejīspoke thus, all the people that were sitting there were astonished. Then they began to exclaim: &ldquo;O God, he is still but a child, and how wonderfully he speaks&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>V Hindi:</strong></p>
<p><strong>इतना कह उसने बहुतेरे उपाय हाथ निकालनेको किये पर एक भी काम न आया।निदान सांस रुककर पेट फट गया । तो पछाडखाव के गिरा तब उसके शरीरसे लोहनदीकी भांति वह निकला। तिस समैंग्वालबाल आप आय देखने औरश्रीकृष्णचंद आगे जाय बनमें एक कदम की छांहतले खडहुए ।</strong></p>

At that time the cowherd boys came one after another and began to see; and Śrīi Kṛṣṇa went forward and stood in the shade of a Kadamba tree in the forest.</p>
<p><strong>VI Braj :</strong></p>

<p>(From the Story of the Manifestation of Govardhananāthjī.)</p>
<p>When all the inhabitants of Vraja heard that Devadamana was greatly fond of cows, they all joined and resolved that all who had cows should esch present one or two. And the inhabtants of Vraja joined and caused each of the twenty-four villages</p>
<p>about the mountain (Govardhana) to present one or two cowseach. And it was resolved that in the twenty villages he whose cow should first calveshould present the calf to Devadamana. In this way thousands of cows were presented to the Prosperous One. Then he used the milk, curds, butter and whey of the cows in his home.</p>

<p>Will you hear then? That year at the time when I was suffering from intermittent fever, remained lying in bed day and night, and had no strength to rise and stand, my lord (husband) came. I had not seen what sort of a man my husband was since. I ceased to be an infant. Nothing is more valuable to a woman than her husband. I had thought that my suffering would become alleviated, if he sat by my side for a few minutes <em>(lit.</em> two daṇḍas ) and spoke with me. Dear sister, you will not believe me when I say that, as soon as he stood by my side, he said, &ldquo;It is sixteen years since I married you and went away. You are one of my wives. I come to you, being in need of money, and will go back soon. I spoketo your father; but he put me off. Do pull out the ornament in your arm (round the wrist), and give it to me.</p>

<p>You will find that in the Marathi passage there are about 58 different words of which 26 or a few less than a half are derived from the Sanskrit through the Prakrits; in the Gujarati there are 42 out of which 23 or a few more than a half are of the latter description; in the Sindhi the proportion is 38 to 21, or somewhat greater than a half; in the Panjabi 44 to 23 or a half; in the High</p>
<p>Hindi 48 to 23 or a little less than a half; in the Braj 45 to 29, <em>i. e.</em> about two-thirds; in the Bengali 71 to 27. <em>i. e,</em> about two-fifths; and in the Oriya 32 to 15 or a little less than a half. I have not taken into consideration other words which do come to us undoubtedly through the Prakrits, but the etymology of which is not so obvious. These would increase the proportion and bring. it to more than one-half in most of the cases. In this list there are three or four words such as <strong>नाम</strong>, and <strong>वह</strong>, which may be called. old Tatsama, since they exist unchanged in the Prakrits, and the rest may be called cld Tadbhavas.</p>
<p>Now in these passages you will also have seen a large number of words such 36 <strong>प्रार्थना, अग्निप्रवेश, आध्वर्य, स्वप्न, बालक, शरीर, नदी, प्रिय, प्रथम, ज्वर, दिवारात्रि, शृङ्ग, स्थान</strong> &amp;c., which are exactly the same as in Sanskrit. They could not have existed in those forms in the Prakrits, and hence it is clear that they were introduced long after the Prakrit period; and the tendency now-a-days in our languages is to introduce more of such words. These may be called modern Tatsamas. But some of these have undergone a corruption since they were adopted. Thus <strong>कर्म</strong> is pronounced <strong>करम; धर्म, धरम;क्षत्रिय, खतरी; कार्य, कारज</strong>; and <strong>कृपा, कर्पा</strong> or <strong>कुर्पा</strong> while the Prakrit corruptions of these are <strong>कम्म. धम्म, खत्तिअ, कज्ज</strong>, and <strong>किवा</strong> .Such words therefore are modern Tadbhavas.</p>
<p>At the end of my observations on the Prakrits in the last lecture, I gave a list of vocables existing in those dialects which are called Deśyas by native grammarians, and showed that several of them existed in our vernaculars also. We observe from the above passages, which contain such words as <strong>मुत्सद्दी, साहेव</strong> and <strong>पातिशाह</strong> ,that there are in the modern dialects words of an Arabic or Persian origin also. Thus we may distinguish these elements in the vocabulary of the vernaculars of Northern India:—1. Old Tadbhavs, 2. Old Tatsama, 3. Modern Tadbhava, 4. Modern Tatsama, 5. Deśya, 6. Arabic, and 7. Persian.</p>
<p>In its nature the old Tatsama element is but a small quantity and the main skeleton of our languages is made up of the old Tadbhava. It forms the principal constituent of the speech of the middle classes. The higher classes, however, use the Modern Tatsama and Tadbhava element to a much larger extent; and</p>
<p>the language spoken by learned men is heavily loaded with pure Sanskrit words. This element has succeeded in driving out a very appreciable portion of the first in some of the languages. The Bengali contains the largest number of pure Sanskrit words, and hence one who knows Sanskrit can master the language in but a few weeks. The old Tadbhava element is reduced to the smallest minimum in what is called Sādhu bhāṣāor the speech of the educated. According to the extent of the modern Tatsama or Tadbhava element, the other languages may be arranged in the following order :—Oriya, Marathi, Hindi, Gujarati, Punjabi, Sindhi.</p>
<p>It must, however, he remarked that the modern Tatsamas appear in a pure or correct Sanskrit form only in the written language. The Bengalis in actually pronouncing these words. corrupt them in a manner which renders them unrecognizable as Sanskrit words; and often in the same way as the old Prakrit speakers did. Thus <strong>आत्मा</strong> is pronounced <strong>अत्ता. ईश्वर इस्सर, मोक्ष मोक्ख</strong>, &amp;c. The same is the case more or less with the speakers of the other languages, so that the pure Sanskrit words that we meet with in the written modern vernaculars, may be considered modern Tadbhavas and in rare cases Prakrit Tadbhavas. The educated classes, however, in Maharashtra and Gujarat, and to a certain extent in the Hindi provinces, pronounce the Sanskrit words correctly. The Sindi, however, contains but a few pure. Sanskrit words; hence it is rich in the old Tadbhava element, while it draws largely upon the Persian and Arabic.</p>
<p>This foreign element is used in our dialects, principally in political matters. Persian and Arabic words are also used in the concerns of ordinary life. but their number is limited. The higher classes and learned men very rarely use them; while that element enters largely into the speech of the Mahomedans in the different provinces and the Parsis. And the Mahomedans in the Hindi area use such a large number of these words that their language is by some considered an independent dialect and called Urdu, but it differs from the High Hindi in nothing further than in the use of these foreign words.</p>
<p>But though the vocabulary of our languages is thus composite,</p>
<p>the grammar is in every way the same that they have inherited from the Prakrits. Here there is no mixture of different elements. A good many of the forms now in use have been constructed since the Prakrit period; but, as I hope to show you, they are simply combinations or adaptations of existing Prakrit forms. Thus we will divide our examination of the vernaculars into three branches. (I) In the first we will trace out the Sanskrit words which were transformed in the Pali and the Prakrits in the various ways we have noticed, and discover the operation of the same or other laws in their further transformation, if they have undergone any, as also in the transformation of other words which remained unchanged in the Prakrits or were imported from Sanskrit at a later period. (II) In the second we will trace out the Prakrit or Apabhramsa grammatical forms (III) and in the third, examine the new or reconstructed forms and find out the principles upon which they have been made up.</p>
<p>The phonetic changes which the words of a living language undergo involve, as a general rule, economy of exertion in its widest sense; but there are some which do not, or which require increased effort. Economy may sometimes be effected in more ways than one. For instance, the assimilation of vowels to consonants may be effected by changing <strong>अ</strong> to <strong>ओ</strong> and thence to <strong>उ</strong>, or to <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>इ</strong>. Some people have a predilection for the former, others for the latter. Again, one mode of change may be economical to some and another opposed to it to others. Thus the assimilation involved in the less open vowels <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong> is of importance to some, but of little consequence to others; and they prefer the economy arising from the change of these vowels to <strong>अ</strong> , since this does not require any movement of the tongue or the lips. Here then we have two kinds of peculiarities. Again, if an ordinary change has a very comprehensive range or is almost universal in a language, and if other ordinary changes do not keep pace with it, and are to be found only in a limited number of instances, that ordinary change must be considered to be due to a peculiar vocal habit or incapacity. The assimilation of conjuncts and of the diphthongs in the Pali and the Prakrits, and the elision of uninitial consonants in the latter, are changes of this nature. And finally, there is all the greater reason</p>
<p>for attributing changes that involve no economy or necessitate greater exertion, such as the change of dentals to cerebrals or of sonants to surds, to vocal peculiarities. These several kinds of peculiarities give distinct individualities, so far as the external forms of words are concerned, to languages derived from one and the same primitive language. Thus then, some phonetic changes are special or peculiar, and others ordinary.</p>
<p>We will now take up in order the instances observable in the Pali and the Prakrits of these two kinds of changes and trace them in the vernaculars, and also endeavour to find out whether these dialects have preserved any of the Pali and Prakrit peculiarities or developed new ones.</p>
<p>And first as regards vowels. The following are some of the in- stances with the vernacular forms of the words in which Sanskrit is <strong>ऋ</strong> changed to <strong>अ ,इ</strong> , or <strong>उ</strong> in the Prakrits:—</p>

<p>The word <strong>घृतम्</strong> has <strong>घअं</strong> in the Prakrits according to the grammarians, but <strong>घिअं</strong> also must have existed; so also <strong>भृङ्ग</strong> has <strong>भिङ्गो</strong>.</p>
<p>Some of the above words have two forms in the Prakrits, but since one of them does not occur in any of the vernaculars, it has been omitted. There are other words having two or even threePrakrit forms, one of which occurs in one of the vernaculars, and the other or others in another. Thus:—</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1. Mr. Beams considers the <strong>उ</strong> of the S.<strong>पिउ, भाउ</strong> &amp;c.,to be the nom, sing, termination and not a transformation of the Sanskrit. But he is evidently wrong, since this <strong>उ</strong> appears in the oblique cases also, as<strong>पिउजो, भाउजो</strong>. &amp;c.; while the nom. sing <strong>उ</strong> does not, as in <strong>देहजो</strong> , icon. sing of <strong>देहु</strong> &ldquo;a country&rdquo;. The words have <strong>उ</strong> even in those language, such as the P. and M., which have discarded the nom. sing. <strong>उ</strong> and it appears even in the feminine word माउ which cannot take the masculine termination <strong>उ.</strong></p>

<p>As the Pali and the Prakrit alphabet, on account of these changes, has no <strong>ऋ</strong>, so do the vernacular alphabets not possess it. Sanskrit words containing the vowel have, however, been recently imported into the languages, but since even in those words, it is not correctly pronounced except by a few learned men, it cannot be said really to exist in vernacular speech, notwithstanding the use of those words. The usual modern pronunciation of the vowel is <strong>र, रि, रु,</strong> or <strong>अर्</strong>.</p>

<p>The change of <strong>इ</strong> to <strong>ए</strong>, according to the grammarians, optional in the Prakrits and that of <strong>उ</strong>to <strong>ओ</strong>necessary. But in both cases we find two forms in the vernaculars. Still the prevailing forms in the latter are those in <strong>ओ</strong>, while those in <strong>उ</strong>are rare, and mostly to be found in Bengali and Oriya, which languages, and more especially the first, have a predilection for <strong>उ</strong>, in which case it is possible they may have changed the Prakrit <strong>ओ</strong>to <strong>उ</strong>.</p>
<p>In the Pali and Prakrits, the<strong>ए</strong>and <strong>ओ</strong> in these cases are short; but the vernaculars, having dropped one of the following double consonants, have, according to a general rule to be noticed hereafter, lengthened the vowels. When instead of a double consonant, there is a conjunct of a nasal and a mute as in <strong>सेन्दूर</strong>and <strong>तोण्ड</strong>the nasal consonant is reduced to a simple anusvāra or nasal sound, so as to give to the conjunct the character of a simple consonant, and the ए or ओ is pronounced long as in <strong>सेन्दूर</strong>and <strong>तोंड</strong>. In this manner, though the Prakrit short <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong>are, in the instances in which we possess an evidence of their existence, lengthened, I think in some of the vernaculars at least we have these vowels. For in a good many instances in Marathi and Gujarati and air are pronounced short. There is a rule which in Marathi is almost universal, and in Gujarati often observable, in virtue of which the accent or the whole weight of the sound of a word falls on the final <strong>आ</strong>or <strong>एं</strong> of nouns in the former, and the final <strong>ओ</strong> or <strong>ऊं</strong> in the latter; and the preceding vowels are rendered short while in the original Sanskrit and in Hindi they are long. Thus:—</p>
<pre><code>**\[Table 6: Treatment of long vowels in Prakrit and Modern Vernaculars\]**
</code></pre>
<p>Skr. <strong>कीटक</strong>: a worm, Pr. <strong>कीडओ</strong>, H. <strong>कीडा</strong>, M. <strong>किडा</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>कीलकः</strong> a nsil, Pr. <strong>कीलओ</strong>, H. <strong>कीला</strong>, M. <strong>खिला</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>कूपकः</strong> well, Pr, <strong>कूवओ</strong>, H. <strong>कूआ</strong>, G. <strong>कुवो</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>चित्रकः</strong> leopard, Pr. <strong>चितओ</strong>, H. <strong>चीता</strong>, M. <strong>चिता</strong>, G. <strong>चितो</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>चूडकः</strong> a bangle, Pr. <strong>चूडओ</strong>, H. <strong>चूडा</strong>, M, <strong>चुडा</strong>, G. <strong>चुडो</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>चूर्णक</strong>: lime, Pr. <strong>चुण्अओ</strong>, H. <strong>चूना</strong>, M. <strong>चुना</strong>, G, <strong>चुनो.</strong></p>
<p>And many more instances might be given. Similarly in Marathi the preceding long vowels are shortened when the terminations of the oblique cases are applied, as in <strong>भिकेस,पिकास,किडीस,</strong></p>
<p>पिठास, उनास, भुकेस, गुलास, &amp;o., dative singulars of भीक &lsquo;beggery,&rsquo; पीक &lsquo;cгор,&rsquo; &rsquo; कीड ’,a worm, ’ पीठ ’ &lsquo;flour&rsquo;,’ ऊन ’ sun, ’भूक’ ’hunger,’ ’गूल’ ’molasse’, &amp;c. If so, then by a necessary law of Marathi speech, the ए and ओ of गेल ’ gone&rsquo;, केल ’gone&rsquo; मेला ’a gathering&rsquo; जेवढा’ as much&rsquo; पेडा ’sweetmeat&rsquo; घोड ’ a horse&rsquo;, कोलसा &lsquo;charcoal&rsquo;, गोफा ’ the ankle,&rsquo; जोडा&rsquo; a pair,&rsquo; &amp;c., and of शेणास, to Gowdung,&rsquo; शेतास &rsquo;to a field,&lsquo;पेठेस &rsquo;to a market, लेकरास &rsquo;to a child,&rdquo; गोतास &rsquo;to a race, चोरस &rsquo;to a thief,&rsquo; पोरसा &rsquo;to a boy, &amp;c., must be short. And if the Marathi speaker will compare his pronunciation. of मेल, शेत, शेण, गोत, पोर, &amp;c. with that of मेला, शेताम, शेणास, गोतास, , &amp;c., he will find that the quantity of ए and ओ in these latter words is shorter than in the former. Similarly, in Gujarati the first ए and ओ of केवी &lsquo;how large,</p>
<p>पेलो mad man, छोडो ’end,&rsquo; मेलो ’upper storey,&rsquo; मेलो ’a gathering&rsquo; खेलो lap,घोढो a horse चोखा.<em>pl,</em> &lsquo;rice,&rsquo; पोलो &lsquo;broad,&rsquo; पोणा. <em>pl</em> &rsquo;three-quarters,&rdquo; &rsquo; मोगरो ’ jessamine’, कोलसो ’charcoal’, &amp;c., must be short. In Gujarati the penultimate vowel of a monosyllabic root is, as in Hindi, shortened in the causal, as in लागदुं &rsquo;to adhere,&rsquo; लगाडवुं to cause to adhere,&rsquo; &lsquo;join,&rdquo; धावडुं &rsquo; to run,&rsquo; धवाडवुं to cause to run, सीखवुं &rsquo;to learn,&rsquo; सिखाबबुं to teach,&rsquo; शीदवुं &rsquo;to sew,&rsquo; शिवाडवुं &rsquo;to cause to sew,</p>
<p>बीहडुं &rsquo;to fear,</p>
<p>&rsquo; पिहवाडवुं &rsquo;to terrify,&rsquo; &amp;o. But in Hindi the short vowels that take the place of ए and ओ areइ and उ, as in दिखान ’ to show’ from देख्ना &rsquo;to see,’ घुलाना ’to caus to wash&rsquo; from घोना &rsquo;to wash,&rsquo; &amp;c. But in Gujarati the ए and ओ are not changed to इ and उ but remain, as in देखावुडुं &rsquo;to show &lsquo;, लेपाडवुं &rsquo;to cause to take&rsquo; from लेचवुं to take,जोवाडवुं &rsquo;to cause to wash from घोबचुं &rsquo;to wash,&rsquo; जोवाडबुं &rsquo; to show from जोबडुं fo take.&rsquo; धोबाढवूं &rsquo; जोवडुं &rsquo;to see,&rsquo; &amp;c., which they cannot do by the general rule if they are long. They must therefore be pronounced short. And as a matter of fact, it will be found that the Gujarati people in these and several other cases, give a short sound to these vowels. In the Malvani dialect of Marathi ओ is very often pronounced like the English o in <em>pot,</em> and ए like <em>e</em> in <em>pet.</em> In Bengali the ओ to which अ is converted in ordinary speech is also broad and short, and we have reason to believe that both ए and ओ when they really occur in words, are often pronounced short in that and the Bhojpuri and other dialects of Bihar and Mithila,</p>
<p>It may be urged against one of the arguments I have used, that if the ए and ओ in शेतास and गोतासा are short, the first आin.</p>
<p><strong>हातास</strong> &rsquo;to the hand,&rsquo; <strong>कानास</strong> &rsquo;to the ear,&rsquo; &amp;c., must also be short, and consequently these vowels must be changed to अ . But अ is not necessarily the short form of <strong>आ</strong>, or <strong>आ</strong> the long form of <strong>अ</strong>. For in pronouncing <strong>आ</strong>the lips and the upper and lower parts of the mouth are much more widely apart from each other than in pronouncing <strong>अ</strong> ; so that the difference between the two is not simply of quantity but of quality also. The first <strong>आ</strong> of such words as <strong>हातास</strong> and
<strong>मातला</strong> &lsquo;maddened, is therefore short <strong>आ</strong>; that is, in pronouneing it, the vocal organs are in the same condition as in pionouncing long <strong>आ</strong>, but the time occupied is shorter than in the case of the latter. The <strong>अ</strong> that we have got in Sanskrit is short, but in most of the vernaculars we have a long <strong>अ</strong> which takes longer time to pronounce than the Sanskrit <strong>अ</strong> , while the oondition of the vocal organs is the same. The final <strong>अ</strong> of words is silent in the vernaculars, but at the same time the vowel of the preceding syllable is lengthened. Thus
<strong>गुण</strong> &rsquo; virtue&rsquo; &lsquo;is, as a Sanskrit word, pronounced <em>gūṇa,</em> but in Marathi and Gujarati it i</p>
<p>s</p>
<p>gūṇ</p>
<p>; and in Hindi</p>
<p>gūṇ</p>
<p>;</p>
<p>Sanskrit <strong>गुड</strong>gu-ḍa &lsquo;molasses&rsquo; is in Marathi <em>gūl</em>; Sanskrit e <strong>तिल</strong><em>ti-la</em> &lsquo;sesamum&rsquo; is in Marathi and Gujarati <em>tīl</em> and Hindi <em>til.</em> In the same way, the word <strong>रथ</strong> is in Sanskrit pronounc ed <em>ra-tha,</em> but when in vernacular pronunciation it becomes <em>rath</em>, the a is not the short <strong>अ</strong> , but <strong>अ</strong> pronounced long, as if the word were <em>ra-ath</em> without a pause between the two as. The long <strong>अ</strong> and the short are found side by side in such a word as <strong>मदन</strong>, which as pronounced in Sanskrit is <em>madana</em> with three consonants each followed by the Sanskrit or short <strong>अ</strong>. In the modern languages, however, the first syllable has its as in Sanskrit, but that of the second is lengthened, and in the last it is dropped, and the word thus becomes <em>madaan</em>.</p>
<p>This peculiarity of softening <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong> to <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong>
has been pre- served by the vernaculars. It is not necessary that a conjunct consonant should follow. Thus:-</p>

<p>The <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong> , to which <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong> are thus reduced must be short, since there is no reason here why the quantity should be increased.</p>
<p>Of the instances in which long <strong>ई</strong> and <strong>ऊ</strong> are softened to long <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong> in the Prakrits, the vernaculars have retained the following:—</p>
<p>[Table 8: change of ई and ऊ to long ए and ओ]</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>बिभीतक</strong> myrobalan, Pr. <strong>बहेडओ</strong>, M. बे<strong>हडा</strong>, G. <strong>बेहडूं</strong>. H. P. <strong>बहेडा</strong>,S. <strong>बहेडौ</strong>.</p>

<p>Skr. <strong>स्थूल</strong>, Pr. <strong>थोर</strong>, M. <strong>थोर</strong>.</p>
<p>More modern instances of this change are:—</p>

<p>O, <strong>भोक</strong> hunger, for the <strong>भूक</strong> or <strong>भूख</strong> of the others.</p>
<p>Of the few instances in which <strong>इ</strong> is softened to <strong>अ</strong> in the Prakrits, the vernaculars have retained <strong>हलद्वा</strong> in the M. G <strong>हलद</strong>, H. <strong>हलदी</strong>, 0. <strong>हलदी</strong> and P. <strong>हलहदी</strong> or <strong>हलदी</strong>. Though प<strong>डंसुआ</strong> does not occur, still <strong>पडा</strong> which stands for <strong>प्रति</strong> a in this word is preserved in several words, as M. <strong>पडसाद</strong> ,&rsquo;echo&rsquo; for Skr. <strong>प्रतिशब्द, पडजीभ</strong>, &rsquo;the uvula&rsquo; for Skr. <strong>प्रतिजिह्वा,, पडछाया</strong> Or <strong>पडसावली</strong>, H. <strong>परछाई</strong> for Skr. <strong>प्रतिच्छाया</strong> &amp;o. No more instances of this change are given by the grammarians, but, as observed in the last lecture, the substitution of <strong>अ</strong> for <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>उ</strong> in one of the two or more places in which it occurs in some words indicates a tendency in the Prakrits towards this change. The vernaculars have got more instances.Thus:—</p>
<p>[Table 10: इ changed to अ]</p>

<p>P. <strong>पंडत</strong> a learned man, Skr. <strong>पण्डित</strong>.</p>
<p>P. <strong>सगन</strong> an omen, Skr. <strong>शकुन</strong>.</p>
<p>But in Gujarati the tendency has operated very widely, as will be seen from the followingः—</p>
<p><strong>[Table11:The same उ or ऋor इ changed to अ in Gujarati ]</strong></p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>And there are many other instances, such as <strong>फरवुं</strong> &rsquo;to walk,&rsquo; <strong>टकवुं</strong> &rsquo;to last, and <strong>मरडवुं</strong> &rsquo;to twist,&rsquo; the Marathi forms of which are <strong>फिरणें, टिकणें</strong>, and <strong>मुरडणें</strong>, Thus Sanskrit Prakrit, and even foreign words such as <strong>मालूम</strong> ’known’ which becomes <strong>मालम</strong>, change their <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>उ</strong> to<strong>अ</strong> . The Gujarati people have thus got a habit of careless pronunciation. After forming the contact necessary for</p>
<p>pronouncing a consonant, they emit the breath; without compressing it at the palatal or labial position, and thus save the trouble of raising the middle of the tongue to the palate, or of rounding the lips.</p>
<p>Under the head of assimilation, the first characteristic vowel change observable in the Pali and the Prakrits which we have to notice, is that of the Sanskrit <strong>ऐ</strong> and <strong>औ</strong> to <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong>. Most of the nouns having <strong>ऐ</strong> and <strong>औ</strong> are in Sanskrit attributives formed from other nouns, and as these are formed in other ways in our language we cannot expect to find many instances of them. Still there are a good many, and enough to show that our vernaculars have inhe- rited these Pali and Prakrit transformations of the Sanskrit <strong>ऐ</strong> and <strong>औ</strong>.Thus:–</p>
<p>[Table 12 : ऐ and औ changed to ए and ओ .]</p>

<p>The Sanskrit syllables <strong>अय</strong> and<strong>अव</strong> are, you will remember, often changed to <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong> it in the Pali and the Prakrits. The following instances of this change have come down to the vernsculars :-</p>
<p>[ Table 13 : अयं and अव changed to ए and ओ ]</p>

<p>M. <strong>बोर</strong> jujube fruit Pr. <strong>बो</strong>र for <strong>बवर</strong> or <strong>बअर</strong>, Skr. <strong>बदर</strong>.</p>
<p>The Pali and the Prakrits on account of these changes lost the Sanskrit diphthongs <strong>ऐ</strong> and<strong>औ</strong>. But several of the vernaculars have got them back by combining the vowels <strong>अ</strong> and <strong>इ</strong>,and <strong>अ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong>, short or long, brought together by the elision of consonants in the Prakrits. A hiatus, which requires the intonated breath to be let off twice successively without being stopped or compressed, is mostly felt to be burdensome, and is in consequence avoided in several ways. Where the two vowels can combine into one sound, a diphthong is formed out of them. Thus <strong>ऐ</strong> and <strong>औ</strong> and<strong>औ</strong> are combinations of <strong>अइ</strong> and <strong>अउ</strong>. In pronouncing these last, the breath has to be emitted twice, while in sounding the former, the same current is first let off through the position of <strong>अ</strong>, and afterwards through that of <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong>. The first part of the diphthong is thus a very short <strong>अ</strong>, to which half a mātrā, as previously observed, has been allowed by the grammarians. The following are instances of this formation:—</p>
<p>[Table 14: अ and इ combined into ऐ]</p>
<p>skr. <strong>प्रविष्ट</strong> entered, Pr.<strong>पइठ्ठ</strong> , H. old M.<strong>पैठा.</strong></p>
<p>Skr. <strong>उपविश</strong> sit, Pr. <strong>उवइस</strong> M. H. <strong>वैमणें-ना</strong> by the dropping of the initial <strong>उ</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>उपविष्ट</strong> sat, Pr. <strong>उवइठ्ठ</strong> , H. P. <strong>बैठा</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>खदिर</strong> name of a tree, Pr. <strong>खइर</strong>, , M. P. H. <strong>खैर</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>कपित्थ</strong> name of a tree, Pr.<strong>कवित्थ</strong>, H. <strong>कैथ</strong> bydropping <strong>इ</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr.<strong>बलीवर्द</strong> a bull, Pr.<strong>बइल्ल</strong> , M. H. P. <strong>बैल.</strong></p>
<p>Skr. <strong>तादृश</strong> like that, Pr.<strong>तादिस</strong>, Apabhr, <strong>तइस</strong>, M. H. P.<strong>तैसा</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>महिषी</strong> a female buffalo, Pr.<strong>महीसी</strong>, M. <strong>ह्यैस</strong> H**. भैंस, P. मैंह;**or <strong>मैंस</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>भगिनी</strong> sister, Pr.<strong>भइणी</strong> , P. M. (dial.),<strong>भैण</strong> H.<strong>बैन</strong> (more commonly <strong>बहिन</strong>. )</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>बृहस्पति</strong> a certain god, Pr.<strong>बिहप्फई</strong>, H.<strong>बिफै</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>मलिन</strong> dirty, Pr. <strong>मइल</strong> , H. P. <strong>मैल</strong>, old M. <strong>मैल</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>पवित्रक</strong> holy thread, Pr. <strong>पवित्तअ</strong>, B. <strong>पैता</strong>.</p>
<p>In this manner the Hindi, Marathi and Panjabi combine <strong>अ</strong> and <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>ई</strong> into <strong>ऐ</strong>. Sometimes the <strong>ऐ</strong> so formed is dropped by the Marathi, and we have optionally <strong>बसणें</strong> for <strong>बैसणेंं</strong>, <strong>म्हस</strong> for <strong>म्हैस</strong> and <strong>तसा</strong> for <strong>तैसा</strong> . Bengali, and Oriya have <strong>बस</strong> for.<strong>बैस</strong>. The former has <strong>बैस</strong> in addition, so that these languages also seem to have once formed out of the two vowels.</p>
<p>[Table 15: अ and उ combined into औ ]</p>
<p>Skr.<strong>मुकुट</strong> a chaplet, Pr. <strong>मउड</strong>, H. P.<strong>मौडा</strong> , B. O. <strong>मउड</strong>.</p>

<p>Skr. <strong>चतुष्क</strong> a squale, Pr. <strong>चउक्क</strong>, M. H. P. <strong>चौक</strong>. Similarly other compounds of <strong>चतुर्</strong>; <strong>चौरस</strong>, <strong>चौकोन, चौमास</strong> &amp;c., B. O.S. also have <strong>चौ</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr, <strong>ज्येष्ठपुत्र</strong> the son of an elder brother, Pr. <strong>जेठ्ठउत्त</strong>, H, <strong>जेठौत</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>मधुमक्षिका</strong> a bee, Pr. <strong>महुमक्खिआ</strong>, H. <strong>मौमाखी</strong>by dropping <strong>हू.</strong></p>
<p>Skr.<strong>वधू</strong> a girl, a daughter-in-law, Pr.<strong>बहु</strong> , O. <strong>बौ</strong>.</p>
<p>When sometimes the Prakrits combined <strong>अ</strong> and <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>अ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong>. they formed <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong> out of them. For, as we have seen, the passage from one position to another in the same breath was impossible to the speakers of the Prakrits and the Pali. Thus wel have <strong>मोर</strong> for <strong>मऊर</strong>, Skr. <strong>मयूर</strong>; <strong>थेर</strong> for <strong>थइर</strong>, Skr. <strong>स्थविर</strong> ;<strong>चोत्थ</strong> for <strong>चउत्थ</strong>, Skr. <strong>चतुर्थ</strong> ;<strong>चोग्गुण</strong> for <strong>चउग्गुण</strong>, Skr. <strong>चतुर्गुण</strong> &amp;o.</p>
<p>Similarly <strong>अय</strong> and <strong>अव</strong> form <strong>ऐ</strong> and <strong>औ</strong> in the vernaculars. When final <strong>अ</strong> of <strong>य</strong> and <strong>व</strong> is not pronounced, these semi-vowels easily pass into <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong> which with the previous <strong>अ</strong> form those diphthongs:—</p>
<p>[ Table 16: अय changed to ऐ ]</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>मदन</strong> god of love, Pr. <strong>मअण</strong> or <strong>मयण</strong>, H. <strong>मैन</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>रजनी</strong> night, Pr. <strong>रअणी</strong> or <strong>रयणी</strong>, H. P. <strong>रैन</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr <strong>नयन</strong> the eye, H. <strong>नैन</strong>, P. <strong>नैण</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>भय</strong> fear, H. P. <strong>भै</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>जय</strong> victory, H. P. <strong>जै</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>शत</strong> a hundred, Pr. <strong>सअ</strong> or, <strong>सय</strong>, H. P. <strong>सै</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr.<strong>वचन</strong> speech, Pr. <strong>वअण</strong> or <strong>वयण</strong>, H. <strong>बैन</strong>.</p>
<p>The Marathi does not follow the Hindi and Panjabi here. For, according to the modern way of pronunciation as observed before, the final of words not being pronounced, the vowel of the preceding syllable is lengthened. The <strong>अ</strong> of the first syllable of <strong>भय</strong>and <strong>जय</strong> being thus long, prevents the formation of; while that of being so in such words as <strong>नयन</strong> that semivowel is not reduced to <strong>इ ,</strong> and hence we have no <strong>ऐ</strong>. But these obstacles are set aside in the Hindi and the Panjabi, the tendency to form the diphthongs being strong. When however, the Marathi was in a state of formation it retained the Prakrit peculiarity and changed the syllable <strong>अय</strong> to <strong>ए</strong>, as in <strong>शें</strong> for <strong>शतम्</strong> , <strong>भे</strong>( old ) for <strong>भय</strong>, <strong>एं</strong> of neuter nouns such as <strong>केलें</strong> and <strong>ताम्बें</strong> for the <strong>अयं</strong> of the Prakrit <strong>केलयं</strong> and <strong>तम्बय,के</strong> and <strong>गे</strong> of <strong>केला</strong> and <strong>गेला</strong> for the Prakrit <strong>कय</strong> and <strong>गय</strong> ,&amp;c.This change is due to a weakened pronunciation of <strong>य</strong>. In modern times even <strong>य</strong> is often sounded like <strong>ए</strong>. For, in producing these two sounds the middle of the tongue being raised, the forepart. falls lower than in sounding <strong>इ</strong>. When, therefore, in pronouncing and <strong>य</strong>, the middle is not raised sufficiently high, the sound becomes <strong>ए</strong> and not <strong>इ</strong>, because this requires the forepart also to be raised higher.</p>
<p>Thus in the following instances <strong>अव</strong> changed to <strong>औ</strong>) :—</p>
<p><strong>[ Table 17: अव changed to औ ]</strong></p>
<p>Skr. <strong>धबल</strong> white, Pr. <strong>धवल</strong>, H. P. <strong>धौला</strong>, M. <strong>धवला</strong>.</p>

<p>Here the Panjabi and the Hindi agree perfectly; but the Marathi is not decided, sometimes changing the syllable to <strong>ओ</strong> but more often. for the reasons given in the case of <strong>अय</strong>, retaining it as it is in the original, the <strong>अव</strong>, however, being pronounced like <strong>अव</strong> in some cases, and <strong>अव</strong> with long final <strong>अ</strong> in others. Hindi and Panjabi similarly treat <strong>आइ</strong> or <strong>आई</strong> and <strong>आय</strong> and <strong>आउ</strong> or <strong>आऊ</strong> and <strong>आव</strong> , while the Marathi here completely parts from them. For the <strong>आ</strong> in these syllables is too strong a sound for the Marathi ear to pass off into the very short <strong>अ</strong> of half a mātrā. Even the Hindi preserves <strong>आय</strong> unchanged in a good many cases, as <strong>बाय</strong> for Pr. <strong>वाय</strong>, Skr. <strong>वात</strong> &lsquo;wind.&rdquo;</p>

Pr.<strong>पउत्ति</strong>, Skr. <strong>प्रकृति</strong>;<strong>पातोहू</strong> &lsquo;son&rsquo;s wife Pr.<strong>पुत्तवहु</strong> ,Skr. <strong>पुत्रवधू</strong>; <strong>भादो</strong> &rsquo;name of a month, Pr.<strong>भइवअ</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>भाद्रपद</strong> &amp;c. in which <strong>अइ</strong> forms <strong>ए</strong>. and <strong>अउ</strong> and <strong>अव</strong>, <strong>ओ</strong>; but it will appear that the prevailing rule in that language and in the Panjabi is to change these vowels and semi-vowels into <strong>ऐ</strong> or <strong>औ</strong>. The Braj dialect of Hindi is thoroughly consistent in this respect, having <strong>ऐ</strong> and <strong>औ</strong> even in its grammatical terminations, as <strong>कौ</strong> for High H. <strong>को, करै</strong> for <strong>करे, करौं</strong> for <strong>करूं, करौ</strong> for <strong>करो</strong>, &amp;c. The Marathi agrees with these dialects perfectly only as respects <strong>अ + इ</strong> and <strong>अ+उ</strong>; and the Bengali and Oriya, if we look to the few traces, that they have retained of these Prakrit syllables, seem to agree with the Marathi. But the Gujarati has throughout <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong> for the Hindi and Panjabi <strong>ऐ</strong> and <strong>औ</strong> ; and the Sindhi follows the Gujarati a great way. The Gujarati and Sindhi forms of the words occurring in tables 14-19, are as follows:–</p>

<p>Similarly, though a few Sanskrit words containing <strong>ऐ</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong> do occur in Gujarati dictionaries, these diphthongs are generally pronounced like <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong> as in <strong>जने</strong> for <strong>जैन</strong> ’a follower of the Jaina sec’,<strong>वेर</strong> for <strong>वैर</strong>&rsquo;enmity&rsquo;, &amp;c. The Gujarati, therefore, like the old Prakrits combines <strong>अय</strong> and <strong>अव</strong> and <strong>अइ</strong> and <strong>अउ</strong> into <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong> and since it did not receive the diphthongs <strong>ऐ</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong> from the old Prakrits, its alphabet really does not contain them. As observed before, the syllables <strong>अइ</strong> and <strong>अउ</strong> differ from <strong>ऐ</strong> and <strong>औ</strong> only in two currents of breath being emitted instead of one, in other respects they are alike, both the vowel sounds being contained in the diphthongs. Those syllables as well as <strong>अय</strong> and <strong>अव</strong> should, therefore, naturally pass into those diphthongs as involving the least possible change. If, notwithstanding, the Gujarati people make <strong>ए</strong> or <strong>ओ</strong> out of them, and also give those forms to the <strong>ऐ</strong> and <strong>औ</strong> of Sanskrit and foreign words, it must be so, because their vocal organs are in this respect in the same condition as those of their Pali and Prakrit ancestors. On the other hand, the Hindi, and especially the Braj form of it, presents the old Aryan tendency of pronouncing the diphthongs in somewhat exaggerated form; while the other dialects take up a position between these two in this respect.</p>
<p>Of the words in which an open vowel is changed to one more close, and an approach towards an assimilation to a consonant is thus effected, the vernaculars have preserved the following:–</p>
<p>[Table 22 : Change of vowels and assimilation of Consonants ]</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>पक्वम्</strong> ripe, Pr. <strong>पिक्कं</strong>or <strong>पक्कं</strong>, M. <strong>पिकें</strong>, G. <strong>पाकु</strong>, H. P. <strong>पक्का</strong>, S. <strong>पको</strong>, B. <strong>पाका</strong>, O, <strong>पक्का</strong>or <strong>पाक</strong> in <strong>पाकला</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>अङ्गारः</strong> ember, Pr. <strong>इङ्गालो</strong> or <strong>अङ्गारो</strong> M. (dial) <strong>ईगल, इंगलो</strong>, M. <strong>आंगारा</strong>, the rest <strong>अंगार</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>ललाटम्</strong> forehead, Pr.<strong>णिडालं</strong> or <strong>णडालं</strong>, M. <strong>निडल</strong>, S. <strong>निराडु</strong>,</p>
<p>Skr, <strong>दत्तम्</strong>, Pr, <strong>दण्णं</strong>, H. <strong>दिन</strong>, P. <strong>दित्ता</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>कन्दुकः</strong>&amp; ball, Pr. <strong>गेन्दुओ</strong> H. <strong>गेंदा</strong>, P. <strong>गेंद</strong>, M. <strong>गेंद</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr.<strong>अत्र</strong>, Pr.<strong>एत्थ</strong>, M**.एथ**.</p>
<p>In a great many more instances,<strong>अ</strong> is thus changed in the vernaculars, and not only before conjuncts as is mostly the case in the Prakrits, but before simple consonants also.</p>
<p>[Table 23 : अ changed to इ in Sindhi]</p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>The Sindhi has the largest number of instances, and this change of <strong>अ</strong> to <strong>इ</strong> constitutes a peculiarity of that language. The Hindi has got a good many, and the Panjabi follows it in almost all cases. Marathi has but a few stray instances, but sometimes, as in <strong>शिवणें</strong> &rsquo;to touch’, H. <strong>छूना</strong>, Skr. <strong>छुप</strong>, but Pr. <strong>छिव</strong>, and in <strong>मिशी</strong>, <strong>इ</strong> takes the place of <strong>उ</strong> also.</p>
<p>The Gujarati has <strong>पिंगलवुं</strong> for <strong>प्रगलनम्</strong> and <strong>ईण्डुं</strong> &lsquo;an egg&rsquo;, for <strong>अण्डकम्</strong> but not many more cases. Bengali and Oriya have also but few instances, and even in most of these, and in those of the Marathi as well as in the Hindi <strong>पिंजरा</strong> and <strong>जिमना</strong>, the <strong>इ</strong> may be regarded as arising from the influence of the neighbouring palatal consonant.</p>
<p>The following are instances in which <strong>अ</strong>, and in one case <strong>आ</strong>, are changed to <strong>ए</strong> :—</p>
<p>[ Table 24</p>
<p>:</p>
<p>अ and आ changed to ए ]</p>
<p>H. <strong>मेंडुक</strong> or <strong>मेडुक</strong>, P. <strong>मेंडुक</strong>, G. <strong>मेंडक</strong>, M. <strong>बेडूक</strong>, Skr, <strong>मण्डूक</strong>.</p>
<p>H. <strong>सेंबल</strong> or <strong>सेमल</strong>, M. <strong>शेवरी</strong> or <strong>सांवरी</strong>, Skr. <strong>शाल्मली</strong>, Pr. <strong>सामरी</strong> or <strong>सिम्बली</strong>.</p>
<p>H. <strong>नेवना</strong> to bow, P. <strong>नेउणा</strong>, M. <strong>लवणें</strong>, Skr. <strong>नमन</strong>.</p>
<p>H. <strong>नेवल</strong> a mungoose, P. <strong>नेउल</strong>, Skr. <strong>नकुल</strong>, Pr. <strong>नउल</strong>.</p>
<p>H. जे<strong>वना</strong> to eat, P. <strong>जेउणा</strong>, M. <strong>जेवणें</strong>, G. <strong>जमवुं</strong>, Skr <strong>जमन</strong>.</p>
<p>M. <strong>उजेड</strong> light, Pr. <strong>उज्जाल</strong>, Skr. <strong>उज्ज्वल</strong>.</p>
<p>M. <strong>शेण</strong> cowdung, G. <strong>छाण</strong>, Skr.शक्ना instr. sing.</p>
<p>M. <strong>ठेवणें</strong> to keep Skr. <strong>स्थापन</strong> Pr. <strong>ठावण</strong>.</p>
<p>G.<strong>केहबुं</strong> to sell, <strong>सेहबुं</strong>. to endure, <strong>रेहबुं</strong> to dwell, &amp;c., before <strong>ह्</strong> followed by ,<strong>अ</strong> for <strong>कथ</strong> <strong>सह</strong>,&amp;c.</p>
<p>But even here the <strong>ए</strong> of the Marathi <strong>शेवरी, शेण,जेवणें</strong>, and <strong>उजेड</strong>, as of the Hindi,<strong>जेवना</strong> may be attributed to the influence of the preceding palatal.</p>
<p>In the Prakrits there are two instances of the change of <strong>अ</strong> to <strong>उ</strong>, viz. <strong>चुड</strong>and <strong>खुडिओ</strong> for Skr. <strong>चण्ड</strong> &lsquo;fierce‛and <strong>सण्डित</strong> ‛plucked out‛. The latter we have in the vernaculars in the form of <strong>खूट</strong> M. G., <strong>खुटि</strong> S. ‛deficiency‛<strong>खोट</strong> H., <strong>खोड</strong> M. ‛blemish‛and <strong>खुडणें</strong> or <strong>खुटणें</strong> M., <strong>खुटना</strong> H., <strong>खुंटवुं</strong> G. ‛to pluck put‛or <strong>खुटवुं</strong> G. ‛to be deficient‛. The Bengali changes <strong>अ</strong> to <strong>उ</strong> in a good many casesas:—</p>

<p>And where the Sanskrit or the sister dialects have <strong>ओ</strong> , the Bengali has <strong>उ</strong> as in the following words:—</p>
<p>[Table 26 : Skr ओ sit changed to उ in Bengali ]</p>
<p>B. <strong>चुरि</strong> theft, Skr. <strong>चोरिका</strong>, M. H. <strong>चोरी</strong>.</p>
<p>B. <strong>मुचि</strong> a shoemaker, M. H. <strong>मोची</strong>.</p>
<p>B. <strong>पुलि</strong> cake, Skr. <strong>पोलिका</strong> or <strong>पुलिका.</strong> M. <strong>पाली</strong>.</p>
<p>B. <strong>छुडी</strong> a girl, G, <strong>छोडी</strong>.</p>
<p>B. <strong>पु्डन</strong> burning, M. <strong>पोलणें</strong>.</p>
<p>B. <strong>खुदन</strong> digging, H. <strong>खोदना</strong>, M. <strong>खोद</strong>णें.</p>
<p>B. <strong>खुज</strong>न searching, H. <strong>खोजना</strong>.</p>
<p>Thus <strong>उ</strong>, whether for <strong>अ</strong> or <strong>ओ</strong> , is a characteristic of the Bengali.But this characteristic is very likely connected connected with another which distinguishes the Bengali language, viz., to pronounce the non-final <strong>अ</strong> in all cases as a short and broad <strong>ओ</strong> like that in the English word <em>pot.</em> I have observed before that the assimilation of vowels to consonants might be affected by narrowing the passage of the breath by an upward movement of the tongue near the palatal position, or by rounding the lips. Which of these modes is resorted to, depends on the peculiar vocal tendencies of &amp; people. Thus then, to change <strong>अ</strong> to <strong>ए</strong> or <strong>इ</strong> is a peculiarity of the Sindhi, the Panjabi, and the Hindi, and to short <strong>ओ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong> of the Bengali.</p>
<p>The following Prakrit instances of the assimilation of the different vowels of a word have come down to the vernaculars:—</p>
<p>[Table 27 : Assimilation of different vowels of a word]</p>
<p>M. G. P. <strong>वेल</strong> a creeper, H.P. <strong>वेल</strong>, Pr.<strong>वेल्ली</strong>, Skr. <strong>वल्लि</strong>. S.<strong>वल्लि</strong> , Pr.<strong>वल्ली.</strong></p>
<p>M <strong>ऊंस</strong>. sugarcane, H.<strong>ऊख</strong> , Pr. <strong>ऊच्छू</strong>, Skr. <strong>इक्षु</strong>. H. has <strong>इख</strong> also, and P. <strong>इक्ख</strong>.</p>
<p>H. P. S. <strong>सेज</strong> a bed, M. G.<strong>शेज</strong>, Pr.<strong>सेज्जा</strong> , Skr. <strong>शय्या</strong>.</p>
<p>M. <strong>मिरीं</strong>, S. <strong>मिरी</strong> pepper, Pr. <strong>मिरिअं</strong>, Skr, <strong>मरिचम्.</strong></p>
<p>M. <strong>ओपणें</strong> to give over, sssign, Pr. <strong>ओप्प</strong>, Skr. <strong>अर्प</strong>.</p>
<p>There are a few modern instances as in:—</p>
<p>[Table 28: the Assimilation of vowels]</p>
<p>S. <strong>मोहि</strong> a buffalo, Pr. <strong>महिस</strong>.</p>
<p>H, <strong>इम्ली</strong> tamarind tree, Skr. <strong>अम्लि</strong>का.</p>
<p>H. P. <strong>लोहूं</strong> blood, Pr. <strong>लोहिअ</strong>, Skr. <strong>लोहित</strong>.</p>
<p>H. <strong>जुगून</strong> a glow-worm, Pr. <strong>जोइङ्गण</strong>?, Skr. <strong>ज्योतिरिङ्गण</strong>.</p>
<p>H. <strong>तिरिच्छ</strong> askance, Pr. <strong>तिरच्छ</strong> Skr. <strong>तिरश्चः ,</strong> in <strong>तिरश्छ, तिरश्चा</strong> .&amp;c.</p>
<p>P. <strong>उंगुल</strong> or <strong>उंगुली</strong> a finger, Skr.<strong>अङ्गुलि</strong>.</p>
<p>Examples of the change of <strong>अ</strong> to <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>ए</strong> under the influence of a palatal consonant have been given in Table 24.</p>
<p>Of the words in which one of two similar vowels is made dissimilar or changed to अ in the Prakrits the vernaculars have preserved the following :—</p>
<p>[Table 29: Dissimilation of vowels]</p>
<p>Skr.<strong>बिभीतक</strong>, Pr., &amp;c., as in table 8.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>हरीतकी</strong> myrobalan, Pr. <strong>हरडई</strong>, M. <strong>हरडी</strong>, S. <strong>हरी</strong>ड.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>मुकुटः</strong>a crown, Pr, <strong>मउडो</strong>, H. <strong>मौड</strong>, G. <strong>मोड</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>मुकुल</strong>: a bud, Pr. <strong>मउलो</strong>, P. <strong>मौल</strong> in <strong>मौलना</strong> to bud.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>शिथिलम्</strong> loose, Pr. <strong>सडिलं</strong> or <strong>सिडिलं</strong>, M. <strong>सढल</strong> in the sense of &rsquo;loose of hand&rsquo; or &rsquo;liberal&rsquo;, H. B. O. <strong>ढीला</strong>, S.<strong>डिरो</strong> or <strong>डरो</strong>, G. <strong>डीलुं</strong> In these the first syllable in elided.</p>
<p>Sindhi has <strong>हिलिडो</strong> also for<strong>सिडिल</strong> in which tha last two consonants have interchanged places <strong>स्</strong> and is changed to</p>
<p><strong>द्</strong>.</p>
<p>Moders instances of this change are:—</p>
<p>[Table 30: Dissimilation of Vowels]</p>

<p>H, P. <strong>जनेऊ</strong>, from <strong>जण्णोऊअ</strong>, Pr. <strong>जण्णोवईअ</strong>?, Skr.<strong>यज्ञोपवीत.</strong></p>
<p>Here, as well as in the Prakrits, one of the two similar vowels is oftener changed to <strong>अ</strong> than to <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>उ</strong>.</p>
<p>In the Prakrits, you will remember, there are a few instances in which the vowels of the different syllables composing a word exchange places, or the close vowel of one is transferred to another. Of these the M. has <strong>विंचू</strong> &lsquo;scorpion&rsquo;, H. and P. <strong>बिच्छु</strong>, S. <strong>विछुं</strong>and B. and O. <strong>बिछा</strong>. There are a good many more modern instances.</p>

<p>P. <strong>पुर</strong>above, Skr.<strong>उपरी</strong>.</p>
<p>M. <strong>ओंजल</strong> a cavity made by joining the hands, from the word <strong>अंजुली</strong>existing in old Marathi,      and <strong>अंजुली</strong>existing in H. made up on the analogy of the Skr. <strong>अङ्गुलि</strong>.</p>

<p>Of the Prakrit words with a syllable lengthened or shortened through the influence of an accent of some sort, the vernaculars have preserved a few words. Thus:—</p>
<p>[Table 32: Shortoning of syllables through accent]</p>

<p>ACCENT IN MODERN VERNACULARS</p>
<p>In modern vernacular pronunciation, there is a law of accentuation, which has produced important results. The penultimate syllable of a word is, in all our dialects, pronounced with a stress,</p>
<p>the tendency of which is to lengthen that syllable and drop the final vowel. In most of them, this tendency has worked itself out thoroughly. The preceding vowel, however, is not always written. long, but still the long or at least the emphasized pronunciation does exist. I have already given <a href="http://#" title="Pp. 394ff.">instances</a> in which while the final <strong>अ</strong> is silent or dropped, the<strong>इ</strong>or <strong>उ</strong>of the preceding syllable is lengthened, and have shown that when that syllable has , it also is pronounced long though not changed to <strong>आ</strong>. The final <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>उ</strong>of Sanskrit words, recently imported into the languages, have been dropped in virtue of this law of accentuation. Thus :—</p>
<p>[Table 33: Skr, इ final dropped through accent]</p>
<p>M. H. G. <strong>पद्धत</strong> method, mode, Skr. <strong>पद्धति</strong>.</p>
<p>M. H. G. P. <strong>गत</strong>condition, Skr. <strong>गति</strong>.</p>

<p>H. P. <strong>साध</strong>a good man, Skr. <strong>साधु</strong>.</p>
<p>M. G. H. P. <strong>मध</strong>honey, Skr. <strong>मधु</strong>.</p>
<p>Bengali and Oriya authors hardly represent the proper vernacular pronunciation. Such words as the above, therefore, do not but probably they do exist. In Sindhi, however, here as well as in other instances to be given, the tendency of this law of accentuation is but partially realised, and such of the above words, as exist in that language, preserve their Sanskrit endings; as <strong>राहि</strong>, or <strong>रासि, जाति, रीति,</strong> &amp;c. Not only does this law characterise the vernacular speech of the day, but it must have been in &lsquo;operation for centuries, since the old Prakrit words, which like. the above, have not recently been imported, but have descended</p>
<p>to the modern languages from the spoken dialects af ancient times, have also been similarly ohanged, Thus:—</p>

<p>Here also the Sindhi preserves the old endings in some cases, and has dropped them in others. In this manner, the final <strong>आ, इ, ई, उ</strong> and
<strong>ऊ</strong> of Sanskrit and Prakrit nouns have been dropped in the vernaculars or changed to a silent <strong>अ</strong>.</p>
<p>Final <strong>ओ</strong> is similarly treated. Even in the Apabhraṁśa period, this rule of accentuation must have prevailed, since the ending vowels are similarly shortened in a good many cases. You will remember that the Prakrit <strong>ओ</strong> of the nominative singular of masculine nouns is mostly shortened to <strong>उ</strong> in that dialect, and sometimes altogether dropped. The modern vernaculars have thus got a great many masculine nouns ending in the silent <strong>अ</strong>, such ss <strong>हात</strong> or <strong>हाथ</strong> &lsquo;hand&rsquo;, <strong>कान</strong> &rsquo;ear&rsquo;, <strong>दांत</strong> &rsquo;tooth&rsquo;, <strong>धीट</strong> &lsquo;bold&rsquo;, <strong>वड</strong> &rsquo;the Bunyan tree&rsquo;, &amp;c. But as before, the Sindhi has in all these. cases preserved the <strong>उ</strong>; as <strong>हथु, कनु, दंतु, डीटु पहु,</strong> &amp;c.</p>
<p>When the final vowel is preceded by another and not by a consonant as in the words just mentioned and in others given. in the above lists, that other vowel being accented by our rule shows a tendency to become long, and the original unaccented final being dropped, the accented vowel becomes final. Thus:—</p>

<p>Thus then the Sanskrit Prakrit penultimate vowels become final in the vernaculars, and being originally accented in consequence of the law we have been considering, retain that accent in most cases, and are thus lengthened. When the penultimate happens to be <strong>अ</strong> it is lengthened to <strong>आ</strong> as in the following:—</p>

<p>It may be urged that in modern prcnunciation when the penultimate <strong>अ</strong> is accented, it does not become <strong>आ</strong> even though pronounced long, as observed before. How is it then that it becomes <strong>आ</strong> here? In modern times several new modes of pronunciation have arisen, but as regards the matter in hand, to lengthen <strong>अ</strong> into <strong>आ</strong> was the old process. And often when the old processes have disappeared from what is considered the standerd form of a language, they are found preserved in some dialect of that language. Thus, while in the standard Marathi the penultimate <strong>अ</strong> is simply pronounced long, it becomes आ in the Goanese and Malvani dialects.<br>

<p>In this manner, then, the penultimate <strong>अ</strong> in consequence of the accent became <strong>आ</strong>, and the final <strong>उ</strong> and the <strong>अ</strong> of the final <strong>अं</strong> being dropped, itself became final, and has preserved its accent.</p>
<p>An unaccented <strong>अ, आ</strong>, or <strong>उ</strong> is, you will have observed from the above instances, dropped after a close or dissimilar vowel. For, if preserved, its effect would be to change the preceding close vowel to the corresponding semi-vowel. But being accented, that vowel resists the influence and in its turn overpowers the unaccented, and consequently weak, vowel. But when it is possible to combine both into one sound the final is sometimes not dropped.</p>
<p>Thus the <strong>अ</strong> stand <strong>उ</strong> in the above examples are combined into <strong>ओ</strong> in the Gujarati, the Sindhi, and the Goanese, Malvani, and Chitpavni dialects of the Marathi, and the Marvari, Mevari, Kumaoni, and Garhavali dialects of the Hindi; and we have <strong>घोडो, पारो, आंवलो</strong>, or <strong>आंवलो, आंबाडी, बेहडो, कांटो, गोलो, सालो, दिवो, मांचो्,</strong> and <strong>किडो</strong>.</p>
<p>When <strong>अ</strong> follows anothe <strong>आ</strong> , the former, you will remember, is generally changed to a light <strong>य</strong> in the Prakrits. Those dialects tolerated a hiatus when one or both of the vowels were close. But <strong>अ</strong> or <strong>आ</strong> followed by <strong>अ</strong> or <strong>आ</strong> required two complete openings of the mouth, which could not be borne, and hence a close sound <strong>ए</strong> was interposed. Thus <strong>मत्थअं</strong> and <strong>कडअं</strong> , in the above, became <strong>मत्थयं</strong> and <strong>कछयं</strong>, and the <strong>य</strong> being almost as light as the vowel <strong>इ</strong> and being unaccented, is dropped in the Malvani and the other dialects; but in the standard Marathi, as formerly observed, the <strong>अ</strong> and <strong>यं</strong> are combined into <strong>एं</strong>, and so we have <strong>मायें</strong> and <strong>कडें</strong>.</p>
<p>In the Apabhramsa, you will remember, the masculine termination <strong>उ</strong> is transferred by analogy to neuter nouns, and Hemacandra tells us that neuter nouns having a <strong>क</strong> at the end do not drop their nasal termination. Thus, we have <strong>मत्थउं</strong> and <strong>कडउं</strong> from which by combination we have the Gujarati <strong>माथूं</strong> and <strong>कडूं</strong>. Here the nasal sound gives a sort of fixity to the vowel, and hence it does not pass into <strong>ओ</strong> as in the case of masculine nouns, but absorbs the preceding <strong>अ</strong>. The <strong>ओ, एं</strong> and <strong>उ</strong> thus formed are accented like the <strong>आ</strong> of the masculine nouns in the Marathi and others, since they contain the accented penultimate.</p>
<p>Similarly, final unaccented <strong>इ</strong> is not dropped after <strong>अ</strong> or <strong>आ</strong>, but is slurred over and the least possible time is allowed to it, in consequence of which it sounds like the consonant <strong>ए</strong>, and thus forms a sort of diphthong with the preceding <strong>अ</strong> or <strong>आ</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>[Table 38 A: Pr. final changed to य् ]</strong></p>
<p>M. <strong>वह</strong> or <strong>वय्</strong>hedge, Pr. <strong>वइ</strong>, Skr. <strong>वृति</strong>.</p>

<p>H. <strong>बहनोइ</strong>sister&rsquo;s husband, Pr. <strong>भइणीवइ</strong>, Skr. <strong>भगिनीपति</strong>.</p>
<p>Sometimes the final vowel <strong>इ</strong> absorbs the preceding <strong>अ</strong>; as in</p>
<p>[Table 38 B: Pr. final इ merged in preceding अ]</p>
<p>G. <strong>बनेवी</strong> for <strong>बहनोइ</strong>.</p>
<p>M. <strong>शेणवी</strong>.</p>
<p>M. <strong>दलवी</strong> for Pr. <strong>दलवइ</strong>, Skr <strong>दलपति</strong>.</p>
<p>You will have seen that the Sanskrit nouns, composed of three or more syllables, given in Table 36, with <strong>अ</strong> at for their penultimate. vowel and <strong>क</strong>or any other similar syllable ending in for the final, have dropped one syllable and become nouns ending in <strong>आ</strong> in Marathi, Hindi, Panjabi, and Bengali, and in Oriya also in some cases, and in <strong>ओ</strong>in Gujarati, Sindhi, and in the dialects of the Marathi and Hindi spoken of above. Such of them as are neuter have acquired the ending <strong>एं</strong> or <strong>आं</strong>in Marathi and in <strong>ऊं</strong> in Gujarati.</p>
<p>But these are not the only nouns with a final <strong>आ</strong>and <strong>ओ</strong>and <strong>एं, आं</strong>and <strong>ऊं</strong> in these languages. There are a good many more, both substantives and adjectives, which have these endings. In the Brajabhāṣa also a great many adjectives, nominal and verbal, end in <strong>ओ</strong>or <strong>औ</strong>. The Sanskrit words from which they are derived. are not composed of three syllables, with <strong>क</strong> or another syllable like it preceded by an <strong>अ</strong>, as the final. Thus the substantives H. M. <strong>श्चेला</strong> ‘adisciple&rsquo;, <strong>पुडा</strong>&lsquo;a parcel&rsquo;, <strong>काढा</strong> &rsquo; a decoction, and the adjectives H. <strong>नीला</strong>,M. <strong>निला</strong>&lsquo;blue&rsquo; H. <strong>पीला</strong>, M.<strong>पिलला</strong> ’yellow&rsquo;, and past participles, H. <strong>गया</strong> &lsquo;gone&rsquo;, <strong>मुवा</strong>&lsquo;dead&rsquo;, M.<strong>गेला, मेला</strong>&amp;c., and the corresponding Gujarati, <strong>चेलो, पुढो, काढो, नीलो, पीलो, गयो</strong> and <strong>मुवो</strong>,are</p>
<p>derived from the Sanskrit <strong>चेटः, पुटः, क्वाथः,नीलः, पीतलः</strong>, &amp;c. Similarly such neuter nouns as M. <strong>केलें</strong>(dial.<strong>केलां</strong>), G.<strong>केलुं</strong>M. (dial. <strong>सोनां</strong>), G.<strong>सोनूं</strong> are derived from the Skr. <strong>कदलम्</strong>and <strong>सुवर्णम्</strong>. How then did they get their <strong>आ</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong>and <strong>आं, एं</strong> and <strong>ऊं</strong> ?</p>
<p>A great many nouns in our languages end in , which has now become silent; and these, as I have explained, are derived from the Sanskrit nouns ending in <strong>अ</strong>, the nominative termination being, because it was unaccented, at first reduced to<strong>उ</strong> and afterwards dropped in most of them, but preserved in Sindhi. By that same law of accentuation which brought about the elision of this <strong>ओ</strong>, we have seen, that nouns ending in <strong>क</strong> or such othersyllable preceded by <strong>अ</strong>come to have <strong>आ-ओ</strong> and <strong>एं-आं-ऊं</strong> for their final. By an obvious inference, therefore, those other substantives and adjectives also must have got <strong>कः</strong>or <strong>कम्</strong> in the Prakrits and the Apabhraṁśa in the forms of <strong>ओ</strong> or <strong>अं</strong>and <strong>उ</strong>or <strong>उं</strong>, though in Sanskrit they do not possess them.</p>
<p>The suffix <strong>क</strong>, though actually found in certain words only in Sanskrit, must have been largely used in the spoken language of ancient times, since Pāṇini and his expositors allow of its being appended to all nouns and even verbs and participles, to indicate <a href="http://#" title="Pāṇini, V. 3. 85, 86; V. 4. 4.">littleness</a>, <a href="http://#" title="Pāṇini, V. 3. 74, 75,">contempt</a>, <a href="http://#" title="Pāṇini, V.3. 76, 77.">tenderness</a>, the state of being <a href="http://#" title="Pāṇini, V. 3. 73.">unknown</a>, resemblance or <a href="http://#" title="Pāṇini, V. 3. 96, 97.">copy</a>, and a <a href="http://#" title="Pāṇini, V. 3. 75, 87, 97.">species</a> founded on some of theseparticularities. Words formed by the addition of such a suffix in such senses cannot, of course, be much used in literary works. They are adapted for colloquial purposes, such as our Marathi Pāṇinifor Rama and Pāṇinifor Govinda are.</p>
<p>Accordingly, in the Prakrits and Apabhraṃśa, which were derived from the spoken languages, we find the practice of adding the suffix to be very common. Thus in the fourth act of the Vikramorvaśīwe have Pāṇinifor Pāṇiniformed from the analogy of Pāṇini but properly Pāṇini for Pāṇini</p>
<p>for <strong>युगलकम्</strong>; <strong>जुआणओ</strong> for <strong>युवकः</strong>; <strong>आणत्तओ</strong>for <strong>आज्ञप्तकः</strong>; <strong>परिमंथरओ</strong> for <strong>परिमन्थरकः</strong>; <strong>काननए</strong> for <strong>काननके</strong>; <strong>कुसुमुज्जलए</strong> for <strong>कुसुमोज्ज्वलके</strong>; <strong>लालसओ</strong>for <strong>लालसकः</strong>; <strong>परवारणओ</strong>for <strong>परवारणक</strong>;<strong>लीणओ</strong> for <strong>लीनक</strong>:; <strong>गइन्दओ</strong> for <strong>गजेन्द्रकः</strong>and many others. So also in Hemacandra&rsquo;s quotations from Apabhraṁśaworks, we have <strong>घडिअउ</strong>for <strong>घटितकः</strong>; <strong>विप्पिअयारउ</strong> for <strong>विप्रियकारकः</strong>; <strong>उड्डावन्तिअए</strong> for <strong>उद्रावयन्तिकया</strong>; <strong>दिट्टउ</strong> for <strong>दृष्टकः</strong>; <strong>वल्लहउं</strong>for <strong>बल्लभकम्</strong>;<strong>मुअउ</strong>for <strong>मृतकः</strong> &amp;c.</p>
<p>Now the question is, why is it that certain nouns only which have <strong>आ</strong>and <strong>ओ</strong>or <strong>आं</strong>,<strong>एं</strong>, and <strong>उं</strong> in our vernaculars had <strong>क</strong> appended to them in the Prakrits and not others? The suffix was used only where some additional sense was intended to be expressed. Hence there were some words to which it was not appended at all, and of those to which it was two forms existed, of which the one augmented had unaugmented sense. And in our modern dialects a good many words have these two forms, and of these that with <strong>आ</strong>conveys an additional sense, such as is attributed to <strong>क</strong> by the Sanskrit grammarians.</p>
<p>Thus <strong>दांत</strong> in Marathi expresses &amp; &rsquo;tooth&rsquo; but <strong>दांता</strong>a copy of the animal tooth, that is, &rsquo;the tooth’ of such an instrument as a saw; <strong>मेल</strong> signifies &lsquo;union&rsquo; &lsquo;agreement&rsquo;, but <strong>मेला</strong> expresses a certain union, viz., a concourse of people in a fair or on some festive occasion; <strong>कोंपर</strong> signifies t&rsquo;he elbow&rsquo;,but <strong>कोंपरा</strong>any corner, resembling that made by the elbow; <strong>दोर</strong>means &lsquo;a string’, generally, but <strong>दोरा</strong>a particular string, that is, &rsquo;thread&rsquo; used for sewing, <strong>पाट</strong>denotes generally &lsquo;a strip,&lsquo;and thence the piece of wood used for sitting on, but <strong>पाटा</strong>a slab of stone used for pounding spices; <strong>फांस</strong> signifies &lsquo;a noose’, generally, but <strong>फांसा</strong>a snare for birds or beasts, and also ’a catch,&rsquo; for fastening anything. In the Hindi, Panjabi and Gujarati <strong>बांस</strong>or <strong>वांस</strong>means a bamboo, as does <strong>बांसु</strong>in Sindhi; but in Marathi <strong>वांसा</strong>means &lsquo;a bambu used as a rafter&rsquo; and thence a rafter generally, &amp;c. In Marathi and Hindi <strong>गाभ</strong>signifies‘foetus&rsquo; or &lsquo;womb, but <strong>गाभा</strong> the internal spadix or fruit-receptacle of the plantain-tree or the core or heart of anything. The Panjabi <strong>गम्भ</strong> and <strong>गंब्भा</strong> also mean ‘the womb&rsquo; and the heart or core of anything respectively.</p>
<p>Thus then <strong>क</strong> was appended to a word in the Prakrits to denote some additional sense; and both the augmented and unaugmentedforms of it were in use; and these in some cases have descended to the vernaculars. But in the course of time, in consequence of the frequent use of the augmented forms, the things expressed by the unaugmented words came to be thought of with the addi. tional property, to denote which the <strong>क</strong> was in the first instance affixed. Hence the forms without <strong>क</strong>went out of use, gradually those with it lost the additional sense. It was not possible to preserve this sense except by a comparison with the signification of the unaugmented forms. But as these disappeared, the comparison was impossible. And in some cases the additional sense was so slight, that in the course of time it gradually dropped away, though the two forms of the word did exist. Thus wel have in &rsquo; Marathi <strong>चूर</strong> or <strong>चुरा</strong> &lsquo;fragments&rsquo;, <strong>घेर</strong> or <strong>घेरा</strong>&lsquo;circumference&rsquo;, <strong>खांद</strong> or <strong>खांदा</strong> &rsquo;the shoulder&rsquo;, <strong>जोड</strong> or <strong>जोडा</strong> &lsquo;a pair,&rsquo; <strong>भूस</strong> or <strong>भुसा</strong>&lsquo;chaff’, and others; but there is no preceptible difference in the sense of the two forms, though in the last three cases usage has restricted one of them to one state of things and the other to another. So also one of our dialects has the augmented form, and another the original, the sense being the same.Thus:—</p>
<p>[Table 39: Augmented and unaugmented forms of the same words]</p>
<p>B. <strong>बड</strong>, H. P. <strong>बडा</strong>large or great.</p>
<p>M. <strong>खेल</strong>, H. P. <strong>खेल</strong>, B. <strong>खेला</strong> a play.</p>
<p>H. <strong>दहीना</strong>, B. <strong>डाइन</strong>, O <strong>डाहाण</strong> right hand,</p>
<p>M. <strong>खांब</strong>, M. (dial.) <strong>खांबो,</strong> G. <strong>खंभ</strong>, H. P. <strong>खंभ</strong> or<strong>खंभा</strong>, B. <strong>खंबा</strong>, O, <strong>खंब</strong>apillar.</p>
<p>B. <strong>आम</strong>, H. <strong>आम</strong> or <strong>आम्ब</strong>, P. <strong>अंब</strong>, M. <strong>आंबा</strong>, G. <strong>आंबो</strong> the mango tree.</p>
<p>P. <strong>मच्छ</strong>, H. B. <strong>माछ</strong>, M. <strong>मासा</strong> a fish.</p>
<p>B.<strong>भाल</strong>, H. P. M. <strong>भला</strong>good.</p>
<p>It thus appears that originally the suffix was not necessarily applied to any nouns, but optionally to such as admitted of the additional signification.This additional signification has been preserved in some cases, but lost in others.</p>
<p><strong>THE ORIGINAL AND DERIVATIVE ACCENTS IN THE<br>
VERNACULARS.</strong></p>
<p>You will now have seen, that the Sanskrit and Prakrit final vowels having, for the most part, been dropped by the influence of the accent, the final <strong>आ, आं, ई, ईं, ऊ, ऊं, एं</strong>and <strong>ओ</strong>that we have</p>
<p>now got were originally penultimates or have arisen from a combination of the penultimate and final. The accent which originally fell on the penultimate falls now in consequence of this change on these new finals. Thus, these two accents, that on the penultimate when a word ends in the silent <strong>अ</strong>, and that on the new final, are now to be met with in the vernaculars. The first may be called the original accent, and the second derivative.</p>
<p>The Marathi is of all our dialects the most sensitive to them, and shortens all the other vowels of the word in order to throw the whole force of utterance on the accented syllable. The Sanskrit <strong>मूतक</strong> &lsquo;mourning&rsquo;, <strong>नूतन</strong> &rsquo;new&rsquo;, <strong>पीतल</strong>&lsquo;brass,&rsquo; and the Sanskrit and Prakrit <strong>जीवन्त</strong> (from <strong>जीवन्तः</strong> or <strong>जीवन्तो</strong>) are pronounced as <strong>सुत॑क्, नुत॑न्, पित॑ल्, जिव॑न्त्</strong>, &amp;c, with the penultimate <strong>अ</strong> long and the first vowel short. In this way, in a word composed of three syllables. with the final <strong>अ</strong> silent, the first syllable must be short in Marathi. When a word is composed of more than three syllables, the of the antepenultimate is elided, as in, <strong>अडचण, शहाणपण</strong>, pronounced <strong>अड्रच॑ण्शहाण्पण्</strong>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Similarly, when a word ends in the accented and the other vowels, the preceding vowels are shortened as in the following:—</p>
<p>[Table 40: Accent shortening preceding vowels ].</p>
<p>** किडा**, Skr.<strong>कीटकः</strong>, Pr.<strong>कीडओ</strong>, and the others in Table 6.</p>
<p>Also <strong>चुरा</strong> and <strong>भुसा</strong> which without the <strong>आ</strong> are <strong>चूर</strong> and <strong>भूस</strong> (See p. 422), <strong>विडी, जुई</strong>and such others occurring in Table 35.</p>
<p><strong>पिडी</strong> a step in the scale of descent, a generation, Skr. <strong>पीठिका</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>जुवा</strong> gambling by means of dice, Skr.<strong>द्यूतकः</strong>(by a change of gender).</p>
<p><strong>निला-लें-ली</strong>blue, Skr. <strong>नीलकः-कं-०लिका</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>पिवला-लें-ली</strong> yellow, Skr. <strong>पतिलकः-कं-०लेका</strong>.</p>
<p>When, together with the accented final, a word is composed of three or more syllables, or, more generally, when the accented syllable is preceded by two others or more, the <strong>अ</strong>of that which Immediately precedes is silent or elided, as in the case of <strong>अड्चण</strong> or above, and any other vowel in its place is shortened and sometimes dropped: The other vowels are also pronounced short. Thus —</p>
<p>[Table 41: Elision of अ through Accent.]</p>
<p><strong>शीक</strong> <em>imper. 2nd</em>    <strong>शिकणें</strong>   <em>inf</em>. to learn,<br>
pronounced as<br>
per. sing.the origina।<br>
form of the root.                      <br>
<strong>शिकणें.</strong></p>
<p><strong>पूस</strong>             <strong>पुसणें</strong>    <em>inf.</em> &rsquo;to ask’
<strong>पुस्णें</strong>.             <br>
<strong>रूस</strong>             <strong>रूसतो</strong>   <em>pres. part.</em>&lsquo;he is</p>
<pre><code>                     angry'       
</code></pre>
<p><strong>रूस्तो</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>शीव</strong>            <strong>शिवला</strong>  <em>past part.</em>‘touched’ <strong>शिङ्ला</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>शीव</strong> has similarly  <strong>शिवणे</strong>‘to sew’ <em>inf.</em> <strong>शिङ्तो</strong> &lsquo;he sews,’ <strong>शिवला</strong> ‘sewn.’</p>
<p><strong>कर</strong> &lsquo;do,&rsquo; *pres. part.*unaugmented <strong>करीत</strong>, sugmented <strong>करितो</strong> or <strong>करतो</strong> pronounced as <strong>कर् तो</strong></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>So also <strong>अङ्गुष्ठकः</strong> is <strong>आंग्ठा</strong>, and <strong>श्वशुरकः,</strong> <strong>साम्रा</strong> the penultimate <strong>उ</strong> being dropped.</p>
<p>When the final is unaccented, it is the penultimate that is emphasized, but when it is accented, the penultimate is slurred over. Thus the accentuation of the penultimate leads to the elision of the final vowel, and the accentuation of the final brings about an elision or shortening of the penultimate.</p>
<p><strong>ACCENT IN HINDI</strong></p>
<p>In Hindi also the accent leads to the elision of the <strong>अ</strong>of the previous syllable when more than one precede the accented syllable. Thus <strong>उबटन</strong>‘a cosmetic’ is pronounced is pronounced as <strong>उबटन</strong>, <strong>सूरखपन</strong>as<strong>मूरख्पन</strong> as<strong>मूरखपन</strong> as <strong>मूरख्प॑न, उबटना</strong><em>inf.</em> &rsquo;to rub the body with a cosmetic’, as <strong>उबट्ना करना</strong>as <strong>कर् ना</strong>. The Braj present participle <strong>करत</strong> is pronounced as <strong>कर॑त्</strong> since one syllable only precedes the accented penultimate; but the Hindi <strong>करता</strong>is <strong>कर् ता</strong>as two syllables precede the accented <strong>ता</strong>. The accent leads to the shortening of the preceding vowels in some cases. Thus <strong>गोपाल</strong> &lsquo;cowherd,&rsquo; and <strong>पाताल</strong> &rsquo;the lower regions,’ are sometimes pronounced and written as <strong>गुपाल</strong> and <strong>पताल</strong>;so does <strong>आसिष्</strong>become <strong>आसीस</strong>. In such words as <strong>उपज</strong>&lsquo;produce,’ <strong>उसास</strong>&lsquo;respiration,’ and <strong>उबटन</strong> ‘a cosmetic’, from the Pr. <strong>उप्पज्ज, उस्सास,</strong> and <strong>उब्बट्टण</strong>, Skr. <strong>उत्पद्य</strong>, <strong>उच्छ्वास</strong>, and <strong>उद्वर्तन</strong>, it prevents the lengthening of the initial <strong>उ</strong>, as by the general rule it should be long, since one member of the following double consonant is dropped. The</p>
<p>derived socent also shortens the preceding vowels in such instances as the following :—</p>
<p>[Table 42: Accent in Hindi shortening preceding vowels].</p>
<p>H. <strong>दहिना</strong> southern, Pr. <strong>दाहिणओ</strong>, Skr. <strong>दक्षिणकः</strong>.</p>
<p>H. <strong>दिया</strong> alamp, Pr. <strong>दीवओ</strong>, Skr. <strong>दीपकः</strong> .</p>
<p>H. <strong>जुआ</strong> gambling, Pr.<strong>जूअओ</strong>.Skr. <strong>द्यूतकः</strong> (by a change of gender).</p>
<p>H. <strong>अगला</strong>foremost, the first part of which is <strong>आग</strong>, from Pr. <strong>अग्ग</strong>. Skr. <strong>अग्र</strong>.</p>
<p>H. <strong>अपना</strong> one&rsquo;s own,&hellip;&hellip;.. <strong>आप</strong> from Pr. <strong>अप्प</strong>, Skr <strong>आत्म</strong>.<br>
इ<strong>कठ्ठा</strong> together,&hellip;……<strong>एक</strong>.</p>
<p>H. <strong>फिरा</strong>walked, <strong>पिया</strong>drunk, <strong>सिया</strong>sewn, <strong>छुआ</strong>touched, past participlesof <strong>फीरना, पीना, सीना      छूना</strong>, &amp;c. ८०.</p>
<p>In the same way it prevents the lengthening of a preceding vowel in such cases as <strong>उपजना</strong>&rsquo;to be produced,&rsquo; <strong>उठना</strong>&rsquo;to rise,’<strong>उडना</strong> &rsquo;to fly, &rsquo;the last two being derived from the Prakrit <strong>उत्थाण</strong> and <strong>उड्डयन</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>EXCEPTIONS TO THE ABOVE.</strong></p>
<p>But in a great many cases the accent does not affect the preceding close vowels. The Sanskrit words <strong>सूतक, पीतल,</strong> &amp;c., the first syllable of which is shortened in Marathi, retain it long in the Hindi. The words <strong>उपज,उपजना, उसास,</strong> and othershave their initial vowel optionally lengthened, and in a few cases, such as <strong>ऊपर</strong> and <strong>ऊखल</strong>, it is lengthened without any apparent reason. Similarly, the Hindi forms of <strong>कीटक</strong>and the other words in Table 6 retain the long vowel. It has also <strong>बीडी, जूही</strong>and <strong>सूजी</strong> as in Table 35, and <strong>नीला</strong>&lsquo;blue&rsquo;, <strong>पीला</strong>‘yellow’, <strong>सी</strong>खा, learnt&rsquo;, <strong>मीठा</strong>&lsquo;sweet&rsquo;, <strong>पूछा</strong>&lsquo;asked&rsquo;, <strong>मूआ</strong> &lsquo;dead&rsquo;, <strong>सीखना</strong>&rsquo;to learn, <strong>पूछना</strong>‘to ask&rsquo;, <strong>दूसरा</strong> &amp;c., while in all these cases the Marathi has short <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong>. Perhaps, this weakening of the accent as regards previous <strong>ई</strong> and <strong>ऊ</strong> is due to the development of another accentin Hindi on the initial syllable. To such an accent as this might be attributed the almost universal change of <strong>अय</strong>and <strong>अव</strong> to <strong>ऐ</strong> and <strong>औ</strong>that we have already noticed. The <strong>अ</strong>of the initial syllable, being accented, draws to itself the <strong>य</strong>or <strong>व</strong>of the following and</p>
<p>deprives it of its <strong>अ</strong>, in which cases the <strong>य</strong>or <strong>व</strong> becomes <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>उ</strong>, and then the two form <strong>ऐ</strong> and <strong>औ</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>THE ACCENT IN GUJARATI</strong></p>
<p>The Gujarati follows the Hindi completely, sometimes shortening the preceding vowels as in <strong>कुवो, सुवो</strong>, and <strong>कुमलो</strong> &lsquo;delicate&rsquo;, &rsquo;tender&rsquo;, and dropping it as in <strong>सस्रो</strong> &lsquo;father-in-law&rsquo;, (Skr.<strong>श्वशुरकः</strong>) and<strong>आङ्गुली</strong> &lsquo;finger&rsquo; (Skr. <strong>अङ्गुलिका</strong>), sometimes preventing their being lengthened, as in <strong>उपज, उठघुं</strong>, &amp;c., and very often preserving them long as in <strong>पूरो</strong> &lsquo;full&rsquo;, <strong>शीक्वुं, शीक्यो</strong>, &amp;c.</p>
<p><strong>THE ACCENT IN PANJABI</strong></p>
<p>The Panjabi also keeps the short vowel in such cases as <strong>उचार</strong> &lsquo;utterance&rsquo;, <strong>उजाला</strong> &rsquo;light&rsquo;, though a member of a double is droppedand preserves the long in such casesas <strong>दीया</strong> or <strong>दीवा</strong>, <strong>जुआ, कीडा, पूरा, पूरी</strong> ‘a cake&rsquo;, &amp;c. It has even fewer instances of shortening than the Hindi.</p>
<p><strong>THE ACCENT IN SINDHI</strong></p>
<p>The Sindhi has <strong>जुआ</strong>&lsquo;gambling&rsquo;, <strong>डिओ</strong>&lsquo;a lamp,&rsquo; <strong>पितल</strong>&amp;c., but has such words as <strong>मूतक</strong>, &lsquo;mourning&rsquo;, <strong>कीडो</strong> &lsquo;a worm&rsquo;, <strong>वीडो</strong> &lsquo;a roll of betel leaves, (Skr. <strong>वीटकः</strong>), <strong>पीतो</strong>&lsquo;drunk&rsquo;, &amp;c. In a great many words such as <strong>सुको</strong>&lsquo;dried&rsquo;, <strong>वुधो</strong>&lsquo;heard&rsquo;, <strong>छुतो</strong>&rsquo;touched&rsquo;, <strong>दुधो</strong>&lsquo;milked&rsquo;, the vowel of the preceding syllable is short; but that is due not to the accent on the last syllable but to the peculiarity of the Sindhi not to lengthen the preceding vowels even when a member of a double is dropped.</p>
<p><strong>THE ACCENT IN BENGALI AND ORIYA</strong></p>
<p>The Bengali is more like the Marathi in this respect than the Hindi. Thus we have <strong>भितर</strong>, H. <strong>भीतर</strong> &lsquo;in the interior’, <strong>शुका</strong> dry, H. <strong>भूका; भिजा</strong> or <strong>भिगा</strong> &lsquo;wet’, H. <strong>भीजा</strong> or <strong>भीगा; किडा</strong> &lsquo;a worm&rsquo;, H.<strong>कीडा; जुता</strong> &lsquo;shoes&rsquo;, H.<strong>जूता; खिला</strong>&lsquo;a nail&rsquo;, H. <strong>कीला, उपजन</strong> &rsquo;to be produced, &amp;c. It thus shortens <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong> in the unaccented syllables like the Marathi.</p>
<p>The Oriya follows the Bengali, having <strong>जुडा</strong>, Skr. <strong>जूटक</strong>&lsquo;a knot of hair’, <strong>जुता</strong>&lsquo;shoes&rsquo;, <strong>भिजा</strong>&lsquo;wet&rsquo;, <strong>भितर</strong> &lsquo;in the interior&rsquo;, &amp;c. All these languages, however, treat the unaccented <strong>अ</strong> in words of three or more syllables as the Marathi and Hindi do.</p>
<p><strong>THE ACCENT ON VERNACULAR TERMINATIONS</strong></p>
<p>In Marathi the termination of the oblique form of cases and that of the plural of neuter nouns in <strong>ए</strong> are also accented. The reasonwhy they bear the accent will be considered hereafter. The accent on the causal termination, in consequence of which the preceding vowels are shortened in the Hindi and the Gujarati, has already been mentioned. This also seems to be the same accent that we have been considering. Thus in G. <strong>शिवडाव</strong>&lsquo;make him sew, or <strong>धोवडाव</strong> &lsquo;make him wash&rsquo;, the <strong>आ</strong>being penultimate bears the accent and the final <strong>अ</strong>is dropped. Similarly in <strong>धोवडाववुं</strong>by the general rule, the final vowel being accented the penultimate <strong>अ</strong> is silent. It is because it is so, and the <strong>ववुं</strong>forms the conjunct<strong>व्वुं</strong>, that the <strong>आ</strong>looks as if emphasized just as the first <strong>अ</strong>of <strong>अड्चण</strong> and <strong>कर् ता</strong> is. In the Marathi and other dialectsalso, there is this accent in the case of the causal, and the preceding <strong>ई</strong> and <strong>ऊ</strong> are shortened; as in <strong>निज्॑व्</strong> &lsquo;make him sleep&rsquo;, <strong>निजव्णें</strong>&rsquo;to make one sleep&rsquo;, from the original <strong>नीज</strong> &lsquo;sleep&rsquo;, in <strong>करीव्</strong>cause him to do <strong>करिव्णें</strong>or<strong>करव्णें</strong> ’to cause one to do&rsquo;, &amp;c. In the standard Hindi the <strong>व</strong> is dropped, but still the way of pronunciation remains the same as it was when it existed. In <strong>दिखाना</strong>&rsquo;to show,&lsquo;for instance, the <strong>खा</strong> is pronounced as it would have been if the word had been <strong>दिखावना</strong>. And the forms with <strong>व</strong> exist in the Braj.</p>
<p><strong>ACCENT IN VERNACULAR COMPOUNDS</strong></p>
<p>Compounds in the vernaculars, most of which belong to the Tatpuruṣa, Karmadhāraya, or Dvandva class have an accent on the penultimate or final of the last word, as in the H. <strong>पन् सा॑ल</strong> &lsquo;a place where water is provided for passengers&rsquo;, in which the first word<strong>पानी</strong>becomes <strong>पन्</strong>, <strong>अमरा॑ई</strong>a forest of mango-trees&rsquo;, in which the <strong>आ</strong>of <strong>आम</strong>is shortened, <strong>घुडसा॑ल</strong> &lsquo;a stable&rsquo;, in which we have <strong>घुड</strong>for <strong>घोडा, रन् वास</strong> &lsquo;harem&rsquo;, the <strong>रन्</strong> of which is a shortened form of रानी, and in the G. <strong>अधमुई</strong>&lsquo;half dead’, and the M. <strong>अधम॑ण</strong>’half a maund’.In the Marathi <strong>आम्ररा॑इ,</strong> <strong>रानमाणू॑स,कालमांज॑र</strong>, the <strong>आ</strong> of the first syllable is short though not changed to <strong>अ</strong>; and in <strong>तिर्कांबटे</strong>&lsquo;an arrow and bow&rsquo;, the first word is <strong>तीर्</strong>with the <strong>ई</strong> shortened.</p>
<p>An unaccented initial vowel is dropped in the following instances:—</p>
<p>[Table 43: unaccented initial vowels dropped in vernaculars]</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>उपविश</strong> sit, Pr. <strong>उवइस</strong>, M. H. B. O. <strong>बैस</strong>, G. <strong>बेस</strong>, S.<strong>बिह</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>उपविष्टकः</strong> sat, Pr. <strong>उवइट्टओ</strong>, H. P. <strong>बैठा</strong>, G. <strong>बैठो</strong>, S, <strong>बीठो</strong>,</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>अभ्यन्तर</strong>inside, H. <strong>भीतर</strong>, B. M. (dial.) <strong>भितर</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr.<strong>अरघट्ट</strong>, a water-wheel, Pr.<strong>अरहट्ट</strong>?, H.<strong>रहट</strong>, M.<strong>रहाट</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>अभ्यञ्जनकम्</strong> to soak, M. <strong>भिजणें</strong>, H. <strong>भीजना</strong>, G. <strong>भिजवुं</strong>, B, <strong>भिजिवा</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr.<strong>एकस्थकम्</strong>in one place, Pr.<strong>एकट्ठअं</strong>, H. P. <strong>कट्ठा</strong>, or <strong>इकट्ठा</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>उपरि .</strong> above, Pr. <strong>उवरि</strong>, M. <strong>वर</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr.<strong>उत्सृष्टकः</strong>left, Pr. <strong>उज्छुट्ठओ</strong>, H. <strong>जूठा</strong> &lsquo;what is left after eating&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>उपाध्याय</strong> a preceptor, M. <strong>पाध्या</strong>, P. <strong>पाधे</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr.<strong>उदूढकः</strong>, Pr. <strong>उदूढओ</strong> abridegroom, H. P. <strong>दूल्हा</strong>.</p>
<p>Of the two instances of this change in the Prakrits <strong>लावू</strong> a &lsquo;pumpkin&rsquo; exists in Hindi, and <strong>रण्ण</strong>in the form of <strong>रान</strong> in M. and P. and of <strong>रन</strong> in H. Medial <strong>ऐ</strong> is dropped in Marathi, Bengall, and Oriya in the word <strong>बैस</strong>, and others enumerated before. It is dropped in the G. <strong>माशी</strong>for H. <strong>मौसी</strong>(see p. 391). This elision does not appear to be due to accent since according to our theory it must fall on the <strong>ऐ</strong>in some at least of the cases. The change is due to the process of softening, sitice what takes place here is the simple dropping away of the close element of the diphthong.</p>
<p><strong>THE AVOIDING OF THE HIATUS IN THE VERNACULARS</strong></p>
<p>We will now briefly notice the manner in which the hiatus caused by two vowels coming together in consequence of the olision of uninitial consonants in the Prakrits is avoided. We have seen that <strong>अ</strong>and <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>अ</strong>and <strong>उ</strong> are combined into <strong>ऐ</strong> and <strong>औ</strong>in some of the dialects, and into <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong>in <a href="http://#" title="Pp. 400-406.">others</a>. Final unacdented <strong>अ</strong>and <strong>आ</strong>are dropped when preceded by <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>उ</strong> as in the words given in Table No. 35, and unaccented <strong>उ</strong> preceded by <strong>अ</strong>is dropped in some of the vernaculars, as in Table No. 36, and combined into <strong>ओ</strong>or <strong>उ</strong> in <a href="http://#" title="See P. 418.">others</a>. Final <strong>इ</strong> is preserved or changed to <strong>य</strong>after <strong>अ</strong>in some cases, and combined with it to form <strong>ई</strong><a href="http://#" title="P. 419.">others</a>.</p>
<p>Final accented आand <strong>उ</strong> or <strong>ऊ</strong> are preserved and a hiatus is tolerated; as in H. P. <strong>जुआ</strong>or <strong>जूआ</strong>for <strong>द्यूतक</strong>, and S. P. <strong>पिउ, माउ</strong>, and theM. <strong>भाऊ</strong>for <strong>पितृक, मातृका, भ्रातृक</strong>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Sometimes <strong>ए</strong> or <strong>व्</strong> is inserted in such cases after <strong>इ</strong>and <strong>उ</strong>, as In H. <strong>दिया</strong> for <strong>दिआ</strong>‘alamp&rsquo; and M. <strong>जुवा</strong>, H. <strong>जूवा</strong> for <strong>द्यूतक</strong>.</p>
<p>The syllable <strong>अय</strong> aru, formed in the Prakrits by interposing a <strong>ए</strong> between <strong>अ</strong> and <strong>अ</strong>, Is changed to <strong>ऐ</strong> in modern Hindi as in the words in Table No.16 and to <strong>ए</strong>in the Gujarati and the Sindhi. This latter was the older process; and hence even in the Prakrits we have <strong>केल</strong> for <strong>कयल</strong>, Skr, <strong>कदल</strong>, and <strong>तेरह, तेवीसा</strong>, <strong>तेत्तीसा</strong> for <strong>त्रयोदश, त्रयोविंशति, त्रयस्त्रिंशत्</strong> &amp;c. And in Hindi alsowe haveए in <strong>बेर</strong>‘a plum&rsquo; from <strong>बयर</strong>for Skr. <strong>बदर</strong>, which must have existed in the Prakrits, though the form given by the Grammarians is <strong>बोर</strong> for <strong>बवर</strong>.</p>
<p>Though the Marathi does not, like the Hindi or Gujarati, nowchange <strong>अय</strong> to <strong>ऐ</strong> or <strong>ए</strong>, still as formerly observed, when in a state of formation, it did form <strong>ए</strong>out of it, as in the instances there given, and in the neuter singular termination <strong><a href="http://#" title=" P. 403.">एं</a></strong>. The termination <strong>नेर</strong> occurring at the end of the names of Gujarati and Marathi towns such as <strong>चांपानेर, बडनेर, संगमनेर, पिंपलनेर,</strong> &amp;c, is derived from Pr. <strong>नयर</strong>for Skr. <strong>नगर</strong>&rsquo;town’. The syllables <strong>अया</strong>, arising <strong>अ</strong> from <strong>आ</strong>, are also sometimes changed to <strong>ए</strong> as in H. <strong>अंधेर</strong> or <strong>अंधेरा</strong>, M.<strong>अंधेर</strong>, Pr.<strong>अंधयार</strong>, Skr. <strong>अन्धका</strong>र.After <strong>आ</strong>, the <strong>य</strong> is sometimes changed to <strong>ऐ</strong>and <strong>ए</strong> in the Hindi and Gujarati as in the instances in Tables No.18 and 20, and also in the Marathi in the instance <strong>शेली</strong> from Pr. <strong>छाअलिआ</strong>, Skr. <strong>छागलिका</strong>; but often <strong>आय</strong>and <strong>अया</strong>remain unchanged as in :—</p>
<p>[Table 44: ए inserted to avoid Hiatus]</p>
<p>H. G. <strong>कायर</strong> timid, Pr. <strong>कायर</strong>, Skr. <strong>कातर</strong>.</p>
<p>H. G. M. <strong>घाय</strong> wound or blow, Pr. <strong>घाअ</strong> or <strong>घात</strong>.Skr. <strong>घात</strong>.</p>
<p>H. बाय wind, Pr. <strong>बाअ</strong>, or <strong>वाय</strong>, Skr <strong>वात</strong>.</p>
<p>M. <strong>पाय</strong> the foot, Pr. <strong>पाअ</strong> or <strong>पाय</strong>, Skr. <strong>पाद.</strong></p>
<p>M. H. G. <strong>राय</strong> a king, Pr. <strong>राआ</strong>or <strong>राया,</strong>.Skr. राजा.</p>
<p>H. <strong>गया</strong> gone, G <strong>गयो</strong>, Pr. <strong>गअओ</strong>, or <strong>गयओ</strong>, Skr. <strong>गतकः</strong>.</p>
<p>G. <strong>शियालो</strong>the cold sesson, S. <strong>शियारो</strong>, Pr. <strong>शीअआ (या)लओ</strong>, Skr. <strong>शीतकालकः</strong>.</p>
<p>Sometimes the interposed <strong>य्</strong>is so light that it is dropped and the vowels <strong>अ</strong>and <strong>आ</strong>, or <strong>आ</strong>and <strong>अ</strong>, and in rare cases, <strong>अ</strong>and <strong>अ</strong>, combine and form <strong>आ</strong> as in:—</p>
<p>[Table 45 A: The interposed य्dropped]</p>
<p>B. <strong>पा</strong>, and B. G. <strong>घा</strong>for<strong>पाय</strong> and <strong>घाय</strong> in the above.</p>
<p>M. <strong>आ</strong> of <strong>आला</strong>, Pr. <strong>आअअ</strong>, Skr, <strong>आगत</strong>.</p>
<p>M. <strong>कुंभार</strong> a potter, Pr.<strong>कुंम्भआर</strong>, Skr. <strong>कुंम्भकार</strong>, and generally, the termination <strong>कार</strong>as in <strong>सुवर्णकार</strong> &lsquo;a goldsmith&rsquo; and others, also M. <strong>अंधार</strong> for <strong>अंधकार</strong>.</p>
<p>M. <strong>आर</strong> a Boa constrictor, Pr. <strong>अअअर</strong>, Skr. <strong>अजगर</strong>.</p>
<p>G. <strong>वानुं</strong> a promise, Pr. <strong>वअणअं</strong>, Skr. <strong>वचनकम्</strong>.</p>
<p>H. <strong>बरात</strong>, M. <strong>वरात</strong> a bridal procession, Skr. <strong>वरयात्रा</strong>.</p>
<p>In some cases <strong>व्</strong>is inserted instead of <strong>य्</strong> to prevent the hiatus, as in:—</p>
<p>M. <strong>राव</strong>for <strong>राअ</strong> &lsquo;a king&rsquo;.</p>
<p>H. <strong>पाव</strong>for <strong>पाअ</strong>&rsquo;the foot&rsquo;.</p>
<p>M. <strong>साव</strong>in <strong>सावली</strong> for <strong>छाअ</strong> in <strong>छाया</strong>; <strong>कावरा</strong> for Pr. <strong>काअरअ</strong>, Skr. <strong>कातरक;</strong> <strong>काव</strong>in <strong>कावला</strong> for Pr. <strong>काअ</strong>from Skr. <strong>काक</strong> and a few others.</p>
<p>In the principal Prakrit also we find <strong>पीवलअ</strong>for Skr.<strong>पीतलकम्</strong>&lsquo;yellow&rsquo;, from which we have the Marathi <strong>पिवलें</strong>, and <strong>बोर</strong> has been mentioned above.</p>
<p>A medial <strong>अ</strong> is dropped after <strong>इ, ए</strong> or <strong>उ</strong> a short or long, as in:—</p>
<p>[Table 45 C: Medial अ dropped after, इ, ए or उ]</p>
<p>M. <strong>दीर</strong> for Pr. <strong>दिअर</strong>&lsquo;husband&rsquo;s brother&rsquo;.</p>
<p>G. <strong>पीलुं</strong>, H. <strong>पीला</strong> &lsquo;yellow&rsquo; for Pr. पीअलअं, Skr. पीतलकम्.</p>
<p>M. शिलें‘stale’, H. <strong>सीला</strong> &lsquo;damp&rsquo;, &lsquo;cool&rsquo;, &lsquo;Pr. <strong>सीअलअं</strong>, Skr.<strong>शीतलकम्</strong>.</p>
<p>M. <strong>वेण</strong>a throe,&rsquo; Pr.<strong>वेअणा</strong>, Skr.<strong>वेदना</strong>; M.<strong>जूल</strong>or <strong>जूलें</strong> &rsquo;twins’, Pr. <strong>जुअलं</strong> or <strong>जुअलअं</strong>, Skr. <strong>युगलम्</strong> or <strong>युगलकम्</strong>. Sometimes with the previous <strong>इ</strong>, it forms <strong>ए</strong>; that is, a vowel, partaking of the character of both, is substituted for them; as in:—</p>
<p>[Table 45 D: medial अchanged to ए]</p>
<p>S.<strong>नेलु</strong>&lsquo;a fetter, Pr.<strong>निअडो</strong>,Skr.<strong>निगडः</strong>.</p>
<p>H. P. <strong>नेडे</strong>or <strong>नेरे</strong> ‘near’, Pr. <strong>निअडे</strong>, Skr. <strong>निकटे</strong>.</p>
<p>M. <strong>शेंडी</strong>&rsquo;the tuft of hair on the head&rsquo;, Pr. <strong>शिहण्डिआ</strong>, Skr.<strong>शिखण्डिका</strong>, the <strong>ह</strong>being softened     to<strong>अ</strong>.</p>
<p>H.<strong>बेना</strong> &lsquo;a fan,&rsquo; Pr. <strong>विअणअ</strong>, Skr. <strong>व्यजनक</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>नेडे</strong> has the form <strong>नीडे</strong>also, in which case <strong>अ</strong>is simply dropped and the vowel rendered long as in the M.<strong>दीर</strong>.</p>
<p>The long <strong>आ</strong>is preserved and changes the preceding <strong>इ</strong> to <strong>इय</strong> or <strong>य</strong>as in the H. <strong>सियार</strong> or <strong>स्या</strong>र &lsquo;jackal&rsquo; for Pr. <strong>सिआल</strong>, Skr. <strong>सुगाल</strong>; <strong>याह</strong> &lsquo;marriage,’ for Pr.<strong>विआह</strong>, Skr.<strong>विवाह</strong>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>CONSONANTAL CHANGES IN THE VERNACULARS.</p>
<p>We will now proceed to the consideration of consonantal changes; and first of those due to the process of softening. The semivowel <strong>य्</strong> is often softened to <strong>इ</strong>. In the Prakrits, <strong>व्यजन</strong>‘a fan&rsquo; becomes <strong>विअण</strong> which is preserved in the H. <strong>बेना</strong> and <strong>स्त्यान</strong> is changed to for <strong>थीण</strong>. This word does not occur in the vernaculars, butthe Hindi and Marathi have got <strong>थिजता</strong>and <strong>थिजणें</strong> ‘to congeal&rsquo; from the verb <strong>स्त्यायते</strong>, in which <strong>या</strong>is softenedto<strong>इ</strong>. From <strong>व्यजन</strong>, or rather such a word as <strong>व्यंजन</strong>, we have by a similar softening M. <strong>विंजणा</strong>, H.<strong>विंजना</strong>, G.<strong>विजणो</strong>, S, <strong>विञिणु</strong>. More modern instances are:-</p>
<p>[Table 46 Pra. य् changed to Verna. इ]</p>
<p>H. P. <strong>सिलाई</strong>, P.<strong>सलाई</strong>, Pr.<strong>सलाया</strong>, M.<strong>सलई</strong>a pencil, probe, Skr. <strong>शलाका</strong>.</p>
<p>B. <strong>शेल</strong>a dart, Skr.<strong>शल्य</strong>; the <strong>य</strong>, being changed to <strong>इ</strong>, is transferred to the preceding syllable.</p>
<p>H. P. <strong>जनेत</strong> a bridal procession, Skr. <strong>जन्ययात्रा</strong>.</p>
<p>H. <strong>झाईं</strong> shadow, P. <strong>छाईया</strong>, Skr. <strong>छाया</strong>.</p>
<p>H. P. <strong>बितीत</strong> passed, Skr, <strong>व्यतीत</strong>.</p>
<p>H.P. <strong>बिथा</strong>pain, Skr.<strong>व्यथा</strong>; <strong>विवहार</strong>business, performance, Skr.<strong>व्यवहार</strong>.</p>
<p>H. P. <strong>कलिआण</strong> welfare, Skr. <strong>कल्याण, बिदिआ</strong> learning, Skr.<strong>विद्या</strong>,</p>
<p>P.<strong>पतीज</strong> faith, belief, Skr.<strong>प्रत्यय.</strong></p>
<p>H.<strong>पर्तिछ</strong>visible, Skr.<strong>प्रत्यक्ष</strong>.</p>
<p>The Panjabi always dissolves a Sanskrit <strong>य</strong> contained in a conjunct into <strong>इ + अ</strong>, or sometimes into <strong>इ</strong> simply, while the Hindi often resorts to the latter change. The other languages do not seem to possess many instances of this process. The change of <strong>अय</strong>or <strong>अया</strong>to <strong>ए</strong>, formerly noticed, is also due to this softening process.</p>
<p>In the Prakrits, <strong>व्</strong> is dissolved into <strong>उ</strong> in<strong>झुणी</strong> for Skr <strong>ध्वनि, सुवइ</strong>, for <strong>स्वपिति, दु</strong> for <strong>द्वि, तुवर</strong> for <strong>त्वर</strong>, &amp;c. In Hindi we have <strong>झुन</strong> in the sense of &lsquo;a slight resemblance,&rsquo; a remote <em>sound</em> of the property possessedby another. But another derivative from the word exists in the form <strong>धुन</strong>or <strong>धून</strong>in that language, and of <strong>धून</strong> or <strong>धुनक</strong> in Marathi. From <strong>सुव</strong> H. has <strong>सो</strong> ‘to sleep,’ P. <strong>सौ</strong>, G.<strong>सुव</strong>, and B. and O.<strong>शु</strong> or <strong>शुइ</strong>. <strong>दु</strong> occurs in the forms of <strong>दो</strong>or <strong>दु</strong> when the word stands alone or is compounded, as in H.<strong>दूना</strong>, B.<strong>दुना</strong>, M.<strong>दुणा</strong>, &amp;c., for Pr.<strong>दुअण</strong>, Skr. <strong>द्विगुण</strong>‘two-fold,&rsquo; and <strong>तुवर</strong>by a further dissolution becomes the P. <strong>तुरना</strong>to go,&rsquo; H. P. <strong>तुरंत</strong>, G.<strong>तरत</strong>&lsquo;instantly, pr. part., M. <strong>तूर्त</strong>‘at present’.</p>
<p>More modern instances are:—</p>
<p>[Table 47: व् changed to उor ओ]</p>
<p>H. P. <strong>परोस</strong> to serve food, Skr.<strong>परिवेष</strong>.</p>
<p>H. P.M <strong>पडोसी</strong> a neighbour, <strong>प्रतिवेशी</strong>.</p>
<p>H.<strong>अंगोछा</strong>a towel, <strong>अङ्गवस्त्र</strong>.</p>
<p>H. P. <strong>पतोहू</strong> son&rsquo;s wife, Pr <strong>पुत्तवहू</strong>, Skr. <strong>पुत्रवधू</strong>.</p>
<p>H. P. <strong>जनेऊ</strong>, Pr. <strong>जण्णोवीअ</strong>, Skr. <strong>यज्ञोपवीत</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>व</strong> and <strong>वं</strong> to which <strong>प</strong> and<strong>म</strong> are softened aresimilarly changed to <strong>उ</strong> or <strong>ओ</strong>.</p>
<p>H. P. <strong>बहनोई</strong> sister’shusband, Pr. <strong>बहिनीवई</strong>, Skr, <strong>भगिनीपति</strong>.</p>
<p>H. P. <strong>भादो</strong> name of a month, Pr.<strong>भद्दवअ</strong>Skr, <strong>भाद्रपद</strong>.</p>
<p>H. P. G. <strong>खो-[ना-णा-वुं]</strong> to lose, Pr. <strong>खव</strong>, Skr.<strong>क्षप</strong>.</p>
<p>H. P. B. <strong>छू</strong> to touch, Pr. <strong>छिव</strong>, or <strong>छुव</strong>, Skr. <strong>छुप</strong>.</p>
<p>H. <strong>अनोखा</strong> unexpected, Pr. <strong>अणवेक्ख-[अ]</strong>, Skr. <strong>अनपेक्ष-[क]</strong>.</p>
<p>H. <strong>नोता</strong>, P. <strong>नेउंदा</strong>, G. <strong>नोतरुं</strong>, invitation, A.P. <strong>निवंत्त-[उ]</strong> or **निवंत्र-[उ]**Skr.<strong>निमन्त्र-[कः]</strong>, H, has
<strong>नेवता</strong>also.</p>
<p>H. <strong>पुन्यों</strong> the full-moon day, Ap. <strong>पुण्णिवां</strong>, Skr. <strong>पूर्णिमा</strong>.</p>
<p>H. <strong>सोंह</strong> (of <strong>सोंहीं</strong>) face to face, Ap. <strong>संवुंह</strong>, Skr. <strong>संमुख</strong>.</p>
<p>M. <strong>सोंप</strong> to entrust, Ap.<strong>सवंप्प</strong>, Skr. <strong>समर्प</strong>.</p>
<p>It will be seen that the <strong>ओ</strong>or <strong>उ</strong> to which <strong>व्</strong> is softened often prevails over the preceding and following vowels, as in the words<strong>परोस</strong> and <strong>पडोशी</strong>.</p>
<p>The change of <strong>अव</strong>to <strong>औ</strong>, formerly noticed, I consider as due to the elision of the final <strong>अ</strong>of <strong>व</strong>, consequent upon an accent on the first syllable, though afterwards there is a softening of the <strong>व्</strong> to <strong>उ</strong>. But in the above instances the change of <strong>व्</strong>to <strong>ओ</strong>or <strong>उ</strong> is due to a weak pronunciation or softening alone. The diphthong <strong>ओ</strong>requires, as I have several times observed, a passage from one vocal position immediately to another which involves energetic utterance. The Pali, Prakrit, Gujarati, and Sindhi substitute for it, viz.<strong>ओ</strong>, is due to assimilation. The Hindi <strong>औ</strong>and the corresponding Gujarati <strong>ओ</strong>, therefore, are not due to a weakening of the <strong>व्</strong>, but the <strong>ओ</strong>in the above instances is, since it is not a substitute for <strong>औ</strong>and consequently does not arise from an assimilation of the two sounds, involved in that diphthong.</p>
<p>The following are still more modern instances:—</p>
<p><strong>[Table 48:व् changed to उ]</strong></p>
<p>H. P. <strong>परमेसु</strong>र God, Skr <strong>परमेश्वर</strong>.</p>
<p>M. H. P. <strong>सुर</strong> or <strong>सूर</strong> a musical note, Skr.<strong>स्वर</strong>.</p>
<p>H. P. <strong>सुभाउ</strong>nature, Skr.<strong>स्वभाव</strong>.</p>
<p>P. <strong>सुआमी</strong>master, Skr. <strong>स्वामी</strong>.</p>
<p>In this manner the Panjabis always pronounce the <strong>व्</strong> of Sanskrit words and to a smaller extent, the Hindi people. The Marathi has not many instances of this softening of <strong>व्</strong>.</p>
<p>In the Prakrits there are according to the grammarians but. three instances of the change of <strong>क्</strong> to the sonant <strong>ग्</strong>. Of these <strong>गेन्दुअ</strong> for Skr.<strong>कन्दुक</strong>occurs in the <a href="http://#" title="See Table 22. 55 ">vernaculars</a>. With these exceptions the initial <strong>क्</strong> remains unchanged and the medial is dropped. But the vernaculars, adopting pure Sanskrit wordagain and again in the course of their history, have changed them as we have seen or changed the Prakrit words that came down</p>
<p>to them in virtue of the general or special laws which regulate the development of human speech. Thus, though they did not receive more words with a softened <strong>क्</strong> from the Prakrits, they have now come to possess a good many. Thus:-</p>
<p>[Table 49: Medial कऽoftened to ग्]</p>
<p>M. <strong>सगला</strong>, P. <strong>सगरा, सगला,</strong> or <strong>सगल</strong>, H. <strong>सगल</strong> or <strong>सगला</strong>, G. <strong>सगलो</strong>all for whole, Skr. <strong>सकल</strong> or <strong>सकलक</strong>.</p>
<p>M. <strong>बगला</strong>, H. P. <strong>बगला</strong>, G. <strong>बगलो</strong>, S. <strong>बगो</strong>, B. O. <strong>बग</strong> Skr. <strong>बक</strong> or <strong>बककः</strong>, a crane.</p>
<p>M.H. P. G.<strong>परगट</strong>or <strong>प्रगट</strong>,S.<strong>प्रघटु</strong> visible, manifest,Skr. <strong>प्रकट</strong>.</p>
<p>H. P. G. B. <strong>काग</strong>S. <strong>कांगु</strong> a crow, Skr.<strong>काकः</strong>. H. has<strong>कौवा</strong> or <strong>कौआ</strong>from Pr. <strong>काअ</strong> with the suffix <strong>कः</strong>, i.e., ओ, M. <strong>काव</strong>, of <strong>कावला</strong>, also.</p>
<p>H.<strong>लोग</strong>, S. <strong>लोयु</strong> or <strong>लोकु</strong>people, the world, Skr. <strong>लोकः</strong>. The others. have <strong>लोक</strong>.</p>
<p>H. P. <strong>साग</strong>,S.<strong>सागु</strong> greens culinary herbs, Skr.<strong>शाकः</strong>.The others <strong>शाक</strong>.</p>
<p>H. <strong>सगुन</strong>, P. <strong>सगन</strong>, G. <strong>सगन</strong> or <strong>शगन</strong>, S. <strong>सगुणु</strong>, B, <strong>शगुन</strong> an auspicious omen, Skr,<strong>शकुनः</strong>,M.<strong>शकुन</strong>. S. has <strong>सोणु</strong>, also from the Pr. <strong>सउणो</strong>.</p>
<p>H, P.<strong>सोग</strong>,S.<strong>सोगु</strong>,grief, Skr.<strong>शोकः</strong>.The others have <strong>शोक</strong>.</p>
<p>H. P. <strong>बिंगा</strong> crooked, Pr.<strong>वङ्कअ</strong>, Skr. <strong>वक्रक</strong>. The others have <strong>वांक</strong> or <strong>बां</strong>क.</p>
<p>P. <strong>सगरांद</strong> passage of the sun into a sign, Skr <strong>संक्रान्ति</strong>. The others have <strong>संक्रां</strong>त.</p>
<p>P. <strong>संगोच</strong> contraction bashfulness, Skr. <strong>संकोच</strong>; H. <strong>सकोच</strong> or <strong>सकुच</strong>, M. <strong>संकोच</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>च्</strong> is softened to the sonant <strong>ज्</strong> as in the following:-</p>
<p><strong>[Table 50:च् softened to ज्]</strong>.</p>
<p>H. <strong>सूजी</strong>a needle, Skr.<strong>सूची</strong>; also &lsquo;a tailor&rsquo; from Skr.<strong>सूचिक</strong>.</p>
<p>H.G. <strong>सूज</strong> or <strong>सूझ</strong>-[ <strong>ना</strong>and <strong>वुं</strong>]to be suggested, Skr.<strong>सूच्य</strong>.</p>
<p>H. <strong>कुंजी</strong>a key, Skr. <strong>कुञ्चिका</strong>.</p>
<p>P. S. <strong>पंज</strong> five, Skr.<strong>पञ्च</strong>;P. <strong>मंजी</strong>a small bedstead, Skr.<strong>मञ्चिका</strong>.There are not many instances of this process.</p>
<p>The Prakrits change an uninitial <strong>द</strong> to <strong>इ</strong> when preceded bya</p>
<p>vowel; and the vernaculars have preserved the words so changed. For instance:-</p>
<p>[Table 51: Medial द् softened to ड्].</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>घटक</strong>: a jar, M. H. <strong>घडा</strong>, G. S. <strong>घडो</strong>, H. P. <strong>घडा</strong>.</p>

<p>Skr. <strong>कीटक</strong>: a worm, M. <strong>किडा</strong>, G. <strong>किडो</strong>, H. <strong>कीडा</strong>.</p>
<p>The instances in which the cerebral <strong>ट्</strong> resulting from an original <strong>त्</strong> has been softened in the Prakrits to <strong>ड्</strong> have been preserved by the vernaculars. The following are some of these:-</p>
<p>[Table 52: ट्( from original त्) softened to ड्]</p>
<p><strong>पड</strong>for Pr. <strong>पडि</strong>, Skr. <strong>प्रति</strong>, in such words as H. G. <strong>पडोसी</strong> &amp; neighbour, M. <strong>पडोशी</strong>, Skr. <strong>प्रतिवेशी</strong>.</p>
<p>M. <strong>पडसाद</strong>, Skr <strong>प्रतिशब्द</strong> echo.</p>
<p>M. <strong>पडसें</strong>, Skr. <strong>प्रतिश्याय</strong> cold, catarrh,</p>
<p>M. <strong>पडछाया</strong> reflection.</p>
<p><strong>पडताला</strong> proof.</p>
<p>G.<strong>पडसाल</strong>, Skr. <strong>प्रतिशाला</strong> a penthouse.</p>
<p>G. <strong>पडघा</strong>, Skr. <strong>प्रतिघात</strong> echo or resonance.</p>
<p><strong>हरडा</strong> or <strong>हरडी</strong> and <strong>बेहडा</strong> asin Table 29; M. <strong>पुढें</strong> forward, so forth, Pr. <strong>पहुडि</strong>, Skr. <strong>प्रभृति</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>पड</strong> of M. <strong>पडणें</strong>, G. <strong>पडवुं</strong>, H. <strong>पडना</strong> to fall, Pr. <strong>पड</strong> Skr. <strong>पत्</strong>.</p>
<p>M. <strong>मढ़ें</strong> a corpse, from Pr. <strong>मडअं</strong>, Skr. <strong>मृतकम्</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>उखाडना</strong>to dig out, to root out, from the Skr. <strong>उत्खात</strong>.</p>
<p>Of the change of <strong>त्</strong> to <strong>द्</strong> there are some instances in the Śaurasenī, and corresponding to these, we have a few in the Panjabi, Sindhi and Gujarati, thus:—</p>
<p>[Table 53: त् softened to द्]</p>
<p>P. <strong>जीउंदा</strong> &rsquo;living&rsquo;, Śaur. pres. part. <strong>जीवन्दो</strong>, Skr. <strong>जीवन्त</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>दा</strong> of the present participle of roots, as <strong>करदा</strong>masc. &lsquo;doing&rsquo;, <strong>आखदा</strong> masc. &lsquo;saying&rsquo; &amp;c. A modern instance is <strong>सगरांद</strong> for the Sanskrit <strong>संक्रान्ति</strong>.</p>
<p>The Sindhi preserves the Śaurasenī present participial affix <strong>न्दो</strong> or <strong>अन्दो</strong>, sometimes changed to <strong>इन्दो</strong> throughout, as in <strong>हलन्दो</strong> &lsquo;moving&rsquo;, <strong>करीन्दो</strong> &lsquo;doing&rsquo;, <strong>हून्दो</strong> &lsquo;being&rsquo;, &amp;c. The same change is observable in other words also as in <strong>खांदि</strong> for Sanskrit <strong>क्षान्ति</strong>.</p>
<p>The Gujarati has the few instances of the Śaurasenī past passive participle in <strong>द</strong> as in <strong>खादुं</strong> &rsquo;eaten&rsquo;, <strong>पीदु</strong> &lsquo;drunk&rsquo;<strong>कीदुं</strong> &lsquo;done&rsquo;, &amp;c. Marathi has <strong>दोंद</strong> for Skr. <strong>तुन्द</strong> &lsquo;belly&rsquo;, and Gujarati <strong>दुंद</strong>.</p>
<p>The labial surd <strong>प्</strong> is, when uninitial, softened in the Prakrits to <strong>व्</strong>. The <strong>व्</strong> is preserved by the Marathi unchanged, but the Hindi softens it in some cases still further to <strong>उ</strong> as already shown(p. 433), and drops it in a great many more cases, according to a very general rule to be hereafter noticed, while the Gujarati changes it sometimes to <strong>म्</strong>. The Sindhi and Bengali follow the Hindi to a large extent in this latter respect. Thus:—</p>
<p>[Table 54: प् softened to व् or उ or म्]</p>

<p>The lingual surd aspirate <strong>ठ्</strong> is, it will be remembered, changed in the Prakrits to <strong>ढ्</strong>, and the vernaculars, especially the Hindi, have preserved the instances and even added to them, as will be seen from the following:—</p>
<p>[Table 55: ठ् changed to ढ्]</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>पठ</strong> to read Pr. <strong>पढ़</strong>, M. H. P. S. <strong>पढ</strong> in <strong>पढ़णें-ना-णु</strong>. In H. and P., however, the pronunciation of <strong>ढ</strong>is somewhat different from what it is in M, and in S. it sounds like the conjunct <strong>ड्ह</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>पीठक</strong> &amp; stool, Pr. <strong>पीढअ</strong>, H. <strong>पीढा</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>पीठिका</strong> &amp; series (of generations), Fr. <strong>पीडिआ</strong>, H. <strong>पीडी</strong>, M. <strong>पिडी</strong>, G. <strong>पेढी</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr, <strong>मठ</strong> or <strong>मठिका</strong> a small temple, Pr. <strong>मढ</strong>, H. P. <strong>मडी</strong>, old M. <strong>मड</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr <strong>दंष्ट्रा</strong>, Pr. <strong>दाढा</strong>, H. <strong>डाढ</strong>, M. G. <strong>दाढ</strong>.</p>
<p>Similarly we have H. <strong>लुढना</strong> &rsquo;to roll&rsquo; from Skr. <strong>लुठ्</strong>. In the word <strong>दाढा</strong>, the <strong>ढा</strong> does not represent <strong>ष्ट्र</strong> but <strong>ठ्ठ</strong>, to which thst Skr. conjunct must by the general rules be reduced in the Prakrits. One of</p>
<p>the two <strong>ठ्</strong> is dropped, and the preceding vowel lengthened according to a general rule in the vernaculars to be hereafter noticed. The remaining <strong>ठ्</strong> is softened to <strong>ढ्</strong>. There are other instances of the same change in our dialects. Thus:&ndash;</p>
<p>[Table 56:ट् changed to ढ्].</p>
<p><strong>वेढ</strong> of M. <strong>वेढणें</strong> 8. <strong>वेडहणु</strong>, <strong>बेढ</strong> of H. <strong>बेढना, बेड</strong> of B. <strong>वेडन</strong> &rsquo;to surround&rsquo; from Skr. <strong>वेष्ट</strong> through Pr.<strong>वेढ</strong>. The Gujarati, however, has <strong>वीठवुं</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>काढ</strong> of M. <strong>काढणें</strong>, G. <strong>काढवुं</strong>, H. <strong>काढना; कढ</strong> of S <strong>कढणु,</strong> B. <strong>काडं</strong> to draw out, &lsquo;from Pr.,<strong>कट्ठ</strong> Skr.<strong>कृष्ट</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>कूढ</strong> ofH. <strong>कूढना</strong> to mourn, from Pr.<strong>कुठ्ठ</strong>, Skr.<strong>ष्ट</strong>. Even here the Gujarati has <strong>कूटवुं</strong>.</p>
<p>H.<strong>कोढ</strong>, M. G.<strong>कोड</strong>, S.<strong>कोड्हु</strong> white leprosy, from Skr. <strong>कुष्ट</strong> through Pr.<strong>कोठ्ठ</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>ठ्</strong> arising from the Sanskrit <strong>थ्</strong> is also similarly changed to <strong>ढ्</strong>. M.<strong>सढल</strong>, H.<strong>ढीला</strong>, &amp;c., from the Skr.<strong>शिथिल</strong> as in Table 29.</p>
<p>M. <strong>कढणें</strong> to boil, <strong>काढा</strong> decoction, <strong>कढी</strong> urry, <strong>कढई</strong> cauldron, G, <strong>कद, काटो,</strong> &amp;0. H. <strong>कढना, काढा, कढी,</strong> &amp;c., all from the Skr. root <strong>क्वथ्</strong>.</p>
<p>We have noticed the change of <strong>ड्</strong> to <strong>र्</strong> and <strong>ल्</strong>, and of <strong>र्</strong> to <strong>ल्</strong>, in the Prakrits. Not only have the vernaculars preserved the words so changed, but have carried on the process to such an extent that <strong>ल्</strong> and <strong>र्</strong> have become mutually interchangeable in some of them, especially the Hindi.</p>
<p>[Table 57: ड् changed to ल्]</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>तडाग</strong> a tank, Pr.<strong>तलाअ</strong>, M. G.<strong>तलाव</strong>, H.<strong>तलें</strong>,H.<strong>तलाव</strong>, S. B.<strong>तलाउ</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>दाडिम</strong> pomegranate, Pr. <strong>दालिम</strong>, M. <strong>डालिंब</strong>, G. <strong>दालम</strong>, H. B. <strong>डालिम</strong> H. <strong>दालिम</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr.<strong>गुड</strong> molasses, Pr.<strong>गुल</strong>,</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>पीड</strong> of <strong>पीडयति</strong>to torment, to twist, Pr. <strong>पील</strong>, M. <strong>पिलणें</strong>, G. <strong>पलिवुं</strong>, H. <strong>पिलना</strong>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The numerals with their <strong>द्</strong> changed in the Prakrits to <strong>र्</strong> through an intermediate <strong>ड</strong> have come down to the vernaculars:—</p>
<table>
  <thead>
      <tr>
          <th style="text-align: center"></th>
      </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>

          <td style="text-align: center">[Table 58:द्of Skr. Numerals changed to र्]</td>

<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>The other Prakrit words <strong>दोहल</strong> and <strong>कलम्ब</strong> in which the <strong>द्</strong>of the Sanskrit <strong>दोहद</strong> and <strong>कदम्ब</strong> is changed to <strong>ल्</strong>are preserved in Marathi in the forms of <strong>डोहाला</strong> snd <strong>कलंब</strong>. Similarly <strong>हरिद्रा</strong>and <strong>अंगार</strong> with the <strong>र्</strong> so changed appear in the vernaculars as shown <a href="http://#" title="See P. 406 and Table 22.">before.</a></p>
<p>The following are later instances:—</p>
<p>[Table59: ड्and र् changed to ल्]</p>
<p>B. <strong>कोल</strong>, G. <strong>खोलो</strong> Skr. <strong>क्रोड</strong> lap.</p>
<p>B. <strong>चुल</strong>, Skr. <strong>चूडा</strong>lock of hair.</p>
<p>H. <strong>मरा</strong> for Pr. <strong>मडअ</strong> Skr. <strong>मृतक</strong> corpse.</p>
<p>H. <strong>परछाई</strong> Pr. <strong>पडिछाआ</strong>, Skr.<strong>प्रतिच्छाया</strong>.</p>
<p>H. <strong>बेराना</strong> or <strong>बिराना</strong>, Skr. <strong>विडम्बन</strong> mocking.</p>
<p>G. <strong>बालवुं</strong>from Skr. <strong>वार</strong> to resist.</p>
<p>G. <strong>पालवुं</strong>from Skr.<strong>पार</strong> to tide over.</p>
<p>H. <strong>बहलना</strong> from Skr. <strong>विहरण</strong> to amuse one&rsquo;s self.</p>
<p>S. <strong>निअरु, नेर</strong>, or <strong>नेलु</strong> fetters, from Skr. <strong>निगड</strong>.</p>
<p>H. P. <strong>नेरे</strong>, Pr. <strong>निअडे</strong>, Skr. <strong>निकटे</strong> near.</p>
<p>Though the change of <strong>ल्</strong> to <strong>र्</strong> does not involve softening, but, must be considered to be due to a predilection for the sound, it would be convenient to notice it here. There is only one instance of this change given by Hemacandra as existing in the Mahārāṣṭrī,</p>
<p>but there are a great many in the vernaculars, so that this appears to be a peculiarly modern process. The Hindi and the Sindhi have, however, of all the vernaculars, the largest number of examples, the rest presenting but a few stray ones. Sometimes both the forms with <strong>ल्</strong> and <strong>र्</strong> are in use, especially in the Hindi.</p>
<p>[Table 60: ल् changed to र् in vernaculars]</p>
<p>Skr.<strong>स्थूल</strong>, Pr**.थोर**, M.<strong>थोर</strong> large, great.</p>
<p>H. G.<strong>लंगर</strong>, M.G. <strong>नांगर</strong>, S.<strong>लंगरु</strong>, Skr. <strong>लाङ्गल</strong> a plough, or anchor.</p>
<p>H. <strong>कौर</strong> or <strong>कौल</strong>, Skr. <strong>कवल</strong> a morsel; <strong>धूर</strong> or <strong>धूल</strong>, Skr. <strong>धूलि</strong> dust; <strong>सियार</strong>, Skr. <strong>शृगाल</strong>, &amp; jackal; <strong>सराहना</strong>, Pr. <strong>सलाह</strong>, Skr. <strong>श्लाघ्</strong> to praise; <strong>दुलार</strong> Skr. <strong>दुर्लल</strong> &amp; spoilt child; <strong>सिकरी</strong>, Skr. <strong>शृङ्खला</strong> a chain; <strong>बारना</strong>, Skr. <strong>ज्वाल</strong> (caus. of <strong>ज्वल</strong>) to burn; <strong>सांवरो</strong> (Braj) for <strong>सांवला</strong>, Skr. <strong>श्यामलक</strong> dark.</p>
<p>S. <strong>सांविरो</strong>, Skr. <strong>श्यामलकः</strong> dark; <strong>पिपिरु</strong>, Skr. <strong>पिप्पलः</strong> a certain tree; <strong>पजिरणु</strong>, Skr. <strong>प्रज्वल</strong> to light or burn; <strong>पधिरणु</strong>, Skr. <strong>प्रगल</strong> to melt; , Skr. <strong>हल</strong> a plough, &amp;c.</p>
<p>G. <strong>अटारी</strong>, Skr. <strong>अट्टालिका</strong> a high mansion; M. <strong>शेवरी</strong> or <strong>सांबरी</strong>, Skr. <strong>शाल्मली</strong> the silk-cotton tree.</p>
<p>[INTERCHANGEABLENESS OF ड्, र् AND ल्]</p>
<p>N‌otable instances of the interchangeableness of <strong>ड्, र्</strong> and <strong>ल्</strong>, are afforded by the causal forms of verbal roots in some of the vernaculars. In Hindi, the causal of roots ending in a vowel is formed by inserting <strong>ल्</strong> between it and the termination <strong>आ</strong> which is the remnant of the old Prakrit <strong>आव</strong> pr‌eserved in the Braj and other dialects; as <strong>पिलाना</strong> caus. of <strong>पी</strong> &rsquo;to drink, <strong>खिलाना</strong> of <strong>खा</strong> to eat, <strong>दिलाना</strong> of <strong>दे</strong> &rsquo;to give&rsquo;, <strong>धुलाना</strong> of <strong>धो</strong> &rsquo;to wash&rsquo;, &amp;c. In Gujarati we have <strong>ड्</strong> for <strong>ल्</strong> as <strong>खवाडवुं</strong> to cause to eat,&rsquo; <strong>देवाडवुं</strong> &rsquo;to cause to give,&rsquo; <strong>न्हवाडवुं</strong>&rsquo;to cause to bathe,&rsquo; &lsquo;wash&rsquo; &amp;c. Sometimes instead of <strong>ड्, र्</strong> is optionally used as in <strong>खवराववुं</strong> &rsquo;to cause to eat,&rsquo; <strong>बीहीबराववुं</strong> &rsquo;to threaten,&rsquo; &amp;c. But in Sindhi <strong>र्</strong> always represents the Hindi <strong>ल्</strong> and the Gujarati <strong>ढ्</strong>, as in <strong>दिआरणु</strong> &rsquo;to cause to give, <strong>धुआरणु</strong>&rsquo;to cause to wash,&rsquo; <strong>वेहारणु</strong> &rsquo;to cause to sit&rsquo;.</p>
<p>What the origin is of the <strong>ड्</strong> of these forms, which is more primitive than the <strong>ल्</strong> and <strong>र्</strong> to which it was afterwards changed, will be considered in the next lecture.</p>
<p>Another peculiarly vernacular process, of which Hemacandra gives only one instance, is the transformation of <strong>न्</strong> into <strong>ल्</strong>, in which <strong>न्</strong> is deprived of its nasal element and the complete contact of the vocal organs avoided. Thus:—</p>
<p>[Table 61 Skr. न् initial changed to ल् in vernaculars]</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>निम्ब</strong> a certain tree, Pr. <strong>लिम्ब</strong> or <strong>निम्ब</strong>, for, M. <strong>लिंब</strong>.</p>
<p>M. <strong>लवणे</strong> to bow, Skr. <strong>नमन; लोणी</strong> butter, Skr. <strong>नवनीत</strong> H. <strong>लौटना</strong> to return, Skr. <strong>निवर्त</strong>, Pr. <strong>निवट्ट</strong>; G.<strong>लील</strong> blue, Skr. <strong>नील</strong>; P.<strong>ललेर</strong>, a cocoanut, Skr. <strong>नारीकेल</strong>, H. <strong>नारियेल</strong>.</p>
<p>But there are more instances of the opposite process in the Prakrits; and these have come down to the vernaculars.</p>
<p>[Table 62: Skr. initial ल् changed to न् in vernaculars]</p>
<p>M. G. <strong>नांगर</strong> a plough or anchor, P. <strong>मङ्गलः</strong> or <strong>लाङ्गल</strong>.</p>
<p>M. <strong>निढल</strong>, S. <strong>निराडु</strong>, Pr. <strong>निडाल</strong> or <strong>णडाल</strong>, Skr. <strong>ललाट</strong> forehead.</p>
<p>The H. <strong>नून</strong> salt, Skr. <strong>लवण</strong> ‌is a later instance.</p>
<p>The sibilant <strong>स्</strong>, whether original or derived from the Sanskrit <strong>ञ्</strong>, or <strong>स्</strong>, is in a few cases changed to <strong>ड्</strong> in the Prakrits. For <strong>दिवस</strong> &lsquo;a day&rsquo; we have <strong>दिवह</strong> or <strong>दिअह</strong>, for <strong>पाषाण</strong> &lsquo;a stone&rsquo; <strong>पहाण</strong>, and for <strong>दशन्</strong> &rsquo;ten&rsquo; <strong>दह</strong>. These words, so changed, have come down to the vernaculars, and are found in one or other of them. The various forms of the numerals having the word <strong>दश</strong> at the end have been given above. Of the other words G. has <strong>दिह</strong> &lsquo;a day&rsquo; and <strong>दिहाडो</strong> with the suffix <strong>डो</strong>, P. <strong>दिंह</strong> and <strong>दिहाडा़</strong>, and S. <strong>डि़ंहु</strong> and <strong>डिहाढो</strong>; and S. <strong>पहणउ</strong> &lsquo;a stone&rsquo;. The Sindhi and the Panjabi have given a wider range to this process, as will be seen from the following:—</p>
<p>[Table 63: म्, श् or ष् changed to ह in Vernaculars]</p>
<p>S. <strong>बहु</strong> or <strong>बुहो</strong> chaff, Skr. <strong>बुस</strong>, M. <strong>भुसा</strong>.</p>
<p>S. <strong>बिहु</strong> lotus-stalk, Skr. <strong>बिहु</strong>, M. <strong>भि</strong>सें.</p>
<p>S. <strong>मेंहि</strong> a buffalo, Skr. <strong>महिषी</strong>, M. <strong>म्हैस</strong>.</p>
<p>S. <strong>वेहणु</strong> to sit, Skr. <strong>उपविश</strong>, M. <strong>बैसणें</strong>, G. <strong>बेसवुं</strong>.</p>
<p>S. <strong>बेसाहु</strong> trust, Skr. <strong>विश्वास</strong>.</p>
<p>P. <strong>बीह</strong>, S. <strong>वीह</strong> twenty, Skr. <strong>विंश-[ ति]</strong>, M. <strong>वीस</strong>.</p>
<p>P. <strong>विह</strong> or <strong>विस</strong>, S. <strong>विहु</strong> or <strong>विखु</strong> poison, Skr, <strong>विष</strong>, M. <strong>विस</strong>.</p>
<p>P. स<strong>हुरा</strong>, S. <strong>सहुरो</strong>, Skr <strong>श्वशुर</strong>, M. <strong>सासरा</strong> father-in-law.</p>
<p>P. <strong>तिहा</strong> thirst, Skr. <strong>तृषा</strong>.</p>
<p>P. <strong>फाहा</strong> or <strong>फाही</strong>, S. <strong>फाहो</strong> or <strong>फाही</strong> &amp; snare noose Skr. <strong>पाश</strong>, M. <strong>फांस.</strong></p>
<p>Gujaratis, especially of the uneducated classes, pretty freely pronounce <strong>म्</strong> as <strong>ह्</strong> as in <strong>हमजवुं</strong> for <strong>समजवुं</strong> &rsquo;to understand,&rsquo; <strong>बरह</strong> for <strong>वरस</strong> &rsquo;s year&rsquo; <strong>हाचुं</strong> for <strong>साचुं</strong> &rsquo;true&rsquo;, &amp;c. but the forms with <strong>म्</strong> are also in use. The other dialects do not seem to have many instances of this change. The termination <strong>म्</strong> of verbs of the future tense is in several dialects of the Hindi changed to <strong>ह</strong> as in <strong>करिहै</strong>, G. <strong>करसे</strong> &lsquo;he will do&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The change of <strong>म</strong> to <strong>वं</strong> seems to be an almost entirely later process of which there are scarcely any instances in the Prakrits. It is seen in full operation in the Apabhraṁśa.</p>
<p>[Table 64 Skr. म changed to व]</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>नाम</strong> name, M. <strong>नांव</strong>, H, <strong>नाओं</strong>, old H. <strong>नाऊं</strong>, also <strong>नाम</strong>, P. <strong>नांउं</strong>, S. <strong>नांउं</strong> also <strong>नामु</strong> and <strong>नालो</strong>.</p>

<p>Skr. <strong>कर्दम</strong> mud, H. <strong>कांदो</strong>, G. <strong>कादव</strong>.</p>
<p>From the fact that the Marathi, Hindi, Sindhi, and Panjabi contain many instances of this change it is to be gathered that though it does not appear in the Prakrits proper, it must have begun very early, before the vernaculars received their distinctive forms and were isolated from each other. Of all the dialects the Marathi alone has preserved the <strong>व्</strong> of this <strong>वं</strong> in most cases, the Hindi and the others having dropped it or softened it to <strong>उ</strong> in good many instances; while the Gujarati changes it back again to <strong>म्</strong>. Thus, such of the above words as exist in Gujarati have the following forms:—</p>

<p>The reason why I consider this as a change of <strong>वं</strong> back to <strong>म्</strong> and not a preservation of the original Sanskrit and Prakrit <strong>म्</strong>, is that the Gujarati changes <strong>व्</strong> to <strong>म्</strong> in other cases where there is no question as to the <strong>व्</strong> (or <strong>प्</strong>) being the original sound. Thus:—</p>
<p>[Table 66: व् or प् changed to म् in Gujarati]</p>
<p>G. <strong>कमाड</strong> a door, H. <strong>किवाड</strong>, M. <strong>कवाड</strong>, Pr. <strong>कवाड</strong>, Skr. <strong>कपाट</strong>.</p>

<p>Where in Marathi we have व् or ब्, the Gujarati has in some cases म्, as in G. मुक्की a blow, M. बुक्की, G. ठाम &lsquo;&amp; place of residence&rsquo;, M. ठाव, derived in some way from Skr. स्थाप.</p>
<p>There are traces of this change in some of the other dialects too :—</p>
<p><strong>[Table 66 A: म् for प् ]</strong></p>
<p>S. P. मिंनत, B. मिनति, corresponding to M. विनंति, H. बिनति, Pr. विण्णत्ति, Skr. विज्ञप्ति &lsquo;solicitation&rsquo;; B. काछिम, Pr. कच्छव, Skr. कच्छप &rsquo;tortoise&rsquo;: H. धीमर, Skr. धीवर &lsquo;a fisherman&rsquo;; old M. मात, G. बात, Skr. वार्ता &rsquo;news&rsquo;: B. मुछ, H. पुंछ [ ना ], Skr प्रोञ्छ् &rsquo;to wipe away&rsquo;.</p>
<p>This phenomenon of the change of व् to म् the vernaculars, and especially the Gujarati, have inherited from the Piakrits. Of the words so changed the Gujarati has preserved समणुं &lsquo;a dream&rsquo;, the Prakrit form being सिमिण or सुमिण, and some of the others, नीम &lsquo;kind of tree&rsquo;. This last is नीप in Sanskrit; but probably there was an intermediate form नीव.</p>
<p>The vernaculars have thrown away the aspiration of hard and soft aspirate mutes in a good many cases. Thus:—</p>

In the instances given from Marathi, it will be seen that the letters other than those which are softened are aspirates; hence the weakening consists simply in dropping the heavy breath in one of two aspirated sounds, as in the case of the Sindhi <strong>बीख</strong> and <strong>बुख</strong>. The aspirates are preserved when occurring singly, which is not the case in Bengali. Hence Bengali utterance is the weakest, and the Hindi and Panjabi the strongest.</p>
<p>The Marathi reduces a Sanskrit or Prakrit <strong>म्</strong> invariably to <strong>स्</strong>, and in this respect differs from all its cognate dialects. Thus:—</p>

<p>Skr. <strong>क्षण</strong>a festival, Pr. <strong>छण</strong>, M.<strong>सण</strong>.</p>
<p>According to a general rule in Marathi, <strong>म्</strong> is changed to <strong>श</strong>when followed by the palatal vowel <strong>इ</strong>or<strong>ए.</strong> This change of <strong>ल्</strong> to <strong>स्</strong> in this dialect is to be accounted for by the fact that the vocal organs of the Marathas have a predilection for the dento-palatals, <strong>च, छ, ज, झ</strong>, to which the Sanskrit palatals are in almost all cases reduced by them, except when they are followed by <strong>इ, ए,</strong> or <strong>य्</strong>. The Sanskrit <strong>छ्</strong> therefore becoming the dento-palatal <strong>छ्</strong> passes into <strong>म्</strong> which differs from it only in the contact of the vocal organs being somewhat less incomplete. The only instances in the Prakrits in which the change appears to be the same as that we have been considering are <strong>ऊसवो</strong> for <strong>उच्छवो</strong> and <strong>ऊसुओ</strong>for <strong>ऊच्छओ</strong>.</p>
<p>I have already given instances of the many words with their uninitial consonants dropped which the vernaculars have inherited from the Prakrits, and shown what further changes they have undergone. This process of elision has not been continuedby any of the vernaculars unless we consider the disappearance of uninitial <strong>व्</strong> (which is very general in Hindi, Sindhi, and Bengali) to be an instance of the process.</p>

<p><strong>THE OF THE CAUSAL TERMINATIONS IN THE VERNACULARS</strong>.</p>
<p>This elision of <strong>व्</strong> appears also in the Hindi causal forms such as<strong>उठाना, चलाना</strong>, <strong>जलाना</strong>, in which the <strong>आ</strong> only of the Prakrit or Marathi termination <strong>आव</strong>or <strong>अव</strong> is retained. The whole termination appears in the Braj and other dialects and in old books, sometimes in the form of <strong>औ</strong>.</p>
<p>The Sindhi causal termination is <strong>आइ</strong>as in <strong>बधाइणु</strong> &rsquo;to cause toincrease.’The <strong>इ</strong> here as well as in some of the Sindhi words given above represents the य which according to the Prakrit rule, takes the place of the dropped <strong>व</strong>, and is, as shown before, changed to <strong>ए</strong> in the other vernaculars. The Sindhi <strong>इ</strong> is a shortened form of this <strong>ए</strong>. The termination <strong>आइ</strong>appears sometimes in its more original form of <strong>आअ</strong> as in <strong>वठाअणु</strong> &rsquo;to cause to take.’</p>
<p>The Bengali too forms its causal by adding <strong>आइ</strong>as in <strong>धराइतेछे</strong>’is causing to be held,’ but the <strong>इ</strong> here seems to be an euphonic addition, which even in their primitive form the verbs take, as in <strong>धरितेछे</strong>‘isholding,’ so that the <strong>व्</strong> is here dropped and the vowel <strong>अ</strong>combined with the preceding as in the Hindi. In the speech of the Maratha lower classes of Southern Konkan <strong>व्</strong> is very often elided, and the causal termination of the Savantvadi dialect is <strong>अय</strong>, as in <strong>करय</strong> &lsquo;cause to do, which corresponds to the Sindhi <strong>कराइ-[णु]</strong>.</p>
<p>[Table 69 A : of म् dropped in the Vernaculars ]</p>
<p>There are instances also in which the <strong>व्</strong> resulting from <strong>म्</strong>is elided:—</p>
<p>H. <strong>कुअंर</strong> &lsquo;a boy,’‘a prince,’ Pr.<strong>कुमर</strong>, Skr. <strong>कुमार; बायां</strong> &rsquo;left-hand-side, Pr. <strong>वामअ</strong>, Skr. <strong>वामकः</strong>, <strong>धुआं</strong> ‘smoke,’ Pr. <strong>धूमअ</strong>, Skr. <strong>धूमक</strong>;<strong>अचाना</strong>; ‘to rinse the mouth,’ Pr. Skr. <strong>आचम</strong>; or <strong>बेराना</strong>&rsquo; ‘tomock’,Skr. <strong>विडम्ब; भुई</strong> ‘ground,’ Skr.B.</p>
<p>There are traces of this change in other dialects too, as in the Oriya <strong>वां</strong> for <strong>वाम</strong> ‘left,’ Gujarati <strong>भांय = भूंई</strong>, S. <strong>भुइं</strong>,Skr. <strong>भूमि</strong>, and the Marathi<strong>भुंई</strong> and the termination <strong>ईं</strong> of the locative, which is to be traced to the Pr. <strong>म्मि</strong>, Skr. <strong>स्मिन्</strong>. In all these instances we may regard <strong>म्</strong> as directly elided, and not the <strong>व्</strong> resulting from it. Hemacandra notices a few instances of the process in the Prakrits.</p>
<p>The vernaculars possess a large number of those Prakrit words, in which the mute element of hard and soft aspirates was dropped leaving only the <strong>इ</strong>. Thus:—</p>
<p>[Table 70: Vernacular इ for Skr. ख]</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>मुख</strong> face, Pr. <strong>मुह</strong>. H. <strong>मुंह</strong>, S. <strong>मुहु</strong>, G. <strong>मोहो</strong>; M. <strong>मोहरे</strong>, P. <strong>मुहेरहं</strong> (with the suffix <strong>र</strong>) in front, H. <strong>मोहरा</strong>;H. <strong>सोंही</strong>, G. <strong>सामुं-मो</strong>, M. <strong>समोर</strong> (with the suffix <strong>र</strong>) from Skr. <strong>संमुख</strong> face to face.</p>

<p>P. <strong>पहिर[णा]</strong> by the consonants interchanging places.</p>
<p>[Table 74: Vernacular ह for Skr. भ]</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>प्रभा</strong> or <strong>प्रभात</strong> light, dawn, Pr, <strong>पहा, पहांअ, पहाद</strong>, H. <strong>पह</strong> or <strong>पोह</strong>, G. <strong>पोह</strong>, M. <strong>पहाट</strong>. The S. <strong>पिरिह</strong>must be a later form. From the same root with the prepositions <strong>वि</strong> and <strong>सु</strong> we have H. <strong>विहान</strong> morning, S . <strong>सुहाउ</strong> light, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>शुभ</strong> to become to adorn, Pr. <strong>सुह</strong>, H. <strong>सोह- [ना]</strong>. S. <strong>सुह-[णु]</strong></p>
<p>Skr, <strong>सौभाग्य</strong> prosperity good fortune, Pr. <strong>सोहग्ग</strong>, H. <strong>सोहाग</strong> or <strong>सुहाग</strong>.</p>
<p>Similarly, H. <strong>पहिचान</strong> ‘recognise’ is from Skr. <strong>प्रत्यभिजाना</strong>, the consonants interchanging places; G. <strong>वहालो</strong> or <strong>वाल्हो</strong>‘dear’ from Skr. <strong>वल्लभःसेहलो</strong> &rsquo;easy’ from <strong>सलभ; वेहच - [वुं]</strong> to ‘distribute or divide&rsquo; from <strong>विभज्</strong> &amp;c.</p>
<p>The existence of many such words as M. H. P. <strong>उपाध</strong>&lsquo;injury,&lsquo;H. P. <strong>साध</strong>‘a good man,&rsquo; M. G. H. P. <strong>मध</strong> &lsquo;honey, H. G<strong>लिख,लख</strong> &rsquo;to write,&rsquo; M. G. H. <strong>नख</strong>‘nail,’ S. <strong>सुभाणे</strong>&lsquo;in the morning’ shows that the popular speech of Northern India has now for a long time ceased to have recourse to this process of dropping the mute element of the aspirates of the Sanskrit words, adopted from time to time from the parent language. Still, however, a few laterinstances, such as S. <strong>पिरिह</strong> ‘dawn,’ H. G. <strong>माह</strong>‘middle’ from <strong>माध</strong>and <strong>मध्य</strong>, and some of the compounds of घर noticed above show that it has not been entirely absent.</p>
<p>The elision of simple mutes and of the mute element of aspirates is a natural phenomenon which one always meets with in the course of lingual development; but its operation is generally slow and it is only in consequence of its systematic occurrence. in the Prakrits that I have attributed it to an ethnological cause and have supposed that the Prakrit speakers belonged to another race than those who spoke Sanskrit and, being unused to Sanskrit sounds, caught only the initial consonants from their Sanskrit teachers and dropped the rest or the mute portion of the rest. When, however, in the course of time they became used to those sounds and the Sanskrit and Prakrit speaking races became united into one community, they ceased to be so dropped, except through the slow and gradual operation of the usual phonetiol laws; and hence it is that in modern times we find Sanskrit words, not shorn of their elements in the manner in which they were in ancient times, as indicated above.</p>
<p>This elision, though it involves economy and is a natural process, constitutes a peculiarity of the Prakrits in so far as it is duel to peculiar historical incidents. We will now notice the peculiarities which do not involve economy and must be attributed to vocal predilections. Of the words in which a Sanskrit dental is changed to a cerebral in the Prakrits the vernaculars have preserved the following:—</p>

<p>Thus then the Pali and Prakrit tendency to pronounce dentals. as cerebrals is seen in a much more exaggerated form in the Sindhi and next to it in the Hindi and the Panjabi, while the other modern dialects seem to have kept it quite within the bounds in which we find it in the ancient dialects, though they have changed more words in that way than they.</p>
<p>In the following instances the cerebral mute in the place of the dental is to be considered as due to the influence of an adjoining <strong>र्</strong>.</p>
<p>[Table 78: Dentals adjoining र्changed to cerebral mute]</p>

<p>Even here the Sindhi has more instances than the others:—</p>

<p>Uninitial is changed to <strong>ण्</strong> in the Prakrits invariably, but when it is the beginning of a word is undergoes that change or optionally. In the vernaculars the initial remains unchanged, but when medial it becomes mostly in the Marathi, Gujarati, Sindhi, and Panjabi.</p>

<p>M. <strong>नणंद</strong>, &amp;c., as above.</p>
<p>There are a few instances in which we have the original<strong>न्</strong> in the body of a word, as in M. G. P. <strong>मन</strong>,S.<strong>मनु</strong>, Skr. <strong>मनः</strong> &lsquo;mind,’G. <strong>वानुं</strong>&lsquo;promise&rsquo;, for Skr.<strong>वचन</strong>, and G. <strong>बेन</strong>,as above. But the general in the rule seems to be that these four dialects have a medial <strong>न्</strong> place of the double <strong>ण्</strong> of the Prakrits, resulting from a Sanskrit conjunct of which <strong>न्</strong> is a member. Thus:—</p>
<p>[Table 82 Prk. णchanged to न् in the vernaculars]</p>

<p>Skr. <strong>यज्ञोपवीत</strong>, Pr. <strong>जणोवईअ</strong>, G. <strong>जनोई</strong>, P, <strong>जनेऊ</strong>, M. <strong>जानवें</strong>, 5 <strong>जण्यो</strong>, the Brahmanic sacred thread.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>मन्य</strong>, Pr. <strong>मण्ण</strong> M. G. <strong>मान-[णें-वुं]</strong>. S. <strong>मन</strong>णु, P. <strong>मन्नणा</strong> to think, to regard, to obey.</p>
<p>But even here in Marathi, the purely Deshastha Brahmans living in the eastern part of the Deccan or Mahārāṣṭra pronounce the <strong>न्</strong>as <strong>ण्</strong>; and the ordinary <strong>रान, कान, पान, विनंति</strong>, &amp;c., of that dialect become in their mouths <strong>राण, काण, पाण, विणंति</strong>, &amp;c. They have, therefore, preserved in its integrity the old habit of the Prakrit speakers to pronounce the <strong>न्</strong> as <strong>ण्</strong> throughout. On the other hand, the lower class of the Konkani population preserve the Paiśacipeculiarty of reducing <strong>ण्</strong> in all cases to <strong>न्</strong> and pronounce of, <strong>पाणी, वाणी,कोण</strong>, &amp;c, as <strong>पानी, वानी, कोन</strong>, &amp;c, and this peculiarity we find in its fulness in the Hindi, and next to it in the Bengali. Thus the words with a <strong>ण्</strong> in them in the Marathi, Gujarati, Sindhi and Panjabi, given above, have the following forms in Hindi:—</p>
<p><strong>मानूस, दिसना, जन, कहानी, पानी, जानना, कौन, बहिन</strong>,or<strong>बैन, कठिन, जनना, लून</strong> or <strong>नून,अपना, टानना</strong> or <strong>तानना, ननद</strong> or<strong>ननदी</strong>.</p>
<p>And such of these words as are in use in the Bengali have the following:—</p>
<p><strong>मानूश, जन, किहानी, जानन, फोन, बहिन</strong> or <strong>बोन, कठिन, जनन, लोण, आपना, दानना, ननद</strong>.</p>
<p>Other words, in some of which even in Sanskrit a <strong>ण्</strong> appears, are in the Hindi and Bengali thus:—</p>
<p>[Table 83: Original ण् preserved]</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>ब्राह्मण</strong>, H., <strong>बम्हन</strong>, or<strong>बामन</strong>,B.<strong>बामुन</strong>,but S.<strong>बाभणु</strong>, a Brahman.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>शृण</strong>in <strong>शृणोति</strong>, H. <strong>सुन-[ना]</strong>, B. <strong>शुन-[न]</strong>, S. **सुण-[णु]**to hear.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>दक्षिण</strong>, H. <strong>दहिना</strong>, A. <strong>डाइन</strong>, right hand.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>गर्हण</strong> (?), H, B. <strong>गहना</strong>, S. <strong>गहणो</strong>, an ornament worn on the person.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>काण-[कः]</strong>, H. <strong>कान</strong> or <strong>काना</strong>, B. <strong>काना</strong>, S. <strong>काणो</strong>blind of one eye.</p>
<p>Still <strong>ण्</strong>does appear in Bengali books in a few words such as <strong>काण</strong>&rsquo;ear&rsquo;, <strong>लोण</strong>, &lsquo;salt&rsquo;, &amp;c. In the Hindi it seems to be entirely absent.</p>
<p>In the principal Prakrit and the Śaurasenī, all the Sanskrit sibilants are reduced to <strong>स्</strong>. Sanskrit words, therefore, containing the palatal <strong>श्</strong>and the cerebral <strong>ष्</strong>, which in the Prakrits came to have the dental <strong>स्</strong> instead, have the last in the Hindi, Panjabi, Sindhi, Gujarati, and Marathi. But according to a law of Marathi pronunciation, this <strong>स्</strong>, when followed by the palatal vowel or semi-vowel <strong>इ, ए,</strong> or <strong>य्</strong>, is transformed into the palatal <strong>श्</strong>.The foregoing list of words contain many instances that provethese points. Thus:—</p>

<p>H. M. G. <strong>नास</strong>, Skr. <strong>नाश</strong>‘destruction&rsquo;.</p>
<p>S.<strong>बस</strong>, Skr. <strong>वर्ष</strong>‘to rain’.</p>
<p>H. P. S. <strong>सेज</strong> ‘a bed,’ Skr. <strong>शय्या</strong>.</p>
<p>[Table 84 C: The Same More Modern Instances]</p>
<p>Even in words adopted later, and consequently treated somewhat differently, from the way in which they were treatedin the Prakrits, the Sanskrit <strong>श्</strong> and <strong>ष्</strong> are reduced to <strong>स्</strong>, as in the H. <strong>तर्सना</strong> &rsquo;to thirst,’ Skr. <strong>तृष्</strong> ; <strong>परवेस</strong> ‘entrance,’ Skr. <strong>प्रवेश ; परसु</strong> ‘ahatchet,’ Skr. <strong>पर्शु ; निसपति</strong>‘lord of the night,&rsquo; &rsquo;the moon,&rsquo; Skr. <strong>निशापति</strong>;S. <strong>वंसु</strong> ‘race,’ ‘descent,’ Skr. <strong>वंश;वर्सणु</strong>‘to rain,’ Skr. <strong>वर्ष</strong> ; <strong>वसिकरणु</strong> ‘to subdue,’ Skr. <strong>वशीकरण</strong> , P. <strong>सोग</strong> &lsquo;sorrow,’ Skr.<strong>शोक; सांत</strong> &lsquo;quietness,’ Skr. <strong>शान्ति</strong> ;<strong>परमेसुर</strong> &lsquo;God,’ Skr. <strong>परमेश्वर</strong>; H. <strong>वरिस</strong>, G. <strong>वरस</strong> &lsquo;a year,’ &lsquo;Skr, <strong>वर्ष</strong>; G, <strong>वरसवुं</strong> ‘to rain,’ Skr. <strong>व</strong>र्ष &amp;c.</p>
<p>The present speakers of the Hindi, the Panjabi, and the Sindhi retain therefore the vocal peculiarity of their Prakrit ancestors of pronouncing Sanskrit <strong>ष्</strong> and <strong>श्</strong> as <strong>स्</strong>.</p>
<p>Of the words given above, the <strong>सींग, सेमल, सीख</strong> and <strong>सेज</strong> of the Hindi become <strong>शिंग, शेवरी, शिक</strong> and <strong>शेज</strong> in Marathi, because they are followed by a palatal vowel. Similarly, we have <strong>शेण</strong>‘cowdung’ Skr. <strong>शकन्; शेगट</strong> &lsquo;atree,’ Skr. <strong>शिग्र ; शेवाल</strong> &lsquo;moss,’ &lsquo;Skr. <strong>शैवाल; शिडी</strong> &rsquo;ladder,&rsquo; Skr. <strong>श्रेडी</strong>, &amp;c. Even the original <strong>स्</strong>of Sanskrit words is pronounced by the Marathas as <strong>श्</strong> under those conditions, as <strong>शेंदूर</strong> ‘red lead,’ Skr. <strong>सिन्दूरः</strong> ; <strong>शिवणें</strong> &rsquo;to sew,’ Skr. <strong>सिव्</strong> ;<strong>माउशी</strong>&lsquo;mother&rsquo;s sister,’ Skr. <strong>मातृष्वसा</strong>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Gujarati too shows the same tendency though it is not so decided; and we have thus <strong>शिंग</strong>‘a horn,’ <strong>शिखवुं</strong>&rsquo;to learn&rsquo; <strong>सिववुं</strong>‘to sew,’ <strong>शिसम</strong>‘blackwood,’ Skr. <strong>शिंशप, शेज</strong>,Skr. <strong>शय्या</strong> &amp;c. But we have also such words as <strong>शिंचवुं</strong>&lsquo;sprinkling,’ Skr. <strong>सिंच, सिजववुं</strong>&rsquo;to boil,&rsquo; <strong>सिडी</strong>‘ladder, &amp;c. So that the Marathi rule does not seem to be strictly applicable to the Gujarati. Still the sound <strong>श्</strong>is as natural to the Gujaratis as to the Marathas, as is shown by such forms as <strong>शुं</strong>for <strong>सुं</strong>‘what?&rsquo;, <strong>करशो</strong>&lsquo;do,’ &amp;c., and in some provinces it is freely used for <strong>स्</strong>in many words.</p>
<p>The Bengali forms of such of the above words as are used in the language have <strong>श्</strong>for the Hindi <strong>स्</strong>, as:—</p>

<p>Bengali books and dictionaries contain a good many words, derived from the old Prakrits or recently adopted from Sanskrit, which contain <strong>स्</strong>in them. The object of the authors in these cases is to give the correct Prakrit or Sanskrit forms, and not to represent the correct Bengali pronunciation. But it is not necessary to hear a Bengali speak or read his language or even Sanskrit for a long time to arrive at the clear conviction that his vocal habits do not admit of the pronunciation of <strong>स्</strong> or, <strong>ष्</strong>,but only of <strong>श्.</strong></p>
<p>Sanskrit and Prakrit <strong>स्</strong> becomes <strong>श्</strong> in his mouth. Thus the Bengalis of the present day possess the same vocal characteristic that is attributed to their ancestors, the speakers of the Māgadhī, by the Prakrit grammarians.</p>
<p>[Table 85 A : श्changed to छ्in the vernaculars]</p>
<p><strong>श्</strong> has a tendency to pass off into <strong>छ्</strong> as we observed in going over the Pali. For the Pali <strong>छक</strong> from the Skr. <strong>शकृत्</strong>‘cowdung,&rdquo; we have <strong>छेणु</strong> in S., <strong>छाणा</strong>in G., &amp;, from <strong>शकन्</strong>, another form of the word; and for the Pali <strong>छाप</strong>, Skr. <strong>शाव</strong>‘the young of an elephant,’we have <strong>छावा</strong> in H. M. &amp;c., the Pr. form being <strong>छाव</strong>. For the Skr. <strong>शेव</strong>the G. has <strong>छेवट, छेडो</strong>, and <strong>छेल्लो</strong>‘last,&rsquo; &rsquo;end,’ with the suffixes. <strong>ट, ड</strong> and <strong>ल</strong> ; for Skr. <strong>शल्ल</strong>‘rind,’ H. has <strong>छल्ली</strong>, for Skr. <strong>शण</strong> ‘hemp,’ O. has <strong>छण</strong> ; for <strong>मूत्रधार</strong>&lsquo;carpenter,’which is <strong>सुतार</strong>in the other dialects and must have been pronounced <strong>शुतार</strong>by the Bengalis, the B. has <strong>छुतार</strong>and O. also. Other instances may be found.</p>
<p>[Table 85 B : ष् changed to ख्in Hindi]</p>
<p>In Hindi Skr. <strong>ष्</strong>is often pronounced as <strong>ख्</strong> as in <strong>भाख</strong>for <strong>भाष</strong>, ‘spoken dialect&rsquo;, <strong>पुरुख</strong> for <strong>पुरुष</strong>, <strong>भेख</strong>for <strong>वेष, विखम</strong> for <strong>विषम</strong> &amp;c. This is to be identified with the practice of the followers of the Mādhyaṁdina recension of the White Yajurveda who read the <strong>ष्</strong>occurring in their books throughout as <strong>ख्</strong>. But other dialects also have a few instances of this change, as <strong>विख</strong>P. M. G., <strong>विखु</strong>S. for Skr. <strong>विष</strong>.</p>
<p>Of the Prakrit words in which a vowel or a mute is aspirated through the influence of an adjoining aspirate or an aspirated mute, the vernaculars have preserved the following :—</p>
<p>[Table 86: Mutes aspirated in the Prakrits and the Vernaculars]</p>
<p>Pr. <strong>पनस</strong>, M. G.<strong>फणस</strong>, Skr. <strong>पनस</strong>a Jacktree. The H. has also <strong>फनस</strong> but more commonly <strong>पनस</strong>.</p>
<p>Pr. <strong>भिस</strong>, M. <strong>भिसें</strong>, H. <strong>भिस</strong>, P. <strong>भेह</strong>, Skr. <strong>बिस</strong>edible lotus root. S. has <strong>बिहु</strong>.</p>
<p>Pr. <strong>खासिअ</strong>, G. H. P. <strong>खांसी</strong>, Skr. <strong>कासित</strong> cough.</p>
<p>There are a good many modern instances:—</p>
<p>[Table 87: Mutes aspirated in the Vernaculars]</p>
<p>M. <strong>फरशी</strong>, G. <strong>फरसी</strong>, H. <strong>फरसा</strong>, Skr. <strong>परशु</strong> an axe.</p>
<p>M. G. <strong>फांस</strong>, H. <strong>फांस-फांसा-फांसी</strong>, P. <strong>फाहा-फाही-फांसी</strong>,P.<strong>फासी-फाही</strong>, S. <strong>फांस-फांसी</strong>, Skr. <strong>पाश</strong> a noose.</p>
<p>M. <strong>निभावणें</strong>, G. <strong>निभाववुं</strong>,H. <strong>निभाना</strong>, S. <strong>निभाइणु</strong>, P. <strong>निभाउणा</strong>, Skr. <strong>निर्वाह</strong>accomplishing. H. S. P. have also the forms with <strong>निबाह</strong>.</p>
<p>G. <strong>खसवुं</strong>,H. <strong>खिसना</strong>, Skr. <strong>कृष्यते</strong> to drop away, to be drown.</p>
<p>G. <strong>घऊं</strong>, H, <strong>घेऊं</strong>, or <strong>गोहूं</strong>, P. <strong>घेंऊं</strong>, Skr. <strong>गोधूम</strong> wheat. M. has <strong>गहूं</strong>.</p>
<p>M. G. O. <strong>हाड</strong>, P. <strong>हड्ड-हड्डी</strong>, S. <strong>हड्ड-हड्डी</strong>, H. B. <strong>हाड-हड्डी</strong>, Pr. <strong>अड्डी</strong>, Skr. <strong>अस्थि</strong>bone.</p>
<p>B. <strong>हांटु</strong>knee, H. <strong>ठिहुन</strong>, by interchange of places, Skr. <strong>अष्ठीवत्</strong>, Pr. <strong>अठ्ठीव</strong> ?</p>
<p>P.<strong>भाफ</strong>, B. O. <strong>भाप</strong>, Pr. <strong>बप्फ</strong>, Skr. <strong>बाष्प</strong>vapour.</p>
<p>M. <strong>घोंस</strong>a bunch, Skr. <strong>गुच्छ</strong>.</p>
<p>P. <strong>सभ</strong>, S, <strong>सभु</strong> all, Pr. <strong>सब्ब</strong>, Skr. <strong>सर्व</strong>.</p>
<p>M. <strong>खुशाल</strong>safe, well, Skr. <strong>कुशल</strong>.</p>
<p>H. P. M. <strong>भेस</strong>garb, Pr. <strong>वेस</strong>, Skr. <strong>वेश</strong>.</p>
<p>M. <strong>भूस-भुसा</strong> chaff, H. <strong>भूस-भूसा</strong>, P. <strong>भुस-भुस्सी</strong>, G. <strong>भुसो-भुसुं</strong>, B. <strong>भूशि</strong>, Skr. <strong>बुस</strong> ; S. has <strong>बुहु-बुहो</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>[Table 86 A : Aspiration transferred]</strong></p>
<p>In some cases the aspirate sound is absorbed in the adjoining mute, and it ceases to exist as a separate component of a word. Thus, from the Pr. <strong>पहुडि</strong>, Skr. <strong>प्रभृति</strong>, we have the M. <strong>पुढें</strong>in <strong>ह्</strong> which the combines with <strong>ड्</strong>, and the M. <em>dial</em>. <strong>फुडें</strong>in which it combines with <strong>प्</strong>. In the same manner the Skr. <strong>मेष</strong>‘sheep&rsquo; becomes, with the usual Apabhraṁśa suffix <strong>ड</strong>or <strong>डअ, मेसडउ</strong> or <strong>मेहडउ</strong>, which in M. and G. assumes the form of <strong>मॆंढा</strong>and <strong>मॆंढा</strong>, the <strong>ह</strong> combining with <strong>ड</strong>. and in H. and P., of <strong>भेडा</strong>, in which the being combined with the preceding <strong>मे</strong> destroys the nasal character of the sound. P. has <strong>मेढा</strong>also, and G. <strong>भेडा</strong>, and B. and O. <strong>मेडा</strong>as well as <strong>भेडा</strong>. By a similar absorption of the <strong>ह्</strong> sound and the reduction of the nasal to a mere Anusvāra, we have H. P. <strong>भैंस</strong>(masc. <strong>भैंसा</strong>), G. <strong>भेंस</strong>, B.<strong>भंईश</strong>, from Skr. <strong>महिषी</strong>‘a female buffalo,&rsquo; and G. M. <strong>भेल</strong> from Pr. <strong>मिस्स</strong>, Skr. <strong>मिश्र</strong>with the suffix <strong>ल</strong>, through an intermediate form <strong>मिहल</strong> or <strong>मेहल</strong>. We have a more ancient instance of the process in the Pr. <strong>संभर</strong>for Skr. <strong>संस्मर</strong>, through the intermediate form <strong>संम्हर</strong>, which has been preserved by the G. in <strong>सांभरवुं</strong>&rsquo;to remember &lsquo;or &lsquo;remind.’</p>
<p>Sometimes a mute is aspirated without any appsrent resson in the Prakrits, and these instances have come down to some of the vernaculars : —</p>
<p>[Table 88 : Mutes aspirated]</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>कुब्ज</strong> humpbacked, Pr. <strong>खुज्जो</strong>, M. <strong>खुजा</strong>; but P. <strong>कोझा</strong>, H. <strong>कुंजा</strong>, B. <strong>कुंजो</strong>, O, <strong>कुंजा</strong>, S, <strong>कुबो</strong> ;M. <strong>कुबड़ा</strong> also.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>कीलकः</strong>a nail, Pr. <strong>खीलओ</strong>, M. <strong>खिला</strong>, G. <strong>खिलो</strong>, B.O. <strong>खील</strong> or <strong>खिला</strong>; the rest <strong>कील</strong>.</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>कर्पर</strong> potsherd, an earthen cup, Pr. <strong>खप्पर</strong>, M. <strong>खापर</strong>, H. P. <strong>खप्पर</strong>, O. <strong>खपरा</strong> B. <strong>खाबरा</strong>.</p>
<p>Later instances are:—</p>
<p>P. <strong>ग्वूहा</strong>, S. <strong>कूहा</strong> a well, Skr. <strong>कूपकः</strong>.</p>
<p>P. <strong>छुहणा</strong> to touch, H. <strong>छूना</strong> Skr. <strong>छुप</strong>.</p>
<p>M. <strong>घागर</strong>, P. H. <strong>गागर</strong>, Skr. <strong>गर्गरिका</strong>.</p>
<p>G. <strong>खोलो</strong>lap Skr. <strong>क्रोड</strong>.</p>
<p>Of the instances in the Prakrits in which the consonants contained in a word interchange places we have :—</p>
<p>[Table 89 : Interchange of Consonants]</p>
<p><strong>हलू</strong> &lsquo;slow&rsquo; in M. Pr. <strong>हलुअ</strong>and Skr. <strong>लघुक, हौला</strong> in H. and P and <strong>हलू</strong> and <strong>हलवे</strong> in G.</p>
<p>M. <strong>सून</strong> &lsquo;dsughter-in-law, Pr. <strong>सुण्हा</strong>, Skr. <strong>स्नुषा</strong>.</p>
<p>M. <strong>निडाल</strong> &lsquo;forehead, Fr. <strong>णडाल</strong>, Skr. <strong>ललाट</strong>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>There are a good many more modern instances -</p>

<p>H. <strong>पहिरना</strong> to dress, Pr. <strong>परिहाण</strong>, Skr. <strong>परिधान</strong> P. <strong>पहिराउणा</strong> to cause to dress. In both the last two syllables are assimilated and we have <strong>पहिन्ना</strong> also ; G. <strong>परेवु</strong>by the loss of <strong>ह्</strong>.</p>
<p>G. <strong>वहालुं</strong>beloved, Pr. <strong>वल्लह</strong>, Sir, <strong>वल्लभ</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>सेहलुं</strong>easy, Pr. <strong>सुलह</strong>, Skr. <strong>सुलभ</strong>.</p>

<p>M. <strong>शेपूट</strong> or <strong>शेपटी</strong> tail, G. having <strong>पूछडुं</strong>or <strong>पूछडी</strong>, Skr. <strong>पुच्छ</strong>, with the suffix <strong>ट</strong>, the <strong>छ्</strong> being changed to <strong>श्</strong>by the usual Mrule and the palatal vowel being brought in by the palatal <strong>श्</strong>.</p>
<p>M. <strong>थोडकें</strong>little, Pr.<strong>थोक्क</strong>, Skr.<strong>स्तोक</strong>, with the suffix <strong>ड</strong>.</p>
<p>S. <strong>छुगो</strong> abunch of flowers,Skr. <strong>गुच्छ ; हिलिडो</strong> loose, Pr. <strong>सिडिल</strong>, Skr. <strong>शिथिल</strong>.</p>
<p>H. M. <strong>टिकली</strong>, &amp;c., from Skr. <strong>तिलक</strong>as in Table 75.</p>
<p>TREATMENT OF SKR. CONJUNCTS IN THE VERNACULARS,</p>
<p>We will now trace in the vernaculars the Sanskrit conjunct consonants assimilated in the Pali and the Prakrits, in the order I have observed in treating of them in the lecture on the Pali. And first I will give a few instances of those in which the second member being strong prevails over the first and is doubled.</p>

<p>When <strong>व्</strong> as the latter member of a conjunct is heavily pronounced, the double consonant that takes the place of the conjunct is <strong>प्प</strong>, <strong>ब्ब</strong>, and <strong>ब्भ</strong> according as the preceding member is asurd, a sonant, or an aspirated sonant. Sometimes, when the preceding member is a dental, the substitutes are <strong>च्च</strong>, <strong>ज्ज</strong>, and <strong>ज्झ</strong>. The following are instances of these changes in the vernaculars:—</p>

<p><strong>[DENTALS CHANGED TO PALATALS]</strong></p>
<p>Dentals have a tendency to become palatals even when not followed by <strong>य्</strong> or <strong>व्</strong>, probably because they do so become when followed by those semi-vowels. Thus, from the Skr. <strong>वादयति</strong> ‘to sound&rsquo; or &lsquo;play on a musical instrument,&rsquo; we have P. <strong>बजाउणा</strong>,H. <strong>बजाना</strong>, M. <strong>वाजविणें</strong>, &amp;c.; from Skr. <strong>निद्रा</strong>&lsquo;sleep,’ M. <strong>नीज</strong>; P. H. <strong>ओछा</strong>;&rsquo;trifling,&rsquo; &lsquo;vain&rsquo;, S. <strong>ओछा</strong>,from very probably, Skr. <strong>वृथा</strong> ;M. <strong>सावज</strong>,H. <strong>साजा</strong>from Skr. <strong>श्वापद</strong> which appears even in the Prakrits to have assumed the form of <strong>सावज</strong>,though <strong>सावय</strong>is usually given; M.

<p>When <strong>र्</strong>followed by <strong>य्</strong> is changed to <strong>ल्</strong>, this last sound prevails. over the <strong>य्</strong>, and the conjunct becomes <strong>ल्ल्</strong> in the Prakrits. The following instances of this change have come down to the vernaculars:—</p>

<p>Though accordingto Hemacandra and Vararuci, the <strong>क्ष्</strong> of <strong>क्षेत्र, कुक्षि,अक्षि,क्षीर, मक्षिका</strong>and इक्षु<strong>i</strong>s changed to <strong>च्छ्</strong>in the Mahārāṣṭrl or principal Prakrit, still we see that most of the vernaculars derive their forms of these words from such Prakrit formal as had <strong>क्ख्</strong> for the Sanskrit <strong>क्ष्</strong>. But with the exception of <strong>इक्खु</strong>and <strong>खीर</strong> which are mentioned as occurring in the Jaina sacredbooks, these forms are not given as existing in any of the dialects.</p>
<p>This and other similar omissions show that the observation of the Prakrit grammarians was by no means perfect. The Marathi forms of these words, however, with the exception of <strong>अक्षि</strong>, which is unknown to the language, and of <strong>क्षीर</strong>,which is <strong>खीर</strong>,have <strong>म्</strong> or <strong>श्</strong>, which is representative of the Prakrit <strong>छ्</strong>, and hence they are the same as those given by Hemacandra and Vararuci. Here we have one of several indications that the modern Marathi is the direct daughter of the old Mahārāṣṭrlof the grammarians.</p>
<p>It will be seen from the lists given above that the Hindi, Gujarati, Marathi and Bengali mostly drop one component of the doubled consonants, and to make up for the quantity thus lost, lengthen the preceding vowel. In other words, the speakers of those dialects take the same time to pronounce two syllables the latter of which contains a double consonant which the speakers of the Prakrit did; but the preceding forcible vowel utterance and the subsequent strong contact and pressure being avoided, the effect is that one of the two consonants is dropped and the previous vowel lengthened. This then is essentially a case of softening.</p>
<p>The Sindhi drops one of the two consonants, but does not. lengthen the preceding vowel; while the Panjabi generally preserves. the doubled consonants handed down to it by the old Prakrits. The Hindi contains more instances in which the original Prakrit pronunciation is preserved than the other three dialects. Hemacandra notices in the Prakrits the softened pronunciation we have been considering in the case of only, one of which is according to him dropped and the preceding vowel is lengthened, as in <strong>पासइ</strong> for <strong>पस्सइ</strong>, Sk. <strong>पश्यति, मीसं</strong> for <strong>मिस्सं</strong>, Skr, <strong>मिश्रम्</strong>, &amp;c. This lengthening of the previous vowel is in the four dialects prevented, as observed <a href="http://#" title="1 See pp. 424-26,">before,</a> by the accent falling on a subsequent syllable.</p>
<p>In the ‘Pali and the Prakrits, you will remember, the components of some conjuncts such as <strong>र्य्, ई, र्श्, र्ष्, श्ल्, क्ल्, ग्ल्, म्ल्</strong>, &amp;c., are not assimilated but separated by the interposition of a vowel. The vernaculars have preserved some instances of this process:—</p>
<p>[Table 99 Interposition of a vowel between the members of a conjunct]</p>
<p>H. <strong>सराहना</strong> to praise, Pr. <strong>सलाह</strong> Skr. <strong>श्लाघ</strong>.</p>
<p>H. <strong>अगनी</strong>, P. <strong>अगन</strong>, B. <strong>आसुन</strong> fire, Pr. <strong>अगणी</strong> Skr. <strong>अग्नि</strong>.</p>
<p>H. <strong>बरस, बरिस</strong>, M. <strong>वरीस</strong> a year, Pr. <strong>वरिस</strong>, Skr. <strong>वर्ष</strong>. So also H. P.<strong>वरस-[ना-णा]</strong>,G. <strong>वरसवुं</strong>, Skr. <strong>वर्ष</strong>.</p>
<p>H. <strong>गिलान</strong> tired, Pr. <strong>गिलाण</strong>, Skr. <strong>ग्लान</strong>.</p>
<p>M. <strong>किलस</strong>disgust, Pr. <strong>किलेस</strong>, Skr. <strong>क्लेश</strong>distress.</p>
<p>M. <strong>शिलोक</strong>, stanza, Skr. <strong>श्लोक</strong> G. <strong>हरख</strong> joy, Skr. <strong>हर्प</strong> G. <strong>सलखम</strong>, P. Mg, Skr., are later instances of the same nature.</p>
<p>In modern times other conjuncts also are similarly dissolved, and we have a <strong>पर्ताप</strong>S. M., &amp;c. &rsquo;exploit&rsquo; for <strong>प्रताप, खेतर</strong>, P. G., &amp;c. &lsquo;a field&rsquo; for <strong>क्षेत्र, पदमु</strong>S. &lsquo;a lotus&rsquo; for <strong>पद्म, तियाग</strong>P. for <strong>त्या</strong>ग. <strong>तर्सु</strong>S., others <strong>तरास</strong>, &lsquo;vexation&rsquo; for <strong>त्रास, धरम</strong>&lsquo;virtue&rsquo; H. M. G., &amp;c., for <strong>धर्म</strong>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>But the books and dictionaries of some of these languages contain a good many Sanskrit words the conjuncts in which are not changed in any way. This is due to the fact that those languages are now the spoken languages of the educated as well as the uneducated portions of the different communities, and the former pronounce the words correctly, and the forms given to them by the latter are not taken into account by the authors of those books. Again, even the latter, though they interpose a vowel between the components of some conjuncts as shown above, have, to a certain extent, become used to Sanskrit sounds and can pronounce others correctly. But in some of the provinces. the old disability of the Prakrit speakers has been inherited in certain cases by their modern descendants, whether educated or uneducated, and it is very much to be regretted that the writers of books should in such cases write words in their Sanskrit forms. which, when they are read by themselves or others, are read in a quite different way.</p>
<p>The people of Sindh<strong>¹</strong>, whether belonging to the higher or lower classes, and the Bengalis pronounce the conjuct <strong>क्ष्</strong>invariably as <strong>क्ख्</strong>.Thus Sanskrit <strong>नक्षत्र</strong> as <strong>नक्खत्रसाक्षी</strong> as<strong>साखी, मोक्ष</strong> as<strong>मोक्ख</strong>or <strong>मोख</strong>,&amp;c. The speakers of the Hindi more often pronounce as <strong>चा</strong> than as <strong>क्ख्,नक्षत्र</strong> becoming <strong>नच्छंत्तर</strong> with them; <strong>साक्षी, साच्छी; मोक्ष मोच्छ ; लक्ष्मण, लच्छमन ; लक्षणा, लच्छना ; क्षत्रिय, खत्री</strong> or <strong>छत्री ; क्षय, छय ; क्षम, छम</strong> ;&amp;c. The Panjabis pronounce the first three words as <strong>साखी</strong>, and <strong>मोच्छ, लक्षण</strong> as<strong>लच्छण, क्षत्रिय</strong> as <strong>खत्रि</strong>, &amp;c. so that they also agree with the Hindi people, but seem more inclined towardsmaking <strong>क्ख्</strong> of the conjunct. The Marathas, however, pronounce the <strong>क्ष्</strong>properly, though ordinarily they make <strong>क्श्</strong> of it rather than <strong>क्-ष्</strong>, as remarked on a former occasion. Similarly, the Bengali assimilates conjuncts the latter member of which is <strong>व्</strong> or <strong>य्</strong>, <strong>ईश्वर</strong>becoming <strong>इश्शर</strong> and <strong>व्याख्यान बाक्खान</strong> in his mouth. Similarly be pronounces Skr. <strong>आत्मा</strong> as just as his Prakrit ancestors did though it is written correctly.</p>
<p>ASSIMILATION OF MEMBERS OF CONJUNCTS CONTAINING NASALS</p>
<p>Some of the vernaculars assimilate the components of a conjunct made up of a nasal and a mute. Thus the Panjabi hast <strong>डन्न</strong>for <strong>दण्ड</strong> &lsquo;penalty <strong>मुन्नणा</strong> for <strong>मुण्डना</strong> &rsquo;to shave <strong>सुन्न</strong> for <strong>सुण्ड</strong>, Skr. <strong>शुण्डा</strong>&rsquo;the trunk of an elephant&rsquo;, <strong>कन्नहा</strong> for <strong>कन्धा</strong>,Skr. <strong>स्कन्ध</strong>&lsquo;shoulder&rsquo;, <strong>बन्नह</strong>for <strong>बन्ध</strong> &lsquo;binding&rsquo;, <strong>खन्न</strong>for <strong>खन्ड</strong> &lsquo;a piece&rsquo;, <strong>भन्नणा</strong> &rsquo;to break for <strong>भङ्गना</strong> or<strong>भजना, थम्म</strong> for <strong>स्तम्भ</strong> &lsquo;a pillar, &amp;c.In the Bengali <strong>खान</strong> ‘a piece&rsquo;, one of the two <strong>न्</strong> sounds of <strong>खन्न</strong> is dropped and the preceding vowel lengthened. Similarly we have <strong>थाम</strong> ‘to stop’ from <strong>स्तम्भ</strong>. In Sindhi we have <strong>भञु</strong> ‘interruption&rsquo;,for<strong>भङ्ग, चङो</strong>&lsquo;good&rsquo; for <strong>चङ्गो</strong>, M. <strong>चांगला</strong> ;<strong>मञुठ</strong> &lsquo;madder&rsquo; for <strong>मञ्जिष्ट ; पिनु</strong>&lsquo;a ball’ for <strong>पिण्ड; खनु</strong> &lsquo;apiece of bread’ for <strong>खण्ड ; चुमणु</strong> &rsquo;to kiss’ for <strong>चुम्ब</strong>, &amp;c. Here the Sindhi, as is usual with him, drops one component of thedoubled consonants. With this exception, the modern dialects have got no cases of the assimilation of the members of a conjuner unknown to the Prakrits, while, as shown above, the speakers of those dialects tenaciously retain the vocal habit of assimilation of their Prakrit ancestors in a few cases.</p>

<p>While I was Head Master of the High School at Hyderabad in Sindh, I introduced about the beginning of 1865 the study of Sanskrit, and the first thing I had to do was to teach correct pronunciation to my pupils. I bad no great difficulty, so far as I can now remember, in making them pronounce the other conjuncts, but when I came to <strong>क्ष्</strong>, all ny endeavours to teach its correct pronunciation failed. I got the most intelligent of my boys to pronounce first <strong>क्</strong> and then <strong>ष्</strong>. This he did very well, whereupon I told him to utter both the sounds one after another immediately; but instead of making <strong>क्-ष्</strong>of them the invariably gave them the form o<strong>f क्ख्</strong>. I then gave up attempt in despair.</p>
<p>And now I close this part of my inquiry. The results at which we have arrived are these: — The vernaculars of Northern India contain the instances and, in some cases, a large number of them, given by the Prakrit grammarians or occurring in Prakrit literature, of every one of the rules or processes of change grouped by me under the heads of softening, assimilation, dissimilation, interchange of places, accentuation, and peculiarities by which Sanskrit words become Prakrit. Most of these processes have been continued and their rangewidened, to such an extent in some of the dialects as to render them distinctive characteristics of those dialects Other processes scarcely or rarely observable in the Prakrits have come into operation, such as the original accent on the penultimate syllable and the final accent derived from it, the avoiding of the hiatus caused by the elision of consonants in the Prakrits in different ways, the change of to and the dropping of one component of a double consonant and the lengthening of a previous vowel; and these have further transformed the Prakrit vocables and changed also those Sanskrit words that have been adopted in later times.</p>
<p>Some of the vocal tendencies and habits of the Prakrit speakers are exihibited by the speakers of the vernaculars. Thus, like the former, the ordinary Gujarati pronounces <strong>ऐ</strong>and <strong>औ</strong> as <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong>, the Deshastha Brahmans and other people of Eastern Mahārāṣṭra have a predilection for <strong>ण्</strong>to which they reduce <strong>न्</strong> in most <a href="http://#" title="I feel it necessary for the present thus to modify the assertion made in p. 454.">cases</a>, the Sindhis make <strong>क्ख्</strong> of <strong>क्ष्</strong>, the Bengalis do the same and also pronounce <strong>श्व्, ख्य्</strong> and <strong>त्म्</strong> as <strong>श्श्</strong>, and <strong>त्त</strong>, and the Hindi people reduce <strong>भ्</strong> to <strong>छ्</strong>. These again and the Konkan lower classes pronounce <strong>ण्</strong> as <strong>न्</strong> like the speakers of the Paiśācī, and the Bengali reduces all the sibilants to <strong>श्</strong>like the speakers of the Māgadhi; while the speakers of the Hindi, Sindhi and the Panjabi exhibit the old Mahārāṣṭri and Śaurasenl characteristic of reducing them to <strong>स्</strong>.</p>
<p>The tendency to pronounce dentals as cerebrals is common to all, though it appears in a very strong form in the mouth of the Sindhis, and next to them in that of the Panjabis and the Hindi people.</p>
<p>The general or almost universal elision of certain uninitial consonants, which was a characteristic of the Prakrits, has disappeared except in isolated cases, and the assimilation of the components of a conjunct, which was also very general, hast become restricted to the few cases I have mentioned, though the words changed in the Prakrits in accordance with these two processes have come down to us in large numbers. While, therefore, this fact shows that the speakers of the Prakrits were in a condition which rendered the two phenomena very general in their speech, and that we are now free from it, the fact that we exhibit some of the same vocal peculiarities which they possessed leads to the conclusion that we are their successors or lineal descendants. And the fact that the vocables in ordinary use in our modern dialects are the same as those in the old Prakrits, whether of a Deśya or Sanskrit origin, and in the latter case, whether derived by the transformation of Sanskrit words in accordance with processes which have ceased or which have continued to operate in the vernaculars, affords strong evidence in favour of the hypothesis that these dialects are but a more developed form of the Prakrits. But to place this hypothesis beyond the reach of cavil we must examine the grammar of our vernaculars; and this I propose doing in the next two lectures.</p>
<p>LECTURE V</p>
<p>REMNANTS OF THE OLDER GRAMMATICAL FORMS IN THE NORTHERN VERNACULARS</p>
<p>I have already directed your attention to the accent on the penultimate syllable of words in the vernaculars of Northern India and the effect it has had in mutilating and transforming the Sanskrit and Prakrit words existing in their vocabularies. Through its influence, you will remember, the final vowel or the vowel of the last syllable is shortened in some cases, and often entirely dropped and the word ends in a consonant or silent . When the consonant of the last syllable is dropped in consequence of the Prakrit law of the elision of uninitial consonants, the final vowel and the vowel of the penultimate syllable are brought together and when they are in this condition, it is possible for them to unite into one sound and thus the final vowel is dropped in some cases and combined with the preceding in others. The Sindhi, however, oftentimes resists the influence of this accent as I have already mentioned.</p>
<p>CASE TERMINATIONS IN THE VERNACULARS.</p>
<p>Now on account of these processes, the nominative singular termination <strong>ओ</strong> of masculine Prakrit nouns ending <strong>अ</strong> in is sometimes shortened to <strong>उ</strong>and in this form we have it in the Sindhi and in old Marathi and Hindi literature. In the other dialects. including the modern Marathi and Hindi, it is dropped except in instances such as <strong>वाटसरु</strong>M. and** आयसु** &lsquo;command&rsquo; H. The Prakrit plural terminations <strong>अ</strong>and <strong>ए</strong> of this case are also dropped everywhere for the same reason and we have such forms as <strong>हाथ</strong>S., <strong>हाथ</strong> H., <strong>हात</strong> M. G. &amp;c. for the nom. pl. and these are the sing. forms also except in the case of the Sindhi, which has <strong>हथु</strong>.</p>
<p>In the Prakrit the plurals of the nominative and accusative cases of all nouns are alike and so are they alike in the vernaculars. The analogy came to be extended to the singulars also in the Apabhraṁśa and accordingly the singulars of the two cases. are the same in the vernaculars. An independent accusative</p>
<p>case made up by affixing a termination to a noun is given in ordinary grammars; but it has the sense of the dative, or rather of the Sanskrit genitive, which expresses relation in general. Thus we say <strong>मी काम करितों</strong> M. ‘I do work,’ <strong>हूं काम करूं छूं</strong>G., <strong>आंवकमुथो कर्यां</strong> B., <strong>मै कमकरदा</strong> P., <strong>मैकाम करता हूं</strong> H., <strong>आमि</strong> or <strong>मुइ काम करि</strong> or <strong>करिते छि</strong> B., <strong>मु कर्मकरु अछि</strong> O., in which instances <strong>काम</strong>etc. are really accusatives and we do not use <strong>कामास, कामने, कमखे, कमनु, कामको, कामके</strong> and <strong>कर्मकु</strong>, which forms are generally referred to the accusative.</p>
<p>The masculine nom, and acc. sing. form in<strong>उ</strong> was in the Apabhraṁśa extended by analogy to the neuter singular also; and, though the peculiar neuter plural termination was preserved, the fact shows that in the vernacular speech of the times there was a tendency to forget the distinction between the two genders. Accordingly we now find that in the Sindhi, the Panjabi, the Hindi, Bengali and Oriya the distinction is entirely lost. In Gujarati also nouns ending in <strong>अ</strong>have retained none of the two neuter terminations, but the Prakrit and Apabhraṁśa <strong>इं</strong> plural of that gender exists in the Marathi combined with the preceding <strong>अ</strong>into <strong>एं</strong> as ‘a fruit&rsquo; sing., <strong>फलें</strong> &lsquo;fruits&rsquo; pl.</p>
<p>This neuter pl. termination is applied in Hindi, Sindhi, and Panjabi to the pl. of fem. nouns ending in <strong>अ</strong> as in <strong>रातें</strong>&rsquo;nights&rsquo; H., <strong>जाला</strong>‘women&rsquo; S. and <strong>गल्लां</strong>&lsquo;words&rsquo; P., though the <strong>इ</strong>is changed to <strong>आ</strong>in the last two cases.</p>
<p>The change of the final syllables <strong>अओ</strong>of Prakrit words resulting from such Sanskrit words as <strong>आम्रातकः-को, पारदः-दो, दीपकः-को</strong> etc. to <strong>आ</strong>by the dropping of the final and lengthening of the penultimate through the force of the general accent on the penultimate in some of the modern dialects such as the Marathi and the Hindi and to <strong>ओ</strong>, into which the two vowels are combined in consequence of the weakness of the accent in such languages as the Gujarati and the Sindhi and in some of the minor dialects of the Marathi, has already been noticed in the last lecture. Similarly the change of the Prakrit final syllables of neuter nouns <strong>अअं</strong>or <strong>अयं</strong> arising from such Sanskrit words as <strong>कदलकम, मस्तकम्</strong> have been changed to <strong>एं</strong> in the Marathi and to <strong>उं</strong> in Gujarati and to <strong>आं</strong>in some of the dialects of the Marathi. This also has been explained. The pl. of such neuter nouns, most of which are formed by</p>
<p>the addition of <strong>क</strong>and may be called augmented nouns, is formed by the addition of the Apabhraṁśa <strong>इं</strong>, which being rendered emphatic by the nasal sound absorbs the previous <strong>अ</strong>or light <strong>य</strong> and thus wehave <strong>केलीं</strong> for Ap. <strong>कअलअ+ इं</strong>= Skr. <strong>कदलक + आनि</strong>.</p>
<p>Fem. nouns in <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>ई</strong> add <strong>आं</strong> as<strong>घोडी-घोडियां</strong> H., <strong>घोडिआं</strong> P. This <strong>यां</strong>or <strong>आं</strong>represents the combination of <strong>य</strong>or <strong>अ</strong>with <strong>इं</strong>; such nouns as घोडीbeing derived from <strong>घोटिका = घोडिआ</strong>. In Panjabi after fem. nouns in <strong>आ</strong> the <strong>ईं</strong> appears distinct, as <strong>बला</strong> a calamity, <strong>बलाईं</strong> nom. pl. In Sindhi the neuter termination is added to the original Prakrit fem. pl. <strong>उ</strong>, shortened from <strong>ओ</strong>, <strong>घोड्यूं</strong>&lsquo;mares&rsquo;nom. pl. <strong>हचा</strong>&lsquo;murder&rsquo; <strong>हचाऊं</strong>‘murders&rsquo;; <strong>जाल</strong>a &lsquo;woman,&rsquo; <strong>जालूं</strong>&lsquo;women&rsquo; nom. pl. This last <strong>जालां</strong> has it also like the P. <strong>रातां</strong>. In Marathi also it is not very unusual to speak of women in the neuter pl. when respect is intended as <strong>राणींसाहेब आलीं</strong>. This transference of neuter termination to the fem. must have taken place when gendersbegan to be confused in the Apabhraṁśa period.</p>
<p>The nom. pl. termination of masc. nouns, which in the Prakrit was <strong>आ</strong>,is preserved by the class of nouns we have been considering i. e. augmented nouns, in Sindhi and Gujarati; while the <strong>ए</strong> of the Prakrit acc. pl. is used for those nouns in the Marathi and its dialects and the Hindi and the Panjabi. When the two cases were thoroughly confounded, one can easily see how this came to pass. Other or unaugmented nouns have dropped both the terminations in all the languages, as has been already noticed.</p>
<p>The Marathi has preserved the Apabhramsa instr. sing. <strong>एं</strong> which is used after nouns in <strong>अ</strong> and the plural <strong>हिं</strong>reduced to <strong>इं</strong>. In all the modern languages the <strong>ह</strong> of the Apabhraṁśaforms is dropped. These terminations are appended to the old instrumental termination <strong>न</strong> and we have <strong>नें</strong>and <strong>नीं</strong>which are now ordinarily used. These you will see are double forms and of such we have many in the various languages. Goan., Mal. and Cit. have <strong>न्</strong> for the sing. and the last has <strong>इं</strong>for the pl.</p>
<p>The loc. Apabhraṁśa<strong>हिं</strong>from the Pali <strong>म्हि</strong>and the Skr. <strong>स्मिन्</strong>is also used, as <strong>घरीं गेला</strong>; this is peculiar to nouns in <strong>अ</strong>, and in Marathi it is reduced to <strong>आं</strong>after the augmented nouns in <strong>आ</strong>, as <strong>गलां, माथां</strong>etc. There are instances of the other locative in <strong>ए</strong>such as <strong>मध्ये</strong> and <strong>मते (माझ्या मते तुम्ही जाये</strong> ‘you should go in my opinion,’</p>
<p>where <strong>मते</strong>is hardly an instrumental); but here evidently the termination <strong>ए</strong> is confounded with the <strong>एं</strong> of the instrumental and we have <strong>माझ्या मतें</strong>lit. &ldquo;by my opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dative <strong>स</strong> is generally considered a remnant of the Skr.<strong>स्य</strong>and Pr.<strong>स्स</strong>. But I have not found it in the Jñaneśvarīand in its place we have <strong>शीं</strong>in the old poets, which is connected with a similar post-position in other languages which will be considered hereafter. None of the minor dialects of the languages have anything like it, but still the derivation may be correct.</p>
<p>Gujarati has the old instrumental in <strong>एं</strong>, but it is confounded. with the corresponding <strong>ए</strong> of the fem. and with the locative <strong>ए</strong> and we have one termination for both, with the nasal dropped. The shortened Apabhraṁśa form in <strong>इ</strong> is found in old Gujarati. It is confounded with that in <strong>इं</strong>, the anusvāra being dropped.</p>
<p><strong>(1) कान्हतणइसंपत्ति इसी जिसी इंद्रह घरि रिद्धि &hellip;&hellip; राजभवनि नवनिधि.</strong></p>
<p>&lsquo;The wealth or affluence of Kanha was as great as that of Indra.&quot;</p>
<p>From the chronicle of Kanhadade-prabandha given in the Gujarati School-paper.</p>
<p>(2) पछि हं माइरी गमि आव्यो। पछिंबीजे दिनि.</p>
<p>Pancopākhyāna, the story of Hiraṇyaka.</p>
<p>In this latter, however, there occurs an anusvāra, which should be correct, the termination is a remnant <strong>हिं</strong>. The Gujarati has also the double instrumental णेंin pronouns, as <strong>तेंणें, जेंंणें</strong>, etc.</p>
<p>The Sindhi has got the ablative terminations <strong>आं, ओं, ऊं,अउ</strong>and <strong>आउ</strong>. The first is from the pronominal instrumental <strong>हां</strong>of the Apabhraṁśaand <strong>म्हा</strong>of the Prakrit; <strong>ओं</strong>and <strong>ऊं</strong> from <strong>हुं</strong> of the former <strong>अउ</strong> and <strong>आउ</strong> and from the corresponding Prakrit. The locative <strong>ए</strong> and its shortened form <strong>इ</strong> are also preserved, but they are used after nouns in <strong>अ</strong>as in the older dialects, as <strong>खुहि</strong>or <strong>खुहेपिओ</strong>&lsquo;he fell into a well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Panjabi possesses the abl. in <strong>हुं</strong>with the <strong>ह</strong> dropped and the <strong>उं</strong> amalgamated with the preceding <strong>अ</strong>into <strong>ओं</strong>as <strong>घरॊं</strong>‘from a house, the locative pl. <strong>हिं</strong>as <strong>घरीं</strong> ‘in the house,’ the instrumental pl. <strong>हिं</strong>as <strong>उअसदें हथीं</strong>‘by the hands’ and the locative sing. in <strong>ए</strong> as <strong>उसदोदरगाहे</strong>‘in his court.’ The instr. in <strong>नें</strong> is also ordinarily used in the form of <strong>नैं</strong>.</p>
<p>The Hindi has scattered instances of the loc. in <strong>एं</strong>, but the instrumental <strong>ने</strong>is common. The Bengali has preserved the former. The instrumental also has <strong>ए</strong>, though the grammarians do not give it, as—</p>
<p><strong>सरोवर मध्ये हंस देखि रूपवती।<br>
परिवार मानसे चलिस शीघ्र गति॥</strong></p>
<p>‘The beautiful one having seen the swan in the lake went in haste with a desire to catch it.’</p>
<p><strong>शनिया भैमीर मन अनङ्गे पीडिल।</strong></p>
<p>‘Having heard (this) the heart of Bhaimīwas oppressed by love.’</p>
<p><strong>गगनथाले केमन दीपरूपे अनुक्षण<br>
शोभि छे शशीतपन</strong></p>
<p>&lsquo;How do the moon and the sun in the form of lamps shine in the plate of the sky !’</p>
<p>The Oriya also possesses the loc. in <strong>ए</strong>and as in the B. and G. it is confounded with the instr. in <strong>एं</strong>, the nasal being lost, as <strong>हातें</strong>&lsquo;in or by the hand.’ This dialect has the Pr. abl. in <strong>उ</strong>also as <strong>हातु</strong>&lsquo;from the hand.’</p>
<p>The nom. pl <strong>ओ</strong>or <strong>उ</strong>of fem. nouns in <strong>आ</strong> or<strong>ई</strong> is preserved in the Mal., Goan and Cit. as <strong>जीभ, जिभो ; साडी, साड्यो;</strong> and <strong>घोडी, घोड्यो</strong> ;but the two latter are derived from the Skr. <strong>शाटिका</strong>and <strong>घोटिका</strong>which are nouns ending in <strong>आ</strong>. The final <strong>आ</strong>, which alone. remains after the elision of the consonant <strong>क्</strong>, is dropped in consequence of the penultimate accent and we have <strong>साडी</strong> and <strong>घोडी</strong>. The <strong>ओ</strong>or <strong>उ</strong> of the plural of the original Prakrit <strong>साडिआओ-उ</strong>also isdropped like the <strong>ओ</strong> or <strong>उ</strong> of <strong>घोडओ-उ</strong> in the ordinary Marathi <strong>घोडा</strong>;and, just as the previous vowel; in this latter is lengthened in consequence the accent and the resulting form is <strong>घोडा</strong>, so the previous <strong>आ</strong> of <strong>साडिआ-ओ-उ</strong> and <strong>घोडिआ-ओ-उ</strong>, being accented, remains and we have <strong>साड्या</strong>, and <strong>घोड्या</strong>for <strong>साडिआ</strong> and <strong>घोडिआ</strong>; but in the dialects of the Marathi, in which the <strong>ओ</strong>or <strong>उ</strong>Masc. nouns in the sing. is preserved, we have <strong>घोडो</strong>and <strong>कांटो</strong>etc.; so also is the <strong>ओ-उ</strong>of the fem. preserved and we have , <strong>साड्यो,घोड्यो</strong>etc.</p>
<p>As to unaugmented fem. nouns in <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>ई</strong>, the final is, of course,dropped by the penultimate accent, but in the plural it ispreserved, being accented, and the termination of the plural <strong>ओ</strong>-<strong>उ</strong>which is unaccented is dropped, as <strong>वेल</strong> sing., <strong>वेली</strong> pl., Skr. <strong>वल्लि</strong>,&lsquo;creeper&rsquo;;<strong>बहिण</strong> sing., <strong>बहिणी</strong> pl. Skr. <strong>भगिनी</strong> &lsquo;sister; <strong>कस</strong> sing.<strong>कुसी-शी</strong>pl. &lsquo;sides&rsquo;;<strong>केल</strong> sing., <strong>केली</strong>pl., Skr. <strong>कदली</strong>etc.</p>
<p>As in the dialects of the Marathi, the pl. <strong>ओ</strong> is preserved inGujarati; but there it is transferred to the pl. of all nouns whatever and the process is going on even in our times, beingextended to the masc. nouns ending in <strong>ओ</strong> also, which formedtheir nom. and acc. pl. formerly by adding <strong>आ</strong>, as <strong>घोडो</strong> sing., <strong>घोडा</strong>pl., but now often <strong>घोडाओ</strong>. The sindhi also has preserved thefem. <strong>ऊ</strong>, as I have already observed, but the nasal of the neuter iscombined with it to form the nom, and acc. pl.</p>
<p><strong>PRONOUNS IN THE VERNACULARS</strong></p>
<p>The nom. sing. of the relative pronoun is in <strong>जो</strong> M. H. P. S. and<strong>जे</strong> in G. O. and B. O. have <strong>जेउं</strong> also. The <strong>ए</strong> of the latter is anotherform of the nom, a to be traced perhaps to the old Magadhl nom.Sing. as in <strong>ऐसे पुलिस</strong> for Skr. <strong>एषः पुरुषः</strong>. The correlative is <strong>तो</strong> in M.and H. and <strong>ते</strong> in G. and <strong>सो</strong> in P. S. and <strong>से</strong> in B. and O. TheHindi has <strong>सो</strong> also. The <strong>सो</strong>is the old Pr. nom. sing., but theoblique base in P. S. B. and O. is the old <strong>त</strong>.</p>
<p>The base of the interrogative pronoun is क as in the olderlanguages. The nom. sing. is <strong>कौन</strong> H., <strong>कौण</strong> P. and <strong>कोण</strong> G.M.and<strong>के</strong> O. and B.—also <strong>केउं</strong> O. The <strong>कोण</strong>and its varieties are to be tracedto the Pr. <strong>कउण</strong>which stands for the Skr. <strong>कः पुनः</strong>.</p>
<p>The near demonstrative is <strong>इह</strong>or <strong>एह</strong>in H. P. nom. sing, whichis also pronounced in other ways; and the nom. pl. <strong>ये</strong>. The first is to be referred to the Ap. <strong>एहो</strong>, Pr. <strong>एसो</strong>, skr. <strong>एषः</strong>; and thelatter to <strong>आये</strong> Ap. The <strong>अय</strong> of the Skr. <strong>अयम्</strong>is generalised in thislanguage and is to be found in all cases of the pronoun. Hence<strong>आये</strong>is the nom. pl. The G. has <strong>ए</strong>, M. <strong>हा</strong> m., <strong>ही</strong>fem., <strong>हें</strong> n., —dial.<strong>हो-ही-ह्यां</strong> for the nom. sing., and the regular <strong>हे</strong> m., <strong>ह्या</strong>. fem., <strong>हीं</strong> n. forthe pl.; O. has <strong>ए, एहि, इहि</strong> nom. sing., and B. <strong>ए</strong>all of which arefrom the Ap. <strong>एहो-एह</strong> or <strong>एहु</strong>.The general oblique base is <strong>य</strong> or <strong>ह</strong> inM., <strong>ए</strong> G., <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>हि</strong> S., and <strong>इ</strong> in the rest, the origin of which is the</p>
<p>same, M. <strong>य</strong>, however, being referred to the Ap. <strong>आय</strong> which is thegeneralised form of <strong>इद</strong>म्.</p>
<p>The distant demonstrative has <strong>उ</strong> for its base. The nom, sing. inH. is <strong>उ, ओ, वह</strong>, pl. <strong>वे</strong>; in P. <strong>उह</strong>, S. <strong>हू</strong> and <strong>हो</strong> and B. <strong>ओ</strong>for both.The S. has also for the sing. G. has <strong>आ</strong> for the sing. and itsusual <strong>आओ</strong> for the pl. All these are to be derived from the Ap.<strong>ओ</strong> nom. and <strong>ओइ</strong> acc. pl., traced to <strong>असु</strong> of the Skr. pronoun <strong>अदम्</strong>.The M. and O. have lost this pronoun.</p>
<p><strong>PERSONAL PRONOUNS IN THE VERNACULARS</strong></p>
<p>The nom. sing. of the first personal pronoun in M. is <strong>मी</strong> and Cit.<strong>मे</strong> both of which are to be traced to the Ap. acc. instr. and loc. <strong>मइं</strong>,Pr. <strong>मइ</strong>, Skr. <strong>मया</strong> and <strong>मयि</strong>. The Goon.has <strong>हांव</strong>, the G. <strong>हुं</strong>, old H. dialects <strong>हौ. हुं,</strong> the Dogar dialect of the P. <strong>हउं</strong>, which are all from theAp. <strong>हउं</strong> to be traced to the Skr. <strong>अहकम्</strong>¹, the <strong>उ</strong>of which is, you willremember, that of the nom. sing, which in that dialect was freelyused as the G. si is at present. The Sindhi si and si are furthercorruptions of these. H. P. have also <strong>मैं</strong> like the Cit. <strong>मे</strong> the originof both being the same. The B. and O. have <strong>मुइ</strong> and <strong>मु</strong> which maybe traced to the Ap. abl. and gen. sing. <strong>महु</strong>, but I should preferconsidering the <strong>इ</strong> of the Ap. and M. forms to be changed to <strong>उ</strong> inconsequence of the usual fondness of the B. and O. for the <strong>उ</strong> soundas noticed in the last lecture.</p>
<p>The pl. of this pronoun in M. is <strong>आह्मी</strong>, dial. <strong>आमी</strong>, B. <strong>आमि</strong>, which is the same as the Ap. <strong>अह्मइ</strong> traced by me to the Skr. <strong>अस्मके</strong>.The G. <strong>अमे</strong> and the O. <strong>अम्भे</strong>are from the usual Ap, and Pr. from <strong>अह्मे</strong>from <strong>अस्मे</strong>generalised from the usual Skr. base <strong>अस्म</strong> by false analogy. In <strong>अम्भे, ह्य</strong>is changed to <strong>म्भ</strong> as it often is. The H. <strong>हम</strong>is this<strong>अह्म</strong> but the aspiration is transferred to the initial <strong>अ</strong>, and the <strong>म</strong>, towhich it is attached in the older and the other dialect, is left free.The termination <strong>अ</strong> is also dropped. The S. and P. have <strong>असीं</strong>. Skr. <strong>स्म</strong>is sometimes changed in the Pr. to <strong>स्म</strong> as in the Māgadhī and Mah.from locative; but in the written Prakrits that have been handeddown to us, the <strong>अस्म</strong> of <strong>अस्मद्</strong> is not found corrupted to <strong>स्स</strong>. It may,however, have been so in some part of the country.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1. Mr. Beames traces them to <strong>हमु</strong> Ap., <strong>अहमम्</strong>Skr., but such forms do not exist.Prof. Lassen to whom he refers, only conjectures <strong>अहमं</strong>to account for <strong>अहअं</strong>,but <strong>अहअं</strong>is clearly derived from <strong>अहकम्</strong>which exists even in Skr. The reading <strong>हमु</strong> in the passage from Kramādīśvara given by Lassen is questionable.Hemacandra has <strong>हउं</strong> distinctly and the form oscurs in many verses.</p>
<p>The second person sing.is in <strong>तूं</strong> all the languages except B.which has <strong>तुइ</strong>. The H. has <strong>तैं</strong> also. Of these <strong>तूं</strong> is the same as theAp. <strong>तुहं</strong>, the <strong>ह</strong> of this dialect being, as you know, dropped throughout; and <strong>तुह</strong> and <strong>तैं</strong>are transferred from the instrumental. The pl.is <strong>तुम्ही</strong> in M. from the Ap. <strong>तुम्हइ</strong>similar to <strong>अम्हइ</strong>, and the B. <strong>तुमि</strong>issoftened from this. The G. has <strong>तमे</strong>, softened from <strong>तुम्हे</strong>, the <strong>उ</strong> beingchanged to <strong>अ</strong> by a peculiarity of the Gujarati, which has beenfully noticed in the last lecture. In the O. <strong>तुह्म</strong> the final <strong>ए</strong> is dropned and a softened form of this is the Hindi तुम. The P. has तुसींto be darived from <strong>तुम</strong> or <strong>युष्म</strong> in the same way as <strong>असीं</strong> from <strong>अस्म</strong>.The S has <strong>तव्हीं, तवीं, तहीं, तईं, अन्हां, अव्हीं, अवी, अहीं, आईं</strong> and <strong>अईं</strong>. In <strong>तव्हीं</strong> we have the <strong>अ</strong>to which <strong>उ</strong> is reduced as in G, and the <strong>म्</strong> of <strong>ह्मी</strong> analysed into its labial and nasal elements. The other three are softenedforms of this same, and in the rest the initiala त is dropped as wehave seen it dropped in the Pr. in the bases <strong>उह्म</strong> for <strong>तुह्म</strong>, <strong>उज्झ</strong> for<strong>तुज्झ, उब्भ</strong>for <strong>तुब्भ</strong>and <strong>उय्ह</strong> for <strong>तुह्य</strong>, both of which exist in thatdialect.</p>
<p><strong>THE VERB IN THE VERNACULARS</strong></p>
<p>The Skr. conjugational distinction is, you will remember, lostin the Prakrits; but the increments that roots undergo in theseveral classes, are preserved and made parts of the roots themselves. Now these roots so augmented have descended to thevernaculars Thus we have <strong>विह</strong>old M. G. &rsquo;to fear&rsquo; from the Skr.<strong>बिभी</strong> of the 3rd class; <strong>बुझ</strong> M. G. &rsquo;to understand,&rsquo; <strong>सिज</strong> M.&rsquo; to becooked, <strong>विझ</strong> S. &rsquo;to throw, &rsquo; M. G. H., etc.to dance,<strong>उपज</strong>M. G. &rsquo;to be born,&rsquo;<strong>निपज</strong> M. G. &rsquo;to issue forth,&rsquo;<strong>जुझ</strong> M. &rsquo;to fight,&rsquo;<strong>माज</strong> M. G. &rsquo;to be maddened&rsquo; and <strong>खिज</strong> old M. G. &rsquo;to be sad&rsquo; fromthe Skr. <strong>बुध्य, स्विद्य, विध्य, मृत्य, उत्पद्य, निष्पद्य, युध्य, माद्य</strong> and <strong>स्विद्य</strong>, all balonging to the 4th class; <strong>सुन</strong> or <strong>सुण</strong> H. S. B. P. O. from Skr. <strong>गृण</strong>of the5th; <strong>आण</strong> M. G. H. P. etc. to know, <strong>क्रिण</strong> B.O.&rsquo;to buy&rsquo; and <strong>गिण्ह</strong>S.&rsquo; to take&rsquo; from the Skr., <strong>जाना, क्रीण</strong> and <strong>गृह्वा</strong> of the 9th class. Wehave roots also in the forms which they have in the second andsixth classes, as <strong>म्हा</strong>and <strong>जा</strong>from <strong>स्ना</strong> and <strong>या</strong> of the 2nd, and <strong>लिख, लिह, तुट, फुट, लिंप</strong>, M., <strong>लिंव</strong> S., <strong>कांत</strong> (Skr. <strong>कृन्त</strong>), also <strong>काट</strong>&rsquo;to out,&rsquo; <strong>सिंच्च</strong> fromthe 6th.</p>
<p><strong>VERBAL TERMINATIONS THE PRESENT</strong></p>
<p>Of the three Pr. tenses and moods the Marathi has preservedtwo, the Present and the Imperative. The third, viz. the Future,is not lost, but the form became by phonetic corruption similarto those of the Present and you will remember, that the differencebetween the two tenses consisted in the intercalatory <strong>स्य</strong>, afterwards dissolved into <strong>सि</strong>, and thence softened to <strong>हि</strong>, which, havingdropped its <strong>ह</strong> in the vernaculars, melted away and another signhad to be added to the Present forms to indicate the Future. ThePresent was used in old Marathi and is used even at present inpoetry, but in ordinary speech it has acquired a past habitualsense. It has a potential signification in some cases as <strong>मी येइं तेथपर्यंत तेथें थांब</strong>.In the Gujarati it has acquired a potential sense inaddition to the old and, to indicate present time distinctly, theforms of the present tense of the substantive verb are used in conjunction with it, as <strong>हुं करुं छुं</strong>. The Brajbhāṣã agrees with the G.in this respect and adds its it <strong>हैं</strong> as <strong>मैं करौं हैं</strong>. In the H. P. and S. itsignifies potentiality only, and in the last āmasc., āfem, areadded to the forms to denote present time. <strong>थो</strong> is the past part, ofthe root <strong>थिअणु</strong>from Skr. <strong>स्थित</strong>, Pr. <strong>थिअ</strong>, which means &lsquo;become&rsquo;
inSindhi. The old Hindi or Braj poots use this tense in the presentalso. In all these languages, however, the old Present tense ofthe auxiliary <strong>अम्</strong> or <strong>आम्</strong> indicates present time alone. B. O. preserve this tense in the old sense throughout.</p>
<p>M. has two forms of this old Present :—</p>

<p>In poetry we have ति and सि for त and स as—</p>
<p>मुचिया काजाचेनि पांडे। देखती आपुलें जीतित्व थोकडें ॥</p>
<p>Jñāneśvarī, I. 112.</p>
<p>ऐशी सामग्री माझ्या आंगी जाणसी तूं।</p>
<p>Jñāneśvarī, III. 162.</p>
<p>The termination <strong>इं</strong> of the first person sing. is derived from thePr. <strong>मि, म्</strong>, being simply converted into an anusvärs, *i. e.,*<strong>मि</strong> when</p>
<p>pronounced without closing the lips, becomes <strong>इं</strong>. In the same waythe Pr. <strong>मु</strong> of the pl. becomes <strong>उं</strong>. The 2nd per. sing. <strong>सि</strong> remainsunaltered, but in ordinary usage the final <strong>इ</strong> is dropped inconsequence of the usual accent on the penultimate. The <strong>ह</strong> ofPr. pl. loses its aspiration, as we have found it to have done in theand thus we have <strong>कर + अ = करा</strong>. The 3rd per. sing. terminationis the same as in pr., viz. <strong>इ</strong>. The pl. has lost its nasal and incurrent Marathi they <strong>इ</strong> also , on account of the penultimate accent.</p>
<p>In the other set the 3rd per. sing. termination is <strong>ए</strong>, the same asin Pr., and to be traced to the Skr. <strong>ते</strong> of the Ātm. In the Prakritthere is no Ātmanepada termination for the 1st per. sing., butstill we have <strong>एं</strong> there. This vowel is inserted before all theconsonantal terminations of the present tense of the verb <strong>आहे</strong>.We have also <strong>ई</strong> in <strong>करीस</strong> and <strong>करीत</strong>, though it has no place in the Pr.This is probably due to the transference of the final <strong>इ</strong> in <strong>करसी</strong>and <strong>करती</strong> to the penultimate syllable.</p>
<p>The first of the two, i. e., the Parasm, set of forms, is used fortransitive verbs and the second or Ātmanepade for those that areintransitive and some that are transitive but denote a sort ofreflexive action as <strong>पढ</strong> &rsquo;to read&rsquo;, <strong>शिक</strong> to &rsquo;learn&rsquo;, <strong>बोल</strong> &rsquo;to speak&rsquo;, <strong>सांग</strong>&rsquo;to tell&rsquo;, etc.</p>
<p>The Cit. has both the padas and the एof the Ātm. is confinedto the 3rd pers sing. in the root <strong>अस</strong> as <strong>तो से</strong> but <strong>मेंसां</strong> or <strong>सइं</strong>. Inthe Mal, we have आ, and the Goan. <strong>अ</strong> long for <strong>ए</strong> as <strong>आसा</strong>, <strong>धावा</strong>and<strong>अस</strong>, the final <strong>अ</strong> being long. In these dialects the 2nd pers. pl.termination is <strong>त</strong>, which is transferred from the corresponding 3rdor is a remnant of the Pr. <strong>इत्था</strong> and the vowels of the first pers.form vṛddhi dipthongs with the preceding base in both the padas;as <strong>मी करैे</strong>&lsquo;I do&rsquo;, or &lsquo;I used to do&rsquo;, <strong>आम्ही करौं</strong>we do^(<strong>1</strong>),&rsquo; or &lsquo;used to do.&lsquo;The Goan, and Cit., however, have the first pers. sing. Ātm.in <strong>आं</strong> also. The Ätm, is not used for roots ending in other vowelsthan <strong>अ</strong>. though tney may be intransitive, as <strong>म्हा, जा, हो, दे,</strong> etc.,andin this particular the Marathi remarkably agrees with the old Pr.<br>
___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1. These vṛddhi forms appear to be due to the penultimate <strong>अ</strong> being pronouncedlong through the accent according to the usual rule and by the combinationof <strong>इं</strong> or <strong>उं</strong> with It; so that the combined sound in <strong>अइं</strong> and <strong>अउं</strong>. When thelangthened <strong>अ</strong> becomes <strong>आ</strong> it overpowers the final <strong>इ</strong> and this latter isdropped and we have <strong>मे करां</strong>Cit. or <strong>हांवकरां</strong> Goan., &lsquo;I do or used to do,just as in <strong>घोडउ</strong> a horse&rsquo; the penultimate is lengthened into <strong>आ</strong> and thefinal <strong>उ</strong> is dropped and we have <strong>घोडा</strong>.</p>
<p>O. and B. have the following forms for the Present Tense :—</p>

<p>The Hindi 2nd and 3rd person sing. and pl. are derived directly from those in Ap. The <strong>ह</strong>of <strong>करहि-हु-हिं</strong> being dropped as ususl; the forms are <strong>करइ-द-इ-इं</strong> and, when the vowels are combined,we have <strong>करे-रो-रे-रें</strong>.</p>
<p>The G. P. and B forins are exactly slmilar, the only differenceconsisting in the nasal of the 3rd. pers. pl., which has been elidedin the first, as is done in the instrumental singular. The P. and</p>
<p>Ś.<strong>ण</strong>and <strong>नि</strong> must be referred to <strong>न्ति</strong> of the Pr. since the Ap. possessed the Pr. forms as well as the new ones. In old G. MSS, it isusual to write the and of these forms separately. The G. andH. first pers. sing. <strong>करुं</strong> is from the Ap. <strong>करउं</strong>, while the art of the P.<strong>करां</strong>and the S. <strong>हलां</strong>is to be traced rather to the f of the Pr., thanto this <strong>उं</strong> as that of the <strong>सां</strong> in the Cit. and Goan, by the elision of <strong>इ</strong>and the lengthening of the preceding vowel. There are instancesof this change given in the Pr. as we have seen. The S. <strong>उ</strong> of the1st pers. pl. is the same as that in M. and O. and is to be derivedfrom the Ap. <strong>हुं</strong> and the Pr. <strong>मु</strong>. The <strong>एं</strong> of the Hindi 1st per. pl. isbrought over from the 3rd person and this transference was facilitated by the nasal of the original termination; or, since in theAp. both <strong>मि</strong>and <strong>उं</strong> exist, when in a later stage of the language theletter was appropriated and fixed for the sing, the former wasadopted for the pl. and changed to <strong>इं</strong> which became by amalgamation. The G. and P. further dropped the nasal of this ए and interposed a vowel which is probably of the same nature as that in theS.<strong>मार्य्ं</strong>. The S. like the M. inserts <strong>इ</strong> before the terminations in thecase of transitive verbs, as in the forms of <strong>मार</strong> given above, anddoes not when the verbs are intransitive or reflexive as <strong>शिक</strong>and <strong>पढ</strong>.</p>
<p>The forms of the Ap. Present occur in the older Hindi poets. Thus in Tulsidas&rsquo;s Rāmāyaṇawe have :—</p>
<p>3rd per. sing.</p>
<p>शंभु गिरा पुनि मृषा न होई। शिव सर्वज्ञ जान सब कोई ।</p>
<p>Bāla-Kāṇḍa.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But Śambhu&rsquo;s word is not false.<br>
Everybody knows Śiva to be omniscient.&rsquo;</p>
<p>निशिचर एक सिंधु मह रहई। करि माया नभकै खग गहई ॥</p>
<p>Śundars-kāṇḍa.</p>
<p>&lsquo;An evil spirit dwells in the sea and having recourse to deceitcatches hold of the birds in the sky.&rsquo;</p>
<p>संत हंस गुण गहहिंपै परिहरिं वारि विकार ।</p>
<p>Bāla-kāṇḍa.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good men like swans admit merit like milk leaving off thewatery pollution.&rsquo;</p>
<p>नारद शिख जु सुनहिं नरनारी । अवश भवन तजि होंहिं भिखारी ॥</p>
<p>Bāla-K.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Those men and women that listen to the advice of Nāradabecome beggars having abandoned their homes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>2nd per. pL :</p>
<p>करहु कवन कारण तप भारी ।</p>
<p>Bāla-K.</p>
<p>&lsquo;For what reason do you go through excessive austerities ?&rsquo;</p>
<p>विपिन अकेली फिरहुकेहि हेतू ।</p>
<p>Bāla-K.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why do you wander alone in the forest ?&rsquo;</p>
<p>1st pers. sing. :</p>
<p>नारद वचन न मैंपरिहरऊं। बसौभवन उजरो नहिं डरऊं ॥</p>
<p>Bāla-K.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall not neglect the advice of Nārada and shall not beafraid even if thereby the world stands or falls (becomesdesolated).&rsquo;</p>
<p>1st pers. pl :</p>
<p>तात सुनहुसादर मन लाई। कहहुं रामकी कथा सुहाई ॥</p>
<p>Bāla-K.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear one, do hear with an attentive mind; [we] narrate theplessing story of Rāma.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Another reading is <strong>कहौं</strong> which is sing, and the sense is &lsquo;Inarrate.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The old 2nd pers. sing. in <strong>सि</strong> is met with thus:—</p>
<p>भरत सपथ तोहि सत्य कहुपरि हरि कपट दुराइ।<br>
हरप समय विस्मय करसि कारण मोहि सुनाइ॥</p>
<p>Ayo.-K.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I charge thee in the name of Bharata; tell me the truth laying aside all insincerity. On the occasion of joy thou art gloomy;explain to me the reason.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There are also specimens of the Ātm.:</p>
<p>देखें जहं तहं रघुपति ।</p>
<p>Bāla-K.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sees Raghupati here and there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>जो अब करौंसती सन प्रीती। मिटैभक्ति पथ होइ अंनीती ॥</p>
<p>Bāla-K.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If now you are amorous towards the Satī(Pārvatī), the wayof devotion will end and immorality (will) result.&rsquo;</p>
<p>चले बसह चढ़ि ।</p>
<p>Bāla-K.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He goes having sat on the bull.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And it appears that the <strong>ए</strong> of the Present is used after verbs ofthe same kind as in Marathi. The vowel <strong>इ</strong> of the 3rd pers. sing.does not become <strong>ए</strong> as in the modern Hindi and other languages,where the distinction between the two padas is lost, but retains.its original forms as in <strong>धरि पुछी</strong> ( <strong>गइ समीप महेश तब हांसे पूछी कुशलात</strong>&lsquo;when she went near, Maheśa smiling asked her how she fared&rsquo; ).</p>
<p><strong>THE IMPERATIVE</strong></p>
<p>The Marathi, Oriya, and the Bangali have preserved theImperative mood entire; the others, only the second person sing.,the rest being taken over from the old present or the modernPotential.</p>

O. and B. have.got the form of the Present for it, the nasal being dropped.The <strong>मो</strong>of the pl. is similarly changed to <strong>ओं</strong>and is also shortenedor resolved into <strong>ऊं</strong>. The B. has the same form as the sing. The2nd pers. sing. in M. has the form without the termination as inthe Pr., the other made up by adding <strong>ईं</strong> corresponds to that in theAp. ending in that vowel. Intransitive and reflexive roots have<strong>एं</strong> instead of <strong>इं</strong>, which form is also found in the Ap. a <strong>धावें, शिकें,सांगें.</strong></p>
<p>The O. and B. do not possess these terminations but the latterhas <strong>स्</strong> which is to be traced to the Pr. <strong>सु</strong>. The pl. is the same as inthe Pr. the having left its trace in the lengthening of the vowel.</p>
<p>The O. and B. <strong>कर</strong> is also really <strong>करा</strong> pronounced broadly <strong>करो</strong>andthe latter retains <strong>ह</strong> unchanged also. The 3rd pers. sing.termination <strong>उ</strong> of the Pr. is amalgamated with the precedingvowel into <strong>ओ</strong> in M. and <strong>उ</strong> in O. and B. M. has also sometimes <strong>उ</strong>for <strong>ओ</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>क</strong> of the B. is a later addition and is probably to betraced to the Interrogative pronoun beginning with <strong>क</strong>. It is tobe compared with such M. expressions as <strong>जाऊं दे किं</strong>.The O.preserves the 3rd per. pl. <strong>न्तु</strong> unchanged but in the optional formthe final <strong>उ</strong> is dropped. M. and B. have transferred thecharacteristic <strong>उ</strong> to the preceding syllable and the former hasdropped the nasal and the latter the <strong>त</strong>. In M. the <strong>उ</strong>is, as in thesing, changed to <strong>ओ</strong>, but in some cases it is preserved and wehave such forms as <strong>जाऊत, देऊत</strong>etc. We find instances in whichthe <strong>उ</strong> preserves its place after <strong>त</strong>as in the O. Thus in Jñäneśvar! :—</p>
<p><strong>हे वरी भलतें करितु । आतांचि एथें मारितुं।<br>
परी आपण मनेंघातु। नचिंतावा॥ I</strong>–225.</p>
<p>&lsquo;These on their part may do an unwelcome thing, just hereand now kill us but we should not think of doing injury.&rsquo;</p>
<p>H. P. and G. have <strong>कर</strong> for the sing. as in the above; and <strong>करो</strong>pl.the same as that of the Present, which itself is from the Ap. <strong>करहु</strong>,the characteristic Imper. <strong>उ</strong>being attached to the <strong>ह</strong> of the Pr.;and even in the Pr. and M. B. and O. the 2nd per. pl. is the same asin the Present. The P. has also the form in <strong>ई</strong>. The SindhiImperative 2nd per. sing. of intransitive and reflexive verbs endsin <strong>उ</strong> as <strong>हलु</strong> and of transitive verbs and a few others <strong>इ</strong> as <strong>करि</strong>.The <strong>उ</strong> occurs in the Ap. along with the <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>ए</strong> as already noticed.</p>
<p>Though Modern Hindi has lost the Imperative forms for otherpersons than the second, old Hindi poets use them; and for thesecond per. sing. also, they have the Ap. form in <strong>इ</strong> preserved inS. and M. Thus Tulsidas:—</p>
<p>The 2nd pers.sing.        <strong>प्रभु हनुमंतहि कहा बुझाई।</strong><br>
in इ               <strong>घरी बतुरूप अवध पुर जाइ॥</strong></p>
<p>&lsquo;The lord said to Hanumants, &ldquo;Assume the form of a boy andgo to the city of Ayodhyā.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>The 2nd pers. pl. is the same as that of Present which prevailsIn all the languages from the Pr. downwards.</p>
<p>पारवती पहंजाइ तुम प्रेमपरीक्षा हेतु ।</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having gone to Pārvatīexamine her devotion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The 3rd per. sing. ends in <strong>ओ</strong>or <strong>औ</strong>as in the M. and O.</p>
<p>मेरी भव बाधा हरी राधा नागरि सोइ।</p>
<p>—BehārĪlāla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May that polished Rädhä remove my worldly distress.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>करो अनुग्रह सोइ ।</strong> —Tuls. R.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May he confer favours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The 3rd pers. pl. has <strong>हु</strong> which is an Ap. form found in some ofHemacandra&rsquo;s quotations. The <strong>ह</strong> has been introduced simply todistinguish it from the sing.</p>
<p><strong>चरणकमल बंदौंसबकेरे। पुरवहु सकल मनोरथ मेरे ॥</strong> —Tuls. R.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I adore the lotus-like feet of all. May they fulfil all my desires.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The 1st per. sing. is the same as that of the Present and it indifficult to distinguish it; but in such a construction as thefollowing the M. would have the imperative:</p>
<p>चली सती शिव आपसुपाई। करहिं विचार करौका माई ॥</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Satl having got Śiva&rsquo;s permission went, and was thinking what deception to use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pl. also must be the same. Old G. has also the Imper.forms in <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong> as:—</p>
<p>पूछइबात पातशाह इसी। गुजरातिते कहीइकिसी ॥</p>
<p>&ldquo;The emperor asked this matter &ldquo;how is Gujarat ? &quot;</p>
<p>गुजरा स्यूं मांडिसिं कलहु ।माहारइ साथइ कटक मोकलु ॥</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will declare war against Gujarat, send an army with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The G. and S. have another form for the 2nd per. of the Imper.;the terminations of this are <strong>इजि</strong>S., <strong>जे</strong> G. for the sing.and <strong>इजो</strong>and <strong>जो</strong>for the pl. The H. has <strong>जे</strong> and <strong>जो</strong>for roots ending in <strong>ई</strong> and <strong>ऊ</strong>and <strong>इये</strong>and <strong>इयो</strong>for the rest. The P. and B. have <strong>इओ</strong>for the pl.and in the former the singular is confounded with the usual <strong>इ</strong>termination. In M. such form is not now ordinarily used. Inaddresses on letters, however, such expressions as <strong>प्रविष्ट कीजे, दीजे</strong>are used and these forms are found in the works of the oldMarathi poets. Thus in Jñāneśvarī:—</p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;परि यासी घात कीजे । मग आपण राज्यसुख भोगिजे ।<br>
हे स्वप्नींहिमन माझें । करूं न शके ॥</strong> I-213.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This my mind cannot think of doing even in a dream that Ishould kill them and enjoy afterwards the pleasures of sovereignty.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>तरिंअवधान येकलें दीजे । मग सर्व सुखासीं पात्र होईजे ॥</strong> IX - 1.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Give your attention alone and qualify yourself for allhappiness.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>मुनि सांगे नृपनाथ । जनमेजया॥<br>
जे अद्वितीय उत्तम । पवित्रैक निरुपम।<br>
परम मंगलघाम ।अवधारिजो ॥</strong> I-48,49.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Muni narrates this story to Janamejayathe king, saying(you should) attend to this which is unique, excellent, the holything, the unsurpassed and the highest abode of all auspiciousthings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>**आतां देइजो अवधान तुझी बोलावेला मी बोलेन ॥**I-8.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Give attention now; I will speak what you make me speak.&rsquo;</p>
<p>These forms have been traced by Dr. Trump in his SindhiGrammar to the Pr. base in <strong>इज्ज</strong>used in the Present, Imperativeand Future, and derived by Lassen from the present, and by mefrom the Potential; and so far as the form in the S. and G. isconcerned there is used no objection. But these forms are used inthe vernaculars when respect for the person spoken to isintended and the Potential as distinguished from the Imperativeis by no means more respectful in Skr. The H. forms are notassigned each to each number, but both of them are used in thesing, or pl. and its <strong>य</strong> can by no means be derived from <strong>ज</strong>; for,though the contrary process, namely, the changing of <strong>य</strong> to <strong>ज</strong>,iscommon, there is, so far as I am aware, no single well-establishedinstance of the other.</p>
<p>In Skr. nothing is more usual than to use the Passive of the3rd pors. sing. Imperative in respectful solicitation. The secondpers. of the active Imper. is the least respectful, since there is adirect reference in that voice to the agent, and such a referenceto great men is regarded as improper, or in the case of others,not courteous. The 3rd pers, with <strong>भवान्</strong> as the nom. is more so,because the reference is indirect; but the most respectful construction is the Passive as it does not point to the agent at all, butto the thing done by him. Thus the <strong>ज</strong> in these forms is from the<strong>य</strong> of the passive and the Hindi <strong>ईय</strong>from <strong>ईअ</strong>, which is the othercorruption of that termination in the Pr.</p>
<p>The M. <strong>देइजो</strong>corresponds to Skr. <strong>दीयताम्</strong>, the Imper. 3rd pers.sing. termination in that language being <strong>उ</strong>. <strong>दीजे</strong>corresponds to<strong>दीयते</strong> of the Present and the Potential sense may be attributed tothe fact that the whole tense has assumed that sense in thevernaculars The agent may, if the forms are passive, be anyperson and any number since it does not agree with the verb;and this explains the Hindi usage. But generally in solicitationthe person addressed is the second person, though he is referredto indirectly, and he is, when cases are used, put in the instr.as in the Jñāneśvarī:—</p>
<p>द्रोणातें म्हणे पाहिजे तुम्हींसफल ।</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said to Droṇa everything should be looked after by you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These forms become in the G. and S. identified with the secondperson, easily because one of the terminations <strong>ओ</strong>happens to bethe same as that of the Imper. 2nd pers. pl. in those languages;and it got confused with the other Pr. Potential forms in <strong>ज्ज</strong>;wherefore we find in the S. the Imper. 2nd pers. sing. terminations <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong> applied to the base as <strong>थिजि</strong>&lsquo;become&rsquo;, <strong>सुनिजु</strong>&lsquo;hear.&lsquo;This confusion extended to the Hindi also since to roots in <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>उ</strong>it appends <strong>जे</strong> and <strong>जो</strong>; at for the Potential increment <strong>ज</strong> is given inthe Pr. to roots ending in <strong>आ, इ, ओ</strong> etc., i. e. any vowel except <strong>अ</strong>.In the progress of a language confusion is natural and frequentlyobservable.This double etymology explains all the facts ofthe case; while, if we confine ourselves to one, some are notaccounted for.</p>
<p>We have seen that there are two classes of verbs in M. one ofwhich takes the augment <strong>इ</strong> in the Present before the consonantalterminations as <strong>करीस, करीत</strong> and the other takes <strong>ए</strong> or <strong>अ</strong> as<strong>धावें धावत</strong>.The Imper. 2nd pers. sing. of the former is made up by adding <strong>इ</strong>in old or poetic Marathi and of the latter by adding ए. Theformer takes इ in the Future necessarily in the 1st and 3rd pers.sing as <strong>करील, करीन</strong> and optionally in some others as <strong>करतील</strong> or <strong>करितील,करशील</strong> or <strong>करिशील</strong>. This option is extended even to to the Present<strong>करितो</strong> or <strong>करतो</strong> and the past participle <strong>धरिलें</strong> or <strong>धरलें</strong>; while in the</p>
<p>present participle these verbs necessarily take <strong>इ</strong> as <strong>करित आहें</strong>.The latter class takes <strong>ए</strong> in the Future 1st and 3rd pers. sing. andthe option in the last is not allowed, <strong>अ</strong>being added in all, including the present part as <strong>शिकेल, शिकतील</strong> not <strong>शिकितील, शिकला</strong> not<strong>शिकिला, शिकतो</strong> and <strong>शिकत आहे</strong>; so that this olass must have <strong>ए</strong> insome cases and <strong>अ</strong> in the rest.</p>
<p>The Sindhi has a similar distinction. Those roots that take <strong>इ</strong>before the termination of the Pres. as <strong>कर्याथो</strong> &ldquo;I do&rdquo; from theirImper. 2nd pers. sing. in <strong>इ</strong> and insert this in the present part. as<strong>करीन्दो</strong>; while the rest do not add this <strong>इ</strong> as <strong>हलां</strong>1st per. sing., <strong>हलन्दो</strong>pres, part, and take <strong>उ</strong> in the Imper, sing., <strong>हलु</strong> Imper. 2nd pers. sing. We thus see that we have <strong>इ</strong> in the one case and opposed to it arethe vowels <strong>ए, अ</strong>and <strong>उ</strong> in the other. The former is a characteristicof the transitive or the non-reflexive nature of a root while thelatter is that of the opposite.</p>
<p>Why should it be so? The vowels <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>ए</strong> form the distinctivemarks of the Parasm. and Ātm. in Skr. and Pr. A consciousnessof this and of the difference between Parasm, roots and Ätm.roots has been preserved in the modern S. and M. and hencethere is an attempt to insert those vowels in all possible cases;and the base itself of the roots is made to end in them. But inthe Prakrits and to a great extent even in Skr. the base of most ofthe roots (<strong>भण, हस</strong> etc.) has an imperative signification. Hencethe newly constituted base <strong>करीं</strong> and <strong>धावें</strong> also come to have animper. sense. Now these are the forms of the Imper, not only inour language but the old Apabhramia also; hence the process Imention must have been gone through even then. This is abetter explanation of the Ap. forms than deriving them bothfrom <strong>हि</strong>, especially since this is a dialect so prone to bring in <strong>ह</strong>even when it cannot be had that it is not likely to reject analready existing one.</p>
<p>You will thus see how subtle the operation of the law ofanalogy is in the development of a language.</p>
<p>Now as regards the Ap. form <strong>उ</strong>, we see that we have it inSindhi where the other languages have <strong>अ</strong>, so that it is the oldinorganic <strong>उ</strong>which prevails so much in the Ap. And we have</p>
<p>seen that <strong>ई</strong> is used in many more grammatical forms in M. than<strong>ए</strong>, whilst, instead of it, in other places and in the Sindhi in allbut the Imper. 2nd pers. sing. we have <strong>अ</strong>; so that <strong>इ</strong> is made thedistinctive mark of the Parasm. character of a root while itsabsence or the insertion of <strong>ए</strong> indicates the Ātm. character.</p>
<p><strong>THE FUTURE</strong></p>
<p>The third Skr. tense preserved by the Prakrits is the SecondFuture. It has descended to the Gujarati. Thus:—</p>

          <td>करसे</td>
          <td>तेओ करसे</td>
      </tr>
  </tbody>

<p>The <strong>स</strong> of these forms is the old Skr. <strong>स्य</strong>corrupted to <strong>स्स</strong> in the Śaur.and <strong>स</strong> in the Ap. From the Skr. downwards the terminations of the Present in each of the languages are appended, as formerly observed, to this tense. So in G. we find in the 2nd and 3rd pers. the terminations <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>ओ</strong> of the G. Present attached to <strong>स</strong>. But the consciousness of the etymology of these forms has been partially lost;wherefore in 1st pers. we have not <strong>करसुं</strong> for the sing. corresponding to <strong>करूं</strong>, and <strong>करसीये</strong>corresponding to <strong>करूं</strong>,But G. has derived its 1st. pers. pl. <strong>करसुं</strong>directly from the Skr. or Ap. pl. <strong>करिस्समु</strong> or <strong>करिसमु</strong>, and the sing. <strong>करीस</strong> from <strong>करिस्सं</strong>, which, you will remember, was an optional Saur. form in addition to <strong>करिस्सामि</strong>, the nasal being dropped according to the usual Guj. rule.</p>
<p>We have these forms in the Braj-Bhäṣäbut the <strong>स</strong> is corrupted<br>
to <strong>ह</strong>as it very often is. Thus:—</p>

<p>Here in the 1st pers. sing. we have the <strong>औं</strong>of the Pres. Braj asin <strong>करौं</strong>, unlike the G. and in conformity with the ancient practice.You will also observe that the old augment <strong>इ</strong> is preserved. Itmay be suspected that these forms are derived from those in thePr. which have <strong>ह</strong> instead of <strong>स</strong>, but you will have observed thatthere we have <strong>हि</strong> as in <strong>करिहिइ</strong> and here <strong>ह</strong> which represents theŚaur, and Apbhr. <strong>स</strong>.The old Future occurs in Tulsidāsa&rsquo;sRāmāyaṇa.</p>
<p>3rd per. sing. <strong>प्रिया सोच परिहर सब तुमिरह श्री भगवान्।<br>
पारवती जिन निर्मयउसोइ करिहहिं कल्पान॥</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, leave off all anxiety, remember the great God. He whocreated Pārvatī will do her good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the dot on हि is a mistake this is 3rd pers. sing.,</p>
<p>3rd pers. pl. <strong>छमिहहिं सज्जन मोरि ढिटाई।<br>
सुनिहहिंबालवचन मन लाई॥</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Good men will pardon my temerity and hear the words ofthis) child with attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2nd pers. pl.<strong>कहत मम मन अतिसंकुचाई । हंसिहहु सुनिहमारि जडताई ॥</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;I am ashamed in my mind to tell the truth; for, hearing, atmy stupidity you will laugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In these forms the terminations of the Apbhr. Present areappended to the <strong>ह</strong> derived from <strong>स</strong>; but the following are threeinstances of the Braj form occurring in the same work.</p>
<p>1st pers. pl.<strong>तब तब बदन पैठिहौंआई ॥ सत्य कहौंमोहि जान दे माई ॥</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I will enter thy mouth: I tell you the truth, let me go,muther. &quot;</p>
<p>3rd pers. pl. <strong>मम कृत सेतु जो दरशन करिहैं। सो विनुश्रम भवसागर तरिहैं॥</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;They who will visit this bridge constructed by me willcross the ocean of life without trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In an essay published in the Bengal Asiatic Society&rsquo;s Journal,1873, Mr. Beames gives the forms of the Future found in theearliest Hindi poet Cand, which are exactly similar to those inthe Braj, and misled by the latter parts <strong>है, है, हो</strong>etc., which resemblethose of <strong>अस</strong> or <strong>आस</strong> so greatly, traces them to the PeriphrasticFuture of the Skr. <strong>चलितास्मि-सि</strong>etc. But this future is in the firstplace rarely used in Skr. and altogether discarded by the Paliand not a trace of it is to be found in any of the numerousPrakrits. Besides if we derive these forms from the PeriphrasticFuture, we must have in the 3rd pers. such forms as <strong>चलिआ-चलिया</strong>and <strong>चलिआर</strong>. And the old forms which Tulsidas uses of the typeof <strong>चलिहहि</strong>, from which evidently the others are derived, willremain unexplained. There can be little doubt that this derivation is wrong. We have seen the several steps by which wegradually rise to <strong>चलिहै</strong> from <strong>चलिष्यति</strong> and the chain is so wellconnected that this etymology must be admitted as correct.The resemblance to that form in Gujarati also must not beforgotten.</p>
<p><strong>THE PAST TENSE</strong></p>
<p>Past time is, in all the vernaculars, expressed by means ofthe past participle as in the Pr., all the Skr. past tenses being lost,as you will remember, except in isolated cases. This participleis in the older languages passive in the case of transitive verbsgenerally and active when the verb is intransitive and also inthe cases of some transitive verbs such as <strong>शिकलों, प्यालों</strong>etc.This rule is strictly observed in most of the modern dialects andhence in the past tense we have generally no active voice whenthe verb is transitive and the agent is, as in the older languages,put in the instr. thus in H. <strong>लेखकनें पोथी लिखी</strong>, P. <strong>उसने कम कीता</strong>,S. <strong>हुन फकीरखे धनुडिणो</strong>G. <strong>जबेरीलाले मारीपासे माणस मोकल्यो</strong>, M. <strong>पारध्यानेंबाध मारिला</strong>. In all these sentences the last words are past participles and they agree with the object in the Nom. case in number,gender and person. In the O. and B., however, all distinctionbetween gender, number and person being lost, the agreementwith the object is not perceptible. In these languages, and tosome extent in Marathi, this participle is made the base of theregular verbal forms; wherefore I shall have to discuss thispoint again.</p>
<p><strong>THE PAST PARTICIPLE</strong></p>
<p>The Hindi participle ends in <strong>अ</strong> which of course is the sametermination as in Pr., thus Skr. <strong>गत</strong>, Pr. <strong>गअ</strong>, the consonant beingelided, and with the connecting <strong>य्, गय</strong>. When augmented by theaddition of <strong>क</strong> in the manner I have shown in the last lecture andalso in this it is <strong>गया</strong>, the अalone of the <strong>क</strong> being left. In thefeminine the augmented form is <strong>गयी</strong> and where this <strong>य</strong> is notinserted it is <strong>गई</strong>. By adding this augmented form to any rootwhatever the Hindi past participle is formed as <strong>लिखा, पढा</strong> etc.An euphonic <strong>य</strong>intervenes when the root ends in a vowel as <strong>दिया,पीया</strong> etc. Similar to this is the B. and O. past participle as <strong>देखा</strong>in <strong>देखाजाव</strong>B, <strong>लेखा, दिया</strong> O. The S. terminstion is <strong>इओ</strong> and the P.</p>
<p><strong>इआ</strong> As <strong>आगिओ</strong> from <strong>जागणु</strong> &rsquo;to be awake,&rsquo; <strong>पर्खिओ</strong>from <strong>पर्खणु</strong> &rsquo;to remain,&rsquo;<strong>गइआ</strong> &lsquo;gone&rsquo;, <strong>घलिआ</strong> &lsquo;sent;&rsquo; the nom. termination <strong>उ</strong> and the augment<strong>अ</strong> for <strong>क</strong> heing left out of consideration it is reduced to <strong>इअ</strong>. TheG. hss <strong>यो</strong> and the Braj. <strong>यौ</strong>as in <strong>राख्यो, राख्यौ</strong> &lsquo;kept&rsquo; from <strong>राख,कह्यो, कह्यौ</strong>&rsquo;told&rsquo; from <strong>कह</strong>, where also the <strong>ओ</strong> being dropped the termination is i. e. g <strong>इअ</strong> hastily pronounced. These languages therefore preserve the old termination with augment prefixed to itas in the Pr, as <strong>हसिओ, परिओ</strong> etc. Some of the vernsculars andnotably the Sindhi have also inherited from the Pr. readymadeTadbhava forms of the past passive participles as:—</p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>The Sindhi seems to have made up the forms of a few rootson the analogy of these though they do not exist in the Pr. as<strong>झल्तो</strong> from <strong>झल</strong>, Skr. <strong>धृत</strong>, Pr. <strong>धरिओ</strong>; <strong>पीतो</strong> drunk, <strong>कीतो</strong> done; ( P. hasthis also ); but some of these may be modern Tadbhavas.</p>
<p>Marathi does not possess this form and past tense is expressedin that language by a form ending in <strong>ला-ली-लें</strong>. This is adjectivalin nature and passive in the case of transitive verbs and activein that of intransitive or reflexive verbs. It is in every respectthen like the Skr. and Pr. past participle preserved in the otherdislects. But here we have <strong>ल</strong> (<strong>ला</strong>) for the <strong>अ</strong> (<strong>आ</strong>) of those,</p>
<p>This <strong>ल</strong> has been traced to the Skr. <strong>त</strong>; but since in the Mahārāṣṭrīor principal Prakrit that termination leaves its <strong>अ</strong> only,it must be derived from the Śaur.<strong>द</strong> which often becomes <strong>ड</strong>, and<strong>ड</strong> is frequently confounded with <strong>र</strong> and <strong>ल</strong> as we have seen.In Sindhi Skr. <strong>द</strong> is always <strong>ड</strong> as <strong>डे</strong>&lsquo;give&rsquo; from <strong>दा, डुधो</strong>from <strong>दुग्ध</strong>and <strong>डिठो</strong>etc. Similarly even in the Prakrit period, such a changemust have taken place in several words; for instance, the Skr.<strong>दश</strong> in <strong>एकादश</strong> and in some of the succeeding numerals, becomesin the Pali <strong>दस</strong>, but is changed to <strong>रह</strong> in the Pr., which shows that<strong>द</strong> must have become <strong>ड</strong> before it aesumed the form of <strong>र</strong>. <strong>ड</strong> is interchanged with <strong>ल</strong> even in Skr. as <strong>पुरोडाश</strong> or <strong>पुरोलाश</strong>; and in the Pr.and modern dialects we have <strong>कील</strong> for <strong>क्रीड, पील</strong> or <strong>पील</strong> for Skr. <strong>पीड,डालिम</strong> for <strong>दाडिम</strong>etc. So that this etymology is possible; but I shall presently show to you that it is not to the Śaur. that weshould first look for the origin of M. words and forms; especiallyin cases when it stands alone. That the Marathi only shouldexhibit these consonantal changes in the past participle andnone of the other sister dialects and that no instance of theintermediate step between the Śaur. <strong>द</strong> and the M. <strong>ल</strong> should befound here or elsewhere as we find them in similar cases, goesa great way against this derivation.</p>
<p>The Marathi past participle in <strong>ला, ली, लें</strong>is, I think, of thesame nature as similar participles in other cognate languagesending in that termination. We have in G. besides <strong>कह्यो, कर्यो, कह्येलो</strong>and <strong>करेलो</strong> and in s. besides <strong>बिओ</strong> and <strong>दिठो, बिअलु</strong> and <strong>दिठलु</strong>.There is a little difference in the sense, but both are promiscuously used in ordinary usage. B. and O. form their Preteritewith this participle as the base as <strong>गोपाल आमाके कहिल</strong>B. &lsquo;Gopaltold us&rsquo;;<strong>अम्मे कलम देह लेखिल</strong> O. &lsquo;I wrote with a pen.&rsquo; It is alsoused as an adjective as <strong>गलादिन</strong>the past day,&rsquo; <strong>पडिला गछ</strong>&rsquo;the fallentree.&lsquo;Though it does not occur in high Hindi and is notgiven in the grammars of the languages, the lower classes ofthe Hindi population use this participle very commonly as<strong>वेचल</strong> H. &lsquo;sold,&rsquo; <strong>गयल</strong>&lsquo;gone&rsquo;; and it is also found in the works ofKabīra, though I have not seen it in Tulsīdāsa&rsquo;s Rāmāyaṇa, whichis accounted for by the fact that Kabīra was a Sūdra himselfand consequently belonged to those classes which use it at thepresent day. Thus:—</p>
<p>तब बह्मा पूछल महतारी को तोर पुरुष का करितुम नारी ॥</p>
<p>—Rāmāyaṇa II-4.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Brahmāasked his mother: &lsquo;Who is thy husband andwhose wife art thou !&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>चहुजुग भगतन बांधल बाटी । समुझि न परैमोटरी फाटी ॥</p>
<p>—Rāmāyaṇa V-7.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In all the four ages holy men constructed ways but theydid not know that the bundle they had tied had given way orwas torn!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now in the Sindhi participles <strong>ल</strong> is a termination appendedto other or old participles; as <strong>विअ</strong> and <strong>दिठ</strong> with the suffix <strong>ल</strong>become <strong>विअल</strong> and <strong>दिठल</strong>. The Gujarati ones are of the samenature; in <strong>कहेलो, लो</strong> is the suffix and <strong>कहे</strong> is the original participlein <strong>इअ</strong> or <strong>य</strong> or <strong>कहिअ</strong> or <strong>कह्य</strong>which is changed to <strong>ए</strong>, as <strong>य</strong> often is.Even in Marathi in the forms <strong>गेला, केला, आला, आयलो</strong> in the minordialects, <strong>जाहला, मेला, भ्याला, प्पाला</strong> etc., <strong>गे</strong>represents <strong>गय</strong> (Pr. <strong>गअ</strong>,Skr. <strong>गत</strong> ); <strong>के, क</strong>य ( Pr. <strong>कअ</strong>, Skr <strong>कृत</strong>); <strong>आय ,आअ</strong>(Pr. <strong>आअअ</strong>, Skr. <strong>आगत</strong>);<strong>जाह, जाअ</strong>(Pr. <strong>जाअ</strong>, skr. <strong>जात</strong>) <strong>मेमय</strong> ( Pr. <strong>मृत</strong>) <strong>भ्या-भीआ, प्या-पीआ</strong>and so on. In the B. too we have <strong>केल, गेल, आइल</strong> which are justlike the Marathi forms and are to be explained in the same way.In old Marathi we similarly find this <strong>ल</strong> appended to real pastparticiples. In an old Inscription dated Śaka 1128 = 1206 A. D.,the latter portion of which is in the Marathi of the time and being so was difficult to decipher, there occurs the expression<strong>मढा दिन्हला</strong>&lsquo;given to a monastery&rsquo; in which we see that <strong>ला</strong> isappended to <strong>दिन्ह</strong>which is the same as the old Pali and Pr. participle <strong>दिण्ण</strong>of the root <strong>दा</strong>.</p>
<p>In Skr. a great many roots formed their participles by adding<strong>न</strong> instead of <strong>त</strong>and we find several of these and others formedon the analogy of these in old Hindi and Marathi poetry. Inthe works of Tulsīdāsa, Kabīra, Canda and others <strong>कीन्ह</strong>&lsquo;done&rsquo;<strong>लन्हि</strong>&rsquo;taken,&rsquo; &rsquo; &lsquo;known,&rsquo; <strong>दीन्ह</strong> &lsquo;given&rsquo; and such others occur :—</p>
<p>नाना विधि मुनि पूजा कीन्ही । अस्तुति करि पुनि आशिष दीन्ही ॥</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sage worshipped him in several ways, praised him andgave him a blessing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Marathi poets we have added to <strong>न</strong> as Jñāneśvarī.</p>
<p>ते दीनी शब्द अचाट । मिनले एकवट ।</p>
<p>&lsquo;Both these dreadful noises mingled together.&rsquo;</p>
<p>सनकादिकांचिया आशा । वाहीनल्पाबहुबसा ।</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hopes of Sanaka and others increased greatly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ekanātha.</p>
<p>धर्माप्रति घाविम्नला ।</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ran towards Dharma or virtue.&rsquo;</p>
<p>ऐकोनि हासिम्नला गोविंद ।</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hearing this, Govinda smiled&rsquo;.</p>
<p>RukmiṇīSvayaṃvara.</p>
<p>In the following <strong>ला</strong>is applied to old Tadbhava participles:—</p>
<p>में भ्रांति सेजे सुतला । ते स्वप्नसुखभुतला। मग तो ज्ञानोदयीं चेइला। म्हणोनिया ॥</p>
<p>Jñān. V-47.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because when he slept on the bed of delusion he enjoyed thepleasures of a dream and then awoke when the sun of knowledgerose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>भीतरीं पातला उठा उठीं। जेथ जगजेठी श्रीकृष्ण ॥</p>
<p>&lsquo;Went in where the lord of the world Śri Kṛṣṇa was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here <strong>सुत भुत</strong> and <strong>पात</strong>, are from <strong>सुत्त,भुत्त</strong> and <strong>पत्त</strong> Pr. <strong>सुप्त, भुक्त</strong> snd <strong>प्राप्त</strong>Skr.; and to these <strong>ला</strong>, is added. There are other instances in theseworks in which <strong>ला</strong>is added to past Tatsams or later TadbhavaParticiples such as द<strong>ग्धला, लुब्धला, हाणितला, म्हणितला</strong>; and in theInnguage of the day we have <strong>सांगितले, घेतलें मागितलें धुतलें</strong> and oneor two others. In the Jñaneśvarīwe have also such forms as <strong>बिसणैला</strong>&rsquo;excited&rsquo;, <strong>निदैला</strong>&lsquo;slept&rsquo;, and <strong>आभारैला</strong> where the <strong>ऐ</strong> represents the<strong>अय</strong> or <strong>इअ</strong> of the old participle resembling in this respect the Guj<strong>फहेलो</strong>.</p>
<p>When the <strong>अ</strong> or <strong>आ</strong>of the old participle became too weak to beexpressive, this form with the suffix <strong>ल</strong> attached was oftener usedand gradually supplanted the other; and <strong>ल</strong> came in the course oftime to be regarded as the past participle termination. Hence itis applied to roots directly without the intervention of the old <strong>ए</strong>that we have in <strong>केला</strong> and <strong>गेला</strong>; and in low Hindi also, it is appliedin the same way. The original participle was mostly used</p>
<p>predicatively as it it is in classical Skr. also, and this <strong>ल</strong> wasattached to it to form an attributive expression to be used beforenouns. But after time this new form also came to bepredicatively used; and it is now so used in M., G., S. and H.In M. however, when it was put to this purpose, it drove out theold one, and its own attributive sense became faint, though evennow it is not entirely lost in such instances as <strong>झाल्या गोष्टीसउपाय नाहीं</strong>&rsquo;there is no remedy against the thing that has alreadytaken place.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then another <strong>ल</strong> came to be attached to it to adapt it forattributive use, and thus we have now in M. the form <strong>केतेला, गेलेला</strong>etc. with a double <strong>ल</strong>. This <strong>ल</strong> is to be traced to the Pr. <strong>इल्ल</strong>or <strong>उल्ल</strong>which according to Hemacandra is applied in the sense of Bhāvai.e. being the thing signified by the base as <strong>उवदिल्लं, अप्पुल्लं</strong>. These twowords aro in M. <strong>वरील</strong> or <strong>वरला</strong> and <strong>आपुलें</strong> or <strong>आपलें</strong>, in which instanceswe see that the initial <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>उ</strong> of the suffix is optionally dropped.Or according to other writers, quoted by our grammarians, <strong>आल</strong>is also used. And in works such as the Gauḍavadha and in theBhagavatīwe find these suffixes frequently used. These aregenerally applied to all bases; but <strong>ल</strong> is another terminationwhich is restricted to certain nouns such as <strong>विद्युत्, पीत, पत्र, अन्ध</strong>,from which we have <strong>विज्जल, पीतल</strong> etc. In Skr. also this suffix hasn pretty wide range as <strong>चूडाल</strong> Pāṇini V. 2 96 <strong>सिध्मल, कृष्णल, पांसुल,मांसल, स्नेहल</strong> etc, V. 3. 97 <strong>वत्सल</strong> V. 2.98; <strong>फैनल</strong> V. 2-99.</p>
<p><strong>THE PRESENT PARTICIPLE IN THE VERNACULARS</strong></p>
<p>The present participle of the Pr. has lost its <strong>न</strong> M. as <strong>करित,
धावत</strong>, in G. <strong>करत</strong>&lsquo;doing&rsquo;, <strong>चढत</strong> &lsquo;ascending&rsquo;, in H. as <strong>करता</strong> and in B.as <strong>करित, देखित</strong>,while the O. has preserved it as <strong>करन्त, देखन्त</strong>. The S.and P. have preserved the Śaur. form which has <strong>द</strong> instead of <strong>त</strong>and the former has preserved the nasal throughout while theIntter has dropped it after roots in <strong>अ</strong> as S. <strong>मारींदो, हलन्दो,</strong> P. <strong>लिखदा</strong>&lsquo;writing&rdquo; but <strong>जांदा</strong>&lsquo;going&rsquo;, <strong>होंदा</strong>&lsquo;becoming,&rsquo; this participle is used,as in the Pr., in the sense of Skr. Conditional, equivalent to theEnglish Pluperfect Conditional, as M. <strong>तो करता तर होतें</strong>&lsquo;if he haddone it, it would have become, G. <strong>ते करत तो थात</strong>; B. <strong>से यदि तो माकेकहित तबे तुमि विश्वास करिता ना</strong>; if he had told you, you would nothave believed;&rsquo; O.<strong>जेवेसूर्य उदय हुअन्त ते अन्धकार न रहन्ता</strong> &lsquo;if the sun</p>
<p>had arisen, the darkness would not have remained&rsquo;; H. <strong>जो मैं कहता तो मेरी बात न सुनता</strong>&lsquo;if I had told, he would not have listened to mywords;&rsquo; S. <strong>जेहू पाणिअमे न तरंदो</strong>&lsquo;if he had not been swimming&rsquo;, <strong>जे मै घल्लदा</strong> &lsquo;if I were to send.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>THE ABSOLUTIVE IN THE VERNACULARS</strong></p>
<p>The absolutive in M. is formed by adding the termination <strong>ऊन</strong>, as <strong>करून</strong>, the same as the Mahārāṣṭrī<strong>ऊण</strong>. Vararuci, you willremember, gives this termination only, but Hemacandra adds more.</p>
<p>The G. has <strong>इ</strong>, the same as the Ap. <strong>इ</strong> and Pr. <strong>इअ</strong>, Skr. <strong>य</strong>, and <strong>इने</strong>from the Ap. <strong>एप्पिणु</strong> or <strong>एप्पी</strong>, the Vedic Skr. <strong>त्वीन</strong>; or the <strong>ने</strong> of <strong>इने</strong> maybe the same as the particle <strong>ने</strong>which means &lsquo;and&rsquo; added to <strong>इ</strong>.</p>
<p>The Sindhi has <strong>इ</strong> for intransitive and reflexive roots and <strong>ए</strong> fortransitive and another <strong>इओ</strong>or <strong>यो</strong> for both, as <strong>सुणी</strong>&lsquo;having heard&rsquo;,<strong>मारे</strong> having beaten&rsquo; and <strong>सुण्यो</strong>or <strong>मायों</strong>. The first is the same asthe G., but in the <strong>ए</strong>of the transitive roots the <strong>अ</strong>of the original<strong>इअ</strong> seems to be preserved and this termination added to the rootwith the Parasm. sign <strong>इ</strong>. Thus we have first <strong>मारी</strong>and then, <strong>इअ</strong> or <strong>इय</strong>being added, we have <strong>मारीय</strong>, whereupon the <strong>य</strong> with thepreceding <strong>इ</strong> becomes <strong>ए</strong> and we have <strong>मारे</strong>. The last <strong>यो</strong> is the sameas the <strong>इउ</strong> of the Ap., traced to the infinitive, which, you willremember, is confounded with the absolutive.</p>
<p>The H. drops the <strong>इ</strong> of this form and the original root, as <strong>बोल,जा</strong> etc., is used in the sense of the Absol., but to make the sensedistinct <strong>के</strong> or <strong>कर</strong> is added, as<strong>बोलके</strong> or <strong>बोलकर, जाके</strong> or <strong>जाकर</strong>. Ofthese <strong>के</strong> is a real absolutive derived from the Śaur. <strong>किअ</strong>and <strong>कर</strong>is the same as <strong>बोल</strong>, i. e. the usual form of it. Now when one formis felt to be not distinct enough, it is usual in our languages toadd another to it of the same nature. You have instances ofthisprocess in the Pali double genitive <strong>तेसानं</strong>, and in the instr.<strong>नें</strong> and <strong>नीं</strong>of some of our vernaculars.</p>
<p>P. agrees with the H. In H., however, the <strong>इ</strong> is pronounced bya great many people. It is also found in the old posts and in theBrajabhāṣā. The absolutive always ends in this vowel as <strong>करि,मारि</strong>, though often <strong>कै</strong> the same as H.<strong>के</strong> is added, as <strong>करिकै, मारिकै</strong>, etc.</p>
<p>The O. also has <strong>इ</strong> as <strong>करि</strong>and the B. has <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>ए</strong> or <strong>इया</strong> as <strong>देखि,देखे</strong> or <strong>देखिया</strong> &lsquo;having seen&rsquo;. In the last the <strong>अ</strong> of the original <strong>इअ</strong>is preserved and longthened, and the <strong>य</strong> is ouphonic.</p>
<p><strong>THE INFINITIVE OF PURPOSE IN THE VERNACULARS</strong></p>
<p>The infinitive of purpose is preserved in M. as <strong>तो अभ्यास करूं लागला</strong> &lsquo;he began to study.&rsquo; The form in the Pr. is <strong>करिउं</strong>, but theaugment <strong>इ</strong> is lost in M. O. also has it, but its use is somewhatlike that of the Absolutive <strong>विचार करु कहिले</strong> &lsquo;considering he spoke,&rsquo; <strong>खाउ खाउ तृप्त होइला</strong> &rsquo;eating and eating he was satisfied.&rsquo; But theoriginal sense is somewhat preserved, and it is in this sensemade the basis of the present tense definite, which will be considered hereafter. This infinitive and the absolutive are, I havealready observed, confused in the Pr., and in some of the moderndialects the absolutive is used where we in Marathi use theinfinitive: as G. <strong>हुं करी सकुं छुं</strong>&lsquo;I am able to do it,&rsquo; H. <strong>मै कर सकता हुं, बानी जाको नहीं कहि सके है</strong> &lsquo;whom speech cannot express,&rsquo; Br. <strong>मै करि सकौं होंfor</strong> M. <strong>मीक करूं शकतों</strong>. For this infinitive the modernvernaculars however have got a reconstructed form which willbe mentioned in its proper place.</p>
<p><strong>THE POTENTIAL PARTICIPLE IN THE VERNACULARS</strong></p>
<p>The potential participle in Skr. <strong>तव्य,</strong> Pr. <strong>अव्व</strong>, is much used inthe modern dialects and made the base of various verbal formations. In M. we have <strong>करावें</strong> &lsquo;should be done,&rsquo; G. <strong>करदुं</strong>. S. <strong>पसिबो</strong>from <strong>पस</strong>to see, Braj <strong>करवौं</strong>, B. &amp; O. <strong>करिबा</strong>. The H. has lost it, soalso the P.</p>
<p>The Skr. verbal noun in <strong>अन</strong>appears as <strong>करणें</strong>in M., <strong>करणु</strong> S., <strong>करनौ</strong>Braj., <strong>करना</strong> H. and P., <strong>कहन</strong>O. &amp; B., but in these latter it isprobably a modern Tatsama. G. does not possess it. Theseforms are called infinitives by the Vernacular grammarians.Prof. Hornle traces them to the Skr. potential participle in <strong>अनीय</strong>;but, as before remarked, the transition from <strong>नीयं</strong>to <strong>नयं</strong> and thento <strong>नें</strong> is taken for granted; regularly <strong>नीय</strong> ought in the vernacularsto be changed to <strong>नी</strong>as in <strong>पाणी</strong>. According to the observations Imade before the <strong>एं</strong> of <strong>करणें</strong> and <strong>औं</strong> of <strong>करनौं</strong> must be due to <strong>अकम्-अअं-</strong></p>
<p><strong>अयं</strong> Pr. and <strong>अकम्-अउं</strong>Ap., as in M. <strong>केलें</strong>and G. <strong>केलुं</strong>; so that the verbalnoun in M. and H. is an augmented form of the correspondingone in Skr., while that of the Sindhi is from the unaugmentedform. A great many other verbal derivatives have come downto the vernaculars, but I must not go further.</p>
<p><strong>THE PASSIVE IN THE VERNACULARS</strong></p>
<p>The Pr. passive base in <strong>ईअ</strong>and <strong>इज्ज</strong> has been preserved onlyin P. &amp; S. Thus <strong>मारीअ</strong> &lsquo;he may be beaten&rsquo; and <strong>मारीअन</strong> &rsquo;theymay&rsquo; be beaten&rsquo; are forms of the 3rd pers. sing. and pl. of thepassive old Pres, and modern Potential; while <strong>मारीदा</strong>the presentpart. is used as a base to form various tenses. This is the Pr.form in <strong>इअ</strong> the <strong>अ</strong> being lost. Sindhi has <strong>ज</strong> as <strong>पजिणु</strong> &rsquo;to be drunk,&rsquo;<strong>घोइजणु</strong> &rsquo;to be washed,&rsquo; व sing, <strong>धोइजनि</strong> pl 3rd pers. Pres or Pot.The pres part is wanting the potential porticiple from <strong>तव्य</strong>being used instead as <strong>धोइबां</strong>. The augment <strong>इ</strong> is introduced beforethis <strong>ज</strong>where euphony requires it. Old M. possessed these formsand they are very frequently to be met with in our poets as inJñāneśvarī:</p>
<p>आतां आमुचा वलीं नायक। जे रूढ धीर सैनिक । से प्रसंगें आइक । सांगिजति ॥</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now inoidentally will be mentioned, the leaders, provedwarriors and soldiers in our army.&rsquo;</p>
<p>तयापरी तूं देवा । मज झकऊन न येसि माधवा।<br>
जरी पुण्याचा ओलावा । नाशिजैल॥</p>
<p>&ldquo;In thst msnner, O lord Mādhava, you will abandon me andwill not come to me if the moisture of virtue is dried up(IIt will be destroyed).</p>
<p>विचारीं तू अर्जुनु । कींकारुण्यें कीजसी दीनु ।<br>
सांग पां अंधकारें भानु । ग्रासिला आथी॥</p>
<p>&lsquo;Think, Arjuna, you are being msde contemptible by sorrow;say, is the sun ever swallowed up by darkness ?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here we have instsnces of the Present and Future Old Guj.had the passive :</p>
<p>जिहां पूजिजइ सालिग्राम । जिहां जपिइजे हरिनुं नाम।<br>
स्मृति पुराण मानीई गायइ । जीणि दिसि कराय जाग्य।<br>
जिहां षट्दर्शन दीजह त्याग । जिहां…वेदपुराण धर्म बुझीइ॥<br>
नव खंडे अपकीरति रही। माधवि म्लेछआणियासही॥</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where Śālīgrāma is worshipped, where the name of Hari ismuttered in meditation and Smṛtis, Purāṇas and the cows arerespected, in which country sacrifices are performed, where thereare the six philosophies, and alms are given, where Vedas,Purāṇas and duty are understood, there Mādhava for certainbrought the Mlechha and infamy rests (on his name) in the ninedivisions (of the world).&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here we have instances of the forms in जas <strong>पूजिजइ</strong> and in <strong>ई</strong>(Pr. <strong>इअ</strong>) <strong>बुझीइ</strong>; and also of the modern forms as <strong>कराय</strong> which willbe presently considered. In old H. poets we meet with suchforms now and then. Thus Tulsīdāsa :</p>
<p>महिमा आसु जान गणराऊ । प्रथम पुजियत नामप्रभाऊ ॥</p>
<p>&lsquo;The greatness of which (Rāma&rsquo;s name) the lord of theGaṇas (Gaṇapati) knows, he is first worshipped; this is theachievement of the name.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>चहियत युगल किशोर लखि । लोचन युगल अनेक ॥</strong> Behārīlāla.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Many couples of eyes are wanted to see the couple of youngpersons (Rādhāand Kṛṣṇa).</p>
<p>Hero <strong>पूजियत</strong> and <strong>चहियत</strong> are forms of the passive in <strong>ईय</strong>. Theverb <strong>चाहिये</strong> in mod. H. is also a passive forms as <strong>ज्योइये</strong>G. and<strong>पाहिजे</strong> M.</p>
<p>There are also, as in the Pr., Siddha Tadbhava forms of thepassive <strong>बुझणु</strong>S. &rsquo;to be heard,&rsquo; S. &rsquo;to be broken,&rsquo; H. &rsquo;to fleeaway,&rsquo; <strong>भुजणु</strong>S. &rsquo;to be fried,&rsquo;<strong>छिजणु</strong>S. &rsquo;to be plucked&rsquo; from pr. <strong>बुज्झ,मज्ज, भुज्ज</strong> and <strong>छिज्ज</strong>and Skr. <strong>बुध्य, भज्य, भृज्ज्य</strong> and <strong>छिद्य,पच-णें-पु-ना-णु-न</strong>from <strong>पच्च</strong> Pr., <strong>पच्य</strong> Skr. &rsquo;to be cooked&rsquo; in all, though the sense issomewhat altered. <strong>लाभणें</strong> M., <strong>लभणु</strong> S. from Pr. <strong>लब्भ</strong>,Skr. <strong>लभ्य</strong>&rsquo;to beobtained,&rsquo; <strong>बझणु</strong> S., <strong>बझना</strong> H. from Pr., <strong>बज्झ</strong>, Skr. <strong>बध्य</strong> &rsquo;to be bound;&rsquo;<strong>दिसणें-षुं-ना</strong> M, G. H. P. from Pr. <strong>दीस</strong>, Skr.<strong>दृश्य</strong> &rsquo;to be seen&rsquo; also <strong>दीखना</strong>H.; <strong>सुजणें-णुु</strong>M. S., <strong>सूजना</strong>H. P. from Pr.क<strong>ल्ल</strong>, Skr. <strong>कल्य</strong>&rsquo;to be known.&rsquo; <strong>सुचणें-वुं</strong>M. G. from <strong>मुच्च</strong> Pr., Skr. <strong>मूच्च</strong> &rsquo;to occur to one&rsquo;etc.</p>
<p><strong>THE CAUSAL IN THE VERNACULARS</strong></p>
<p>The causal is formed in M. by appending <strong>ईव</strong> or <strong>अव</strong> as <strong>करीवणें</strong>or <strong>करवणें, धावीवणें</strong>or <strong>धाववणें</strong>; you will remember, I have identified.the <strong>ई</strong> that non-reflexive transitive roots take in M. with the</p>
<p>Parasm. <strong>इ</strong>, and <strong>ए</strong> or <strong>अ</strong>of the intransitive and reflexive with theĀtm. Now when a root becomes causative, its reflexive characteris lost, all verbs become transitive, and hence we have <strong>अ</strong> or <strong>ई</strong>promiscuously used after all roots. For this reason even inSkr. all causal verbs are both Parasm. and Ātm. I do not derivethe rule about M. verbs taking <strong>अ</strong>or <strong>इ</strong> from that in Skr., butattribute it to the same causes. In the Goan. and Cit. we have<strong>अय</strong> for <strong>अव</strong>, the <strong>य</strong> being pronounced as a consonant and often likethe vowel <strong>इ</strong>, as <strong>करयणं</strong> or <strong>करइणां</strong>. In the Savantvadi and Vengurladistricts it is formed in the same way, but in the other portionsof the area over which the Mālvaṇīis spoken it is formed as inthe principal Marathi. The <strong>य</strong> stands for <strong>व</strong>; for this semi-vowelis often, by the vulgar, dropped leaving the vowel insteed, as<strong>नआ</strong> for <strong>नवा</strong> like the H. <strong>नया</strong> for <strong>नवा, नाई</strong> for <strong>नावी</strong> etc.</p>
<p>In G. the causal termination is <strong>आव</strong>as <strong>कराववुं</strong> &rsquo;to cause to do,&rsquo; <strong>तपावबुं</strong> &lsquo;make hot;&rsquo; in S. <strong>आइ</strong> as <strong>वधाइणु</strong> &rsquo;tocause increase,&rsquo; <strong>घोआइणु</strong> &rsquo;to cause wash; in P. <strong>आऊ</strong> or <strong>वाऊ</strong> as <strong>कराउना</strong> or <strong>करवाउना</strong>.</p>
<p>In H, it is <strong>आ</strong> as <strong>नचाना, पढाना</strong>, but <strong>नचावना</strong> and <strong>पढावना</strong> are alsoused;and the termination <strong>वा</strong> is invariably added to the first causalto form asecond or double causal as <strong>नचवाना, पढवाना</strong> from <strong>नचाना</strong>and <strong>पढाना</strong>. The <strong>आव</strong>occurs in first causals in poetry, as Tulsīdās:<strong>अब प्रभुचरित</strong> <strong>सुनावह मोहि</strong> &lsquo;Narrate(lit. make me hear) to me the history of the lord;&lsquo;also:—</p>
<p>यथा अनेक वेष धरि नृत्य करैनट कोइ।<br>
सोइ सोइ भाव दिखावैआपुन होइ ना सोइ॥</p>
<p>&lsquo;As an actor assuming various masks dances; so he (the lord)shows this character and that but is not himself that ( what heshows ).&rsquo;</p>
<p>The B. and O. causal is also similarly formed by adding <strong>आ</strong> as<strong>कराइ</strong> &lsquo;I cause to do,&rsquo; <strong>देखाई</strong>&lsquo;I show&rsquo; etc. Here also as in the H.,the <strong>व</strong> of <strong>आव</strong>is elided.</p>
<p>The इ of the S. <strong>आइ</strong>must be the <strong>इ</strong> which we have observed isused after transitive and non-reflexive roots in Pot., the pres. part.etc. as <strong>मारींदो</strong>.</p>
<p>Thus then the causal termination in all the languages is<strong>आव</strong> or <strong>आव</strong>, which is the same as one of the three in Pr. For, you</p>
<p>will remember, the Pr. has <strong>ए, आवे</strong>and, the <strong>ए</strong> of the latter beingdropped, there is another <strong>आव</strong>. We have also a good manyexamples in the vernaculars of the Pr. causals mentioned byHemacandra as formed by dropping all terminations and preserving the vowel changes, guns or viddhi, which roots takebefore the Skr. <strong>अय</strong>or Pr. <strong>ए</strong> Thus:—</p>

<p>I have already mentioned that the causal of some roots isformed in H. by inserting <strong>ल</strong> before the causal termination <strong>आ</strong>.G. has <strong>ड</strong> and Sindhi <strong>र</strong>for <strong>ल</strong>, <strong>खवाढवुं</strong> &rsquo;to cause to eat&rsquo; from <strong>खा</strong>to eat, <strong>देवाडवुं</strong> &rsquo;to cause to give,&rsquo; <strong>देखाडवुं</strong> &rsquo;to show&rsquo; from <strong>देख</strong>&rsquo;to see,&rsquo;<strong>धवाडवुं</strong> to cause to run,&rsquo; <strong>डिअणु</strong>&rsquo;to give,&rsquo; <strong>दिआरणु</strong>&rsquo;to cause to give,&rsquo;<strong>सिखणु-सेखारणु, बेहणु-वेहारणु</strong> &rsquo;to cause to sit.&rsquo; In these instances wehave <strong>वा</strong> or <strong>आ</strong>before <strong>ड</strong>; but in G. all these forms have <strong>आव</strong> optionally added to them when the previous <strong>आ</strong>is dropped as <strong>वचडाववुं</strong> &rsquo;to cause to run,&rsquo; <strong>खवडाववुं</strong> &rsquo;to cause to eat &rsquo;etc.; and inS. we have the causal <strong>आइ</strong>appended to <strong>र</strong> after roots ending in <strong>आ</strong>as <strong>खाराइणु</strong> &rsquo;to cause to eat,&rsquo;<strong>घाराइणु</strong> &rsquo;to cause to wound,&rsquo; <strong>धाराइणु</strong>&rsquo;to cause to suok&rsquo; or &rsquo; to suckle;&rsquo; so that the intervening <strong>आ</strong> isinterchangeable in both these languages with the causal termination and hence some way conveys the same sense. M. has atrace of these forms as <strong>भोंवणें</strong> &rsquo;to turn,&rsquo; to cause to turn,&rsquo;<strong>घावणें</strong> &lsquo;run,&rsquo; <strong>धावडणें</strong>&rsquo;to cause to run,&rsquo; <strong>भिणें-भेडावणें</strong>&rsquo;to threaten.&lsquo;Hemacandra mentions <strong>भमाडो</strong> as the causal base of <strong>भ्रम</strong> and gives<strong>वाउ</strong> in the sense of pushing which is very likely a causal form of<strong>वा</strong>. We have this <strong>घाड</strong>in the sense of sending in M.</p>
<p>We have seen that <strong>द</strong> or<strong>त</strong> is sometimes changed to <strong>ड</strong> and thenceto <strong>र</strong> or <strong>ल</strong> in the Pr. and vernaculars; whence it appears that<strong>पिलाना</strong> is a denominstive or nominal root from <strong>पिला</strong> or <strong>पिडा</strong>or <strong>पीत</strong>,by the application of the usual denominative termination <strong>आप्</strong>,which is also the causal termination. In Skr. such a denominative has the sense of doing the thing expressed by the base as <strong>पीतं करोति-पीतयति</strong>,Śaur. <strong>पीदावेदि</strong>.</p>
<p>We have a great many denominatives from past participles;first in the sense of <em>being</em> the thing expressed by the base, inwhich case the participle has simply the verbal terminationsappended to it, as <strong>लग्गइ</strong> from <strong>लग, अब्भिडइ</strong> from <strong>अभ्येत, कट्टइ</strong>from <strong>कष्ट,पल्लटइ, पल्लत्थइ</strong> from <strong>पर्यस्त</strong> etc.; and secondly in the sense of doing,when <strong>आव</strong> or <strong>आवे</strong> intervenes between the base and the terminations,as <strong>भीदावेदि</strong>in Mālatī-Mādhava, from which we have in M, <strong>भेडावणें</strong>.The forms in which we have <strong>आ</strong> before <strong>ड</strong> as <strong>देवाडवुं, खषाडषुं</strong>etc. aredenominatives from the past participles of original Pr. cauealsas <strong>दाविद</strong> or <strong>खाविद</strong>, the causal fermination <strong>आव</strong> being changed to <strong>औ</strong>and <strong>आ</strong>as in the H. in ordinary causals. In the vernaculars wehave also the first class of denominatives expressive of beinglike the thing denoted by the base, as:—</p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>We have another verbal base in M. which involves the ides ofpower and ability as <strong>करवतें</strong> &lsquo;can be done,&rsquo; <strong>बसवतें</strong>&lsquo;can be sat.&lsquo;These forms are passive when the original verb istransitive, andimpersonal when it is intransitive. In old M. <strong>प</strong>is somesimesseen for <strong>व</strong>:—</p>
<p>जरी वेदें बहुत बोलिलें। विविध भेद सचिले । तरी आपण हितआपुलें । तेंचि घेपे ॥</p>
<p>&lsquo;Even if the Veda has told much and indicated a great manydistinct things, still one should take that which is beneficialto himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>काय झणिपे स्थितप्रज्ञ ?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who should be called <strong>स्थितप्रज्ञ</strong> ?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here the sense is simply passive and does not involve thenotion of power. These forms are to be derived from the pass.of the causal, whence <strong>करवे</strong>is <strong>करव्वइ</strong>Pr. for <strong>कराप्यते</strong>,Skr. <strong>कार्यते</strong>.Power is implied on account of the forms being derived in thismanner; for, <strong>गोविन्देन कर्म कार्यते मया</strong>in Skr. means the work is causedto be done by me by Govinda; when the agent caused istaken to be the same as that who causes, the sense is the work incaused to be done by me by myself, i. e. &lsquo;I am the causer of myselfto do it i. e., &lsquo;I can do it.&rsquo; In G. this causal pass. <strong>अव्व</strong> is transformed into <strong>आ</strong>, as the causal <strong>अव</strong>so often is, and the sense is simplypassive in some cases and passive and causative in others, as<strong>आं छोकरी मूर्ख जणाय छे</strong>&rsquo; this boy is known to be &amp; fool; &rsquo; <strong>आ काम माराथीकरातुं नथी</strong> &rsquo;this work cannot be done from me. There are tracesof these forms in the other languages also, though the grammariars do not notice them, as H. <strong>एकवचन बस्तुर संख्या एक बुझाय</strong>&lsquo;By thesingulars the number of a thing is known to be one,&rsquo; <strong>वह वाक्य कहाता है</strong> &rsquo;that is called a sentence&rsquo; etc^(<strong>1</strong>).</p>
<p>Thus then you will see that we have nearly the whole of thegrammar of the Prakrits, i. e. all their grammatical forms, inour vernaculars. The cases in the forms which they assumedin the Apabhraṁśa have been preserved, some in this languageand some in that, but not all in one and the same. And alongwith them there are sometimes newly constructed forms also.The pronouns are the same as in the Pr. and the Apabhramsa. The two Prakrit tenses and one mood are preserved. All thevernaculars have the Present, though, except in the O. and B.,it has acquired another sense and another word or expression iswanted to restriot it to the signification of the present time.G. S. P. and H. have lost the Imperative, but it is preserved bythe other three languages. The Future is retained by the G. andthe Braj; while this latter possesses the solitary form of the Aoristthat the old Pr. had retained. These are the only really simpleor uncompounded verbal forms existing in our languages; therest are made up by compounding or by using Pres. participlesas bases and appending the Pres. verbal terminations, as will behereafter shown. Past time is almost universally expressed bythe past participle, and this retains the passive, in some casesthe active, character it had in Skr. and Pr. in all those languagesthat have not thoroughly lost the distinction of gender andnumber. The several other Prakrit participles are preserved andwe have no other. The passive forms are seen in Sindhi andPanjabi, the former having one set and the latter the other.The Pr. causal termination is preserved almost unchanged bythe M. and G. while in the other languages it is somewhattransformed. So that, as they are at present, our vernacularshave between them preserved all that the Prakrits had andpreserved nothing that the Prakrits lost.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1. Mr. Beames traces the vernacular causal terminations <strong>अव, इव, उ, आ</strong> etc.to the Skr. <strong>अय</strong>. But this is evidently a mistake. The Pr. &lsquo;<strong>आवे</strong> or <strong>आव</strong> hasescaped him somehow. The <strong>ल</strong> of the Hindi causal forms he alse derivesfrom the <strong>य</strong> of <strong>अय</strong>. But this <strong>य</strong> is too weak to be changed to any other letterthan the vowel <strong>ए</strong>, and <strong>य</strong> is never changed to a semi-vowel excepting inthe doubtful instance <strong>लट्टी</strong> from <strong>वाष्ट</strong>.</p>
<p>And as we ascend higher up in the history of each of theselanguages, we find in use such forms as it has now lost. All ourvernaculars must at one time have been in the condition inwhich we find the Apabhraṃśa, but the dialect of that namewhich is treated of by the grammarians, and specimens of whichwe find in the scraps of literature I have noticed, resemble the G.and the Braj and in a less degree the S. P. and the ordinary H.</p>
<p>The old literary dialect of the H. area was the Braj; and theworks of TulsĪdās, Bihārilāl, KabĪra and others are in that dialect,though these are called old Hindi poets, instead of old Braj poetsas they should be called and as they are called by natives. Inthis old Braj literature we find the Apabhraṁśaforms of thePresent tense unchanged; and from these has directly been derived the Present tense of the modern S., G., P., Braj aud H. TheApbhr. Future is found in the G, and in modern Braj and in the</p>
<p>poets in an older and less corrupt form also, though the <strong>स</strong> isohanged to <strong>ह</strong>. Such Apbhr. forms as <strong>जेम, तेम</strong>are preserved in theG.; and the neuter sing. in <strong>उं</strong> in that dialect as well as in theBraj, where it occurs especially in the verbal nouns or infinitives.The first pers. sing. <strong>हुं</strong> exists in G., old H. and a dialect of thePanjabi. The other dialects also possess, as I have observed,some Ap. peculiarities, but the four named above bear a closerconnection to it.</p>
<p>And since the Apabhraṃśa is referred by the grammarians tothe Śaurasenï type, we may regard these four modern dialects,viz the G. S. P. and H., as the representatives of the old Śaurasenī,which from the name seems to have been the dialect of thecountry about Mathurā.</p>
<p>The distinction between this and the old Mahārāṣṭrīwas, aswe have have seen, not very great and some of the peculiaritieswere such as could not last for many centuries. The change of<strong>त</strong> and <strong>थ</strong> to <strong>द</strong> and <strong>ध</strong>, for instance, instead of elision and <strong>ह</strong> is ofsuch a nature. The law of elision which operated in a greatmany other cases could not long be kept from extending itselfto <strong>त</strong>. But still we do find in the modern G. such forms as <strong>किटुं,पिटुं,खाटुं</strong>etc. for <strong>कृतम्, पीतम्</strong> snd <strong>खादितम्</strong>. This change was madein some cases in the Śaurasenīas in <strong>सउन्दला</strong>, for <strong>शकुन्तला</strong>, and inothers not, as <strong>अय्यउत्त</strong> for <strong>आर्यपुत्र</strong>. And the change of <strong>न्त</strong> to <strong>न्द</strong>and<strong>द</strong> we find in the S. and P. Present Participles. The Śaur.Future which had an intercalatory <strong>स्स</strong> instead of the Mahārāṣṭrī<strong>हि</strong> is, as we have seen, preserved in the G. and the Brai with theslight modification it underwent in the Apabhraṃśa. Then, ifwe follow Vararuci, the Śaur. Absolute termination was <strong>इअ</strong>,and in the prose speeches in the dramatic plays it is this alonethat we find. The absolutive in these four modern languagesis formed by adding this same termination with the <strong>अ</strong> dropped.</p>
<p>Now all these peculiarities are absent from the M. In theold Mahārāṣṭrīverses, occurring in the plays, as well as according to Vararuci, the absolutive termination was <strong>ऊण</strong>, which wefind in the M. alone. The past passive participle of <strong>कृ</strong> and <strong>वृ</strong> inold Mahr. was <strong>कअ</strong> and <strong>मअ,</strong> and we have these forms in the M. in<strong>केला</strong> and <strong>मेला</strong>, as we have seen, while <strong>कि</strong> instead of <strong>के, सु</strong>instead of</p>
<p><strong>मे</strong> occur in the four Śaurasenic dialects and these we find in theplays.The Pres. and Imper. of the M. have been derived fromthe Pr. and not from the Apbbr. forms. Thus then, the M. is themodern representative of the old Mahārāṣṭrī, so that it hardlyadmits of any doubt that the two old languages derived theirnames from the provinces in which they prevailed. The B. and O.have a few peculiarities of the Śaur.; and they seem to occupya middle position between M. on the one hand and the four Apbhr.or Śaur, languages on the other; while the consonantal changes,especially the reduction of all the sibilants to the palatal <strong>श</strong>, pointto their being the descendants of the oldMāgadhī.</p>
<p><strong>LECTURE VI</strong></p>
<p><strong>NEW GRAMMATICAL FORMATIONS IN THE NORTHERN<br>
VERNACULARS</strong></p>
<p>We will now proceed to consider those forms in the grammarof our languages which are not derived from correspondingSanskrit or Prakrit forms, but which have been constructed inrecent times. Such new forms owe their origin to various causes.The old ones lose their distinctive portions and become confusedby phonetic decay; or, having been in long use, lose all freshnessof meaning, and cease to be as expressive as one would wish themto be, or their sense is not exactly that which one desires toconvey. Thus the old Present and Future got confused in ourvernaculars and a new Future was wanted. The old Present itselfacquired a potential sense in some cases and a past habitual sensein others, whence for the expression of present time anotherset of forms was required.</p>
<p>In Sanskrit itself such a phrase as <strong>द्विजाय यवागूः</strong>&lsquo;gruel for aBrahman&rsquo; is not so expressive as <strong>द्विजार्था यवागूः</strong> &lsquo;gruel for aBrahman&rsquo;s purpose&rsquo;; which again is analysed into its separateelements for greater distinctness into <strong>द्विजस्यार्थे यवागूः</strong>&lsquo;gruel forthe purpose of a Brahman&rsquo;.</p>
<p>When different words so brought together are kept distinctand consciously used, there is no growth of new forms. But if byfrequent use and the oblivion of etymology such an expressionas <strong>स्यार्थे</strong>comes to be looked upon as an independent word meaning&quot;for the sake of&rdquo; and applied promiscuously to all nouns,including such as could not originally by the usage of Sanskrithave it, as in <strong>भ्रातृस्यार्थे</strong>, it becomes a termination, and a new caseform grows up and the old one often goes out of use. Then againphonetic decay sets in and by reducing this expression to <strong>स्सठ्ठे</strong>and ultimately to <strong>साठे</strong> ( M. <strong>साठीं</strong> the original word being <strong>सट्ठम्मि</strong>),irrevocably stamps it with the character of a case terminationhaving no meaning by itself. Lastly, if one wishes to say of abook that it belongs to <em>him</em> and looks upon it as possessing thatattribute and subordinates <em>him</em> to it, the expression <strong>तस्य पुस्तकम्</strong></p>
<p>will not serve his purpose, but he must have some such as <strong>तदीयंपुस्तकम्</strong>. And if this way of looking at things becomes general, <strong>तदीय</strong>supersedes <strong>तस्य</strong>. In this way our new forms have grown up.</p>
<p><strong>THE OBLIQUE FORMS</strong></p>
<p>The case terminations are, in the majority of the languages,applied not to the original noun itself but to a certain modifiedform of it called the oblique form, or by the native Marathigrammarians the Sāmānya-rūpa or the common form, because it is used in all the cases.</p>
<p><strong>THE OBLIQUE FORM IN THE MARATHI</strong></p>
<p>There are two Sāmānya-rūpas for the two numbers. In theold languages plurality is expressed by independent terminations,but the new terminations of the modern languages being the samefor both numbers, plurality is denoted by a distinctive obliqueform. Some of the modern languages that have no Sāmānya-rūpa have recourse to a novel way of expressing plurality. Ofall the vernaculars it is the Marathi that is the most particularin the formation of the oblique and has minute rules. Sindhicomes next, then the Hindi and the Panjabi; after these theGujarati, and lastly the Bengali and the Oriya; which may besaid to have no oblique form at all.</p>
<p>The Marathi oblique forms are made up by adding theseterminations :—</p>

<p>All neuter nouns in <strong>ईं</strong>as <strong>मोतीं-मोत्या-मोत्यास-मोत्यांस</strong>.</p>
<p>(d) Some Masc. and nearly all neuter nouns in <strong>ऊ</strong>. Some ofthese change <strong>ऊ</strong> to <strong>वा</strong>, and others drop it, since it is the<strong>ऊ</strong> of the nom. sing. Apbhr., as <strong>भाऊ</strong> &lsquo;a brother&rsquo;; – – <strong>भावा</strong> obl.,sing. &rsquo;to a brother&rsquo;, <strong>भावांस</strong>pl. &rsquo;to brothers&rsquo;; <strong>वाटसरू</strong>&rsquo;travellor&rsquo;, वा<strong>टसरा</strong> obl., <strong>वाटसरास</strong> sing., <strong>वाटसरांस</strong> pl.; <strong>गलूं-गलवा-गलवास</strong>sing., <strong>गलवांस</strong> pl. <strong>लेकरूं-लेकरा-लेकरास</strong> sing., <strong>लेकरांस</strong> pl.Some nouns of this class take <strong>आ</strong>optionally as <strong>विंचू-विंच्वा-विंध्वास</strong>sing., <strong>विच्वांस</strong> pl.</p>

The usagein several cases is still unsettled as regards some of these forms.You will observe that there is an anusvāra in the pl. of all forms.Another fact should also be borne in mind that nouns in <strong>ई</strong> and <strong>ऊ</strong>often take the <strong>आ-आं</strong>or <strong>ए-आं</strong>forms though these properly belongto nouns in <strong>अ</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>THE OBLIQUE FORM IN SINDHI</strong></p>
<p>(1) The following classes of nouns take <strong>अ</strong> for the obl. sing.and <strong>आं, एं</strong> and <strong>अनि</strong>for the pl.:—</p>
<p>(a) Masc. nouns, the nom. sing. of which ends in <strong>उ</strong>, as<strong>देहु</strong> &lsquo;a country&rsquo;, <strong>देह-देहनि</strong> obl., <strong>देहजो</strong> sing. &lsquo;of a country&rsquo;, <strong>देहनिजो</strong>pl. &lsquo;of countries&rsquo;, also <strong>देहां-देहें-जो</strong>.</p>
<p>(b) Masc. nouns in <strong>ओ</strong>, which,however, combine the finaland the termination into <strong>ए</strong>as in the Cit. Mar. as <strong>वाढो</strong>&lsquo;acarpenter&rsquo;, obl. <strong>वाढे</strong>sing., <strong>बाढनि, वाढां</strong>and <strong>वाढें</strong>pl.</p>
<p>(2) The following nouns take <strong>अ</strong>for the obl. sing. and <strong>नि, अनि</strong>and <strong>उनि</strong> for the pl. in addition to <strong>आं</strong> and <strong>एं</strong> :—</p>
<p>(a) Maso, nouns in <strong>ई</strong> as <strong>हारी</strong> &lsquo;a peasant&rsquo;, <strong>हारिअ</strong> or <strong>हारिआं</strong> sing.,<strong>हार्यें, हारिएं, हार्या, हारिनि, हार्यनि</strong> and <strong>हार्युनि</strong> pl.</p>

<p>(3) Nouns in short <strong>इ</strong> have no separate form for the sing. ofthe obl., the nom. form being used; the pl. they form like theabove class, as <strong>गाल्हि</strong>f. &lsquo;a story&rsquo;, obl. <strong>गाल्हि</strong>sing., <strong>गाल्हिआं</strong>, <strong>गाल्हिएं, गाल्हिअनि, गाल्हिउनि</strong>and <strong>गाल्हिनि</strong>pl. Masc. nouns in <strong>इ</strong>, however, donot take the forms in <strong>अनि</strong>and <strong>उनि</strong>; as <strong>केहरि</strong> &lsquo;a lion&rsquo; sing., <strong>केहरिनि-आं-एं</strong>pl.</p>
<p>(4) Fem, nouns in <strong>अ, आ</strong>and <strong>उ</strong> have no separate form for thesing, while in the pl. they take as a &lsquo;wish&rsquo;, obl. <strong>सध</strong>sing., <strong>सधुनि</strong>pl.; <strong>हचा</strong>&lsquo;a murder&rsquo;, obl. <strong>हचा</strong>sing., <strong>हचाउनि</strong> pl.; <strong>विजु</strong>&rsquo;lightning&rsquo;, obl.<strong>विजु</strong> sing.,<strong>विजुनि</strong>pl. The first has <strong>सधां</strong>and <strong>सधें</strong>also for the pl. Herethere is one type for one class of nouns and not two, as is the casesometimes in the M. The form in <strong>उनि</strong>is taken by all femininenouns in <strong>अ, आ</strong> and <strong>ई</strong>and also masc. nouns in <strong>ई</strong>. Masc. nouns in <strong>ऊ</strong>and fem. nouns in <strong>उ</strong> have <strong>उ</strong> in the original base itself and it doesnot belong to the termination.</p>
<p><strong>THE OBLIQUE FORM IN PANJABI</strong></p>
<p>The Panjabi has the termination <strong>ए</strong> for the sing. obl. of nounsending in <strong>आ</strong>. The sing. of all other nouns has no special formwhile <strong>आ</strong> is appended to all nouns to form the obl. pl., beforewhich the final <strong>आ</strong>of nouns preceded by a consonant is changedto <strong>इ</strong>, as <strong>घोडा</strong> &lsquo;a horse,&rsquo; obl. sing. and <strong>घोडिआं</strong>pl. Final <strong>उ</strong>preceded by a vowel combines with this <strong>आं</strong>to form <strong>वां</strong>, as <strong>पिष्ठ</strong>or <strong>पेउ</strong> &lsquo;father,&rsquo; <strong>पेवां</strong>obl. pl.; and final <strong>अ</strong>forms <strong>आं</strong> as व &lsquo;man&rsquo;, <strong>मनुखां</strong>obl. pl. There are no other changes.</p>
<p><strong>THE OBLIQUE FORM IN HINDI</strong></p>
<p>The Hindi, like the Panjabi, has an oblique sing. for nounsin <strong>आ</strong>only. It ends in <strong>ए</strong>, as that of the S. and Cit. M. nouns in<strong>ओ</strong>, Karh. M. and P. noubs in <strong>आ</strong> as; <strong>घोडे-घोडेका</strong>.The pl. obl. ofall nouns whatever is formed by adding <strong>ओं</strong> which amalgamateswith the preceding <strong>अ</strong> of all nouns and the <strong>आ</strong>of such as aremasculine, and combines with <strong>इ</strong> to form <strong>इयों</strong>; as <strong>गांव</strong>&lsquo;a village.&rsquo;<strong>गांवोंका</strong> pl. &lsquo;of villages&rsquo;; <strong>घोडा</strong>&lsquo;a horse&rsquo;, <strong>घोडोंका</strong>pl. &lsquo;of horses&rsquo;;<strong>पति</strong>&lsquo;a master&rsquo;, <strong>पतियोंका</strong>pl. &lsquo;of masters.&rsquo; In other cases it is simplyadded to the noun as <strong>भांलू</strong> &lsquo;a jackal,&rsquo; <strong>भालुओंका</strong> pl. &lsquo;of jackals&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In the Brajbhāṣāand in the old poets the obl. pl. of all nounshas <strong>न</strong> or <strong>नि</strong> instead of <strong>ओं</strong>, as <strong>संत</strong>&lsquo;a good man&rsquo; <strong>संतनका</strong>pl. &lsquo;of good men&rsquo;.This termination is also added to the nom. sing, to form the nom.pl. of those nouns that have no distinctive form for it; as <strong>लोग</strong>&lsquo;people&rsquo; sing. <strong>लोगन</strong> pl.; <strong>भगत</strong> &lsquo;devotee&rsquo;, <strong>भगतन</strong> pl. ( <strong>चहुजुग भगतन बांधलवाटी</strong>— Kabīr).</p>
<p><strong>THE OBLIQUE FORM IN GUJARATI</strong></p>
<p>In G. the obl. form of masc. and neuter nouns ending in <strong>ओ</strong>and <strong>उं</strong> is formed by substituting <strong>आ</strong> for those vowels. The latter</p>
<p>take an anusvära in the pl., and the forms of the former for bothnumbers are alike as <strong>घोडो-घोडा-घोडाने</strong> sing.and pl. &rsquo;to a horse orhorses&rsquo;; <strong>केलुं</strong> &lsquo;a plantain&rsquo;, <strong>केला-केलाने</strong> sing &rsquo;to a plantain&rsquo;, <strong>केलानें</strong>pl.&rsquo;to plantains.&rsquo; But the nom. pl. forms of these are <strong>घोडा</strong>and <strong>केलां</strong>,whence it appears that in the pl. the obl. cases are formed simplyadding the terminations to the nom. pl. and there is no such thingas a common oblique form. And this is the case with the sing, aswell as the pl. of all other nouns; as <strong>माणस</strong>&lsquo;a man&rsquo; nom. sing.,<strong>माणसो</strong> nom. pl <strong>माणसने</strong> sing., <strong>माणसोनें</strong> pl. The plural termination is<strong>ओ</strong> and is thus used in all cases. It is added in these days evento the final <strong>आ</strong> and <strong>आं</strong>of nouns in <strong>ओ</strong>and <strong>उं</strong> to distinguish the pl.forms from the sing. as <strong>घोडा</strong> or <strong>घोडाओ</strong> nom. pl, <strong>घोडाने</strong> or <strong>घोडाओने</strong>dat. pl. But the practice has not yet established itself andmostly the forms without <strong>ओ</strong>are used. Masc. and neut. nounsending in <strong>ओ</strong>or <strong>उं</strong> are often used in the pl. without it in suchinstances as <strong>तिहा घणा माणस छे</strong>in the nom. and other cases.And this is the usual practice in old G. literature; as <strong>लोकना पुत्रना विवाह होईछी</strong>(Panch.): &lsquo;The marriages of the sons of other people areperformed;&rsquo; <strong>सर्व शास्त्रनो परिचय छे</strong>&lsquo;he has a knowledge of all theŚāstraa&rsquo;.</p>

<p>&lsquo;All the Brahmans of Kaliyuga will be without virtue. Theywill build their homes there. The work Svargārohaṇa wascomposed in which there is the way of all virtues.&rsquo;</p>
<p>अनेक पंखी करे पोकार। गिरिजंगल बहु डुंगरा बली वांदरना ठाठ</p>
<p>Kāvyadohans, Tulasī.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Many birds raise a noise. There are mountains, forestsmany hills; over these is a crowd of monkeys.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The <strong>ओ</strong> however is seen in fem. nouns ending in <strong>ई</strong>:—</p>
<p>समुद्र गांमनी नदीयोसे इसे तेमांधी जल सुकीजसे ॥</p>
<p>Svargārohaṇa.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The water of the sea and of the rivers on land (in villages)will be dried up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>मोठा पर्षत नदियोजैह । तेह तणी नहि लाधेछेह॥</p>
<p>Kāvyadohaṇa, Tulasī.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is no end of great mountains and rivers that exist.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It therefore appears that in masc. and neut. nouns the <strong>ओ</strong>is amodern innovation and that there was no distinction between thesing. and pl. cases except the nom. of nouns in <strong>ओ</strong> and <strong>उं</strong>. Thetrue explanation therefore of the modern <strong>ओ</strong>of the pl. is that fem.nouns in <strong>आ</strong>and <strong>ई</strong> preserved this termination, since they had it inthe Prakrits, as the minor M. dialects have done, and, the sing.and pl. forms of mase. nouns being alike, the fem. <strong>ओ</strong> was transferred to them afterwards to distinguish the pl. as is now beingdone to nouns in <strong>ओ</strong> and <strong>उं</strong>. Thus then the G. noun may be said to have no real Sāmānya-rūpa or oblique form. Adjectives in <strong>ओ</strong>however have a form ending in <strong>ए</strong> when they are used to qualify asubstantive in the instr. or old loc, case in <strong>ए</strong> as <strong>आ काम सारे माणसे कीधुं</strong> &rsquo;this thing was done by a good man&rsquo;, <strong>तलावने काटे छोकरा गिया</strong>&lsquo;boys went to the margin of a tank&rsquo;, but this may be explainedas a remnant of the old agreement between the noun and itsadjective and <strong>सारे</strong>may be regarded as an instr. form and <strong>तलावने</strong>a locative.</p>
<p><strong>ABSENCE OF THE OBLIQUE FORM IN BENGALI AND ORIYA</strong></p>
<p>The Bengali and Oriya apply the case terminations directly tothe nom. and there is no oblique form. The new terminationsbeing, as in all the modern languages, the same for both numbersand there being no oblique form to express the distinctionbetween them as in M. S. H. etc., these languages, like the Guj.,were under the necessity of deriving some expression for denotingplurality. The G. found its fem. <strong>ओ</strong>and employed it for thispurpose, but the B. and O. had no such distinctively pl.termination left to fall back upon and so they have recourse tothe use of a word signifying collection such as <strong>दिग</strong> originally&rsquo;direction, row, line&rsquo;, <strong>गण, समूह</strong>and <strong>सकल</strong> etc., after the noun, theplurality of which is to be expressed. Thus <strong>राजा</strong> &lsquo;a king&rsquo;, <strong>राजार</strong>&lsquo;of a king&rsquo;, <strong>राजादिगेर</strong>&lsquo;of kings&rsquo; lit. &lsquo;of the direction row or line of a</p>
<p>king.&rsquo; Sometimes the word <strong>दिग</strong>is attached to the gen. sing. as<strong>राजारदिगेर</strong> to express the gen relation between the <strong>राजा</strong> and <strong>दिग</strong>,which is understood in the first expression. To nouns denoting inferior animals <strong>समूह</strong> and such words are appended and suchothers as <strong>सकल</strong> to those signifying inanimate creatures as <strong>कुक्कुरेर</strong>of a dog&rsquo; <strong>कुक्कुरसमुहेर</strong>&lsquo;of dogs.&lsquo;The Oriya sign of the plural is<strong>मान</strong> for rational and animate creatures and <strong>सकल समस्त</strong> etc. forirrational or inanimate, as <strong>पुशु</strong> &lsquo;abeast&rsquo;, <strong>पुशुर</strong>sing. &lsquo;of a beast&rsquo;,<strong>पुशुमानकर</strong> &lsquo;of beasts.&lsquo;The B. adds <strong>रा</strong> to the nom, sing. of names ofrational creatures to form the nom. pl., while <strong>समूह, सकल</strong>, etc. areapplied to the rest, as <strong>राजा</strong>&lsquo;a king&rsquo;. &lsquo;kings&rsquo;, <strong>राजारा</strong> &lsquo;kings&rsquo;; <strong>कुक्कुर</strong> &lsquo;adog&rsquo;,<strong>कुक्कुरसमूह</strong>&lsquo;dogs&rsquo;. The O. adds <strong>ए</strong> to <strong>मान</strong>to form the nom. pl. as<strong>पशुमाने</strong>.This is the same as that of <strong>घोडे</strong>in M. and H.</p>
<p><strong>THE NATURE OF THE OBLIQUE FORM</strong></p>
<p>Now the question is what is the nature of this Sāmānya-rūpaor oblique form, why does a noun undergo a certain modificationbefore it becomes fit to receive the termination and what is thesignification of the modified form and of the nasal that appearsin the plural. Let us see how we, at the present day, join certainwords expressive of relation such as <strong>संनिध</strong>or <strong>पार्शी</strong> with &amp; noun.We say <strong>त्याच्या</strong> <strong>सैनिध</strong> or <strong>त्याच्या पार्शी</strong> i. e. put the noun into the gen.case. Now this <strong>त्याच्यापाशीं</strong> is convertible with <strong>त्याजपाशीं</strong>, inwhich <strong>त्याज</strong>is the oblique form of <strong>तो</strong>the demonstrative.Similarly we append even some of the case terminations tothe gen as <strong>माझ्यानें काम करवत नाहीं</strong> I cannot do the work; <strong>त्याच्यांतकांहीं पाणी नाहीं</strong>&rsquo;there is no spirit (lit. water) in him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>May the Sāmānyarüpa then be an original genitive? The gen.is used in the Prakrits and even in Pali, not only with independentwords, but is made the base of some cases also, as we have seen,and the case terminations attached to it; thus <strong>ममं</strong>is acc. sing. of<strong>अहम्</strong> &lsquo;I&rsquo; in the Pali and the Pr., <strong>ममाई</strong> instr, <strong>ममादो, ममाहि</strong> abl.,<strong>ममम्मि</strong>loc. in the latter, in which instances the usual terminations ofthose cases are added to the original gen. form <strong>मम</strong>. We findeverywhere in the history of our languages that after a time theterminations in some cases come to have an independent senseand then they are detached from the original base and used like</p>
<p>ordinary post-positions. Thus, before the loc. <strong>म्मि</strong> was appendedto <strong>मम</strong>, it must have acquired some such sense as &lsquo;in the interiorof&rsquo; and that the whole expression <strong>ममम्मि</strong>might mean in theinterior of me&rsquo;. Similarly in the Apabhraṁśa, some of the postpositions which came into use and which, as I shall hereaftershow, have grown into our case terminations are used with thegen. of the noun to which they are attached.Thus:—<strong>हउंझिज्जउंतउ केहिं पिअ तुहुंपुणु अन्नह रेसि</strong> &lsquo;I pine sway for thee, ohbeloved, but thou for another&rsquo;, in which we have the postposition<strong>केहिं</strong> and <strong>रेसि</strong> having the sense of &lsquo;for&rsquo; used with the genitives <strong>तउं</strong>&rsquo;thy&rsquo; and <strong>अन्नह</strong>&lsquo;of another.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>ANALYSIS OF THE MARATHI OBLIQUE FORM</strong></p>
<p>And if we examine the oblique forms themselves, we shall findthat that they are derived from the Apbhr. and Pr. genitives.Thus the form in <strong>आ</strong> sing, and <strong>आं</strong> pl. which nouns in <strong>अ, आ</strong>etc.take is derived from the Apbhr. <strong>ह</strong> sing. and <strong>हं</strong> or <strong>अं</strong> pl. derivedfrom Pr. <strong>स</strong> and <strong>णं</strong>. The grammarians give the Apbhr. sing.termination as <strong>हो</strong>, but <strong>ह</strong> is also found, as in <strong>अन्नह</strong> in the abovequotation, and in the following occuring in an old work:—</p>
<p>कान्द्र तणइसंपत्ति इसी । जिसी इंद्रह घरि रिद्धि ॥</p>
<p>&lsquo;The wealth of Kanha was like the affluence in the house ofIndra&rsquo; where <strong>इंद्रह</strong> is gen. sing. The <strong>ह</strong> of <strong>इत्थह</strong>, for instance, isreduced to <strong>अ</strong>, the aspirate being lost, as is often the case in thevernaculars, and we have <strong>हत्था</strong>or <strong>हाता</strong>. Similarly <strong>अं</strong>of the pl.combines with the preceding <strong>अ</strong>into <strong>आं</strong>and we have <strong>हातां</strong>.</p>
<p>The second form <strong>ई</strong> and <strong>ईं</strong> is derived from the gen. of nouns in<strong>इ</strong> or <strong>ई</strong> masc. or fem. Thus <strong>केलीइ</strong> is the Pr. gen. sing. from whichwe have <strong>केली</strong>the sing. obl., and <strong>केलिणं</strong>pl., the <strong>णं</strong> of which isreduced to <strong>अं</strong> as in the other case, and we have <strong>केलीअं, -अ</strong>, as provedin the last lecture, generally goes out in the vernaculars, after along vowel even when medial, and after a short dissimilar vowelwhen final, and hence we have ff the obl. pl. Or the sing. <strong>ई</strong>may be derived from another fem, gen. termination अ or the masc.<strong>अ</strong> for <strong>ह</strong>, which, before the preceding short <strong>इ</strong>, goes out since it isfinal, as <strong>कविह-कविअ-कवी</strong>.</p>
<p>The fourth form <strong>उ</strong>and <strong>ऊ</strong> is similarly derived from masc. andfem. nouns in <strong>ऊ</strong>or <strong>ऊ</strong>; as <strong>साहुस्स-साहुइ-साहुअ-साहू</strong> obl. M., thoughwe have not this word in this form in M. where it is <strong>श्वश्रू-सरसू सस्सुअ</strong>gen <strong>सामू</strong>, obl. sing. M.; <strong>सस्मूणं-सस्मूअं-सामूं</strong> obl.pl. M.</p>
<p>The fifth form in <strong>ए</strong> sing, and <strong>आं</strong>pl. is from fem. nouns in <strong>आ</strong>;Pr. <strong>जिब्भाइ</strong> or <strong>जिब्भाए-जिभे</strong>M. obl. sing. and <strong>जिम्भाणं-जिब्भाअं-जिभां</strong>M.obl. pl.</p>
<p>The third form <strong>ई</strong> sing. and <strong>आं</strong>pl. is a mixture of the secondand the fifth and the nouns that take it form their oblique onthe type of the fifth in the Goan. and Māl.</p>
<p><strong>ANALYSIS OF THE SINDHI OBLIQUE FORMS</strong></p>
<p>The Sindhi in its <strong>अ</strong>of the sing. of its first and second forms,shortens the <strong>आ</strong>of the M., i. e. the two <strong>अ</strong> form one strong <strong>अ</strong>; whilein its third or fourth, it either dispenses with the special obliqueor this is the same as the nom., as in the case of the M. <strong>इत्ति, भुई, सामू</strong>etc. The Sindhi plural oblique has one form <strong>आं</strong>, like thecorresponding M. <strong>एं</strong>, which appears to be from the Apbhr. <strong>हें</strong> of thegen. pl. of nouns in short <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>उ</strong> given by Kramādīśvara and therest presents the gen. <strong>न</strong> in an uncorrupted form. Of these <strong>उनि</strong>which all fem. nouns and one set of masc, nouns take appears tobe a combination of the fem. nom. pl. <strong>उ</strong> and the gen. <strong>नि</strong>; i. e. tothe nom. pl. of these nouns the obl. was added instead of tothe original base.</p>
<p><strong>THE HINDI AND THE PUNJABI OBLIQUE FORMS</strong></p>
<p>The P. pl. <strong>आं</strong>is the same as the M. and the H. <strong>ओं</strong>is fromthe Apbhr. <strong>हुं</strong>of nouns in <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>उ</strong>. Or it may be explained as acombination of the fem. <strong>ओं</strong>with the nasal of the gen, as theSindhi <strong>उनि</strong>is.</p>
<p>The Braj <strong>न</strong> also presents the gen. termination in an unchangedform.</p>
<p>This then is the way in which the oblique forms are derived,but as usual the law of false analogy and simplication has beenin operation even here and thus while the M. represents them ina pristine condition, the Sindhi has reduced them to fewer typesand the P. and H. and perhaps the G. to one and the B. and O.have dropped them altogether.</p>
<p>It now remains to show why nouns with various endingsinflect the obl. in M. and S. according to the same type. I havealready shown that the oblique terminations <strong>आ</strong> and <strong>आं</strong> properlybelong to nouns in <strong>अ</strong>. Sindhi mase. nouns in <strong>उ</strong> are, as observed on a former occasion, really nouns in <strong>अ, उ</strong>being the nom. singtermination, whence they take in the sing, <strong>आ</strong>shortened to <strong>अ</strong>.Nouns in <strong>आ</strong> Mar, and P. and in <strong>ओ</strong>S. also form their obliqueaccording to this type. But the sing, base ends in <strong>या</strong>or <strong>ए</strong> in M.and <strong>ए</strong> in others. These nouns, as shown in the last but onelecture, were originally nouns augmented by the addition of <strong>क</strong>.Thus Skr. <strong>घोटक</strong> isPr. <strong>घोडअ</strong> or <strong>घोडय</strong>, since <strong>अ</strong> is pronounced <strong>य</strong>, andwith <strong>ह</strong> or <strong>अ</strong> the gen. termination becomes <strong>घोडय + अ = घोडया</strong>, whichby hasty pronunciation becomes <strong>घोड्या</strong>; but in the older M. poetswe find <strong>घोडया</strong>also. Now in the state of <strong>घोडय</strong>it may become, asI have once stated, <strong>घोडे</strong>, is <strong>कयल</strong>for <strong>कदल</strong> becomes <strong>केल</strong> or <strong>केल</strong>, andafter a long vowel the following <strong>अ</strong> is elided, whence we havethe form of the M. dialects and S. and P. and H. Similarly wehave the plural <strong>घोड्यां</strong>.</p>
<p>Neuter nouns in <strong>एं</strong> are also nouns with a final <strong>क</strong>, as has beenshown, hence their oblique is like that of the Masc. nouns in <strong>आ.कदलकम्-कयलअं-केलें</strong> and <strong>केलय + अ</strong> of the gen. <strong>= केलया-केल्या</strong>.Similarly <strong>सोनें = सुवण्णअ =सुवर्णक</strong> etc.</p>
<p>Masc. nouns in <strong>ई</strong> also take this form. If they do so, theymust be nouns in <strong>अ</strong> originally and as a matter of fact we dofind some of them at least to be so. Thus <strong>न्हावी</strong> is <strong>न्हाविअ</strong> Pr., <strong>नापित</strong>Sk wherefore we have <strong>न्हाविज + आ = न्हाव्या; ताम्बोलिक</strong> is Pr.<strong>तम्बोलिभ</strong> and with the gen. <strong>ह</strong> or <strong>अ</strong> the obl.<strong>ताम्बोल्या; वाणिज</strong> Pr, <strong>वाणिअ</strong>and with for our obl. etc. Similarly is , wherewith gen. <strong>अ</strong>we have M. <strong>मोत्या पाणी</strong> is <strong>पानीअ</strong> and thence <strong>पाण्या</strong>.S. <strong>हारी</strong> is Skr. <strong>हालिक</strong>, Pr. <strong>हालिअ</strong>which is the S. obl. form, since theeffect of two <strong>अ</strong>coming together is in this language to preventthe usual elision and form one strong <strong>अ</strong>.</p>
<p>We thus see that most Mar. and S, masc. nouns in <strong>ई</strong> and M. neuternouns <strong>ई</strong> are derived from Pr. nouns having a final <strong>म</strong>representingSkr. <strong>क</strong> or any other syllable. In the same way Skr. <strong>लडुक</strong>is Pr.<strong>लडुभ</strong> thence <strong>लाडुअ</strong>and with the gen, <strong>अ</strong> for <strong>ह लाडवा</strong> the M. obl.;so also M. <strong>भाउ</strong>must be Pr. <strong>भाउअ</strong>., Skr. <strong>भ्रातृक</strong>; M. <strong>नातु</strong>, Pr. <strong>नत्तुभ</strong>,</p>
<p>Skr. <strong>नप्तृक</strong>, in order that with the gen. <strong>अ</strong> they may yield. <strong>भावा</strong>or<strong>नातवा</strong> Neuter <strong>गलुं</strong>is <strong>गडुअ</strong>, Skr. <strong>गडुक</strong> and hence by the combinationof <strong>गहुअ + अ</strong> we have <strong>गडवा</strong>or <strong>गलवा</strong>. S<strong>माण्हू</strong> must have been <strong>मानुह</strong>from <strong>मानुष</strong>and the aspiration being transferred to <strong>न</strong> we have<strong>माण्हुअ</strong>which is the obl. form. Thus then those M. and S. masc.nouns in <strong>उ</strong> and M. neuter nouns in <strong>ऊं</strong> which take this obliqueform were Pr. nouns in <strong>अ</strong>representing a Skr. syllable ending in<strong>व</strong>, mostly <strong>क</strong>. Now these vernacular nouns in <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>ई</strong>and <strong>व</strong> or <strong>ऊ</strong>which in Skr. bave not a syllable like <strong>त</strong>or <strong>क</strong> at the end musthave the <strong>क</strong> attached to them in the Pr. and Apbhr., as we haveseen it was, to nouns in <strong>अ</strong> which on that account have becomenouns in <strong>ओ</strong>or <strong>आ</strong>in the modern languages.</p>
<p>Those fem. nouns in <strong>अ</strong> that have <strong>ई</strong> or <strong>ईं</strong> for their Sāmānyarūpaterminations must be Skr, and Pr. nouns in <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>ई</strong>as they are ass matter of fact; as <strong>केल</strong> is Pr. <strong>केली</strong> or <strong>कयली</strong>, Skr <strong>कदली भिंत</strong> is Pr.and Skr, <strong>भित्ति</strong>; <strong>पारध,<strong>Skr. <strong>पापर्द्धि</strong>, Pr. <strong>पारधी;बहिण</strong>, Skr. <strong>भगिनी</strong>, Pr. <strong>बहिणी;वांव</strong>, Skr. <strong>वापी</strong>, Pr. <strong>बावी</strong>, and a good many modern Tadbhavassuch as <strong>रीत, गत, विभूत</strong> from <strong>रीति, गति, विभूति</strong> etc. others that end in</strong>ई</strong> and take these terminations were also originally nouns in <strong>इ</strong>or <strong>ई</strong> as <strong>भुई</strong>, Skr. <strong>भूमि</strong> and others. Some masc. nouns in <strong>ई</strong> whichform their obl, in this way must also be derived from corresponding nouns in <strong>ई</strong>, as <strong>इत्ती</strong>is from the Skr. and Pr. Nom. sing. <strong>इत्ती</strong>.And modern Tatsamas in <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>ई</strong> of course can only take thisform. Similarly those nouns that form their oblique by taking<strong>ऊ</strong> and <strong>ऊं</strong>must be originally nouns in <strong>उ</strong> or <strong>ऊ</strong>. Modern Tatsamasending in these vowels also take these forms.</p>
<p>The fifth form has already been traced to the Pr. gen. of fem.nouns in <strong>आ</strong>, whence those nouns that take the form in M. musthave been originally nouns ending in that vowel. Thus <strong>जीभ</strong>,Pr. <strong>जिग्मा</strong>, Skr. <strong>जिह्वा भाक</strong>-Skr. <strong>भाषा</strong> ( mod. Tad. ); <strong>माल-माला-माला; भीक–भिक्खा-भिक्षा;नीज</strong> or<strong>नीद-निद्वा-निद्रा; सांज-संज्झा-संध्या; सेज-सेज्जा-शय्या</strong> etc.All modern fem. Tatsamas in rare inflected in this way. From the fact that fem. nouns in <strong>ई</strong> take <strong>आं</strong> forthe pl. obl. it would appear that they were originally nouns in <strong>आ</strong>.<strong>घोडी</strong> we know must have been Skr. <strong>व</strong> since the masc. is <strong>घोटक</strong>.Its gen. pl. in Pr, therefore was <strong>घोडिआअं</strong>, whence we have <strong>घोड्यां</strong>,but the sing. obl. <strong>घोडी</strong>which is the same as the nominative is not</p>
<p>formed, as it should be, according to our theory. But, as observedbefore, the Goan and Māl. have faithfully preserved the oldtradition here though the ordinary M. has lost it and in thisinstance applies the case terminations to the Nom. and not tospecial obl. form as the other languages do to a much greaterextent. The Goan, and Māl. Sāmānyarūpaof <strong>घोडी</strong>is <strong>घोड्ये</strong> fromPr. gen. <strong>घोडिआइ</strong>, the last two vowels combining into <strong>ए</strong> and the <strong>इ</strong>and <strong>ए</strong> into <strong>ये</strong>. Other instances are <strong>साडी</strong>, Skr. <strong>शाटिका, बाडी-वाटिका,नली-नलिफा, कली कलिका, माशी-मक्षिका, माती-मृतिका, मुदी-मुद्रिका,</strong> the sing. obl of which in the Goan. and Māl. are , <strong>साड्ये, वाड्ये, नल्ये</strong>etc.Similarly those fem. nouns that take this type of the obl. musthave been nouns in आrepresenting such a syllable as <strong>का</strong>.Thus M. <strong>बालू</strong> is Pr. <strong>बालुआ</strong>, Skr <strong>बालुका</strong>, and <strong>बालुआ</strong> with the <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>ए</strong>of the Gen. sing. is <strong>वालवे</strong>and with <strong>आं</strong>of the pl. <strong>वालवांस</strong>; also <strong>जलू-जलोआ</strong>or <strong>जलुआ-जलौका; ऊ</strong> a louse Skr. <strong>यूका, सासू-श्वश्रुका</strong>. The lastand also <strong>वालू</strong>have also the obl. form in <strong>ऊ</strong> and <strong>ऊं</strong>. Several othernouns also, masc, and fem, endingin <strong>ई</strong>and <strong>ऊ</strong>, have the <strong>ई</strong>and <strong>ऊ</strong>form of the obl. as well as the <strong>आ</strong>or <strong>ए</strong>and <strong>आं</strong>form. This arises fromthe practice of adding <strong>क</strong> or <strong>का</strong>optionally in the Pr. just as thereare some nouns which, as we have seen, end both in <strong>अ</strong>and <strong>आ</strong>.</p>
<p>In this way the several types of the M. sāmānyarūpa arosefrom different sets of Pr. nouns, but it is not meant that all thosenouns that in the present state of the languages take one or otherof those types were derived from the corresponding Prakrit set.After the forms came into use, words-from foreign languages forinstance —were introduced which cannot of course be traced to thePrakrit and those were assigned to some one form according tothe gender in the first place and then to fancy or accident; thereis no reason why <strong>दौलत</strong> should be <strong>दौलती</strong>for its oblique and not<strong>दौलते</strong> or <strong>फौज फौजे</strong>and not <strong>फौजी</strong>; the tradition with regard to somePr. nouns also must have been forgotten and then they also havebeen in the condition of these foreign nouns and must have beentreated likewise; and to a certain extent oblivion is the reason whywe have two forms in the case of some nouns and no other.</p>
<p>This then is clearly the origin of the oblique forms; and allthe facts, especially in the Marathi language, harmonize socompletely with it that there can be no doubt whatever as to itstruth. And no other case than the gen. would have served the</p>
<p>purpose of reconstruction. When a language is in an early stage of growth and case forms such as the loc. sing. are made up byJoining two words such as <strong>देव</strong> &lsquo;a shining being&rsquo; and <strong>इ</strong> &rsquo;this&rdquo; or &ldquo;here&rdquo;,imagination is wanted to connect the &lsquo;hore&rsquo; or &rsquo;this&rsquo; with the shiningbeing, i. e. in the place of the shining being. But when alanguage has got the means of expressing the relation denoted by<em>of</em>, it is necessary that it should be used in connection with thenew post-position; otherwise the sense would be incomplete.And thus in Skr., Pr. and the modern languages all such post-positions are appended to the gen. case. The gen. forms of nounsas they were in the Prakrits and the Apabhraṃśa have descendedto the Marathi only somewhat phonetically altered, while theprincipal change that the nouns or crude forms have undergoneis the loss of final <strong>अ</strong>or <strong>आ</strong>answering to such a Skr. syllable as <strong>त, क</strong>or <strong>का</strong> when preceded by a dissimilar vowel, i e. <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>उ</strong>; while theother languages have, in most instances, taken this mutilatedcrude or nom. form as the base for all oblique cases, the M.confines it to its own place and uses the old gen. everywhere andwithout exception if we take the minor dialects also into consideration. The other languages have of course, as has been shown,preserved this gen. in some cases and of them all the S. in thelargest number of instances. Some such as the H. and P. havegeneralized the pl. form of one set of nouns and use it for all.The M. cases are thus more difficult to the learner than those of theother languages, but that is a matter with which we are notconcerned here.</p>
<p><strong>NEW TERMINATIONS IN THE VERNACULARS</strong></p>
<p>We will now proceed to the consideration of the new terminations. These have not necessarily sprung up from independentwords. We have seen that the old terminations such as the न ofthe instr. have been detached and constituted into post-positions.But the most common method the vernaculars have resorted tois to attach the case forms of certain words to the gen. of thenouns. The acc. and dat. terminations in the various dialectsare these : H. <strong>तईं, कों</strong>, Braj. <strong>कौं</strong>‚ B. <strong>के, ते</strong>,O. व, S. <strong>खे, ते</strong>,P. <strong>नूं,ताईं</strong>G. <strong>ने</strong>,M. <strong>स, ला</strong>, and <strong>तें</strong> used in poetry. Of these <strong>स</strong> has been discussed.The Māl, and Goan, have <strong>कां</strong>for pronours and the former <strong>क</strong> for</p>
<p>nouns and the latter <strong>कनां</strong>. Khāndeśīhas <strong>ले</strong>, P. has <strong>ताईं</strong> also for <strong>नू</strong>,Old Bengali has also a dative in <strong>रे</strong>.</p>

<p>Here we see that a good many languages have the terminationwith an initial <strong>क</strong>. What is its origin? Dr. Caldwell traces it to theDravidian <strong>कु</strong>. But in our whole investigation we have not yetmet a Dravidian influence in the grammar of our languages. Dr.Trump derives the S. <strong>खे</strong> and B. <strong>के</strong> from <strong>कृते</strong>. The last may notunlikely have been derived from it, but the aspiration of the S.<strong>खे</strong> is not accounted for. Trump attributes it to the vowel <strong>ऋ</strong>; butwe have seen that in the old Pr. this goes out, leaving nothingbut <strong>अ, इ</strong> or <strong>उ</strong>, i. e, the consonantal portion of it, which is subordinated to the vowel portion, leaves no trace. There is no otherinstance in which <strong>ऋ</strong> is known to exert such an influence. TheHindi <strong>कौं</strong> he also derives from <strong>कृत</strong> and not <strong>कृते</strong>. But here theAnusvāra is not accounted for and regarded as inorganic. Besides,B Mr. Beames remarks, <strong>कृत</strong> is not a word likely to yield thesense of a dative. It is never used in Skr. or Pr. as equivalent to<strong>कृते</strong>.</p>
<p>To be able to arrive at the probable or correct etymology ofany of these terminations it is necessary to collect and compareany more ancient forms of it that may possibly be found. Nowthere are such forms in the case of the H. <strong>कों</strong>and the Braj <strong>कौं</strong>.The old H. poets often use <strong>कहं, कहुं</strong> and even <strong>काहुं</strong>; for instance inTulsidās&rsquo;s Rāmāyaṇa we have:—</p>
<p>भानु कृशानु सर्व रस खाहीं। तिन कहंमंद कहत कोड नाहीं ॥</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sun and fire swallow all liquids. Nobody calls themstupid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>काम जारि रतिकहंवर दीन्हा । कृपासिंधु यह अतिभल कीन्हा ॥</p>
<p>&lsquo;He burned Kāma but gave a boon to Rati; this was anexcellent act done by the ocean of mercy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>कपिन्हसहित विप्रन कहुं दान विविध विधि दीन्हा॥</p>
<p>&lsquo;He gave various gifts to the monkeys and the Brahmans.&rsquo;</p>
<p>आसन उचित दये सबकाहू। कहौंकहामुख एक उच्छाहू॥</p>
<p>&lsquo;Proper seats were given to all; my mouth is one, how shall Irelate the festivities?&rsquo;</p>
<p>कैकई कहुंपुनि मिले मनकर छोभ न जाइ।</p>
<p>&lsquo;Met Kaikayīagain, but the agitatiton of the heart did notsubside !&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now we have seen that often in the modern languages the <strong>ह</strong> ofolder words is dropped; and thus from <strong>कहुं</strong>we have <strong>कउं</strong> and then<strong>को</strong>or <strong>कौं</strong> by the usual rule that we have noticed in going over thevowel changes. From <strong>कहं</strong> the Mālvaṇīand Goan. <strong>कां</strong>is derived.The <strong>कहं</strong> and <strong>कहुं</strong> are also traced to <strong>कृत</strong> by Dr. Trump. But Mr.Beames derives them from <strong>कक्ष</strong> &lsquo;arm-pit, side&rsquo;, which becomes<strong>काख</strong> and then <strong>काह</strong>, and the anusvāra he traces to the accusativeand thus supposes <strong>कक्षं</strong>to be the original of <strong>कौं</strong>. <strong>कक्ष</strong> is preserved inthe modern languages in the form of <strong>काख</strong>, but the further changeof <strong>ख</strong> to <strong>इ</strong> in the suffix he accounts for by considering it to be alater Tadbhava. And corresponding to these two forms he says wehave the two forms of <strong>स्थान</strong>in the ordinary word <strong>थान</strong>H. &lsquo;a place&rsquo;and in the <strong>ह</strong>of <strong>कहां, जहां</strong>. I have no hesitation in saying that Mr.Beames is altogether wrong in deriving <strong>कहां, जहां</strong> etc., and furtheron <strong>तईं</strong> or <strong>ताई</strong> from <strong>किंस्थान, यत्स्थान, तत्स्थान</strong> etc. Such new expressions in the face of the many good old words existing in Skr. and Pr. couldnot have come in ordinary vernacular use. The B. <strong>एथाय, ओथाय, कोथाय</strong>etc., which have led Mr. Beames to this etymology aremanifestly new combinations of <strong>ए</strong> and <strong>थाय</strong>. <strong>ओ</strong> and <strong>थाय, को</strong> and <strong>थाय</strong>like the barbarous compounds <strong>एखानें, सेखानें</strong> of Skr. and foreignwords derived by the Bengali in its poverty of the old Tadbhavaelement. Neither should we derive the M. <strong>एथ</strong>and later <strong>एथें</strong>from<strong>एतत्स्थान</strong> in the face of the Pr. <strong>एत्थ</strong>from Skr. <strong>अत्र</strong> or <strong>इत्र</strong> which we findeverywhere in Pr. works. Now as regards <strong>काख</strong>, in addition to theobjection which Mr. Beames has not succeeded in answering, it isto be observed that the word is found nowhere used in that sensein old H., G. or M. literature and, that it might be the original ofthe dat, case-affix in nearly all the languages, it is necessary thatit should have been used extensively in Skr. or Pr. or in the oldliterature of the modern languages.</p>
<p>One chief and important source of the modern case affixes hasbeen overlooked by all those who have written on varnacularphilology. The words most fitted to express case relations are thepronouns and the old Aryan case endings have properly beentraced by comparative philologists to pronominal roots. Even inthe vernacular speech of the day we use pronominal expressions.when a simply general sense is wanted as <strong>मी गोविंदाचे एथें गेलों होतों</strong>&lsquo;I went to (lit.) the here of Govinda, i. e. to Govinda&rsquo;s place; <strong>मैनें आपके यहां सेवकको भेजा था</strong>&lsquo;I sent my servant to your here&rsquo;, i. e. yourplace; <strong>हुं मुरलीधरने तहां गयो हतो</strong>&lsquo;I went to Murlidhar&rsquo;s there&rsquo; i. e.,place. These <strong>एथें, यहां</strong>and <strong>तहां</strong>are really remnants of the old Pr.locatives of <strong>इदम्</strong> (in the forms <strong>इ</strong> or <strong>अ</strong> ) and तत्. If these weremore extensively used, they would in the course of time becometerminations, and <strong>तईे</strong>for <strong>तहिं</strong>, the Pr. Apbhr. loc. of <strong>तद</strong>, has becomea termination in H. as <strong>मैं शहरके तईं गया</strong>&lsquo;I went to the there of thetown&rsquo;; <strong>उसके तईं</strong> &rsquo;to him. or for him&rsquo;. In the Apabhraṁśa,according to Hemacandro, <strong>केहिं</strong>and <strong>तेहिं</strong>were used as postpositionsin the sense of &lsquo;for&rsquo; &lsquo;on account of as in the verse formerly given<strong>हउं झिज्जउं तउ केहिं पिअ</strong> &amp;c. These, as they are,appear likeinstrumental plurals of the pronouns <strong>किम्</strong> and <strong>तद्</strong> and they may beso really. The instr. and abl. may pass into the dat, and this intoeither. For, of the several relations denoted by the first twocases one is that between a cause and its effect or reason andconclusion, and a confusion between an antecedent cause orreason and the final cause or purpose is natural. This last isgenerally indicated by the dat. case. Even the English preposition&rsquo;for&rsquo; has these two senses. In the sentence, &lsquo;I bought the book formy own use, it signifies the purposes and in such a one as &lsquo;for this, let people beware&rsquo; it denotes an antecedent reason. In thesame way <strong>साठीं</strong> or <strong>करितां</strong> are in M. used in both these senses. In<strong>त्याच्यासाठीं मी इतका श्रम केला</strong>&lsquo;I took so much trouble for him&rsquo; it hasa dative sense and in <strong>ह्यासाठीं अशी गोष्ट कधीं करू नये</strong>&lsquo;for this, such athing should never be done&rsquo; it has an ablative sense. This factmust be borne in mind as we go on discussing the origin of thecase forms. <strong>केहिं</strong> and <strong>तेहिं</strong> are therefore may be instrumentals.</p>
<p>This explanation is supported by the fact that another Apbhr.post-position in the sense of &lsquo;for&rsquo; or &lsquo;on account of given byHemacandra is <strong>तणेण</strong>which is evidently the sing. instr. of <strong>तण</strong>,</p>
<p>a possessive suffix to be hereafter mentioned. The pl. case formsmay become adverbs or postpositions as the Skr. <strong>शनैः</strong>&rsquo; slowly&rsquo; ,<strong>नीचैः</strong> and <strong>उच्चैः</strong>&rsquo;low&rsquo; and &lsquo;high&rsquo; which must originally have beeninstr. plurals. Another explanation of these forms is that theyare derived from the Pr. gen. plurals <strong>केसिं</strong>and <strong>तेसिं</strong>, the <strong>स</strong> beingchanged to <strong>ह</strong>. The gen. has all along been used in the sense ofthe dat. In Skr. itself it is often so and in the Pr. it drove outthe old dat. altogether and was used instead. In old M. poetrythe obl. form, which we have traced to the Pr. gen., is often usedfor this case or, since in the Apabhr. nouns the termination <strong>हिं</strong>was used for loc. pl. also, the forms <strong>केहिं</strong> and <strong>तेहिं</strong>are not unlikelyto be referred to that case. The loc. is another case which canreadily be adapted to express a dat. acc. sense. Tulsidāsafrequently adds <strong>हिं</strong>to nouns to form this case. Thus—</p>
<p>रुद्रहिं देखि मदन भयमाना।</p>
<p>&lsquo;The god of love was afraid when he saw Rudra.&rsquo;</p>
<p>रामहिं सौपिय जानकी नाइ कमल पदमाथ।<br>
सुत कहुंराज समर्पि वन जाइ मजिथरघुनाथ॥</p>
<p>&lsquo;Having restored Jānakīto Rāmaand bowing your head athis lotus feet and giving the kingdom to your son, go to a forestand adore Raghunātha.&quot;</p>
<p>That these several cases may pass into the dat. acc. is alsoproved by the fact that the forms of the Apabhraṃśa gerund ofinfinitive of purpose, which has essentially a dative sense, arederived from them. Thus Hamacandra gives these terminationsof the infinitive: <strong>एवम्</strong>as in <strong>देवम्</strong> &lsquo;for giving&rsquo; which is an acc. of the pot. part. <strong>देअव्वम्, अण</strong> as in <strong>करण</strong> &lsquo;for doing&rsquo; in which thecase termination is dropped, <strong>अणइम्</strong> so as in <strong>भुंजणइं</strong>&lsquo;for breaking&rsquo;which is the gen. pl of <strong>भञ्जन</strong>and <strong>अणहिं</strong> as in <strong>भुंजणहिं</strong>&lsquo;for enjoying&rsquo;which is loc, sing, or pl. of <strong>भुञ्जण</strong> Pr. for Skr. <strong>भोजन</strong>. Thus then in the Apabhraṃśa pronominal forms had begun to be used as postpositions for expressing case relations. It is not unreasonable,therefore, to expect that we should find traces of the practice inour modern case forms and the forms themselves that were usedin that dialect.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Apabhraṃśa dat. postposition <strong>केहिं</strong>survives in the S. <strong>खे</strong>; theaspiration is thrown on <strong>के</strong> so as to make it <strong>खे</strong> and the followingvowel is dropped. We have already seen several instances ofthis process, but I will add one or two more to the point. The Pr.<strong>कहिं</strong> &lsquo;where&rsquo; is in the Goan. and Māl. <strong>खंय, तहिं</strong>&rsquo;there&rsquo; <strong>थंय, अहिं</strong> &lsquo;here<strong>हंय</strong>. Often the old <strong>ह</strong> is dropped in the modern dialects and thuswe have from <strong>केहिं</strong> the B.<strong>के</strong>. The old H. termination <strong>कहं</strong> is the Pr.<strong>कहिं</strong> &lsquo;where,&rsquo; so that originally the sense of <strong>राम कहं</strong> was Rāma&rsquo;ssomewhere. &lsquo;&lsquo;Send to Räma&rsquo;s somewhere and give it to Rāma&rsquo;ssomewhere came afterwards to mean send it to Räms and&quot;give it to Rāma. The <strong>इ</strong> of the loc. <strong>कर्हि</strong> is here dropped as ismostly the case in the pronominal locatives which in the modernlanguages as well as the Prakrit have become adverbs of place;such are <strong>जहिं</strong>relative &lsquo;where,&rsquo;<strong>तर्हि</strong>&rsquo;their,&rsquo; <strong>अहिं</strong> &lsquo;here&rsquo; and <strong>कहिं</strong>&lsquo;where&rsquo;(interrogative) which have become <strong>जहां तहां, यहां</strong> and कहांand in Tulsidās <strong>जहं, तहं</strong> and <strong>कहं</strong>. Sometimes the <strong>इ</strong> is preserved inthe current speech as in <strong>कहां</strong>or <strong>कहींं</strong> H., <strong>अही, यहां</strong> G. The other dat.termination <strong>कहुं</strong>, the origin <strong>कौं</strong> of <strong>कों</strong>, is either the ablative orgenitive form of <strong>किम्</strong>since <strong>हुं</strong> was in Apabhr. the termination of both these cases. The O. <strong>कुं</strong> is another form of this <strong>कहुं</strong>. The M.<strong>तें</strong> is from the Apabhr. <strong>तहिं</strong>as <strong>के</strong> from कोहिं. The B. has this affixalso used principally in the case of inanimate creatures.</p>
<p>धुयांते गन्ध आछे ओ ताहाते चक्षुते वेदना होय ।</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is smell to smoke and from that harm to the eye results.&rsquo;</p>
<p>तहाते सिंह कहिल।</p>
<p>&lsquo;The lion said to him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The S. has it also.</p>
<p>सोहल्यो शिकारते &rsquo; He went for hunting.&rsquo; <strong>विओ मुस फरिअते</strong> &lsquo;wenton a travel&rsquo;</p>
<p>The P. <strong>ताइ</strong> like the H. <strong>तईं</strong> is from <strong>तहिं</strong> &rsquo;there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The M. <strong>ला</strong>is to be connected with similar terminations in itsown dialects and the other languages. Khāndeśi has. <strong>ले</strong>. H.possesses a post-position <strong>लाय</strong>or <strong>लिये</strong>, P. <strong>लई</strong>, S. <strong>लाइ</strong>all in the senseof &lsquo;for,&rsquo; Braj. <strong>लौं</strong>or <strong>लों</strong> &lsquo;up to&rsquo;. The old H. poets have also <strong>लै</strong> or<strong>लाई</strong> in the sense of the M. <strong>लां</strong>i. e. &rsquo;to&rsquo; or&rsquo; at&rsquo;: <strong>वारंहिं वार पांवलै पदहीं</strong>again and again they fall at her feet;&rsquo; <strong>हरसि उठाय लिये उरलाई</strong></p>
<p>joyfully he arose and pressed him to his bosom.&lsquo;Then thereare other forms in all the languages from <strong>लग.</strong> Goan has <strong>लागीं</strong>inthe sense of &rsquo;to&rsquo; or &lsquo;with,&rsquo; as <strong>माझे लागीं उलप</strong> &lsquo;speak to or withme.&rsquo; H. <strong>लग</strong> &lsquo;up to &lsquo;; P. <strong>लग</strong>&rsquo; near, to&rsquo;; <strong>लागों</strong> &lsquo;from contact with;&rsquo; S. <strong>लगी-लगे</strong> &lsquo;on account of;&rsquo; B. <strong>लागिं-लागिया-लागे</strong> &lsquo;for, on accountof.&rsquo; In G. and H. poetry <strong>लागीं, लगी</strong>or <strong>लागि</strong> are used in these sensesand M. has <strong>लागून</strong> or <strong>लागुनि</strong> also.</p>
<p>All these forms are derived from the old Skr. root <strong>लग</strong>to adhereor stick. The past pass. part, of this is <strong>लग्न</strong>, Pr. <strong>लग्न</strong>. This, likemany similar participles, is made the base of verbal forms inPr. and we have <strong>लग्गइ = लग्नो भवति</strong> &lsquo;adheres, sticks.’ From thiswe have <strong>लागणें-वुं-व</strong>M. G. B. by the usual rules, but S. generallyand H. sometimes do not lengthen the preceding vowel when oneof the two consonants is dropped and we have <strong>लगणु</strong>and <strong>लगना</strong>,though <strong>लागना</strong> is also used in the latter. There is another form<strong>लागयति</strong> of this root which is made up according to the 10thConjugation or which is properly the causal and, when thetermination is dropped as is often the case, we have <strong>लागई</strong>and bythe elision of <strong>ग्</strong> the root becomes <strong>लाअ</strong>and thence, by the usualintroduction of <strong>य</strong>or <strong>व, लाय</strong> or <strong>लाव</strong>.Now <strong>लायणा</strong> exists in the Gosn.and <strong>लाइणु</strong> in the S. while M. has <strong>लावणें</strong>.These mean &rsquo;to make toadhere,&lsquo;&lsquo;apply,’ &lsquo;bring in contact.&lsquo;From <strong>लागणे</strong>and <strong>लायणा</strong> or <strong>लावणें</strong>all the forms we have above noticedhave originated. <strong>लाई, लै, लागी,</strong> <strong>लागिया</strong>are absolutives as also M. <strong>लागोनि</strong>,while the otherM. form <strong>लागीं</strong>is the loc. sing. of the noun <strong>लाग</strong> &lsquo;contact&rsquo; or &rsquo;nearness.&lsquo;The Braj. <strong>लौं</strong> must be from the oldApabhr. abso., <strong>लाउं</strong> of <strong>लाअ</strong>.. The M. dat. <strong>ला</strong>must be from such a form as <strong>लाउं</strong>&lsquo;havingapplied&rsquo; or &lsquo;for applying, &lsquo;since the final <strong>उ</strong>of terminations isdropped in this language as in <strong>जिभा</strong> &rsquo;tongues&rsquo; from <strong>जिभाउ</strong>.</p>
<p>The dative pl. termination <strong>नां</strong> represents an euphonic changeof <strong>ला</strong>necessitated by the preceding anusvāra. Instances of thischange of <strong>ल</strong> to have been given in a previous lecture. Cit. hasboth <strong>ना</strong> and <strong>न्ला</strong>. This <strong>ना</strong>is by some traced to the <strong>णं</strong>of the Pr. gen.pl. as <strong>स</strong> to the <strong>स्स</strong> of the gen. sing. The Cit. however has<strong>ना</strong> or <strong>न्ला</strong>in the pl. while <strong>ला</strong>alone is the sing. termination and the samenessof the sing, and pl. terminations is the great peculiarity of themodern dialect, whence the Cit. <strong>ना</strong>is a form of <strong>ला</strong>and if so, thenit must be so in the standard Marathi also.</p>
<p>Mr. Beames thinks the G. <strong>ने</strong>to be originally <strong>ले</strong> and thus tobelong to the class of terminations we have just examined, the <strong>ल</strong>being changed to <strong>न</strong>. I have not satisfied with this derivation as thereis no corroborative evidence, though the change of <strong>ल</strong>to <strong>न</strong> is notimpossible or unexampled. The gen. termination <strong>नो-नी-नुं</strong>in thislanguage is derived from the old Apabhraṁśa termination <strong>तण</strong>, bythe elision of the initial <strong>त</strong>, as will be hereafter shown. In thesame manner the of the acc, dat, must have been derived fromthe Apabhr. dat. post-position <strong>तणेण</strong>, which, as I have alreadyobserved, is the instr. of <strong>तण</strong>. The last <strong>ण</strong> of this is changed toan anusvära, as that of <strong>देवेण</strong>is, and, just as this becomes <strong>देवें, तणेण</strong>becomes <strong>त</strong>णेंand by the loss of <strong>त, नें</strong> . Or the process which in theApabhr. led to the formation of <strong>तणेण</strong>from <strong>तण</strong>may have beenresorted to when <strong>तण</strong>became <strong>न</strong> in the G. and thus <strong>नें</strong> is the instrumental or locative of the gen. <strong>न</strong> or its obl. form. But theanusvära of which is lost in the G. instr. would show that it isderived directly from <strong>तणेण</strong>. P. <strong>नुं</strong> may likewise be referred to aa form <strong>तणहुं</strong> the abl of <strong>तण</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>THE ORIGIN OF सIN THE VERNACULAR TERMINATIONS</strong></p>
<p>In H. the termination is applied in a dative sense to nounsgoverned by verbs denoting speaking <strong>राजाने ब्राह्मणसे कहा</strong> &lsquo;The kingspoke to the Brahman&rsquo;. It is used in the sense of the instr.,<strong>तरवारसे सीर काटा</strong> &lsquo;Hecut off his head with a sword,&rsquo; <strong>रुक्मिनीका विवाहश्रीकृष्णचन्दसे हुआ</strong> &lsquo;Rukminī&rsquo;s marriage with Śri Kṛṣṇacanda tookplace; and in that of the abl. <strong>इतना वचन ब्राह्मणके मुखसे निकला</strong>Thesewords fell from the mouth of the Brahman.&rsquo; In Braj, we have<strong>सों</strong> for <strong>से</strong>, as<strong>कबीरजी आयकैमोसों कह्यौ</strong>&lsquo;Kabir came and said tome;&rsquo; <strong>गुरुसों पूछि लेइ</strong>&lsquo;He should get it explained from the guru.&lsquo;In old H. also it is used in the form of <strong>सौं</strong>. In old M., as I havealready remarked, we have in the sense of the modern dat.acc. <strong>स</strong> as:—</p>
<p>( 1 ) सारथी शार्ङ्गधर । अर्जुनेसी ॥</p>
<p>Jñān. I-141.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Śārṅgadhara was charioteer to Arjuna.&rsquo;</p>
<p>( 2 ) पंवाड़ा तुवांकेला गंधर्वांसी ॥</p>
<p>II-10.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thou hast made a song for Gandharvas.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>( 3 )</strong> <strong>जे नेदी देवकी यशोदेसी ।<br>
ते गति दीधली पूतनेसी ॥<br>
समान देणेंअरिमित्रांसी।<br>
उदारतेसीं काय वर्णूं ॥</strong></p>
<p>RukmiṇīSvayaṃvara I-82.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He gave that salvation to Pūtanāwhich he did not gave toYaśodāand Devakī. His gifts to friends and foes are alike.How shall I describe his bounty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>(1) परी कषणेसीं म्यां झुंजावें।दे रणीं लागे पाहावें॥</p>
<p>Jñān. I-171.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is necessary in the battlefield to see with whom I shouldfight.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(2) अर्जुन असे पाहत । तो दलभार समस्त । संभ्रमेसीं ॥</p>
<p>Jñān. I-176.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Arjuna was looking at the whole force with an agitated heart.&rsquo;</p>
<p>( 3 ) आणि परलोकही अंतरेल । ऐहिकेसीं ॥</p>
<p>Jñān. II-27.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And the interest of the future life will be lost along with thoseof this&rsquo;</p>
<p>In these last three examples Thas the sense of an instrumental.We do not now use it in the sense in which it is used in the lasttwo passages and say <strong>संभ्रमानें पाहतो</strong> and <strong>ऐहिकासहित अंतरेल</strong>. In theSalsette dialect, however, <strong>सीं</strong>has these senses and also that of anabl. as that of <strong>गांवसीं आयलो</strong>&lsquo;He came from the village.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now we see that the old M. poets do not make a distinctionbetween the <strong>सीं</strong>, which corresponds to our modern <strong>स</strong>, and thatwhich even now we use in the sense of &lsquo;with&rsquo;. They all use it inother senses in which it is used in H., but not in the M. of theday. The Salsette dialect, however, agrees with the H. in its useof this affix. H. uses <strong>से</strong> in one case <strong>उससे कहा</strong> in which we use <strong>स</strong>,as <strong>त्यास सांगितलें</strong>. Some of these circumstances favour the supposition that the origin of the M. dative affix <strong>स</strong>is the same as that ofH. <strong>से</strong> and M. <strong>सीं</strong>. G. poetry has this in the form of <strong>शुं</strong> or <strong>स्यूं</strong>. as<strong>गूजरातिस्यूं मांडिसि कलह</strong> Declare war with Gujarati.&rsquo; S. has <strong>सें</strong> and <strong>सां</strong>in the sense of with.</p>
<p>All these are derived from the word <strong>सम</strong>. As is usual, is inmodern vernaculars changed to <strong>वं</strong> and thus we have <strong>सवं</strong>and withthe instr. affix <strong>ए</strong> we have the <strong>सवें</strong> of the M. poets. I have ina former lecture given a great many instances in which <strong>व</strong> is dissolved into <strong>उ</strong>, which combines with the preceding vowel into <strong>औ</strong>.We thus get the old H. <strong>सौं</strong>and the Braja <strong>सों</strong>, when <strong>अ</strong>and <strong>उ</strong> form <strong>ओ</strong>,while in G. the resulting vowel is <strong>उं</strong> in <strong>शुं</strong>. Another change of <strong>म</strong>that we have noticed is its loss of the labial element and reductionto a vowel and anusvära, wherefore the word becomes <strong>सअं</strong>or <strong>सयं</strong>.Thence the <strong>अय</strong> passes off into <strong>ए</strong>, as we have several times noticed,and so we have <strong>सें</strong>, which with the anusvāra dropped is the H. <strong>से</strong>.The <strong>य</strong> is sometimes, as we have seen, changed to <strong>ई</strong> as in <strong>राइ</strong>from <strong>राअ-राय</strong>and so we have the M. <strong>सीं</strong>. Sometimes <strong>य</strong> does not take theplace of the elided consonant and the vowels are combined,whence we have the S. <strong>सां</strong>. Now the original sense of this wordis with, but this with expresses many relations, the differencesbetween which become wider in the course of time and thus theword <strong>सम</strong> has come to signify &rsquo;to, according to, with (as an instrument) and from&rsquo;.</p>
<p>This instr. termination <strong>नें</strong> (sing.)<strong>नीं</strong>(pl.) M., <strong>ने</strong> H., <strong>नइ</strong> P. have beentraced by Mr. Beames to <strong>ले</strong> or <strong>लै</strong>, which are forms of <strong>लागिं</strong>or <strong>लइ</strong>etc. derived from the root <strong>लग</strong>. One great objection is that thisderivation does not account for the anusvära of <strong>नें</strong> or <strong>नैं</strong>. Hisargument is that the old <strong>एन</strong>of the instr. having been reduced to <strong>एं</strong>,there was no other instrumental case to furnish the <strong>न</strong> of themodern instr. <strong>नें-नीं</strong>; but in the Apabhr, according to Hemacandraboth these forms existed and the instance he gives is</p>
<p>जे महु दिण्णा दिअहडा दइएं पवसन्तेण ।<br>
ताण गणन्तिए अंगुलिउ जज्जरि आउ नहेण ॥</p>
<p>&lsquo;By counting (again and again) [the number of] days whichwere mentioned to me by my beloved when he set out on histravels [ the skin of] my fingers has worn away by the nail.&lsquo;Here <strong>दइएं, पवसन्तेण</strong> and <strong>नहेण</strong> are instances of the instrumental. Thefirst two are expressive of the agent in the passive constructionand the third of the simple instrument; so that the <strong>एण</strong>or <strong>ण</strong> of theinstrumental must have descended to the vernaculars. Again Mr.Beames says that the old H. poets do not use the instr. in <strong>नें</strong>; butthe oldest M. poet Jñāṇeśvara does use it in some cases.His</p>
<p>agent instrumental is very often that which ends in <strong>एं</strong>, butinstances of the use of <strong>नि</strong>, which is another form of <strong>नें</strong>, also occur.</p>
<p>As:—</p>
<p>कीं वारेनि जात आहे।</p>
<p>Jñān. 13-197.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or whether he is going away by the wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>दिसे वारेनि जैसे जाइल।</p>
<p>Jñān. 13-214.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Appears as if it will go away by the wind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>मुकेनि घेतले मौन जैसे।</p>
<p>Jñān. 13-280.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the dumb may be said to have assumed silence deliberately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>उन्हालेनि जो न तापे ।<br>
हिमवंति न कांपे ॥<br>
कायसेनही न वासि पे ।पातलेया ॥</p>
<p>Jñān. 13-347.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is not oppressed by heat or does not shiver by cold and isnot terrified by anything that takes place.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here are instances of the instr. both indicative of the agentand of the simple instrument, but the termination is <strong>नि</strong> insteadof <strong>नें</strong>. Besides these there are instances of the instrumental in <strong>णें</strong>of pronouns as <strong>येणें मानें</strong>Jñān. 13-200 &lsquo;By this standard,&rsquo; <strong>जेणें, तोवें</strong>13-244 &lsquo;By which satisfaction&rsquo;, <strong>तेणें प्रसादें</strong>18-1147 &lsquo;By that grace.&lsquo;Now I have stated my view in the last lecture that <strong>नें</strong> is a doubleinstrumental, the first part being <strong>न</strong> of the old instrumental in <strong>एन</strong>or <strong>एण,</strong> and the second part <strong>एं</strong>, to which that <strong>एण</strong>is reduced. Nowinstead of <strong>एं</strong>, the instr. <strong>इं</strong>is added here. The instr. <strong>इं</strong> represents the<strong>इण</strong> of the Apabhr. instr. in <strong>इण</strong>, which we have in such forms as<strong>पुत्ति</strong>ण mentioned by Pischel. Hindi poets as a rule indicate theagent instrumental by the oblique form, but Sūrdās uses the formending in <strong>नि</strong> or <strong>नें</strong> also.</p>

<p>The Ablative termination in M. is <strong>हून</strong>, Māl. <strong>सून</strong>,Cit. <strong>ठीं</strong>or <strong>पाष्ठी</strong>(from <strong>पास</strong> and <strong>थीं</strong>), Sals, <strong>सिं</strong>, G. <strong>थी</strong>, S. <strong>खां-खउं-खां तो तां,</strong> P. <strong>तें-थीं-थों</strong>,H. से, Braj. <strong>ते</strong>, H. dial. <strong>र्थी</strong>, B. <strong>होइते तें.</strong> The Sindhi <strong>खां</strong>is the Pr. andApabhr, abl. <strong>कहां</strong>of <strong>किम्</strong>, the aspiration being thrown on <strong>क</strong>, as inthe case of the dat. <strong>खे</strong> and the other instances formerly given;so that the S. abl. etymologically means &lsquo;from his somewhere.&rsquo;<strong>खउं</strong> and <strong>खों</strong> are from the Ap. <strong>कहुं</strong> abl. pl. In the same way <strong>तां</strong>is theold abl. <strong>तहां</strong> and <strong>तों</strong>, the abl. pl. <strong>तहुं</strong>of <strong>तद्</strong>, in both of which theaspirate is elided but in the P. <strong>थों</strong> it is compounded with thepreceding <strong>त</strong>. The form <strong>थी थीं</strong>of the G. and P., and H. dial. andthe Cit. <strong>ठीं</strong>are derived from <strong>तहिं</strong>, the loc. sing. Pr. and Ap. of <strong>तत्</strong>with the aspiration thrown on <strong>त</strong>.</p>
<p>The differences between some of the significations of thedifferent cases are, as I have already observed, so minute thatthey frequently run into one another and when on account ofthis resemblance, one case form becomes identified with anothercase, it afterwards acquires senses more widely different from itsoriginal. Thus <strong>तें पुस्तक मला रामापाशीं मिलाले</strong> <em>i. e.</em> (lit.) &lsquo;The bookmet me in vicinity of Rāmā&rsquo;, easily passes into <strong>रामापासून मिलाले</strong>&lsquo;met me from Rāmā&rsquo;, i. e. &lsquo;got from Rāmā&rsquo;. And the B. <strong>आपने प्रभुर</strong></p>
<p><strong>काछे ताहा पाइलाम</strong> is generally considered equivalent to &lsquo;I got it fromthe master&rsquo;, though <strong>काछे</strong>is like <strong>पाशीं</strong>a loc. form meaning &lsquo;in thevicinity of. Thus the old loc. <strong>तहिं</strong>meaning &lsquo;in that&rsquo; was used asa postposition and thence came to mear &lsquo;from that.&rsquo; Or thetransition is first from the loc, to the dat., which I have spokenof, and thence to the causal abl. and afterwards to the local abl.The Braj. and P. <strong>तें</strong> is from the Apabhr. affix <strong>तेहिं</strong>(=for) mentionedbefore in which we have an instance of this passage of the dat.into the abl., as illustrated before in the M. postposition <strong>साठीं</strong>.In M., S. and B. <strong>तें</strong> has preserved the dative sense. B. has the abl.<strong>तें</strong> also, though some grammarians do not give it, but its seseis that of causal abl. or instr. as:—</p>
<p>शृङ्गेर दीर्घताते आनंदित हइल।</p>
<p>&ldquo;Became glad on account of the length of its horns.&rsquo;</p>
<p>ताहाते चक्षुते वेदना होय ।</p>
<p>&ldquo;From that there is harm to the eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of a different origin are the M. <strong>हून</strong> and <strong>सून</strong>and the B. <strong>होइते</strong>.The first <strong>हुन</strong> Mr. Beames, following Lassen, traces to the <strong>हिन्तो</strong> and<strong>सुन्तो</strong> of the Pr. from a fusion, as it is called, of both, out of whicharose <strong>हुन्तो</strong>, and, the <strong>तो</strong>being lost, the form is <strong>ब्रून</strong>. In a similarway <strong>सून</strong> may be traced to <strong>सुन्तो</strong>,though its independent existencewould make the supposed fusion a fiction. M. however has noinstance of the loss of final <strong>त</strong>and the preservation of <strong>न</strong>; but thechief objection to this derivation is the want of corroborativeevidence. It is possible, but there is nothing to make it certainor even probable. Mr. Beames quotes passages from Canda inwhich <strong>हुन्त</strong>and <strong>हुन्तो</strong> occur in the sense of &lsquo;from.&rsquo; But they maybe derived from the present participle. The B. abl. affix <strong>होइते</strong> isthe loc. of the present participle of <strong>हो</strong>, corresponding to M. <strong>होतां</strong>,which has the sense of the Skr. loc. absolute as <strong>असतां</strong>in <strong>मी करीत असतां तो गेला</strong>&lsquo;while I was doing he went away.&rsquo; In B. too thisloc. has the same sense as <strong>दिन थाकिते कर्म कर</strong>&lsquo;work while it is day.&lsquo;In H. also it is used in the same sense: <strong>द्वारपर देखते क्या है कि सिंह मरा पडा है</strong> &rsquo;looking at the door what did he find ? he found that alion was lying dead (lit. what is there,–a lion lying dead);&rsquo; <strong>भोर होतेहि उसने सखीसे कहा</strong> &lsquo;She told it to her friend immediatelyafter dawn (lit. after it had dawned).&rsquo;</p>
<p>In this sense as in that of the Skr. loc. absolute, the actiondenoted by the present participle is made the starting point ofanother action. &lsquo;My doing&rsquo; in the first instance was the starting point of his going. And herein is the germ of an ablative. In H. <strong>होते</strong>is sometimes used in this sense as <strong>मकानसे होते</strong> &lsquo;outsideof the house, from the house.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the B. <strong>वृक्षहइते फल पडित</strong>the original sense is &rsquo;the tree beingthere, &amp; fruit fell. The M. <strong>द्रून</strong> is the absolutive of <strong>हो</strong>and equivalent to <strong>होऊन</strong> having become which yields an ablative sensemore directly. The <strong>ह</strong> is sometimes dropped and the termination<strong>ऊन</strong> itself is attached in this sense to <strong>आं</strong>&lsquo;in&rsquo;, <strong>वर</strong> &lsquo;above and<strong>पास</strong> &lsquo;side &rsquo; to signify from in &lsquo;,&rsquo; from above&rsquo;, &lsquo;from the side as<strong>आंतून, वरून</strong> and <strong>पासून</strong> which are the sblative affixes used in caseswhen <strong>हून</strong> cannot be applied, and <strong>ऊन</strong> is sometimes affixed tonouns in <strong>अ</strong> directly and not to the oblique form, as <strong>घरून आला</strong>.Thus <strong>गांवाहून आला</strong>means lit. &ldquo;the village having been, he came.&lsquo;The M</p>
<p>āl. <strong>सून</strong> is the absolutive of <strong>अस</strong> instead of <strong>हो</strong>. The H. <strong>से</strong> hasbeen explained.</p>
<p>We have seen that in the course of the development of ourmodern languages the genitive which even in Skr. expressedrelation in general was used for the dative and sometimes forother cases also. The dative thus went out of use and, to expressthe relations which it indicated, various new suffixes, given andexplained above, were brought into use and the old genitive beingattenuated was felt to be too weak to express the usual genitiverelation and it was adapted to serve as the base of all obliquecases to which the newly constituted terminations were appended. The relation of possession as well as other genitive relations,such as that of a thing and the material of which it is made, had thus no special expression left for them. ln Skr. such relationsare indicated, besides the genitive case, by adjectives formed fromthe name of the possessor, material etc. by the addition of specific terminations and from these mostly the genitive terminationsin the modern languages are derived and consequently areadjectival in their nature and agree with the gender of thething possessed or made. The genitive terminations are asfollows:—</p>

<p>In the first lecture I have remarked that in the third stage ofthe development of Sanskrit the nominal style came into useinstead of the verbal style or fluent style. When the languagewas in this condition, adjectival forms expressive of possessionor other relations came into use instead of the genitive case andsuch forms, as :</p>
<p><strong>तदीयम् गृहम्</strong> &rsquo;the house belonging to him,&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>मदीयः छात्रः</strong> &rsquo;the pupil belonging to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>त्वदीया सखी</strong> &rsquo;the female friend belonging to thee,&rsquo;</p>
<p>came into use instead of <strong>तस्य गृहम्</strong> &lsquo;his home,&rsquo; <strong>मम छात्रः</strong>&lsquo;my pupil,&rsquo;<strong>तव सखी</strong> &rsquo;thy female friend.&rsquo; When the use of such adjectivesbecame general the real genitive case, so far as it expressed possession and such other relations between nouns, was driven out andadapted to express the various other relations mentioned before.Thus then we find that the case forms expressive of possessionand other relations mentioned in the vernaculars are of anadjectival character. It is, however, curious to find that in ourseven modern languages they are derived from seven differentforms in Sanskrit and Prakrit.</p>
<p>The M. <strong>चा-ची-चें</strong>must be traced to the <strong>त्य</strong>which certainindeclinables takte in Sanskrit asr or start as <strong>इहत्य</strong> or <strong>अत्रत्य</strong> &lsquo;of this place,&rsquo; <strong>तत्रत्य</strong> &lsquo;of that place,&rsquo; <strong>क्वत्य</strong> or <strong>कुत्रस्य</strong> &lsquo;of what place.&rsquo; <strong>इहत्य</strong> or <strong>अत्रत्य</strong>must by the usual rules be changed to <strong>इहच्च,एथच्च; तत्रत्य</strong> to <strong>तत्थच्च;क्वत्य</strong> or <strong>कुत्रस्य</strong> to <strong>कच्च</strong> or <strong>कुत्थच्च</strong> or <strong>कोत्थच्च. तत्थच्च</strong>is <strong>तेथचा, एत्थच्च</strong>is<strong>एथचा, कोत्थच्च</strong> is <strong>कोठचा</strong>.This <strong>च्च</strong> was generalised and graduallycame to be applied to all nouns to indicate possession and otherrelations.</p>
<p>The G. <strong>नो-नी-नुं</strong> are derived from the Sanskrit termination <strong>तन</strong>,which is applied in the sense of possession to indeclinablesexpressive of time, such as <strong>अद्यतन</strong> &lsquo;of this day, <strong>इदानींतन</strong> &lsquo;of thepresent time,&rsquo; <strong>सायंतन</strong> &lsquo;of evening time, <strong>चिरंतन</strong> &lsquo;of the olden time&rsquo;etc. This was generalised and Hemacandra gives <strong>तण</strong> as a nounexpressive of &lsquo;something related to&rsquo; or &lsquo;belonging to&rsquo; in hisgrammar of the Apbhr. dialect. In the line of the verge of</p>
<p>Premānanda<strong>बाधी विरहतणी वेदना</strong>&rsquo;the agony of separation afflictsand in the expressions previously given, such as <strong>पोतातण</strong>, and<strong>तेहतणो नहि लाधे छेह</strong> etc., this <strong>तण</strong> remains, it will be seen, unchangedand in this form it is often used in G. poetry. By the droppingof the consonant <strong>त</strong>, it is reduced to <strong>अण</strong> or <strong>अन</strong> and thence to <strong>म्</strong>,which with masc., fem., neut. terminations <strong>ओ-ई-उं</strong> becomes**नो-नी-**नं.</p>
<p>The S. <strong>जो-जी</strong> are derived from the Sanskrit possessive termination <strong>ईय</strong> applied to a great many nouns and all pronouns, as<strong>तदीय</strong> belonging to him, <strong>शालीय</strong> belonging to the house <strong>गोंनर्दीय</strong>belonging to or living in Gonarda. Dr. Trump assigns a differentorigin to this Sindhi <strong>जो-जी</strong>, which, as well as the etymologies ofthe corresponding possessive terminations existing in othercognate dialects, hardly bears examination.</p>
<p>Another way of expressing possession is furnished by derivetives of the root <strong>कृ</strong> &rsquo;to do or make. The roar of a lion is his <strong>कार्य</strong>or act. The roar of a lion is a <strong>सिंहकार्य</strong>or lion act, <em>i. e</em>. it is something which belongs to the lion. The word <strong>कार्यं</strong> therefore is adapted to express &lsquo;something belonging to one.&rsquo; Now this <strong>कार्य</strong> is inthe Pr, reduced to <strong>केर</strong>, as the <strong>पर्य</strong>of <strong>पर्यन्त</strong> to <strong>पेर</strong>, and the <strong>श्चर्य</strong>of <strong>आश्चर्य</strong>to <strong>छेर</strong>. From this <strong>केर</strong>, we have <strong>केरको</strong> which means &lsquo;somethingbelonging to one&rsquo; or his property. Madayantikāin the Mālatimādhava calls her body Makaranda&rsquo;s or <strong>केरअ</strong> or <strong>केरक</strong>,since he hadsaved it from the mouth of a lion. Hemacandra gives <strong>केर</strong> as anoun in the Apabbr. dialect expressive of the thing connectedwith another. The instance he gives is <strong>जसुकेरए हुंकारए सुहहुं पडंति तणाइं</strong>&lsquo;From whose mouth grass falls down in consequence of theroar which is the <strong>केरअ</strong> of the lion. He also gives in his grammarof the principal Prakrit <strong>केर</strong> as a termination having the sense ofpossession as in <strong>तुह्यकेर</strong> &lsquo;yours&rsquo; like <strong>तण</strong>. Thus then <strong>केर</strong> which wasfirst a noun came to be used as a postposition expressive ofpossession and was used as such in the principal Prakrit and bythe G. and H. poets:</p>
<p>अंधाकेरी लाकडी है दुबलींनु धन।</p>
<p>Tulasi.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am the stick of the blind [women ] and the wealth of aweak I (woman).&rsquo;</p>
<p>हुकुम होय हजोरी केरी शोषी नाखो बाधोसागर॥</p>
<p>Sāmaladās.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If the command of the lord is received, I will dry up thewhole ocean.’</p>
<p>One of Kabīra&rsquo;s Sākhīis—</p>
<p>दर्पण केरी ओ गुफा सोण्हापैठा धाय।<br>
देखत प्रतिमा आपनि भूखि भूंखि भूंखि मरि जाय॥</p>
<p>&lsquo;A dog enters a room [made up] of mirrors and runs aboutand, seeing his own image, he barks and barks until he dies.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There is another instance :</p>
<p>अमृतकेरी मोटरी सिरसे धरी उतारि।<br>
जाहि कहो मैयेक हौमोहि कहैद्वैचारि॥</p>
<p>&lsquo;I put down from head the parcel containing nectar. To whomsoever I say that I am one, to me he speaks in return two or four.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here we have केरी a possessive postposition. Similarly inTulsidās&rsquo;s Rāmāyaṇa we have <strong>कहु</strong> <strong>खबर बिभीषण केरी</strong> ‛give us newsabout Bibhīṣaṇs, where also we have the same postposition.When the initial <strong>क</strong> is dropped we have <strong>एर</strong> which we find in theHindi <strong>तेरा</strong> and <strong>मेरा</strong> as in Kabīr&rsquo;s Sākhī,</p>
<p>जो तू चाहौमुझको छोडुसकलकी आस।<br>
मेरा ऐसा व्हैरहैसब किछु तेरे पास॥॥</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you want me, give up the desire for everything else;become mine; and you will have everything else with you.’<strong>एर</strong> is the general postposition in the B. as <strong>पापेर</strong> ’of sin,&rsquo;<strong>ईश्वरेर</strong>’ot God,&rsquo; <strong>घरेर</strong>&lsquo;of a house.’</p>
<p>Prof. Hörnle and Mr. Beames derive the suffix from theSkr. past part. <strong>कृत</strong> which they say is reduced to <strong>करिअ</strong>and thenceto <strong>केर</strong>. But I have not met with a trace of <strong>करिअ</strong> as the Pr. form of <strong>करिअ</strong>of <strong>कृत</strong>. The usual form of it is <strong>किअ</strong> or <strong>कअ</strong>. Besides the <strong>इ</strong>is inorganic, being simply &amp; euphonic augment. Such aeuphonic augment cannot persist throughout centuries as the <strong>ए</strong> of <strong>केर</strong>has done until it was perpetuated in the form of <strong>एर</strong> in the B.Besides, <strong>केरक</strong> is, as we have seen, used as a noun in the sense ofproperty. There is no indication that a past pass. part can be soused. It may be used as an abstract noun, as <strong>गतम्</strong> in the sense of</p>
<p>&lsquo;going.&rsquo; So <strong>कृतम्</strong> may at the best acquire the sense of &lsquo;doing&rdquo;, butthe transition of &lsquo;doing&rsquo; to &lsquo;property&rsquo; is hardly possible.</p>
<p>Another derivative of the root has also supplied the vernaculars with a termination expressive of the genitive sense; andthat is <strong>कर</strong>. A good many words in Sanskrit have this <strong>कर</strong> appendedto them such as <strong>यशस्कर</strong>&lsquo;bringing fame&rsquo;, <strong>वचनकर</strong> &lsquo;obedient,&rsquo; <strong>किंकर</strong>&lsquo;servant&rsquo;, <strong>प्रभाकर</strong> &rsquo;the sun,&rsquo; <strong>लिपिकर</strong>&lsquo;a writer&rsquo;, etc. The originalsense is &lsquo;one who does the thing&rsquo; expressed by the nouns to whichis appended, but the derived senses are many, such as cause,habit, obedience and any other relation into which the doing ofa thing brings one with another. When the particular nature ofthis relation is left out of sight, the general sense is &lsquo;related to’ or&quot;belonging to.’ Thus <strong>प्रभाकर</strong>originally meaning &rsquo;the maker oflight’ comes to denote &lsquo;belonging to light&rsquo;; a certain person whois <strong>लिपिकर</strong> or the doer of the writing is a person related or belonging to the writing. Thus <strong>कर</strong>came gradually to signify agenitive relation like the termination <strong>ईय, त्य, तन</strong>etc., noticedabove. In the Marathi <strong>कर</strong> is applied in ordinary use to thename of a place to denote &lsquo;one residing in it&rsquo; or generally&quot;belonging it it&rsquo; as <strong>काशीकर</strong> &lsquo;belonging to Kāśī&rsquo;, <strong>पुणेकर</strong> ’belonging toPoona.’ Instances of this <strong>कर</strong> occur in the old Hindi poets; thusin Tulsidās&rsquo;s Rāmāyaṇa we have—</p>
<p>तजौं न नारदकर उपदेशू ।</p>
<p>Bālak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not set aside the advice of Nārada.&rdquo;</p>
<p>पुनि पुनि हृदय विचार करि घरि सीताकर रूप।</p>
<p>(Ditto).</p>
<p>&lsquo;Again and again reflecting in her mind she (Pārvatī) assumedthe form of Sītā.’</p>
<p>मैंशंकरकर कड़ा न माना ।</p>
<p>(Ditto).</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not obey the word of Śaṁkara.&rsquo;</p>
<p>भरद्वाज सुनु अपर अय राम जन्मकर हेतु।</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh Bharadvāja, hear now another reason for the birth ofRāma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Kabīr too we meet this termination as in:—</p>
<p>तब ब्रह्मा (ब्रह्में) पूछल महतारि।<br>
को तोर पुरुष का ( के) करि तुम नारी।</p>
<p>Kabīr&rsquo;s Rāmaintī, 1-4th Chaupai.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then the mother was asked by Brahma &ldquo;who is thy husbandand whose wife art thou.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here we have <strong>काकरि</strong> or <strong>केकरि</strong>in which we have the feminineof the termination <strong>कर</strong>. In Sanskrit <strong>कार</strong>is almost as much usedas <strong>कर</strong> after nouns and the signification is similar. This <strong>कार</strong>issometimes used in the Bengali in a genitive sense as in <strong>आपनकार</strong>&lsquo;of your honour,&rsquo; <strong>आजकार</strong>&lsquo;of to-day,&rsquo; <strong>कालिकार</strong>&lsquo;of yesterday.&lsquo;From <strong>कर</strong>, when the initial consonant is dropped, we have theOriya genitive suffix <strong>अर</strong>as in <strong>घरर</strong>, while <strong>कार</strong> gives us the <strong>मार</strong> ofthe Hindi <strong>तुझारा</strong> &lsquo;youre,&rsquo; <strong>हमारा</strong> &lsquo;ours snd of the Guj <strong>तारो</strong>&rsquo;thing,&rsquo;<strong>तमारो</strong>&lsquo;yours,&rsquo; <strong>मारो</strong> &lsquo;mine,&rsquo; <strong>अमारो</strong> &lsquo;ours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Another derivative of the root <strong>कृ</strong>. the past pass. part. <strong>कृत</strong>changed to <strong>फअ</strong> in the Prakrit, has been appropriated in Hindi to express genitive relations. As the obl. form has been determined to be a remnant of the old genitive, the <strong>क</strong> appended to itmust mean&rsquo; done of (by) the thing or person&rsquo; denoted by theobl. form. The idea of a thing done by one&rsquo; passes easily intoa thing belonging to one. <strong>पण्डितकृत काव्य</strong> &lsquo;apoem composed bya Pandit&rsquo; becomes easily <strong>पण्डितका काव्य</strong> <em>i.e.</em> the poem of a Pandit.The terminations <strong>का, की</strong> exist in old Hindi along with <strong>केरा, केरी</strong>snd <strong>कर, करी</strong>.</p>
<p>The easiest explanation of the Panjabi <strong>दा-दी</strong>appears to bethat, like the Hindi <strong>का-की</strong>, they are derived from the pastpass, part of <strong>दा</strong> to give ’in the form of <strong>दअ</strong>made up on theanalogy of <strong>कअ</strong> from <strong>कृ</strong>. Other explanations may also be given.It may be said that the <strong>रो-री</strong>of the Marvari dialect and certainG. and H. pronouns, which results from the Sanskrit <strong>कार</strong>, waschanged to <strong>डो-डी</strong>or <strong>डा-डी</strong>, as these consonants are frequentlyconfounded with each other; and thence <strong>डो-डी</strong> or <strong>डा-डी</strong> passedinto <strong>दो-दी</strong> or <strong>दा-दी</strong>. The Sanskrit suffixes used by the vernacularsto express genitive relations must have a final <strong>क</strong> added to them,since, like augmented nouns, the masc. nom. sing. ends in <strong>ओ</strong> or</p>
<p><strong>आ</strong> and the feminine in <strong>ई</strong>. Thus for the original of the M.<strong>चा-ची-चें</strong>we must have <strong>त्यक</strong>, for the G. <strong>नो-नी-नुं तनक</strong>, for S, <strong>जो-जीईयक</strong>, for H <strong>का की कुतक</strong>, and for old H. <strong>केरा</strong> and <strong>री केरक</strong> and for<strong>कर</strong> <strong>करक</strong> and for <strong>कार कारक</strong>. In the fourth lecture I have givenseveral instances of the addition of to all sorts of nouns andadjectives.</p>
<p>The new loc. termination in H. are <strong>में</strong>, Braj. <strong>मैं</strong>and पै, P.ते, S. <strong>मे</strong>,G.<strong>मां</strong>, M. <strong>आंत</strong>and B. <strong>ते</strong>. The forms with an initial <strong>म</strong> are derivedfrom the Skr. <strong>मध्य</strong> which has undergone several transformations.In old H. and G. poetry it occurs in the forms of <strong>माहीं</strong>antil <strong>महं</strong>eto., as :—</p>
<p>शिव संकल्प कीन्हमनमाहीं ।</p>
<p>Tulsi, Bāla-K.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Siva resolved in his mind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>जे हि राखे रघुवीर ते उपरे तेहि कालमहं ।</p>
<p>(Ditto).</p>
<p>&lsquo;Those were safe at that time whom Raghuvīra protected.&rsquo;</p>
<p>एकवार त्रेतायुगमाहीं ।</p>
<p>(Ditto).</p>
<p>&lsquo;Once in Tretāyuga&rsquo;</p>
<p>पुनि मंदिर मई बात जनाई।</p>
<p>&lsquo;He announced the intelligence in the palace.&rsquo;</p>
<p>सुदामा में पृथिवी माहीं ।लीधा दश अवतार ॥</p>
<p>Premānand&rsquo;s SudāmānuṃCaritra.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Sudāma, I have gone through ten incarnations on this earth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>सोरठ माहीं सहुको नाठतुं ।</p>
<p>&lsquo;Everybody fled to Soraṭha.’</p>
<p>The Braj. <strong>मैं</strong>is from <strong>माहिं</strong>, the <strong>ह</strong> being olided and <strong>आ</strong> and <strong>इ</strong> combining into <strong>ऐ</strong>, while in the S. and H. <strong>मे</strong> they form <strong>ए</strong>. In the G.<strong>मा</strong> the whole <strong>हि</strong>of B is dropped. <strong>माहिं</strong> is loc. sing of <strong>माह</strong> for <strong>मध्य</strong>.</p>
<p>The P. and B. <strong>ते</strong> is from <strong>तहिं</strong>, the loc. of <strong>तद्</strong>, or <strong>तेहिं</strong>which we havenoticed as an Apbhr. dative postposition.</p>
<p>H. पै is from Skr.<strong>पार्श्व</strong>, which first becomes <strong>पस्स</strong>, then <strong>पास</strong>, andthen <strong>पाह</strong> or <strong>पह</strong>, and the loc.of <strong>पाह</strong> is <strong>पाहीं</strong>or <strong>पहं</strong>which is its shortened form. <strong>पास</strong> is used as a post-position in H. and <strong>पासे</strong> and <strong>पाशीं</strong>.the loc. forms, in G. and M. respectively. The forms <strong>पाहिं</strong> and पहंoccur in the old H. poets, as :—</p>
<p>शंभु गये कुंभज ऋषि पाहीं।</p>
<p>Tulsi, Bāla-K.</p>
<p>’Śaṁbhu went to Agastya.&rsquo;</p>
<p>गयो कपि राम पहुं।</p>
<p>Tulsi.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The monkey went to Rāma.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The M. <strong>आंत</strong> is from Skr. <strong>अन्तः</strong> and its initial <strong>आ</strong> is dropped aftera dissimilar vowel as <strong>मातीतं</strong> etc.</p>

<p>We will now briefly examine the reconstructed verbal forms.We have observed that the materials out of which the case formsare constructed are not only independent words having, as in anearlier stage of a language, specific significations, the combination of which nearly constitutes the idea required to be expressed,but also independent case forms and existing terminations whichhave acquired a specific sense. Thus when the terminations cameinto use for both numbers of the cases, the B. and the O. have hadrecourse to the use of independent words such as <strong>दिग</strong>&lsquo;a row.&lsquo;and <strong>मान</strong>&lsquo;a measure or class,&rsquo; <strong>सकल</strong> &lsquo;all etc. to express plurality,while the G. employed the already existing plural termination<strong>ओ</strong>; and such forms as <strong>तहिं</strong> and <strong>कहिं</strong> loc. and <strong>कहुं</strong> abl. were used toexpress case relations and afterwards grew into terminationswhen their etymological sense was forgotten. We have also scenthat, as in the case of the new words that come into a language,the new forms at first express inadequately the sense they aredesigned to convey, but in the course of time imagination andusage give them a definite signification; or like words the formscome by natural transitions to express different relations fromthose they did before. Thus it was that the abl. <strong>कहुं</strong> and the loc.<strong>कहिं</strong> or <strong>तहिं</strong>became dat, affixes or the loc. of the present participle<strong>होइते</strong> came to express an abl. relation.</p>
<p>We shall find these principles at work in the reconstructionof the verb also; and there too you will meet with verbal formsmade up by applying the old personal and other terminationsto new bases which are adjectival in their nature or by addingverbal forms to them or by appending independent words. The</p>
<p>M., S., B. and O. make up some of their tenses and moods in thefirst way; the others do not. We will first examine these. Thebases for their formation are as a matter of course the participlesthat have come down from the Prakrits and there are no other.These are the present, past and the potential participles whichare, as I have just said, adjectival in their nature. Since anadjective must agree with the noun which it qualifies in numberand gender, our new verbs must express both these and the personof the nominative. The old verbal forms examined in the lastlecture express, as Skr. and Pr. verbs do, only the number andperson because they have descended to us from those languages.</p>
<p>In the modern dialects those adjectives only that end in <strong>ओ</strong> or <strong>आ</strong>agree with the noun to which they are referred, <em>i. e.</em> take thefem.termination <strong>ई</strong> when the noun is feminine and the pluralones when it is plural, as <strong>काला-ला घोडा</strong> M. H. &lsquo;a black horse,&rsquo;<strong>काली-ली घोडी</strong> &lsquo;a black mare, <strong>काले-ले घोडे</strong> ‛black horses,&rsquo; <strong>काल्याघोड्या, काली घोडियां</strong>. Similarly, G. and S. When the qualifiednoun is in an abl. case, sing. or pl., these adjectives take the obl.sing form <strong>काल्या घोड्यास</strong> M., <strong>काले घांडेकों</strong> H.,<strong>काल्या चोडीस</strong> M., <strong>कालीघोडीकों</strong> H. Hindi has no obl. form for other nouns than thosewhich end in <strong>आ</strong>and hence in <strong>काली घोडीकों</strong>the adjective remainsunchanged.</p>
<p>Adjectives with other endings are not thus inflected as <strong>खराबघोडा-घोडे-घोडी-घोड्या-घोडियां-घोड्यास घोडेकों</strong> etc. M. H.; while in theB. and O. no adjectives whatever.</p>
<p>Here then we see that, like nouns in <strong>ओ-आ</strong>, adjectives alsowith those endings have preserved the old terminations. Nowthe three participles I have mentioned end in <strong>आ</strong> or <strong>ओ</strong> arisingfrom the original affix <strong>क</strong>, wherefore they must be inflected. InM. and G., however, under certain circumstances the presentparticiple ends in <strong>अ</strong> and therefore is not inflected. The oldPresent has in M. acquired another sense whence a new one cameinto use, the forms of which are as follows:—</p>

<p>These are made up by adding the terminations expressive ofgender and person to the pres. part. which is <strong>करत</strong>. White the fem. <strong>ई</strong>this becomes <strong>करती</strong>, but there is another form in <strong>ये</strong> which appearsto have been arrived at thus:<strong>करन्तअ</strong> ( for <strong>करन्तक</strong> )-<strong>करतय-करतय+ई</strong>of fem.—<strong>करतये</strong>—<strong>करत्ये</strong>.The neuter form is <strong>करते</strong>.These threeforms are used in the sing. while the gender is neglected in the pl.There is however such a form as <strong>करत्यात</strong> used for the 3rd pers. pl.in the pure Deccan in which <strong>करत्यात</strong> is the fem. pl. of <strong>करती</strong>. Tothese adjectival bases are appended the personal terminations ofthe old Pres. for the two numbers, which, you will remember, are3rd pers. sing. <strong>इ</strong>. pl. <strong>त</strong>; 2nd pers. sing. <strong>स</strong>, pl. <strong>आ</strong>; 1st pers. sing. <strong>इं</strong>,pl. <strong>ऊं</strong>.</p>
<p>In the 1st pers. sing. of the new present the <strong>इं</strong> of the 1st pers.sing. is represented by the characteristic anusvära, the vowelsexpressive of gender necessitating the elision of <strong>इ</strong>. In the pl.<strong>करत</strong> and <strong>ऊं</strong> become by combination करतों. The 2nd pers. sing. hasthe <strong>स</strong> of the old Pres. and the pl. the <strong>आ</strong> which with the <strong>त</strong> forms<strong>ता</strong>, to which however an inorganic anusvāra is added bysome. The 3rd pers. sing. has no personal termination, theadjective in its own form expressing that idea, while in the pl.the <strong>त</strong>of the old Pres. is added.</p>
<p>In these forms we see that the of the nom. which is droppedin ordinary nouns and adjectives is retained and we have <strong>करतो</strong>but not <strong>चांगलो</strong>.</p>
<p>In the Goan. and Māl. the gender is not attended to and theforms are the same for all. This arises from the use of the unaugmented participle <strong>करत</strong> and not <strong>करतअ</strong> which retains the inflections. The forms are:—</p>

<p>The terminations are those of the old Pres. of intransitiveroots in these dialects, <em>i. e.</em> the real Pr. terminations without thetransitive or Parasm, augment <strong>ई</strong>. The 2nd pers. pl. <strong>त</strong>, which Ihave traced to the Pr. <strong>इत्था</strong>, is peculiar to the Goan. and Māl. andit is not altogether absent from the ordinary M. In the 1st. pers.sing. Māl, we have the old <strong>इं</strong> from <strong>मि</strong> distinct and not reduced toan amusvära as in the standard dialect and also the Goan.</p>
<p>A process the reverse of that observable in M. as regards thechange in the sense of verbal forms has taken place in theO. and B. The old Pres. in M. has acquired the sense of the PastHabitual and the forms made up by appending the old terminations to the pres. part. express present time, but in the O. and B.this new Present of the M. expresses habitual past action andthe old Pres. retains its present signification. In H. too thepres. part. used alone has the signification of the Past Habitual.</p>
<p>The reason why forms expressive of present time have cometo denote past time is to be sought for in that natural use of thePres, which is called Historic Present. A man in narrating astory transports himself for the sake of vividness into that timewhen the actions are supposed to have taken place and speaks ofthem as if they were present; and when this habit becomes generalin a language, the fact of such an imaginary transfer is forgottenand the Present Tense becomes Past Tense. We have manyinstances of this use of the Skr. Pres. in such books as the Pañcatantra. The forms of the O. Past Habitual are these :—</p>

<p>As in the M., the 3rd pers. sing. has no personal termination;and the pl. is the M. and H. pl. of nouns in <strong>आ</strong> as <strong>घोडे</strong> which wefind in the O. nom. pl. <strong>पशुमाने</strong> &lsquo;beasts&rsquo; also. The second personhas the same termination as the corresponding old Present, viz.<strong>अ</strong> and <strong>उ</strong>. The first person sing. has <strong>इ</strong>and the pl. <strong>ऊं</strong> and they arethe same as the <strong>इं</strong> and <strong>उ</strong> of the Pres., but there is some confusionabout the anusvāras.</p>
<p>Before proceeding it is necessary to mention that O. and B.use the sing, forms in speaking of, and to, inferiors, while thepl. is used in an honorific sense. This is so in all the languages;but these two use even in a singular nominative with the honorific forms or real plurals and a plural one with the inferior forms.This is due to the loss of the original plural of nouns in theselanguages, which I have before mentioned; so that one sameform of the nom. came to be used for both the sing. and pl. verbalforms; but, since the usage common to all our vernaculars didexist, the pl. forms came to be understood in a simply honorificsense, and the sing. in the sense of inferiority. There was nothing in the form of the nom. which expressed plurality and hencethe verbs also ceased to indicate it, though originally fitted todo so. Similarly, the pl. forms of personal pronouns which werenot lost came to be restricted to an honorific signification andthe sing, to that of inferiority. The words which were broughtinto use to indicate plurality expressed an aggregate or collection and thus, being themselves sing., the necessity of pl. verbalforms in connection with them was not felt; and hence they take&amp; verb in the real old sing. But there is this consistency in theuse of the verb, that the honorific pers. pronouns take an honorificverb and the inferior an inferior, <em>i.e.</em> an original pl. nom.takes an original plural verb and an original sing. a singular.</p>
<p>These same forms that we have been discussing have in theS. acquired a future signification and constitute the regularFuture tense of that dialect. The Pres, expresses in all languagesan immediate future—a man&rsquo;s intending shortly to do a thing isconsidered as good as actually doing it. This is the germ offuturity in the signification of forms of the Present tense; andusage may take hold of it and constitute them into a regularFuture. The Sindhi forms are—</p>

<p>Here <strong>हलंद</strong>is the old pres part.The 3d pers, as in the O. andalso M., partially has no personal terminations. The sing, and</p>
<p>the pl. are like those of corresponding adjectives in <strong>ओ</strong>. The 2ndpers, has the termination <strong>एं</strong> and <strong>उ</strong> of the S. old Pres. In the fem.the first is optionally reduced to <strong>अं</strong> and the <strong>उ</strong> combines with thefem. pl. <strong>ऊं</strong>. The first pers. pl. has the corresponding S. pronoun<strong>असीं</strong> &lsquo;we&rsquo; attached to it as a termination as in an early stage ofa language. The sing. <strong>सि</strong> or <strong>असि</strong>is perhaps the same without thenasal and shortened, which changes are made probably to adaptit to the expression of singularity. The adjectival maso. termination appears also in the first pers. sing., as in M., but it is shortened to <strong>उ</strong> and the fem. sing. <strong>ई</strong> and the pl. <strong>ऊ</strong> or <strong>ई ऊ</strong> optionallycombined into <strong>यू</strong> throughout. In the M. the adjectival genderterminations are not used in the pl. Dr. Trump considers thesepersonal terminations as the remnants of the old Pr. forms of <strong>अस्</strong>,which, however, are quite different from these.</p>
<p>The old past part. is similarly made the base of verbal formsexpressive of past time. In S. they are made up just in the sameway as the above, the 3rd pers. having the purely adjectivalforms, without the personal terminations, and the gender affixesappearing in the same places as in the above.</p>

<p>Here as before we have simply adjectival forms for the 3rdpers.; and the verbal terminations of the old Pres. appear in thefirst and second united with the nominal affixes indicative ofgender and number, which however are dropped where they cannot be easily combined with the other, as in the first and secondperson plural mase. It should be remarked that the old masc.termination <strong>उ</strong> or <strong>ओ</strong> is preserved in the 1st pers. sing., as in thenew Pres., and the 2nd pers. pl. has in some cases the affix <strong>त</strong>.,which I have already noticed and traced to the Pr. <strong>इत्था</strong>.</p>
<p>The Cit. and Goan. dialects agree with this in the main, butuse <strong>त</strong> for the 2nd pers. pl. of the Masc. also, as <strong>गेलेत</strong>. Their masc.sing, is <strong>गेलो</strong>and fem. pl. <strong>गेल्यो</strong>, since they do not drop the old <strong>उ</strong> ofthe fem. nom. pl.</p>
<p>The Māl, discards gender in the first and second persons, whenthe verbal terminations are appended, and the first pers. sing.termination is the old <strong>इं</strong>, which before the <strong>ओ</strong>of the others isreduced to an anusvāra, and we have <strong>गेलेइं—लैं</strong> &lsquo;I went. The 2ndpers. pl. termination is <strong>त</strong>throughout, as in the other dialects.</p>

<p>In transitive verbs M. attempts a curious combination. The participle being passive, it must agree with the object and take its number and gender and, if made the base of the verbal forms, its personalso. But unliked the Sindhī, the M.does not use this passive participlefor an object in the first and second persons. Thus <strong>मायैं</strong> and <strong>मार्युसि</strong> in</p>
<p>S. mean &rsquo;thou wert beaten&rsquo; and &lsquo;I was beaten&rsquo;, but we do not use&rsquo;.such forms as <strong>मारिलास</strong> or <strong>मारिलो</strong>to express this sense, though asolitary line from Moropant containing <strong>धरिलास</strong> has been oftenquoted. In these cases we use the impersonal constructionputting the agent and the object in the instr. and dat. and using,the sing, neuter form of the past part., as <strong>त्याणें मला</strong> or <strong>तुला मारिलें</strong>.Thus then this participle can have a nom, object only of the thirdperson. Properly then it ought to take no personal terminationsat all; but when the agent which is always in the instr. caseis of the 2nd pers., the characteristic sing., <strong>स</strong>and pl. <strong>त</strong>of that pers.are appended to the participle, so that it takes the gender andnumber of the object which is in the nom, case and the pers. andnumber of the agent which is in the instr. case. Thus we have<strong>तूं पोथीलिहिलीस</strong> &rsquo;thou transcribedst a book <strong>तूं पोथ्या लिहिल्पास तूं कामकेलेंस</strong> &rsquo;thou didst a work&rsquo;. <strong>तुह्यींपोथी लिहिलीत, पोथ्या लिहिल्यात</strong>.</p>
<p>These forms are condemned by the Translation Departmentof the Director of Public Instruction, but the Marathi speakerscannot dispense with them; <strong>त्वां काम केलें, त्वां पोथीलिहिली</strong>, theproposed substitutes, are felt to be weak and emasculated. Andthe Konkaṇis are not satisfied with second personal forms aloneof this nature and have devised a way of affiliating the past part.with the third personal agent also and, as the old terminations <strong>द</strong>and <strong>त</strong> are not expressive enough, they append to that participle thelast syllable of the agent forms, <em>i. e.</em> the <strong>नें</strong> or <strong>न</strong> of the instr. sing. and <strong>नीं</strong> of the pl. as <strong>त्या साहेबानें-नमला बक्षिसें दिलेनीं</strong>&rsquo;the Saheb gaveme &amp; reward&rsquo; <strong>त्या साहेबांनी मला बक्षिसे दिलेनीं</strong> &rsquo;the Sahebe gave merewards&rsquo;,where the <strong>न</strong> and नींof and <strong>साहेबान</strong> are <strong>साहेबांनीं</strong> added tothe verbs to connect them with them. These forms are not usedin the Deccan except by some KonkaṇīBrahmans settled there;and they are condemned by all good writers.</p>
<p>The O. and the B. do not inflect their adjectives, whether theyend in ओ or any other vowel and have no agent case or instrumental. When the languages came to be in this condition, there wasnothing to mark off the passive nature of the transitive participle.Hence it was forgotten and we have now active verbal formsonly, which are constructed as in the other languages.</p>

<p>As in the Pres., the O. like the other languages does not addverbal terminations to the third pers., but the forms are likethose in M., namely the nom. sing. and pl. masc., though they donot indicate gender here. The other persons have the terminationsof the Present.</p>
<p>The B. has no termination in the third pers. singular, whilethe pl. has the corresponding of the Present in that language.The 2nd pers. sing, has <strong>इ</strong> and the first person sing. <strong>म्</strong>, which arenot used in the B. Present, but are to be traced to the Apabhr.Present preserved in the <strong>इ</strong> and <strong>ऊं</strong> of the H and others; <strong>देखिल + ऊं</strong>is <strong>देखिलांव</strong>like the Goan <strong>करतांव</strong>from <strong>करत + उं</strong>, and the anusvāraand the <strong>व</strong>are hardened into <strong>म्</strong>. The first pers. pl. has the sameform as the sing., and such a confusion is easy in a languagewithout distinction of number. The second pers. pl. appears to bethe old adjectival pl. like the M. <strong>केले</strong> and the O.and the otherform is <strong>देखिला</strong> sing., the two being confounded.</p>
<p><strong>THE FUTURE TENSE</strong></p>
<p>The Skr. potential participle in <strong>तव्य</strong>, Pr. <strong>अव्व</strong>, which impliesduty, has become the base of the O. and B. Future. In Skr. <strong>मयाकर्तव्यम्</strong> means &lsquo;it is to be done by me&rsquo; <em>i. e.</em> it is my duty to do it,and the transition from this idea to &lsquo;I shall do it is natural. Thevery word &lsquo;shall&rsquo; in English, which primarily signifies &lsquo;I owe&rsquo;and has now become the sing of the English Future, is anexample of it. This participle in Skr. and Pr. is impersonal whenthe root is intransitive and passive when it is transitive. Likethe past part, this has lost its passive character in these languagesfor the same reasons. The usual personal terminations areapplied to it as—</p>

<p>In the O., the third pers. sing. has no terminations and the pl.has the nom. pl. <strong>ए</strong>, which we have found in so many cases. Theothers have the usual affixes. The optional <strong>वा</strong>of the first pers. pl.appears to be the adjectival sing. <strong>वा</strong>.</p>
<p>The B. first pers. has no termination; the second has the sameas those we examined in the case of the Past tense and the thirdhas the affixes of the regular Present.</p>
<p>This participle is similarly made the base of a future tense inSindhi; but since its passive character was not forgotten by theSindhis, as by the Bengalis and the Oriyas, the Future tense itforms is the Passive Future. The same terminations as those wehave examined before are appended to it, as <strong>मारिवुसि</strong> &lsquo;I shall bebeaten&rsquo;, <strong>मारिबे</strong> &rsquo;thou shalt be beaten&rsquo; and <strong>मारिबो</strong>&lsquo;he will be beaten.&ldquo;The third person has, as before, no personal affixes. When theverb is intransitive, this participle is used only impersonally inthe masc. sing., the agent being in the instrumental.</p>
<p>In M. however the optional participle has preserved its oldsense and is passive and impersonal, and, when used as a base forverbal forms, takes only the second pers. sing. affix <strong>स</strong> and the pl. <strong>त</strong>.Like the past participle when it is passive it takes the gender andnumber of the object in the nom, and the person and number ofthe agent in the instrumental, 88 <strong>तूं ग्रंथ लिहावास, पोथी वाचावीस आणिदुसरें काम करावेंस</strong> thou shouldst write a work, read a book and dosome other work.’ When the object is in the pl., we have <strong>लिहावेस,वाचाव्यास, करावींस</strong>; and when the agent is in the pl. and the objectsing., we have <strong>लिहावात, वाचावीत, करावेंत</strong>; and when both are in the pl.<strong>लिहावेत, बायाच्यात</strong> and <strong>करावीत</strong>. When the verb is Intransitive, it isimpersonal <em>i. e.</em> has no Nom, with which it should agree, sincethe object alone can be Nom., but it takes the <strong>स</strong> and <strong>त</strong>of the agent,as<strong>तुं जावेंस—तुझीं जावेंत</strong>.</p>
<p>Dr. Trump and Mr. Beames (Jour. R. A. S. Vol. VII), misledby the circumstance that in the B., O. and S. the <strong>व</strong> is pronouncedlike <strong>ब</strong>, have likened these forms to the Latin <em>bo</em> and explain themas made up of the principal root and the Skr. <strong>भू</strong>. But this latterhas in none of the vernaculars assumed the form of <strong>ब</strong> by dropping the vowel and the aspiration, nor are <strong>भ</strong> or the aspiratedconsonants generally ever known to become the corresponding</p>
<p>unaspirates. The genius of the Prakrits and their descendantsis to preserve the aspirate element and to drop the mute. In rarecases the former is thrown on an adjoining letter, but never lost.The usual form in which we have <strong>भू</strong> is <strong>हू</strong>. And this etymologywould not account for the fact that the forms with <strong>य</strong>are passivein S.</p>
<p>In these verbal forms then we observe fresh instances of thelaw of generalization or false analogy. For the Present andFuture tenses verbal or predicative forms, *i. e.*such as indicatethe person of the Nom., were wanted; and so great is the necessityof such forms that we in M. make up such verbs as <strong>करावीस</strong>and<strong>केलीस</strong> agreeing with both the agent and the objectas noticedabove. But the languages being in spite of this want condemned to use participles only, they made the best of what they hadand extended the analogy of the old Pres., which they possessed, to the participles, which they could not avoid, and thus applied thepersonal terminations to the participles and mads verbs of them.The B. and O. rather than make the verbs agree with the object,as the passive nature of the participle base of the verb required,dropped the passive character altogether and made the participlestake the personal tarminations of the agent, while M. reconcilesboth and makes the verb based on the passive participles agreewith the person and number of the agent and the gender andnumber of the object.</p>
<p>We have next to examine the forms that are made up byadding independent words. There are not many of this class.The H. and P. Future is constructed by affixing <strong>गा</strong> sing., <strong>गे</strong> pl.masc., and <strong>गी</strong>sing. and <strong>गीं</strong> pl. fem to the forms of the Present. This <strong>गा</strong> appears to be the past participle of <strong>गम्</strong>and ordinarily it isused in the form of <strong>गया</strong>. Participles of other roots also are in H.sometimes reduced to monosyllabic forms as <strong>दी</strong>for <strong>दिई, की</strong> for <strong>किई</strong>;these are feminine and the corresponding masc. monosyllabicforms are er <strong>दा</strong>and <strong>का</strong>. We have seen that these <strong>का-की</strong> and <strong>दा-दी</strong>are appended to the obl. case form to make up the genitive in H.and P. Similarly the participle <strong>गा-गी</strong> is used to form the Future,so that <strong>करेगा</strong> means &lsquo;gone that he may do.&rsquo; The M. Future isformed by adding <strong>इल</strong> or <strong>ल</strong> to the old Present, as you will see fromthe following forms:—</p>

<p>In the first pers. sing. <strong>ल</strong> and the anusvära of <strong>रीं</strong> together form<strong>न</strong>as they do in several other cases; the pl. is the same as that ofthe Pres. What is the nature of this <strong>ल</strong> or <strong>इल</strong> ? One <strong>ल</strong> that isappended to the past participle we have already examined. Thereis another appended in the Goan. and Māl. to the present part.and the forms thus made up have past habitual and future sense.Thus Goan. <strong>करतालो</strong>means &lsquo;he used to do&rsquo; and <strong>करतलो</strong>Goan.andMāl. &lsquo;he will do.&rsquo; In both cases the base is the present part., butin the first it occurs in the augmented form or the form with theold Skr. <strong>क</strong>. The pres. part. has in the O., as we have seen,acquired a past and in the S. a future sense, the germs of both ofwhich are, as I have explained, contained in its original signification, while here in the Goan. it has both the senses. Now, asit was the practice, as I observed in the last two lectures, toattach <strong>क</strong> and <strong>ल</strong>or <strong>इल</strong> optionally to a great many words, the sameword had often several forms—one without <strong>क</strong>, another with it, athird with <strong>ल</strong>, a fourth without it and a fifth with both <strong>ल</strong> and <strong>क</strong>.These terminations did not signify much originally but afterwards, when the words such as the pres. part. began more andmore to acquire distinct and diverse significations, one of theforms whether with or without <strong>ल</strong> became identified with onesense and the other with another. Thus <strong>करतालो</strong>, made up as it isby the addition of <strong>क</strong>, which has left its <strong>अ</strong>, and of <strong>ल</strong>, was appropriated for the Habitual Past and without to the Future.But that the new additions themselves originally were notexpressive of that sense is shown by the fact that the augmentedform <strong>करता</strong> in <strong>तो करता तर बरें होतें</strong> expresses past conditional in M.and H., while it is the unaugmented <strong>करत</strong> in G. in <strong>ते करत तो सारुंथात</strong> which conveys that sense. Thus then <strong>ल</strong> was applied in M.to the Present verbal forms also and, when the old Future waslost, these came to be appropriated for the Future, just as thepresent participle with <strong>ल</strong> came to have a future signification inthe Goan. and Māl.</p>
<p>The other tenses are made up by adding the verbal forms ofauxiliary roots, but their etymological sense has not yet beenforgotten and they have suffered no phonetic corruption except ina few cases. Hence they can easily be recognised. But thevarious ways in which they affect the sense of the principal rootin the different languages are not without interest. The auxiliaries are et from Skr. <strong>भू</strong>, the Skr. <strong>अस्</strong>or <strong>आस्</strong>, more likely the latter,which assumes the forms of <strong>आछे</strong> B., <strong>अछ</strong>O., G., <strong>है</strong>H. and P., <strong>आहे</strong>M. and S., and Skr. <strong>स्था</strong> from which the H. <strong>था</strong>and the S. <strong>थो</strong>arederived.</p>
<p>You will thus see that in this portion of their grammar thevernaculars have only adapted the materials they inherited fromthe Prakrits to their varying necessities according to the waysresorted to by all the languages in the course of their development. They have got nothing new and have simply given new shapesto the old; and the proposition, that they are descended from thePrakrits, holds good even here.</p>
<p><strong>LECTURE VII.</strong></p>
<p><strong>RELATIONS BETWEEN SANSKRIT, PALI, THE PRAKRITS<br>
AND THE MODERN VERNACULARS.</strong></p>
<p>Thus, gentlemen, have we surveyed the whole field of IndianAryan speech from the Vedic times to our own, and what is it wehave found ? The Vedic dialect lost a great many of its wordsand some grammatical forms, its nouns and roots arranged themselves under definite declensions and conjugations, and thusbecame what I have called Middle Sanskrit.</p>
<p>Till then there was no phonetic corruption except in isolatedinstances. But after that time the process went on rapidly, andwords were altered in form principally by the law of the assimilation of conjunct consonants and a few vowel ohanges. By the law of generalization or false analogy the declensions andconjugations were reduced to the prevailing types; some newwords came into use and a few old ones became obsolete, and thusthe language arrived at a stage of which the Pali, the sacredlanguage of the Southern Buddhists and the inscriptions ofAśoka afford us specimens. Then began a general use of attributive expressions for verbal forms, which had its effect on thethe vernacular or derived languages also, and thus while a goodmany of these forms went out of use in Sanskrit, the number oftenses and moods in the derived languages was reduced to three.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile the process which formed the Pali went on,other laws of phonitic change, and principally that of the elisionof uninital consonants and the reduction of aspirated ones to <strong>ह्</strong>,came into operation. The use of analogy in the simplification ofgrammar proceeded further, a few words of a non-Sanskrit originwere adopted, and thus arose the Prakrits.</p>
<p>There were several dialects of this class, but the distinctionbetween them was not great. After a while in the Prakrits themselves new phonetic processes began, the chief of which were thethe dropping of one of the assimilated consonants and in mostpases lengthening the preceding vowel, and the obviating of the</p>
<p>hiatus caused by the vowels brought together by consonantalelision by combining them or inserting light semi-vowels betweenthem. These were carried on further, the declensional andconjugational terminations were corrupted and mutilated, and theforms began to get confused; case relations came to be expressedby connecting independent words or pronominal forms with thegenitive of the noun; and new verbal forms were constructedfrom the participles by appending the personal terminations onthe analogy of the existing tenses, or by using the roots indicative of existence as auxiliaries.</p>
<p>About this time the Prakrit spoaking people came to bedivided into independent communities, separated from each otherby hills and rivers, or communication between them decreased;and therefore these several processes of destruction and construction were carried on at a varying rate and with a difference ofdetail in each; and thus grew up the modern Hindi, Marathi,Gujarati, Sindhi, &amp;c. This is the whole history. The vernaculars have descended from the Prakrits, and the Prakrits fromSanskrit; and since a language is transmitted from generation togeneration orally, if the modern dialects are spoken languagesthe Prakrits must have been so, and if the Prakrits were spokendialects the Sanskrit must have been so.</p>
<p>But these conclusions have been denied by some scholars.Professor H. H. Wilson says that that the Prakrit of the plays isan artificial modification of the Sanskrit language devised toadapt it to peculiar branches of literature. And the reason hegives is that even in later plays composed but a few centuriesago the Prakrit used is not the vernacular of the day, but thatwhich we find in the very earliest work of the species. But he isby no means certain, and leaves the question undecided. The reasonadvanced by him is evidently of no weight. If I choose at thisday to express my thoughts in Latin and compose a treatise inthat language instead of my vernacular, does that prove thatthat language is artificial ? Latin is sometimes still used inEurope for literary purposes, though it is not the vernacular ofany country. Sanskrit playwriters of later ages, and even a straydramatist at the present day, use the old Prakrits for their inferiorcharacters in orthodox obedience to the rules laid down by the</p>
<p>old authorities on the histrionic art; and since the Prakrits, likeSanskrit, Latin, and other languages are preserved by means ofgrammars and literary works, it is possible to write in them as inthese languages.</p>
<p>Mr. Beames at one time expressed himself decidedly on thispoint: &ldquo;The Prakrit of the poets is clearly not a dialect that everwas spoken.&rdquo; So Dr. Pischel, a German scholar: &ldquo;I agree withMr. Beames, that none of the Prakrits was evera spokenlanguage, and that in order to learn what was the spokenlanguage of the Aryans we must turn principally to the modernvernaculars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This, gentlemen, we have done; we have examined thevernaculars and found that there is not a rule about the changesof letters in passing from Sanskrit into the Prakrit given byVararuci or Hemacandra, of which instances are not found in thevernaculars. Of such as are general the examples are abundant;and in a great many cases even the words in which the change isof a special kind are preserved in the vernaculars in their Prakritform, slightly altered according to the processes that afterwardscame into operation. A good many of the vocal peculiarities ofPali and Prakrit speakers are preserved by the speakers of theGujarati, Marathi, Hindi, Sindhi, and Bengali. I have alreadydrawn your attention to the fact that the ordinary Gujarati cannotpronounce <strong>ऐ</strong> or<strong>औ</strong> but makes <strong>ए</strong> or <strong>ओ</strong> of it, the Marathi Deśastha<strong>ण्</strong> of <strong>न्</strong>, and the Sindhi and Bengali <strong>क्ख</strong> of <strong>क्ष</strong>, and theHindi <strong>क्ख</strong> or <strong>छ</strong> of it and <strong>व</strong> of the sibilant. The Bengali pronouncesa conjunct ending in <strong>य्</strong> as a double consonant and preserves theold Māgadhī peculiarty of reducing all the sibilants to <strong>श्</strong>, whilethe Hindi still manifests the Paiśācī pecularity of making <strong>न्</strong> of <strong>ण्</strong>.The case terminations in the forms they assumed in theApabhraṃśa have been preserved, some in this dialect, some inthat. All the three Prakrit tenses do exist and none other; pasttime is expressed in just the same way as in the Prakrits; theparticiples, the causals, the passives, the denominatives, thenominal and verbal bases, and the remnants of the Sanskritconjugations are just as they were in the Prakrits; and the newverbs and cases are formed out of Prakrit materials only. Then</p>
<p>again a good many of the Deśya or non-Sanskrit words thatexisted in the Prakrits are found in the Vernaculars.</p>
<p>Now if the Prakrits were not spoken dialects, what thesescholars probably mean is that they were artificial adaptations, asProfessor Wilson calls them. But we have seen that they grewup by such natural laws as guide the development of anylanguage whatever. The development of the Prakrit dialectsfrom Sanskrit is parallelled by the development of the Romancelanguages from Latin. If the Prakrit dialects are to be considered artificial, it is difficult to conceive upon what principles theycould have been constructed and for what purpose. A consciousmanufacture of a language would be conducted upon somegeneral principles and would not admit of such isolated forms,not obeying any general rule, as we have noticed. The analogieswould be perfect; but on the contrary we have seen that in thePali and the Prakrits a good many forms are made up accordingto a certain rule brought into use by analogy, as for instancemaking the passive by adding <strong>इज्ज</strong> or <strong>इअ</strong>, while there are otherswhich are not thus constructed but have descended by simplephonetic corruption of Sanskrit forms, as <strong>दीसइ</strong>, <strong>लब्भइ</strong> and others.In all parts of grammar there are such forms, and these havedescended to the modern Vernaculars, as we have seen.</p>
<p>Again, if these had been artificial languages, they would nothave been called after the names of the provinces as we have seenthey were. I have given ressons for believing that though thedifference between the Sauraseni and the Mahārāṣṭrīwas not great,some peculiarities of the former have been preserved by themodern Sindhi, Panjabi, Braja and Hindi, while the Marathirepresents the old Mahārāṣṭrīand some of the peculiarities of theMāgadhī Prakrit are distinctly observable, as we have seen, insome of the Inscriptions of Aśoka, in which it would be absurdto suppose an artificial language was used.</p>
<p>And how, if they were not popular dialects, could the idea ofusing them for women and the inferior characters in dramaticplays have in the first place arisen ? That a poet should makecertain persons in his work speak their peculiar dialect, especiallywhen that is an inferior dialect and likely to create mirth, is</p>
<p>natural, and this device is resorted to by writers in all countries.But it was probably more from considerations of propriety thanliveliness that these languages began to be used by Sanskritdramatists. For they are no less particular about such proprieties,and of even the so-called unities, than other nations. For one ofthe rules of the Art is that one act chould not contain the eventsof more than a day. Similarly the minute directions about theuse of certain Prakrit dialects in the case of certain persons areexplicable only on the supposition that the original idea was torepresent in the dramaa state of things actually existingin the world. For these varied reasonsthese varied reasons it admits of noquestion whatever that the Prakrits of the poets and of thegrammarians were really at one time spoken languages. But itis of course not meant that they were spoken just as we find them written, or that they were necessarily spoken at the time whenthe poets that used thom flourished.</p>
<p>The Prakrits became literary and dead dialects as Sanskrititself had before them, and, as already remarked, they may beused for literary purposes aven now, if one wishes to do so. Thedistinction between the written Prakrits and the corresponding spoken Prakrits cannot be greater than the usual distinctionbetween the language of books and that of ordinary life; andprabably the Prakrits of some of our early plays represent thevernaculars of the time faithfully. I must not omit to mentionthat Mr. Beames has considerably modified his opinion since hewrote the article from which the above extract is taken, for in thebeginning of the Introduction to his Comparative Grammar hespeaks of the Prakrits as spoken languages, and attempts toaccount for the use of so many in the dramatic plays instead ofsetting it down to a mere fancy.</p>
<p>We will next proceed to consider the views that have been putforth, opposed to the conclusions we have arrived at, as regardsthe relation between Sanskrit and the Prakrits and endeavourto determine that relation more definitely than we have done.Professor Weber believes that in the Vedic times there wereseveral dialects, and that by a fusion of these a common languagecalled the Sanskrit was formed, while at the same time thedialects ran on their course and formed the Prakrits. He says:—</p>
<p>&ldquo;I incline to the opinion of those, who deny that the Sanskrit Bhāṣā,properly so called, was ever the common spoken language of thewhole Aryan people, and assign it to the learned alone. Just asour modern High German, arising out of the ancient dialects ofthe Germans, reduced what was common to all to universal rulesand laws, and by the power of analogy obliterated all recollectionsof varieties; and just as, on the other hand, these dialects whilethey gradually degenerated often preserved at the same timefuller and more ancient forms; so also the Vedic dialects becamepartly combined in one stream, in which their individual existencewas lost, and so formed the regular Sanskrit Bhāṣā, and partlyflowed on individually on their own original (Prākṛta) irregularforce, and continued to be the idioms of the different provincesin the corruption of which they participated. The Sanskritlanguage and the Prakrit dialects had, therefore, a common andsimultaneous origin; the latter did not spring out of the former.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Professor Weber gives a few instances of Prakritised Sanskritwords from the Vedic dialect, as he calls it, to show that thedevelopments of the Prakrits began then, but nearly all of theseare from such works as the Upaniṣads, which must be assigned toa very late period when the language was in that confusionwhich we find in the Buddhistic Gāthās.</p>
<p>Now if the development of Sanskrit and the Prakrits wascontemporaneous, how comes it that almost all the words andgrammatical forms in these latter dialects are manifest corruptionsof Sanskrit words and forms? Professor Weber&rsquo;s theory does notaccount for this fact, but this defect is supplied by Mr. Beames,who holds nearly the same view as the Professor. He says:— &ldquo;Theidea of a common language is the creation of modern times, andthe effect of the spread of literature.&rdquo; &ldquo;The most probablehypothesis is, that the Aryans from the earliest times spoke manydialects, all closely akin, all having the same family likeness andtendencies common to all. perhaps in every case mutuallyintelligible, but still distinct and co-existent.&rdquo; In a note we aretold that this is probable but cannot be proved. The dialect ofVedic hymns was, he says, only one of these. Then &ldquo;after a timethe Brahmaṇs consciously and intentionally set themselves tothe task of constructing a sacred language, by preserving and</p>
<p>reducing to rule the grammatical elements of this Vedic tongue.&ldquo;&ldquo;They seized on the salient features of Aryan speech as containedin all dialects, and moulded them into one harmonious whole.&ldquo;They (the popular dialects) were anterior to Sanskrit, contemporary with it, and they finally survived it. Nevertheless, Sanskrit,is older than the dialects. This sounds like a paradox, but it istrue in two senses; first, that &ldquo;as ages rolled on, the vulgardialects went on developing into new forms, while Sanskritremained fixed and fossilized for ever.&ldquo;The second is that&quot;though Panini, who is credited with this feat of constructing theSanskrit language, lived when the early dialects were muchchanged, still among the Brahmans there was a traditionalmemory of the ancient and then obsolete forms of many words&hellip; In teaching his pupils the true principles of speech, Päṇini wouldnaturally use these archaic words in preference to the corruptionscurrent around him, and thus the language which he, to a certainextent, created, was in great part a resuscitation of antiquatedterms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To be able to estimate the views of these writers at their trueworth, it is necessary that we should try to fix the meaning of theword dialect, which is the source of some confusion and endeavourto form some idea of the origin and growth of dialects generallyIf little differences are to be regarded as sufficient to constitute adialect, there are as many dialects as human beings. For just asno two human faces ars exactly alike, no two men speak exactlyalike. Every one has his peculiarities of pronunciation, and isfond of particular words or turns of expression. The principleof individuality is strong in human nature, but its effects arecounteracted by the principle of community, which guides thedevelopment of human life; and the necessity of communicationcompels a man to drop peculiarities in speech and to conform himself to the prevailing model. Thus then, the individual differencescome to be minute and insignifiant, and hence the language ofa community becomes practically one language. But, constitutedas communities generally, but not necessarily, are, they arecomposed of classes; and there is not as much communicationbetween separate classes as within the limits of a class, andhence there come to be class languages, or varieties of speech in</p>
<p>the same community. There may be auch classes, but thesmaller ones may be neglected and we may distinguish betweentwo large ones, generally called the lower and the higher, or theuneducated and educated classes. The languages of these differ,that of the lower class being more subject to those laws of development, growth, or corruption which I traced in the first lecture.Thus an uneducated Englishman uses many such forms as &ldquo;Iknowed,&rdquo; &ldquo;you says, formed upon the prevailing analogies; andhis pronunciation of a good many words is corrupt, as &ldquo;genlman&quot;for &ldquo;gentleman,&rdquo; &ldquo;wot&rdquo; for &ldquo;what,&rdquo; &ldquo;guvner&rdquo; for &ldquo;governor,&rdquo; &amp;c. And in the same way the language of the Marathi, Gujarati orHindi lower classes is not the same as that of the higher. Butstill the word dialect is not used in speaking of these two varieties,one principal reason being that the language of the lower classesis not acknowledged to have an independent existence.</p>
<p>Again, when a community comes to have a literature, thestyle that is used, as a rule, differs from the ordinary conversational style. There are certain words, turns of expression,modes of construction, and even solitary forms which, thoughused in conversation, do not appear in books. Even these twovarieties are not called dialects. The dialects of a languagetherefore or kindred dialects, as they may be called, are thelanguages of kindred communities, which, while they possess alarge body of common words and forms, have also many others.which are different, though in most cases the roots from whichthese are derived are common to all. And according to theproportion in which the similar and dissimilar elements are mixed,the dialects are more or less distant from each other.</p>
<p>The causes that divide men into distinct communities are thecauses that create distinct dialects. The laws of change anddevelopment are always in operation in a language, in a changingcondition of society, and the processes of destruction or disappearance of old words and forms and the construction or appearanceof new ones, are constantly going on. Hence, when after theseparation of men into distinct communities, communicationbetween them is lessened, these processes go on in a varied anddissimilar manner. The conditions of life in their new</p>
<p>habitations may also be different, and when they are so, theybring about a varied linguistic development. But though theprocesses of destruction and construction are always going on ina language, they suppose that the society, whose language it is,is moving and not stationary. The life of a community may,however, be even and unvaried, in which case there will be littlechange in its language. Or certain races may be very conservative, and cling to the past with tenacity. Thus the Lithuanianpeasants of the present day have through a number of ages,though they possess nothing like a literature, preserved a goodmany old Aryan words and forms in a purer condition than alltheir European neighbours. So that even after men are dividedinto distinct communities it is by no means necessary thatdistinot dialects should grow up. They may or they may not.But the possibility of slight difference, such as those whichexist in the speech of the different classes of a community, evenwhen the dialect is the same, is not denied.</p>
<p>Now, if for the various reasons above indicated dialects havecome into existence, these continue until by the development ofcivilisation and by political events kindred communities cometo form a nation; and then by increased communication and thegrowth of a common literature these dialects are fused together,and one harmonious language is formed; though, however, inremote quarters they may continue to have an independentexistence. The writerswhom I have quoted pay exclusiveattention to this fact, of which there are several instances inmodern European history, the most notable of which is the development of the modern German; and lay it down as a universalproposition which requires no proof, that in an early condition ofsociety there must be a plurality of dialects, and that there couldbe no such thing as a common language.</p>
<p>This seems to be the opinion of Professor Max Mūller also.But if there was not one common original dialect, whence are thecommon portion of the words and forms of kindred dialects, andthe common roots derived? And does not comparative philologyitself, in its comparisons and classifications, go upon the assumption that there was such a language? Thus then, since thecreation of dialects depends on causes and the causes may not</p>
<p>exist, it will not do to assume that there were several dialects inVedic times without positive proof or even positive indications.Several independent Aryan communities or tribes may not havemigrated into India, but only one. Or even if more than onetribe came over, they may have been, like Lithuanian peasants,very conservative as regards their language. The circumstanceswe know about the language of the period do not necessitate thesupposition of a plurality of dialects.</p>
<p>Besides, if according to Professor Weber these originallyexisting dialects went on in their own isolated course as theidioms of different provinces, and became the Pali and the Prakrits,we should expect to find much greater divergences between them,produced in the course of the many centuries that elapsed betweenthe Vedic period and that in which they were as we now findthem. But the distinction between the dialects of the Inscriptionsof Aśoka and even between the different Prakrits is by no means.great, and concerns chiefly the pronunciation of individual letters.The pleaof linguistic conservatism which I have before used ina certain case cannot be brought in here, since those earlydialects resembling the language of the Vedas, as they must havedone if they existed, were already very greatly corrupted inpassing into the Pali or the Prakrits. Surely such very extensivechanges as from the Vedic to the Prakrit form, if carried on indifferent provinces by different communities, must occasion verygreat divergences, greater even than we find between the modernVernaculars. For the degree of departure from the old Prakrits.which these last exhibit is not so great as that which the Prakriisdo from the Vedic dialect. The divergence ought to be at leastas great, but it certainly is not so.</p>
<p>Now, the way in which the supposed contemporaneous development of Sanskrit and the Prakrits is accounted for by Mr. Beamesis, as we have seen, this:— That the Prakrits arose by a naturaldevelopment while Sanskrit was created by the Brahmans, andprincipally by Päṇini, out of the Vedic dialect and the salient points of Prakrit speech, and by a resuscitation of antiquated terms.Hence it contains the old words and forms from which those inthe Prakrits are derived. And this also accounts for the existenceof what Mr. Beames calls an Aryan but non-Sanskriticelement</p>
<p>in the Prakrits, by which he probably means either those fewforms that are not found in classical Sanskrit but must bereferred to the Vedic dialect, or others that must be Aryan,though not found either in Classical or Vedic Sanskrit. Of thelatter there are almost no instances which may be regarded asbeyond the possibility of doubt.</p>
<p>But such a theory is calculated to bring relief to a puzzledphilologist who, not knowing to what Sanskrit word to trace anyPrakrit or Vernacular word, will at once get out of the difficultyby putting it down as an Aryan word not found in Sanskrit.But how is it possible to create such a language as the Sanskritout of the elements indicated by Mr. Beames? A literary style,as distinguished from a conversational style, is what one canunderstand, but a language which never had anything tocorrespond to it in ordinary vernacular speech, but is simplycreated, is inconceivable. And if the creation of a sacredlanguage was the conscious and deliberate aim of the Brahmans,and Pāṇini resuscitated old or obsolete words, why did they orhe not include in the new language all the innumerable oldobsolete Vedic words and grammatical forms, which would have,from the very reverence that was paid to the Vedas, renderedtheir invention more sacred; and why should they, instead ofdoing so, have distinguished between a Chāndasa or Vedic, andBhāṣa or popular, speech? And, if the inventors seized all thesalient features of the popular dialects, would they have left afew but striking Vedic peculiarties in the popular speech, such asthe absolutive <strong>त्वान</strong> in <strong>तून</strong> or, unrepresented in their new language?And how could they from the popular dialects, in which theconjugations and declensions wereand declensions were reduced to fewer types,construct the innumerable forms of the Sanskrit noun or verb,Perfects, Aorists and the lost tenses or moods? And whatmust have been the basis of the incalculable Taddhita or nominal,and Kṛt or verbal derivatives, which have left but few traces inthe Prakrits? Even the Vedio dialect is not calculated to affordmuch help. For if the grammar of the later Sanskrit had beenframed by the conscious inventors upon the model of the Vedio,the declensions, conjugations, and the derivatives would have beenlike the Vedic; whereas, as a matter of fact, the differences aregreat, and some of these I pointed out in the first lecture.</p>
<p>There remains the third alternative, that there was a traditional memory of these forms. But why should they have beencommitted to memory when there was no motive ? The sacredformulas which Mr. Beames says were orally transmitted do not,if they were the same as those that have come down to us,contain a large number of such forms; and, if they were different,they are simply imaginary. And, though the Vedas were andare committed to memory, the literally incalculable number ofcase forms, verbal forms, Taddhitas, and Kṛdantas, in the absenceof any general rules which were laid down afterwards, as thetheory supposes, by the grammarian-creators of the languages, itis thoroughly impossible to commit to memory, —impossible, asthe great author of the Mahābhāṣya says, even for Indra, withBṛhaspati for his teacher and a thousand celestial years duringwhich to learn them. Of course it is a different thing when theyare current in a language which one learns from one&rsquo;s childhood,though even in this case very few know all the words and formswhich are current in their own country, and nearly all only suchas they are immediately concerned with. And what is theevidence for the truth of this theory? Absolutely none is given.It is simply the vague feeling of an individual or individuals,and not a conclusion arrived at after a deliberate weighing ofevidence; while it sets at naught the clearest evidence availablein the works of the grammarians themselves, which I shallpresently adduce.</p>
<p>The theory, therefore, is utterly untenable, and the contemporaneous development of Sanskrit and the Prakrits derived from it,to account for which it was invented, is an impossibility.</p>
<p>Professor Aufrecht, though he does not believe in a pluralityof Vedic dialects, derives the Prakrits from the Vedic languageand assigns Sanskrit to schools of the learned, but does notexplain its genesis. Those who believe the Vernacular dialectsto be derived directly from the Vedic must explain the origin ofClassical Sanskrit in some such way as Mr. Beames has done;there is no other way.</p>
<p>Dismissing feelings which we have been considering so long,we will for a time examine the reason or reasons that are given</p>
<p>for doubting the derivation of the Pali and the Prakrits fromSanskrit. Thus Professor Childers, in the preface to his PaliDictionary, states the relations between Sanskrit and Pali in thefollowing lucid manner :—</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we compare Pali with classical Sanskrit, we find that abouttwo-fifths of the vocabulary consists of words identical in formwith their Sanskrit equivalents, as Nāga, Buddha, Nidāna.Nearly all the remaining words present a more or less late orcorrupte form …Words of the above two classes nearly exhaustthe Pali vocabulary; but their remains a small though importantresiduum of forms distinctly older than Sanskrit, and found onlyin the oldest known Sanskrit, that of the Vedas. Nay, I do notfeel sure that Pali does not retain a few precious relics older thanthe most ancient Sanskrit, and only to be explained through theallied Indo-Germanic languages. It results from all this thatPali cannot be derived from Sanskrit; both, though mostintimately connected, being independent corruptions of the lost.Aryan speech which is their common parent; but that Pali is onthe whole in a decidedly later stage than Sanskrit, and, to adopta metaphor popularised by Max Mūller, stands to it in therelation of a younger sister.&rdquo; Then in a foot-note he gives theseVedio forms in the Pali :the infinitive in <em>tave</em>, as kātava&quot;fordoing,&rdquo; the absolutive or gerund in <em>tvāna</em>, as katvāna &ldquo;havingdone.&rdquo; These two terminations, however, occur only occasionally,the usual ones are the Sanskrit <em>tum</em> and <em>tvā</em>, The next two,<em>imassa</em>, genitive singular of <em>ageṃ</em>, and gonum, genitive plural of<em>go</em> &ldquo;a cow,&rdquo; I consider as made up by false analogy, as I havealready indicated; <em>tinnam</em>, genitive plural of <em>tri</em>, is similar. Then<em>vidū</em> from <em>vid</em>to know and meaning &ldquo;one who knows;&rdquo; divo,which is masculine in the Veda and in the Pali, while it isfeminine in Sanskrit; the Imperative first person plural in āmaseas in yamāmase, &ldquo;I shall or may restrain&rdquo; kasāmase, &ldquo;I shall ormay plough;&rdquo; the Imperfect akāof karoti from the Vedic akat.Pali has the Vedic I, but this is a sound natural under certaincircumstances, since we have it in Marathi and Gujarati, andkuham corresponding to the Vedio kuha. The Vedic Instrumentalplural termination of nouns in <strong>अ</strong>is retained in the Pali and alsocorrupted to ehi. Professor Childers, however, thinks it is</p>
<p>corrupted from the Sanskrit ablative bhyas. I agree with thosewho derive it from the Vedic affix. To these may be added thethe Prakrit <strong>कुणइ</strong> &ldquo;he does,&rdquo; in which there is a remnant of thefifth conjugation, while the root belongs to the eighth class; andalso the affix <strong>त्तण</strong>of abstract nouns, while it is <strong>त्व</strong> in ordinarySanskrit. Prakrit possesses <strong>तूण</strong> or <strong>ऊण</strong> corresponding to the Pali<strong>त्वान</strong> or <strong>तून</strong> and the instrumental affix <strong>एहि</strong>.</p>
<p>Then in another note Professor Childers gives the Pali garu&quot;heavy&rdquo; or &ldquo;great&quot;while Sanskrit has <strong>गुरु</strong>, though the <strong>गर</strong> appearsin the Sanskrit comparative and superlative forms <strong>गरीयस्</strong> and<strong>गरिष्ठ</strong>. The <strong>अ</strong>is seen in the Greek word Barus and Latin gravis.The Potential <strong>अस्स</strong> &ldquo;let him be,&rdquo; is also said not to have anythingto correspond to it in Sanskrit; but it may be traced to the Vedicsubjunctive or <strong>लेट्, असत्</strong>, or regarded as a corruption of <strong>अस्यात्</strong> forSanskrit <strong>स्यात्</strong>, the <strong>अ</strong>though dropped in Sanskrit being broughtover by analogy from the singular of the other tenses. He alsogives <strong>इध</strong>, while Sanskrit has <strong>इह</strong>, which is doubtful, and also<strong>सब्बधि</strong> &ldquo;everywhere&rdquo; the <strong>धि</strong>in which corresponds to fi in someGreek words. The Pali <strong>धि</strong>is the locative singular of the root,the instrumental singular of which is preserved in the Sanskrit<strong>धा</strong> in <strong>एकधा</strong>, <strong>पञ्चधा</strong> &amp;c. Of these the Prakrits have <strong>गर</strong> in suchwords as <strong>गरुअ, गारव</strong>, &amp;c., and <strong>इध</strong>.</p>
<p>Here the question is reduced to a point. Two-fifths of thewords in the Pali are pure Sanskrit, the rest are corrupt Sanskrit,while there are about six or seven forms which are lost inClassical Sanskrit but exist in Vedic Sanskrit; and there are one or two which exist in neither. The dialect then from which thePali was corrupted or immediately sprang, granting for a momentthat it was different from the Sanskrit, had two-fifths of its wordsexactly like those in Sanskrit, and the other three-fifths fromwhich the Pali corruptions were derived were also exactly likeSanskrit, but it contained these eight or nine forms whichSanskrit has lost. In other words, Pali itself, if we take theoriginal forms of the corrupt three-fifths of its words intoconsideration, is exactly like Sanskrit but for these nine forms.Is the dialect for this difference to be considered an independent dialect ? Is the distinction enough to entitle the Pali or its</p>
<p>supposed immediate parent to be considered a dialect, that is, alanguage, elaborated, according to the definition given before,from the ancient speech by a community distinct from that whichelaborated the Sanskrit ? If any one thinks it is, he may do so,and regard the Pali as a distinct dialect; but he must for thesame reason consider Surat Gujarati and Ahmedabad GujaratiKonkani Marathi and Deccani Marathi or the Marathi, Gujarati,English and any other language as spoken by the uneducatedclasses of the population, and as spoken by the educated, to bedistinct dialects of the same ancient speech. In the samecommunity, as I have observed, varieties of speech may or doprevail and must prevail, but the distinction between them isnot enough to constitute them distinct dialects; wherefore.Sanskrit and the immediate parent of the Pali or the uncorruptPall must be considered as one language, even though the lattercontained a few more ancient forms, and if both were one, thePali must be regarded as the daughter of Sanskrit and not itssister. Some of its few peculiarities it may have derived from thespoken variety of Sanskrit, and the rest from that in use amongthe inferior classes. It often happens that the lower classessometimes retain an old word or form after it has been given upby those above them, whence it is likely that the Pali wascorrupted from the language of those classes. And as a matterof fact it was for a long time the speech of the uneducated, aswill be presently shown. These observations apply to the laterPrakrits also; wherefore, if these derived languages were spoken,that from which they were derived, i. e., Sanskrit, must havebeen a spoken language also.</p>
<p>And, independently of this consideration, there is positive evidence that Sanskrit was a spoken language. Yāska in the Niruktafrequently refers to the Vedic dialect and to another called Bhāṣā,the peculiarities of which mentioned by him are observable inClassical Sanskrit. Pāṇini in his Grammar gives a good manyrules which are exclusively applicable to the dialect of the Vedas,to which he refers by using the words Chandas, Nigama, Mantraand Brāhmṇa, and others which are applicable to the Bhāṣāalone,but by far the largest number of his Sūtras have reference to both.Now, since Bhāṣā, or the ordinary Sanskrit, is thus distinguished</p>
<p>from the dialect of the Vedas, it must be the language in use atthe time when these writers lived. &ldquo;Bhāṣā,&rdquo; as used by them,is a proper name, but in later Sanskrit it acquired a genericsignification and meant language generally. The root from which the word is derived, signifies &ldquo;to speak,&rdquo; wherefore the originalsense of the word as a proper noun must have been the &ldquo;speech&quot;or &ldquo;the spoken language.&rdquo; And, because this was its signification, it afterwards came to denote &ldquo;explanation.&rdquo; When we askfor an explanation of something that is obsoure and unintelligible,what we mean is that the sense should be expressed to us in theordinary language of men, a language that we can understand.Thus such a sentence as <strong>स्थितप्रज्ञस्य का भाषा</strong>,means &ldquo;what is theVernacular of <strong>स्थितप्रज्ञ</strong>,&rdquo; an expression similar to &ldquo;what is theEnglish of it ?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pāṇini refers certain points expressly to popular usage. Hesays that the names of countries are conventional, and no grammatical analysis should be given of them, because it is fictitious;these should be used as we find them used. Similarly he saysgrammarians should not make rules to teach such things as these:—That the two words of a compound express the thing denoted bythe principal word as qualified by the sense of the subordinateword; as for instance, <strong>राजपुरुष</strong>, a compound of <strong>राजन्</strong> &ldquo;a king&rdquo; and<strong>पुरुष</strong>&ldquo;a man,&rdquo; does not denote &ldquo;a king,&rdquo; but &quot; a man, and not&quot;man&rdquo; <em>alone</em> but as <em>connected with a king</em>, i. e. a king&rsquo;s man orofficer and that the base and the termination express the sense ofthe termination as qualified by that of the base;as <strong>औपगव</strong> signifiesnot <strong>उपगु</strong>but a child, and not a child <em>alone</em> but a child as <em>connectedwith</em><strong>उपगु</strong>i. e. Upagu&rsquo;s child. For the significations of words areto be learnt from usage.</p>
<p>In the introduction to the Mahābhāṣya Patañjali tells us thatsome persons in his or Kātyāyana&rsquo;s time considered the study ofgrammar to be unnecessary. For said they, &ldquo;Vedic words orforms we know from the Veda, and those current in popular usagefrom that usage; grammar is useless.&ldquo;Now the grammar whichis thus declared useless is the grammar both of the Vedic andClassical Sanskrit; and the depreciators of the science profess toderive a knowledge of the first dialect from the Vedic books, andof the second not from other books but from popular usage. Hence</p>
<p>Sanskrit must have been in the time of those two grammariansa spoken language.</p>
<p>Similarly in the passage from the same work which I placedbefore you in the first lecture, you will remember that the objector(or Pūrvapakṣin) argues that, since usage is the authority uponwhich the grammarians go, certain verbal forms which are nolonger used by people ought not to be taught by the grammarions,and says that instead of those verbal forms participles are employed. The principal teacher (Siddhāntin) does not deny thefacts, but refers the objector to the vast literature of the language,where he may find them used, though obsolete at the time. It isevident from the whole passage, that Sanskrit was then a spokenlanguage though some of its verbal forms had fallen into desuetude. I have also shown that the language was considerablychanged between the times of Pāṇini and Kātyāyans, and havecalled the Sanskrit that prevailed when Pāṇini and Yāska flourished Middle Sanskrit, and that which was current in the timeof Kātyāyana, Classical Sanskrit. Now these changes from theone form to the other could not have taken place if the languagehad been dead or petrified into a merely literary language.</p>
<p>I am at a loss to see why some scholars should find it sodifficult to belive that Sanskrit was a vernacular. If its declensions and conjugations are considered too complicated for thelanguage of everyday life, it must not be forgotten that sucha fact did not prevent the ancient languages of Europe from becoming spoken languages. And this objection would do equallywell against the Vedic dialect, which or others like which, areregarded as the vernaculars of their times, and which are richerin inflexions than the later Sanskrit. Then it is held that theartificial regularity of Sanskrit makes it improbable that it shouldhave been a vernacular. Where is this artificial regularity ? Onthe contrary, it is the absence of regularity that renders its grammar so difficult and complicated. There is a freedom in thechoice of words, expressions, and forms. In every department ofits grammar there are innumerable optional forms;nouns andverbal roots are often declined and conjugated in several ways.One same root in a good many cases forms its special tenses inmore ways than one, and in the nominal derivatives, the verbal</p>
<p>derivatives, the formation of the feminine and the uses of casesand tenses there is a freedom which some may consider a license.The only difference is, that Sanskrit has had the most perfectgrammarians in the world, who observed all the facts of theirlanguage and laid them down as unchangeable fact, and it is thiswhich gives that language a stiffened appearance.</p>
<p>Then Saṁdhis or euphonic combinations of letters, whichare necessary in Sanskrit, are regarded as inconsistent with thecharacter of a spoken language. It is, however, not denied thatsuch combinations are observable in all languages, and particularly so in Latin and Greek; but it is urged that in Sanskritthere is a regularity or universality about them which is notfound anywhere else. It should not, however, be forgotten thatSaṁdhi in the same word and the same compound, and of a preposition with a root is alone necessary. Between different wordsit is optional, which means that it was on occasions neglected.Now Saṁdhi in the same word is necessary by a law of nature.The Sanskrit does not allow a hiatus; and this is a characteristicof most of the modern idioms also. Some languages, such as ourPrakrits and the old languages of Europe, tolerate it. But theeuphonic combination of consonants in the same word is necessory even in Latin; as in rex=reg-s, scriptus scrib-tus,cinctum=cing-tum, lectum=leg-tum, tractum from traho, thoughthe h like the Sanskrit <strong>ह</strong> stands for an original gh; d and t combine to form an s, as defendo, defensum; sedeo, sessum; claudo,clausum; &amp;c. Prepositions are really parts of words, and henceby the same law, they also must form one harmonious sound withthe initial letter of the word to which they are attached; andmodern vernaculars have got corruptions of the combined words,which shows that they must have been used in those forms in thecolloquial Sanskrit; thus Sk., <strong>पर्यन्त</strong>, Pr. <strong>पल्लट्ट</strong>, M. <strong>पाल</strong>ट; Sk. <strong>प्रत्यभिजाना</strong>,Pr. <strong>पच्चहिआण</strong>, H. <strong>पहिचान</strong>; Sk. <strong>अत्यर्थ</strong>, Pr. <strong>अञ्चट्ट</strong>, M. <strong>अचाट</strong>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Now, as to compounds, this peculiarity of the Sanskrit hasbeen carried to an extravagant extent by later writers, but Päṇiniallows only certain formations of this nature. These grew up asindependent words in the language, and hence in the matter ofSaṁdhi were treated like other words. In the spoken languagethe euphonic combinations we have been considering were not</p>
<p>consciously made, but the words themselves acquired those formsby habitual use in the same manner as in other tongues. Thegrammarians, however, discovered and laid down these rules;and the practice of using them in books even in combininingdifferent words gained ground, though, however, many instancesin which there is no such Saṁdhi are found in the Itihäsasand the Purāṇas. But if in colloquial speech such a combinationwas not possible, the grammarians do not enjoin that it should bemade; and very probably it was not made.</p>
<p>And traces of many expressions, which only a colloquial useof language can generate, have been preserved, not so much inthe literature, as by the grammarians. Such is one expressive ofan intensive or excessive action, composed of the Imperativesecond person form of a root repeated, followed by a verbal formof the same in any tense of the Indicative and in any person ornumber; as <strong>खाद खादेति खादति</strong>, lit. &ldquo;eat, ent, he eats,&rdquo; i. e. eats much,<strong>कुरु कुर्विति करोति</strong> &ldquo;do, do, he does,&rdquo; i. e. does much. This expression exists in Marathi and is considered so colloquial that noMarathi grammarian has noticed it, as <strong>खा खा खातो, कर कर करतो</strong>,inwhich, as in Sanskrit, <strong>खा</strong> and <strong>कर</strong> are forms of the Imperativesecond person singular.</p>
<p>A similar expression is used when several actions are attributed to the same agent; as <strong>ओदनं</strong> <strong>भुङ्क्षसक्तून पिबधानाः खादेत्येवायमभ्यवहरति</strong>&ldquo;Eat rice, drink barely water, devour fried grain, in this wayhe fills his stomach; &quot; which in Marathi is a <strong>भात जेव पेज पी लाह्या खा असें पोढ भरतो</strong>.In this case the Indicative should signify a generalaction of which the Imperatives denote the species, and we mayhave here <strong>करोति</strong> &ldquo;does instead of <strong>अभ्यवहरति</strong>.</p>
<p>Similarly those innumerable expressions consisting of a formmade up by adding <strong>अम्</strong>, technically <strong>णमुल्</strong>, to a root, preceded by anoun, and of a verbal form of the same root must be colloquial;as <strong>हस्तग्राहं गृह्णाति</strong>&ldquo;holds by the hand,&rdquo; <strong>जीवनाशं नश्यति</strong> &ldquo;he perishes,&rdquo;<strong>उदरपूरं भुङ्क्ते</strong>&ldquo;eats o stomachful,&rdquo; <strong>यथाकारमहं भोक्ष्येतथाकारं भोक्ष्येकि तवानेन</strong>&ldquo;I will eat as I eat&rsquo;(as I like), what have you to do with it ?&quot;&amp;c.Etymologically <strong>हस्ताग्राहम्,जीवनाशम्</strong> &amp;c. are accusatives, and theymay in these cases be called cognate accusatives, and the expressions somewhat resemble such ones in English, as &ldquo;run a race,&ldquo;&ldquo;walk a walk, &quot; &ldquo;die a death,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p>The compounds <strong>दण्डादण्डि, केशाकेशि</strong>&amp;c., meaning &ldquo;a scuffle inwhich there is a brandishing of sticks and seizing each other bythe hair,&rdquo; and a great many others made up of Imperative formsof verbs,or of a verb and its object, which are used as nouns, areof a nature suited for the purposes of a light conversation; as <strong>अत्रखादतमोदता वर्तते</strong> &rsquo;eat and enjoy is the rule here,&rdquo; <strong>अत्राश्नौतपिबता वर्तते</strong>&quot;&rsquo;eat and drink&rsquo; is the rule here,&rdquo; sengon,&rdquo; <strong>उद्धरोत्मृजा तस्य दानशौण्डीरस्य गृहे</strong>&ldquo;&ldquo;take out and give&rsquo; is what takes place in the house of thatbountiful man,&rdquo;<strong>जहिस्तम्बोयम्</strong>&ldquo;he is one who constantly says,&lsquo;strike the sheafs of corn&rdquo;.<strong>एहिस्वागता वर्तते</strong> &quot; &lsquo;come, welcome to&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p>Sanskrit was not the only language spoken in the times ofKātyāyana and Patañjali. In the Mahābhāṣya there are severalpassages which contain allusions to a dialect arising from a corruption of Sanskrit. Thus, in the comment on the Vārtika: SiddheŚabdārthasaṁbandhe: we are told, with reference to the question, whether words are created or exist of themselves, that Pāṇini&rsquo;srules suppose that they are not created but exist of themselves;and sois the relation between them and the things they denote,i. e. their power of expression, uncreated and self-existent, and, according to another interpretation of the Vārtiks, the thingsalso which words denote are so. How is it known that all theseare self-existent? Because in the affairs of the world or in ordinary life men think of certain things and use words to expressthem; they do not set about producing words before doing so.But this is not the case with those things that are created andself-existent. If a man wishes to do something with an earthernpot, he goes to the house of a potter and says,&ldquo;Make a pot forme, I have to do something by its means.&ldquo;Now, if he has touse words, he does not in the same way go to the house of agrammarian and say, &ldquo;Make words, I want to use them; butimmediately that he thinks of this thing and that he uses words[for expressing them]. Weil then, if words are to be taken fromordinary life [and are not made by grammarians], what is it thatthe Śāstra [grammar] does? &ldquo;The Śāstra lays down a restrictionby observing which a man may attain religious merit. It doeswhat other Śāstras in ordinary life do. Thus, while it is possibleto satisfy hunger by eating anything whatever, it is enjoined that</p>
<p>one shall not est a domesticated fowl or pig; and the object is,that he may by regulating his conduct thus attain religiousmerit. In the same way this Śāstra (grammar) tells us that,while it is possible to express one&rsquo;s meaning by using correctwords or incorrect words, correct ones alone which it teachesshould be used to secure the religious merit arising therefrom.&ldquo;After this follows the discussion translated in the first lecture;and then we have another of which the following is a portion:—</p>
<p>PŪRV. Does religious merit arise from a knowledge of correctwords or from their use ?</p>
<p>SID. What is the difference ?</p>
<p>PŪRV. If you say religious merit arise from their knowledge,religious de-merit also must arise. For he, who knows what wordsare correct, also knows what words are incorrect. If merit resultsfrom the knowledge of those that are correct, demerit must resultfrom the knowledge of those that are incorrect. Or greater de-meritmust arise [from their knowledge], as the number of incorrectwords is larger, and that of correct words smaller. For the corruptions of one correct word are manifold; as, for instance, the corruptions of the correct word <strong>गो</strong> are <strong>गावी, गोणी, गोता</strong>, <strong>गोपोतलिका</strong> &amp;c.And the Ṛṣi also indicates (in a passage which is quoted) thatthe restriction as to correct words concerns their use [and notknowledge].</p>
<p>SID. Well, then, let it be that religious merit arises fromtheir use [and not from knowledge ].</p>
<p>PŪRV. If from their use, the whole world would obtainheavenly folicity.</p>
<p>SID. And now why should you be jealous if the whole worldobtain heavenly felicity ?</p>
<p>PŪRV. No, certainly, I am not jealous. But what I mean is,that it thus becomes useless to make any effort; such effort onlyas is fruitful should be made. If you get the fruit without anyeffort, the effort is useless. [The effort meant is that involved in the study of grammar, i. e, of correct words. People use somecorrect words at least without studying grammar, and, if eternalfelicity results from the <em>use</em> of such words, they get it withoutmaking the effort of studying the subject ].</p>
<p>SID. Why, verily those who make the effort will largely usecorrect words, and will obtain a large amount of heavenly felicity.</p>
<p>PŪRV. That the fruit does not follow the effort is also an observed fact. For there are persons who though they have madethe effort are seen to be incompetent [in the use of correct words],while others, who have not, are competent; wherefore it is possible, the fruit, i. e. heavenly felicity, may not follow.</p>
<p>SID. Well then, religious merit arises not from knowledgealone, neither from use alone.</p>
<p>PŪRV. From what then ?</p>
<p>SID. Heavenly felicity arises from the use of correct wordswhen it is accompanied by the knowledge, that they are correct,derived from a study of the Śāstra.</p>
<p>And thus it goes on.</p>
<p>Now it is clear from all this that correct words, i. e. Sanskrit,was spoken in those days by all, but that incorrect words had gotmixed up with it, and the object of grammar was to teach howto avoid incorrect words or corruptions, though there were menwho could speak correctly without knowing grammar. And thisis the state in which more or less all languages are at all times;and even at the present day the purpose of grammar is consideredto be to teach how to speak correctly. By the way, it will be seenhow Sanskrit grammariens disilnelly declare that they teach nothing that does not exist, that they do not create words, but separate the correct ones from suoi as are incorrect. But what didPatañjalii consider to he the standard of correct Sanskrit : whowas it that spoke the language correctly, and in whose speechwere corruptions observable ? This is clear from another passage at the beginning of the third pāda of the first chapter of theMahābhāṣya. Patañjali interprets the Sūtra <strong>भूवादयो धातवः</strong>(I. III 1)in a manner to yield such a connotative definition of a dhātu orroot as this, that a dhātu is that which denotes action or being.Then a question is raised, if this is the way to distinguish a rootwhy should a list of roots be given; in other words, if we havegot a connotative definition, a definition by enumeration is notwanted. In this case there is a difference of opinion betweenKātyāyana and Patañjali.</p>
<p>PŪRV. If you have given a connotative definition now, enumeration should not be made, i. e. a list of roots should not begiven.</p>
<p>SID. It should be made.</p>
<p>PŪRV. What for ?</p>
<p>SID. The enumeration of [the verbal roots] bhi and othersshould be made for the purpose of excluding nouns (Prātipadika)and the verbs that begin with <strong>आणपयति</strong>[.e. If the roots are notactually enumerated, nouns also which express action or beingmay come under the the connotative definition. In the same wayit will extend to roots used in ordinary life, which are not Sanskrit, such as <strong>आणपयति</strong> and others].</p>
<p>PŪRV. What verbs are those which begin with <strong>आणपयति</strong> ?</p>
<p>SID. <strong>आणपयति</strong> and <strong>वड्ढति</strong>. And enumeration should alsobe made in order that the anubandhas or indicatory letters andaccents of roots may be made known; <em>i. e.</em> that one may knowwhat the accents and indicatory letters of roots are. It is not possibe to know the accents or indicatory letters unless the rootsare enumerated. [Anubandhas are certain letters attached toroots to denote some, conjugational or other peculiarity belongingto them ].</p>
<p>PŪRV. Now those roots whose accents are capsple of beinginferred. <em>i. e.</em>, are <strong>उदात्त</strong>, and which have no anubandhas, but stillare inserted in the list, may be omitted from it. [i. e. When thoseroots which have the <strong>अनुदात्त</strong> accent are enumerated, it may beinferred that the rest have the other or <strong>उदात्त</strong>accent ].</p>
<p>SID. Even those should be enumerated in order that <strong>आणपयति</strong>and others [i. e., corrupt Sanskrit roots) may be excluded.</p>
<p>Hereupon Patañjali disagrees with Kātyāyans and says:—</p>
<p>PAT. NO, <strong>आणपयति</strong> and others will be excluded, because theusage of the educated or Śiṣṭas is to be followed. This usage ofthe Śiṣṭas must be necessarily referred to in other cases even;for instance, in order to exclude the altered forms of those rootsthat are enumerated. For in ordinary life they use <strong>कसि</strong>for <strong>कृषि</strong>and <strong>दिसि</strong>for <strong>दृशि</strong>. [The sense is, that since in grammar we followthe usage of the Śiṣṭas or educated, these verbs <strong>आणपयति, वट्टति</strong></p>
<p>and <strong>बड्ढति</strong>, and also <strong>कसि</strong> for <strong>कृषि</strong> and <strong>दिसि</strong> for <strong>दृशि</strong> which sre notused by them, will necessarily be excluded from our connotativedefinition; hence for the purpose of excluding them enumerationis not wanted].</p>
<p>Now <strong>आणपयति</strong> is a corruption of the Sanskrit <strong>आज्ञापयति, वट्टति</strong>of <strong>वर्तते,</strong> and <strong>वट्ठति</strong>of <strong>वर्धते, ते</strong> Ātm. being replaced by <strong>ति</strong>Parasm., and<strong>कम्</strong> for <strong>कृष्</strong>, and <strong>दिम्</strong>for <strong>दृश्</strong>. These and such other corruptionswere in use at the time, but Patañjali clearly lays down that theywere not used by the Śiṣṭas or educated people, and thereforethey belonged to the language of the vulgar. Now all these rootsare found in the Pali in these very forms, <strong>आणपयति</strong>being, however, <strong>आणापयति</strong>; but the reading in the MSS. and the Benareslithographed edition which I have consulted is faulty. So alsoof the corruptions of the word <strong>गो</strong>given by our author, we find<strong>गावी</strong> in Professor Childers&rsquo;s Pali Dictionary, and <strong>गोण</strong>the masculine of <strong>गोणी</strong>. Thus our grammarians recognise one language only,the Sanskrit, and these words and forms which are found in thePali they assign to the speech of the vulgar.</p>
<p>In another passage still we are told more definitely who theŚiṣṭas were that spoke the Sanskrit language correctly withoutstudying Pāṇini&rsquo;s grammar, and whose usage was the standardof correctness. Pāṇini&rsquo;s Sūtra VI. III, 109, lays down that suchwords as <strong>पृषोदर</strong>should be regarded as correct in the form in whichthey are upadiṣṭa, i. e, used or uttered; the changes in them suchas the elision, or augmentation, of letters or the alteration oftheir forms do not obey any general rules laid down by him, butstill the words exhibiting those changes should be taken as correct, just as they are used. Now the Pūrvapakṣin raises thequestion :—</p>
<p>PŪRV. What is meant by upadiṣṭa ?</p>
<p>SID. Uttered (used).</p>
<p>PŪRV. How does it come to mean that ?</p>
<p>SID. The root &lsquo;dis&rsquo; signifies &lsquo;uttering&rsquo;. One utters (uses),letters, and says that they are thus upadiṣṭa.</p>
<p>PŪRV. By whom upadiṣṭa(uttered or used) ?</p>
<p>SID. By the Śiṣṭas.</p>
<p>PŪRV. Who are the Śiṣṭas ?</p>
<p>SID. The grammarians.</p>
<p>PŪRV, How so ?</p>
<p>SID. The character of a Śiṣṭa is conferred upon one by theknowledge of the science (Śāstra):and the grammarians know thescience [of grammar].</p>
<p>PŪRV. If a man is made Śiṣṭa by the science, and the sciencedepends upon a man&rsquo;s being Śiṣṭa, this is reasoning in a circle.An argument in a circle does not hold. [The circle is, one is Śiṣṭa,and consequently an authority in matters of language if he hasstudied grammar and grammar itself depends on the usage ofthe Śiṣṭa.]</p>
<p>SID. Well, then, the character of a Śiṣṭa is conferred uponone by the country in which he lives and by his conduct. Thatsort of conduct must be associated with residence in Āryāvartaalone (lit. that sort of conduct must be in Āryāvarta alone).</p>
<p>PŪRV. Which is Āryāvarta ?</p>
<p>SID. The country which is to the east of the Ādarśa, west ofKālkavans, south of the Himālaya, and north of the Pāriyātra.Those Brahmans in this country of the Āryas who do not store upriches (lit. who keep only so much grain as la contained in a jar).who are not greedy, who do good disinterestedly, and who withoutany effort are conversant with a certain branch of knowledge arethe worshipful Śiṣṭas.</p>
<p>PŪRV. If, then, the Śiṣṭas are an authority as regards language, what function does the Aṣṭādbyāyī(Pāṇini&rsquo;s grammar)perform ?</p>
<p>SID. The purpose of the Aṣṭādbyāyī is to enable us to findout the Śiṣṭas.</p>
<p>PŪRV. How is it possible to find out the Śiṣṭas by means ofthe Aṣṭādbyāyī ?</p>
<p>SID. A student of the Aṣṭādbyāyī finds a man who has notstudied the book using words just as they are taught in theAṣṭādbyāyī. He then thinks, &ldquo;Verily, this man possesses somegood luck or innate nature by means of which, though he has not</p>
<p>studied the Aṣṭādbyāyī, he uses words just as they are taught inthat book. Verily he knows other words also &quot; [not taught in theAṣṭādbyāyī, such as <strong>पृषोदर</strong>]. Thus, the purpose of the Aṣṭādbyāyīis to enable one to find out who is a Śiṣṭa [in order that he mayrefer to him and learn such words as do not obey the rules laiddown by Pāṇini, but still are correct].</p>
<p>Here then we have the clearest possible evidence that Sanskritwas the vernacular of holy or respectable Brahmans of Āryāvartaor Northern India, who could speak the language correctlywithout the study of grammar. The corrupt language mentionedby Patañjali which was composed of correct and incorrect words,that is, a dialect like the Pali, must, therefore, have been thevernacular of the other classes. And this is what you may sayeven with regard to the modern vernaculars. Who is it thatspeaks good or correct Marathi ? Of course, Brahmans of culture. The language of the other classes is not correct Marathi. Theword Śiṣṭa may be translated by &ldquo;a man of education or culture;&ldquo;and this education or culture has, since remote times, been almostconfined to Brahmans.</p>
<p>Thus the dialects of the Inscriptions of Aśoka and the Paliwere the vernaculars of the non-Brahmanic classes; but a greaterimportance must evidently have been attached to them in thetimes of Aśoka than is now assigned to the Marathi of the non-Brahmanic classes, since they are used by him in the Inscriptions.They are, however, not recognized as independent languages byour grammarians who treated them as we treat the Marathi ofthe lower classes; but they were in use and bore the same relationto Sanskrit that low Marathi does to high Marathi, the Englishof the lower classes in England to the speech of the higher. Andthe English of the lower classes contains, as we have seen, agreat many such grammatical forms as &ldquo;I knowed,&rdquo; and &ldquo;yousays, &ldquo;along with others that are correct.</p>
<p>It is on account of the mixture of such correct words and formswith others that were incorrect that the Pali was not regardedas an independent dialect. The case was different with thePrakrits They assumed a more settled and fixed character, andwere used over a larger area, and thus came to be considered and</p>
<p>treated as separate languages. But the propagators of Buddhism,who like all teachers of a new religion, addressed themselves tothe lower or uneducated classes, soon raised this speech intoimportance. They wrote their religious works in it, and in thecourse of time it became their sacred language; but it isunknown in India as an independent tongue. From thesepassages in the Mahābhāṣya, therefore, it is clear that it is by nomeans true, us is generally supposed, that Sanskrit had ceasedto be a spoken language when the Pali arose. The two varietiesof speech existed side by side; but as education and cultureretrograded, the number of Sanskrit speakers gradually decreased,and the lower variety went on spreading itself over a wider areaand developed into the Prakrits.</p>
<p>This contemporaneous existence of the Sanskrit and Pali andthe Prakrits as the spoken languages of two classes of thecommunity explains, and is therefore confirmed by, several factsthat we noticed before. If, when the Pall arose, Sanskrit becamea dead language, it could not influence the grammar of the lowdialects. Though words from a language that has ceased to bespoken may be adopted into a spoken dialect, the grammarremains intact. Even a living language if it is foreign, does notaffect it. But we have seen that the gradual disappearance ofverbal forms is a phenomenon common to both Sanskrit and Paliand that the latter derived some grammatical forms from theformer, which did not possess when they were in the stagerepresented by the Pali. This could not have been the case if thetwo languages, Sanskrit and Pali, bad not existed as two varietiesof the varnaculars of a homogeneous community.</p>
<p>The fact that Sanskrit words are so greatly corrupted as tobe difficult of recognition and are set down as Deśyas by thenative grammarians, while others can easily be traced to theiroriginal forms, also points to the same conclusion. Those thatare greatly corrupted were early adopted into the language, andremoved from subsequent influence. Most of the others, thatexhibit only ordinary changes, are such as denote elementarynotions, and must therefore have been adopted as early as thoseof the first sort. But, because they were such elementary wordsthey were heard again and again in their original forms as used</p>
<p>by the higher classes; and thus a further corruption was prevented; and they exhibit only such changes as were necessitated bythe vocal habits of the Prakrit speakers.</p>
<p>Another fact is the use of Sanskrit for the higher charactersin the plays, and Prakrit for women and the lower ones. Thissupposes that when the idea first originated, and for a considerable period subsequent to it, though not afterwards whendramatic plays were written more according to rule than with aview to exhibit any existing state of things women and personsin a low condition could understand Sanskrit, but not speak it.It was the same with Sanskrit then, as it is with Marathi, forinstance, now. A Citpāvanīor Mālvaṇīwoman speaks in herown dialect when conversing with an educated Marathi butunderstands the standard Marathi that he uses, though she cannotspeak it herself. And this is the case everywhere; a person in alow condition understands what is said to him by one belongingto the higher classes, but cannot himself speak like him, andmust use his own variety of the language. Thus then at thetime when the earliest Sanskrit dramatic plays were written, thatlanguage must have been in vernacular use to such an extentas to be intelligible to uneducated persons. And that educateddramatic characters do actually speak it, shows that those whomthey represent used it in real life. Again, the dramas werecomposed to entertain an audience, and were actually acted. Ifthe audience did not understand Sanskrit, as well as Prakrit, thepoet defeated his own purpose by making some of his charactersspeak in that language.</p>
<p>Sanskrit went on gradually losing ground, the number of thosewho speak it grew smaller and smaller, and after a time it ceasedto be used by anybody for the ordinary concerns of life, thougheven now Paṇḍits carry on their disputations in it. But at alltimes it has been acting the parent to the vernaculars and adorning and enriching them. The ancient Prakrits borrowed everything from it when it was in vernacular use; but the modernPrakrits mostly adopt such words as express abstract notions.There is, however, an apparent difference in the manner in whichthe borrowed words were treated by the Prakrits, and are treatedby the modern dialects. A Sanskrit word when used by</p>
<p>a Prakrit-speaking person was changed according to his habitsof pronunciation; but in modern times it is preserved in a stateof purity. This, however, is due to the fact that in modern timesthe educated classes as well as their uneducated brethren, speakthe vernaculars, and it is the former that pronounce the wordproperly. But the latter, and often women belonging to theformer, corrupt it. Now the Prakrit was, as I have shown, for along time the language of precisely these persons. It is theirpronunciation that is recorded by the Prakrit grammarians andpoets. In some provinces in modern times, even the higher classesmispronounce the Sanskrit words adopted into the vernaculars,and also in reading Sanskrit books. But in the printed booksthe correct orthography is used.</p>
<p>As I have observed in a previous lecture and at the beginningof this, some of the vocal habits of the Prakrit speakers havecome down to their modern descendants: but not all. The lapseof time and other causes have generated other peculiarities.Hence a Sanskrit word in these days is not corrupted in exactlythe same way as in ancient times; and thus we get what arecalled modern Tadbhavas. Thus, then, as the Sindhi and Bengalicannot but pronounce Sanskrit <strong>मोक्ष</strong> as <strong>मोक्ख</strong>,and the Hindustanias <strong>मोछ</strong>,or the average Gujarati, the Sanskrit word <strong>मौन</strong> as <strong>मोक्ष</strong>, and <strong>जैन</strong>as <strong>जेन</strong>, so did his old Prakrit ancestors.</p>
<p>It should be borne in mind that the Prakrit corruption ofSanskrit words were not necessarily caused by their continualuse for a number of ages, but were due in a good many cases tothe vocal peculiarities of the men that used them. Most of thosewords that represent only the ordinary changes are words of thisclass; i. e. the corruptions simply represent, as I have above observed, the transformation which they underwent in the mouthof &amp; Prakrit speaker. At all times Sanskrit words have beencoming into the popular languages; but in old times they were pronounced in a manner natural to the men of these times, andthus became Prakrit words; and now they are pronounced insome cases in the same manner, but in a great many in another,and thus they become modern Tadbhavas; while the educatedclasses often, though not always, pronounce them correctly, and</p>
<p>thus we have modern Tatsamas. This is the way to accountfor the fact that there are so many pure Sanskrit words in ourvernaculars, while there were but a few in the old Prakrits; andwe need not connect their introduction with the expulsion ofBuddhism and the selfish schemes of the Brahmans, with whichit has nothing to do, as is done by one writer.</p>
<p>We will now try to form some idea of the chronology andhistorical causes of the several linguistic changes we have noticed.The Later or Classical Sanskrit is in the same phonetic conditionas the Vedic dialect from which it sprang; and it was for a longsuccession of centuries, spoken by the Indian Aryans. If it wasso, the corruptions observable in the other variety of speech orlow Sanskrit, as it may be called, must have been due to thevocal peculiarities of another race than that which elaboratedthe Classical from the Vedic Sanskrit. The univeral assimilationof conjunot consonants which we observe in the Pali could nothave proceeded from the same community that could speakSanskrit with purity. And such an extensive assimilation wefind in the Italian, which was formed out of the Latin spoken bythe lower classes of the ancient Roman population by the barbarianraces that overran the country. As remarked in the openinglecture, phonetic corruption is rapid and extensive when one.Taco learns and adopts the language of another. The Pali corruptions, therefore, represent the manner in which a foreign racepronounced the Sanskrit of the Aryans. And from such historyas we can glean from Sanskrit Literature, we know that the Aryanrace when it emigrated to India came in contact with other races.After a time some of these were incorporated into the Aryan community, and formed its fourth order, known by the name ofŚūdras. As long as these Sūdras were in thoroughly degradedcondition and remained distinct from the other three orders, theirspeech produced no perceptible effect on that of the latter. Butafter a time this order began to mingle with the rest, principallyby means of inter-marriages, which must have extensively takenplace, since some Smrtis or Indian law-books allow them undercertain circumstances and others prohibit them; so that theorthodox belief of learned Pandits at the present day is that theKṣatriya and Vaiśya orders do not exist, and that all those who</p>
<p>are not Brahmans are Śūdras. But there are indications thateven Brahmanhood did not escape pollution. As this combinationproceeded, the Śūdra corruptions of the language came into preminence, and after a time such a language as Pali became theordinary speech of the uneducated. By the time of Aśoka, wemay suppose, the so-called Aśiṣṭa or uneducated people, who spokethe incorrect, or corrupt language, comprehended among themthe greater portion of the military, trading, and cultivatingclasses. Professor Childers is of opinion that there are no Deśyaor non-Aryan words in the Pali. But the Prakrits do possess someat least, and you will remember that they exhibit other phoneticchanges of which the chief is the elision of consonants. Up tothe time of Aśoka and even to that of Patañjali, these phenomenaare not observable in the popular speech, though they may haveexisted in the speech of the very lowest classes. It, therefore,appears that, when this amalgamated community, with Sanskritand Pali as the two forms of speech prevailing among the higherand the lower classes, spread over different parts of NorthernIndia from the Himālayas to the southern confines of the Marathacountry, they came in contact in the provinces with other raceswhich led to the further corruptions we have been speaking of;and thus the Prakrits were formed. These new races while theyadopted the language of the conquerors gave them a few of theirown words.</p>
<p>Patañjali lived in the middle of the second century before.Christ and king Aśoka in the middle of the third. BetweenPatañjali and Kãtyāyanaa petty long time must have elapsed,since in the Mahābhāṣya various readings or emendations in afew cases of the Vārtikas of the latter are noticed and sometimestheir interpretations as given by other writers; so that a sort ofliterature must have grown round the Vārtikas. I am, therefore, inclined to accept the popular tradition which refers Kātyāyanatothe period of the Nandas, i. e., to about the first quarter of thefourth century before Christ. Now we have seen that in thetime of this grammarian the Sanskrit language assumed adifferent form from that it had in that of Pāṇini; and by thetime of Patañjali very great reverence had come to be paid tothis last author. For in giving the uses of grammar, the author</p>
<p>of the Mahābhāṣya says that it is the duty of a Brähmapa to studythe Vedas along with their Aṅgas or illustrative Śãstras; andof the six Aṅgas grammar is the chief. Patañjali is not likely toyield this honour to any other than Pāṇini&rsquo;s grammar. Toaccount for these and some of the other circumstances noticedby Dr. Goldstūcker, we must place Pāṇini ahout four centuriesbefore Kātyāyana, i. e. refer him to about the 8th century beforeChrist. Yäska must have flourished a short time before him. Though the Pali or an idiom very close to it was the language ofthe uneducated classes in the times of ātyāyans, Aśoka, andPatañjali, still its formation must be dated some centuries earliersince in its verb it represents what I have called Middle Sanskritor the Sanskrit of Yāska and Pāṇini. Yāśka notices local varietiesof Sanskrit words and gives one or two instances, but makes noallusion to any Apabhraṁśas or corruptions, though from thenature of his work he may be expected to do so; while Kātyāyanaand Patañjali mention them frequently, as we have seenif they existed in his time, therefore, they must have beeninsignificant and unimportant, and did not enter into the speechof any class of the Aryan society to any appreciable extent.After his time, however, i. e. about the seventh or sixth centuryB. C., the elaboration of the Pali, or Low Sanskrit as it might becalled, began in a decided manner; and the language continuedto be spoken up to the time of Patañjali. Till then it did notspecifically assume a Prakrit form though in the Inscriptions ofAśoka some of the characteristics of a later Prakrit, the Māgadhī,were developed, as we have seen, in one province, very likelyMagadha itself.</p>
<p>The Prakrits must have begun to be formed about that time,but did not then attain any distinctive character; and thevernacular speech probably did not finally leave the Pali stagetill a very long time afterwards. About the time when theInscriptions in the cave-temples were composed, the Pali was,as I have stated, a sacred and literary language. The longer andmore important of the Inscriptions are therefore in that language.But in a good many of the shorter Inscriptions, especially of private individuals, we have words exhibiting Prakrit characteristics<sup id="fnref1:133"><a href="#fn:133" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">133</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The growth of the specifio Prakrits, therefore, must be referredto the early centuries of the Christain era; and we maytherefore infer that about the time our first dramatic plays werewritten they were actually the spoken dialects of those classes ofthe people whose representatives use them in those works,… .</p>
<p>About the sixth or seventh century the Apabhraṁśa wasdeveloped in the country in which the Brajbhäṣäprevails inmodern times; or, if the speeches in that dialect contained in thefourth act of the Vikramorvaśiya were really composed by Kālidāsa, which, as remarked in a former lecture, we have the gravestreasons for doubting, its growth must be assigned to a somewhatearlier period. Daṇḍin mentions the Apabhraṁśa, and a goodmany verses fiom his Kāvyādarśa are found in Vāmana&rsquo;sAlaṁkāravṛtti; and if this be the same Vāmana that lived atthe court of Jayäpiḍa, king of Kāsmir, who reigned from 751A. C. to 782 A. C., Daṇḍin must have flourished before the eighthcentury.</p>
<p>The Modern vernaculars seem to have begun to assume adistinctive character about the tenth century. In the CopperPlate Inseription containing the name of Bhāskarācārya, dated1128 Śaka or 1206 A. C., which I ones mentioned before, Marathisin its specific character, andso also does Hindi in thework of Cand, who flourished about the same time.</p>
<p>And now, gentlemen, I close. It was impossible in the course,of these lectures to do justice to the subject without entering intomatters which are not interesting, except to those who havealready paid some attention to it. Besides, the subject was wideand I was compelled to compress a great many facts into a smallspace, but in spite of this, and though I frequently omitted large,portions of what I had written, the lectures were long and tedious.I am, therefore, obliged to you for the honour you have done meby your presence here, notwithstanding these drawbacks, and mythanks are specially due to those who have attended the coursethroughout.</p>
