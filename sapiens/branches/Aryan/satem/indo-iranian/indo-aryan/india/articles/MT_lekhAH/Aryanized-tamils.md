IMO, despite the high-volume claims of Dravidianists and Dravidologists, in the earliest of the tamiL texts you already find a fullfledged Hindu system more or less the same as that practiced in more northern locales of the subcontinent. 

However, its transmission in the south was via two vehicles. There were the vaidika pArpAn-s/antaNar-s (v1) who bore the Sanskrit tradition and a more folk transmission, which like in other contact zones of the Indosphere used translation. 

Hence, I see names as mAyOn, mAl (viShNu) or murukan/cheyon (kumAra) as deshabhAShA descriptive renderings of the equivalent deities of greater H tradition. They are not IMO some legendary pre-Aryan Tamil deities.
