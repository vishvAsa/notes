**Select Opinions.**

**---------------**

 The aim of the book is to establish by textual quotations that the Srutis, Upanishads, Puranas and Ithihasas treat *only of the highly cosmopolitan science of yoga and the pratical philosophy of religion* and not of earthy history and geography as too often misinterpreted in modern times.

**The Times Literary Supplement, London:**

...........Its object is to show that the ancient religious texts.........deal only with practical religious philosophy and science of yoga; that they give no support.........to the interpretation of the text......as treating of the ancient history and geography of India..........

**F. W. Thomas Esquire, M. A. Hon: Ph. D. Librarian, India Office, London:**

...........I think there can be no doubt that the conceptions of history, geography &c., expounded in the *Puranas* and similar works are of a different order from the European ideas connected with these subjects, being throughout dominated by philosophic, religious and ethical purposes. A similar phenomenon is to be observed in the religious literature of other countries, where also a need has been felt for *interpretations on the lines of your own.* From this point of view I feel that you are doing a service to Sanskrit literature and the religious life of your country by dissociating them from the comparison with the common sense points of view of the modern system of study...........

**E. B. Havell Esquire, A. R. C. A. Late Principal, Calcutta School of Art and Keeper of the Art Gallery.**

............I think your idea of collecting authoritative texts and ofcommenting them is an excellent one. It illusteates Indian thought clearly and throws light on many obscure points.........

**Miss. E. C. Allison: The Vedic Mission Home.**

............I have been awake and in deep sympathy with all Indian books that bring out the *true* meanings and truth of your wonderful religion, science and philosophy.............. You *do* pull out the feather of the Westerns in splendid style, and I do thank you for it............

**Justice Sir G. N. Chandavarkar, Retired Justice of the High Court of Judicature Bombay.**

.............I have found it helpful and instructive. I intend going through the whole carefully and profiting from its contents.

**The Valia koil Tampuran; Consort to Her Highness the Senior Ranee of Travancore.**

The book is............a proof of your considerable acquaintance with Vedic and Puranic lore which unfortunately does not appear much to interest the present day Hindu writer......

**Pandit Gandi Rao Hanumant, Dharwar.**

.............I am much pleased to see the interpretation made by you for Kuru aud Kurukshetra.... Whatever you have written is *authorised by the Vedas.*

**Indian Emigrant.**

This is *an epoch-making book* which deserves to be carefully studied, digested and assimilated by every Hindu student, Oriental scholar, and Theosophist, and also by every student of comparative sociology....................

**M. R. Ry., R. Mahadeva Aiyer Avl. B. A. Dewan PeishkarTravancore.**

.................Your bitterest critics cannot but admire your deep schoolarship and earnestness of purpose which are writ large on every page of the book............ You have carefully fortified yourself against all attacks by unimpeachable authorities which will speak for themselves when approached with an earnest and unbiased mind ....................................................................................................................... ........................................................................................................................

**The Indian Patriot, Madras.**

.................The vast range of reading and study of details combined with a keen exercise of philosophical thought necessary for this novel undertaking will not appear to be in the least lacking if only a few pages of the book are carefully read through.........It may be specially mentioned here that the subject matter in the book is not one of local or provincial interest; but its usefulness will surely affect the whole of India and might interest all other civilised nations of the world..........

**United India & Native States.**

..................The author holds it a vanity to search for a historical background for the legends and stories narrated in the Puranas and endeavours to show by various quotations that they were all intended to supplement the Vedas and Upanishads. One is a bit startled to hear a firm conviction that all the Puranas are entirely free of incoherency, but it is perhaps due to our preoccupation...............

BHARATA VARSHA.**

**————**

** C**URIOUS and paradoxical as the title may appear at the very outset, it is my earnest wish and prayer that all Hindus interested in their ancient country, literature and religion, as well as those desirous of knowing Indian affairs better, will kindly condescend to peruse, at least as a pas-time, this little essay, which with all its unavoidably serious defects may be assured to be the humblest product of several years continued and anxious efforts.

 It is not possible nor perhaps desirable to explain in the very beginning the exact purport of the whole, but it is hoped that the mere reading of a few pages will render its real meaning and object almost self-evident. But it might however be necessary here to be forewarned that the subject on the whole is too serious to allow its handling with indifference or contempt, and that as such it is not likely to please all or even many. It must also be confessed that it is impossible to invent any other suitable method of treatment to avoid this difficulty and that it would therefore be no cause for disappointment, if none but competent and sympathising readers interest themselves with the contents of this essay.

** CHAPTER I.  
INTRODUCTION.**

** THE** two well-known epics in the sanskrit language belonging to ancient India and the Indian nation at large are, of course, the Ramayana and the Maha Barata. That they have been for centuries past, and are even at the present day, invariably venerated by all the Hindus, as texts of religious importance, treating as they do of the histories of two of the great Dynasties of ancient Hindu Sovereigns of the celebarated Surya, and Soma Vamsas; and that they are supposed to contain ample historical incidents and instances of noble characters sufficient to impart a life interest by furnishing lofty ideals for the progress of morality, both public and private, are facts unhesitatingly admitted, on the one hand, by every pious and religious Hindu in the land: their superiority on the other hand among indigenous literary productions, in consideration of the simple sweet and fluent style in which they are written and of the abundance of happy expressions from one end of the texts to the other, fit for apt quotations in everyday life, are duly acknowledged by every Sanskrit Scholar in India and Europe. They are at the same time affording immense scope and interest for modern critical enquiries aiming at discovering and determining their worth and importance from archaeological, philological, and other scientific points of view. Every sort of attempt in these directions to analyse the contents of the texts made by all earnest enquirers in the East and West must naturally imply a clear and firm belief in the historical nature of the composition. But instances are neither wanting nor unknown of varieties of cirticisms from different quarters declaring that the epics abound in exaggerations and poeticalfancies peculiar to the Indian Nation and that they really supply but few trustworthy historical facts. However, in an unbiassed consideration of the essential nature of these epics as historical treatises, it is not logically possible nor reasonable to leave entirely out of account the descriptions so vividly and so unequivocally furnished regarding the times and places of action as well as the personalities that prominently figure in the narratives right-through. All else may perhaps be viewed with suspicion and cried down as individual observations or fancies direct, in accordance with the peculiar turn of mind or some preconceived idea with which such enquiries are so often commenced. On the contrary, it is certainly surprising to find that the net result of all critical labours pertaining to Indian subjects of this kind, for at least the past 100 years, has been more or less the rejection of all important items as useless and irrelevant and the admission of minor ones as essential to form the basis of all arguments urged forward in reviewing such topics. It would not therefore be unnatural or unreasonable to infer that there must have been some fundamental mistake, at the very outset, in the interpretation of the texts themselves, for which, of course, the local Pandits and by no means the foreign critics are responsible. The possibilities and probabilities for this unfortunate and lamentable ignorance on the part of Native Pandits, can only be sought after and traced to, the neglect of Sanskrit studies for several centuries past, and the consequent gradual diminution of religious zeal and religious practice, owing chiefly to the unsettled and disturbed state of administration during all this time, in the various centres of learning and religious activity. The formulas to solve the problems contained in these valuable literature were forgotten, bequeathed as they are by the ancient and omnicient sages to their beloved and less favoured posterity, and the keys furnished to unlock thesecrets for the purpose of utilising the hidden treasures were almost lost, or unconsciously thrown away, with the natural result, that all rude and wrong processes now employed to open, unavoidably end in breakage and damage.

 **2**. In my humble attempt to write this little volume, I must expressly declare that I have no original plan to vindicate, no new theory to propound, no fresh commentary to offer. I only undertake the task of selecting many a relevant fact for explanation from the generally available and commonly recognised ancient literature, and I am not, therefore, liable to any serious responsibilities in treating the subject, as I am obliged to do, with my very limited knowledge of the Sanskrit Language. My main excuse for the present unqualified adventure lies in the overwhelming feelings of anxiety at the modern tendency for virtually annihilating or reducing the importance of the subjects to which the abundance of unwarranted and destructive elucidations are drifting. Further, the simplicity of style and language as well as the plainness of expression although in a somewhat disguised form, specially employedin the epics, for the express benefit of other than scholarly classes, emboldens me to proceed without much fear or diffidence:

**घटोयमिति विज्ञातुं नियमः कोन्वपेक्षते ॥**

To know a pot a pot, does not demand much scientific learning. The work I have thus to perform is, therefore, simple though laborious; and I am fully aware, that I can reasonably neither claim nor expect eulogiums on any account, and that for the same reason I need foster no fear of unfavourable criticisms, particularly under the circumstances explained above. I shall by all means feel amply repaid for this humble effort, provided this little production succeeds in stirring the latent capacities of intelligent scholars earnestly inclined to enlighten and benefit their inferiors.

** 3**. The Ramayana and the Mahabharatha are classed under the ancient religious literature, technically known as the Ithihasas, differing but slightly from the puranas; and the the former is styled the Adi-kavia or the first poetical composition and is commonly understood to be much earlier than the latter. The general outline of the stories narrated in both the epics is too well known, having been told by this time in different languages, in different methods and probably with different objects. To avoid tiring repetition, I shall therefore confine myself to facts absolutely necessary to be detailed for the clear exposition of the ideas, theories and practical instructions, actually conveyed by the texts. But even in doing so, the most commonly accepted or understood facts and descriptions alone shall be referred to.  
** 4**. The Ramayana is generally known in our midst as an exact and complete historical treatment of the reign of Sri Rama, an incarnation of Vishnu and a descendant of the illustrious Solar Dynasty, the Surya Vamsa. He is said to have ruled in Ayodhya, the capital of the Kosala country the modern Oudh, on the banks of the Sarayu. The Tretawhich is the second yuga in the cycle of the quadruple yugas is specified to have been the period during which Sri Rama long reigned most righteously over his happy and virtuous subjects for eleven thousand years. The Ramayana text is also said to have been composed by sage Vanmiki during this reign and taught by him to the two sons of Rama, named Kusa and Lava, who were born of Sita at his hermitage. The poem was sung later on by the two children in the presence of Sri Rama, as a musical composition accompanied by the play of the musical instrument, the vina. The concluding chapters of the text styled Uttarakanda, therefore, contained the future history of Rama as predicted by Vanmiki at the time it was composed.

 Whereas the Maha Bharata is understood as a similar historical treatment of the reign of Yudhistira, a descendant of the subsequent Lunar dynasty the Soma Vamsa. Hastinapura or modern Delhi was his capital and to his illustrious reign is assigned the period comprising the latter end of the third or Dwapara yuga and the beginning of the fourth or current Kali yuga. Sri Krishna, another and later incarnation of Vishnu, is described as a descendant of the Yadhava Vamsa (a branch of the Soma-Vamsa) and a close relative and contemporary of Yudhistira. A full Purana, namely the Sri Bagavatham, is written to the glory of Sri Krishna, but a great portion of his important life is detailed in the Maha Bharata itself, including the preaching of the well known Bhagavat Gita. Sri Krishna stands prominent as the leading character throughout the epic poem, which, without him, will only be insipid and lifeless. It is nothing but surprising that no serious thought has yet been given by the educated. Hindus to the correct understanding of the contents of this class of religious literature, although some interest is occasionally evinced in the various corners of this vast Indian Continent in the discussions of other collateral subjects of religion and socialism. A great portion of the Hindu population entirely believes in the truth of every description given as super-human events which actually took place in India. Another class either totally disbelieves the stories or is indifferent altogether. There are others who partly believe in their historical facts, as far as they fall within human probabilities, and treat the rest as literary flourishes in Sanskrit poetry, so common at the time the texts were supposed to be composed.  
** 4**. The modern Western views on the subject expressed after due scientific enquiries,archaeologically and philologically made, almost upset the native impressions. The two epics as all other ancient literature in India, are ascertained to havebeen written in pieces, at different periods and by different authors, and finally and lately joined together as a whole. In the Ramayana, for instance, the Uttara-kanda is supposed by some to have been added as a supplementary portion, the word Uttara clearly conveying the clue for that logical inference. The antiquarians who are prepared to give the most charitable consideration, could not probably find sufficient grounds to fix the dates of these compositions beyond two or three thousand years. Some of them infer from the customs of polyandry and poligamy described in the Mahabharata, that it should have been composed earlier than the Ramayana, which contains the treatment of better morals and customs. Both the epics, as they understand, represent more or less the conditions under which the Indians lived at the times they were written. There is in fact no end of ingenious inferences, drawn from many a foregone conclusion, as to their dates authorships or compilations, which will virtually tend to reduce the religious importance generally attached to them. There are found, occasionally, educated natives also who follow these foot-steps and contribute their quota with feelings of satisfaction. Rev. Banerji in his preface to the Markandeya Purana says, "The Puranas in general contain no authentic history, there is no plot, no finish, no humour, no wit, no poetry but mere versification and combination of irrelevant and incoherent facts. Monier Williams says that the complete list of 18 Puranas given in all the Puranas is absurd and must therefore be later interpolations".  
** 5**. It cannot, however, be doubted that the origin, status, customs, religion and all else that constitute the peculiarity of the Indian nation greatly depend upon the fate of these epics and Puranas as settled, or would be settled by the western enquirers and unavoidably accepted by the civilised Hindus, the orthodoxical pundits and religious authorities simplycondemning these views from corners of villages, without being able to protest with a single sensible argument to convince even the educated portion of their community, much less the enlightened westerns. Our present lot is unfortunately cast in the midst of a very critical period, with our fossilized pundits behind and the sensible foreign cricits in front. It is almost a hundred years now since the social and religious questions in India have begun to be seriously discussed, variously interpreted and curiously criticised both by Hindus as by foreigners. For centuries in the past however, these very questions remained settled facts and demanded no reformation. That certain changes have recently occurred in the existing condition of affairs has therefore to be naturally presumed.

 The Sanskrit pundits in India who have all along been the interpreters of our religious literature, have for various reasons degenerated and the western critics no doubt obtained mostly second hand informations from this class of professional pundits. It is preposterous to presume that the sanskrit language spread itself spontaneously in western countries by any other means. These are sufficient and grave facts to throw much snspicion on the correctness,tone and even relevancy of the points hotly discussed on either side. It may not be difficult to prove that several of these important problems are based upon the ignorant and unauthorised interpretations of the pundits and the consequent criticisms of foreigners, who could not naturally be entirely free from bias or apathy against alien religion and socialism.

 The most important questions regarding the value or utility of the sacred Vedas, Puranas and other religious literature are easily and conveniently given up by the Hindus to be dealt with completely in accordance with the fancy of the western antiquarians. Minor or less serious questions concerning social matters are alone found to be occasionally worth discussing. This cannot however be taken to confirm the view that all ancient sacred literature is correctly andproperly reviewed by the westerns and consciously accepted in India by those who can afford to understand its real meaning. It is likely that the sum total of the moderan opinions is, but a conglomeration of a jumble of irrelevant, unwise and to some extent blasphemous talks on the sacred and practically scientific subjects long settled by our wise forefathers in the real interest of their beloved posterity. The periods for instance at which these ancient texts were composed are attempted to be ascertainel by various so called scientific processes, without taking the trouble at first to understand the meaning of their contents. More importance appears to be attached to the dates of composition or those of the supposed historical events by bringing them under the first four letters of the English Alphabet, the B. C. perio -d or A D. period, greater efforts being invariably put forth to come down to A. D. some-how rather than to B. C. The Vedas as a rule are pronounced to be earlier productions as compared with the Puranas and Ithihasas. A cursory reference to the well known Upanishads, such as, Muktika, Tarasara, Rama-Tapini, Krishna Tapini, Rama Rahasya, Sita &c. will clearly prove the absurdity of the conclusion. These Upanishads unequivocally refer to the Puranic stories said to have been composed in the Puranic period. The Puranas could therefore with equal consistency be pronounced to be earlier productions than the Vedas themselves as could be proved by the following quotation.

**प्रथमं सर्वशास्त्राणां पुराणं ब्रह्मणाश्रुतम् ।  
अनन्तरञ्च वक्रेभ्यो वेदास्तस्य विनिसृताः ।  
अङ्गानि धर्मशास्त्रञ्च व्रतानि नियमास्तथा ॥  
                   ब्रह्माण्डपुराणम् ॥**

This conclusion is evaded probably with some preconceived object in view for which it is not quite suited. When difficulties of this kind arise, the common argument invariaably brought against all varieties of ancient literature is tocall the contradictory portions, "Interpolations," especially when the interpretations ignorantly attempted do not tally. In the majority of cases, this prevailing mode of criticism is absurd, although it is the easiest and the most silly weapon of attack that could be resorted to. Because, it certainly implies that the possibility of the exact criticisin was prophetically discovered and the precautions to provide against them were taken by the alleged process. When the actual complaint itself is the extreme want of attention and regard for ancient religious literature locally, common sense can easily convince us, that the idea of interpolation which demands active intellectual effort supplemented by competent knowledge and skill is too far-fetched and improbable. Half the amount of time and skill supposed to have been wasted in this direction would have sufficed to search out the correct interpretations of the texts themselves. In spite of the encouragement recently given in some places to the rivival of sanskrit studies in India by way of special Colleges for the purpose, our modern pundits have not yet interested themselves in helping us out of the existing difficulties in this direction. Few of this class have ever turned their eyes to this kind of liters ture. The learned Pundit on whom the natives look up for correct interpretation and who in his turn assumes the air of a true friend, philosopher, and guide,either gazes with open mouthed wonder at the western translations and criticisms and often bluntly condemns the same with the audacity of an ignorant country boor. Pundits with additional English education occasionally found in these days, appear to fare no better but are often more easily led to fall in the western errors as well.

** 6**. It would indeed be unfair and uncharitable to omit here, the curious and apparently favourable interpretations attempted by a new sect of foreigners, who have for sometime, launched out an eclectic system, comprising all the past present and future religions, sciences and philosophies in the world, ignoring altogether the natural difficulties and theconsequent futility of reconciling even two opposed systems. I refer to the sect that preaches Hinduism, admires Budhism and believes in several other isms. There are greater chances for an educated Hindu to fall into the errors of this theosophical creed, as the English language in which the theories of this sect are expressed especially under the garb of scientific reasoning, is likely to appeal to him better than his own mother tongue. Ample instances shall be quoted subsequently showing in detail how completely the real purport of the texts is misunderstood and misinterpreted in the elucidation of the Hindu Religious subjects by professors of Theosophy. It is indeed a pity that we have by this time landed at a unique stage of existence as a nation, in which our legacy of ancient wisdom has been improperly handled and spoiled by our own men, owing to ignorance and sometimes bias and even self-interest Every subject of religious importance is totally slighted or ignored, and as a result of the new civilisation, odious comparisons are so readily made with similar western customs and habits, which, when properly analysed would be found to contain nothing in common with them in any of their details or origin.

 **7**. The supposition of the sacred religious texts as historical or geographical treatises is in itself an egregious blunder ignorantly committed by our eastern pundits, and the consequent floods of criticisms by western scholars, as superstition, mythology, old-world simplicity, sectarianism, bigotry and what not, have been simple waste of energy and skill in the wrong direction. There are and still will be plenty of valuable materials to admire as unfathomed scientific lore for all earnest seekers of truth in the east or west, north or south. There is a fumdamental difference in the treatinent of our philosophy itself as compared with that of the west. The purely theoretical portion has a scientific and practical counterpart going hand in hand with it which is probably yet unknown in the west.

**अस्ति ब्रह्मेतिचेद्वेदपरोक्षज्ञानमेव तत् ।  
अहं ब्रह्मेति चेद्वेदसाक्षात्कारस्स उच्यते ॥  
                   वराहोपनिषत् ॥  
आगमोक्तं विवेकाच्चद्विधाज्ञानं तदुच्यते ।  
शब्दब्रह्मागममयं परं ब्रह्मविवेकजम् ।  
अन्धं तम इवाज्ञानं दीपवच्चेन्द्रियोद्भवम् ।  
यथा सूर्यस्तथा ज्ञानं यद्विप्रर्षे विवेकजम् ॥  
                   विष्णुपुराणम् ।**

 Constant criticisms or occasional eulogiums based upon the ignorance of this vital distinction are therefore practically useless, if not mischievous It may be interesting and perhaps surprising to note, that the eastern Architecture, Astrology, and several other Sciences, like the Histories and Geographies referred to above, are all founded upon practical philosophy, psychology and psycho physiology and have absolutely nothing to compare with the corresponding subjects elsewere. Descending further to more practical subjects of sociology. Law or Politics. the same ideal will be found more concretised. The ancient literature consists of the highest productions of the wisest of men treating unanimously as they do. of the most important subject in the world to which man alone in creation is entitled to. Man's elevation to god-head was considered the sole object worth his life-long trial. Our ancient Rishis had the common sense and enormous practical experience to understand that the loftiest ideals of philosophy could not suit the generality of mankind, owing to their incapacity to grasp them. They therefore descended with love and sympathy to the platform of the less abstract style, providing them at the same time practical instructions to help them in ascending higher and higher by gradual progress. This process, was rescrted to as a matter of necessity for the benefit of the lower orders of society, and it is a sheer sinful mistake to attribute superstitious belief or ignorance, on their part.The unique and extreme skill and scientfic knowledge displayed by them in giving a concrete shape to their philosophical ideals are perhaps unequalled in any foreign literature.

 It will certainly be clear from the above quotation that different grades of intellect have been taken into consideration by the wise sages in the treatment of religious subjects without losing sight of the main goal for reaching which all the requirements were provided step by step to all possible varieties of mankind. It would therefore have to be conceded that every bit of ancient literature is cosmopolitan in the widest sense of the term and contains virtually nothing but the highest philosophical truths, whether the outer garb is philosophical, historical, geographical, political, moral or legal. Unless this fact is clearly kept in view, none of these literary productions could be found to convey reasonable or consistant meaning. The modern method of interpretations, disregarding this important point cannot but land us in absurdities, so as to suspect the sanity of the authors themselves; whereas in doing so, we are only exhibiting the unsound condition of our own brains. Gnana or the actual perception or knowledge of the reality is the ultimate aim of our philosophy and religion. This knowledge is not possible to be attained without proper preparation and qualification by Yoga and Karma specially prescribed for the purpose, by the Rishis or seers who have acquired perfection by necessary and long practice of devotion. In the interest of suffering humanity they have detailed various processes suited to different grades of intellect and turn of mind, which would all tend to produce the intended effect of qualifying them to the gradual but sure attainment of perfection. The proper scientific method of procedure for religious development is described in the garb of histories and geographies, law and politics. As the subject matter pertains to the highest of abstractions imaginable, there was no other go but to resort to human affairs for description in words. The language of the One had to be translated into that of the many and thetale of the philosopher had to be told as the history of the worldly man.

**चोद्यं वा व्यवहारो वा क्रियतां द्वैतभाषया ।  
अद्वैतभाषया चोद्यं नास्ति नापि तदुत्तरम् ॥**

** 8**. It may however be necessary to enquire whether the contents of the texts in question refer to real history, or only to some religious instructions couched in a historical form, or to both together. If we grant that they contain some serious religious matter in the disguise of a historical treatise, the necessary conclusion follows, as to the complete absence of the historical facts. To argue that they combine history with religion or philosophy, is surely untenable, although that is more or less the current opinion of the majority of educated Hindus and pundits. Want of definite opinion on the one hand and the fear of disturbing popular beliefs on the other, make them unwilling to reject either. Why the history of a particular person or persons should be pitched upon to enunciate the principles of religion or philosophy, and how could the former ever tally with the exact requirements of the latter, are matters which could not be divined by ordinary common sense. It is safer and easier to eliminate altogether the idea of religion from the whole concern. But in that case, it is difficult to prove the value of these historical facts, their correctness and cogency, their probabilities and possibilities in the sphere of human affairs.  
** 9**. It is often believed that the Puranas and Ithihasas were composed for the purpose of teaching morals by example But they contain several stories and incidents whose mere narration could not sometimes be tolerated in good socities, with any sense of decorum. Panchali is said to have been married to five husbands, the Pandavas, in the Mahabharata. To establish its propriety without being misunderstood as a lawful marriage, several chapters are added as explanation for the particular instance. Several Puranas give detailed descriptions regarding the intercourse of Brahaspathi, the Deva Guru, the preceptor of gods in the heaven, with the wife of his elder brother Uchathya during her pregnancy and the curse cruelly pronounced upon the innocent unborn child who accordingly became blind for life. Tara, the wife of this very Brahaspathi is said to have been abducted by Soma or Moon and returned only after begetting a son named Budha (the planet). It would certainly be astonishing to know if any instructive morals worth the name are ever going to be drawn from these incidents. In the Dharma Sastras, the wife of the elder brother and of the Guru here alluded to, are placed on a par with the most respected and sacred mother.

**ज्येष्टपत्नी राजपत्नी गुरुपत्नी तथैव च ।  
पत्निमाता स्वमाता च पञ्चैते मातरः स्मृताः ॥**

No perverse ingenuities could possibly justify these incidents on purely moral grounds. There is no doubt that several discourses are occasionally introduced in the Puranas treating of many a useful and moral topic, and perhaps here and there a few facts may be pitched upon as instances of heroism, justice or other virtues. But the consideration of these as the main objects of the compositions is a serious mistake which cannot but bring about the present deplorable state of affairs.  
** 10**. Excepting the Ramayana alone, the Mahabharata, Sribhagavatha, the 18 Puranas and the same number of Upapuranas are all said to have been narrated by Suta to the residents of the Nimisa forest. Every reader of this religious literature accepts this as an axiomatic truth without a querry, as if Suta and the residents of Nimisa are familiar persons, and the forest itself is not far from his own abode. Suta may be passed off for the present as a learned story-teller andthe residents of Nimisa who listened to all his stories may also be supposed to have been some pious inhabitants of the forests like the Byragees and Gosayees now found in Upper India. But the geography of Nimisa at least may be enquired into at this juncture, especially as it is described to have been the sacred place in which all our ancient histories were narrated or the voluminous texts containing them were read out.

**सिसृक्षमाणा विश्वं हि यत्र विश्वसृजः पुरा ।  
सत्रं हि ईजिरे पुण्यं सहस्रं परिवत्सरान् ।  
तपोगृहपतिर्यत्र ब्रह्माब्रह्माभवत्स्वयम् ।  
भ्रमतो धर्मचक्रस्य यत्र नेमिरशीर्यत ।  
यत्र वैरं समभवत् विश्वामित्रवसिष्ठयोः ॥  
                  वायुपुराणम्।**

It is clear from this description that the place refers to some locality where successive Brahmas performed a sacrifice before they created this Universe. No part of this earthy globe can therefore be pointed out for its identification, much less a corner of India. There is evidently no ambiguity or want of clearness in the description given, but the only real difficulty experienced is in reconciling the same with modern interpretations. A searching enquiry into every detail in this manner will completely convince us of the impossibility of explaining away the texts as we blindly do at present.

 Another instance of such geographical description met with almost every day in religious ceremonies is that of the Bharata Varsha. This terın is ever mentioned in what is known as the Sankalpa-Mantra which precedes every ceremony like introductory prologues in dramas or Natakas. As for the Sankalpa-Mantra itself, it is supposed to describe, as current interpretation goes, the locality in which the ceremony takes place as well as the time at which it is performed. It is not however clearly comprehensible why such specificationsof time or place are demanded for religious rituals. Then meaning of the Sankalpa-Mantra as a whole, savours more of a documentary language fit to be exhibited in a Registration office. In its application especially to the Sradha or Tarpana ceremony performed in behalf of one's parents and forefathers, the irrelevancy and absurdity of using such strictly legal language are apparent on its very face. The next and more serious difficulty to be encountered is not only the vagueness but the utter incorrectness of the geographical description itself. The most learned Sanskrit pundit is sure to be handicapped, if only a young school boy of the present day require him to identify the places. The only ridiculous explanation often forthcoming from that quarter is that such places must have existed in times of yore. Equally profitless and not the less preposterous are the scientific explanations, attempted by calling geological discoveries to their aid in this matter. The simplest and the easiest method of getting over these difficulties, is ever ready at hand for a particular class of unscruplous critics who boldly pronounce that our ancients werepitiably innocent of the correct knowledge of geography. It is thus entirely hopeless to obtain any useful information on the subject except by directly resorting to the internal evidence available in the texts themselves. The Sankalpa-Mantra in question runs thus :

**जम्बूद्वीपे—भारतवर्षे—भरतः खण्डे—मेरोः दक्षिणे पार्श्वे**

 Jambu-Dweepam or the island of Jambu which contains Bharatavarsha is described, as the central piece surrounded by saline ocean. Six more Dweepas or islands encircle the same in succession, each being separated all round by a different variety of ocean. Begining with Lavana or salt water round the Jambu, the successive oceans are supposed to contain **इक्षु** or sugar-cane juice, **सुरा** or spirituous liquor, **सर्पि**or ghee, **दधि** or curd, **क्षीरं**for milk and or**उदकं**pure water respectively. In spite of the very tempting character of allthese highly valuable oceans, it is indeed a pity that modern geography is unable to furnish a single clue to their whereabouts. Leaving out of account the 5 valuable oceans and the 6 Dweepas bordering them, as hopeless and useless, attempts seem to have been made by modern pundits to identify the central piece, the Jambu surrounded by saline ocean with our earthy globe. What logic led them to this ingenious infernce is probably a divine secret that will not brook cross-examination. There is no doubt however that it is from this supposition that the identification of India with Bharathavarsha is generally explained. How far this explanation will stand the test of common sense is difficult to determine. The Jambu Dweepa or the earthy globe as now supposed, is said to be divided into 9 Varshas or continens. Ilavrita in the centre, Ramyaka, Hiranmaya and Kuru in the north, Ketumal in the east, Bhadraswa in the west and Harivarsha, Kimpurusha and Bharata in the south. Bharatavarsha is thus the southernmost continent in the division which must naturally therefore find its situation near the south pole. Absurd conclusions of this kind are inevitable in the analysis of every descriptive detail furnished and the persistence to reconcile current interpretations is a sheer waste of time and energy. More of this shall be detailed in the subsequent pages as the main object of this introduction is only to convince ourselves of the necessity of seeking for other and better interpretations to arrive at correct meanings of the contents of our sacred literature. But before proceeding with the consideration of the next important point I may note here that the word Bharata-khanda as applied in the Sankalpa will immensly add to the difficulties of the modern interpretation. Granting that Bharata-varsha represents India, Bharata-khanda must naturally mean and is taken to mean, a subdivision of India like the Madras or Bengal Presidency. The same Sankalpa being recitedthroughout the length and breadth of India, no more explanation can possibly be ventured in that line of interpretation than a clear admission of its being synonymous with Bharata-varsha rendering the addition of the word redundant and meaningless. Thus at every step in the attempt to explain away in the modern fashion, we are beset with evident difficulties clearly comprehensible by ordinary exercise of common sense. And yet neither the learned pundit nor the so called civilized Hindu Gentleman ever cares to understand the texts in their proper light. The pundit feels satisfied by occasionally adding one nonsense to another to create consistency. The civilized gentleman often thinks it beneath his acquired dignity and a waste of his precious time to approach the timebarred absurdities of his forefathers. He entirely forgets at the same time, that his borrowed ideas of civilisation and gentlemanliness proceeded from the west, where such utter indifference to ancient civilisation is only treated with contempt.  
** 11**. We have by this time noticed more or less how the attempts to identify geographical descriptions in the Puranas with localities known by those names in India are entirely misleading and futile. It is also desirable to form some definite idea in this introduction itself, how the question of time fares in the same class of ancient literature. Every unbiased reader of these texts will be compelled to concede that the specifications of time wherever found are so clear and unambiguous that no want of precision or exactness could be attributed to them. The facilities for securing unalterable specifications are greater in the Indian method than are available in the west. The various astronomical details like the Ayanas, Rithus, Tithis, Stars &c. are taken advantage of on all such occasions. The common sweeping criticisms as to their vagueness are therefore entirely unfounded. But at the same time it is necessary to ascertain how far our ownpundits can stand, in their usual method of interpretations, the test of examination of the internal evidence gathered from the texts themselves. We may conveniently proceed with our enquiry from the date of creation itself.

**चैत्रेमासि जगत् ब्रह्मा ससर्ज प्रथमेहनि ।  
शुक्लपक्षे समग्रं वै तदा सूर्योदये सति ।  
वत्सरादौ वसन्तादौ बलिराज्ये तथैव च ।  
                    नारदपुराणम् ।**

The passage quoted above creates no special difficulties until we reach the last factor. The very first creation of this universe by Brahma is said to have taken place during the reign of Mahabeli the Emperor. How this particular item could be explained in itself, or in conjunction with its previous details, is surely a perplexing riddle to every scholar or critic native or foreign. In spite of the exact specifications furnished, the whole thing is a hard nut to crack. No archaeology or geology can afford to help us out of this difficulty and no pundit can explain away in his usual fashion without exhibiting his ignorance and arrogance. Let us descend for the present from the very beginning of creation to our own times leaving a long and sufficient interval to be dealt with according to the fancy or caprice of every existing critic on the subject. There is apparently no serious dispute as to our having got over a period of five thousand and odd years in the Kali era and lived the life of good old inhabitants of India or Bharata-varsha all the time. The latter circumstance is however a condition precedent to the former, as curiously enough none of the four yugas occur beyond the limited boundaries of the Bharatavarsha.

**चत्वारि भारते वर्षे युगानि कवयोऽब्रुवन् ।  
कृतं त्रेताद्वापरञ्च कलिश्चान्यत्र न क्वचित् ॥**

Without passing on to the point at issue, it is not convenient to halt at this stage to consider just now, whether on accountof the advent of the yugas in our midst within the Indian soil alone, we are comparatively placed in a better or worse condition than our fellow creatures outside. I might however mention here probably to the surprise of all pundit classes, that the pride now cherished by them as the residents of this Punnya Bhumi or holy land, is really unwarranted by the religious texts. The Indians or the dwellers of the Bharatavarsha are described as the most short lived among the inhabitants of the Jambudweepa. They are hardly blessed with more than a hundred years of age, whereas, the longivity of the life of those outside in the remaining eight varshas (representing of course in accordance with the current interpretations, the continents of Europe, Africa, America, Oceania and the remaining portions of Asia) is supposed to extend to ten thousand years in addition to several other special privileges.

** एषु पुरुषाणां अयुतं पुरुषायुवर्षाणां देवकल्पानां नागायुतप्राणानां वज्रसंहननबलवयोमोदप्रमुदितमहासौरतमिथुनव्यवायापवर्गवर्षधृतैकगर्भकलत्राणां तत्र तु त्रेतायुगसमः कालो वर्तते ॥**

**   श्रीमद्भागवतम् ॥**

Whatever may be the real gist of the passage quoted, it is impossible to obtain at any time any reasonable reconciliation between worldly facts, meaning of the texts and the current interpretations.

 To return again to the subject of time, the commencement of the current Kali era dates from the hour of Sri Krishna's quitting the earth for ascension to heaven.

**यस्मिन्नहनियर्ह्येव भगवानुत्ससर्जगाम् ।  
तदैवेहानुवृत्तोसावधर्मप्रभवः कलिः ॥  
                 श्रीमद्भागवतम् ॥**

**यस्मिन् दिने हरिर्यातो दिवं सन्त्यज्यमेदिनीम् ।  
तस्मिन्नेवावतीर्णोयं कालकायो बलीकलिः ॥  
                        विष्णुपुराणम् ॥**

A general survey of a few leading events which will furnish a continued and unbroken account of this period of 5000 years may suffice for our enquiry here at present.

 Not long after the departure of Sri Krishna, the Pandavas retired to the forest and finally disappeared. Parikshit, the grand-son of Arjuna then ascended the throne at Hastinapura in the beginning of the Kali yuga. He is said to have ruled for a thousand years, and after him his son Janamajaya who performed the Sarpa-Sacrifice ruled, for a period of three thousand years. His son and successor Satanika is also said to have ruled for a similar long period of three thousand years and the line continued for some time in this manner.

**हस्तिनापुरमध्यस्याभिमन्योस्तनयस्ततः ।  
राज्यमेकसहस्रञ्च ततोभूज्जनमेजयः ।  
त्रिसहस्रं कृतं राज्यं शतानीकस्त्ततो भवत् ।  
पितुस्तुल्यं कृतं राज्यं  ...   ...   ...  ॥        
        **

** भविष्यपुराणम् ॥**

The glaring inconsistencies in the very arithmetic of these facts as compared with the current Kali era, are easily and readily accounted for by our learned pundits as events which took place in different kalpas. But neither this information nor the names of such kalpas are mentioned in the texts. The argument brought forward however, clearly implies that their author the present Vyasa by name Krishna-Dwipayana has detailed in his 18 Puranas historical incidents which took place in various kalpas that passed before him. Fresh Vyasas are said to appear in every Dwaparayuga and they are naturally expected to compose histories only of a particular Chathuryuga, probably their own limited period.  

The idea that History repeats itself, is perhaps required to be understood here in its most literal sense, which is at best a physical impossibility and a meaningless absurdity. But even granting the possibility of exact repetitions of History in this peculiarly wonderful Indian soil, the Vyasas would certainly be out of order in their treatment of one set of historical facts, if they confound and mix up facts from one or more other sets. However willingly and respectfully we may view the arguments of our venerable pundits, it is impossible to conceal their flagrant ignorance of the real contents of these invaluable production.

**अज्ञात्वा शास्त्रहृदयं मूढो वक्त्यन्यथान्यथा \।  
अविज्ञाय च तत्वार्थं बुद्धेरज्ञानवैभवात् ॥**

** 12**. Even a cursory examination of the general outline of the stories in the Puranas and other ancient literature, has by this time convinced us of the fact that the descriptions of time and place found in them are inexplicable riddles demanding other than current methods of interpretations, to arrive at their correct meanings. It must be clearly confessed that the pundit's attempts to conceal his ignorance and to confound the illiterate, give no relief to the enquiring minds, nor are the irresponsible and gratuitous criticisms condemning everything ancient and sacred on the false plea of scientific reasoning, of any avail to those earnestly enquiring for truth. The worth of our sacred legacy is evidently being tested at present only by mistaken processes and an early and amicable solution by a reconciliation between these two extremes, also appears to be perfectly hopeless. It is practically impossible to make our pundits understand our critical position in this matter at the present stage of our modern civilisation. Nor are the western critics whom we are bound by sheer justice to credit with keener perception, untiring energy and praiseworthy interest, likely to set usright though they have been to a great extent capable of setting us in motion. They could not of their own accord sufficiently approach the subject which is utterly strange and new to them. Our pundits should however be given full credit for having preserved our literature intact to this day, although it was only like the treasury guards without knowing the real contents of the treasury. The best possible use should therefore be made of the existing knowledge in their possession and whenever their help in the proper direction is available, it should not be declined. On the contrary, little help could be expected from the western critics for the proper solution of the questions, beyond the informations as to the sort of criticisms likely to emanate from foreign lands. The English translations of Sanskrit literature are in themselves very often dangerous and misleading. They entirely lose the clue specially contained in words having several meanings. Agastya or Kumba-Sambhava, for instance, is often found translated as Pot-born Rishi. The facilities for useful enquiry completely end with such translations. Attempts to trace anything further serious out of them, might result in fun instead, like the retranslation of Hamilton's bridge into Barber's bridge in Madras. Simpler western mistakes in this direction are also very common. The name Vara-nasi has been changed into Vana-rasi or Benaris, and Vatoda into Varota or Baroda. With these altered names, we lose entirely the chances of discovering any important facts which the original words are capable of disclosing by the very meanings they convey. The word Trivandrum the anglicised form of tiru-ananthapuram was once found represented into a combination made up of a tree, a van and a drum. Such ingenious perversities have only to be carefully avoided in serious religious enquiries. It is also necessary to notice that proper names in Sanskrit generally specify something, whereas in the west such wordsseldom convey any meaning. The names Ayodhya and London may be taken for example, the former clearly meaning 'invulnerable.' Besides the mistakes of the above kind, the most important and technical words commonly used in this sacred literature are translated and defined improperly. Difficulties caused by the ignorance of correct definitions are sometimes got over easily by calling them esoteric and occult. There is hardly any esoterism or occultism in these religious texts. No doubt there are several technical terms used but they are also clearly defined. The scientific treatment of every subject demands the use of such terms and no one ever thinks of calling them occult or esoteric on that account. In law books for instance, there is always a chapter at the commencement giving the definitions of terms technically used throughout the text. There is certainly no justification to call law books occult sciences for that reason. Our venerable sages never cared or intended to hide from us any valuable information known to them, otherwise, we would not have been favoured with the existing voluminous literature on the subject. For aught we know, the occultisms and esoterisms may be necessary to a Theosophist for his peculiar subject, but our ancient religion and philosophy with less pretensions are complete in themselves without them, whatever may be their worth to an unsympathetic eye. Foreign religions which refuse to accept our tenets as well as those which try to oppose us can virtually do no harm, owing to a clear understand ing of their difference and opposition. But it demands the utmost caution to deal with the curious method in vogue of explaining our religious literature by occulitisms and secret doctrines, especially as the texts proclaim to the contrary.

**ज्ञानादेव हि कैवल्यं इति शास्त्रेषु डिंडिमः ॥**

No proclamations by beat of drum are evertaken to be secret or occult. Further, granting that the ultimategoal is the same in every religion, the methods of procedure are entirely different. Nay, even in our own religion, several methods are prescribed which are not meant to be mixed up halfway. To jump from one particular route to another in the middle of a journey is surely absurd and unprofitable. To supplement therefore the existing local ignorance of the subject with exotic methods of explanation will only accelerate the tendencies to complete ruin. In the study of our sacred religion such extraneous processes are strictly prohibited.

**अश्रद्धालोरविश्वासो नोदाहरणमर्हति ।  
श्रद्धालुरपि सर्वत्र वैदिकेष्वधिकारतः ॥**

But this does not in the least mean that blind faith is ever demanded as is often wrongly supposed to be. For every important subject in the world there ought to be a limited boundary, and it ought not to be transgressed if any good should come out of its study. Full scope for discussions in scientific methods is amply provided and freely allowed to arrive at definite and reasonable conclusions.

**अनुग्राहकतर्कश्च कुरुते तर्कवेदनम् ।**

But the illogical and irrelevant criticisms commonly in vogue consequent on the entire and unadulterated ignorance of the subject will not be tolerated either in religious or other serious subjects.

**स्वानुभूत्यानुसारेण तर्क्यतां मा कुतर्क्यताम् ॥**

To venture criticisms without the least knowledge or study of a subject is styled Kutarka. This is exactly the prevailing mistake that does all the present harm. In the majority of criticisms offered in this manner there is hardly any tinge of originality nor any evidence of earnest research. They may after all be summed up into two indefinite and trite expressions, namely, ‘exageration and poetical fancy'. Theyare always too vague to serve any extent to which and the reason for which these criticisms may be applied and how far the remaining portions may be taken for historical truth are seldom stated in definite language. Any serious attempt to do so will doubtless betray the inadmissibility of such remarks in the literature in question as they are sure to create new difficulties to be encountered.

 Earnest and honest enquiry on the other hand, will easily lead us to the conclusion that not only every word or sentence but even a syllable or numerical figure has its exact purpose to serve and meaning to represent. At the zenith of the glorious civilisation of the twentieth century in this holy land, it is not uncommon to hear of lectures on vedantism invariably commenced with an entirely wrong difinition of Sruti or Vedas themselves. The Anta or end of the Vedas is mercilessly dragged to the platform without a correct knowledge of the very Adi or begining. A strong tendency appears to be cherished somehow in modern days towards the free exposition of this vedantism to an undesirable and objectionable extent. It is wrongly considered a convenient make-shift to reconcile all differences of religion and philosophy in the world. Although its impracticability for this purpose is stamped on its very face, it might be passed over as an excusable mistake. But there is another and more dangerous aspect of this high sounding Vedantism capable of bringing about the most pernicious results. It is constantly preached by the illiterate and the majority of moral bankrupts, as a plea for freedom of action in the field of ethics. It would indeed be a pity if the philosophers of the west were ever to guage the worth of Indian morals and Indian philosophy from the wisdom of these miscreants. For this lamentable state of matters, no fault of any kind canpossibly be attributed to the introduction of western civilisation and its method of study. Strength of character, thoroughness in the investigation of a subject, critical spirit of enquiry and several other valuable virtues peculiar to the western civilised nations demand grateful admiration. They are not so fickle or unsteady to be easily carried away by momentary alterations of views on serious matters. The Indians are on the contrary as the late Justice Sir Muthuswamy Iyer has regretfully expressed, sometimes prone to be led away by the petty vanities of dress and taste without any attraction for the sterling virtues of the westerns. The mere apish imitation of unimportant and locally unsuited customs or habits of the west, is, to say the least a culpable insult to the most generous spirit of the British Administration. How far the serious charges of indifference and wantonness imposed upon our own countrymen here are true, may be easily ascertained by a mere explanation of the mistaken interpretations of Sruti above referred to. This word is commonly explained and interpreted as a synonym for the Vedas, for the simple reason, that the Vedas have all along been taught orally from generation to generation, and that in the ancient days known as the Vedic period there was no possibility of communication by other means, as writing and printing were then unknown. A correct knowledge of the technical meaning of this word as used in the religious texts will clearly prove the absurdity and irrelevancy of the explanation now given. Srutipramana is one of the six varieties of proofs classified in Sanskrit Logic such as direct perception, analogy &c.

**प्रत्यक्षमनुमानञ्च शब्दञ्चोपमया सह ।  
अर्थापत्तिरभावश्च षड्प्रमाणमिति स्मृतम् ।  
अक्षादिकरणैर्दृश्यं प्रत्यक्षं तदिहोच्यते ।  
लिङ्गालिङ्गादिविज्ञानं अनुमानमिति स्मृतम् ।**

**आप्तोक्तिवचनैर्गम्यं शब्द मेवमुदाहृतम् ।  
तत्सादृश्याद्यथागम्याह्युपमाचोत कीर्तिता ।  
दिवाभोजनमस्तीति रात्रौ नास्तीति गम्यते ।  
अर्थेनैवार्थविज्ञेया चार्थापत्तिरिति स्मृतम् ।  
भ्रान्तिज्ञानेह्यभावे तु स्वयंज्ञानन्तु गम्यते ।  
भ्रान्त्याभावे स्वयंज्ञानमभावमिति कीर्तितम् ।**

The instructions from an Apta or Professor of a practical subject with which he is practically acquainted, is described, as Sabda or Sruti pramana. The instructions received from him furnish only a theoretical knowledge which has afterwards to be converted into practical knowledge by actual experiment or experience, in order to attain to the level of the professor's knowledge. Until this is done, the instructions received and the knowledge acquired, are only through hearing or Sruti and not by experience. This is the exact technical meaning of Sruti, and as such it has absolutely no reference to writing or printing. The same instructions written or printed in the most improved press of the modern day, will only be an inferior form of Sruti as compared with the direct lecture of the professor or Rishi. **ऋषिदर्शनान्** । The word Rishi denotes a person who has obtained the real knowledge by direct personal experience and his description of such experience is first grasped by Sruti or hearing by his scholars who have afterwards to practise for themselves and become Rishis or Seers like their master. The following from Yaska Niruktom clearly explains the same.

 **ते अवरेभ्यो असाक्षात्कृतधर्मभ्यो उपदेशेन मन्त्रान् सम्प्रादुः । तेषां हि श्रुत्वा ततः पश्चात् ऋषित्वमुपजायते । ते अवरेभ्यो अवरकालीनेभ्यो शक्तिहीनेभ्यः उपदेशेन शिष्योपाधिकया वृत्या मन्त्रान् ग्रन्थतो अर्थतश्च सम्प्रादुः तेऽपि चोपदेशेनैव जगृहुः ॥**

Thus it is evident how a very serious and injurious mistake is ignorantly and unconsciously committed to the entire detriment of all subsequent inferences and conclusions on the most important subject. It is doubtless the pundit's mistake to have interpreted Sruti as being so called from the circumstance that it is only taught orally from father to son or from teacher to student. Naturally from this mistaken information furnished, the western critic deduced his corollory that writing was probably unknown in the Vedic period. The word **अक्षर** letter or Alphabet, **लिपि** writing, **लिखित** written, **मुद्रित**stamped or printed abundently found in ancient literature will disprove the cogency of this inference. The Yantras and Chakras drawn in geometrical designs are filled with letters making up the mantras, such as, Mahanarayana-yantra in Mahanarayana Upanishat, Nrisimha-yantra in the Nrisimha-tapani Upanishad, Panchakshara, Ashtakshra and Srisukta mantras have all their Yantras and Chakras containing letters. In matters of this kind the internal evidence available is the safest and the most proper source of correct information. Materials like wood, metal, clay or stone are, all liable to destruction in various manner, but literature constantly renewed by writing, study and use, is alone likely to overcome and survive the inevitable ravages of time.

 **13.** Having waded through the quick sands of time and place found in ancient literature, we may try our chance with the peculiar personalities commonly figuring in them. Most of the avathars or incarnations do not possess full human details but are provided with four human hands, such as, Matsya, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Kalki and Hayagriva. Rama and Krishna the chief heroes of the Ramayana and Maha-Bharata although represented in human form are coloured blue or green. The Rakashasas are of a horrible beastly class the chief among them Ravana is gifted with ten heads and twenty hands. The military officers ofRama namely, Sugriva, Hanuman, Jambavan, Angada &c. are monkeys and bears. Among the Asuras, Mahisha has a buffaloe's head. Among the Gods, Ganesa has an elephant head, Brahma has four heads, Siva sometimes five heads and Subramonia six. The Bhadrakauli among Godesses, possesses a hundred terrible faces. The Yakshas. Gandharvas, Kinnaras and Kimpurushas have all animal faces of various descriptions. In fact, exercises in multiplication, permutation and combination of almost all shapes in the existing created beings, are worked out with untiring skill and energy to the utter bewilderment of the modern Historian.  
 The origin and birth of several of the characters are equally perplexing. In the Ramayana, Sita is described as having been born from the furrowed ground.

**यज्ञभूमि विशुद्धयर्थ कृषतो लाङ्गलेनमे ।  
सीतामुखात् समुत्पन्ना तस्मात् सीतेति विश्रुता ॥**

In the Maha-Bharata, Panchali is said to have sprung from the fire-place.

**द्रुपदस्य कुलेजाता वेदिमध्यादनिन्दिता ।**

Agastya was born from a pot. **अगस्त्यः कुम्भसम्भवः** ।

Bhishma son of Santanu was born of river Ganges.

** शन्तनुस्तु खलु गङ्गां भागीरथीमुपयेमेतस्यामस्य जज्ञे देवव्रतः । यमाहुर्भीष्मइति ॥**

Drona son of Bharadwaja was born without a mother.

**बृहस्पतेर्बृृहत्कीर्तेर्देवर्षेर्विद्धिभारत ।  
अंशाद्रोणं ससुत्पन्नं भारद्वाजमयोनिजम् ॥**

It was from Bharata son of Dushyanta that Bharata-Varsha took its name. Dushyanta's parents were Illila and Rathanthari. Illila's parents Tresnu and river Jumna and Tressnu's were Anthyanar and river Saraswathy.

** अन्त्य नारस्तु खलु सरस्वत्यां द्वादशवार्षिकसत्रमाजहार । तमुदवसाने सरस्वत्यभिगम्य भर्तारं बरयामास ।**

**त्रस्नुं सरस्वती पुत्रं अन्त्यनारादजीजनत् ।  
इलिलं जनयामास कालिन्द्यां त्रस्नुरात्मजम् ।**

** इलिलस्तु रथन्तर्थांदुष्यन्तादीन् पञ्चपुत्रानजीजनन् । स एव दुष्यन्तो विश्वामित्रदुहितरं शकुन्तलां नामोपयेमे । तस्यामस्य जज्ञे भरतः ।**

**महाभारतम् । आदिपर्व ॥**

 The Puranas abound with curious and mysterious parentages of this kind which are readily swallowed by the readers like smooth gelatined pills. They may even go to the length of thinking that without them the ancient history is not worth the name. Whereas, application of a single serious thought upon such important topics has however become a rarity, partly from consideration of wasting precious time and partly from fear of being criticised as blasphemous by pundits and the orthodox classes. The pundits anxious to exhibit their erudition are only too ready to come down upon every body with authoritative quotations against raising questions regarding the rationale of such descriptions. Quotations like the following from the Bhagavatgita and other texts are considered conclusive proof of the religious importance of blind ignorance in such matters. Evil consequences of a very serious nature are emphatically predicted by disturbing the existing beliefs. To cause loss of faith by reasoning or thinking is considered irreligious and sinful mischief.

**न बुद्धिभेदं जनयेदज्ञानां कर्मसङ्गिनाम् ।  
जोषयेत्सर्वकर्माणि विद्वान् युक्तस्समाचरन् ॥**

A learned yogi should not disturb the faith of the ignorant who is earnestly engaged in karmas. He should only encourage him keeping himself at the same time unattached. This is the meaning of the text and there is nothing wrong to mislead. But the mistake lies in its application by theignorant pundit and to the wrong persons. The pundit as at present is neither a ngani nor a yogi privileged to quote such passage, and the educated classes like the B. As or B. Ls to whom it is often applied could not be so bluntly and so easily condemned as the ignorant. Nor do they commonly come under the class of people attached to the performance of karmas ordained by the Sastras. Quotations of this sort are therefore completely inapplicable under the present conditions and could only be taken for adding insult to injury. It is high time for the pundits to understand clearly that evasive and abusive explanations of this kind experimented on the modern public will only bring them to greater disrepute and that the only possible means of making themselves useful is by exerting their best in the right direction to vindicate the worth and importance of our hoary and sacred literature. There is not the slightest doubt that without any unnecessary attempt to criticise others or without waste of time and energy in borrowing from others, much profitable work could be accomplished by the utilization of our ancestral property, if only a loving and earnest aspiration is aroused for the reclamation of lost treasures.

**स्वगृहे पायसं त्यक्त्वा भिक्षामटति दुर्मतिः ।**

Rejecting the sweet porridge at home the fool begs for alms elsewhere.  
 **14.** Before closing this introductory chapter, it is desirable to obtain a rough idea, if possible, of the general introduction found at the commencement of every Purana or Ithihasa. It begins with the unbearable burden of the mother earth caused by the multitudes of worldly sins and her prayer to be relieved of the same. The Puranas give in detail the description of her visit to the Vishnu Loka and of her complaint represented there in the form of a cow. Then comes the promise kindly given of a particular incarnation on the earth and the assurance of redressing all her grievancesby necessary actions. This little prologue is quietly introduced without giving any cause for suspicion like many other incidents, and is invariably passed over without feeling any difficulty. But with a slight waking from slumber, one is sure to find himself in the midst of a riddle. Earth in any known form such as a garden, field, hill or valley has never been seen complaining to anybody of any matter. Nor is the idea of her going away to some other Loka easily imaginable by those who are helplessly bound down to her surface. The difficulty is augmented by having to imagine in addition that her representations are made in the form of a cow. The mute cow is as unqualified for this serious purpose as the dead material with which the earth is composed. First of all how could the earthy globe itself be affected by burden or weight created by worldly sins is a fit subject for scientific enquiry. How she could easily transform herself into a cow and travel to etherial regions in that state without wings provided, are impossibilities in physical nature. The representations of grievances in human language by a cow are beyond ordinary comprehension. If she were described as having taken a woman's form at least it would have given us some relief, but it is evident from the various Puranas that the ancient sages are not prepared to grant even that much. In these circumstances there is no other go but to resort to our venerable pundits for help who always stand unshaken like an adamantine rock to face all possible difficulties in this direction. They have their ready solution at hand which they are ever generous to offer gratis. "In olden days the Godess earth could represent her grievances wherever she likes and she is able to do this in the form of a cow", is virtually the explanation. Blessed are those who are satisfied with this enlightened explanation. But unfortunately the majority of mankind could not afford with their poor brains to grasp the magnitude of wisdom imbedded in the explanation. However it ispractically useless to proceed with the stories narrated in thePuranas and Ithihasas without understanding the correctmeaning of this introduction here referred to, and it is certainthat until it is satisfactorily explained, no reliance canbe placed on any further interpretation of the subsequentpassages in the texts. But there is an impression prevailingin some quarters that the Vedas alone contain the purestand the oldest ideas of Hindu religion and that the Puranasand Ithihasas are subsequently added and are to a greatextent interspersed with mythical stories and rituals as wellas extraneous and sectarian matters. Their careful study istherefore considered unimportant as they do not come up to thehigh standard of the Vedas and Vedantas with which theyhave probably no concern. Much indifference is observableamong Sanskrit scholars generally in the study of this literature. The Puranas and Ithihasas do not seem to receive attheir hands even the interest usually evinced in novel reading.Detailed information shall be furnished on the subject in thesucceeding chapter but a mere reference may be made to ithere by the following quotation showing their importantrelation to the Vedas and Vedangas.

**यो विद्याच्चतुरो वेदान् साङ्गोपनिषदो द्विजः।  
नचेत्पुराणं संविद्यान्नैव सस्याद्विचक्षणः।  
इतिहासपुराणाभ्यां वेदं समुपबृंहयेत्।  
बिभेत्यल्पश्रुताद्वेदो मामयं प्रहरिष्यति।**

The Ithihasas and Puranas serve the purpose of commentariesto the Vedas. Partial knowledge without a study of themis so dangerous that the Vedas themselves seem to be afraidof such ignorant scholars.

**CHAPTER II.**

**RELIGIOUS TEXTS AND PHILOSOPHY.**

 OUR conspectus in the last chapter, of the varietiesof mistaken notions current on the ancient andsacred literature of our mother country, creates a necessityfor proper enquiries, with a view to determine, whether afterall, there is anything worth enquiring into or worth preserving as useful and valuable knowledge for the presentand future generations. It may be necessary for this purpose to stick to some convenient order of treatment lest welose the main and important points and fail to follow theconnected links in proper succession. The subjoined classification may be found sufficient to answer the requirements,although it is impossible to have exclusively distinct logicaldivisions in matters of this nature—

 (1) The classification of the Texts and the generalcharacter of the subjects treated therein.

 (2) A short description of the ideals of Hindu Philosophy and Religion.

 (3) Explanations of some of the Geographical details.

 (4) Interpretations of a few important historical incidents and the calculations of time connected therewith.

 (5) The meanings of personalities prominently figuringin these religious texts.

 For the sake of convenience, the last three namely3, 4 & 5 may be dealt with in a full separate chapter.The treatment of all the above points shall be mostly byquotations from the texts themselves rather than by offeringindependent and original suggestions or explanations. Itis unnecessary to reiterate here that the modern currentinterpretations and criticisms are entirely unwarrantedand unsupported by the contents of the texts and are therefore only mere inventions according to the fancy andcaprice of each critic who often voluntarily gives out hisopinions or sometimes feels bound to express, to maintainhis acknowledged position as an authority. In either casethe value of his opinions has only to be calculated upon hispersonal importance and not upon their correctness or cogency.For, if the opinions were only perfect as we are naturallyprone to believe, they should have been capable of beingcarried right-through every page of these texts without inconsistencies and irrelevancies. That this is seldom foundpossible has been amply proved. The only choice left for us under these circumstances is to come to the inevitableconclusion that the defects observed almost at every stepare either owing to the mistakes in the texts themselves, orowing to the unauthorized misinterpretation of the so-calledauthorities. But no modern critic however biased andunsympthetic has gone to the length of denying even literarycapacities to the venerable authors of the sacred Texts.ordinary Sanskrit scholar cannot fail to admire the beautiesof ancient literature and the immense wisdom of its authors.Under these circumstances it is neither useful nor safe toaccept any opinions as correct unless they are directly supported by evidence obtained from the texts themselves.

***SECTION 1.***

***The Classification of the Texts.***

** 1.** Knowledge or Vidya in the highest sense of theword is divided into two classes, the Practical and Theoretical,the Para and the Apara. Even the most sacred and importantVedas including all other sastras fall only under theTheoretical Division called Apara. The recognition of such a clearand distinct division is the peculiar characterestic of theIndian Philosophy and Indian religion. The highest knowledge to be attained as the Summumbonum of human existencetherefore lies beyond the plains of thought and reasoning:—

**द्वे विद्ये वेदितव्ये हि परा चैवापरा च ते।  
तत्राऽपरा तु विद्यैषा ऋग्वेदो यजुरेव च।  
सामवेदस्तथाथर्ववेदश्शिक्षा मुनीश्वर।  
कल्पो व्याकरणञ्चैव निरुक्तं छन्द एव च।  
ज्योतिषञ्च तथानात्मविषया अपि बुद्धयः।  
अथैषा परमा विद्या ययात्मा परमाक्षरम्।  
यत्तददृश्यमग्राह्यं अगोत्रं रूपवर्जितम्।  
अचक्षुश्रोत्रमत्यर्थं तदपाणिपदं तथा।  
नित्यं विभुं सर्वगतं सुसूक्ष्मं च तदव्ययम्।  
तद्भूतयोनिं पश्यन्ति धीरा आत्मानमात्मनि।  
तदेतदक्षरं सत्यं तद्विज्ञायविमुच्यते।  
ज्ञानेनैव हि संसारविनाशो नैवकर्मणा॥**

**रुद्रहृदयोपनिषत्।**

 The following is another similar logical classification ofthe subject into three divisions instead of two, namely ParaVidya and Bhranti.

**भ्रान्तिर्विद्या परं चेति शार्वं रूपं परे विदुः।  
अयथा बुद्धिरर्थेषु बहुधा भ्रान्तिरुच्यते।  
यथार्थाकारसंवित्तिः विधति परिकीर्त्यते।  
विकल्परहितं तत्त्वंपरमित्यभिधीयते।**

**श्रीशिवमहापुराणम्।**

**अर्थेषु बहुरूपेषु विज्ञानं भ्रान्तिरुच्यते।  
आत्माकारेणसंवित्तिर्बुद्धिर्विद्येति कीर्त्यते।**

**सौरपुराणम्।**

**आगमोक्तं विवेकाच्च द्विधाज्ञानं तदुच्यते।  
शब्दब्रह्मागममयं परं ब्रह्मविवेकजम्।  
अन्धंतम इवाज्ञानं दीपवच्चेन्द्रियोद्भवम्।  
यथा सूर्यस्तथाज्ञानं यद्विप्रर्षे विवेकजम्॥**

**विष्णुपुराणम्।**

 All perverted knowledge is Bhranti. All scientific knowledge is Vidya and the highest knowledge beyond Vidya isParom. The Vedas and all other Sastras will therefore beclassed under Vidya which is clearly defined as scientifictreatment of truth.

 The following is again another classification into Paroksham and Aparoksham Nganom.

**अस्ति ब्रह्मेति चेद्वेद परोक्षज्ञानमेव तत्।  
अहं ब्रह्मेति चेद्वेद साक्षात्कारस्स उच्यते।**

**वराहोपनिषत्।**

 The theoretical knowledge of the existence of theAbsolute and the Practical experience of the same are treatedas two distinct divisions of true knowledge.

 The Vedas and their divisions are detailed below:—

**निश्वासभूता मे विष्णोः वेदा जातास्सुविस्तराः।  
तिलेषु तैलवद्वेदे वेदान्तस्सुप्रतिष्ठितः।  
ऋग्वेदस्य तु शाखाः स्युः एकविंशति संख्यकाः।  
नवाधिकशतं शाखा यजुषो मारुतात्मज।  
सहस्रसंख्यया जाताः शाखास्साम्नः परन्तप।  
अथर्वणस्य, शाखाः स्युः पञ्चाशद्भेदतो हरे।  
एकैकस्यास्तु शाखाया एकैकोपनिषन्मता॥**

**मुक्तिकोपनिषत्।**

 The Vedas originated from the breath of Vishnu. TheVedanta is their imbedded essence. The Ric Veda has 21branches or sub-divisions. The Yajus contains 109. TheSama 1000 and the Atharva 50: Total 1180. Each branchor Sakha has an Upanishat attached.

 Vidya consists of the following 14 subjects.

**अङ्गानि वेदाश्चत्वारो मीमांसा न्यायविस्तरः।  
पुराणं धर्मशास्त्रञ्च विद्या एताश्चतुर्दश।  
यया स देवो भगवान् विद्यया विद्यते परः।  
साक्षादेव हृषीकेशः तत् ज्ञानमिति कीर्तितम्॥**

**पद्मपुराणम्।**

 The chief among these the Veda is virtually single andit has also a single meaning. The Ithihasas and Puranasare its commentaries, and other texts will not be religiouslyrecognised which do not coincide with this Veda in theirapplication.

**इतिहासपुराणाभ्यां वेदं समुपबृंहयेत्।  
वेदाः प्रमाणं प्रथमं स्वत एव ततःपरम्।  
स्मृतयश्च पुराणानि भारतं मुनिपुङ्गवाः।  
अन्यान्यपि मुनिश्रेष्ठाः शास्त्राणि सुबहूनि च।  
सर्वं वेदाविरोधेन प्रमाणं नान्यवर्त्मना।  
एक एव द्विजा वेदो वेदार्थश्चैक एव तु॥**

**सूतसंहिता।**

 That the Veda is but one is reiterated in various texte.Its subdivisions as well as the Puranas are only meant for theclear understanding of its meanings.

**एकवेदस्य चाज्ञानात् वेदास्ते बहबः कृताः॥**

**महाभारतम्।**

**द्वापरे द्वापरे विष्णुर्व्यासरूपेण सर्वदा।  
वेदमेकं सबहुधा कुरुते हितकाम्यया।  
अल्पायुषोऽल्पबुद्धींश्च विप्रान् ज्ञात्वा कलावथ।  
पुराणसंहितां पुण्यां कुरुतेऽसौ युगे युगे।**

**स्त्रीशूद्रद्विजबन्धूनां न वेदश्रवणं मतम्।  
तेषामेव हितार्थाय पुराणानि कृतानि च।**

**देवीभागवतम्।**

 The following clearly states what is really the onlymeaning of the Veda or its subdivisions.

**श्रुतिस्मृतिपुराणानि प्राहुरेकत्वमात्मनः।  
अनुग्राहकतर्कश्च कुरुते तर्कवेदनम्।  
शिवागमेषु चाद्वैतं बभाषे परमेश्वरः।  
नारायणोऽपि चाद्वैतं बभाषे स्वागमेषु च।  
अन्ये च योगिनः सर्वे प्राहुरद्वैतमात्मनः।  
तथापि परमाद्वैतं नैव वांछन्ति मानवाः।  
केचित्सामान्यमद्वैतं वदन्ति भ्रान्तचेतसः।  
विशेषं द्वैतमाश्रित्यन तेषामस्तिवेदनम्।  
द्वैतमेव हि सर्वत्र प्रवदन्ति हि केचन।  
न ते मनुष्याःकीटाश्चपतङ्गाश्च कटा हि ते॥**

**सूतसंहिता।**

 "The Vedas, Smritis, Puranas, science of logic and allthe Agamas unanimously treat of the Oneness of the Supreme.The Yogis express the same opinion from their direct experience, and yet few are prepared to accept it. Some allowit to a small extent as a matter of courtesy and they are surelyfools. But there are others, who totally deny it and theyare neither human beings nor even the lowest kind of worms.They could only be treated as dead clod of earth".

 What is meant by Sruti or Veda has been already explained as the knowledge theoretically obtained from thegreat Rishis of their experience and results of experiments.The vedangas, six in number, come next. They are namedbelow—

**छन्दः पादौ तु वेदस्य हस्तौ कल्पेऽथ पठ्यते।  
ज्योतिषामयनं चक्षुर्निरुक्तं श्रोत्रमुच्यते।  
शिक्षाघ्राणन्तु वेदस्य मुखं व्याकरणं स्मृतम्।  
तस्मात्साङ्गमधीत्यैवब्रह्मलोके महीयते॥**

** अर्थावबोधे निरपेक्षतया पदजातं यत्रोक्तं तन्निरुक्तम्॥**

 **छन्द्रः—** is metrical science, prosody.

 **कल्पः—**is a sacred precept or rule, low or ordinance.

 **ज्योतिषं—**is a tract on astronomy.

 **शिक्षा—**is the science which teaches the proper pronunciation of words and laws of euphony.

 **व्याकरणं—**is grammar, grammatical analysis.

 **निरुकं—** is etymological interpretation of words, especiallyof those occurring in the Vedas and which convey inthemselves without the help of other words, the intended meaning in full.

 A knowledge of these six angas or limbs of the Vedas isabsolutely necessary to understand the correct and fullmeaning of the contents of the Vedas. The last one **निरुक्तं**holds the position of a chapter on 'definition of terms used',found in all scientific treatises, without a knowledge of whichno one will be allowed to explain the subsequent portions ofthe text. It is however extremely doubtful whether many of the modern interpreters have ever known the existence ofsuch a treatise in their voluntary and mistaken elucidationsof these sacred religious books.

 The Smritis come next in the order of importance. Theyare defined as follows—

**श्रुतिस्तु धर्मोविज्ञेयो धर्मकामस्तु वै स्मृतिः।**

**भविष्यपुराणम्**

**मन्वन्तरस्यातीतस्य स्मृत्वाचारं पुनर्जगौ।  
तस्मात्स्मार्तः स्मृतो धर्मो वर्णाश्रमविभागजः।  
शेषशब्दात् शिष्ट इति शिष्टाचारः प्रचक्ष्यते।  
मन्वन्तरेषु ये शिष्टा इह तिष्ठन्ति धार्मिकाः॥**

**वायुपुराणम्॥**

 The authors of the Smritis are here described as endowedwith the power of bringing back to their memory, theDharmas of the previous Manwanthara and hence calledSmritis.

 What is meant by a **मन्वन्तरं**may be examined later onin connection with 'Time' and the Sishtas or those thatremain after a **मन्वन्तरं**may be treated when speaking ofpersonalities. It is sufficient to note here the technicalmeaning of Smriti as described in the texts and as specifiedabove.

 **2.** The next varieties of religious literature arecalled Itihasas and Puranas. The former slightly differsfrom the latter, as they deal with some specific subjects, theso-called histories such as the Ramayana and the MahaBharata; whereas the Puranas have other functions to fulfilin their treatment. The word Itihasa is commonly derivedas composed of **इति-ह** and **आस.** 'So it has been', history,legendary or traditional. It may be more aptly explainedas **इति + हासः**, that which is narrated in the form of aninteresting or funny story; and hence not real history.

 We next come to the Puranas. The word Purana is a termmost commonly used and equally abused. It therfore demands a very careful and detailed investigation to ascertainits correct meaning.

**पुरा परंपरां वष्टि पुराणं तेन वै स्मृतम्।  
निरुक्तिमस्य यो वेद सर्वपापैः प्रमुच्यते॥**

**पद्मपुराणम्॥**

**यस्मात्पुराह्यनन्तीदं पुराणं तेन तत् स्मृतम्।  
निरुक्तमस्ययोवेद सर्वपापैः प्रमुच्यते।  
नारायणः सर्वमिदं विश्वं व्याप्य प्रवर्तते।  
तस्याऽपि जगतः स्रष्टुः स्रष्टादेवो महेश्वरः।**

**अतश्च संक्षेपमिमं शृणुध्वम्।  
महेश्वरः सर्वमिदं पुराणम्।  
ससर्गकाले च करोति सर्गान्।  
संहारकाले पुनराददीत॥**

**वायुपुराणम्॥**

**श्रुतिस्मृतिपुराणानि विदुषां लोचनत्रयम्।  
यस्त्रिभिर्नयनैः पश्येत्सोंशो माहेश्वरो मतः।  
तिस्रो विद्या इमामुख्याः सर्वशास्त्रविनिर्णये ।  
पुराणं पञ्चमो वेदः इति ब्रह्मानुशासनम्।  
यो न वेदपुराणं हि न स वेदोऽत्र किञ्चन॥**

**स्कान्दपुराणम् । अवन्तीखण्डम्॥**

**आत्मनो द्विविधं प्राहुः परापर विभेदतः।  
द्वे ब्रह्मणीवेदितव्ये इति चाथर्वणीश्रुतिः।  
परस्तु निर्गुणः प्रोक्तःअहङ्कारयुतोऽपरः।  
तयोरंभेद विज्ञानं योग इत्यभिधीयते ।  
एवं भूतात्मकेदेहे यः साक्षी हृदये स्थितः।  
अपरः प्रोच्यतेसद्भिः परमात्मा परः स्मृतः।  
शरीरं क्षेत्रमित्याहुस्तस्थः क्षेत्रज्ञ उच्यते।  
अव्यक्तः परमःशुद्धः परिपूर्ण उदाहृतः॥**

**अकारादिक्षकारन्त वर्णभेद व्यवस्थितः।  
पुराणपुरुषोऽनादिः शब्दब्रह्मेति गीयते।  
पश्चभूतात्मकेदेहे ह्यन्तःकरणसंयुतः।  
पुराणपुरुषो देवः अपरात्मेति कीर्त्यते॥**

**ब्रहन्नारदपुराणम्॥**

 The first definition somewhat conveys a double meaning **परम्परा** may be interpreted in the usual sense of geneological descent and its history; but the latter half of thecouplet requiring us to understand the gist of the subject bythe application of Niruktam, clearly refers to a more seriousinterpretation. This portion of the couplet is invariablyfound repeated wherever a technical meaning is speciallyintended, a knowledge of which is said to remove all oursins. Great religious importance is thus attributed to themere knowledge of the meaning conveyed in accordance withthe rules of Niruktam. In the Maha Bharata, Adi Parva,we find

**महत्वाञ्चैव भारत्वात् महाभारतमुच्यते।  
निरुक्तं तस्ययो वेद सर्वपापैः प्रमुच्यते॥**

 The necessity to enquire in a particular method of interpretation is thus evidently established by the contents of thetexts themselves. No clearer evidence is possible or necessaryto be adduced to convince us of the fact that the authorsof these hoary texts really meant something deeper than thecurrent and ordinary meanings that could be easily gatheredfrom their surface. Important clues furnished in thismanner, wherever found necessary, are not taken advantageof, nor are they treated with better ccnsideration than thepassages above or below them.

 *Definition No. 1.* To come back to the words underreference, **परम्परां**may be broken into two, **परं** and **परां;** theformer referring to the supreme Brahman and the latter toMaya or Sakti. Thus a compound of **परं**and **परां**will clearlybe indicative of the combination of both.

**परश्च पुरुषोज्ञेयः प्रकृतिश्च परास्मृता।  
यस्मात्पुर्यनुशेते च तस्मात्पुरुष उच्यते॥**

**वायुपुराणम्।**

 It is not difficult now to arrive at the real technicalmeaning of the term Puranom. It is meant to treat, as wehave seen, of Parom or the Supreme as combined with Mayaa treatment of the Parom *in itself,* by description in words,being an impossibility.

**यतो वाचो निवर्तन्ते अप्राप्य मनसा सह । श्रुतिः**

 Thoughts and words are incapable of penetrating thatregion of Parom. Another definition of **परम्परा** is equallyrelevant here.

**देहादभ्यन्तरः प्राणः प्राणादभ्यन्तरं मनः।  
ततः कर्ता ततो मोक्तागुहासेयं परम्परा।**

**पञ्चदशी।**

 Prana or life breath is inside the physical body, manasor mind lies within the Prana, Karta or actor is withinthe mind and the Bhokta or enjoyer is still within. Thesuccessive internal cavities or guhas here described are calledthe Parampara.

 *Def. No. 2.* from Vayupurana, clearly affirms that theterm Puranom refers to the Ultimate Entity from which thecreated Universe has first originated. There is hardly anyambiguity or uncertainty in this description. 'Narayana isthe essence pervading every where, himself having originatedfrom Maheswara. Thus the Puranom may be briefly explained as refering distinctly to Maheswara who takes tocreation and destruction at fixed periods.

 *Def. No. 3.* Skanda Puranom, says that, "Sruti, Smritiand Purana are the three eyes of the learned. When theyare able to see everything properly, through these eyes, theybecome part of Maheswara himself.

 Puranom is recognised by Brahma as the fifth Veda.Therefore, he knows nothing who knows not the Puranom".

 *Def. No. 4.* Brahat Narada Purana, classifies Atmainto Para and Apara. Para is without any attributes andApara is connected with Egoism and mind. The body composed of the five elements is called the Kshetra and theAparatma located inside the body is known by the namesKshetragna, Sabda-brahma and Puranapurusha. Althoughthe Para and Apara are virtually one, the latter is distinguished from the former owing to the existence of egoismand mental functions. When these mental functions andegoism are destroyed by the proceses prescribed for the same,the knowledge of the identity of both will be acquired. Theprocesses prescribed are the rules of Yoga. The word Puranapurusha meaning the subject matter of the Puranas, gives acomplete clue to their real contents. The current interpretation therefore as pure historical treatment of the reigns of sovereigns of the Solar and Lunar dynasties in India is a sheer mistake, consequent on the outer forms of narrationsand the details of personalities and actions described in thedisguise of human stories. But every intelligent and carefulreader will be compelled to confess that there are morereasons to take them for fables than to style them histories,but for some reason or other there is a strong tendency to erron the side of history rather than on the side of fables.

 It will be a matter of great advantage to examine atthis stage, the requirements of a Purana or the rules prescribed for and followed in its proper composition. These arelikely to furnish us with very useful clues for arriving atdefinite conclusions.

**प्रक्रिया प्रथमे पादे कथावस्तु परिग्रहः।  
अनुषङ्ग उपोद्धात उपसंहार एव च।

 Quotations Nos. 1 and 2 mention the four divisionsevery Purana should consist of. First comes the descriptionsof the qualified persons privileged to study and make use ofthe instructions given in a Purana. The second divisionrefers to the real subject aimed at in its usual treatment inthe Puranic style. The third division gives the clue as tohow the narration of stories and events should be interpretedso as to apply to the object in view. The fourth that is thelast division specifies the results to be attained by a study ofthe particular Purana.

 It is pretty clear from these distinct divisions themselves that the subject actually dealt with is different fromwhat would appear on the surface and that the ultimate object aimed at is something higher and more importantthan the mere knowledge to be attained by a study ofhuman history. Little or no trouble is needed to discover thatthe Puranas are unlike the histories retained by the moderncivilized nations of the West. Incongruities in shapes andforms, impossibilities in Physics and Chemistry, inconsistencies in Geography and Astronomy, irrelevancies in Arithmeticand Geometry are not wanting in any of their sacred pages.In spite of these facts however, no honest scholar of Sanskritventures to cry down the literary capacities and the practicalwisdom of the apparently crazy authors of these texts. Andyet unfortunately, few are interested in searching for theirreal significance, nor prepared to admit the possibility orprobability of finding useful and valuable materials in theirmidst.

 Quotation number 3 gives the well-known classificationof the requirements or Lakshanoms to constitute a properPurana. The list of these items is in the mouth of almostevery Pundit. Except a recitation of these terms occasionallyto exhibit erudition, no trouble has ever been taken to lookinto their reference. There is generally a preconceivedopinion as to these terms applying to some well-knowncircumstances detailed in the Puranas with which all aresupposed to be very familiar. The words **सर्ग** and **प्रतिसर्ग**are sometimes explained very curiously. To state theseexplanations here would be unnecessary for our present purpose and might appear even insulting. It is sufficient if theywould now condescend to notice the clear and detailed elucidations provided in the texts themselves. A loose translation of the passage here quoted will I trust be a safer andmore effective method of explaining the ideas so vividly expressed therein. "Sarga, Pratisarga, Vamsa, Manwantaraand Vamsanucharita are the five characteristic marks of aPurana. The Eternal Supreme devoid of attributes is firsttreated as changing, and as pervading everywhere as well asthe substratum of everything. It is said to possess threesaktis are forces called Rajas, Thamas and Satwa from whichthree Godesses by name Saraswathy, Maha-Kauli and Maha-Lakshmi originated and took bodily form. An introductionof this kind is first started by the Great Sages toexplaincreation.This introduction up to this stage is styled *'Sarga'*.The further description of the origin of Brahma, Vishnu andRudra, for the purpose of explaining creation, preservationand destruction is called *'Pratisarga'* The description ofManus from Swayambhuva downwards is called *'Vamsa'*, orfamily. The intervals of time between the various Manus is *'Manwantara'*. The description of the Manus' families is*'Vamsanucharita'*. The following quotations will throwfurther light on the subject.

 The 18 Puranas and the 18 Upapuranas refer to the36 Tatwas or categories of Philosophical analysis,representing different stages of religious development. The Puranasin all make up the important limbs of Maha Vishnu as detailed in the above quotation, meaning thereby that a knowledge of all the Puranas will bring about a complete kuowledge of the Supreme.

 Amomg the l4 Vidyas dealt with in this section, wehave yet two more left namely, **मीमांसा** and **न्याय.**

 **पूर्वमीमांसा** or **कर्ममीमांसा** and **उत्तरमीमांसा** are two divisionsof **मीमांसा**.The former concerns itself chiefly with thecorrect interpretation of the ritual of the Veda and the latterdealing chiefly with the nature of the Supreme spirit. **न्याय**is the science of Logic.

 **3.**The above classification into 14 Vidyas almostexhausts what is known and understood as the ancient religious literature of India. It may not here be possible tocriticise the classification itself as illogical or purposeless, asthe different texts enumerated treat of sufficiently distincttopics more or less connected with the main subject. It is notconfidently hoped however that the usual modern criticisms concerning their genuineness or antiquity will not be readilyapplied. But even the inmediate possibilities of such a contingency need not frighten us out of our wits particularly onaccount of the very low and harmless position we occupy.In our humble enterprise, we have no matters of Archæological or geological importance to establish for or againstcurrent theories of modern science. Possessing as we do theold world simplicity with which we are often sneeringlydubbed, we can safely and conveniently dive deep into thehearts of our beloved and venerable forefathers, without thedignity and pomp of modern methods. Our main object isonly to pick up useful information from the materials bequeathed to us with sympathy and mercy. That we aresomehow in possession of such relgious literature is beyondquestion or dispute. Whether they are the products of comparatively recent or ancient brains need not disturb us at thisstage. Until at least the result of the present enquiry isascertained we can well afford to take patience in followingtheir authors in their own strain, without entertaining uncharitable and unprofitable presumptions even against theircommon sense.

***SECTION II.***

** 1.** A brief sketch is here given of the Hindu Philosophical system, including ethics and religion. No seriousor important dissertations are meant to be attempted. The magnitude of the subject as well as the poverty of my ownknowledge will not permit of such a treatment. The philosophical view of the existence of the world is explained in thefollowing extracts.

**सरस्वतीरहस्योपनिषत्।**

 The philosophical theories clearly and distinctly expressed in these quotations from the Upanishads whosegenuinness and antiquity have not yet been completelydisproved, could be easily understood as nothing illogical orantiquated as compared with the conclusions arrived at bymodern philosophers. The first three passages quoted totallydeny the existence of the objective world except as the products of mental modifications. This is exactly the view ofthe 'Pure Idealists' of the Western schools of thought. Thesubstratum of the whole cosmological conception of the livingorganic creation is mind-stuff and nothing else.Man oranimal creates his or its own cosmology by the mind itself.All the miseries of the world are therefore self-created.The arguments generally brought forward by the materialistsand constructive idealists against Pure Idealism cannot standthe test of reason and logic.

 Concerning the negative character of the Indian theory,there is no likelihood of dis-agreement from the westernphilosophers themselves. But our philosophy positivelyasserts the nature of the residue left after the philosophicalelimination of the material creation. **सच्चिदानन्द** are the threeattributes of the Supreme Bramhan which eternally remainsunchanged. This Bramhan is the ultimate cause of everyexternal and ephemeral existence. Quotation number 4details the course of arguments generally followed in theIndian System. The evolution from the Bramhan is byreflection on the Maya or Prakriti. The reflected Bramhanis the almighty and all-knowing Easwara or Lord. TheMaya is endowed with two Saktis, the Vikshepa andAvarana. The former creates everything known as theuniverse, the latter conceals or veils the truth and preventsthe differentiation of subject and object, both external andinternal. A further reflection on the Intellect or Avidya isthe individual soul called Jiva. When the ideas of Mayaand Avidya, Easwara and Jiva are destroyed, the originalSupreme Bramhan is attained. **अस्ति भाति प्रियंरूपं नाम** are thefive qualities which constitute everything. The first three**अस्ति भाति प्रियं** or **सच्चिदानन्दं,** Eternity, Pure Intelligence andbliss, are the attributes of Bramhan, and **रूपं, नामं** or formand name belong to everything in the created universe. Butthe three qualities assigned to the pure Bramhan devoid ofattributes should be taken to refer to it only in comparisonto the nature of the external world of form and name andalso as diametrically opposed to the same.

 **2.** A few important points touching the subjects ofEvolution and Involution may be detailed here, especiallyas the style of Indian raciocinations is some what differentfrom the western method. The question of cause and effectmay be first taken up for consideration. The most vexedpoint at issue is clearly this. How did the material universeoriginate and how could it originate from the Supremespirit ?

**उपादानं त्रिधाभिन्नं विवर्तिपरिणामि च।  
आरम्बकं च तत्रान्त्यौ न निरंशेऽवकाशिनौ।  
आरम्भवादिनोन्यस्मादन्यस्योत्पत्तिमूचिरे।

निरंशेप्यस्त्यसौव्योम्नितलमालिन्यकल्पनात्।  
ततोनिरंश आनन्दे विवर्तो जगदिष्यताम्॥**

**पञ्चदशी।**

 The material cause or Upadana-karana may be of threevarieties. Arambha, Parinami and Vivartha. The Arambhais known as in the production of a cloth from threads. TheParinami is by a change, as curd from milk, pot from clayand ornament from gold. The Vivartha refers to an appearance of change but without any actual change, as the appearance of a snake from a rope. The material world is thus theproduct of Vivartha from the indivisible Supreme spirit, asthe idea of space and blue tint in the Akasa or firmament.

** 3.**The next point to be considered is the nature ofthis supreme spirit which is completely different from everything perceivable or imaginable.

 "The pure knowledge, Intelligence or consciousness thatremains after the elimination of every possible variety ofmental modification is the supreme self or Bramhan. It isunlike the products of sensations or of imaginations. Thoughunknowable, it is not unexperienced being itself the self. Complete elimination of everything mundane does not end innon-entity, as the elimination is fully existent. Easwara andJiva produced by the reflection of the Self exist only as longas Maya and Avidya exist and receive the reflection. Easwaraand Jiva are therefore only relative terms like grand-fatherand father as related to the grandson and son.",

 **4.** The next important point to be necessarily considered is the possibility of identifying Jiva or individualsoul subject to all miseries and incapacities with the SupremeSpirit as required by the well-known canons **अहं ब्रह्मोस्मि** and**तत्वमसि.** I am that and Thou art that.

**सूतसंहिता।**

 A very clear and distinct differentiation is here given inthe most colloquial terms, of subjectivity and objectivity, of theperceiver and the perceived, the knower and the known, thethinker and the thought. Everything known or perceived isobjective or not-self, including one's own body, the senses,mind and intellect, as they are all subject to change and destruction. The objective world and the Ego are not confounded even by the lunatic. The self or knower without objectiveattributes is therefore the real meaning conveyed by theword Ahom or I. The well known Maha Vakya **अहं ब्रह्मास्मि**is thus easily explained in the above quotation. The following is on the same point.

**परिपूर्णः परात्मास्मिन् देहे विद्याधिकारिणी।  
बुद्धेः साक्षितयास्थित्वा स्फुरन्नहमितीर्यते।  
स्वतःपूर्णः परात्मात्र ब्रह्मशब्देन वर्णितः।  
अस्मीत्यैक्य परामर्शस्तेनब्रह्म भवाम्यहम्।**

**पञ्चदशी।**

 "The eternal and universal spirit standing aloof witnessing even the intellect and styling itself I or Ahom, is understood by the term Brahman. The identification of that Ahomand Brahman is the use and aim of the Maha-Vakya".

 Another important Maha-Vakya namely **तत्वमसि** issimilarly explained.

**एकमेवाद्वितीयं सन्नामरूपविवर्जितम्।

 "The individual soul residing in the body called Kutastastands aloof as a witness, unconnected with the sensationalintellectual or material functions that constitute a body, andforms the very foundation on which all these hallucinationsare built up. The Thou or **त्वं** in reality is this Kutastaitself. Similarly the Eternal Brahman serves as the foundation for all the cosmological conceptions of this varigatedUniverse. Thus the Kutasta and the Brahman when analysed ultimately resolve into one and the same substance.The ideas of Eswara, Jiva or Jagat are postulated and introduced in the Sruti not with the object of establishing theirreality but only for the purpose of explaining Brahmanwhose conception transcends the sphere of thought andwords.'

** 5.** We have now seen how the I or **अहं** and theThou or **त्वं** are explained as coinciding with the Brahmanwhen all the extraneous circumstances are rejected as irrelevant and ephemeral. A natural but naughty question wouldarise at this stage as to the very starting point from whichall the existing mistaken notions of the world have originated, and equally important is the question how and whythey did originate. Neither philosophically nor scientificallycould proper answers to these questions be easily obtained.

**वायुपुराणम्।**

 *Quotation No. I.* "Manas or mind which is at thebottom of all creation is technically styled **ब्रह्म** and **स्वयंभू.** Itsmodifications or thoughts arise one after another and create alldistinctions as Atma, body &c. When this flow of thoughtsis stopped, the universe the product of such thoughts isannihilated. Thus it is clear that the incessant current ofthoughts is necessary not only for creation but also forsustinance. This rising of thoughts of their own accord iscalled Avidya which literally means non-existence, and thewhole universe which appears solidified like adamant is thecreation of this non-entity and therefore worthless. Theunreality of this Maya or Avidya will become evident bysternly looking at its face, as it would then immediatelyvanish. There is no need for wasting time in enquiringabout its origin, but it is highly necessary to seek the meansfor its destruction. The successive transformations from theBrahman caused by vasana or past impressions or experienceare into Kshetragna, Ahankara, Intellect, mind, senses andmaterial body. Like the cacoon the Jiva gets itself entangledin its own meshes. It is only the mind that is known bydifferent names in its various aspects and conditions. Sometimes it assumes the form of **बुद्धि,** sometimes **अहङ्कार, प्रकृति,कर्म, माया, बन्ध, पुर्यष्टक, अविद्या** or **इछा.**The mind itself createsand takes the form of the five elements by processes of evolution. The creator. Bramha is the form of this mind and whenit is destroyed, its creation namely the universe is also annihilated. The gist of the whole theory of the above evolutionis that there is actually neither creation nor destruction.There is naught but selfimposed trouble."

 *Quotation No. II.* from Vayupurana speaks in thesame strain. **मनः, महान्, मतिः, ब्रह्मा, पूः, बुद्धिः, ख्यातिः ईश्वरः,प्रज्ञा चितिः, स्मृतिः, संवित्, विपुरं, भवः, कः, पुरुषः, स्वयम्भूः** are all synonymous terms with slight differences of meaning in theirspecial applications. This manas, Bramha or Easwara is saidto be the creator of the universe.

 The word manas as technically used here has thereforeto be clearly defined to avoid misunderstanding.

**मनो हि द्विविधं प्रोक्तं शुद्धञ्चा शुद्धमेव च ।  
अशुद्धं कामसम्पर्कात् शुद्धं कामविवर्जितम्।**

**मन एव मनुष्याणां कारणं बन्धमोक्षयोः।  
बन्धाय विषया सतं मुक्त्यैनिर्विषयं स्मृतम्॥**

**ज्ञेयं सर्वं प्रतीतञ्च तज्ञानं मन उच्यते।**

**मनुते सर्वभूतानां यस्माच्चेष्टा फलं विभुः।

**वायुपुराणं** already quoted.

 These definitions clearly point out that the referenceis to that pure substratum called Manas freed from all drossusually attached to it by worldly and impure associations.In that pure state called Satva, it is endowed with the powersof creation attributed to Bramha or Eswara: words synonymously used in these religious and philosophical texts.

 **6.** Further question likely to start up in this connection is concerning the varieties of creation and the variousconditions of happiness and misery existing in the world,All these differences are attributed to the Vasanas or impressions caused by previous Karma or actions.This argument more or less reduces the whole matter to the rigorouslaws of nature and virtually removes the necessity for postulating an Eswara or Lord of the Universe as specified above.This common view is criticised as unphilosophical and irreligious in our texts for the following reasons.

**स्वभावादेवसम्भूतं समस्तमितिकेचन।  
तन्नसिध्यति विप्रेन्द्राः देशकालाद्यपेक्षया।**  
**कर्मणैव समुत्पन्नं समस्तमिति केचन।

जगतः सम्भवो नाशः स्थितिश्च भवति द्विजाः।  
एवं कर्मानुरूपेण जगज्जन्मादियन्मया।  
एष स्वभावो विप्रेन्द्राः इति वेदार्थनिर्णयः॥**

**सूतसंहिता॥ ईश्वर उवाच॥**

**नचेश्वरत्वमीशस्य हीयते तावता यतः।  
अवश्यं भाविताप्येषां ईश्वरेणैव निर्मिता॥**

**पञ्चदशी।**

 The creation and destruction of this universe cannot beexplained by Nature alone, without supplementing itby time, space &c. In the same manner, neither Karmaitself nor Easwara himself could be said to be the sole cause,as Sruti and Smriti establish otherwise. But that a combination of Easwara and Karma carries on creation, preservation and destruction is what is really meant by nature or**स्वभाव.** And this is exactly the gist of explanations offeredin the Vedas. The laws of nature are in themselves the enforcement of the Lord. The passages quoted here establisha very important fact in philosophy which is seldom noticed,namely that the ideas of creation, preservation and destruction of the universe are themselves different for each individual. That the cosmological conceptions differ accordingto the nature capacity and environments of the individualsis an admitted theory among the philosophers of the West.The cosmological conception of the cottager is not the sameas that of the Townsman; that of the illiterate varies fromthat of a scientist or philosopher. Nay every new fact experienced affects or alters the conception in the same individual from time to time. This special fact conclusivelyestablishes the wisdom of our ancients in having answeredsuch questions in various ways and prescribed several methodsof religious practice. The modern mania for generalisationsand unifications of religious matters for the benefit of themasses is therefore only unphilosophical and unscientific.

 **7.** This almighty and all-knowing Easwara has allalong been described as only the reflection of the SupremeSpirit on Maya. The supposition of such an Easwara may beargued as illogical and unnecessary, as it is not perceptible. In such matters is it not sufficient to stop with Reason orIntellect lying within our own knowledge and experience ?The following passages meet arguments of this nature.

**ब्रह्मसर्वमितिज्ञानं ब्रह्मप्राप्तेस्तु साधनम्।  
जगन्मायेति विज्ञानम् अज्ञानं फलतो भवेत्।  
तथापि परमाद्वैतज्ञानस्येदं तु वेदनम्।

 *Quotation No. I.* "In addressing the ordinary peopleSruti takes up the world as it exists for them and explains itas the product of Maya, with a view to establish the necessityof annihilating it for the purpose of getting over the miseriesof the world. In dealing with the wise and the learned.Sruti affirms that everything is Brahman itself and deniesthe real existence of Jagat, Vidya or Avidya".

 *Q. No. II.* "The Sastras should be understood like themedical science whose main topics are the diseases andtheir remedy. The senses are incapable of grasping thenature of Easwara relating to his powers of creation anddestruction. The Sruti should therefore be entirely dependedupon as authority, meaning thereby that the instructionsof the sages who have directly experienced the facts detailed,should be believed in".

 *Q. No. III.* "The intellect without the reflection of theSupreme Spirit is as dull as a clod of earth. The perceptionof an object like a pot is with the help and blessing of thisreflection called Easwara and the knowledge of the objectis with the help of the supreme Brahman itself". This distinction in the process of preception and knowledge is recognised throughout the Theistic philosophy of the East andthe Indian Ontology is entirely based upon this philosophy.Even with the help of the reflected Easwara the Intellect canonly perform the act of perception, but not accomplish theact of knowledge. Its materiality or objectivity has beenalready noticed in the previous quotations.

**बुद्धेरचित्त्वं संग्राह्यं दृष्टत्वाज्जन्मनाशयोः॥**

 The intellect also has its birth and death like any othermaterial object. It is only an instrument of perception thathas to be used by something more spiritual and superior innature. The knowledge referred to should not be understoodin its ordinary sense. It specifies the real knowledge of thefalsity of objective existence.

**दृश्यं नास्तीति बोधेन मनसो दृश्यमार्जनम्।  
सम्पन्नश्चेत्तदुत्पन्ना परा निर्वाणनिर्वृतिः॥**

 The complete removal of the objective world from themind by a clear understanding of the unreality of its objectivecharacter, brings about Nirvana or freedom from bondage.What is meant by the removal of the world's objectivity isexplained below.

**नाप्रतीतिस्तयोर्बाधः किन्तु मिथ्यात्वनिश्चयः।  
नोचेत्सुषुप्तिमूर्छादौ मुच्येतायत्नतो जनः॥**

 It is the knowledge of the immateriality of the objectiveworld by a proper scientific analysis that is demanded for theattainment of Nirvana and not its non-perception in thewaking state of life. Otherwise, the attainment of salvationwould be a very easy affair within the reach of everybody bya simple loss of memory as in sleep, giddiness or intoxicationduring which states neither the objectivity nor subjectivityof the world is known.

 The idea of knowledge here detailed is exactly the pivoton which the practical philosophy or **स्वानुभूति** the exclusiveprivilege of the Hindu system hinges. The Hindu Theologywith its various branches and apparent inconsistencies amongthemselves is built upon this fundamental, philosophical andscientific foundation. All systems which stop with Reasonor **बुद्धितत्वं** cannot therefore appreciate or sympathise withthis Higher system of scientific Theology. This has virtuallybeen the fight between Hinduism and Bhudism in Indiaitself. There is thus no possibility of mincing matters without seriously attacking this special system in an acknowledgedscientific method. The modern attempt to commingle allpossible varieties of religion, science and philosophy in theworld, with the hope of producing an eclectic system congenialto all mankind without distinctions of any kind, is surely alogical impossibility demanding no arguments for its refutation. I refer to the new and curious creed styled Theosophywhich preaches Hinduism, admires Bhudism, believes in someother isms and probably practises none of them.To comeback to quotation No. 3. The meaning of reflection isexplained in detail. In the reflected figure an exact appearance of the original is observable without any of its qualities.Similarly the Atma is reflected in Maya producing a brightappearance but the reflected Easwara differs from the original,being subject to changes. If the idea of reflection is arguedas a product of the Intellect being conceieved by itself andtherefore not different from the Intellect, the Intellect itself may similarly be identified with the material body. Buteven after the death of the material body, the Intellect hasto reappear with its Vasana in accordance with the Karmictheory and therefore it cannot be reasonably identified withthe physical body. If Sruti is quoted as authority to establishthis separate existence of this Intellect, the existence of thereflection in question as distinct from the Intellect is equallyestablished by the very same Sruti. The Iteraya Upanishadclearly describes the constant transmigration of the Atmaaccompanied by the Intellect. If the Atma destitute of allattributes cannot reasonably be supposed to enter any physical body as described in the Sruti, it is equally unreasonableto maintain the usual presumption that this Atma is thecreator of this material world. At the end of a scientificanalysis, both of these presumptions may become false, butuntil that stage is reached by proper prescribed methodsthese distinct facts cannot be ignored.

** 8.** The following quotation from Panchadasi givesfurther elucidation of the distinctions of Maya, Easwara,Intellect &c.

 Maya is of three varieties according to the differentaspects in which it is observed. As treated in Sruti, it isinsignificant. As for as Reason goes it is inexplicable, asexperienced by the world it is true. It may be said to beindependent as it is unlike the Bramhan without attributesBut as it cannot act without the help of the Bramhan it isnot independent. The objective world is sufficiently clearto all but its real nature or origin is not easily discovered.Maya therefore is a falsity like the appearances in magic andthe attempts to find its nature by the greatest scientistsnecessarily end in Agnosticism. The power of producingthese appearances lies latent in sleep and it is called Maya.All the Vasanas or effects of Karmas of the waking anddreaming states lie latent in sleep like a tree in the seed.The Vasana or impressions unconciously left on the Intellect by good and bad Karmas, acts and thoughts, are lighted upby the Easwara or lord of every thing. He seats himselfwithin the Intellect of every creature commanding andcontrolling in accordance with the merit or demerit of respectiveKarmas. He is therefore almighty, being the efficient causefor creation, preservation and destruction. He is Himself thematerial cause of everything and is therefore everywhere. Thesefacts are most clearly expressed all over the Sruti.Whathe does is in accordance with the strictest laws prescribed byHim. None can nullify or modify, and he is therefore theEaswara or lord of all. The ideas of creation, presrvationand destruction naturally imply considerations of time. Butthis should not be misunderstood as establishing the realexistence of time, while Philosophical analysis denies italtogether. It is only allowed to be introduced in discussingwith students who have all along grown up in the trammelsof time. The question of free will and necessity need notinterfere with the facts detailed here. The Srutis and Smritisare His own enactments which cannot be disobeyed withimpunity. Easwara the lord of creation. preservation anddestruction in accordance with the Vasanas specified above,is thus not a poetical idea or a convenient theory, but a sternfact which cannot be ignored by any ingeneous tricks orscientific discoveries. He is all powerful, all-wise and allpervading. His laws will therefore be carried out to thevery letter.His orders inust be obeyal for fear of penalty.But at the same time, He is all-merciful towards his childrenbeing the Father of all. He has also most kindly prescribedlaws and procedure in the Srutia and Smritis for atonementand redemption. The reconciliation of the antagonistic theories of Free-will and necessity is easily arranged by a cleardistinction between enforcement of laws and freedom ofaction as two different facts altogether. In spite of unavoidable and complete dependence of a peculiar character, the willis allowed full freedom for its display

**आत्मचैतन्यमाश्रित्य देहेन्द्रियमनोधियः।**  
**स्वकीयार्थेषु वर्तन्ते सूर्यालोकं यथा जनाः।**

 "Depending generally on the Atma, the Intellect, mindsenses and body all act.freely according to their own inclinations, as the people in the world take to their own respectiveworks when the sun shines during the day". Thus accordingto the description given here, free will and necessity are notcontrary subjects. Every one is personally responsible forhis own actions and the rigorous law to enjoy or sufferaccording to the merit or demerit of his Karmas must beobeyed. The law is enforced by Easwara and concessionsare given by His own law when the Karmas ordained for thesame are properly performed. But the general rule is,

**अवश्यमनुभोक्तव्यं कृतं कर्म शुभाशुभम्॥**

 The results of every Karma good or bad will be metedout without fail. Here the question recurs as to the life ofthe gnanis who have virtually crossed the ocean of Karmasin this life itself. It is generally believed that Prarabdha orthe commenced life can only end by enjoying or suffering theeffects of all the Karmas, be he gnani or otherwise. Thetexts however have a different version of the theory.

 *Quotation No. I.* No Prarabda can be attributed tothe gnani enjoying the bliss of Brahman by its knowledgeand experience. He is not affected by the effects of Karmasafterwards, if he is, he is no real gnani but & hypocrite.When the ideas of pleasure and pain are relinquishedPrarabdha becomes meaningless. As dreams vanish when thewaking stage commences, the effects of all the past Karmasvanish when true knowledge is attained. To satisfy theunwise by assigning a reason for the existence of bodies,Sruti gives an explanation by tangible facts. But it is notdone with the object of making the wise believe in theirreal existence. There is but one Brahman and nothing else.All knowledge and experience is of the self and self alone.

 *Q. No. II.* The Gita clearly affirms that as cart loadsof fuel are destroyed by a spark of fire, all Karmas are destroyed by a spark of true kowledge.

 *Q. No III.* Prarabdham means the effects of Karmasin the previous lives. After the attainment of true knowledge births and deaths become false like dreams in the waking state. A rope is mistaken for a serpent through ignoranceand the serpent vanishes when the real nature of the rope isunderstood. Similarly when the unreality of the world isknown along with its real onuse the Brauman, the idea of thebody included in the physical world, vanishes and Prarabdhamgets destroyed.

 **9.** The next point for consideration is the natureand origin of Jiva or individual life and its relation toEaswara the lord of creation, preservation and destruction.

**(8) पञ्चदशी।**

 *Quotation No. I.* Two birds namely Jiva and Easwaraare seated together in this body, the former alone enjoyingthe fruits of action and the latter remaining unattached as awitness. The apparent differences among the Brahman,Easwara and Jiva are created by Maya through differencesin the material environments of Easwara and Jiva. Virtuallythere is no difference in their real nature, as the Akasas within a pot and a house, are the same as the Akasa found everywhere. The sinless Rishis experience this fact within theirown body but not those veiled by the effects of Maya.

 *Q. No. II.* The Physical body is really the temple ofEaswara who is identical with Jiva. When husk is removedfrom paddy it is known as rice, similarly Jiva becomes Easwara when it is not bound by the effects of Karma.

 *Q. No. III.* Jiva is more minute than the minutestatom. It is neither masculine, nor feminine nor neutral. Itgoes by the names of the varieties of bodies it takes.

 *Q. No. IV.* Jiva is the effect and Easwara the cause.Eliminating both of them, the supreme Brahman is attained.There are two meanings for the words **त्वं** and **तत्,** the Thouand the That. The one is known as **वाच्यार्थं**and the other**लक्ष्यार्थम् .** The **वाच्यार्थं** of Thon is associated with the physicalbody, senses &c; and that of That or **तत्** is the AlmightyEaswara. The **लक्ष्यार्थं** of both Jiva and Easwara is theSupreme Spirit itself. In accordance with the logical syllogism **सोऽयं देवदत्तः,** eliminating all the unimportant accessoriesof time, place &c., the ultimate conclusion arrived at is thesupreme Brahman common to both existing at all time.

 *Q. No. V.* The *Brahman* is the supreme spirit unaffected by Maya, but contains within itself all imaginablepowers or Saktis and appears as extending and filling everywhere through the Intellect, Egoism and the Elements. Itis described as pure, peaceful, blissful &c. and yet indescribable.

 *Prakriti or Maya* is the force or Sakti emanating fromthe Brahman in the form of Intellect capable of producingall varieties of creation.

 *The Easwara* is Bramhan itself as working throughMaya and becoming both the material and efficient cause ofeverything.

 *Jiva* is emersed in the ideas of form and name constituting the material world, on account of ignorance. Althoughit is virtually single, it became many owing to its takingseveral physical bodies.

 By the above definitions it is clear that Jiva and Easwara are not in reality different from the supreme Brahman,but are only different stages of existence in the transformation of the Brahman through Maya.

 *Q. No. VI.* "In this world filled with living creatures,the Easwara that enters the bodies and leaves them, takingwith him the mind and the senses, is himself a part of myown self".

 *Q. No. VII.* The following words are used as synonyms in ancient literature. Budhi, Manas, Linga, Mahan,Akshara, Jiva, Prana and Karana. There is ample scope formisinterpretation without a knowledge of this fact.

 *Q. No. VIII.* Maya is Prakriti and Easwara is thereflection of Brahman in it, called Mayina. He creates andenters different bodies in the form of Jiva. These facts are repeatedly affirmed in the Sruti. A combination of theLinga or subtle body and the reflected Easwara seated insidethe same, together with the Supreme Brahman which is anindispensible basis, is known by the term Jiva. The Mayawhich is endowed with the power of creating everything isalso capable of veiling truth and misleading Jiva What theEaswara creates, the Jiva enjoys according to the merits ofhis Karmas and capacity of his understanding, as a woman isthe creation of the father and the object of enjoyment for thehusband. Operating through Maya Easwara creates andoperating through mind Jiva enjoys. Easwara's creationsare definite but the ways of enjoyments by the Jivas areindefinite according to the varieties of mental modifications.A gem for instance, is a creation of Easwara. The Jivas areconnected with it in different manner. He rejoices who getsit. He is annoyed who gets it not. He who has relinquishedall desires of the world is indifferent. One and the samewoman is known to different relatives by different namessuch as mother, wife, sister, daughter &c. Having heardthe false news of the death of a son gone to a distant country,there is mourning, and without knowing the news of actualdeath there is no mourning. Thus it is clear that mind aloneis the cause of bondage for every Jiva.

 The substance of all the above philosophical analysis issummarised below.

 *Quotation No. I.* There is no bondage, no salvation,no existence, no non-existence, no creation, no destruction.These are only relative terms for ideas created by the Intellect. The Brahman is pure and free from these.

 *Q. No. II.* The essence of all the Vedantas is this:—Creation, destruction and freedom from both are all the workof the self.

 *Q. No. III.* The Easwara and Jiva are only part andparcel of the Self, and are the creations of Maya. Thecreation of the universe forming both its efficient and material cause is the work of Eswara from the waking stateup to the state of Salvation, all the worldy affairs andmiseries are the work of Jiva. The several systems ofYoga and Sankhya are based upon the mistaken theories ofthe real existence of Eswara or Jiva. Until however thetrue knowledge of Brahman is obtained all these theorists areonly raving. they get neither bliss nor salvation. Differencein their degrees of importance is of no avail, like that of abeggar or king as seen in a dream. When the Intellect isdrowned in ignorance it is called *Sleep*. But there is no sleepfor the Self where ignorance itself is drowned. Full andvigorous display or modifications of the Intellect is calledthe Waking state which cannot be attributed to the Bramhanfree from modifications of every kind. The working of theIntellect in the internal organs or nervous systems or itsmotion through them is known by the name of Dream. TheBramhan destitute of motion altogether has therefore nodream. It enjoys bliss in sleep free from all worldly affairs,but he who sees everything without distinction or differnceby the help of Bramhan is himself Vishnu, Siva or Bramha.The Samsara with all its miseries is but a dream of longduration and the length of the duration itself is but theweakness or perversity of the mind.

 *Q. No. IV.* Maya is like the Kama-Dhenu or the cowthat is endowed with the power of creating everything. TheEswara and Jiva are its calves, you may milk and drink anyamount of duality through them, but Unity or Advita aloneis the truth. The Akasa in the pot is nothing different fromthe Akasa proper. The knowledge of the fundamentalBramhan alone, is the way to Salvation.

 The fundamental principles of Indian Philosophy havebeen dealt with already here, by a more lengthy treatmentthan the scope and object of this little volume could permit.In the interest of profitable knowledge, it is useless to criticisethese priniciples by Archæological or geological methods.The theories expressed are so philosophical and cosmopolitanin character that they deserve serious consideration at thehands of all the civilized nations. They refer to pure philosophy and Psychology, supplemented by discoveries of definite practical methods yet unknown to western philosophers.The necessary foundations are here laid, for all moral, social,legal and other conducts of action in the practical world,without distinctions of caste or cread, age or sex. Thestandard by which any human actions or conduct should bejudged as right or wrong is sufficiently simple and strictlylogical as the only matter for consideration is to see how farthey tend to the advancement in the scale of progress to theultimate end, through definitely prescribed and defined stages.The ethical philosophy which gave so much scope for discussion in the west is more practically and conveniently dealtwith in India. The universal application of the principleslaid down will completely remove all possibilities of unsympathetic attacks on the score of sectarianism or exclusivenessconstantly attributed to the Hindu religion consequent onthe preservation of caste and social restrictions, which entirely belongs to the physical region. The human body itselfis often described in a sircastic style in religious texts, butalso in a most sympathetic and unsectarian fashion.

**(2) स्कान्दपुराणम्।**

 *Quotation No. I.* The physical body is very dirty andunholy. It originates in dirt and pollutions and ends withpollution. Every one happening to touch the same shouldbathe, meaning thereby that the identification of the selfwith it is very bad.

 *Q. No. 11.* Siva is everywhere and all the gods are in the physical body of even the illiterate. None could therefore be treated with contempt on any account. The violation of this rule is a sin and its strict observance by recognising the existence of gods in the human body leads to salvation. Such are the broad unsectarian principles of Ethicsenunciated in these religious texts.

 **10.** Having examined to some extent the outlineof the Indian Philosophy and of Ethics, it is necessary nowto see how religion is deduced from them. We have alreadyseen that mind is at the bottom of both good and evil. Themost essential object to be attained is therefore to obtaincomplete control over the same.

 *Quotation No. I.* The root of the Samsara tree withits multitudes of branches, is the mind. This root has therefore to be first dried up for the destruction of the tree. Theprocess for effecting this is not restricted in any manner.Either by squeezing the hands or biting the teeth or by anyother rough means, the mind must be somehow conquered.It matters not how it is done. But the most feasible andsensible methods are these. The study of philosophy, association with the wise and pious, to control the propensities ofthe mind, to control breathing &c. The propensities ofthe mind are of two kinds, holy and unholy, the formertends to destroy future births and the latter to increase them.These cannot be slighted as they are the net results of theexperience of hundreds of past births and lives. They willnot easily die out without long and constant efforts.

 *Q No. II.* No salvation is obtainable without the knowledge of the self, and this knowledge cannot be procured without long practice of Yoga. The Brahman is knowable only byoneself and only when properly qualified through Yoga practice. To an unqualified the Brahman is like colours to theblind. The Chitha or mind stuff is like water whose surfaceis ever ruffled by the wind. It cannot therefore be trusted inthat state. As long as it is intent upon various worldlymatters, it cannot be usefully worked for the purpose ofobtaining the knowledge of the Brahman. The practice ofYoga is therefore prescribed with the object of rendering themind calm and fit for superior work. But those who alreadypossess serene minds and are merely ignorant, need only theSankya Yoga or process of philosophical analysis.

 *Q. No. III.* There are two paths for attaining salvation. Gnana-yoga for the Sankhyas and Karına Yogya forthe Yogis. Arjuna asks,—What prompts sinful actionsforcibly even when one is not so inclined. Srikrishna says—Desire and anger are two inveterate enemies who obstructthe path to true knowledge and they are seated in the senses,mind and Intellect. Therefore you should control the sensesfirst and then overcome these two sinners.

 *Q. No. 1V.* The dwita of Jiva or the life in duality orrelativity is of two kinds, the Sastric and its opposite. Allthat pertains to the enquiry of the Brahman is sastric whichshall be relinquished only after the Brahman is known. Thenon-sastric is sub-divided into weak and strong. Those pertaining to desire or anger are strong and those arising fromfancies of the mind are weak. Both of these require to becurbed before and until the true knowledge is attained. Definite processes beginning with Sama are prescribed for thispurpose in the Sruti. They should also be relinquished afterprocuring the knowledge of the Brahman. Every piousKarma is superior to the action of the worldly. Sagunopasana or worship in some concrete form is superior to Karma.Nirgunopasara or worship in more abstract form is superiorstill. In fact, the more you approach the ultimate goal, themore valuable.

 *Q. N. V.* Two methods are prescribed for subduingthe mind, called Yoga and gnana, the former removesobstructions to real knowledge and the latter aids in correctperception. When the mind is subdued the Samsara orworldly miseries cease, as the worldly transactions cease withthe setting of the sun.

 *Q. No. VI.* Yoga is divided into two, Karma-yoga andGnana-yoga. Both are meant only for those possessing calmand undisturbed minds. The determination to do ordainedKarmas is Karma.yoga; to meditate upon the supreme Brahman is Gnana-yoga. The practice of both together will leadto salvation.

* Q. No. VII.* The proper possesses for controlling themind is called Yoga.

 *Q. No. VIII.* The real extinction of the working ofthe mind is Yoga.

 *Q. No. IX.* Stopping the working of the mind is Yoga.

 Thus we see clearly that in the development of religiouspractice, the fundamental and established philosophical factsare kept as the bases and gradual transitions are prescribedfrom the highest to the lowest stages, bearing always inmind the different grades of Intellect ever found in the practical world. No serious considerations appear to have beenbestowed in this matter in the direction of Archaeological andGeological researches or discoveries, but all importance isattached to the most scientific and practical Psychology,Éthics and physiology of man. Unless we remember thisfact throughout the enquiry of our subject we are sure to fallinto modern pit-falls in the elucidation of Hindu religion.All reasonable criticisms on moral, mental or physiologicalquestions connected with the subject may prove useful atleast to clear any doubts regarding the knowledge ourancients possessed. But all other attempts to pick holes byirrelevant methods will only fall out of the mark and proveunprofitable and uncharitable undertaking.

 The very first principle in Hindu Religion here enunciated is this Yoga which is classified into Gnana-yoga andKarma-yoga. It is absolutely necessary to form very clear ideasof these terms to avoid mistakes later on. We have alreadyhad several definitions of them in the previous quotations.The following passages may furnish additional explanations.

 *Q. No. I.* The merging of the mind into Atma is, defined as Yoga, by the wise. The joining of Prana and Apanabreaths together is also known as Yoga among some people.The attainment of worldly desires is also styled Yoga by theignorant, to whom of course real knowledge or salvation isout of question.

 *Q. No. II.* The Karmas ordained have originated fromthe Vedas and the Vedas from the Eternal Atma. TheKarmas being thus connected with the Eternal are requiredto be performed with the object of attaining the EternalAtman and with no other motive. They do not howeverrefer to those who have already attained the Atman and areenjoying Eternal bliss, as they have nothing to gain by theKarimas.

 *Q. No. III.* The Karmas are either evolving or involving in their character. Those combined with gnanacause involution and they should be followed for the attainment of the Supreme as they destroy sins and bring on Eternal Happiness. But those tending to evolve, only increaseworldly miseries.

 *Q. No. IV.* The Karmas are those ordained. Vikar,mas are those prohibited and Akarmas are those capableof producing no effects. Even the ordained ones should beperformed only so as to produce no effects relinquishing alldesires. The wise perform them in this manner. Gnana destroys the effects of all past Karmas as fire destroys fuel andleads to salvation. It is attained by constant practice ofYoga. Sankya and Yoga are not two distinctly separatemethods as their ultimate results are the sameis attained the other is also attained. There is no Sanyasawithout subduing the mind or relinquishing all desirescompletely as the word signifies. It is therefore synonymouswith Yoga. The Sanyasis and Yogis perform karmas without attachment, mentally, intellectually, physically and bythe mere senses with the object of purifying their hearts.Abandoning ordained karmas does not therefore inean Sanyasa or Yoga. Karmas are a matter of necesssity to thoseonly preparing for Yoga, but to those who have risen toYogi's stage, mental quietness is more important. He is saidto have risen to the state of a Yogi who is not led away bythe senses, effects of Karmas or desires of any kind. Thatwhich leads to the greatest gain and that which is not affectedby sorrows or pains, is described as Yoga. By the practiceof this Yoga, all sins are removed and extreme happiness isenjoyed by the pleasant contact with the Brahman.

 **11.** A very natural question which cannot bepassed over in this connection, is the one generally consideredmost important by common people, namely the utility of allthese practices prescribed in religion such as, Sankya. YogaKarma &c. Unless this can be scientifically proved andestablished it is impossible to convince any body of the necessity of religion. Any amount of authoritative injunctionsinsisting on blind belief cannot produce lasting or beneficialresults. It is therefore highly desirable to examine the textscarefully as to what cogent arguments are adduced for thispurpose.

 *Quotation No. I.* Relinquishlng all desires and egoismleads to peace of mind, ultimately to salvation—

 *Q. No II.* The inind is at the root of all worldlymiseries. It should therefore be scrutinised and purified. Itis also capable of producing every desired effects its servicesshould therefore be utilized for Yoga leading to Eternalhappiness.

 *Q. No. III.* The tendency of the mind ever to sproutwith desires produces grief. Destruction of this tendency isproductive of happiness. It should therefore bedirected forthe practice of Yoga which will soon overcome all the worldlymiseries.

 *Q. No. 1V.* After the destruction of egoism and theknowledge of Brahman, the mind enjoys felicity wherever itgoes. All doubts are then cleared and all sins are destroyed.

 These quotations clearly state that by the processes ordained, the existing miseries of the world are got over aswell as the future possibilities of the same. Besides, eternalhappiness or bliss is also attained. But what is the sort ofhappiness obtainable and whether it is worth aiming at withthe amount of trouble and inconvenience incidental to religious practices, are discussed in detail in the followingpassages.

 Ananda or happiness is classified into three sorts,Brahmananda, Vidyananda and Vishayananda; the last twobeing only varieties of the first. Before creation, the triad,namely knowledge, knower and the known is absent. Itbecomes absent in Samadhi, sleep and giddiness. In Samadhitherefore, the idea of enjoyment of happiness cannot belogically predicted, but the state of Samadhi is eternalbliss itself. It is self-luminent and need not be describedor measured.

 The happiness in sleep is next explained. In sleep theblind is not blind, the wounded is not wounded and the illis not ill. This is established by Sruti as well as by experience. It is no doubt from the absence of grief or painin sleep that the existence of happiness is inferred. Butthis argument cannot however be extended to the stones orother inorganic substances, which exhibit no signs of griefor pain. The inference of pleasure or pain enjoyed, isgenerally drawn from the external features of the livingbody which are absent in these. Downy cushions and otherconveniences for sleep are generally procured at great costand trouble. If there is no happiness in sleep why shouldthis be done? If they are meant for the removal of pain, theyought to cure diseases causing pain, which they do notThat these are capable of producing some comfort and pleasurebefore sleep may be admitted, but still the question of happiness alleged to exist during sleep remains unanswered.The explanaticn is as follows. The Jiva when tired ofthe waking state of life in which the triad (of knower, knownand knowledge) exists, returns to the Brahman its originalsource, and becoming one with it, obtains the Brahmaic felicity which is neither internal nor external like the happinessenjoyed in the fond embrace of a dearly beloved wife. Justbefore sleep, when all the mental functions are abated, theIntellect enjoys quietude and consequent felicity, with whichit emerges itself also into Ignorance or the cause body, whereall the effects of past Karmas or Vasanas get consolidated forthe time being like water into ice, or like a measure of ricereduced to flour losing the individuality of the grains. Thisstate is known as sleep, Agnana or Anandamayakosa. Agnanais established owing to the forced return to the miseries ofthe waking state, still to toil on in accordance with the effectsof previous Karmas.

 Whenever the mind turns inside leaving all the externalobjects, the Vasana, the symptom of Brahmaic felicity isexperienced. After the attainment of a desired object alsothe mind rests in contentment and the same sort of felicityis obtained. It is the same felicity that appears in all thethree states in different forms, in sleep, dream and wakingstate In the waking state it occupies the whole body likefire in a heated piece of iron and maintains the idea that 'Iam a human being &c.' In that state. happiness, grief andindifference or rest in contentment are experienced. Happiness and grief are related to action, indifference or rest toinaction. Happiness and grief are again either external andinternal, by actions and thought. The interim betweenhappiness and grief is rest; during which all people experienceand express the existence of a felicity on account of thewant of mental worries. The mere egoism, the feelingthat I am, is alone existent at the time. The felicity experienced under this condition is known as Vasanananda.Although it is not exactly the Brahmnaic felicity it has someof its symptoms. By contact with a pot filled with cold water,the feeling of cold is experienced though it is not the watercontained in the pot. This felicity increases in proportion tothe abandonment of egoism, which when completely abandonedfull felicity is procured. This is exactly the happiness obtained by Samadhi. It is unlike the consolidation of mentalfunctions in sleep, but it is the abandonment of all such functions. Samadhi is therefore not sleep and the scientific prooffor it lies in the fact that the physical body does not fallduring the process. When all the material objects are forgotten, that which remains is the Akasa or Ether. Whenthat idea is also eliminated, the Brahman is experieneed.It is not void or nothing, for the simple reason that it isunseen. The Akasa itself is unseen as no idea of it could beformed without light or darkness mixed with it. Bothare therefore ideas conceivable by the IntellectNihilists affirming non-existence cannot logically deny theexistence of the self. The discovery of the non-existence ofthe phenomenal which is destitute of foundation, confirmsthe existence of the self which is conscious of Nihilism itself.Similarly the happiness attached to the Brahman is likethat experieneed in the complete absence of pleasure andpain, which state of happiness is seldom enjoyed long, owingto the tendency of mind to bring on pleasure and pain constantly. Vidyanada or happiness arising from self-knowledgeis also a modification of the Intellect like Vishayananda ormaterial happiness. It is of four sorts: absence of pain ormisery—acquisition of the desired object, satisfaction ofhaving accomplished the proper work and the attianmentof what ought to be attained. By proper philosophicalanalysis and meditation, happiness accrues from the specifiedstates.

 In the analysis of material happiness or Vishayananda,the three states of mind have to be noticed. Namely, tranquil,(Santa) active, (Ghora) and ignorant (Moodha). Resignation,generosity &c. fall under tranquil modifications, avarice, passion, desire &c. come under active, folly and fear underignorant states of mind. The Brahman reflects in the mindaccording to the respective clearness of these states In theactive and ignorant states, the reflection is absent owing totheir want of clearness. In the tranquil state alone, thereis slight reflection at times.

 Existence, Intelligence and bliss are the three attributesof Brahman as already noticed. In clay, stone &c. there isonly, existence. In the active and ignorant states of mind,existence and Intelligence are present. In the tranquil statebliss also is present. When all the three attributes are thuspresent, it is known as Misra-Bramhan or mixed withBrahman. In Gnana and Yoga the connection of Brahmanis purer.

 The attributes of Maya are opposed to those of Brahmanas non-existence, dullness and misery. Man's horn is anexample of non-existence; dullness or want of intelligenceis perceivable in wood and stone; and misery in the activeand ignorant states of mind. In the tranquil state there is atouch of Brahman as already described.

 In consideration of all the facts detailed above regardingMaya, Brahman and mind, any one desirous of meditating onBrahman should reject non existence like man's horn etc. andmeditate on,

 (1) Existence, in stones etc. omiting their formsand names.

 (2) Existence and Intelligence, in active and ignorant states of mind.

 (3) Existence, intelligence and bliss, in tranquilstates of mind.

 These are the three kinds of meditation in their order ofimportance.

 The fourth and the most important one is meditation orVasanananda already described where all the functions of theIntellect are at a stand still. Complete bliss is attained bythis process and it is known as 'Bhumananda'.

 The above quotations give a complete idea of the definitePsychological theories long known to the ancient Rishis anddetailed in ancient religious literature. The theories are sological and so clear that they will not brook any wanton oroff-hand criticisms. The whole of it is pure Psychology untainted with any sectarianisms or superstitions, and too plainand unambiguous to allow any scope for esoterisms or occultisms except perhaps when read by those possessing extremely dull brains. The various grades of religious practiceordained, will and must conform to the general Psychologicalprinciples here enunciated. The real utility and religiousnecessity will therefore doubtless depend upon their conformity with them. All mischievous attempts to establish religious sanction for illogical and unscientific follies or wickedness should only be boldly rejected as stupid or pernicious asthe case may be. This work however is not so very difficultto accomplish with the help of common sense and liberal education. But the real difficulty and danger lie in the correctunderstanding of the meanings of practical details, expressedin the ancient style. Every earnest enquirer is likely to belead astray and to be easily disgusted, even by respectfullylistening to the ignorant, dogmatic and irrelevant interpretations of the modern self-constituted authorities, the majorityof them being completely innocent of such serious subjects.It is thus, that the purely vedantic portion of our religion issomewhat appreciated by Western scholars, but the practicaland most valuable portion is viewed with suspicion and considered mythological and unscientific. The main object of thisbook is to seek for reasonable explanations available in thetexts themselves with a view to remove the mistaken impressions, and if possible to create a scientific interest in the so-called mythologies. Most valuable and scientific truths contained in the sacred literature became mythical at first to theIndian Pundits themselves, owing to their degeneration andconsequent incapacity to understand them in their properlight. It is therefore no wonder and certainly no injusticethat alien nations with their present advanced civilizationshould criticise the same in the manner they do. It ishowever only surprising that they are so tolerent in spiteof the very flagrant absurdities shamelessly exhibited in thelocal interpretations.

 In these circumstances, it is highly necessary that ageneral description of the practical processes prescribed forreligious advancement should be noticed here, at least asbriefly as possible. Every text on the subject starts withYoga. This word has been sufficiently explained already invarious manner. But its root meaning, gives the exactapplication, namely Yuj, to join the lower self with thehigher, the Jivatma with the Paramatma. It is thus themost general term used in the Technology of this literature.Yoga is generally classified into Gnana-yoga and Karma-yoga, but the one is not completely exclusive of the other,the functions of thought or mind are more prominent in theformer and those of action in the latter. This main distinction however, is sometimes applied in a higher and oftenin a some-what lower sense. For instance, pure meditationof Bramhan is styled Gnana-yoga and other mental functionspreparatory to Dhyana or meditation are known as Karma-yoga, without having any reference to physical action.This is a higher and more philosophical application. Inthe same manner, more prominence being given to physicalaction, the religious Karmas performed, without any desirefor the fruits thereof are styled Karma yoga. In all thesehowever the prevailing idea is action, physical, mental or both, but not idleness, sleep or intoxication.

**( 4 ) श्रीजाबालदर्शनोपनिषत्**

 ***Quotation* *No. I*.,** Five kinds of Yoga in their orderof importance are here detailed, Mantra-Yoga; Sparsa-Yoga;Bhava-Yoga; Abhava-Yoga; and Maha-Yoga. All of themare productive of the eight wonderful powers called Ashtaaiswarya and all of them lead to Salvation. The utteringof a Mantra or Japa combined with meditation is knownas Mantra-Yoga. Practice of Prana-Yama or control ofbreath according to prescribed methods is called Sparsa-Yoga. The meditation of Bramhan as completely pervadingevery-where, both internally and externally, is styledBhava-Yoga The meditation of pure Brahman, forgettingthe phenomenal altogether, is called Abhava-Yoga. Leavingeven this meditation, the complete union with Brahman, isMaha-Yoga.

 ***Q. Nos.* *II. III & IV.*** These explain the componentparts of Yoga called Angas, and their subdivisions. Mostof these are defined in two different ways as already noticed.There is a higher and philosophical definition, as also, anordinary and less philosophical one, useful of course for theless qualified in religious practice.

** Quotation II** refers to 15 angas, while III and IV give only the usually known 8 Angas. The 8 Angas are explained below, together with the extra 7 which are moreor less included in them.

 1. Yama—The control of the senses arising throughknowledge obtained of the existence of Brahmanin everything, or loss of attachment to the sensesand the physical body.

 2. Niyama—is earnest desire to attain the state ofBrahman, or constant practice towards the attainment of the Brahman and for the elimination of itsobstructions.

 (a) Tyaga—is the elimination of all worldly desires.

 (b) Mounom—or complete silence is the worship ofBrahman which cannot be dealt with either bywords or thought.

 (c) Vijanom—or solitude is the all prevading Brahman itself, in which no idea of personality existsat any time.

 (d) Kala—or time means the Brahman possessingthe capacity to create in no time, the whole of theuniverse.

 3.Asana—is posture or that state of mind in whichthe contemplation of Bramhan is most convenientand pleasant, or complete indifference to allmundane affairs.

 (a) Sidha-Asana—is the contemplation of that Brahman which procures Sidhi or salvation.

 (b) Mula-Bandha—refers to the Brahman itselfwhich is the foundation for everything.

 (c) Samata—or keeping all the limbs in the bodyin proper position. This literal meaning is treatedas an inferior one and the idea of complete merging in the Brahman is explained as Sainata.

 (d) Drishti—or sight. Looking at the tip of thenose is not what is really meant but to keep thesight on the spot where the ideas of knower,known and knowing entirely vanish, *i. e.* Brahmanitself.

 4. Prana-yama—or regulation of breath. This isliterally meant only for the dull and less qualifiedpeople. To be assured that the external worldis but a hallucination is the real meaning, or tostop all mental functions by such assurance. Thethree processes of which it is composed are;

 Rechaka—or exhaling breath: this in the higher senserefers to the rejection of all false notions of the world.

 Pooraka—or inhaling: this similarly refers to thetaking in of the idea that there is nothing but Brahman.

 Kumbhaka—or filling in the breath: this also refersto the retaining of the idea that Brahman is the only reality.

 5. Prathyahara—turping of the mind inwards, havingclearly understood the real nature of the external.

 6. Dharana—or steadiness of mind, by perceivingBrahman everywhere.

 7. Dhyana—is the contemplation ofpure Brahman.

 8. Samadhi—is the highest state of Intellect afterthe Dhyana or contemplation itself is dropped.  
 The subdivisions of the 8 Angas above defined aredetailed below; First, Yama consists of:—

 1.Ahinsa—or harmlessness by thought, word anddeed, or the knowledge of Atma as incapable ofbeing injured.

 2. Satyam—or truthfulness, telling truth about whatis seen, heard or experienced, or the fact that Brahman alone is true.

 3. Asteyam—non-stealing, is not to desire for others'property either trifle or valuable, or not to confoundAtma with what it is not.

 4. Brahmacharyam—is chastity, or, direction ofmind towards Brahman.

 5. Daya—is mercy.

 6. Arjava—is sincerity.

 7.Kshema — is forgiveness.

 8. Dhriti— is self-command.

 9. Mita-Bhojana— proper and holy meals.

 10. Soucha — is purity of heart and body.

 Secondly-Niyama consists of:—

 1. Tapas — is penance; or earnest philosophical enquiry.

 2.Santosham — is contentment.

 3.Astikyam—is Theism.

 4. Dana — is charity.

 5. Easwara-poojanom, is worship of God without anyinjury to any created being.

 6. Sravana, is study of philosophy and religion.

 7. Hri, is blushing at everything unjust and irreligious.

 8. Mati, is determination.

 9. Japam, repetition of manthras, or study of religion and philosophy.

 10. Vratom is practice of devotion.

 Thirdly, different Asanas or postures conducive to thepractice of Yoga are detailed. They may not be of muchuse except to those who take to actual practice. They areall however supposed to have the additional effect of improving the physic by regulating the current of air throughoutthe body.

 The following are the names of usually known postures; Swastika, Gomukha, Veera, Yoga, Padma, Kukkuta,Uthana-kurma, Dhanu, Sinha, Bhadra, Mukta, Mayoora,Matsya, Sidha, Paschimamthana, and Sukha. The lastSukhasana is meant for feeble constitutions, unfit to practiseany others. Any posture in which the mind becomes.steadyis allowed for practice.

 In the above enumeration of the 8 Angas of Yogaand of their subdivisious, we see that the 20 duties prescribedin Yama and Niyama almost exhaust the moral and religiousduties required of man in any civilized country. Withoutcompletely adhering to all these duties, no one is qualifiedto enter the technical portions of Yoga commencing withAsana, Pranayama &c. All impostures as Yogis, by hypocrites, moral wrecks and selfish, humbugs are denounced inthe strongest terms.

**कर्मेन्द्रियाणि संयम्य य आस्ते मनसा स्मरन्।  
इन्द्रियार्थान् विमूढाद्मा मिथ्याचारस्य उच्यते॥**

**भगवद्गीता।**

 Without performing the duties ordained, all pretensionsby mere physical inaction combined with mental mischiefare surely, the characteristics of an extremely stupid hypocrite.

 It must be specially noted here that the moral necessityfor all these duties is enforced on the ground of their purifying the heart of man and of preparing him to higherstages of religious development. Unlike the theories of thewest, the standard of morality is simple and clear. Thatwhich conduces to take man near to his Creator is of religious and moral value. The psychological explanation forthis has been already given. The mind attains the SantaVriti in the performance of all these duties and the happiness resulting from an approach to the Brahman is realized.

**'नघोरासु न मूढासु शान्तासु च यथा सुखम् '॥**

 In this connection it is perhaps necessary to meet theoccasional criticisms proceeding from the west regarding theideas of Hindu worship, or Easwara-poojanom, one of the20 duties prescribed by Yama and Niyama. It is supposedthat the relation between God and man is conceived inIndia as one subsisting between master and servant withoutany scope for mutual love, that religion originates from fearof punishment and that worship is sought only as a meansof avoiding the same. This is indeed a very uncharitableview of every religion that admits God as the creator of theUniverse. Here the most natural conception of relation isthat of parent and child with ample scope for mutual love.

 (1) Raghuvamsa of Kalidas

**जगतः पितरौ वन्दे पार्वतीपरमेश्वरौ।**

 (2) Lalitha Sahasranama

**श्रीमाताश्रीमहाराज्ञी श्रीमत्सिंहासनेश्वरी।**

 The first natural idea of God under the circumstancesis that of a parent and the next one is that of a just ruler.Even understanding the matter in its ordinary significance,there is no scope for criticisms of the kind referred to.Besides, we have already seen that the philosophical conclusion arrived at is, that the Atman is the ultimate entityand it is identical with the real ego or Ahom, stripped of all,its gross environment.

**अयमात्मा परानन्दः परप्रेमास्पदं यतः।**

This Atman is therefore the only object for true love.Much less is the scope for the alleged criticism even from aphilosophical point of view. Bhakti or love for love's sakeis prescribed as the most important ingredient in the worshipof God, without which all formalities and rituals are pronounced to be entirely useless.

**भक्तिरेव गरीयसी।**

 The following classification of Bhakti may be of someinterest.

**त्रिविधा कथिताह्यत्र मनोवाक्कायसम्भवा।  
लौकिकी वैदिकीचान्या भवेदाध्यात्मिकी तथा।  
ध्यानधारणयाबुध्या रुद्राणां स्मरणं हि तत्।

योगजा मानसी व्यास रुद्रभक्तिः परा स्मृता॥**

**स्कान्दपुराणं, आवन्त्यखण्डम्॥**

 Bhakti or devotion is classified into those by mind,word or deed, also into Lowkika, Vydika and Adhyatmika.Bhakti by Dhyana and Dharana is mental; by control ofsenses, fasting &c. is physical, by worship with flowers,scents &c. is Lowkiki, by worship of fire, earth, air, sky, sunor moon is Dyvika; Bhakti by analysing the Tatwas according to the teachings of Sankhya is Adhyatmika, and bhaktiby regulation of breath &c. is Yogic.

 Before closing this section on the philosophical treatment of Hindu Religion, I am constrained to feel that areiteration of the argumentsadduced in our ancient literature for establishing the existence of a something calledBrahman or Atma, apart from Reason or Intellect, will notbe quite out of place, under the modern state of ignoranceof the subject. The vital distinction between Budhism andHinduism, or virtually between Atheism and Theisin isbased upon the absence or presence of this Atman. Allsystems which do not pass beyond the province of Reason orBudhi fall under some form of Budhism. The whole life ofthe Great Sankara appears to have been devoted to thefighting out of this important question in India against theBudhists. He is however, by no means the originator ofthis conception of Atma in India as it is the key-note of allIndian sacred literature. Nor are the incomplete theorieslike those of Budhism and its allied systems the discoveriesso to speak of any particular philosopher or Religionist inIndia as is mistakenly understood at present. The completephilosophical and scientific analysis of the subject taken upby our venerable Rishis of old, contains references, descriptions, criticisms and definite conclusions called Sidhantas onevery important point at marked stages of the analysis. Thescientific analysis of every subject will require this procedureto follow and will inevitably produce similar results. In aphilosophical analysis, all possible and plausible systemswill have to be enumerated, examined and criticized. It istherefore preposterous to affirm that any of the theoriesor con-clusions arrived at in the course of the logical treatment of a subject, are independent and subsequent discoveries of any particular person or persons. More so, whenthe matter in question is one that has been speciallynoticed, criticized and rejected as illogical and blasphemous.Budhism as already explained is a system that explainsevery thing by means of the Reasoning faculty or Budhidenying the existence of any substratum beyond. Budhior reasoning faculty is the ultimate terminus for thesetheorists. This was long found to be an inadequate andincomplete system of thought unable to explain any of theimportant and ultimate questions in philosophy. In fact,in our ancient treatises real philosophy worth the nameonly commences, at this very point of Budhistic terminus.The Vedanta specially deals with matters which ordinaryreason cannot account for. In the discussion of this serioussubject which is a boundary dispute between Theism andAtheism, no rhetorical quibbles or clever abuses will be of anyavail. It should be treated as an anxious scientific enquiryand no inferior matters should be unnecessarily thrust into confound the consideration of the main topic. Everytechnical word used in the course of the discussion shouldbe clearly defined and circumscribed so as to allow nomargin for prevarication. and the value of exact scientificconclusions inevitably arrived at should not be underrated on account of prejudices. The newness or strangeness ofthe facts should not interfere with their complete acceptanceas strict logical inferences.

**इन्द्रियाणि नरैः पञ्च षष्ठं तन्मन उच्यते।  
सप्तमी बुद्धिमेवाहु क्षेत्रज्ञं विद्धि चाष्टमम्।  
चक्षुरालोकनायैव संशयं कुरुते मनः।  
बुद्धि रध्यवसानाय साक्षी क्षेत्रज्ञ उच्यते॥**

**(1) ब्रह्मपुराणम्।**

 The five senses perform the perceptions of objects, thesixth factor mind or manas compares and discriminates andthus creates doubt, the seventh Reason or Budhi clearsdoubts and settles; the eighth Kshetragna or life principlestands witness to the functions of all these seven.

**भूमि रापोनलो वायुः खं मनो बुद्धिरेवच।  
अहङ्कार इतीयं मे भिन्ना प्रकृति रष्टधा।  
अपरेय मितस्त्वन्यां प्रकृतिं विद्धि मे पराम्।  
जीवभूतां महाबाहो ययेदं धार्यते जगत्।  
एतद्योनीनि भूतानि सर्वाणी त्युपधारय।  
अहं कृत्स्नस्य जगतः प्रभवः प्रलयस्तथा।  
मत्तः परतरं नान्यत् किश्चिदस्ति धनञ्जय।  
मयि सर्वमिदं प्रोक्तं सूत्रे मणिगणा इव॥**

**भगवद्गीता।**

 "The five subtle Elements,mind or manas. Budhi or Reason Ahamkarom or Egoism make up the 8 Prakritis calledApara or inferior, the life Principle or Jiva which supportsthe above is known as Para or superior Prakriti or Maya.There is nought in the universe which is not made up ofthese 9. But I am really the material and efficient causesof all of them. As beads strung in & thread, everythingis attached to me."

**इदं शरीरं कौन्तेय ! क्षेत्रमित्यभिधीयते।  
एतद्यो वेत्ति तं प्राहुः क्षेत्रज्ञ इति तद्विदः।  
क्षेत्रज्ञं चापि मां विद्धि सर्वक्षेत्रेषु भारत।  
क्षेत्रक्षेत्रज्ञयोर्ज्ञानं यत्तज्ज्ञानं मतं मम॥**

**(3) भगवद्गीता।**

 "This body comprising the external and internal organsis called Kshetra and that which knows or discriminatesthese from itself in the body is called Kshetragna. But inall the bodies or kshetras, I am the Kshetragna commonto all. A clear knowledge of these facts by & philosophicalanalysis is the way to get the real knowledge or gnana."

**शब्दस्पर्शादयो वेद्या वैचित्र्याज्जागरे पृथक्।  
ततो विभक्ता तत्संविदैकरूप्यान्नभिद्यते।  
तथा स्वप्नेऽत्र वेद्यं तु न स्थिरं जागरे स्थिरम्।

मासाब्दयुगकल्पेषु गतागम्येष्वनेकधा।  
नोदेति नास्तमेत्येका संविदेषा स्वयम्प्रभा॥**

**(4) पञ्चदशी।**

 In the waking state we experience varieties of soundtouch &c. Although their experiences vary, the knowledgeof all these experiences is but one. The process is the samein dream, except that the scenes are more transient. Theexperience of ignorance and darkness or complete absenceof feeling in sleep, is remembered after waking. That ignorance, is therefore a fact that is known. In this manner,the knowledge during these three states of life in the courseof a day is uniform. This knowledge is called Samvit,and is ever self-luminous. Months, years and yugas maycome and go, this Samvit remains the same without risingor setting".

 It is difficult to find exact equivalents for these termsin English as the method of classification itself is slightlydifferent from the western one. Budhi may be translatedas the Reasoning faculty and Manas as the thinking faculty.Ahamkara egoism or the idea of the personal self is sometimes added to these two as in quotation No. II, all thethree being generally known as the internal organs orinstruments. There is thus a necessity for a somethingseparate from these three, to use them and to serve as theirsupport. This is known as Kshetragna, or Jiva or lifeprinciple. This might to some extent correspond to theconsciousness or apriori principle of the western philosophers. But both the Kshetragna and Kshetrom are classedunder Prakriti or Maya, as Para and Apara (vido Q. II)The Kshetragas or Jiva is thus capable only of being conscious of what takes place in the sphere of Kshetrom. Itstands as the enjoyer or sufferer as the case may be. It isnot independent but is subject to certain unavoidable lawsenforced. The enactment and enforcement of these lawsbelong to Eswara or lord of all.

**मायां तु प्रकृतिं विद्यान्मायिनं तु महेश्वरम्॥**

 Maheswara rules through Maya and is connectedwith it. As long as this idea of lording over everything ismaintained, Maheswara is not the pure Brahman yet.Beyond even this conception, beyond the atmosphere ofMaya is the Paramatma, the ultimate and only reality.

  Thus we have the Brahman, Eswara, Jiva and theJagath; although virtually there is nothing but the firstBrahman. The remaining three are classified and definedas well as their mutual relations explained, only with theexpress object of removing the mistaken conceptions of theignorant, by progressive method of raciocination. This isthe sum total of the long established theory of Hindu philosophy, as well as Hindu Religion. All further details andvarieties of difference are based on these philosophical conclusions.

 It must however be specially noticed here, that theclassification of various stages from Jagath to Brahman, isnot based upon mere imagination or superstition. The stages are neither mere allegories nor unscientific trifles. In thelanguage of Philosophy and from the stand point of the realGnani and Yogi, they may be boldly proclaimed as false.But for the ordinary mankind, they represent true scientificfacts demanding all possible care and consideration. Untilthe stages are got over by steady and long practice as prescribed, it is useless, nay injurious to slight them in anymanner. The modern tendency of every idle fool to stylehimself a vedanti will only result in additional calamitiesa fit reward for his impertinence.

 In consideration of the main topic in this essay, I fearthe present section is somewhat prolonged, and I shalltherefore close the same by repeating a few selected portionsfrom the passages already quoted above to have a clearidea of the chapter as whole.

**यथाभातस्वरूपेण सत्यत्वेन जगछ्रुतिः।  
अङ्गीकृत्य हितं नॄणां कदाचिद् वक्ति सादरम्।  
अतीव पक्वचित्तस्य चित्तपाकमपेक्ष्य सा।  
सर्वं ब्रह्मेति कल्याणी श्रुतिर्वदति सादरम्॥**

**अध्यारोपापवादाभ्यां निष्प्रपञ्चं प्रपञ्च्यते।  
शिष्याणां बोधसिद्ध्यर्थं तत्त्वज्ञैः कल्पितः क्रमः॥**

 The Sruti takes up the world as appears true to mankind in general and begins to analyse and explain for thebenefit of the unqualified, but to the fully qualified, it givesout the ultimate truth that everything is Brahman. Granting the popular mis-conception for argument's sake, it isafterwards falsified by logical reasoning. This is the procedure adopted by the wise, consisting of Adhyaropa andApavada. This clearly implies that all mistaken theories,in the course of the treatment will be similarly dealt with.Budhism and its congnate theories will find their placesthere, and will receive their due criticisms. They are therefore no original theories promulgated after the Vedas cameinto existence. Subsequent followers of these refuted and prohibited theories stand charged, as it were, as offendersunder the condemning sections of the Vedas. This is animportant fact entirely unnoticed by the Archaeologists ofthe modern day. Further, the preaching of the ultimateconclusion of the Vedas to the unqualified is prohibited asnot only useless but also dangerous, owing to the possibilityof misunderstanding and of consequent mischief.

**आदौ शमदमप्रायैर्गुणैश्शिष्यंविशोधयेत्।  
पश्चात्सर्वमिदं ब्रह्म शुद्धस्त्वमिति बोधयेत्।  
अज्ञस्यार्द्धप्रबुद्धस्य सर्वे ब्रह्मेति यो वदेत्।  
महानरकजालेषु स तेन विनियोजितः।**  
**प्रबुद्धबुद्धेः प्रक्षीणभोगेच्छस्य निराशिषः।  
नास्त्यविद्यामलमिति प्राज्ञस्तूपदिशेत् गुरुः॥**

**महोपनिषत्॥**

 In communicating the ultimate knowledge of Brahmanas making up everything in the world, the student should be first examined as to his having attained the necessaryqualifications by practice of Sama, Dama & c. It is a greatsin to teach the fact to the ignorant or partly qualified.Again,

**तर्हि ब्रूहि स मूढः किं जिज्ञासुर्वा पराङ्मुखः।  
उपास्ति कर्म वा ब्रूयात् विमुखाय यथोचितम्।  
मन्दप्रज्ञन्तु जिज्ञासुं आत्मानन्देन बोधयेत्॥**

**पञ्चदशी॥**

 There are two varieties of fools, one anxious to knowthe real subject and the other indifferent or even perverseto it. To the latter, only some lower form of religious Karmasor worship shall be taught, but to the former the subjectmay be explained through the idea of personal happiness.

 The origin or cause of creation of the world as explainedabove may be noticed here again.

**न स्वभावाज्जगज्जन्मस्थितिध्वंसा मुनीश्वराः।  
न मया केवलेनापि न च केवलकर्मणा।  
प्राणिनां कर्मपाकेन मया च मुनिसत्तमाः।  
जगतः सम्भवो नाशः स्थितिश्च भवति द्विजाः॥**

 The creation, preservation and destruction of Jagat areperformed by Easwara in accordance with the Vasana oreffects of previous karmas of each individual soul. They cannot therefore be attributed to Easwara alone or to karmain itself. A combination of both is required. Next to Jagat,the Jiva and Easwara have to be noticed.

**चैतन्यं यदधिष्ठानं लिङ्गदेहश्च यः पुनः।  
चिच्छाया लिङ्गदेहस्था तत्सङ्गोजीव उच्यते।  
माहेश्वरी तु मायायास्तस्या निर्माणशक्तिवत्।  
विद्यते मोहशक्तिश्च तं जीवं मोहयत्यसौ।  
ईशकार्यं जीवभोग्यं जगद्वाभ्यां समन्वितम्।  
कार्योपाधिरयं जीवः कारणोपाधिरीश्वरः।**

 Jiva or individual soul is a combination of linga orsubtle body, the reflection of Brahman on it, together withthe Brahman as the basis. Easwara is the creator and Jivathe enjoyer. Eswara refers to the idea of cause and Jivato its effect. Easwara acts through Maya which has thepower of creation as well as that of veiling truth from Jiva.Again,

**ईश्वरत्वं च जीवत्वमुपाधिद्वयकल्पितम्।  
चिच्छायावेशतः शक्तिः चेतनेव विभाति सा।

 Brahman itself becomes Easwara in relation to Sakti orMaya and becomes Jiva in relation to the 5 kosas. Whenit is viewed as the basis of the mistaken conception of Jivatogether with the senses etc., it is called Kootastah; whenviewed as the basis of the mistaken conception of the worldas a whole, it is named Brahman in the Vedas. The Srutisimply takes up the Jagat. Jiva and Easwara with the express object of explaining the existence of the unknowablebasis called Brahman. The Sakti referred to as belonging to Brahman is never existent in itself nor is it capable ofdoing anything by itself Brahman is without parts andwithout a second, but it is mistakenly presumed as beingoccupied by Sakti or Maya, and the consequent furtherenquiry as to whether it is fully or partly so combined with it, is answered by Sruti in the same strain of language, with-out directly contradicting the question.

 The above passages clearly point out that the ordinaryideas of Jagat, Jiva and Easwara originate from their mis-taken conceptions called Avidya, Agnana or ignorance, whichis no doubt a particular modification of Budhi or Intellectignana, Vidya or knowledge must therefore be obtained fromthe same source. The quality and quantity of these modifications necessarily vary, as well as their effects. Easwaraand Jiva have been amply defined as the reflection ofBrahman on Maya and Avidya respectively. Maya andAvidya therefore represent the pure and impure states ofthe Intellect. The march onwards therefore from the conditioned Jiva to the Almighty Easwara and thence to the pureunconditioned Brahman has to be conducted through thehelp of this Budhi by improving itself. As long as we donot practically arrive at the correct philosophical conceptionof the material world, we must continue as bound Jivasunder the complete control of Easwara, subject to all thekarmic laws enforced by Him in accordance with our karmasthrough Vasanas or the effects of previous karmas good andbad.**दैवं कर्मफलं प्रोक्तं**(vide Maha-Bharata). Definite procedureis prescribed to improve the Intellect until it becomes Mahator the Great, called the Satwic Maya in which the Satwaguna is predominant over the remaining two gunas or natureof Prakriti which is described as a state in which all thethree gunas are in equipoise. Prakriti thus means theabsence of the work of even Satwa-guna passing beyond theidea of an almighty and allwise Being called Easwara. Thisstate is called Prakriti-laya or merging in Prakriti, thehighest position that could be attained by Karina-Yoga.

 One of the most important points to be noticed herebefore closing this section is the commonest criticism regarding the processes above described as well as their practicalresults. It is generally believed that they add nothing tothe progress of science in the world nor to the real welfareof the public at large. Besides, if everybody becomes a philosopher, the world will not go on, is the ordinary fearof many a worldly-wise man and woman. This fear demandsno serious criticism especially after this lengthy treatmentof the subject that has preceded. This plausible argumentis equally applicable to every worldly and material affair.If everybody turns out a merchant, there would be none tobuy, if everyone becomes a ruler, there would be none to beruled. Such remarks are inadmissible in the treatment ofserious scientific subjects and may be passed over withoutfurther notice. But the question concerning the effects ofthe practices referred to, require to be carefully dealt within this connection. The practice of Yoga described in thepreceding pages are productive of tangible results, not asdirect effects of the processes, nor as the attainments ofobjects aimed at. The main object of course, is the subjugation of the mental distractions and the development of thetrue and latent capacities of the Intellect or Budhi, bywhich alone, Salvation from the miseries of the world isattainable. The tangible effects of the practice of Yoga arethus collateral results which come to a Yogi without aimingat them and without special efforts for the same. They aredescribed as the 8 Sidhis. Some temporary approaches tothem may also be accomplished by other means to someextent, but they would only be of a very inferior quality,being within the province of material science. The realYogi does not and should not care for these developedpowers which follow him naturally in his practice of Yoga.On the contrary he is strictly prohibited from relishingthem or taking advantage of them for worldly purposes,lest he lose steadiness in his practice which solely has thehighest object in view, namely salvation.

 The Linga Puranom already quoted states

**अणिमादिप्रदाः सर्वे सर्वे ज्ञानप्रदायकाः॥**  

 The practice of Yoga leads to true knowledge but alsobestows the 8 kinds of Sidhis. The following passages givedetailed explanation of the matter.

**द्विविधा सिद्धयो लोके कल्पिताकल्पितास्तथा।  
रसौषधिक्रियाजालमन्त्राभ्यासादिसाधनात्।  
सिध्यन्ति सिद्धयो यास्तु कल्पितास्ताः प्रकीर्तिताः।

**विना कार्यं सदा गुप्तं योगसिद्धस्य लक्षणम्।  
यथाकाशं समुद्दिश्य गछद्भिः पथिकैः पथि।  
नानातीर्थानि दृश्यन्ते नानामार्गास्तु सिद्धयः।  
स्वयमेव प्रजायन्ते लाभालाभविवर्जिते।  
योगमार्गे तथैवेदं सिद्धिजालं प्रवर्तते॥**

**योगशिखोपनिषत्॥**

 The Sidhis are obtained by two different processes, oneis artificial and the other is natural. Those originatingthrough the help of medicines, chemicals, physical actionsor even Manthras are called artificial. They are transientand not very effective. Those naturally attained throughYoga, by the grace of the Almighty, are permanent andefficacious. The same Sidhis will occur even without Yoga,if only the old Vasanas are relinquished by long habit.They should be concealed by a Yogi in the interest of hismain object. In flying up above the earth with the objectof soaring high, one is likely to see several holy places and paths below, without any special effort; similarly, in soaringhigh through Yoga different kinds of Sidhis naturally appearto the Yogi.

*** Quotation No I***. In the proper practice of Yogathrough meditation on the 5 elements separately, on themind and on the Intellect as required by the science ofYoga, the Yogi, not only obtains control over them, but isalso accompanied by the respective Sidhis connected withthem. But if he cherishes any desire for these Sidhis, heis sure to be ruined. By utter indifference to them hereaches his ultimate goal.

 The Sidhis are 8 in number. 1, Anima is the power ofbecoming small to a minute atom, 2, Laghima is swiftness, 3, Mahima is greatness; 4, Prapti, the power to obtaineverything, 5, Prakamya is the power of pervading every-where, 6, Easitwom is the majesty of Eewara or Lord; 7,Vasitwom is the power to control and subdue every thing;8, Kamavasayitwom is the power to attain every thingwithout desiring for them. The appearance of these Sidhisare signs of near approach to Salvation.

*** Q. No. II.*** Everything phenominal in the world isthe effect of agnana or ignorance and the complete renunciation of desire for the same leads to Salvation. How couldtherefore a Yogi ever desire for these Sidhis? He will notfeel astonished even if the sun becomes cold and the moonbecomes hot nor if the fire burns down-wards.

*** Q. No. III***. Among the varieties of obstructions enumerated in the sastras against the attainment of Yoga, noneis so dangerous as the desire for the Sidhis. All possiblekinds of sins will result from a longing for them.

 The quotations disclose the possibilities of developingin man the powers detailed above by the processes of Yoga.They are also said to appear in those who relinquish al.worldly desires without any practice of Yoga. Inferior andtranscient varieties of these extraordinary powers are obtain.able to a limited extent by other physical and direct meansfalling within the scope of material science.There areseveral texts specially treating of Yoga and it is beyond thescope of this essay to dilate further on the subject. It may however be noted here that Yoga is not the main object, butis only one of the means adopted to reach the ultimate goal.It no doubt secures certain desired results for progress in this direction, but there are other equally important mattersto be carefully attended to at the same time.

**(2) मुक्तिकोपनिषत्।**

*** Quotation No. I.*** There are two causes for the working of the mind, one is Prana-spanda or life breath and theother Vasana or old associations. The process of breathingstarts up mind and the yogis therefore for the purposeof controlling mind, practise control over breathing, byPranayama, Dhyana and other ingenious methods. Controlling mind by means of controlling breath is however adifficult process, as compared with the method of directlycontrolling the same by gnana. Vasana is the tendencycaused by previous associations without the actual existenceof any extraneous causes at the moment. When this tendency is annihilated, the mind's flow is also virtually stopped.When Vasana is destroyed, the state of Jivan-mukta isattained. Without controlling Vasana, mind cannot becontrolled and vice versa. Without gnana or real knowledge,neither Vasana nor mind can be controlled. Thus the practice of controlling Vasana as well as mind must go hand inhand with the acquirement of real knowledge.When the vasanaic tendency is towards material objects, it is called 'Sanga' or attachment. Its latent state in sleep does notmean its destruction. When it actually loses its tendency,it is called Thurya or highest state of bliss.

*** Q. No. II.*** The practice of controlling mind and Vasanaas well as the acquirement of gnana should be carried onsimultaneously, and they will remove all doubts obstructingthe path to salvation. Any one of them by itself, howeverwell attended to, will not be effective. The false notions ofthe existence of the phenomenal is the result of the associations acquired in hundreds of previous lives. They willnot therefore easily quit without continued strenuous practice of the required remedy. Meditation of the true Brahmandestroys Vasana. By destruction of Vasana, the mind'saction is stopped. Salvation is never attained without thecessation of the work of Vasana and mind. Vasana is thetendency to propel the mind in a particular direction, similar to previous associations, and it subsides after creatingsuch inducement to the mind. Study of philosophy,abandonment of worldly affairs and noting the mortality ofthe physical body will check the force of Vasana. The mind then ceases to work. Until this peace of mind isattained, the ordinances in the Sastras and the instructionsof the Guru or teacher should necessarily be acted out. Bysuch work good Vasanas will result and they should also berelinquished when the real truth is known. Cessation of thework of mind is of two varieties, Saroopa or retaining itsmere form and Aroopa completely formless, the former beingthe state of Jivan-mukta's mind and the latter of Videhamukta. Jivan-mukta's mind will be full of kindness,sympathy & c. He has also acquired the privilege of stopping further births like the Videha-mukta. Thus it is clearthat mind's predomination results in misery and its subsidence produces bliss. It should therefore be somehow subdued, by squiezing hands, or biting teeth or by difficultpostures. By erratic efforts or unsystematic methods, it isimpossible to subdue the mind, like a mad elephant withouta sharp bill hook. Study of philosophy, association with thewise, checking of Vasana, controlling breath and such othersare ingenious processes adopted for the purpose. When suchproper methods are available, it is useless and foolish totake to any other rude procedure. Vasana is of two kinds,pure and impure; the former full of consolidated egoism, islike solidified darkness, leading to misery and endless birthsbut the latter like fried seeds incapable of sprouting destroysthe possibilities of future births and miseries. It is uselessto keep ruminating over various Sastras repeatedly read,without seeking for the light within. Rejecting the seenand the unseen, one who remains steady in the meditation ofBrahman, is the knower of Brahman and Brahman itself.If even after learning all the Vedas and the various Sastras,one does not obtain the knowledge of Brahman, he is likethe ladle unable to relish the sauce in which it lies emersed.

 A psychological distinction is enunciated in the abovequotations, between Vasana and mind or chitta, the formeras the result of previous associations and experiences, andthe latter as a mere blank ready to be acted upon by Vasanaas well as present perceptions. The motion of Prana or lifebreath sets up both Vasana and mind in motion. By controlling respiration. Vasana is checked and vice versa. Bycontrolling mind, Vasana and resparation are checked. Theseare thus mutually acted upon. But the process of checkingVasana and mind by merely controlling breath is somewhatrude and difficult, and could not lead to the ultimate goalwithout Tatwagnana or knowledge of Brahman. Whereas,the method of checking Vasana and mind by gnana andindirectly Prana, is the best and safest way to attainsalvation.

 Some of these important Psychological facts may appearnew and strange to the western scientists and philosophers.But they deserve serious and practical trial, before beingcondemned as autedeluvian, unscientific superstitions. Itmay however be noticed here that the above fundamentalPsychological principles lie at the root of every importantordinance, religious, ethical and social, prescribed and practised in Hindu religion, except perhaps a few insignificantand sometimes absurd customs which have crept in, in courseof time, owing to the complete ignorance of these principles.

 On account of the serious character of these principles,it is not desirable to pass over without giving some detailedexplanation of them as could be gathered from the texts.

 Among the three important factors above dealt with,namely, Vasana-ksheya, Manouasa and gnana, the lastgnana or real philosophical knowledge ranks first, and thissecond chapter has been almost exclusively devoted to thatsubject. The remaining two therefore demand fuller explanation than is already given. Vasana has been defined asthe net result of the previous karms and that it is eitherpure or impure as the case may be. The impure Vasana isof two kinds strong and weak known as Thivra and Manda,the former produces desire, anger, envy, pride & c. and isknown as Asuri as well as Vishaya-vasana; the latter is ofthree kinds, Sastra-Vasana, Loka-Vasana and Deha-Vasana.All these are impure differing only in kind and degree. Thepure variety is known as Dyvee. How the impure Vasanastend to produce misery and repeated births and how the pureones help the onward progress to salvation are explained inthe following quotations. The mind also, irrespective of itsactions in the directions propelled by the Vasanas, has itsnatural tendency to connect itself with the external worldthrough the sensations and with the internal throughthought. How these tendencies will in themselves obstructthe proper path, if left unchecked is also clearly explainedhere.

*** Quotation No. I.*** 'The Vasanas are either good or bad.They are also classified into, Loka-vasana, Sastra-vasanaand Deha-vasana. The good ones ultimately lead to salvation, but the bad ones lead to misery, and should thereforebe turned to good directions by any amount of effort. Thepredominance of good vasanas never causes any harm'.

*** Q. No. II.*** 'Save Atma by Atma itself. It is its ownfriend and enemy. There are three gunas originating fromPrakriti that connect themselves with it, namely, Satwa,Reja and Tama. Satwa is bright and pure, and it leads tobliss and gnana. Reja leads to action, desire and greed.Tama leads to ignorance, sleep and idleness. There are twovarieties of creation, known as Dyva and Asura; the formeris recognised by the tendency to harmlessness, tapas, gnana,peace of mind, kindness and other good qualities leading tosalvation; whereas the latter is known by the tendency toanger, greed, pride, ignorance and other bad qualities leading to bondage'.

*** Q. No. III.*** 'The mind becomes dull and thick byworldly desires and attachments and becomes subject tobondage. When the Vasanas, both internal and externalare relinquished the goal is easily reached'.

*** Q. No. IV.*** 'Mind is at the bottom of all sensations, offaith and faithlessness, strength, fear and cowardice & c. Infact mind is everything'.

*** Q. No. V.*** The duality of ideas created by Jiva is oftwo kinds, the Sastric and the reverse. The former alludesto the spirit of philosophical enquiry, which should also berelinquished after the attainment of knowledge. The latteris divided into two classes, weak and strong. Anger, desire,greed & c. are styled strong, and mere mental distractions areknown as weak. Both of these should be destroyed longbefore true knowledge is obtained. Mental distractionshowever are not to be slighted, as they also produce allpossible evils, by creating desire, anger, ignorance, loss ofmemory & c. They could be destroyed only by the processof Nirvikalpa-Samadhi which should succeed Savikalpa. Itis a mistake to affirm that one who has really attained to theknowledge of self, is permitted to lead any kind of life afterwards with impunity. The main idea inculcated in the text,is the getting rid of all possible means leading to angerdesire & c. and several sensible methods are provided for thesame therein. Without taking to any of these prescribedmethods, if one leads a very despicable life on the ground ofhis being a gnani, there is hardly any difference betweenhim and a dirty dog'.

 It is a bare fact that there are still several importantmatters to be explained in this section devoted to the generaltreatment of Hindu Religion and philosophy. It must alsobe confessed without reserve, that even what little has beenwritten in this essay could certainly have been done muchbetter by abler and more competent hands. But I trust Imay however be kindly permitted to consol myself, that Ihave not as far as I can understand, tampered with the subjects either by misquoting or mistranslating. I have alreadyexpressed plainly in the beginning of this second chapter thatI would entirely refrain from volunteering any opinion of myown accord, without quotations from proper texts. I humblyhope that I have strictly kept on to my pledge in this matter all along, and any misconceptions or misunderstandingsof views that might arise so far, could only be reckoned asdifferences of opinions against the texts themselves, In thenature of things such differences are quite possible and theyhave actually existed from the beginning of time. What theyare and how they occur are clearly foretold and explainedby our omnicient ancient sages. That there is therefore nothing to be surprised in the modern state of affairs could beeasily gathered from the following quotations:

 The points noticed in the above quotations do not directly concern the main subject under reference, but they onlyrefer to the possible, causes of misunderstanding and therefore do not demand complete or literal translations. Thefacts detailed however may appear to some extent as insulting exaggerations, but nevertheless, they are unfortunatelytoo true. The sacred subject dealt with in our religious literature is unlike other scientific matters which require onlya capable intellect to grasp them, but here a good deal ofmental training and other ethical qualifications are neededto appreciate and utilize the valuable instructions conveyed.They are of course not meant for mere fools, and more especially never intended for bad men. Worldly prejudices, personal pride and jealousy, unworthy character and conduct,are particular disqualifications, although they may not be soobjectionable for the study of other sciences. The passagesquoted above point out in detail, the mistaken notions thatinterfere with the correct perception of real truth, The Ragis or those given up to worldly desires, have as a class,their own settled ideas of happiness and misery which obstruct the path to real knowledge.

**रागो यस्यास्ति संसारे स रागीत्युच्यते ध्रुवम्।**

 Then again, intellectual incapacity, intellectual perversity and strong desires in the wrong direction greatly interfere with the possibility of acquiring real knowledge.

**प्रज्ञामान्द्यंकुतर्कश्च विपर्यय दुराग्रहः॥**

 A worldly-wise man destitute of philosophical thoughtis not even reckoned as a born or living human being, in thesacred literature. He is rejected as a useless old donkey.

**स जीवति मनो यस्य मनमेनोपजीवति।  
जातास्त एव जगति जन्तवस्साधु जीविताः।  
ये पुनर्न्नेह जायन्ते शेषा जरठगर्दमाः॥**

 Prevention of future miseries on account of re-births,is the main object aimed at throughout the texts. The general plea for non-perception of truth is a simple display ofidleness and want of thought. It is styled Agnana. Enquiry in the wrong direction is known as Avarana. Identification of Self with the gross and subtle bodies is called Vikshepa. These mistakes always bring on the miseries ofSamsara. They cannot be got over all on a sudden withoutworking gradually against them. The goal will then be reached in course of time, as in agriculture and conception.

**कालेन परिपच्यन्ते कृषिगर्भादयो यथा॥**

 The passages quoted above from the various ancienttexts, unanimously inculcate the necessity of philosophic meditation and religious devotion. Professor Masson thus expresses the same idea with equal force in our own times-'A nation without philosophy has the mark of the beast upon it and is going the way of all brutality." Another serious point noticed in this connection is the evil consequensesof misinterpreting without a knowledge of the subject andactuated by pride and jealousy and more especially throughthe spirit of fault-finding.

**अज्ञात्वा ग्रन्थतत्वानि वादं यः कुरुते नरः।  
लोभाद्वाप्यथवादम्भात् स पापी नरकं व्रजेत्।  
निर्णयं चाऽपि छिद्रात्मा न तद्वक्ष्यति तत्वतः॥**

 It is earnestly hoped that these serious warnings from ourvenerable sages will create a sincere spirit of enquiry in theright direction, and an abundance of useful information maysoon be forthcoming from every competent and sympatheticquarter, instead of unprofitable and quarrelsome attacks oninsignificant personal merits or demerits.

**ओंकारावर्तरम्या यजुरमलजला सामगम्भीरेघोषा

**CHAPTER III.**

**PLACE, TIME AND PERSONALITY.**

 **T**HElast three sections enumerated in the classificationgiven at the beginning of the last chapter are meantto be treated here with a view to furnish the necessary cluesto discover the real significance of Places, Times and Personalities, as found described in the ancient religious literature.That the descriptions do not refer actually to any of themas such, but specify more philosophical and scientific matters,has been already explained in the first chapter itself-callthem mythologies or allegories as you wish, they nevertheless convey definite instructions based upon scientific and philosophical facts. In concretising the abstract ideas for thebenefit of the less qualified, much scientific knowledge hasbeen displayed to make them useful in every way, both forpresent purposes and for future progress. 'शास्त्राय च सुखाय च'is a common saying in the mouth of all the Hindus. Butneither mythologies nor mere allegories can afford to servethese important purposes. These two English words areused by most critics generally conveying an insinuation as tothe absence of usefulness in comparison with the modernscientific discoveries. How far the criticisms are correct, thesubject must speak for itself.

 Another kind of criticism that might come forward, isthrough the Interpolation theory, a weapon that is too oftenused indiscriminately, whenever the interpretations given donot suit the critic's individual taste or whim, or frighten himout of his wits. Quotations from acknowledged texts likethe Sratis, Upanishads, Smritis and Puranas cannot be condenined in this careless fashion without similar authoritativequotations to the contrary and without being able to giveother reasonable explanations to satisfy the enquiring minds.If the possibility of Interpolation is brought in, simply tocriticise the texts themselves as meaningless trash and theirvenerable authors as crazy fools, the unsympathetic interloper is fully welcome. It is certainly be-neath the dignityof a sane man to notice such scurrilous and profitless criticisms.

 Before commencing with the necessary quotations, ithas to be observed that they will not be generally available,exclusively referring to place, time or personality. Veryoften they will be found combined with explanations of anytwo or all the three. It will not therefore be possible tostick exactly to the order in the classification.The necessaryquotations and explanations shall be subjoined, without,however, generally departing from the order specified.

 But another and more serious difficulty that is unavoidable here, cannot be passed over without being specially noticed. The definitions in the passages to be quoted mightoften apply to more than one fact or to the same fact in ahigher or lower sense. I must certainly confess here thatwith my limited knowledge of the subject, it would be hopeless to attempt satisfactory explanations for all of them. Everylearned scholar who is a sympathiser and well-wisher of thissubject, whether native or foreigner is earnestly requested,in behalf of humanity at large, to take up the matter witha loving spirit and furnish further useful instructions. ButI cannot help repeatedly maintaining in this connection,that the current method of interpretation, inevitably leadingto the infamy of our sacred literature is absolutely unauthorised. The mistake, as will be evident from the followingpassages, can be easily discovered to have originated from theignorance of the higher nature of the matters dealt with, aswell as by the unconscious or perverse obstinacy of puttingthe cart before the horse. Apart from the unfortunato mistake that has for some time crept in, neither the preciousliterature nor its venerable authors, are responsible for thepresent deplorable state of affairs. Vanmiki's vivid andtouching description in the Ramayana, of Sita's sad predicament while confined in the Asoka Forest, quoted below, willI trust be an exact and appropriate parallel to the pitiablecondition to which, our ancient religious literature is at present reduced.

**अभूतेनापवादेन कीर्तिं निपतितामिव।

**सुन्दरकाण्डम्॥**

 The above is an exceedingly beautiful and poetical exposition of the sad and pitiable condition of unmerited disrepute in this material world. Our sacred religious literaturehas suffered all its present calumnny for no intrinsic fault ofits own.The indigenous Pandit commenced explaining theunknown subject, with his limited knowledge in the Sanskrit language and without caring to understand its philosophical and religious importance. His smattering knowledgeof Sanskrit in the midst of a large population entirely strangeto the language, emboldened him to offer irrelevant and unreasonable explanations, forgetting his own ignorance in thetechnicalities of the literature and his utter want of religious study and philosophical thought. He was able to continue for a long time in this strain without a protest, whichnaturally confirmed his mistaken opinion as to the absenceof anything more serious in the texts than what he has conceived without a study. The foreign critic who sought information from the Pandit in a mere spirit of curiosity andinterest of novelty, obtained only his views on the subject,without knowing at the same time that the Pandit was asmuch a stranger as himself in the field in question. Withhis better education however, the critic was soon able to perceive the absurdity of the explanations in themselves, andunfortunately commenced his critical operations against theliterature instead of against the Pandit. His mistake is tosome extent excusable, but the actual evil consequences areexactly the same as if he dealt with the subject without afeeling of respect and sympathy and without a sincerespirit of earnest enquiry. The literature as a whole is bythis time somehow surrounded by all the negative and positive evils possible.

**अभूतेनापवादेन कीर्तिं निपतितामिव।  
संस्कारेण विना हीनां वाचमर्थान्तरङ्गताम्।  
स्वगणेन मृगीं हीनां श्वगणेनावृतामिव॥**

**सुन्दरकाण्डम्।**

 **1.** As already arranged in the classification wemay start with the descriptions of places found in the so-called geography in the literature. The names given ofcourse are very often stubbornly identified with knownlocalities and holy centres and more often explained asspots that existed in times of yore, but now submerged,extinct or somehow unknown.

 The Vaidikic objections commonly raised against seeking for their correct meanings or even questioning theirmeaningless interpretations, have been already noticed asalso the supposed dangers of disturbing the current religiousignorance of the subject. It hardly needs the repetition ofthe fact, that complete ignorance and unbecoming arrogancelie at the bottom of these silly objections. The vague andevasive explanations styled occultisms and secret doctrinesare equally irrelevant, especially as the few specific explanations unconsciously given out by the Theosophist can beeasily proved to fall exactly under the category of localmisinterpretations.

 The following quotations refer to our religious geography, if geography it may be called until it is clearlyunderstood.

**भविष्यत्पुराणम्॥**

 Before translating the above passages, I may notice thatmany more explanatory quotations are available touching onthe points here started with, without in the least contradictingeach other. In fact, contradiction is an unknown factor inour religious literature, although that is the only thing thatis seen by our modern jaundiced eyes. To those who arereally interested, I only fear that the quotations are alreadytoo many.

 Two stages of creation or evolution are here detailed,the Sukshma and Sthula (the subtle and the gross). TheLoka-padma or lotus of universe which is said to have sprungfrom the naval of the Almighty, is the subtle one which retains in a latent form, the sum total of all the effects of previous karmas of all creatures in toto. The spherical Bramhanda which is said to have originated from this lotus refersto the sum total of gross creation, virtually the cosmologicalconception of every living being. It will be easy to conceivethat geometrically, the sphere is the exact figure for this representation. If a boundary all round is marked, as far asthe eye or mind could reach in all directions according to thevarying capacities of the individual the resultant figurewould certainly be a sphere for all. The life-giving energyand the glory of the Eternal Bramhan which pervadethroughout this sphere is represented for the purpose of worship, in a human form known as Virat, whose several limbsare specialised sometimes as three and sometimes as fourteenseparate Lokas. More than this introductory remark, it is

×

not necessary here to dilate upon the subject, nor am I sufficiently qualified to explain correctly the different applications of this description of the evolution of the religious universe.

 It may however be easily observed that the subtle evolution and its subsequent gross stage come down only up tothe five gross elements in their totality of existence and intheir infinite form. The modern attempt therefore to identify finite holy localities on the surface of the earth withany of the boundless matters specified above is nothing lessthan a positive mistake.

 **सप्तद्वीपा च मेदिनी**। The earth consisting of seven islandsin regular circles, one within the other, with their separating oceans made up of milk, ghee etc., is probably anotherdescription of gross Bramhanda or sphere. The seven islandsrepresent the seven Prakritis (made up of five elements,Ahamkara or egoism and Budhi or intelligence) without losing their individualities by admixture and being separatedfrom one another by broad oceans intervening. These processes of evolution which originate from the force of Prakriti or maya which is in itself entirely dependent upon theEternal Bramhan, are taken advantage of, to meditate on theglories of the Bramhan indirectly. This is a highly developed form of Bhaktiyoga. The Yogis have their own technical use of them, the Chakras and Adharas in the human body representing the same factors as above described. Theyappear to furnish ample scope for physiological and psychological researches, which might prove profitable even to themodern scientist. At any rate, it is but sheer sin to misunderstand and misinterpret such serious matters, so freely,especially when the concluding inferences end in ignominyand shame to the sacred literature in question.

***Q. No. I.***

 "The eternal lotus representing the Avyakta-Prithivior the unmanifested primary earth, has originated for theuse of Janardhana or Anantha who is the Maha Yogi destitute of mortal or fleshy body. By his yoga and glory hetakes all forms. At the end of a Kalpa or involution, this isexactly the Avyakta-Prithivi that remains. The four facedBramha originated from the lotus, which is therefore described as the original cause for all creation. The water inwhich this lotus sprung up is the body of Vishnu. The realnature of this lotus can be known only from the Sidhas.The central pericarp of this lotus is Meru, where there is aSabha or council-chamber called Manovati, in which Bramhaand Bramha-rishis live in their glorious state. There thegolden Jambu-tree suplies the sweetest juice of its fruits.The region to the south of this tree is therefore known asJambu-Dwipa. This lotus earth is one hundred leksha kotiin extent. All round its pericarp, the Meru. is called Sidhaloka. This is the recognised method of describing this lotusearth in all the Puranas."

 Those who know language, can understand that thePandit and the critic are not Sidhas, that their geographicalearth is not the Avyakta-Prithivi specified here, and that theVaraha-purana containing this sacred passage, is not therefore meant for their foot-ball match. The complete and inexcusable ignorance of the volunteer corps of modern interpreters of this sacred subject is here exposed in the brightestand broadest light possible. Further persistence on theirpart must prove only their arrogance, perversity and culpable antipathy. The council chamber of Bramha named Manovati in the centre of this lotus is sufficiently significant toevery unbiased reader.

***Q. Nos. II & III.***

 "The eternal is Loka and the transient is Aloka. Brightand not bright combined is Lokaloka, which is preceded byAuloka and followed by Niraloka. Auloka is applied toLoka recognised as fit for contemplation. Niraloka is outside it, dark and boundless, unknown even to the Gods anddestitute of transactions. The seven-islanded earth and theseven Lokas, namely, Bhu, Bhuva, Swa, Maha, Jena, Tapaand Satya, are the Lokas inside the Bramhanda. Thereare innumerable Bramhandas, all surrounded by the sevenPrakritis in regular succession, each of the Prakritis beingten times greater than its preceding one."

 The Pandit and the critic cannot pitch upon a singleword here to justify their identification of Loka with geographical earth, on the contrary, all possibilities of such mistaken interpretations are particularly removed. The passages quoted are easily understandable, but it must be confessed that they do not supply understanding with them.

***Q. No. IV.***

 "Fourteen stages are prescribed by the Rishis for theuse of man, in his devotional progress, and they are described as fourteen Lokas, seven of which are known as Kritaor accomplished, beginning with Bhu upwards representingthe pure and unmixed subtle elements, Ahamkara and Mahat. The remaining seven are lower and less important.The ascent to these Lokas is by Yoga, tapas and truth, andthe descent is by their opposites. Bramha's Loka is knownas Satya-loka from which there is no more return."

 The fourteen Lokas are here clearly explained as alluding to fourteen Sthanas or positions assigned for man in hisreligious development. Where is now the Pandit's India in

×

the Puranas, the Critic's Asia Minor and the Theosophist'sTibetan desert? Are they not unnecessarily manufacturing geography to confound the poor religious Hindu andwhat do they virtually gain by this wanton mischief?

***Q. No. V.***

 "The pure subtle clements first originated, which becamegross afterwards only by their admixture. They are distinguished by the number of properties, they possess. Beyond these subtle elements is Auloka. In this Akasa ofAuloka, the subtle elements remain unmixed. Without theseelements, there is no creation or destruction of creatures.As long as they exist there is birth. From Mahat downwards they are original causes and the elements produce effects. The above is the real description of the arrangementof the seven Dwipas with their intervening oceans, theirextents and sites, all approximately explained by the use ofsome small figures. The whole of this description alludes tothe Lord's Prakriti consisting of the seven Bhutas and theirmutual relation in holding each other. I am able to explainthe subject only thus far, but that will suffice for your practical purpose."

 The enumeration of the seven Dwipas and the intervening oceans of milk, ghee, etc., is clearly mentioned here asalluding to the philosophical explanation of the working ofthe seven Prakritis. The approximate details of extent, siteetc., are also stated to have been given with a view to furnish an idea of the unperceivable facts. Where is the difficulty here to understand these plain statements and whereis the reasonable chance for misunderstanding them? Thereal fact is that such passages are never seen or never carefully noticed. The self-constituted interpreters are in suchgreat hurry to enlighten others, that they can ill afford towaste their valuable time for their own understanding.

***Q. No. V1.***

 "From Patala up to Bramha-loka is called Bramhanda.Bhu-loka is above the earth and Bhuva above it.The remaining five are similarly above one another. Above allthese and outside Bramhanda is Vykuntha. Further aboveit is Go.loka of fifty koti yojanas in extent. Of these, Vykuntha and Go-loks are alone real and eternal, the remainingLokas being all artificial."

 There is hardly any scope for misinterpretation here.The Bhu-Loka is clearly stated as lying high above the earth.The geographical earth of the Pandit, critic and Theosophistis thus positively eliminated from the list of Lokas, and thereis therefore no room available for their valuable operations.They may now conveniently retire from the field altogetherand take to more profitable and less injurious work.

***Q. No. V11.***

 "The eternal Avyakta is known to the Rishis as Manasa,to which the birth and death of all creatures are traced.From this Mahan originated known as Akasa. From thisAkasą, the remaining four subtle elements originated. Thedivine lotus was then created, from which Ahamkara knownas Bramha in the form of Vedas originated. All the elements mentioned here are like the Akasa in character, theirindividual differences are known only by the knowledge ofthe Tatwas. Being unperceivable and unreachable, theirmeasurement is impossible. The Agni or fire called Manasaalludes to the Jiva residing in all bodies. The above is theAdhyatmic or philosophical description of the creation workedby Prajapathi."

 What a clear and unambiguous description is here given? The creation reffered to is a philosophical one and notmaterial; and the elements specified are subtle and unperceivable. What has the modern geography of a minute

portion of the crust of the earth todo with this Adhyatmic description of religious philosophy?

***Q. No. VIII.***

 (a) "He who wants to create the Lokas must observewith the Intellect lighted up by the mind. That whichtranscends Mahat and Tamas cannot be Tamas or darkness.It is named Manasa by the wise. It is the formless and thepurest of the pure. This is the characteristic of Yoga, bywhich the Atma within is discovered. The effect always merges in its cause. Birth or evolution is by descent andvariety, and involution or merging is by ascent and unity."

 (b) "Four facts should be known for obtaining theknowledge of Para-Bramhan, namely, Vyakta, Avyakta,Pravrithi and Nivrithi. Pravrithi as instructed by Prajapathi refers to action resulting in succession of births, and Nivrithi as taught by Narayana Rishi refers to the process ofsecuring salvation without rebirth. Jiva is known as thedoer and Kshetragna as the seer of the work of the Prakritis"

 (c) "The Intellect is known by the name of Bramhain Sankhya philosophy and Mahan in Yoga philosophy. Heis of various forms constituting the universe and is expressedby a single letter."

 (d) "I shall tell you the distinction between Vidya andAvidya. Avyakta which evoles and involves is Avidya, andVidya is the twenty-fifth Tatwom which is destitute ofthese. Again, these two terms are also used in explainingthe mutual relation of the Tatwas in the Sankhya philosophy by the venerable Rishis. The twenty-fifth Tatwom isVidya as compared with Avyakta, which in itself is Vidyain its relation to the Intellect. The Intellect is Vidya toAhamkara and so on."

 The above passages furnish clear definitions of important technical terms invariably misunderstood.

 1. Manasa, is beyond Mahat or Intellect and Tamaor Avyakta. It represents the twenty-fifth Tatwom.

 2. The pure Intellect is known as Bramha in theSankhya philosophy and as Mahan in the Yoga philosophy.

 3. Pravrithi evolves and Nivrithi involves.

 4. That which evolves is Avidya and that which involves is Vidya. The highest Vidya is the twenty-fifth Tatwom.

 The Vidya of the modern interpreters is doubtless theireffort to produce confusion and annoyance.

***Q. No. 1X.***

 "Thus the Bramha's day and night are ascertained.According to this calculation, as if he were also mortal, hisage is fixed as extending to only a hundred years. The firsthalf of it is said to be over in which he is known as Sabda-Brahman and the period is called Padma-kalpa. The secondhalf referring to the present time is Varaha-kalpa in whichHari assumed the Varaha or boar form. The two periodsspecified, constitute but a twinkling of the Lord's eyes,figuratively described here. Kala, Karma and Swabhavacombined evolve the Jagat. Kala or time produces the different Gunas. Swabhava or nature produces changes, andKarma gives rise to Mahan. From Mahan, Ahamkaraoriginates, consisting of Vaikarika, Tyjasa and Tamasa, representing Gnana, Kriya and Dravya Saktis. When thesubtle elements, senses and mind remained separate, theywere unable to create. By the force of the Lord they joinedmutually and produced the Anda or egg. After thousandsof years, the Purusha came out breaking this egg from with-in. His limbs are described by the wise as representing thefourteen Lokas. The Bhu as representing his feet, Bhuvahis naval and Swa, his head, is another enumeration of theLokas".

 The above passage clearly confirms the views alreadyexpressed in the preceding quotations. The descriptions inevery Purana only explain the subject in the same strain andnever contradict each other as are ignorantly and unnecessarily criticized.

***Q. No. X.***

 "A Hamsa-Yogi who is an expert in the PranavaManthra is never affected by the effects of his Karmas. Theletter A, represents the right side of the Manthra, U, theleft side, M, the tail and the half Mathra, its head. Dharmaand Adharma are its two eyes. Its limbs are its propertiesrepresented by the 14 Lokas and the whole body constitutesTatwom."

 The Lokas are here explained as representing theproperties of Om or the Pranava-Manthra. Whatever thismay mean to an ordinary lay man, it is certain that theLokas here specified do not in the least refer to the Pandit's,critic's or Theosophist's nativity.

***Q. No. X1.***

 "The seven Dwipas surrounded by the seven oceans ofmilk, ghee &c. as well as the seven Lokas, namely Bhu,Bhuva &c, represent the seven abodes of the gods. Beyondthese, is the mountain called Lokaloka with its three peaksnamed Vyraja, Vykuntha and Kylasa, the abodes of Bramha,Vishnu and Siva. The description of this mountain in aconcrete form must be understood as having a doublemeaning.

 The seven-islanded earth and the Lokas are here clearlystated as alluding to the regions of the gods, and the description of the mountain beyond containing the abodes of Brahma, Vishnu and Siva is required to be understood in a different light. The modern interpreters are no doubt determined

not to understand anything religious and philosophical inthe proper light, but it is a wonder how they could layclaims to the divine regions here enumerated, without proving themselves to be gods. As they believe they are thehighest authorities for the interpretation of our religioustexts, they probably believe they are gods too. It is indeeda pity that these self-made authorities are virtually morenegative than positive in their methods of operation. Theyare unable to offer us any reasonable explanations on difficult points referred to them. They invariably answer usonly by abuses and display of anger. It might be that personally they feel no difficulty with regard to the subject as awhole, and that therefore they readily dispose of ourquestions.

 "The middle of Jambu-Dwipa is Elavrita Khanda, inthe centre of which is Meru 33,000 Yojanas in extent at itstop and 16,000 Yojanas in depth inside the earth".

 Here the Pandit alone is likely to fight for the correctness of the measurements. 16,000 Yojanas here given as thedepth of Meru inside the earth is equal to 12,8000 miles, buthis poor tiny earth has only one sixteenth of this figure forits diameter, which fact he has probably yet to learn. TheMeru is therefo re certainly not a mountain on this earth orthis earth is not the one on which Meru stands. In spite ofthese unavoidable difficulties, the Pandit can well afford to

place the Puranic Meru on his geographical earth.He isable to perform more wonderful feats, if only he could securecompetent audience for appreciation.

***Q. No. II.***

 "To place, the Manasa that became Bramhan, on a seat,the lotus earth is prescribed. Its pericarp extending to theskies is Meru, seated on which Bramha creates the Lokas. "

 The creation of the Lokas theinselves, is here said to beconducted by Bramha, seated on this Meru, The Merusurely is not therefore his creation, nor is it in the Lokas.And yet it is a mountain with which the modern interpreters are very familiar.

***Q. No. III.***

 "The starry regions are one hundred thousand yojanashigher than the Moon, and Meru is two hundred thousandyojanas higher still,"

 Perhaps according to the formula for modern interpretation, the regions above the stars mean Tibet or CentralAsia. The interpretation simply displays impertinence orinsanity.

***Q. No. IV.***

 "The latent subtle condition in which the elements & c.remain after a kalpa or involution is known as the Lord'sMaya. This very thing is called Meru and Deva-Loka."

 It is surely disgraceful to comment further upon themodern interpretations of such passages which clearly definethe technical meanings of terms used in our religiousliterature.

***Q. No. V.***

 "From Vyoma or Akasa, the Vyoma-mahi or Akasicearth originated in which thirty-three Yegna-devas keep

playing. This Akasic-earth is known as Meru and Dharma,Vedas and Devas. It has four peaks consisting of the fourVedas."

 This is a fuller and plainer explanation of the wholematter. It serves also undoubtedly as the final death-blowto all impudent trespassers. The readers are earnestly requested to note and remember this quotation particularly.

***Q. Nos. VI, VII & VIII.***

 "The spinal column made up of twenty-one small bonesis called Meru. It has a hollow passage through its centreextending to the brain called Brahma-nadi and Sushumna.On its either side are Ida and Pingala". This is the Yogicapplication of the terms referring to the location of the sameTatwoms in the human body and does no: practically differfrom the explanations already given. The modern enlightened interpreters need not on any account search for aloop-hole here."

 We understand from the above quotations that Meru isthe centre of the seven-islanded earth, seated on whichBramha or creator of the Universe produces the Lokas andthat Meru refers to the Vedas and Dharmas in general. Itsfour peaks are the four Vedas. It is clear therefore that theseven-islanded earth represents none of the created articleswe can pitch upon. Bramha is thus the purified Intelligenceseated in the midst of the Vedas, creating or exhibiting theLokas or the glories of God that should be seen and experienced before attaining salvation. The evolution andcreation detailed represent the progressive stages throughwhich a knowledge of Saguna-Bramhan or Bramhan combined with pure Maya may be obtained.

 **3.** The seven-islanded earth, with Jambu island inthe centre and Bharata-Uarsha at the southern extremity of

***Quotations No. I, II & III.***

 "Seven Bhumikas are enumerated which are known asGnana-bhumikas or Yoga-bhumikas. Real perception orknowledge is Gnana and it has seven Bhumikas. The firstis called Subhecha, or the earnest desire to get over themiseries of Samsara. The second is Vicharana, or investigation and reflection accompanied by good conduct and annihilation of desires. The third is called Thanu-manasi, wherethe desires for the objects of senses are reduced. The fourthis Satwapathi, or Satwic turn of mind consequent on thepractice in the previous Bhumikas. The fifth is Asamsakti,or natural dislike for desires combined with attachment toSatwic matters. The sixth is Padartha-bhavana; or the conception of the real truth, which is secured by the eliminationof all obstructive items, both external and internal. Theseventh is Turyaga, or the state of remaining in the reacondition of Bramhan, consequent on the absense of all ideasof difference. In the first three Bhumikas, there is in thewaking state, a combined feeling of difference and no difference. In the fourth, the world appears like a dream. Inthe fifth and sixth the Yogi appears like a sleepy man. Inthe seventh, he is entirely absorbed and appears as if completely asleep. In the first three he is known as Mumukshu.In the fourth, he is styled Bramhavit. In the fifth he isBramhavid-vara, in the sixth Bramhavid-variyan and in theseventh Bramhavid-varishta. Enquiry after the Sastrasfrom all quarters available with the object of getting overthe miseries of Samsara, and due respect towards the wise,are the qualifications to secure the first Bhumika. He woh

×

has secured this is called a Bhumikavan. Others who havenot advanced to this stage are called Aryas".

 The term Bhumika here used is sufficiently significant,and the divisions of the Bhumikas explained are exactly thesame in number as in the seven islanded earth. One whodoes not own even the first Bhumika is styled an Arya, orhomeless wanderer. The word Arya as commonly usedtechnically applies to a religious man conducting himselfrespectably in accordance with the Sastras. But even he isnot entitled to a single Bhumika until he qualifies himself asspecified. The religious earths or Bhumikas enumerated inthe texts are not therefore meant for the Aryas, much lessfor the common people. They represent the regions of godsas already noticed, and it is useless, on the part of the moderntype of religious authorities, to covet them with their existing qualifications.

 **4.** The number of passages already quoted, will itis hoped, convince every reasonable and unbiased enquirer,of the general trend of the classifications and descriptionsgiven, in the manner dealt with in the literature. The 14Lokas, the seven-islanded earth and the Meru are entirelydifferent from the idas and opinions now prevailing aboutthem and it makes no difference whether they are meant toestablish their importance in favour of the Hindu Religionor specially meant to annul the same. Although perhaps itis not fully understood as to what the contents of thesepassages exactly apply, it is certain that they do not in theleast corroborate the current interpretations.

 Jambu being the central island within the seven-islanded earth, its geographical descriptions may now be examinedin detail.

***Q. No. I.***

 The Rishis as well as those who know the Puranas saythat the golden lotus-earth of very huge size originated

from Narayana. Bramha, the greatest of Yogis and thecreator of the Lokas, originated from this lotus. Theessence of this lotus is called Deva-prithivi or the divineearth. Its hardest essence is known as constituting divinemountains, namely, Himavat, Meru, Nila, Nishadha, Kylas,Sringavan, Gandhamadans, Trisikhara, Kantha, Mandara,Udara, Pinjara, Vindhya and Astha. These holy mountainsare the regions of the Devas and Sidhas, in the midst ofwhich lies the Jambu-Dwipa. The situation of this Jambu-Dwipa is recognised as being where the acts of man aredevotional in character. The sweet waters oozing out ofthese devotional Karmas are known as the holy rivers. Thefilaments of this lotus are the various mountains. Thepetals at the top represent the regions of Mlechas, those atthe bottom allude to the abodes of Dythias, Asuras andPannagas. The space between the petals is the abode of thesinners, called Asahya. There is another lotus inside thislotus surrounded on all the four sides by the sea. Thus thelotus-earth has originated from the bigger lotus for the sakeof Narayana and therefore known as Pushkara or lotus. Forthese reasons, the Rishis made their enquiries for the earth,mountains and rivers here specified, by taking to devotionaland Vedic processes."

 The above is a pretty exhaustive and clear explanationof the religious earth and its general details, which could bediscovered only by vedic and devotional processes. Thesituation of Jambu. Dwipa is specially noted as where theacts of man are devotional in character.

**जम्बूद्वीपस्य संस्थानं यज्ञिया यत्र वै क्रियाः।**

 What better explanation is possible to be furnished, forthe prevention of misinterpretation, and what better proofis required to show that nothing short of sheer misinterpretation is obtained at present ?

***Q. No. II.***

 "A Jambu tree called Sudersana stands in the middle ofSudersana-Dwips and hence this Dwipa is known also bythe name of the eternal Jambu-Dwipa. The Sudersans.Dwipa appears circular like a wheel, like the reflection ofour face in a mirror."

 We have by this time, more or less understood the gistof the general descriptions of the religious regions.

**अवबोधं विदुर्ज्ञानं तदिदं सप्तभूमिकम्।**

 The seven stages or Buunis clearly allu le to thedegrees of real knowledge to be attained step by step bydevotional processes. It is absurd even to imagine that thevenerable Rishis produced so much of voluminous literaturefor the purpose of describing our poor earthy sphere and thetransactions of its silly and insignificant residents. Fromthe sacred plains of their clear intellect, the worldly peoplecannot but appear as stupid, sleepy or intoxicated beingsteeped in Agnana.

**अद्वितीय ब्रह्मतत्वं न जानन्ति यदा तदा।  
भ्रान्ता एवाखिलास्तेषां क्व मुक्तिः क्वेह वा सुखम्॥**

 The literary productions of our Rishis therefore do nottreat of the regions of the ignorant. A description of theGnana-Bhumis is the only natural and useful instruction tobe expected or obtained from them. If we do not lose sightof this important fact, we can easily understand the meanings of their narrations in the Puranic form. The vexedJambu Dwipa is also said to be known as Sudersana-Dwipa,and the word Sudersana plainly means 'worthy sight'. Thevenerable Rishis will not stoop to describe 'unworthy sights',under which the whole of the cosmology of the worldlyise man inevitably falls. The Dwipa under reference is.

the devotional sphere which is mentioned as capable of beingseen only like a reflection in the mirror. The perception ofthe geographical divisions of our mother earth, has certainlyno such restrictions or limitations, and it does not stand inneed of the Pandit's or Critic's help.

***Q. No. III.***

 "Creation itself is of two kinds, the Dyva and theAsura, the former being that which is accompanied by devotion to Hari, and the latter without it. The seven Dwipasnamely, Jambu, Plaksha, Salmala, Kusa, Krouncha, Sakaand Pushkara are Devabhumis or devine earths, belongingto the Dyva creation."

 The distinction here pointed out settles the whole question. The word Asura is here used, in its ordinary technicalsense. Asu is life and ra is addicted to, referring thereby tothis material world with all its paraphernalia of humanvanities and miseries. It is therefore evident that the religious texts have left it out of consideration altogether. Theworldly-wise Pandit, the modern enlightened historian andarchæologist as well as the mistaken Theosophist, may nowvery well retire from this field, without discredit to theirprofessions and without any loss to the general public.

***Q. No. IV.***

 "The Karma-bhumi refers to the cow known as theVedas. He who rules over it is called a Gopa. This specified Bhumi, no doubt is ever eternal. The Meru, the Dwipasand the Khandas such as Elavrita &c. have in reality noseparate existence".

 The Go or cow, the Karma-bhumi or region of actionand the Vedas are thus synonymous terms used in our religious literature with their specific applications. Withoutunderstanding these simple technicalities of the subject, what

×

a funny state of affairs now prevails in the identification ofthe Vedas practically with the geographical earth! ThePandit further believes that this earthy globe is also literallya beautiful cow of the Nellore or Bombay breed. Withthese egregious mistakes for the foundation caused by unalloyed ignorance, ingenious interpretations of the sacredtexts are now-a-days offered from all quarters of the globefor the religious benefit of the indifferent and lazy Hindu,who there by feels exceptionally lucky, as he seldom thinksof finding out anything for himself in this matter. The fallof the modern Hindu having been from a great height, consciously or otherwise, it must certainly have injured himvery seriously. The deterioration is however a real fact,whatever might be the causes attributed. There are differentvarieties of this fallen class among us, some of which maybe styled the orthodox and others the heterodox or moreplainly heretical. The former varieties ordinarily fall underthe uneducated classes and are invariably found to be farinferior even to our veritable pandits. The latter varietiesmake up the majority and include a great portion of themodern educated gentlemen, as well as the indifferent, lowand wicked among the uneducated. The chief object of thisessay is only to appeal to the educated, and the remainingclasses may be conveniently omitted for the present. It isindeed a pity that the majority of this educated class couldbe practically identified with the foreign critic, minus ofcourse, his laudable spirit of enquiry. False, apish andmeaningless imitation is doubtless the ruling fashion of theday with its disgraceful and dangerous consequence of de-nationalisation. Civilization, education or progress, as understood in modern or ancient times, never demands this pernicious tendency. Its dangers are immensely augmented bythe special fact that everything prescribed for a Hindu is

based upon well established fundamental principles of religion, which he has now long forgotten. The possibility ofrediscovering these valuable principles, now or hereafter, fromthese externalforms, is virtually being destroyed by thecurrent mania for foreign imitation. It is humbly hopedthat this will not be misunderstood as preaching superstitionor obstructing progress. Unsuited, unnecessary and extremely inartistic imitations, positive vices, obstinate andignorant indifference to one's own religion, hardly add toprogress of any known description. The attempt of theeducated gentleman, to conceal his wanton mistake or toexcuse himself on the ground of enlightenment, is as futileas that of the orthodox and the Pandit, and his educationonly holds him all the more responsible. As long as humanreason ordinarily continues to command its due respect, nofalse conduct on the plea of civilization could pass off for atrue coin in any part of the civilized world.

 **5.** It is confidently hoped that the passages quotedall along with regard to the 14 Lokas, the seven islandedearth, the Meru and the Jambu, will be understood as explaining religious matters clearly and unambiguously in thestrongest and plainest terms the Sanskrit language is capableof expressing. The current ideas about them as representingmaterial or physical entities like geographical continentsand mountains are entirely irrelevant. Although it is noteasy to understand them fully, with our very limited knowledge of the subject at present, yet the general classificationsand descriptions are sufficiently comprehensible. The termspoint to some divine matters to be experienced in the progressive advancement of yogic and devotional practicesw

There will no doubt be a good deal of Psychological andphysiological principles underlying them, and the whole of itis some serious science and sacred religion, which could notbe played with in the present fashion. It will be more safeand honourable to leave it alone, if no interest is forthcomingor no knowledge is procurable. It makes no differenee withwhat motive it is misinterpreted. In any case, the process isa mistake and the consequent result is unwholesome in everyway. The terms under reference belong to the Sanskritlanguage, and it would be sheer weakness of the brain toexpect to find their meanings in the dictionaries of alienlanguages. Equally so, is to hope for their explanationsfromforeign creeds like Theosophy preached in the land,especially when they fetch no appreciation in their owncountries. The simple mistake lying at the root of all thisconfusion is in having unnecessarily picked up some religiousterms from the sacred texts, without looking backwards andforwards, a single inch beyond. Opinions are easily andimmediately formed, commentaries and criticisms followedin quick succession, and all possible perversities are inventedto establish the mistaken ideas promulgated. In the longrun, as irɔny of fate would have it, the mistaken explanations given by these self-constituted interpreters, graduallyled to the present indifference and contempt for the subjecton the whole, being virtually reckoned as old-world superstitions and worthless compilations.

 The central island Jambu-Dwipa is described as dividedinto 9 Varshas or continents, the Bharata-Varsha being thesouthernmost one which is now understood as representingIndia. It is this vexed Bharata-Varsha that is at the bottomof all the existing geographical confusion. Detail descriptions of these Varshas are found in most of the Puranas, butnothing more than bare outlines and faint suggestions can

be attempted here. Those who desire to take deeper interestin the matter may apply directly to the texts themselves.But it may be noted here that Bharata-Varsha is to someextent distinctly different in character from the remaining8 Varshas said to be contained in the Jambu-Dwipa. Thefollowing quotations will, it is hoped furnish the requiredexplanations and clues for the correct understanding of thesubject.

***Quotation. No. I.***

 "In the midst of which is Ilavrita with its centreMeru. To the north of Ilavrita are, Ramyaka, Hiranmayaand Kuru Varshas or continents with their respectivemountains, Nila, Sweta, and Sringavan extending to thesaline ocean. To the south are, Hari, Kimpurusha andBharata Varshas, with their mountains Nishadha, Hemakutaand Himalaya, all ten thousand Yojanas in height. To theeast and west of Ilavrita are Ketumal and Bhadraswa. Onthe four sides of Meru are four mountains, Mandara, Meru-mandara, Suparswa and Kumuda. In these there are fourtrees, Chuta, Jambu, Kadamba and Nyegrodha, each onethousand Yojanas in height. There are four ponds filled withmilk. honey, sugarcane juice and water respectively, themere touch of these gives the glorious powers of Yoga.There are also four divine gardens, Nandana, ChithrarathaVybhrajaka and Sarvathobhadra.

 Among the nine Varshas, Bharata is Karmakshetra orregion of action. The remaining eight Varshas are theregions of the heavenly beings for the enjoyment of theeffects of the good Karmas performed. The residents ofthese eight Varshas live happily for ten thousand years withtheir wives who beget but one child each at the end. In allthese nine Varshas, Narayana is ever present with hiscollection of Atma-tatwas for bestowing blessings upon theirresidents".

 We have here a detail description of the ever confounded Bharata-varsha. It is one of the nine Varshas in Jambu-Dwipa and is specially known as the region of action. Theremaining eight Varshas are said to be regions of enjoyment.We have already seen that Jambu-Dwipa is a name given tothe devotional sphere. Its nine divisions cannot thereforerefer to anything different from the same. Never mind.What does the Pandit or the critic want to establish withregard to the Bharata-varsha here? If they identify it withIndia, they must be prepared to take the natural consequences. The remaining eight Varshas must then represent theremaining lands on the surface of the earth. Taking theirgeography as given here, where is the Meru in the centre,where are the four mountains round Meru, where the four.trees of one thousand Yojanas in height, the four pondsfilled with milk, honey &c. and where the four celebratedgardens? All these are perhaps myths except Bnarata-varsha. How? Because the critic affirms and the Panditblinks. Where are again the remaining eight Varshas.whose inhabitants continue to live for ten thousand yearsand leave a single child at the end of their term ? This isperhaps mere exaggeration. How is Bharata-varsha theregion of action and how the remaining Varshas places ofenjoyment? This is also perhaps simple nonsense. Is there

any sense after all anywhere in the lengthy descriptionabove given? Have the Pandit and critic reflected uponthe amount of sense they have displayed in having misunderstood divine matters as earthly? Probably they are acquainted with the science of converting heaven into earth,but not vice versa. Let them be assured once for all thatthe regions dealt with here are too far from their reach andthat no amunt of fighting in their unreasonable style couldsecure for them an inch of that sacred ground.

**विषयासक्तचित्तानां ज्ञानं मोक्षं च दूरतः॥**

***Q. No. II.***

 "Men and women residing in Bharata-varsha are ofdifferent colours and they worship different gods. Theirlongivity extends only to one hundred years. This Bharatavarsha is nine thousand yojanas in extent. It is the regionof action for the duly qualified. There are four Yugas inthis Bharata-varsha, namely, Krita, Treta, Dwapara andKali, which are not found elsewhere. In the remainingeight varshas, all are youthful and happy, there is no hunger,no grief, no weakness".

 This quotation does not in any way contradict the previous one.If the Pandit still wishes to stick on to his interpretation of Bharata-varsha as applying to India, he willfind that he is the most unfortunate and short lived beingin human creation, as all the people outside Bharata-varshaare said to live happy for a long period of ten thousandyears, without hunger, without grief. His boasted Punnya-bhumi or holy land is alone the most wretched spot, asevery inch of ground outside its boundary on the surface ofthe earth is extremely blessed. Further, his poor Bharata-varsha is subject to the rigour of the four Yugas. Time isfree everywhere else without being limited by the Yugas.

These are doubtless the absurd conclusions to which hisinterpretation inevitably leads, without an atom of useful orsensible meaning, and yet it is almost impossible to convince the Pandit of his mistaken and suicidal obstinacy.

***Q. No. III.***

 "The Bharata-varsha lies to the north of the salineocean and to the south of the Himavat. It is the regionwhere all acts produce their good and bad effects which haveto be enjoyed elsewhere. The Devas even to this day wishto be born in this Bharata-bhumi".

 Here the northern and southern boundaries alone ofBharata-varsha are given. The saline ocean to the south isnot specified by any name. The Pandit may perhaps comeforward here with his perverse ingenuity. Has he anythingto say as to why the effects of acts performed in Bharata-varsha should be enjoyed elsewhere, and why should theDevas who are already in heaven desire to be born here?The saline ocean and the Himavat will be subsequently explained. The Devas here refer to the senses of man in theirpure Satwic nature. They can enjoy divine bliss only bydevotional acts. The worldy transactions procure themonly miseries in the long run.

**न जातु कामः कामानामुपभोगेन शाम्यति।  
हविषा कृष्णवर्त्मेव भूय एवाभिवर्धते॥**

 What a serious philosophical fact is here explained inthe Puranic style and what a silly and shameless explanationis presumptuously volunteered by the Pandit?

***Quotations No. IV, V, VI & VII.***

 "Bharata is the son of Rishabha by Meru Devi. Heruled over Mahat-Bharata-Varsha to the south of the Himavat and Bharata-varsha took its name from him. His son

×

is named Sumati. Vydyuta, lightning or electricity knownas Lowkik fire is the first son of Bramha. His son is Bramhodana-agni known as Bharata from whom Bharata-varshatook its name. Bharata is the son of Dushyanta bySakuntala from whom Bharata-varsha took its name".

 We have here three different origins of Bharata fromwhom Bharata-varsha took its name. Probably the Pandit,critic and Theosophist have never heard two of these, althoughthe quotations are from recognised Puranas. In QuotationVI Bharata is plainly said to be the son of lightning orelectricity. How can these self-imposed interpreters hopeto understand the highly philosophical and scientific religionwithout its study, and still worse to explain the same withthe preposterous idea that it is human history? The termsRishabha and Meru Devi, Bharata and Sumati, Dushyanthaand Sakuntala, Vydyuta and Bramhodana-agni are alltechnically significant. The Agni here specified can beclearly understood only by knowing the formulas underlyingthe various religious Agni-hotras prescribed by the Vedas.The Theosophist however might anxiously pounce upon thisVydyuta or electricity with his occultism, but unfortunatelyit is now too late. He has long joined the Pandit in hisidentification of Bharata-varsha with India, and the Panditcertainly has no electricity to lend him. If he could condescend to read patiently the subsequent pages of this essay,he would he plainly informed that our religious texts do notdeal with his electricities produced by Hobgoblins and narcotics.

***Q. No. VIII.***

 "Bharata refers to the governing of the subjects according to its root meaning. It is the middle and only regionof action, lying between the ocean and the Himavat. It isthe region of human action prescribed for the attainment of

heaven and emancipation. This Bharata-varsha is dividedinto nine islands surrounded by the sea and inaccessiblefrom one to the other. The nineth island is horizonital inlength. He who conquers it is called a Samraud; and thisLoka itself is known as Samraud, the firmament is Viratand above it is Swaraut". There is plenty of funny geography here for thePandit and critic to ponder on. TheirIndia is cut up into nine inaccessible islands. Perhaps thesea has since receded in some century A. D. although noGeology has yet established the fact. Anyhow Bharata-varsha is particularly marked as the region of human actionleading to heaven and salvation.

**इह स्वर्गापवर्गार्थंप्रवृत्तिर्येषु मानुषी।**

 It would nevertheless be quixotic to plead that all themodern transactions in India lead to heaven. Further, hewho conquers this island becomes a Samraud, above him isVirat, higher still is Swaraut. Can we hope for any sortof enlightenment on these points from our learned interpreters, excepting humbug and abuse? Have they any ideaof the significance of the terms Samraud, Virat and Swarat? It may not be entirely profitless in this connection toexamine the import of these technical terms, as far as couldbe gathered from the religious literature.

 शिवो हि पञ्चीकृतभूतकार्यसमष्टिरूपस्थूलशरीरमभिमन्यमानो विराट्॥तद्व्यापकं अपञ्चीकृतभूतकार्यसमष्टिरूपं सप्तदशकं लिङ्गशरीरमभिमन्यमानःस्वराट्॥ उभयकारणमव्याकृतमभिमन्यमानः सम्राट्॥

 "The Easwara viewed as the basis of the totality of theeffects of gross creation, is known as Virat; considered as thebasis of the Linga-body made up of the seventeen tatwas,the total effects of subtle creation, He is Swaraut; viewedagain as the basis of Avyakrita which is the cause of boththe above creation, is Samraud".

 We have here obtained fully scientific explanations ofthe technical terms used. The Pandit I fear will still attempt in his usual shameless mood to explain Samraud asreferring to the status of an Emperor who conquers one ofthe nine islands into which India is geographically dividedeven at present. Comments on such persistence would betiresome indeed !!.

***Q. No. IX.***

 "O, king, the Bharata-khanda originally took its namefrom Bharata, son of Rishabha. You must understand thatwhat is made of clay will at last be reduced to clay. Therefore, what is gained by karmas performed with transient materials, such as Kusa grass, ghee &c, can only be impermanent. The wise people consequently look for eternaleffects, which in my opinion could be produced only byDhyana or meditation of the Atman".

 In the above passage, Bharata and Bharata-khandacertainly allude to the devotional karmas as a whole, amongwhich the eternal effects of Dhyana are specially extolled.The name Rishabha constantly mentioned as referring to thefather of Bharata, signifies Dharma usually described as abull in the Puranas. Bharata alluding to the devotionalkarmas must therefore originate from or depend uponDharma. All acts which do not fall within the province ofDharma will not therefore be admitted in Bharata-varsha.

 These are the plain facts clearly expressed in the ancientliterature. To the peculiarly developed intellect of themodern day in India, the whole of this however appearsmythic, superstitious and unreasonable. Where are we toseek for the origin of this local tendency for such recklesscriticisms? It would indeed be gross ingratitude to attribute it to the influence of western civilization in India.

×

Earnest enquiry combined with deep and thorough studyalways precedes criticisms upon serious subjects in all partsof the civilized world. It has doubtless become a rare exception in India at present. This is certainly one of themost glaring instances of disgraceful and purely apish imitation complained about in this essay.

 **6.** From the above passages, it may be safelyunderstood that Bharata varsha clearly refers to the variouskarmas prescribed by the Vedas, differing in quality andnature so as to suit the capacities and qualifications of thepersons concerned. Variations in the origins of Bharatafrom whom Bharata-varsha is said to have taken its name,point to the differences in the karmas themselves. Similarlythe differences in the times during which the Bharatas aresaid to have ruled refer to the same thing.

** भुवं भारात्तारयतीति भरतः** (vide पद्मपुराणम्.) 'One whosaves himself from perdition by good acts'. भारत signifiesan actor even in the ordinary Dictionary meaning. Theremaining 8 Varshas in the Jambu-Dwipa represent the अष्टैश्वर्यor 8 Sidhis, the acquisition of extraordinary powersalready described in the preceding pages.

 Himalaya the northern boundary of Bharata-varashaprobably represents misty region within which Karmasreside. Beyond Karmas is Gnana on the other side, passingover the Himalayas.

 The saline ocean forming the southern boundary ofBharata-varsha and lying round the whole of Jambu-Dwiparepresents the ocean of worldly miseries.

***Quotations. No. I& II.***

 “The lotus-earth with its eight Dic-palas originatedfrom the ocean of Samsara. The ocean in the Jagat described, is the ocean of worldly miseries".

 Ideas cannot be clearer and language cannot be plainer,but it is beneath the dignity of the indigenous Pandit tocare for either. He is ever far above the plains of truthand human reason. His ignorance of ordinary geography isan additional misfortune to the religious literature whichhas fallen within his clutches.

***Q. No. III.***

 The poetical description of the analogical details of theocean of Samsara in this quotation is worth reading in theoriginal. A few of the apt analogies given may be noticed.The ocean of grief: The saline waters of tears: The depth

of Karma: The mire of desire: The aquatic animals consisting of ignorance, disease, fear, sorrow &c. This oceancontains an island to be reached by Vedanta on its bank ofAhimsa and truth. The Rishis and Sidhas cross this oceanby the boat of Gnana and reach the pure Akasa. The objectof such descriptions and their significance are easily understood by all mankind excepting perhaps our learned Pandit.The ideas conveyed refer to no strange matters exclusivelyfound in the Sanskrit language.

***Q. No. IV.***

 Samsara is here described as a wild forest instead of thedeep ocean. "The worldly man enters this thick forest, onaccount of his desires to procure wealth, and falls headlonginto a well overgrown with shrubs. He sticks on in thatpainful position to a branch of the Jambu-tree grown inside.He keeps on eating day after day, the fruits of the tree andnever gets satiated. Here the Jambu-tree described is mortality and its fruits are the effects of Karmas performed by man".

 From the above quotations we can more or less understand the ideas conveyed by the oceans, forests and Jambu-trees ordinarily introduced in religious literature.

 The saline ocean above described aptly refers to theamount of misery and grief man is subject to in worldlyaffairs. The Jambu-tree represents mortality and its attractive fruits and beautiful creepers entwining it are described as the allurements in this transcient existence. Although the eight Sidhis appear magnificent in comparisonwith the enjoyments of ordinary man, still they fall withinthe bounds of mortality, the desire for them as such leadingonly to re-births and consequent miseries.

 We can now clearly understand that Jambu-Dwipa is ageneral term for devotional sphere lying within the privi-

leges of mortal man and that Bharata-varsha specifies theprocesses and scope of devotional Karmas. The remainingeight Varshas of the Jambu-Dwipa represent the blissfuleffects of such good acts, before they fully qualify for finalemancipation. The tangible effects of devotional acts andthe different varieties of status attained by their means aredefinitely established in our ancient religion. Every item ofdescription given is a specific valuable instruction, which ifcorrectly understood and properly acted out, undoubtedlysecures the serious and beneficial results detailed. Call it ascience if you please, but it is a religious science far superiorto the sciences dealing with dead matter. It matters littlewhether the Pandit misinterprets the whole subject as hisvillage geography or the critic stigmatises everything byopprobrious epithets. It makes no difference either, even ifno body believes in it or takes to its practice.

**सानुतिष्ठति कोऽप्येतत् इति चेन्मानुतिष्ठतु।  
पुरुषस्यापराधेनकिमुपास्तिः प्रदुष्यति॥**

 **7.**In the apparent geography hitherto examiner,the object of Upasana or worship of God and of His Gloriesin some specific form is described, and also its necessity; itbeing the only means of preparing oneself to be qualified forthe attainment of true knowledge. The various stages inthe philosophical analysis of divine creation are taken intoaccount for this purpose and several methods suitable to thecapacities of the individual are prescribed, with a view to getover the mania for worldly enjoyments. Man's incapacityto soar high all at once, is an admitted and undisputed factin every religion. He is generally well-known as a Samsari,a sinner or a fallen man. The sphere of Karma or action insome form, high or low, is therefore his natural atmosphere.His actions directed towards God become religious and thosetowards worldly enjoyments especially by objectionable pro-

cesses become irreligious and immoral. By Upasana orworship of God's glories, man in course of time learns andfeels the insignificance of his own little personality with itslimited desires extending within its trifle existence, and ultimately qualifies himself for the attainment of the highestbliss. The following quotations will doubtless bear testimony to the above facts.

***Quotation. No. I.***

 "None can afford to remain a single second without doing something. He is ever compelled by the force ofnature".

 The idea of action here includes everything done bymind and word also. This is an important maxim in ourreligious psychology which is invariably overlooked. Thefalse and presumptuous Vedantism of the stupid, immoralaud wicked, exhibits the total ignorance of this fundamentalprinciple. We have already noticed in the last Chapterthat for a successful march in the right path, there must bethe combined practice of Mano-nasa, Vasana-kshaya andVignana It requires no spectacles to see that the currentVedantism is entirely free from the items specified but thatit is often combined with strictly prohibited ones. The sheerignorance of the necessity of these items, emboldens thehypocrite to preach his so-called Vedantism and lead an ignominious life with ipmunity; and the very same ignorance onthe part of the Hindu public becomes the source, of toleration for the existence of such miscreants and even of theirveneration at times.

***Q. No. II.***

 "The Apara or secondary form of Mukti which leads tothe ultimate emancipation is obtained by Karma or actiononly. It is external by acts of word or deed and internalby meditation of Brahman as constituting everything.There is no doubt that Gnana as opposed to Karma is virtually the highest form of worship, but it cannot suit thegenerality of mankind who are sinners. All forms of worship prescribed in the Vedas and Tantras as well as thosepractised by Budhists, Jains or others, with devotional spirit,

are all beneficial to mankind and are recognised as fallingunder religious Karmas”.

 What a cosmopolitan view is here proclaimed in ourreligion, and why does any critic venture to cry it down assectarian? When a scientific necessity for worship in someform is clearly established in these passages, why is it criticised as superstitious? The critic is probably ashamed toconfess that he is a sinner as pointed out here. No one,however, dares to question his real merits, but let him satisfyhis own conscience first on this point, before he attempts tocondemn or ignore the rigorous religious maxim here enunciated.

***Q. No. III.***

 "The different Karmas leading to heaven and otherblissful states which are comparatively insignificant andtransient, are prescribed by the wise, in consideration of thedefective qualifications of mankind for the highest goal.The devotional processes are therefore divided into Karmaand Gnana dealing with the Atman as Murthis or forms andas Sabda-bramhan, for the benefit of mankind".

 The cogent reason for the secondary step adopted ishere clearly explained. The venerable Rishis are not therefore ignorant of the higher philosophical stage, nor are theyunaware of the limited qualifications of the masses. Theyknew very well the capacities of the Pandit and the critic,but only they are not known correctly by our modernauthorities.

***Q. No. IV.***

 "There are two varieties of the Lord's glory, the Bhogaand the Lila. The former is eternal and refers to the Nirguna and the three-quarter lying above the latter, which is

the remaining quarter, referring to the existing universe,treated as ephemeral in philosophy and as originating fromPrakriti. When this Lila or display of Prakriti is annihilated, the Bhoga is attained. The boundary between thesetwo regions is the Viraja river whose waters are producedby the sweat of knowledge and devotion. Beyond thisriver lies the Para-vyoma or three-quarter glory known bythe synonyms, Akshara, Parama, Dhama, Vykuntha, Saswataand Pada. Between this region and the river is calledKevals, the special region intended for those meditatingupon Avyakta-Bramhan or Bramhan in the form of infinity.In the middle of this region is the divine town calledAyodhya known as Yoga-pittha and made up of all theholy letters. In the centre of this there is a lotus of eightpetals,. the pericarp of which is Savithri in which Easwararesides with his Saktis, namely, Vimalotkarshini, Gnana,Kriya, Yoga, Prahwi, Satya and Esana. The Lokas, thevarious surrounding enclosures and the equipages in theregion of higher glory are detailed below. The eight cardinal points beginning with the East respectively contains Vaikuntha, the region of Vasudeva, then that of Lekshmi, Sankarshana, Saraswati, Pradyumna, Reti, Anirudha and Santi.This completes the first enclosure. The second enclosurecontains the lokas of Prahlada and other great devotees, thethird, those of Matsya, Kurma &c., the fourth those ofSatya, Achuta, Ananta, Durga, Vishwaksena, Ganesa, andcontains also the valuable mines known as Sankha, Padma& c. The fifth consists of the lokas of the Vedas, Savithri,Geruda, Dharma and Makha. The sixth refers to the lokasof the weapons such as chakra, sword & c. The seventh isthe region of the eight Dik-palas, Sadhyas, Maruths, Viswedevas and other Devas. The Devas in the heaven of Prakriti are not similarly eternal. The incarnations of the Lord,

×

such as Matsya, Kurma etc, are the forms of His gloriesprescribe for religious worship."

 We have here a general geography in detail. TheLord's glory is divided into two parts, one quarter below,subject to the laws of Prakriti and three quarters abovebeyond the reach of Prakriti. The boundary river separatingthe two regions is called Viraja on the other bank of whichis the town of Ayodhya. Is the Pandit here going to identify this river with the modern Sarayu in Upper India ? TheViraja however is the boundary between ephemeral andeternal existence and its waters are made up of the sweat ofdevotional emotions. The word Viraja clearly denotesSatwa, beyond Rejas and Tamas. Who compells any Panditto talk nonsense if he does not know the subject? If hedoes not create unnecessary confusion, others have bettercommon sense to find out the correct application of thesedescriptions without much difficulty. It is clearly explainedin the texts themselves, and none need fear the existence ofany occultisms placed around it. The remaini g details ofgeography given are clearly mentioned as prescribed forreligious worship. The proper scientific reasons assigned forthem could be discovered by a study of the subject as in allother worldly matters, but never by a contemptuous rejection of the subject altogether. Its importance is not a whit diminished by such irreligious vandalism, and the modernpreponderance of the materialistic tendency at the verybottom has alone to be pitied. The most useful and valuablestudy long provided for the real benefit of man is being nowneglected not only by sheer ignorance, but curiously enough,on the pretext of having discovered its worthlessness by theforce of modern civilization. It is verily one of the greatestwonders of this lucky twentieth century, if all our religiousliterature has become so transparent that modern civilization

can see through it all its serious defects, even without aglance of the same.

***Q. No. V***

 "The Atma divided itself into four parts, three partsof which reinained in the Paramom-vyoma or pure Akasa.The remaining quarter known as Anirudha originatedPrakriti for the purpose of creating the Jagat. This description of creation must be understood as explaining the wayfor emancipation by the union of Jivatma and Paramatma.In whatever form the Bramhan is worshipped, the devoteeattains that form, therefore Bramhan should be worshippedas the Purusha by meditating that the self is Bramhan".

 The creation here specified is required to be understoodas Srishti-yegna, or a process of worship for the attainmentof Salvation. Could the Pandit, critic or Theosophist pointout a single word here which refers to their India, Tibet orthe submerged islands of the Atlantic ocean? The originaltext wants us to understand the description as an Yegna orworship and the modern interpreters insist on overruling theauthors themselves by explaining it as their earthly geography. This is indeed a novel and funny method of writingcommentaries on a subject. The enlightened interepreterscould more wisely have taken to the production of valuableoriginal texts themselves, without losing their self-respectby such demeaning task. They would have been veneratedas the modern Rishis of the twentieth century far wiser thanthe useless fossils of the time-barred old world. They mighthowever have to retire to the forest before they can think ofsuch a work, and the idea of leaving this happy and progressing material world is certainly opposed to modern taste andfashion. The best method of evading all these unnecessary

difficulties is by bidding farewell to this troublesome literature under reference. By so doing, they would of course beconferring a great boon on the poor religious Hindu. Thesubject on the whole is not to their temperament or taste andtheir present interference is only a frightful assistance.

**असतां धर्मबुद्धिश्चेत्सतां सन्तापकारणम्॥**

***Q. No. VI.***

 "In the Puranas, the five subtle elements are describedin their separate individual states. The last element, theearth is said to be only one-tenth in extent as compared withwater. Fire is ten times greater than water, but is only one-tenth of air. The Akasa is ten times greater than air. Thesubtle element earth is ten times greater than the Bramhandawithin it which contains the 14 Lokas. Akasa, the greatestelement is itself nonexistent, as the eternal substance orBramhan can have no Akasa, hole or vacuum. Withoutphilosophical enquiry, this Akasa might appear as true, thatis the force of Maya; but even after its non-existence isknown, we are prone to feel otherwise at times on accountof doubts and absense of concentration of thought. Byrepeatedly reading philosophy, thinking and meditating, wewill become certain of its nonexistence. The next elementair is only one-tenth of this Akasa and is therefore equallyfalse. In this manner, comingdown to the lowest and themost insignificant cosmology of man, the immensity of theglory of Bramhan will be known. This is the way to become a Jivan-mukta".

 The above is practically the real commentary upon thePuranic descriptions of the apparent geography detailed.The Brainhanda itself is measured out as only one-tenth ofthe subtle earth, the other elements above being ten timesguester in succession. These representthe glories of Bram-

han. The modern Pandit however can measure the grandphilosophical religion of his venerable forefathers, only withhis village geography. He would be doing great good tohimself, if he only finds out first his own real position inour religious geography. He is not even a man of thisworld, much less of the one beyond. He has virtuallyreduced himself to one of the inutilities of a nation at present, and let him understand as soon as possible, that inthese days of rapid progress, standing still means immenseretrogression. Let him take the following warning in goodparts, lest his species soon become extinct.

**"If of life you keep a care

***Q. No. VII.***

 "That nothing could be obtained by man without theblessing of the perfect and infinite Lord, is the settled opinion of the wise. Man is ever dependent and wants theblessings of the Lord, whose real nature as Nishkala orformless is known to him only through the Sastras. TheMoorthi or form of the Lord is therefore important as it is his real sign or mark, whose worship soon leads to hisformless nature. Whenever fire is required, it is availableonly as combined with a burning piece of wood and forthat reason it is not uncared for. Similarly the Lord shouldbe worshiped in his form or moorthi'.

 The use of Upasana or worship of the glories of God ishere explained, and all propogators of iconoclasm may takenote of this passage. To approach the perfect and infiniteGod with the impure and finite mind of man, is a psycholological impossibility. To secure fire free from wood or othermaterials, is a physical impossibility. How does the modernscience propose to solve the problem? Throw the whole case into the waste-paper basket or light a match and

dispose of it in a minute. These are perhaps the easiestmetho ls of getting over the difficulty. The natural presumption here is, that either something rotten lies at the bottomof the boasted science of the modern day or something iswrong in the brain of its professor. The scientist generallydevises means to take refuge in the terminus of science, onthe plea that questions of this kind do not fall within theprovince of his professed subject. So far however he maybe reckoned as honest and honourable, but his occasionalattempts to corrodo religion by the use of his science whichhe has admitted to be inapplicable, are surely inexplicable.Science is not irreligion, and he may be prepared to meet hisown science one day dictating unpalatable lessons to himconcerning his iconoclastic theory. Ordinary miseries ofeveryday occurrence in this material world, often succeedin overthrowing the fondest theories of the scientist, moreeasily and more quickly than his own science.

**आर्ता देवान्नमस्यन्ति तपः कुर्वन्ति रोगिणः।

***Q. No. VIII.***

 "The wise say that it is not practicable to display ourlove towards the formless and to proceed without a hold onsomething. The Lord in some form can be served withgreat pleasure and such worship will doubtless lead to theknowledge of his formless nature. The meditation of theLord in form produces unbounded joy, and emancipation orMukti must dance attendance before the devotional ecstasy,Besides, how is man going to expiate his sins committedthrough mind, word and deed except by such worship? Bypraying to God and by praising His glories, the sins accumulated by talk would be annihilated. Mental sins would bedestroyed by meditating on his glories. Sins by acts would

be removed by perforining the various religions and ethicalduties prescribed Karma or religious action has been longordained by God for the benefit of mankind".

 The utility and necessity of idolatry in some form arehere reiterated. The devotional acts by mind, word anddeed are said to expiate the sins committed by the respectiveorgans. Even in worldly transactions, this appears to be areasonable suggestion. In all the religious instructionsoffered, the removal of sins appears as the condition precedent to the attainment of real knowledge. Accumulationof more sins is never found mentioned anywhers, although,that is more or less what is being done on the plea ofVedantisin. If the modern civilized gentleman is howeverconvinced that he has no sius to atone for, he can very wellafford to ignore these teachings as superstitious and unscientific. But to the poor sinner, they are valuable asmeans to escape from the rigorous laws of Karma.

 **8.** Most philosophical and practical reasons areassigned for the necessity of Upasana or worship in theabove quotations and various reasonable and suitablemethods are prescribed for the benefit of mankind in general.The expiation of the sum total of sins voluntarily accumulated in the various births, is an unavoidable preliminarystep which cannot be got over by tricks or humbug. Quotation IV clearly defines the geography of Ayodhya asbeyond the regions of mundane existence. Several otherfamiliar names of places, persons and objects are similarlydescribed there. More of this shall be treated in their respective sections.

 We have by this time sufficiently investigate the significance of Bharata-varsha, now known only as the continentof India; and have clearly understood that it unequivocally

refers to the process of Upasana or worship performed inaccordance with the instructions obtained from the Vedas.We may now proceed with our enquiry regarding the application of terms now understood as denoting countries, townsan l holy centres within the boan laries of Bharata-Varsha.Wehave alreaty seen what Ayodhya mans. योद्धुं न शक्यतेइत्ययोद्धया.

 For the main purpose of this little essay, the situationof Ayodhya detailed above will have to be particularlyremembered, with a view to understand the capital of thesovereigns of the Surya-vamsa or solar dynasty who aresaid to have ruled over Bharata-Varsha or so-called India.The next important place for the same reason, is Kurukshetram, Hastinapura or Delhi, the capital of the sovereigns ofthe Soma-vamsaor Lunar Dynasty. Bat there is a sort ofgeographical confusion in the description of Kurukshetromand the sacred Benares. Both of them will therefore haveto be treated together.

***Quotation. Nos. I & II.***

 "Kuru the son of Samvarana and Tapati created the sacred Kurukshethrom by his tapas". "At the end of thefirst quarter of the Treta-yuga, Kuru created Kurukshethrom",

 Here are two separate Kurus, creating Kurukshethromby tapas, one in the Treta and the other in the Dwapara-

yuga. How to account for this variation of description ? If Kurukshethrom has been created in the Treta-yuga, whyshould it again be created in the Dwapara? Why shouldthe names of both Rajas be the same as well as of theplaces? Which of the quotations is right and which wrong? Probably no answer is forthcoming. It would be an inconvenient digression here to go into a detail discussion, as thesubject would be explained fully in the subsequent chapters.Suffice it to note here that the Kuru and the Kurukshethromof the Dwapara-yuga refer to Karmayoga, and those of theTreta allude to Gnana-yoga.

***Q. No. III.***

 "Kurus and Bharatas refer to the performance of religious karmas which protect people from dangers. Thiscould be gathered from the derivation of the words".

 There is the Niruktom, one of the most importantVedangas giving the definitions of terms as used in thereligious texts. But the Pundit cares a straw for the definitions or the Vedanga itself. He has his own definitions.of terms ready made long ago to confound the poor people.It would indeed be interesting to know the percentage ofPandits who have looked into this Niruktom or even heardof it.

***Q. No. IV.***

 "Kurukshetra is Avimukta. It is the abode of Bramha,a place for worship even by the gods. It is situated between Varana and Nasi. Because it removes all the sins ofthe previous births, it is called Varana. That which destroys all the sins, committed through the senses is calledNasi. The junction of the nose and the eyes where theheaven and Para-loka meet, is the position of Avimukta orKurukshethra".

 This is the Upanishadic geography of Kurukshethraexplained in the Rama-tapini-upanishad. Here, the Kurukshethra of the Mahabharata and the Rama of the Ramayana are mentioned. Where are now the grand archæological theories of the Upanishadic and the Puranic periods?The whole of this Upanishad must of course be condemnedas anachronism. But what ism shall we call the wantonmisinterpretation of a sacred religious subject without itsstudy? It must be certainly placed under vandalism andthe apparent anachronisms will then immediately vanish.

***Q. No. V.***

 "Sri-parvata is located on the head; Kedara, on thefore-head; Varanasi, between the brows; Kurukshethra onthe breast; Prayag in the heart; Chidambara inside the  
heart and Kamalalaya at the naval. Everyone is purifiedby holy baths at these centres. To seek for holy bathsoutside the body is to exchange a gem for a crystal".

 More geography is here given in another Upanishad.What criticisms would be forthcoming here? Perhaps, theauthors of these Upanishads borrowed these names of placesfrom the Pandit to compose their texts. These names however have their appropriate meanings in the Upanishads andthe Pandit has hardly anything applying to them. Howcould the Pandit establish priority to his local names ascompared with the terms used in the Upanishads? ThePandit's cart is surely before his horse and his eyes, behindhis face. And that is all.

***Q. No. VI.***

 "Kurukshetra or Samanta-panchaka lies betweenTharanda and Karandaka, Ramahreda and Machakruka.It is the northern region of Bramha's abode. My Avimukta is a cremation ground where I destroy the whole  

Auniverse in the form of Kala or time. It is the highestsituation and ranks highamong Gnanas".

 A high situation and Gnana here specified cannot possibly refer to any limited area of space on the surface of thisearth. Again a cremation ground for the wholeuniversemust be outside the universe. The Pandit is likely to bestartled at these quotations, but it is impossible to destroythese texts to secure his pleasure, which virtually procuresonly dishonor for our ancient religion.

***Q. No. VII.***

 "My abode known as Avimukta is not on the earthbut is in the sky. The liberated alone can perceive it bymind and others cannot see. It is the cremation groundwhere I destroy the whole universe in the form of Kala ortime. Because I do not quit that place at any time, it is called Avimukta. It is the greatest secret among the secrets,a knowledge of which procures emancipation. Among thevarious importantAvimuktas enumerated by the gods suchas, those between the brows, in the naval, in the heart, inthe head and in the sun, Varanasi lying between Varanaand Asi is the highest. The eternal Tatwom is situatedthere and there is no position greater than that".

 This is a repetition of the last description in greaterdetail, some of the slokas being almost the same; and yet itis a pity that critics want to establish the existence ofcontradictory passages in our ancient religious texts. Avimukta or Varanasi is explained as the cremation ground forthe destruction of the universe and as the permanent seatof the Lord. It is stated to be the seat of the eternalTatwom and the greatest secret, a knowledge of which procures emancipation. From such plain philosophical descriptions, how does the Pandit arrive at the conclusion that thewhole of it refers to a town in India? Could it not as we॥  

apply to a donkey in his house ? Avimukta is clearlyaffirmed as no object on the surface of the earth, but assomething in the higher regions which beings of his typecannot hope to see. Let him therefore understand now atleast, that he has been all this time only blabbering aboutsomething, he was not qualified even to see.

***Q. No. VIII.***

 "The Upanishad says that Asi refers to the Ida Nadiand Varana to the Pingala Nadi. Between these two liesAvimukta which is the great Sushumna Nadi. These threecombined makes up Varanasi. It is proclaimed by thelearned in the Vedas, that Hara teaches the Tharakamanthra in the ears of those who happen to quit their livesseated in the Avimukta, and thereby procures them finalemancipation".

 The three Nadis here specified must doubtless be discovered in the human system and not outside, whatever maybe their real significance or scientific worth. The Panditwho misapplies them to earthly localities, is certainly not aBramha-vadi or knower of Vedas as noticed in the quotationitself, for such Bramhavadis are said to explain themdifferently. The Pandit's irrelevant opinion must thereforebe completely rejected as unauthorised. It is sometimesgloriously questioned by the civilized Hindu himself,whether the above Nadis could be perceived in the post-mortem examinations, naturally under the presumption thatthey represent tubular vessels in the body. It is in thismanner that every technical term in the literature is mis-understood without seeking for its proper application, as ifthe Sanskrit terms used can have only one meaning asunderstood by the common folk. The Nadis specified referto the currents of life breath and indirectly to the currentsof thought which are both absent in a dead body. The

civilized gentleman probably believes that everything nearand dear to him will be found in the human body afterdeath. A curious expectation indeed. The question of theseNadis will appear again in the treatment of Time in thesubsequent portion of this chapter.

***Q. No. IX.***

 "The following are the devine cremation grounds Rudrais very fond of namely, Mahakalavana, Avimukta, Ekamra, Bhadrakala, Karavira, Kolagiri, Kasi, Prayag, Amareswara,Bharatha, Kedara and Rudra-mahalaya. Smasana, Ushara, Kshetra, Pittha and Vana, all these five combined can be found only in Mahakalapura. Where all sins are expiatedis called Kshetra. The region of the divine mothers iscalled Pittha. Whence there is no rebirth is Ushara. Thatwhich the elements are fond of is Smasana".

 The definitions of the various terms here furnished in thegarb of geographical descriptions, clearly point to the destruction of sins and to the involutionary processes of devotional acts. The Pandit evidently has no interest inany ofthese matters and therefore interprets them as the geographyof India. In his joyous mood he might one day treat thewhole subject as the History of England. He is almightyand can do or undo things as he likes. All fools can also dothe same without much effort:

***Q. No. X.***

 "All those who dię in the Bramha-nala called Kasi willobtain through my help, eternal liberation without rebirth".

 Here Kasi is explained as Bramha-nadi. The Panditmight cut off this word from the text, if he happens to seeit. It is very lucky that he has hitherto missed such words.Let him ever miss them.

***Q. No. XI.***

 "Kasi is another name for theeternal Eswara from whom the divine light ever flows. Smasana means theplace at which everything lies dead, and Maha-smasınarefers to the destruction of all the elements at the time ofthe great Prakriti Prelaya. The description alludes to theeternal Eswara who alone remains after the Prakriti is annihilated. He is called by the wise as Vishnu the husband ofLekshmi and also as Siva the husband of Parvathi".

 The complete destruction of all the elements, thematerial cause of creation, is alluded to in the idea of Kasi.All materialities should vanish before the eternal light isseen.The modern interpreters ever swimming in the oceanof materialities can seldom hope to reach the sacred Kasimentioned in our religion. They have not yet learned itsgeography and they will not allow others to study it. Thepassages quoted above are so plain and so sensible thatthere is hardly any difficulty to understand them in theirproper light. The only dangerous barrier at present is the  
ignorant and impertinent persistence of the uncivilizedPandit. His uncalled for and presumptuous interference inoffering his preposterous interpretations has doubtless beenthe real cause of all the present degeneration of the poorreligious Hindu. It is unfortunately a pitiable fact in thismaterial world that the evil work of a single mischievousperson often affects many a poor and innocent being.

**दुर्वृत्तसङ्गतिरनर्थपरम्पराया

***Q. Nos. XII & XIII.***

 "Beetween the brows is the lotus called Augna in themiddle of which, the subtle mind is located, within which

lies the pure intellect, within which again is the light ofAtman in the form of the bright Pranava. Above this lotus isthe lotus of Gnana in two petals, the region of the full-moon.Siva in the form of Hamsa is seated inside this Mani-Dwipaor the island built of gems. On the left side of Easwara isseated the divine, eternal and blissful mother known asSidha-kali who creates the universe. The Yogis at the timeof their departure carry their life-breath to this holy centreby the force of Yoga and pass on to the divine and eternalPurusha".

 This is a Yogic description of the geography underreference. It is a scientific treatment demanding some sortof technical study to understand clearly. But for our presentpurpose, it is sufficiently plain so as to convince us of thefact that neither the Pandit nor the critic has as yet understood our religious texts in their proper light. All thecurrent interpretations and criticisms are therefore entirelyirrelevant and must be rejected. The whole subject shouldbe studied anew, if its real significance should be knownand any profitable use made of it. As it is, it is only awaste of time to deal with it, and it may even be reasonablycriticised as superstition or worse still. But let us understand clearly by the enquiries hitherto made, that it is thePandit and not the literature the fit object for all thesecriticisms.

 **9.** Numerous additional quotations could be easilycollected to show that the terms, Kasi, Varanasi, Kurukshethrom, Avimuktom, Maha-smasanom &e., all point toone and the same nervous centre known to the Yogi asAgna-chakra. It refers clearly to the spot between theeye-brows where, Agna or a little gnana or knowledge of the

Absolute is procurable. Meditation at this Chakra or centreis prescribed for practice after necessary training on fiveChakras below, which deal with the five material elementsin their pure and unmixed state. Mahat-tatwa, Satwa-budhi or pure mind is said to be located in this spot, the meditation of which in the prescribed method is described asproductive of the means of attaining higher stages still. Theimportance of this nervous centre, I dare say is being recognised in modern days in the physiological and psychological sciences. We may hopefully expect many a moderndiscovery in this sphere, to be found in our ancient literature,not only as predicted but as completely utilized for mostimportant purposes. More of this shall be detailed later on.Some more important terms like the above which throw further light on the main topic may be explained by thefollowing quotations.

***Quotation. No. I.***

 "Adhara is known as a centre in the lower extremityof the spinal column. It is the seat of the gods, vedas andof creation. To the west of this Adhara is the confluence ofthe Thriveni or three rivers, bathing where man expiateshis sins".

 The Pandit's confluence at Allahabad is not certainly thejunction of the three rivers here specified in the human body.All the three rivers will be pointed out by the Yogi hereand the significance of their names will be explained by him;but the Pandit will miss one of the rivers at Allahabad andhe has absolutely nothing to say about them except thatthey are big rivers where a large number of Hindus go and  
bathe. His explanation is doubtless overflowing with religious and scientific informations. His overboldness in talking such nonsense with an air of authority exhibits the depthof his ignorance and the worthlessness of his prolific explanations.

***Quotation. No. II.***

 "Prayaga is the seat of Bramha and it is made by theGods, by combining the three subtle elements, earth, waterand fire".

 The three rivers and their confluence are clearly explained here, but the Pandit cannot of course catch themeaning of the explanation, simply because he has never

heard of the subject in his life time. For that very reasonhe feels confident that he is qualified to interpret the contentsof the unknown text. He represents a curious and unknownspecies of human creations.

***Q. No. III.***

 "If you churn or destroy the existing cosmology by theknowledge of Bramhan, that which afterwards remainspertaining to me, is called Mathura".

 The eternal divine element that remains after the elimination of all materiality is clearly specified by Mathura. ThePandit must therefore identify the same with somethingmaterial, without the least respect or consideration for thereligious instructions conveyed by the Upanishad. He is avery religious personage indeed!.

***Q. No. IV.***

 "Mathura, the sole seat of Vishnu is a lotus of thousandpetals, and it is as large as the Vishnu-chakra in its extent.When man becomes purified by Tapas, Dhyana and otherdevotional acts, he perceives this my favourite town; othersfail to see searching for it even for ages. The residents ofMathura are greater beings than even the gods and they arevery powerful. All of them possesses four hands".

 This is another geography of Mathura. Its extent isthe same as that of the Vishnu-chakra and it is in the formof a lotus of thousand petals. Does the Pandit understandanything by this description and will he kindly show us this lotus? It is said that no irreligious person could see it.The Pandit with all his boasted qualifications, is after allonly an irreligious person unfit to perceive this Mathura.Has he at least seen any of its inhabitants during theirtravel outside, and has he found any of them possessingfour hands? Has he any idea of what these four hands

mean? Perhaps the residents of Mathura are all of themgraduates of the University of Allahabad and the four handsrefer to their wearing the University gowns. Evidently thePandit has not studied the geography of Mathura properly.The original geography itself is available for us and he maytherefore keep his commentaries to himself.

***Q. No. V***

 "The lotus from which Brahma originated came out ofPadma-sarovara which is known as Pushkara-kshetra."

 The Pandit often appears in his interpretations like theoil-monger in the Indian fable. The oil-monger desiredthat the sun should not rise for several days and then moreof his oil would be used by the people for lighting. He forgot in the meantime that his oil seed would not dry for the extraction of oil.

***Q. No. VI.***

 "The divine and eternal forest known by the nameof Brinda-vana is the highest region of Vishnu. It is fiveyojanas in extent and situated above the Bramhanda, on theSushumna Nadi called Kalindi. The gods and the elementsreside there in their subtle form. My permanent residencealso is in this forest and my incarnations and subsequentdisappearance in the various yugas take place here. It is abright region of light which even the Bramha and the gods.cannot see, much less man with his mortal eyes".

 Does the modern Pandit still stand in need of furtherexplanations to convince him of his egregious mistake, in theinterpretations he volunteers ? The Brinda-vana is hereclearly mentioned as situated above the Bramhanda. Isthis forest therefore in the North-West Provinces inIndia?The Kalindi or Yemuna is defined as representing

the Sushumna Nadi, and does that therefore represent ariver and not the Nadi? The incarnations of Vishnu areequally plainly stated as taking place in the Sushumna-Nadi,and do they for that very reason allude to human beings bornon the earth? The forest is specified to be invisible even toBramha and the Gods, and is the Pandit a greater being thanall the Gods? It is particularly mentioned that this forestcould not be seen by the Pandit's leathery eyes, and whatdivine eyes is he gifted with, more than ordinary men ?When the sacred texts are so full of details, how does hedare to give out his ignorant and stupid interpretations of a  
serious subject without even a look into the literature ?Could he ever hope to commit such outrages with impunity,in regard to ordinary worldly subjects like Chemistry, Geometry or even Carpentry? He is sure to obtain his inmediate reward for such mischief. **H**is impertinent intrusionin the sacred sphere of religion, without the least fear, showsclearly the nature and extent of his religious faith and devotion. He is virtually the most irreligious Hindu, takingundue advantage of the innocent and the pious in the landand trying to make a living by sheer blaspheme. This isthe real history of our modern Religious Pretender.

**अज्ञात्वा ग्रन्थतत्वानि वादं यः कुरुते नरः।  
लोभाद्वाप्यथवा दम्भात् स पापी नरकं व्रजेत्॥**

***Q. No. VII.***

 "From that eternal entity, Radha-Krishna originatedwho after performing tapas for a thousand Yugas, divided himself into Radha and Krishna. Both of them, then separately performed tapas for a thousand Yugas, and from thebodies of both proceeded a bright light destroying darkness,from which the divine Brindavana originated. 21 Prakritisextending to 4 yojanas each, make the 84 yojanas of Brindavana. From the Prakritis of the ten senses, ten villages

originated, namely, Gokula, Varshabha, Nanda, Bhandira,Mathura, Vreja, Yamuna, Manya, Sreyaska and Gowpika. From the Prakritis of the ten elements, ten forests sprungup, namely, Brinda, Gopa, Behula, Madhusringa, Kunja,Vana, Dedhi, Mahakreda, Remya and Venupadma. Fromthe Prakriti of mind, the Govardana mountain originated".

 The religious evolutionary processes downwards fromPrakriti and Purusha, or Radha and Krishna are here explained. It may be easily noticed here that the conceptionsof these 21 items in the philosophical analysis of humancosmology, as existing in their pure and unmixed condition,are alluded to in all these descriptions. They are reckonedas the glories forming part and parcel of the Lord in Hissaguna form. They represent the highest philosophical conclusions arrived at by the most practical and scientific psychological analysis. Meditation of these highly abstract factsas displaying the glories of the Almighty, is invariablyprescribed throughout the religious literature of ours. Without clearly understanding the real import of this sacred andscientific subject, reckless criticisms are unnecessarily hurledupon it under the mistaken impression that the whole of itis idolatry. It may be, for ought we know that it is aprocess yet unknown to the Westerns, but that in itself, is noargument against its real worth. In the Western scientific division of human cosmology into mind and matter, subjectand object, the former naturally gets the predominance, andthe methods of studying both are entirely different. Themodern criticisms generally proceeding from the materialscientists against mental facts, without their proper study,cannot but be irrelevant and unscientific. The materialscientist has not the monopoly for everything in this world,and the knowledge accruing from the study of his subject  
has its own limits as that acquired from any other branch of

study. Mind is not matter and God is not man. Mindcreates and destroys matter as God creates and destroys man. The one is independent and the other is dependent. Thescientist forgets these eternal facts, when he aggressivelytrespasses upon these sacred grounds.

**ईशकार्यं जीवभोग्यं जगद्वाभ्यां समन्वितम्।  
पितृजन्या भर्तृभोग्या यथा योषित्तथेष्यताम्॥**

 The psycholical and religious processes for transition fromthe material to the spiritual sphere are here scientificallyprescribed. We have already noticed in the last chapterin detail, that in our philosophy, both mind and matter fallunder Prakriti, in which all the items are classified into twogeneral divisions, the pure and the impure. The existingmodern psychological and physical sciences resolve themselves into the impure variety. The detail heads of the purevariety are the same as those in the impure variety, but theircharacter and working are entirely different, being opposedto the meterialistic tendencies of the other. The pure itemsare alone reckoned as Tatwoms and glories of Suguna-bramhan. The impure varieties constituting the western psychology and physical sciences are treated as the products of Prakriti in its aspect as Avidya. All that pertains to this Avidya will evolve and produce never ending misery, and allthat constitutes the pure Tatwoms, involves and leads to emancipation. The existing creation, combined as it is with a largeamount of wickedness and misery, is attributed in our religious literature to the work of Prakriti as Avidya, andnever represented as the glories of God. The special Tatwoms descrided in the above passage are alone recognised asHis glories. Otherwise, the all merciful God as guaged bythe impure category, must also be pronounced to be all-cruel,allwise must be all-stupid and all-powerful must be all-weak.

Our ancient religion humble and simple as it is, is free from all these dangers of civilization.

***Q. No. VIII.***

 "Mathura where Hari incarnates, was perceived in theheart.Kasi was found between the brows, Maya in theAdhara, Kanchi, below the naval, Avanti at the naval,Dwaraka and Prayag at the throat, Ganga and Yemuna oneither side of it and Saraswathi in their midst. Gaya wasfound in the face, Prabhasa between the chin and the throat,Bedari in the head, and Poundravardhana and Nepal in theeyes".

 Descriptions of this sort furnish the necessary clues tounderstand the gist of the subject. The names of localitiesif properly understood would be found to be exclusivelyappropriate termsfor the technical facts specified. They are neither meaningless nor borrowed from the names of placesin India. The holy baths and temples, now existing in Indiawere named after the terms in the religious texts as most ofthe Hindus are given the various names of Gods. ThePandit's cart has of recent years become so troublesome thatit always gets before the horse and the Pandit goes behindit and almost misses the horse. He has virtually lost hiscontrol over both, but vainly pretends to own the cart.

***Q. No. IX.***

 "This is the philosophical exposition of Gayatri. Gayameans Prana or life and that which saves it is Gayatriknown also as Savitri".

 Here we are plainly told the real meaning of Gaya, asreferring to one's own life. The Sradhas and other religiousceremonies pertaining to this sacred Gaya, clearly allude tothe saving of one's life from sins leading to perdition. Gaya isalways pointed out to the north specifying the Gnana-marga

to be necessarily followed by man. The Pandit's idea ofGaya and Sradha is always concentrated in the bread andcake that would fill his stomach.

***Q. No. X.***

 "The wise name it Dwaraka, because it contains plentyof Dwaras, openings or door-ways. for the admission ofDharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha. The residents ofDwaraka both males and females possess four hands".

 The whole of this is inexplicable to the Panditand doubtless appears absurd and ridiculous to the irresponsible critic. What enlightenment could we hope to obtain from either under the circumstances? Absolutely none,and how long are we expected to recognise them as ourreligious guides? Dwaraka clearly refers to the purifiedheart of man ready to receive all devotional acts. The fourhands constantly mentioned allude to the exact extent orcapacity of the devotional spirit. The number of handspoints out the limits within which the devotee is qualified towork.

**सत्वं रजस्तम इति अहङ्कारश्चतुर्भुजः॥**

 'Satwa, Reja, Tama and Ahamkara make up the four hands'.A devotee who still retains his egoism must ply within thebounds of the three gunas specified. It is a particular stagein the worship of Saguna-bramhan. The Dwaraka and thefour hands are not therefore meaningless absurdities as unhesitatingly criticised.

***Q. No. XI.***

 "Where the Maya of Vishnu fails to exercise her control over man by keeping him bound by material desires, itis called Mayapura, Haridwar, Mokshadwar and Gangadwar. It is the first step in the ladder to Vykuntha.Bathing here leads to the highest region of Vishnu".

 The definition of Haridwar and its synonymous termsare sufficiently plain. The destruction of worldly desires isthe first step to the devotional path. When one has qualified himself so far, he has reached Haridwar or Mokshadwar.An irreligious and wicked dunce going by rail to Haridwarin Upper India lies certainly far away from the Gangadwarand Mokshadwar here specified. The Pandit may here beinformed if necessary, that the train which takes him toHaridwar will not carry him further to Vykuntha. Hisfaith in the religious text which he is determined to misunderstand, will only make him all the more miserable. Hislearned colleagues in the village will explain the subject tohim more fully. They readily expound that losing one'slife is going to Vykuntha, and that is certainly a surer andmore convenient process.

***Q. No. XII.***

 "The Ida Nadi, which is Siva's Sakti, Kala or power,is known as Narmada which destroys sin and procuresliberation".

 It is plainly explained here that Narmada is anothername for Ida Nadi. It is therefore its original significancein the religious literature. There must be some cogentreason for calling a particular river in India by that sacredname. That is not questioned anywhere in this essay. Whysome of the rivers and temples in India are consideredsacred to the Hindu will be shortly explained in this section.But it must be clearly understood that the text here speaksonly of the sacredness of the Ida Nadi and not that of theIndian river. A religious and pious Hindu in America orGreat Britain, wiser than the Pandit, would be quite welcome to name a river there as Narmada in honour of thisIda Nadi. The Pandit has no right to question his piety orprivilege.

***Q. No. XIII.***

 "Many divine rivers with plenty of waters have sprungfrom the divine lakes. TheAkasa or sky which is thesupport for the elements and the Gods, isitself theocean herecalled Soma. The divine holy river known as Akasa ganga,starts from thisAkasa and runs through the same. Itpasses through the regions of air and stars, playing about inall directions. Its holy waters are used by the Siddhas.Like the sun it appears and reappears every day'.

 It is a fine description of Ganga. The Akasa calledalso Soma is the subtle element known as Akasa in ourreligious philosophy. The waters of this river are said tobe available only for the Sidhas. The Pandit therefore in his present attitude towards our religious texts cannot hopeto obtain a drop of its holy waters.

***Q. No. XIV.***

 "The holy waters of the Ganga are the liquid forms ofVishnu and of Siva. Ganga is the Prakriti and the supportof Bramhandas. She represents Sudha-vidya, Sudha dharmaand the form of Para-bramhan. Siva keeps her on his headfor the sake of protecting the universe. Siva extracted theessence of the Yoga-upanishad and converted into this Gangafor the benefit of mankind".

 This supplies additional explanation on the constitutionof Ganga. It is clearly stated to be the essence of Yogarepresenting Sudha-vidya and Sudha-dharma. Our sacredGanga is therefore full of technical importance and deservesto be studied very carefully, without of course being misledby the Pandit and the Critic, who have evidently lost theirclaims to approach this Ganga of our ancient religion.

***Q. No. XV.***

 "The Agni or fire known as Samsya, Havya-vahanaand Ahavaniya in our religion, fell in love with the follow-

ing sixteen rivers; Kaveri, Krishnaveni, Narmada, Yemuna,Godavari, Vitasta, Chandrabiaga,Iravati, Vipin, Kousiki,Satadru, Sarayu, Sita, Saraswati, Hradini and Pavani".

 That a fire falling in love with a number of rivers cannot be literally interpreted, is a fact any ordinary personcan understand, except perhaps the learned Pandit. Thename of the fire is technically significant, and it is describedhere in detail as Ahavaniya. The Pandit however knows itonly as a fire lighted in a pot with paddy husk. There arethree kinds of fire mentioned in the religious literature.They are said to be located in three parts of the humanbody. Ahavaniya is in the face, Garhapathya in thestomach and Dekshinagni in the heart.

**त्रीणि स्थानानि भवन्ति मुखे आहवनीय उदरे गार्हपत्यो हृदि दक्षिणाभिः॥**

 When the specific reference of these fires and similarly ofthe rivers are ascertained by studying the texts, the passagequoted here will be full of meaning. It is a technicalsubject which neither the Pandit nor the Critic can ever hopeto understand by sheer pretension and insolence. We mighthowever for our present purpose be assured that the fire herementioned does not refer to the one burning in the Pandit'spot as it could not possibly marry a river which containswater. Fire thrown into a river would immediately beextinguished. The rivers also similarly could not refer toany running streams in India. In spite of all this, thePandit must maintain the fire as fire, and rivers as rivers inIndia. May God bless his brains.

** 10.** The descriptions of places, forests, hills andrivers in the above quotations are sufficiently explicit as towhat they do not represent. They are stated to be heavenlyand not earthly. Several of them are specified as seated in

the human body. The sources of heavenly rivers enumerated are traced to the sky and the fire. The plainness andclearness of such descriptions found, page after page, in thevarieties of ancient literature, without in the least contradicting one another, are so tempting that every line inducesone to reiterate the criticism as to the depth of ignoranceexhibited in the modern reckless interpretations. It isevident that the mistakes primarily originate from sheerignorance, and subsequent perversity, from pride and inpertinence.

 The subjoined is a quotation from Suprabheda agama.The Agamas are more directly in touch with such matters,as they always deal with more practical and ceremonialportions of religious and philosophical subjects. The passagehere, quoted completely specifies the significance and application of all the preceding descriptions. The whole of itrefers to the Upasana-marga, detailing the higher glories ofGod, apart from those connected with the earthy and transient cosmology with which the ordinary worldly-wise manis at present acquainted. It is a geography of the higherand purer sphere of existence, if geography it should be  
styled. The two geographies have nothing in common, nay,they are diametrically opposed to each other. Confoundingthe two is doubtless a sin, as it is virtually denying thehigher one, which alone is capable of giving us any safeabode. How the modern interpreters will therefore fare inthe light of these sacred passages reproduced here, I leavethe readers to think well and judge for themselves. Themost charitable view that can be taken in the matter is, thatthe task of these misinterpreters is unnecessary and unprofitable, if not uncalled for.

 “The Adhwas, means or methods are of six sorts,namely, Tatwa, Bhuvana, Manthra, Varna, Pada and Kala.By these six processes, the Eswara who is single may beknown. The first one, Tatwa-adhwa begins with thesubtle element, the earth, and extends to Maya. This Prithivi or earth includes all the divine Lokas. The Bhu-lokais 50 koti yojanas in extent. Bhuva-loka extends roundthe Meru and contains the Sun's loka of Leksha yojanas.The Moon's loka is Leksha yojanas above the sun. Thestarry regions, Leksha yojanas above the moon. Budha orMercury is 2 Leksha yojanas above. Bhargava or Venus is2 Leksha yojanas above. Angara or Mars is still 2 Lekshayojanas above. Brihaspathi or Jupiter is again 2 Leksha

yojanas above. Souri or Saturn is still 2 Leksha yojanashigher. The Sapta-rishis, namely, Atri, Vasishta, Pulasthya,Pulaha, Kretu, Angira and Marichi are a Leksha yojanasabove. Dhruva or the Polar star is a Leksha yojanas higherstill. From the Moon to Dhruva is Swar-loka. AboveSwar-loka is Mahar-loka of 2 koti yojanas. Above it isJena-loka of 85 Leksha-yojanas. Then Tapo-loka of 8 kotiyojanas. Above it is Satya-loka of 12 koti yojanas. Fromthe Mahar to Satya, Rudras reside. Above these is Bramha-loka of 16 koti yojanas. Above it is Vishnu-loka of 1 kotiyojanas. Above still is Rudra-loka of 9 koti yojanas. Allthe above Lokas put together make up Prithivi-tatwom.Ten times greater in extent is Water-tatwa all round thePrithivi. The following are situated within it, namely,Ameresa, Prabhava, Nimisa, Pushkara, Ashadhisa, Pindisa,Harabhuta and Vakula. Ten times still larger is the encirclement by fire, within which lie, Harischandra, Susyla.Jelpera, Amratikeswara, Mahakala, Madhyama, Kedara andBhyrava. Ten times greater again is Air-tatwa withinwhich lie, Gaya, Kurukshethra, Nakhala, Naakhala Vimala,  
Attahasa, Mahendra and Bhima. Ten times this air isAkasa within which lie, Vastrapada, Rudrakoti, Avimukta,Mahalaya, Gokarna, Bhadra-karna, Suvarnaksha and Sthanuka. Ten times greater still is the encirclement of Aham-kara, within which lie, Khagalendu, Karanda, Umakoti,Mandaleswara Kounjara,Sankukarna,Sthuleswara and Staleswara. The following is the list of 36 Tatwas originating fromSivatatwom, the 5 subtle elements, Ahamkara, Budhi, Guna,Avyakta, Raga, 15 senses, Vidya, Kala, Maya, Atma, Sudha-vidya, Sadakhya, Bindu, Nada and 2 Saktis. Bramhandais known as Prithivi, and Prakriti is known as water. Up toVidhya is fire-tatwa, up to Sadasiva is Air-tatwa, up toSakti is Akasa-tatwa, up to Maya is Siva-tatwa and up toSakti is Vidya-tatwa".

 An ordinary lay man could easily feel here the highlytechnical smell of the subject. Most of the proper namesintroduced in the passage quoted, are entirely unknown andmeaningless to the Pandit, Critic and Theosophist, and yetthey would venture to catch some of them from the middleof the description and attempt to make some silly and shameless use of them. The treatment of the subject however, istoo plain, to deceive any one possessing common sense, byextraneous explanations. The whole of it is clearly statedas representing the 36 religious Tatwams. In the astronomical description given here the Moon is placed far abovethe Sun, but it will be invariably found so described in allthe Puranas and Itihasas without mutual contradictions.This might certainly form a fit subject for the exercise ofthe ingenious brain of the Pandit who is likely to go so far as to establish that in Puranic times, the Moon was stationedabove the sun. Volumes might be written on the contraryby the Critic on the Indian ignorance of astronomicalsubjects, until they were learnt from the Greeks, Romansor even the Red Indians. The point in question will bedeferred for subsequent treatment as these unsympatheticelucidators will hardly find anything very interesting tothem here. There are several other important matters whichmany ordinary people may take for serious scientific factsyet unknown to the Western scientist. These collateralobservations may perhaps be rejected as vain hopes emanating from superstitious beliefs; let us therefore leave themhere and proceed with the main subject.

 In the apparently geographical form of descriptiondetailed in the above passages, the general schemeis prescribed for religious meditations on the higher glories of theCreator. It should be carefully noticed and rememberedhere that the Bramhanda as described is beyond the possible

cosmological conception of ordinary man. It includes the14 Lokas explained above, but in itself extends only to atenth fraction of the sum total of earthy element. Encircling this earthy element, lies the element of water ten timesgreater in extent. Within this environment, the familiarnames, Nimisa, Pushkarom &c. are found, and are probablysignificant as Thirthas or holy baths. Similarly round theelement of water, the region of fire is described ten timesgreater in extent. Within this also several names appear,such as Harischandram, Kedarom &c., and they may besignificant as cremation grounds. Beyond fire is the environment of air, within which Gaya, Kurukshetrom &c., aredescribed as situated, and they may be significant as connected with Prana-yama or regulation of breath. Beyondair is the encirclement by sky or ether, within which Avimuktom, Mahalayam, Gokarnam &c. are mentioned, andthey may be significant as higher states still. Beyond ether  
is the encirclement of Ahamkara or Egoism ten times geeaterin extent. The whole of this geography is clearly stated.in the latter part of the quotaion as referring directly to the36 Tatwas well-known in the philosophical analysis. Virtually, all these signify the higher states of mind and intellect, developed and purified, by religious meditations, alwaysof course accompanied by the strictest practice of the highestmorals.

 The chief object aimed at in this little volume beingonly to get at the right method of interpretation and not anexhaustive treatment of even a portion of the subject, thepresent section dealing with the so-called Indian Geographymay well be closed here. But the modern ignorance andperversion exhibited in the interpretation of this religiousgeography is so great that it might be necessary and useful,to summarise the import of the passages hitherto quoted, forconstant reference.

** (1)** The religious geography has absolutely nothing todo with India or even the mother earth as a full globe. Itdeals with far more serious and subtler facts.

**ऊर्ध्व धरायाः भूर्लोकः भुवर्लोकस्ततः परः॥**

 **(2)** The Jambu-Dwipa, in the middle of the sevenislanded earth, is the devotional sphere mentioned in our religion and has no reference to any earthy or materialstuff.

**जम्बूद्वीपस्य संस्थानं यज्ञिया यत्र वैक्रियाः॥**

 **(3)** The Bharata-varsha, one of the nine divisions ofthis Jambu-Dwipa, represents the Karına-kanda or sphereof religious Karmas ordained for the pious Hindu.

 **(4)** The 14 Lokas making up the Bramhanda is onlyene-tenth of the Prithivi or earth described in the Puranas.

 **(5)** Round this Prithivi-tatwom is the Water-tatwomten times greater than the Prithivi and is said to containthe Puranic Nimisa, Pushkara etc.

 **(6)** Similarly ten times greater in extent is each of theremaining elemental Tatwoms, Ahamkara, Budhi etc. In each of these, several of the Puranic centres are mentioned.

 This is the plain description of our technical religiousgeography, dealing with the pure devine Tatwoms prescribed for religious and philosophical meditation on the realglories of God. Tatwom means 'That-ness' or that whichpertains to the real and eternal Eswara. The Pandit whounnecessarily meddles with our religious literature cannotapproach the Tatwoms without philosophical study andthought. He thus ignorantly reduces them to his villagegeography which is ordinarily dirty and unhealthy. He

has not yet secured the first Bhumi among the seven enumerated for the religious Hindu. He is not even in theBharata-varsha, which as a matter of grace, he is allowed tomention in the Samkalpa of his religious cermonies. Hemust open his eyes now, if he does not wish to sink deeperstill in degeneration. At any rate, he has no rights, legal,political, social or religious, to drag the innocent religiousHindu to the mire of his ignorance and force him to bedrowned with him. The foreign Critic, the civilized Hinduwho is his apish imitator and the Theosophical juggler, whowere all originally deceived and misled by the learnedPandit, might now honourably retire from the field carryingthe Pandit with them if they choose. It is certainly nomatter for disgrace, as all men are apt to err in this materialworld. The Pandit doubtless has however been originallythe cause of all this present confusion, and his mistakes arehere exposed with the best available evidence and authority.It is absurd to criticise the science of Arithmetic on accountof a problem mistakenly worked out by its student. Themistaken impressions regarding our religious geographyhave become current only through the ignorant interpretations of our veritable Pandit. Let him now be once for alldismissed from the council of religious advisers in India, andlet more respectable members bè substituted. Amen!

** 11.** The next point demanding enquiry is thedescription given in our ancient literature regarding Time ascalculated by Yugas and their cycles. But before commencing with this, it may be necessary to say something about

the existing and recognised Thirthas or Holy baths in India,as they still stand an inexplicable riddle, especially after theelaborate treatment of their geography in the precedingpages. It cannot but be confessed here, that, with ourpresent limited knowledge of the subject as a whole, thepassages from sacred texts reproduced above, serve, more orless, only as destructive elucidations rather than constructive.The difficulty and confusion here is nothing new. Theyhave been unconsciously caused all along, by our venerablePandits, as repeatedly observed, by misunderstanding thehigher and lower application of the intended object. TheThirthas themselves are distinctly classified as Manasa andBhowma, mental and physical, internal and external, theformer being certainly recognised as more important thanthe latter. The subjoined quotations clearly enumerateand explain the special value of Manasa-thirthas.

***Q. No. I***

** **“Vasishta said, 'Oking', I shall describe to you the mental Thirthas or holybaths, by bathingwell in which, man attains emartcipation.Truthfulness is & Thittha, so is

forgiveness, control of the senses, mercy, straightforwardness, charity, contentment, Dhyana, devotion to Siva etc.The highest among the Thirthas is purity of mind, becausesimple dipping of the body in water is not recognised as aholy bath.A cruel, haughty, sensual, miserly wretch,never gets purified by bathing in all the sacred rivers orother baths. He is still a dirty sinner as before. Theaquatic animals born and dying in water, do not on thataccount get their minds purified or obtain salvation. Intensedesire for worldly pleasures is known as mental impurity;its removal is mental purification. The place in which amentally purified person resides, is really the Nimisa, Pushkara and Kuru-kshetra. The mental Thirtha is filled withthe water of Dhyana, purified by gnana and capable of  
washing away the dirt of desire, anger etc. He who bathesin this Thirtha is sure to obtain liberation".

***Q. No. II.***

 Snana or religious bath means removal of mentalimpurity and soucha or cleanliness means controlling thesenses. Merely washing the body with water and clay isbut the worldly bath. The dirt of egoism sticking on allover the body should be washed away by the water and clay,of gnana or knowledge, and vyragya or freedom frompassion. The meditation of the Tatwas is the highest, studyof the Sastras ranks next and that of Manthras is thelast. The mania for the external holy baths is the lowest."

***Q. No. III.***

 "The internal Thirthas are more important than theexternal ones. Atma-thirtha is the highest, all the rest areuseless. Bathing in the external Thirthas with an evil mindinside, never procures purity. A pot containing toddy neverbecomes pure by any amount of washing outside".

 Thirtha generally means a remedy, means or expedient.In religion, it especially refers to all the processes of purification prescribed. The term is applied therefore to both internal and external purifications The modern mistakelies in interpreting it as dealing with the external purifications alone. From the above quotations, we have seen thatthe external processes as such, are of no avail, unless accompanied by internal purifications. The texts speak veryclearly on the point, and the modern interpreters thereforeboldly explain otherwise.

** 12.**The extreme importance of moral rectitude, charity and sincere religious devotion is established by theabove passages as opposed to hypocracy and mere externalcleanliness. In spite of the very strong language used inthese quotations, it is however a very interesting point tonote, how the idea of baths in holy centres as a religioussubstitute for, or a supplement to, the canons enunciatedabove, struck the ancients, in the interest of the lower ordersof society. The subjoined quotations assign simple reasons,sufficiently scientific and convincing, so as to induce everyreasonable person to appreciate the necessity and advantageof resorting to these Thirthas.

***Q. No. I.***

 "Water is by nature pure and purifying. It is the life-giving food for all created things. All the Vedas say thatwater is the form of Narayana",

***Q. No. II***.

 “Bathing in water accelerates digestion, increases strength and rernoves itch, dirt, sweat, laziness, thirst, heat andsin".

 The use of water as an external purifier is vividly explained here. No other element could possibly be substituted for the purpose, and hence water and bath constitutethe chief items in external purification.

***Q No. III.***

 "I shall narrate to you the reasons assigned for thesacredness of the holy centres established in the various parts of the country. In the human body itself, some partsare considered good and others not so. Similarly some portions of the earth are good and others bad. The Thirthasare established in consideration of this important fact.Some places are healthy by nature and sometimes possessrare and convenient situations and contain excellent water,

Combined with these, there must be another essentialcondition, namely, the recognition by the great Rishis.All such Thirthas are sacred and should be visited. But themental Thirthas already enumerated must always be attended to. One who takes to both the Thirthas will attainsalvation".

** 13**. The above passages deserve and demand themost patient and careful scrutiny; and it must be emphatically affirmed that they do not confirm or even corroboratethe current interpretations, assigning historical importanceto the Holy centres in India and connecting them with specific descriptions found in the Puranas and Itihasas, takingthem as representing places of historical incidents. In theface of the so-called geography examined already, it is unnecessary at this stage to reiterate the arguments for theconviction of any reasonable being as to the absurdity andirrelevancy of the modern views. The only point for useful enquiry here would be to trace the causes that led to thesemistakes.

 We have seen all along, that the procedure adopted inour sacred literature was to descend step by step from thehighest philosophical truths to suit the varying intellectualcapacities of man, without at the same time losing sight ofthe main goal. The Puranas and Itihasas took up theVedas and served as their commentaries, treating the purely philosophical truths, in accordance with certain definiteformulas prescribed in the Vedas themselves, and consistentlyfollowed throughout.The abstract ideas were to someextent concretised and narrated in the garb of Divine histories and geographies. The subsequent pages of this book,will it is hoped make this clearer still. In the meantime,something must be said at this stage regarding the identification of certain places in India with the names found in

the literature. For the very commencement of religiouspractice, the purification of mind and body was found anecessary preliminary step, owing to the degeneracy of manas he is at present, and the two distinct processes above detailed were formulated. As regards the means for externalpurification, the efficacy of good water, none can deny. Theinfluence of healthy forests, fresh air and enchanting scenerycombined with beautiful temples situated in the adjoininglocalities, where abundance of fresh water is procurable inthe shape of falls and running rivers, will certainly be admitted by all, as not only exhilerating to the physical bodybut also soothing and ennobling to the worry-ridden mind.This is exactly the sum and substance of the quotationsreproduced above. Any further twisting of their meaningis unwarranted by the texts and therefore unauthorised.The application of certain terms from the literature, asnames to places or persons, cannot certainly be an exeuse fortheir misinterpretation. The names of Gods invariablyfound applied to all the Hindus, will not justify their stylingthemselves as Gods in comparison with the human beingselsewhere. No more serious argument is required to establish the mistakes in the confounding of earthy spots inIndia with the ideas conveyed by certain religious andphilosophical terms, especially when their meanings are unknown and unsought for. It is equally absurd and insultingto be told that religious centres and holy baths exist only inIndia and all outside is unholy. On the contrary, if westick on to the current interpretations, the passages hithertoreproduced will clearly prove that everything outside Indiais bliss and happiness and everything within is ephemeraland miserable. The eternal and blissful region is describedas lying to the north and beyond the Himalayas. VideMaha Bharatom Santi-parva.

**उत्तरे हिमवत्पार्श्वेपुण्ये सर्वगुणान्विते।  
पुण्यः क्षेम्यश्च काम्यश्च स परो लोक उच्यते॥**

 Hundreds of cases like this may be quoted if necessaryillustrating the absurdity of the modern interpretation. Infact, the localities, their dimensions and other descriptionsgiven in the texts, seldom correspond, and are never meantto correspond, with the modern attempted identifications.The river Saraswathy mentioned in the Puranas had certainly no physical existence at all, but it is now explainedas Antar-vahiny or running underground unseen at Allahabad. The impossible junction of Kaveri in Deccan andNarbuda in Central Provinces, as also the situation of Dwaraka described as on the banks of the Jumna and within theboundaries of Indraprasta or Delhi, found mentioned in thesubjoined quotation will certainly take our Pandits by surprise.

**कावेरी नर्मदां यत्र सङ्गता लोकविश्रुता।  
तत्र स्नात्वा शुचिर्भूत्वा कुबेरस्सत्यविक्रमः॥**

**क्षेत्रं कलिन्दजातीरे मत्तुल्यास्तत्र ये मृताः।  
विरिश्चे रचिता तत्र स्वकीया द्वारकापुरी।  
इन्द्रप्रस्थान्तरावर्ति न्येषा या द्वारका द्विज।  
नातः परतरं मर्त्येतीर्थमस्त्यखिलार्थदम्॥**

**पद्मपुराणम्॥**

 The subsequent applications of these terms as names tocommon objects might have been for the purpose of familiarising the public with their usage and set them athinking,at least in their leisurely moments. It is no doubt aningenious method of spreading the higher philosophicaltruths among the ordinary people to give them a sort ofcurrency and permanency which could never be expected by

mere publication of books or even by preaching. The stories often utilized as models for religious and moralinstructions tend to keep them in memory as they haveactually done. The majority knows them only in thismanner, but a very limited minority might have heard thePuranas read and explained on religious and festive occasions.Somehow, a great portion of the literature has become incourse of time, the household property of every Hindufamily. The highest gratitude of every pious Hindu is therefore due to the wise and venerable sages for the great boonthus rendered. But the Pandit who stands in the way offurther progress, which the far-seeing Rishis certainly hadin view, is liable for his uncalled for interference and unprivileged forwardness in thrusting in, his misinterpretations.

 The new alien creed styled Theosophy which is generally misunderstood as supporting Hindu religion, is equallyresponsible for voluntarily propogating mistaken theories inthe land pertaining to the contents of our sacred literature.It is certainly too late now for its disciples to conceal ignorance with occultisms and secret doctrines. The mistakescommitted with regard to the point in question are exactlysteriotyped repetitions of our local Pandits, and do not even exhibit an atom of originality in them, in spite of theirstrenuous efforts to give them a scientific shape. The usualmistakes lie at the bottorn and are irremediable at the topFor the purpose of offering convincing and conclusive proofof this fact, it will suffice at this juncture to illustrate oneserious and important blunder exhibited by Theosophicalignorance of the so-called geography in our sacred literature.

 The subjoined quotation from Mrs. Besant's Sanathana Dharma, page 234, will bear ample testimony to thetruth of the above remarks, Many a repeated identificationof Bharata Varsha with India by Mrs. Besant, within he

small para itself here reproduced, is verily the oldest rottenmistake of our local wise acres.

 "In the ancient days Jivatma was prepared for entranceinto each caste through a long preliminary stage outsideIndia; then he was born into India and passed into eachcaste to receive its definite lessons; then was born away from India to practise these lessons; usually returning toIndia to the highest of them, in the final stages of hisevolution".

 It is however desirable to find out if possible whetherthere are any cogent reasons for describing in the sacredtexts, certain philosophical ideas in the form of cities, mountains and rivers and giving thern an appearance of geographical treatment. It must be clearly remembered that they areinvariably mentioned as divine and not earthly as we havealready seen. Their venerable authors are not thereforeresponsible for the modern confusion of these with terrestrialobjects. High abstract truths which will not permit ofbeing easily expressed in human language had to be somehow explained.

**चोद्यं वा व्यवहारो वा क्रियतां द्वैतभाषया।  
अद्वैतभाषया चोद्यं नास्ति नापि तदुत्तरम्॥**

 "There is no scope for question or answer in the languageof Adwitom. The language of Dwitom is the only availablemedium for such purpose". The material world is thereforethe last resort for their analogical illustrations. Thus,certain religious and philosophical ideas were treated asGods, especially those representing the spiritual or efficientcauses in the philosophical analysis of creation and evolution.For the same reason the transformations of Prakriti ormaterial cause or the Tatwas as they are styled, had to be

described as the region of Gods, in the form of divinecities, divine mountains and divine rivers &c. Again, themain difficulty was not completely overcome. The forms  
of Gods are yet unknown and they were represented in thebest imaginable form of man, with necessary alterations,additions and paraphernalia, the details of which shall betreated in the subsequent section III of this chapter. In thesame manner, the devine cities, hilis and rivers could onlyresemble the earthly ones, with necessary alterations in size,colour and material &c. In the Yoga sastras, the nervouscentres which form the physiological bases for the aboveTatwas were often described as mountains and Peattas orseats, and the never ending currents of Vasanas, thoughts orbreath were naturally represented as ever-coursing rivers,  
carrying with them everything they catch on their way totheir ultimate destination. We have already seen thatGanga, Yamuna and Saraswati represent, Ida, Pingala andSushumna Nadis, and that the water in the Viraja river is made up of the sweat of religious devotion.

 "The hollow through the spinal column is the BramhaNadi called Sushumna lying between Ida and Pingala. Thesun, moon, fire, Eswara, elements, Lokas, Dwipas, oceans,mountains, all lie within this Nadi; also the Vedas. Sastras,Puranas, Manthras &c. Its roots are above and the branchesare below. Out of the seventy-two thousand Nadis in thehuman body through which air courses, the Sushumna aloneis the Sakti of Siva, the rest are useless".

 The current mistakes could not however have arisen fromthis unavoidable method of treatment. The subsequenterection of temples and location of Bhowmathirthas, withthe terms in question applied to them as names, have givenan opportunity for confusion of facts, virtually for puttingthe cart before the horse. Neither the cart nor the horsewas a mistaken factor, but the mistake occurred in their misplacement. As matters are now interpreted, they have cometo mean that Vishnu originated after the temple at Srirangomwas constructed and Siva after that of Benares and*not* the temples after them. The Sthala-puranas of suchplaces are also now completely misinterpreted and are exactlyabused and ill-treated like the Puranas themselves. Noneof them I dare say narrate any absurd and irrelevant storiesas now generally explained, but they very reasonably andingeniously furnish clues to the exact meanings of certaindefinite facts and formulas hitherto detailed. The Thirthasas a class invariably refer to Varana and Asi as in Benares.

 The same story is repeated with slightly altered descriptionsto suit the differences of local conditions and necessities. Theproof of all this fact is but a simple matter of unbiased andsympathetic investigation; and I must entirely leave it tothe judgment of those who are sincerely interested in thesubject. In consideration of the limited scope of this littleessay, I cannot help ending the present section here. Hadit not been for the immense amount of irremediable confusionproduced by the mistaken interpretations of this religiousand philosophical geography, I would certainly have stoppedmuch earlier.

**SECTION II.**

**ON TIME.**

 **1**. The main divisions of Time represented in oursacred literature are; Parardhas, Kalpas, Manwantaras,Yugas and the cycle of 60 years commencing with Prabhava. A more general classification of it is into Sthula and Sukshma, gross and subtle. This latter classification will have tobe first examined, as it is the foundation for the varied descriptions given, in accordance with the usual formulas  
always followed for the purpose of expressing abstractmatters in more concrete terms. It is simply the ignoranceof these formulas that has led to the present confusions. Itmust however be admitted that such restrictions and limitations in the meanings of terms used in the treatment of anyscientific subject, are unavoidable even in the material sphere,and the necessity and plea for such a procedure is thereforegreater in the spiritual sciences. It is probable that theexistence itself of such a distinction in the calculations of

time might surprise our learned Pandits, but nevertheless, itis a bare fact in reference to the literature in question withwhich they are not perhaps sufficiently acquainted, owing tofalse dignity or for other serious reasons.

 The following quotations denote the necessary methodfor understanding some of the given descriptions whichappear as pertaining to Time.

***Quotation. No. I.***

 "The currents of breath may be controlled by the forceof mind. The breath ordinarily passes alternately throughthe left and right nostrils for three Nadikas at a time; andthe Yogi should base upon this fact, his internal calculationsof time regarding day and night, fortnight, month andAyanas".

 This Upanishad here is very clear in its postulation ofa formula for the Yogis, to calculate their own time as different from that of the ordinary man. The Pandit might particularly take note of the fact here, that the ancient Rishiswhose favourite residence was the forest, had more than onecloth to wear, but that in spite of his living in the town, hehas only one, with nothing to spare.

***Q. No. II.***

 "The Ida or current of breath through the left nostril istechnically called the Moon, and Pingala on the right isknown as the Sun. The passing of breath from the rightto the left is also technically known among philosophersas Uttarayana. The reverse is Dekshinayana. The junctionof Ida and Pingala is Amavasya or new moon. When thelife breath reaches Muladhar, it is Vishuva or the New Year'sday. Inspiration and exhalation are beginnings of months.When the life-breath passes to Kundalini through Ida, it isLunar Eclipse, and through Pingala it is Solar Eclipse. Inthese specified holy times, such as Vishuva, Ayana, Eclipse&c., if one bathes in the similarly specified centres in thebody, such as Varanasi etc, he is sure to be purified".

 The above is indeed a double bombardument upon themodern interpretations of our religious times and places. Ifthe ignorant and impudent interpreters hope to escape fromthis, more shall be soon kept ready for them.

***Q. No. III.***

 "That which creates time itself, which is the realcause of the creation and destruction of the Devas and othercreatures, is here known as time. When such time is preserved, creations and destructions vanish. Some create withthis time, others get entangled in it. There are two kindsof time, the Sthula and the Sukshma, the former is meantfor the worldly and the latter for the Yogis. The Sthulais again calculated in two ways; by the lunar rotations forman and by the solar for the Devas. The calculation fromthe Prithivi Tatwa to Siva Tatwa is known as Satwa kalaor time, pertaining to the gradual involutions of the Tatwasnamely of, Eswara, Atma, Sadasiva, Nadanta and Sakti upto Siva Tatwa. Three Sukshma breaths make one SukshmaPrana, and six such Pranas make oue Sukshma Ghatika,and sixty such Ghatikas make one Sukshma day. Furthercalculations of Pakshas, months and years go by the samemultiples ordinarily used for Sthula time. The involutionof the Devas and Bramha is calculated in Sukshma time, asalso the work of the Gnanis and Yogis".

 The divine energy that creates time itself is known asTime here. Three distinct varieties of this Time are hereelearly explained as the Sthula, the Sukshina and the Satwa.The Satwa refers to the involutions of the religious Tatwaswhich are entirely unknown factors to the modern interpreters of our sacred religion. The Sukshma is mentioned aspertaining exclusively to the Devas, Bramha, Gnanis andYogis. The modern Pandit and critic who belong to noneof these specified classes, ignorantly misapply the Sukshma

time to their own Sthula variety, which alone they haveevidently heard of hitherto. They are therefore entirelymistaken at the very foundation, and their ignorant presumption that all our religious and philosophical texts describeonly their householl affairs, certainly displays the most idiotic impertinence that one can imagine.

***Q No. IV.***

 "Thus the Yoga of meditation has to be continued,until the ultimate Bramhan is reached. The two pathsprescribed for this Yoga should be followed, the one which  
takes to the highest stage through the Sukshma Nadi isknown as Uttarayana and the human body is known asSamvatsara or year."

 The significance of our religious time is evidently becoming more and more irksome to the Pandit and hiscolleagues. The human body is here explained as the year.'संवत्सरो वै प्रजापतिः'. Samvatsara or year is Prajapathy." समस्तानि हि भूतानि एतस्मिन् संवसन्तीति संवत्सरः" That withinwhich everything resides is Samvatsara. These are surelyquotations which are more than the modern Pandit couldbear. The only conception of the Samvatsara he is capableof, is the occurrence of the anniversaries in his house and the prospect of filling the stomach with bread and cake on theoccassions.The sacred religious literature bequeathed to usby our ancient sages, is so voluminous and so full of usefulinstructions conveyed in the simplest and clearest possiblelanguage, that it is indeed a pity that the Pandit with allhis Sanskrit learning is not destined to swallow and digest asingle useful drop out of it, so as to save himself from endless perdition.

**भ्रातश्चातकपातकं किमपि ते सम्यङ् न जानीमहे

** 2.** It is evident from the above quotations that thecalculation of time found detailed in the sacred texts clearlyrefer to its Sukshma form and represent the functions ofthought and breath as regulated by Yogic processes. Thegeneral terms of measurement however are retained as thesame in the treatment of both Sthula and Sukshma varieties,and a sort of analogical comparison is maintained with a viewto utilise the Sthula form for the practical benefit of theless qualified classes. The concretised forms and the ritualistic ceremonies of the Karma-kanda are based upon theseanalogical formulas and are consciously prescribed for thepurpose of attaining certain definite aims in the gradualprogress of religious practice. They are certainly not theaimless outcome of the whims and caprices of our venerablesages, nor are they useless and unscientific superstitions asthey are so lightly and conveniently pronounced in moderndays. The mere fancy or even respect for material sciencecannot form an excuse for off-hand criticisms of any facts ortheories without proper scientific investigations, and suchcriticisms in themselves are no signs of originality or respectable intelligence. 'Critics all are ready made,' and no bodyneed therefore care for them. The following passages enumerate the different divisions of time as described in the texts.

***Quotation. No. I.***

 "Nimesha is the time taken to open and close the eyesin the normal condition. 1/4 of this is a Tuti; 2 Tutis make1 Lava; 2 Lavas make 1 Nimesha; 15 Nimeshas,. 1 Kashta;30 Kashtas, 1 Kala; 1/2 Kala, 1 Kshena; 2 Kshenas, 1 Muhurtha; 1/2 Muhurtha, 1 Ghatika by which everything ismeasured. 3¾ Ghatikas make 1 Sandhi; 2 Sandhis, 1Yama; 4 Yamas, the day time".

 The scale of time for the divisions of the day time startswith Nimesha or the twink-ling of the eye, one-fourth ofwhich is called Tuti, the lowest in the scale equal to about13 seconds. This is the scale for the ordinary calculation ofhuman time.

***Q. No. II.***

 "The ultimate Bramhan is doubtless without form, without change, without attributes. The conception of thesmallest atoms or Paramanus as originating from this Bramhan is only a deductive inference. Both the Sthula and theSukshma forms of time are thus inferred. The smallestamount of time that pervades over a Paramanu is also calledParamanu. 2 Anus make 1 Paramanu and 3 Anus 1 Tresarenu which is the smallest atom that could be perceived inthe ray of sun's light passing through a window. The timethat pervades over 3 Tresarenus is known as a Truti, 1/10of it is 1 Vedha; 3 Trutis, make 1 Lava; 3 Lavas, 1 Nimesha; 3 Nimeshas, 1 Kshena; 5 Kshenas, 1 Kashta; 15Kshenas, 1 Leghuta; 15 Leghutas, 1 Nadika; 2 Nadikas,1 Muhurta; 6 or 7 Nadikas, 1 Yama; 4 Yamas a day and4 Yamas one night. A Yama is measured by the flow ofone Presta of water through a small hole in a vessel. 15days make 1 Paksha, 2 Pakshas, 1 month or the day andnight of the Pitris. 2 months make 1 Rethu. 6 monthsmake 1 Ayana and 2 Ayanas, the Dekshina and Uttara37

make 1 year, the day and night of the Devas. 100 years isthe longivity of man. The universe including the planets,stars &c., is thus made up of Paramanus. Samvathsara,Parivatsara, Idavatsara, Anuvatsara and Vatsara are thevarieties of the year".

 "Vidura said— You have now described to me the divisions of time pertaining to man, Pitris and Devas. Kindlytell me the nature and method of calculation of time asapplying to others, who by their Yogic knowledge keep outof its limitations as just explained.

 Mytreya said — The Yugas named Krita, Treta, Dwapara and Kali made up of 12,000 divine years apply to them.The Yugas consist of 4, 3, 2 and 1 thousand years, respectively, excluding 2000 years allowed for their mutual junctures Leaving the period for such junctions, the intervalsin which Dharma rules, is recognised by the wise as Yugas.This Dharma is complete in the Krita Yuga and diminishesby 1, 2 and 3 quarters respectively in the remaining Yugas.A thousand cycles of these four Yugas make one day forBramha, outside the first three Lokas. The same periodextends over his night. During the day time 14 Manus rulefor about 71 Chatur-yugas. each, during which Rishis andDevas are born. This is the daily creation by Bramha extending to the three Lokas. At the end of each day the threeLokas are burned down by the fire of Samkarshana andcovered by the ocean, agitated by the air. The Bhrigus andothers, at the time remove themselves from Mahar to Jenoloka. The days and nights of Bramha are thus calculatedup to 100 years as if his age is limited by that period.Half of his age is known as a Parardha. The first half ispassed which is called Bramha-kalpa when Bramha is knownas Sabda-bramhan. The second and the current half iscalled Padma-kalpa, owing to the lotus-earth that sprang

from Hari's naval and is also known as Varaha-kalpa because Hari incarnated as a boar. These two Parardhas areafter all, in reality only a Nimesha of the Lord who is beginningless, endless and formless. The exhibition of his gloryextending from Paramanu to the two Parardhas, no mortalman given up to worldly desires can possibly comprehend".

***Q. No. III.***

 "The Bramha's day and night are known as Kalpas. 366such days make one year for him and a hundred years socalculated make two Parardhas."

 The above quotations themselves tell more than theordinary story now prevailing about the divisions of Time asdetailed in our ancient literature. The calculation starts withthe smallest scientific atom which is multiplied and increasedin extent up to Parardhom. The atom virtually is a pointwithout dimensions and it creates only an idea of space. Theidea of Time is generated by calculating the time required forthought to pass from one point to another; and hence it isexactly the modern philosophical explanations of space andtime as co-existence and succession. From the Anu or atomat the bottom of the scale the calculation rises to the topmostfigure the Parardom, two of which makes a hundred years'life-time of Bramah the creator. There are Manwantarasand Yugas intervening, which are made up of years.The year is practically the highest figure that can becognised by its component parts, and it does not createany confusion so far, except perhaps in the application ofAyanas and Pakshas, the half-year and half-month as daysof Gods and Pitris respectively. We must however beginfrom the top of the scale, namely, Parardhom, to discover theclues for the correct interpretations of these uncommon andunknown terms in the calculation of time mentioned in thetexts.

 In quotation 3, Vidura enquires of Mytreya regardingthe special kind of time, different from the human calculationjust explained, applicable to the working of those indifferentto worldly affairs, like the Yogis. The Yugas are then mentioned as referring to such time, in which the quantity ofDharna, is ascertained as their essential characteristics.

**तमेवाहुर्युगं तज्ञा यत्र धर्मो विधीयते।**

 The Yugas according to the root meaning naturally applyto the work of the Yogis and fall under the Sukshma varietyof time. These Yugas have been already noticed in theprevious section as found only in the Bharata-varsha, thedevotional sphere of action for the religious man. The general significance of Yugas is thus clear at least so far as toits inapplicability to the years and centuries in A. D. or B.C.The error in the current interpretation of the Yugas, willbecome more evident from the special quotations, to followon the point. The difference between the first Parardha andthe second, the Bramha-kalpa and the Padma-kalpa shall beexplained in the next section on Personalities. We mayhowever safely note here that none of the modern interpreters have yet taken the trouble to enquire what a Parardhasignifies and whether any definition for the term is furnishedin our religious literature. How are they going to excusethemselves for this culpable mistake evidently caused byignorant pride and irresponsible prejudice? If they evercared to look into the sacred texts, they would not haveventured to play with our ancient religion in the mannerthey have done. The Pandit by his ignorant and irrelevantinterpretations, has unconsciously allowed more than sufficient room for the foreign critic to attack the acknowledgedworth of the literature from all its sides. In spite of theseunfortunate mistakes from two different quarters, the facttacitly remains that the majority of the educated and un-

educated Hindus are never satisfied with the Pandit's explanations and are immensely annoyed at heart with the currentdestructive criticisms. That neither of these elucidations therefore contain anything sensible, useful or acceptable is virtually proved.

नहि कस्तूरिकामोदः शपथेन विभाव्यते॥**

***Quotation. No. I.***

 "When the three gunas maintain their equilibrium, itis called Prakriti-laya or dissolution of Prakriti; and it ishere described as the night of Bramha. His day refers tothe divine creation here narrated. In reality, he has neithernight nor day. The annihilation of the material world isspoken of as Pratisanchara or re-absorption back into Prakriti. The destruction from the Mahat to the gross elements is called Pratisarga. Final and complete destructionor involution is secured only through gnana. The elaboratedescriptions given in the religious texts refer to the Varaha-kalya. Several such Kalpas pertaining to Vishnu, Rudraand Bramha are also mentioned in the Puranas by the Rishisin their treatment of Time. In the Satwic Kalpas, theglories of Vishnu are predominant, in the Rajasic, Bramha'sand in the Tamasic, Rudra's. The current Varaha-kalpa isSatwic".

 It is plainly stated here that the division of time intothe days and nights of Bramha, alludes simply to his glories.The Prathisarga or secondary creation here mentioned refersdirectly to the involutionary processes by the annihilation ofmateriality.

**महदाद्यं विशेषान्तं यदा संयाति संक्षयम्।  
प्राकृतः प्रतिसर्गोयं प्रोच्यते कालचिनतकैः॥**

 The term refers to one of the five requirements of a Puranahardly understood by the Pandit.

**सर्गश्च प्रतिसर्गश्च वंशो मन्वन्तराणि च।  
वंशानुचरितं चैव पुराणं पञ्चलक्षणम्॥**

 Under the present state of ignorance, one need not evenbe astonished to hear some Pandits explaining Sarga andPratisarga as Chapters and Sections in a Purana. Thecurrent interpretation of Pratisarga as applying to materialcreation is therefore not only varying from truth, but diametrically opposed to it. However willingly and respectfully we may view the modern opinions, it is absolutelyhopeless to obtain even an atom of useful and correct information from them regarding the contents of our sacred texts.

***Q. No. II.***

 "The creation described refers to his day and the dissolution to his night. Understand that he has neither nightnor day. They are so described in a complementary stylefor conveying the instruction to the religious public. Athousand Kalpas make 1 Abda of Bramha ; 8,000 Abdas,1 Yuga; 1,000 Yugas, 1 Savana; 6,000 Savanas representhis longivity. Koti into Koti into one thousand make oneParardha. Two Parardhas make one Parom. The seventeenth figure in the Arithmetical notation known as Parardhais mentioned as representing half the age of Bramha. Thehighest Arithmetical figure is here given only in accordancewith the Puranic method of description. A Parardha should therefore be properly interpreted as Aparardha or no Parardha, meaning infinity thereby".

 It is clearly explained here that a Paradha is the seventeenth and the highest figure in the Arithmetical Notationby multiples of one hundred, and that its application to theage of Bramha is in accordance with the Puranic formula.It is also stated as in the previous quotation that the daysand nights of Bramha are mere complementary descriptions.It is naturally feared that these facts would prove startlingnews to our enlightened interpreters.

***Q. No. III.***

 "The creation by Bramha during the day and the dissolution in the night are only described in a complementarystyle. His age is specified as extending to two Parardhas. Whatever is created during the day dissolves when nightfalls. The four Lokas, Bhu, Bhuva, Swar and Mahar aredissolved at night, others above them are not affected. In thenight, when everything is covered by the ocean, Bramhasleeps in the waters, and then he is known as Narayana”.

 This is a repetition of the facts already explained in thepreceding quotations. No Crìtic need now ingeniously devisespecious apologies for his sweeping remarks constantly made,as to the existence of contradictory statements in the religious texts. He has hardly seen for himself any statementsin their true light to enable him to judge of their contradictions or conformities. His traffic has all along beencarried on with the bankrupt of a Pandit and he could therefore show nothing to his own credit at present. He haspitiably failed in one of the fundamental requirements ofmerchandise, and it is now too late for him to brood over it.We have already noticed in the previous section that Bhuloka is stated to be far above this material earth, and wefind here that the creation and destruction attributed toBramha's work apply only to the first four Lokas, from

Bhu to Mahar and therefore do not include this earthy globe.The ocean in which these four Lokas lie submerged duringthe night of Bramha, does not also form part of any of theoceans, seas or gulfs mentioned in our modern geography.Bramhas' sleeping in the waters of this ocean is explained ashimself being converted into Narayana or Vishnu. This iscertainly an unbecoming statement to the delicate and keenear of the modern interpreters, but there is no help for it asit is so stated in the text. This point however will be explained in detail in the subsequent section on Personalities.

*** Q. No. IV.***

 "Seventeen figures in the Arithmetical Notation, bymultiples of one hundred, are named by the Rishis as follows,Unit, hundred, ten thousand, Ayuta, Prayuta, Arbuda,Nyarbuda, Kharbuda, Kharva, Nikharva, Samku, Padma,Samudra, Antya, Madhya and Parardha. Two Parardhas make one Parom, thus there are eighteen figures. Two Parardhas are calculated for the two Kalpas or day and night ofBramah. The Parardha mentioned here denotes the higheststate imaginable, with regard to his power, longivity, tapas,Sakti, Dharma, knowledge, stability, Bramhatwa, gnanaand Iswarya. He is the highest and the noblest among thehigh and the noble. The Arithmetical finite figure given is in accordance with the Puranic method of description andsignifies infinity. The Parardha here actually means Aparardha or no Parardha and should be interpreted as beyondeven such an ultimate figure. His real nature is determinedby Eswaras with their pure and divine eyes. From this wemust understand that Gnana is the real foundation foreverything".

 Parardha is clearly explained here, as the highest figurein the Arithmetical notation by multiples of one hundred,and as denoting infinity in its application to the age of

Bramha. Both of these facts, the modern interpreters, haveprobably to learn now for the first time in their life. But without a study of the texts they knew for a long time, by,virtue of their own intellectual superiority, that Parardhaapplied to some early period in B. C. when Bramha was bornsomewhere in Tibet, and created India and their forefathersfor the propogation of the irrelevant and incoherent historyof the two dynasties that ruled over Oudh and Delhi. Whatan insolent and objectionable presumption concerning a subject, where one ought to tremble, before he makes bold tolay his hands upon ? Is there any evidence of intelligence,of religious spirit, of propriety or even of common sense inthis vandalic effort ?

**गुणेषु क्रियतां यत्नः किमाटोपैःप्रयोजनम्।  
विक्रीयन्ते न घण्डाभिर्गावः क्षीरविवर्जिताः॥**

*** Q. No. V.***

 "The Saktis or energies of creation &c., in Bramha,denote his innate nature, and are described as originated, only as a matter of complement. They can however beunderstood only by Gnana. His one hundred years of age,extending to Parom, and its half representing a Parardhaare only postulated, as a suggestion from man's ownlongivity'.

 The explanations here furnished are too plain andsimple to demand any commentaries. The age of Bramhaand his creations here described are thus religious conceptions, whose real signficance could be understood by theacquirement of Gnana. There is however not the slightestdoubt as to their inapplicability to any historical incidents taking place on the surface of this material earth.

*** Q. No. VI.***

 "In the Arithmetical notation, eighteen places are namedby multiples of one hundred. The two Parardhas together

signify the Prakriti-laya, the involuion or merging of all theVyaktas into the Avyakta. This constitutes the day time ofVishnu, and when the Prakriti itself merges into the Purusha,it is the night of Vishnu. The eternal Vishnu however, has  
neither night nor day. All this is simply stated in a complementary style. In this manner, the involutionary religiousprocesses up to Prakriti-laya are described".

 It is evident from this quotation that the two Parardhasof Bramha combined, complete the Prakriti-laya or the annihilation of finite conceptions. Here, Bramha's jurisdictionends and Vishnu's begins. The merging of Prakriti itselfinto the Purusha, is described as the night of Vishnu.These Puranic narrations in the texts are repeatedly assuredto be complementary descriptions, to avoid chances of misinterpretation.

**इत्येष मुनिशार्दूलाःकथितः प्राकृतो लयः॥**

Has the Critic, Pandit or Theosophist ever looked into theseexplanatory passages before they ventured to convert thecontents of the sacred religious texts into an insignificanthistory of the mortal man? For aught we know, the foreignCritic is sincere in his curiosity to understand the contents ofIndian religious literature. But the microscopic minorityof apish imitators among the educated Hindus are completely wanting in the sincerety and the curiosity of the Critic,when they volunteer to confirm and strengthen the Critic'sviews by their authoritative opinions as Hindus. It ispractically deception and misleading, when such confirmations are based upon entire ignorance of and culpable indifference to the subject. An educated Hindu of this typehas however the least claim to style himself a representativeof the religious and learned Hindus in the land. He isdoubtless responsible for his misleading the foreign patron

and betraying his own sacred religion in false colours to thediscredit of his fellowmen, besides subjecting himself to hisown religious deterioration. It is a pitiable truth that theso-called religious reformers of the modern day are mostly tobe found among this class. It is also a wonder how suchmen shamelessly take a pride in calling themselves benefactors of their countrymen, when they by their ignominious conduct only succeed in displaying their moral andintellectual weakness, religious indifference and want ofcharacter and self-respect. Whatever might be the apparenttemporary benefits acquired personally, the attempt as awhole being entirely a deviation from the right path, isinevitably doomed to fail in the long run, and it would betoo late then, to rue for the mistakes consciously committed.

**यावत्स्वस्थमिदं शरीरमरुजं यावज्जरा दूरतो  
यावच्चेन्द्रियशक्तिरप्रतिहता यावत् क्षयोनायुषः।  
आत्मश्रेयसि तावदेव विदुषा कार्यः प्रयत्नो महान्  
सन्दीप्ते भवने तु कूपखनने प्रत्युद्यमः कीदृशः॥**

** 3**. The above quotations conclusively prove that thewhole affair is a simple rendering of the Infinite in thelanguage of the Finite, the abstract fact in the form of theconcrete Arithmetic for the express purpose of showing theimmensity and magnitude of the object described. TheParardhom is the 17th and the last figure in the Arithmetical Notation reckoned by multiples of one hundred, insteadof ten. Parom means great and Ardhom position. Thus,the highest state of existence to be attained is explained bythe height, the present low, degraded and mortal man has to ascend by strenuous efforts and religious devotion. Thehundred years making up a Bramha's period are clearlystated in Quotaion V, as having been predicted in accordance with the longivity of man himself. This period is divided

into two exact halves consisting of 50 years each. Thecurrent time is represented as the beginning of the latterhalf. The applications of these divisions and variations ofTime could be easily understood when references to the'Personalities' are examined in the subsequent section. Itmay however be noted here that the former half points tothe Gnana and Upasana processes and the latter to the Yogaand Karma processes.

**वेदो ब्रह्मा इति शृतिः II**

The Vedas are represented by Bramah and they prescribethe above two methods conforming to the capacities of manfor the attainment of salvation. Next to Parardhom, theManwantaras and Yugas have to be examined. The day ofBramha which covers all ideas of religious creation and existence is divided into 14 Manwantaras consisting of 1,000Chatur-yugas or cycles of four Yugas, each Manwantara extending to about 71 Chatur-yugas. The interval of timeelapsing between two Manus is called a Manwantara and itcan be better explained while treating of Manus themselves.Besides, the examination of the meanings of Yugas will alsothrow some light upon the calculation of a Manwantara. Asearching enquiry may therefore be first made with regardto the Yugas. The subjoined quotaions are I fear likely tofrighten our self-constituted interpreters out of their wits.

 “In & treatinent of the history of the Yugas, Krita isSatwa; Treta is Reja; Dwapara is a combination of Rejaand Tama; and Kali is Tama. In the Krita, there is noaction of any kind, good or bad, all that has to be done inthe Lokas having been already done. There are also nodivisions of castesandAsramas, and no intermixtures".

 The Pundit, in his usual style, is sure to rush in here,with his thoughtless interpretations. If theYugas refer tosome ancient periods in the history of man, as he, the Criticand the Theosophistwould wish to establish, will they tellus how man could exist in the Krita, as described here,without actions of any kind? If again the Critic and Theosophist want to prove the non-existence of castes and Asramas in ancient days like the Krita, will they explain whythe absence of admixture is specially noticed ? The actionsgood or bad, said to have been already accomplished in Krita,are those pertaining to the various religious Lokas, whoselist has been already found to exclude this material earth.

**सकृदेवकृतं सर्व यद्वै लोके कृताकृतम्॥**

 It is therefore certain that neither the transactions of theworldly man, nor the distinctions of Indian castes, nor againthe utility and urgency of destroying them, by interdiningand intermarrying, are here spoken of. Every layman ofordinary common sense can easily infer from every word inthis quotation, that both the current interpretations, andcriticisms, proceed from sheer ignorance of the subject andfrom an unbecoming spirit of unnecessary interference. Thesubsequent quotations are sure to exhibit this fact in strongerlight. The modern methods of explaining the subject for theenlightenment of the religious public are therefore extremelydistressing and ruinous.

***Q. No. II.***

 "The wise say that there are four Yugas in the Bharata-varsha and that they are nowhere else. Dhyana and tapasin the Krita; Gnana in the Treta; Yegna in the Dwaparaand Dana alone in the Kali are specified. In the first Krita,Dharma exists, it is manifested in Treta, it is distracted inDwapara and destroyed in Kali".

 The Pandit here is extremely happy to note that noneof the Yugas get out of Bharata-varsha.He preservesthem within the boundaries of his India. The Theosophistof course is prepared to go over this spot for his use of theYugas. The foreign Critic will surely get bewildered here.If Yugas allude to the periods of human history, why shouldother nations outside India be deprived of their benefit? Probably other nations in the world, were never affected by

the trammels of time, in ancient days. Different states ofDharma are stated to be the distinguishing characteristics ofthe Yugas. In the Krita however, this Dharma is not evenmanifested, it remains latent. Is there any modern interpretation available to make this statement intelligible? As times advance, why is this Dharma said to deteriorate anddwindle to nothing especially in these modern days of civilization and progress? Perhaps it is so described in uncivilized times. Will the Pandit at least tell us why Dyana,tapas, gnana and Yegna are uncourteously excluded from  
Kali, when so many of his learned colleagues are found allover India? What is the harm if the present generation inKali take to any of these religious processes, and could the Pandit assure that no one in India is violating this rule?

 My good God ! it is indeed a wonder why no answersare forthcoming for any of these pertinent questions, fromany of the quarters from which we had so much noisehitherto.

 "There are four Yugas in the Bharata-varsha, namely,Krita, Treta, Dwapara and Tishya. The longivity isreckoned as 4,000 years in Krita, 3,000 in Treta and 2,000in Dwapara. In the Tishya, it is uncertain, death occurringsometimes in the womb or soon after birth'.

 Why is the much despised Kali called Tishya heremeaning auspicious or fortunate? In this quotation also, thefour Yugas are mentioned as found only in Bharata-varshaIf, in the current Kali, even the chances of living are so pre-

carious, as described here, why not the Pandit get out of his India to be free from its clutches? Again, does he believe that his forefathers lived for four, three and two thousand years respectively in the three previous Yugas, as described here, and if he does, has he any sort of proof to establish the same? On the other hand, will the Critic or Theosophist accept this description, and if not why? These are surely natural questions arising from the modern interpretation of the passage here quoted. If no reasonable answers are available from any of these so-called interpreters, how are we bound to accept their interpretation, while they invariably bring with them unmerited disrepute to the sacred texts as well as to their venerable authors? The interpretations of these self-made authorities are certainly not more valuable to us than the religious texts, and themselves not so venerable as the ancient Rishis.

***Q. No. IV.***

 "The advent of exaltation is also like the coming in of deterioration. When Dharma is well attained, the Krita Yuga is clearly seen. Goodness is the ruling principle in the Krita, it is lost in the Kashaya or Kali. Time is unchanging like the moon, which when veiled by darkness is Kali and when unveiled is Krita. The inseparable and unknowable Parom-bramhan is the Arthavada or object in view in the Vedas. The approved and valid process for obtaining it, is Tapas, and that is confirmed here. Cessation of Karmas is attained by meritorious virtues, which in themselves are purified by Karmas".

 It is clearly stated here, that the realisation of Bramhan is the chief aim of the teachings in the Vedas, and that the

proper process for it is Tapas. The absence of Tapas isspecified as Kali, Kashaya or confusion. The removal ofthis confusion, Tama or Agnana produces Krita. The important scope and extent of Tapas, and its different stages ofattainment are here established by the division of the Sukshma and religious time into four Yugas. It is repeatedlyassured that these Yugas are not found outside the limits ofBharata-varsha. This is an additional corroboration for thefact that Bharata-varsha refers to the devotional sphere ofreligious Karmas and that the Yugas explain the degrees ofperfection attained therein. The devotional sphere is therefore described as space in the Puranic style and the Yugasas time.

***Q. No. V.***

 "Krita is the greatest of the Yugas, where eternalDharma is complete, having no more to be done. In theKrita, there are no Devas, Danavas, Yekshas, Rakshasas andPannagas; there is no buying no selling; no difference ofVedas and no human action. The Dharma is Sanyasa.Pertaining to this Yuga, there is no disease, no weakness ofthe senses, no laziness, no pride, no prejudice, no fear, nogrief, no quarrel. The highest Bramhan is the ultimateattainment for the Yogis in this Yuga. The Atman is inthe form of Narayana, pure and white, and Atma-yoga isthe distinguishing characteristic of this Yuga. The threegunas are here absent and Dharma has its four quarterscomplete. In the Treta, Vishnu becomes red and a quarterof Dharına is lost. Tapas, Dana, Satya, Yegna, Swadharma and religious Karma remain firm in Treta. In theDwapara half the Dharma is lost and Vishnu becomes brown.On account of the ignorance of the single Veda, it is dividedinto four, some taking to three, some to two or one andsome to none of them. Some fall from Satya or truth and

consequently diseases and misfortunes result. Dharma greatlydeteriorates and Yegnas are performed to obtain Swargaand to satisfy worldly desires. In the Kali, only one quarterof Dharma remains and Vishnu becomes dark. Dharma,Yegna and Achara dwindle to nothing. Diseases, misfortunes, sorrows, anger, laziness &c. arise. As the Yugasrevert, Dharma also reverts with the Lokas. The Lokasappear by meditation and when the Lokas disappear, everything deteriorates and spoils".

 The Yugas are here distinguished by the different degrees of Dharma prevailing. In the Krita it is completelyfinished, nothing more having to be done. It is clearlystated here that in the form of human action there is absolutely nothing in this Yuga, 'क्रियानासीच्च मानवी'IAtma-yoga is said to be the distinguishing characteristic of theKrita Yuga.

**आत्मयोगसमायुक्तो धर्मोऽयं कृतलक्षणः॥**

These are extremely plain and unambiguous statementswhich will not in the least permit of the modern interpretation, as alluding to the historical periods of Hiudu, Mahamaden or European soverigns in India. The Pandit's interpretation here displays his utter ignorance of the subjectand utter lack of common sense. It might perhaps suggest,by the laws of association, the funny slokas in Sanskritknown as Anterlapika.

**का पाण्डुपत्नी गृहभूषणं किं को रामशत्रुः किमगस्त्यजन्म।  
कः सूर्यपुत्रो विपरीतपृच्छा कुन्तीसुतो रावणकुम्भकर्णः॥**

If the Pandit is still anxious to understand the Yugas ashistorical periods, he may have the consolation of knowingthat the Krita Yuga refers to the history of every Yogi

practising Atma-yoga in which all human affairs now worrying the Pandit's brain are entirley annihilated. The practice of the lower forms of Yoga is described as representingthe three remaining Yugas. It is a noteworthy fact herethat the single Veda has to be divided into four by theadvent of Dwapara. Again another important fact noticedin this quotation is that meditation brings on the Lokas andthat when the Lokas are gone everything deteriorates.

**लोके क्षीणे क्षयं यान्ति भावालोकप्रवर्तकाः॥**

Have the modern interpreters any explanation to offer herefor our enlightenment? There is no poetical fancy nor anyexaggeration here. These are the only two expressionsyet known to them to cover their ignorance. They mustconfess here that the description is entirely unmeaning. Itcannot but be so, as the whole subject is misunderstood fromits very commencement. It is also a vain belief that theyhave understood anything before or after this passage. Thosewho understand the real nature of the subject can clearlyunderstand that every line in the text is completely misunderstood at present. Every school boy knows that arithmetic is not geography. The Pandit evidently knows neitherarithmetic nor geography and it is no wonder therefore thathe confounds the two together in his presumptuous attemptto explain an unknown subject.

***Q. No. VI.***

 "You need not foster the least doubt as to whether thenature of time depends upon the character of the Raja, orthe character of the Raja depends upon the nature of time.The nature of time is entirely shaped by the character of theRaja. The four Yugas named Krita, Treta, Dwapara andKali allude to the history of the Raja; in fact, the Raja ishimself the Yuga. When the Raja enforces Denda-niti orjustice completely, it is called Krita the best of the Yugas.

Dharma is unabated and Yoga is safe in Krita. Voice,colour and mind are then highly developed. When three-quarters of justice are enforced, the Treta is originated. Whentwo-quarters of justice are enforced, the Dwapara is originated. When no justice at all is enforced, Kali is originated.Then, there is no Dharma and no safety for Yoga. Thecastes get intermixed. The Raja is actually the creator ofKrita, Treta, Dwapara and Kali. By creating Krita, heobtains the highest heaven and by creating Kali, he obtainsthe deepest hell. By the creation of the other two Yugas,he obtains the proportionate happiness. Mahadeva, the godof the gods, created from his own Atma, the Denda, for thepurpose of sustaining the Lokas and for preventing their admixture. From the quarters of Dharma he created alsothe goddess Saraswati called Niti. She directs the Dendalike punishment towards offenders and is therefore knownas Danda-niti".

 Now, let us look into the gist of the whole description.The different Yugas are said to take their names accordingto the amount of Denda-niti or justice enforced by the Raja.The Raja is independent of time, but time is entirely dependent on him. This directly contradicts the modern interpretations of Yugas even as Sthula time. That almost throughout the religious texts Sukshma time is dealt with as alreadyexplained here, is probably a new lesson to these interpreters. The Raja and Denda-niti are of course technical termshere used. The Denda and Niti are mentioned as creationsof Mahadeva. Have the Pandit, Critic or Theosophist anything to say against this quotation from the Maha-bharata,which undoubtedly puts them all to complete shame? Wehave already found that there is no human action in theKrita-yuga. If therefore Denda-niti means criminal justicein accordance with the modern interpretation, there is absolutely no relevancy in describing its complete enforcement.

in the Krita Yuga. Either Krita is not Krita, or Dendaniti is not criminal justice. These are then the two horns ofthe dilemma, in which the self-made authorities and Critics have inevitably landed themselves. The pretended knowledge and the assumed competency to interpret or criticise,could not be possibly concealed, when unexpectedly theproper time arrives for their naked exposure.

**कृष्णं वपुर्वहतु चुम्बतुसत्फलानि  
रम्येषु संवसतु चूतवनान्तरेषु।  
पुंस्कोकिलस्य चरितानि करोतु कामम्  
काकः कलध्वनिविधौ स तु काक एव॥**

***Q. Nos. VII & VIII.***

 "The four quarters of Dharma are Gnana, Dhyana,Sama and Dema. Gnana is the knowledge of the Atman.Dhyana is the meditation of Atman. Sama is stability ofmind and Dema is control of the senses. When Dharmaincreases, longivity increases. Dharma in the form of a bull,with its sound four legs roams about protecting the Lokas-Adoration to that holy form ! The four limbs of Dharmaare the perfect states of truth, kindness, peace of mind andharmlessness. The attainment of an atom of such Dharmasaves us from the greatest fears, exactly as addiction to alittle of Adharma is productive of much fear".

 The four quarters of Dharma are here stated to be thestandards by which the Yugas are determined and they areexplained as consisting of Dyana, Gnana, Sama and Dema.Dharma is generally described as a Vrisha or bull. Vrishaitself means Dharma in the Sanskrit language. Pada inthe same way means one fourth as well as a foot or leg inSanskrit and in the Indian vernaculars. The Pundit feelshighly elated at the opportunities here offered in the description of Dharma. He would have his Dharma in the form

of an actual bull the biggest and fairest obtainable in Indiaand would like to establish that, that is the correct and onlymeaning for the Puranic description. In the same way, hemust establish that the Yugas have their distinguishingfeatures in some concrete form and that they should be confined within the boundaries of India. Time as ordinarilyunderstood by human beings is an abstract idea whichcannot be dealt with as the Pandit handles it. It isclearly stated here that the names of Yugas signify thenature of the work done by the pious and the religious inin the field of Dharma, and the Pandit simply exhibits hisperverse obstinacy and lamentable ignorance in his interpretation of the subject. Gnana, Dhyana, Sama, Dema,truthfulness, control of the senses &c. are not certainly thequalities of time. He is however most anxious to establishthat the venerable authors of the sacred texts are not muchwiser than the wise-acres of his type.

**वीणेवश्रोत्रहीनस्य लोलाक्षीव विचक्षुषः।  
व्यसोःकुसुममालेव विद्यास्तब्धस्य निष्फला॥**

** 4.** The words Yuga and Yoga are almost synonymous. To couple, to unite, or join the Jivathma with theParamatma, the lower self with the higher self is the ideapervading all these descriptions. The degrees of perfectionattained in this direction are explained with reference to thedefinite processes prescribed for the purpose. The KritaYuga expresses the stage of completion as the word Kritaclearly denotes. The appellations Kali, Thishya, Kashayaand Thamasa for the last Yuga are equally significant of theentire absence of religious merit. It is called the currentYuga as the instructions in the texts are naturally supposedto be always addressed to the ignorant and irreligious populace in general and are meant for their benefit. The following passages already quoted in Chaper I specifying the first

day of Kali as the date on which Sri Krishna quitted theearth, are indicative also of the loss of belief even in thetheory of the existence of a God consequent on therampantmaterialism prevailing all over the world, apart from theirtechnicalreference.

**यस्मिन्नहनि यर्ह्येव भगवानुत्ससर्जगाम्।  
तदैवेहानुवृत्तो सावधर्मप्रभवः कलिः॥**

**श्रीभागवतम्।**

**यस्मिन् दिने हरिर्यातो दिवं सन्त्यज्य मेदिनीम्।  
तस्मिन्नेवावतीर्णोयं कालकायो बली कलिः॥**

**विष्णुपुराणम्॥**

The main points of distinction in the four Yugas lie in theamount of Dharma prevailing, none being found in Kali.There is no 'Yogakshema' or prosperity for Yoga nor Yogaitself in Kali. It stands aloof from the rest as the worst inthe list and lowest in the scale of religious advancement.Half the quantity of Dharma prevails in Dwapara Yugaand three-fourths in Treta Yugs, as the words Dwapara andTreta themselves signify. Quotation VII clearly enumeratesthe four parts of Dharma as consisting of Gnana, Dhyana,Sama and Dema. Quotation VI, explains that the reckoning of the Yugas entirely depends upon the proportionateenforcement of criminal justice, Denda-niti. In fact thehistory of the Raja is said to be the specification of the Yuga.This is the Puranic method of description. The Raja, as  
stated in the preceding pages, is the Atma or self seated inthe car or body. The horses are the senses, mind the reinsand intellect the charioteer.

**आत्मानं रथिनं विद्धि शरीरं रथमेव तु।  
इन्द्रियाणि हयान्याहुः मनः प्रग्रहमवे च।  
बुद्धिन्तु सारथिं विद्यात्॥**

The Danda-niti or criminal justice requires some explanation. It refers to the Yogic process prescribed for annihilating the external Vasanas. The Danda is the spinal cord with its plexes for meditation, as we have already noticed.

 The most important item in the description determiningthe characteristic differences of the Yugas is the duration oftime detailed for each of them. A careful examination ofthe formulas and a correct calculation in accordance withthem, will, 1 confidently hope easily convince every readerthat the gist of the whole matter is far removed from thecommon interpretations as well as from those attempted bythe help of modern material sciences. The Sukshma andSthula classifications of time should be distinctly kept in the calculation, the former technically applying to the experiences and attainments of the Yogic processes and the latter tothe ordinary reckoning of days, months and years. In therendering of the Sukshma into the Sthula the formulas aregiven in the passages already quoted.

**श्वासैस्तु त्रुटिभिः प्राणो घटिका प्राणषड्ककै।  
अहोरात्रं ततः षष्टि घटिकादिर्विशेषतः॥**

Three breaths make one Prana and six Pranas make oneSukshma Ghatika. Further calculations go by the samenumbers both for Sukshma and Sthula. 60 Sthula-Ghatikasmake 1 Sthula day; similarly 60 Suksma Ghatikas make1 Sukshma day. Again,

**पिङ्गलायाःइडायान्तु प्राणसंक्रमणं मुने।  
तदुत्तरायणं प्रोक्तं मुने वेदान्तवेदिभिः।  
इडायाः पिङ्गलायान्तु प्राणसंक्रमणं मुने।  
दक्षिणायनमित्युक्तं पिङ्गलायामिति श्रुतिः॥**

The passing of breath from right to left, that is inhalingthrough the right nostril and exhaling through the left is

technically known amongst Yogis as Uttarayana, and viceversa as Dekshinayana, both of them together making aSukshma year.

**Further,**

**प्राणापानवशो जीवो ह्यधश्चोर्ध्वं प्रधावति।  
वामदक्षिणमार्गेण चञ्चलत्वान्नदृश्यते।  
हकारेण बहिर्याति सकारेण विशेत् पुनः।  
हंस हंसेत्यमुं मन्त्रं जीवो जपति सर्वदा।  
शतानि षट् दिवारात्रं सहस्राण्येकविंशतिः।  
एतत्संख्यान्वितं मन्त्रं जीवो जपति सर्वदा।  
अजपा नाम गायत्री योगिनां मोक्षदा सदा।  
अस्याः सङ्कल्पमात्रेण नरः पापैः प्रमुच्यते॥**

**ध्यानबिन्दूपनिषत्॥**

 Breath passes alternately through the right and left nostrils,through the force of Prana and Apana, and it repeats theprocess 21,600 times in a day. Meditation on this byYogis is Known as Ajapa-Mantra which is very efficaciousfor the destruction of sins. Taking the three above passages together, the question regarding the length of periodgiven for Kali Kuga namely; 1, 200 Divine years including200 years of Sandhi or 4,32,000 hunan years, may be easilyworked out.

3 x 6 = 18 Swasas make 1 Sukshma Ghatika.  
18 × 60 = 1030 Swasas make 1 Sukshma day.

 A Sthula day consists of 21600 Swasas probably calculatedfrom the normal condition observed in sleep. At othertimes, although respiration is an involuntary action itsnatural speed and duration will be constantly altered bychanges of external as well as internal conditions. Theproportion for conversion of a Sukshma day, month or yearinto a Sthula day, month or year is therefore 21600 ÷ 1080 = 20.

that is 1 to 20, is the proportion. Uttarayana and Dekshinayana together is one year and is tantamount to 1 Swasa,which is made up of both. The year here is Sukshma andit is therefore 20 Sthula years. 21,600 Swasas thereforemake up 432,000 Sthula years, which is exactly the numbergiven for the duration of Kali Yuga. We thus clearly seethat the purport of the whole affair is the Yogic account ofa single day of man. The doubling, trebling and quadrupling of this period for Dwapara, Treta and Krita Yugas,are consequent on the regulation of breaths by the processesprescribed in the Yoga-sastras with which we are not directly concerned at present. For instance, to obtain the numberof years given for Dwapara namely 864,000; a single Sthuladay whose account is practically the gist of the matter,being always a constant factor, the proportion in the rendering of the Sukshma to the Sthula, will have to be doubledby a corresponding reduction in the number of Swasas or breaths making up a Sukshma Ghatika. Instead of 18Swasas comprising a Sukshina Ghatika they should be reducedto 9, then the proportion will be*21,600*= 40.9 × 60 TheSthula years per day's account, will then amount to 21,600 x 40= 864,000. Similarly, the necessary reduction of Swasas byYogic processes will give the figures for Treta and KritaYuagas. We thus clearly see that the figures given in thetexts are mathematically exact and not approximations, orexaggerations or even poetical fancies. It is however sufficient for our present purpose to know what a Yuga means,at least what it does not mean. The mere knowledge of itwill remove a good deal of misconception and further consequent errors, created by the ignorant people as well as bythe so-called scientific expositors like the Theosophists. We

have already seen how the latter are completely ignorant ofthe true significance of the geographical descriptions.Equally ignorant are they with regard to the question of timespecified. Their calling to aid geological discoveries in theelucidation of our sacred literature is more a mockery thananything else. Madam Blavadski's explanation in her"Secret Doctrines", of the duration of Dwapara Yuga namely864,000 years, as nearly approaching the earliest date discovered by modern Geology, is perhaps accepted by herdisciples and some others as a eulogistic observation in favorof Hindu Religion. What then about the duration of theTreta and Krita Yugas? We have perhaps to wait untilanother Geological discovery is available. What if the durations given for each of the four Yugas are pronounced to bediscovered immediately by Geology or any other materialsciences? The Yugas mentioned in our religious texts applyonly to Bharata Varsha (vide Q. 2) and not to the Theosophical India nor to any other locality outside the same onthe surface of this earthy sphere. Taking even the Theosophical interpretation (which is but a borrowing in toto fromthe local Pandits) of Bharata varsha as representing India,and the Yugas as referring to the ordinary calculation oftime, it must logically lead to the ridiculous but unavoidable  
conclusion, that there is no 'Time' in America and perhapsno 'space' in Europe, both being outside Bharata-varsha. Itis high time that those who are really interested in our hoaryand sacred religion either religiously or even scientifically,should soon get over this deplorable ignorance and open theireyes. It is indeed a shame that we should have deterioratedto this depth to allow ourselves to be treated in this childishfashion both by our ignorant Pandits and the misleadingforeigners. It is certainly too late in these boasted days ofcivilization to console ourselves by excuses like want of time

or means, when side by side with us, the enlightened foreigners seek useful and valuable information in the interest ofscience from all corners of the world at the cost of immensewealth and convenience and even at the risk of personal life.It is utterly useless to be simply proud of our ancient civilization and religious supremacy.Standing still in the daysof progress, is positive retrogression and there is not theslightest doubt that we have fallen down thousands ofdegrees in our religious sphere.

 **5.** The Manus and Manwantaras are matters ofvital importance in our Religion. They refer to certain definitePsychological and Physiological principles advantageouslyutilized in the religious practices prescribed. The subject isparticularly technical and perhaps peculiar to the Hindureligion. The facts expressed by the enumeration of the 14 Manus and of the durations of time intervening betweeneach of them are closely connected with the description ofthe Yugas and deal with scientific and technical matters, adetailed description of which is not possible to be attemptedhere. References will however have to be made occasionallywhere the necessary and available informations may be furnished. Regulation of breath called Prana-yama is the chiefprocess prescribed for Yoga. But it has to be supplementedby meditation accompanied by Manthras to make it effective.

**मरुदभ्यसनं सर्वे मनोयुक्तं समभ्यसेत्॥**

A scientific treatment of the physiology of sound styledSiksha is well-known to every student of Sanskrit Grammar,as forming an important portion of the subject. But it has

seldom been studied as a practical science, nor its specialapplication to the religious literature carefully noticed.Siksha has already been explained in Chapter II as one ofthe six Vedangas. It is thus one of the necessary items tobe first understood in the correct elucidation of religiousfacts and formulas. The natural relation or associationbetween thought and sound or language, the fact of theirinseparable coexistence and the consequent effects of theirmutual actions are all minutely and scientifically treated and,practically utilized for the practice of Yoga and religiousdevotion.

 A science like the physiology of sound may perhapssound strange to a modern scientist, but nevertheless it isone of the oldest one known to our ancients and its possibility itself cannot be deniedwithout a proper enquiry. TheManthras are all composed in strict adherance to the principlesof this science. They are not valued for their meaning asgenerally supposed. The various Sahasranamas or thousandnames in praise of Vishnu or other Gods are not all of themrecognised as fit to be repeated as Manthras. Besides, thereare several single letters which ordinarily convey no meaning except a peculiar sound and do not permit of translationin any language but are particularly recognised as Manthraslike Hrim, Klim &c. Thus, the idea of translating theManthras in any language is a useless and unscientific task in as much as they lose their significance and effects even in aparaphrase in the Sanskrit language itself. It is but awell-known fact, that every poetical composition in anylanguage is not necessarily suited to be sung in every tunein music, unless the laws of composition for such purposesare strictly adhered to.

 The word Manu ordinarily means mental faculty orthought as well as a Manthra. No great change is made

from this common interpretation, in its application in thetexts. But it is used in a somewhat restricted sense according to the requirements of the technical subject. The following quotations are subjoined with the hope of corroboratingthe interpretation here given, and I dare say it would beprofitless to criticise it as new or farfetched, without readingthe passages quoted, or to condemn them all, as unauthenticinterpolations. The texts containing these passages aresufficiently recognised as genuine for our present purposeand the passages themselves have not yet been marked outby modern critics and proclaimed as interpolations. Theonly probability is that they have not been properly noticedor understood in a searching or sympathetic spirit.

*  **Quotation. No. I.***

 "The practice of Yoga should be accompanied by a Manthra or utterance of a vowel sound, also by the meditation of the Bramhan beyond the reach of sound, and identifying it with the self''.

 Three concomitant factors are here specified, the regulation of breath, utterance of a Manthra and meditation. The vowel sound in the Manthra is meant for the purpose of concentrating the flow of mind towards sound, name or Nama. The meditations prescribed are for the purpose of concentrating the mental flow towards objectivity, Rupa. According to our philosophy the whole cosmology of man consists only of nama and rupa.

*** Q. No. II.***

 "The mind is set up by the intellect to express the name of an object hit upon by the intellect, which in itself is worked up by Atma. The Agni, fire or life principle in the body sets up the breath in motion, being itself acted upon by mind. A deep sound or low tone called Mandra, is then produced by the agitation of breath in the chest. The Anuswara M and Visarga ha &c., are not completely independent sounds. The accent known as Anudatta is produced in the heart, Udatha in the head, Swarita under the ear and Prachaya in the whole face".

 This gives the fundamental physiological principles of producing sounds by man. The accents refer to the directions of sound. We will see as we proceed with the quotations, how these principles are utilized for the formation of Manthras.

 ***Q. No. III.***

 "Every sound or Nama refers to some object and every object is known by some sound or name. If the significance of a stipulated sound or Nama is known, a small sound could be found to apply to a large area of objectivity. The name and its object are the modifications of Prakriti which is the glory of Siva and his consort. The glory alluding to sound or Nama is of three varieties, namely, the Sthula which is

audible, the Sukshma which is only mentally known and the Para which is beyond the cognisance of mind".

 The coexistence of Nama and Rupa, sound and its object, is here explained, also the three states in which a sound could exist.

 ***Q. No. IV.***

 "The name Manu and the characteristic of Manu, are mentioned in the texts with some object, and they refer to Vishnu in some form".

 The origin of Manu as well as the significance of the name are already beginning to differ from the Pandit's conceptions and he must be prepared to hear stranger things soon about the Manus, which will make him sick to think of our sacred literature.

* **Q. No. V.***

 "Samgna, Rajni, Prabha and Chaya are the four wives of Surya or the sun. Manu,in whose family all the kings and rulers originated, is the son of Surya by Samgna".

 Here Samgna clearly means the intellect, and the names of the other three wives are equally significant. Surya or sun represents the Atma. These terms shall be explained more fully in the next section on Personality. In the meantime, it is enough to note that the Pandit's literal interpretation of Manu being the son of the sun, would naturally render the origin of the so-called earthly rulers here specified, unintelligible to ordinary human beings. It would be very uncharitable on his part to expect the rest of mankind to he furnished with unhinged brains like himself and his illustrious colleagues.

 ***Q. No. VI.***

 "The first six Manus, namely, Swayombhuva, Swarochisha, Uttama, Tamasa, Ryvata and Chakshusha have

passed over. The seventh and the present Manu is Vyvaswata, the son of the sun. In the first Dwapara-yuga of thisManwantara, the first Manu, Swayambhuva himself held the post of Vyasa. In the twenty-fifth Dwapara, Krishnadwypayana, son of Parasara, became Vyasa. The future seven Manus are Savaranas or of the same caste of Vyvaswata, named, Savarna, Deksha-Savarna, Bramha-Savarna-Dharma, Rudra-Savarna, Rowchya and Bhowtya".

 These fourteen Manus will be explained in the subsequent quotations. But it is believed that the Pandit and Critic have no more explanations to offer here than a mere paraphrase in some indistinct style. The text however is simple enough to understand the language, and does not demand the help of the Pandit on that score. But the Pandit is of course quite indifferent to the purport of its contents, and it would certainly be an infringement upon his established rights to worry him with questions on such silly matters.

 ***Q No. VII.***

 "The future should be ascertained from the past. and both from the present. The Manwantaras should be determined by this method. The basis for Manwantaras consists of the Sapta-rishis, Devas, Pitris and Manus and in their midst are the Prajas. The Rishis, Devas, Pitris and Manus ascend and descend accompanied by Manthras. They are destroyed at the end of a Manwantara and created at the end of the destruction. The Devas are the sons of Rishis and Pitris the sons of Devas. That the Rishis themselves are the sons of Devas, is settled in the Sastras. The four Manus named Swarochisha, Uttama, Thamasa and Ryvata belong to the family of Priyavrata. The Manwantaras of Chakshusha the sixth and Vyvaswata the seventh Manus are declining.

From their time, creation is by union. The previous creations are by thought, sight and touch".

 The quotations are surely becoming more and more vexatious. This gives the best opportunity for all the different varieties of modern interpreters to join together dropping their individual opinions, and to march out clearing the field altogether. None of them could find definite points for the exercise of their ingenuity here. There is no exaggeration, no poetical fancy. Everything here is irrelevant and incoherent as long as the subject is not studied.Every line in the quotation must be confessed as unintelligible to the modern learned interpreters. The Devas are said to be the sons of Rishis and Rishis the sons of Devas This paradox is not even allowed to be questioned. The Sastras have so settled. Could the Pandit or Critic tell us what the description means? The Rishis, Devas, Pitris and Manus ascend and descend with Manthras, in the Manwantaras. Will the Pandit enlighten us with some vague idea at least of all these statements? Creation in the previous Manwantaras is said to have been conducted by thought, sight and touch. Does the local Pandit at least understand the process? Modern creation is said to be by union. Here of course all the modern interpreters are in their own atmosphere. This is the only portion in the quotation they approve of as correct and clearly intelligible. They are so happy to find after all, the very thing sought for in these texts all this time. And these are our modern religious authorities.

**कतिचिदुद्धतनिर्भरमत्सराः कतिचिदात्मवचः स्तुतिशालिनः।  
अहहकेऽपि निरक्षरकुक्षयस्तदिह सम्प्रति कम्प्रति मे श्रमः॥**

*  **Q. No. VIII.***

 "The woman named Sata-rupa, or of hundred forms, is known as Savitri the wife of Bramha, she is the mother of

the seven Rishis named Pulastya and others, of Deksha and other Prejapatis and of Swayambhuva and other Manus".

 Here, we have the parentage of the Rishis, Manus and Prajapathis traced to Bramha and Savitri.Gayatri or Savitri clearly represents the famous Manthra well-known to the Hindus. Our venerable Pandit well-versed in the sacred Manthras can now clearly understand that the fourteen Manus born of Savitri reigned in Oudh and Delhi in olden days with all the pomp and splendour of an Emperor. He knows Manthras producing kingdoms and rulers of. kingdoms in India. It is indeed a pity, he yet knows no Manthra which will furnish him with common sense. He could ere this have easily found out by a little thought in his sober moments, that for the said purpose, this very Gayatri is prescribed in our ancient religion.

**गायकं त्रायते यस्मात् गायत्रीत्युच्यते हि सा॥**

 ***Q. No. IX.***

 "In the science called Siksha, the vowels are treated as more important than the consonants. The consonants are like gems strung in the thread of vowels. The vowels overpower the consonants like a powerful monarch appropriating the kingdom of a weak monarch".

 The use of this quotation will soon be explained.

* **Q. No. X.***

 "The Bramhan has three kinds of body, namely, Sthula, Sukshma and Para.The Virat is Sthula known as Pancha-Brahman. Hiranyagarbha is Sukshma, called Nada or sound made of three Bija letters.Para is the unknowable Parom-Bramhan, whose attributes are, Sat, Chit, Ananda and Satya. The eternal Nada is known as Sabda-Bramhan. From the Sakti residing in the Muladhar in the form of Bindu, a Sukshma sound originates, known as Pasyanti, by

which the Yogis see everything. The same sound passing to the heart makes a thundering noise, and it is known as Madhyama. When this is combined with the vowels known as Prana, it is called Vykhari. It then expresses itself as the various letters of the alphabet, from A to Ksha. From these letters, words are produced; from words sentences originate. All Manthras are made of sentences, also the Vedas, Sastras, Puranas,languages, musical compositions &c. The force of breath slowly acting upon the life principle, produces this Vykhari sound. This Sakti or power residing in the heart of all is called Saraswati. When the Yogi perceives her in his Atma, he obtains the power of producing Vedas, Sastras and Puranas of his own accord".

 This quotation explains the highest imaginable form of Bramhan and the corresponding idea of the purest sound by which it may be named. This is an important matter in our religious literature, without a clear knowledge of which there would be endless confusion in the interpretation of the texts. Three forms are here postulated for the formless Bramhan known as Virat, Hiranyagarbha and Parom. The Parom is entirely formless and represents the true condition. The Virat or Sthula philosophically understood consists of name and form alone, that is Nama and Rupa. Hiranya-garbha is described as the Sukshma form, practically meaning the mere meditation of the Bramhan without a form. It represents the purest idea of Bramhan the human intellect is capable of grasping. Having virtually eliminated all possible forms in this grand conception of Bramhan, its name or Nama alone now remains. An appropriate name has now to be given to this most abstract idea. The very first and simplest sound uttered by man can alone properly apply to this conception of Sukshma-Bramhan. In fact, such a name or sound is explained here as its only characteristic mark and hence it is named Sabda-Bramhan.

**हिरण्यगर्भं सूक्ष्मन्तुनादं बीजत्रयात्मकम्।  
अक्षरं परमोनादःशब्दब्रह्मेति कथ्यते॥**

We have just seen in quotation No. 2 that the very first and the purest sound produced in the human system is known as Mandra and this very sound is certainly the fittest nomenclature for the Bramhan under reference.

**मारुतस्तूरसिचरन् मन्द्रं जनयतिस्वरम्॥**

The subject will be explained more fully later on. If the Pandit has eyes and the willingness to use them, he could observe here that Bramha or Hiranyagarbha described as the father of the Rishis, Manus, Devas and Pitris has no form and that he is known as Sabda-Bramhan. His children specified here could therefore naturally possess no forms and they should represent some further evolutions of Bramha in the sphere of sounds or Namas constituting the essential ingredients of the religious and sacred Manthras. If the Pandit is prepared to digest these facts with repenting tears, he is likely to find ere long, that the hitherto unintelligible passages overflow with serious and important religious instructions.

**पुस्तकेषु च नाधीतं नाधीतं गुरुसन्निधौ।  
न शोभन्ते सभामध्ये हंसमध्ये बको यथा॥**

*** Q. No. XI.***

 "Vishnu created Virat and he created Purusha called Manu to whom Manwantara belongs. Manu is the second stage from Manasa, known as Manwantara. Manu created the Prejas and in the creation by Vishnu, no one is born from the womb of the mother. Deksha and other kings appear periodically in the Yugas and disappear in the same manner. There is no difference observed among themselves as elders or youngsters. Their positions depend upon the

amount of Tapas acquired. No wise man is therefore puzzled at their appearance or disappearance".

 The origin of Manus is here stated as the second stage from Manasa. The Manu is also mentioned as the production of Virat. We have already found that Manasa represents the twenty-fifth Tatwom. It is therefore certain that the term Manu also refers to one of the lower Tatwoms. The general standard by which the importance of Deksha and other periodical kings should be judged, is also said to be, the quantity of Tapas specified. As usual, the Pandit has absolutely nothing to enlighten us here. We may therefore very well proceed without waiting for his help. It would be a great boon if he only refrains from throwing filth on our way.

***Q. No. XII.***

 "Bramha created Virat. From the Manasa, Vyraja known as Samraud originated, called Manu.The first Purusha named Swayambhuva, is known as Manu.This Manu created the Prajas. A daughter named Sata-rupa, two sons named Priyavrata and Uttanapada and again two daughters named Akuti and Presuti were born from him. He gave Presuti in marriage to Deksha. Here Deksharepresents Prana and Manu represents Samkalpa. Bramha desirous of creating Prajas meditated sorrowfully. Immediately Kumara of divine scent originated, uttering the divine Sruti, unknowable by the senses. The Veda then originated from Om. From its 14 faces,14 vowels originated also 33 consonants. Then from these vowels 14 Manus originated constituting the divine vowels of the Manwantaras. The first vowel A originated from the first of the 14 faces and is named Swayambhuva Manu. Similarly from the remaining 13 faces, 13 vowels originated with the names of the remaining Manus. They are of white, red, black and other varieties

of colours. In this manner, the vowels, consonants and Manus originated. Thevowels in themselves being of the same caste or family, the Anwaya or Vamsa of the Manus is thereby signified".

 A good deal of technicalities is here clearly explained. The significance of Manu and Deksha-Prejapati is pointed out in the plainest terms.

**प्राणो दक्षस्तु विज्ञेयः सङ्कल्पो मनुरुच्यते॥**

Deksha represents Prana or the Life Principle and Manu denotes Samkalpa, mental resolution or determination. The Pandit need not here shed his false tears for the deaths of his anthropological Manus and Dekshas. He has never loved or respected ther, and even when he comes to know that they are still alive, he is not going to be faithful to them.The 14 Manus are said to allude to the 14 vowel sounds originating from Bramha's 14 faces. The vowels being of the same family, the idea is expressed as the Manu's family or Vamsanucharita in the Puranas.

**परस्परसवर्णाश्च स्वरायस्माद्वृता हि वै।  
तस्मात्तेषां स वर्णत्वादन्वयस्तु प्रकीर्तितः॥**

The Manwantara noticed in the previous quotation similarly refers to the continuity of the vowel sounds specified.

**द्वितीयं मानसस्यैतन्मनोरन्तरमुच्यते॥**

Concerning these two terms, namely, Manwantara and Vamsanu-charita, used in the Puranas and Itihasas, we can now easily perceive the extreme absurdity in the modern interpretation as referring to, the Geological periods of this mother-earth or the historical periods of its inhabitants. The significance of the 14 vowel sounds said to be produced from the faces of Bramha shall soon be understood by going

through the succeeding quotations. The modern interpreters in general are likely to be excited at the sight of these strange quotations. But could they with a vengeance condemn the whole as later interpolations? If so, will they kindly condescend to tell us for what purpose they were interpolated, when and by whom? They will certainly be compelled to lay the blame on the indigenous Pandit but his complete innocence in this matter could be easily proved by his own ignorance of the passages. No foreigner or stranger to the Sanskrit language could be pitched upon either. The theory of supposed interpolation therefore is but a frivolous attack upon the sacred literature and does not deserve to be noticed. Its frequent application however, naturally creates a strong suspicion against its motive and propriety. Those who claim to be recognised as civilized,ought to be more careful in the use of this weak but shameful weapon, in future.

 ***Q. No. XIII.***

 "From Siva, the ultimate and pure intelligence, an unbroken perpetual sound of great. brightness has naturally emanated with the Sakti. That very sound shines brightly in the Muladhar all creatures. It then passes through the Bramha-nadi to the heart and becomes distinct as Sukshma. The same unbroken sound reaches the Bramharendra or brain, the brightest and blissful seat of Siva, and becomes tranquil by His proximity. In the Adhara, the seat of Sakti, the sound represents a single happy letter.In the centre above Aagna, the single letter becomes Sukshma. In the third centre called Pooraka two letters become one.This is the first natural and well-known Manthra. It is called a Manthra because it saves one meditating upon it. The goddess of letters has therefore naturally originated from this first Manthra. The direction of one letter here is

upwards and of the other is downwards. This first Manthra is therefore the significant word denoting the ever brilliant Siva and is the greatest Manu or Manthra. Thus the Apada or inexpressible becomes Pada or expressible and the latter again merges in the former. To know this is great knowledge. He who grasps the Pada obtains control over the Manthras and nothing is unattainable for him. For the benefit of mankind a portion of this Pada divides itself into 16, 5, 2, 32, or 33 &c. The Goddess of letters has three aspects, the Sthula, Sukshma and Susukshma being the development from the Sakti itself. Every Manthra should be uttered with a knowledge of this dignity of it. Pranava is of two sorts, the Para and Apara. The Para is the Para-Bramhan itself and is called Pranava being ever new. The Apara is in the form of the purest sound and is also called Pranava, because it serves as the medium for attaining the Para-Bramhan. The letter Om represents the totality of everything in the Universe, without the individual names of objects, and it therefore denotes Bramha".

 The religious technicalities of the varieties of sounds constituting the holy Manthras, as well as the philosophical and physiological origins of such sounds, are detailed in this quotation. We cannot here afford to go into the details of the Manthra-Sastra which is a great science in itself. It would be enough to note here, that the Manus undoubtedly allude to such Manthras, and that their apparent history deals with the actual explanation of their varieties and stages prescribed for devotional progress, accompanied by meditation upon the glories of God specified by their corresponding Manthras. We might also notice in this connection, especially for the purpose of satisfying the curiosity of our readers, that the creation by union mentioned in quotation 7 refers to the joining of single sounds or letters to consti-

tute Manthras. It never denotes the process of animal creation as absurdly and shamelessly explained by the modern interpreters. The mutual parentage of the Rishis, Devas and Pitris, paradoxically described in the same quotation, will shortly be explained in the next section on Personalities,exposing the complete ignorance of our existing religious authorities.

***Q. No. XIV.***

 "There are 51 letters in all from. A to Ksha, by which the Manthras are composed, which allude to the forms and Tatwas prescribed for religious meditation. From Sivatatwa Bindu originates. From Bindu, Nada originates at the end of which Sakti originates. From Sakti, Sabda; from Sabda, Vakbhava; from it Kala and from which again Vikala originates. With these, Manthras are composed. This is the process of evolution or creation, whose characteristics shall here be explained. Bindu is Para-Sakti and Nada is Adi-Sakti. Sakti is Icha or desire to create, and Sabda is Gnana.Vakbhava means Kriya-Sakti and Kala represents the 16 vowels. The terms Icha, Vidya, Gnana, Pratishta, Nivriti and Kriya are synonymous. Seven vowels are known as Prakriti and nine as Vikriti. Kala, Matra, Swara, Jiva, Prakriti, Vikriti, Prana, Atma and Dehi are synonymous terms alluding to the vowels. The consonants constitute the Bindu and are known by thesynonymous terms, Deha, Upadhi, Sarira, Kshetra, Adhara, Tanu and Vikala. The first 3 vowels denote Akasa; the next 3, air; the next 4, fire; the next 3, water and the last 3, earth. Prakriti represents the Tatwa-bija or the essential letter, and Vikriti denotes the form. Vikala refers to Prabhava, power or efficacy. Prakriti is short and of one Matra, Vikriti is long and of two Matras, and consonant is of half Matra. Kala is the life and Vikala is the body. The

Sthula sound is called Sabda, the Sukshma is mental and Parom is beyond it. The meditation that saves one from worldly miseries is called a Manthra. Siva presents himself before us by the application of a proper Manthra, like one addressed courteously by his proper name. Pranava is the life of all Manthras and is the letter representing Siva among all other letters. The form of Pranava is constituted in accordance with the formulas relating to Bindu and Nada".

 This quotation itself furnishes more details than would be consistent with the scope of this essay. Those who are really interested in this special branch of religious science, could easilyobtain plenty of technical treatises on the subject. For our main purpose here, we have only to understand and remember one or two important facts explained in the quotation. The Manthras are said to be composed of vowels and consonants, the vowels being called Kalas divided into Prakritis and Vikritis, and the consonants being known as Vikalas. Viewed as a mere grammatical classification, the description conveys no meaning, as all the languages in the world are formed by the combinations of vowels and consonants. There must therefore be a technical difference maintained in all such religious matters, the modern ignorance of which naturally gives rise to unpleasant and unnecessary criticisms. First of all a Manthra is distinguished from a verbal expression of an ordinary idea, by its peculiar aptitude for saving a man from worldly miseries by his meditation upon the Tatwa alluded to in the Manthra.

**मननघ्राणधर्मित्वान्मन्त्रमित्यभिधीयते॥**

Secondly, the vowels and consonants used in the composition of a Manthra are called Kalas and Vikalas, only on account of their situation within the Manthra. The terms

Kriya-Sakti, Icha-Sakti, Vidya, Gnana and Pratishta are mentioned in the quotation as synonymous with Nivriti or involutionary process. The letters therefore that go to  
form a Manthra which takes us back to the creator, are alone given the name specified here, namely, Kala, Prakriti, Vikriti and Vikala. The same letters used in any language, for the purpose of communicating common ideas or for expressing abuses, cannot therefore be called by the names here given.

**निवृत्तिस्यात् क्रियाशक्तिः तस्याः पर्यायवाचकाः॥**

There is after all, nothing very strange in the conception of this simple principle, as everything in this world could be used both for good and evil purposes. Another important point to be noticed here, is the formation of the syllable Om called Pranava. It is not the stipulation of any meaningless sound uttered by the ancient Rishis at random. It is clearly stated to be specially composed, conforming to the  
principles relating to Nada and Bindu.

**बिन्दुनादप्रकारेण प्रणवाकृतिरीरिता॥**

It is earnestly hoped that the foregoing general explanations pertaining to the Manus and Manwantaras, will suffice for our respectable readers to form some definite idea of the subject as a whole. It is also anxiously feared that any more of similar explanations might not prove effectual in cowing down the presumptuous Pandit.

**गले पाशस्तीव्रश्चरणयुगले गाढः निगटो  
दृढं स्कन्धे बद्धः शिरसि सृणिपातः खरतरः।  
नरः स्कन्धारूढो बत रमणयोग्येऽपि विषये  
न जानीमोऽत्यर्थं द्विरद वद कस्मात्तव मदः॥**

 ***Q No. XV.***

 "The syllable Om referring to Bramhan viewed aggregately and as made up of individual bodies, is called Sam-

hara and Srishti. Pranavas respectively. It is also distinguished as internal, external or both, as half-matra Pranava or Samhara Pranava and Srishti-Pranava. The internal or Anta-pranava is divided into eight parts, namely, A, U, M, half-matra, Nada, Bindu, Kala and Sakti. The A has ten thousand parts; U, one thousand; M, one hundred, and half-matra, endless parts. Saguna is Virat-pranava; Nirguna is Samhara-pranava, both combined is Utpathi-pranava. The Samhara-pranava is beyond the thirty-six Tatwas and consists of 16 Matras, namely, A,U,M, half matra, Nada, Bindu, Kala, Kalatita, Santi, Santyatita, Unmani, Manonmani, Puri, Madhyama, Pasyanti and Para. Again, the Pranava splits itself into Purusha and Prakriti consisting of 64 Matras and takes the form of Saguna-nirguna consisting of 28 Matras. In this manner, the single Brahma-pranava takes different forms and it is the real basis for everything in the Universe".

 This quotation also is technical enough to be completely Greek to the Pandit and the Critic. The next quotation will be more explanatory, and it may be stated here that the details given in these passages will have to be referred to in future, for explaining many of the passages unintelligible to the modern interpreters.

***Q. No. XVI.***

 "A short sound is of one Matra, long sound two Matras, protracted sound three Matras and a consonant is half-Matra. The smallest atom of time is named Leva. If a number of lotus leaves placed one above the other be pierced through by a sharp needle, the time taken for the needle to pass from one leaf to another is reckoned as a Leva, and it is the smallest unit of time above which is the Mahat unaffected by time and space. 256 Levas inake one Matra and the following is the measurement of the nine Nadas. A Bindu is 128 Levas;

Ardhachandra is 64; Rodhini, 32; Nada, 16; Nadanta, 8; Sakti, 4; Vyapika, 2; Samana, 1 and Unmana 1/2, Levas. The 6 lotuses are the Chakras.Tripura-sundari or the Goddess called Para is the creatress of the Sukshma sound. She shines there and is called Matrika. The desire to create Viswa originates in her and she is then called Pasyanti being made up of 8 Saktis known as Vama &c. Between the Sukshma and Sthula stages, she is called Madhyama, in which state the 9 Nadas specified above extend from Muladhar to Bramha-rendhra in their unmodified condition. In Sthula or audible state called Vykhari, the 9 Nadas develop themselves into the 9. sets of letters in the Alphabet, bėginning with A, Ka, Cha, Ta, Tha, Pa, Ya, Sa and La. The conjunction of the pure Siva and the pure Sakti here described for the origin of this creation detailed, should be understood as alluding to the work of the pure mind. The sounds A and Ha are Sukshma denoting the exposition of the brightness of Bramhan which is the real Ahom. The foremost of all sounds is A, and Ha is the last of the vowels, the former referring to Siva and the latter to its perception. Ha consists of double Bindu and combined with A refers to the totality of the 16 vowels and both the letters signify Sunya or nothingness".

 This quotation is equally technical and more explanatory than the former in its details.

Q. *No. XVII.***

 "I shall tell you the real character of a Manthra.The syllable Om or Pranava, made up of five parts,namely, A, U, M, Bindu and Nada, is the very starting point in the Veda and it is described as the real Manthra by the Vedas.Nada represents the total aggregate idea and the remaining four denote the individual separate ideas."

 The syllable Om is explained here as the real Manthra.

It is also said to contain within itself the total and individual conceptions of existence.

***Q. No. XVII.***

 "A Manthra particularly signifies, the religious Karma, its mode of performance and the specific image or the performer's conception of God."

 The devotee being saved by meditation, it is called a Manthra, and it is the verbal expression of the idea of God.

<MISSING_FIG href="../../../../../books_images/U-IMG-1698729857Screenshot(34"/>.png)The above quotations on the point at issue are no doubt somewhat tiresome, although the necessary explanations are not yet sufficiently complete. The subject is strictly technical and most important for the purpose ofcomprehen-ding the applicability of the Vedas and Manthras. The temptation therefore to give as full a treatment as possible is great not only on account of the amount of scientific informations imbedded therein, but more on account of the immensity of ignorance, indifference and perversity unfortunately evinced in modern days in its interpretation.

 The inseparable association of thought and word, object and its name being psychologically established, a detailed analysis of their origin and relation is scientifically treated in Siksha, specifying also the physiological locations of sound in the human body. The direct influence of words on thought is thus a scientific fact and not a matter of blind belief. must therefore be generally conceded that if any of the existing religions in the world would recognise the efficacy of prayer, the Manthras in themselves are not useless or superstitious. Taking a more scientific and philosophical view of the subject, the ultimate object to be attained, namely Brahman must logically have its corresponding word or name and this is known as Sabda-Brahman. Of course

it refers only to the highest stage below that of Para-Bramhan but leading to the same.

**शब्दब्रह्मणि निष्णातः परं ब्रह्माधिगच्छति॥**

The Manthras are therefore variously composed and classified so as to serve different purposes for advancement in religious merit and to suit the varying capacities and qualifications of man. It is thus clear that every Manthra is not fit to be adopted by everybody without discrimination, the oneprescribed for a Sanyasi is not suited to a family man. This simple fact in modern days is too often misunderstood and criticised as the product of Brahmanical pride consequent on the desire for superiority and exclusiveness. But those who are inclined to admit the efficacy of a Manthra in any manner cannot consistently deny the necessity of considering the fitness of the person who wishes to be benefited by the same. Otherwise, it is like the meddling with the contents of a Laboratory without a knowledge of the fundamental principles of the science. The effort is not only useless but may prove dangerous too. Bluntly ignoring the scientific facts like electricity or other forces will not help, if the apparatus and chemicals in the room are wrongly made use of. Obstinate and silly perversities of this kind are not very rare with regard to the subject in question and they deserve only to be pitied rather than condemned.

**'अनुशोचाम एवान्यान् न भ्रान्तैर्विवदामहे'॥**

<MISSING_FIG href="../../../../../books_images/U-IMG-1698733256Screenshot(35"/>.png)In this section, we have examined and sifted al most every term used in the texts appearing as descriptions of time, extending from Lava or the minutest portion to Parardhom and Parom the highest figures in the Arithmetical Notation, and have clearly found that none of them have any reference to the ordinary reckoning of time so as to lead us to the belief in their applicability to the periods of histori-

cal incidents as commonly interpreted amongst us. The historical, archeological or geological proofs nowadays offered to establish the irrelevancies and inconsistencies in the Puranic statements, go therefore only to show the ignorance of the contents of our religious literature on the part of their Critics, without meaning anything derogatory to the scientific importance of their professed subjects. No better value or importance shall either be reasonably attached to the misdirected attempts of our native Pandits and Theosophists to explain those facts in a favourable attitude, by ununderstandable and extraneous methods virtually hood winking the public and concealing their own ignorance. We are helplessly compelled to turn round to them and say 'Physician heal thyself'.

**  SECTION III.**

**ON PERSONALITY.**

 It is earnestly hoped that the sacred documents hitherto ransacked must have to a great extent, convinced every reasonable and unbiased reader, of the fact that in the matter of religious evolution as well as involution, detailed in the texts, the gods and other personalities more or less allude to the efficient cause or spiritual agencies, and that the holy centres and the so-called geographical specifications refer to the material causes in general. They are known

as the Nimitha and Upadana Karanas. In the first section of this Chapter, we have examined the technical terms connected with the latter, and the present section has to seek for the significance of terms used to denote the former. The second section on Time, we have just finished stands in the position of a connecting link between the two.

  In this section, a logical classification of Personalities shall be maintained in accordance with their respective importance, for the proper comprehension of the ideas conveyed by each of them.

 We have been noticing all through in this essay, that the ultimate entity is described in our philosophy, by two different names, in accordance with the kind of view taken of it, namely, Para and Apara Brahmans. The latter is known also as Sabda-Bramhan and Purana--Purusha referring to the possibility of its being described by philosophical methods in the Puranas and Itihasas. The former of course is the inconceivable infinite of self-experience or Swanubhuti, regarding which no oral explanations could be ventured, especially of a positive character. It is attained only by negation of all phenominal affairs, and no religion or philosophy can afford to deal with it directly except through the medium of this Sabda Bramhan, whose knowledge itself has to be obtained by the regular methods prescribed for the purpose of getting over worldly desires and other obstacles on the path to onward progress. By reaching the ultimate terminus of this Sabda-Bramhan, man is naturally transported to the highest region called Para-Bramhan, and that is the only way of securing it.

**शब्दब्रह्मणि निष्णातः परं ब्रह्माधिगच्छति॥**

 This intervening territory of Sabda-Bramhan, between God and man is the blissful region of refuge provided for the

emancipation of the fallen man. The strange and insolent effort of the so-called Vedantists of the modern day to ignore this fact by hypocritical pretensions, and their attempt to transcend the limits of Sabda-Bramhan by impossible feats display only their intellectual weakness and moral bankruptcy. Ethics and religion are two inconvenient bug-bears to them obstructing freedom of thought and action. They can afford to jump over these unnecessary restrictions with their superior intellects and establish their rights to go ahead of all ordinary laws and rules. This is one of the worst and most pernicious use of religion and philosophy in the interest of unbridled and detestable conduct. Vedanta as generally understood, denotes the end of the Vedas, that could be reached only by going through the Vedas and by acting up to their ordinancesAs used by its modern professors, Vedanta practically means the end or annihilation of the Vedas altogether. All distinctions of right and wrong, good and bad, east and west, day and night, high and low, are abolished as unphilosophical, for the convenience of beastly self-interest, and universal indifference is preached all over the land as signifying true Vedantism.

**ब्रह्मैवसत्यमखिलं न हि किञ्चिदस्ति

 <MISSING_FIG href="../../../../../books_images/U-IMG-1698736461Screenshot(37"/>.png)
Leaving the two Bramhans, namely Para and Apara, as the highest philosophical ideas, we might commence with our enquiry lower down, regarding the Tri-Murthis, the Bramha, Vishnu and Siva, the gods whose functions are so commonly known as creation, preservation and destruction.An examination of their real significance, as could be gathered from the texts direct is likely to prove

practically useful, especially as their relative superiority has constantly been a matter of serious dispute among the ordinary people, having been occasionally dragged for settlement to the courts of law. We may confine ourselves in the beginning to the original and general character of the functions assigned to the Triads, without going into the details of their subsequent transformations known as their respective incarnations. It is earnestly hoped that the following quotations will be of interest in this connection. Several of them are no doubt somewhat lengthy, but the vital importance of the subject prevents their curtailment or omission, in spite of their proving tiresome at times.

 Before translating these lengthy quotations gathered from various sacred texts, it may be desirable to know and remember that the descriptions touching on the same points detailed in each of them, are given under different circumstances and to differently qualified persons. The varieties of their treatment should not therefore be misunderstood as irrelevancies or contradictions on that account. On the

contrary, if the real purport of the instructions be kept in view, much skill could be easily discovered as having been displayed in explaining the same matter in various ways, without in the least slipping out of the mark. The most important and dangerous mistake to be avoided here is the prevailing idea that the dealings of Bramha, Vishnu and Siva detailed in the texts, allude to the worldly affairs of man and that their conceptions are therefore connected with the same. It must clearly be understood that they are explained as pertaining to the region of pure Satwic Maya, the religious sphere represented in the Sastras, and that therefore they have absolutely nothing to do with the worthless glories and pomp of man in this earthy sphere, technically described as the products of Avidya. (Vide Q. 14)

**ब्रह्मा विष्णुश्च रुद्रश्च विभक्ता अपि पण्डिताः।  
परमात्मविभागस्था न जीवव्यूहसंस्थिताः।  
अविद्योपाधिको जीवो न मायोपाधिकः खलु।

 Thus, the main subject here dealt with is so serious and the existing ignorance of its real nature is so great, that in the interest of its renovation, few of the quotations could possibly be omitted and no careless misinterpretations according to the mere fancy, whim, caprice or indifference, could here be tolerated. The only qualifications demanded for the correct understanding of the whole, are earnestness, sympathy and more especially absense of bias. Even the mere spirit of appreciation of the literary skill and beauty that could not be missed in the passages quoted here, will give ample scope for their intellectual enjoyment. But, if unfortunately, none of these requisites are forth-coming, no

religion, philosophy or language, however grand,could afford to till such impervious soil, and it would be no uncharitable work of the plough or the ploughman to abandon it as a hopeless task.

*** Quotation No. I.***

 "Narayana is the Hari of hundred heads. He is the lord and soul of the Universe or Viswa. He is the eternal, blissful and bright Atma and Purusha. In Him is constituted all that is seen or heard, external or internal".

 This is one of the descriptions of Vishnu as all-pervading, the general idea conveyed by the name. The technical significance of Vishnu as the Lord of Viswa, will however have to be specially noticed. Viswa as used here does not refer to this material world as ordinarily understood. It alludes to Prana or the all-pervading life principle. Vishnu does not represent a human emperor ruling over the five continents of modern geography, as the Pandit surely believes.

 ***Q. No. II.***

 "Maya is the Prakriti and Mayina or Brahman is Maheswara from whom everything has originated. His name itself being glory or renown, he has no form". Here, Maya or pure Satwic condition is specially mentioned and Maheswara as its Lord without form. Maheswara however, is a technical term, but is commonly understood as a synonym for Siva.

*** Q. No. III.***

 "The name Rudra signifies, that he is not easily know able except by the pious Rishis. The name Esana denotes that He rules over all the Devas by his Saktis. The name Bhagavan Maheswara alludes to his blessing the devotees and to his holding the high position by the force of Yoga and knowledge of Atma. This is the history of Rudra".

 The terms Bhagavan and Maheswara are particularly technical as referring to Yoga, but to the learned Pandit, every technical term in the texts conveys only his single crude idea without any distinctions specified in our religious literature which he ever ventures to interpret without its study. The two terms noticed will be clearly explained subsequently in this section.

*** Q. No. IV.***

 "All the Devas enter into him, he is therefore called Vishnu. Everything is grown and expanded by him and therefore known as Bramha. In all the internal meditations, he shines like a light and therefore called Prakasa. Amidst all sorts of internal meditations, he appears as a flash of lightning in the form of Om, and breaking through them pervades all the Lokas,and therefore known as Mahadeva".

 The functions of the three Gods are explained here and it may be easily noticed that the definitions given allude to varieties of internal meditations and not to external affairs. The Pandit is likely to get confused here as he hears these facts probably for the first time in his life.

 ***Q. No. V.***

 "Rudra comprises all the Devas and the Devas are of his nature. On the right side of Rudra are, the Sun, Bramha and Fire. On his left side are, Uma, Vishnu and Soma or Moon. Uma is really Vishnu himself and Vishnu

is the Moon. The seed originates from Rudra and the soil is Vishnu. Rudra is Bramha himself and Bramha is Fire itself. Bramha and Vishnu make up Rudra and the Jagat is composed of Fire and Moon. All that is masculine is Rudra and feminine, Uma. The Universe is made up of both. The manifested is Uma and the unmanifested is Rudra, and the combination of both is Vishnu. Vishnu is the Atma, Bramha is Anter-Atma andMaheswara is Parama-Atma. Maheswara is the cause, Bramha, the act or process and Vishnu is the effect, all the three being only different aspects of Rudra. Rudra is Dharma, Bramha is the knowledge and Vishnu is the Jagat. Rudra is male and Uma female,Rudra is Bramha and Uma Saraswati. Rudra thenefore is the totality of Devas,and uttering his name saves mankind from all their sins. For the tree made up of the three Lokas, the top, middle and bottom represent Vishnu, Bramha and Rudra".

 This is an interesting and instructive quotation. Rudra, Bramha and Agni go together, so also Uma, Vishnu and Soma. The Jagat described is made up of both these sets. अग्नासोमात्मकं जगत्। Again, Dharma and cause represent Rudra, Kriya and Gnana represent Bramha, Jagat and effect represent Vishnu. There are so many combinations of terms and ideas here. Will any of our modern interpreters kindly enlighten us on any of these points ? Will the learned Pandit tell us how the Jagat which he interprets as the geographical earth is composed of Agni and Soma ? Vishnu is also described as a compound of Uma and Sankara. Has he any explanation to offer for it?

**उमाशङ्करयोर्योगः स योगो विष्णुरुच्यते॥**

 ***Q. No. VI.***

  (a) "The lotus that sprang from Vishnu's naval became the golden egg and Vishnu himself became Bramha of his

own accord, by the quality of Rejas, for the purpose of creating the Jegat in every Yuga, as long as doubt and settlement continue".

 Here Bramha is described as identical with Vishnu differing only in quality. The creation of Jegat is said to continue only as long as doubt and settlement continue. यावत्कल्पविकल्पना॥ Could Bramha himself be in doubt at times? If the man's state of mind is referred to as the passage naturally suggests, what does the Jegat signify? These natural questions have probably never struck the modern interpreters hitherto. The Jegat specified in the text as created by Bramha, is certainly not this earthy globe and these interpreters have surely no other idea of the Jegat. सर्वङ्गच्छतीति जगतः। Where everything goes to ultimately is the spot specified. The learned authorities have therefore no correct idea of Bramha, Jegat or its creation.

 (b) "The whole of the Jegat is pervaded by me in the form of Avyakta or unmanifested, and I am therefore called Vishnu by the Munis. In the same way, I am called Vasudeva because the Bhutas or elements live in me and I am in them as their Lord. I am known as Samkarshana by my devotees, because I take them at the end to Avyakta.I am known as Predyumna by those devotees who wish for progeny, because I take different and various forms according to their desire. In this Loka, I am alone independent, excepting Hari and Hara, and I am therefore known as Anirudha".

 It is clear that the Jegat and the Loka here specified do not allude to the earthy globe of the Pandit, and that the workings of Vishnu detailed here, as Vishnu, Samkarshana, Predyumna and Anirudha refer to something Avyakta or unmanifest ed which the modern interpreters have not yet dreamt of".

 (c) "O ! Parvati, the meaning of the Manthra consisting of eight letters and relating to Narayana should be properly understood, in order to be effctive by its repetition. Nara, denotes the totality of Atmas, of men or of the universe. It also refers to the Tatwas. He who is the basis of all of them is known as Narayana. Like the silk-worm, he creates and swallows the Jegat. At the time of the involution, he destroys Bramha, Indra, Rudra, Yema and Varuna, and floats on Maya described as the banian leaf.He is therefore called Hari. The Sakalom Jegat or the Jegat with form, comprising of everything commencing with Bramha, is dependent on Narayana. With a clear knowledge of this fact, the Manthra referred to should be repeated; otherwise there will be no effect. The first letter Om forms part of this Manthra, unlike others where it is added to the Manthras. Na and Ma are the next two letters and Narayanaya the last five letters. The Prenava Om is the seat of Bramha and represents the three Vedas. The letter A represents Vishnu, U represents Sri and M represents Jiva or individual soul, the twenty-fifth Tatwom. The consonants beginning with Ka represents the elements, those commencing with Ta and Tha the senses, Pa refers to the mind and Pha to Ahamkara Ba and Bha to Mahat and Prakriti. Ma the twenty-fifth letter represents Atma and Ahamkara. As everything depends upon the mercy of Eswara, this Ahamkara should be destroyed by adding Na the negative to Ma making Nama. Depending on the Lord of Sri, all Karmas should therefore be performed".

 Here Vishnu is described as the creator and destroyer of the Jegat which is said to include all forms commencing with Bramha. Thus the form of Bramha is the highest specified in the Jagat and everything downwards must be of some similar form in that region. The whole of the con-

tents of this Jegat is therefore naturally unknown to ordinary mankind. But our learned Pandit is somehow acquainted with Bramha and his subordinates, as if his village is within this Jegat and is one adjoining to that in which Bramha is put up. Again, Narayana is described as the Lord of all and the word 'Nama' meaning worship,used in the Manthra in question, is explained as signifying the necessity to annihilate egoism. Thus, every line in the quotation is pregnant with instructive and philosophical ideas, and there is no doubt that the Pandit will run over the passage with one sweep of his dirty broom and proclaim to the world that the whole of it describes some unreasonable and incoherent material affairs. It has almost become an established fact now that no delicate or sensible ideas could penetrate through his congealed brains.

**यस्य नास्ति विवेकस्तु केवलं यो बहुश्रुतः।  
न स जानाति शास्त्रार्थान् दर्वी पाकारसानिव॥**

 ***Q. No. VII.***

 "Maheswara, the first created, is known as Soma being combined with Uma. From his right side he created Bramha for further creation and gave him the Vedas and Puranas. From his left side, he created Vasudeva for preservation, and from his heart Kala-Rudra for destruction. In himself he is Siva without Gunas and is the object of meditation for the Yogis. The Viswa is originated at his pleasure and is preserved and destroyed likewise. The seed, of the nature of Predhana and Purusha, which developed itself is called Mahat or Budhi Tatwa. In that egg of Prakriti, the Kshetragna is called Bramha or Purusha or Prejapatis being the first creation with form. He is the first creator of the Bhutas or elements. When the Gunas lose their equilibrium by force of time, it is

called creation, and when they are at equipoise, it is Laya or destruction. The Bramhanda is the Kshetra or seat of this Bramha. When a duration of time extending to one hundred Paras pass away, all the elements merge in Prakriti. In course of time the Triads also merge in Prakriti and again spring forth. It is stated in the Vedas that the basis of Time here specified is Bhagavan Mahadeva. The five subtle elements, the Sun, Moon and Dikshit are his eight forms.The Viswa and Jegat are pervaded by these forms and hence he is called Visweswara.The blissful and eternal Avyakta, beyond Tamas or darkness,is known as Linga and the eternal light within it, is called Mahadeva".

 The eight forms of Mahadeva here described comprise Viswa and the Jegat. It is thus clear that Linga and Avyakta are their synonyms. The Pandit may now be safely assured that the poor authors of these religious texts have never dared to trespass upon his dearest property the earthy sphere. The religious evolution they described starts with Mahat or Budhi Tatwom succeeded by Bramha, and Bramha creates only the Bhutas or subtle elements.

**आदिकर्ता स भूतानां ब्रह्माग्रे समवर्तत॥**

 The Pandit might here insist upon his interpretation of Bhutas as applying to all the created objects in his material world, as if he is able to explain all else in the quotation consistently. Does Linga or Avyakta, mentioned here, represent the earth on which the Pandits' Bhutas reside ? What is the harm if Bhutas are explained as Devils, that also being a common meaning in Sanskrit?He may, for ought we know, one fine morning begin to explain the word as such too; there is no guarrantee as to what he will not attempt, because the criterion upon which he bases his interpretations is unknown to himself. His inability all

along, to explain reasonably two lines combined from quotations of this kind, ought to have ere this convinced him of his mistaken procedure, if only he possessed a grain of common sense in him. He may here be informed once for all, that in spite of his objectionable efforts to reduce the great Bramha and his Jegat to earthy stuff, they would still remain as sacred and important items in our hoary religion, to those who care for their use.

 "From this, the great seed of the nature of Prad hana and Purusha originated known by the names, Mahan, Atma, Mati, Bramha, Prabudhi, khyati, Eswara, Pregna, Dhriti, Smriti and Samvit. The blissful eternal light called Avyakta is known as Linga, and the vedas say that Maheswara is Linga. Avyakta denotes Siva and Linga is the Paramom or Saguna body of Bramhan. Avyakta itself is the Parmom or Saguna-bramhan called, Ananta, because it is infinite.Maheswara is beyond this Avyakta and the great egg came out of this Avyakta. Bramha came out of this egg and created the Jegat. The Triads are the three forms of Rudra. Tamas is Agni or fire, Rejas is Bramha and Satwa is Vishnu. The wife of Rudra of whom you spoke is his own essence the eternal Vishnu with a single sringa or horn whose body is the water of Maya. The region of Dhruva or Polar star is higher than that of the Rishis. Vishnu resides there in the form of Dharma. Satya-loka is six koti Yojanas above the region of Prajapati. It is known as Bramha-loka where there is no mortality. It is the path for

the yogis. In that Bramha's city is the Vishnu-loka reaching which none has to return. Above this Bramha's abode is the bright region of Hara surrounded by fire. From the midst of Purusha and Avyakta, Mahatwom or greatness occurred. It is known as Ahamkara and Mahan. Purusha is Vishnu named also Siva. Avyakta is Uma named also Sri. By their combination Ahamkara originated named Guha the commander-in-chief. The Purusha inside the body known as Kshetregna the life principle, is himself the Soma described here. Vishnu is the Paramatma that pervades over all the Devas. The Vishnu who is described as single and sometimes as ten, is Aditya or Sun possessing all the glories of Yoga. The Veda is Bramha who is adored daily by Bramha-yegna. In these, the Para-Bramhan is referred to by the names Narayana, Siva, Vishnu, Sankara and Purushottama. The eleven Adityas who have come down to the earth are the products of Prakriti called Virajas, the twelth is of my nature named Vishnu."

 In going through valuable quotations like the above, overwhelming with clear and detail explanations of religious technicalities, the temptation is irresistible to condemn in the strongest terms, the ignorant perversity and the insolent intrusion of the modern Pandit in his unauthorised and unqualified attempt to soil the sacred texts with his irrelevant and low type of interpretations. The philosophical ideas here expressed are so prominent and unmistakable that even the blind can feel their distinct forms and character. It is not difficult to notice in this quotation that the terms, Uma, Sri, Linga, Prakriti and Avyakta are synonymously used, as also Purusha, Vishnu and Siva, the former set referring to the material causes or Upadana-karana and the latter to the efficient or Nimitha-karana. The most misleading fact

underlying the mistakes of current interpretations is, as already explained, the conception that the Avyakta or Prakriti here described is the same as that understood in the ordinary philosophical analysis of the material world. Although the same terms are often used, a serious religious distinction is philosophically maintained in the religious literature. All the items specified have two opposite tendencies, to evolve and to involve, the former being defined as of the nature of Avidya and the latter of pure Maya with which alone religion deals. The Avyakta here described does not represent the ignorance or darkness denoted by Avidya to which the origin of the material world is traced. The religious Avyakta and Prakriti point distinctly to the bright region of light devoid of individualities and restrictions of finiteness. They allude to the endless infinity known as Ananta.

**अनन्तत्वमनन्तस्य यतः संख्या न विद्यते।  
तदव्यक्तमितिज्ञेयं तत् ब्रह्म परमं ध्रुवम्॥**

 The terms Rishi, Dhruva, Aditya, Soma, Sringa &c, are highly philosophical and purely technical, and the Pandit in his generous mood is probably anxious to convert them into some practically useful objects with which he is familiar, and to publish his made-easy series for the benefit of his fellow country-men, without himself looking into the original literature. But in this process of his transformation of religious subjects into historical and geographical text books for school children, he could only get hold of low material ideas which his intellect is capable of grasping. The foreign critic and his indigenous imitator base their arguments for modern enlightened criticisms, upon the stuff furnished by the Pandit and they have by nature, formed for themselves a preconceived opinion as to the real contents of the texts without a look into the original. The main object of their

labours being merely critical without a personal interest for religious enquiry, nothing more than the apparent defects, now made so much of in modern critical reviews, could be perceived by their self-prejudiced eyes.

**काव्ये भव्यतमेऽपि विज्ञनिवहैरास्वाद्यमाने मुद्दु-

*** Q. No. IX.***

 "In the treatment of a change, Avyakta is described as Kshethra and Bramha as Kshetregna, in their mutual relation as the container and the contained.This creation of Prakriti directed by Kshetragna, originated at first like a flash of lightning, without the work of Budhi. He who correctly understands this birth of Hiranyagarbha will obtain all happiness;and in his practice of involutionary process he will secure emancipation. Bramha's day is known as creation and night as destruction. Of course he has neither night nor day, they are so explained simply for the instruction of man. Pradhana is Tama and Purusha is Satwa.When they are in their sameness of nature, it is called Laya. When Pradhana is agitated, Rejas originates, and in the disturbed state of the gunas creation begins. Thus the Triad springs up. Rejas is Bramha that creates, Tamas is Agni in the form of Time, and Satwa is Vishnu who is neutral. They represent the three fires and the three Vedas. They are mutually dependant and never separated from each other. Purusha is Para and Prakriti is Paraa. He is named Purusha on account of his residing in Puri or body. Being the first and unoriginated, he is called Swayombhu; being fit object for worship, he is Yegna; being omniscient, he is Kavi; being the first Agni known as the Sun, he is

Kapila. He is pregnant with hiranyom, wealth or brightness, or he produces the same and hence known as Hiranyagerbha in the Puranas. Directed by Eswara, Pradhana acts at the time of creation, and Bramha and Budhi simultaneously originate. He is called Triguna because of the three divisions, and Chatur-vyuha on account of four divisions. He is named Atma on account of his capacity to take any form he siezes. He pervades everything and therefore he is Rishi,he enters into everything and therefore he is Vishnu, he protects everyone and therefore Prejapati, he is the god of the gods and therefore Mahadeva".

 Several important terms are clearly explained here such as, Kshetragna, Hiranyagerbha, Swayambhu, Yegna, Kavi, Kapila, Atma, Rishi, Prejapati, Vishnu and Mahadeva. Most of these names probably convey no important meanings yet to the Pandit. Kapila especially is described as the first Agni or fire called Aditya or Sun.

**आदित्यसंज्ञकः कपिलस्त्वप्रजोऽग्निरिति स्मृतः॥**

The critic always wants to establish that Kapila of the Puranas is only an author of books who flourished in India in some century A. D. Has he any other sensible meaning to apply here? To him everything is mythology and to the Pandit, everything is anthropology. Thus, from both of them there is no apology even for their mistakes. It is highly desirable at this stage to form some definite idea of Bramha or Hiranyagerbha. The Puranic descriptions are generally explained in the commentaries as follows.

 **प्रत्यगात्मभूता च बुद्धिरध्यवसायाध्यारम्भकं भूतसूक्ष्मं बुद्धिशब्दवाच्यम्। तत्समष्टिरूपा हैरण्यगर्भी बुद्धिर्महानात्मेत्युच्यते। सा सर्वासां बुद्धीनां कारणत्वात् सूक्ष्मतरा व्यापिनी प्रत्यग्भूता च॥**

 It is indeed a pity that neither the original texts nor their commentaries conform to the enlightened views of the

modern interpreters. The application of the term Budhi as used here, is limited to that particular tendency of the Intellect to turn back inwards to the direction of Bramhan, No other display of the Intellect is recognised as Budhi in our religious literature. The conception of the totality of such Budhis is known as Bramha, Hiranyagerbha, Mahan and Atma.The modern interpreters are thus quite safe from the clutches of this Bramha. Their superior intellects are too strong for the poor old Bramha to bear.

 Bramha could, under the circumstances, hardly find at any time in his life, a large number of poor intellects as specified here, falling within his sway,

**दृश्यन्ते भुविभूरिनिम्बतरवः कुत्रापि ते चन्दनाः  
पाषाणैःपरिपूरिता वसुमती वज्रो मणिर्दुर्लभः।  
श्रूयन्ते करटारवाश्च सततं चैत्रे कुहूकूजितं  
तन्मन्ये खलसंकुलं जगदिदं द्वित्राः क्षितौ सज्जनाः॥**

 ***Q. No. X.***

 "Bramha is Rejas, Vishnu and Siva are Satwic. Krishna of Go-lokais beyond Prakriti and devoid of qualities. The ignorant people alone talk of Siva as Tamasic. The five Pranas or vital airs constitue Vishnu. Mind represents Bramha and Prejapathi Bramhan is the eternal light meditated upon by the Yogis and Prakriti is its power or Sakti. The Bramhan viewed as inclined to crcate is known as Purusha, as inclined to materiality, is called Vishayi. Parvati and Durga represent Budhi, Bramha denotes Manas, Krishna denotes Dharma, Maheswara denotes Gnana and the Devas represent the senses. They dwell within all the creatures witnessing their deeds. The name Narayana is explained thus. Nara means Mukti called Sarupya and Ayanom is path. Nara means sins committed and Ayanom is going. Narom is liberation and Ayanom is

Gnana. The endless or infinite as described in the Vedas, Puranas, Sastras and Yogas, is Ananta. Mukunda means, he who grants Bhakti, also emancipation. Madhusudana is explained by the wise as the destroyer of Madhu the Asura, but in the Vedas it is explained somewhat differently. It alludes to the refuge for Karmas as well as for the devotees. It also means the destroyer of all desires towards transient pleasures. Kesava means lying in water or residing in all the bodies. Kamsari means the destroyer of Kamsa, or of sins, of disease, of obstruction or of grief. Hari means destroyer of even the Viswa in the form of Rudra. Sleep and other tendencies are the Kalas of Prakriti. Ahamkara, avarice &c. belong to Adharma. Siva is the light of Gnana and I am Atma without Gunas. When I enter into the Prakriti, I am Saguna or with Guna. Dharma, Sesha, Surya, Soma, Munis, Manus, Devas, Jivan-muktas and devotees, all pertain to my Kala which destroys worldly miseries".

 A number of technical terms are here defined, explaining their real significance as used in the religious literature and there is no doubt that all of them invariably allude to certain definite ideas diametrically opposed to the views of the Pandit and the Critic. Bramha, Vishnu and Siva clearly represent the conceptions of totalities or the general religious bases denoting God's glories. Bramha has been explained already as alluding to the totality of Budhi or the determination to involve. As all the religious advancement has to start with this turn of mind, it is described as Bramha's creation. The work of maintaining and developing this Budhi points to Vishnu and preservation. Rudra as destroyer has two functions here. He has to destroy the worldly desires of man before Bramha could create the Budhi which turns back to the Bramhan. He has also to destroy the good effects of Bramha's and Vishnu's workings before final

emancipation could be secured. Thus the three gods here specified are not virtually distinct and separate, and they cannot possibly continue to exist as such. Vide quotation 9.

**अन्योन्यमिथुना ह्येते ह्यन्योन्यमुपजीविनः।  
क्षणंवियोगो न ह्येषां न त्यजन्ति परस्परम्॥**

In the conceptions of Bramha,Vishnu and Siva, the following important points have therefore to be ever kept before our view to avoid doubt and confusion.

 (1) The region of the Triad is the sphere of Satwic Maya, and not of Avidya, which is exactly the jurisdiction of the modern interpreters.

 (2) The very nature of the functions of the Triad is involutionary. The creation of Bramha or evolution virtually means the destruction of all the worldly desires and  
the consequent rising of a devotional tendency in man.

 (3) Vishnu preserves and developes the Budhi created by Bramha and does not preserve any other absurdities.

 (4) Siva is primarily the cause of Bramha's creation by his destroying the worldly desires, and lastly he is the cause of final liberation by annihilating the good effects of religious devotion and practice.

 (5) Bramha, Vishnu and Siva as explained above, exhaust the religious requirements for the final emancipation of man. It is certainly most unfortunate that these highly philosophical, scientific and religious instructions conveyed through the sacred texts by the ancient venerable sages, are now shamelessly interpreted by the indigenous Pandit himself as cock and bull stories, and sneeringly reviewed by the foreign critic as old-world simplicties and ignorant superstitions. It is equally pitiable that they are explained by the Theosophists as visions in the narcotic plains and the workings of the hobgoblins. Under the present state of

affairs, it is one of the most difficult and hopeless task to convince the modern commentators of ancient religious texts, if they will not condescend to look into the original. Off-hand criticisms on imaginary originals volunteered without the least interest or reverence for the sacredness of the subject could not possibly be met by any known methods of argumentation.

**इतरकर्मफलानि यदृच्छया विलिखितानि सहे चतुरानन  
अरसिकेषु कवित्वनिवेदनं शिरसि मालिख मा लिख मालिख॥**

 ***Q. No. XI.***

 "Siva is Alinga without Gunas and Linga is Avyakta or Prakriti. Rudra is pure and holy and is therefore named Siva in the Puranas. Bramha is Paramatma being eternal Intelligence. When everything is dissolved at night, he sleeps in the waters of the ocean and hence called Narayana. Viswara, Mahan, Pregna, Manas, Bramha, Chiti, Smriti, Khyati, Samvit, Eswara and Mati are the synonyms for this great Intelligence, whose favour is obtained by Prana-yama. Viswara means dislike for materialities. Mahan means the greatest among the Tatwas, Pregna is the seat of knowledge, Manas is mental faculty and Bramha is the power of expansion and progress. Chiti is understanding power, Smriti is memory, Samvit is the spot from which every thing is obtained. Khyati is what is declared as gnana. The omniscient at the head of all Tatwas is Eswara,the thinking or reflecting faculty is Mati. That which cognises and points out the knowledge is Budhi. The all-pervading Parameswara, is known as Sarva as the basis of Bramhanda, as Bhava in the waters, as Rudra in the fire, as Ugra in the air, as Bhima in the earth, as Maheswara in egoism and as Esa in Budhi. Everything from Bramha downwards is  
styled Pasu or cattle, being bound by the cords of materiality. Rudra, their ruler is Pasu-pati. The 24 Tatwas

constitute the bondage which is destroyed by worshipping Siva. His worship is called Bhakti which is of three kinds, by thought word and deed. Meditating his forms as the material cause is mental worship. The repetition of Manthras is worship by word, and Prana-yama and similar acts are worship by deed. Avidya is divided into five classes, Tama, Moha, Mahamoha, Tamisra, and Andha-tamisra. Avidya itself is Tama or ignorance. Moha is egoism. Mahamoha is desire. Tamisra is anger. Andha-Tamisra is clinging to life and false knowledge. Artha, the signified object is Siva, and its name is called Gowri or Parvati. Everything is included in Linga or Avyakta and it should be worshipped for obtaining liberation. Siva has eight forms or Tatwas which refer to the bases of the items comprising the body of man. Sarva refers to the earthy portion, Bhava to water, Pasu-pati to fire, Esa to air, Bhima to Akasa, Mahadeva to mind, Ugra to individual Atma. The eighth is the Atma pervading everywhere whose worship procures liberation. Siva as the material and efficient causes of the Universe has five forms called Pancha-bramha. The first is Kshetragna, the enjoyer of everything coming under Prakriti. The second is Tatpurusha representing Prakriti itself. The third is Aghora representing Budhi as developed by the eight Angas of Yoga. The fourth is Vamadeva referring to the all-pervading Ahamkara. The fifth is Sadyojata referring to the mind. Siva is the internal lord of all, in the forms of Pragna, Tyjasa and Viswa, the bases for the three states of sleeping, dreaming and waking. He is described as of four forms, namely, Pramata, Pramana, Prameya and Pramiti, also as the Karta or doer, Kriya or act, Karya or effect, and Karana or instrument",

 This lengthy quotation is no doubt full of technical details disclosing strange news to the Pandit. Being him-

self a stranger to the religious texts, it is nothing surprising that their contents appear brand-new to him. The only matter for regret however is, that in spite of the numerous passages reproduced, he could hardly find a single line in them corroborating the crude and unreasonable views he has long formed presumptuously,without a study of the subject.The various forms of Bramhan here enumerated refer to its glories in the sphere of Satwic Maya or Prakriti, explained as Tatwas for the religious advancement of the pious devotees. The sphere of modern interpreters is also clearly defined and classified in the language of the Puranas and is reproduced below from the above quotation. A complete and earnest study of its geography will surely benefit them to a great extent, and might also save the poor religious Hindus in the land from their further unnecessary interference.

**तमो मोहो महामोहस्तामिस्र इति पण्डिताः।  
अन्धतामिस्र इत्याहुरविद्यां पञ्चधा स्थिताम्।  
अविद्यां तम इत्याहुरस्मितां मोह इत्यपि।  
महामोह इति प्राज्ञा रागं योगपरायणाः।  
द्वेषं तामिस्र इत्याहु रन्धतामिस्र इत्यपि।  
तथैवाभिनिवेशञ्च मिथ्याज्ञानं विवेकिनः॥**

 All the grand historical and geographical explanations hitherto propogated by the modern interpreters, logicallyf all under this classification of Avidya, a region which they are naturally unwilling to quit. It is clearly described in the above passage as the field of human passions and desires for material objects which no man can ever hope to satisfy during his short period of existence.

**भ्रान्तं देशमनेकदुर्गविषमं प्राप्तं न किञ्चित्फलं  
त्यक्त्वा जातिकुलाभिमानमुचितं सेवा कृता निष्फला।  
भुक्तं मानविवर्जितं परगृहेष्वाशङ्कया काकवत्  
तृष्णे जृम्भसि पापकर्मनिरते नााद्यापि सन्तुष्यसि॥**

*** Q. No. XII.***

 "The Eswara full of purity and blissfulness is named Siva. Rudra signifies removal of grief. When Siva pervades everywhere, he is called Vishnu. Siva viewed as the material cause or originator of every form, he is called PitaMaha or Bramha. When Siva annihilates all ideas of materiality and removes the miseries of Samsara, like a doctor curing diseases, he is called Samsara-vydya. As Siva remains unaltered under all conditions, he is called Sada-Siva. As he secures knowledge without effort, he is called Sarvagna. When Siva is associated with all the above glories and viewed as separate from Para-Bramhan, he is called Paramaṭma".

 Here Siva is described as taking the forms and doing the works of Bramha, Vishnu and Rudra. It is hoped that the explanations already furnished will suffice to enable us to understand this description correctly. The three gods are said to be distinguished only by their functions, which in themselves cannot be distinctly demarcated as they depend upon each other. Siva meaning auspicious, as used here is a general name for all the functions of the three gods together.

*** Q. No. XIII.***

 "Hiranyagerbha is known as representing Budhi. In the Sankhya philosophy, he is called Mahan, Virinchi &c, and he is also marked by a single letter".

 The synonymous terms for Bramha are here, given, which have been already noticed in the previous quotatious. We may however note that there are no contradictions in the explanations and definitions furnished by the different Puranas on any points hitherto examined.

 ***Q. No. XIV.***

 "From the Satwic guna of the subtle elements the Gnana-saktis originated. From their totality, mind arose as an instrument, the guiding principle of which is Bramha known as Hiranyagerbha. Again from the Rajasic guna of the subtle elements, the Kriti-saktis originated. From their totality Prana arose, the guiding principle of which is Vishnu known as Sutratma. Maheswara is seated in both the varieties of Saktis known as Anter-yami in the Vedas. Sankara is the witness and the underlying principle of everything in the Jegat. Siva himself is the Linga and Linga is Gameka or a suggestion. Siva comprehends everything but nothing comprehends him. Therefore he is described as Sat, Chit and Ananda. Siva himself is the Linga, but he has no Linga. Bramha, Vishnu and Rudra explained separately belong to the department of Paramatma and they never belong to that of Jiva.Jiva is the reflection in Avidya and not in Maya. The names Bramha, Vishnu and Rudra allude to one and the same object, as the terms sower, cultivator and reaper apply to a single farmer in his dfferent capacities."

 This quotation entirely removes all possible doubts regarding the most vital points. Bramha, Vishnu and Rudra are stated to be only different names of Bramhan, viewed in different aspects. The Triads are declared to belong to the department of Maya and not to that of Avidya. Linga or Avyakta belongs to Siva and is a suggestion through which Siva may be discovered. Such unambiguous definitions and explanations are furnished throughout the religious literature, but they are not capable of being understood without even reading them. The modern Pandit of course is an exception to this ordinary rule. He is gifted with the powers of divine vision especially in religious matters. As

a matter of fact, he has no ordinary eyes even, at present, to see the serious consequences of his suicidal stubbornness. His own status and respect once depended entirely upon his correct knowledge of the subject and his capacity to enlighten others. But he is now virtually trying his utmost to destroy the very life and importance of the literature itself.

**पीतं यत्र हिमंपयः कबलिता यस्मिन्मृणालांकुरा-  
स्तापार्तेन निमज्ययत्र सरसो मध्ये विमुक्तः श्रमः।  
धिक् तस्यैवजलानि पङ्किलयतःपाथोजनिं मथ्नतः  
कूलान्युत्खनतःकरीन्द्रभवतो लज्जापिनो जागरा॥**

 ***Q. No. XV.***

 "In the Vedas, Puranas, Upanishads and in the Sastras on Astrology, Sankhya, Yoga, Medicine &c., I am called by several names which owe their origin, to my attributes and workings. I shall explain to you the meanings of such terms in accordance with Nirukta. My Prakriti is Satwic and consists of 18 gunas. She is the eternal, true and in vulnerable Atma. From her everything good originates such as Tapas and Yegna. The Purana-purusha, Virat known as Anirudha, the creator and destroyer of the Lokas, originates from her. After the Bramhic night, a bright lotus originated in which Bramha was born, from the pleasure of Anirudha. At the end of the Bramhic day, Rudra was similarly born from his anger. The functions of these two gods are creation and destruction showing the two methods of religious progress for the benefit of mankind. Rudra is an austere Yogi, wearing matted hair. He is fond of cremation grounds and is the destroyer of the Tripuras. He is of the nature of Narayana and appears in every Yuga. If therefore, he is worshipped, Narayana is greatly pleased. Dharma is involutionary in nature and it leads to prosperity. I am the single and eternal refuge for mankind. Dharma

is known as Vrisha or bull. I am therefore Vrisha in accordance with dictionary meaning. Kapi or monkey, Varaha or boar, Sreshta or great and Vrisha or bull are the terms used to represent Dharma. Kasyapa Prajapati therefore called me by the name of Vrisha-kapi".

 This quotation like the previous ones explains that different names are used in the religious texts to describe the attributes and workings of Apara or Sabda Bramhan, and that they should not be taken to denote different and separate entities. Bramha and Rudra as well as their functions, creation and destruction described here are clearly mentioned as referring to two necessary processes prescribed for the religious advancement of man.

**एतौ द्वौ विबुधश्रेष्ठौ प्रसादक्रोधजावुभौ।  
तदादर्शितपन्थानौ सृष्टिसंहारकारकौ॥**

By devotion and Tapas, one has therefore to transform himself into all these holy deities, as instructed in detail by the Puranic descriptions of their various functions. This is the real import of the classification and description of the Triads in our religious literature. The subject in its entirety as well as in its parts is therefore extremely serious and sacred. It is hoped that there is no necessity at this stage of the essay to repeat the warning against the silly tendency of the modern day to treat such matters as allegories and mythologies. We have by this time completely proved the entire absurdity of such a blasphemous attitude. No impure heart, tongue or hand of man shall therefore dare to meddle with it with impunity.

**येषां श्रीमद्यशोदासुतपदकमले नास्ति भक्तिर्नराणाम्  
येषामाभीरकन्या प्रियगुणकथने नानुरक्ता रसज्ञा।  
येषां श्रीकृष्णलीलाललितगुणरसे सादरौ नैवकर्णौ  
धिक् तान् धिक् तान् धिगेतान् कथयति सततं कीर्तनस्थो मृदङ्गः॥**

 
<MISSING_FIG href="../../../../../books_images/U-IMG-1699280904Screenshot(40"/>.png)Practically ample quotations are here noted for the easy comprehension of the real significance of the three terms explained above, if only there be the will to catch their correct meaning without any bias or prejudice. The difficulty ordinarily experienced by many is owing to their having been previously prepared with their own commentaries without ever dreaming of the original texts. In 99 cases out of 100 especially in religious matters, judgement before trial is exactly the state of affairs; and everybody is allowed with impunity to exercise the privilege of offering their own views even while umasked. It is the mistaken interpretation that is virtually circulated among the people, by the so-called Pundit authorities and taken for the real contents of the texts. An enquiry as to how such mistaken notions have gradually taken root in the minds of the public, might perhaps be an interesting and useful topic for the historian, but it would be out of place here, and certainly unnecessary, as a direct examination of the texts themselves is the avowed object of this little volume. When the true gist of the matter is understood, it may however be possible to discover, how these high philosophical ideas and facts have deteriorated to their present condition owing to the ignorance of the fundamental principles and formulas, which undoubtedly demand for their correct understanding, higher culture, deeper thought and greater interest than are available in the average worldly-wise man.

 It is not very difficult to make out clearly from the various passages quoted above, that the Tri-murtis are the three different phases and conditions of one and the only entity. They are always mutually connected with and mutually dependent on each other. It must also be particularly observed that all of them stand above the level of the phenomenal and material existence which is but the product

of Avidya (vide Q. 14) Apart from this general description, their special functions are compared to those of a farmer performing himself the work of sowing, growing and reaping. Bramha is described as representing Manas or Budhi in its purest condition giving rise to Gnana or real knowledge. Vishnu represents Dharma (which comprises Gnana, Dhyana, Sama and Dama) fostering and maintaining the knowledge obtained. Rudra destroys sorrow and misery and extracts pure knowledge like the reaper who cuts off the straw and secures the crop. The root meanings of these terms are in themselves sufficiently significant. From Brimh, to develop or increase, Bramah denotes developed Intelligence. From Vis to pervade, Vishnu refers to the developed Intelligence pervading everywhere and understanding everything in its true and philosophical light. From Rud and Dra to destroy pain, Rudra denotes the annihilation of all obstacles to the permanent securing of the Gnana that has been originated and fostered already. Vishnu and Rudra are thus dependent on Bramah to start with Gnana and Bramah cannot continue to be useful without the help of Vishnu and Rudra. Their relative superiority is thus an irrelevant and illogical question for discussion. But the religious disputes frequently arising among ordinary people are based on the mistaken supposition that their functions are simply and directly connected with the creation, preservation and destruction of this material world, glorious as it is with all its miseries and wickedness. A little thought and reading will convince us of the absurdity of the supposition. As clearly explained in the preceding pages, the mundane affairs are the products of Avidya enforcing the eternal laws of Karma, the enactment of Easwara. Otherwise, taking even the popular view of the matter, it would virtually result in holding the Legislative Councils and the High

Courts responsible for all the offences perpetrated in the world. The Tri-Murtis are however meant only for those few who are wise enough and bold enough to step out of the beaten path of worldly wisdom. Thus, the majority of sectarian quarrels now taking place, is based upon ignorance combined with Egoism and pride and is often caused by lucrative considerations relating to rich temples and religious Mutts. The divine and sacred ideas are dragged down for the purpose of satisfying mean and selfish ends and such attempts deserve to be treated only as acts of irreligion and blasphemy.

 In the very passages here quoted, we find several synonymous terms used to denote each of the Tri-murtis as noted below. Similar free use of words will be found all over the religious texts. But it must be noted that there might be shades of difference in their meanings depending upon the occasions on which they are applied.

 (1) Mahan, Kshetragna, Virinchi, Pitamaha etc., for Bramah.

 (2) Hari, Vasudeva, Narayana, Vrisha-kapi etc., for Vishnu.

 (3) Easwara, Mahadeva, Visweswara, Siva, Hara etc., for Rudra.

 Some of these words are almost interchangeable and the Sahasranamas contain several words used in praise of all the three without any distinction. The Puranas whose titles point to their being Vaishnavite in character, often extol the greatness of Siva and *vice versa*. All these clearly show that no difference is meant to be observed among the status of the Tri-murtis.

**शिवस्य हृदयं विष्णुः विष्णोश्च हृदयं शिवः॥  
रुद्रो ब्रह्मा उमा वाणी तस्म्यै तस्यै नमो नमः॥**

**रजोगुणधरो देवः स्वयमेव हरिः परः।  
ब्रह्मरूपं समास्थाय जगत्स्रष्टुं प्रवर्तते॥**

 These passages are neither contradictions, nor even compromises, but are correct explanations of the true signi- ficance of the Tri-murtis as treated in the religious texts.Unfortunately, they cannot but be inconsistent in accordance with the current unauthorised misinterpretations. Neither the venerable authors of the sacred texts nor those who will not stoop to deliver judgment without a trial, could ever hope to satisfy these Panditasters. I fear, time has sufficiently advanced, that self-made commentaries on imaginary originals are more than we could bear any longer.

<MISSING_FIG href="../../../../../books_images/U-IMG-1699283337Screenshot(41"/>.png)Like the Tri-murtis just noticed, who are treated as primary Gods in the religious literature, there are Goddesses described as their respective consorts and others to whom different functions are assigned. They refer to the Saktis or active principles underlying the processes of religious evolution and involution detailed in the texts.

 "Devi concentrated her thoughts and created the big egg of Jegat. She is therefore called Sringara-kala and Kama-kala. Bramha originated from herself, so also Vishnu, Rudra, Marut-ganas, Gandharvas, Apsaras, Kinneras and other musicians all at once. All the enjoyable objects originated. Everything pertaining to Sakti originated, All the varieties of animal life originated. She is Para-Sakti. By the abandonment of the five forms which do not belong to her real form, their basis the real Tatwa remains eternal. The various philosophical canons, 'I am Bramhan,' "Thou art That' &c, represent this Devi of the sixteenth stage, recognised by the Manthras made up of 15 letters and known by various names, such as, Sri-vidya, Maha-tripura-sundari, Balambika, Bekala, Mathengi, Swayomvara-kalyani, Bhuvaneswari, Chamunda, Chanda, Varahi, Tiras karini, Raja-mathengi, Suka-syamala, Leghu-syamala, Aswarudha, Pretyamgira, Dhumavati, Savitri, Saraswati and Bramhananda-kala."

 The Devi here described as the mother of the Triads and of the whole universe is the Satwic Maya which is clearly explained as representing the highest knowledge to be attained by philosophy. The several names here given allude to the shades of difference in the conceptions of the same Devi for different purposes.Devi is stated to be the religious conception as the sixteenth stage called Sri-vidya, meaning clearly the highest and the truest knowledge. No explanations co**u**ld be ventured here regarding the Manthra made up of 15 letters which applies to her, as the science of manthras is in itself a separate and important subject. It has been already noticed to some extent in the previo**u**s section. It may be specially noticed in this connection,for the information of the younger generation of educated Hindus, that there is nothing unphilosophical or unsceintific in the description furnished in this sacred Upanishad, The Devi is not an allegorical or unscientific mythological figure as generally understood, but she represents the ultimate knowledge of the Absolute, a most philosophical, scientific and practical fact, which however demands some effort, thought and devotion for its realisation. The knowledge specified is clearly defined in the religious texts as logically and scientifically as any of the modern scientific terms. The only defects that stand in the way of its understanding are the prevailing indifference and the unwise, unpatriotic and irreverent antipathy of the rising generation. It is however a serious mistake to attribute this tendency to any drawbacks in the modern civilization which doubtless sets one athinking. A sensible exposition of the subject that would amply satisfy the enquiring minds is the real desideratum. It may therefore be assured for the hundredth time in this essay that the texts in themselves are in no way defective but are sufficiently valuable for the present generation and a few generations to come. The

safest and the best suggestion that could be offered under the present state of affairs is to study the original texts oneself praying to this Devi direct to exhibit her real form as explained in the above quotation.

**सत्वादिस्थैरगणितगुणैर्हन्त विश्व प्रसूय  
व्यक्तं धत्ते प्रहसनकरीं या कुमारीति संज्ञाम्।  
मोहध्वान्तप्रसरविरतिर्विश्व मूर्तिः समन्ता-  
दाद्याशक्तिःस्फुरतु मम सा दीपवद्देहगेहे॥**

***Q. No II.***

 "May the goddess Saraswati whose form is the very essence of the Vedanta, protect me. She is the Sakti of Bramhan that is dealt with in the Vedas and Vedangas as the only one. She directs the three Lokas internally by her involutionary work. She is the guiding principle in Rudra, Aditya &c., and she is enjoyed by those who turn their eyes inwards in their involutionary process of work. She is the expanding knowledge divided into eight parts. She is Nirvikalpa and the form of the Bramhan meditating on whom the Yogis deliver themselves from bondage. May the pure and white Saraswati residing in the face of Bramha take rest in my heart''.

 The goddess Saraswati is here described as the ultimate knowledge and form of Brahman and particularly explained as enjoyed by those who turn their eyes inward back to the Bramhan.

**या प्रत्यक् दृष्टिभिर्जीवैः व्यज्यमानानुभूयते॥**

 This turning of the mind towards God from its present materialistic tendency is invariably mentioned in all the descriptions to avoid mistaken notions on this important point. It is after all a simple and plain statement that, south is not north, night is not day, might is not right, wickedness is

not virtue, hypocricy is not devotion, irreligion is not civilization.

*** Q. No. III.***

 "Parvathi, Maheswara's beloved wife is in the form of the highest gnana known as Chit-akasa. She has four Saktis named Santi, Vidya, Pretishta and Nivriti".

 The Pandit cannot discover his anthropology here even with the help of a microscope. The whole of it is religious Psychology of which he has never heard before. The Critic probably never expected to find anything reasonable in the midst of Indian superstitious literature. His Munshi's teachings evidently did not give him an occasion for any such suspicion. He judged the merits of the literature from the enlightenment of his Munshi and was therefore pitiably misled.

***Q. No. IV.***

 "From the Maya-body of Bramha who originated from Avyakta, the eight-handed Gayatri sprang up. In the Swayambhuva-manwantara, she fought with Mahisha-asura in the interest of the Devas as directed by Bramha. She killed him on the mount Mandara, and on another occasion, she killed Chitrasura on the Vindhya mountains, taking the form of Nanda. The purport of the story is that this Devi here represents Gnana-sakti and Mahisha or buffalo denotes ignorance which could be destroyed only by true knowledge. It is the rule in the Itihasas to narrate such abstract matters in concrete forms. When they are explained by the learned in the language of the Vedas, the goddess is described as residing in the heart without form".

 Young school boys who understand the language can easily grasp the meaning of this quotation. It is clearly stated that the forms described in the Itihasas are expressly

explained as representing the formless. If the Pandit therefore dares to contradict the text itself, he must be either a lunatic or a personal enemy to the religion he pretends to profess and is virtually an out-caste. The goddess Gayatri represents the religious knowledge conveyed by the sacred Manthra well-known by that name. We have already noticed in the preceding section that the Manthras not only convey some philosophical ideas, but that their very composition is based upon a science called Siksha or the Physiology of sound. The eight hands of this goddess allude to the eight Prakritis and the eight Sidhis which are the natural results accruing from the proper practice of this Manthra. The Asuras she killed on the mountains named, are significant in the Puranic language. Mahisha or buffalo does not demand an explanation.It represents stupidity in the extreme. Chithrasuraa, meaning variegated colours refers to the knowledge of variety and the ignorance of unity. Mount Mandara signifies dullness or stupidity and Vindhya plainly means obstruction. The story as a whole points to the necessity of destroying ignorance by proper knowledge. The religious knowledge has been defined as commencing only with the determination to involve. The ignorance represented by Mahisha or buffalo covers all kinds of materialities.It is thus evident that all the modern interpretations of the sacred texts as virtually alluding to the phenomenal world, fall within the province of the Great Mahisha-asura, within whose territory and under whose supreme rule, the Pandits and the civilized Hindu gentlemen now reside.It is an open secret that the majority of our modern religious Pretenders care only for one goddess of lucre. All other religious and ethical considerations are entirely subordinate. This is exactly the history of Mahisha's rule here detailed.

*** Q. No. V.***

 "The term Prakriti is explained as follows in accordance with its root-meaning. In the Vedas Pra means superior or first, and Kriti is creation. Pra again means Satwa, Kri Reja and Ti Tama. Prakriti thus respresents the all-powerful Sakti possessing the three gunas. The Atma divided itself into two, the male on the right side and the female on left which is known as Prakriti. The two stand in the relation of fire and its heat, and the Yogis therefore do not recognise any difference between male and female. In her act of creation, Prakriti is distinguished as of five forms. Durga, the mother of Genesa, is the first form representing the underlying principle of all the vegetable and other lives. Lekshmi is the second form representing the glories observable in heaven and earth. Saraswati is the third form representing the real knowledge that removes all doubts. Savitri or Gayatri, the mother of the Vedas, Sandhya, Manthras and Tanthras, is the fourth form representing the Bramhaic lustre and energy. Radha, residing in Go-loka in the form of a Gopi is the fifth form representing the five vital airs. She is seen by the Yogis by meditation according to the methods prescribed in the Vedas. Sak means glory and Ti is valour. Sakti is the form of both. Bhaga means prosperity and Budhi and Bhagavati is their form. Radha and Sarva-mangala allude to the power of granting liberation. Amba means mother of the Jegat. Being created by Vishnu, she is Vishnavi. Gowri means the Sakti pertaining to the Parvati Gurus or masters, namely Siva and Krishna.

alludes to the Parvas or the holy festive occasions on which she is worshipped. Sanatani means existing without gunas at all times and places. Kritika refers to the Kalas of Prakriti representing the six Yogas. Durga refers to the Sakti of Hari that destroys fear, enemies, diseases and sins.The Sakti that bestows the highest bliss is called Siva. Abhaya refers to the destruction of fear. The Sakti that bestows prosperity and liberation is called Maya and Vishnu-bhakti. Narayani means born from half the body of Narayana. Jeya means granting victory".

 Several names of the Devi are here explained mostly by their root-meanings. They refer to the various stages of religious development in man, each of them being technically important and distinct in its use. It is not therefore enough to explain, like the Pandit that all these terms apply to the Devi. Every technical term in the sciences could otherwise be explained by any ignorant person as simply applying to the sciences. It will be clearly evident here that even single letters in the given names are separated into consonants and vowels and their vedic significance explained. When such detail explanations on doubtful points in the religious literature are not forth-coming from the Pandit, the correct inference is that he knows them not, and not that the texts are silent in the matter.

 ***Q. No. VI.***

 "Gayathri seated above the Bramhanda is described in the Vedas,as the eternal secret Vidya and the mother of all knowledge. She is in every created object and moves about in the sky. She is unseen and yet seen, she is Avyakta and yet Vyakta, she has no letters and yet has them, She is Bindumalini or crowned with Bindu. The Yogi ever seeing her obtains emancipation."

 This is a technical description of Gayatri whose detail explanation cannot be attempted here. It is enough to know that it refers to some serious religious matter that the Pandit is unable to explain at present.

*** Q. No. VII.***

 "Samvit is the real and ulitimate knowledge that Siva is the only reality. All that appears outside this knowledge is verily the Para-sakti the real form of Atma, destitute of the display of the material world. She should therefore be ever worshipped for the purpose of avoiding the miseries of Samsara".

 The Devi is here explained in the plainest terms as referring to the highest philosophical knowledge. Her worship is prescribed for the liberation of man from his bondage. Which of the sects of modern interpreters now stand in need of further information to be convinced of their ignorance and mistake? There are of course several varieties of the modern editions of this Devi,specially manufactured to help on the inclinations to drinks and animal. food. The Devi of aur ancient religion is however clearly explained in the quotation, as having no jurisdiction over this material world.

**आराधयेत्परां शक्तिं प्रपोञ्चोल्लासवर्जिताम्॥**

 ***Q. No. VIII.***

 "Govinda of Brindavana is the only Purusha or male. From Bramha downwards, all the Eswaras being the product of Prakriti fall under females. Savitri of hundred forms is the consort of Bramha and the mother of the seven-rishis, of Prejapatis and of all the Manus. The history of this Jegat is infinite in character like a heap of sand.The wise should therefore understand the reality as beyond it. In the Swayambhuva-manwantara, Mahishasura was killed by

Vyshnavi on the mount Mandara. He was afterwards killed by Nanda on the Vindhya mountains, in the Vyvaswata- manwantara The purport of this story is that Devi represents knowledge and Mahisha denotes ignorance. The Itihasas describe such matters in concrets forms. The wise describe me in the language of the Vedas. The divine Yoga-pittha is known as composed of all the letters.In the centre of it is Savithri, where Eswara with his consort resides. Vimalotkarshini, Gnana, Kriya, Yoga, Prehwi, Satya and Esana are the queens of Eswara".

 From the conception of Bramha downwards,everything is classed under Prakriti and styled feminine. The story of Mahisha is repeated in this quotation also, almost in the same words, and explained in the same manner. Most of the names of Devi here given, such as, Gnana, Kriya, Yoga, Satya &c., are too plain to be misunderstood as referring to beings in human form. The Pandit however would be glad to manufacture concrete forms for every word in the text, as he is unable to conceive anything useful without a tangible form for his artistic eye.

  "From the thigh of Narayana the eternal, Urvasi as the eleventh Apsara originated. Menaka is the daughter of Mena. All these Apsaras preach philosophy and represent Maha-yogas or great Yogas".

 The Apsaras represent different stages of attainment in the practice of Yoga and allude more particularly to the Sidhis or powers resulting therefrom. They are not therefore the common dancing girls in heaven as the Pandit would explain, perhaps somewhat better-looking and better decorated. The religious heaven is certainly not the abode of

débauchery and concubinage which the Pandit is evidently longing for as the summum bonum of his present existence.

**न गम्यो मन्त्राणां न भवति च भैषज्यविषयो  
न चापिप्रध्वंसं व्रजतिविविधैरशान्तिकरणैः।  
भ्रमावेशादःकिमपि विदधत् भङ्गमसकृत्  
स्मरापस्मारोयं भ्रमयति दृशौ घूर्णयति च॥**

<MISSING_FIG href="../../../../../books_images/U-IMG-1699188953Screenshot(38"/>.png)It is clearly evident from the above few quotations that the Saktis described refer invariably to the processes of originating as well as fostering Gnana or true knowledge. They represent the latent powers of the Absolute capable of developing, when properly invoked, the necessary faculties in man leading to religious advancement in their respective directions. As stated in quotations 4 and 8 in the most unequivocal terms possible, the descriptions of these Saktis as Goddesses, are in strict conformity with the formulas followed in the Itihasas for their usual representations in a concrete form. The object of worshipping them or virtually practising the required virtues and religious devotion, is certainly the attainment of spiritual knowledge and freedom from bondage, and not the securing of material benefits especially of a kind that will undoubtedly block up the straight path to salvation, and will immensely increase the miseries consequent on avarice and greed. All the prevailing ideas of satisfying mean and selfish desires are therefore entirely out of the question and it is the complete ignorance of this fact that gives rise to most of the mistaken interpretations and ridiculous and abominable practices which generally pass under the garb of religious ceremonies and rituals.

**निष्कामानामेव श्रीविद्यासिद्धिः।  
न कदापि सकामानामिति॥**

**सौभाग्यलक्ष्म्युपनिषत्॥**

  The worship of Sakti is intended for the advancement of those who have relinquished worldly desires and will never prove useful or effective to the worldly inclined.

**लोके व्यवायामिवमद्यसेवा नित्यास्तु जन्तोः न हि तत्र चोदना।  
व्यवस्थितिस्तेषु विवाहयज्ञ सुराग्रहैरासु निवृित्तोरष्टा॥**

**श्रीमद्भागवतम्।**

 The religious texts never treat of the means of satisfying man's desires for women, animal food or intoxicating drinks. They are naturally sought for without special instructions. But the main object of religion is to rescue man from falling a victim to their consequent evils, by checking and reducing his objectionable propensities in that direction.

 It is not difficult to understand from the definitions given in the passages quoted above, that the names of Goddesses, such as, Mula-Prakriti, Maya, Saraswathi, Savitri, Gayatri, Parvathy,Lakshmi, Radha, Durga, Amba, Gowri, Narayani, Samvit, Para-Sakti &c, all refer to the ultimate Sakti not different from Gnana or true knowledge of the Absolute. The knowledge of Bramhan as distinguished from Bramhan itself, although the Sakti is its own, is the idea conveyed in the representations of Goddesses. The functions of the ultimate Sakti comprising creation, preservation and destruction cannot possibly therefore be mistaken for Agnana or ignorance with all its existing paraphernalia, known as the material world and its varying cosmological conceptions as formed by each individual. The Goddesses represented thus clearly point to the latent powers the Absolute which may be profitably invoked for helping on in our march through the path of Gnana to the ultimate goal.

 The sub-saktis of Eswari enumerated in quotation 3 are, Santi,Vidya, Prathishta and Nivriti, Vishnu-maya

is described as the same as Vishnu-bhakti in quotation 5. Urvasi, Menaka &c., are distinctly stated in quotation 9, as the different processes of Yoga; and they are generally described as the free women of the Heavens, as they are accessible to all who court them.

 No clearer passages are needed nor could be obtained to explain the real import of these representations of Goddesses. But the passages above culled out from various texts should be understood as exclusively meant for those who seek for truth with sympathy and interest, and I dare say the original texts themselves were composed only for the benefit of such of them.

**अश्रद्धालोरविश्वासो नोदाहरणमर्हति।  
श्रद्धालुरपि सर्वत्र वैदिकेष्वधिकारतः॥**

**अज्ञश्चाश्रद्दधानश्च संशयात्मा विनश्यति।

<MISSING_FIG href="../../../../../books_images/U-IMG-1699190290Screenshot(39"/>.png)Besides the Tri-murtis and the limited number of Goddesses already noticed, there are innumerable personages whose names commonly occur in the religious texts. No less than 33 crores of Devas are said to inhabit the Swarga-loka with their consorts, rulers, administrators and religious preceptors. They have a sufficiently large number of permanent enemies known as the Asuras. Similarly, a good number of Bramha-Rishis, Deva-Rishis, Raja-Rishis and Pitris as well as their families appear in the descriptions of their respective regions. An examination of their personal characteristics and whereabouts is absolutely necessary to complete the present section. The enumeration and description of the Devas may be first examined.

 ***Quotation No. I.***

 "The wise Sakalya asked Yagna-valkya, 'how many Devas are there'? He replied that the Devas allude to the Nivid or the indication of the glories of the Lord of Viswa. Sakalya repeated the question and Yagna-valkya said that the Devas are 33 crores in number, the crores alluding simply to their glories. The correct number 33 is made up of 8 Vasus, 11Rudras, 12 Adityas, Soma and Prejapathi. The Vasus are, fire, earth, air, Akasa, Aditya, sky, moon and the stars. They are called Vasus because they hold all the substance of the world. The Rudras are 10 Pranas or breaths and the Atma, they are so named because they make a noise when they leave this mortal body. The Adityas represent the 12 months in the year; they are so named because they extract everything from this world. Indra is lightning and Prejapathi is Yegna or devotion known also as Pasus. The Devas are classified differently into 6, 3, 2, 11/2 and 1. Fire. earth, air, Akasa, Aditya and sky make up the 6. The three Lokas make up the 3. Annom or Avyakrita and Prana make up the 2. The air that expands everything is Adhyardha or 11/2. The Prana is the single Deva and it is known as Bramhan".

 From the eternal Bramhan,the classification of the Devas is extended to 33 crores. The Devas are said to be the Nivid of the Lord of Viswa, and Nivid means a Vedicin randomconcerning some special glory of the Lord. The description of a Deca is thus clearly some special instruction given to man suited to his receptive capacities, for the purpose of understanding the real nature of the Lord. The Pandit no doubt expects to see in his heaven, some of his favourite Devas in the form of royal personages, and more particularly the Apsaras or heavenly damsels, about whom he is dreaming all his life. He is determined to convert the holy heaven into an earthly brothel.

**मुक्ताफलैः किं मृगपक्षिणां च मिष्टान्नपानं किमु गर्दभानाम्।  
अन्धस्य दीपो बधिरस्य गीतं मूर्खस्य किं धर्मकथाप्रसङ्गः॥**

*** Q. No. II.***

 "The light that blazes in the right eye is called Indra, and that in the left is Virat, Indra's wife.The Devas as a class hate corporeality and they are fond of spirituality. The path leading to their discovery starts from the Akasa in the heart. Several Nadis proceed upwards from this spot and the one named Hita remains in the heart itself. The rest flow in different directions from this body of the Atman".

 The modern pandit is sure to find the whole of this passage Greek to him. Why should the Devas hate materiality ? How is Indra in the right eye and his consort in the left? The Devas represent the senses lighted up with real knowledge. When they follow the Pandit in his desire for material objets, they lose their status and become Asuras. Regarding Indra and his wife we will obtain fuller informtion shortly. Again, several Nadis are said to spread themselves from the Akasa of the heart. How could Nadis or

tubular vessels as the Pandit understands them, originate from the vacuum specified? These Nadis always represent the directions and tendencies of the currents of human thought, which the Pandit evidently does not understand, and he doubtless expects to see them clearly in the post morten examination. Under the present state of his ignorance and uncouth obstinacy, he must be given credit for his wisdom in expecting to see his conceptions of religious items realised only in the dead body.

 ***Q. No. III.***

 "Just as a merchant who takes personal care of his business and understands the real nature of his work, becomes wealthy, the status of Indra is secured. When Indra does not perceive the Atma, the Asuras over-power him. But when Indra perceives the Atma, he destroys the Asuras, obtains mastery over the elements and becomes the great Emperor."

 Indra is here clearly explained as one who secures the knowledge of Atma. When this knowledge is absent, the Asuras over-power him. Victory over the Asuras and sovereignty in heaven, are plainly mentioned as depending upon the real knowledge of the Self.This is certainly not the Pandit's Indra, whom the Pandit expects to please by his unphilosophical, irreligious and out-casting acts of cruelty and immorality under the guise of religious rituals, by virtue of which Indra condescends to procure our venerable Pandit with the best damsels available in heaven, for the satisfaction of his low carnal cravings. If Indra does not serve the Pandit in this important matter, he is not worth the name and position assigned to him. This is exactly the type of the Pandit, we are unfortunately destined to have at present, in our midst, to seek religious instructions from. 'Misery

acquaints a man with strange bed-fellows', said Shakespeare one day, and we are surely in a worse predicament now.

 ***Q. No. IV.***

  "Indh, means lighting up, or creating or perceiving. Indra, thus represents the Prana-vayu, or life principle, which remaining within the body, sets up the five vital airs in motion. He is otherwise known as Kshetregna. He exhibits the glories of the Atman to those who take to religious devotion and practice of Yoga. Indrani is known as his wife seated in the middle of Indra and Varuna".

 Indra, is clearly mentioned here, as a synonym applying to Kshethregna. His Sakti is Indrani. Indra helps only those who take to the worship of Atman. The Pandit therefore cannot hope to please this Indra, as his desire for heavenly damsels is not certainly the worship of Atman here specified. His present devotional spirit however, cannot go without its due reward. The general rule for karmic effects is plainly enunciated in the Bhagavat-Gita.

**यं यं वापि स्मारन्नित्यं त्यजत्यन्ते कलेबरम्।  
तं तमेवेति कौन्तेय सदा तद्भावभावितः॥**

'He who dies with the thought of the object he has been incessantly meditating upon during his life-time, will attain to it in his next birth. The Pandit has thus the best chance of being born as a menial servant of some notorious and devilish wench, not far from his own nativity. His life-long ambition being exactly in this direction, he is sure to feel highly elated at this happy prediction.

**नो सत्येन मृगाङ्क एव वदनीभूतो न चेन्दीवर

*** Q. No. V.***

 "From the Ahamkara called Vykarika, the creation of the ten senses and also of mind, took place simultaneously. These eleven instruments of perception are known as Vykarika Devas. From the back side of Bramha, the Asuras originated. Asu means Prana or life and those who follow its ways are called Asuras. When Bramha abandoned the form of his body from which he created the Devas, the night came immediately. The Devas having originated from Bramha's face shining, and having been produced out of Bramha's divine and shining body, they are called the Devas. The word Natha refers to a ruler. Indra represents the ruler of the three Lokas and he is the chief deity for worship in every Manwantara. The Indras are the great Rajahs and fathers of all, as they righteously protect the world. The Yekshas, Gendharvas Rakshasas, Pisachas, Uragas, and Danavas allude to the glories of Indra. The division of the four castes and of the four Asramas are based upon the eight stages from Bramha to Pisacha. The eight Sidhis commencing with Anima are their perceptible effects. They represent the unobstructed forms of Prakriti in their regular order".

 This is an important quotation furnishing plenty of technical informations. The ten senses and the mind aredefined as Vykarika Devas. They are called Devas because of their shining brightness and they originated from Bramba's face during his day time. The Asuras originated from his back-side during his night. The Asuras are clearly explained here as alluding to the materialistic tendencie in man.

**असुः प्राणः स्मृतो विप्रास्तज्जन्मानस्ततोऽसुराः॥**

 Again, Indra the chief of the Devas is explained as the righteous ruler of the three Lokas, and Yekshas, Gendharvas

&c., as alluding to his glories. The eight Sthanas or status, the eight Sidhis and the four castes and Asramas are said to be mutually connected and refer therefore to the specified glories of Indra. Indra has been already found to represent Kshetregna or the individual soul of man, and all else stated here, therefore refer to the divine stages attainable by man in his practice of devotion and Tapas as prescribed by the Sastras. The three Lokas ruled over by Indra and protected by him do not therefore include this material world. It is entirely outside the limits of the Lokas of the Devas, and is completely reserved for the Asuras. The Pandit need not be frightened at this news. The Asuras will not drive him out of this world. They are only his yet unrecognised friends and relatives who have great sympathy and love for him. The mankind in general belongs to this Asura creation, born from the back of Bramha during his night. Until man goes round and stands before Bramha, he will be treated as an Asura in our religious literature. When he meets Bramha's face he will be converted into a Deva. This is the substance of the Puranic description quoted above. In this quotation, the necessary clues for the religious division of castes and Asramas are given, as connected with the eight Sidhis and the eight stages or forms of Prakriti.

**वर्णाश्रमाणां धर्मोऽयं देवस्थानेषु कारणम्।  
अष्टावेतानि रूपाणि प्राकृतानि यथाक्रमम्॥**

The real significance of the distinctions pointed out would be found as scientific and practical as any other scientific and useful matter. It may be necessary perhaps to note here that all modern attempts to establish the mere importance of external forme as appear at present, would be unscientific and unauthorised, equally so would be all prejudiced and whimsical efforts to deny their scientific character, without going

into their technical application and without a study of the most serious and useful subject ever brought to light in the eternal interest of mankind. The modera off-hand views expressed by professional Critics against caste and Asramas, without understanding even the definition of the terms, display not only prejudice and indifference, but also a lamentable weakness and a serious defect in the so-called civilization of the current era.

** *Q. No. VI.***

 "The Devas, Asuras, Gendharvas, Yekshas, Rakshasas, Pannagas, Pisachas, cattle, beast, birds and shrubs are the issues of Kasyapa by Dakshayinis or daughters of Deksha, known as the Loka-mathas. As they are all found in the nature of man, these Devas are known as the Manushya-Prakriti, or the various characteristics of human nature. These children of the Loka-mathas inherit the good and bad qualities of their respective mothers. Aditi is noted for Dharma; Diti for power; Surabhi for Tapas; Denu for Maya; Muni for smell; Krodha for religion; Arishta for music; Khasa for cruelty; Kadru for anger; Kroda for purity; Vinata for learning; Thamra for harm; Ira for blessing and Anayu for eating. As all these Devas appear in man in the Manwantaras, and as man is the fit creation for securing Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha, he is reckoned as a great being. The Devas and Asuras are again and again born in man as Arwak-srotas or inclined hitherwards".

 The above explains purely the human Psychology, the Devas, Gendharvas &c., alluding to the senses and internal emotions &c. The Loka-mathas clearly represent their respective faculties and the Lokas denote the nervous centres

or seats of these faculties. There is however nothing in this general Puranic description deserving immediate condemnation as unscientific or unphilosophical. If the whole of the technical subject is deeply studied, we are sure to find valuable Psychological facts. But it is enough for our present purpose to know that the Devas, Asuras, Gendharvas &c., allude to human nature under various conditions. The Pandit's mistake and ignorance in the conception of these gods and devils, described in our religious literature, are here sufficiently exposed, and it would be uncharitable to criticise the deluded Critic who depended entirely upon the Pandit in obtaining matter for his operations.

** *Q. No. VII.***

 "Individualities originate from generalities and the Devas originate from the latter. Hari is the protector of both. Hari transformed as Rudra is their destroyer. Hiranyagerbha originated from the totality of the internal organs of the Devas. Similarly, Sutratma originated from the totality of Pranas. From the totality of the five Gnanaindrias, the Devas known as Dic or space, air, sun, water and earth sprang up. From the totality of the five Karmaindrias such as foot, hand &c., the Devas known as Trivikrama, Indra &c., arose. These Devas are the guiding principles of the individual senses, namely, air for touch; space for ear; sun for the eye; Varuna for taste; earth for smell, fire for speech; Prejapati for the generative organ; Mitra for the excretive organ; Trivikrama for the foot; Indra for the hand; and Siva is the general controller. The four internal organs are, Manas, Budhi, Ahamkara and Chitha, presided over by the moon, Brihaspati, Kalagnirudra and Siva respectively. In this material body of man composed of the five elements and six Kosas or sheaths, all

the Devas and the highest Tatwa reside. The five Devas reside in the five elements in the body. Bramha is in the earthy portion, Vishnu in water, Rudra in fire, Eswara in air and Sadasiva in Akasa. Outside the body is Virat, inside is Swarad and in the middle is Samraud. In the ten senses, their respective Devas specified above, reside. Hiranyagerbha is in the internal organs in general, in the hair are the lower orders of Devas; in the bones are Bhutas and Pretas; in the tendons are Pisachas and Rakshasas, in the marrow, Pithris and Gendharvas, in the skin, flesh and blood, the Devas. Bramha's violent portion is insile the right eye and the sun is outside it as the ruling Devas. Bramha's tranquil portion is inside the left eye and the moon is outside it. Vishnu is in the throat, his tranquil portion being inside and the violent portion outside. Similarly Rudra's tranquil portion is inside the heart and the violent portion outside it. The Bramhan, the original source of all is in the Bramharendhra or brain. The Chit-Sakti is in the centre of the body. Mayasakti is at the top of the fore-head. Parasakti or Nada is in the centre of the fore-head. Just below it is Bindu, within which the Jiva-atma or life principle resides in its subtle form. It resides in the heart in its Sthula form, and in the centre of the body in its intermediate form. Saraswati, the wife of Bramha and Goddess of learning is in the tip of the tongue. Lekshmi, Parvati and Rudra are in Aushata or the heart. The eternal Siva is everywhere. In the body of Gnanis, all the Devas are seen in their involutionary attitude and also in the form of Devas here specified. In the body of the merely religious, the Devas are seen but not in their involutionary attitude. In the body of the Tantriks, the Devas exist but are not seen owing to want of purity. In the ordinary people, the Devas remain hidden. The human body is thus filled with Devas

and those who care for happiness and emancipation must ever treat with respect one's own body as well as the bodies of others".

 All the Devas are here localised in the human body and their individual functions are also clearly defined. They are the guides, controllers and protectors of human thought and action. They are said to remain hidden in the body of the ordinary man who has no religious devotion.

**यथाजातजनानान्तु शरीरे सर्वदेवताः।  
तिरोभूततया नित्यं वर्तन्ते मुनिसत्तमाः॥**

In the body of the Tantriks, the Devas exist but do not shine forth owing to want of sufficient purity.

**तान्त्रिकाणां शरीरे तु देवताः सकला अमूः।  
वर्तन्ते न प्रकाशन्ते द्विजेन्द्राः शुद्ध्यभावतः॥**

In the bodies of those who obey the injunctions of the Vedas in their religious devotions, the Devas appear in their true forms but not in their involutionary attitude.

**वेदमार्गैकनिष्ठानां विशुद्धानान्तु विहे।  
देवतारूपतो भान्तिं द्विजा न प्रत्यगात्मना॥**

Again in the body of the Gnani, the Devas shine forth in their true forms and also appear in their involutionary attitude displaying the glories of the soul.

**सम्यक्ज्ञानवतां देहे देवताः सकला अमूः॥  
प्रत्यगात्मतया भान्ति देवतारूपतोऽपि च॥**

Four varieties of human body are here clearly defined and the action of the Devas in each variety is also plainly explained. The first one is the body of the irreligious or entirely worldly. All the Devas are said to conceal themselves in the body. The Devas are shining entities, and their description as hidden plainly means that all kinds of

religious knowledge and good qualities are absent in the man and that he is worse than a beast. Secondly the body of the Tantrik who is credited only with an inclination to be religious but not with any devotional spirit originating from the respect for the Vedas. Here, the Devas exist but they never shine forth. In the third variety of the body of the religious and devotional, the Devas are said to shine forth. This plainly refers to the most harmless conduct and the loving sympathy of the good man towards his fellow beings. Here too, the Devas do not appear in their pristine purity. Until their direction is turned internally froin the material side, they do not exhibit their full glory. In the body of the Gnani, all the Devas internally shine forth in their true glory, and in relation to the outside world, the Gnani exhibits his most benevolent and sympathetic tendencies. A more detailed description of the Devas and of their actions. is unnecessary in any religious dissertation for their proper comprehension. The facts noticed explain the plain and admitted differences between the good and the bad, the virtuous and the vicious, the religious and the irreligious, the philosophical and the unphilosophical. There is no mystery, no occultism, no humbug, no confusion, no cheating, no pompous display. Everything is simple, reasonable, religious and respectable truth whose real value shall never be destroyed or diminished by the evil work of man or time.

**आयुःकल्लोललोलं कतिपयदिवसस्थायिनी यौवनश्री-  
रर्थाः सङ्कल्पकल्पा घनसमयतटिद्विभ्रमाभोगपूराः।  
कण्ठाश्लेषोपगूढं तदपि च न चिरं यत्प्रियाभिः प्रणीतम्  
ब्रह्मण्यासक्तविता भवत भवभयाम्भोधिपारं तरीतुम्॥**

** *Q. No. VIII.***

 "There are two kinds of creation here, namely, the Dyva and the Asura. Fearlessness, Satwic-purity, steadi-

ness in Gnana and Yoga, harmlessness, truthfulness, resignation and other good qualities are classed under the former; pride, prejudice, egoism, anger, ignorance and other bad qualities are classed under the latter creation. Attachment to the virtuous items leads to emancipation, that to the vicious ones leads to bondage".

 This is a more practical classification of human nature into Dyva and Asura. It does not however make it a hopeless classification of unchangeable existing facts as is generally misunderstood. It includes within it the possibility of converting the Asura into Dyva and of reducing the Dyva into Asura. The affirmation of this possibility is more important here in the real interest of man's welfare,and it would be inexcusable wickedness to ignore it. The Pandit here will discover to his greatest surprise that the Devas and the Asuras have their abodes, within himself, and that he is personally responsible for his choice in serving the one or the other. His very actions which please the Asuras displease the Devas and vice versa. If he thinks that it is better to reign in hell than to serve in heaven, he becomes a Satan and not a human being. From the above enquiries we can clearly understand, that the Asuras in spite of their greater affinity and sympathy with the existing man, deserve to be mercilessly abandoned as treacherous enemies, and that the favour of the Devas is worth seeking with any amount of  
trouble and inconvenience.

**क्षान्तं न क्षमया गृहोचितसुखं त्यक्तं न सन्तोषतः  
सोढा दुःसहशीतवाततपनक्लेशा न तप्तं तपः।  
ध्यातं वित्तमहर्निशं नियमितप्राणैर्नशम्भोः पदम्  
तत्तत्कर्मकृतं यदेव मुनिभिस्तैस्तैः फलैर्वञ्चितम्॥**

 **5. **The passages quoted here referring to the Gods are somewhat simple and explicit. In quotation 1, thirty-

three Devas are enumerated and their multiples by hundreds and thousands making up 33 crores, den te only their glories or the immense varieties of functions each is capable of. A crore or koti ordinarily points to the highest number. In quotation 4, eleven Davas or Vykarikas are mentioned, representing the 10 senses and the mind. The first 3 quotations place the position and status of Indra beyond doubt. He is the same as Kshetregna or Individual soul often noticed in the preceding pages. The Yekshas, Rakshasas, Danavas, Gendharvas mentioned in quotations 4 and 5, refer to the glories of Indra as viewed in different aspects, and virtually represent the characteristic tendencies in man. Quotation 6 locates all of them in the various parts of the human body and refers to the deities presiding over the Vasanas, meaning thereby the respective energies or enforcing laws of the the Eswara, which remain as the bases for the formation and work of the Vasanas. The Vasauas formed being generally good or bad in accordance with the nature of the individual's Karmas, their tendencies are classified as Dyva or sura, leading to salvation and perdition respectively. The enumeration given in quotation 1, from 33 crores downwards reducing the number to one at last, clearly explains the gist of the whole matter, without the least scope for doubt, ambiguity or reasonable possibility of extraneous interpretations. The Dyvi and the Asuri tendencies in man, explained in the last quotation from the Bhagavat-Gita include the Rakshasi according to recognised commentaries. The Asuri refers only to the evil tendencies originating from selfish desires, but the Rakshasi specifies the inclinations to acts of cruelty in man. In quotation 4, we find the root meaning of the word Asura explained. Asu means Prana or life; thus denoting the tendency to seek after material comforts in the interest of the physical body. Besides these

general descriptions of human tendencies, the technical terms used such as, Yekshas, Gendhervas, Pisachas &c., refer to the glories of Indra as already noticed, and are explained clearly at the end of quotation 4, as representing the eight divine stages resulting from Yoga practice. They correspond to the eight Sidhis, such as, Anima, Mahima &c., which bestow control over the eight Prakritis respectively. Thus far the descriptions given are no doubt clear enough. If only the method of treatment of the subject, as followed in the religious literature, is not misunderstood, it is not at all difficult to make out the descriptions given, as exactly pertaining to the Psychological and physiological sciences. The ignorance of this method of treatment so evident in the popular misinterpretations, is nevertheless not so surprising or dangerous as the learned absurdities of the Theosophical elucidations. The attempt of that creed to explain away Eastern religion by Western commentaries favourably or otherwise, is entirely futile and unnecessarily misleading. Seriously considered, their main object as generally propogated, appears to be prima-facie objectionable, especially in a religious light. It is ordinarily supposed that the Theosophists are trying only to pick up the best portions of every existing religion and combine the whole with the most valuable discoveries of modern science for the benefit of all man-kind. It is not however certain whether this would prove useful to the public in any manner, even if it were ever practicable, but at any rate, it might have been wiser and less harmful, if they started a new religion of their own, as it would be liable to stand or fall on its own merits without affecting the others. The process in question doubtless implies, at the very commencement, an undesirable disrespectful and unmeritted insinuation upon the disinterested efforts of the most venerable originators of every religion,

who are naturally and reasonably understood as having been persons of immense wisdom, sympathy aud religious devotion, and are acknowledged as fit and competent mediators between God and man, in the interest of the latter. That their earnest productions called religions should be so freely and so easily taken to contain 99 per cent of worthless stuff and consequently requiring to pick up the remaining valuable portions, if any, from their midst, is, I daresay in itself a sure sign of ignorance, insolence and irreligion. It is extremely doubtful whether a single member could be found in this new creed, fit to come forward boldly as having acquired a thorough and correct knowledge of any one religion, much less of all religions or all sciences even. The process adopted for surveying in one glance all the existingreligions in the world and for extracting their essences as one chemical product, must necessarily remain a divine secret for ever. Nor is it sufficiently intelligible how the results of modern material sciences, could have retrospective effect upon ancient spiritual religions, and why the latter should ever care for or depend upon the help of the former.

 With reference to the Yekshas, Danavas, Rakshasas, Genthervas &c., so clearly explained in soveral of the passages just quoted, it is impossible to pass over without noticing that the description offered in the Theosophical fashion noted below, will unhesitatingly prove how completely it is wrong and how far away it is, from the truth.

 'Sanathana-Dharma' by Mrs. Besant, page 87 Chapter II 'On the Many'.

 "To this brief sketch of the world process it should be added that the early human races preceding the Aryan are often referred to under the names of Danavas and Daityas, huge beings of enormous strength and energy, who carried

on many a struggle with the Devas themselves. The Rakshasas were another race, more brutal in nature, usually malformed, huge, cruel, powerful, cannibals, the terror of milder races. They possessed moreover, many magical secrets of a dark kind, which they used for terrorising and oppressing. All these have long entirely disappeared from the earth".

 I humbly trust that the irrelevancy and the absurdity of the above elucidation are self-evident; and there is no doubt that many or most of the important items in our sacred religion are dealt with in this off-hand and ridiculous manner. The very nature of the commencement of this special and curious kind of work strikes one clearly as an unnecessary, profitless and pernicious effort, inevitably doomed.

**"Begun in folly ended in disgrace  
Fit consummation of an earthly race".**

**आगमैस्सदृशारम्भः।  
आरम्भसदृशोदयः॥**

 **6.** The significance of the Pitris may be enquired into next, as they are often found apparently confounded with the Devas just noticed. They however deserve a closer examination for the reason that they are commonly understood to be directly connected with and sometimes even representing our own departed ancestors. Besides, they are considered to be more in touch with the human race than the Devas or other Gods.

 ***Quotation. No. I.***

 "Bramha concentrated his mind and brought out of it the Tan-mathras or subtle elements. He meditated upon the forms of everything and these elements originated from his body in smoky colour. Bramha saw them seated in the organic world and looking upwards. He said that they shall be the Pitris or fathers of all the Griha-imedhins. Those that looked up were specially named Nandi-mukhas. Bramha also prescribed a path for the Pitris called Dekshinayana".

 The Pitris are here clearly defined as representing the subtle elements, originating from Bramha, seated in the organic world and looking upwards. They are however saidto be the Pitris only of Griha-medhins or intelligent and pure people. The elements in themselves are naturally the fathers, originators or the material cause for all existing things. But the term Pitris is here restricted to their conception as pure and leading upwards, all the material associations leading downwards being entirely eliminated. We will see more of this in the subsequent quotations.

**  *Q. No II.***

 "The subtle elements are known as Tan-mathras, because they remain pure and unmixed. They are also called Aviseshas, because they are not perceptible and are devoid of the three qualities known as Santa, Ghora and Mudha. The creation by the subtle elements is by their intermixture, producing the gross elements known as Visesha and perceptible by the senses, each element possessing its own quality as well as the qualities of the elements preceding. Bramha created the Pitris from both of his sides, at the interval between day and night. Bramba's form in the middle of day and night is thus more glorious, and the Rishis, Devas, Asuras and Manus therefore worship that form with great devotion. The Devas were created in the

day time and the Asuras at night. The day is Satwic, the night is Tamasic and the interval is Sandya when a great light proceeded from Bramha. The Pitris grant the boon of knowledge and are therefore worshipped by Sradhas. The Pitris by their Yoga then please the Soma, the protector of the three Lokas. In the Sradha ceremonies therefore, Yogis should be procured as far as possible, because the strength of the Pitris depends on their Yoga which produces Soma. Here Soma represents the ocean of Akasa which is the basis for all the elements and the Devas. All the Lowkik water proceeds from this Akasic Soma which supports the universe. This is the real fact. The six seasons of the year called Ritus are explained in the Sastras as Pitris and Devas. Among the Pitris, the Agni-hotris or worshippers of fire are known as Berhishads, those who do not so worship are Agnishwathas and those who perform Somayegna are Somapithis".

 The Pitris have been already explained as representing the subtle elements. Yoga is here said to be their distinguishing feature. They are created at Sandhya or between the day and night of Bramha which refer to the creations of Devas and Asuras. This Puranic narration distinctly explains the significance of the Pitris. The creation of the Pitris thus points out the transition stage from the Asuri to the Dyvi nature, from materiality to the religious and philosophical. The Yoga pertaining to Tan-mathras and leading to the higher states of philosophical meditation is here enunciated. By satisfying the Pitris, Soma is said to be pleased. The technical Soma is an entirely misunderstood and highly abused term, among the Sanskrit Pandits and the so-called Vydiks at present. The Yegnas or devotional acts misinterpreted as prescribing the killing of sheep and drinking of liquor, originate chiefly from the ignorance of the meaning

of the term Soma. We have noticed its real significance already in several places and it is here defined particularly in connection with the very Sradha ceremonies, leaving no scope for misunderstanding.

**पितॄणां हि बलं योगो योगात् सोमः प्रवर्तते।  
आकाशाम्भोनिधेर्योसौ सोम इत्यभिधीयते।  
आधारः सर्वभूतानां देवानाममृताकरः।  
सर्वलौकिकमन्भो वै यत् सोमान्नभसः स्मृतम्।  
सोमाधारं जगत्सर्वं एतत्तथ्यं प्रकीर्तितम्॥**

Soma here represents the Chit-Akasa, a stage superior to the Tan-mathras or Pitris, alluding to a perfectly pure, devotional and tranquil state of mind. This Soma can never be pleased by acts of cruelty or ignorance, actuated by avarice, greed, hatred and all other associates of the modern interpretation of Yeguss. यज्ञो वै विष्णुः \। Devotion to Vishnu or Vishnu himself is Yegna according to the Vedas. This sacred religious precept has now unfortunately deteriorated so far as to signify the abominable ceremonies of a butcher and a drunkard.

**यूपान् छित्वा पशून् हत्वा कृत्वा रुधिरकर्दमम्।  
यद्येवं गम्यते स्वर्गे नरके केन गम्यते॥**

** *Q. No. III.***

 "In the heavens, there are seven classes of Pitris, three of them are formless, but four of them have forms. The formless classes belong to the Virat, they are worshipped by the Devas and are known as Vyrajas. The class of Pitris who secure liberation only at the end of Bramha's day owing to their incomplete Yoga, has & mind-born daughter named Mena, the wife of Himavat. Minaka is his son and Krowncha his son, from whom the name Krowncha-dwipa originated. Mens gave birth to three daughters, all Yoginis, named Uma, Ekaparna and Aparna, married to Rudra,

Bhrigu and Jygishavya respectively. The Lokas of the Pitris are called Somapatha, or the path to Soma. The Pitris named Agnishwathas and Yejwanas, the sons of Maricha or light, reside in these Lokas, and they are worshipped by the Devas. A similar class of Pitris belonging to the same family, sons of Angira called Havishmanthas, reside in the Sun They are very kind and loving towards their devotees. The chief among them is the Sun. The Sradha ceremony is of three kinds, Nithya or daily, Nymithika or occasional, and Kamya or optional. Among the Bramhins, when the father dies, the sons should perform the Sradha known as Ekodhishta, extending to ten days, at the end of which, the deceased attains to the position of a fourth class Pitri, and afterwards obtains immortality among the three classes of Pitris. The Vedas say that the father takes the form of Vasus, the grandfather that of Rudras and the great-grand-father, that of Adityas".

 We could easily see from this quotation that the varieties of Pitris enumerated, allude to certain religious and philosophical facts, and that the Sradha ceremonies prescribed are meant for taking the deceased ancestors to the positions åssigned to the Pitris. We shall soon see more of this in detail.

**  *Q. No. IV.***

 "The Pitris are the sons of the original Devas, and they are adored by the Devas, Dana vas, men, Yekshas, Rakshasas, Gendharvas, Kinnaras and Mahoragas. When the Pitris are pleased, they please all by bestowing blessings; therefore Bramha ordered all people to perform Sradhas to the Pitris. When the Devas were created by Bramha, theywere asked to worship him. Disobeying this order, the Devas looked after their own interest. They were therefore cursed by Bramha to become ignorant. Then they begged

for pardon. Bramha asked them to go to Pitris and get enlightened. The Devas did accordingly and when they left the Pitris, the latter addressed the Devas as sons. The Devas returned and informed Bramha of all this, and Bramha replied that the Devas are not bestowers of Gnana but only of rebirths and that they shall therefore be reckoned as sons of the Pitris. Thus the Pitris and the Devas became mutually sons and fathers. When the Pitris are pleased by Sradhas, Soma is pleased and Soma pleases the Lokas. The Pitris being everywhere, in the ocean, in the hills, in the movable and in the immovable, wherever the three balls of rice are offered at the Sradha, saying the name and gotra of the deceased ancestors, the Pitris grant their blessings. The Pitris sholud be worshipped invariably before the Devas"

 The paradox in the mutual parentage of the Devas and the Pitris shall be explained shortly. But we must not fail to notice that the Pandit is acquainted with the cake and the bread alone in the Sradhas here described. The Soma perhaps makes up the necessary drink. The gift of a few coins at the end will perfectly complete the Sradha ceremony.

** *Q. No. V.***

 "In the Swayambhuva Manwantara, Devas, Asuras and men originated from the body of Bramha. From both his sides, the Pitris originated who respected Bramha as their father. The Vedas and Sastras say that the Rithus or the six seasons in the year are the Devas and Pitris. The Pitris are of three classes, Agnishwathas, Somapithis and Berhishadas. The Rithus are six in number each consisting of two months, named, Sisira, Vasanta, Grishma, Varsha, Sarad and Hima. They are known as the sons of Nimi. They signify the guiding and controlling power of Bramh a in conducting the seasons and not the seasons them–

selves. They are so named as they are recognised only by the working of these seasons. Nimisha, kala, kashta, Muhurta, day, night and month are divisions of time. Two months make one Rithu, three Rithus one Ayana and two Ayanas one year. The sons of Rithus are the five Arthavas referring to the productive seasons of all created things. They are known as Pitris or fathers and the year as grand-father and Prejapathi. The terms used refer only to the power of conducting the seasons. Agni or fire, the son of Samvatsara is called Rita. From Rita, the Ritavas originated and from them the five Arthavas. There are different kinds of Pitris like the Agnishwathas and Berhishadas. Two daughters, both Yoginis and philosophers, named Mena and Dharani were born from the minds of Agnishwathas and Berhishadas respectively. Mena married Himavat and gave birth to Mynaka as well as Ganga the wife of the ocean. Krowncha is the son of Mynaka from whom Krowncha-dwipa took its naine. Dharani married Meru and brought forth Mandara and three daughters named, Vela, Niyati and Ayati. Ayati married Dhata and Niyati, Vidhata. I shall next narrate to you the Pitris to whom monthly sradhas are offered. They are known as Anu-deva-pitris. It is difficult to know even with great tapas the conditions of the deceased, more so with human eyes. By a mere analogical correspondence in the karmas of the religious people, they are also styled after death, Agnishwathas, Somapas and Berhishadas, but they are not the real Pitris signified by the terms. Those who lead a very honourable life until their death, practising the prescribed devotional acts, join the Pitris and the Devas in heaven, and they are propitiated by monthly Sradhas like the real Pitris. But for those who were wicked and irreligious all their life, and now keep running about as Pretas in the Hell undergoing punishment, three balls of rice should be placed on the ground over the Derbha grass.

There are others who have taken after death, the bodies of lower animals or of vegetables. The rice offered in the Sradha reaches them in the special forins of their food by the force of Manthra as a calf naturally finds out its cow. This is assure 1 by the Rishi named Sanat-kumara who is gifted with divine eyes. These Pitris are known as Bahlikas, Ushiapas and Divakirtis. The dark fortnight is their day-time and the bright fortnight their night. Thus, the Pitris, the Devas, Rithus, Arthavas, half-months and months are mutually considered Pitris. When the Pitris, the Devas and Manushya-pitris are pleased by Sradhas, they bestow all blessings on man".

 The various classifications of the Pitris here furnished are po doubt highly technical and philosophical. The Pandit will of course reduce the whole description to the history of his deceased ancestors whose life is distinctly stated to be different from that of the real Pitris. The Pitris are said to have their children and grand-children. Mena and Dharani are their mind-born daughters, and Vela, Niyati, Ayati,. Uma, Ekaparna, Aparna aud Ganga are grand-daughters. The mountains named Mynaka, Mindara and Krowncha are grand and great grand-children. How could deceased ancestors produce daughters and how these daughters again bring forth mountains, rivers and girls? If the description on the whole is meaningless, why should the Pandit attempt to explain it ?

**पेटीचीवर पट्टवस्त्र पटलश्वेतातपत्र च्छटा  
शाटीहारक घोटकस्फुटघटाटोपाय तुभ्यं नमः।  
येनानक्षरकुक्षयोपि जगतःकुर्वन्ति सर्वज्ञता  
भ्रान्तिं येन विना तु हास्यपदवीं सन्तोषि कष्टङ्गताः॥**

 **7.**The passages quote l above furnish varieties of descriptions for the Pitris demanding special explanations

and particularly some sort of reconciliations amongst themselves. There is indeed a commingling of philosophical formulas and facts with the practical ethics concerning the display of veneration towards our personal ancestors. How nicely the grandest facts in religious philosophy are gratually brought down to the discharge of duties to our deceased parents, and how the comin only accepted moral necessity on the subject is taken advantage of to explain the higher and more serious matters, are excellently illustrated in the descriptions furnished.

 The respect due to our beloved parents and the cermonies called Sradhas to propitiate them after their death are matters of immediate concern which we could not afford to treat with any indifference. A correct. understanding of the application of the religious rites ordained is therefore of vital importance.

 Quotations 1 & 2 vividly detail the distinctions between the senses and the Tan-nathras or subtle elements, the former being known as the Devas and the latter as Pitris. The Puranic narration in quotation 4, of the story leading to the settlement of their parentage mutually, paradoxical as it appears, is but a statement of an important philosophical fact. The existence of the five subtle elements as the source or fathers of all creation, could not be conceived or inferred without using the fanctions of the senses, nor could the formations of the senses be explained without the help of the elements. They are thus mutual originators and therefore styled fathers mutually. But a characteristic difference is noted between them. The natural tendency of the senses as such is to proceed outwards cognising external objects. The conception of the Taumathras beyond the sphere of the senses virtually creates a process of involution by Yogic exercises leading to Guana or true knowledge. The

following lines in the above quotations furnish sufficiently explicit clues to enable us to avoid all possibilities of is-m understanding.

**पितृवन्मन्यमानास्तं जज्ञिरे पितरोपि च॥**

 Thus far, the philosophical relationship and the characteristic differences between the senses and the elements, the original Gods and the Pitris are distinctly represented. The Elements are named Pitris by the fact of their acknowledging and respecting Bramha the creator as their father. Their characteristic tealency ofnature is stated to be Yogaand they are therefore capable of giving Gani. Wartas, the Gods ofsenses have aa opposite tealency in spiceof

their being objects of veneration for mankind. Therefore the Pitris com:nand greater respect and the ceremonies to propitiate them have to be perforined before those prescribed for adoring the Gods. Several classifications of the original Pitris or Elements are noticed in the passages quoted above. Quotation 3 enumerates 7 sets of Pitris in the Heavens, 3 Murthas and 4 Anurthas. Quotation 5 divides the Pitris into Agnishwathas (those who do not worship fire) and Bharhishadas (those who worship fire, fire or Agni generally pointing to Gnana or knowledge. Again, the 6 tithus or bi-monthly periods in the year are called Pitris and are reckoned as Bramha's sons, meaning thereby the energy or law of Eswara which works by time. The subjoined lines in the quotation state this clearly.

**ऋतवोब्रह्मणःपुत्रा विज्ञेयास्तेभिनानिनः।  
मासार्धमासस्थानेषु स्थानितो ऋतवो मताः।  
स्थानानां व्यतिरेकेणज्ञेयाःस्थानाभिमानिनः।  
तदाख्यात्तत्ससत्वाश्च तदात्मानश्च ते स्मृताः॥**

 Thus far the original Pitris or subtle-Elements are described. The human Pitris known as the Anudeva. Pitris are also classified as Agnishwatas. and Barhishadas as an imitation of the original Pitris owing to some external correspondence of Karms, but are entirely different from those noticed in the higher sense of the term.

 ***Q. No. V.***

**तेषान्तु धर्मसाधर्म्यात् स्मृताः सायुज्यगाः द्विजैः॥**

 Among these human Pitris, 3 distinct varieties are mentioned. The deceased ancestors who have attained the Swarga-loka by virtuous life in this world rank first and they are venerated like the real original Pitris explained above, and are styled Manushya Pitris (Q. 5).

**स्वर्गतादिविमोदन्ते पितृवत्त उपासते।**

There are two more sets among the deceased ancestors to be enquired into.

 The majority of mankind who have left this earth having probably lived not very honourable lives, it would certainly be unfair and unjust to class then among the Manushya-Pitris just described. These are divided into two sets, one undergoing punishments in the Hell as Pretas and ever hankering after food, drink and rest, and the other being born in the lower scales of creation in the animal and vegetable kingdoms.

 Different kinds of Sradhas are prescribed for the Original Pitris and the varieties of Manushya-Pitris, and the food offered for the benefit of the latter are expected to meet them in the special forms of nourishinents required by them, by the virtue of Manthras and the purity of action, as a calf is capable of finding out its mother in the midst of a herd of COWS. This fact has been assured by Sinatkumara-Rishi, who is said to be gifted with the knowledge of the Pretas, by his Yogic development. What this assurance means could be easily made out when the significance of the said Rishi is known from the pages following.

 In noticing again in this connection, the Theosophical explanation of the Pitris and Sradhas, the following extract from Sanathana-Dharma is significant in its own way.

 Page 202. "The full meaning of descent from the Pitris is ascertainable only by study of Occult science".

 It can be easily understood by a careful reading of the passages already quoted from the sacred texts, that there are no mysteries represented with regard to the Pitris so far. The real and philosophical interpretation is first given and afterwards a secondary meaning in imitation of the same is furnished, in the usual Puranic style, with a view

to enforce the Ethical necessity of veneration towards the decensel ancestors. More than this nothing mysterious or confounding is discovered, nor even required in the interest of mankind either for worldly or religious purposes. I earnestly wish here to be clearly understood that it is far from my intentionor object to criticise the Theosophists for the work they have done in India, but on the contrary, I am gladly prepared to give them the most charitable considerations and thank the most heartily for having created a spirit of enquiry amongst some of us at least, especially at a time when we have almost reached a stage of utter indifference and disrespect for the contents of our sacred texts. In spite of this fact, I must be excused for what is being statel here, candidly and in plain terms, whenever the real interest of the sacred religion for which we have every legal and moral right, is seriously at stake.

 We have unfortunately suffered enough already, by the innocent ignorance of our Pandits, whom we looked upon all along as our unerring guide; and they have practically reduced our religion to something insipid, unscientific and superstitious. We could therefore ill-afford to keep gazing hereafter at further interference in the present fashion. The Pandit's process of deterioration, being an indigenous one, is capable of easy rectification, as it might be possible to diagnose the local disease without much difficulty. Bat the mistiken procedure of an entirely foreign type, might probably land us in greater confusion and hopelessly place us in irreneliable predicaments. We could however easily discera how the Theosophists have taken to a mistaken course in the present state of affairs, and could fully sympathise with themfor the sun, so far as the interpretations of our ancient literature are coacerned. They were compelled to collect second-hand informations from local Pandits as no

other source was virtually open to them. What was thus obtained could not help appearing absurd on its very face to a western civilized people under the circumstances so often explained. But we are bound to thank the creed for a charitable view they have somehow forined as to the likelihood of our sacred texts containing some sorts of useful and valuable informations. Explanations were therefore attempted naturally by the Western methods of enquiry which unfortunately did not and could not answer the purpose. Theresult of the two mistakes put together was the production of something ridiculous and certainly objectionable as the subject handled was an alien and a most sacred and hoary religion. With reference to the point at issue here the idea of Occultism put forth in the passage quoted from SanathanaDharma, is entirely irrelevant. If the English word 'Occultism' used, simply means pure ignorance, we have nothing to complain. Everything unknown and unsaught is of course Occult in that sense, but if it refers to any mystery not found explained in the sacred texts and therefore requiring to be learned from Theosophy, there is no other help than to denounce it as extraneous. There is no doubt that the Occultism here introduced refers to some mysterious powers recognised in Theosophy to find out the deceased ancestors and to keep communion with them or to explain the origin of mankind from the Monads in the Planets. Their peculiar theory, and probably the occultism in question here, as to the Pitris residing in the Moon and their taking birth on the earth as human beings, is as much unwarranted by the contents of our sacred texts as it is by common sense, That our deceased ancestors for whom we perform the Sradha ceremony should be interpreted as our future successors on the arth desce ling from the moon, caunot surely be believed to be the product of a sound brain. The mistake however,

has certainly originated as usual from sheer ignorance of the technical meanings of the words Soma and Soma-loka as used in the texts. They are simply taken to mean the moon as taught by our venerable Pandits. The application of the terms is clearly defined in quotation 2 as everywhere else in the religious literature, as referring to the Akasa.

**आकाशाम्भोनिधेर्योसौ सोम इसभिधीयते।  
आधारः सर्वभूतानां देवानाममृताकरः॥**

With regard to the deceased ancestors, we have the view taken by the sacred texts distinctly stated in quotation 5,

**न मृतानां गतिः शक्या ज्ञातुं न पुनरागतिः।  
तपसापि प्रसिद्धेन किं पुनर्मांसचक्षुषा॥ **

‛The ways of the deceased are undiscernible even by great Yogic powers, m ich less by flashy mortal eyes.' Besides, the Yogic development detailed in the texts is not certainly meant for satisfying the curiosities of this transient material world. The most astonishing facts in this direction will not in the least create feelings of admiration in a Jivan-mukta or a real Yogi.

**अपि शीतरुचावर्केसुतीक्ष्णेपीन्दुमण्डले।  
अप्यधः प्रसरत्यग्नौजीवन्मुक्तो न विस्मयी॥**

**अन्नपूर्णोपनिषत्॥**

"A Jivanmukta is not astonished even if the sun is made to emit cold rays and the moon hot rays, or if the fire is made to burn downwards".

 But even the powers of a Yogi recognised by the texts could not be soirresponsibly utilized for explaining away irrelevant or unwarranted facts. The texts strictly limit their scope, extent and use, and the acquirement of any such powers is not such an easy or light task as is made to appear, nor everybody in India is a baby ready to swallow

all that is spoken about them. The powers if possessed are not matters for oration but for action, without the least desire for display or fame; and the tests for their real attainment, as understood from the texts, are sufficiently explicit so as to prevent belief in deception. The eight Angas or component parts of Yoga such as Saina, Dama &c., are the preparatory processes necessary for the attainment of Yogic results and each Anga consists of the practice of several moral and religious virtues. Out of these large number of requisites, the very first virtue inculcated in Saina to commence with, is 'Ahimsa' or harmlessness. The test for having completely secured this first virtue, is recognised as consisting in the prevention of mutual harm among animals naturally inimical. Animals like lions and tigers, which are by the very nature of their creation, enemies and destroyers of milder animals, such as cows, sheep and deer, are said to behave friendly with them in the presence of the Yogi who has accomplished this single virtue. In the Puranic descriptions of the residences or Asramas of Rishis, this fact can be observed frequently noticed. The existence and non-existence of the Yogic powers claimed in accordance with our Sastras by any member of Theosophy, are thus easily ascertainable. A tiger and a cow let loose before him will immediately solve the problem satisfactorily, and under the existing state of affairs, there is no doubt that the tiger will alone remain to decide the question at issue. The Puranic description of the Pitris is virtually a treatment of Karm-Yoga, a serious and scientific subject in which no pretensions could be of any avail.

**अनभ्यासवतश्चैव वृथा गोष्ठ्या न सिद्ध्यति॥**

 **8.** We have now to some extent examined the significance of the Devas and the Pitris, two important

personages constantly introduced in the religious texts. The Asuras, though often occurring in them are only mentioned for the purpose of being avoided. Before taking up the next important figures known as the Rishis, it may be desirable to examine particularly the nature of the Asuras named Mandehas, who are said to obstruct the path of the sun every day, and for the removal of whose obstruction the Hindus are strictly ordained to perform the Sandhya-vandana both morning and evening. The following passage from Vishnu-Purana clearly explains the whole subject.

**दिवा नकं च सूर्यस्य मन्दा शीघ्रा च वै गतिः।**  
**मन्दाह्नियस्मिन्नयने शीघ्रा नक्तं तदा गतिः।**  
**शीघ्रा दिवा यथा चास्य तथा मन्दा गतिर्निशि।**  
**एकप्रमाणमेवैष मार्गं याति दिवाकरः।**  
**अहोरात्रेण यो भुंक्तेसमस्ता राशयो द्विज।**  
**षडेव राशयो भुंक्ते रात्रावन्याश्च षट् दिवा।**  
**राशिप्रमाणजनिता दीर्घह्रस्वात्मता दिने।**  
**तथा निशायां राशीनां प्रमाणैर्लघुदीर्घता।**  
**दिनादेर्दीर्घह्रस्वत्वं तद्भोगेनैव जायते।**  
**उत्तरे प्रक्रमे शीघ्रा निशि मन्दा गतिर्दिवा।**  
**दक्षिणेत्वयने चैव विपरीता विवस्वतः।**  
**उषा रात्रिः समाख्याता व्युष्टिश्चाप्युच्यते दिनम्।**  
**प्रोच्यते च तथा सन्ध्या उषाव्युष्ट्योर्यदन्तरम्।**  
**सन्ध्याकाले तु सम्प्राप्ते रौद्रे परमदारुणे।**  
**मन्देहा राक्षसा घोराः सूर्यमिच्छन्ति खादितुम्।**  
**प्रजापतिकृतः शापस्तेषां मैत्रेय रक्षसाम्।**  
**अक्षयत्वं शरीराणां मरणञ्च दिने दिने।**  
**ततः सूर्यस्य तैर्युद्धं भवत्यत्यन्तदारुणम्।**  
**ततो द्विजोत्तमास्तोयं प्रक्षिपन्ति महामुने।**  
**ओंकारब्रह्मसंयुक्तं गायत्र्याचाभिमन्त्रितम्।**

**तेन दह्यन्ति ते पापा वज्रीभूतेन वारिणा।**  
**अग्निहोत्रे हूयते या समन्त्रा प्रथमाहुतिः।**  
**सूर्योज्योतिः सहस्रांशुस्तया दीप्यति भास्करः।**  
**ओंकारो भगवान् विष्णुःत्रिधामा वचसां पतिः।**  
**यदुच्चारणतस्ते तु विनाशं यान्ति राक्षसाः।**  
**वैष्णवोंशः परः सूर्यो योन्तर्ज्योतिरसम्प्लवम्।**  
**अभिधायक ओंकारस्तस्य स प्रेरकः परः।**  
**तेन तत्प्रेरितं ज्योतिरोङ्कारेणाथ दीप्तिमत्।**  
**दहत्यशेषरक्षांसि मन्देहाख्यान्यधानिवै।**  
**तस्मान्नोल्लंघनं कार्यं सन्ध्योपासनकर्मणः।**  
**स हन्ति सूर्य सन्ध्याया नोपास्तिं कुरुते हि यः॥**

 "In the half year known as Uttarayana and in that known as Dekshinayana, the durations of day and night differ. This difference is not owing to any variation in the rate of sun's speed. The twelve Rasis or constellations or signs of the Zodiac, six of which extend to the day and six to the night cause this difference of duration. Usha means night, Vyushti is day and the intervening time is Sandhya. At this terrible Sandhya, the Rakshasas named Mandehas attempt to devour the sun by furiously fighting with him. By the curse of Prejapathi, they ever retain their body, but they die every day. The Bramhins at this time pour water muttering Om combined with Gayathri. This water turns into a diamond weapon and destroys the Rakshasas. The first offering of rice in the Agnihotra then adds lustre to the sun. Here Om refers to Vishnu the God of words, and the sun represents the Para-Bramhan the eternal and internal light. The Rakshasas allude to the sins of man. Therefore none shall violate the ordinance to perform this Sandhya, as he would ortherwise be doing harm to the sun".

 The sandhya here explained is regarded as an important religious ceremony to be daily perforined by the Hindus,

and it has now virtually become a meaningless ritual seldom cared for by the younger generation among the educatedHindus. This is indeed a deplorable state of fact for which somebody must be held responsible. Surely, the fault could not be attributed to modern education which undoubtedly improves the intellectual capacities of its sincere votaries. The real difficulty here is, that when education naturally demanded a reasonable explanation for the ceremony under reference, the Pandit authorities owing to their utter want of religious education were unable to furnish necessary explanations, The Sandhya being one of the simplest daily ceremonies ordained by religion, it is indeed a pity that everyone is groping in the dark at present with regard to its real significance. In the interest of our sacred religion and in that of the modern Hindu public, it is highly necessary that a better source of information should be immediately sought for than the misleading and ignorant Pandit authorities. The above quotation clearly proves that the ceremony ordained is no superstitious absurdity, nor mysterious occultism. The worship of the Sun at the Sandhya is plainly explained as referring to the adoration of the internal Atma.

**वैष्णवोंशः परः सूर्यो योन्तर्ज्योतिरसंप्लवम्॥ **

 The Rakshasas named Mandehas are said to reprresent the sins of man obstructing the acquirement of real knowledge of the Atma.

**दहत्यशेषरक्षांसि मन्देहाख्यान्यघानिवै॥**

 The process prescribed for the destruction of these Rakshasas or sins is the meditation of the Atma accompanied by the ordained Manthra.

**ओंकारब्रह्मसंयुक्तं गायत्र्या चाभिमन्त्रितम्॥**

The term Mandeha itself gives the necessary clue here for the Puranic description. It points to the variation of time in the day. Of course this is perceptible only at the Sandhyas, and the Rakshasas are described as appearing at those times. The Sun being the greatest and the grandest light-giver to this material world, the analogical representation of Atma is most appropriate, and the application of the analogy itself is plainly stated in all the religious texts.

सूर्य आत्मा जगतस्तस्थुषश्चइति श्रुतेः॥

 असौ वा आदित्यो बहिरात्मान्तरात्मा प्राणो बहिरात्मागत्यान्तरात्मनोनुमीयते। आदित्य ओमित्येवं ध्यायंस्तथात्मानं युंजीतेति॥ मैत्रायण्युपनिषत्॥

 "The Sun represents the Atma common to all the movables and immovables. The Sun outside is the objective Atma and Prana is the internal Atina. The workings of the one are compared to those of the other. Therefore meditate upon the Sun as Om and apply it to the Atma".

 There is no doubt that there is ample practical sense in this ordina ce on a psychological point of view. Besides, we could easily infer from these analogical prescriptions of religious ceremonies, that the ancient Rishis, who were masters of their own science, were not unmindful of the collateral effects accruing from external advantages utilized for the purpose of helping on the lower orders of society. These are ordinary observations which could not possibly miss the eye of an earnest and sincere enquirer of truth, more especially in the field of religion in which he is personally interested. There is also nothing surprising in the fact that indifference, incapacity, bias, pride or prejudice fails to perceive correctly and fully even the plainest matters, on account of these very natural defects. And it is equallyno wonder, that those subject to such unfortunate drawbacks, are generally prone to criticise. bare truth and plain

sense, as something derogatory to the dignity of mankind, guaged as they are by the low and vicious standard of their own.

**जाड्यं ह्रीमति गण्यते व्रतरुचौ दम्भः शुचौ कैतवम्**  
**शूरे निर्घृणता मुनौ विमतिता दैन्यं प्रियालापिनि।**  
**तेजस्विन्यवलिप्तता मुखरता वक्तर्यशक्तिःस्थिरे**  
**तत्कोनाम गुणो भवेत्सगुणिनां यो दुर्जनैर्नाङ्कितः॥ **

Like Mahisha and the Mandehas already noticed among the Asuras, there are two well-known brothers named Madhu and Kytabha who are said to have originated from the ears of Vishnu during his sleep. These powerful Asuras once attacked Bramha who had to seek the help of Vishnu to be freed from their molestation. Vishnu destroyed them after a long and terrible fight, and from their Medas, marrow or fat the earthy globe originated called Medini.

**पुरा चैकार्णवे जाते विलीने भुवनत्रये।**  
**शेषपर्यङ्कसुप्ते च देवदेवे जनार्दने।**  
**विष्णुकर्णमलोद्भूतौ दानवो मधुकैटभौ।**  
**महाबलौ च तौ दैत्यो विवृद्धौ सागरे जले।**  
**कालेन कियता विप्रा दानवाभ्यां यदृछया।**  
**दृष्टः प्रजापतिर्ब्रह्मा पत्मासनगतः प्रभुः।**  
**दृष्ट्वा तु मुदितावास्तां युद्धकामौ महाबलौ।**  
**तमूचतुस्तदा तत्र युद्धं नो देहि सुव्रत।**  
**नोचेत्पत्मं परित्यज्य यथेष्टं गच्छमा चिरम्।**  
**यदि त्वं निर्बलश्चासि क्व योग्यं शुभमासनम्।**  
**वीरयोग्यमिदं स्थानं कातरोसि त्यजाशु वै।**  
**तयोरिति वचश्श्रुत्वा चिन्तामाप प्रजापतिः॥**

**रथाङ्गेन तदाछन्ने विष्णुना प्रभविष्णुना।**  
**जघनोपरि वेगेन प्राक्लष्टेशिरसी तयोः।**  
**गतप्राणौ तदा जातौ दानवौ मधुकैटभौ।**

**सागरस्सकलौ व्याप्तस्तदा वै मदसा तयोः।**  
**मेदिनीति ततो जातं नाम पृथ्व्याः समन्ततः।**  
**अभक्ष्या मृतिका तेन कारणेन मुनीश्वराः॥**

**देवीभागवतम्॥**

The earth being thus made up of the fat of these terrible Asuras is said to have become un-edible. The Pandit evidently has nothing to enlighten us here. He understands nothing out of this story. The description given will doubtless prevent the critic from cooking up any Indian historical incident. Tthe birth and death of these Asuras are said to have taken place in the waters of the ocean which covered the three Lokas, and the earth itself originated from their fat afer their death. Although they were killed by Vishnu at last, their original aim was to attack Bramha. The modern Pandit who has certainly not studied the subject, is under the impression that such stories are meaningless and are left unexplained in the literature. The following gives a clear and sensible explanation of the description.

**विघ्नस्तमसि सम्भूतो मधुर्नाम महासुरः।**  
**तथा रजसि सम्भूतो ह्यसुरो नाम कैटभः।**  
**तौ रजस्तमसोद्भूतौ सम्भूतौ तामसौ गुणैः।**  
**एकार्णवं जगत्सर्वंक्षोभयेतां महाबलौ॥**

**मधुकैटभावूचतुः॥**

**नावयोः परमं लोके किश्चिदस्ति महामुने।**  
**आवाभ्यां छादितं विश्वं तमसा रजसा च वै।**  
**रजस्तमोमयावावा मृषीणामविलम्बितौ।**  
**छाद्यमानौ धर्मशीलौदुस्तरौ सर्वदेहिनाम्।**  
**आवाभ्यां मुह्यते लोको दुष्कराभ्यां युगे युगे।**  
**आवामर्थश्च कामश्च यज्ञःसर्वपरिग्रहः।**  
**सुखं यत्र मुदायुक्तंयत्र श्रीःकीर्तिरेव च।**  
**येषां यत्कांक्षितं किञ्चित्तत्तदावां विचिन्तय॥**

**पद्मपुराणम्॥**

 "The obstruction originating from Tamas is Madhu and from Rejas is Kytabha. The qualities of both are Tamasic and they agitate the whole world, They said: There is none greater than both of us in the Lokas. By Rejas and Tamas we cover up the Viswa and confuse the Rishis in every Yuga. The desire for Artha, Kama, Yegna, happiness, fame &c., falls within our sway".

 Both of these Asuras are plainly said to represent Rejas and Tamas comprising all the varieties of desires as such. Their fat being described as the main ingredient in the composition of this earth, it clearly refers to the religiously objectionable materialistic tendency, and hence explained as unfit for man's real enjoymet. Bramha alluding to the involutionary tendency of Budhi is naturally described as being attacked by these two Asuras.

**आशानाम नदी मनोरथजला तृष्णातरङ्गाकुला**  
**रागग्नाहवती वितर्कविहगा धैर्यद्रुमध्वंसिनी।**  
**मोहावर्तसुदुस्तरातिगहना प्रोत्तुङ्गचिन्तातटी**  
**तस्याः पारगंता विशुद्धमनसो नन्दन्ति योगीश्वराः॥**

 **9.** The next allied species of personages requiring explanation is that of the Rishis. We have heard of Rishis of various and curious origins, of different families, sometimes of different shapes and often of peculiar characters. All of them are known to possess immense superhuman powers by religious devotion and Tapas. Several of them are believed to be living in the heavens and the others on the earth. They also visit each other occasionally. No sort of inconvenience is experienced for their travelling freely to different Lokas such as those of Bramha, Vishnu or Siva at any time they desire. Although all of them in- variably are kind and pious, some are by nature angry and some quarrelsome. This is more or less the kind of Puranic

descriptions we possess. It is not difficult to see that on the whole, the appearance of a fable is imprinted on them. The modern mistake of the Pandit originated here in his attempt to reconcile the inconsistencies as they are found, without in the least considering whether the subjects dealt with are not entirely different from their sole appearance. In the fable of the lion and the mouse for instance, the Pandit leaving entirely the purport of the story began, to enquire the whereabouts of the animals and to seek reasons to justify the possibility of their transactions as well as of their conversation in human language. Thus the problem of the Pandit's error is a simple one and is easily solved. But we are in no way jealous of the respect he is able to command from ordinary people, by his mere apparel, as a great portion of the generally acknowledged respect and inerit among mankind all over the world chiefly depends upon weavermade and tailor-made stuffs. A reasonable suggestion in the proper direction would certainly have saved him from all error, by a simple and convenient enquiry into the further details and the definitions clearly furnished in the texts themselves. No more proofs than the subjoined quotations, are, I daresay needed to convince us of this fact beyond a doubt.

** *Quotation No. I.***

 "The term Rishi is derived from its root signifying, going, hearing, truth and Tapas. That which takes you near to the Bramhan is therefore named Rishi. In the involutionary practice, that which carries Budhi to Avyakta and Parom is called Paraina Rishi. That which is self-originated and devoid of pame &c., is Atma-Rishi. The self.

originated sons of Bramha, who are the seers of Budhi and who lead to Mahat are called Maha-Rishis. They are devoid of egoism and ignorance and are great Eswaras. By their union, the Rishi-putras originate known as Satya-Rishis, because they lead to the subtle elements having complete knowledge of the elements or Satya. Sruta-Rishis are those who possess a knowledge of the gross elements and lead you to the Sruti or Vedas. The Maha-Rishis are so called, because they determine the Manthras in accordance with the Vedas and Mahat proceeds from them. The word Manthra is derived from its root, meaning deliberation, and Bramhana from its root meaning, pleasing the Bramhan. A Manthra is known to the wise as a Sutra or short sentence full of faultless and extensive meaning. There are three varieties of Rishis, the Bramha-Rishis being the first. From them the Deva-Rishis originated and from them again, the Raja-Rishis. The Bramha-Rishis are so named because they lead to Bramha. From the five Bramha-Rishis, namely, Kasyapa, Vasishta, Bhrigu, Angira and Athri, the family ofBramha-Rishis originated. From Dharma, Pulastya, Kretu, Pulaha, Pretyusha, Prebhasa and Kasyapa, the Deva-Rishis originated. Nara and Narayana are sons of Dharma; Balakhilyas are Kretu's sons; Kardama and Kubera are Pulaha's; Achala is Pretyusha's; Parvata and Narada are Kasyapa's. The Deva-Rishis are so named because they lead us to the Devas. In the families of Manu and of Ida, Ikshwaku, Ida, Nabhaga &c., are called Raja-Rishis, because they lead the Prejas by pleasing them. The Bramha-Rishis reside in Bramha-loka, the Deva-Rishis in Deva-loka and the Raja-Rishis in Indra-loka. By noble birth, Tapas and Manthras, the Rishis are thus divided. By the difference of seven qualities, they are called Sapta-Rishis Bramha divided his essence into six parts and sacrificed them for the creation of

the Lokas, and six Maha-Rishis originated from his mind called Prejapathis, from whom the families in the Lokas originated. From Marichi or rays of light, Marichi originated; from Kretu or sacrifice Kretu came up; Athri signifies 'I am the third'; Pulastya is so named because he cameup from the pointed hair; and Pulaha from the hanging hair. Vasishta is from the midst of Vasu or glory; he is glorious and depends on the earth. These are known as originators of families and represent the basic principles of religious stages and times. The propagation of the Prejasis not carried on by these in themselves, but by a combination of Yugas and destruction".

 The term Rishi aud its various classifications are clearly explained here as referring to certain psychological principles, religious stages and times connected with Manthras. The main idea is the capacity or power to lead on step by step towards the real goal. None of these Rishis are stationed in this material world; and even by feeling every line in the quotation, the Pandit could not find the mention of the Mahamadan's beard or the Byragi's twisted lock, which form the distinguishing marks of an Rishi in accordance with his confounded conception.

** *Q. No. II.***

 "Understand that Bramha's creation is without the use of Budhi. Bramha first created out of his mind five Yogis equal to him in rank named, Sanaka, Sanatana, Sanandana, Kretu and Sanatkumara. After a long time, Mahadeva of red and blue colours originated from his anger. Bramha then created the basic principles such as the five elements, rivers, oceans, mountains, trees, creepers and different divisions of time up to the Yugas. He then created Marichi, Bhrigu, Angira, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kretu, Deksha, Athri, Vasishta, Dharma and Samkalpa as executive authorities.

Angira came out of his head, Bhrigu originated from his heart, Dharma from his profession or trade, Samkalpa from his imagination, Pulastya from Udana, Pulaha from meditation, Kretu from Apana and Vasishta from Samana. Remaining in the human body they work out the Dharmas. All that is pertaining to Prithivi or Bhumi originated from Arundhati. Sandilya, Nydhruva, and Rybhya are the three sons of Kasyapa representing the nature of man. Pulastya has four wives who propagated his families".

 The divine creations by Bramha here detailed are said to be without the use of the Intellect.

**अबुद्धिपूर्वकां विप्रा ब्राह्मीं निबोधत॥**

 Have the modern interpreters any reasonable explanation to offer here, if they pretend to understand the passage? Bramha was perhaps out of sobriety at the time, and it is therefore a very religious act for man to imitate him occasionally. The very first idea of Bramha's creation here, is virtually not understood at all. In spite of this plain fact, misinterpretations must unhesit itingly proceed in right earnest. Is it because it has never before been understood or explained properly, except perhaps by occultisms in recent years by Theosophists? Certainly not. The modern Pandit does not and will not study the subject, that is the only mistake; and he must add insult to injury by volunteering his idiotic commentaries. He has absolutely not the slightest idea of Bramha or his creation or the objects said to be created. The ancient Pandits have no doubt carefully studied the subject and have sensibly explained the matter. The first creation here described is known in Puranic language as Tamasasarga. It refers to the natural impulse of Maya and its Avarana-sakti, actuated by the effects of inan's previous karmas. The creation specified alludes therefore

to the religious qualifications of each individual. The modern Pandit is earnestly referred to the clear explanation furnished by respectable Pandits of his own class in ancient times, and it is hoped that he will now at least repent for his shameless deterioration.

 अबुद्धिपूर्वकः सर्गः। स्रष्टाव्यप्राणिकर्मप्रेरणयैव प्रवर्तिते तद्विषयतया सविकल्पकत्वेन तदावरणमायाया यत्स्फुरणं सोयं तमसः सर्गः प्रथमः॥

** *Q. No. III.***

 "Aditya is so named because of his being the adi or first among the Devas. In accordance with his gunas, he is viewed in three aspects. In the morning he is Prejapathi, in the noon Vishnu and in the eve he is Rudra. From the Prejapathi of the morning, nine Rishis originated, who are established in the Puranas as the nine Bramhas, namely, marichi, Athri, Angira, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kretu, Bhrigu, Vasishta and Narada."

 The Triads here make up the sun; and nine Rishis called Bramhas originate from the rising sun. How is the Pandit going to establish his literal interpretation of sun here, which in itself is only a creation of Bramha. Has he any explanation for the nine Bramhas here specified, and how was this number fixed in the Puranas? The Pandit no doubt is entirely deaf to all such questions.

** *Q. No. IV.***

 "It is said that the Rishis originated in the beginning, Who are those Rishiş? They are Pranas or life-breaths".

 The Pandit would like to stick on some false beards at least to these Pranas, to establish his conception of Rishis still.

** *Q. No. V.***

 "Rishikas are those who lead the elements &c to Parom. Rishi-putras are known as their sone. Sruta-Rishis represent

those who having learned the nature of Parom, meditate upon it. The Rishis are said to be of five castes; Avyakta-Atma, Mahanta-Atma, Ahamkara-Atma, Bhuta-Atma and Indriya-Atma. They signify the knowledge of these items."

 It is clearly explained here that Rishis signify the knowledge of certain psychological items. The Pundit's idea of knowledge and ignorance too is perhaps in human form without which his brain cannot conceive anything.

** *Q. No. VI.***

 "The rays of light are the sapta-Rishis. The Rishis are seers. The seers of the three Lokas are the sapta-Rishia. The Rishis lead by karma, manthra and its meaning, and producing a change in the effects, cause the perception of Dharma. As the perception of Dharma is very rare, the definition is somewhat complementary."

 "Vyasa, means dividing, also explaining. It denotes the understanding of the Vedas by a knowledge of the Vedangas."

 "Vishwamithra, means friend of all, or, all are his friends. It denotes that evrything unites or fits together harmoniously."

 The sapta-Rishis are here clearly explained as including to the seven rays, the seven Prakritis or glories belonging to the religious sun, the Apara-Atma, Sabda-Bramhan or Purana-purusha. The term Rishi meaning seer, represents the developed faculty for perceiving or experiencing the religious objects specified. Vyasa represents the faculty of analysing the Velas by the study of the Vedangas. Viswamithra, similarly alludes to manana, consideration or observation of particular facts, by which the various religious details are brought to a harmonious whole. There is not the slightest difficulty now to understand, that. the Rishis

signify the various important items in our religious psychology.

** *Q. No. VII.***

 "The Sapta-Rishis are known as Chithrasikhandins, consisting of Marichi, Athri, Angira, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kretu and Vasishta. They represent the seven Prakritis, and adding Swayambhuva make up eight. They are truthful, religious and all seeing Munis and are the supporters of the Lokas. These Rishis accompanied by the four Vedas, met together on Mount Meru; and in consideration of the Lokas, they produced the Sastras specifying the Dharmas for the. Lokas. Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha are clearly explained therein, also the nature of Bramhan, the bounds of morality in heaven and earth and everything pertaining to the welfare of man.

 The subtle elements originated from Ahamkara. From these elements, the eight Rishis above named originated, known as the eight Prakritis that support the Lokas, and from which the Viswa and the Jagat originated. The seven Rishis originated from Bramha's mind, are learnedin the Vedas. They are also the expounders of the Vedas and thesters of Pravriti-Dharma. This is the established-eternal path of Karma-yoga. The creator of the Lokas is known as Lord Anirudha. Sana, Sanat-sujata, Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanat-kumara, Kapila and Sanatana are also seven mind-born sons of Bramhs. They are self-illumined masters of Yoga and Sankhya, and are the propounders of Nivriti-Dharma leading to final emancipation. Those learned in the Sankhyas call me Kapila as I am seated in the sun combined with Vidya. The five elements joined together compose a body, otherwise, no body can exist. The vital sire cannot work without Jiva or Life principle. By nature

of its action therefore this Jiva is called Sesha, Samkarshana and Sanat-Kumara."

 The two sets of Sapta-Rishis are here clearly explained as originating from Bramha and as representing Karma-Yoga and Gnana-Yoga respectively. The Rishi named Kapila is virtually identified with Sankhya-Yoga and Sanat-kumara with the life principle, Sesha and Samkarshana being its synonymous terms. Kapila is in the Sun with his wife Vidya and the other Rishis are also of no tangible form. Tho Pandit cannot therefore hope to see them inhuman form with or without beards.

 ***Qs. No. VIII & IX.***

 "Sanat, means eternal and Kumara means a boy. Bramha therefore called me Sanat-kumara. I ever remain as I was first born, and I am therefore named Sanat-kumara".

 The definition of Sanat-kumara is very clear here. The individual life in its pristine purity and complete innocenceis alluded to. When all the worldly dross is removed by devotional practices and the state of the real Twomor Thou is reached, the Rishihood specified is attained. The Pandit who is growing anxious about his old age might relish the idea of becoming a Sanat-kumara in his literal sense by his own transformation into an old boy again. It must take a pretty long time before he can expect to accomplish this.

 ***Q. No. X.***

 "Angiras, alludes to Prana or life, as when it leaves. any Anga or limb in the body, that part withers. Vak, word or the Veda, is magnanimous, and its Pati or Lord is Brihaspati, Athri refers to Vak or the Veda, as everything is swallowed up or contained in the Vedas. Athri means eating up. He is wise who understands this. Prajapathi, represents Hridayam or the heart. The letter Hri takes in

everything belonging to oneself or to others. Da, signifies giving everything, and Yem denotes, leading to the Heavens. He is wise who understands this.

 Mind, Word and Prana are the three divisions of this Atma. They represent the three Lokas, Word is this Loka, Mind is Akasic Loka and Prana is that Loka. They represent the three Vedas. Word is Ric-Veda, Mind, is Yejur-veda and Prana is Sama-veda. They are again the Devas, Pitris and men. Word refers to the Devas, Mind to the Pitris and Prana to the Prejas. Vak or Veda is Vasishta. He who understands this becomes Vasishta hinself. He is wise whounderstands this."

 The text is sufficien tly plain here, unless one is determined not to read it.

 ***Q. No. XI.***

 "The God gave himself up, to the highly devotional Athri and his wife Anasuya, in the from of light and was born as their son named Dattathreya. He who understands the Niruktas of this description, understands everything".

 The logical conclusion here, must be that if the Niruktas pointed but are not cared for, nothing could be understood from this passage. Our venerable Pandit however, is unfortunately in bad terms with this confounding Nirukta.

** *Q. No. XII.***

 "There are two religious paths prescribed for securing final emancipation; one is called Suka-marga and the other Vamadevamarga. Suka means a flying bird and the path of that name, alludes to Sankhyayoga, Samadhi &c. by which emancipation is quickly obtained. Vama-deva means a crawling ant and the path of that name alludes to the practice of Ashtanga-yogas and other processes which secure

emaucipation, only after undergoing many difficulties and after several births".

 Two religious paths are naturally prescribed here to suit the different qualifications of man, the advanced stage named Sukamarga being for the use of the highly qualified and the lower one called Vamadeva-marga for the less qualified. The Panlit simply mistakes the road for thepassenger here. His erudition has evidently made his eyes dim.

** *Q. No. XIII.***

 "Dekshina-murthi or Siva saved Markandeya son of Mrikandu, from the noose of Death and gave the knowledge of the self. Here Death represents ignorance, and Markandeya stands for Viveka or discriminating faculty. The hoose refers to the bondage consequent on the ignoranceof the Tatwas. Fear of Death points to the existing idea of duality. Dekshina, means intellect and when that is developed in the proper direction, it is Dekshina-abhimukha representing Siva".

 The text here explains every word and every idea in the quotation, which will require a highly perverted intellect to misunderstand. The modern Pandit no doubt is sufficently gifted with this stuff for his notorions profession.

 ***Q. Nos. XIV &. XV.***

 "The ancients clearly meant to represent Saraswati by the term Arundhati. A man whose death is near, fails to see Arundhati, Dhruva, Vishnu-pada and Mathri-mandala. Here Arundhati represents the tongue; Dhruva the tip of the nose; Vishnu-pada, the space bentween the eye-brows and Mathri-mandala, the eyes".

 The technical terms used in the quotation are explained in the same. The modern interpreters might erase some of

these lines as they are very vexing indeed. But how do they feel confident that their unauthorised, unqualified and unreasonable misinterpretations are exceedingly pleasing to others? No doubt they judge everything by their own standard, but forget that they will be judged at one time by better standards.

**ये के विचित्ररसशालिषु सत्कवीनां सूक्तेषु कर्णपथगामिषु नाद्रियन्ते।  
ते मालतीपरिमलेष्वपि कन्दलत्सु नासापुटंकरतलेन पिदध्युरेव॥**

 **10.** The descriptions of Rishis as found in the passages quoted above, disclose plainer, simpler and less complicated facts as compared with those enquired into, in the preceding paras, and we are consequently in a position to understand them without much thought and trouble.

 The Rishis clearly represent certain definite conditions of intellectual development in man to be attained by Yoga and Sankhya practices. The significance of almost all the names may be invariably traced by referring to their derivations. it is easy to discover that none of the denote the proper names of any specific individuals, but point to some advanced stages of human conduct leading on to the ultimate goal. The large number of Rishis differing in character indicate the various halting places provided for, in the progressive path of religious devotion. Every one of them therefore deserves and demands due respect and consideration, if only the object of running out the prescribed course completely, is ever aimed at. The different classifications of Rishis furnished in the quotations should be correctly understood for the proper comprehension and practice of the ordained courses of action in our sacred religion without a knowledge of which they are apt to be treated as profitless and superstitious. Every Manthra or religious prayer has its particular Rishi recognised, clearly showing how the stage

of attainment of the devotee is distinctly marked and a suitable Manthra is provided for his benefit. There is thus not the slightest doubt as to the important part played by these Rishis throughout our religious ordinances, and it costs no effort to discover that invariably all the valuable and religious instructions conveyed in the texts are in the names of some specific Rishis. The names of the Instructors thus particularised are not therefore meaningless or purposeless. A very valuable clue is by this means furnished at the very commencement, for the correct interpretations of the contents of the instructions, and for noticing the intellectual, moral and religious status of the persons to whom they are intended. Quotation 7 classifies two sets of Sapta-Rishis or seven Rishis said to have been born from the mind of Bramha; referring directly to the seven Prakritis or material causes of creation. The two sets are distinguished from each other by the nature of their work, one pertaining to Nivriti, Sankhya or Gnana-Yoga; and the other to Pravriti or Karma-Yoga. The seven Rishis dealing with the former are, Sana, Sanatsujata, Sanaka; Sanadana, Sanat-kumara, Kapila and Sanatana; those dealing with the latter are, Marichi, Angira, Atri, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kretu and Vasishta, and adding Swayambhuva-Manu, the latter set makes up the eight Prakritis. The vital distinction between Karma-yoga and Gnana-yoga as well as their practical applications in detail are ingeniously explained by this classification.

 In our philosophical analysis, we have already seen that the cosmological conception of the Universe resolves itself into seven Prakritis. Each of these Prakritis is here taken into consideration and utilized in two different ways for purposes of religious advancement. The Pravriti-marga or Karma-yoga deals with the Prakritis by cognising the energy of Eswara inherent in their respective functions in

the evolution of the religions universe, and meditates upon the unthwarted display of each Prakriti as the glories of the Almighty exhibited through them. The Nivriti-marga or Gnana-yoga, on the other hand simply notices the work of the Prakritis but passes on to the real goal beyond, leaving them as comparatively unimportant in consideration of the transient nature of the phenomenal existence as a whole. The processess for correctly understanding the scope and extent of each of the Prakritis, and for obtaining control over each of them with a view to pass over, one after another, are doubtless matters of practical and religious importance. It might perhaps be necessary to be reminded of the real significance of Prakriti and of its evolution and involution of the religious universe, lest the readers go astray even at the present stage of this essay. Let it be told again and again that Prakriti alludes to the Satwic Maya and not to Avidya, and that the evolution and involution of the universe here noticed are the work of the former explained as the glories of God. The evolution and involution of the material world with all its miseries and disappointments belong to the functions of Avidya, and they display no doubt, the glories of the wickedness and stupidity of the individual man, which the religious texts do not recognise either in the Karma-yoga or Gnana-yoga, in the Pravriti-marga or Nivrti-marga prescribed for devotional practices. The meditation of a God or Goddess in some material form prescribed for the lower grades of practice cannot be substituted by the meditation of the form of a whore for religious purposes. The Pandit always forgets this fact and imagines he is extremely religious in his own favourite meditations.

**द्रष्टव्येषु किमुत्तमं मृगदृशां प्रेमप्रसन्नं मुखम्  
घ्रातव्येषु च किं तदास्यपवनश्श्राव्येषु किन्तद्वचः।**

**किं खाद्येषु तदोष्टपल्लवरसः स्पृश्येषु किं तद्वपु-  
ध्येयं किं नवयौवनं सहृदयैस्सर्वत्र तद्विभ्रमः॥**

 The derivative meaning of the word Rishi is clearly explained in quotation **1** as pointing to the capability of approaching or taking near to the Bramhan step by step. The gradual progress on the prescribed path of religious practice is marked distinctly at every specific stage, by giving suitable appellations to the Rishis concerned. In the same quotation we find full and significant definitions furnished for the following names.  
  1. Rishi,       2. Parama-Rishi,  3. Atma-Rishi;  
  4. Maha-Rishi;   5.Satya-Rishi;    6. Sruta-Rishi;  
  7.Bramha-Rishi;  8.Deva-Rishi;    9. Raja-Rishi;  
  10. Rishikas and  11. Rishi-putras.

We find again that six Rishis already enumerated are classed under Prajapathis; namely, Marichi, Kretu, Athri, Pulastya, Pulaha and Vasishta. In quotation 3 we find that three more names are added namely Bhrigu, Angira and Narada, thus making the number of Prajapathis into 9. They are dercribed in quotation 1, as follows.

**लोकसन्तानकरा स्तैरिमा वर्द्धिता प्रजाः।  
एतद्वंशसमुद्भूताः स्थानकालाभिमानिनः॥**

Quotation 2 speaks of them thus.

 **साधकाः ग्रहमेधिनः॥**

 They are said to be the progenitors of the families in the Lokas and skilful adepts in family-life. Slightly equivocal descriptions of this kind occasionally might mislead the reader who has no idea of what is being narrated. For such mistakes, it is not proper to lay the blame on the venerable authors of these texts, as it is the privilege of no reader of books to pick up a single line or two and to criticise or inisinterpret the whole in his own way, utterly disregarding

the portions before and after. The Lokas have been already found on examination to be different from this earthy sphere, and the subjects, Prajas and families here mentioned, musttherefore represent something equally different. Quotation 10 clearly defines Prajapathi as the Heart and Praja as Prana.

**“एष प्रजापतिर्यत् हृदयं एतत् ब्रह्मैतत्सर्वे तदेतत्र्यक्षरं हृदयामिति॥"  
“पिता माता प्रजैत एव मन एव पिता वाङ्माता प्राणःप्रजा"**

 The Lokas thus refer to the several Prakritis identical with the corresponding Rishis themselves; and the families or Prajas originated in them denote the respective effects produced on the intellect of the devotee by the meditation of these Lokas and their working as the glories of God. Thus far the functions of one set of Sapta-Rishis and of the six or nine Prajapathis are explained. The remaining Sapta-Rishis deal solely with Gnana-yoga without special meditations on these Lokas and their workings.

 Our quotations on the subject in question, furnish however, still further varieties of classification and they deserve careful examination.

 The origin of three elasses of Rishis is detailed in quotation **1.** The Bramha-Rishis came first. From them the second set styled Deva-Rishis originated. From the Deva-Rishis again the third set known as Raja-Rishis originated. Those who take us or lead us to the Bramhan direct aredefined as Bramha-Rishis, and those leading to the Devas are Deva-Rishis; and the rulers who lead and guide their subjects by pleasing them are styled Raja-Rishis. The last set alone demands some explanation. But any doubts with regard to their definitions will be cleared when we examine their whereabouts. The Bramha-Rishis are said to inhabit

the Brainha-loka, the Deva. Rishis, the Deva-loka and the Raja -Rishis the Indra-loka.

**ब्रह्मलोकप्रतिष्ठास्तु स्मृता ब्रह्मर्षयो मताः।  
देवलोकप्रतिष्ठाश्च ज्ञेया देवर्षयः शुभाः।  
इन्द्रलोकप्रतिष्ठास्तु सर्वे राजर्षयो मताः॥**

It is indeed surpsising to note that no Rishi has his residence in any of the modern towns or even forests situated on the surface of our mother earth.

 The above classification is said to be based upon their caste, their Tapas and the nature of the Manthras attributed to them.

**अभिजात्या च तपसा मन्त्रव्याहरणैस्तथा।  
एवं ब्रह्मर्षयः प्रोक्ता दिव्या राजर्षयस्तु ये।  
सप्तैते सप्तभिश्चैव गुणैःसप्तर्षयः स्मृताः॥**

What is meant by their caste is clearly explained in quotation 5. They are divided into the five following castes and are said to represent the knowledge of Avyakta, Mahat, Ahamkara, Bhuta and Indriya.

 1. Avyakta-Atma: 2. Mahanta-Atma; 3. Ahomkara-Atma; 4. Bhuta-Atma and 5. Indriya-Atma respectively.

**अव्यक्तात्मा महान्तात्माहङ्कारात्मा तथैव च।  
भूतात्मा चेन्द्रियात्मा च तेषां तज्ञानमुच्यते।  
इत्येवमृषिजात्यस्तु पञ्चधा नाम विश्रुताः॥**

It would certainly be a pity still to doubt the significance of the Rishis and equally a hopeless task to furnish further explanations. The Lokas specified, represent the respective stages attributed to the Rishis and the Sastras pertaining to those Lokas are instructions for attaining them. All these are said to be the productions of the Rishis themselves, in quotation 7.

**लोकान् सञ्चिन्त्य मनसा ततः शास्त्रं प्रचक्रिरे॥**

 The Lokas are identical with the psychological matters specified and are simply so describe for the purpose of making them easily understandable to the ordinary people. But unfortunately they are entirely misun lorstood and the object aimed at is frustrated completely in modern days.

 'लोक्यत इतिलोकः। ब्रह्मैवलोको ब्रह्मलोकः॥ब्रह्मणः पुरं ब्रह्मपुरमिति तदुपलब्धिस्थानं विद्याधिकारिशरीरमुच्यते॥

 न तस्य प्राणा उत्क्रामन्त्यत्रैव समवलीयन्ते। ब्रह्मैव सन् ब्रह्माप्येति॥

 "Lokya refers to reality. Bramha-loka is Bramha itself. Bramha-pura means the region or situation in which Bramha is attained, and this alludes to the qualifiel body of the Yogi. Attaining Bramhan is becoming Bramhan".

 Nothing could be more plainly explained in any human language. But the Pandit discards every human language as he has secured a different one for himself. In his language, everything in his universe is material.

**द्वैतमेव हि सर्वत्र प्रवदन्ति हि केचन।  
न ते मनुष्याः कीटाश्च पतङ्गाश्च घटा हि ते॥**

 From the enquiry so far regarding the significance of the terms conncetel with different forms of Rishis, the philosophical applications are simple and clear; and they do not of course demand any mysterious explanations to understand them in their proper light. This portion of philosophy, as a subject, stripped of its religious references to the point in question, is the common property of all civilized nations, and we have therefore the right to appeal to the philosophers all over the world for its safety, without being meddled with, by illogical and unphilosophical processes. On the pretext of religion, neither our Pandit nor the Theosophist has the privilege of interfering with God-given Intellect and wisdom in man, of ancient or modern

times. Any infringement in this direction could only be treated as an unreasonable and unsuthorisei attack upon Human Reason itself.

 The religious utilization of the philosophical principles in this connection, could be perceived to rest on a scientific basis, provided the philosophy underlying, is properly understood. The Pandit's ignorant interpretations without the knowledge of this philosophy are totally misleadingand the foreign alditions not even independently of the texts, are stranger still. The Theosophists freely quote pissages from Vayu, Vishnu, Padma and other Puranas and base their inferences on thom for their peculiar ideas, entirely new to our religious sphere, such as, spiritual ares and Physical arcs, Astral phantoms and Prototypes, Primaries and doubles &c. That the Rakshasas are the Atlantians belonging to the submerged races, that Varahà-Avatar is an antediluvian lacustrine auimal and that Americans and Europeans belong to the present 5th root-race, and similar theories promulgated in the Secret Doctrine, are certainly astonishing interpretations of our ancient religious texts, and they exhibit no doubt an entirely new method of manufacturing religious absurdities in the commencement of this twentieth century. What strikes one clearly here is that borrowed feathers were hardly needed, if the object were only to shine in this unique fashion.

**झटिति प्रतिवक्तव्यं सभासु विजिगीषुभिः।  
अबद्धं वा सुबद्धं वा कुन्तीपुत्रो विनायकः।  
उच्चैरुच्चरितव्यं यत्किञ्चिदजानतापि पुरुषेण।  
मूर्खा विश्वास्यन्ते विदुषामपि संशयो भवति॥**

 In further proof of the explanations already offered for Rishis in general, a few more terms which possess the appearance of proper names given to individual Rishis may be examined here.

 Quotations 1 and 10 define Vasishta as connected with Prithivi and Vak.

**वसुमध्यात्समुत्पन्नो वसुमान् वसुधाश्रयः।  
वसिष्ठ इति तत्वज्ञैः प्रोच्यते ब्रह्मवादिभिः॥  
वाग्वैवसिष्ठा वसिष्ठः स्वानां भवत्यपि च॥**

Prithivi or earth is here meant to represent the Vedas, the very foundation upon which our sacred religion is built. Vak or word similarly denotes the knowledge of Sruthi or Vedas.

 Quotations 2, 14 and 15 explain Arundhathi, the wife of Vasishta, as referring to the saine Prithivi. She is also defined as representing the tongue and the Goddess Saraswathy.

**पृथिवीविषयं सर्वम्अरुन्धत्यामजायत॥  
अरुन्धत्येव कथिता पुराविद्भिस्सरस्वती॥  
अरुन्धती भवेजिह्वा॥**

 No clearer descriptions are here required to understand the significance of these two terms. The husband of Arundhati here by no mears can act without the help of this particular wife and she has always to depend upon this very husband to maintain her dignity and importance.

 Quotation 6 explains Vyasa as the analyser and commentator of the Vedas exhibiting their true purport; thus referring to that particular faculty.

 Quotation 7 explains Kapila as seated in the sun combined with Vidya aud referring to Sankhya-gnana.

 Quotations 7, 8 and 9 define Sanat-kumara in unequivocal terms, as representing Jiva or individual soul, untainted by worldly filth and remaining as pure as it was while first born as the son of Bramha.

 Quotation 10 describes Angiras as tantamount to Prana. Brahaspathi and Atri are said to be connected with Vak or Vedas and therefore almost synonymous with Vasishta.

 Quotation 11 explains Dettatreya as Eswara who offered himself to Atri as his son, and notes that the Nirukta of this word will furnish complete information.

 Quotation 15 explains three more words, than Arundhati already noticed. Dhruva, Vishnu-pada and Matri-mandala, are described as the end of the nose, the spot between the brows and the two eyes respectively.

 Quotation 13 gives the full history of Markandeya-Rishi. It is plainly stated that the Rishi represents Viveka, distinguishing, analysing Intellect. Yema or death who is said to have attacked him, signifies Ignorance. Yema's noose stands for the absence of philosophical insight; and the fear of Death is caused by the idea of Duality and the absence of the knowledge of Unity. Dekshina-murti or Siva who is said to have saved the Rishi from Death is equally well explained. Dekshina is defined as Semushi or Intellect and the effect of constantly  
developing it in the right direction and extricating all the worldly dross from it is the God Siva himself.

**तुषेण बद्धो व्रीहिस्यात् तुषाभावेन तण्डुलः।  
एवं बद्धस्तथा जीवः कर्मनाशे सदाशिवः।  
पाशबद्धस्तथा जीवःपाशमुक्तस्सदाशिवः॥**

No plainer explanation is needed to understand this subject provided one is gifted with ordinary human reason.

 Mrikanduja or Markandeya can also be known by a reference to its root meaning. Mri to kill and Kandu, itch or filth. The Intellect freed from sinful or evil thoughts and desires, is the idea expressed by the term.

 Quotation 12 gives a detailed description of Suka and Vamadeva, which could on no account be mistaken for any current ideas as to their being two real personages. They are clearly explained as two different paths for the attainment of salvation. Suka-marga is explained as so named on account of its possibility to soar high at once like a bird and it distinctly refers to Sankhya-gnana. Vamadeva means to crawl slowly like an ant, and the Marga or path namedafter him represents the process of obtaining gradual progress,. overcoming the difficulties that intervene by long periods of trouble and effort. This path distinctly refers to the Karma-yoga. The two sets of Sapta-Rishis noticed in this para refer to the same differentiation. The distinction between these two paths of Yogas we have elaborately treated in Chapter II; and it may be observed here that they are not religious processes left to the free option or selection of man, but that they chiefly depend upon his qualifications for practice. As it is a matter of vital importance commonly misunderstood, a few lines from the passage quoted before, may be profitably noted below with a view to remind us of the qualifications insisted upon for their practice.

**स्वसंवेद्यं हि तद्ब्रह्म कुमारी स्त्रीसुखं यथा।  
अयोगी नैव जानाति जात्यन्ध इव वर्णिकान्।  
बहुव्याकुलचित्तानां विचारात्तत्वधीर्न हि।  
योगो मुख्यस्ततस्तेषां धीदर्पस्तेन नश्यति।  
अव्याकुलधियां मोहमात्रेणाच्छादितात्मनाम्।  
सांख्यनामा विचारस्यात् मुख्यो झटितिसिद्धिदः॥**

 Quotation 6 describes Viswamithra as the friend of all, towards whom everything rushes and in whoin everything joins, representing thereby the Reasoning Faculty in man known as Mauana. We have just before seen that Vasishta represents Sruti or Vedas and Manana is the next stage. New

facts learned from the Vedas are thought over for understnading them, and very often doubts arise for their immediate conviction. This idea is generally described as quarrels taking place between the two Rishis, and Vasishta of course triumphing at last over Viswamitra. We seldom hear stories of other Rishis quarrelling in this manner.

 We must however stop with the subject here, as it is neither convenient nor necessary to give an exhaustive treatment of all the Rishis mentioned in the texts. Explanations may be offered wherever new names are introduced in the subsequent portions of this treatise. But it is hoped that the general formulas and explanations already furnished will enable the readers to find out for themselves the real clue to the significance of new names appearing in the religious literature.

 **11.** Before closing this section, I feel it my duty to offer a word of apology to our venerable Pandits and Theosophists for the few unavoidable romarks I was compelled to make against their interpretations of our religious texts. It must anyhow be admitted that I have brought no fresh charges against them now, in behalf of the correct understanding of the important items explained in this little essay. Hinduisın versus Pandit and Theosophy, has virtually been an old case long pending in India, and I have only placed the two in their proper order, the Pandit appearing as the first and the Theosophist as the second. In justice to the earnest work done by the latter, I am strongly of opinion that all the current criticisms against Theosophy are uncharitable to say the least. Theosophy minus Hinduism we have absolutely no right to attack, and even the existing criticisms against its method of interpreting our religion are more or less whimsical and cowardly. It is surely unprofitable, and discourteous on our part to rejoice over its recent

confusions in the Mission. Even supposing that Theosophy leaves India for good, one of these days, there is not the slightest assurance of our countrymen not being ready to swallow any other sophy or ism that might at any future time, make its appearance in the lanl, armed with further modifications and explanations for our holy religion. The most shameful and culpable fact of our own ignorance of the subject, still remains intact, and no hopeful signs of improvement in the near future combined with the necessary zeal and earnestness to make up for the great fall for a few centuries past, are yet clearly visible. In the history of the Religions of the world, we at present really occupy a very unique and pitiable position, the natural result of our own indifference and lethargy. Our Pandit has gradually lost his dignified status, once commanded and gladly recognised in the country, by his deterioration in erudition, general knowledge and even self-respect, and he has virtually dwindled into one of the inutilities of a nation, still lingering by sheer force of existence. No similar charges could however be laid at the door of the Theosophist who is invariably a cultured gentleman, unfortunately misled in his attempt to do some useful work by his mistaken method of procedure. He is certainly amenable to reason aud conviction and is capable of turning to good account. The Pandit on the other hand has clearly washed his hands off everything useful and reasonable and simply stands stubborn in an uncouth fashion. These are bare facts which we could not afford to conceal in the interest of truth.

**Summary of the first three Chapters.**

 Part I of this essay has to be concluded by the end of this Chapter, having by this time examined the preparatory

details necessary to enable us to proceed with the main subject conveniently, in a convincing style of treatment. A general survey of what has been hitherto done for this purpose may be useful to keep us reminded of the important facts noticed in these three Chapters, with a view to apply them readily for the correct interpretations of terms and ideas demanding explanations in the subsequent pages forming Part II of this book.

 Chapter I has been set apart almost as an introductory one to explain and prove the absurd and injurious conclusions, both scientific and religious, to which the current interpretations, local and foreign, are unconsciously but inevitably drifting. Apparent geographical descriptions and specifications of time as well as religious personalities treated in our ancient religious literature, have been shown to refer to serious and religious matters, and that their modern interpretations are not only unsatisfactory, but are also so irrelevant and incoherent that they furnish no respectable informations of any kind useful to mankind. We have also noticed in this Chapter that the literature in question is the product of literary giants, apart from its scientific and religious importance, and could not therefore be easily condemned as worthless or explained away in the present careless fashion, without clearly exhibiting one's own ignorance,impertinence, bias or apathy. Sufficient instances have also been cited to show that the current silly method of interpretation as well as the irresponsible undertakings to calumnise are unwarranted and unjustifiable. In the circumstances detailed above, we have seen that a complete and searching enquiry was absolutely necessary to be instituted, in justice to the dignity and usefulness of the subject as well as to the veneration and gratitude due to the ancient sages as compilers of the texts, in which they have bequeathed volumes

of immense wisdom and knowledge for the real benefit of their beloved posterity. Chapter II was thus started to examine as clearly as possible the nature and scope of the varieties of religious literature owned by our countrymen, for ages yet unknown to the modern Historian and Archæologist. We have been able to see on enquiry that the knowledge required for religious perfection is described as twofold, consisting of the Para and Apara Vidyas, of which the former is reckoned as the ultimate knowledge by experience, which could be secured only by virtue of devotional practices specially prescribed in the Apara-vidy. The theoretical and practical portions of the subject have thus been clearly distinguished in the very beginning and the theoretical consisting of texts furnishing full instructions on the subject has been divided into 14 Vidyas, starting with the Vedas themselves. The scope and application of the Puranas and Itihasas falling within this classification have been particularly examined in detail, and we have found that they clearly refer to the treatinent of Sabda-Bramhan, Apara-Bramhan or Purana-Purusha, and its latent energies and glories discovered and utilized by the ancient sages for religious advancement by meditations on their evolutionary and involutionary effects.We have also thereby distinctly understood that the Puranic stories containing apparent descriptions of places, times and personalities as well as of creations, preservations and destructions of worlds such as 14 Lokas, Bramhandas &c, tell tales of far more serious matters than those connected with this evanescent material world and its still more transient and pigmy inhabitants.

 Thus far we have examined the general significance of the subjects and their texts comprising our ancient religious

literature in Section I of this Chapter. It must however be specially noticed here that all the above explanations are entirely based upon original passages selected from authontic texts and that no personal views have been ventured to be foisted on the public, like most of the attempts of modern critics which are often conspicuous by the entire absence of any such authority.

 The next and most important subject dealt with in the remaining portion of this Chapter, Section II, is the Hindu Philosophy as applied specially to our ancient religion. This subject however has taken up more space than was originally expected, consistent with the size and scope of this little essay, on account of its being the very foundation upon which the whole religion with its various grades and stages for practical application, is constructed. There is of course a general and reasonable impression prevailing amongst all intelligent enquirers of Indian affairs, that every national movement in India, Political, social or artistic is based uponsome religious conviction working like an undercurrent. But the further fact, of religious convictions having invariably originated ages ago, from their corresponding and long established philosophical foundations, has unfortunately been now forgotten and it therefore urgently demands its recognition in the permanent interest of our religion as a whole. The existing differences of views and uncertainties as to the details of various matters relating to our religion, accepted as it is in its general scope and function, can be easily and conveniently traced to the ignorance of the fundamental and philosophical principles, and a correct knowledge of the same is hopefully expected to set things aright. An examination of the several important points of philosophy as explained in the religious texts has clearly proved that they are by no means liable to be contradicted oven by the most recent

facts established in Western Philosophy. On the contrary, we have seen that many a new and grand theory of the modern day has been foretold and practically utilized, showing how familiar the ideas were to the ancient sages. In the comparison of Western with Eastern philosophy several important facts new to the former are found enunciated in the latter; and philosophy as a practical subject closely connected with our religion for the tangible attainment of the ultimate goal and summum-bonum of human existence is probably a fact yet altogether u known and undiscovered in the West. Greatly astonishing as this might appear to the Western philosopher and Critic, in spite of the historical and archaeological progress attained in their land,no biased or illogical criticisins put forward even in the strongest terms would be of any avail, as the facts explained in our philosophy are proved by the direct experience of venerable sages whose processes of reasoning and observation in themselves, are not yet uuderstood by the Western nations. The tendency not rarely exhibited in offering criticisms without proper study and earnest enquiry in the required direction, could only meet with ultimate failure, as abuses andsneers which are often the well-known arguments used on such occasions are not acceptable in the discussions of serious philosophical problems. Under the existing circumstances, the most profitable and the most honorable course for the Western philosophers would be to shake hands with the Easterns and put their shoulders together, with the broadest sympathy possible, for the purpose of recovering and resuscitating the lost treasures of humanity at large, viewed as the same creation of the Almighty One. If only the quantity of energy that might be voluntarily wasted for unnecessary criticisms be utilized for this purpose, inuch useful progress might soon be expected. A few simple facts explained in

this Chapter might again be noticed in this connection, lest they be lost amidst the crowd of descriptions under this heading.

 (a) It can be freely noticed, throughout the Upanishads and other texts, that the very style of describing the Bramhan, is highly practical and hopeful. No tinge of pessimism or uncertainty or even indefiniteness is ever attached to it, although they are often mistakenly attributed to the ultimate aim of our philosophy. The following few lines from the various quotations furnished in this Chapter, are worthy of notice.

**दारिद्र्याशा यथा नास्ति सम्पन्नस्य तथा मम।  
ब्रह्मानन्दे निमग्नस्य विषयाशा न तद्भवेत्॥**

**अजकुक्षौ गजो नास्ति ह्यात्मकुक्षौ जगन्न हि॥**

**कीदृक्तर्हीति चेत्पृच्छेदीदृक्ता नास्ति तत्र हि।  
यदनीदृक् अतादृक्चतत्स्वरूपं विनिश्चिनु।  
अक्षाणां विषयस्त्वीदृक् च परोक्षस्तादृगुच्यते।  
विषयी नाक्षविषयःस्वत्वान्नास्य परोक्षता॥**

**शक्येषु बाधितेष्वन्ते शिष्यते यत्तदेव तत्।  
सर्वबाधे न किञ्चिच्चेत् यन्नकिञ्चित्तदेव तत्।  
भाषा एवात्र भिद्यन्ते निर्बाधं तावदस्ति हि॥**

 (b) In the logical analysis of material and efficient causes, the former called Upadana-karana, as explained in the texts, is divided into three classes; Arambha, Parinami and Vivarta, the last being assigned for the explanation of the whole cosmological conception. Vivarta refers to theappearance of a change in the material without an actual change. This is probably a piece of additional information worth the notice of a Western Logician.

**अवस्थान्तरभानन्तु विवर्तोरज्जुसर्पवत्।**

**निरंशेप्यस्त्यसौ व्योम्नि तलमालिन्य कल्पनात्।  
ततो निरंश आनन्दे विवर्तोजगदिष्यताम्॥**

 (c) The evoluion and destruction of the universe cannot be attributed to Nature, nor to Karma in itself, nor again to Eswara alone. A combination of the individual's Karmas and the enforcement of the Karmic law by Eswara who is himself the law-giver, must be accepted as the real cause. This is also an acknowledged theory in the texts and peculiar to Eastern Philosophy.

**न स्वभावाज्जगज्जन्म स्थितिध्वंसा मुनीश्वराः।  
न मया केवलेनापि न च केवलकर्मणा।  
प्राणिनां कर्मपाकेन मया च मुनिसत्तमाः।  
जगतः सम्भवो नाशः स्थितिश्च भवति द्विजाः।  
एवं कर्मानुरूपेण जगज्जन्मादि यन्मया।  
एव स्वभावो विप्रेन्द्राः इति वेदार्थनिर्णयः॥**

 (d) With regard to the vexed question of Free-will and Necessity, a very simple and reasonable solution is offered in the texts and it deserves the attention of those interested in Western Moral Philosophy. The unavoidable dependence on Atma accepts Necessity, but the Free-will of the in lividual is granted for action. Atina here is compared to the sun during the day setting every living being to work which is done according to its own Free-will.

**आत्मचैतन्यमाश्रित्य देहेन्द्रियमनोधियः।  
स्वकीयार्थेषु वर्तन्ते सूर्यालोकं यथा जनाः॥**

 (e) The most important theory in our philosophy, perhaps yet unrecognised in the Western systems, but nevertheless the most valuable one in the interest of our religion is that found clearly mentioned in the texts, explaining the status and function of Reason or Budhi. Our philosophy does not stop with Budhi as the ultimate known factor in

the philosophical analysis, but goes far beyond it. The existence of Jiva and Eswara as higher items distinct from Budhi is philosophically established in all the ancient texts. The Budhistic theories or those that stop with Budhi as the name itself signifies, are therefore rejected on religious as well as philosophical grounds. Budhi in spite of its high rank amidst the senses, is reckoned only as ephemeral as any of them. This is the most vital though a most knotty point of difference ever destined to continue in our philosophy as compared with many other known systems, until Atheisms become Theisms in all of them. The following few lines on the subject will doubtless furnish ample scope for a real philosopher to ponder on.

**बुद्धेरचित्वं संग्राह्यं दृष्टत्वाज्जन्मनाशयोः।  
बुद्धेरन्यश्चिदाभासः प्रवेशश्श्रुतिषु श्रुतः।  
न हि धीभावभावित्वादाभासोस्ति धियः पृथक्।  
इति चेदल्पमेवोक्तं धीरप्येवं स्वदेहतः।  
आत्मा प्रवेशं संङ्कल्प्य प्रविष्ट इति गीयते।  
कथं प्रचिष्टोऽसङ्गश्चेत्सृष्टिर्वास्य कथं वद॥**

 Having explained in Section II of this chapter the necessary philosophical points to estabblish the existence of Bramhan, the practical methods prescribed for attaining to that coveted position are detailed, namely Gnana-yoga and Karmayoga. The results of the practice of these Yogas are known by self-experience, and the consequent bliss and freedom from pain are therefore matters which demand no extraneous proofs. The following will corroborate thestatement here made.

**लोकेस्मिन् द्विविधा निष्ठापुरा प्रोक्ता मयानघ।  
ज्ञानयोगेन सांख्यानां कर्मयोगेन योगिनाम्।  
अधिष्ठानं समस्तस्य जगतस्सत्यचिद्धनम्।**

**अहमस्मीति निश्चित्य वीतशोको भवेन्मुनिः।  
स्वशरीरे स्वयं ज्योतिः स्वरूपं सर्वसाक्षिणम्।  
क्षीणदोषाः प्रपश्यन्ति नेतरे मायया वृताः।  
अधिष्ठाने तथा ज्ञाते प्रपञ्चे शून्यतां गते।  
देहस्यापि प्रपञ्चत्वात् प्रारब्धावस्थितिः कुतः।  
विज्ञातब्रह्मतत्वस्य यथा पूर्वे न संसृतिः।  
अस्ति चेन्नसविज्ञातब्रह्मभावो बहिर्मुखः॥**

**तिष्ठत्ययं कथं देहः इति शङ्कावतो जडान्।  
समाधातुं बाह्यदृष्ट्या प्रारब्धं वदति श्रुतिः।  
न तु देहादिसत्यत्वबोधनाय विपश्चिताम्॥**

 Besides the possibility of attaining the ultimate goal, the collateral effects of Yoga called Sidhis are also detailed in this section; and they are also specially noticed as not being generally exhibited by real Yogis, nor even valued by them. Any desire to make use of them when involuntarily secured, will bring about the downfall of the Yogi from his main and legitimate course. Deceiving exhibitions of some of the Sidhis described in the texts, by those who are neither Yogis nor even respectable men, are occasionally heard, and they deserve to be treated only like the work of pretenders and cheats in other lines. Such practices are not only wrong morally, but are also serious sins religiously, having been committed in the name of God. The real Yogi is ever watchful that he is not led away by the superhuman powers he may obtain, as he always understands them as severe and alluring trials in his onward path. The following lines represent the true view of the Yogi with regard to them.

**मोक्षस्य बहवश्शास्त्रे प्रोच्यन्ते प्रतिबन्धकाः।  
अणिमादीच्छया तुल्यः प्रतिबन्धो न कश्चन।  
ब्रह्मद्रोह गुरुद्रोह शिवद्रोहादि पातकम्।  
अन्यच्च पातकं सर्वे सिद्धिरूपेण वर्तते॥**

 The last but not the least important fact noted in this Chapter is the necessity for the combined practice, simultaneously, of three processes prescribed for the attainment of salvation, namely, Vasana-ksheya, Mano-nasa and Vijgnana. Vasana ksheya is the destruction of particular tendencies created in the mind by previous effects of actions. Mano-nasa is controlling the natural and ordinary functions of the mind ever tending to exert itself. Vijgnana is the knowledge of philosophy. They mutually influence each other and should be practised together to be effective. An ignorance of this fact is likely to mislead many and lead to failures in the religious practices. Without the knowledge of philosophy the object aimed at by the prescribed religious ordinances could not be understood and practised with the necessary conviction and earnestness. All unnecessary criticisms against Hindu rituals and ceremonies will certainly vanish, if only the fact that they are so regulated as to serve the objects specified here, is clearly recognised. The following lines on the subject are worth particular attention.

**यावद्विलीनं न मनो न तावद्वासनाक्षयः।  
न क्षीणा वसना यावच्चित्तं तावन्न शाम्यति।  
यावन्न तत्वविज्ञानं तावच्चित्तशमः कुतः।  
यावन्न चित्तोपशमो न तावत्तत्ववेदनम्।  
यावन्नवासनानाशः तावत्तत्वागमः कुतः।  
यावन्नतत्वसम्प्राप्तिःन तावद्वासनाक्षयः।  
वासनाक्षय विज्ञान मनोनाशा महामते।  
समकालं चिराभ्यस्ता भवन्ति फलदा मताः।  
त्रय एवं समं यावन्नाभ्यस्ताश्च पुनः पुनः।  
तावन्न पदसम्प्राप्तिर्भवत्यपि समा शतैः॥**

 Having thus furnished in Chapter II a general outline of, (1) the nature of the religious texts, (2) the philoso-

phical principles and formulas underlying our religion, and (3) the suitable procedure prescribed for the attainment of the highest goal; the Puranas and Itihasas, which act the part of a practical commentary to the Vedas, is examined in chapter III.

इतिहासपुराणाभ्यां वेदं समुपबृंहयेत्॥

 For the sake of clearness and convenience, the subject has been divided into three main and comprehensive headings, Place, Time and Personalities. The general impression being that the Puranas and Itihasas treat of ordinary geography and human history, all possible forms of misconstruing the contents of the texts must fall within the above classification. There are of course two methods for discovering the mistakes in the current interpretations. The first is by admitting the interpretations given and continuing them in the same style to some extent, we soon arrive at irrelevant and absurd conclusions. This is exactly what we have done in Chapter I. The second and more useful method is by enquiring into the correct definitions of terins used in the texts by the collection of available internal evidence aud thus rectifying the mistakes in the interpretations. This too we have done to some extent in Chapter III, and It is hoped that the enquiries already made will suffice for understanding the general purport of the so-called Histories and Geographies contained in the Puranas ant Itihasas. Besides, the scope of the subject of this Essay, namely 'The Permanent History of Bharata-Varsha' as narrated inthe Itihasas known as the Ramayana and the Maha-Bharata, is very limited, and the means secured already for arriving at correct interpretations, will more than ineet the actual requirements.

 The subject of this essay will thus commence with Volume II, Chapter IV and the preceding chapters contairing several original quotations from recognised religious texts will be referred to as authority for all the necessary interpretations.

 It must be acknowledged that a few centuries ago, an elaborate introduction of the sort contained in the first three chapters, would certainly have appeared frivolous and unnecessary, and that it would doubtless be so to a real native Pandit even at the present day. But we are however not in the least prepared to deny the existence of learned Pandits in the land, on the contrary, we most earnestly pray the Almighty to fill the country with such venerable religiousguides. As a matter of fact, we extremely regret that our poor mortal eyes do not at present catch the sight of any of them to help us out of our existing difficulties. It night possibly be that they are hiding themselves to avoid contamination with the modern generation that has left them and has taken to Western civilization. Whatever might be their excuse, the present state of our helplessness, is a stern fact demanding an urgent remedy from whatsoever source possible. A few foreigners themselves were induced to take pity on us some years ago and they have been trying their best to help us, although the result of their labours so far as our religion was concerned, somehow ended in failure. It must here be noticed to the credit or otherwise of the Pandit, that during these years the new foreign creed has been at work in hisown country, he has been equally silent. We could therefore safely hope that the local Pandit will let us alone in our attempt to help ourselves in spite of our evident incapacities. We could gratefully have welcomed the cooperation of the Pandits in the matter, but it is too long since they have altogether forsaken us. In a pitiable condi-

tion of this sort in which none could be found to fall upon for help, we are compelled to make the best of our own resources.

**मातुलस्य बलं माता जामातुर्दुहिता बलम्।  
श्रशुरस्य बलं भार्या स्वयमेवातिथेर्बलम्॥**

 In conclusion, I feel most happy to express my heartfelt thanks and gratefulness for the sympathy and interest already evinced by several of my friends and well-wishers, at whose pressure, I have here ventured to publish the first three chapters as the first volume, the main subject in the essay being dealt with beyond these chapters. The remaining three chapters have yet to be printed and some portions have even to be written hereafter. I have no doubt that the interest now exhibited is more on account of the curiosity in the crude views that have almost tickled their feelings already, than in any excellence of treatment, which the essay never professed to claim from its very commencement. There are no new topics dealt with anywhere within it, and the texts on the whole particularly belong to the oldest period imaginable. It is therefore earnestly hoped that all the serious faults in the book will be kindly over-looked and rectified as far as convenient for the purpose of securing additional enlightenment and for the creation of a sincere scientific interest, particularly to the legitimate heirs to the sacred religious literature.

**PREFACE.**  
**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

 The first Volume of this essay virtually serves the part of a necessary chapter on the definition of terms, generally found at the beginning of every book scientifically dealing with any technical subject. We have accordingly been examining in detail, to some extent, the real import of the various technical terms used in our religious literature, and have also been noticing the exact method of applying the Puranic style of treatment adopted throughout, for the correct interpretation of the sacred texts. By the enquiries therein made, we have satisfactorily found, that by closely and sincerely following this expressly prescribed method, one could easily perceive that the irrelevancies and incoherencies, anachronisms and interpolations, mysticisms and occultisms invariably attributed in recent years almost to every valuable religious text connected with our ancient religion, are only mistaken discoveries in the field resulting from the remnants of barbarisms still lurking stealthily among humanity in these enlightened days of civilization. A proper examination of the texts with moderate sympathy and interest is sure to disclose on the other hand that every apparent story told is a piece of valuable scientific instruction handed down by the venerable authors to their beloved posterity. From the very definitions of Puranas and Itihasas examined, it is perfectly clear that they unequivocally refer to the treatment of what is technically described as Sabda-Bramhan, the form of the formless, the glories of the Almighty, Omnipresent and Omniscient Purana-Purusha, the Eswara and Lord of all.

**यस्मिन् पुरा ह्यनन्तीदं पुराणं तेन वै स्मृतम्॥**

 "The eternal entity from which everything has originated is called Puranom." It is the scope and privilege of the sacred Velas to deal with this and this Sabda-bramban alone. The Puranas and Itihasas are elaborate commentaries of the Vedas, explaining the details in a very lucid style for the benefit of the lower orders of society not sufficiently gifted with the necessary intellectual capacities to catch the true import of the Vedas directly and all at once.

**इतिहासपुराणाभ्यां वेदं समुपबृह्मयेत्॥**

 "Understand the Vedas by the study of their commentaries called Puranas and Itihasas."

 There are no difficulties of any kind now for us to believe that in the Vedas, Puranas and Itihasas, there are no human histories of deceased monarchs and extinct nationalities who once inhabited the surface of the submerged or raised up-regions in this earthy globe. Nor is any effort needed-to understand that the subject as clearly defined in the literature, could on no account be connected with the historical ideas of Time as classified into B. Cs. and A. Ds.

 The common prevailing mistake of interpreting these purely scientific treatises as histories and geographies of ancient India originates at the very outset froin sheer ignorance of the simple definitions of even single terms technically used in the literature. Immense confusions are gradually added by a display of perverted ingenuity in the interpretations of phrases, sentences and statements of scientific facts, propelled by the preconceived opinions and self-conceited boldness. The current mistakes in this direction may be completely enumerated by a general classi-

fication of them into mistakes in the interpretation of apparent Places, apparent Times and apparent Personalities. These have been examined in detail in the last Chapter of Volume I, and it was clearly found that the current interpretations are entirely unwarrantel and that all thecriticisms hitherto furnished on the supposed grounds of inconsistencies and incoherencios are absolutely unmeritted and uncalled for. It was also almost surprisingly discovered that every word, expression or idea found in the literature is pregnant with scientificsignificance and value, in spite of the fact that they have been for a long time misinterpreted and caricatured by the modern Pandit so as to appear meaningless and irrelevant even to an unprejudiced eye. When the technical import of the terms used is correctly understood by a sensible reference to the texts themselves, the stories narrated by a wise combination of these apparent Places, Times and Personalitios, will disclose valuable religious instructions useful to mankind, furnished in a style exhibiting extremo skill and thorough knowledge.

 This is exactly what has been repeatedly alluded to in this essay as the Puranic style of treatment. This style of story telling in the description of scientific mattors, has been frequently explained as having been resorted to, only with a view to convey more easily and more impressively to the ordinary public, the highly abstract and philosophical ideas which could not otherwise be so conveniently grasped. vide page 12 Volume I.

**अन्यार्थेन परं ब्रह्म श्रुतिः साध्वी न तत्परा।  
चित्तपाकानुगुण्येन श्रोतॄणां परमा श्रुतिः।  
सोपानक्रमतो देवा मन्दं मन्दं हितं नृणाम्।**

**उपदिश्य विषण्डापि पुनः पक्वाधिकारिणः।  
एतदात्म्यमिदं सर्वमित्याह परमाद्वयम्॥**

**सूतसंहिता॥**

 "With a view to appeal to the variously qualified persons, the Sruti explains matters in disguise only with feelings of sorrow and pity, and taking them step by step to higher truths, declares at last when they are fully qualified, the whole truth that Bramhan is everything. The Sruti thus never wants to establish as absolutely true all that is described to them." For the purpose of enlightening the ordinary people in the manner above described, the ancient authors have explained valuable scientific truths in the guise of stories for conveying religious instructions. Suitable technical terms were coine and defined which in themselves would suggest their intended meanings by the very roots of their formation, known as Niruktom one of the six Angas of the Vedas. This is an unerring and convenient method of conveying useful informations of a technical character, allowing the least possible chance for misunderstanding. The root meanings are always available for reference as long as the Sanskrit language continues to exist, and all arbitrary and whimsical elucilations could, by the simple rules of Niraktom, be easily discovered to be entirely mistaken. The technical terms so coined were also carefully defined in the texts to prevent possibilities of error from the very beginning. All such terms will be found practically classified under three main heads as already noticed, denoting apparent specifications of Time, Place and Personality. This method is of course adopted with a view to secure necessary materials for treating the abstract subjects in a concrete style for the use of the lower orderes of mankind. Much skill is displayed even in this classification, which in

itself furnishes app ropriate distinctions among the matters classed under the three headings, which virtually include all the necessary materials for representation in concrete form. Having thus logically and ingeniously provided themselves with necessary preliminary requirements, the ancient authors com menced their benevolent work of communicating their scientific knowledge in the form of Puranas and Itihasas for the religious edification of mankind. What scientific facts these technical terms referring apparently to Places, Times and Personalities, actually convey as used in the religious texts, have been examined in Chapter III, Volume I, by citing original quotations which clearly furnish the proper definitions. It is needless therefore torepeat that all the modern misinterpretations contrary to these given definitions, are unauthorised, unwarranted and uncalled for. It does not therefore deinand much skill or effort for us to discover the simple fact of sheer ignorance in the current method of literal interpretation practised by our venerable Pandits. The foreign critics and their indigenous imitators, who entirely base their arguments on the informations furnished by the Pandit, are therefore naturally placed in a more pitiable condition so far as the means of obtaining correct knowledge of the subject is concerned. We do not of course feel impatiently irritated at their unreasonable criticisms, although they would completely tend to destroy altogether the value and sacredness of our religious texts, but we only condol with them for the waste of their valuable time and energy virtually caused by the indigenous Pandit. The Pandit no doubt has inexcusably led astray his own country-men as well as the innocent and earnest foreigner. He must however be given full credit for having mastered at present, the required means of acquiring the status of a Pandit without a study of the sacred subjects.

**जम्बूद्वीपस्य संस्थानं यज्ञिया यत्र वै क्रियाः॥**

**पद्मपुराणम्॥**

 "The region of devotional work is the region of Jambu-Dwipa."

 Thus, none of the material ideas unconnected with religious devotion could be brought under the holy region of Jaumbu-Dwipa. Bharata -Varsha, the southern end of this Dwipa has also been fully explained as referring to the sphere of humam karmas or religious acts performed inaccordance with the prescribed religious ordinances, and which save man from perdition by procuring him final emancipation in the long run. The term Bharata refers to that which supports man, and it is certain that nothing but divine favour which has to be secured by earnest devotion could be of any avail for this purpose. We can now clearly understand that the whole of our religious geography alludes only to the various devotional practices prescribed for religious advancement. All the ineidents narrated in the religious literature as connected with Jambu-Dwipa and Bharata-Varsha are therefore definite religious instructions furnished to mankind in the recognised Puranic style of treatment, for the purpose of actual performance. They do not therefore refer to past History, but they are intended for all time, past, present and future. All apparent Histories connected with Bharata-Varsha are thus permanent instructions furnished for the religious advancement of the human race in all parts of the globo, without distinctions of caste, creed, colour or sex. The title of this essay as the 'Permanent History of Bharata-Varsha,' was accordingly based upon this very fact in our religious literature. It is here contended that every bit of a story told in the sacred texts is a piece of valuable instruction conveyed

quite in consistency with the Puranic formulas hitherto explained, although it is not possible, within the limited scope of this essay to furnish exhaustive explanations on all such points. The main object of this essay, as has been repeatedly expressed is only to establish the existenceof this correct method of interpretation, which has for some time been buried in oblivion to the great detriment of the valuable contents of the sacred texts. A proper recognition of this fa ct will immediately remove all the difficulties now felt in the ir correct interpretations, clearly showing at the same time, that the unfavourable criticisms hitherto received have only originated from the innocent ignorance of this method of treatment adopted by our venerable authors. We must somehow consol ourselves for the present, for the past misfortunes in this direction. Everything in this material world has its days of fortune and misfortune, and as the irony of fate would have it, the sacred literature itself is perhaps no exception to the general rule.

**अयममृतनिधानं नायकोऽप्योषधीनाम्  
शतभिषगनुयातः शम्भुमूर्ध्नोऽवतंसः।  
विरहयति न चैनं राजयक्ष्मा शशांकम्  
हतविधिपरिपाकःकेन वा लंघनीयः॥**

 **3.**The specifications of apparent Time with its curious subdivisions into Parardhas, Kalpas, Manwantaras and Yugas next deserve careful consideration. The Yuga which is described as consisting of several thousands of years is virtually the lowest unit by whose multiplication the remaining items like the Manwantara and Parardha are calculated. It would however be a curious picece of information for our modern Pandit to know that the Yuga is explained as found only in the Bharata-Varsha, Vide page 308 Volume I.

**चत्वारि भारते वर्षे युगानि कवयोऽब्रुषम्।  
कृतं त्रेता द्वापरञ्च कलिश्चान्यत्र न क्वचित्॥**

**कूर्मपुराणम्॥**

 "There are four Yugas in the Bharata-Varsha, named Krita, Treta, Dwapara and Kali. These yugas are not found elsewhere."

 If the Yugas are here interpreted as alluding to the ordinary calculations of Time, as Bharata-Varsha is at present identified by the indigenous Pandit with the Indian Peninsula, it would surely be nothing short of lunacy to affirm that the yugas or calculations of time are inapplicable to the countries outside the limits of India. The mistake is too glaring to require further discussion. Yuga here plainly refers to yoga and the four separate yugas, the Manwanteras, Kalpas and Parardhas explain the different degrees of progress in yoga whose sphere is technically described as the devotional region of Bharata-Varsha; and hence all outside Bharata-Varsha is excluded from the calculation of yugas which allude to certain definitely prescribed conditions and not to sequences (vide page 907 Volume 1).

**सत्वं कृतं रजस्त्रेता द्वापरन्तु रजस्तमौ।  
कलौतमस्तु विज्ञेयं युगवृत्तवशेन तु॥**

**वायुपुराणम्॥**

Vides pages 310 & 311 Volume I.

**कालो वा कारणं राज्ञोराजा, वा कालकारणम्।  
इति ते संशयोमाभूद्राजा कालस्य कारणम्।  
कृतं त्रेता द्वापरञ्च कलिश्च भरतर्षभ।  
राजवृत्तानि सर्वाणि राजैव युगमुच्यते॥**

**शन्तिपर्व॥**

 "As regards the nature of the Yugas, Krita is Satwa ; Treta is Reja; Dwapara is a combination of Reja and Tamai and Kali is Tama."

 "You need not foster the least doubt as to whether the nature of time depends upon the character of the Raja, or the character of the Raja depends upon the nature of time. The nature of time is entirely shaped by the character of the Raja. The four Yugas named Krita, Treta, Dwapara and Kali allude to the history of the Raja, in fact, the Raja is himself the Yuga."

 The Puranic significance of these classifications of apparent Time is clearly explained above and the Raja here alludes to the Atman. or Individual Soul engaged in the work of yoga.

 This Yoga is divided into two alasses, namely, Karma-Yoga and Gnana-yoga, in accordance with the qualifications of those who desire to practise it, (vide page 94 Volume I.)

**लोकेऽस्मिन् द्विविधा निष्ठा पुरा प्रोक्ता मयामघ।  
ज्ञानयोगेन सांख्यानां कर्मयोगेन योगिनाम्॥**

**भगवद्गीता॥**

**बहुव्याकुलचित्तानां विचारात्तत्वभीर्नहि।  
योगो मुख्यस्ततस्तेषां धीदर्पस्तेन नश्यति।  
अव्याकुलधियां मोहमात्रेणाछादितात्मनाम्  
सांख्यनामा विचारःस्यान्मुख्यो झटिति सिद्धिदः॥**

**स्कन्दपुराणम्॥**

 "There are two paths prescribed for attaining salvation, Gnana-Yoga for the Sankhyas and Karma-yoga for the Yogins,"

 "Those who are given up to various wordly desires cannot perceive the truth by mere philosophical thought.

The practice of yoga is therefore prescribed for them for the purpose of rendering the mind calm and fit for superior work. But those who already possess serene minds and are merely ignorant, need practise only the Sankhya-yoga or the process of philosophical analysis and meditation."

 We are now in a position to judge for ourselves that the two varieties of yogas above noticed are alone the main subjects explained in our religious literature for the eternal benefit of mankind. The ideas of literal History and Geography in this concern are only the whimsical imaginations in the brains of the modern Pandit, which are not yet acquainted with the real contents of the sacred literature.

 We have doubtless understood by our humble enquiries so far, that the apparent Places and Times mentioned in the texts are only apparent and not literal, and that all of them allude to more serious matters than earthy localities or periods of historical time like B. Cs and A. Ds. If the learned Pandit will not still give up his mistaken notions of our hoary and holy religion, which he has carelessly formed without reading and understanding the original, it is impossible to deal with him by any methods of argumentation hitherto known to mankind.

**लभेत सिकतासु तैलमपि यत्नतः पीडयन्  
पिबेच्च मृगतृष्णिकासु सलिलं पिपासार्दितः।  
कदाचिदपि पर्यटञ्छशविशाणमासादये-  
न्नतु प्रतिनिविष्टमूर्खजनचित्तमाराधयेत्॥**

 **4.** Like the technical applications of the terms apparently denoting Time and Place as above noticed, the apparent Personalities technically refer to the various divinė bases to be understood and personally experiencod by the practice of the two kinds of yogas here specified. The conception of

Para-Bramhan, the ultimate terminus of our religious philosophy is beyond the grasp of thoughts and words.

**यतो वाचो निवर्तन्ते अप्राप्य मनसा सह॥ इतिश्रुतेः॥**

 The sacred Vedas and all the religious texts treated only of something below this Para-Bramhan, but closely pertaining to it and which is within the grasp of human Intellect. This is technically called Apara-Bramhan or Sabda-Bramhan, reaching which by the prescribed processes, man is said to be naturally transformed to the highest region of Para-bramhan.

**शब्दब्रह्मणि निष्णातः परं ब्रह्माधिगछति॥**

 This Sabdha-bramhan is thus undoubtedly the subject matter of the Puranas and Itihasas. It is known as Bramhakshetra, the body of Bramhan; Sakala-nishkala or Saguna-nirguna or Parapara, the form of the formless; and Purana-Purusha the Purusha or Being from whose sakti everything in the Universe has originated and whose glories are explained in the Puranas and Itihasas for the religious advancement of mankind. It represents virtually the Almighty, Omnipresent and Omniscient Eswara or the Lord of all, stationed within the body of man in close contact with the Jiva or Individual Soul. ( vide pages 57 & 58 Volurne II.)

**आत्मनो द्विविधं प्राहुः परापरविभेदतः।  
द्वे ब्रह्मणी वेदितव्ये इति चाथर्वणी श्रुतिः।  
परस्तु निर्गुणः प्रोक्तःअहङ्कारयुतोऽपरः।  
तयोरभेदविज्ञानं योग इत्यभिधीयते।  
एवं भूतात्मके देहे यःसाक्षी हृदये स्थितः।  
अपरः प्रोच्यते सद्भिः परमात्मा परः स्मृतः।  
शरीरं क्षेत्रमित्याहुस्तस्थः क्षेत्रज्ञ उच्यते।  
अव्यकः परमः शुद्धः परिपूर्ण उदाहृतः।**

**अकारादिक्षकारान्त वर्णभेदव्यवस्थितः।  
पुराणपुरुषोऽनादिः शब्दब्रह्मेति गीयते।  
पञ्चभूतात्मके देहे ह्यन्तःकरणसंयुतः।  
पुराणपुरुषो देवः अपरात्मेति कीर्त्यते॥**

**बृहन्नारदपुराणम्॥**

 "The Atharvana Sruti distinguishes two kinds of Atma, the Para and the Apara; the former is without attributes and the latter is combined with egoism. The knowledge of their unity is called yoga. Thus, the Atma seated in the heart within the physical body of man is called Apara-bramhan. Paramatma is Para-bramhan. The body of inan is called Kshetra and the Atman seated within it is Kshetragna. He remains in the form of Avyakta and Parama and determines the arrangements of the letters from: A to ksha. In the body made up of the five elements, thisAtma combined with the internal organs is known as Purana Purusha, Sabda-Bramhan and Aparatma.”

 Further subdivisions or glories of this Sabda-bramhan, consisting of the Triads, Bramha, Vishnu and Rudra, the various gods and goddesses, the Rishis and the Pitris, are all explained in detail in Chapter III, Volume I, as belong-ing to the holy region of this Sabda-Bramhan and as unconnected with the region of Avidya or material oration with which the modern Pandit has ignorantly commingled and contaminated the whole religious affair. (vide page 378, Volume I.)

**अविद्योपाधिको जीवो नमायोपाधिकः खलु।  
मायाकार्यगुणाछन्ना ब्रह्मविष्णुमहेश्वराः।  
मायोपाधिपरव्यूहा न जीवव्यूहसंस्थिताः॥**

**स्कान्दपुराणम्॥**

 "Jiva is the reflection of Bramhan in Avidya and not in Maya. Bramha, Vishnu and Rudra belong to the department of satwic Maya and not to the Avidya of Jiva".

 In the correct enquiries of our religious philosophy, we are unavoidably pushed down from the ultimate Parabramhan to the region of Eswara the Lord of all creation, for the religious dealings by the Jivas or Individual souls, which as they are constituted, cannot hope to soar higher than that region in their devotional exercises. This is a serious and stern fact which the modern pseudo-vedantins would be surprised to discover to their utter discredit and despondency. The so-called Vedantin is thus denied the possibilities of posing himself as a superior specimen of humanity by merely avoiding the prescribed processes for religious advancement, which however peremptorily prohibit, his unbridled conduct in the sphere of Ethics and religion. Man has to work earnestly, steadily and sincerely before he can hope to secure beneficial results in this direction. Deceipt and hypocrisy are entirely excluded from its programme. The valuable instructions contained in the religious literature are furnished with the express object of gradually raising the Jiva from its state of bondage to that of freedom and of leading it to the blissful region of the Almighty Eswara, beyond which it is the work of Eswara Himself to transport the Jiva. The following passages give a general description of the nature of Jiva and Eswara and of their mutual relation. (vide pages 82 & 89 Volume I.)

**द्वासुपर्णौ शरीरेऽस्मिन् जीवेशाख्यौ सह स्थितौ।  
तयोर्जीवःफलं भुङ्क्ते कर्मणा न महेश्वरः।  
केवलं साक्षिरूपेणविना भोगं महेश्वरः।

 "Two birds named Jiva and Eswara are seated together in this body, the former alone enjoying the fruits of action and the latter remaining unattached as a witness. The apparent differences between them are created only by ignorance." "The body of man is really the temple of Eswara who is virtually identical with the Jiva in it. When busk is removed from paddy, it is called rice, similarly the Jiva becomes Eswara when its bondage caused by the effects of karma is removed."

 Both Jiva and Eswara are here clearly explained as stationed within the same body, differing but apparentily between each other. Jiva is bound by the effects of karma while Eswara is free like a witness. The function of Eswara which is however different from that of Jiva at present, isexplained below.

 "He is Sarveswara or Lord of everything, because none can unmake the world which he makes. He is Sarvagna or omniscient, because he controls and works up the vasanas of all creatures and none can afford to oppose his action. He seats himself in the hearts of all as upon a machine which he works according to his own rigorous laws. Sruti and Smriti are his laws which none can violate with impunity. He creates the world exactly in conformity with the effects of the karmas of each indvidual and destroys the same while the karmic effects of each individual come to & close."

 The above is indeed a clearly understandable description of Eswara. He makes the law and enforces it among the Jivas in accordance with the merits of their karmas. His creation and destruction of the world are here plainly stated to be different for each individual accroding to the net results of the karmas of each. The unphilosophic modern Pandit would surely be thrown out of his wits when he hears of such a startling proposition. But it is certain that no Western philosopher is a stranger to this theory. It is

admitted everywhere that the cosmological conception of the illiterate is different from that of a philosopher or scientist. The function and action of Eswara un the whole seem to depend entirely upon the action and conduct of the individual Jiva which produce certain effects or vasanas upon which everything else is virtually founded. The required purification of this individual Jiva for the purpose of raising it to the blissful region of Eswara has therefore to be effected by the creation of useful vasanas and the destruction of evil ones. This is exactly the principle underlying the various processos prescribed for religious progress. vide page 93 Volum I.

**माण्डूक्योपनिषत्।**

 "The root of the samsara tree with its multitudes of branches is the mind. This root has therefore to be first dried up for the destruction of the tree. The processes for effecting this are not restricted in any manner. Either by squeezing the hands or biting the teeth or by any other

rough means, the mind 'must be somehow conquered. It matters not how this is done. But the most feasible and sensible methods are these, the study of philosophy, association with the wise and the pious, controlling the propensities of the mind, controlling and regulating breath &o. The propensities of the mind ate of two kinds, holy and unholy, the former tends to destroy future births and the latter to increase them. These cannot be alighted as they are the net results of the work of hundreds of past births and lives. They will not easily die out without long and constant efforts."

 We see clearly now that the Vasanas manufactured and retained by the Jiva have to be dealt with by itself in a sensible and serious manner, for the purpose of securing liberation from their bondage. We have already noticed that it is this bondage of karmas that keeps the Jiva awayfrom Eswara, and the task of approaching the Lord must therefore be necessarily hard and trying. Sincere devotion to God and earnest effort to relinquish evil and material desires, are the only possible means of attaining the Lord's blessed region. Few in this world could venture to come forward and assure us at present, as to their having done the best in either of these directions. The desire for material prosperity is all-powerful, and it is useless to pretend victory over the same, when it stands and dances before us with all the pride and pomp of a conqueror.

 **5.** We have now obtained a general idea of the reasonable contents of our sacred literature, as pertaining to valuable instructions useful for the religious advancement of man, and not as treating of incoherent History and absurd Geography unsuited even for the edification of schoolgoing children. We have also more or less understood the main object and intention of our venerable forefathers in their voluminous productions of the sacred texts for the permanent benefit of their beloved posterity.

 There are as already explained two main divisions in the classification of instructions furnished, named Yoga or Karma-Yoga, and Gnana or Gnana-yoga. The former refers to the process of removing all obstructions caused by mental agitations and disturbances, and the latter refers to the process of intellectual exercises leading to the correct perception of truth and the acquirement of proper knowledge. vide page 95 Volume I.

**द्वौ क्रमौ चित्तनाशस्य योगो ज्ञानं मुनीश्वर।  
योगस्तद्वृत्तिरोधो हि ज्ञानं सम्यगवेक्षणम्।  
तस्मिन्निरोधिते नूनम्उपशान्तं मनो भवेत्।  
मनस्पन्दोपशान्त्यायं संसारः प्रविलीयते।  
सूर्यालोकपरिस्पन्दशान्तौ व्यवहृतिर्यथा॥**

**शाण्डिल्योपनिषत्॥**

 "Two methods are prescribed for the subjugation of Chitha, named Yoga and Gnana, the former removes obstructions to real knowledge and the latter aids in correct perception. When the Mind is sublued, the samsara or worldly desires and miseries come to an end, as the wordly transactions of man for the day cease with the setting of the Sun."

 The word Yoga means "to join", and it is often used as a general term to include Karma-Yoga and Gnana-Yoga, the object of both the processes being to join the Individual soul to the Universal soul. They are not intrinsically different as the work of both consists in mental exercises and meditation. In the Karma-Yoga, there is a preponderance of mental karmas or exercise and in the Gnana-yoga the meditation predominates over karma. In the former, as explained in the above quotation, the main work is negative as alluding to the destruction of the obstructive tendencies of the mind, and in the latter, it is more positive as the work to be done is intellectual and analytic, for the purpose of securing true knowledge of the Atinan. Thus it is that the Bhagavat-Gita described both the processes as virtually of the same species. vide verse 5 Adhyaya V.

**यत्सांख्यैः प्राप्यते स्थानं तद्योगैरपि गम्यते।  
एकं सांख्यं च योगं च यः पश्यति स पश्यति॥**

 "The final goal is the same for both Yoga and Sankhya. He who understands this understands correctly."

 Karma-yoga which is a mental process is more negative and destructive in character, and Gnana-yoga which is an intellectual process, is more positive and constructive in nature. These two yogas are Puranically described as the Dekshinayana and the Uttarayana margas or the southern and the northern patlıs. Dekshina refers to the right hand which is capable of doing more dexterous work; Uttara refers to the lefs and also means uttara or to 'cross beyondthe region of materiality'. The two Yogas are further described as the Pitri-yana and the Dovayana, the former alluding to the region of Soma and the latter to the region of Soorya. A full Chapter extending to 140 pages in this

Volume is devoted to the explanntion of this subject. The following quotation alone from page 28, may suffice to enable us to start with a clear idea of the subject matter.

 य एवं विद्वानुदगयने प्रमीयतेदेवानामेव महिमानं गत्वादित्यस्य सायुज्यं गछत्यथ यो दक्षिणे प्रमीयते पितॄणामेव महिमानं गत्वा चन्द्रमसः सायुज्यं सलोकतामाप्नोत्येतौ वै सूर्याचन्द्रमसोर्महिमानौ ब्राह्मणो विद्वानभिजयति तस्मात् ब्रह्मणो महिमानमाप्नोति तस्मात् ब्रह्मणो महिमानम्॥ नारायणोपनिषत्॥

 Thus, the wise Bramhin who takes to the northern path attains the glories of the Devas and merges in the Sun. If he takes to the southern path, he attains the glories of the Pitris and securing the regions of Soma merges in Soma. By thus seeking the glories of Somaand Soorya, the wise Bramhin secures the glories of Bramhan."

 The Mahimas or glories pertaining to Soorya and Soma are here plainly explained as alluding to two paths to be followed by man for the purpose of securing the glorious region of Bramhan. The Mahimas or glories are generally known as Prebhavom representing the forms of the forinless, the same as the Bramha-kshetrom and the Sakala-nishkalom already noticed, vide page 57.

**सृष्ट्यर्थेसर्वतत्वानां लोकस्योत्पत्तिकारणम्।  
योगिनामुपकाराय स्वेच्छयाचिन्त्यते शिवः।  
निष्कलं तत्वमित्युक्तंसकलं मूर्तिरीरिता।  
सकलं निष्कलं चैव प्रभावमिति कीर्तितम्॥**

**वातूलशुद्धागमम्॥**

 "Siva settles of his own accord, for the use of the yogis, the creation of all the Tatwas and the origin of the Lokas. Nishkala represents the Tatwa; Sakalarepresents the Morti or form; and Sakta-nishkala represents the Prebhava or glory associated with the form."

 The following extract of the quotation from page 33 will give a clear idea of the Soorya and Soma Vamsas, as representing the two glorious paths above referred to.

**सप्तर्षयस्तु तैस्सार्धंमध्ये त्रेतायुगे पुनः।  
बीजार्थं वै भविष्यन्ति ब्रह्मक्षत्रस्तु वैनृपः।

द्विवंशकरणं सर्वे कीर्तयिष्ये निबोधत।  
ऐलञ्चेक्ष्वाकुवंशश्च प्रकृतीं परिचक्षते॥**

**मत्स्यपुराणम्।**

 "In every Treta-yuga, the Sapta-Rishis originate with the king known as Bramha-Kshetra for the purpose of Bija (letters of mantras) and for continuation of Yugas to the end of the Manwantaras. This is the regular course of yoga by which the Ilas and the Ikshwakus originate in Treta and decay in Kali. After Parasu-Rama annihilated all the kshetriyas on the earth, the two yansas named the Ilas and Ikshwakus originated. They are declared to represent the Prakriti."

 The description given is sufficiently plain, although it is furnished in a strictly Puranic style. We cannot afford to discuss at length in this short preface all the points touching upon this question. The preface is only intended to provide the readers with a general idea of the Puranic method adopted in our religious literature, in the treatment of the two important subjects named Karma-yoga and Gnan yoga, in the garb of Histories of the rulers of the two illustrious

dynasties known as Soma and Soorya. The passage quoted above, if properly understood would however furnish full information on the subject. The Sapta-Rishis or seven Rishis are said to originate in the Treta-yuga along with a king known as Bramha-kshetrom. The seven Rishis of course represent in Puranic language the seven Prakritis of our religious philosophy. Vide page 482 Volume I.

**मरीचिरत्र्त्यङ्गिरसौ पुलस्त्यःपुलहः क्रतुः।  
वसिष्ठश्च महातेजास्ते हि चित्रशिखण्डिनः।  
सप्तप्रकृतयोह्येतास्तथा स्वायम्भुवोष्टमः।  
एताभिर्धार्यते लोकस्ताभ्यः शास्त्रं विनिस्सृतम्॥**

**महाभारतं - शान्तिपर्व॥**

 "The Sapta-Rishis are known as Chitrasikhandins, consisting of Marichi, Athri, Angira, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kretu and Vasishta. They represent the seven Prakritis, and adding Swayambhuva make up eight. They are the supporters of the Lokas and the originators of Sastras."

 The two Vausas or dynasties of Ila and Ikshwaku have also been clearly explained as representing the Prakritis.

**ऐलञ्चेक्ष्वाकुवंशश्च प्रकृतीं परिचक्षते॥**

 Nothing can be simpler and plainer. The Soma-vamsa starting with Ila alludes to karma-yoga and the Soorya-Vamsa starting with Ikshwaku alludes to Gnana-yoga. These two vamsas consisting of Bramha-kshetrom are said to originate after the destruction of all the Kshetriyas on the earth by Parasu-Rama.

**जामदग्न्येन रामेण क्षत्रे निरवशेषिते।  
रिक्तेयं वसुधा सर्वा क्षत्रियैर्वसुधाधिपैः  
द्विवंशकरणं सर्वं कीर्तयिष्ये निबोधत॥**

 The Kshetras, destroyed by Parasu-Rama aro described as Parithivom-kshetrom alluding to material forms as opposed to Bramha-kshetrom, vide page 167.

**असकृत्पार्थिवं क्षत्रं जघानामर्षचोदितः॥**

 The two dyanastios specially reservel for the yogis thus origina to after all conceptions of and desires for the material forms or Parthiyom kshetron are annihilated. Again, these two dynasties are said to originate in Treta and end in Kali; that is they continue during the Treta and the Dwapara yugas.

**एतेन क्रमयोगेन ऐला इक्ष्वाकवोनृपाः।  
उत्पद्यमानास्त्रेतायां क्षीयमाणाः कलौ युगे॥**

 The Soma-vamsa and Karma-yoga are thus associated with the Dwapara Yuga; and the Soorya-Vamsa and Gnana-Yoga are associated with a higher yuga called the Treta The Kali yuga alludes to the absence of yoga and the Krita represents a stage of perfection where Yoga has been completed. vide pages 309, 310 & 311. Volutine I.

योगक्षेमस्य नाशश्च वर्तते वर्णसङ्करः॥ **

**महाभारतम्। शान्तिपर्व॥**

 "Krita is the greatest of the Yugas, where eternal Dharma is complete having no more to be done. In the Krita, there are no Devas, Danavas, yekshas, Rakshasas aNd Pannagas, there is no buying, no selling; no difference of Vedas and no human action."

 “In the Krita yuga, Dharma is unabated and yoga is perfectly safe. In the Kali, there is no Dharma, and there is no safety for Yoga; the varnas also get intermixed."

 We are now in a sound position to understand clearly the general relation and relevancy of Time and Personality so far explained in our religious literature, in spite of thundering and confounding criticisms against them alleged to be established on historical grounds. We have conveniently seen that Time and Personalities in our Puranic history are always unmistakable and permanent; we need not therefore foster any fear of their fluctuations or chances to become anachronisims or even exaggerations under the existing circumstances. The present difficulty after all, lies only to some extent in securing the required combination of sympathy with capacity, for when the one is available the other is too often unfortunately absent.

**मनीषिणःसन्ति न ते हितैषिणो

यथौषधं स्वादु हितं च दुर्लभम्॥**

 **6.**Having thus far enquired into the general character of the contents of our sacred literature as a whole, it remains to notice the specific nature of the subject matter

dealt with in this second Volume which contains Chapters IV & V of the essay. Chapter IV is intended for explaining in detail, the real significance of the two vamsas or dynasties Puranically known as the Soma and the Soorya Vamsas which technically represent the two scientific processes named Karma-yoga and Gnana-yoga. Chapter V then takes up the treatment of one of these Vamsas namely the Soma-vamsa, in the order of their importance from below upwards. The main portion of the religious instructions conveyed by a discription of this Vamsa being elaborately explained in the Maha-Bharata, that Chapter is set apart for a detailed examination of the great Epic. The third Volume of this Essay will similarly deal with the Ramayana, which virtually contains an exhaustive treatment of the religious instructions connected with Gnana-yoga, which the ancient authors wished to convey in the name of Soorya-vamsa. Confining ourselves now to the contents of the present Volume, it has to be noted here that Chapter IV on the Soorya and Soma Vamsas, touches also upon the so-called history of Sri-Krishna as the Lord who chiefly figures in the Maha-bharata examined in Chapter V. Both the chapters in this volume combined, will thus furnish almost a complete account of the scientific process known as Yoga and Karma-yoga in our religious literature, as differing from the process known as Sankhya and Gnana-yoga.

 For the readers to be better prepared this proposition in itself might demand fuller explanation touching thecontents of this Volume. The three Puranic items, Time, Place and Personality, directly relating to the subject under reference, namely Karma-yoga, may be briefly noticed here.

 1. Under the head of Personality, the significance of Sri-Krishna and Arjuna alone might suffice to be understood for the purpose of starting with the subject. vide pages 68 & 69.

**बृहद्धर्मपुराणम्॥**

 "Vanmiki addresssing Vyasa said. For the purpose of imparting the true meaning of the Vedas to low Bramhins, Sudras and females, the Vedas took the form of Mahabharata which was originally (done) composed by Narayana, Himself. For the publication of the same, you are created by Narayana. You should (do) compose the Mahabharata bigger than the Ramayana, but only in the same style. In the Ramayana, the workings of Sita-Rama or the singleParamatma are described as if be had aphysical body.

The beautiful Krishna is doubtless the same divinity, only he is accompained by Jiva for the purpose of removing the burden of the earth. Narayana represents Vasudeva and Paramatma. Nara represents Arjuna and Jivatma. Maha-Bharata this treats of Nara and Narayana combined. Ramayana treats of the singlo Narayana. This is exactly the difference between Bharata and Ramayana."

 The above description, plain as it is, is of course furnished in the usual Puranic style. The word used here for denoting the composition of the Ramayana as well asBharata is the verb do; and it will be invariably found used on all such occasions, showing that the contents refer to instructions for doing or practice. It doubtless gives us a clear idea of the difference between the two texts. Mahabharata includes the work of Jivatma for its own purification by the process of Karma-Yoga. Ramayana requires the work of discovering the Paramatma by the process known as Gnana-yoga. We can now easily understand that Krishna and Rama are technical names for the divine bases for Karma-yoga and Gnana-yoga respectively. They also denote the highest stages of development attainable by the two processes. To understand more clearly the technical significance of the term Krishna we may notice below the component parts of the roots from which it is derived. vide page 104.

**ब्रह्मणो वाचकः कोऽयं ऋकारोनन्तवाचकः।  
शिवस्य वाचकः षश्च नकारौधर्मवाचकः।  
अकारो विष्णुवचनः श्वेतद्वीपनिवासिनः।  
नरनारायणार्थस्य विसर्गो वाचकः स्मृतः।**

**सर्वेषां तेजसां राशिःसर्वमूर्तिस्वरूपकः।  
सर्वाधारःसर्वबीजस्तेन कृष्ण इति स्मृतः॥**

**ब्रह्मवैवर्तपुराणम्॥**

 "Ka refers to Bramha; Ri to infinity; Sha to Siva; Na to Dharma; A to Vishnu and the visargaor two dots to the combination of Nara and Narayana. He combines in him the forms of all and the brightness of all. He is the support and cause of everything."

 It would be particularly interesting to notice here that the Puranic idea of Arjuna is included in the derivation of the term Krishna, as an inseperable ingredient. Besides, the derivation in itself precludes all possibilities of representing the Lord of Karma-yoga as a human being. This factis clearly mentioned also in the holy texts to avoid misinterpretation. vide page 100,

**न तस्य प्राकृती मूर्तिः मेदोमांसास्थिसम्भवा।  
गोविन्द एव पुरुषो ब्रह्माद्यास्त्रिय एव च।  
तत एवं स्वभावोयं प्रकृतेर्भाव इश्वरः।  
पुरुषप्रकृती चाद्यौ राधावृन्दावनेश्वरौ॥**

**पद्मपुराणम्॥**

 "He has no physical form consisting of flesh, bone or marrow. He the Eswara is the only Purusha or male, all else from Bramha downwards being feminine. Radha and Krishna represent Prakriti and Purusha the original causes of everything."

 It is earnestly hoped that the readers would be satisfied with this much of explanation on the point in question, as more of it in a short preface would surely be out of place. We may however briefly notice in this connection the Puranic significance of a few important technical terms apparently appearing like geographical sites relating to the work of Krishna and to the scenes of the Mahabharata.

 a. Mathura, the nativity of Krisha is defined thus. vide pages 246 and 247 Volume I.

**मध्यते तु जगत्सर्वे ब्रह्मज्ञानेन येन वा।  
मत्सारभूतं यद्यत्स्यान्मथुरा सा निगद्यते॥**

**गोपालपूर्वतापिन्युपनिषत्॥**

**स्वस्थानमधिकं नाम ध्येयं माथुरमण्डलम्।  
सहस्रपत्रकमलाकारं माथुरमण्डलम्।  
विष्णुचक्रपरीमाणं धाम वैष्णवमुत्तमम्॥**

**पद्मपुराणम्॥**

 “ If you churn (or destroy) the existing cosinology of man, by the knowledge of Bramhan, that which remains pertaining to me is called Mathura.”

 " Mathura, the sacred region of Vishnu is fit for meditation as a lotus of thousand petals and as large as the disc of Vishnu in its extent."

 The descriptions of Mathura furnished in these sacred texts are entirely omitted in Duncan's geography of India, and yet this Mathura is identified with Muttra in Upper India. The geographist however is not responsible for this identification as he never composed his geography by referring to these texts. The religious texts here quoted, also fail to assure us that Mathura above described is the same as Muttra mentioned in Duncan's geography. Besides, the descriptionof Krishna already noticed in the religious texts, as having no physical body, unfortunately adds to the difficulty of believing that Muttra in Upper Indis is the nativity of the Lord. The following is the description of the forest of Brindavana which is the favourite resort of the Lord. vide page 247 Volume I.

**सात्वतां स्थानमूर्धन्यं विष्णोरत्यन्तदुर्लभम्।  
नित्यं वृन्दावनं नाम ब्रह्माण्डोपरि संस्थितम्।**

**पञ्चयोजनमेवं हि वनं मे देवरूपकम्।  
कालिन्दीयं सुषुम्नाया परमामृतवाहिनी।  
यत्र देवाश्च भूतानि वर्तन्ते सूक्ष्मरूपतः।  
आविर्भावस्तिरोभावो भवेदत्र युगे युगे।  
तेजोमयमिदं स्थानम्अदृश्यं चर्मचक्षुषाम्॥**

**पद्मपुराणम्॥**

 "The divine and eternal forest known by the name of Brinda-vana is the highest region of Vishnu. It is five yojanas in extent and situated above the Bramhanda, on the Sushumna Nadi called Kalindi. The gods and the elements reside there in their subtle form. My incarnations and subsequent disappearance in the various yugas take place there. It is the bright region of light invisible to mortal eyes."

 Brindavana, the favourite forest of Krishna, where he occasionally incarnates, is said to be situated above the Bramhand which contains the fourteen Lokas. It is also described as invisible to mortal eyes. Probably for these very reasons, it is now assured as representing an earthy spot in Upper India. The famous Dwaraka belonging to Krishna is explained as follows. vide page 249 Voluune I.

**चतुर्णामपि वर्गाणां यत्र द्वाराणि सर्वतः।  
अतो द्वारवतीत्युक्ता विद्वद्भिस्तत्ववेदिभिः।  
द्वारकावासिनः सर्वे नरा नार्यश्चतुर्भुजाः॥**

**स्कान्दपुराणम्॥**

 "The wise name it Dwaraka because it contains plenty of openings or door-ways for the admission of Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha. The residents of Dwaraka, both males and females, possess four hands."

 Perhaps in the days of Krishna, in some early century, B. C., Dwaraka was the seat of a great University which

dubbed all people as Graduates and gave them gowns provided with the additional two hands.

 Let usnow move on to the famous battle field of Kurukshetra, the scene of the Maha-Bharata war. vide pages 235 & 236 Volume I.

 "Kurukshetrom is Avimuktom. It is the abode of Bramha and a place for worship even by the gods."

 "My abode known as Avimukta is not on this earth but is in the sky. The liberated alone could perceive it by their mind; others could not soe. It is the cremation ground. The town Varanasi lies between Varana and Asi. The eternal Tatwom known as Avimuktom is situated there."

 "The Jabala Upanishat says that Asi refers to the Ida Nadi and Varana to the Pingala Nadi. Between these two lies Avimukta which reprents the great Sushumna Nadi. These three combined make ap Varanasi."

 We have here a clear Puranic description of the to pography of Kurukshetra. It is the same as Avimuktom. Asi represents the Ida Nadi and Varana the Pingala Nadi. Between these two Nadis is Avimuktom situated in the sky representing the Sushumna Nadi. Three Nadis combined go by the name of Varanasi. It may be safely observed that the various passages quoted from the different texts here dealing with one and the same point, never disclose any inconsistencies, but on the contrary they only. explain each other more clearly. At the same time, none of the available passages in the texts seems to establish the prevailing views on the sacred subject. It may however be assured in this connection that all, the passages quoted in this Essay as authority are taken only from recent publications of books printed and made accessible to all.

 The inconsistencies, irrelevancies and incoherencies of which we hear so much in these days as applied to the contents of our sacred texts, apply therefore only to the varieties of modern interpretations and criticisms which are obtained gratis in abundance.

 Before closing this preface, a word of apology is due in behalf of the publication of this second Volume in two parts. It was no boubt originally intended to be published after completely printing the same; but now for the sake of convenience it is divided into two parts under the valuable advice of several of my esteemed well-wishers and sympathisers who are probably growing somewhat impatient

over the delay in printing. This book containing Part I includes Chapter 1V on "the Soorya andVamsas, and the first five and the first five Parvas of the Maha-Bharata treated in Chapter V. Part II will thus contain the remaining thirteen Parvas of the Maha-bharata with which Chapter Vand Volume II close. Part II starting with Bhishma-Parva will contain in its beginning a thorough examination of the eighteen Adhyayas of the celebrated Bhagavat-Gita, especially made with a view to ascertain the real Puranic significance of the Gita as a religious text appearing in the midst of the great Epic. Having already noticed the Puranic significance of Kurukshetra, Krishna and Arjuna, it would be necessary here to assure the readers that the eighteen Parvas of the Maha-Bharata as well as the eighteen Adhyayas of the Bhagavat-Gita, are carefully enquired into in the second Volume of this essay, with the express object of securing the conviction that the whole text virtually deals with the religious philosophy of Karma-yoga, and that it has not the slightest connection with the ancient history of the Indian Peninsula of any known or unknown periods, relating to deceased monarchs or extinct nationalities. I earnestly wish to be clearly understood here, that, no politic reconciliations or half-hearted admirations of the religious texts as being partly historical and pratly mythical, no intolerant criticisms of their being entirely incoherent and unscientific compositions, no silly interpretations of their being literally true as containing extraordinary incidents of the days of yore, are in the least admitted or even connived at, in any portion of this essay. It is anxiously and sincerely contended that the subject in its entirity as well as in its parts is highly philosophical and scientific in character, in spite

of its modern caricature into historical and geographical shapes. The holy and philosophical region of Kurukshetra defined and explained alike in every religious text, could under no circumstances be permitted to be annihilated or even polluted. It is a sacred gift by God to humanity at large, which no unprivileged or unqualified soul has the right to defile. Every man and woman is allowed the chance of resorting to this sacred spot to fight out his or her battle of the Maha-Bharata, provided he or she secures the preparatory qualifications. The battle to be fought is internal and terrible, and no external pretentions would be of any avail in gaining the required victory which once obtained undoubtedly leads to glorious results. One need not altogether despair of success in such a furious battle. Much depends upon the preparation, which virtually consits in raising ourselves to the satwic qualifications of Arjuna, or in plainer language, in converting ourselves into a Nara or true man. As soon as this noble work is accomplished, Lord Krishna will appear for help. He has no physical form and he will not take up arms and join us in the fight. He will only teach us the sacred Bhagavat-Gita which containscomplete instructions for successfully conducting the great war of the Maha-Bharata. We must however be prepared to attend the battlefied and to station ourselves in the midst of the contending armies before we can hope to obtain even a single lesson from the sacred Bhagavat-Gita. How few in this material world are at present qualified and prepared for this gigantic venture is a simple question of fact. And yet many there are, ready to talk lightly of the Gita, as if they have completely mastered the whole of it.

 The arduous work of Karma-yoga begins only after a good deal of self-denials and renunciations combined with

asincere disgust for all the worldly pomp and pleasure. Its very plane is far far away from that of buman desires, human wars and human politics. What a futile and disgraceful attempt is displayed in modern times by the literati of the day, in making comparisons with and drawing inferences from the sacred Gita, connecting its contents with Political, Social, Historical and Topographical affairs of the insignificant man ? The Gita has to be preached at Hastina-purom, the sacred city which rises only after the destruction of the Hasti or huge elephant of human desire beautifully explained in the following passage. vide page 86.

**रामेछा नाम करिणी सेदंमेऽस्त्विति रूपिणी।  
शरीरकानने मत्ता विविधोल्लासकारिणी।  
मत्तेन्द्रियोग्रकलभारसनाकलभाषिणी।  
मनोगहनसंलीना कर्मदन्तद्वयान्विता।  
मदोऽस्या वासनाव्यूहः सर्वतः प्रसरद्वपुः।  
इछानागी निहन्त्येषाकृपणान् जीवसंचयान्।  
संसारदृष्टयो राम तस्याः समरभूमयः।  
भूयो यत्रानुभवति नरो जयपराजयौ।  
इछाविछुरितो जीवो विजहाति न दीनताम्॥**

**ज्ञानवासिष्ठम्॥**

 “O. Rama ! human desire is in the form of a terrible elephant. It madly roams about in the forest of human body making loud noise and doing immense mischief. It often conceals itself in the den of human mind with its double tusks of Karma. Its madness caused by Vasanas extends all over the body. It wages war in the battle field of worldly affairs and destroys many an unthinking soul. It subjects every worldly wise man to its own sway and ever keeps him in distress."

 Thus, the man of the world, virtually keeps his permanent abode at present in Hasti-puroṁ, where there are no holy battles of the Maha-bharata to be fought nor sacred preachings of the Gita to be heard. He should therefore prepare himself first for his pilgrimage to the holy city of Hastina-purom in the divine region, if he wish to benefiit himself by the Gita and the Maha bharata. Careful study of religious philosophy, strict adherence to ethical conduct and staunch devotion to Sri-Krishna the Lord of Yoga, are the unavoidable requisites for the real object to besecured, and it is but vain talk and waste of time to be harping over irrelevant material affairs for this purpose.

**CHAPTER IV.**

**The Soorya and Soma Vamsas.**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

 The subject of this essay has been already statod at the title page to be "The Permanent History of Bharata-varsha". In accordance with the previous classifications in the preceding chapters, of technical terms found used throughout our religious literature, the significance of the geographical description of Bharata-varsha may be first explained. Besides, in a historical treatise or even in a story book, it is the common practice and the natural order of treatment tocommence with the descriptions of the country, town or other locality where the scene of action is said to have taken place.

 As the general description goes in the texts, Bharata-varsha.is said to lie to the south of Meru and to be situated at the southern extremity of Jambu-dwipa.

**जम्बूद्वीपे भारतवर्षे भरतः खण्डे मेरोःदक्षिणे पार्श्वे॥**

 We have here four distinct terms to be explained, each separately and all the four together, in order to obtain any satisfactory or convincing interpretation, whatever might be the style of explanation adopted. The current interpretation, identifying Bharata-varsha with India, does not and could not satisfactorily explain any one of these terms, nor could it furnish any relevant or consistent idea by the combination of all. If Bharata-varsha is taken to inean India, Bharata-khanda, naturally a sub-division of India, becomes meaningless and inapplicable, as the two terms together areused all over India. The Meru with its altitude of 100

thousand Yojanas or 800 thousand miles is said to be situated in the centre of Jambu-dwipa. If Jambu-dwipa is taken to mean the earthy globo with its 8,000 miles diameter, the Meru whose altitude is 100 times greater than the diameter of the earth, must be easily visible. Again, Bharata-varsha situated in the southernmost extremity of Jambu-dwipa, must be found located somewhere near the South Pole. With so much of inconsistencies and inapplicabilities in the mere combination of four technical terms, there is still the tendency to persist in the interpretation given, in spite of its serving no useful purpose of any kind even if it is accepted. The dimensions given in the texts are passed over easily as exaggerations and the definitions spécifying the intended significance are overlooked and utterly uncared for, as poetical flourishes and Puranic fancies, as if the interpreters alone are free from such serious faults. It is in no way a profitable work here to go further into the details of mistaken views on the subject formed from imaginations rather than by reading the texts properly. We may however proceed with our enquiry into the texts themselves, without wasting time any longer, and the following extracts from the previous quotations may be reiterated for the purpose of convenient reference and for clearing unnecessary doubts for the future, regarding the correct significance of the terms Meru, Jambu and Bharata-varsha as used in our religious literature.

 **2.** The explanations given in the extracts may be noticed here without a literal translation for the same as it has been already furnished for the full quotations.

 Two distinct references are explained regarding the term Meru, one is philosophical and the other is Yogic. Vyoma, Dharma, Veda-maya, Deva-maya and Deva-loka are mentioned as its exact synonyms. Meru is clearly described as situated in the centre of the lotus of Deva-bhunmi. It could thus be easily understood, as representing the Vedic centre from which all varieties of religious devotion radiato and towards which every form of it converges. This is no doubt the philosophical idea of it. The spinal column with the Sushumna Nadi inside is named by Yogis as Meru, on account of their, using certain plexus or nervous centres in it for religious meditation, The Ida and Pingala Nadis are

said to lie on either side of this Meru. No further passages could however be found in the texts to corroborate the current view of Meru as a hill or mountain situated on this earthy globe in Tibot or Central Asia beyond the Himalayas. Inspite of his persistence in the geographical application, no local Pandit has yet been able to point out the Meru anywhere, and no Theosophist either has been able to discover the same with his notions of black or white magic. In fact the technical word Meru as usel by our venerable sages in the religious texts emphatically represents the negation of all the Pandit's ideas of materiality and his greed for material prosperity, as well as the rejection of all the Theosophist's unphilosophical desires for magical exhibitions. It clearly refers to the Avyakrits, the terminus of all the finite exhibitions of matter. It is here that the four Vedas originate from the four faces of the Great Bramha. Be he the Pandit or be be the Theosophist, the more Meru is materialised, the more it will recede from his sight and vanish for good. The earth and hills referred to are all distinctly mentioned as divine and not earthy, "Deva-Bhumis" and "Divya-parvathas".

 The term Dekshina or South of 'Meru might require an explanation. Dekshina, literally means the right hand side, as the cardinal points are supposed to have been originally determined by standing against the rising sun. The right hand side representing the south refers to the hand itself which is the best instrument in the human body for proper action. All the finite conceptions from the infinite coutre Meru outwards are active or evolutional and not involutional or passive. All the devotional practices from the outermost point, up to the centre Meru, therefore falls within the category of processes dealing with finite ideas, whether they are classed under Sankhya or Yoga. Dekshina refers to the

Karma-kanda in general, alluding to the right ear which is considered stronger than the left and which represents hearing or studying the Vedas whose first part being the Karma-kanda.

**पितृहू दक्षिणःकर्णःः उत्तरो देवहूःस्मृतः॥**

The word Dekshina also moans Intellect. शेमुषी दक्षिणा प्रोक्ता । The intellectual energy exerted and the consequent powers acquired in this direction until the centre is reached, are denoted by this word.

 Jambu-dwipa, ordinarily interpreted as representing the earth, clearly denotes the sphere of devotion.

**जम्बूद्वीपस्य संस्थानं यज्ञिया यत्र वै क्रियाः**

Is is said to be situated in the midst of divine mountains in the divine earth, the lotus of Deva-prithivi. Jambu-dwipa is also called Sudarsana-dwipa, and it is explained as the reflection of the original Bramhan, alluding thereby to the various stages of attainment in the devotional practices pertaining to the Sabda-bramhań or Purana-purusha. All the seven Dwipas beginning with Jambu in the centre are distinetly inentioned as Divine and not earthy 'ते सर्वे देवभूमयः॥ Jambu as we have already seen consists of nine Varshas or continents of which eight are described as the Divino localities provided for the enjoyment of eight Sidhis acquired, and the nineth named Bharata-varsha is mentioned as Karma-Bhumi or Karma-kshetra, the sphere for devotional practice.

 **तत्रापि भारतमेव वर्षे कर्मक्षेत्रमन्यान्यष्ट वर्षाणि स्वर्गिणां पुण्यशेषोपभोगस्थानानि भौमानि स्वर्गपदानि व्यपादेशन्ति॥**

This Karma-bhumi is plainly mentioned as the 'Madhyama' or middle stage and also as 'Sruti-rupa' or in the form of the

Vedas. The Nirukta or root-meaning of the word 'Bharata' gives the idea of supporting or saving oneself, and 'Bharati-praja' refers undoubtedly to the intellectual development aimed at. The situation of Bharata-varsha is ingeniously marked as lying between the Saline ocean and the Himadri, to the north of the former and south of the latter. The word Uttara used to denote north signifies also to cross beyond. 'उत् तरतीति उत्तरः'॥ A beautiful and detailed description of the Saline ocean alluding to the Samsara-sagara or ocean of worldly misfortunes and sorrows is given in quotation 3, Para 6 Section I Chapter III which is well worth noting. Bharata-varsha thus clearly represents the specific processes of devotional work provided in our religion, by which man could save himself from being drowned in the saline ocean filled with the waters of lament and sorrow. The moment one enters the Bharata-varsha by his sincere and religious devotion, he virtually gets over the ocean of grief; such is the nature of the holy Karma-bhumi provided for man by the venerable sages. Its northern boundary, the Himadri is the cold region, where the mind may rest cool and enjoy the bliss of freedom from the burning worry and pain of Samsara. Taking a philosophical view of this excellent and vivid description, it can be easily inferred that the functions of the mind are not entirely extinct even in the Himadri, which serves to represent only the utmost boundary of Agnana bordering on Gnana, as the sphere beyond it is described as Para-loka or seat of Gnana.

**उत्तरेहिमवत्पार्श्वे पुण्ये सर्वगुणान्विते।  
पुण्यःक्षेम्यश्च काम्यश्च स परो लोक उच्यते॥**

Here also the word Uttara must be understood as meaning passing beyond.

 The significance of Bharata-khanda, commonly understood as a sub-division of Bharata-varsha yet remains to be examined. Karma-bhumi and Karma-kshetra have been already noticed as synonyms of Bharata-varsha. Bhumi or Kshetra as referred to in the texts is clearly explained in the following extracts.

**इदं शरीरं कौन्तेय क्षेत्रमित्यभिधीयते।  
एतद्यो वेत्तितम्प्राहुक्षेत्रज्ञ इति तद्विदः।  
क्षेत्रज्ञश्चापि मां विद्धि सर्वक्षेत्रेषु भारत।  
क्षेत्रक्षेत्रज्ञयोर्ज्ञानं यत्तत्ज्ञानं मतं मम॥**

**इन्द्रियाणि नरैः पञ्च षष्ठं तन्मन उच्यते।  
सप्तमी बुद्धिमेवाहु क्षेत्रज्ञं विद्धि चाष्टमम्।  
चक्षुरालोकनायैव संशयं कुरुते मनः।  
बुद्धिरध्यवसानाय साक्षी क्षेत्रज्ञ उच्यते॥**

 From the description here given we clearly see that the interpretation of Bharata-kanda as a sub-division of Bharata-varsha is correct, although in accordance with the current method of geographical identification, the interpretation is totally inapplicable and completely absurd. Bharata-varsha or Karina-kshetra is a collective expression for all the Kshetras or human bodies specially entitled to and qualified for Karma or devotional practices prescribed by our religion; and Bharata-khanda applies to a single individual thus qualified. Here the human body or Kshetra does not merely mean the physical one, but consists of the five senses, mind and Intellect; and the Kshetragna is represented as standing aloof as a witness of the Kshetra.

 It will be evident from these explanat ons that every body is not really privileged to use the expressions Bharata-Varsha, Bharata-Khanda &c, in repeating the Samkalpa-Mantras at the commencement of every religious ceremony.

Every religious Hiudu is at present presumed, simply as a matter of grace, to have enteral the Bharata-varsha or Karma-kshetra and entitled to use such Mantras. At any rate it is certain that those who exert not, to enter this region of Karma-bhumi, are destinedonly to keep ever sinking and rising in the saline ocean of Samsaradrifted along in different directions as human weaknesses chance to take them, without a hope of getting ashore.

**क्वचिद्विद्वद्गोष्ठी क्वचिदपि सुरामत्तकलहः  
क्वचिद्वीणावादः क्वचिदपि च हाहेति रुदितम्।  
क्वचिद्रम्या रामा क्वचिदपि जराजर्जरतनु-  
र्न जाने संसारःकिममृतमयः किं विषमयः॥**

 **3.** Having thus once for all ascertained what Bharata-varsha, Karma-bhumi or Karma-kshetra represents for the purpose of correctly understanding the so-called geographical references in this essay, the apparent periods of historical incidents to be similarly explainedwithin the limited requirements of our undertaking may be enquired into.

**चत्वारि भारते वर्षे युगानि कवयोऽब्रुवन्।  
कृतं त्रेता द्वापरञ्च कलिश्चान्यत्र न क्वचित्॥**

The four Yugas enumerated by the wise namely, Krita, Treta, Dwapara and Kali are found only in Bharata-varsha and no where else'.

 The real significance of Yugas in general has been already explained in detail in the previous chapter. The above limitation of their application to the Bharata-varsha alone makes the whole matter clear to every man of common sense. Any form of interpretation contrary to the definitions clearly furnished here from the texts, could only

be rejected as irrelevant, whether proceeding from a respectable local Pandit or from a civilized foreign Critic. In spite of the quasi-religious and quasi-scientifi: character of the Theosophist's efforts, his view on the point exactly amounts to nothing more than that of the simple antiquated Pandit unacquainted with the progress or nature of Western Science. Before proceeding therefore with the enquiry of details connected with our main subject either referring to the Bharata-varsha or to the Yugas, we must most emphatically reiterate in the clearst terms possible, the irrelevancy and inapplicability of the current interpretations, most carelessly offered by the least enquiring critics for the elucidation of a subject of the highest importance to mankind. In this serions subject, it is indeed a sin to put forth voluntarily absurdinterpretations on any account, with the practical effect of completely frustrating the noblest aim and object of its venerable authors. It is equally wrong and culpable to tolerate the free circulation of such destructive and silly commentaries either as a matter of courtesy or indifference. In the light of the modern boasted civilization, it is surely a disgrace to be silent over such irresponsible vandalism. Comparatively trifling questions nowadays, like widowmarriage and interdining give rise to hot discussions, voluminous talks aud news-paper harangues. No man or woman had ever to lose life or go to hell on account of indifference to such social matters. The venerable Sanyasis and Revered monks and nuus will bear ample testimony to this fact. Besides, it is still a standing stigma in our midst, that general poverty aud constantly recurring fatalities by sheer famine in the land have not received any adequate attention and sympathy from the Reformers in other directions. With regard to our sacred religion however, any idea of reform, under the existing conditions, must start

with the special disadvantage consequent on the ignorance of the subject, often coupled with the want of religious faith and interest or inclination to enquire or study. Every thing in it is boldly and shamlessly presumed to be old fahioned, unscientfic unpratical and even injurious to society in general, and therefore demandling immediate reformfrom incompetent, unsympathetic and unprivileged hands. If in this manner, newness in itself is the modern criterion of the reformers, many a god-given blessing will one day be attempted to be reformad, like the sun, moon and the Elements which are the oldest objects known to man. It is too late now for such absurd notions to attract the notice of reasonable people. No false theories could long stand the test of Reason or time and no superficial knowledge command the respect due to deeper study and sterling truth. The time-honoured religion of ours is an exceedingly valuable legacy that we could not be so easily induced to part with, by the force of current criticisms. No known religion in the world is perhaps so ridiculously tolerent as ours at  
present, and it clearly discloses the extent to which we have lost faith in it by ignorance as well as indifference.

**अर्थाः पादरजःसमा गिरिनदीवेगोपमं यौवनं  
आयुष्यं जलबिन्दुलोलचपलं फेनोपमं जीवितम्।  
धर्मे यो न करोति निश्चलमतिःस्वर्गार्गलोत्घाटनं  
पश्चात्तापयुतो जरापरिगतः शोकाग्निना दह्यते॥**

 **4.** It is confidently hoped that the repeated explanations offered already with the necessary authoritative quotations, will permanently put a stop to future unreasonable questions or doubts regarding the exact and intended significance of Bharata-varsha and Yugas, and it may also be assured that in the interest of the main subject, we could not afford to waste any more time for such purposes. If

any one is really interested in the enquiry, it is not difficult to enlighten or satisfy himself by direct references to the texts themselves.

 The different periods specified for the historical occurrences in the two ancient epics called the Ramayana and the Maha-Bharata may now be examined, It has to be noticed here that there are several texts known by the name of Ramayana, such as Vanmiki Ramayana, Adhyatma Ramayana, Atbhuta-Ramayana, Ananda-Ramayana &c, but there is only one Maha-Bharata. Among the former there is no doubt that the Vanmiki-Ramayana is the recognised epic containing 24000 granthas or slokas. In this Ramayana however the yuga or the period in question is not clearly mentioned; we have therefore to pick up the same from other texts. The Maha-Bharata plainly states the period for the incidents narrated therein.

 The great war of the Maha-Bharata is said to have taken place at the juncture of the DwapAra-yuga with Kali. Rama's rule is stated to have been in Treta yuga for a period of 11,000 years. In the last quotation we get more detail information. The period extending to four yugas is reckoned as & cycle callerd Chatur-yuga. In the present Vyvaswata-manwantara, the current yuga is the Kali of the 28th cycle. In the Treta of the 19th cycle, Parasurama is said to have been born. Rama's incarnation is stated to have been in the 24th Treta and Krishna's in the 28th Dwapara. Thus we see there is an interval of four Chatur-yugas between Rama and Krishna, the Ramayana and the Maha-Bharata: The cycles undoubtedly refer to some important technical matters which we cannot afford to notice here. The difference of Yugas alone may be examined for the present purpose. We have already seen in the last chapter that the Kali-yuga represents the ordinary worldly existence of mankind without the devotional practices like Yogas for the attainment of higher states.

**सत्वं कृतं रजस्त्रेता द्वापरन्तु रजस्तमौ।  
कलौ तमस्तु विज्ञेयं युगवृत्तवशेन तु।**

**पादेनैकेन कौन्तेय धर्मः कलियुगे स्थितः  
तामसं युगमासाद्य कृष्णो भवति केशवः।  
वेदाचाराःप्रशाम्यन्ति धर्मयज्ञक्रियास्तथा।  
ईतयो व्याधयस्तन्द्री दोषाः क्रोधादयस्तथा।  
उपद्रवाः प्रवर्तन्ते आधयो व्याधयस्तथा।  
कलावधर्मो भूयिष्ठो धर्मो भवति न क्वचित्।  
योगक्षेमस्य नाशश्च वर्तते वर्णसङ्करः।**

Kali represents Tainas or ignorance and absence of Yoga and other devotional practices. Its juncture with the Dwapara therefore clearly refers to the attempt to start with some effective religious practices ordained, by stepping into Dwapara from Kali. It is at this critical stage, on account of the very entrance into the higher Yuga, the battle described in the Maha-Bharata takes place. The Treta ofcourse is a higher stage still, as represented in the Ramayana. These facts will therefore settle for us the order in which the two epics may be treated in this essay, the Maha-Bharata being the first and the Ramayana next. But before commencing with the first, it is desirable to obtain some general idea of the real contents of both, to keep us in touchwith the subject in the sub eq lent pages, noting also at the same time the correspondence of facts, if any, found in their comparison.

 **5.** The contents of both the epics are commonly understood and narrated in several languages already as human histories, leaving the inexplicable portions quietly as poetical exaggerations, except when they are made the objects of criticisims, in which case they are generally styled myths and taken for irrelevant combinations of incoherent ideas. It is not therefore necessary to reproduce them, as they could serve no useful purpose here.

 The following points of similarities in the general design of both the stories as well as the plenitude of incidents of superhuman character found throughout the epics may alone be specially noticed.

 (1) The foremost characters are Rama and Krishna, incarnations of the divine Vishnu, and not ordinary human beings. The main and important personages below their rank are transformations of the Devas. Their enemies or the opposite parties are similar transformations of Asuras and Rakshasas. It is thus easy to perceive that the human element so indispensable to constitute historical facts is almost at a discount.

 (2) The historical periods of time refer to the Treta and Dwapara Yugas, different from the present Kali Yuga or current kind of time, suitable for historical occurrences which could be conveniently comprehended by modern generation.

 (3) The incarnations of Rama and Krishna are in the two main vamsas or families known as the Soorya and Soma, the solar and lunar dynasties which originated from Vivaswatha-Manu the son of Soorya or Sun.

 (4) The object of both the incarnations is to remove the burden of the earth created by innumerable sins committed on her surface by wicked beings.

 (5) The lawful claims to the rulership of the kingdoms are first disputed and set at naught.

 (6) There is a banishment to the forests for a long period of 14 years.

 (7) In both the stories, there is a woman at the bottom of the quarrel.

 (8) There are enemies of bad characters to be destroyed during the banishment.

 (9) There is a great battle to be fought and won atlast with immense loss and hardship.

 (10) The kingdom is regained and ruled most prosparously and righteously after the victory.

 (11) Lastly, there is the ascension to Heaven calledthe Swargarohanom.

 From the several points of similarities just noticed in the general outline of the composition in both the epics, it can be easily and reasonably inferred that they treat of almost allied subjects differing only slightly in kind and degree.

 **6.** Before we enter into the direct examination of the texts themselves of cach epic separately, the most important points common to both as above set forth, but entirely absent in the ordinary human history, may be generally touched upon here, with a view to form some rough idea of the probable contents of the texts as valuable religious matter.

 Firstly, it may be safely presumed that no serious doubts are harboured in the mind of an ordinary religious Hindu or of a Pandit as to Rama and Krishna having been incarnations of Vishnu, as found repeatedly affirmed in the Itihasas in question as well as in several other Puranas aud religious texts. The exact significance of an incarnation or Avatar of Vishnu is as serious a matter to be enquired into and ascertained at this juncture as any others hithertoexamined.

 The following passages enunciate the formulas pertaining to incarnations in general, without particularising any special variety of them.

 **7.** It is hoped that the few passages quoted above will satisfactorily furnish a definite idea of the general formulas for incarnations or Avatars. An incarnation or Avatar literally means, manifestation in form. The forms manifested are those of the formless and are represented in various forms as required for the purposes in view. In quotation 5, five important and indispensable items of manifestations are detailed, to be created or imagined for worship in general. The first refers to the sex of the concretised form of the Diety to be determined either as a God or a Goddess. Secondly, the Angas or especially the hands whose number should be fixed as 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. 12, 14, 16 or 18. &c. All these numbers have something definite to represent which may be explained later on. The third requisite is to provide these hands with the necessary Astras or implements which similarly express some significant matters consistent with the formation of the Diety in question. The fourth refers to the Vahanams or vehicles suitable to the God or Godless intended. The fifth consists of the Sena or army to be provided for attending on the Diety. The hands, the implements and the army are particularly significant of the help implored and expected by the devotee from the manifeste 1 Diety, for the purpose of vanquishing his enemies who ever keep throatening. Without all the accessories above detailed, the worship of a Diety is said to be ineffective.

**नैवं विना देवः प्रसीदति।**

We thus clearly see that the manifestations of Avatars are the mental creations of man in accordance with the religious

ordinances ingeniously framed for securing the object aimed at. The word Kalpana meaning mental creation is invariably attached to all the five requisites described in the quotation to avoid all doubts in the matter. To misconstrue such plain and clear descriptions would be virtually denying that they are expressed in the sanskrit language itself. No granınatical twistings and logical quibbles could annihilate the texts or pro luce any useful results except the ignominy of a suicidal policy.

 Quotation 2 clearly explains that the ten Avatars are provided to serve as gradual steps for devotional advancement until the ultimate goal is reached.

**दर्शनं प्राप्तुमिछूनां सोपानानि च शोभने।**

  Quotation 1 clearly describes the 10 Avatars, such as Malsya, Kurma &c., as representing the glories of Bramhan for the express use of the devote.

**अर्चावतारा देवस्य वैभवाः परमात्मनः।**

 Quotation 3 assigns the reason for the necessity of a concretised manifestation and justifies the same in religions worship. It also reiterates that the form should be mentally created at the beginning of all processes of worship.

**यथाग्निमानयेत्युक्ते ज्वलत्काष्ठादृते स्वयम्।  
नाग्निरानीयते तद्वत्पूज्यो मूर्त्यात्मना शिवः।  
अत एव हि पूजादौ मूर्त्यात्म परिकल्पनम्।  
मूर्त्यात्मनि कृतं साक्षाछिव एव कृतं यतः॥**

 No fire by itself could be procured without a burning log of wood, but this does not affect the gravity of the element, in the same manner, the Murti or the form does not alter the essential nature of the Bramhan meditated upon.

 Quotation 4 from the Bhagavat Gita speaks of the occasions for Avatars, the object being to establish Dharma. Dharma has been explained more than once as consisting of

Gnana, Dhyana, Samaand Dama. The reference in the quotation is therefore clear enough. The form as well as the actions of the Diety to be meditated upon are not earthy but divine, and they do not therefore corroborate the current interpretations.

**जन्म कर्म च मे दिव्यम्।**

 The last quotation 6, details the gradual progress of meditation, starting with the firm belief in the Vedas represented by the first Avatar of Malsya and the march onwards. It may be noticed here that there are two different versions of the texts found with regard to the list of ten Avatars, the one eliminating Bela-Rama and substituting. Budha instead, being generally recognised in upper India somehow. Budha will probably be objected to as an Avatar in southern India. But this does not in the least affect the true significance of an incarnation described in the religious texts. Every kind of form mentally created for the purpose of worship as ordained by the texts will be tantamount to an incarnation in the strictest sense of the term. All persons in this world are of course in possession of a store of pleas connected with their daily transactions and several of them of absorbing interest to them. But it must be carefully noted that none of those are fit objects for meditations for religious advancement, as they naturally fall under the category of material affairs which particularly deserve tobe shunned at least for the time being, as any attachment to them will certainly obstruct the progress in the required direction. These are styled Vishayas, the necessity for whose elimination is repeatedly preached in all the texts.

**भगवद्गीता॥**

 The above passages particularly draw our attention to the mistake and danger consequent on the attachment to Vishayas or worldly matters. The mere thought of them leads to the gradual and final ruin of man.

 Quotation (3) clearly explains the order of retrogression caused by Vishayas. Their thought produces attachment which again creates desire or Karma. Karma leads to anger, anger to Moha or ignorance, then to loss of memory andintellectual deterioration and finally to ruin.

 Quotation (1) describes the Vishayas as consisting of the 24 Tatwas or categories of the phenomenal existence. They are called also Pasas or bondage which could be removed only by Bhajana or worship. Bhajana is classified into worship by thought, by word and by deed. Meditation on the ultimate cause of every known effect is worship by thought, Japas and Manthras refer to that by word and other physi- cal practices to that by deed.

 Quotation (2) divides duality into two sorts, the Sastric or religiously permitted and its reverse. The Sastric represents all processes connected with the acquirement of philosophical knowledge. The other unsastric is the objectionable one referring to avarice, anger &c., which should be especially eliminated before commencing with anything worth the name of religious worship. It thus becomes evident that the texts do not allow or recognise actions, thoughts or words relating to worldly and material affairs as relevant in the consideration of any kind of religious worship ordained. All horrible and immoralforms of worship practised and defended on the false ground

**स्कान्दपुराणं सूतसंहिता॥**

 Yegna or religious devotion is classified into, Karma or Sthula and gnana or Sukshma. The former is divided into three classes as explained in the previous quotations relating to thought, word and deed. The latter is the highest form of worship, but it is not suited to the sinners who are not qualified for the same. The various forms of worship adopted by the Budhas, Arhatas or other religionists as well as these practised according to the fancies of individuals are styled Yeguas, provided they contain the idea of a Supreme Being who is worshipped with feelings of devotion.

 **8.** Besides the ten Avatars of Vishnu generally known, there are many more described in the texts such as Haya-griva, Vyasa, Nara-narayana etc. Various incarnations of Siva, Bramha and Devi are also found mentioned. The minor gods and goddesses have their respective incarnations at times and all these are recognised as suitable for meditation and worship in accordance with the varying capacities of man. Similar to these Avatars, the manifest-

ations of Asuras, Rakshasas etc., are equally plenty, but they are not styled incarnations worth meditation. On the contrary they are required to be avoided and destroyed by securing the help of their godly opponents. Thus, all manifestations of God and His glories are treated as Avatars and are required for the religious advancement of every human being for the express purpose of getting over the conglomeration of worldly and phenomenal ideas.

 The two incarnations in question namely those of Rama and Krishna however do not fall under minor varieties, but are described as the grandest manifestations of Vishnu, as the greatest kings of the Bharata-varsha and members of the most illustrious Royal families known as the Solar and Lunar Dynasties. The very names of these two Dynasties disclose that they are not earthly as ordinarily supposed, but their origins are traced far above, to the Sun and the Moon. These are also described as the only two Dynasties capable of presiding over the sacred Bharata-varsha. We may therefore proceed with our enquiries regarding the significance of the two Dynasties or Vamsas is called the Surya and the Soma. The following quotations on the subject are likely to furnish a clear idea of their application to religious purposes.

 ***Quotation. No. I.***

 "In this manner, the union of the Sun and the moon, of Jivatma and ParaMatma, of all the dualities and relativities, is called Yoga. The spinal column is made up of twenty-one diamond gems. Everything rests in Sushumna like beads strung on a thread. As Sushumna lies on the path to salvation, it is in the form of Viswa. As time is determined by fixing the positions of the Sun and the moon, the Yogi retains his breath within himself after inhaling. The exhiling with the sound Hais known as the Sun, and the inhaling with the sound Sa is called the moon. The union of both is termed Hatha. Tho spot at which breath remains, mind also remains. The moon is mind, the sun is breath and sight is Agni or fire, representing Bindu, Nada and Kala as well as the Triads."

 It is plainly stated here that the Sun and the moon allude to Prana and mind, Bindu and Nada, Bramha and Vishnu. To the modern interpreters all these technical terms are unimportant and meaningless. The current interpretations entirely disregarding these technical definitions so clearly furnished in the texts are simply stupid and impertinent. To explain such terms by merely calling them occultisms without the least knowledge of their proper definitions, is complete deception or full-blown idiosy. The rustic of a Pandit however feels gratified at the wisdom and cogeney of his explanations for the enlightenment of his villagers.

**किं भूषणं सुन्दरसुन्दरीणां किं दूषणं पान्थजनस्य नित्यम्।

 ***Q. No. II.***

 "Apana is the moon that refreshes the whole body, Prana is either the Sun or Agni that matures or developes inside the body. The rise and fall of Samsara depend upon the opening and closing of Chitha as well as of Prana The working of the mind should be stopped by obstructing the currents of Vasana and Prana. This is accomplished by practice. The rise and fall of karma or action depent upon the rise and fall of ignorance."

 Here, Prans is described as the Sun and Apana as the moon. To the workings of Chitha and Prans are ascribed the rise aud fall of Samsara. There is the plain scientific psychology upon which the religious ordinances are based. The critic who dubs this by the title of superstition, must certainly be the professor of an unheard of science. The sun and the mɔɔn of our religious texts could not be discovered in the Pandit's Delhi and Oudh. His mistaken conceptions of them may however be found in the brains of his learned colleagues in other parts of India.

**श्रुते महाकवेः काव्ये नयने वदने च वाः।

** *Q. No. III & IV.***

 "The moon travels through the Ida and the Sun through the Pingala Nadis. Breath passing from Pingala to Ida is known as Uttarayana, and vice versa as Dekshinayana. Sushumna is the recipient of time. The moon pertains to Amrita and the sun to Visha or poison."

** *Q. No. V & VI.***

 "Those who take to the practice of gnana known as the Archir or Uttarayana-marga merge in the sun and never return. Others who take to Tapas, Yegna and Dana known as the Dhuma Dhuma or or Dekshinayana-marga reach the moon but return. These are the two glories of Bramhan attainable by the two prescribed paths. Those who cannot understand this are worms, moths, venomous devils."

 The above Upanishads, no doubt, certify with a vengeance, to the respectability of the modern interpreters. It is thus certain that perverse ingenuities of the current kind, continued to exist from time immemorial, causing irremediable nuisance to mankind.

**पोतो दुस्तरवारिराशितरणे दीपोऽन्धकारागमे

** *Q. No. VII & VIII.***

 "The Atma is conceived in two ways, the external and internal, the former being the sun whose movements are analogically applied to those of the internal Atma called Prana. The Atma is also conceived as of five divisions. Prana is the single and bright sun of thousand rays appearing in hundred forms and is in the form of Viswa the ultimate refuge for man. Soorya is the Atma pervading through all the movables and immovables."

 The external sun and its movements that are known to man, are here taken advantage of, for the analogical description of the internal and unknown Atma. The object to which the comparison is made is now mistaken for the real object aimed at, and it is condemned as an unscientific

superstition. This is simply a culpable injury done to the sacred literature.

** *Q. No. IX.***

 "Gnana-Yoga and Karma Yoya are the two Absence of religious paths long prescribed by me. Absence karma or action will not in itself procure liberation. He who simply abstains from prescribed karmas without purifying the heart, is a hypocrite. But he is wise who practises karma-yoga and controls the senses and mind. The Yogis who take to fire, brightness, day, the bright-fortnight and the six months of the Uttarayana, reach Bramhan, but those Yogis who take to smoke, night, dark-fortnight and the six months of the Dekshina yana, reach the light of the moon and revert."

 The regious of the sun and the moon here specified, refer only to the two varieties of attainment pertaining to a Yogi. They represent in technical language, the effects of karm-yoga and gnana-yoga. The modern interpreters who do not belong to either of these classes, need not foster any unnecessary fear of their being transported from their beloved earth, to the regions of the hot sun or the cold moon, leaving behind all the valuable property which they have eagerly earned during their life time.

** *Q. No. X.***

 "Vasishta said. Owing to want of wisdom and itelligence and also owing to the company of the unwise, man subjects himself to endless births and deaths, in the animal, human and Deva species of creation, like the

waxing and waning of the moon of 15 kalas. The sixteenth, kala which is subtle and eternal is known as soma. This kala is not used by the Devas, but it makes use of the Devas. It is the body called Avyakta, which being considered as 'mine', min reverts to it. If it is destroyed, salvation is attained.

 Yagna-valkya said. The five subtle elements and the ten Indrias make up 15 and the 16th is mind. Unity is. eternal and diversity is ephemeral belonging to Prakriti. Gnana or knowledge and soorya are Avyaktas; the knower, the object known and Vidya are the twenty-fifth Tatwabeyond Avyakta.

 Suka said. None can obtain liberation by karmas, without yoga. Soma is ever waxing and waning, and he falls to the earth with the Devas when shaken and ascends again. I do not therefore like to follow him. But the sun heats up the Lokas by his strong rays and he is eternal. I would certainly prefer to throw this body away and live in his region with a fully resigned heart, along with the Rishis."

 The technical Som and Soorya are here clearly explained as two paths; the former secures liberation after several trials and failures, and the latter leads directly to the goal all at once. The Pandit has not the least chance for explaining this soma as referring literally to the moon. It is said to fall to the earth with the Devas when shaken.

**न ह्येष क्षयतां याति सोमः सुरगणैर्यथा।  
कम्पितःपतते भूमिं पुनश्चैवाधिरोहति॥**

 The Pandit certainly has no idea of what is explained here. The critic and the Theosophist have no better informaation either. But all of them are able to explain, criticise and even improve upon, the passage under reference.

** *Q. N. XI.***

 When the eternal and single Atma desired for a second one, a bright light originated known as Soorya which lights up the three Lokas. Being the first creation in all the Jagats it is called Aditya from which twelve othr Adityas originated. The etetrnal Paramatma is Vishnu which is spoken of as ten Adityas or as one. The Aditya is full of the glories of Yoga. The eleven Vyrajas that have come down to the earth are termed Adityas; the twelth is my part known as Vishnu. When the ocean was again churned, soma was born. He is the jiva and Kshethragna seated inside the body. The sixteen Devas, men, trees etc. depend on him for their sustenance. He is worn by Rudra on his head. He is in the form of Viswa and water. Bramha being pleased with him gave him the fullmoon day".

 Soma is here clearly explained as representing Kshethregna and jiva. His origin from the ocean when it was churned, signifies the possibility of his perception only by deep meditation and steady devotional practice.

** *Q. No. XII.***

 "In the first Manwantara, two paths were determined by Bramha in his design of the Lokas, the sun being the doorway to the Devayana and the moon to the Pithriyana,"

 This is only an additional ाxplanation for the terms under reference.

* **Q. No. XIII.***

 "When the Jagat was full of darkness, unperceivable and sleepy, Easwara created Avyakta and the subtle elements, which destroyed all the darkness. The eternal Purushothama, the 26th Tatwa is Parom-Bramha

known as Bhaskara or the sun. He first created water and applied his essence to it from which the Devas, Asuras and men originated. This essence is known by the namès Virya, Bija, Sukra, Reta and Ugra. Thus Bhaskara created the three Lokas. When he was awakened he created Manas which is both sat and Asat. This Manas then began to create Vipula or Akasa originated from it whose quality is sound."

 Here we obtain a clear definition of Bhaskara or the sun as representing Parom-bramhan.

** *Q. No. XIV.***

 "He is the greatest among the Gods who destroys darkness by his rays the moment he rises. When the Lok is were destitute of movables and immovables and were filled with complete darkness, myself, Vishnu and Maheswara remained there meditating upon the sunwho resides in the heart of all. He then appeared and destroyed all the darkness. Therefore, the Yogis, Sankhyas and all others desiring for emancipation, meditate upon this god."

 The religious sun is here explained as the light-giving God seated in the heart of all. The modern Pandit can satisfy all his requirements by merely looking outside; and he does not feel the necessity to look within where this Puranic sun hides itself through fear for him.

** *Q. No. XV.***

 "The object represented by Om is Vishnu the Lord of words. The Rakshasas are destroyed, by uttering this manthra, and the Sun referred to here is a portion of Vishnu representing the internal light."

 This passage has been already explained in connection with sandhya in chapter III. The sun daily adored is defined as denoting the Atma and the light within.

** *Q. No. XVI & XVII.***

 "The junction between the brows and the noso is the junction of the Akasaand Para Lokas. The wisemeditate upon this junction or Sandhya. By the knowledge of the unity of ParamatmaandAtma, the idea of their separate existence is destroyed. This knowledge of unity is sandhya."

 The sun connected with this sandhya has been already explained.

 ***Q. Nos. XVIII & XIX.***

 "The ocean of Akasa, which is the basis for the elements and the Devas, is called soma. The Eswara combined with Uma is known as Soma."

 These are additional technical explanations for the term soma. Whatever may be its real technical significance as explained here, it is absolutely certain, that the Pandit's conception of it as applying to the satellite moon or the soma plant is not corroborated here.

** *Q. No. XX.***

 Again in the Treta-Yugs, the sapta rishis originate with the king known as Bramha-Kshethra, for the purpose of Bija (letters of Manthra). Thus the sapta rishis with the kings appear in every cycle of yugas for continuation. This is the elevation and relation of Kshethras in Manwantaras,described in the Vedas. Their decay is in accordance with that of the Parkritis. Their origin, longivity and decay are known to the Sapta-Rishis. This is the regular course of yoga by which the Ilas and Ikshwakus originate in Treta and decay in Kali. Up to the endof the Manwantara, they follow the yugas. After Parsu-Rama annihilated all the kshethriyas in the earth, the two Vamsas named the Ilas

and the Ikshuakus originated. They are declared to represent the Parkriti. The Ilas are plenty in the world but not so the Ikshwakus. In this manner, thousands of Raja-Rishis have already passed away. In the current Vyvaswata-manwantara too, the stability of the Lokas depends upon their rise and fall."

 Every word, every expression in this quotation is highly technical. It is feared that both the original and the translation would be perplexing to the Pandit, who has all along been labouring under the mistaken notion that the teclinical religious philosophy here explained is nothing more than human history. He cannot brook the idea of religion or philosophy without human transactions and lucrative dealings; much less appreciate them as valuable and useful literature.

**गतागीता नाशं क्वचिदपि पुराणं व्यपगतं  
विलीनाःस्मृत्यर्था निगमनिचयो दूरमगमत्।  
इदानीं रैदासप्रभृतिवचनैर्मोक्षपदवी  
तदेवं जानीमो कलियुग तवैवैष महिमा॥**

 **9.** If the passages quoted above are only carefully perused and ordinarily interpreted without a bias, unmindful even of the devotion and seriousness they justly demand, I daresay, it would not be difficult to see clearly the ideas prominently set forth in every one of them without any contradictions or material differences as compared with each other.

 The sun, moon and the earth are three of the planets with which man is most closely and materially connected, and their necessary and beneficial influences are scientifically acknowledged and practically experienced by all in every day life. The earth on which he lives is the general and unavoidable support for his body affording means of sustenauce for his life. He is born out of her and goes back to

her and is therefore entirely dependant on her. The devotional sphere with the central Meru or the Vedas has therefore been described as the Bhumi-Padma or the most comfortable, fragrant and sacrel ground for man's refuge from the painful and inextricable miseries of this phenomenal existence. Want a sublimeand poetic idea! It is really surprising that this should be so dogmatically explained as referring exactly to the contents of Indian Geography composed by English authors in the present century. It is indeed a great misfortune that our Pandit's brain has some how become too congealed and impervious to allow such ordinary but important ideas to penetrate. Unless he exerts vigorously to improve himself at once in the necessary directions, there is absolutely no use in depending upon him for religious instruction and guidance, in spite of his current renown for his knowledge of Sanskrit literature.

 Quite in conformity with the grandure and magnanimity of the Bhumi-pamdma, two of the best heavenly torches, the sun and the moon are appropriately provided for the purpose of lighting its sacred surface.

 The sun is clearly defined as the Atma itself and the moon as the kshetragna or individual self.

 The distinctive features of sun and moon above set forth furnish the necessary informations regarding the two Vamsas or dynasties. The history of Soorya-vamsa refers to the processes adoptedfor knowing the Para-bramhan and that of the Soma-Vamsa refers to the knowledge of kshetregnaor individual self. The latter knowledge no doubt has to be first attained before attempting for the former. Thus, the Maha-Bharata which treats of the Soma-vamsa should be previously studied and practised for qualifying oneself for the study and practice of the Ramayana which describes the Soorya-vamsa.

 The exact knowledge of Tat-pada and Twom-pada should be separately obtained, both in theory and practice before they are united together into the Maha-vakya 'Tat-twom-asi', the merging of the Individual self into the Universal self. The two epics therefore deal with this most important subject, furnishing complete details of procedure in the usual Puranic style, comprising of the processes to be adopted and the obstructions to be overcome together withtheir necessary re.nedies. The Maha-bharata and the Ramayana are therefore the original and real commentaries on the sacred Vedas, the repository of our ancient and invaluable philosophy. It has been repeatedly noticed that the study of the Vedas will not only be incomplete without a knowledge of the Puranas and Itihasas but will also prove dangerous by misapplication and misinterpretation.

 The essential and ultimate meanings of Tat and Twom, the That and the I or thou, have been already examined in Chapter II with their Vachyarthas and Lekshyarthas. When the collateral and circumstantial accessories and attribates are eliminated from the two ideas ordinarily representedby Tat andTwom, we arrive at the same residue in both, a union of which in accordance with the maha-vakya namely "Tat-twom-asi' is therefore only & matter of words.

 **वाच्यं लक्ष्यमिति द्विधार्थसरणी वाच्यस्य हि त्वंपदे वाच्यं भौतिकमिन्द्रियादिरपि यल्लक्ष्यं त्वमर्थश्च सः।वाच्यं तत्पदमीशताकृतमतिर्लक्ष्यन्तु सच्चित्मुखानन्दब्रह्म तदर्थ एष च तयोरैक्यं त्वसीदं पदम्॥**

 The above is the philosophical explanation of the whole matter. There is also a secondary and Yogic use of the terms Soorya and Söma.

**इडायां चन्द्रमा नित्यं चरत्येव महामुने।

 The breaths through the right and left nostrils are styled Soorya and Soma by the Yogis, closely following the philosophical description of the Deva-yana and Pitri-yana,

the Uttarayana-marga leading to the sun and the Dekshinayana leading to the moon respectively.

 The moon, Kshetregna or puremind is described as the 16th kala, the fifteen kalas consisting of 5 Elements and 10 Indriyas, which are metaphorically used as the fifteen kalas or days of the moon with its waxing and waning.

***Q. No. X.***

**क्षीयते हि सदा सोमः पुनश्चैवाभिपूर्यते।

तदेवं षोडशकलं देहमव्यक्तसंञ्जितम्।  
ममायमिति मन्वान स्तत्रैव परिवर्तते।**

 In both the philosophical and Yogic descriptions, the sun and the moon are located in the Heart and the Head respectively, and this location is generally found described in the Puranas and Itihasts. Thus invariably in all the religious texts, the moon will be placed far above the sun. Without understanding this simple technical use of the terms, many an ingenious invention is brought forward to reconcile the misplacement of the two planets and very often the astronomical advancement of the ancients is arrogantly questioned. The mere fact of misplacement of these two important planets should on the contrary have naturally led us to infer that something different in kind was being explained. But even today probably, the the majority of the Pandits would treat any such attempt as an act of blasphemy. Religious interpretations in their view, should invariably be based upon ignorance and dogmatism of an extremely unreasonable type. This is more or less the foundation upon which the modern sanskrit study is built, and the recent Sanskrit Colleges in India started in initation of other existing ones for English education, must have used several old stones of ignorance

and dogmatism for their foundation, combined with a few foreign stones and materials which could not possibly withstand the trying atmosphere of the tropical regions. The outlook of such constructions is however, sufficiently gloomy, and the natural product could not be anything better than a new set of Pundits of the old type more discontented and less religiously inclined. These new scholars may even venture to question the correctness and importance of the religious texts themselves, unlike their predecessors and may dispose of difficulties as matters of innocent ignorance of the venerable authors. The point at issue here, namely the position of the moon far above that of the sun, as found described in many à reigious text, demands however its immediate attention, as well as all the Indian astronomers, who could not afford to accept the simple explanation provided in the literature. The passages in question are noted below for special reference.

**कर्मभूमेस्तथोर्द्धञ्चरविर्योजनलक्षकः।  
ततः शशी तथामामस्ततश्चोर्ध्वं भमण्डलम्॥**

**भविष्यपुराणम्॥**

 I trust that the above passages, distinctly placing the moon far above the sun will suffice to convince us of the real interpretation of the term Soma as used in the texts and clearly defined therein. The Pandit's interpretation as moon, without a knowledge of the technical definition furnished, is thus neither a great discovery nor any erudite explanation. It is simply the ordinary Dictionary meaning of the word which any young Sanskrit student could easily give. It is thus evident that the so called Pandit has not gone an inch beyond the school boy even in his literary attainments so far, except perhaps in his voluntary attempt to misinterpret the texts against the definitions clearly furnished within themselves.

 Leaving the moon here, there is still something similar to be noticed in the interpretation of the sun. Quotation 17 very cogently explains the necessity of Sandhya ceremony performed both morning and evening. The sun is said to be attacked daily by certain Rakshasas called Mandebas at both the junctures of day and night. The oblations offered at the times accompanied by the Gayatri-mantra take the form of Vajrayudha or a diamond weapon and destroy the Rakshasas, thus saving the sun from obstruction to its continuous journey. The necessity of Sandhya ceremony is entirely based upon this description which if taken literally as by a Pandit, can convey no reason-

able meaning. The Rakshasas referred. to are not only unseen from other parts of the world, but are also invisible from all localities in India itself. Their daily warfare with the sun as well as the consequent obstruction to its journey are equally unperceived and unproved. The current interpretation therefore reduces the holy Sandhya ceremony to a farce and a waste of time. But we can clearly understand from the quotation that the ceremony as explained therein, is indispensable to all who care for salvation. The meaning of Sandhya is given specially in quotations 16 & 17 as the union of the Individual with the Universal self. The name of the Rakshasas as Mandehas clearly denotes the diminution in the duration of the day, and here metaphorically refers to the sins of man that obstructs the real knowledge of Bramhan.

**दहत्यशेषरक्षांसि मन्देहाख्यान्यघानिवै॥**

 It is not at all difficult to see here that the technical use of terms introduced in the texts is after all so simple, although the confusion created on its account is disproportionately great.

**अज्ञात्वा शास्त्रहृदयं मूढो वक्त्यन्यथान्यथा।  
अविज्ञाय च तत्वार्थं बुद्धेरज्ञानवैभवात्॥**

 Coming down to quotation 20 which directly deals with the origin of the Soorya and Soma Vamsas, it is hoped that the explanations already offered on the use of the terms Soorya and Somain the texts, will render the gist of the descriptions furnished easily comprehensible.

**क्षीणे कलियुगे चैव तिष्ठन्तीति कृते युगे।  
सप्तर्षयस्तु तैस्सार्धं मध्ये त्रेतायुगे पुनः।  
बीजार्थं वै भविष्यन्ति ब्रह्मक्षत्रस्तु वै नृपः॥**

 The quotation here has to be carefully examined piecemeal, as it contains complete information on the subject.

 After the Kali yuga, the Krita reverts. We have already seen that Krita-yuga refers to the stage of completion in devotional practice as the terin clearly denotes.

**कृतमेव न कर्तव्यम्।**

 Kali similarly represents the stage of ignorance and absence of religious merit. Both of them therefore signify the two extremes which demand no further explanations on the texts. In the Krita, what th texts could teach has been attained and in the Kali, they have nothing to teach as it stands outside the limits of religious training. The two remaining yugas alone, namely Treta and Dwapara are capable of being treatel in the texts for the purpose of providing practical instructions for religious advancement. We could thus clearly see that the contents ofour religious literature as a whole, chiefly apply to the Treta and Dwapara yugas The Krita as we have seen is beyond the requirements of religious instruction and Kali is below the province of religious education. The Penal, Civil and Political laws, agriculture and commerce, histories and geographies, and all the material sciences which contribute to the welfare of humanity in the ordinary sense of the expression, fall within the dominion of Kali and are eliminated as the exclusive privileges of the worldlywise man. Nobody need therefore regret or feel annoyed that the ancient sages ever attempted to stand in the way of modern progress; on the contrary they quietly retired from the field altogether and took up a less pretentious subject called Religion which they particularly sought by almost disconnecting themselves from all that is here enumerated for worldly advancement. We may thus safely rest assured that the harmless sages will not venture to meddle with what passes for religion amongst mankind in general for the sake of fashion, or etiquette or with the so

called reforms invariably based upon the practical rejection of religious principles inculcated in their works. It would certainly be an act of injustice to drag their names in vain, for or against modern reforms thus attempted in various directions. As a lawyer would object, they could not be joined as parties to the suit. It is often forgotten that the Religious Gazette has long proclaimed their exemption from the necessity of appearing before the modern tribunals. The Kali is completely beyond their jurisdiction and they would not dare to trespass. We are entirely independent in our own enviable sphere and free to act according to our sweet will and pleasure. We are doubtless quite out of their clutches in our head-long exertions to improve ourselves, without knowing what we do and probably even what we want.

**लोके व्यवायामिषमद्यसेवा  
जन्तोस्तु नित्या न हि तत्र चोदना॥**

 We thus clearly see that the Krita and the Kali do not require more than a general description of their characteristics, the Treta and Dwapara alone being closely connected with what is known as religion in the texts.

 Coming back to quotation 20 we find that the Sapta-Rishis descend from the Krita to the Treta-yuga with a view to propogation, accompanied by the necessary rulers styled Bhamah-kshetras. What this represents is also explained in the same quotation.

**एतेन क्रमयोगेन ऐलाइक्ष्वाकवो नृपाः।  
उत्पद्यमानास्त्रेतायां क्षीयमाणाः कलौ युगे।  
अनुयान्ति युगाख्यन्तु यावन्मन्वन्तरक्षयम्।**

 In the treatment of Rishis in the previous pages we found that the Sapta-Rishis represent the Sapta-prakritis सप्तप्रकृतयोह्येताः । The quotation clearly explains that the

matter referred to is the gradual progress of yoga—एतेन क्रमयोगेन॥ The soorya and the soma vamsa rulers are said to originate in Treta and become extinct in Kali and the process is repeated until the Manwantara is over. We thus clearly see that the Treta represents the rule of the Soorya-vamsa and Dwapara that of the Soma-vamsa. Both the Vamsas appear to be of a common caste called Bramha.kshetra. An examination of this word will therefore furnish us with sufficient information to understand the whole description. In the quotation itself we find that when all the other rulers are destroyed by Parsu-Rama, the two dynasties arise and that they represent the Prakritis. We also find that the creation and destruction of the Lokas depend upon the rise and fall of these two dynasties.

**जामदग्न्येन रामेण क्षत्रे निरवशेषिते।  
रिक्तेयं वसुधा सर्वा क्षत्रियैर्वसुधाधिपैः।  
द्विवंशकरणं सर्वं कीर्तयिष्ये निबोधत।  
ऐलञ्चेक्ष्वाकु वंशश्व प्रकृतीं परिचक्षते।  
तेषान्तु निधनोत्पत्तौ लोकसंस्थितय स्थिताः।**

 The Lokas have been examined long ago and found to represent the Prakritis meditated upon as the glories of the Almighty. Thus we come to understand that the Sapta-Rishis, the Lokas and the two royal dynasties almost speak of one specific matter. The caste of the two dynasties however styled Bhamha-kshetra is the most important and significant point here. The words Kshatra and Kshetra ordinarily mean body or material form, and the term under reference clearly signifies the conception of the formless Bramhan in some form.

**क्षयणात् करणाच्चैव क्षतत्राणात्तथैव च।  
भोज्यत्वाद्विषयत्वाच्च क्षेत्रं क्षेत्रविदोविदुः॥**

**वायुपुराणम्॥**

**ससर्ज क्षत्रियान् ब्रह्मा ब्राह्मणानां हिताय वै।

**कूर्मपुराणम्॥**

** अग्निर्गन्धर्वः।तस्योषधयः अप्सरसः। ऊर्जोनाम।स इदं ब्रह्मक्षत्रं पातु ता इदं ब्रह्मक्षत्रं पान्तु॥**

**मन्त्रः॥**

 The Saguna-nirguna, Sakala-nishkala, Parapara, Purana-purusha, Apara-Bramha or Sabda-Bramha, which alone is capable of being meditated upon in different forms or described in the religious texts by the use of language, is doubtless the object described by Bramha-kshetra. Its indispensable association with the Sapta-prakritis mentioned above needs therefore no further explanation. The various synonyms for Sabda Bramha here noticed have been defined in the previous pages, but may be repeated for further reference. The reasons already alleged for the necessity of this Apara-Bramha as the mediator between man and Para-Bramha should not be forgotten, and the various forms of this Sabda-Bramha prescribed for religious worship should not also be treated as poetical allegories as is very ordinarily and easily done. As long as most of the affairs in this material world continue to be experienced and acknowledged by man as unbearable and tangible miseries, the religious practices prescribed by our ancient sages in strict conformity with science and philosophy, will doubtless be found to be the real remedies for them, if they are only followed with sincerity and devotion. The remedies are as true as the diseases themselves, both scientifically and practically. How could they then be pronounced allegories or myths? In the correct philosophical analysis of the material world, no doubt, the critic himself is a myth and a false personage, but the criticism he now offers is from a

low stand point, which could not be confounded with the nobler and higher philosophical plain where the said critic has no status to appear.

**स्वानुभूत्यानुसारेण तर्क्यतां मा कुतर्क्यताम्।  
अज्ञात्वा ग्रन्थतत्वानि वादं यः कुरुते नरः।  
लोभाद्वाप्ग्रथवा दम्भात्सपापी नरकं व्रजेत्।  
निर्णयञ्चापि छिद्रात्मा न तद्वक्ष्यति तत्वतः।**

 The nearest approach to the formless in some form is thus absolutely necessary for religious meditation, as man is constituted at present, until he qualifies himself for the highest stage.

**जन्मान्तरशताभ्यस्ता मिथ्या संसारवासना।  
सा चिराभ्यासयोगेन विना न क्षीयते कचित्।**

** *Quotation. No. I.***

 "There are two varieties of knowledge to be attained, namely the knowledge of Sabdabramhan and that of Parom-bramhan. The securing of the former naturally leads to that of the latter."

** *Q. No. II.***

 "The Parom-bramhan is eternal and without form. It has however three forms, namely, Nishkala, Sakala and Sakala-nishkala. That which is true knowledge and bliss is Nishkala. But that which is combined with Maya and Avidya as well as the three gunas, is called Maheswara and Sakala-nishkala. It is this form that by tapas and knowledge, desired for the creation of Prejas."

 The Almighty Eswara is here clearly defined as alluding to the sabda-bramhan and sakala-nishkala.

** *Q. No. III.***

 "Name and form are the attributes of the jegat; satchit and Ananda are those of Bramhan as compared with the qualities of the jegat. The satwic state of Prakriti is called Maya, and the reflection of Bramhan in it is known as the all-knowing and all-powerful Eswara."

 This is a philosophical explanation of the same sabda-bramhan.

** *Q. No. IV.***

 "That which is all-wise is in the from of tapas and knowledge. From this, name, forn and Annom or Avyakrita originated. The wise see in the Manthras, the workings of this sabda– bramhan in various manner in the Treta. Those who desire to attain to the highest truth, should follow this course which is the right path in the Lokas."

 It is clearly stated here that the workings of the sabda–bramban are seen in the Treta-yugas and in the manthras, and that they represent the proper religious path for man to follow. The Pandit surely does not understand what this decription means, which connects together the manthras, the Treta-yugis and the sabda-bramhau.

*** Q. Nos. V & VI.***

 "The destruction of the Tatwas from the Mahat down to the gross elements, is called Prakriti's Preti-sarga by those who explain time. Avyakta is Kshethra and Bramha is Kshethregna. The creation without the intellect, that occurs suddenly like a lightning, basedupon Kshethregna is known as Prakriti-Sarga."

 This point has been already explained in the previous Chapter.

** *Q. Nos. VII & VIII.***

 "Nishkala is the first, sakala-nishkala is the second and sakala is the third. Siva settles of his own accord for the use of the yogis, the creation of all the Tatwas and the origin of the Lokas. Nishkala represents the Tatwa, sakala is the Murti or form and Sakala-nishkala is thePrebhava."

 The term Prebhava literally means glory, strength, extension. This is exactly the subject matter dealt with

throughout the religious literature. The Pandit's interpretation however, evacuates all the Prebhava of God from the sacred texts, and substitutes that of man. In spite of this, the Pandit no doubt feels that he has done very useful work.

** *Q. No. IX.***

 "There are six kinds of proofs according to Logic. That which cannot be discovered by any of these methods is Siva-Tatwa. It takes of its own accord a body for the purpose of creating all the Tatwas and the Lokas and for their preservation, in the interest of its devotees. This body is of three sorts, Nishkala called Parom, sakala called Paramom and Sakala-nishkala known as Paraparom.".

 Evidently, the Pandit does not know up to date, the existence of any such technical or important difference between the terms Parom, Paramom and Paraparom. In these silly matters too, he is a perfect Vedanti devoid of all unnecessary distinctions such as right and wrong, sense and nonsense.

** *Q. No. X.***

 The Atharvana sruti distinguishes two kinds of Atma, the Para and the Apara; the former is without attributes and the latter is combined with egoism. The knowledge of their unity is called yoga. Thus the Atma seated in the heart within the physical body is called Apara-Bramhan. Paramatma is Para-bramhan. The body is known as Kshetra and the Atman seated inside is called Kshethregna; he remains in the form of Avyakta and Parama and determines the arrangements of the letters from A to Ksha. In the body made up of the five elements, this Atma combined with the internal organs is known as Purana-purusha, Sabda-bramhan and Aparatma.”

 Various synonyms are here given for the Eswara seated inside the heart of man. He is known in the religious literature as, Aparatma, Apara-bramhan, Kshethregna, Purana-purusha and Sabda-bramhan. This is a conception of God as enjoyed by the internal organs of man in their pure and devotional condition. When their play becomes extinct by the still higher processes of yoga, He becomes the Paramatma. Thus it is plain that the history of this Purana-purusha doals with the religious work of an in his onward devotional march, discovering and enjoying more and more of the glories of this Eswara until he loses his separate personality in the ocean of divine bliss. Let the childish Pandit defile not this sacred and valuable legacy of ours any more, with his base conceptions of human valour and greatness.

 **10.** It is highly necessary here to summarise the substance of the foregoing explanations and place the same clearly before us with a view to avoid all possible doubts regarding the interpretations of the important points connected with the main subject. We could gather from the above quotations that the Bramhan is generally classified into Para and Apara; and the latter represents the conception of the Absolute a repository of all the highest and best qualities known to mau, such as, Almighty, All-bliss, eternal, All-wise, All-merciful, All-seeing etc. Of course these are attributed only in comparison to the contrary deficiencies experienced by man in this material world.Vide Q. No. 3.

**अपेक्ष्य नामरूपे द्वे सच्चिदानन्द तत्परः॥**

 There is again another classification into Sakala, Sakala-nishkala, and Nishkala. The first refers to the material form and the last to Para-Bramhan. The second is the same as the Apara-Bramhan or Sabda-Bramhan, which

is utilized with advantage in the highest forms of religious practices, namely, Gnana-yoga and Karma-yoga. With the detailed explanations furnished by these quotations, it is not difficult to understand the correct application of the term Sakala-nishkala (meaning a combination of Sakala and nishkala) as being used synonymous with Apara-Bramhan, Purana-Purusha, Sabda-Bramhan and Eswara, and that all of them equally refer to the same idea expressed by Bramha-kshetra. The real Bramhan is Parom or Nishkalom, the unknown and the unseen, lying entirely beyond the province of Reason or Budhi, where knowing and seeing have no meaning. The Sakalom, the known and the seen is purely material, virtually representing the effect rather than the cause. The Sakala-nishkala is not the material effect but represents the Spiritual cause, the exclusive privilege of the original creator of the Universe, over which, man as he is constituted at present has no control. This spiritual cause is classified into seven Prakritis, and the religious practices ordained refer to them particularly with a view to get out of the bondage consequent on their actions, as well as to reach the ultimate Prakriti or the Holy maya in which the real Bramhan is reflected as the Apara-Brahman. Vide Q. No. 3.

**शुद्धसत्वप्रधानायां मायायां बिम्बितो ह्यजः।  
सत्वप्रधाना प्रकृतिःमायेति प्रतिपद्यते॥**

 The perception of this reflection further leads you to the highest goal. Vide Q. No. 1.

**शब्दब्रह्मणि निष्णातः परम्ब्रह्माधिगच्छति।**

 This is the most logical, scientific and philosophical religion provided in our ancient literature, in the form of Histories of the rulers of two illustrious dynasties known as the Soorya and Soma Vamsas. The periods of their rule,

we have already found to be limited to the Treta and Dwapara yugas and their territorial extents limited to the Bharata-varsha in Jambu-Dwipa.

**जम्बूद्वीपस्य संस्थानं यज्ञिया यत्र वे कियाः॥**

 The Kali yuga is unsuited in every way for the birth of any of the rulers in either dynasty.

**उत्पद्यमानाः त्रेतायां क्षीयमाणाः कलौ युगे।**

 They originate in Treta and become extinct in Kali. They are however of the Bramha-Kshetra caste, and are created for helping the Bramhins and save all from every possible injury and misfortune. The difference of these two castes was created by Bramha in the Treta yuga.

**ससर्ज क्षत्रियान् ब्रह्मा ब्राह्मणानां हिताय वै।  
वर्णाश्रमव्यवस्थाञ्च त्रेतायां कृतवान् प्रभुः।  
क्षयणात् करणाञ्चैव क्षतत्राणात्तथैव च।  
भोज्यत्वाद्विषयत्वाच्च क्षेत्रं क्षेत्रविदो विदुः॥**

 These lines are sufficiently plain and significant. The Krita-yuga refering to the completion of the required practices, represents the stage beyond Bramha-kshetra or Apara-Bramhan, namely the attainment of Para-Bramhan itself, where all ideas of Histories aud Geographies, worship and no worship are completely eliminated. The Triputi or the separate conceptions of the knower, known and knowing are here entirely melted and fused together. The Para-Bramhan is not therefore capable of description in words or imagination in thought. The Apara-Bramhan very appropriately also styled Purna-Purusha is the only Purusha or Being that could be described in the Puranas for the benefit of mankind particularly inclined to accept and act out the processes ordained for religious

advancement. This is more or less the summary of the elaborate and lucid descriptions furnished by our venerable sages in the voluminous texts bequeathed to us on the subject. And there is no doubt that without any culpable mischief by alterations or interpolations, these very texts exactly, are so bluntly and carelessly misinterpreted in the most ridiculous and unreasonable fashion, in this highly civilized century of the Kali Ers. On amature consideration of the whole affair, we are forced to take a very charitable view of these misinterpreters whom we are naturally prone to find fault with. The possible and probable mistakes in this direction have been celarly foretold by our wise sages and their real cause is specially attributed to the Kali itself, without throwing any blame on mankind in general. The subjoined passage furnishing vivid descriptions of the Era in question, will it is hoped be of some interest especially in this connection.

**कुकर्माचरणात्सारः सर्वतो निर्गतोधुना।  
पदार्थाः संस्थिता भूमौ बीजहीनास्तुषा यथा।  
विप्रैर्भागवती वार्ता गेहे गेहे जने जने।

पुत्रस्योत्पादने दक्षा अदक्षा मुक्तिसाधने।  
अयन्तु युगधर्मोहि वर्तते कस्य दूषणम्॥**

**पद्मपुराणम्॥**

 "By the wicked conduct of the people the essence of everything is gone. Things remainlike husk without the grain inside. Bramhins began to carry religious stories from man to man and from door to door for a trifling income, and the spirit of the stories has evaporated. The atheistic, the cruel and the vicious began to occupy the centres for holy baths, and their effective qualities have therefore departed from those places. People agitated by anger, avarice and greed began to perform tapas; its effects have therefore vanished. Dhyanayoga began to be practised by proud people who have no religious study or control over their minds and who are associated with the low; its effects have also therefore become extinct. The Pandits are exclusively engaged in procreation like buffaloes without the least interest for matters relating to emancipation. All this is the Dharma of the yuga and who is to be blamed?"The yuga here should not be misunderstood as specifying any particular era. We have already seen that man makes the yuga and not the yuga the man. The quotation simply alludes to the description of man at all times, in his anxious mood for securing material prosperity.

**प्राणाघातान्निवृत्तिः परधनहरणे संयमः सत्यवाक्यम्  
काले शक्त्या प्रदानं युवतिजनकथामूकभावः परेषाम्।  
तृष्णास्त्रोतोविभङ्गो गुरुषु च विनयः सर्वभूतानुकम्पा  
सामान्यःसर्वशास्त्रेष्वनुपहतविधिः श्रेयसामेष पन्थाः॥**

 **11.** Having understood the general significance of the Soorys and Soma Vamsas as supplying rulers for the Bharata-varsha in the Treta and Dwapara yugas, it is necessary to get at the distinguishing features of these dyanasties, or in other words to find out the gist of the real contents of the Ramayana and the Maha-Bharata. We have

already noticed that they particularly refer to the processes of gnana-yoga and karma-yoga and deal with the universal soul and the individual soul respectively; and until the latter is attained by processes of yoga, we are not qualified for the former which has to be obtained by Sankhya. The spiritual agencies to be invoked for the purpose of passing through these two paths to the ultimate end, are Rama and Krishna. Their technical differences will be explained later on. But there is an important point of difference between the two methods which could be easily ascertained and understood. The object of the Karma-yoga is to eliminate all obstructions to the religious advancement caused by worldly attachments to the individual self, the thou or I. When these obstacles to progress are removed and the idea of the self is merged in the universal by Karma-yoga the higher process of Sankhya has only to deal with the universal soul alone; whereas throughout the process of the Karma-yoga, the ideas of both are combined. We can thus easily arrive at the conclusion that in the Ramayana process we have to deal only with the Bramhan in some form, but in the Mana Bharta process, we have to exert ourselves to destroy the crude ideas of the Thou and I keeping the Bramhan of course in view, in some appropriate form suited to the lower process. The main topic of the Ramayana isthus single in character comprising only of the search after the Bramhan and all the necessary practices to attain and maintan the same; whereas, in the Maha-Bharata it is double having to deal slightly with the Universal soul and more with the individual soul called Kootasta which is practically not different from Bramhan as explained in Chapter II.

**कूटवन्निर्विकारेण स्थितःकूटस्थ उच्यते।  
आनन्दरूपः सर्वार्थसाधकत्वेन हेतुना।**

**सर्वसम्बन्धवत्वेन सम्पूर्णःशिवसंज्ञितः।  
इति शैवपुराणेषु कूटस्थः प्रविवेचितः॥**

 The conception of the real substratum of the cosmology of the total universe is Bramhan and the substratum of the individual being, is Kootasta. They are compared to the full canvas of a picture representing the universe as well as to the particular portion of the same occupied by the picture of a single individual. Both specify exactly the original and the same canvas, but are distinguished only by the difference in extent. This phenomenal idea of space being removed by philosophical analysis, the difference in the substrata vanishes. The Kootasta, the real Thou or I, then becomes exactly the real That or Bramhan. The Maha-Bharata as already noticed directly deals with this Jiva-Atma as combined with the Paramatma and the Ramayana deals with the latter alone.

** 12.** The above passages deserve to be examined in detail as they are extremely explicit in their explanations. They are however sure to irritate beyond limit, the feelings of all dogmatic critics and stun their intellect as if by a severe and unexpected blow. It is feared that the criticsmay be induced even to go to the extent of questioning the authenticity of the texts and denounce the whole as a farfetched allegory with a view to vindicate themselves. But it is nevertheless a tangible fact that such would be critics would be ever unable to continue their own sensible interpretations for two lines together. This is indeed a very critical and turning point in our treatment of the subject and all possible attention and sympathy are entreated of the reader to evade unnecessary doubts and misunderstandings of the explanations of any of the facts noted here in the subsequent treatment of the subject.

 1, In quotations 1 & 2, the Ramayana is represented as the real basis for all the Itihasas and Puranas.

**तन्मूलं सर्वकाव्यानामितिहासपुराणयोः।  
संहितानाञ्च सर्वासां मूलं रामायणं मतम्॥**

 2. The Maha-Bharata is said to be an exact reflection of the Ramayana.

**तदेवादर्शमाराध्य वेदव्यासो हरेःकला।  
चक्रे महाभारताख्यमितिहासं पुरातनम्॥  
रामायणपरीपाठ्या त्वं महाभारतं कुरु॥**

 3. The author of the Ramayana is said to be not different from Bramha, and that of Maha-Bharata is Vishnu himself, Vyasa being only the subsequent compiler.

य**त् त्वं वेदार्थवक्तास्याः काव्यरूपेण सर्वशः।  
नाहं त्वत्तः पृथक्भूतः कविरन्यः प्रजापतिः।  
त्वन्तु रामचरित्राणि मुने भावीनि वर्णय।  
वेदः परिणतो भूत्वा महाभारततां गतः।  
भारतं कृतवान् पूर्वे देवो नारायणः स्वयम्।  
भारतस्य विधानाय त्वं नारायणनिर्मितः॥**

 4. As to the contents of the two epics & general description is here given. The Ramayana in the disguise of Rama's history treats of all the Dharmas. Whereas the Maha-Bharata treats of smritis and Dharma-Samhitas.

**तत्र रामचरित्रस्य व्यपदेशेन सर्वशः।  
सर्वे धर्माः समुद्दिष्टा वर्णाश्रमविभागशः।  
नानादेशचरित्राणि शत्रुमित्रकथा अपि।  
इतिहास स्वरूपेण सर्वे धर्मा निरूपिताः॥**

**वेदः परिणतो भूत्वा महाभारततां गतः।  
कार्याकार्यनिर्णयोत्र स्मृतिर्वै धर्मसंहिताः।  
इतिहासादि वाक्यन्तु तन्निदर्शनसाधकम्॥**

 **5.** The main difference in the subject of the two epics is specified as consisting in the treatment of Paramatma alone in the Ramayana, and of Jivatma and Paramatma combined in the Maha-Bharata.

**परमात्मस्वरूपस्य सीतारामस्य चेष्टितम्।  
वर्णितञ्चैकरूपस्य तच्छरीर विशेषवत्।  
स एव देवो भगवान् कृष्णःकमललोचनः।  
जीवद्वितीयश्चक्रीड भूभारक्षयहेतवे।  
जीवात्मपरमात्मानौ नरनारायणावुभौ।  
नारायणो वासुदेवः नरैश्चार्जुनाह्वयः।  
नरनारायणमयं तन्महाभारतं विदुः।  
एकं रामायणमयं कृतं रामायणं मया।  
रामायणे भारते च विशेषोयमुदाहृतः॥**

 **6. **Vanmiki is said to have prophetically described the Ramayana which Vishnu is expected to carry out as detailed.

**त्वन्तुरामचरित्राणि मुने भावीनि वर्णय।  
तत्तु रामायणं नाम महाकाव्यं भविष्यति।  
वर्णयिष्यसि यद्यत्त्वं तत्तु विष्णुः करिष्यति।  
विष्णोः कीर्तौभवत्काव्यं स्थास्यत्याचन्द्रतारकम्॥**

 **7.** Then again the words, Kritom, Chakray and Kuru used to denote apparently the composition of the epics clearly refer to action. The details of the contents of both are meant to be acted out by man and not merely read or rewritten.

 **8.** Quoation 3 furnishes the general outline of the Maha-Bharta in plainer and more technical upanishadic language.

**ओंकार रथमारुह्य विष्णुं कृत्वाथ सारथिम्।  
ब्रह्मलोक परान्वेषी रुद्वाराधन तत्परः॥**

 All these are very important and significant points furnishing necessary clues to understandboth the texts in their proper light, and we cannot afford to wait here for giving fuller explanations for them at this stage. It has to be noticed however that the subsequent explanations will be entirely based upon these; and the best evidence for our conviction would be the proof that interpretations of every part of the texts in the light of these clues, would besufficiently reasonable, consistent and easy of understanding besides positively furnishing very valuable and useful informations. Whereas, it is perhaps necessary to reiterate that the modern interpretations will seldom comply with any of these facts. No two consistent ideas could ever be discovered nor any rational, useful or ennobling conclusions arrived at by the learned method in vogue. And yet

'Brutus is an honorable man'.

 **13.** We must content ourselves with the foregoing paras of this chapter in the prefatory explanations given for the treatment of both the Epics in question. Consistent with the logical order obtained in the enquiry, we have to commence with the Maha-Bharata as the nearest approachable subject to be attempted with our present qualifications. We have already found that we are given a place within the Bharata-varsha only as a matter of grace, since the majority of us have no privilege of entry under the existing conditions of our religious bankruptcy. We are again similarly allowed the privilege of living in the first quarter or Pratama-pada of Kali just after the Dwapara yuga, meaning thereby that we are not placed far from the external boundary of Karma-yoga. The religiously inclined modern progeny of our ancient and venerablə Rishis are offered a chance as their birth-right, to try a narch into the religious realms kindly provided by them.

We are in fact permitted to act out the Maha-Bharata if we will. Mankind in general are always acting out the Bharata or drama as it ordinarily means. That the world is a stage and each individual anactor in it, is a common idea familiar to all civilized nations. But the performance of our parts in this tirteand hopeless drama could secure no religious credit. The wise and thoughtful soon get satiated and feel ashamed of the constant repetition of exactly the same and profitless transactions day after day.

**तमेव भुक्तविरसं व्यापारौघं पुनः पुनः।  
दिवसे दिवसे कुर्वन् प्राज्ञःकस्मान्नलज्जते।  
पुनर्दिनं पुनारात्रिः पुनः कार्यपरम्परा।  
पुनः पुनरहं मन्ये प्राज्ञस्येयं विडम्बना॥**

**ज्ञानवासिष्ठम्॥**

   "The day follws night and night follows day carrying with them their dull routine to the entire disgust of the discerning."

  The Maha-Bharata however is a more serious drama, demanding special qualifications, tact and exertions for its creditable performance.

**महत्वात्भारवत्वाच्च महाभारतमुच्यते।  
निरुक्तमस्य यो वेद सर्वपापैः प्रमुच्यते॥**

**भरतानां महज्जन्म महाभारतमुच्यते।  
निरुक्तमस्य यो वेद सर्वपापैः प्रमुच्यते॥**

**महाभारतं आदिपर्व॥**

 "Greatness and toilsomeness characterise the Maha-Bharata. It deals with the rise of the great Bharatas or actors. Such is its root meaning."

 The origin and significance of its author known as Vyasa, by name, Krishna-Dwipayana deserves a detailed

enquiry here. He is described as a Rishi appearing in every Dwapara-yuga to divide the single Veda into four parts and analyse the same as well as to recompose the Puranas and Itihasas.

**एकवेदस्य चाज्ञानात् वेदास्ते बहवः कृताः॥**

**अष्ठादशपुराणानि कृत्वा सत्यवती सुतः।  
भारताख्यानमतुलं चक्रे तदुपबृंहितम्।  
मन्वन्तरेषु सर्वेषु द्वापरे द्वापरे युगे।  
प्रादुःकरोति धर्मार्थी पुराणानि यथा विधि।  
द्वापरे द्वापरे विष्णुर्व्यासरूपेण सर्वदा।  
वेदमेकं स बहुधा कुरुते हितकाम्यया॥  
भेदोव्यास इत्यर्थः॥**

 The word Dwapara has a double meaning even in ordinary language.

**द्वापरौयुगसंशयौ॥ इत्यमरः॥**

 Thus, when matters are in doubt, one who analyses and decides is a Vyasa. From these explanations we can easily understand that what is meant here is, that one should become a Vyasa first to have the Maha-Bharata done or kritom. A theoretical knowledge of all that is attributed to Vyasashould be obtained before commencing the performance of the Great drama.

 In the Maha-Bharata, Vyasa is described as virtually the grandfather of the Pandavas and kurus. The whole family is more or less connected with him in spite of his being a Rishi himself.

**परावरज्ञो ब्रह्मर्षिः कविः सत्यव्रतश्शुचिः।  
यः पाण्डुं धृतराष्ट्रञ्च विदुरञ्चाप्यजीजनत्।

 Southi and the Sounakas directly, and Vysampayana and Janameyaya indirectly are thus the only personages.

connected with our text. Such curious descriptions of compositions as well as narrations are surely uncommon in modern historical treatises, nor in the composition of the Ramayana, which is ordinarily understood as the work ofValmiki. But when you dive deeper, you may find more serious difficulties in the Ramayana too. All the Puranas as well as the Maha-Bharata are narrated by Suta to Sounaka and other residents of the Nimisa forest**.;**the Ramayana alone is not so narrated to any particular persons.The significance of Suta and his audience may be examinedlater on, as it would then be more easy to catch the correct application of the terms.

 Vyasa after dividing the single Veda into four parts by his penance, composed (chakray or did ) the Maha-Bharata in the following manner. He sat lonely in asacred spot and practised yoga and discovered internally the facts enumerated below. When all the worldly ideas and notions were annihilated by him and reduced to complete nonentity, the light of the Bramhan, **ज्योतिर्ब्रह्मसनातनं सदसदात्मकं** or the sakalanishkalam) in the form of a Divine egg originated. This clearly means that all round the idea of pure space there was nothing but divine light. From this egg, Bramha the creator of gnana arose. The descending spiritual agents or original causes, the five subtle elements, time and the 33 crores of Devas and all else in their pure state, unmixed and uncontaminated appeared in the vision of the yogi. Coming further down in this divine evolution, the soorya and soma vamsas descending from sahasra-jyotis or thousand lights connected with the creation of the pure Elements, their spheres and the methods of attaining to them by yoga and gnana, were discovered.

**भूयस्ततो दशगुणाःसहस्रज्योतिषः सुताः।

 This is exactly the summary of the text in the order given.    
  

**इह सर्वमनुक्रान्तमुक्तं ग्रन्थस्य लक्षणम्॥**

 The Maha-Bharata is a complete treatise on Artha-Sastra, Dharma-sastra and Kama-sastra, and it furnishes full instructions for practically working out the processes detailed.

**क्रियागुणानां सर्वेषामिदमाख्यानमाश्रयः॥**

 The Maha-Bharata serves as the foundation for all the religious anecdotes in the world and it is as indispensable as food to the physical body.

**  ** **14.**  We have had enough of quotations from the Maha-Bharata as well as other texts, to furnish us with some clear idea as to what we are about. The geographical details specified in the Maha-Bharata as the important scenes of action demand an enquiry and they are in themselves likely to enlighten us on the subject.The great battle of the Maha-Bharata, is known to every body as having taken place at Kuru-kshetra or Samanta-panchaka not far from or different from Hastinapura on the banks of the Jamna, and it is commonly understood as representing the exact spot to which the capital of the British Indian Empire has been recently removed. I have no doubt that we have by this time arrived at a stage at which enquiries about misinterpretations might be safely dispensed with,but it is necessary to examine minutely with a view to

secure more useful informations to understand the textcorrectly.

 The following passages refer to Kurukshetra most ofwhich have been already noticed in Chapter III.

 Kuruk-shetrom, Samanta-panchakom, Avimuktom,Varanasi and Maha-smasana all point to one locality, the Agna-chakra between the eye-brows which the yogis understand as the sixth chakra. The five below commences with Mooladhar at the bottom, Swadhishtana above it, then Manipoora, Anahata and Visudhi. These five represent the plexus at which the Tan-matras or subtle elements in their unmixed state are meditated upon. The sixth one is said to be the seat of pure mind where all the complex evolutions below are destroyed and & little gnana (आ + ज्ञा) or real

knowledge is obtained, and hence called Kshetra and MahaSmasana.

**क्षीयते पातकं यत्र तेनेदं क्षेत्रमुच्यते॥**

**महान्त्यपि च भूतानि प्रलये समुपस्थिते।  
शेरतेत्र शवा भूत्वा श्मशानन्तु ततो महत्॥**

 Being the sphere of pure mind, it is described as the seat of the moon.

**हिमकरसदृशम्।पूर्णचन्द्रस्य मण्डलम्।**

 This is the terminus of Karma-yoga in its higher philosophical sense, and the processes prescribed for its practice are appropriately described as connected with the Soma-vamsa. Theterm Samantha-panchakom as explained in the Maha-Bharata itself refers to the place close to the five bloody pools dug up by Parasu-Rama.

**तेषां समीपे यो देशो ह्रदानां रुधिराम्भसाम्।  
समन्तपञ्चकमिति पुण्यं तत्परिकीर्तितम्॥**

  After destroying all the kshetrias in the world, at the juncture of the Treta and Dwapara yugas, he filled these five pools with their blood and with which he offered libations to his Pitris or deceased ancestors. The significance of Parasu-Rama and of the well-known story about his destruction of all the kshatriya rulers in the world with a vengeance, could be easily understood from the passage under reference. The juncture of the Treta and Dwapara specified shows that Soma-vamsa begins with and belongs to the Dwapara yuga. The expression in the quotation, when correctly interpreted, clearly means all earthly, physical or material forms and notions; and when all these are destroyed by Parasu-Rama, the Soma-vamsa originates.

 There is hardly any difficulty now to understand that all the yogic processes employed in the five chakras above referred to, are described as the use of his heavy axe with great force, for the destruction of the innumerable ideas of materiality which domineer over the poor worldly man.

 The libations offered by him to the Pitris with the blood in the five pools, point to the same fact, as the term Pitris has been already explained in the preceding chapter as referring to the Tanmatras or Subtle elements, the original source, Pitris or Fathers of all material objects.

 The importance of Parasu-Rama's avatar, thus virtually extends only to this stage, but continuing a little in the Soma-vamsa, becomes entirely extinct in the Soorya-vamsa, in the Treta-yuga, when he is totally vanquished by SriRama. More of this shall be detailed in dealing with the Ramayana.

 The Aagna-chakra, the seat of Pure mind is described as a lotus with two petals signifying the duality of idea, the still existing difference of the Jivatma and Paramatma, maintained in the treatment of the Soma-vamsa throughout the Maha-Bharata.

**एतत्पत्मान्तराले निवसति च मनस्सूक्ष्मरूपं प्रसिद्धम्॥  
पत्रद्वयसमायुक्तं पूर्णचन्द्रस्य मण्डलम्॥**

 The explanation of the well-known synonymous name, Hastina-pura may be conveniently disposed of here.

 Hasti means an elephant and na, not. The place at which the Elephant is destroyed is Hastina-pura.

**सोमस्य दर्शनाज्जातः सोमाख्यः स बभूव ह।  
सोरण्ये जाह्नवीतीरे चकार तप उत्तमम्।  
एतस्मिन् समये तत्र कश्चिद्धस्ती समाययौ।  
निहतःपक्षिभिस्तत्र तद्दृष्ट्वा कौतुकं महत्।**

**सोमो विचारयामास पक्षिभिर्निहतः करी।  
अस्याभूम्याः प्रभावोयं पुरं तत्र चकार सः।  
हस्तिनाशात्पुरं जातं तस्मात्तद्धस्तिना पुरम्॥**

**आनन्दरामायणम्॥**

 The elephant isgenerally pitched upon in texts to illustrate the brute force with which the worldly desires drag man out of his righteous path and throw him into the bottomless abyss.

**Vide. ज्ञानवासिष्टम्॥**

**रामेच्छानाम करिणी सेदं मेऽस्त्विति रूपिणी।  
शरीरकानने मत्ता विविधोल्लास कारिणी।  
मत्तेन्द्रियोग्रकलभा रसनाफलभाषिणी।  
मनोहिनसंलीना कर्मदन्तद्वयान्विता।  
मदोऽस्य वासनाव्यूहः सर्वतः प्रसरद्वपुः।  
इच्छानागी निहन्त्येषा कृपणान् जीवसञ्चयान्।  
संसारदृष्टयो राम तस्याःसमरभूमयः।**  
**भूयो यत्रानुभवति नरो जयपराजयौ।  
इच्छाविच्छुरितो जीवो विजाति न दीनताम्।**

 'The human desire is described in the form of an elephant, with its double tusks of karmas, and intoxicated by old Vasnas, as roaming about in the forest of physical body and concealing itself in the cavity of mind as well as fighting out battles in the field of worldly affairs. It subjects every unthinking individual to its own sway and ever keeps him in distress'.

 Our scene of action is far different from that of this dangerous Elephant. The bittle is to be fought at Hastina-pura where this huge elephant finds itself destroyed. The kurus and Pandavas have to measure their swords and clubs and exchange their arrows at Samanta-panchakom,

the sixth battlefield, five battles having to be won previously and the blood of the enemies killed, offered as libations to our real ancestors, the original Pitris. It is the holy land of Kuru-kshetra lying wide and free between the great Ganges and Jumna.

**गङ्गायमुनयोर्मध्ये कुरुक्षेत्र इति स्मृतः॥**

 One has to pass beyond the Pratama-pada or first quarter of Kali, the period assigned by the ancient Rishis for the religious Hindus of the modern day, until he reaches the very verge of Dwapara, for admission into the sacred battle-field of Kuru-kshetra to partake of the fight between the Kurus and the Pandavas described in the Maha-Bharata.

**अन्तरे चैवसम्प्राप्ते कलिद्वापरयोरभूत्।  
समन्तपञ्चके युद्धं कुरुपाण्डव सेनयोः॥**

 **18.** Akshohinis or regimental forces are said to have assembled at the spot on both sides together, and all of them mutually destroyed. The account of theforces and their numerical details are noted below.

**तस्मिन् परमधर्मिष्ठे देशे भूदोषवर्जिते।  
अष्टादशसमाजग्मुरक्षौहिण्यो युयुत्सया।  
समेत्य तं द्विजास्ताश्च तत्रैव निधनं गताः।  
एको रथो गजश्चैको नराः पञ्च पदातयः।  
त्रयश्च तुरगास्तज्ञैः पत्तिरित्यभिधीयते।

स्मृतास्तिस्रस्तु वाहिन्यः पृतनेति विचक्षणैः।  
चमूस्तु पृतानास्तिस्रस्तिस्रश्चम्वस्त्वनीकिनी।  
अनीकीनीं दशगुणां प्राहुरक्षौहिणीं बुधाः॥**

**आदिपर्व॥**

 One car, one Elephant, five men and three horses make one Pathi, 3 Pathis make one Sena-mukhom, 3 times the same 1 Gunma, 3 Gunmas 1 Gana, 3 Ganas 1 Vahini, 3 Vahinis 1 Prithana, 3 Prithanas 1 chamu, 3 chamus 1 Anikini and 10 Anikinis equal to 1 Akshowhini.

 The account of a Pathi here given, whose multiples by 3 except the last, make up the others, will show clearly that the description does not refer to a real army. The term Akshowhini literally means the assemblage or congregation of sensations and the total number 18 probably signifies the 8 Prakritis and 10 Indrias. All these are required to be completely destroyed in the holy battle.

 It may not be considered out of place here to notice. again for the sake of convenient reference, a few more geographical details closely connected with the important scenes described in the Maha-Bharata. For instance, the towns called Mathura and Dwaraka, the forest of Brindavan, the Govardan mountain, the Jumna river &c are particularly associated with Sri-Krishna. Those of minor importance may be dealt with as they appear in the course of this essay.

 Mathura, the most important nativity of Sri-krishna is described as a lotus of 1000 petals, the spot at which the essence of all created things is extracted and reduced to the original form of their primeval cause.

**सहस्रपत्रकमलाकारं माथुरमण्डलम्।  
मथ्यते तु जगत्सर्वं ब्रह्मज्ञानेन येन वा।  
मत्सारभूतं यद्यत्स्यात् मथुरा सा निगद्यते॥**

 It is thus located far away from the Kuru-kshetra in the thousand petalled lotus of the Heart.

**अपश्यन्मथुरामेषां हृदयांभोज कल्पितां।  
हरेर्भगवतः साक्षादाविर्भावस्थली हि सा॥**

**वायुपुराणम्॥**

 Dwaraka is that spot which has various paths open all round for Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha.

**चतुर्णामपि वर्गाणां यत्र द्वाराणि सर्वतः॥**

 The passage quoted below clearly explains that 21 Prakritis aredescribed as representing 10 Villages, 10 forests and 1 mountain, and as situated at a distance of one Yojana each.

**एकविंशप्रकृतयो योजने योजने स्मृताः।  
इन्द्रियप्रकृतीनाञ्चदशानां ग्राम तद्दश।  
मात्राभूतदशभ्यश्च प्रकृतिभ्यः समुत्भवम्।  
तथा दशवनं रम्यम्।  
मनसः प्रकृतेर्जातो गिरि र्गोवर्द्धनो महान्॥**

 The 10 Villages from the Indrias are ; Gokul, Varsh. abha, Nanda, Bhandera, Mathura, Vraja, Yamuna, Manya, Sreyaska and Gopika. The 10 forests from the Elementals are; Brinda-vana, Gopa-vana, Bahula-vana, Madhu-sringa, Kunja-vana Vana, Dedhi-vana Mahakrida-vana, Remya-vana and Venupadma-vana.

 The Govardhan mountain represents the Pakriti of pure mind, the word literally meaning, that which increases or develops light or Go.

 Brindavana itself is a divine forest originating from pure light, situated above the Bramhanda or the cosmological conception of man, and on the banks of the Kalindi river which represents the Sushumna nadi, within which the Elements and the Devas reside in their subtle-forms.

**तज्योत्स्नाभिः समुत्भूतं दिव्यं बृन्दावनं शुभम्।  
नित्यं बृन्दावनं नाम ब्रह्माण्डोपरि संस्थितम्।  
कालिन्दीयं सुषुम्नाया परमामृतवाहिनी।  
यत्र देवाश्चभूतानि वर्तन्ते सूक्ष्मरूपतः॥**

 The spot described here is made up of pure light and isinvisible to mortal eyes.

**तेजोमयमिदं स्थानम्अदृश्यं चर्मचक्षुषाम्।**

 The residents of Mathura and Dwaraka, both males and females are stated to be more honorable than the Devas themselves, and unlike other human beings, all of them are gifted with four hands.

**मथुरावासिनो धन्या मान्या अपि दिवौकसाम्।  
अगण्यमहिमानस्ते सर्व एव चतुर्भुजाः।  
द्वारकावासिनस्सर्वे नरा नार्यश्चतुर्भुजाः॥**

 The river Narmada mentioned in the texts represents the Ida-nadi, the sakti of Sankara whose help should be sought to get over the ocean of Samsara,.

**इयं हि शाङ्करी शक्तिः कला शम्भोः इलाह्वया।  
नर्मदा दुरितध्वंसकारिणी भवतारिणी॥**

 The waters of the great Ganga represents Vishnu, Sudha-vidya and Sudha-Dharma, and the river itself is manufactured by Sankara from the essence of Upanishats treating of yoga.

**योसौ निरञ्जनो देवः चित्स्वरूपी जनार्दनः।  
स एव द्रवरूपेण गंगांभो नात्र संशयः।  
शुद्धविद्यास्वरूपा च त्रिशक्तिःकरुणात्मिका।

कृपया सर्वजन्तूनां चकार सरितां वराम्॥**

 15.We have examined in the preceding para the necessary geographical details immediately conected with the treament of the Maha-bharata and have more or less understood what are represented by Kurukshetra, Mathura, Dwaraka, Brindavana, Govardhana, Yamuna, Narmada, Ganga &c. In the face of such unambiguous and explicitdefinitions furnished in the texts, it has only to be pitied that a necessity has unfortunately arisen by our present degeneration, for explaining the mere technical meanings of terms used throughout, almost as new discoveries of the modern era. Such being the lamentable fate of the interpretations of the definitions of terms themselves, comments are certainly superfluous on the correctness of the current expositions of the valuable contents of the sacred texts. The reason is not far to seek for the present complete ignorance of the subject altogether. We are by this time fully convinced that the Maha-bharata treats of

Karma-yoga detailing the processes of working for its attainment. As such the text was practically known all along, only to the Raja-Rishis and never to the Panditclasses whose sphere is limited to the study of sanskrit literature. The absence of Raja-Rishis for any long period must therefore naturally result in the loss of its knowledge. Vide Bhagavat-Gita.

**एवं परम्पराप्राप्तमिमं राजर्षयो विदुः।  
स कालेनेह महता योगो नष्टः परन्तप।  
स एवायं मया तेद्य योगःप्रोतःपुरातनः॥**

 "Yoga was known to the Raja-rishis from generation to generation, which by a long interval of ignorance is now totally lost to the world. It is therefore the very yoga of old that is now preached to you."

 We cannot in the least afford to mis-understand at this stage, the application of the term Raja-rishi as used above. We have thoroughly sifted its meaning in Chapter III, Section III.

**मानवे वैषये वंशे ऐडवंशे च ये नृपाः।  
ऐडा ऐक्षाकनाभागा ज्ञेया राजर्षयस्तु ते।  
ऋषन्ति रञ्चनाद्यस्मात् प्रजाःराजर्षयस्ततः।  
इन्द्रलोकप्रतिष्टास्तु सर्वे राजर्षयो मताः॥**

**अव्यक्तात्मा महान्तात्माहंकारात्मा तथैव च।  
भूतात्मा चेन्द्रियात्मा च तेषां तद्ज्ञानमुच्यते।  
इत्येवमृषिजात्यस्तु पञ्चधा नाम विश्रुताः॥  
पितामाताप्रजैत एव मन एव पितावाङ्माताप्राणःप्रजा॥**

 The Raja-Rishis are those who conciliate or gratify their subjects or prajas and lead them to the Bramhan. They originate from the Manu's families of Soorya and  
Soma vamsas. Manu has been defined already as pure manas or mind.

**प्राणो दक्षस्तु विज्ञेयः संकल्पो मनुरुच्यते।**

 The Prajas are Prana**;** **प्राणः प्रजा।**The Raja-Rishis thus represent the various states of purity of mind acquired by winning over the senses and leading to the path of Bramhan. The five castes of Rishis specified referring to the knowledge of sensations, Elements, Egoism, intellect and Avyakta respectively make the matter more distinct and clearer. Besides, the Raja-Rishis are said to reside in Indra-loka.

**इन्द्रलोकप्रतिष्ठास्तु सर्वे राजर्षयो मताः॥**

 All possible doubts as to the entire absence of their connection with earthly affairs, are thus completely removed. From the detailed examination of the foregoing points, we can now safely arrive at the conclusion, that for the practice of Karma-youga in its higher sense, we must attain to the status of the Raja-Rishis as described in the Maha-bharata, whose real contents are therefore the practical instructions furnished for the purpose in view, not by actual historical illustrations or examples, but by distinct explanations conveyed by the descriptions in the well-established Puranic style observed and followed strictly in all the religious texts alike.

 Besides the general outline of the contents of the Maha-bharata, we have now understoodthe proper significance of the important geographical centres and of the periods of historical incidents specified all-through. It only remains to be seen how the chief actors or dramatic personnel are formed or composed.

 A few prominent names and leading characters may be dealt with in the beginning with the necessary explanations with a view to grasp their correct applications in the treatment of the subject.

 The text itself enumerates them plainly and explains their comparative importance. Vide Adi-parva.

**दुर्योधनो मन्युमयो महाद्रुमः  
कर्णः स्कन्धः शकुनिस्तस्य शाखाः।  
दुश्शासनःपुष्पफले समृद्धे  
मूलं राजा धृतराष्ट्रोऽमनीषी॥**

**युधिष्ठिरो धर्ममयो महाद्रुमः  
स्कन्धोऽर्जुनो भीमसेनोऽस्य शाखाः।  
माद्रीसुतौ पुष्पफले समृद्धे  
मूलं कृष्णो ब्रह्म च ब्राह्मणाश्च॥**

 Two trees of diametrically opposed nature are here described. The root of one is Dritarashtra the unthinking, and that of the other consists of Krishna, Bramhan and Bramhins. The trunk of one is made up of Duryodhana, the proud and wrathful, and that of the other is Yudhishtira, full of Dharma. Karna against Arjuna, Sakuni against Bhima and Dussasana against Nakula and Sahadeva, represent the stems, branches, flowers and fruits respectively of both the trees. The greatest prominence is doubtless given to Sri-krishna, and the addition of Bramhan and Bramhanas (knowers of Bramhan) has its clear philosophical significance, excluding the common idea of human history. A searching enquiry as to the meaning of this important Avatar or incarnation will not therefore be profitless. A full Purana, namely, srimat Bhagavata is devoted to the description of the glories of Sri-Krishna and even the ordinary readers of this text have somehow formed a vague impsession of its being particularly a philosophical and religious work, in spite of the stories it contains referring to the innumerable Gopis or females of the cow-herd class and Krishna's attachment to them. Throughout the Maha-

Bharata however, Sri-Krishna figures mostly as a high class diplomatist virtually partial to one side. Even in the preaching of the Gita, containing as it does many a formula and problem of Hindu philosophy, one cannotbut be surprised at the keynote running through the poem and which can be easily caught from the constant chorus, exhorting Arjuna to action rather than to inaction;

**तस्मादुत्तिष्ठ कौन्तेय युद्धाय कृतनिश्चयः।**

** "**Therefore prepare yourself to fight.**"**

 Sri-krishna's amorous love for the Gopis, his diplomatic policies and his teachings of high philosophy are irreconciliable contradictions in the sphere of human history, whatever might be the political, social or historical arguments invented to explain the texts in the light of the modern conception of their contents.

 The real significance of the concrete objects prescribed for the meditation of the Lord as Krishna**,** is clearly explained here in the text itself**,** without leaving the subject to the whims and caprices of the modern interpreters**.** The general Hindu public is at present mistaken only in the belief that the Pandit classes have stulied the texts**.** They could have ere this found out the correct meanings for themselves**,** had it not been for the disgraceful and false pretensions of these time-barred religious authorities in the land**.**

** "**Nanda refers to divine bliss and Yesoda to the mistress of liberation**,** or the invulnerable Mayawhich is of three kinds**,** namely**,** Satwa**,** Reja and Tama**.**Rudra is Satwic**,**

Bramha and the devotees are Rajasic and the Dythyas are Tamasic**.** Devaki represents the daughter of Bramha celebrated in the Vedas**.** Vasudeva refers to the Vedas themselves**.** Krishna and Rama allude to the subject of the Vedas**.** The Gopis and the cows represent the hymns in the Vedas**,** and Bramha is their support**.** The Vamsa is Rudra and the eminence is Indra**.** The cow is Deva**.** Gokula is the forest of Vykuntha and the trees allude to the devotees**.** The Dythyas represent avarice**,** anger & etc**,** The Kali stands condemned**.** Krishna is the eternal Braman itself**,** appearing in the form of Maya as a Gopa**.** Sesha or Ananta is Bala-Rama, 16008 Gopis are also the forms of Bramhan representing the various Rics or hymns in the Vedas**.**

 Chanura-mulla is hatred**,** Mushtika is jealousy**,** Kuvalayapida is pride**,** the bird Boka is arrogance**.** Mother Rohini is sympathy and Satyabhama is Dhara the earth or support**.** Aghasura is the great disease and Komsa is the king Kali**.** Mitra and Sudama represent the quality named Sama**;** Satya**,** Akrura and Udhava denote Dema**.** The conch alludes to the forms of Vishnu and Lakshmi**,** having originated from the ocean of milk with the sound of the clouds**.** Krishna's boyish play in breaking the milk-pans alludes to his sports in the milky ocean with the object of  
destroying the wicked and protecting the religious**.** The disc represents Bramha as creator**.** Jayanti represents air and the fan denotes Dharma**.** The flashing sword is Maheswara**.** The mortar is Kasyapa and the rope is mother Aditi**.** The disc and conch stand for Sidhi and Bindu**,** the forms of the Almighty that are adored**.** The mace denotes the power of time to destroy the enemies**.** The bow represents Maya**.** The autumnal season denotes enjoyment**.** The lotus in the hand represents the seed of Jagat**.** Vatabhandira represents Geruda and Sudama is Narada.

 It would be sheer waste of timeto repeat the words of the quotation here. Every technical term usedis explained as clearly as any human language can afford**.** The Upanishad quotedis one included in the well-knowngroup of 103 Upanishads extremely sacredto the religious Hindu**.** The foreign critic alone has therefore the privilege of condemning it as a later interpolation containing plenty of mischievous anachronisms. Tao Pandit will doubtless be surprised to find that most of the important personalities**,**times and places connectel with the story of Sri-Krishna are explained in the plainest and simplest terms**,** as having sensible and relevant**,** philosophical significance**.** Vykuntha in its entirety is said to be brought down to the Bhumi for the use of the residents of Swarga**.**

**भूमावुत्तारितं सर्वे वैकुण्ठं स्वर्गवासिनाम्।**

 The Bhumi here does not refer to this material earth but alludes to the Saptabhumikas explained in Chapter III**.**Swarga is also clearly defined in the Upanishads as refer ring to the steady meditation of the Sat or Atma**.** सत्संसर्गः स्वर्गः॥ The Pandit certainly does not understand the Upanishad correctly as required by the text itself**.** सर्वतीर्थफलं लभते य एवं वेद॥ He is no resident of the Swarga here mentioned and has no claim to the Bhumi specified**.** He ought not therefore to take in vain the name of Krishna

and those of the divine accessories here enumerated**.** As to the historical periodof the Paranas**,** the Pandit doubtless is at one with the critic**;** in fact he has been virtually his misleading agent**.** Instead of condemning the contents of the Upanishadas anachronisms**,** the Pandit would however**,**ingeniously explain them as prophecies made in the original Vedas**.** Besides**,** he is a strong advocate of the theory that**'**History repeats itself **'.** He sincerely and seriously expects an ancestor in his family who is said to have been deaf and blind**,** to be born in his own house**,** a few hundreds of years hence**,** exactly in the same form with his deaf ear and blind eye**.** He similarly believes**,** that besides Sri-Krishna**,** the humin qualities like anger**,** eavy**,** Sami and Dema**;** the periods of time like Kali and Dwapara**;** the implements like sword**,** mace**,** conch and disc**;** and even the Vedic hymns too**,** incarnate as human beings and animals**,** in Muttra in Upper India**,** at recurcing periods of time**.**L'here is howover no difficulty or trouble about his expectations and consequent explanations**.** He is completely crazy and extremely intrusive.

 The term Yogeswara constantly applied to Sri-Krishna is not without its special purpose or meaning**.** That is exactly the technical significance of Krishna in all the religious texts**.** He is the Lord or the spiritual basis for Karma-yoga as distinguished from Sankhya or Gnana-yoga**.**To our Vedantic Pandit all such distinctions are only too trivial to be noticed**.** His conception of Yoga itself refers but to his material prosperity and he stands far above the low religious plane**.** The Lord of the Pandit's Yoga is not therefore Sri-Krishna**,** but some rich merchant or land-lord**.** He is ever ready to raise him above the level of Krishna and Rama by his magnificent versification**,** for the purpose of securing his lucrative Yoga**.** He however forgets or rather does not know that Gnana and Moksha are not meant for creatures of his type**.**

 The quotation begins by exhorting us to understand that the Gopis represent the Vedas and their daughters the hymns**.** Krishna and Radha are said to represent Purusha and Prakriti without material forms**.** Krishna never leavesBrindavana**,** he has no fleshy body and is invisible owing to his brightness**.** Such is the description given in the text**,**but our venerable Pandit is not prepared to accept it**.** What is his position then as a Hindu cannot be easily determined**.**How he expects others to accept his veiws on the subject not corroborated by the text**,** and where again is the source from which he has gathered his unreasonable and preposterous ideas**,** are yet divine secrets to us**.** He is not however satisfied if he does not manufacture something wicked out of the sacred stuff**.** He must have these Gopis to represent a number of free women and krishna to shine as their paramour**.** The story is not relishing unless it is so vilified.

** "**The eternal Radha-krishna originated from the ever-lasting Bramhan**,** as a single figure**.** After a thousand yugas of tapas**,** it divided itself into Radha and krishna**.**They separately performed tapas for a thousand yugas and a light proceeded from the bodies of both**.** From that light

Bramhs then took to Samadhi in his heart and Hari appeared after hundreds of divine years and said thus**.** This is the Karma-bhumi of one thousand yojanas which creates and destroys the Jivas. It is bounded on the north by Himadri**,** on the east by Mahodedhi**,** on the west by Rutnakara and on the south by Bedavabdhi**.** This

Bhumi is eternal**,** the eternal lotus is within it and all the Lokas are above and below it**.** This Karma-bhumi represents the Vedas called also the cow**.** He who protects this cow or Go is a Gopa**,** and the power of protection is the same**.** Hari is adored by the Gopis**.** There are crores and crores of Gopas**,** the Kalas or glories of Hari **;** and there are also a corresponding number of Bramhandas known as Gopas**.** The Meru and the Khandas like Ilavrita mentioned do not actually exist**."**

 This gives a complete history of Radha and Krishna**,**Gopis and Gopas**,** Bramha and Rudra**,** Arjuna and Komsa**,**Purusha and Prakriti**,** Brindavana**,** Karma-bhumi and Bramhandas &c**.** A combination of all these together with their workings constitute the divine drama of Radha and Krishna for a thousand yugas**.**

**सहस्रयुगपर्यन्तं तेषां लीला बभूवह॥**

 The Karma-bhumi represents the Vedas and the cow and those who take care of the Vedas or Go**,** are Gopas**.**

**यस्तां पाति च भो ब्रह्मन् स गोपइति विश्रुतः॥**

 It is from within the lotus in the middle of this Karmabhumi that Bramha was born**.** The divine Brindavanas represents the mass of light that proceeded from Radha and Krishna**.**

**तज्योत्स्नाभिः समुत्भूतंदिव्यं बृन्दावनं शुभम्॥**

 How does the Pandit make out this eternal and sacred Karma-bhumi**,** the nativity of Bramha to represent the Indian peninsula and the mass of divine light to be a small forest or town in India?

** **This quotation like the previous one is lengthy and important**.** It is full of technical instructions on the subject of Yoga**.** The foreign critic who is evidently earnest is

mistaken only owing to the want of correct information**.**But the criticisms of our indigenous apish imitator concealing his ignorance and displaying his prejudice bring him only to greater disrepute**.** He is a misguided product of western civilization**,** labouring under the false impression that self-degradation would please his foreign patron**.** He is already no respected personage in the land and would soon be discovered in his true colours by the enlightened foreigner who is then sure to give him his due**.** Leaving these two classes of critics for the present**,** we have only to deal with our venerable Pandit in this connection**.** He cannot afford to disrespect the sacred Puranas from which the above passages are quoted**.** Let him first remember that the three Lokas constantly mentioned in the religious literature do not refer to this earth and the sky above it**.**They represent something lying within the mass of light originating from the darkness of a Pralaya**.**

 The real import of this description is not far toseek**.** When all the human desires for material prosperity are completely destroyed**,** the light of knowledge will begin to shine**.**This is the stage at which true religion commences**.** The play of Radha and Krishna has to be performed in the Lokas by man himself**.** Every line**,** every word in thequotation is highly technical and extremely sacred**.** Let thePandit**,** if he is wise try to make proper use of theinstructions**,** instead of exhibiting his ignorance andirreverence in future**.** But if he is bent upon following anymisdirected inclinations**,** he is fully welcome to have hisown will**.**

**  "**For the purpose of blessing the Lokas and for establishing Dharma**,** Vishnu the creator**,** the Lord and the grandfather of all**,** incarnated in the family of Andhaka-Vrishnis as the progeny of Vasudeva and Devaki**."**

 The Lokas have by this time been sufficiently explained**.** The import of the families specified shall also be noticed soon**.**

***Q. No. IX.***

** "**The Bhagavan who is the Atma of Viswa and the friend of his devotees**,** incarnated in the mind of Vasudeva with a portion of his glory**.** The Lord appears satwic and white by his Maya**,** while engaged in the preservation of the three Lokas**.** He appears Rajasic and red for creation**,**Thamasic and black for destruction**."**

 These descriptions do not in any manner justify the Pandit**'**s conversion of religious philosophy into human history of ancient India**.**

**अस्यदग्द्धोदरस्यार्थे किं न कुर्वन्ति पण्डिताः।  
वानरीमिव वाग्देवीं नर्तयन्ति गृहे गृहे॥**

** 16.** The numerous passages quoted above abundantly prove that Sri-krishna represents**,** no deceased monarch of ancient history**,** no funny character of the children**'**s fable**,** no allegorical production of an imaginative

poet**,** but undoubtedly indicates the tangible and distinct glory of God directly dealing with the higher life of man**,**in leading him on to the highest goal. Sri krishna's blessings have to be invoked and secured by strenuous efforts**,**for man's escape from perdition and for his attainment of real prosperity**.** Sri-krishna is the Lord and Preceptor of Yoga**,** and Arjuna (the white or Satwic) is his qualified student ever ready for action in implicit obedience to his divine instructions**.**

**यत्र योगेश्वरः कृष्णो यत्र पार्थो धनुर्धरः।  
तत्र श्रीर्विजयो भूतिर्ध्रुवानीति र्मतिर्मम॥**

 The nature of the birth of Sri-Krishna as could be easily comprehended from the quotations**,** deserves special attention**.**The Lord is said to have appeared in the hearts of Devaki and Vasudeva who are clearly explained as representing, knowledge or Saraswathy and the four Vedas respectively**.**

**हृत्पत्मकोशाद्देवक्या हरिराविर्बभूवह।

 The various derivative meanings of the terms Krishna**,**Gopala**,** Kamsari and Radha are worth special attention**.**

 But in the definitions of Krishna and Radha in quotation 7**,** certain facts are particularly noteworthy**.** The derivation of the word Krishna connects itself with Arjuna and that of Radha specifies its application to the five Pranas or life-breaths which could be understood only by religious devotion**.** Quotation 5 describes Souri**,** father of Krishna as representing the five subtle Elements and therefore having no material form**,** and Krishna originating from him as equally formless**.** Quotation I refers to the mantra consisting of five parts or padas representing the five

subtle elements constituting the significance of Krishna**.**The mantra is said to be specially understood or attained by Chandra-dwaja**,** clearly pointing to the follower of Soma-vamsa or Karma-yoga**.** These few points picked up here from the quotations furnish certain definite and relevant ideas constantly hovering over the figure of Sri-krishna**.**

 The blue or black colour attributed to some of the Avatars or incarnations is explained in quotation 9**.** The idea of preservation is represented as Satwic and white**,** that of creation as Rajasic and red and that of destruction as Thamasic and dark**.** These distinctions clearly point out that the incarnations we have to deal with in both the Ramayana and the Maha Bharata**,**refer more particularly to the destruction of all the harassing material ideas and notions in man**,** to enable him to ascend to the higher sphere of divine creation and eternally to remain there in peaceful bliss**.**

**सत्वं त्रिलोकस्थितये स्वमायया बिभर्षि शुक्लं खलु वर्णमात्मनः।  
सर्गायरक्तं रज सोपबृंहितं कृष्णञ्चवर्णं तमसाजनात्यये॥**

 In the Saiva Purnas and Agamas**,** similar ideas of destruction and creation are expressed in the definition of Siva-Linga**.** Lim means destruction and ga creation**.** The eternal knowledge**,** light and bliss that arise after the complete destruction of the existing materiality**,** is Linga**.**

**लिङ्कारं लयमित्युक्तं गकारं सृष्टिरुच्यते।  
लयनादुदयं प्रोक्तं लिंगशब्दमुदीरितम्॥**

 The favourite Gopis of Sri-krishna numbering 16000**,**are clearly explained as referring to the various Upanishads treating of Bramhan**.** The Lord's presence in the house of every Gopi can be safely presumed**,** and He could therefore be easily discovered by securing the favour of any of the Gopis**.**

**गोपशाक्तिःस वै गोपो गोपीनामर्चको हरिः।  
गोप्यस्तु श्रुतयो ज्ञेया ऋचोवै गोपकन्यकाः।**

**अष्टावष्टसहस्त्रेद्वे शताधिक्य स्त्रियस्तथा।  
ऋचोपनिषदस्ता वै ब्रह्मरूपा ऋचस्त्रियः।  
व्रजस्त्रीजनसम्भूतः श्रुतिभ्यो ज्ञानसङ्गतः॥**

 Thus the story of the Gopis is too plain to be misunderstood if its meaning is only enquired into**.** It is sheer careless ignorance that leads to all unnecessary and blasphemous comments**.** Ordinary common sense is sufficient to notice that such a large number as 16 thousand Gopis could not be literally spoken of as the favourite women of any single person**.** The plea of exaggeration and mythical fancy is likely to be brought in here**.** But**,** where is the logic to presume that all the authors of these religious texts were so stupid as to narrate their stories in the manner criticised**,** and where is the proof for the belief that the critic is a wiser being and a greater authority on the subject? As a whole**,** such criticisms serve only to prove that even the boasted civilization of the current century is not entirely free from the occasional outbreaks of its previous barbarisms**.**

 The Maha-Bharata specifies that Sri-Krishna was born in the family of Andhaka-Vrishni**,** the general name being the Yadu-kula**,** a branch of the Soma-Vamsa**.**

**लोकोपकरणार्थाय प्रजज्ञेन्धकवृष्णिषु॥**

 The term Yadava is explained in the Niruktom as referring to human beings who have taken to the right path**,** having reverted from the wrong**,** with the help ofGurus or proper teachers**.**

**यमुउपरमे यम्यते नियम्यते आचार्येण अपथवृत्ताः।**

**इतियदवः॥**

 Andhaka and Vrishni refer to a similar idea**.** Vrishni points to light or knowledge**,** and Andhaka to the complete control of the organs**.**

**तिष्ठतो व्रजतो वापि यस्य चक्षुर्न्नदूरगम्।  
चतुष्पदां भुवं मुक्त्वा परिव्राडंध उच्यते॥**

 The common conception of Sri-Krishna is always as a boy in his playful mood**.** This no doubt denotes the delightful feelings the mind constantly enjoys in its acquirement of Yogic bliss**.**

**बालस्वरूपमित्यन्तं मनश्चक्रं निगद्यते।**

 The current popular idea of the birth of Sri-Krishna in Gokula**,** Vraja or cow-shed is based upon the different meanings of the word Go**.** In sanskrit Go applies to a ray of light**,** the organ of sense**,** moon &c**.,** as well as to a cow**.** The Lord's incarnation in a **'**lowly cattle shed**'** is not entirely a strange fact in other religions too**.** The cow or Pasu in ordinary language is metaphorically used to represent the dull and the stupid**.** In the Puranic language it includes all the material creation which always depend upon the mercy of Easwara or Pasu-pathy the Lord of Pasus**.** Vide Linga Puranom.

 The Vishayas consisting of 24 Tatwas are the Pasas or cords that keep man ever bound**.** The sensual objects or

Vishayas are so named as they bind him up if he steps into their places**.** He who cares for freedom should therefore keep aloof from them**.**

**स्वदेशे प्राप्तपुरुषं निबध्नन्ति वशीकृतम्।

 It is impossible for sanskrit or any other known language in the world to explain any idea in plainer terms**,**and any further difficulty in understanding such descriptions could only be attributed to the understanding itself**.**Sudama**,** Arjuna and Kamsa &c**,** and Lalita**,** Kubja and Poothana &c**.,** are described as the Satwic**,** Rajasic and Thamasic productions of Sri-Krishna and Radha respectively for their Divine play which extended to a period of one thousand years**.**

 The description of Goloka in quotation 7 cannot be passed over in this connection without special notice**.** When all the phenomenal notions of man are destroyed**,** a mass of light will appear**,** within which the three well-known religi-

ous worlds will be seen**.** Further above them**,** is situated the Goloka sustained by Easwara's Yoga and filled with Gopas and Gopis**.** When it is dissolved**,** Sri-Krishna remains alone**.** There are two Lokas below this**,** styled Vycuntha and Siva-loka to the right and left**.** Vycuntha contains Lakshmi and Narayana**,** and Siva-loka contains Siva and his attendants along with all other paraphernalia**.** Both of these Lokas when dissolved leave nothing behind them**.** In the centre of the Goloka there is a pleasant mass of eternal light which the Yogis always meditate upon and perceive by the eye of knowledge**.**

 We have already gone through more than sufficient points to enable us to comprehend the significance of Sri-Krishna**,** as could be gathered from the various texts quotedabove**.** The Lord**'**s intimate connection with yoga is visibly stamped everywhere**,** and the sphere of his action is located far above the mundane existence**.** The dramatic personnel consist of the best and worst qualities of man**,** whose mutual fight for the purpose of attaining salvation is guided by the rules of Yoya**,** enunciated in all the texts alike**,** in the recognised Puranic style**.**

 With regard to the different quotations given above treating of this important subject in question**,** it would naturally be considered a weakness**,** in the light of modern civilization**,** to omit noticing the recent archaeological discoveries and distinctions brought to light**,** concerning the Upanishadic and Puranic periods in the history of Indian literature**.** The first three quotations from the Upanishads clearly narrate the puranic stories of Sri-Krishna**,** but the recognised formulas of the Archaeologist must denounce them as later interpolations**.** At this rate**,** a good number of religious texts could be condemned in the same manner**,** but that is certainly no reason why we should not meet the question on the face. It would be dangerous to allow the possibility of a future attempt to subvert the whole matter by the alleged argument**.** With the existing conception of the contents of the religious texts**,** the Archaeologist is bound to acknowledge that the Puranas treat of human history even though they are pronounced**,** to be loaded with myths**,**

exaggerations or what not**.** The main object of this essay however**,** is to prove that this view is totally mistaken and to establish that the Puranas are closely related to the sacred vedas as practical commentaries to them**.** If the Archaeologist cannot afford to disprove this fact reasonably he must unavoidably give up his theory as irrelevant and inapplicable here**.** No scientist has the right to apply the formulas of his science beyond his proper jurisdiction**.**Under the present circumstances**,** the contents of our religious texts are virtually unknown materials to him and it is unjust and unsafe to try his uncertain experiments upon them**.** At any rate it is difficult to understand clearly**,**how the interest of the Archaeological science would suffer**,**if its professed votary does not trespass upon forbidden grounds in this manner**.** If he is still anxious to apply his weapon upon our religious texts**,** he would do well to study and understand them first**,** lest his important and innocent science be brought to disrepute on his account**.**

 **17.** Consistent with the general outline of this essay**,** we have perhaps been too long at the enquiry of Sri-Krishna**,** but we must not forget that the Lord is the central figure in the Bhagavata and the most important personage in the Maha-Bharata**.** It is therefore desirable to obtain if possible**,** a thorough knowledge of the import of this Avatar from the Bhagavata itself**,** as it will be admitted by all**,** to be the proper text for the required information**.** No theories of interpolation and no archaeological anachronisms could be conveniently brought forward here**.** The very name and idea of Sri-Krishna must have been originally obtained from this text**,** leaving aside for the time being the various Upanishads quoted above**,** forthe purpose of avoiding confusion of arguments in this connection**.** Plain misinterpretation innocently or arrogantly

put forward is the only kind of criticism that may have to be met**,** but the sanskrit grammar is too tough and the brains of the younger generation of modern India too discerning to be played with by the native Pandit or the foreign critic**.** It is surely high time to meet these classes boldly in the interest of the correct calculation of our assets**.**All errors in the miscalculation or undervaluation demand immediate rectification**,** lest we are pronounced penniless at last**.** We may however be compelled to beg of the foreign critics as well as those taking to their methods of criticism to be more patient and more enquiring**;** and there is yet hope that less trouble and more sympathy will be forthcoming from that quarter than from our own Pandits**.** One cannot but despair in the attempt to procure any kind of help from the local Pandits of the existing type**,** and it should indeed be considered very lucky if he is not forced to cry out **'**save me from my friends**'.** It is doubtless a great consolation that the texts in question are not now the exclusive property of this class**.** Printed books are now available and the sanskrit language is commonly understood**.** It is therefore very likely that the Pandit will sooner or later find himself exhibited in his true colours**.** But he may be certainly assured that there is every possibility of a profitable reconciliation and even a respectable welcome**,** if he could only make up his mind to divest himself of his unreasonable and fossilized prejudies**,** which have hitherto proved actually suicidal in their promulgation**.** The venerable Pandit is carnestly entreated to reconsider the following passages from the Srimat-Bhagavata**,** or to read and understand carefully if he sees them but for the first time**.**

 The 16 thousand favorite Gopis as well as the 8 royal womens of Sri-Krishna are all described as having been alike

blessed with ten sons each**;** at the same time**,** it is clearly stated that in spite of all their amorous coquetry**,** none of them was able to enjoy the Lord like a husband**.**

 Vide Srimat Bhagavata**,** Skanda 10**,** chapter 61**.**

 The description here given is not very difficult to understand**.** The ten sons for each woman clearly represent**,**the glory of Sri-Krishna lighting up the ten Indrias or organs of sense on account of the devotional meditation of the Lord**.** The failuro of the women to approach suffi-

ciently near so as to enjoy Him thoroughly shows that the Lord is neither ea sily knowable nor attainable**. यत्नो वाचो निवर्तन्ते अप्राप्य मनसा सह॥**

 Why should Archaeologists or Geologists worry themselves unnecessarily with such descriptions and why the Pandit venture**,** with his low cosmological conception**,** to pollute the sacred atmosphere of religious devotion?

 The subjoined passage from Skandha 12 chapter 3 particularly gives the warning that the stories narrated in the text concerning the various monarchs and the battles mutually fought until every one of them was destroyed**,**should not be literally understood as they have no reference to actual historical facts**.**These beautiful and grand descriptions are furnished only with the express object of elevating man from his gross materiality and supplying him with the real knowledge of the Eternal Krishna**.**

 May the Almighty grant better eyes and understanding to our Pandits and critics**,** when they condescend to look into the original texts**.** The following quotation from chapter 11 of the same Skandha**,** gives a detailed description of Karma-yoga to be practised by meditating upon the form of Sri Krishna**,** adorned with the divine implements and other accoutrements and accompained by necessary suitable attendants**.** The whole of it could be easily perceived

to be a most scientific dissertation on philosophical psychology in direct touch with the religious requirements of man in his advanced stage of devotion**.** To condemn such descriptions as mythological fables and archæological anachronisms or to extol the same as important and wonderful historical incidents which once took place in India**,** are nothing short of deep raving**.** Every line**,** nay**,** every word in the passage quoted below is full of philosophical thought**,**clearly exhibiting the intellectual capacity and the earnest research of the ancient Rishis**,** who have taken ample pains to enlighten their posterity in religious matters**,** by voluminous texts on the subject**.** The only possible means of repaying them gratefully for their trouble and loving sympathy**,** is by earnestly following their instructions to benefit ourselves in the direction pointed out**.** On the contrary**,** we are not even satisfied with being indifferent**,**but**,** would take to unqualified**,** unauthorised and uncalled  
for criticisms**,** without feelings of shame and hesitation**.** In the interest of modern civilisation at least**,** we are bound to be more reasonable and more earnest in dealing with such serious religious subjects**.** We have by this time unconsciously proved to the world at large**,** our inefficiency and incapacity to distinguish Religion and Philosophy from Mythology and Archæology**.** There is no use brooding over the past mistakes**.** Let us try in future to secure the consolation **"**All is well that ends well**."**

 Let us go through the meaning of the above passage with some sympathy and attention**."**Sounaka said**.**we are anxious to learn the Kriya-yoga**,** which demands the conception of limbs**,** implements and other accessories for the purpose of adoring the formless**.** Suta said**,** They are described in the Vedas and Tantras**,** and explained by great Rishis**.** The form of the formless can be conceived by creating the figure of Virat**.** It is made up of 9 Tatwas (namely Prakriti**,** Sutra**,** Mahat**,** Ahamkara and 5 subtle

elements) and 16 Vykarikas (consisting of 11 Indrias and 5 Elements) with the Chit or true light as their substratum**.** All these put together are known as the three divine worlds and the limbs of the Lord**,** as they are supported by Hims Among the ornaments the Koustubha gem represents in disguise the pure Jiva and its light the Srivatsa**.** The garland of wild flowers of various colours denotes Maya with different gunas**.** The yellow silk worn represents the Vedas and the holy thread the Pranava**.** The two earrings signify Saukhya and Yoga**.** The crown stands for Bramha-loka**,** and the lotus seat (referring to Ananta or Avyakrita combined with Dharma and gnana) denotes the divine earth**.** The life**,**breath refers to air**,** the conch to water**,** chakra to fire**,** the sword to sky**,** and the scabbard to Tamas**.** The bow and sarnga represent Time**,** the quiver**,** Karma and the arrows the Indrias**.** Akuti or mind in action is the charriot and it**.**shape is made up of subtle elements**.** The place of worship is the disc of the sun**,** the process of worship is the purification of the devotee**'**s mind and the annihilation of his sins**.**The lotus in the hand denotes the glories of God**.** The chamer and the fan signify Dharma and splendour**.** The white umbrella denotes the fearless region called Vykuntha. Geruda represents the three Vedas over whom Yegna or Vishnu rides**.** Lakshini is the chit or light of God and Vishwaksena the form for Tantric worship**.** Nanda and  
seven other door keepers represent the eight sidhis such as Anima &c.Vasudeva**,**Sankarshana**,**Pradyumna and Anirudha signify**,** Viswa**,** Tyjasa**,** Pragna and Turia states of Jiva**.** In these four states as well as in the functions attributed to the Tri-murtis**,** the essence of God underlying them should be meditated upon as their primeval cause without taking the effects into account**.** Sri-krishna**,** who is a friend of Arjuna**,**member of Vrishni-vamsa and destroyer of evil monarchs**,** and whose worship is here explained**,** is

invoked by His devoted dependants**.'** May He**,** whose glories are ever sung by the Gopis and Rishis like Narada**,** protect us**'."**

 An exactly similar passage may be quoted here for corroboration**,** from the Vishnu Purana before we close the history of Sri-Krishna in the interest of this essay**.**

**आत्मानमस्य जगतो निर्लेपमगुणामलम्।  
बिभर्ति कौस्तुभमणिस्वरूपं भगवान् हरिः।

 All the passages quoted above furnish the Puranic treatment of the Sabda-bramhan or Purana-purusha**,** capable of being meditated upon**,** without the admixture of material dross which falls under the category of objectionable Vishayas already explained**.** The form here detailed i

Sakala nishkala**,** the immaterial form of the formless**.** Where as**,** the popular mistake is that it is taken to refer to the material form**,** which actually finds no place within the sphere of our sacred religion**.** Even the idols prescribed for low intellects are explained as mere suggestions**.**लिङ्गंगमकमित्याहुः। Gamaka is an object used for suggestion**.** The number of hands introduced in a figure for instance has its specific reference to higher ideas**.**

**सत्वंरजस्तमइति अहङ्कारश्चतुर्भुजः।  
दशहस्ता दिशोदश।**

 Satwa**,** Raja**,** Tama and Ahamkara represent four hands meaning thereby that nothing below these pure Tatwas should be noticed in the meditation of the glory of God**.**The ten hands represent the ten quarters of the universe pointing to God**'**s omni- presence**.** The less the number ofTatwas utilized**,** the greater the qualification of the worshipper presumed**.** The Siva-linga without any specific form is therefore considered by Sivites as a higher and nobler object for worship**.** All ignorant criticisms against Hinduism as idolatry are therefore inapplicable and the philosophy of the whole affair is simple enough**.** All varieties of material forms are only the creations of our own mind which depends upon several Tatwas above it for its own existence and is doomed to be destroyed when the higher stages are reached**.**

**दृश्यते श्रूयते यद्यत्स्मर्यते वानरैस्सदा।  
असदेवहितत्सर्वे यथा स्वप्नोमनोरथः॥**

 We have already seen that even in the meditations combined with higher Tatwas**,** the Eternal Substratum is the prominent subject**.** In the everyday ritualistic ceremonies of our religion**,** these simple facts are clearly observable**.** With such fundamental principles for our hoary religion**,** the acceptance of human or animal forms literally

as incarnations**,** by dragging down the Lord to the lowest sphere of transient materiality**,** is certainly not Hindu Religion**,** but prohibited irreligion**.** There is not a single loop-hole left in any of the sacred texts for this egregious mistake and no amount of ignorance or perversion could upset truth**.** All the suggestions of modern Reformers for the Reorganisation of our oldest religion**,** based upon the current ideas of social and political salvation**,** as well as all the efforts to rationalise or glorify the same**,** by adding the wisdom of material science or the esoterisms of the white or black magics**,** are entirely beside the mark and thoroughly opposed to the very nature of the subject**.**

**दक्षिणां ककुभं पश्यन् कः प्राप्नोत्युत्तरां दिशम्॥**

 An inclination to study and understand is alone actually demanded**,** and it will soon supply us with sweet and agreeable food for our real sustenance and save us the unnecessary trouble of begging and borrowing**.**

**स्वगृहे पायसं त्यक्त्वा भिक्षामटति दुर्मतिः॥**

 **18. **We might conveniently stop here our enquiries about the correct significance of Sri-krishna from Upanishads**,** Puranas and Bhagavata**,** excepting the Maha-Bharata whose subsequent treatment will probably necessitate occasional references to the Lord**.** It pains me however very much in this connection**,** to have to repeat our old complaints against Theosophy purely in the anxious interest of our fast decaying religion**.** In the midst of utter local indifference for our religion and philosophy**,** it is really very unfortunate that the foreign creed appeared amongst us with their conglomerations of various religions to make confusion worse confounded**.** If the Theosophists connect themselves with every sort of religion in the world**,** as they

seemto profess**,** we cannot certainly divine why they have been displaying their love more partially towards Indian soil than to other parts of the world**.** The Hinduhas long been known for his religious faith and devotion**,** and his present religious ignorance coupled with his inherited devotional tendencies was probably taken advantage of**,** to propagate the westernised absurdities of Hinduism in India itself**,** as if the local degenerations were insufficient for the immediate ruin of the Hindu**.** They have doubtless trespassed too much upon our sacred religious sphere in their experiments to extract the essence of Hinduism along with that of other religions**.** It is therefore impossible to pass on without a word in our own behalf**,** to steer clear of all impending dangers**,** consciously or otherwise thrown across our proper route**.** It may however be assured that no attempt is here made to criticise their peculiar theories**,** but it must be positively stated that all their discoveries**,** in their sectarian method**,** concerning Hinduism**,**are entirely irrelevant and uncalled for**.** They have up to date furnished no tangible evidence of having known anything better than the mistaken local Pandit whose crude views they have simply embellished with their western notions of a curious kind**,** and made them more ridiculous and harmful**.** To be more specific**,** the Theosophists certainly take the Maha-Bharata and the Ramayana as actual human histories and deal with them in their usual confounding style**,** unnecessarily applying to them all sorts of irrelevant theories**.** In spite of the numberless books published by them in the English language**,** treating of their extractions from all quarters of the globe**,** it must be unhesitatingly confessed**,** that they have not been hitherto able to perceive the real contents of the Maha-Bharata or the Ramayana**.** Mrs Besant the living Theosophical authority is completely

blind even to their whereabouts**.** Like the venerable pandit of today**,** she really believes that Rama and Krishna were born in Ayodhya and Mathura in upper India and died like ordinary mankind**.** The birth of Sita from the furrowed ground and that of Drowpathy from the fire as well as all other similar incidents will probably be explained away**,** within the very narration of these human histories**,** in one stroke**,** by a single but grand word Esoterism**.** In her perplexed attempt to conceal the ignorance of the subject**,** she naturally forgets that if the stories were human histories**,** there would be no scope for her esoterisms as combined with exoterisms**.** In page 8**, '**Sri-Ramachandra**,** the ideal King**'** she writes**:-**

** "**The period of the world's history at which Ramachandra lived was the closing of the Treta Yuga**.** The history of the world-and indeed of any separate nation-is divided into four great periods**,** or yugas named respectively the Sattya**,** the Treta**,** the Dvapara**,** the Kali-Sri Rama ruled during the last part of the Treta Yuga**,** and when He passed away from earth the Dvapara yuga began**.** That Yuga**,** again**,** was closed by the coming of Sri-Krishna**,** and with His death was opened the Kali yuga**.** And what was Shri Rama? Not simply a great warrior**,** a mighty king**.** He was an Avatara**,** a divine incarnation and divine incarnation of a special kind**.** All men are divine incarnations**.''**

 Besides the clear notion expressed in the quotations regarding the births of Rama and Krishna as human beings on the surface of this mother earth**,** one noteworthy point is**,**that she has not the vaguest idea of what a Yuga means in our religious texts**.** We have dealt with the Yugas in detail in the preceding chapters and have found that they do not exist outside the limits of Bharata-varsha**.** Mrs

Besant is however anxious to grant the privilege of the Yugas to every nation in the world**.**

**चत्वारि भारते वर्षे युगानि कवयोब्रुवन्।  
कृतं त्रेता द्वापरञ्च कलिश्चान्यत्र न क्वचित्॥**

 Again in page 167 she writies,

**THE MAHA-BHARATA.**

**Adi-Parva.**

 **1.**The origin of Soota**.** The general distinguishing features of the Solar and Lunar dynasties**,** the main differences in the topics dealt with in the Maha-Bharata and the Ramayana**,** the characteristic functions of the Avatar of Sri Krishna as Yogeswara and His general significance as detailed in the Puranas and Bhagavatha**,** have all been already examined in the preceding chapter**.** It is high time now that we proceed straight with the story of the Maha-Bharata**,** and this chapter may be set apart for the purpose**.**

 In has been more than once observed in this essay**,** that excepting the Ramayana**,** all the 18 Puranas**,** and the same number of Upa-Puranas**,** as well as the Maha-Bharata**,** are said to have been narrated by Soota to the Rishis of the Nimisa Forest**,** but the import of this arrangement has not yet been explained**.** The following passages explain the origin of Soota**.**

**विप्रायांक्षत्रियाज्जातः सूत इत्युच्यते बुधैः।  
चौर्येणास्यात्मनेनोत्थो रथकार इति स्मृतः॥**

**स्कान्दपुराणं- सूतसंहिता॥**

 The first two quotations contain almost the same verses with slight modifications**.** The sacrificial rice prepared by Brihaspathy**,** the Deva-Guru**,** was touched or polluted by Indra**,** and when it was offered to the Fire**,** Soota originated**.**The story naturally represents exactly the same idea as Bramha kshetra already noticed in connection with the Soorya and Soma-vamsas Brihaspathy and Indra denote Bramha and Kshetra respectively**.** The import of the whole story is**,** that Sakala-nishkala**,** Purana-purusha or Bramha-kshetra is the subject dealt with by Soota in all the Puranas**.** In quotation 3**,** Soota is described as a caste produced by the progeny of a Bramhin woman by a kshetrya**.**

The profession of the caste thus became madhyama or middle one**,** namely that of a charioteer**.** The charioteer is the common metaphorical term used for Budhi or Intellect**,** and the Intellect which has been purified in the sacrificial fire above referred to**,** by the combination of Indra and Brihaspathy is alone capable of understanding the working of the Bramha-kshetra or Purana-Purusha**,** Aparatma or Sabda-Bramha**.** Soota is therefore personified as the narrator of all the Puranas which treat of this Saguna-nirguna Bramhan**.**

**यस्मिन् पुरा ह्यनन्तीदं पुराणं तेन वै स्मृतम्।  
निरुक्तमस्य यो वेद सर्वपापैः प्रमुच्यत॥**

**वायुपुराणम्॥**

 From the above quotations we see that two derivative meanings are assigned for the name**,** Nimsa Forest**.** A wheel was said to have been rolled on by Bramha**,** representing Dharma and Manas or mind**.** The place at which it fell and broke its **'**nemi**'** or spokes is named Nimisa**;** at this spot all the Danavas were destroyed in a nimisha or minute and hence also called Nimisa**.**

 In quotation 2 however**,** there are several important and vital points to be noticed in detail**.** The locality is said to be noted for several important events enumerated**,** and the very ingenious method of description given of those incidents**,** particularly specifies the Puranic style affording ample clues for understanding the significance of many a story in the religious texts**.** The incidents mentioned are the following**.** King Ila became a woman and a wife at this spot**.** The Devas performed a sacrifice for a thousand years here when Mrityu or Death performed **'**samitom**'**or the duty of killing the sacrificial beast**.** Here the River Gomati frequented by Sidhas and charanas**,** flows**.** Budha**,** the son of Rohini and Soma was born here**.** A hundred sons commencing with Sakti were born of Arundhati and Vasishta in the same place King Kanmashapada was cursed by Sakti here**.** It was here that Vasishta and Viswamitra quarrelled**.** Adrisyanti delivered Parasara here**.** Vasishita's ill fame was removed here**.** The Rishis of this Forest performed a sacrifice for 12 continued years here during the reign of Pururavas**,** the Emperor**.** The Nimisa also represents the very spot at which successive Bramhas are officially invested with authority to create the worlds**;** and all of them perform without fail**,** here**,** a sacrifice extending to a thousand years**,** before they enter their duty of creation**.**

**सिसृक्षमाणा विश्वं हि यत्र विश्वसृजः पुरा।  
सत्रं हि ईजिरे पुण्यं सहस्रं परिवत्सरान्।  
तपोग्रहपतिर्यत्र ब्रह्मा ब्रह्माभवत्स्वयम्॥**

 This part of the quotation postulating the existence of Nimisa Forest before the creation of the world by Bramha**,**must be sufficiently puzzling to the Pandit and the critic**,**the former cannot possibly explain the passage so as to conform to his usual method of interpretation and the latter cannot**,** without some difficulty established the same to be

an interpolation**,** especially as the supposed interpolators**,**namely the Pandits**,** are themselves in difficulty here**.**The Pandit has no go but to confess his ignorance of this special subject**.** The promulgators of the interpolation theory will be compelled to feel that they should soon change their weapon**,** if they are still anxious to criticise without a knowledge of the subject**.** At any rate**,** it must be here acknowledged that the passage in question is no known persons**'** mischievous interpolation**.** The fact is**,** that it is after all**,** only one of the numerous simple mistakes**,** inevitable in all matters**,** where pretention of knowledge is prominently urged forward**.** It is indeed a pity that the sacred sphere of our religion has somehow become the market place for the silly transactions of all possible varieties**.** The Purana**,** the history of the magnificent display of the Glories of Sabda-Bramhan**,** has been reduced to the level of the fabulous Stories of human beings and animals said to have existed in India in A**.** D**.** or B**.** C**.** With thisinterpretation**,** naturally**,** the Puranas in course of time**,**became fit subjects for unthinking Pandits to lecture upon**,**and old illiterate widows to listen to**.** More than this**,** the foreign critics innocently took them up as they found them**,**and began to draw their logical inferences in all possible directions**,** without knowing the real state of the local ignorance of the subject**.** Subsequently came in Theosophy which also understood the Puranas exactly in accordance with the indigenous misinterpretations and attempted to extract scientific theories from amidst them**,** by diluting**,**boiling or adding other chemicals to the putrified dross obtained**.** With its varied socalled scientific**,** esoteric and ecclectic processes**,** it has almost mutilated our religion**;** the necessity**,** the effect or the utility of which process**,**Theosophy itself is unable to understand or explain**.** With

these recent and curious historical incidents in our religious life**,** where are we now ?Can misfortune harass further ?

 Let us try our chance**,** with the help of the technical meanings of terms alrealy obtained**,** to arrive at some useful and correct interpretation**.** The Nimisa Forest is clearly specified as the spot at which**,** the wheel of Dharma or the wheel of mind gets destroyed**.**

**भ्रमतोधर्मचक्रस्य यत्र नेमिरशीर्यत।  
एतन्मनोमयं चक्रं मया सृष्टं विसृज्यते।  
यत्रास्य शीर्यते नेमिःसदेशस्तपसः शुभः॥**

 The passage doubtless refers to a purer and higher atmosphere than that of the ordinary phenomenal functions of the human mind**.** How successive Bramhas perform religious sacrifices at this spot before they create the Lokas**,**could be understood only by remembering the definition of Lokas noticed in the previous chapters**.**

**लोकार्थं सम्मतो लोकःनिरालोको बहिः स्मृतः॥**

 That which is admitted by the great**,** as worth seeing or finding out**,** is Loka**;** all outside is darkness**,** ignorance**.**

 We can here clearly percieve that neither the Nimisa Forest nor the Lokas mentioned in our religious texts**,**represent any geographical localities on this earthy sphere**,**and that consequently any historical descriptions given**,** will only similarly represent some ideas relevant to this apparent geography.

 The residents of the Nimisa Forest are said to have performed a sacrifice there extending to a period of twelve years**,** when Soota appeared before them to narrate all the Puranas**.** These events are mentioned as having taken place during the reign of the Emperor Purooravas**.** With the definition of Nimisa Forest above noticed**,** this historical description demands some careful enquiry to supply any

reasonable meaning**.** Purooravas ordinarily interpreted as a king of the Soma-vamsa could not help us in any useful manner**.**

**नैमिषे ईजिरे यत्र नैमिशेयास्ततः स्मृताः।  
तत्सत्रमभवत्तेषांसमाःद्वादश धीमतां।  
पुरूरवसि विक्रान्ते प्रशासति वसुन्धरां॥**

 The description of Nimisa Forest on the whole necessitates the logical presumption of the following facts**.**

 1**.**The Forest was in existence before the creation of the world by Bramha**.**

 2**.**The Rishis**,** for whose benefit Bramha originally pointed out the spot**,** by rolling on the wheel of mind**,** must have also existed before creation**.**

 3**.**The sacrifice mentioned and the reign of Purooraas as well as the narration of the Puranas by Soota must be similarly attributed to a period anterior to creation**.**

 It is hopeless to expect any reasonable explanation here**,**without clearly confessing that the residents of Nimisa known as Sounakas as well as king Purooravas**,** represent something difierent from the current ideas about them**.** The readers will particularly mark here**,** that there is not the slightest scope for the Pandit or critic**,** constituted as they are at present**,** to evade the difficulty or conceal the ignorance**.**

 An examination of the derivations of words as usual**,**will furnish the necessary clues**.** Nimisa has been found to refer to the destruction of mind as well as to that of the Danavas**,** signifying the annihilation of material desires and of the objective tendencies of mind**.** Sunakom means a slaughter-house and the above idea is repeated in the term Sounakas**,** representing the pure state of mind**,** extricated of all its impurities and fit to hear the Puranas treating of

the Glories of Sabda-Bramhan**,** as taught by Soota or puri**.**fied Intellect**.** We have yet to see the idea conveyed by the reign of Purooravas**.** Niruktom plainly explains this word-

 **मध्यमःस्तनयित्नुलक्षणं शब्दं करोतिपुरूरवाः विज्ञायते हि वाताः प्राणा एव पुरूरवा इति॥**

  Prana or life breath is meant by Puroorava**.**

**पुरूरवसि विक्रान्ते प्रशासति वसुन्धरां॥**

 When the body and mind are properly trained by the regulation of breath**,** in accordance with the teachings of Yoga**,** the qualification of a Sounaka is attained**;** and with the help of Soota**,** the Puranic instructions concerning the display of the glories of Sabda-Bramhan may be properly grasped**.** It may not be out of place in this connection to notice again a similar puzzling passage quoted in chapter I referring to the date of creation**.**

**चैत्रे मासि जगत् ब्रह्मा ससर्ज प्रथमेहनि।  
शुक्लपक्षे समग्रं वै तदा सूर्योदये सति।  
वत्सरादौ वसन्तादौ बलिराज्ये तथैव च॥**

** "**Bramha created the world at 6. A. M. on the first day of Chitra month of the first year, during the reign of Maha-Beli**."**

 Numerous descriptions of this sort are very common throughout the religious texts**,** and all of them will remain insoluble riddles as long as the obstinacy to close our eyes to the definition of terms is retained**.**

 The Jagat or the world here said to be created by Bramha could be clearly understood from the definition of Linga already examined**.**

**लिङ्कारंलयमित्युक्तंगकारं सृष्टिरुच्यते।  
लयनादुदयंप्रोक्तंलिङ्गशब्दमुदीरितम्॥**

 That which is created**,** after the destruction of the existing notions of materiality**,** is the only religious world**,**the Great Bramha would condescend to manufacture**.**

**ते अलोका महाप्राज्ञा नाशमायन्ति ये च वै ।  
सर्वदैव स्थिता ये च ये लोकाश्च सनातनाः॥**

 The details of time specified also refer to the very first commencement of all the items enumerated**,** excluding all old ones**.** The reign of the Emperor Beli**,** as on a previous occasion is surely another puzzle that has to be solved**.** In Puranic descriptious**,** Beli is mentioned as the grandson of the famous Prehlada**,** son of Hiranya kasipu**,** and belonging to the Asura family**.** The Asuras have been explained in the preceding pages as referring**,** to those eagerly seeking after worldly happiness and the Devas to those reverting from this path to that of knowledge or light**.**

**ततोस्य जघनात्पूर्वमसुरा जज्ञिरे सुताः।  
असुः प्राणः स्मृतो विप्रा स्तज्जन्मान स्ततोऽसुराः।  
धातुर्द्दिवीति यः प्रोक्तःक्रीडायां स विभाव्यते।  
तस्यां तन्वान्तु दिव्यायां जज्ञिरे तेन देवताः॥**

 The Asura family originated with two brothers described as the progeny of Kasyapa and Diti**,** named Hiranya-kasipu and Hiranya-aksha**.**

**पुत्रद्वयं दितिः सूते कश्यपान्मुनिपुङ्गवात्।  
हिरण्यकशिपुन्त्वेकं हिरण्याक्षमनन्तरम्॥**

 Hiranyom means gold or riches and kasipu**,** a pillow or bed**.** Hiranya-kasipu therefore naturally applies to a person who having acquired wealth is unwilling to spend**,**but clings to it with great attachment**.** The younger brother Hiranya-aksha is a poorer fool with his aksha or eyes ever in quest of money**.** The funny descriptions of these two brothers nearly exhaust the real differences generally

observable**,** between man and man**,** at all times in this material world**.** Here**,** the younger brother as he is does not deserve very respectablenotice**,** but the elder must be dealt with more seriously**.** That he is the main stay in all human affairs**,** social**,** commerical**,** political and to some extent even religious**,** could on no account be denied**.** He reigns supreme everywhere and at all times**,** but in the ordinary course of affairs**,**he is naturally and mostly inclined in the wrong directions**.** The reason for this may be easily traced to his parentage**.** He is the son of Diti by Kasyapa**.**The word Diti refers to separation rather than to union**;**Diti to cut or separate**.** Kasyapa**'**s another wife named Aditi**,**the mother of the Devas represents the opposite quality**.**Aditi means unbounded**,** free**.** The derivative meaning of Kasyapa itself is interesting**.** Niruktom explains the word as referring to the elements**. काश्यपः भूतांशः॥**

**कश्यं मद्यं स्मृतं विप्रैः कश्यपानात्तु काश्यपः।  
दक्षाभिशप्तः कुपितः कश्यपस्तेन सोऽभवत्॥**

**वायुपुराणम्॥**

 Kasyom is liquor and he who drank it is Kasyapa-Again **पश्यतीति कश्यपः।**That which becomes visible**.** All these definitions point to the descending scale of creation from Subtle to material**.**Prahlada**,** the son of Hiranya-kasipu is famous for his devotion to Vishnu**.** The name signifies great delight and contentment**.** When this state of mind is attained**,**Hiranyakasipu's life is in danger**.** The Asura is soon destroyed by NaraSinha or the Man-lion**,** by the boldest stroke ofHeroism. Virochana**,** the son of Prahlada denotes more enlightenment of the Intellect**.** Beli**,** his son again

represents still further strength of devotion**,** renunciation and resignation**.**

**   **The gradual progress of religious attainment is generally described in this fashion in the Puranas and Itihasas**,**and this method of treatment is not unusual even in ordinary Sanskrit literature**.** None need be surprised at this observation**.** It is no new invention**,**nor is there any occultism in it**.** A study of the literature will furnish the conviction**.**

** **Thus**,** the pedigree here given of the Asura family from Hiranya-kasipu to Beli**,** clearly defines the stages of religious development in the worldly man**,** from his grossest ideas and strongest desires to the most pious devotion and full-hearted resignation to the Supreme Being**.** In fact**,** the Asura completely loses his characteristic nature**,** when he rises to the status of Beli by the annihilation of all mundane affairs**.** And when the mightyemperor**,** Maha Beli Chakravarti**,** greater than even Indra**,** reigns supreme**,**the Great Bramha steps in to create bright**,** holy**,** religious and divine worlds for him and a completely fresh era of life to commence with**.**

**चैत्रेमासि जगत् ब्रह्मा ससर्ज प्रथमेहनि।**  
**शुक्लपक्षे समग्रं वै तदा सूर्योदये सति।**  
**वत्सरादौ वसन्तादौ बलिराज्ये तथैव च॥**

  ** 2.**The Enemies of God**.** From the detailed enquiry conducted in the previous chapter**,** we have clearly understood that Sri-Krishna represents the Lord of Yoga**,** and in the subsequent chapter**,**a similar enquiry will show what Sri-Rama signifies**.** In the mean-time**,** it is necessary to obtain some definite ideas of the chief adversaries of these two Avatars**,** before proceeding with the stories in the Maha-Bharata or Ramayana**,**

especially as they are also described to be the same personages in both the stories**,** only in changed form**,** like the Avatars themselves**.** Two divine attendants of Vishnu in Vykuntha**,** named Jaya and Vijaya are said to have been cursed by the great Rishis**,** Sanaka and his three brothers**,**to be born as Asuras three times and to die fighting with God as enemies**.** The Rishis pronounced this curse on them**,**having been enraged at the obstruction caused for their free entrance to the inner chamber of the Lord**.** Jaya and Vijaya had therefore successively to take the forms of Asuras called Hiranya-kasipu and Hiranya-aksha**;** Ravana and Kumbha-Karna**;** and Sisupala and Denta-vaktra**.** The incident that led to their repeated births to fight battles with the Avatars is described in various texts and is probably accepted as a proper historical reason by the Pandits and the Hindus in general**.** The theory of evolution**,** the law of karma andsuch other combinations of theories might proceed from Theosophical quarters for the required explanations**.** It must however be clearly remembered that the incident here noticed is the real basis for the Puranic stories in the Maha Bharata as well as the Ramayana**;** the opposed characters on either side being virtually the same in both**.**Thus there is no doubt**,** that so long as we wish to maintain our claim for sanity**,** such reappearance of exact characters could on no acount be established or presumed**,** in what is generally known as human history**.** It is somehow really very strange**,** that in matters of this kind**,** neither the old fashioned Fast nor the enlightened West could have the patience to wait and understand the texts**,** before criticisms are passed**,** explanations are offered or urgent inferences drawn**.**

 An examination of the internal evidence available may be conducted here as usual**.**

Sanaka with his three brothers to Vykuntha**.** The Rishispassed through six quadrangles and reached the Seventh adjoining the inner chamber of the Lord**,** where they found two guards possessing four hands**,** writing with mace in hand jewelled crown on the head**,** garland of wild flowers round the neck and looking furiously at the visitors**.** When the old Rishis who looked like children of five years of age came near**,** the two guards prevented them with their cane rods from advancing further**.** The Rishis remarked**"**you are foolish in retaining ideas of differentiations in your minds having been so long here in this sacred place**,"** and cursed them to be born where desire**,** anger and greed**,** the three great enemies dwell**.** Immediately both of them prostrated before the Rishis through fear and begged of them to add a blessing to the effect that however low they are born they may not lose their meditation of the Lord**.** The Lord also then appeared and said that they may immediately lose their divine nature and after attaining proper Samadhi through anger may return thither ere long**.**

** **It is this plain and ordinary incident that is said to have taken place in Vykuntha Loka**,** that lies at the very root of the compositions of the two great Epics**.** The veracity of the incident or its close relation to the stories in the texts have not fortunately been questioned hitherto**.**Noearnest enquiries either have however been made by modern Pandits or critics to understand the real purport of this preliminary anecdote**.** In this state of imperfect knowledge or no knowledge of the subject**,** it is not easy to judge how much gratitude is due from us for the quantity of comments and criticisms so long hurled upon the Maha-bharata and the Ramayana from variousquarters**.** We have only to repeat our tangible difficulties**,** both to our local pundits and the foreign critics**,** who have voluntarily connected themselves

with the elucidations of these texts**,** in the matter of understanding their interpretations without losing our hereditary rights to the most valuable portions of the subject**.** However willingly and respectfully they may be listened to**,** we are forced to complain that they do not appeal themselves to the ordinary intellects and that they seldom appear fair or just to the religiously inclined**.** The complaint is certainly aggravated when the explanations are offered by the Theosophists in more complex and confused methods**.** The combination of Esoterism with Exoterism in one and the same narrative both by the Pandit and the Theosophist is certainly illogical and deserves only to be completely rejected**.** That the main portion of their explanations is oxactly exoteric needs no further trial or proof**.** The foreign critics**'** condemnation of all the important portions of the texts as exaggerations and poetical fancies**,** without understanding the main outline of the stories or the gist of the same**,** is to say the least**,** unauthorised and uncalled for**.**

**केचित्सामान्यमद्वैतं वदन्ति भ्रान्तचेतसः।  
विशेषं द्वैतमाश्रित्य न तेषामस्ति वेदनम्।  
द्वैतमेव हि सर्वत्र प्रवदन्ति हि केचन।  
न ते मनुष्याः कीटाश्चपतङ्गाश्चघटा हि ते॥**

 A more careful and sympathetic scrutiny of the very passages quoted in this connection is sure to furnish us with more profitable and reasonable informations**,** without having to reject any portions or to change the simple method of interpretation in the middle of the same**.** The original so-called historical incident is adimitted on all hands to have taken place in Vykuntha and not in any of the continents or islands on the surface of this globe**.** There are thus no easy means of ascertaining the correctness of the descriptions**,** by direct communication with any of its residents**.** The authors of the

texts on whom alone**,** we have therefore to rely**,** have not hitherto been conclusively proved to be such fools or humbals as to write volumes without facts or sense**;** nor have the mordern interpreters**,** established by any convincing means**,**their special qualifications to comment upon these religions texts**.** A good portion of their contents is generally pronounced to be exaggerations**;** but what is the simple and correct atom of truth the the critic has now discovered**,** or which the given descriptions are exaggerations**,** is neither clearly expressed nor plainly understood**.**What and where is then the logic for this off-hand criticism?

 In quotation 2**,** it is clearly stated in the very commencement**,** that the Rishis passed unmolested through six quadrangles**,** but when they reached the seventh**,** they found two guards attired in Vishnu's own form**.** Now**,** what does the seventh quadrangle represent and why two guards like Vishnu stationed there? Are these not natural questions that suggest themselves to any reasonable reader**,** and yet have any of the interpreters ever cared to notice them**,**before they ventured to urge forward their incoherant illogical and unprofitable explanations? Of course they practically claim the privilege of irresponsibility in such matters**,** and they might certainly be assured that no idea of disturbing their established right is entertained in this essay**.** This fact has been prominently declared in the title page itself.

**जानन्ति ते किमपि तान् प्रति नैष यत्नः॥**

 In chapter III we have examined in detail the import of sapta-bhumikas or seven stages of religious advancement**.**They were found**,** to represent the seven pure Prakritis or Tatwas namely the five subtle elements**,** Budhi and

Ahamkara**,** as well as to specify the seven stages of yogic development beyond which lies real salvation**.**

**अधिष्ठानं भगवतो यस्य सर्वमिदं जगत्।  
एवं भूतगणास्सप्त सन्निविष्टाः परस्परम्।  
सप्तप्रकृतयस्त्वेताः धारयन्ति परस्परम्॥**

**वदन्ति बहुभेदेन वादिनो योगभूमिकाः।  
अवबोधं विदुर्ज्ञानं तदिदं सप्तभूमिकम्।  
मुक्तिस्तु ज्ञेयमित्युक्ताभूमिकासप्तकात्परम्॥**

 Even the Silpa-sastra sticks on to this number in its architectural representation of the seven storeyed tower attached to the Vishnu's Temple**.**

**सप्तभौमं हरेर्ग्रहम्॥**

 In the enumeration of the seven pure Prakritis**,** the Ahamkara or Egoism comes last**.** It is viewed as two **;** the one originating the Elements**,** and the other the Senses**.**

**भूतादिमिन्द्रियादिञ्चद्विधाहङ्कारमीश्वरः।  
बिभर्ति॥**

 Again there is a more philosophical and yogic classification**.** The first is the Ahamkara which recognises the existence of Bramhan in everything The second is the Ahamkara which identifies the self with the Bramhan**,** but keeps itself separate from all other objects**.** The two Ahamkaras are good in their own way as they terminate in salvation at their own destruction**.** There is a third variety of Ahamkara which identifies the self with the physcial body which deserves to be rejected as bad in every way**.**The yogi in his gradual progress has at last to pass through the first two kinds of Ahamkara before he attains to perfection**.** They therefore form the highest stages of development next only to salvation itself**,** and cannot be

omitted in the instructions furnished by a real Guru**.** The ultimate and final stage cannot all at once be taught to an unqualified or half qualified disciple without dangerous consequences**.**

**महोपनिषत्॥**

 It demands no great effort to understand from the passages here quoted**,** that Jaya and Vijaya represent the two high class Ahamkaras or Egoisms attained by long and regular yogic processes which carry man to the very threshold of the inner chamber of the Lord**.** Owing to the want of sufficient steadiness in religious devotion and yogic practice**,** the idea of duality asserts itself very often causing occasional downfalls alluded to in the curse pronounced by the Rishis**.**

**महोपनिषत्॥**

 It demands no great effort to understand from the passages here quoted**,** that Jaya and Vijaya represent the two high class Ahamkaras or Egoisms attained by long and regular yogic processes which carry man to the very threshold of the inner chamber of the Lord**.** Owing to the want of sufficient steadiness in religious devotion and yogic practice**,** the idea of duality asserts itself very often causing occasional downfalls alluded to in the curse pronounced by the Rishis**.**

Ahamkaras and their natural evil tendencies should finally be destroyed through the mercy and blessings of the Almighty**.**The modern fallen man has to work for ages in the devotional sphere to attain to the advanced qualifications of the Rakshasas and Asuras mentioned in the Puranas**.**His existing Ahamkara is not even worth the notice anywhere in the religious texts and hence altogether rejected**.**

**पाणिपादादि मात्रोयमहमित्येष निश्चयः।  
अहङ्कारस्तृतीयोसौ लौकिकःतुछ एव सः।  
तृतीयाहंकृतिस्त्याज्या लौकिकी दुःखदायिनी॥**

 Human history with its most eloquent and soulstirring descriptions of the heroism of man**,** the third kind of Ahamkara**,** displayed in his victorious conquest of kingdoms and in his unbridled rule over vast and varied Empires**,** falls but to the lucky lot of the modern enlightened Historian residing in metropolitan cities of civilized countries**.** Our old and poor houseless Rishis living in wild forests and subsisting on dried leaves and plain water**,** did not aspair to the valuable distinctions of the present Era**,** Social**,** Political or even Literary**.** With the express object of avoiding petty nuisance on their acount to the worldly-wise and practically great people in the land**,** they took to secluded life in the wilderness and composed their harmless works**,** for the use of poor religious folk like themselves**.** But unfortunatlyas the irony of fate would have it**,** these innocent texts were siezed by the learned and enlightened scholars and mercilessly tossed about like footballs**.** There is the local learned Pandit taking them in his hands and giving out his studied orations to the utter bewilderment of the forlorn widows producing alternately tears of grief and joy in their eyes**.** There is the foreign critic who analyses**,** examines and criticises in his own western methods**,**

backed by all his most recent and valuable discoveries of science**.** There is again the Theosophist who is ready to apply all his newly invented instruments for dissection andseparation**,** combination and
permutation**.** The state of affairs here depicted**,** expresses no exaggeration**,** no malicious criticism**,** but only the real and heart-rending grievance of the Hindus in general in the interest of their ancient and sacredreligion**.** We have already noticed in detail in the preceding pages and it is hoped that the readers have not so soon forgotten**,** how the very Asuras and Rakshasas above referred to, have been soeloquently explained, by Mrs. Besant in behalf of Theosopy, as representing cruel cannibals with black magic, once existed on the surface of this earth, but now submerged and extinct. If, as it is eannestly believed there is still any young soul, amidat the the Hindu population in the current century, anxious to reclaim its original religion in its pristine purity, breathing on its native Indian soil, none of the varieties of interpreters noticed here, could any longer hold on like grim death to his preposterous interpretations or criticisms. The correct definitions of technical terms, from within the texts, abundantly obtainedhitherto, throwing sufficient light to render their contents easily understandable, together with the absurdities already exposed, consequent on pure ignorance on the part of all the self-constituted interpreters and critics, have more than convinced us of the absolute and urgent necessity of applying directly to the texts, taking particular care to keep ourselves entirely free from the contamination of these ingorant and misguided patrons of our sacred literature.

 **3.** The complaint of Bhumi. We must proceed further with definite ideas regarding the points already

noticed in the last two paras**.** We have clearly understood from the detailed enquiries therein made**,** that**.** (1) Soota represents purified Intellect**,** (2) Sounakas denote purified mind**,** and (3) Jaya and Vijaya refer to two philosophic Ahamkaras or Egoisms**,** whose fall from heaven and return to it by self- destruction**,** form the main topics in the Maha-bharata as well as the Ramayana**.**

 In this connection**,** we have particularly to remember the Introductory Prologues of Puranas and Itihasas noticed in Para 14**,**chapter I**.** The mother earth is stated to have been pained by the mis-rule of Asura and Rakshasa types of monarchs and burdened with the sins generally committed on her surface**.** She had consequently to visit the Vishnu Loka in the from of a cow to represent her complaints and to extract the promise of an Avatar for the redress of her grievances**.** The difficulties of picking up anything sensible or useful out of this description**,**when literally interpreted as it is now done**,** have been detailed in Chapter I**.** Under the present circumstances**,** it is useless and perhaps shameless to complain against the Pandit or Theosophist for every such item of enquiry. There is however no fear of our consciously omitting any reasonable explanations furnished by them**.** As a matter of fact they have seldom taken the trouble to notice such points as serious or vital**,** demanding explanations**.** All that we had of them hitherto**,** have been granted gratis and we have therefore no right to press upon them with our querries**.** We must only thank them and bid them good-bye**.**

** **The burden brought on the earthy globe by worldly sins**,** her travel to Vishnu Loka in the form of a cow and her representation of grievances in that form**,** all**,** undoubtedly sound stranger and more prosaic than the details of a fable**,** and yet the story is taken for history**.** Having

taken the necessarytrouble in our preliminary enquiries to understand the meaning of technical terms correctly**,** it may not be very difficult to arrive at some reasonable interpretations of the given description**.**

**इदं शरीरं कौन्तेय क्षेत्रमित्यभिधीयते॥**

 This well-known definition in the Bhagavat-Gita makes the matter suffieiently plain to start with the enquiry**.** That which finds itsely destroyed in the end and therefore impermanent is sarira**.**

 शरीरमिति कस्मात्। अग्नयोह्यत्र शृयन्ते ज्ञानाग्निर्द्दर्शनाग्निःकोष्ठाग्निरिति। तत्र कोष्ठाग्निर्न्नामाशितपीतलेह्यचोष्यम्पचंति। दर्शनाग्निंरूपाणां दर्शनं करोति। ज्ञानाग्निःशुभाशुभश्च कर्म विन्दति॥

**गर्भोपनिषत्॥**

 Twenty-one Prakritis or Tatwas constitute this kshetra**,**namely the ten senses**,** ten elements and the mind**.** We have already found two distinct varieties of the same classified into **;** Parthivom-kshethram and Bramha-kshethram**,** the former having evolutionary and materialising tendencies and the latter possessing the opposite character**.**

**त्रेताद्वापरयोः सन्धौ रामः शस्त्रभृतां वरः।  
असकृत्पार्थिषंक्षत्रं जघानामर्षचोदितः॥**

**क्षीणे कलियुगे चैव तिष्ठन्तीति कृते युगे।  
सप्तर्षयस्तु तैस्सार्धं मध्ये त्रेतायुगे पुनः।  
बीजार्थे वै भविष्यन्ति ब्रह्मक्षत्रस्तु वै नृपः॥**

 The same ideas are expressed in regular Puranic style in Adi-parva**,** Maha-bharata itself**.** After the kshetriyas were destroyed twenty-one times by Parasu Rama**,** the world was destitute of that caste and consequently without proper monarchs to rule over**.** The kshetriya women who remained**,** applied to the Bramhins for their progeny and thus originated the Bamha-kshetrom**.**

**रहस्यं खल्विदं राजन् देवानामिति नः श्रुतम्।  
तत्तु ते कथयिष्यामि नमस्कृत्वा स्वयम्भुवे।  
त्रिः सप्तकृत्वः पृथिवीं कृत्वा निःक्षत्रियां पुरा।  
जामदग्न्यस्तपस्तेपे महेन्द्रे पर्वतोत्तमे।  
तदा निक्षत्रिये लोके भार्गवेण कृते सति।  
ब्राह्मणान् क्षत्रिया राजन् सुतार्थिन्योऽभिचकसुः।  
ताभिस्सह समापेतु र्ब्राह्मणाः संशितव्रताः।  
ऋतावृत्तौ नरव्याघ्र न कामान्नानृतौ तथा।  
तेभ्यश्च लेभिरे गर्भ क्षत्रियास्ताः सहस्रशः।  
ततस्सुषिविरे राजन् क्षत्रियान् वीर्यवत्तरान्।  
कुमारांश्च कुमारीश्च पुनः क्षत्राभिवृद्धये।  
एवं तत्ब्राह्मणैः क्षत्रं क्षत्रियासु तपस्विभिः।  
जातं वृद्धं च धर्मेण सुदीर्घेणायुषान्वितम्॥**

**वैशम्पायन उवाच॥**

 The purport of the story is now simple enough**.** The work of Parasu-rama ends with the destruction of the twenty-oneParthivom-kshethroms**.** After this process the Soma-vamsa commences and the Soorya follows in the ascending order**.** The avatars of krishna and Rama in them respectively are thus the consequent results of the invokations of kshethrom or Sarira**,** purified as it is at the time after the anuihilation of its material tendencies in twenty-one directions**.** The cow or Go form in which the Bhumi or sarira has to appear before Vishnu has been several times noticed before**.** Go means a ray of light of knowledge and described as daughters of the sun**.**

**सूर्यसुताश्चगावः॥**

** **The idea conveyed by the complaints and invokations on the whole**,** points exactly to what is definitely stated in philosophy as 'mumukshutwom**,** or the eager desire for salvation**,** freedom from bondage relief from the burden

produced by worldly desires and consequent miseries**.** A clear recognition of the trifling and ephemeral character of all worldly hopes and enjoyments together with an ardent desire to seek and obtain by all possible means**,** something more permanent and blissful**,** in the safety and interest of individual life**,** is the necessary antecedent condition**,** for securing the promise of an Avatar from Vishnu**.** Until we prepare ourselves to rise to this state of purity or Go to be qualified to apply for the 'Avatars**,** there is no use cherishing any hopes of seeing Rama or Krishna**,** Ramayana or Maha-bharata**.**

** **The modern Bhumi or kshetra lies in the midst of the dense and palpable darkness of Kali and there is no Go or light available at present to discover and feel the amount of burden heaped upon its surface**.**Man is seldom alive to the miseries he is enjoying in the disguise of pleasure**.** Every wordly-wise man is only trying to add to his existing burden by a relentless use of his energies and capacities**,** and all such additions are greatly prized as new and valuable gifts secured**.** Even in the midst of carrying unbearable loads**,** painful as the service is known to be**,** it is not rarely that songs of mirth and satisfaction are heard proceeding from the load carrier**.**

**श्रियो दोलालोला विषयजरसाःप्रान्तविरसा  
विपद्गेहं देहं महदपि धनं भूरि निधनम्।  
बृहछाको लोकःसततमबला दुःखबहला  
स्तथाप्यस्मिन्घोरे पथि बत रताः हन्त कुधियः॥**

 More tangible miseries and unmistakable misfortunes are easily disposed of by attributing them to fate or nature by the illiterate and literate respectively**.** The height of

satisfaction attainable by science in this direction, virtually
terminates in Agnosticism.

**निरूपयितुमारब्धे निखिलैरपि पण्डितैः।  
अज्ञानं पुरतस्तेषां भाति कक्षासु कासु चित्।  
न जानामि किमप्येतदित्यन्ते शरणं तव॥**

 The trivial and transient character of the existence of worldly phenomena, should be first scrutinized and clearely understood, and the wild desires consequent on their mistaken notions abandoned, to be qualified to apply for any of the Avatars. The processes required for the purpose, pertain to the working of Parasu-Rama and the use of his formidable axe. As few could afford to assert honestly of their having already implored the help of the Great Parasu-Rama in this matter, it is unnecessary to observe that fewer still could maintain any hope or claim for the sacred Maha-bharata and the Ramayana. The stories of Sri-Krishna and Sri-Rama now preached in the streets cause but mere waste of time and energy. None is prepared for them, none wants them. There is therefore not the slightest doubt, that if these two Avatars present themselves now, they are sure to be slighted and disgraced. The Bhumi is neither ready nor willing to cry or shed tearson account of her burden. When the pain caused by the heaped-up load is actually felt and the grievous complaint is represented before Bramha in the form of a cow and further entreaties are made with Bramha's help before the great Vishnu, the above Avatars could be hoped for, and not till then.

**भूमिर्दृप्तनृपव्याज दैत्यानीक शतायुतैः।  
आक्रान्ता भूरिभारेण ब्रह्माणं शरणं ययौ।  
गौर्भूत्वाश्रुमुखी खिन्ना क्रन्दन्ती करुणं विभोः।  
उपस्थितान्तिके तस्मै व्यसनं स्वमवोचत॥**

**श्रीमद्भागवतम्॥**

 The substance of this story of the earth crying for relief is so important that it is worth any amount of repetition**.** There are certain points to be seriously noticed here**.**

** **1**.** That the worldly riches**,** pleasures and enjoyments should be clearly understood and felt as ephemeral**.**

** **2**.** That the greed for them produced by Kama**,**Krodha and Lobha**,** the three formidable foes of man working through his own sonses**,** should be distinctly recognised as tending to man**'**s ruin in the long run**.**

** **3**.** That an avatar of the Almightly should be acknowledged as absolutely necessary for the destruction of these enemies**,** and that no other known means are capable of accomplishing this object**.**

** **The first point noticed here refers to Vyragia**,** the second to Viveka and the third to Mumukshutwa**.** The first and the last can scarcely be secured without the help of the second which has to furnish the necessary knowledge of the world**,** science and religion**.**

** **The attainment of Vyragia or loss of desire for unworthy objects**,** dopends on reading**,** observation and meditation**.** When this is virtually gained by any possible  
means**,** not much remains to be done**.** The Upanishads**,**Puranas and Itihasas are not therefore sparing in their vivid and touching exhortations on the subject and which always serve as useful religious reading**.**

**महाभारतं शान्तिपर्व ॥**

 Our religious texts in general are freely interspersed with passages like the above, worth reading and ruminating by every thinking soul. They distinctly and impressively place before our view, the unavoidable inconsistencies and irremediable misfortunes ever attending on man's short life in this material world. No soul gifted with common sense could afford to ignore the unsatisfactory state of human affairs or to remain contented without enquiring for better future. A clear, intellignt and earnest recognition of these facts, is more or less described as Vyragia and Mumukshutwa. Until these stages are attained, no man is ripe for the Maha-bharata and much less for the Ramayana.

 It may not be out of place here to observe that arrangements to fill the texts with topics of the above kind, are hardly necessary or even pertinent in treatises on human history. The venerable pandits who waste their energy and skill in misinterpreting other passages with a good deal of trouble and worry, may employ their time more usefully to improve themselves by reading these portions of the texts, which are at present mostly passed over as unimportant; but as a matter of fact they are only avoided as unpalatable, like many more ignored, as impenetrable.

 We might perhaps now proceed safely with the main story of the Maha-bharata. But it must be clearly borne in mind all through, that the points already noticed in the preceding paras should not be lost sight of. If however, the passages from within the texts quoted as authority for our interpretations, are not accepted, there is no common ground to stand upon for any thing like discussion, and reviewes or criticisms do not form part of our object in thishumble and innocent attempt to understand our own religion

correctly somehow. As lucrative benefits or material gains are out of the question here, it is fervently hoped that none will grudge to give us the privilege of being left unmolested. With such simple expectations and humble aspirations, we may plod through our difficult course trusting solely to the Omniscient for help and guidance. If human help, which is not very hopeful under the present conditions, is in any way available, it shall indeed be gratefully welcome, as it is certainly no part of our programme to avoid enligtening instructions. But all else, to thwart, mistify or confuse could not be greeted, and every means employed to annoy, criticise or maliciously attack shall be patiently suffered and respectfully ignored. These unassuming precautions combined with earnest devotion, might vouchsafe a quiet, if not a pleasint journey and a sure, if not a quick progress towards the coveted destination.

 **4.** *The contents of the Maha-bharata.* A long passage from the Adi-purva was quoted in the last chapter, in our enquiry as to the real contents of the Maha-bharata. Vyasa, during his yogic meditation is said to have clearly perceived the whole story in his divine vision.

**तपसा ब्रह्मचर्येण व्यस्य वेदं सनातनम्।  
इतिहासमिमं चक्रे पुण्यं सत्यवतीसुतः।  
भारतस्येतिहासस्य धर्मेणान्वीक्ष्य तां गतिं।  
प्रविश्य योगं ज्ञानेन सोपश्यत्सर्वमन्ततः॥**

 The Ithasa styled Bharata is the result of the analysis of the Vedas themselves and Vyasa and Vyasa perceived it internally and (chakray) *did* the same. These are the very words in the text. Further, what he actually saw as constituting the component parts of the Itihasa is detailed as follows.

**अनादिनिधनं लोके चक्रं सम्परिवर्त्तते।  
त्रयस्त्रिंशत्सहस्राणि त्रयस्त्रिंशछ्शतानि च।  
त्रयस्त्रिंशच्च देवानां सृष्टिः संक्षेपलक्षणा।  
तेभ्योयं कुरुवंशश्च यदूनां भरतस्य च।  
ययातीक्ष्वाकुवंशश्च राजर्षीणां च सर्वशः।  
सम्भूता बहवो वंशा भूतसर्गाः सुविस्तराः।  
भूतस्थानानि सर्वाणि रहस्यं त्रिविधं च यत्।  
वेदा योगः सविज्ञानो धर्मोर्थः काम एव च।  
धर्मार्थकामयुक्तानि शास्त्राणिविविधानि च।  
लोकयात्राविधानश्च सर्वं तद्दृष्टवानृषिः।  
नीतिर्भरतवंशस्य विस्तारश्चैव सर्वशः।  
इतिहासाः सह व्याख्या विविधाः श्रुतयोपि च।  
इह सर्वमनुक्रान्तमुक्तं ग्रन्थस्य लक्षणम्॥**

 The appearance or creation of the thirty-three *Devas*in Vyasa's yogic vision is really the abstract substance of the text.

**त्रयस्त्रिंशच्चदेवानां सृष्टिः संक्षेपलक्षणा।**

 Then appeared the Ikshwaku, Yadu, Kuru, Bharata and other vamsas representing the creation of *Element*s or Bhuta-sarga.

**संम्भूता बहवो वंशा भूतसर्गाःसुविस्तराः।**

 The Vedas, Yoga, Gnana and other sastras serving as *foundation* for these divine creations, all appeared before him.

**भूतस्थानानि सर्वाणि रहस्यं त्रिविधश्च यत्।  
वेदा योगः सविज्ञानो धर्मोर्थः काम एव च।**

 Then appeared at last the Niti, Scheme or contrivance in the form of Bharata-vamsa, and the vistara, or the process of expanding it in the form of Itihasa. All these complete

the necessary details in regular order of succession, which appeared before Vyasa in his vision, and which constitute the characteristics of his Grantha or composition of his particular yogic scheme.

**नीतिर्भरतवंशस्य विस्तारश्चैव सर्वशः।  
इतिहासाः सह व्याख्या विविधाः श्रुतयोपि च।  
इह सर्वमनुक्रान्तमुक्तं ग्रन्थस्य लक्षणम्॥**

 The original and Eternal substance that first appeared in Vyasa's yogic vision, from which all the above divine creations proceeded, is described as the Great Egg, the Great Divine, or Mahat-divya the Universal cause for the creation of Prajas and yugas whose technical meanings have been amply explained already. The Jyoti-bramha or Sadasadatmaka is found here representing exactly the idea described by the names Bramha-kshetra, Saguna-nirguna, Sakala-nishkala, Purana-purusha &c., in the previous pages.

**प्रविश्य योगं ज्ञानेन सोपश्यत्सर्वमन्ततः।  
निष्प्रभेस्मिन्निरालोके सर्वतस्तमसावृते।  
बृहदण्डमभूदेकं प्रजानां बीजमव्ययम्।  
युगस्यादिनिमित्तं तन्महद्दिव्यं प्रचक्षते।  
यस्मिंस्तज्छ्रूयते सत्यं ज्योतिर्ब्रह्म सनातनम्।  
अत्भुतञ्चाप्यचिन्त्यं च सर्वत्र समतां गतम्।  
अव्यक्तं कारणं सूक्ष्मं यत्तत्सदसदात्मकम्।  
यस्मिन् पितामहो जज्ञे प्रभुरेकःप्रजापतिः॥**

 The Maha-bharata is thus the working scheme of the Purana-purusha, which appears to a Vyasa in his yogic vision with details enumerated in the order of succession. The contrivance for producing this vision by yoga, which Vyasa performed is the Grantha or composition. To start with this work, Vyasa qualified himself by analysing the Vedas, व्यस्य वेदं सनातनम्॥

 We can now clearly understand from the above examination of the passages from the text itself, that unless the Vedas are analysed and their essence extracted, one cannot rise to the status of a Vyasa, and until he is able to perform the required yoga for Maha-bharata, no divine visions constituting its contents will ever become perceptible. Every one should therefore exert himself first to be qualified for Vyasa's position and then perform the Maha-bharata with all his energies and capacities. No doubt it is a very difficult task, but worth all trial.

**महत्वात्भारवत्वाच्चमहाभारतमुच्यते।  
निरुक्तमस्य यो वेद सर्वपापैः प्रमुच्यते॥**

** 5.** *The composition of the Maha-bharata.* We have already mentioned in the preceding chapter a peculiar fact connected with the composition of the Maha-bharata. 60 hundred thousand slokas were said to have been composed by Vyasa, 30 hundred thousands being for the use of the Deva-loka, 15 hundred thousand for Pitri loka, 14 hundred thousands for Rakshasa and Yaksha-lokas and the remaining one huudred thousand being for the man's loka. This last portion was first preached to Janamejaya by Vysampayana and then again by Soota to the Sounakas.

**षष्टिं शतसहस्राणि चकारान्यां ससंहितां।  
त्रिंशछतसहस्रं च देवलोके प्रतिष्ठितम्।  
पित्र्ये पञ्चदशप्रोक्तं रक्षोयक्षे चतुर्द्दश।  
एकं शतसहस्रन्तु मानुषेषु प्रतिष्ठितम्।  
वैशम्पायनविप्रर्षिः श्रावयामास पार्थिवम्।  
पारिक्षितं महात्मानं नाम्नातु जनमेजयम्।  
अस्मिंस्तु मानुषे लोके वैशम्पायन उक्तवान्।  
शिष्यो व्यासस्य धर्मात्मा सर्ववेदविदां वरः।  
एकं शतसहस्रं तु मयोक्तंवै निबोधत॥**

 Some technical difference is stated to be observed in reckoning the real commencement of the Maha-bharata. The Adi-parva has the following on this point.

**मन्वादिभारतं केचिदास्तीकादि तथाऽपरे।  
तथोपरिचराद्यन्ये विप्राः सम्यगधीयिरे।  
विविधं संहिताज्ञानं दीपयन्ति हनीषिणः।  
व्याख्यातुं कुशलाः केचित् ग्रन्थान् धारयितुं परे।**

 It is perhaps highly desirable to draw particular attention of the readers to the fact that such passages cannot be passed over like those found in ordinary sanskrit literature. The inimitable command which our ancient Rishis possessed over the language and the peculiar flexibility of the language itself, combined with the extraordinary inginuity brought to play upon the Puranic style of treatment, are indeed worthy of the admiration of every student of the literature. It is in the midst of such grand intellectual gymnastics that we have to seek for the most valuable religious instructions unmistakably imbeded. It is no wonder therefore that they generally pass unnoticed by the unqualified and the unsympathetic. The few lines quoted above are full of such expressions deserving serious scrutiny.

 "The commencement of the Maha-bharata is variously viewed. Some start with Manu, others with Astika or with Uparichara. These three different views are held by the great and the wise, among whom some are adepts in its 'Vyakhya' or enlarging upon and some in its 'Dharana' or maintaining or retaining in the mind." We are thus compelled here to look into the descriptions given in the text concerning Manu, Astika and Uparichara in their relation to the story in the Maha-bharata.

 From Manu, the pedigree is traced for the Soma-vamsa which commences with Purooravas the son of Ila. Ila or

Ida in yogic language clearly refers to the Ida-nadi and we have only recently found Purooravas representing Prana or life breath. The import of Manu has been enquired in detail in chapter III. Manu is here stated to have had fifty extra sons who fought mutually and destroyed themselves. The general significance of Manu as Manthra consisting of letters is more than corroborated here. The production of Bramha-kshetra, by a combination of Bramha and kshetra, repeatedly explained before, is also stated here in sufficiently plain language.

**मार्त्तण्डस्य मनुर्धीमानजायत सुतः प्रभुः।  
धर्मात्मा स मनुर्धीमान्यत्र वंशः प्रतिष्ठितः  
मनोर्वंशे मानवानां ततोयं प्रथितोभवत्।  
ब्रह्मक्षत्रादयस्तस्मा न्मनोर्जातास्तु मानवाः।  
ततोभवन्महाराज बह्मक्षत्रेण संगतम्।  
ब्राह्मणा मानवास्तेषां सांङ्गं वेदमधारयन्।  
वेनं धृष्ण्युंनरिष्यन्तं नाभागेक्ष्वाकुमेव च।  
कारूषमथशर्यातिं तथा चैवाष्ठमीमिलाम्।  
पृषध्रंनवमं प्राहुः क्षत्रधर्मपरायणम्।  
नाभागारिष्ठदशमान्मनोःपुत्रान् प्रचक्षते।  
पञ्चाशत्तु मनोः पुत्रास्तथैवान्येऽभवन् क्षितौ।  
अन्योन्यभेदात्ते सर्वे विनेशुरिति नः श्रुतम्।  
पुरूरवास्ततो विद्वानिलायां समपद्यत।  
सा वैतस्याभवन्माता पिता चैवेति नः श्रुतम्॥**

 The gist of the description here given is, that all further details of working the Maha-bharata, should be performed with a complete and clear idea of the general conception of the preliminary facts stated here concerning Manu, Brainba-kshetrom, Ila, Purooravas &c. Unless these introductory technical explanations are kept in mind, the subsequent instructions in the text furnished in the Puranic

style of treatment could not be understood. The required caution is therefore clearly stated in the commencement of the text giving the necessary clues for future guidance. It is in spite of such timely warnings and precautions, that numerous irrelevant interpretations have now become current. In fact the first mistake committed was in misunderstanding the warning itself. Our recognised patrons of religious texts, the Pandits, are known to be usually gifted with an inborn capacity to twist every unyielding substance in the world, and they are liable to its misuse here through indifference rather than by active effort. From the very beginning the subject was slighted as not sufficiently lucrative, all other noble considerations in behalf of learning having left them for pretty long time, and the mere covetousness for the dignity of the status of Universal authority being alone eagerly kept up. Next to Manu, we may now take up the story of Uparichara reserving that of Astika for our last consideration.

**आदिपर्व॥**

 "Uparichara Vasu a descendant of the Purus, was given the rule over the Chelis by Indra, but instead of taking up sovereignty, he began to perform Tapas. Indra and the Devas were afrail that he was thus aiming at Indra's own position. Indra therefore came down to him and advised him thus. You may rule over this Bhu-loka, as I rule over the Deva-lok. Your territory will be ever prosperous, and you may live comfortably in the centre of it. I present unto you a divine vehicle which will carry you through the sky. I give you a garland called Indra-mala which will never wither, and wearing the same in battle you can be victorious. I offer you also a bam boo stick with which you can righteously rule over all." Indra, presenting these to the king induced him to abandon his tapas and then left. The king performed sacrifices pleasing to Indra and raled over the country happily. He had five sons among whom the territories were dividel and the countries took their names from them. The sons were Brihadratha, Prathiagraha, Kusamba, Matsilla and Yedu, all cognised as Raja-rishis. Uparichara stayed in the sky in his divine vehicle attended by Gantharvas and Apsaras. The name Uparichara was thus given to, the king”.

 The Maha bharata is said to commence with this story of Upari chara. It is sufficiently plain from the meaning of the name given to the king of the Soma-vamsa, that the work of the Maha-bharata is not to be performed on the ground but above it, upari. Until one is able to rise above the level of materiality by securing the satisfaction of Indra, the Lord of the senses or Indriyas, there is no scope for the Maha.bharata. The Puranic significance is pretty simple here and demands no great ingenuity to understand it correctly. Before proceeding with the story of Astika and Surpa-satra above referred to it may be of use to notice

here some definite views expressed recently by Indian gentlemen of high class western civilization on the points in question, as they are expected to have studied the texts closely and with sympathy and earnestness. A learned Hindu author of this type has but a few years ago published in India his dissertations on the Maha-bharata. The title of the book is this. "The Maha-bharata, a criticism by C. V. Vaidya, M. A. L. L. B., Honorary Fellow of the University of Bombay."

 On a thorough examination of the contents of the text he is clearly of opinion that there are three different versions of the Maha-bharata as established by the passage from the text already quotel. Vyasa's original composition was much smaller and styled Jaya.

**जयो नामेतिहासोयम्।  
ततो जयमुदीरयेत्॥**

 The second elition was Vysampayana's consisting of 24000 slokas only. The third version as adjusted by Southi, was expanded into one lac of slokas. This could not have been so adjusted by Southi earlier than 300 B. C. for various ra iso is stated in the new book of the author. This modern author is of further opinion that the Mahabharata War actually took place in Delhi between 3100 B C and 2000 B C during Vyasa's time who must have been an eye-witness to the battle. This author thinks that by the last edition and expansion of the text by Southi 'the work has almost lost its character as an Epic poem and has become and has always been acknowledged, as a Smriti and Dharma-sastra'. Soota has introduced many interpolations and unmeaning repetitions of several stories. The author is not quite satisfied with the reasons alleged for reckoning the Kali era from 3101 B. C. The

points discovered for astronomical proof, he says, are also proved to be fictitious as they rest on untrue premises. He gives his interpretation of the stories of Thakshaka and Sarpa-satra as representing the assassination of Parikshit by Thakshaka, a leader of the Nagas and the subsequent destruction of the Nagas by Janamejaya in connection with which Vysampayana narrated the story of the Maha-bharata for Janamejaya's information. The remnants of the Pandava family are the Tars of the Rajaput tribe and they became extinct when their king lost the Empire of India in the battle of Panipat in the 13th century A. D. The above is more or less the sum and substance of the valuable dissertation on the Maha-bharata.

 From the book under reference the settled views of the author on the following points may be logically presumed,

 1. That Maha-oharata treats of human history and that Vy asa, Vysampayana and Soota are human authors.

 2. That Thakshaka was the leader of the Naga tribe found in the Indian Forests.

 3. That the end of Dwapara at which the war took place refers to B. C. 3101.

 4. That all stories in the Maha-bharata which do not directly concern the great war, are fables current at the time in India interpolated by Soota in the text,

 5. That all descriptions which cannot be attributed to hum an life are exaggerations and poetical embellishments.

 6. That in spite of several of the defects pointed out, the Maha-bharata is a grand Epic whose plot is splendid and well-laid.

 The above discoveries are doubtless made locally with the help of costly wastera spectacles used for the careful examination of the contents of the text. Unfortunately they contain nothing new as compared with those hitherto obtained directly from the western researches, which have however not yet been able to furnish any real consolation to the average Hindu in the land. What is therefore actually gained by the present attempt in behalf of the religious text, or in behalf of the nation at large is a matter for the decision of those actually concerned. So far as the nakel eye of an ordinary Hindu reader can perceive, it appears to serve only as a more irritating and less healing remedy than that offered by a foreigner who might naturally have his reasons for misunderstanding the subject. The misinterpretations of the Pandit in his supposed interest of Hindu religion, absurd as it is, is neither so repulsive nor so illogical as the modern suicidal attempt locally made in simple apish imitation of the west. The Pandit's mistake is consequent on his religious belief in the possibilities of supernatural religious incidents. The views expressed above by the Hindu author of the new book are probably based upon his complete disbelief so far and in the belief that the Maha-bharata is really a historical treatise.

 The investigations made seem to have however been confined to the internal evidence gathered from the contents of the text as found at present. All portions of the text which on a superficial examination did not please the critic or suit his preconceivel opinions, are immediately pronounced to be fables, interpolations, exaggerations and poetical flourishes. It is difficult to see what was the criterion applied for sifting the internal evidence obtained, and where was the necessity and the authority to reject the definitions and explanations offered and the exact method of interpreta-

tion pointed out in the text itself. The critic has no right to override the author of the text or to try his own extraordinary processes on others' property.

 The critic admits that the name Maha-bharata is said to have been given by Souti owing to its greatness and its. weight, and quotes the text as authority.

**महत्वात् भारवत्वाच्च महाभारतमुच्येत।**

 But the very next line giving the necessary explanation or clue for correct interpretation, he does not condescend to notice.

**निरुक्तमस्य यो वेद सर्वपापैः प्रमुच्यते।**

 'He who finds out its derivative meanings is absolved from all his sins.' So much stress is laid on the rootmeanings of terims used and somuch religious benefit is attached to them. The critic evidently does not care for the instructions furnished. He has clearly missed the clues from beginning to end and his criticisms therefore do not in the least affect the literature in question.

**श्रद्धालुरिह सर्वत्र वैदिकेष्वधिकांरतः।**

 We may now proceed with the story of Astiks and of Sarpa-satra.

 Parikshit, the grandson of Arjuna having died bitten by Thakshaka, his son Jenamejaya, succeeded to the throne. He instituted a serpent sacrifice to avenge the injury, resolved to exterminate the whole serpent race. Thakshaka through fear sought the help of Indra who supported him as far as he could, but failed in the end. Both Indra an Thakshaka were dragged by the force of mantra to the sacrificial fire and Indra had to leave Thakshaka to shift for himself. He was saved however subsequently by the intercession of the sage Astika,

 An ancient Rishi known by the name of Jaratkaru was induced by his fallen Pitris to marry and beget a sou to propitiate them. He married accordingly a sister of Vasuki called Jaratkaru and begot a son named Astika. As a nephew of Thakshaka, he came to the rescue of the serpents at the sacrifice and implored a boon which was granted, and that was to abandon the ceremony altogether at that stage.

 The Maha-bharata having been recited by Vysampayana at this sacrifice, it is said to begin with the story of Astika. An examination of a few couplets from the passages narrating the above stories is likely to furnish us with the necessary clues to understand the import of the stories.

**परिक्षीणेषु कुरुषु सोत्तरायामजीजनत्।  
परिक्षिदभवत्तेन सौभद्रस्यात्मजो बली॥**

**आदिपर्व॥**

 He was born after the Kurus became extinct and hence called Parikshit. Pariksha literally means investigation examination, testing. After the great war where all the evil ideas and notions represented by the Kurus were destroyed, the true investigation commenced. 'Uttara' the name of his mother, referring to gnana, as opposed to karma or Dekshina is sufficiently significant. Parikshit also applies to Agni or gnana. The significance of Jenamejaya mentioned as the son of Parikshit who performed the serpa-sacrifice deserves also careful notice-जनं + एजयति=जनमेजयः-He who shakes the Jeno-loka or the Loka from which there is constant return is Jenamejaya. He makes himself immortal and stops further rebirth by the serpa-sacrifice.

**अन्यः प्रवर्त्तते कल्पो जनाल्लोकात्पुनः पुनः॥**

**वायुपुराणम्॥**

 Similarly, the idea conveyed by Vysampayana Rishi preaching the Mahabharata to Jenamejaya is worth noticing. Sampa means lightning, brightness or knowledge, and Ayanom means situation. The intellectual clearness and brightness attained by Tapas, which could enlighten the individual soul is alluded to here.

 **अथ कस्मादुच्यते वैद्युतं यस्मादुच्चार्यमाण एव व्यक्तं महति तमसि द्योतयति तस्मादुच्यते वैद्युतम्॥**

**अथर्वशिर उपनिषत्॥**

 We have yet to enquire into the technical meanings of terms, such as, Nagas, Vyalas, Pannagas and Serpas, so often found used in the texts.

**वायुपुराणम्॥**

 Ananta, Sesha and Naga represent the Great Yogi Vishnu who is the support for everything. The poison donotes Tamas which destroys everything.

 Vyala signfies cruelty or wickedness, Ahi, defect, Pannaga, extoling and serpa, motion or gliding along like a spy. The general idea conveyed is the unstability of the mental functions. Thakshaka also refors to a Vardhaki or architect, signifying here some constructive functions of the mind, the power to create illusory ideas to confound mankind. The stability of the yoga referred to Parikshit is said to be disturbed and distracted by him, and hence described as having died of the poison. His son Jeuamejays with greater fortitude proceeded to destroy all the mental functions which obstruct the yogic path to salvation. He thus celebrated the great serpa-sacrifice which is mentioned as specially reserved for him alone in the sastras. Having attained to the position signified by his name as explained above, he is the only qualified monarch to perform this sacrifice. Without the requisite boldness and determination, the perturbation of mind could not be easily put a stop to.

**अस्ति राजन्महत्सत्रं त्वदर्थं देवनिर्मितम् ।  
सर्पसत्रमिति ख्यातं पुराणे परिपठ्यते।  
आहर्त्तातस्य संत्रंस्य त्वन्नान्योस्ति नराधिप।  
इति पौराणिकाःप्राहुरस्माकं चास्ति स क्रतुः॥**

**आदिपर्व॥**

 The Puranas particularly say that the serpa-sacrifice is specially intended for you and those learned in the Puranas say that none else is qualified to perform the same'. This curious description is full of clear meaning in its own fashion. All perverted critics may take note of this. The words Satra and Kretu apparently used as synonyms for sacrifice, signify virtue and intelligence.

 The narrow escape of Thakshaka from the great peril, by the timely intercession of Astika, son of two Jaratkaroos, and the consequent termination of the sacrifice before completion, require some explanation.

**शौनकउवाच॥**

**किं कारणं जरत्कारोर्न्नामैतत्प्रथितं भुवि।

**सौतिरुवाच॥**

 "Sounaka enquired of Southi for the Nirukta or derivative meaning of the term Jarat-karu. Southi explained that it refers to a physical body greatly reduced by religious penance and applies here both to the husband and the wife." The import of these passages needs no further explanation.

**अस्त्ययं सुभगे गर्भस्तव वैश्वानरोपमः।  
ऋषिःपरमधर्मात्मा वेदवेदाङ्ग पारगः।  
चीर्णव्रतो बाल एव बुद्धिसत्वगुणान्वितः।  
नामचास्याभवत् ख्यातं लोकेष्वास्तीक इत्युत।  
अस्तीत्युक्त्वा गतो यस्मान्पितागर्भस्थमेव तम्।  
वनं तस्मादिदं तस्य नामास्तीकेति विश्रुतम्॥**

 'Jaratkaru the father told Jaratkaru the mother that there is, or *Asti,* in her womb a great Rishi and retired to the forest for tapas; and as the child was also gifted with all the best qualities, he was known by the name Astika'. The words Jaratkaru and Astika furnish a very clear idea of the matter specified. Astikom is the firm belief in the existence of a Supreme Being and a strong faith in Him has to be secured by much tapas or

devotion causing reduction of the physical body. When this Astika presented himself before Jenamejaya, while engaged in the destruction of evil meatal propensities, he lost all fear for Thakshaka, the head of the race, and therefore let him free. The purport of the story is, that when one has acquired a firm and real belief in the existence of a universal God, the natural vitiating tendencies of the mind could do him no harm. These are certainly the inferences that naturally suggest themselves to any ordinary reader of the text, hardly possessing anything more than a very insignificant knowledge of th sanskrit language. Better scholars and more intelligent enquirers could easily discover more valuable and interesting instructions, from the very same passages, provided only they could be believed to proceed with honesty of purpose.

 We have now two distinct sets of processes placed before us by the description of the Maha-bharata war and that of the sarpa-satra, both pointing to the destruction of certain obstructive tendencies of the mind acting against the attainment of the nitimate goal. The Kurus destroyed in the great war as well as the serpents killed in the sacrifice constitute the totality of all such items. The serpents may be interpreted as the natural objective tendencies of the mind inherent by its very constitution, causing fickleness and unstability; and the Kurus may be taken for the Vasanas or the net-results of all past karmas tending to domineer over man and lead him by force, in their own directions. Both of these require to be curbed and conquered for the purpose of Yogic progress; and the processes adopted are tchnically known as Vasana-ksheya and Mano-nasa, already noticed in the previous chapters. They are described as affecting each other mutually and are therefore recommended to be practised simultaneously.

 The idea expressed by the statement that the commencement of the Maha-bharata should be reckoned from the story of Astika, is therefore significant in its own way. The Sarpa-satra itself described as taking place after the war, during the time of Jenamejaya is equally noteworthy. No criticisms on the plea of inconsistencies or anachronisms need be brought forward here. In accordance with our interpretation carried right through as consistently as possible, the Maha-bharata war is not ended. On the contrary, it would even take an unlimited time before proper prepartions are made to start the great battle. The mutual action and relation of the two processes are distinctly established in the religious texts.

**यावद्विलीनं न मनो न तावद्वासानाक्षयः।  
न क्षीणा वासना यावच्चित्तं तावन्नशाम्यति।  
वासनाक्षय विज्ञान मनोनाशा महामते।  
समकालं चिराभ्यस्ता भवन्ति फलदा मताः॥**

 We see clearly by the above examinations, that the three different versions for the commencement of the Maha-bharata mentioned in the quotation, are therefore full of technical meaning referring to the correct interpretation of the text as a whole. They do not certainly prove that the Maha-bharata was edited and revised at three different periods, by Vyasa, Vysampayana and Souti, as ingeniously explained by the learned Hindu author alluded to in this para. The passage quoted itself distinctly mentions, that the wise and the learned explain the real import of the great text, in various intelligent methods for the edification of the public at large.

**विविधं संहिताज्ञानं दीपयन्ति मनीषिणः॥**

** 6.** *The dramatis personae.* Whatever might be the differences of opinions entertained with regard to the correctness of the method of interpretation hitherto followed, it is doubtless continued under the firm belief in the sacred and serious character of our ancient religious texts and under the direct authority of the clues and explanations furnished by the venerable authors themselves. It is therefore confidently hoped that we have no reasons to be entirely misled in our humble attempt to understand and benefit ourselves by the blessings of our respected forefathers. We might however certainly have the consolation that we have not been presumptuously trying to display our independent views formed by careless pride or objectionable motives, or by considerations in behalf of social, political or other extraneous subjects.

 It is hardly necessary to reiterate in this connection, that in an attempt of the kind undertaken in this little essay, it is not possible to give an exhaustive explanation for every detail in the text, nor that such a voluminous work would be acceptable or useful under the existing conditions. The mere recognition of the Puranic formulas to be applied for the correct interpretation of the existing texts, is the only desideratum that demands immediate attention. At the present stage of the treatment of the subject under reference, an examination, in our usual method, of the various names given to the dramatispersonae, is in itself likely to unfold many a useful and interesting topic. The text doubtless provides ample scope for intellectual exercise in this direction. The common ancestry is traced to the Great Bramha and different species of creation are said to have originated from Him. Having learned by past enquiries, that the idea expressed by the

term Bramha points to pure satwic Intellect conceived in its totality, there is no logic to associate the same with crude conceptions of low material creations.

**बुद्धिर्मनश्चलिङ्गश्च महानक्षर एव च।  
पर्यायवाचकैः शब्दै स्तमाहुस्तत्वचिन्तकाः॥**

 The good and evil characters ranging respectively on the opposite sides, fighting the great battle of the Mahabharata, certainly denote some specific items higher and more valuable than those now identified with the worldly transactions of man. The following quotations from the text itself will be ir ample testimony to the facts expressed. The current interpretation of the dramatis-personae as representing hur an characters of historical periods is indeed a distorted version of truth, and all half-hearted admiration of the contents of the text as partly historical and partly mythical is more injurious than holding up the same to complete ridicule and contempt. Those who are unprepared to take the trouble to investigate for themselves and to discard their existing prejudices may indulge in personal predilections privately, and they may be gladly assured that this treatise is not addressed to them for their occasional pleasure and distraction. It would be simply puerile to criticise the whole of the contents of the text as interpolations, without proper internal evidence or external proof; and it would be equally preposterous to contemptuously depreciate the value of important points, for the plain reason that the critic is somehow steeped in inextricable prejudices. An ancient religion of such unique value and of high cosmopolitan type could not so easily or conveniently secure appreciation and sympathy from quarters proudly influenced by narrow views and sectarian obstinacies, curiously appearing too often in the disguise of broad and enlightened

opinions. Criticisms in modern days are also not rarely found, proceeding with a view to get over some tangible defects or deficiencies the critic is probably smarting under. Without further delay, it is absolutely necessary, to get over the bashful cowardice to acknowledge and maintain truth and to put aside for a while, the unmanly delicacy to withstand the tyranies of literary domination over the ancient and sacred religion. It is earnestly hoped that the following passages will therefore be dealt with like any other harmless literature in a spirit of sympathy and tolerance.

***Quotation. No. I.***

 a. “Marichi, Angira, Athri, Pulastya, Pulaha and Kretu are six Maharishis, the mind-born sons of Bramha. Siva's sons are eleven. Brihaspathi, Uchathya and Samvartha are the three sons of Angira. Athri has several sons of great merit. Rakshasas, Vanaras, Kinnaras and Yekshas are the sons of Pulastya. Sarabhas, lions, tigers, Kimpurushas, bears and wolves are the sons of Pulaha. The birds of great merit are the sons of Kretu."

 b. Dharma is the son of Bramha born from his right breast. Sama, Kama and Hersha are the three sons of Dharma and the supporters of the Lokas. Reti, Prapti and Nanda are their respective wives, equally supporting the Lokas. Prejapathi the son of Bramha has eight sons known as Vasus. They are Dhara, Dhruva, Soma, Aha, Anila, Anala, Pretyusha and Prebhasa. The mother of Dhara and Dhruva or Bramha-vidya, is Dhumra. The mother of Soma is Manasw ini ; that of nila or air is Swasa; of Aha or day is Reta, of Anala or fire is Sandillya. Dhruva's son is Kala or time. The mother of Pretyusha and Prebhasa or dawn is Prebhata. Dhara's son is Drevina and Apa's son is

Vythandya. Soma's son is Varcha or lustre. Sisira, Prana and Remana are the sons of Manohara. Jyoti or light is the son of Aha or day, son of fire is Kumara residing in saravana and his younger brothers are Sakha, Visakha and Nigameya. Hwing been produced by Kritik, he is known as Kartikeya. Siva is the wife of Anila or air. Manojava and Avignata-geti are her two sons. The eighth Vasu namely Prabhasa married the sister of Brihaspathy, who is accomplished in philosophy and Yoga."

 All Sanskrit stulonts can easily understand the meanings of the various names enumerated in the above passages, as applying to something other than human forms. Bramha having been clearly explained in Chapter III as representing the divine basis for the totality of the involutionary Intellects, his progeny here described in the usual Puranic style, surely allud to certain technical functions of the Intellect in the religious processes, of which we cannot afford to give detailed explanations here. The passages following also deal with further elaborate details of the sune kind. The whole of it is an extremely scientific and technical subject to those who are earnestly inclined to study and make use of it. Were it even possible or convenient to explain here the technical terms in the above passages, it would only be useless to the modern public and the Pandit, who are not prepared for the subject under the present circumstances.

 c. "Bhrigu originated from the heart of Bramha. Kavi or Sukra is the son of Bhrigu whose son is the planet Sukra, which under the instructions of Bramha goes round the Bhuvanas keeping up the life of the three Lokas. Sukra, the master of yoga became the religious preceptor of the Asuras and also of the Devas. Chyevana of great tapas is another son of Bhrigu. His wife is Arushy daughter of

Manu. Ourva is her son born from her thigh. His son is Richika and his son again is Jemadagni, who has four sons, the youngest and the greatest being Parasu-Rama."

 d. "From the right thumb of Bramha, Deksha the great Rishi was born and his wife was born from the left thumb. Fifty daughters were born to them, but no son. Ten of these daughters were married to Dharma, namely, Kirthi, Lakshmi, Dhriti, Medha, Pushti, Sredha, Kriya, Budhi, Lejja and Mathi. They represent the paths to Dharma. Twenty-seven daughters were married to Soma or Moon. They represent Nakshathra-yoginis who arrange and guide the path through the Lokas."

 The names given here are too plain to need an explanation, at least so far as their inapplicability is concerned to the objects now pointed out by the modern Pandit in his indifferent attitude.

 e. "Kasyapa is the son of Marichi and is the source of the Lokas. His sons are the Devas and the Asuras. By Aditi he has twelve sons beginning, with Indra, the youngest being Vishnu in whom the Lokas reside. There are thirty-three Devas whose families styled Rudras, Sadhyas, Maruts, Vasus &c, I shall explain to you. Bhargava and Viswedevas belong to the Vasus. Garuda, Aruna and Brihaspathi belong to the Adityas, vegetables and cows belong to the Guhyakas. All these repesent the Devaganas."

 f. 'The thirteen daughters of Deksha married to Kasyapa are, Aditi, Diti, Denu, Kaala, Denayu, Simhika, Krodha, Pradha, Viswa, Vinata, Kapila, Muni and Kalru. Their issues possess great powers. The twelve Adityas, the Lords of Bhuvanas are the sons of Aditi named, Dhata, Mithra, Aryama, Sakra, Varuna, Bhaga, Vivaswan, Pusha, Savitha, Tweshta and Vishnu. Diti has only one

son named Hiranya-kasipu. He has five sons of great repute, namely, Prehlada, Samhlada, Anuhlada, Sibi and Bashkala. Prehlada has three sons named Virochana, Kumbha and Nikumbha. Beli is the only son of Virochana. Bana, devoted to Rudra and known as Maha-kala is the famous son of Bali. Danu has twenty-four sons, the eldest being named Viprachithi. Rahu, the enemy of Sun and Moon is the son of Sinhika. The issues of Krura are all cruel in nature and their gana or group is termed Krodhavasa. Danayu, Vikshara, Belavira and Vritra are the four sons of Kaala. Vinasana, Krodha, Krodha-hanta, Krodhasatru &c are known as Kalakyas".

 g. "Adharma, the destroyer of everything was born owing to the Prejas eating one another mutually. His wife is called Nirirti from whom the Nyrirtas or Rakshasas originated. Bhaya, Maha-bhaya and Mrityu or Death are the sons of Adharma. Mrityu is the destroyer of all. He has no wife, no sons".

***Q. No. II.***

 "Sredha gave birth to Kama; Lekshmi to Derpa; Dhriti to Niyama; Tushti to Santosha; Pushti to Lobha; Medha to Sri; Kriya to Dendam, Naghom, Vinayom and Vyavasayom; Budhi to Bodhom; Legja to Vinayom; Santi to Kshemom; Sidhi to Sukom, Yesa and Kirti. All these are the sons of Dharma. Kama son of Dharma has a son named Harsha by Nandi. The wife of Adharma is Himsa whose issues are Anirta or untruth, Bhayomor fear, Narakom or hell, Nikriti or fraud, Maya or false-hood Vedana or pain&c. Maya gave birth to Mrityu or Death. Mrityu's issues are Jera or decrepitude, Vyadhi or disease, Soka or grief, Trishna or greed, and Krodha or anger. All these are producers of pain and of the natureof Adharma,

They have no wives or children. They are the cruel forms originating from Bramha and are the destroyers of the world. Savitri named also Sapta-rupa is the wife of Bramha and the mother of the Sata-Rishis, of Deksha and other Prejapathis and also of Swayombhuva and other Manus."

 The terms Dharma, Adharma, Mrityu, Himsa &c are too commonly used even in ordinary language to require any explanation. Comments are therefore hardly necessary to prove the extreme absurdity of the modern interpretation of the Pandit in representing them as personages in the history of acient India. And yet he is sure to hate the very idea of seeking for a correct and reasonable interpretation.

**इन्दुंनिन्दति तस्करोगृहपतिं जारो सुशीलं खलः  
साध्वीमप्यसती कुलीनमकुलो जह्याज्जरन्तं युवा।  
विद्यावन्तमनक्षरो धनपतिं नीचश्च रूपोज्वलम्  
वैरुप्येण हतः प्रबुद्धमबुधो कृष्टं निकृष्टोजनः॥**

 The above qotations give a general description of the species of creation from which the individual characters of the Maha-bharata war are drawn. That these species do not refer to anything common to the treatment of ordinary human history needs no special explanation to readers gifted with human brains and common sense. Any display of abnormal intellectual capacities in the criticisms furnished, could not seriously affect the real import of the subject which is too plain, too broad and too deep to be easily vitiated by silly and insignificant interference. An ocean of Godly truths and wisdom is not likely to be putrified by a poisonous river of unwisdom or mischief. All imaginary fears produced by modern attempts in various quarters tending te deprive our ancient religion of its essential life and characteristic, may therefore be safely and entirely

telinquished. The Divine could not be shaken or even measured by the human, and such a foolish trial could not naturally end without a reaction.

 The masculine and feminine names used in the passages quoted are sufficiently significant to guarantee a *prima-facie* inference as to their philosophical character without going into a deeper examination. Any couninou sanskrit Nikhaudu or dictionary is sure to furnish better and more correct information than that voluntarily offered by the fossilized Pandit or the indifferent and irresponsible critic. Every term without a single exception is aptly introduced with great care and caution. The exact technical and relevant application, invariably discovered on examination is no matter of accidental or occasional occurence; and the ideas conveyed refer to no allegorical representations from an imaginative brain, but denote perceptible psychological facts experienced in the practice of yoga, not of course attractive or interesting to the major portion of the modern world which has almost fallen into a servitude of materialism and sensual depravity.

 The curious interpretations of such sacred and philosophical matters, as astral doubles and etheric visions produced even by narcotic effects are simply intolerable. That our venerable Rishis, well-known for their practice and preaching of all abstinence from intoxicating drugs, should at last be pronounced to have been the authors of voluminous texts on religion and philosophy, in which after all they embodied only their experiments and experiences in the spirituous sphere rather than in the spiritual, is surely the least expected and the most unfortunate climax to which we are unconsciously driven by the current of Theosophic thought. Mrs Besant in a recent publication of hers on 'Theosophy, page 27 writes:—

 "Etheric vision—physical vision keener than the norma—may be used for examining minute objects, such as chemical atoms, or the wave forms of electrical and other forces, or for studying such of the nature-spirits as use etheric matter for their lowest bodies—fairies, gnomes, brownies, and creatures of that ilk—very slightly increased tenseness of the nerves, caused by excitement, ill-health, drugs, alcohol, may bring these within sight."

 A plainer and simpler exhibition of irrelevant stuff in the religious sphere is certainly inconceivable. Every religious and philosophical treatise we own, emphatically condemus all narcotic applications causing intellectual deterioration and clearly explains the method of annihilating the material tendencies in min. Neither the non-appearance of material phenomena, nor the production of an etheric vision by nervous irritation or by intoxicating drugs, is the object aimed at in the teachings of our philosophy. The necessity to understand correctly the ephemeral nature of this material world by a philosphical analysis, is alone insisted on, otherwise, the coveted goal of salvation could be easily attained by sleep or by an intensification of the Theosophical process just described.

**दृश्यं नास्तीति बोधेन मनसो दृश्यमार्जनम्।  
सम्पन्नञ्चेत्तदुत्पन्ना पर निर्वाणनिर्वृतिः॥**

**जीवभावजगद्भावबाधे खात्मैव शिष्यते।  
नाप्रतीतिस्तयोर्बाधः किन्तु मिथ्यात्वनिश्चयः।  
नोचेत्सुषुप्ति मूर्च्छादौ मुच्येंतायत्नतो जनः॥**

 A bare reading of the passages quoted from the text is enough to convince us of the fact that the creations of Bramha mentioned therein are entirely different from the Theosophical brownies and gnomes of Mrs. Besant.

The ten wives of Dharma enumerated are explained as the various passages provided leading to Dharma, and their names themselves are too plain to demspl an explanation. The wife of Adharma is said to be Himsa or cruelty and their progeny is Anrita or untruth. Similarly every other creation detailed has its intelligent and understandable application.

 We have now arrived at an unmistakable classification of the main branches of Bramha's creation, to which the origin of every one of the characters in the Maha-bharata is distinctly traced. Unmindful therefore of the current interpretations or the would-be criticisms, let us proceed with our further enquiries in a spirit of hopefulness and courage. A good many characters are enumerated in the text, with their peculiar origin and relation to the classified species, but it would be sufficient here to notice a few important ones, for the purpose of clearly understanding the main idea conveyed by the Puranic style of their treatment.

 In the passages quoted above, we find that the origin of all the characters appearing in the Maha-bharata is traced to varieties of heavenly beings.

**मानुषेषु मनुष्येन्द्र सम्भूता ये दिवौकसः॥**

 The Devas and Asuras are described as having descended to the earth and taken the forms of rulers and chiefs and also as having continued their mutual animosities and quarrels here which finally led to the great battle at Kurukshetra. We have therefore to notice the significance of the main differences amongst themselves in the two different planes and of their appropriate relationship subsisting between the higher and the lower spheres. The general classifications of Devas and Asuras have been examined in detail as far as possible in the previous chapters. The following passage from the text itself will doubtless add to our conviction as to the correctness of the interpretation already given.

**व्यापकं सर्वभूतेषु वर्तते दीपवन्मनः।

**शान्तिपर्व॥**

 From the above quotation we obtain a very reasonable and simple explanation as to the ideas expressed by the words Devas and Asuras. The nature of the former is said to be Satwic and that of the latter is Rajasic and Tamasic. The former tends to the progress of Tapas and the latter to its obstruction. The satwic mind and Intellect are known as Devas.

**सत्वं देवगुणं विद्यादितरावासुरौ गुणौ।  
सत्वं मनस्तथा बुद्धिर्द्देवा इत्यभिशब्दिताः।  
तपो ह्यधिष्ठितं देवै स्तपोघ्नमसुरैस्तमः॥**

 That which produces light or knowledge is called Tapas and it has to be secured by the annihilation of Rajas and Tamas, that is by the destruction of the Asuras.

**प्रकाशस्तपसो ज्ञानं लोके संशब्दितं तपः।  
रजस्तमोघ्नं यत्कर्म तपसस्तत्स्वलक्षणम्॥**

 In Puranic descriptions, nights and darkness represent sin and impurity, and the holy town is the blissful spot free from these defects. Nivriti On involutionary process is Dharma, Vyakta is mortality and Avyakta is the Eternal Vishnu, whom the wise and the sinless attain to.

**निशादिका ये कथिता लोकानां कलुषा मताः।  
तैर्हीनं यत्पुरं शुद्धं बाह्याभ्यन्तरवर्त्तिनम्।  
सदानन्दमयं नित्यं भूत्वा तत्परमन्वियात्।  
व्यक्तं मृत्युमुखं विद्यादव्यत्तममृतं पदम्।  
निवृत्तिलक्षणं धर्ममव्यक्तं ब्रह्मशाश्वतम्।**

**भगवन्तमजं दिव्यं विष्णुमव्यक्तसंज्ञितम्।  
भावेन यान्ति शुद्धा ये ज्ञानतृप्ता निराशिषः।**

 In the process known as kriya-yoga, the One appearing as the many is reduced to a few, such as Vasus and Rudra. ganas, and in the end by further reduction, the real One is perceived.

**क्रियायोगे च भेदाख्ये बहु संक्षिप्यते क्वचित्  
वसुरुद्रगणाद्येषु स्वानुभोगेन भोगतः।  
एवमेष परः सत्वो नानारूपेण संस्थितः।  
संक्षिप्तो दृश्यते पश्चादेकरूपेण विष्ठितः॥**

 The mankind is ever kept rotating like a wheel by the force of Desire. Desire acts with the thread of samsara, as theweaver’s shuttle attached to the thread works up a cloth. He alone therefore who differentiates Purusha, Prakriti and Vikaras or evolved products, and understands them in their true aspects, gets out of the meshes and becomes free.

**तृष्णाबद्धं जगत्सर्वंचक्रवत्परिवर्त्तते।  
सूच्या सूत्रं यथा वस्त्रे संसारयति वायकः।  
तद्वत्संसारसूत्रं हि तृष्णासूज्या निबध्यते।  
विकारं प्रकृतिञ्चैव पुरुषञ्च सनातनम्।  
यो यथावद्विजानाति स वितृष्णो विमुच्यते॥**

 The explanations noticed here clearly place before our view, the most valuable and scientific processes practised and promulgated by the Rishis of old, with a view to save mankind from its:endless bondage. The innumerable material conceptions each man is forced to carry with him and which produce constant worry and misfortunes, are required to be practically reduced by philosophical analysis to their fewer fundamental sources or causes such as Vasus and Rudra-ganas. The eight Vasus

and eleven Rudras as representing specific psychological facts have been explained in the previous chapters. In the performance of this difficult analysis and reduction, the Asuras will appear as obstructors, and they have to be boldly met in regular warfare and destroyed completely with the help of the Devas. Harder work has to be accomplished by still further involutionary processes, to arrive at the Avyakta-Bramhan which is the same as Vishnu. This is more or less the substance of all our religious stories,detailing practical instructious for the ultimate attainment of the summumbonum of human existence.

**एतावदेतत् विज्ञानमेतदस्ति च नास्ति च।**

 A plainer description of this most important and serious subject is neither possible nor necessary. In our sacred religious texts therefore, there is no human history treating of the life or exploits of a comparatively insignificant deceased monarch; nor is there the geographical description of a narrow strip of land on the surface of this material earth where the said ruler displayed his evanescent human greatness. No true Hindu poet will stoop to perpetuate by his poem the life of a human being however great he might appear in the estimation of the general public. It is a prohibited work and the poet will be condemned in the literary circle. The Rishis would be unhesitatingly acknowledged as holding far higher and more honourable position than that of the greatest of poets. The modern types of critics in the land who thoughtlessly attribute the author. ship of human histories to the ancient Rishis are therefore more innocent than foreigners, in the knowledge of their own affairs. Our local civilized gentlemen have invariably forgotten their own mother tongue in their era lition in foreign languages. They have also sadly forgotten the

local customs and habits in. their mania for foreign substitutes especially of an inartistic kind, unsuited to local requirements. and uncared for in foreign countries themselves. Instead of maintaining by a wise policy of noninterference, the grand position thus obtained far above the level of their inferior countrymen, some of them unforunately have turned rornfrom thatheight against their own kith and kin and bayun to eddlie with the country's sacred religion, which they have long neglected, despised and virtually relinquished. Surely this is more than the most patientcould bear.

**रूक्षस्याऽमधुरस्य चाऽतिमलिनछायस्य धृष्टस्य च  
क्षुद्रस्य क्षतकारिणोऽतिचपलस्याह्लादविछेदिनः।  
येयं निम्बफलेषु काक भवतस्तिक्तेषु नैसर्गिकी  
प्रीतिस्तत्सदृशं विधेर्विलसितं निष्पन्नमेताच्चिरात्॥**

 Having thus far noticed in detail the general significance of the Devas and the Asuras as introduced in the text, a cursory examination of some of their classifications speci fied in the passages quoted, may suffice for our present purpose.

 The chief characters such as, Jarasandha, Sisupala Salya, Dhrishtaketu, Ugrasena, Salwa, Brihadratha, Chandravarma, Rishika, Kasi-raja, Pandya-raja, Derada, Dentavaktra, Rukmni and Kamsa are said to be the transformations of Asuras aud Danavas. Sakuni represents Dwapara andDuryodhana stands for Kali. The hundred brothers of Duryodhana are described as the reappearance of Pulastyas or the Rakshasas conneeted with Ravana of the Ramayana. Drona comes from Brihaspathi, Aswastama from Mahadeva and Antaka. Bhishma represents the youngest of the Vasus. Devaka and Dhritarashtra descend from Gantharvas. Krips is from Ra fragma. Satyaki, Drapıda, Kriti-varma, Virata, anl Panda are from Marut-gana. Yu lhishtira and

Vidura are from Dharma, Bhima from Vayu, Arjuna from Indra and Nakula and Sahadeva from the Aswins. Abhimanyu is from Varcha son of Soma. Drishta-dyumna and Sikhandi are from Agni or fire. The five sons of Droupadi are from Viswandeva-gana, Karna from the sun; Vasudeva is Narayana, Beladeva is Sesha or Ananta and Prelyumna is Sanat-kumara. The sixteen thousand Devess or wives of Krishna represent the Apsara-gana. Rukmini is Lekshmi and Droupadi is from Indrani.

 Kunti the mother of the Pandavas represents Sidhi or attainment of yoga; and Malri stands for Dhriti or resolution or self-command. Gandhari the mother of the Kurus represents mathi or mind or desire.

 Thus in the classification of the species of characters introduced in the text, we find, Danavas, Asuras, Dwapara, Kali, Pulastyas, Brihaspati, Mahadeva and Antaka, Vasus, Rudra-gana, Marut-gana, Dharma, Vayu, Indra, Aswins, Varcha, Agni, Viswa-deva-gar, Narayana, Sisha, Sanatkumara, Apsara -gana, Lekshuni, Indraui, Sidhi, Dhriti and Mathi.

 The observations made above with regard to the formations of the chief characters, will, it is confi lently hoped amply suffice to convince every reader, who could be creditedwith sympathy, sincerity and reason, of the probability of arriving at the correct interpretation, if the present method of enquiry is followed in close touch with the text itself, without being pazzled or led astray by the mere charmfor the grand names of modern crities, who have neither take the necessary trouble, nor noticed the real clues for the correct un lerstanding of the subject as a whole. Our interest in the matter is entirely of a different type, and no one has any reason to complain against our anxiety to be benefited by seeking for the truths and religious instruc-

tions lying under-neath. In going through the very first Parva of the text, several matters of this kind have been already enquired into, more fully than the scope of this little essay would permit. We must therefore proceed with more than the present speed.

 **7. ***Summary of the epic as given in the text.* Leaving out for the present the collateral anecdotes and the descriptive details with which the text is elaborated, it is desirable to form a clear idea of the main story as mentioned in the Maha-bharata itself. This will no doubt direct our chief attention to the discovery of some cogent meaning for the important portion of the story as running through the central threat of the narrative. It is not very unlikely that careful examination of the modern criticisms might even disclose, that the critic, in spite of his vehement attacks, has missed to notice this simple matter.

 "O. king! I shall narrate to you, how the quarrel arose between the Pandavas and the Kurus for the Kingdom, how the gambling took place ending in the banishinent, of the Pandavas to the forest, and how the great battle was fought causing total destruction on both sides. After the death of Pandu, the Pandavas well-versed in archery aud learning returned home from the forest. Duryodhana, Karna, Sakuni and other Kurus grew jealous of them and began to tease them in various ways with the object of depriving them of their claims to the Kingdom. Duryodhana poisoned Bhima but he was not affected by the poison. When Bhima was sleeping in Premana-Koti, he was bound up and thrown into the Ganges, but when he woke up he released himselfeasily. Again when he was asleep, serpents were caused to bite him all over the body which also did not hurt him. They were forced afterwards with the permission of Dhritarashtra to remove themselves to a house built of wax and other combustible substances, where they lived for one year. At,the advice of Vidura, they escaped with their mother, by an under-ground passage, setting fire to the house in which Purochana its keeper was burnt up. In the forest they met a Rakshasa named Hidimba whom they killed and Bhima married Hindimbaa who gave birth to a son named Ghatotkacha. Then they went to the village named Ekachakra where Bhima destroyed Beka and saved the villagers. Having heard of the proposal of the marriage of Panchali, they went to the Panchalas, obtained her in marriage and lived there for one year. Then they returned to Hastinapura and at the request of Dhritarashtra and Bhishma removed themselves to Khandava-Prestha where they lived for several years. Then for some special reason, Yudhishtira sent Arjuna to the forest who remained there for one

year and one month. During this time he visited several holy centres and obtained in marriage a Naga woman and the daughter of Pandya Raja. He then went to Dwaraka and married Subhadra, sister of Sri Krishna. He burnt down the Khandava forest and obtained from Agni the great bow named Gandeva with the quiver and arrows, as well as a ear with the emblem of Hanumat. Arjuna saved Maya from the fire and he constructed a grand Sabha or Assembly Hall for the Pandavas. Duryodhana coveted this building and deceived Yudhishtira through Sakuni In the gambling. The Pandavas were then compelled to live in the forest for twelve years and another year without being known to anyone. In the fourteenth year they applied for their share in the kingdom which being refused, the war began. In the battle Duryodhana was killed along with all the Kshethriyas, and the Pandavas ruled over the Kingdom. They performed Aswa-medhas and several other sacrifices, and when Dhritarashtra and Vidura died, they performed their funeral ceremonies. Afterwards. when Sri Krishna left the earth and returned to Heaven, they protected his wives and started to the forest from which they also finally returned to Heaven."

 From the above narration of the mainstory, we find, that after the death of Pandu in the forest the Pandavas returned home greatly skilled in literature and warfare. The Kurus grew jealous of their attainments and attempted their destruction in various ways. They commenced their evil work with Bhima whom they first poisoned, but he was not hurt. Then they threw him into the Ganges while sleeping in Pramana-koti, but when he awoke, he safely got ashore. Black serpents were afterwards procured which bit him all over his body while sleeping. Bhims was not however injured. Thus we see that the story starts with

attempts against Bhima's life. This itself is somewhat significant, as Bhima is represented as the son of Vayu. The place named Pramana-koti, where he is said to have been sleeping deserves notice, and the black serpents that bit him are not probably meaningless. Pramana-koti literally means, the extremity of a scale or measure. The Ganges has been long noticed as representing the sushumna nadi. Thus the whole description appears to refer to the practice of yoga at the Muladhar-chakra with the help of Pranayama, the black serpents being the tamasic thoughts, which invariably rush in at the time causing obstruction to yoga.  
Similarly the waxen house and the Khandava forest which were burnt down refer to some obstructive items demanding destruction. The Eka-chakra village in which the Pandavas had to live for some time, is suggestive of some technical item by the very name, and the Rakshasa named Beka whom Bhima killed there, has been already noticed me representing Pride. The marriage of Panchali and the significance of that name may be dealt with somewhat fully later on. Maya, the architect who was saved by Arjuns, in the Khandava fire, is said to have constructed a Sabba for the Pandavas which created the jealonsy of Duryodina. Yudhishtira was then iduced to play at dice with the Kurus where he lost everything. In this connection it may be interesting to note that Sabha itself means a gambling house, especially as it was constructed by the Asura architect, and that the word Aksha used to denote gambling, gives the clue for the subsequent exile in the forest. ततोक्षैर्वच्चयित्वा॥The Akshas plainly refer to the senses and the play or gambling therefore denotes their domination in the material world. The exile for twelve or thirteen years, the subsequent battle at Kuru-kshetra and the final ascension to heaven, all demand more than a passing remark, and they shall be

taken up again in their respective places. In the meantime, we may note even in the above quotation, that the result of the battle is described as the extinction of the kshetrom.

**ततस्ते क्षत्रमुत्साद्य हत्वा दुर्योधनं नृपम्।**  
**राज्यं विहतभूयिष्ठं प्रत्यपद्यन्त पाण्डवाः॥**

 It is hoped that the previous remarks on Bramhakhetrom are not by this time entirely forgotten. In the light of our simple interpretations, as guided by the clues from the texts themselves, we can clearly perceive that the main story as a whole, does not savour of a historical description. The claims set forth for a kingdom, the loss of it by gambling or other evil incident, the consequent exile in the forest, a subsequent battle and victory, a righteous rule and the final ascension to heaven, are more or less the general incidents in the Maha-bharata and the Ramayana as well as in the Nala-charitra. We have therefore better reasons to start with a belief in the probable correctness of our method of interpretation, rather than to respect without proper proof the views of modern pandits and critics, expressed without any reason whatever, except perhaps induced by the natural presumption and prejudice against everything holy and divine so commonly prevailing in the present state of our affairs.

** 8**. *The origin of the Pandavas, Kurus and their teachers. Panchali's marriage, destruction of Beka, settlement at Indra-prestha and the burning of the Khandava Forest.*

 Having thus far dealt with the subject almost confining to introductory observations and warnings against future mistakes, it is now convenient to run over the text in the order of Parvas into which it is divided. The Adi-parva

from which most of the above quotations have been taken, further contains detailed descriptions regarding the following important matters.

 a. The stories connected with the origin of some of the illustrious ancestors of the Pandavas and the Kurus.

 b. The origin of the five Pandavas and a hundred Kurus, also, of Panchali and her marriage.

 c. The origin of Drona, Kripa, Dhowmya &c.

 d. The destruction of Beka at Eka-chakra.

 e. The Pandavas' obtaining half the country and settling at Indra-prastha.

 f. The destruction of the Khandava forest. The descriptions given in the text may be dealt with in the above order.

**ययातिर्न्नाहुषः सम्राडासीत्सत्यपराक्रमः।**  
**तस्य पुत्राःमहेष्वासाः सर्वैः समुदिता गुणैः।**  
**देवयान्यामजायेतां यदुस्तुर्वसुरेव च।**  
**द्रुह्युश्चानुश्च पूरुश्च शर्मिष्ठायाश्च जज्ञिरे।**  
**यदुं च तुर्वसु चोभौ द्रुह्यंचैव सहानुजम्।**  
**अन्तेषु स विनिक्षिप्य नाहुषः स्वात्मजान् सुताम्।**  
**दत्वा च पूरवे राज्यं वनवासाय दीक्षितः।**  
**पुरात्स निर्ययौ राजा सभार्थस्तव उत्तमम्।**  
**यदोस्तु यादवा जातास्तुर्वसोर्यवनाः स्मृताः।**  
**द्रुह्योः सुतास्तु वै भोजा अनोस्तु म्लेछजातयः।**  
**पूरोस्तु पौरवो वंशो यत्र जातोसि पार्थिव॥**

 Those interested in obtaining more details are referred to the text itself. It is sufficient here to notice the portions likely to furnish clues to a reasonable explanation of the subject. Yayathi, the son of Nahusha is said to have married two wives, Devayani the daughter of Sukra and

Sarmishta the daughter of Vrishaparva the king of the Asuras. Two sons named Yadu and T urvasu were born of Devayani and three by Sarmishta named Druhyu, Anu and Puru. The four elder sons having disobeyed the father, the youngest Puru was offered the throne. Yayati then left to the forest for tapas with his two wives. Yadu's descendants are known as Yadavas; Turvasus; Yavanas; Druhyus's Bhojas; and Anu's Mlechas. Thesuccessors of Pu ru became the Pouravas forming the main line of the dynasty.

 Thus far the story is plain enough on a superficial view. But if we look into it a little deeper, insurmount-table difficulties present themselves before us. The king of he Asuras and their preceptor Suk ra are both described as fathers-in-law of Yayati. How could this corroborate the interpretation of the story as human history, except by condemning the whole in the usual manner, as interpolation or poetical fancy? These are probably the only two methods provided as yet in this material world, for the purpose of reviewing a subject without its study. No modern author of any literary or scientific subject would however brook such a criticisin, wheresoever it may proceed from. Such criticisms may therefore be boldly ignored in going through the productions of our venerable Rishis. Every proper name introduced in the quotation has its technical meaning, an examination of which is sure to disclose the superfluity and presumptuousness of the current remarks.

**निरुक्तम्॥**

**यदवः।यमुउपरमे। यम्यते नियम्यते आचार्येण अपयवृत्ताः।**

 "Directed by the Guru from the wrong path to the right and hence called Yadavas".

 तुर्षशाः॥तुर्वीहिंसायां। हिंसन्तिप्राणिनः। हिंस्यन्तेव्याप्यादिभिर्वा।चतुर्षु धर्मार्थकाममोक्षेषु वश एषामिति चतुर्वशाः सन्तः चकारलोपेन तुर्दशाः॥

 "Referring to cruel treatment towards living creatures, or being cruelly treated by disease etc, or also being subject to Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha they are called Turvasus."

 द्रुह्यवः॥द्रुहजिघांसायां द्रोहम्परेषामिच्छन्ति। परहिंसारुचयोहिप्रायेण मनुष्याः॥

 "Longing for the injury of others and hence Druhyus."

 अनवः॥अन-प्राणने, ज्ञानवत्वादेतेषां धर्माद्यनुष्ठानात् प्राणनस्य फलवत्वात् अनन्तीत्युच्यन्ते। इतरे पश्वादयो ज्ञानहीनत्वात् निष्फलप्राणनाः॥

 "Applying to man as a living creature, as distinguished from the remaining animals devoid of knowledge and therefore not reckoned as living."

 पूरवः॥पूरयितव्याः कामनां। पूताःशुद्धाःस्नानार्त्थिभिः इत्यर्थः॥

 " Becoming pure by holy baths &c. are Purus."

 The names Deva-yani and Sarmishta probably denote two opposite tendencies, the former referring to Deva-yana or heavenly path, being the daughter of Sukra, and the latter to material happiness, being the daughter of an Asura king. Yayati denotes the capacity to go in all directons.

 Without searching for further explanations we may proceed with the next story of Dushyanta. He married Sakuntala in the forest and a son named Bharata was born of her, from whom the family is said to have afterwardstaken its name Bharata-vamsa. The well-known natak of Kalidasa called the Sakuntala, celebrates this story. Sakuntala is said to have been the daughter of Viswamitra by Menaka who was sent down by Indra to disturb the sage's austerities. Menaka left her child in a solitary forest where it was taken care of by Sakuntas or birds and hence the name Sakuntala. The child was found by the sage Kanva

and brought up as his own daughter in his hermitage. Dushyanta a descendant of Puru went to this hermitage, pursuing a deer while hunting in the forest. Sakuntala was met by him seated lonely and he fell in love with her. He then married her at the spot in accordance with the gantharva form of marriage and returued to the capital. Then a son named Bharata was born in the hermitage. When the boy was six years of age, Sakuntala at the instance of Kanva, went to Dushyanta with her son. For fear of public scandal Dushyanta at first denied all knowledge of having married Sakuntala, but when a heavenly voice told him that she was his lawful wife, he accepted both the mother and the son. After his long rule, when he retired to the forest in his old age, Bharata succeeded to the throne. The story as told in the text is not less interesting than the famous play of Kalidasa. Full reading of the text will not be a waste of time, as it will be evident from the very simple method of narration in the commonest Anushtup metre, what command the ancient authors possessed over the sanskrit language. The description given above is themain outline of the famous story of Sakuntala, so far as the popular idea of the whole matter is concerned; and the same story is the basis for the Puranic conceptionof Bharatavamsa as connected with the birth of Bharata in Kanva's. hermitage. It is with the latter however that the Panditas well as the modern critic are interested, and they have been utilising their individual ingenuities to explain the import of the story, without caring to see whether the names introduced in the narrative contain in themselves anything worth noting, in spite of the explanations furnished in the text itself for some of them. The name Sakuntala is said to be derived from sakuntas or birds which took care of the child while lying in the forest.

**शयानं शयने रम्ये मेनका वाक्यमव्रवीत्।**  
**महर्षेरुग्रतपसस्तेजस्त्वमसि भामिनी।**  
**तं वने विजने गर्भ सिंहव्याघ्रसमाकुले।**  
**दृष्ट्वा शयानंशकुनाः समन्तात्पर्यवारयन्।**  
**नेमां हिंस्युर्वने बालां क्रव्यादामांसगृद्धिभिः।**  
**अब्रुवन् शकुनाःसर्वे कलं मधुरभाषिणः।**  
**विश्वामित्रसुतां ब्रह्मन्यासभूतां भरख वै।**  
**कामक्रोधावजितवान् सखा ते कौशिकीं गतः।**  
**तस्मात्पोषय तत्पुत्रीं दयावानिति तेऽब्रुवन्।**  
**निर्जने तु वने यस्माच्छकुन्तैः परिवारिता।**  
**शकुन्तलेति नामास्याः कृतं चापि ततो मया॥**

 Sakuntala is here described as the spirit or energy of Viswamitra, and in the Puranic descriptions the birds generally refer to Akshas or dice and also therefore to Akshas or the senses.

**उत्पतन्तः खगा वाक्यमेतदाहुस्ततो नलम्।**  
**वयमक्षा सुदुर्बुद्धे तब वासोजिहीर्षवः।**  
**आगता न हि नः प्रीतिःसवाससि गते त्वयि॥**

**                        वनपर्व॥**

 The Akshas in the form of birds are said to have taken away the clothing of king Nala from his body while roaming in the forest, forcing him to go naked. We can clearly perceive that Sakuntala is thus connected with the senses by some specific philosophical relation. The term Bharats as referring to Karma-yoga has been explained in detail in the previous chapters. Its root-meaning from Bhar, to support, indicating the power of supporting man or saving him from perdition is not omitted even in the present description.

**तस्माद्भरस्व दुष्यन्त पुत्रं शाकुन्तलंनृप।**  
**सुभूतिरेषा न त्याज्या जीवितं जीवयात्मजम्॥**

**शाकुन्तलं महात्मानं दुष्यन्त भर पौरवम्।**  
**भर्त्तव्यायं त्वया यस्मादस्माकं वचनादपि।**  
**तस्माद्भवत्वयं नाम्ना भरतो नाम ते सुतः।**  
**भरताद्भारती कीर्त्तिर्येनेदं भारतं कुलम्।**  
**अपरे ये व पूर्वे च भारता इति तेऽभवन्॥**

  The word Subhuti here is worth noting as meaning both a son and the yogic power as applied to Bharata. Viswamitra represents manana or Meditation and philosophising, and Kanva literally means intelligence. Menaka has been long noticed as one of the processes of yoga.

**मेनस्य मेनका कन्या ब्रह्मणो हृष्टचेतसः।**  
**सर्वाश्च ब्रह्मवादिन्यो महायोगाश्च ताः स्मृताः॥**

 Sakuntala the mother of Bharata is thus the production of Viswamitra and Menaka combined. It is connected with some preparatory training of the senses, Akshas or birds, and fostered by Kanva or developed by the intellect. Bharata or Karma-yoga has to be created and started by Sakuntala. The whole of the explanation here given is the simple result of gathering the meanings of each term used, and is not derived from any far-fetched imagination. Bharata is said to have been in the womb of his mother for three full years. This is no ordinary incident in human life.

**त्रिषु वर्षेषु पूर्णेषु प्रजायत शकुन्तला।**  
**रूपोदार्यगुणोपेतं दौष्यन्तिं जनमेजय।**  
**त्रिषु वर्षेषु पूर्णेषु प्रजातोयमरिन्दमः।**  
**अद्यायं मन्नियोगात्तु तवाह्वानं प्रतीक्षते॥**

 In his sixth year Bharata is described to have been able to meet Asuras, lions and other wild animals.

**षड्वर्षेषु ततो बालः कण्वाश्रमपदं प्रति।**  
**व्याघ्रान् सिंहान् वराहांश्च वृकांश्च महिषान् तथा।**

**बध्या वृक्षेषु दौष्यन्तिराश्रमस्य समन्ततः।**  
**आरुरोह द्रुमांश्चैव क्रीडन् स परिधावति।**  
**ततश्चराक्षसान् सर्वान् पिशाचांश्च रिपून् रणे।**  
**मुष्टियुद्धेन तान् हत्वा ऋषीनाराधयत्तदा॥**

 Sakuntala could travel in the higher regions of Indra Varuna &c, and which woman or man in human history is capable of performing such feats?

**क्षितौ चरसि राजन् त्वमन्तरिक्षे चराम्यहम्।**  
**महेन्द्रस्य कुबेरस्य यमस्य वरुणस्य च।**  
**भवनान्यनुसंयामि प्रभावं पश्य मे नृप॥**

 If therefore the current interpretations as human history should still be established, every term used in the text should be ignored with its plain derivative meaning, and every description should be declared an interpolation or exaggeration. But were is the authority to decry everything mentioned within the text and what is the reason to overlook the clues and definitions specially funished therein? Let the readers consider for themselves the substance and value of the interpretations and criticisms offered after such eliminations. If they still appear to be acceptable to any one, it must be confessed that they could neither be in the interest of our religion nor in favour of our national prestige. How much importance could be attributed to Bharata as a mere son of Sakuntala a woman of the forest, and born of a king while he went ahunting? Taking the incidents narrated as they are, they appear to possess no special excellence in the general plot of the composition, nor to serve any useful purpose for a Hindu as a religious reading or a moral lesson. Every townsman must get enamoured of a woman in the forest if he should become a gentleman, is perhaps the direct moral teaching conveyed by the story. It is strange that opinions in regard to such subjects are

somehow formed without forethought and even retained without afterthought.

**प्राक्पादयोः पतति खादति पृष्ठमांसम्**  
**कर्णे कलं किमपि रौति शनैर्विचित्रम्।**  
**छिद्रं निरूप्य सहसा प्रविशत्यशङ्कः**  
**सर्वं खलस्य चरितं मशकः करोति॥**

 We have seen from the passage here quoted that the illustrious Bharata-vamsa starts with Bharata son of Sakuntala, and this seems to be admitted on all hands without further dispute.

**भरताद्भारतीकीर्ति र्येनेदं भारतं कुलम्।**

 His predecessors are also styled Bharatas only from this very fact.

**अपरे ये च पूर्वे च भारता इति तेऽभवन्।**

 The next important name in the narrative is that of Kuru from whom similarly the Kuru-vamsa took its name- He is said to have been the son of Samvarana and Tapati daughter of the Sun. During the reign of Samvarana a great famine extending to twelve years took place. He fled from the country, being overcome by the Panchalas and concealed himself for a thousand years in the western countries. He got back his kingdom afterwards with the help of the sage Vasishta. His son Kuru built Kuru-kshetromby his penance.

**ततः संवरणात्सौरी तपती सुषुदेकुरुम्।**  
**राजत्वे तं प्रजाः सर्वा धर्मज्ञ इति वव्रिरे।**  
**महिम्नातस्य कुरवो लेभिरे प्रत्ययं भृशम्।**  
**तस्य नाम्नाभिविख्यातं पृथिव्यां कुरुजाङ्गलम्।**  
**कुरुक्षेत्रं स तपसा पुण्यं चक्रेमहातपाः॥**

 The whole story is specially interesting and noteworthy. The wife of Samvarana and mother of Kuru is said to be

the daughter of the sun named Tapati. Vasishta obtained her from the Sun to be married to Samvarana

**ततः सर्वानवद्याङ्ग तपतीं तपनः वयम्।**  
**ददौ संवरणस्यार्थे वसिष्ठाय महात्मने।**  
**प्रतिजग्राह तां कन्यां महर्षिस्तपती तदा।**  
**वसिष्ठोथ विसृष्टस्तु पुनरेवाजगाम ह।**  
**तस्यां सजनयामास कुरुं संवरणो नृपः।**  
**तपत्यां तपतां श्रेष्ठ तापत्यस्त्वं ततोर्जुन॥**

 Let us now look into the meanings of the terms used here. Panchala refers to Sastras in general including both karma-kanda and gnana.kanda, the Dakshins and the Uttara Panchalas.

** पञ्चानां विषयाणाम्अन्यतो अनवगतानां प्रकाशनाय अलं इति पाञ्चालं शास्त्रम्॥**

**पितृहूर्दक्षिणः कर्णः उत्तरो देवहूस्मृतः।**  
**प्रवृत्तञ्चनिवृत्तञ्चशास्त्रं पाञ्चालसंज्ञितम्॥**

 Samvarana denotes retired or secluded state, particularly by the subjugation of the senses. The Panchalas' overcoming Samvarana and the latter's flight and concealment as well as his regaining the kingdom and marriage of Tapati by the intervention of sage Vasishta, are all relevantly significant. With the above definitions of terms, it would not be difficult to see that Kuru and Kuru-kshetra signify important factors connected with karma-yoga proper. Tapati the mother of Kuru clearly points to Tapas. Vasishta's going to the regions of the sun and obtaining his daughter from there to be married to Samvarana on the earth, are detailed in as plain a language as possible. It has therefore yet to be divined how this is going to be converted into human history. The sun and his daughter should perhaps be eliminated altogether by some ingenious criticism to

establish the purely human character of Kuru. Without so much trouble, it might be more easy to eliminate Kuru himself and the stories in the text as a whole. What harm is there if this is done? It would be a very wise act and would save so much criticism. It would indeed be wiser still if the critic eliminates himself from all this profitless and thankless task and save the poor religious folk from unnecessary confusion. Besides the common name of Soma-vamsa, we have now seen how the same dynasty took special names such as, Pourava, Bharata and Kuru signifying definite scientific facts, instead of meaningless irrelevancies.

 b. We may now proceed with the origin of the Pandavas and the hundred Kurus directly connected with the main story. It is better to trace two or three generations backwards to obtain a clear idea of the subject. We may start with the orign of Santanu and his son Bhishma, as both of them are known to be important characters in the Maha-bharata. Santanu is described to have been originally a king of the Sury-vamsa, named Maha-bhishak. While he was enjoying swarga, he was cursed to be reborn for having looked at Ganga in her naked form. At his own choice he came down as tho son of Pratipa in the Soma-vamsa. Ganga also returned from swarga thinking of Maha-bhishak and therefore became the wife of Santanu. In the meantime the eight Vasus were cursed by Vasishta to be born on the earth for having interfered with his celebrated cow named Nandini the daughter of Kasyapa. During their down-fall from the heavens, they met Ganga returning from swarga and prayed to her to be their mother in their rebirth. She consented and the eight Vasus were born of of her by Santanu, but the first seven, she killed immediately after their birth. At the request of Santanu, she saved the eighth son but left Santanu finally for having violated a

vow for noninterference with her conduct. The last son was the Vasu named Dyu who actually took Vasishta's cow and thus perpetrated the crime. He was therefore ordered to remain long on the earth by Vasishta, and he became the famous Bhishma in the great Epic. This is the substance of the narrative in ordinary plain language. But a reference to the points in particular must strike every thinking man of their inapplicability to human affairs. Without further comments therefore, the technical meanings that may be gathered conveniently from the names themselves, may be carefully enquired into. Maha-bhishak, Pratipa, Santanu and Dyu are particularly noteworthy, irrespective of the connections of Ganga and the Vasus. Maha-bhishak points to the great remedy sought for overcoming the worldly miseries. Pratipa denotes the tendency to turn back or nivriti-marga Santanu represents the peaceful state of mind attained by the subjugation of the senses. Dyu literally means brightness, fire or light. Santanu is said to be so named because he was born after his father Pratipa attained peacefulness of mind.

**प्रतीपस्य सुतो राजा शान्तनुर्लोकविश्रुतः।**  
**शान्तस्य जज्ञेसन्तानस्तस्मादासीत्स शान्तनुः।**  
**संस्मरंश्चाक्षयांल्लोकान्विजातान् स्वेन कर्मणा।**  
**पुण्यकर्मकृदेवासीच्छान्तनुः कुरुसत्तमः॥**

 Nandini the cow of Vasishta represented as the daughter of Surabhi or virtue and grand daughter of Deksha, refers to Ananda or divine happiness the result of devotion and Tapas. The drinking of this cow's milk makes man young and live for ten thousand years.

**दक्षस्य दुहिता या तु सुरभीत्यभिशब्दिता।**  
**गां प्रजाता तु सा देवी कश्यपाद्भरतर्षभ।**  
**नन्दिनीं नाम राजन्द्रे सर्वकामधुगुत्तमाम्।**

**अस्याः क्षीरं पिबेन्मर्त्यः खाद्रु यो वै सुमध्यमे।**  
**दशवर्षसहस्राणि स जीवेत्स्थिरयौवनः।**

 The son of Santanu by Ganga, by his devotion and celebacy became Bhishma the terrible. He is said to be blessed with the power of retaining life as long as he wants. His name is Deva-vratha and represents Bhakti-yoga.

**स तु देवव्रतो नाम गाङ्गेय इति चाभवत्।**  
**अद्य प्रभृति मे दाश ब्रह्मचर्ये भविष्यति।**  
**अपुत्रस्यापि मे लोका भविष्यन्त्यक्षया दिवि।**  
**परित्यजाम्यहं राज्यं मैथुनं चापि सर्वशः।**  
**ऊर्ध्वरेता भविष्यामि दाश सत्यं ब्रवीमि ते।**  
**ततोन्तरिक्षेऽप्सरसो देवाः सर्विगणास्तदा।**  
**अभ्यवर्षन्त कुसुमैः भीष्मोयमिति चाब्रुवन्।**  
**तछश्रुत्वा दुष्करं कर्म कृतं भीष्मेण शान्तनुः।**  
**स्वच्छन्दमरणं तुष्टो ददौ तस्मै महात्मने॥**

 Besides the river Ganga, Santanu is said to have married another wife named Satyavathi. Her story and origin are specially interesting as they contain technicalities worthy of notice. She is described to have been originally the mind-born daughter of the Pitris called Berhishadas, and she having mistakenly considered Uparichara Vasu and his wife Adrika as her real parents, incurred the displeasure of her real fathers. She had therefore to be born as the daughter of the Vasu, in the womb of a fish at the confluence of Ganga and Yamuna. The fish was caught by a fisherman and she was taken out of it along with a brother who afterwards became the king of the Matsyas. She was given back to the fisherman who brought her up as his own. daughter, having been issueless himself. The fisherman's duty was to ply the ferry boat across the Jumna and she was entrusted with this work when she grew up. While

engaged in this duty she was met by sage Parasara who became emamoured of her and begot Vyasa in the island close by. The child was immediately born and attained to seven years of age at once and was named Krishna Dwipayana. After the birth of the son, she became & virgin again by the grace of the Rishi. She was afterwards married by Santanu and known by the name of Satyavathi. She had two sons named Chitrangada and Vichitraveerya the former died young and the latter married two wives Ambika and Ambalika, but died issueless soon. At the request of Satyavathy, her previous son Vyasa begot Dhrita-rashtra on Ambika and Pandu on Ambalika. Thus runs the narrative from Santanu to the Pandavas and Kurus. There are however no possibilities of explaining the incidents detailed here, as events occurring in human life. Satyavati is described to be originally the mind-born daughter of the Pitris called Berhishadas, known as Achoda from whom a divine river of the same name originated. It is stated that she has not seen her own fathers and her fall from *yoga* is attributed to her having mistaken the Vasu and Adrika to be her parents.

**बर्हिषदइति ख्याताः पितरः सोमपास्तु ते।**  
**तेषां त्वं मानसी कन्या अछोदा नाम विश्रुता।**  
**अछोदं नाम तद्दिव्यं सरो यस्मात्समुत्थितम्।**  
**त्वया न दृष्टपूर्वास्तु पितरस्ते कदाचन।**  
**सम्भूता मनसा तेषां पितॄन् स्वान्नाभिजानती।**  
**सा त्वन्यं पितरं वव्रे स्वानतिक्रम्य ताम् पितॄन्।**  
**नाम्ना वसुरिति ख्यातं मनुपुत्रं दिवि स्थितम्।**  
**अद्रिकाप्सरसा युक्तंविमाने दिवि विष्ठितम्।**  
**सा तेन व्यभिचारेण मनसा कामचारिणी।**  
**पितरं प्रार्थयित्वान्यं योगभ्रष्ठा पपात सा॥**

 According to Niruktom, बर्हिषत् means महान् The two aspects of Mahan or universal Intelligence are determination and reflection or fancy.

**महान् सृष्टिं विकुरुते चोद्यमानः सिसृक्षया।**  
**संकल्पोध्यवसायश्च तस्य वृत्तिद्वयं स्मृतम्।**  
**धर्मादीनि च रूपाणि लोकतत्वार्थहेतवः।**  
**त्रिगुणन्तु स विज्ञेयः सत्वराजस तामसः**  
**परिमण्डलं तछ्शुषिरं आकाशं शब्दलक्षणम्।**  
**शब्दमात्रं तदाकाशं सर्वमावृत्य तिष्ठति।**  
**तं तु शब्दगुणं तस्य भूतादिः प्रसते पुनः।**  
**भूतादिंग्रसते चापि महान् वै बुद्धिलक्षणः।**  
**महानात्मा तु विज्ञेयः सङ्कल्पो व्यवसायकः।**  
**बुद्धिर्मनश्च लिङ्गश्च महानक्षर एव च।**  
**पर्यायवाचकैः शब्दैः तमाहुस्तत्वचिन्तकाः॥**

**                वायुपुराणम्॥**

 Thus we see that Berhishad refers to Budhi or mahan and the Vasu son of Manu to Samkalpa or reflection.

**बर्हिषद इतिख्याताः पितरः सोमपास्तु ते।**  
**नाम्ना वसुरिति ख्यातं मनुपुत्रं दिवि स्थितम्॥**

 The descent from the higher to the lower is meant by the down-fall described.

**पितरं प्रार्थयित्वान्यं योगभ्रष्टां पपात सा॥**

 Thus there is a deterioration from Achoda or pure water to satyavathy; satya-vat, resembling satya or Prakriti.

**प्रकृतिंसत्यमित्याहु र्विकारोऽनृतमुच्यते।**  
**तत्सद्भावोऽनृतं ज्ञेयं सद्भावः सत्यमुच्यते॥**

 We could now more or less see that in the capacity of the mother of Vyasa, analyser of the Vedas or in that of

the wife of Santanu, purified body, Satyavathi represents a lower stage of Prakriti more suited for karma-yoga than for gnana yoga. Satyavathy and Vyasa are therefore more prominent in the Maha-bharata than in the Ramayana. We may now pass on to Dhrita-rashtra and Pandu. Both of them are described as the sons of Vyasa himself. The Soma-vamsa virtually becomes extinct at this stage and takes a new form altogether. From Vyasa or analysis, Pandu, white or satwa is produced; or Panda, wisdom results. But the elder progeny is described as the blind Dhritarashtra, the significancə of which is worth enquiring.

**अरिष्टायास्तु यः पुत्रो हंस इत्यभिविश्रुतः।**  
**स गन्धर्वपतिर्ज्जज्ञे कुरुवंशविवर्द्धनः।**  
**धृतराष्ट्र इति ख्यातः कृष्णद्वैपायनात्मजः।**  
**दीर्घबाहुर्महातेजाःप्रज्ञाचक्षु र्न्नराधिपः।**  
**मातुर्दोषादृषेःकोपादन्ध एव व्यजायत॥**

 Dritarashtra is said to have been originally the king of the Gantharvas named Hamsa and born of mother Arishta. His present mother Ambika having incurred the displeasure of his father Vyasa, he was born blind. This is the Puranic description given in the text. The real explanation could be easily gathered from the meanings of the peculiar terms used. The king of the Gantharvas refers to imaginations or building castles in the air. Arishta literally means ill-luck-and Hamsa denotes egoisms or Ahamkara. Drita rashtra, signifies attachment to the rashtra, Vishayas or material affairs. Combining the parentage as caused by the great Vyasa, with the above ideas, we can clearly perceive that Dhrita-rashtra represents the state of mind filled with worldly desires although devoid of all external transactions. The blindness denotes complete ignorance of truth. The Bhagavat-gita is most explicit on this point.

**कर्मेन्द्रियाणि संयम्य य आस्ते मनसा स्मरन्।**  
**इन्द्रियार्थान् विमूढात्मा मिथ्याचारः स उच्यते।**  
**यस्त्विन्द्रियाणि मनसा नियम्यारभतेर्जुन।**  
**कर्मेन्द्रियैः कर्मयोगमसक्तः स विशिष्यते॥**

 Control of the senses by the mind is the process required for karma-yoga. But mere physical inaction without the subjugation of the senses, will not destroy mental mischief leading to utter ruin.

**ध्यायतो विषयान् पुंसः सङ्गस्तेषूपजायते।**  
**सङ्गात्सजायते कामः कामात् क्रोधोभिजायते।**  
**क्रोधाद्भवति सम्मोहः संमोहात् स्मृतिविभ्रमः।**  
**स्मृतिभ्रंशात् बुद्धिनाशो बुद्धिनाशात्प्रणश्यति॥**

 Mere thought of material affairs creates an attachment to them. Desire follows attachment, then anger, then confusion, then loss of memory and reason, and finally ruin. These are exactly the functions attributed to the blind Dhrita-rashtra prominently figuring in the text. Pandu represents the opposite tendencies and is described as the younger brother. Evil is always natural and appears first. Good has to come by some exertion and could not therefore precede evil. Pandu is said to have originated from Marut-gana or air, alluding thereby to some process of Prana-yama.

**मरुतान्तु गणाद्वीरःसर्वशस्त्रभृतां वरः।**  
**पाण्डुर्जज्ञे महाबाहुस्तव पूर्वपितामहः॥**

 b. The origin of the Pandavas, Kurus and Panchali has been generally noticed already in paras 8 and 9, and we have found that none of them could be explained as having been born like ordinary human beings. Dharma who begot Yudhishtira on Kunti is described in the text as the em-

bodiment of yoga. Yu thishtira meaning brave in battle naturally therefore refers to perfection in yoga itself.

**धर्मेण सह सङ्गम्य योगमूर्त्तिधरेण सा।**  
**लेभे पुत्रं महाबाहुं सर्वप्राणभृतां वरम्।**  
**युधिष्ठिर इति ख्यातः पाण्डोःप्रथमजस्सुतः॥**

 The five Pandavas are said to represent five Indras and Panchali is described as having been the wife of sage Moudgallya and known as Nalayıni. She is also stated to be an incarnation of Indrani or Indra's wife.

**द्रौपदी त्वथ संजज्ञे शचीभागादनिन्दिता।**  
**द्रुपदस्य कुले जाता वेदिमध्यादनिन्दिता।**  
**नातिह्रस्वा न महती नीलोत्पलसुगन्धिनी।**  
**पत्मायताक्षी सुश्रोणी स्वसिताञ्चितमूर्धजा।**  
**सर्वलक्षणसम्पन्ना वैडूर्यमणिसन्निभा।**  
**पञ्चानां पुरुषेन्द्राणां चित्तप्रमथिनी रहः।**  
**सैव नालायिनी भूत्वा रूपेणाप्रतिमा भुवि।**  
**मौद्रल्यं पतिमास्थाय शिवाद्वरमभीप्सती।**  
**स्वर्गश्रीः पाण्डवार्यन्तु समुत्पन्ना महामखे॥**

**एवमेते पाण्डवाः सम्बभूवुः।**  
**ये ते राजन् पूर्वमिन्द्रा बभूवुः।**  
**लक्ष्मीश्चैषां पूर्वमेवोपदिष्टा।**  
**भार्या यैषा द्रौपदी दिव्यरूपा।**  
**सैषा देवी रुचिरादेव जुष्टा।**  
**पञ्चानामेका स्वकृतेनेह कर्मणा।**  
**सृष्टा स्वयं देवपत्नी स्वयम्भुवा॥**

 Nala means a tabular vessel an Mudgala also applies to a hollow grass like reed. The story of Nalayini and Moudgalya naturally refers to the practice of yoga through Sushumna nadi. As regards the five Indras, the Niruktom has the following.

 **इन्धे दीपयति शररिमध्यवर्ती पञ्चवृत्तिः प्राणो वायुः। इदम्उत्पादीकरोति पश्यति वा इन्द्रः॥**

 The five vital airs, the five Elements and the fiive senses are all alluded to here. Drupada, the father of Panchali is said to have originated from the Marutgana like Pandu.

**पक्षात्सजज्ञे मरुतां देवानामरिमर्द्दनः।**  
**द्रुपदश्चैव राजर्षिःतत एवाभवत् गणात्॥**

 According to Niruktom, Drupada denotes a yogi or sanyasi wearing a pair of wooden shoes, Dru, wooden and pada shoes.

 Panchali's origin is explained thus in another Purana.

**कृते युगे वेदवती कुशध्वजसुता शुभा।**  
**त्रेतायां रामपत्नी च सीतेति जनकात्मजा।**  
**तच्छाया द्रौपदी देवी द्वापरे द्रुपदात्मजा।**  
**त्रिहायणीति सा प्रोक्ता विद्यमाना युगत्रये॥**

**ब्रह्मवैवर्तपुराणम्॥**

 "In the krita-yuga, she was Vedavathi daughter of Kusa-dwaja, in the Treta, she was Sita, daughter of Janaka and wife of Rama. In the Dwapara, the shadow of Sita became the daughter of Drupada known as Droupadi. Owing to her successive births in the three yugas she is known as Thrihayani." The description of Panchali as the shadow of Sita furnishes a definite clue for determining the greater importance of the Ramayana as compared with the Maha-bharata. It also suggests at the same time that the subjects treated in both the epics are of allied nature. The Ananda Ramayana clearly mentions that it was the shadow of Sita in the Tamasic from that was carried away by Ravana and retained in Lunka for some time.

**अथ तांजानकीं प्राह रामो रहसि सादरम्।**  
**सीते त्वं त्रिविधा भूत्वा रजोरूपा वसानले।**  
**वामाङ्गेमे सत्वरूपा वस छाया तमोमयी।**  
**पञ्चवट्यांदशास्थस्य मोहनार्थं वसात्र वै॥**

 Regarding the origin of the Pandavas and of Panchali the Markandeya Purana plainly states the whole fact.

**प्रजानामुपकारार्थे भूभारहरणाय च।**  
**यदिन्द्रदेहजं तेजस्तन्मुमोच स्वयं वृषः।**  
**कुन्त्यां जातो महातेजास्ततो राजा युधिष्ठिरः।**  
**बलं मुमोच पवनस्ततो भीमो व्यजायत।**  
**शक्रवीर्यार्द्धतश्चैव जज्ञे पार्थो धनञ्जयः।**  
**उत्पन्नौ यमजौ माद्यां शक्ररूपौ महाद्युती।**  
**पञ्चधा भगवानित्थम्अवतीर्णः शतक्रतुः।**  
**तस्योत्पन्ना महाभागा पत्नी कृष्णा हुताशनात्।**  
**शक्रस्यैकस्य सा पत्नी कृष्णा नान्यस्य कस्यचित्।**  
**योगीश्वराः शरीराणि कुर्वन्ति बहुलान्यपि।**  
**पञ्चानामेकपत्नीत्वं इत्येतत् कथितं तव॥**

 "The Pandavas are the incarnations of Indra in five or ms, for benefiting mankind by destroying the burden of the earth. Panchali born from the fire is the incarnation of the wife of Indra alone and of none else. This is the explanation for the five Pandavas keeping a single wife. You must know that the yogis can assume several bodies at one and the same time."

**योगीश्वराः शरीराणि कुर्वन्ति बहुलान्यपि॥**

 No further descriptions are necessary here to show that the venerable authors intended to convey some important religious instructions, rather than narrate without purpose, some historical incidents which would naturally encourage polyandry or other forms of immorality. In spite of the

prevailing archæological notions regarding the composition of the Puranas in pieces and in different periods, and especially as later productions, the discoverers of these facts could see, if they have eyes and if they would use them, that all the Puranas are unanimous in their descriptions of the facts in question. They do not differ according to the customs of the periods in which they are now declared to be written. All the current criticisms could have been avoided, if only the texts were correctly understood before the publication of irrelevant comments. In all civilised countries including ancient India, the ordinary practice of commentators and critics was to read and digest the texts before they set about their professional work. The total result of the labours of critics of the present type simply establishes the existence of a process of literary blunder which demands immediate rectification in the interest of general education. The story of the Padavas and Panchali is told in plainer philosophical language in several of the Upanishads and the following is illustrative of this fact.

**अनभ्यासवतश्चैव वृथा गोष्ठ्या न सिध्यति।**  
**तस्मात्सर्वप्रयत्नेन योगमेव सदाभ्यसेत्।**  
**ततः परिचयावस्था जायतेभ्यास योगतः।**  
**वायुः परिचितो यत्नादग्निना सह कुण्डलीं।**  
**भावयित्वा सुषुम्नायां प्रविशेदनिरोधतः।**  
**वायुना सह चित्तञ्च प्रविशेच्च महापथम्।**  
**यस्य चित्तं स्वपवनं सुषुम्नां प्रविशेदिह।**  
**भूमिरापोनलो वायुराकाशश्चेति पञ्जकः।**  
**येषु पञ्चसु देवानां धारणा पञ्चधोच्यते॥**

**योगतत्वोपनिषत्॥**

 'False pretences without continued practice of yoga are of no avail. By meditation of the kundalini as combined

with *Fire*, the Prana and mind should freely enter the Sushumna and the great path within, where the five subtle elements should be meditated upon in their divine forms. This constitutes the process of five Dharanas."

 In the rituals connected with the Karma-kanda, a concretised form of Karma-yoga, actual fire kept in a pot is used for oblatious and it is treated as an indispensable accessory, by a religious Hindu. In consideration of the religious necessity of a wife to partake of all such ceremonies, the term fire or Agui is commonly applied to denote a lawful wife married in front of the holy fire, Agui-sakshi. Pauchali is said to have been born from fire itself as described in the Maha-bharata.

**द्रुपदस्य कुले जाता वेदिमध्यादनिन्दिता॥**

 The Skanda Purana has the following on the subject.

**पञ्चभूतात्मके देहे स्थूले षाड्कौशिके सदा।**  
**पृथिव्यादिक्रमेणैव वर्तन्ते पञ्चदेवताः।**  
**कार्यं ब्रह्मा महीभागे कार्यं विष्णुर्जलांशके।**  
**कार्य रुद्रोग्निभागे च वाय्वंशेचेश्वरः परः।**  
**आकाशांशे शरीरस्य स्थितः साक्षात्सदाशिवः॥**

"The Devas of the five elements making up the physical body of man, remain in their respective elements in the body. Bramha is on the earthy constituent, Vishnu on water, Rudra on fire, Eswara on air and Sadasiva on Akasa".

 The Linga Purana explains the same idea more clearly and more completely.

**सर्वेषामेव लोकानां यदुपादानकारणम्।**  
**निमित्तकारणञ्चाहु स्सशिवः पञ्चधा स्मृतः।**  
**मूर्तयः पञ्च विख्याताः पञ्चब्रह्माह्वयाः पराः।**  
**सर्वलोकशरवयस्य शिवस्य परमात्मनः।**

**क्षेत्रदज्ञःप्रथमा मूर्तिः शिवस्य परमेष्ठिनः।**  
**भोक्ता प्रकृतिवर्गस्य भोग्यस्येशानसंज्ञितः।**  
**स्थाणोस्तत्पुरुषाख्या च द्वितीया मूर्तिरुच्यते।**  
**प्रकृतिःसा हि विज्ञेया परमात्मगुहात्मिका।**  
**अघोराख्या तृतीया च शम्भोर्मूर्तिगरीयसी।**  
**बुद्धेः सा मूर्त्तिरित्युक्ता धर्माद्यष्टाङ्गसंयुता।**  
**चतुर्थी वामदेवाख्या मूर्तिःशम्भोर्गरीयसी।**  
**अहंकारात्मकत्वेन व्याप्य सर्वे व्यवस्थिता।**  
**सद्योजाताह्वया शम्भोः पञ्चमी मूर्तिरुच्यते।**  
**मनस्तत्वात्मकत्वेन स्थिता सर्वशरीरिषु॥**

 "The efficient and material cause of all that is existing, is Siva, who is spoken of as consisting of five divine forms known as Pancha-bramha. The first is Kshetregna, the enjoyer of everything and styled Eswara. The second is Prakriti, known as Tat-purusha representing the cavity within which Paramatma is situated. The third is Budhi accompanied by or developed by Dharma and the eight angas of yoga, and known as Aghora. The fourth is the special Ahamkara representing the knowledge of everything as ' I am,' and known as Vamadeva. The fifth is the special knid of Manas which pervades every where and styled Sadyojata."

 These are reckoned as the five divine manifestations of Siva. Those who still retain any doubts as to the real significance of the five Pandavas and of Panchali, are earnestly requested to read carefully the whole of chapter 214, Adi- parva of the text itself narrating the story of the five Indras and of the boon granted to Nalayini. It will be clearly evident how all the Puranas are at one in this matter as in everything else now totally misunderstood. The names of the five Indras given in this chapter may be compared with the description in the above quotation.

**विश्वभुक् भूतधामा च शिबिरिन्द्रः प्रतापवान्।**  
**शान्तिश्चतुर्थस्तेषां वै तेजस्वी पञ्चमः स्मृतः॥**

 Any Sanskrit dictionary will suffice to explain the meanings of these names. One or two interesting facts may also be noticed here in connection with Panchali and her marriage. The mark required to be hit upon in the stipulation for her marriage, is stated to be some portion of the sky, and the implements to be used are five arrows all together on a bow given by Siva.

**न तु ज्यां प्रसहेदन्यस्तद्धनुप्रवरं महत्।**  
**शंकरेण वरं दत्तं प्रीतेन च महात्मना।**  
**मया कर्तव्यमधुना दुष्करं लक्ष्यवेधनम्।**  
**इति निश्चित्य मनसा कारितं लक्ष्यमुत्तमम्।**  
**यन्त्रं वैहायसञ्चापि कारयामास कृत्रिमम्।**  
**तेन यन्त्रेण सहितं राजन् लक्ष्यञ्च काश्चनम्।**  
**इदं सज्यं धनुः कृत्वा सज्जैरेभिश्चसायकैः।**  
**अतीत्य लक्ष्यं यो वेद्धा स लब्धा मत्सुतामिति॥**

**इदं धनुर्लक्ष्यमिमे च बाणाः**  
**शृण्वन्तु मे भूपतयः समेताः।**  
**छिद्रेण यन्त्रस्य समर्पयध्वम्**  
**शरैः शितै र्व्योमचरे ईशार्धैः॥**

 After the marriage, the Pandavas agreed that each one should live in turns with Panchali for a year during which the other four should not see the couple together. This is clearly suggestive of the specific processes of meditation in the yoga practice each stage being kept distinct from the others.

**समयं चक्रिरे राजन् तेन्योन्यवशमागताः।**  
**एकैकस्य गृहे कृष्णा वसेद्वर्षमकन्मषा।**

**द्रौपद्या नः सहासीनानन्योन्यं योभिदर्शयेत्।**  
**स नो द्वादशमासानि ब्रह्मचारी वने वसेत्॥**

 The dark colour of Panchali mentioned in the text as well as the name Krishna applied to her are suggestive of the destructive process required by Yoga. She is described as the source of destruction of all the Kshetrias in the world. This clearly means that all material notions and desires of the world obstructing the path of real knowledge should be annihilatedby the force of Yoga. It is hoped that the significance of Kshetrom as representing material form repeatedly noticed is not yet forgotten.

**तां चापि जातां सुश्रोणीं वागुवाचाशरीरिणी।**  
**सर्वयोषिद्वरा कृष्णा निनीषुः क्षत्रियान् क्षयम्।**  
**सुरकार्यमियं काले करिष्यति सुमध्यमा।**  
**अस्या हेतोः कौरवाणां महदुत्पत्स्यते भयम्।**  
**कृष्णेत्येवाब्रुवन् कृष्णां कृष्णाभूत्सा हि वर्णतः॥**

 If all the above enquiries male and the explanations obtained are still considered insufficient for the conviction as to the real significance of Panchali, it would be hopeless to attempt any further proofs to remove the current notion of her having been the common wife of five brothers among mankind, and the consequent inference as to the production of the Maha-bharata as an earlier one than the Ramayana. The logic of the inference as to the date of the text is however defective in every way. It assumes a proposition which is not proved in itself. That ancient Indian literature of every kind always treat of the customs prevailing at the time of their production is simply meaningless. To establish the view promulgated without external evidence and against internal evidence, the text should be pronounced a purely historical treatise, and particularly one of a worthless kind, devoid of facts, devoid of value and

devoid of morality. Would the critics kindly consider how the number of five husbands was fixed for the polyandry in question or the five arrows for the hitting of the mark? Would the historical effect be altered if the number is reduced or increased? These are perhaps only insignificant facts for the application of their eyes which would survey but broader and grander matters in the interest of civilization, as they understand it. But it is a pity that they often forget that the greater portion of mankind is poor and uncivilized and could not afford to soar so high as to lose the benefit of religion by ignoring it in this fashionable manner. It is therefore earnestly hoped that such grand theories would not be forced upon the poor innocent folk, yet unripe and unqualified for their voluntary reception.

 c. We may now enquire into the functions of Drona, Kripa, Dhowmya &c., who are mentioned as Bramhins, but also forming prominent characters in the general story. We have already noticed how Drona was born to Bharadwaja without a mother. Kripa is his brother-in-law, and Aswasthama his son. Drona is said to have quarrelled with Panchala-raja and obtained the northern portion of his kingdom.

**राजासि दक्षिणे कूले भागीरथ्याहमुत्तरे॥**

 Drona thus represents some specific portion of Gnana-kanda as opposed to the southern Panchala or Karma-kanda. The expression मूर्द्धाद्रोणकलशः ifound in Pranagnihotra. Upanishad, gives a clue as to Drona signifying some intellecual attainment.

 The preceptor or Acharya of the Pandavas is said to have been sage Dhoumya, younger brother of Devala.

**यवीयान् देवलस्यैष वने भ्राता तपस्यति।**  
**धौम्य उक्त्तोचके तीर्थे तं वृणुध्वं यदीछत॥**

 The name Dhoumya is clearly suggestive of the Dhuma-marga or Karma-yoga to which the whole story refers. The necessity of a Bramhin preceptor is mentioned for the attainment of a kingdom by a Kshetriya as well as for its preservation. The kingdom clearly refers here to a heavenly one and the Bramhin preceptor to the knowledge of Bramhan. None need therefore take the trouble to suspect at once the probalility of an interpolation by any interested section.

**क्षत्रियेणाभिजातेन पृथिवीं जेतुमिछता।**  
**पूर्वं पुरोहितः कार्यः पार्थ राज्याभिवृद्धये।**  
**महीं जिगीषता राज्ञा ब्रह्मकार्यं पुरस्कृतम्।**  
**तस्मात्पुरोहितः कश्चित् गुणवान् विजितेन्द्रियः।**  
**विद्वान् भवतु वो विप्रो धर्मकामार्थतत्ववित्॥**

 d. The incident narrated as preceding the marriage of Panchali is the destruction of Beka at Ekachakra village. We have already noticed that Beka signifies a mental defect known as Derpa or pride: दर्पो रक्षः खगो बकः॥ The word literally means a crane and hence a cheat. He is described, as residing in a cave adjoining the Jumna river in the village. Ekachakra or single wheel refers to the heart or mind situated on the side of the Ida nadi. The Rakshasa is said to have been domineering over all without distinctions of caste or creed, age or sex.

**समीपे नगरस्यास्य बको वसति राक्षसः।**  
**इतो गव्यूतिमात्रेस्ति यमुनागह्वरे गुहा।**  
**तस्यां घोरः स वसति जिघांसुः पुरुषादकः।**  
**गुहायां च वसंस्तत्र बाधते सततं जनम्।**  
**स्त्रियो बालांश्च वृद्धांश्च यूनश्चापि दुरात्मवान्।**

 The destruction of the Rakshasa by Bhima, son of Vayu thus clearly denotes the annihilation of this evil nature by processes of Pranayama as a preparation for future connection with Panchali.

 e. The Pandavas obtained half the kingdom from Dhrita-rashtra and settled themselves at Khandava-prasta, which was afterwards named Indra-prasta, having been rebuilt for the use of the Pandavas by Viswakarma, at the instance of Indra. The place is said to have been originally the capital of Ayu, Pururavas, Nahusha and Yayati, but was destroyed by the curse of Rishis who were annoyed at the misconduct of Pururays.

**मम पुत्रा दुरात्मानः सर्वेहङ्कारसंयुताः।**  
**शासनं न करिष्यन्ति ममनित्यं युधिष्ठिर।**  
**स्वकार्यनिरतै र्न्नित्यमवलिप्तै र्दुरात्मभिः।**  
**पुनर्वैविग्रहो माभूत् खाण्डवप्रस्थमाविश।**  
**न हि यो वसतस्तत्र कश्चित् शक्तः प्रबाधितुम्।**  
**संरक्षमाणान् पार्थेन त्रिदशानिव वज्रिणा।**  
**अर्धराज्यं तु सम्प्राप्य खाण्डवप्रस्थमाविश॥**

**कुरुष्व कुरुराजस्य महेन्द्रपुरसन्निभम्॥**  
**इन्द्रेण कृतनामानं इन्द्रप्रस्थं महापुरम्॥**

**आयुःपुरूरवा राजन् नहुषेण यायातिना।**  
**तत्रैव निवसन्ति स्म खाण्डवे तु नृपोत्तम।**  
**राजधानी तु सर्वेषां पौरवाणां महाभुज।**  
**विनाशितं मुनिगणैर्लोभात् बुधसुतस्य वै।**  
**तस्मात्वं खाण्डवप्रस्थं पुरं राष्ट्रं च वर्द्धय।**

 The geography of Indra-prasta as could be gathered from other Puranas is very interesting and would be extremely confounding to the modern Pandit and critic.

**प्रयागादेकगव्यूतिःसप्तर्षीणां महात्मनाम्।**  
**पूर्वस्यां दिशि तीर्थानि सप्त तत्तीर्थसप्तकम्।**  
**प्रयागादेकगव्यूतिमात्रे पश्चिमभूतले।**  
**निगमोद्बोधकं नाम तीर्थे गुरुकृतं मया।**  
**तीर्थसप्तक निगमोदबोधयो रन्तरे महत्।**

**इन्द्रप्रस्थमिदं क्षेत्र स्थापितं देवतैः पुरा।**  
**पूर्वपश्चिमयोस्तात एकयोजनविस्तृतम्।**  
**कालिन्द्यादक्षिणे यावद्योजनानां चतुष्टयम्।**  
**इन्द्रप्रस्थस्य मर्यादा कथितैषा महर्षिभिः।**  
**इन्द्रस्य खाण्डवारण्यं इन्द्रप्रस्थाभितं शुभम्।**  
**क्षेत्रं कलिन्दजातीरे मत्तुल्यास्तत्र ये मृताः।**  
**विरिञ्चे रचिता तत्र स्वकीया द्वारका पुरी।**  
**इन्द्रप्रस्थान्तरावर्त्तिन्येषा या द्वारका द्विज।**  
**नातःपरतरं मर्त्येतीर्थमस्त्यखिलार्थदम्॥**

**                 पद्मपुराणम्॥**

 "To the cast of Prayag are the seven Thirthas of the seven Rishis. To the wost is Nigamodbothakom. In the middle of these, lies Indra-prasta, on the southern bank of the Jumna, which is also Indra's, Khandava forest. In the middle of this Indra-prasta is the holy Dwaraka "

 From this quotation we obtain the names of nine places. known as Chakras by the yogis.

**नवचक्रं षडाधारं त्रिलक्ष्यं व्योमपञ्चकम्।**  
**सम्यगेतन्नजानाति स योगी नामतो भवेत्॥**

**मण्डलब्राह्मणोपनिषत्॥**

 “Without aknowledge of the nine Chakras, six Adharas, three Lakshyas and five Akasas, a yogi is but a Yogi in name."

**अपश्यन्मथुरामेषां हृदयाम्भोजकल्पिताम्।**  
**हरेर्भगवतस्साक्षादाविर्भाव स्थली हि सा।**  
**काशीमपश्यत्भ्रूमध्ये मायाम्आधारसंस्थिताम्।**  
**लिङ्गदेश ततः काञ्चीमवन्तीं नाभिमण्डले।**

**सव्यापसव्ययोस्तेषां गंगापि यमुना नदी।**

**बदर्याश्रममेतेषां ब्रह्मरन्ध्रे ददर्शह।**  
**पौण्ड्रवर्द्धन नेप्पालीपीठं नवनवोर्युगे।**  
**पीठं पूर्णगिरिर्न्नाग ललाटे समदृश्यत।**

**सौरं चक्षुः प्रदेशस्थं बोद्धं छायासु सङ्गतम्॥**

**वायुपुराणम्॥**

 "The localities in the body represented by the names of holy places are detailed. Mathura in the heart. Kasi between the brows. Maya in Adhara. Kanchi, near the sexual organ. Avanti at the navel, Dwaraka in the throat.Prayag in Prana. On either side of it is Ganga and Yemuna and Saraswati in the middle. Prabhasom between the chin and throat. Badri in the brain. The following are Peetahs, Poundravarthan and Nepal in the eyes, Poornagiri at the forehead. Kanchi at the waist. Jalandhars in the breast. Bhrigu in the ear. Ayodhya at the nostrils. Brambya in the brain, Saiva above the forehead. Sakta at the tip of the tongue Vyshnava at the heart. Surya inthe eye. Budha in the shadow."

 In spite of the inconsistencies in the modern geography as compared with the given descriptions, the texts are not to be condemned on that account, nor the molern geography. As the mistake lies in the absurd identification of the former with the latter, the interpreters alone who cause this unnecessary confusion deserve to be warned.

 f. The last item in the Adi-parva is the burning of the Khandava forest. It is described as the abode of Thakshaka a friend of Indra, other Pannagas, Rakshasas and wild animals. But no human beings are found in the forest. It was once occupied by the Asuras and was destroyed by Agni or fire at the request of the Devas. With the help of Krishna and Arjuna it is again burnt down, thus rendering a great boon to the world. Thakshaka had left this and gone to Hastinapurom before the fire took place. Maya, the Asuras' Architect escaped death from the fire through the mercy of Arjuna. Thus far the story is narrated in the Adi-parva.

**आलयं पन्नगेन्द्रस्य तक्षकस्य महात्मनः।**  
**व्यालदंष्ट्रिगणाकीर्णे वर्जितं सर्वमानुषैः।**  
**रक्षसां भुजगेन्द्राणां पक्षिणाञ्च महालयम्।**  
**पुरा देवनियोगेन यत्वया भस्मसात् कृतम्।**  
**आलयं देवशत्रूणां सुधीरं खाण्डवं वनम्।**  
**तत्र सर्वाणि सत्वानि निवसन्ति विभावसो।**  
**तेषां त्वं मेदसा तृप्तः प्रकृतिस्थो भविष्यसि।**  
**भगवानपि तिग्मांशुः समिद्धः खाण्डवं ततः।**  
**ददाहसह कृष्णाभ्यां जनयन् जगतोहितम्॥**

 It is clear from this description that the forest indicates some obstructive item demanding destruction by fire. It was once destroyed for the protection of the Devas. Now again it is destroyed by the help of Krishna and Arjuna for the benefit of mankind. As the abode of Thakshaka, it refers to duality or differentiation. Khandava or in pieces, denotes the idea of finite individual distinctions as opposed to generalities and unifications. The escape of Thakshaka and Maya from this fire is significant and may be understood as we proceed with the story. We may however end this Adi-parva here. The modern state of affairs, no

doubt makes one fear, whether explanations of the above kind should be continued, in consideration of the prospect of a disappointment which naturally awaits such attempts, especially at a time when the public in general are in the least prepared for them, and the dangers to be guarded against are unfortunately too many.

**इदमपटुकपाटं जर्जरः पञ्जरीयम्**  
**विरमति न गृहेस्मिन् क्रूरमार्जारयात्रा।**  
**शुक मुकुलितजिह्वः स्थीयतां किं वचोभि**  
**स्तव वचनविनोदे नादरःपामराणाम्॥**

**SABHA-PARVA**

** 9**. *The construction of the Sabha, the Rajasuya sacrifice and the destruction of Jara-sandha, the gambling and the Pandavas' exile to the Forest.* As already proposed, we may now commence with our enquiry into the significance of the important incidents, mentioned in the second Parva called Sabha. In conformity with this title, the story starts with the construction of the Sabha at Khandava-prasta, by Maya the Asura architect for the use of the Pandavas. The details of its description may be seen from the text by those who are inclined to read the same. It would be enough to note here that many of the items which might at first sight appear as exaggerations or meaningless incongruities in the description are full of useful and practical technicalities, to deal with which here, would not only be out of the scope of this book, but would also be a profitless work. The main object at present is to create a conviction as to the existence of such valuable informations in the literature, which in itself has become a sufficiently difficult task under the existing circumstances.

**मदोपशमनं शास्त्रं खलानां कुरुते मदम्।**  
**चक्षुःप्रकाशकं तेज उलूकानामिवान्धताम्॥**

 Besides, it is confidently hoped that when this main object is accomplished, better, and more valuable explanations and commentaries are likely to be forthcoming in abundance from more competent and erudite scholars. Sage Narada is said to have appeared before the Pandavas after the construction of this Sabha and in the course of conversation, he expresses his opinion about the Sabha as the best in the Bhumi or earth, and enumerates and describes in detail five others seen by him as far superior to itself. The descriptious of five divine Sabhas, belonging to Yama, Varuna, Kubera, Indra and Bramha are given in detail by sage Narada. A perusal of the original text on the subject will not be uninteresting or unprofitable if undertaken with some sympathy or at least without a bias.

**यच्च किञ्चित्र्त्रिलोकेस्मिन् दृश्यते स्थाणु जङ्गमम्।**  
**सर्वं तस्यां मया दृष्टमिति विद्धि नराधिप॥**

 "Narada said. I have not seena Sabha so grand on the earth like yours. But I shall describe to you five other divine Sabhas belonging to Yema, Varuna, Indra, Kubera and Bramha respectively. The bright Sabha of Indra is constructed by himself of one hundred yojanas in extent by one hundred and fifty in length. It is five yoganas in height. Yama's Sabha constructed by Viswakarma is 100 yojanas by 100 yojanas. Similarly, Varuna's is constructed by Viswakarma with water in the middle. The white Sabha of Kubera is 100 yojanas by 70 and it is constructed by the strength of his own tapas. Kubera resides in it with his wife named Ridhi. The Subha belonging to Bramha is incouccivable. It is eternal and divinely bright, but not supported by any pillars. It is brighter than thesun, moon and fire. Vidya, Mind, the five subtle elements, Prakriti

and Vikara which constitute the original causes of everything in the Universe, were seen by me there."

 The five divine Sabhas above described combined with the one under reference clearly point to the five subtle elements and something above them all. The six Adharas often referred to in the explanations in connection with the Dhyana-yoga are distinctly the matters represented here. It is preposterous to call them exaggerations or anything else, without knowing the head or tail of the subject. It would be more honorable to be buried in oblivion rather than shine in such quixotic splendour. It is neither safe nor politic, always to expect non-detection and non-exposure.

**स्वायत्तमेकान्तगुणं विधात्रा विनिर्मितं छादनमज्ञतायाः।**  
**विशेषतः सर्वविदां समाजे विभूषणं मौनमपण्डितानाम्॥**

 The next important incident narrated is the performance of the great Raja-suya sacrifice by Yudhishtira at Indra-prasta. In connection with this, the destruction of Jarasandha and Sisupala is described. The death of the former was considered a conditon precedent even for the preparation for the sacrifice. The latter is said to have been killed by Sri-Krishna during the ceremony at the spot.

 Rajasuya literally means the attainment of undisputed sway over all the kings on the surface of the earth. Yudishtira after obtaining half the kingdom is said to have resolved to perform this sacrifice for which he naturally had to fight against several unyielding opponents. But Jarasandha, king of the Magadhas was the strongest of the foes, he having captured a hundred ruling princes and secured them for the purpose of killing all of them in a sacrifice to be propitiated

to Rudra. Unless these princes are released and Jarasandha killed, Yudhishtira had no hopes of accomplishing the Rajasuya.

**अवाप्य राजा राज्यार्धं कुन्तीपुत्रो युधिष्ठिरः।**  
**महत्वे राजशब्दस्य मनश्चके महामनाः॥**

**निहतश्च जरासन्धो मोक्षिताश्चमहीक्षितः।**  
**राजसूयश्च मे लब्धो निदेशे तव तिष्ठतः॥**

 The significance of this Rajasuya sacrifice refers clearly to a complete control over all the desires for material prosperity and their evil consequences. The process inculcated is described as attacks encountered from various quarters to win over the enemies, and treated in a charming Puranic style which invariably carries the reader in his enjoyment of literary beauties, far away from the real topic dealt with. But if the gist of the dramatic setting is understood, the narrative would surely be more interesting and could be better appreciated. The very idea of treating subjects of this kind in an apparently historical form with a view to appeal easily to the minds of the common people is indeed an ingenious one and the method is exceptionally peculiar to the Indian literature. It clearly shows to what extent our ancient Rishis were conversant with human character and how effectively they have succeeded in creating a dramatic interest in the treatment of subjects entirely different from human history and particularly devcid of worldly interest. It is only a pity that they thought fit to condemn the work of perpetuating human history in the sanskrit literature as an offence against Saraswati, Goddess of learning. Otherwise, the modern historians who make so much of themselves could have seen their own insignificance before them. The first and foremost of the enemies to be destroyed was found to be Jara-sandha for

the purpose of accomplishing the Rajasuya sacrifice. The import of this story could be easily understood from the description of his birth and origin. He is said to have been born in two pieces by two mothers and afterwards joined together by Jara, or decrepitule and hence named Jara-Sandha. He grew very powerful and became invulnerable by ordinary processes of fighting, Sri-krishna had to devise a special plan for his destruction by Prana-yudha. As advised by Sri Krishna, Bhima tore him in two pieces and as the pieces joined together again, Sri-Krishna showed apiece of grass torn into two and placed in an inverted position. Bhima son of Vayu caught the sign, tore Jarasandha and placed the torn pieces of the body inverted. Thus was Jarasandha killed and the one hundred ruling princes imprisoned in Magada were released. The description of the country of Magada itself is noteworthy. It is said to be situated in the midst of five great mountains. The following couplets from the text on the points here noticed will not only furnish the necessary clues but will also afford great literary interest to the reader. The peculiar pliability of the Sanskrit language and the command the ancient authors possessed over it will become strikingly evident.

**एवं प्राप्य पुरं रम्यं दुराधर्ष समन्ततः।**  
**अर्थसिद्धिं त्वनुपमां जरासन्धोभिमन्यते॥**

 Magada denotes a mixed tribe, the product of a Kshetriya mother and a Vysya father, known as a Pratiloma caste as opposed to an Anu-loma. The term commonly applies to a bard, a minstrel or more clearly to a slave. A slave to the human passions and desires is what is alluded to here. The Vysya father refers to the rearing of cattle or beastly tendencies, and the Kshetriya mother to the addiction to all the materialities in the world. The five mountains forming the boundaries of the Magada country represent the five gross Elements composing the human body. Jarasandha, the monarch of this country is Prana or life breath consisting of expiration and inspiration. These two breaths are joined together by Jara or mortality and Jara-

sandha rules supreme and keeps all other powers under his sway to be sacrificed to Rulra or death. This great monarch is said to have been killed by Bhima, son of Vayu by Prana-yudha and all the minor chiefs kept under his clutches released. The whole description refers to the practice of Prana-yamaprescribed in the yoga-sastras. The Rajasuya as explained above could be started only after the destruction of this Jarasandha. There is yet another foe who has to be killed during the performance of the sacrifice. He is Sisupala. His origin too narrated in the text is worthy of attention. He is said to have been born with three eyes and four hands. At his birth a heavenly voice said that if the child is embraced by one destined to kill it, the additional eye and hands will disappear. Sisupala was the son of Sri-Krishna's aunt and when Krishna went to see the child, at his embrace the third eye and the extra hands vanished. Thus runs the story of Sisupala.

**चेदिराजकुलेजातस्त्रक्ष एष चतुर्भुजः।**  
**रासभारावसदृशं ररास च ननाद च।**  
**अन्तर्भूतं ततोभूतमुवाचेदं पुनर्वचः।**  
**यस्योत्सङ्गे गृहीतस्य भुजावप्यधिकावुभौ।**  
**पतिष्यतः क्षितितले पञ्चशीर्षाविवोरगौ।**  
**तृतीयमेतत् कालस्य ललाटस्थन्तु लोचनम्।**  
**निमज्जिष्यति तं दृष्ट्वा सोस्यु मृत्युर्भविष्यति॥**

**पुत्रं दामोदरो सङ्गं देवीसन्यदधात्स्वयम्।**  
**न्यस्तमात्रस्य स्वाङ्के भुजावभ्यधिकावुभौ।**  
**पेततुस्तच्च नयन नामज्जत ललाटजम्॥**

 The preparations for the Rajasuya commences with the victories to be gained over all the rulers on the earth, the Parthivom-kshetrom. Yudhishtira remained at Khandava Prasta, and the four brothers proceeded in the four directions, subdued all the ruling princes and brought with them valuable treasures and rarest stuffs. There are ten full

chapters from 26 to 35 giving detailed descriptions of places visited and the kings subdued, affording ample scope for historical and geographical critics to waste their time and skill and to display their complete ingorance of the subject. All possible varieties of theories could be easily applied with impunity to condemn this portion of the text as interpolations or exaggerations, as long as the real import of the narration is not cared to be understood by any body. The Pandit could also, with his present attainments limited to the study of grammar and dictionary conveniently get over the difficulty by proclaiming that these countries and rulers existed in days of yore as exactly as described. He is quite safe and secure in his positionwithout the least fear of disturbance to his brain. He has taken the monopoly for this unknown subject and has taken proper care that no ideas which would tend to worry his intellect are permitted to approach him.

 The Rajasuya ceremony is described as having been celebrated with the usual splendours of a Hindu Festival, the decorations, feastings, charities and amusements always accompanying. It is particularly noteworthy that among the sacrifices, the Rajasuya in question does not mention the killing of any animal or other living creature, during the ceremony, except the destruction of king Sisupala. The practice of killing animals for religious sacrifices is a disputed and over misunderstood subject, the treatment of which however would be an inconvenient digression at this stage of our essay. We could easily see that in the term Raja-suya, Sooto create is the prominent idea and not destruction.

**महत्वे राजशब्दस्य मनश्चक्रेमहामनाः॥**

 A close reading of the text describing the death of Sisupala will furnish some useful clues to the meaning of

the Rajasuya ceremony. Sri-Krishna at his arrival having been honored as the chief among the guests, Sisupala became enraged and condemned the act in the presence of all assembled.

**तस्मै भीष्माभ्यनुज्ञातःसहदेवःप्रतापवान्।  
उपजह्रेथ विधिवद्वार्ष्णेयायार्थ्यमुत्तमम्।  
शिशुपालस्तु तां पूजां वासुदेवे न च क्षमे॥**

 After some time Sisupala prepared for a fight and Sri-Krishna killed him with his disc. A bright light emanated from the body, bowed to Sri-Krishna and merged in the body of Sri-Krishna in the sight of all present.

**पाञ्चजन्यं महाशङ्खं पूरयामास केशवः।  
संमोहयित्वा भगवांश्चक्रं दिव्यं समाददे।  
चिछेद चं सुनीथस्य शिरक्षक्रेण संयुगे।  
स पपात महाबाहुर्वज्राहत इवाचलः।  
ततश्चेदिपतेर्देहा त्तेजोम्यं ददृशुर्नृपाः।  
उत्पतन्तं महाराज गगनादिव भास्करम्।  
ततः कमलपत्राक्षं कृष्णं लोकनमस्कृतम्।  
ववन्दे तत्तदा तेजो विवेश च नराधिप।  
तदत्भुतममन्यन्त दृष्टा सर्वे महीक्षितः।  
यद्विवेश महाबाहुं तत्तेजः पुरुषोत्तमम्॥**

 What took place at the end of all this is curiously described in the following couplet. A heavy shower from a cloudless sky accompanied by lightning and thunder as well as by a terrible quacking of the earth is said to have occurred.

**अनभ्रे प्रववर्षद्यौः पपात ज्वलिताशनिः।  
कृष्णेन निहते चैद्ये चचाल च वसुन्धरा॥**

 The poetical beauty and the physical importance of this description on the occasion cannot be easily conceived or appreciate. It is likely to be denounced as one of the

vagaries of the ancient authors who have not attained to the high standard of modern civilization. The criterion for such criticisms offered is an unknown factor at present and it is therefore unnecessary to attempt criticisms on them. With the meaning of Rajasuya as explained above, it demands no special proofs to understand that the showers without clouds and the earthquake herein mentioned refer to some appropriate facts equally misunderstood. We have already noticed in the previous pages that the incarnations of Jaya and Vijaya represent Ahomkaras of a high order and Sisupala clearly denotes one of its varieties. The destruction of this Ahamkara by Sri-Krishna during the Rajasuya ceremony furnishes its plain philosophical significance which can be easily grasped with the clues already before us.

 The dyutaor gambling mentioned as the incident subsequent to the Rajasuya, is, as already explained, the trial before the ordeal of sensations influenced by the previous effects of karmas called vasanas. Even after the great Rajasuya, the trial has proved a complete failure for the Pandavas. Panchali was dragged before the gambling assembly and she had to implore the help of Sri-Krishna, the Lord of yoga, for rescue from the clutches of the cruel Kurus. The description as to her having been in her Rajas at the time points to the loss of Satwa character.

**एकवस्त्रा त्वधोनीवी रोधमाना रजस्वला॥**

 The sensations as such are so deceptive and obstructive to the progress of yoga that even after long devotiona practice, they could not be trusted. Their natural tendency is to ruin the man and Dyuta or Aksha should always be avoided by the wise and religious. But when one finds himself somehow entangled in the meeshes of the sensations, there is none capable of helping him out of the danger,

except Sri-Krishna the Lord of yoga. Panchali's appeal to the Lord on the occasion and the immediate and effective help obtained are stories familiar to every Hindu in the land.

**महत्यापदि सम्प्राप्ते स्मर्तव्यो भगवान् हरिः।**  
**इति निश्चित्य मनसा शरणागतवत्सलम्।**  
**आकृष्यमाणे वसने द्रौपदी कृष्णमस्मरत्।**  
**हा कृष्ण द्वारकावासिन् क्वासि यादवनन्दन।**  
**इमामवस्थां सम्प्राप्तामनाथां किमुपेक्षसे।**  
**कृष्ण कृष्ण महायोगिन्विश्वात्मन्विश्वभावन।**  
**प्रपन्नां पाहि गोविन्द कुरुमध्येऽवसीदतीम्॥**

 The Pandavas were at last compelled to carry out the agreement to take to the forest in case of failure in the game. They had to live in the Forest for twelve years dressed like ascetics, and an additional year, in-cognito, during which if detected, the forest life for another period of twelve years' duration should be rosumed.

**अस्माभिर्निर्जिता यूयं वने द्वादशवत्सरान्।  
वसध्वं कृष्णया सार्धमजिनैः प्रतिवासिताः।  
त्रयोदशश्च स्वजनैरज्ञाताःपरिवत्सरम्।  
ज्ञातांश्च पुनरन्यानि वने वर्षाणि द्वादश।  
त्रयोदशे च निर्वृत्ते पुनरेव यथोचितम्।  
स्वराज्यं प्रतिपत्तव्यमितरैरथवेतरैः॥**

 The Pandavas then left for the forest greatly enraged, led by Dhowmya their preceptor who walked in front with Kusa grass in hand and chanting some terrible portions of the Sama Veda.

**वस्त्रेण संवृत्य मुखं कुन्तीपुत्रो युधिष्ठिरः।  
बाहू विशालौ सम्पश्यन् भीमो गछति पाण्डवः।  
सिकता वपन् सव्यसाची राजानमनुगछति।**

**माद्रीपुत्रः सहदेवो मुखमालिप्य गछति।  
पांसूपलिप्तसर्वाङ्गो नकुलश्चित्तविहलः।  
दर्शनीयतमो लोके राजानमनुगछति।  
कृष्णा तु केशैःप्रछाद्य मुखमायतलोचना।  
दर्शनीया प्ररुदती राजानमनुगछति।  
कृत्वा तु नैरृतान् दर्भान् धीरो धौम्यः पुरोहितः।  
सामानि गायन् याम्यानि पुरतो याति भारत।  
हतेषु भरतेष्वाजौ कुरूणां गुरुवस्तदा।  
एवं सामानि गायन्तीत्युक्त्वा धौम्योगि गछति।  
प्रस्थाप्य पाण्डवान् शेषान्निश्शेषस्ते भविष्यति।  
इति धौम्यो व्यवसितो रौद्रसामानि गायति॥**

 This is indeed a critical stage in the Maha-bharata demanding some carnest enquiry, for the purpose of understanding the real import of this banishment of the Pandavas for a fixed period. Twelve years of forest life combined with one year of undetected living, have to be compared with full fourteen years' banishment in the Ramayna. The difference in the number of years must furnish some definite clue to the difference between the two Epics themselves. The following passages explain the significance of samvatsara or year as used in the religious texts. We have  
noticed in the preceding chapters that the names given to the seasons, months &c. refer not to the actual duration of time, but to the power or authority that enforces the same called kalabhi-manins.

 **संवत्सरः। नादित्यप्रधानः।संवसन्त्यस्मिन्इतिप्रसक्तानुप्रसकं।समस्तानिहिभूतानिएतस्मिन् संवसन्ति॥**

**निरुक्तम् ॥**

 "The term samvatsara does not directly refer to the Sun. That in which everything exists or lives, bas been all, along technically called a samvatsara.

 एकोहवै नारायण आसीन्नब्रह्मा नेशानो नापो नाग्नीषोमौ नेमे द्यावापृथिवी न नक्षत्राणि न सूर्यो न चन्द्रमाः। स एकाकी न रमेत तस्य ध्यानान्तस्थस्य यज्ञस्तोममुच्यते। तस्मिन् पुरुषाश्चतुर्द्दशा जायन्ते। एका कन्या। दशोन्द्रियाणि। मन एकादशं तेजः। द्वादशोहङ्कारः। त्रयोदशकः प्राणः। चतुदेश आत्मा। पञ्चदशी वुद्धिः। भूतानि पञ्चतन्मात्राणि। पञ्चमहाभूतानि। स एकः पञ्चविंशतिः पुरुषः। तत्पुरुषं पुरुषो निवेश्य नास्य प्रधानसंवत्सरा जायन्ते। संवत्सरादधिजायन्ते॥

**महोपनिषत्॥**

 "Narayana was the only original One when all else was naught. From his meditation fourteen males and one female were born, consisting of the ten Indrias, the eleventh mind, the twelth Ahamkara, the thirteenth Prana, the fourteenth Atma and the fifteenth Budhi. Adding the ten elements, the twenty-fifth is Purusha who merges himself into the original Purusha. This Purusha is above the samvatsaras which are only subservient to him."

 Thus we see that the fourteen samvatsaras refer to the ten Indrias, mind, Ahamkara Prana and Atma, and the smaller number mentioned in the Maha-bharata alludes to a lower stage of Yogic attainment aimed at. The Budhi mentioned last refers to Mahat-Tatwa.

 We may conveniently stop whith the Sabha parva here leaving the readers to the text itself for fuller informations, in case they care to have them. We may however note here without much fear that we can already begin to feel that the Parvas as they gradually progress, deal with some progressive stages of a definite scientific subject and not the accidental occurrences of worldy facts whose uncertainty is inevitable in human history.

**THE VANA-PARVA.**

** 10.** The travels through the Kamyaka and Dwyta vanams. We may now commence with the Vana-.parva. The Pandavas started to the forest and on their way, first visited the great banyan tree called Pramana.

**ततस्ते पुरुषव्याघ्रा स्थानास्थाय भारत।  
ददृशुर्जाह्ववीतीरे प्रमाणाख्यं महावटम्॥**

 Pramana clearly means religious authority or the Sastras. The necessary keynote is given at the very commencement which the Pandit and the critic are at full liberty to miss or abuse. A large number of Bramhins and the people in general having followed the Pandavas to the forest determined to stay with them, Yudhishtira was put to the necessity of providing food for them. Advised and instructed by Dhowmya, Yudhishtira prayed to the Sun and obtained a copper vessel capable of producing necessary food for all for a period of twelve years.

**अहमन्नं प्रदास्यामि सप्तपञ्च च ते समाः।**  
**गृहीष्ट्व पिठरं ताम्रं मया दत्तं नराधिप॥**

 The boon obtained here alludes to the food for religious meditation and the Sun represents Atma, supplying light to the ten Indrias, mind and Budhi which constitute the twelve Samvatsaras or years.

**सूर्य आत्माजगतस्तस्थुषश्च॥**

**ज्योतिर्लिङ्गं द्विषट्कन्तु द्वादशादित्यनामकम्।**  
**दशेन्द्रियमनोबुद्धि॥**

 The Pandavas then proceeded to the Kamyaka forest on the banks of the Saraswati in the western regions.

**यथुर्वनेनैव वनं सततं पश्चिमां दिशम्।  
ततः सरस्वतीकूले समेषु मरुधन्वसु।  
काम्यकं नाम ददृशुर्वनं मुनिजनप्रियम्॥**

 On entering this forest, a Rakshasa named Kirmira, brother of the late Baka appeared before them.

**अहं बकस्य वै भ्राता किर्मीर इति विश्रुतः।**  
**वनेस्मीन् काम्यके शून्ये निवसामि गतज्वरः।**  
**युधि निर्जित्य पुरुषानाहारं नित्यमाचरन्॥**

 Bhima killed this Rakshasa as he previously destroyed his brother and the Pandavas lived in this forest peacefully for some time.

**एवं विनिहतस्संख्ये किर्मीरो मनुजाधिप।**  
**भीमेन वचनात्तस्य धर्मराजस्य कौरव।**  
**ततो निष्कण्टकं कृत्वा वनं तदपराजितः।**  
**द्रौपद्या सह धर्मज्ञो वसतिं तामुवासह॥**

 From Kamyaka, the Pandavas proceeded to Dwyta-forest with a view to spend the twelve prescribed years there. In that forest they witnessed several Sidha-Rishis and the Bramha and Kshetrom were well united together.

**इदं द्वैतवनं नाम सरःपुण्यजनोषितम्।**  
**बहुपुष्पफलं रम्यं नानाद्विजनिषेवितम्।**  
**अत्रेमा द्वादशसमा विहरेमेति रोचये।**  
**तस्मिन्वने धर्मभृतां निवासे।**  
**ददर्श सिद्धर्षिगणाननेकान्॥**

**ब्रह्मलोकसमं पुण्यमासीद्वैतवनं सरः।**  
**संसृष्टं ब्रह्मणा क्षत्रं भूय एव व्यरोचत॥**

 Let us pauce here for a while. The word Kirmira means varigated, pointing to variations of thought or want

of concentration. The two forests curiously named Kamyaka and Dwita being described as situated in the western regions clearly refer to the lower Adharas or chakras, such as Muladhar, Swadhishtana &c. The whole of this Vana-parva and the next one Virata, verily deal with the preparation in the lower chakras for the would-be battle to be fought at Kuru-kshetra, the sixth adhara. The naine Dwyta-vans is always accompanied by the word Sara in the text showing that it refers to the subtle water and Kamyaka representing the subtle earth.

**गुदमेढ्रान्तरालस्थं मूलाधारं त्रिकोणकम्।**  
**शिवस्य जीवरूपस्य स्थानं तद्धि प्रचक्षते।**  
**तदेतत् कामरूपाख्यं पीठं कामफलप्रदम्।**  
**स्वाधिष्ठानाह्वयं चक्रंलिङ्गमूले षडश्चक्रे।**  
**चतुरश्रं धरण्यादौ ब्रह्मा तत्राधिदेवता।**  
**अर्धचन्द्राकृति जलं विष्णुस्तस्याधिदेवता॥**

 The Pandavas then left Dwyta for Kamyaka forest as advised by Vyasa.

**स व्यासवाक्यमुदितो वनाद्वैतवनात्ततः।  
ययौ सरस्वतीकूले काम्यकं नाम काननम्॥**

 Arjuna was asked by Yudhishtira to qualify himself by Tapas for obtaining from Indra the necessary astras and weapons for the destruction of the Kurus. He was advised to go to the north for this purpose.

**कृष्णद्वैपायनात्तात गृहीतोपनिषन्मया।  
गृहीतया तया सम्यक् जगत्सर्वं प्रकाशते।  
धनुष्मान् कवची खठ्गी मुनिः साधुव्रते स्थितः।  
न कस्यचिद्ददन्मार्गे गछ तातोत्तरां दिशम्।  
इन्द्रे ह्यस्त्राणि दिव्यानि समस्तानि धनञ्जय।  
वृत्रात्भीतैः बलं देवैस्त दाशके समर्पितम्।**

**तान्येकस्थानि सर्वाणि ततस्त्वं प्रतिपत्स्यसे।  
अनेन ब्रह्मणा तात सर्वे सम्प्रतिपद्यते॥**

 "The Devas have left all their energy in Iudra through fear of Vritra. All the divine weapons are therefore available from Indra. Go prepared to the northern regions, yielding to none. Everything desirable shall then be obtained working through this Bramhan " The whole description and the last line particularly denote clearly something more than historical narrations.

 Arjuna accordingly started for the work assigned to him. He passed through Himavat to Ganthamadana and thence to Indra-kila where he performed his Tapas.

**दिव्यं हैमवतं पुण्यं देवजुष्टं परन्तपः।  
अगछत्पर्वतं पुण्यमेकाह्ववै महामनाः।  
हिमवन्तमतिक्रम्य गन्धमादनमेव च।  
इन्द्रकीलं समासाद्य ततोतिष्ठद्धनञ्जयः।  
प्रस्थेन्द्रकीलस्य शुभे तपोयोगपरो भवत्॥**

 Indra then appeared before Arjuna and told him that he should first see the three-eyed Siva to be qualified for entering the heaven. The divine weapons longed for, shall then be presented from there.

**एवमुक्तः प्रत्युवाचवृत्रहा पाण्डुनन्दनम्।  
यदा द्रक्ष्यसि भूतेशं त्र्यक्षं शूलधरं शिवम्।  
तदा दातास्मि ते तात दिव्यान्यस्त्राणि सर्वशः।  
क्रियतां दर्शने यत्नो देवस्य परमेष्ठिनः।  
दर्शनात्तस्य कौन्तेय संसिद्धः स्वर्गमेष्यसि॥**

 Indra having disappeared, Arjuna commenced his Tapas accordingly at Himavat.

**एकः पार्थो महातेजा हिमवत्पृष्ठमाश्रितः।  
उग्रे तपसि दुष्पारे स्थितो धूमापयन् दिशः॥**

 Siva came before Arjuna in the disguise of a Kiratha or mountaineer and after some hard fight appeared in his true form, when Arjuna worshipped and praised him. The Astra called Pasupatha and the bow named Gandiva were then presented to Arjuna,

**ददामि तेऽस्त्रंदयितमहं पाशुपतं विभो।  
अवध्यो नाम नास्त्यस्य त्रैलोक्ये सचराचरे।  
मनसा चक्षुषा वाचा धनुषा च निपात्यते॥**

**धनुर्महद्दितिज पिशाच सूदनम्।  
ददौ भवःपुरुषवराय गाण्डिवम्॥**

 The Loka-palas then appeared pleased before Arjuna and presented him with various Astras. In the meantime Indra sent his car which took him to Swarga-loka which is described in the following terms.

**ततो ददर्श शक्रस्य पुरी ताममरावर्ती।  
नातप्ततपसा शक्यो द्रष्टुं नानाहिताग्निना।  
स लोकः पुण्यकतॄणां नापि युद्धे पराङ्मुखैः।  
नायज्वभिर्नाव्रतिकैर्नवेदश्रुतिवर्जितैः।  
नानाप्लुताङ्गैस्तीर्थेषु यज्ञदान बहिष्कृतैः।  
नापियज्ञहनैैःक्षुद्रैद्रष्टुंशक्यःकथञ्चन।  
पानपैर्गुरुतल्पैश्चमांसादैर्वा दुरात्मभिः॥**

 "Amaravati, the city of Indra is invisible to the irreligious, the immoral and the illiterate. The drunkards, flesh-eaters and debauchees have no hopes of access there."

 Arjuna stayed there with Indra for five years and obtained several Astras from Indra and studied the heavenly dance and music from Chitrasena.

**स शक्रहस्ताद्दयितं वज्रमस्त्रं दुरुत्सहम्।  
अशनिं च महानादां मेघबृंहितलक्षणाम्।  
गृहीतास्त्रास्तु कौन्तेयो भ्रातृृन् सस्मार पाण्डवः।**

**पुरन्दरनियोगाच्च पञ्चाब्दमवसत्सुखम्।  
ततः शक्रोब्रवीत्पार्थ कृतास्त्रं काल आगते।  
नृत्तं गतिं च कौन्तेय चित्रसेनादवाप्नुहि।  
वादित्रं दैवावहितं नृलोके यन्न विद्यते॥**

 Thus far, the Puranic description should be understood before proceeding further. The geography and history detailed should not be misunderstood. The Himavat, Gandhamadana and Indrakila mountains specified above are surely not the Indian ranges of hills. We have often noticed that Indra re presents the Kshetregna or Prana-

**शरीरमध्यवर्त्ती प्राणभावेन क्षेत्रज्ञसंज्ञकः। निरुक्तम्॥**

 The five years' stay in Indra-loka by Arjuna alludes to the control obtained over the five vital airs, the sub-divisions of Prana. This could be attained only after securing the Pasupatha astra from Siva, that is, after subduing the Pasus, beasts, or passions, by the grace of the Lord of Pasus or Pasupathi. While Arjuna was in heaven, an interesting incident is narrated to have occurred. Urvasi, the president of the heavenly damsels was asked by Indra to go to Arjuna and please him. Arjuna having declined to accept her she cursed him to become a eunuch. By  
Indra's permission, this curse was reserved to be profitably utilized for one year, during the stay of the Pandavas incognito at Virata's court.

**अज्ञातवासो वस्तव्यो भवद्भिर्भूतलेनघ।**  
**वर्षे त्रयोदशे वीर तत्र त्वं गमयिष्यसि।**  
**तेन नर्त्तकवेषेण अपुंस्त्वेन तथैव च।**  
**वर्षमेकं विहृत्यैव ततः पुंस्त्वमवाप्स्यसि॥**

 The significance of these heavenily damsels has been already noticed as referring to the extraordinary powers

accruing to the Yogis in the course of their practice and that any attachment to the will greatly tend to obstruct further progress of Yoga.

**सर्वाश्च ब्रह्मवादिन्यो महायोगाश्च ताः स्मृताः॥**

 Even in the text, Urvasi herself mentions this fact, which requires only to be correctly understood, by advancing a single step over the Pandit's silliness and low standard of education. The Apasaras are described as damsels owing to the fact that the powers specified appear to the Yogis irrespective of caste, creed or age according to their tapas.

**अनावृताश्चसर्वाः स्म देवराजाभिनन्दन।**  
**गुरुस्थाने न मां वीर नियोक्तुं त्वमिहार्हसि।**  
**पितरः सोदराः पुत्रा नप्तारो वा त्विहागताः।**  
**तपसा रमयन्त्यस्मात्र च तेषां व्यतिक्रमः॥**

 "Urvasi said. O! Arjuna! we are damsels without marriage. You need not therefore treat us as elders. Fathers, grand-fathers, brothers, sons, grandsons, all are alike enjoyed by us according to their tapas."

 The description of the incident here is too plain to be misunderstood, as forming part of human history, referring to some brothels of any civilised towns of the modern day, except perhaps by those who are extremely dull or wicked. Literally interpreted as at present, the incident could hardly afford any possible hope of drawing moral lessons, in accordance with the professed theory of modern interpretations. The real import of the story is however a terrible blow causing utter disappointment to the Pandit, who eagerly expects to secure fair damsels in Heaven, by his so-called religious devotion in misinterpreting the sacred literature. The sacred story does not in the least convey any wicked ideas in itself, but it vividly exposes the modern wickedness. in its careless misinterpretation.

 Arjuna's display of moral courage in having declined Urvasi's offer was appreciated and the hearing of the story itself is pronounced to be effective in that direction.

**य इमां शृणुयान्नित्यं धृतिं पाण्डुसुतस्य वै।**  
**न तस्य कामः कामेषु पापकेषु प्रवर्त्तते॥**

**इदममरवरात्मजस्य घोरम्**  
**शुचिचरितं विनिशाम्य फल्गुनस्य।**  
**व्यपगत मददम्भरागदोषा**  
**स्त्रिदिवगताभिरमन्ति मानवेन्द्राः॥**

 While in the forest a fragrant lotus of thousand petals fell before Panchali wafted by the wind. She asked Bhima to procure some flowers of the kind for her and Bhima left her in search of the flowers. On his way he met Hanuman in the Kadalivana on the valleys of the Gandhamadana who prevented Bhima from going further in that direction as being a dangerous path for human beings destitute of Yoga-Sidhi.

**अतः परमगम्योयं पर्वतः सुदुरारुहः।  
विना सिद्धगतिंवीर गतिरत्र न विद्यते।  
देवलोकस्य मार्गोयमगम्यो मानुषैः सदा॥**

 "The mountain beyond this is inaccessible to those devoid of sidhis, and it is the path leading to Heaven."

 But in the mean time he was shown the way to the lake which contained the flowers, belonging to Kubera. After much fighting with the Yakshas there, Bhima gathered many of the flowers and brought them with him with the assent of Kubera.

**तेषां वचस्तत्तु निशाम्य देवः**  
**प्रहास्य रक्षांसि ततोभ्युवाच।**  
**गृह्णातु भीमो जलजानि कामं**  
**कृष्णा निमित्तं विदितं ममैतत्॥**

 The lotus described here refers to Pushkarom or the internal Akasa which could be seen only by permission of Kubera, the Lord of Tapas.

**आमन्त्र्य यक्षराजं वै ततः पिबहरस्व च।  
नातोन्यथा त्वया शक्यं किञ्चित्पुष्करमीक्षितुम्॥**

**पुष्करं अन्तरिक्षं पूजाकरत्वात्। निरुक्तम्॥**

 The Pandavas then proceeded to the Asrama of Nara-Narayana, anxiously expecting to see Arjuna returning from heaven. After some time Arjuna returned to the Gandha-madana and joined his brothers.

**आगछदर्जुनः प्रतिः प्रहृष्टो गन्धमादनम्॥**

 While roaming in the forest Bhima was attacked by a boaconstrictor and in spite of his well known strength he was unable to get out of its clutches. It was Nahusha one of the ancestors of the Pandavas who had to undergo the effects of a curse from Agastya in this serpent form until met by Yudhishtira. At the intervention of Yudhishtira, the serpent was accordingly transformed into a heavenly being and Nahusha returned to heaven greatly pleased.

**इत्युक्त्वाजगरं देहं मुक्त्वा स नहुषो नृपः।  
दिव्यं वपुः समास्थाय गतस्त्रिदिवमेव ह॥**

 While the Pandavas still continued to stay in the Dwyta-vana, Duryodhana accompanied by Karna and others came to this forest for a picnic party. The Gandharvas residing there attacked them and bound them up, while the Kurus cried out for help. The Pandavas then proceeded to the spot, fought with the Gandharvas and released the Kurus in the presence of Yudhishtira. Duryodhana then returned to Hastinapura quite ashamed and crest-fallen.

**पाण्डवेनाभ्यनुज्ञातो राजा दुर्योधनस्तदा।  
अभिवाद्य धर्मपुत्रं गतेन्द्रिय इवातुरः।  
विदीर्यमाणौव्रीडावान् जगाम नगरं प्रति।  
तस्मिन् गते कौरवेये कुन्तीपुत्रो युधिष्ठिरः।  
भ्रातृभिस्सहितो वीरः पूज्यमानो द्विजातिभिः।  
तथा द्वैतवने तस्मिन् विजहार मुदावुतः॥**

 After the Kurus returned to Hastinapura the Pandavas lived comfortably in the Dwyta-vana. The advent of the Kurus even to this forest refers to the annoyance and obstruction invariably occurring against the practiceof Yoga.

 The Gandharvas constantly found described in the religious texts generally represent the days and nights vide, Bhagavathom.

**चण्डवेग इति ख्यातो गन्धर्वाधिपतिर्नृप।  
गन्धर्वस्तस्य बलिनःषष्ठ्युत्तरशतत्रयम्।  
गन्धर्व्यस्तादृशीरस्य मैथुन्यञ्च सितासिताः।  
परिवृत्या विलम्पन्ति सर्वकामविनिर्मिताम्।  
ते चण्डवेगानुचराः पुरञ्जनपुरं यदा॥**

 "The King of the Gantharvas named Chanda-vega lives in the town of Puranjana. He has 360 Gantharvas as his followers and the same number of Gantharvis. They are of white and black colour."

 Here the town named Puranjana refers to the human body. The king named Chanda-vega or violently swift refers to Time. The 360 Gantharvas and 360 Gantharvis allude to the 360 days and nights. The black and white colours allude to the bright and dark fortnights. The Gantharvas however, are never explained anywhere as representing cannibals or other extinct races in Europe or America, Asia or Africa.

 At the close of the twelve years' forest life of the Pandavas, Indra in the interest of his son Arjuna proposed to deprive Karna of his natural earings and coat with which he was born, by begging of him for the same in the disguise of a Bramhin.

**द्वादशे समतिक्रान्ते वर्षे प्राप्ते त्रयोदशे।**  
**पाण्डूनां हितकृत् शक्रःकर्ण भिक्षितुमुद्यतः॥**

 Although prevented by the Sun from parting with the earings and coat, Karna gave them away to Indra and obtained a weapon called Sakti in return. The description of these natural coat and earings as well as of the origin and character of Karna is particularly noteworthy. The earings are said to have originated froin Amrita and presented to the Sun by Aditi. Karna was so named from the fact of his having been born with them. He was also known by the name of Vasushena in reference to the natural coat or armour over his body.

**अदित्या कुण्डले राज्ञि दत्ते मे मत्तकाशिनी।**  
**तस्मै दास्यामि वामोरु वर्म चैवेदमुत्तमम्।**  
**अमृतादुत्थितं दिव्यं तनु वर्म सुकुण्डलम्।**  
**नाम कर्म च चक्रुस्ते कुण्डले तस्य दृश्यते।**  
**कर्ण इत्येव तं बालं दृष्ट्या कर्णसकुण्डलम्।**  
**वसु वर्म घरं दृष्ट्वा तं बालं हेमकुण्डलम्।**  
**नामास्यवसुषेणेति ततश्चक्रुर्द्विजातयः॥**

 Karna is said to have been born of Kunti by the Sun before she attained maturity. He is thus virtually the oldest brother of the Pandavas. In his younger days he was brought up by Soota and was called also Vrisha meaning a meritorious act. He was early associated with the Kurus and became jealous of Arjuna. Karna was well known for his acts of charity, as he would decline to none the offer of anything begged of him. His name is still a byword for charity in India.

**वसुषेण इति ख्यातो वृष इत्येव च प्रभुः।**  
**सूतस्य ववृधेङ्गेषु ज्येष्ठः पुत्रः स वीर्यवान्।**  
**संधाय धार्तराष्ट्रेण पार्थानां विप्रिये रतः।**  
**योधुमाशंसते नित्यं फल्गुनेन महात्मना।**  
**सदा हि तस्य स्पर्धासीदर्जुनेन विशाम्पते।**  
**अर्जुनस्य च कर्णेन यतो द्वन्द्वं बभूव ह।**  
**एतत्गुह्यं महाराज सूर्यस्यासीन्न संशयः॥**

**यदा च कर्णो राजेन्द्र भानुमन्तं दिवाकरम्।**  
**स्तौति मध्यं दिने प्राप्ते प्राञ्जलिस्सलिलोस्थितः।**  
**तत्रैनमुपतिष्ठन्ति ब्राह्मणा धनहेतुना।**  
**नादेयं तस्य तत्काले किञ्चिदस्ति द्विजातिषु॥**

 From these descriptions, it can be easily inferred that Karna chiefly represents charity. Karna or ear alludes to the Sastras, the Deva-hu and the Pitri-hu as already noticed in the previous pages referring to the left and right ears. Karna's jealousy towards Arjuna denotes the differences of religious views existing between a Yogi and a mere charitable person.

**पितृहू दक्षिणःकर्णःदेवहू चोत्तरस्मृतः॥**

 The last incident mentioned in the Vana-parva is the appearance of Dharma father of Yudhishtira in the form of an Yeksha. He first took away from a bramhin in the forest, the wooden pieces used for kindling the sacred fire, in the guise of a wild animal. On the representation of this fact by the Bramhin to the Pandavas, they went a long way in quest of the animal but missed it. All of them having become tired and thirsty on account of the long march, the younget brother went to procure water from a pond close by. The Yeksha appeared there and asked him to answer certain questions before he ventured to drink the water. As no attention was paid to his order, the Yekaha

caused him to fall senseless. Then one after another the other brothers came to the pond and met with the same result except Yudhishtira who agreed to answer all the questions. The Yeksha then appeared in his true form renewed the life of all the four brothers and bestowed several boons on them. The questions asked by the Yeksha are well-known as Yeksha prasnas. They deal with various important matters and are well worth a reading. The special boon obtained on the occasion was to the effect thatthe Pandavas and Panchali would not be recognised by the public in whatever disguise they might appear during the thirteenth year of their exile.

**वर्ष त्रयोदशमिदं मत्प्रसादात् कुरूद्वहाः।**  
**विराटनगरे गूढा अविज्ञाताश्चरिष्यथ।**  
**यद्वःसङ्कल्पितं रूपं मनसा यस्य यादृशम्।**  
**तादृशं तादृशं सर्वे छन्दतो धारयिष्यथ।**  
**अरणी सहितं भाण्डं ब्राह्मणाय प्रयछत।**  
**जिज्ञासार्थं मया ह्येतदाहृतं मृगरूपिणा॥**

 The real import of the Agnata-vasa or living incognito for one year, after twelve years of forest life, would be more easily understood, as we proceed with the next Virata-parva. The expression 'छन्दतोधारयिष्यथ' may be particularly remembered for future reference. It ordinarily means that any forms desired may be assumed as a disguise. It also clearly means that the forms prescribed by the Vedas, Chandas, shall alone be accepted for religious meditation. The possibilities afforded by the Sanskrit language for expressions conveying different meanings are taken advantange of particularly in the Puranic descriptions, which are often left unnoticed owing to the ignorance of the main subject altogether.

**THE VIRATA-PARVA.**

** 11.** The Pandavas in the Virata's court. The Virata-parva contains seventy-eight chapters and they would be particularly an interesting reading as a dramatic composition to all students of Sanskrit literature. The incidents therein narrated are dealt with in a style worthy of high appreciation. The general plot is greatly interesting and the whole of it is a production of high literary merit. Those who can afford to read and understand Sanskrit poetry may not be wasting their time in going right through the Parva which would be found in no way inferior to the best dramatic works now known in the Sanskrit language. It does not matter much, if this portion of the text is for that very reason viewed as interpolations of modern times, if only the contents are correctly understood and the skill and beauty of treatment properly appreciated as applied to ordinary story telling as well as to the Puranic method of expressing philosophical facts. The parting advice of Dhowmya to the Pandavas, the self-introductions of the Pandavas and Panchali in the court of the king of Virata in variously disguised forms, their stay in the Palace for one full year incognito, the destruction of Kichaka and his six hundred brothers at the instance of Panchali by Bhima, the attempt of the Kurus to rob all the cows in the country and their recovery by Uttara son of Virata, with the help of Arjuna in the disguise of a eunuch, the appearance of the Pandavas in their real form taking Virata by surprise and

the marriage of Uttars, Virata's daughter to Abhimanyu son of Arjuna, are all told in the most interesting manner, pleasing both to the general reader of stories and histories as well as to the real student of the Puranic subject. Such is the characteristic feature of the ancient Puranas and Itihasas, the authors of which are now condemned as ignorant of the correct method of writing history. Whereas the process of treating other subjects in the historical form, with the object of appealing to the common people is yet an unknown and unthought of idea to the other nations. A few quotations may be here given to convince the readers of the truth of the views here expressed.

 The Pandavas proposed to stay in the court of Virata for one year in disguise, as he was admitted to be the best available and most friendly monarch.

**अवश्यन्त्वेव वासार्थे रमणीयं शिवं सुखम्।**  
**सम्मन्त्र्यसहितैः सर्वैर्द्रष्टव्यमकुतो भयम्।**  
**मात्स्यो विराटो बलवानभिरक्तीथ पाण्डवान्।**  
**धर्मशीलो वदान्यश्च वृद्धः सत्स्वपि सम्मतः।**  
**गुणवान् लोकविख्यातो दृढभक्तिर्जितेन्द्रियः।**  
**तत्र मे रोचते पार्थ मत्स्यराजान्तिकैनघ।**  
**विराटनगरे तात मासान् द्वादश सम्मितान्।**  
**कुर्वन्तस्तस्य कर्माणि वसामो यदि रोचते॥**

 The five brothers and Panchali individually proposed to take different disguised forms. Yudhishtira undertook to appear as a Sanyasi, Kanka by name, proficient in the play of dice made of ivory, gold and gems and well versed in philosophy and other sciences. He proposed to say that he was once attached to the court of Yudhishtira.

**विराटं समनुप्राप्य राजानं मात्स्यनन्दनम्।  
सभास्तारो भविष्यामि विराटस्येति मे मतिः।**

**कंको नाम ब्रुवाणोहं मताक्षः साधु देविता।**  
**वैडूर्यान् काञ्चनान् दान्तान् स्फाटिकान् राजतानपि।**  
**कृष्णाक्षान् लोहिताक्षांश्च निवप्स्यामि मनोरमान्।**  
**द्विजो व्रतेनास्मि न च स्वतः प्रभो**  
**सम्मुडितः प्रत्रजितस्त्रिदण्डभृत्।**  
**इदं शरीरं मम पश्य मानुषं**  
**समावृतं पञ्चभिरेव धातुभिः॥**

**ममेह पञ्चेन्द्रियगात्रदर्शिनो**  
**वदन्ति पञ्चैव पितॄन् यथा श्रुतिः।**  
**मनुष्यजातित्वमचिन्तयन्नहम्**  
**न चास्मि तुल्यः पितृभिः स्वभावतः॥**

**युधिष्ठिरस्यापि सखाऽभवं पुरा**  
**गृहप्रवेशी च शरीरमेव च।**  
**गृहे च तस्योषितवानहं सुखम्**  
**राजास्मि तस्य स्वपुरेऽभवं पुरा॥**

**वैयाघ्रपद्योस्मि नरेन्द्र गोत्रत**  
**स्तदेव सौख्यं मृगयामहे वयम्।**  
**मुक्तोस्मि कामाच्च धनाच साम्प्रतम्**  
**त्वदाश्रये वस्तुमिहाभ्युपागतः॥**

**अक्षानिवप्तुं कुशलोस्म्यहं सदा**  
**पराजितः शकुनिरुतानि चिन्तयन्।**  
**मृगद्विजानाञ्च रुतानि चिन्तय**  
**निराश्रयः प्राव्रजितोस्मि भिक्षुकः॥**

 Kanka, the name assumed by Yudhishtira refers clearly to Bramah–kshetrom. It is well expressed in the text itself.

**द्विजो व्रतेनास्मि न च स्वतः प्रभो॥**

 Yudhishtira has still the dice to play but they are made of superior materials.

**वैडूर्यान् काञ्चनान् दान्तान् स्फाटिकान् राजतानपि॥**

 Virata literally means the universal or generalised Intellect. From the sensations leading outward, the Pandavas have now turned to the Intellect inward or to the secret living in Virata's court. The valuable dice are used for playing here, and this refers to the use of sensations suited for superior meditation within. The story clearly refers to the Yogic process knowu as अन्तर्दृश्यानुविद्धं as opposed to बहिर्द्दश्यानुविद्धम्॥

 Bhima agreed to serve as a cook by name Valala.

**सूदोहं वललो नामा सूपकारो नराधिप।**  
**उपस्थास्यामि राजानं विराटमिति रोचये।**  
**रागप्रकाराध बहून् फलाश्रयान्**  
**महानसे मे न समोस्ति सूपकृत्।**  
**त्वमन्नसंस्कारविधौ प्रशाधि माम्**  
**भवामि तेहं नरदेव सूपकृत्॥**

**स्वकर्मतुष्टाश्च वयं नराधिप**  
**प्रशाधि मां सूदपदे यदीछसि।**  
**ये सन्ति मल्ला बलवीर्यसंमता**  
**स्तानेव योत्स्यामि तवाभिहर्षयन्॥**

 The couplets quoted here, if carefully read, would suggest various interesting meanings pertinent to the subject, and it is hoped that the skill displayed in the use of expressions capable of such interpretations will be evident without much scrutiny.

 Supa means soup as well as an arrow or breath. Mahanasa means a kitchen, also the great nose referring to the Yogic method of regulating breath. breath. Sooda means to cook, also to suppress or kill. With these different interpretations, it is not difficult to understand the whole description as representing a process of Prana–yama, Bhima being the

son of Vayu or air. The following expression is repeated in the introductions meaning that each one of them is interested in Swa–karma, meditation of the self or Atma.

**स्वकर्मतुष्टाश्चवयं नराधिप॥**

 Arjuna proposed to appear as & eunuch, by name *Brihannala*, well–versed in music and dance, and applied to Virata for the tutorship to his daughter Uttara.

**उभौ कम्बू प्रतीमुच्य कुण्डले परिपातुके।**  
**वेणीकृतशिरा भूत्वा भविष्यामि बृहन्नला।**  
**स्त्रीभावसमुदाचारान्नृत्यगीत कथाश्रयैः।**  
**छादयिष्यामि राजेन्द्र माययात्मानमात्मना।**  
**कृष्णे च रक्ते च निबध्य वाससी**  
**शरीरवान् शुक्रबृहस्पतिप्रभः।**  
**क्लैब्येन वेषेण न भाति भाति च**  
**ग्रहाभिपन्नो नभसीव चन्द्रमाः॥**

**स्नानं चरेयं विमृजे च दर्पणम्**  
**विशेषकेष्वेव च कौशलं मम।**  
**नृत्यामि गायामि च वादयाम्यहम्**  
**प्रनर्त्तने कौशल नैपुणं मम।**  
**तदुतरायाः परिधत्स्व नर्त्तने**  
**भवामि देव्या नरदेव नर्त्तकी॥**

 Kambumeans two veins, Brihat is great aad nala, a tubular vessel, Leaving the two nadis called Ida and Pingala, the male and the female, the central Sushumnaor the great nadı is here represented as neuter gender. The red and black cloths tied round mean that tamas and rajas are controlled.

**कृष्णे च रक्तेच निबध्य वाससी॥**

 The proficiency expressed regarding the cleaning of mirrors refers clearly to the purification of the heart.

**स्नानं चरेयं विभृजेन दर्पणम्॥**

 The teaching of dancing and music to Uttara refers to Uttara–marga or the inward turn of mind.

 Nakula agreed to be the controller of horses, by name Dama–granthi, well–versed in their training and treatment,

**दामग्रन्थी परिज्ञातः कुशलो दामकर्मणि।**  
**कुशलोस्म्यश्च शिक्षायां तथैवाश्चचिकित्सने।**  
**अश्वानां प्रकृतिं वोम्निविनयं चापि सर्वशः।**  
**दुष्टानां प्रतिपतिं च कृत्स्नं चैव चिकित्सितम्॥**

 There is no doubt that the control of the senses is clearly represented here.

 Sahadeva proposed to be the keeper of cows and bulls, by name Tantri–pala and well qualified to train them and treat them.

**स्वकर्मष्टाश्च वयं नराधिप**  
**प्रशाधि मां गोपरिरक्षणेनध।**  
**क्षिप्रथ गावो बहुला भवन्ति**  
**न तासु रोगो भवतीह कश्चित्।**  
**वैस्तैरुपायै र्विदितं मयैत**  
**देतानि शिल्पानि मयि स्थितानि॥**

**ऋषभानपि जानामि राजन् पूजितलक्षणान्।**  
**येषां मूत्रमुपाघ्राय अपि बन्ध्या प्रसूयते॥**

 Here Go or cow refers to light or knowledge and Rishabha or bull represents Dharma. Panchali proposed to appear as a maid servant, by name Syrandhri qualified to attend to the toilet of the young princesses.

**सैरन्ध्री नाम मे जातिर्वन्यमूलफलाशमा।**  
**जानामि केशान् ग्रथितुं विचित्रान् ग्रथितुं मणीन्।**  
**आराधयं सत्यभामां कृष्णस्य महिषीं प्रियाम्।**

**कृष्णाञ्च भार्यां पार्थानां नारीणामुत्तमां तथा।**  
**तथास्मि सुभ्रुवा चाहमिष्टलाभेन तोषिता।**  
**मालिनी चेति मे नाम स्वयं देवी चकार ह।**  
**कृष्णा कमलपत्राक्षी सा मे प्राणसमा सखी।**  
**न चाहं चिरमिछामि क्वचिद्वस्तुं शुभानने।**  
**व्रतं किलैतदस्माकं कुलधर्मोयमीदृशः।**  
**गुरवो मम धर्मश्च वायुः शक्रस्तथाश्विनौ।**  
**तेषां प्रसादाच्च न मां कश्चिद्धर्षयते पुमान्।**  
**नाहं शक्या बिराटेन यद्वा चान्येन केनचित्।**  
**देवगन्धर्वयक्षैर्वा द्रष्टुं दुष्टेन चेतसा**  
**मन्धर्वाः पालयन्ते मां सुकुलाः पञ्च सुव्रताः।**  
**यश्च दुःशीलवान् मर्त्यो मां स्पृशेद्दुष्टचेतसा।**  
**स तामेव निशां शीघ्रं शयीत मुसलैर्हतः॥**

 Syrandhri, literally means a woman of a mixed tribe, a huntress catching wild animals, alluding to the power of destroying evil passions. The name 'Malini' alleged to have been given to her by Panchali, represents the celestial Ganga or Sushumna nadi itself.

**मालिनी चेति मे नाम स्वयं देवी चकार ह॥**

 Influenced by evil passions, none can afford to see her with impunity.

**नाहं शक्या विराटेन यद्वा चान्येन केनचित्।**  
**देवगन्धर्वयक्षैर्वा द्रष्टुं दुष्टेन चेतसा॥**

 We could thus easily observe that the significance of Panchali is systematically kept up even in her disguised form. Ten months after the stay of the Pandavas in Virata's court, Kichaka, the brother–in–law of Virata and the officer commanding his army met Panchali and fell in love with her,

**महारथेषु छन्नेषु मासा दश समाययुः।**  
**तस्मिन् वर्षे गतप्राये कीचकस्तु महाबलः।**  
**सेनापतिविराटस्य दर्दश द्रुपदात्मजाम्।**  
**तां दृष्ट्वा देवगर्भाभां चरन्तीं देवतामिव।**  
**कीचकः कामयामास कामबाणप्रपीडितः॥**

 Syrandhri once went to Kichaka's quarters under instructions from Sudeshna wife of Virata, carrying an empty pot to fetch the best spirituous liquor. On this occasion Kichaka attemtped to ravage her. Leaving the pot, she ran to the Sabha of Virata and prostrated before the assembly. Kichaka ran behind her and kicked her with his foot in the presence of all gathered there.

**सा गृहीता विधून्वन्ती भूमौ निक्षिप्य भाजनम्।**  
**सभां शरणमाधावद्यत्र राजा युधिष्ठिरः।**  
**तां कीचकः प्रधावन्तीं केशपक्षे परामृशत्।**  
**पातयित्वा तु तां भूमौ सूतपुत्रः पदाऽबधीत्।**  
**सभायां पश्यतो राज्ञो विराटस्य महात्मनः॥**

 Kichaka is represented as the brother in–law of Virata and brother of Sudeshna. He is described as an investigator and a fault finder or critic. He could please people by talking and arguing, regarding the utility of actions. He is therefore a utilitarian longing for material enjoyments and provided with the necessary means of securing the same. His 605 younger brothers represent the subdivisions or lower kinds of desires. His relationship with Virata clearly proves that Kichaka stands for the effects of false reasoning. Kichaka literally means a hollow reed used for producing sound and Upa Kichaka a smaller variety of the same. The destruction of Kichaka and his brothers by Bhima son of Vayu or air, therefore alludes to some variety of Pranayama prescribed in the Yoga Sastras.

**वीर्यवान् दयितो राज्ञोदर्पोत्सिक्तश्चकीचकः।**  
**साम्पराये परिक्रुष्टो बलवान् दुर्जयो रणे।**  
**आसीत्प्रहर्त्ता शत्रूणां दारदर्शी च दुर्मतिः।**  
**स्यालो राज्ञो विराटस्य सेनापतिरुदारधीः।**  
**सुदेष्णायानुजः क्रूरः शूरो वारो गतव्यथः।**  
**विजितारिर्महायुद्धे प्रचण्डो मानतत्परः।**  
**नरनारीमनोह्लादी धीरो वाग्मी रणप्रियः।**  
**पुण्यकर्मार्थकामानां भाजनं मनुजोत्तमः॥**

 The word Dara means a wife as well as a cleft or rent. A daradersi thus refers to a finder of flaws or a critic.

 When the destruction of Kichaka by Bhima in the guise of a Gandharva became publicly known, the Kurus began to suspect that the Pandavas may be in Virata's court in disguise and that Bhima has likely killed Kichaka. They therefore proposed an expedition to the country of Virata for the purpose of carrying away all his cows, when the Pandavas thought would probably appear before them for defence and might be conveniently then detected and made to go back to the forest for another period of twelve years in accordance with their previous pledge.

**ध्रुवं कृष्णानिमित्तं तु भीमसेनेन सूतजाः।**  
**गध्धर्वव्यपदेशेन हता निशि न संशयः।**  
**पितामहेन ये चोक्तादेशस्य च जनस्य च।**  
**गुणास्ते मत्स्यराष्ट्रेषु बहुशोपि मया श्रुताः।**  
**विराटनगरे मन्ये पाण्डवा छन्नचारिणः।**  
**निवसन्ति पुरे रम्ये तत्र यात्रा विधीयताम्।**  
**मत्स्यराष्ट्रं गमिष्यामो ग्रहीष्यामश्च गोधनम्।**  
**गृहीते गोधने नूनं तेपि योत्स्यन्ति पाण्डवाः।**  
**अपूर्णे समये चापि यदि पश्येम पाण्डवान्।**  
**द्वादशान्यानि वर्षाणि प्रवेक्ष्यन्ति पुनर्वनम्॥**

 When the cows were accordingly being robbed and carried away by the Kurus, complaints were made before Uttara son of Virata while he was in the female apartment. Uttara undertook to defend and fight against all the Kurus and said he wanted but a proper charioteer. Syrandhri did not relish this unmerited boasting on the part of the prince and she therefore asked Brihannala privately to set up Uttara the daughter of Virata to suggest to her brother the name of Brihannala as the best available charioteer. Uttara then started accordingly with Brihannala for the rescue of the cows, and when the grand army of the Kurus appeard at a distance he grew terrified and wanted to retreat–Brihannala persuaded him in vain to meet the enemies. He had thus to reveal the mystery of the Pandavas' disguise in the court of Uttara's father, to induce him to undertake at least the charioteer's part, while Brihannala himself fought the battle and gained victory over all the Kurus. With a view to ascertain oftruth of Brihannala's statement as to his own identication with Arjuna, Uttara demanded the enumeration of the ten well–known names of Arjuna and the causes for their application. This incident is ingeniously introduced here for the purpose of furnishing necessary clues to the reader to understand the full significance of Arjuna, and the passage concerned is therefore well worth our eareful notice.

**अर्जुनः फल्गुनो विष्णुः किरीटी श्वेतवाहनः।**  
**बीभत्सुर्विजयः पार्थः सव्यसाची धनञ्जयः।**

**जातो हिमवतः पृष्ठे तेन मां फल्गुनं विदुः।**  
**यो ममाङ्गे व्रणं कुर्यात् भ्रातुर्येष्ठस्य पश्यतः।**  
**युधिष्ठिरस्य रुधिरं दर्शयेद्वा कदाचन।**  
**पराभवमहं तस्य कुलेकुर्यान्न संशयः।**  
**योत्स्यामि तैरहं सर्वैर्न मे तेभ्यः पराभवः।**  
**तेन देवमनुष्येषु जिष्णुर्न्नामस्मि विश्रुतः।**  
**माता मम पृथा नाम तेन मां पार्थमब्रुवन्।**  
**देवदानवगन्धर्व पिशाचोरगराक्षसान्।**  
**अहं पुरा रणे जित्वा खाण्डवेग्रिमतर्पयम्।**  
**हुताशनं तर्पयित्वा सहितः शार्ङधन्वना।**  
**त्रिविष्टपगतौ दृष्ट्वा पितामह महेश्वरौ।**  
**मूर्छायां पतितं भूमावागतौ देवसत्तमौ।**  
**दृष्ट्वा तौ वरदौ देवौ संज्ञां लब्ध्वोत्थितः पुनः।**  
**मूर्धा हि प्रणतं भूमौ तौ देवौ वरदौ वरौ।**  
**कृष्णेत्येकादशंनाम प्रीत्या मे च ऋतुस्तदा॥**

 The meanings of these ten or rather eleven names are explained in the above passage in the usual Puranic style. They should not be simply literally interpreted without due regard for the philosophical ideas they would otherwise convey. It is necessary to see whether such higher meanings are not consistently kept up throughout the descriptions—

 "I sit over the treasures acquired from all the countries conquered by me, I am therefore called Dhanom–Jaya". Jana–pada or country is opposed to a nagara or town. The name thus signifies the conquest over all mean passions.—

 "I never retreat from a battle field without victory, I am therefore called Vijaya". Thorough practice in every yogic process is here clearly meant.

 "White horses are yoked to my charriot while fighting with the enemies, and I am therefore known as Swetavahana". White horses clearly point to satwic development.

 During the battle I wear a crown given me by Indra which cannot be damaged or shaken by the enemies. I am therefore called Kiriti". This alludes to the resoluteness in the religious meditations.

 "While fighting I commit no loathful act and am therefore called Bibhatsu." "I can use the bow with both my hands alike but the left hand is more dexterous and I am therefore known as Savya–sachi." This refers to the proficiency in both Karma–kanda and Gnana–kanda, and points to the greater inclination to the latter. "I ain called Arjuna on account of my purest colour and form." High satwic character is thus specified.

 "I was born in the valleys of the Himavat during day time, under the constellation Phalguni, when it was in a

north–eastern position. I am therefore called Phalguna" This description is full of meaning. Himavat is explained by Sri–Sankara as follows.

 हिमरूपः सर्वदा शीतलः स्वयं प्रकाशमान आनन्दात्मान्तर्हित यक्षस्वरूपः स यस्य नित्यमस्त्युपनिषद्विभागस्य स हिमवान्॥

 "He who has the ever blissful Atma close at hand is Himavat." North east is another significant term, both north as well as east refer to the ganana–marga as opposed to south and west, karma–marga:

 Phalguna means small or minute. Putting these interpretations together we obtain the idea of something slightly bordering on ganana–yoga and a complete achievement of karma-yoga.

 Any one hurting me or Yudhishtira will be treated as my enemy and fought against with succcess. Hence I am called Jishnu". This term is generally applied to the Sun and Indra as well as Vishnu.

 "My mother's name being Pritha, I am called Partha." This term applies to individuality or separateness, signifying Jivatma as distinct from Paramatma.

 "After the destruction of the Khandava Forest, I went to Swarga accompanied by Sri-krishna, where Bramha and Siva gave me, quite pleased, the additional eleventh title Krishna". This description clearly alludes to the nearest approach made to Sri–Krishna's qualifications, after attaining the yogic process signified by the burning of the Khandava–forest.

 In this connection, it may be useful to note that the weapons of the Pandavas are said to have been left on a tree called sami standing within a cremation ground, before they entered Virata's country in disguise, the chief weapon being

Gandiva, the bow of Arjuna. This bow is said to have been retained by Bramaha in the beginning for a thousand years. It was then in the hands of Siva, Indra, Soma, Varuna and Agni successively, before Arjuna obtained it at last.

 The term Gandiva may refer to a joint or knot probably between the eye–brows, as Ganda means a rhinoceros with a tusk on the forehead. Sami, the name of the tree in the cremation ground in which the bow was tied up in the shape of a hanging dead body alludes to the subjugation of the senses. The word sami means, peacefulness and the dead body refers to the destruction of materiality.

 A day after the cows were rescued from the Kurus and the enemy forced to retreat, the Pandavas changed their disguise and occupied the seats in Virata's sabha specially reserved for monarchs of position. Virata was thus taken by surprise and offered his country to the Pandavas and

proposed the marriage of his daughter Uttara to Arjuna. The Pandavas declined to accept the country but agreed to have Uttara married to Abhimanyu, son of Arjuna by Subhadra.

**वयं वनान्तरात्प्राप्ता न ते राज्यं गृहामहे।**  
**किं तु दुर्योधनादीनां राज्ञां राज्यं गृहामहे।**  
**प्रतिगृह्णाम्यहं राजन्, स्नुषां दुहितरं तव।**  
**युक्तोह्यावां हि सम्बन्धो मात्स्यभारतवंशयोः।**  
**स्नुषार्थमुत्तरां राजन् प्रतिगृह्णामि ते सुताम्।**

 The marriage was accordingly celebrated with great festivity. Sri–Krishna was present on the occasion to witness the marriage of his own nephew. The Virata–Parva ends with the description of this marriage. Abhimanyu has been already noticed as the incarnation of Varcha son of Soma or moon.

**यस्तु वर्चा इति ख्यातः सोमपुत्रः प्रतापवान्।**  
**सोऽभिमन्युर्बृहत्कीर्तिरर्जुनस्य सुतोभवत्॥**

 Varcha means vigour or power. Abhi is excessive and Manyu is mental courage. Uttara means north as also to cross beyond. The combination of Abhimanyu and Uttara therefore gives the idea of the commencement of a connection of Yoga with Gnana.

 We have now passed through four big Parvas, namely the Adi, Sabha, Vana and Virata of our voluminous text, and have not been able to find a single bit of human history or of Indian geography to establish the correctness of the modern interpretations. We have also been invariably noticing at the same time that the prevailing method of interpretation, whatever might be its worth, could not continue consistently for a reasonable time, in spite of the Pandit's obstinate twistings and desperate imprecations. We

have further found, by humbly and respectfully following the clues furnished within the sacred literature, that the stories told so far, clearly and consistently refer to definite religious instructions of a highly scientific character, useful to all mankind, not only here but hereafter too. The sacred texts doubtless guide us in our path to the higher progress of human life, in itsproper sense, by exhibiting in vivid contrast the transient and hollow nature of material affairs. Whatever might be the plea of modern civilization to extol the utility of the material world, it would certainly be an irreparable blunder to deny the immensely greater value of the devotional sphere. We may surely have to rue for ever, if we thoughtlessly allow ourselves to be led away by the petty vanities of the worldly–wise man.

**THE UDYOGA–PARVA**

** 12**. *The meeting of the Sabha and the declaration* of war. The Udyoga Parva starts with the detailed descriptions of the messages that passed between the Pandavas and the Kurus regarding the claims of the former to the Kingdom. The preceptor of Drupada was first sent to Dhritarashtra in behalf of the Pandavas, and Sanjaya was sent in return. Meanwhile Dhritarashtra sought Vidura's advice and his long speech touching on moral, social and political matters generally, is well–known as Vidura–vakya. At the end of his instructions, Rishi Sanatsujata is said to have appeared and countinued in the same tone. Both of these speeches consist of fourteen chapters from 33 to 46 and they would certainly prove a profitable reading in many ways. In the meantime, the ruling chiefs friendly to the Kurus and Pandavas were invited to join each side respectively to be prepared for war. Salya the uncle of the two youngest Pandavas was won over by Duryodhana against his will. Sri–krishna was invited by both parties but refused to take arms and fight. He joined Arjuna and gave his army to Duryodhana. Duryodhana then sought the help of Beladeva elder brother of Krishna, but he declined to take any part in the war or to render any help to either party.

बलदेव उवाच।

**निगृह्योक्तो हृषीकेशस्त्वदर्थे कुरुनन्दन।**  
**मया सम्बन्धकं तुल्यमिति राजन् पुनः पुनः।**  
**नाहं सहायः पार्थस्य नापि दुर्योधनस्य वै।**

**जातोसि भारते वंशे सर्वपार्थिवपूजिते।**  
**गच्छ युध्यस्व धर्मेण क्षात्रेण पुरुषर्षभ॥**

 There are several important points to be noticed in the above passage. Duryodhana is said to have appeared before Sri–Krishna while sleeping and Arjuna went after him. The former took his seat on a throne near Sri–Krishna's head while the latter stood prostrate near his feet. All this clearly means that evil exhibits itself prominently before good.

**दुर्योधनस्तु प्रथमं वासुदेवमुपाश्रयत्।**  
**उछशीर्षतश्च कृष्णस्य निषसाद वरासने।**  
**ततः किरीटी तस्यानुप्रविवेश महामनाः।**  
**पश्चार्धे तु स कृष्णस्यप्रह्लोतिष्ठत् कृताञ्जलिः॥**

 Sri–Krishna declined to take weapons or to fight, but undertook to act the part of a charioteer to Arjuna at his request.

**उपपन्नमिदं पार्थ यत् स्पर्धसि मया सह।**  
**सारथ्यं ते करिष्यामि कामः सम्पद्यतां तव॥**

 This means that Arjuna the satwie mind prepared for yoga has to progress with the help and guidance of Sri–Krishna, the Lord of Yoga. The entire refusal of Beladeya to join either party in any manner, has to be specially marked. Beladeva represents Sesha, Ananta, Prana or life breath. The battle to be fought without him signifies that the processes of Hata yoga which deal with the mere regulation of breath have no place in the great battle to be fought at Kuru–Kshetra. As a rule Hata Yoga is treated with contempt in all the Satras generally.

**तस्मान्न हठयोगेन प्राणसंयमनात्मना।**  
**कायसिद्धिं विना किञ्चित्प्रयोजनमत्राप्नुयात्॥**

 Beladeva is said to have expressed his determination. already, on the occasion of the marriage of Uttara, Virata's daughter.

**यन्मयोक्तं विराटस्य पुरा वैवाहिके तदा॥**

 This alludes to the exclusion of the same Hata–yoga, the moment one is in touch with Uttara or gnana–marga.

 Dhritarashtra then convened a Sabha for the purpose of settling the claims of the Pandavas to the kingdom and, Duryodhana invited Sri–Kishna to attend the Sabha under instructions from his father.

**अथ दुर्योधनः कृष्णं शकुनिश्चापि सौबलः।**  
**सन्ध्यां तिष्ठन्तमभ्येत्य दाशार्हमपराजितम्।**  
**आचक्षेतान्तु कृष्णस्य धृतराष्ट्र सभागतम्।**  
**कुरूंश्च भीष्मप्रमुखान् राज्ञः सर्वाश्च पार्थिवान्।**  
**त्वामर्थयन्ते गोविन्द दिवि शक्रमिवामराः।**  
**तावभ्यनन्दत् गोविन्दः साम्रा परमवल्गुना॥**

 Sri–Krishna accordingly attended the Sabha and spoke at length in favour of peace. Taking the speech merely as a diplomatic expression of the opinions of one in Sri–Krishna's position, a reading of the whole of it as found in the text, is sure to convince every unbiased reader, of the high standard of civilization and culture attained at the time of its composition, whether it be in B. C. or A. D. Sri–Krishna is said to have spoken in the Sabha addressing Dhritarashtra in person.

**तेष्वासीनेषु सर्वेषु तूष्णीं भूतेषु राजसु।**  
**वाक्यमभ्याददे कृष्णः सुदंष्ट्रो दुन्दुभिस्वनः।**  
**जीमूत इव धर्मान्ते सर्वां संश्रावयन् सभाम्।**  
**धृतराष्ट्रमभिप्रेक्ष्य समभाषत माधवः।**  
**कुरूणां पाण्डवानाञ्च शमस्यादिति भारत।**  
**अप्रणाशेन वीराणामेतद्याचितुमागतः।**  
**न दुष्करी ह्यत्र शमो मतो मे भरतर्षभ।**  
**त्वय्यधीनः शमो राजन्मयि चैव विशाम्पते।**  
**पुत्रान् स्थापय कौरव्य स्थापयिष्याम्यहं परान्।**  
**आज्ञा तव हि राजेन्द्र कार्या पुत्रैः सहान्वयैः।**  
**हितं बलवदप्येषां तिष्ठतां तव शासने।**  
**तवचैव हितं राजन् पाण्डवानामतो हितम्।**  
**शमे प्रयतमानस्य तव शासनकांक्षिणः।**  
**धर्मार्थयोस्तिष्ठराजन् पाण्डवैरभिरक्षितः।**

**मा ते धर्मस्तथैवार्थो नश्येत् भरतर्षभ।**  
**शक्यं किमन्यद्वक्तुं ते दानादन्यज्जनेश्वर।**  
**ब्रुवन्तु ते महीपालाः सभायां ये समासते।**  
**पित्र्यं तेभ्यः प्रदायांशं पाण्डवेभ्यो यथोचितम्।**  
**ततः सपुत्रः सिद्धार्थो भुंङक्ष्व भोगान् परं तप॥**

 Sri–Krishna advocated thatthe Pandavas and Kurus should conclude peace, that Dharma and Artha should combine instead of being mutually destroyed, and that the Pandavas should be given their due portion of ancestral property.

**धर्मार्थयोस्तिष्ठ राजन् पाण्डवैरभिरक्षितः।**  
**मा ते धर्मस्तथैवार्थो नश्येत भरतर्षभ।**  
**पित्र्यं तेभ्यः प्रदायांशं पाण्डवेभ्यो यथोचितम्।**  
**ततः सपुत्रः सिद्धार्थो भुङ्क्ष्व भोगान्परन्तप॥**

 Here *Dharma* means devotion and religious abstraction, and Artha applies to worldly prosperity. The significance of the Pandavas and Kurus is thus clearly stated in these two words. Pitryom or ancestral property here denotes the subtle elements or the original Pitris, and Dhritarashtra stands for the mind given up to the rashtra, vishayas or materiality. The speech as a whole demands that greater prominence should be given to Dharma if Artha should ever be allowed to exist. Even this compromise and toleration are not preached with a full heart by Sri–Krishna, as he has already expressed his desire to bring about a war in which the Kurus should all be destroyed.

**यात्वा चाहं कुरून् सर्वान् युष्मदर्थमहापयत्।**  
**यतिष्ये प्रशमं कर्तुं लक्षयिष्ये च चेष्ठितम्।**  
**कौरवाणां प्रवृत्तिं च गत्वा युद्धाधिकारिकाम्।**  
**निशम्य विनिवर्तिष्ये जयाय तव भारत।**  
**सर्वमा युद्धमेवाहमाशंसामि परैः सह॥**

 Sage Narada narrated at great length to Duryodhana the story of Yayati and Galava illustrating the evil consequences of Egoism and obstinacy and warned him against his own conduct.

**एष दोषोभिमानेन पुरा प्राप्तो गयातिना।**  
**निर्बन्धतातिमात्रं च गालवेन महीपते।**  
**तस्मात्त्वमपि गान्धारे मातंक्रोधञ्चवर्जय।**  
**सन्धस्व पाण्डवैर्वीरसंरम्भं त्मज पार्थिव।**

 The story told contains many important matters relating to Yoga and religious devotion and the text is available for those who are sincerely interested. A close and careful reading will no doubt furnish many useful in forinations. But others who could afford to despise the whole of Puranic literature as incoherent compositions and particularly the episodes in them as unnecessary and unpoetic interpolations, are assured that no discourteous or objectionable request is made to them for wasting their valuable time by going through such meaningless stuff as they understand it. It is also feared that the Pandits could hardly discover anything particularly sensible in the above story, as they do not seem to be prepared to give us anything reasonable from the main portion of the text itself. Sri Krishna then addressed Duryodhana and advised him to make peace with the Pandavas by offering them half the kingdom.

**दुर्योधन निबोधेदं मद्वाक्यं कुरुसत्तम।**  
**शमार्थं ते विशेषेण सानुबन्धस्य भारत।**  
**महाप्रज्ञकुले जातः साध्वेतत् कर्तुमर्हसि।**  
**धर्मार्थयुक्ता लोकेस्मिन् प्रवृत्तिर्लक्ष्यते सताम्।**  
**असतां विपरीता तु लक्ष्यते भरतर्षभ।**  
**श्रेयस्ते दुर्जनात्तात पाण्डवैस्सह सङ्गतम्।**  
**तैर्हि सम्प्रीयमाणस्त्वं सर्वान् कामानवाप्स्यसि।**  
**पाण्डवैर्निर्मितां भूमिं भुजानो राजसत्तम।**

**पाण्डवान् पृष्ठतः कृत्वा त्राणमाशंससेऽन्यतः।**  
**अर्धंप्रदाय पार्थेभ्यो महतीं श्रियमाप्नुहि॥**

** **The difference between Dharma and Artha is repeatedly explained here. The Pandavas are said to have created this Bhumi which Duryodhana is enjoying and Ardhom or half of it is now asked to be given. Here Bhumi or Loka refers not to this material carth, but to the Satwic foundation laid for religious construction. This Bhumi is thus made or created by the Pandavas and is being trespassed by Duryodhana. He was therefore required to leave the Ardhom, region or position unmolested for religious advancement.

 Naturally dissatisfied with the proposal of Sri-Krishna Duryodhana made arrangements to bind him up or take himprisoner at once and then fight with the Pandavas who would thus be deprived of their chief support.

**वयमेव हृषीकेशं निगृह्णीम बलादिव।**  
**श्रुत्वा गृहीतं वार्ष्णेयं पाण्डवा हतचेतसः।**  
**निरुत्साहा भविष्यन्ति भग्नदंष्ट्रा इवोरगाः।**  
**अयं ह्येषां महाबाहुः सर्वेषां शर्म वर्म च।**  
**तस्मांद्वयमिहैवैकं केशवं क्षिप्रकारिणम्।**  
**क्रोशतो धृतराष्ट्रस्य बध्वा योत्स्यामहे रिपून्॥**

 The plot laid was somehow discovered and Sri Krishna greatly enraged at the mischief intended, exhibited his Viswa–rupa or universal form.

**एकोहमिति यन्मोहान्मन्यसे मां सुयोधन।**  
**परिभूय सुदुर्बुद्धे ग्रहीतुं मां चिकीर्षसि।**  
**इहैव पाण्डवास्सर्वे तथैवान्धकवृष्णयः।**  
**इहादित्याश्च रुद्राश्च वसवश्चमहर्षयः।**  
**एवमुक्त्वा जहासोच्चैः केशवः परवीरहा।**

**तस्य संस्मयतः शौरेविद्युद्रूपा महात्मनः।**  
**युगपच्च विनिष्येतुः साक्षात्सर्वास्तु देवताः।**  
**अंगुष्ठमात्रास्त्रिदशा बभूवुः पावकार्च्चिषः।**  
**तस्य ब्रह्मा ललाटस्थो रुद्रो वक्षसि चाभवत्।**  
**लोकपाला भुजेष्वासन्नग्निरास्वादजा।**  
**आदित्याश्चैव साध्याश्च वसवोथाश्विनावपि।**  
**मरुतश्च सहेन्द्रेण विश्वेदेवांस्तथैव च।**  
**वभूवुश्चैव यक्षाश्च गन्धर्वोरगराक्षसाः।**  
**प्रादुरास्तां तथा दोर्भ्या सङ्कर्षणधनञ्जयौ।**  
**दक्षिणेथार्जुनो धन्वी हली रामश्च सव्यतः।**  
**भीमो युधिष्टिरश्चैव माद्रीपुत्रौ च पृष्ठतः।**  
**अन्धका कृष्णयश्चैव प्रद्युम्न प्रमुखास्ततः।**  
**अग्रे बभूवुः कृष्णस्य समुद्यतमहायुधाः।**  
**सहस्रचरणः श्रीमान् शतबाहुः सहस्रदृक्।**  
**तस्य वै नागलोकश्च गुल्फाधो ददृशे तदा।**  
**चन्द्रसूर्यो तथा नेत्रे ग्रह वै सर्वतः स्थिताः।**  
**ऊर्ध्वलोकाश्च सर्वेपि कुक्षौ तस्य व्यवस्थिताः।**  
**निमेषणं रात्र्यहनी जिह्वायां शारदा तथा॥**

 The above description is clearly that of the Viratpurusha. The Lokas, gods and other paraphernalia here detailed have been noticed in the previous chapters as the glories of God exhibited in the Prakritis, tatwas or original subtle causes of creation, and not their gross material effects. The Devas are described as having appeared in the form of lightning and in the size of a thumb or angushta.

**तस्य संस्मयतः शौरोर्विद्युद्रूपा महात्मनः।**  
**युगपच्च विनिष्पेतुः साक्षात्सर्वास्तु देवताः।**  
**अंगुष्ठमात्रास्त्रिदशा बभूवुः पावकार्चिषः॥**

 The term angushta constantly appearing in the literature deserves notice. Angom means, mind and sta to

stay; thus, that which exists within the mind is angushta, and hence a subtle entity and not a gross material substance.

  Sri-Krishna says "here are the Pandavas, Andhakas, Vrishnis, Adityas, Rudras, Vasus and Maha. Rishis." There is no doubt therefore that all these represent His glories above referred to.

**इहैव पाण्डवास्सर्वे तथैवान्धक वृष्णयः।**  
**इहादित्याश्च रुद्राश्च वसवश्च महर्षयः॥**

 "Bramha was seen on the forehead of this Viswarupa, Rudra on the breast, Lokapalas in the hands, fire or Agni in the mouth, Arjuna in the right hand, Beladeva in the left, the remaining four Pandavas behind; Andhakas, Vrishnis, Pradyumna &c., in front, sun and moon in the eyes, Naga–loka under the feet, higher Lokas in the stomach, day and night in the twinkling of the eyes and Saraswati in the tongue. With all these glories the Lord appeared many–handed, many–eyed and many–footed." A little careful thought bestowed upon the above description of the Viswa–rupa will surely furnish useful informations on several important points now misunderstood in our religious literature. This exhibition of the divine form is said to have been visible only to a limited few in the assembly, namely, Drona, Bhishma, Vidura, Sanjaya, Dhritarashtra and the Rishis to whom the Lord gave divine eyes for the occasion. The blind Dhritarashtra who thus saw this divine form prayed for blindness again, with a view to avoid future sights of earthly objects, and the boon was grantel. The rest of the assembly trembled at the frightful vision as it appeared to their mortal eyes which they closed immediately.

**तं दृष्ट्वा घोरमात्मानं केशवस्य महात्मनः।**  
**न्यमीलयन्त नेत्राणि राजानस्त्रस्त चेतसः।**  
**ऋते द्रोणञ्च भीष्मञ्च विदुरञ्च महामतिम्।**

**सञ्जयं धृतराष्ट्रञ्च ऋर्षाश्चैव तपोधनान्।**  
**प्रादात्तेषां स भगवान् दिव्यं चक्षुर्जनार्दनः॥**

धृतराष्ट्र उवाच।

**त्वमेव पुण्डरीकाक्ष सर्वस्य जगतो हितः।**  
**भगवन् मम नेत्राभ्यामन्तर्धानं वृणे पुनः।**  
**भवन्तं दृष्टवानस्मि नान्यं द्रष्टुमिहोत्सहे।**  
**ततोब्रवीन्महाबाहु र्धृतराष्ट्रं जनार्दनः।**  
**अदृश्यमानेनेत्रे द्वे भवतां कुरुनन्दन॥**

 The fact of having included Dhritarashtra in the list of those blessed with divine eyes on this occasion has to be carefully marked, especially as he is known to be the father of a large number of wicked sons. His blindness alludes to the resolution to evade sights of external objects and he has been already described as Pragna–chakshu. He has prepared himself to that extent in religious devotion, but only his internal desires and passions arising from vasana or tendency of previous karmas are not leaving him. His long blindness to external vision has now qualified him to witness the Viswa–rupa and his determination to avoid the sight of external objects is now strengthened. In the scale of religious advancement, Dhritarashtra thus clearly represents a stage previous to Pandu, white or satwa which is capable of producing the Paudavas. He is therefore ingeniously described as the elder brother of Pandu and son of Vyasa. His address to Sri krishna as Pundarikaksha is particularly relevant here.

**त्वमेव पुण्डरीकाक्ष सर्वस्य जगतो हितः॥**

 Pundarikom means a lotus and akshom, eye or sight. That which has to be seen in the lotus of the heart is meant by the term Pundarikaksha, and it is very aptly used. The story of the Maha–bharata virtually beings with Dhritarashtra and

Pandu, and it is nothing but natural and reasonable to infer that those who have not yet attained even the status of Dhritarashtra, have no claims to the Mahabharata. Although Dhritarashtra is a 'holder of Vishayas', he is completely blind. The modern world consists mostly of Dhritarashtras with eyes full open. It is a shame and a disqualification to approach the Maha-bharata with the existing eyes. Dhritarashtra's blindness is far more honorable in spite of his name.

 Sri–Krishna then left the sabha taking Karna with him in his chariot. Karna was informed of his real origin as the eldest son of Kunti and Sri–Krishna promised to make him the ruler of the whole kingdom provided he would forsake Duryodhana's party. Karna declined to accept this proposal and explained his reasons for the same. He said he was forsaken by Kunti as soon as he was born of her while she was a virgin, and was brought up by Soota and his wife Radha who were childless. He afterwards became friendly with Duryodhana and 'virtually remained the ruler of the state for a period of thirteen years. The Kurus were from the very beginning omboldened to fight with Arjuna and the other Pandavas chiefly owing to his help. He has also married in the Soota's family and has his beloved children and grand children. Karna said that in these circumstances even in case he is offered the throne by Sri–Krishna and the Pandavas, he could only hand it over to Duryodhana. The lengthy reply given by Karna here, is interesting in many ways. The following extract however may be useful for obtaining additional clues to the real significance of this curious character in the text.

**ब्राह्मणाः कथयिष्यन्ति महाभारतमाहवम्।**  
**समागमेषु वार्ष्णेय क्षत्रियाणां यशोधनम्॥**

 Kunti has been in the very beginning explained as representing Sidhi or complete sanstification.

**सिद्धिधृतिश्च ये देव्यौ पञ्चानां मातरौ तु ते।**  
**कुन्ती माद्री च जज्ञाते मतिस्तु सुबलात्मजा॥**

 Karna having been born from a virgin, shows the incomplete state of religious attainment. Soota denotes Reason and Radha liberality. Karna's first relation to Soota and to his family by further connections, denotes a state of mind more national than devotional, his liberality depending chiefly on rationalism. Practically he is inclined to help the Kurus, although he knows the mistake to some extent. Karna, famous for charity is thus a utilitarian and a rationalistic moralist. He is fully aware of the future consequencesof the war and elates at the idea of obtaining Vira–swarga by loss of life in the holy battle–field of KuruKshetra.

 He says that this war which is the wealth of fame for the kshetrias will be preached by the Bramhins as the battle of the Maha–bharata in all the religious assemblies.

**ब्राह्मणाः कथयिष्यन्ति महाभारतमाहवम्।**  
**समागमेषु वार्ष्णेय क्षत्रियाणां यशोधनम्॥**

 With the interpretation we have already had on the subject, the significance of the passage can be easily grasped. The old Bramha-kshetrom is cunningly repeated here. The

form or kshetrom should be completely destroyed at the holy battle-field of Kuru-kshetrom and its destruction itself is the wealth of renown and the real import of the Mahabharata war. There is yet another curious passage here, which when carefully read would deinand an explanation. The glories of the war is said to last as long as the hills and rivers exist.

**यावत् स्थास्यन्ति गिरयः सरितश्चजनार्दन।**  
**तावत् कीर्तिभवः शब्दः शाश्वतोयं भविष्यति॥**

 The meaning as ordinarily explained is that the Mahabharata would continue to be recognised and venerated for an unlimited time. But how this could be gathered from the text has however to be examined minutely. The rivers and hills are not considered as permanent as the earth itself or as the heavenly bodies. Until very lately, it was the custom in India, in all legal transactions like sale-deeds, to state that the document executed is meant to be vailid as long as the moon and stars and other heavenly bodies continue to exist. Compared with this usual legal language, the permanency here attributed to the Mahabharata is very flimsy. We have explained in the previous chapters that hills and mountains refer to the yogic plexus pointed out for meditation, and the rivers to the nadis or currents of thought. The plain significance of the description therefore is, that the yogic practice alluded to by the fighting at Kurukshetra, or Maha–bharata war, should continue as long as the plexus and nadis exist in man. The various tendencies of the mind should be destroyed until they vanish altogether. My good readers, in understanding this important passage so nicely expressed, do not allow yourselves to be hood winked by our venerable pandits in their silly attempt to explain away this serious matter with the full consciousness of their own ignorance. You will remember that the same expression is repeated in

the very beginning of the Ramayana, Bala-kanda, with further details which would prove a bug bear to the Pandit classes in general.

 Karna was then privately visited by Kunti with the object of winning him over to the Pandavas, but he could not be induced to change party under the circumstances. However, he promised that he would not kill her sons except Arjuna and said she could hope to have five sons, including himself or Arjuna. He also stated to her his cogent reasons for refusing to comply with her request. He complained about her heartless conduct in having farsaken him as soon as he was born and for having thus denied him the benefit of religious sanctifications as a kshetria. He was bred up in the family of Soota and was closely attached to the Kurus all his life. He said that her present request was therefore only a matter of pure self-interest.

**न ते जातु नशिष्यन्ति पुत्राः पञ्च यशस्विनी।**  
**निरर्जुनाः सकर्णा वा सार्जुना वा हते मयि॥**

 The speech as a whole is capable of double meaning, We can easily gather additional useful clues to the significance of Karna from this quotation. The religious sanctifications required for a kshetria, herein mentioned, refer to the processes of yoga, and the pure self interest or kevala–atma–hita applies to the interest of the higher self. Kunti speaks for the interest of Atma and Karna is inclined to the anatma in the opposite direction. We have already noticed that Karna or ear refers to the knowledge of the Sastras, classified into karma and gnana, the Pitrihu and the Devahu, the Dekshinayana and the Uttarayana.

**पितृहू दक्षिणः कर्णः देवहू चोत्तरः स्मृतः॥**

 The Sun being the originator of the Uttarayana and the Dekshinayana, Karna is described as his son. Sometime previous to the great war, Karna wasdeprived of his ear ornaments with which he was born. Indra obtained them from him by begging in the interest of Arjuna. The ornaments alluded to are the results of the study of Sastras, and Indra here represents the Lord of Indrias. The various ideas combined in the character of Karna can now be easily put together. He had no religious sanctifications pertaining to the kshetria caste. The term Kshetria signifies defence against the attack by the senses or Indrias.क्षतात्रायते इति क्षत्रियः॥ He has secured no control over the senses by yogic practices. He was bred up by Soota and had further connections in the same family. Soota denoting ordinary reason and his mere training in that sphere, led him to join the Kurus in spite of his knowledge of the Sastras. The Kurus refer to the desire for material

prosperity कुर्वन्ति कर्माणीति कुरवः॥ Karna is described as naturally opposed to Arjuna. Arjuna represents Jivatma, a satwic state, whose existence itself, Reason, as understood by the Budhists, denies. Karna is thus a learned materialistic Budhist who deserves to be destroyed by Arjuna in the battle of Kurukshetra.

 The message of Sri-Krishna having failed in his attempt to secure peace and obtain half the kingdom for the Pandavas, war was finally declared between the Kurus and the Pandavas. The Udyoga–parva closes with the description of the arrival of the armies of both parties at Kurukshetra. Besides this main portion of the story, there are other interesting anecdotes furnishing useful informations, but they could not be conveniently or even profitably detailed within the limited scope of this essay. One of these however is the story of Amba who was born as Sikhandi and son of Drupada. Bhishma narrates at length to Duryodhana how this Sikhandi originated as an enemy of Bhishma destined to kill him. This may have to be noticed on a future occasion.

 We have now almost come near to the famous battlefield of Kurukshetra and have carefully gone through several important Parvas in the great Epic. We have all along consistently found that the stories narrated in the Puranic style so far, refer to a serious, scientific, philosophical and religious subject of utmost importance to mankind. No doubt they are treated also in such an interesting manner as to keep us awake and to induce us to think about them carefully. This is of course a matter in which the venerable authors exceedingly excelled the ordinary philosophers and religious teachers, particularly in the interest of their beloved posterity. Instead of our being doubly grateful to them for this ingenious and difficult method of treatment,

our modern attempt to bury the real subject altogether under the earth and to condemn the stories as a whole, as unsuited to the so–called civilized times, is surely a disgraceful display of unwisdom and ingratitude. The venerable authors might well rue for the day they anxiously felt and worked for, such a thankless generation.
