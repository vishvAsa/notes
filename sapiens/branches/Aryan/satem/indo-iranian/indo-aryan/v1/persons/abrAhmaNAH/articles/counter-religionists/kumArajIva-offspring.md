Perhaps the wildest thing about Kum훮raj카va's life is that the Chinese thought he was so valuable that they forced him to have sex to produce heirs (he had taken a vow of celibacy) on multiple occassions.

On the first occassion, the Later Liang dynasty ruler holding him captive made him "surrender his celibacy" after getting him drunk. Then, when he came to China, Yao Xing, of the later Qin forced him to cohabit with no less than 10 courtesans in his harem to "carry his seed".

Kum훮raj카va himself was born of the union of an Indian v2 man from Gandhara or Kashmir and a Kuchean Princess. When his father decided to become a monk, he had gone to Kuchea - where the local king was impressed by him & forced him to marry his younger sister.
