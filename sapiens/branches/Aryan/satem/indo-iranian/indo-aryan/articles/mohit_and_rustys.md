## Tube well
202104

So the person who owns a tube well near our small farm where we go food for cows, isn't allowing us water, been requesting them for 15 days.. he hopes us city folks might finally get irritated and give up the land on lease like before. Well aware that the food goes for cows in our goshala which is obviously dharmaartha only. That's how much rooted rustic dharmika, villagers occasionally are. 

(Alternative - Tubewell khudvaanaa.. par vo laakhon ka kaam ho jata hai aur 2 beegha ke lie bahut anuchit rahega.. aur bhi bhoomi hai, gehoon katenge abhi to usko bhi upayoga mein lenge, doosre ko de rakhi thi abhi, ye bhi paani de dega, fokat mein thode deta hai, abhi prayas kar raha hai)

## Ghee
Another lady kept pestering us for ghee, said she will pay to which also we declined and then she put out ruse of some disease etc.. I bought ghee from market and gave it to her just so she stops coming (our ghee is way more precious), been 4 months she is yet to show her face.

## Crop theft
Despite being well aware that the crop goes for cow fodder, every once in a while, a decent amount gets stolen.. rooted rustic dharmika pillagers.. Only today found out that about 8-10 bundles of jowar have been stolen from our land, cut from the middle so that we won't discover until late, the thief was encountered, obviously he denied.. welcome to village life.

## Price gouging
When we were new and didnâ€™t have much idea about the rates of fodder, we paid as much as 5-10x the normal rate for a good number of weeks before we figured out the scam.
