To labor one specific point: in theory, given the normal distribution, we should indeed have lots of those even assuming an Indian IQ profile of (means & weights): $.4*85+.35*90+.15*95+.1*102$. So the question boils down to do they exist but don't get into academia or they don't exist.

## Academic accomplishment
If you went to an elite college in India you will see some of those smart types with IQ in the "Nobel prize" range. But why don't you see it translate. IMO it boils down to:

1) Majority of those don't pursue academic science/mathematics. IMO Academic inclination is much lower among H high IQ classes than Jews even if their IQs are comparable in tests.
2) H intellectual classes are poorly organized, don't support/boost each other & don't exert much influence on funding bodies.
3) I do think there have been several "Nobel Prize" level H scientists (at least in Med & Phys & some Chem) kind of prizes who simply were ignored.

## Tests

I don't know about JEE these days but back in the last century family & acquaintances who were ranked in the 100 were definitely high IQ.

I don't about deshI CAT test these days. We had an exam called CSIR at the master's level & another one for aspirants for a biology/biotech stream at the bachelor's level. They were quite subject subject specific. The American old SAT & old GRE V+Q were  sort of IQ tests.
