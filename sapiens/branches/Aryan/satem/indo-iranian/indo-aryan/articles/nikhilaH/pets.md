I doubt that the Pitŕ̥-s kept any animals indoors, but they did have dogs as pets.  Even the Gods do, for example Índra's dog Sarámā or Yáma's dogs the sons of Sarámā (R̥V 10.14.10).  Dogs were given left-over bones just as they are now (AV 6.37.3).

Cats are barely attested in the Véda in general, outside of the zoölogical lists in the aşva-medhá.  MacDonell claims that they were probably domesticated given this passage (PB 8.2.2) mentioning the "sneeze" of the cat (here vr̥ṣa-daṁşá), but this seems weak evidence in my view.
