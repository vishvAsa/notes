title = "grAma-pura shift"

I should remark that a philological examination of Sanskrit tradition will show that the grAma (village/encampment) was an ideal only the remote Indo-Aryan past -- the time of the shruti. Since the 2nd urbanization the center of cultured H life has always been the city. The ways of the paura in the nagara were seen as epitome of high culture & lot of new norms are centered on the paura householder, perhaps a shift from the older gRhamedhin in more rural settings. This shift begins in the latest layer of the veda where we see the emergence of an Aryan neologism -- nagara which went on to supplant the old pUr to a degree. Thus, I think even a wanderer V1 like the great rAjashekhara might have seen the rural gRhamedhin as a bit of an anachronism.+++(4)+++
