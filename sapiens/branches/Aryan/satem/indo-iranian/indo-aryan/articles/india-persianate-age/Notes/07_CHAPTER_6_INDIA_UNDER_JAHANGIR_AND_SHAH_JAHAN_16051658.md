[^18]: After Mughal arms had reimposed imperial rule in Kamrup, a Mughal revenue agent misappropriated 700,000 rupees of government revenue.

[^57]: Rejecting the role of ‘seductive vamp’ that appears in Bollywood cinema or novels, Ellison Banks Findly notes that Nur Jahan was already middle-aged when she met Jahangir, with whom she formed a mature, political partnership. She also proposes that Nur Jahan fulfilled the emperor’s ideal of motherhood, as is suggested in his well-documented attraction to the Christian image of the Madonna and Child.

[^83]: Thomas Coryat, the eccentric Englishman who walked from Jerusalem to India in 1614–15 and for two years moved with Jahangir’s court between Ajmer, Agra and Mandu, observed that ‘The King likes not those that change their religion; hee himselfe being of none but of his owne making, and therefore suffers all religions in his kingdome.’ Foster \(ed.\), *Early Travels*, p. 280.
