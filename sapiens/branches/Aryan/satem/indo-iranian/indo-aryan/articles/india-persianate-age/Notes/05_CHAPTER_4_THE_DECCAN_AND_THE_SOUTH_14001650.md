[^1]: Writing around 1600, the historian Firishta recorded that a Deccani was once asked whom he considered the greater person, the Prophet Muhammad or the shaikh. The Deccani replied, with some surprise at the question, that although the Prophet was undoubtedly a great man, Gisudaraz was a far superior order of being.

[^8]: Such borrowing, however, was by no means universal across India. While noting that courtiers at Vijayanagara had avidly adopted the cosmopolitan Persianate dress code, Shah Rukh’s ambassador was shocked to see that upper-class men along India’s coasts went bare-chested in public, which to his Central Asian sensibility rendered them virtually naked. In 1433, a Chinese visitor noted that people in Sri Lanka and the Malabar coast walked in public bare to the waist, as did elite Muslims of the nearby Maldive islands. Wearing elite Persianate apparel – long-sleeved tunics and tall headgear – was a matter of affiliating with a known, transregional style, regardless of one’s religious identity. See ibid., pp. 859, 865–6.

[^22]: Apparently hoping to strike it rich, the founding fathers of Golconda, Illinois \(named in 1817\) and Golconda, Nevada \(fl. 1898–1910\) certainly made this association. As the first town’s website proudly declared, ‘Golconda sparkles like a diamond on the banks of the mighty Ohio River.’

[^23]: An example of the *nayakwari*s’ mobility and integration with Persianate culture is Jagadeva Rao. A member of the party of *nayakwari* chieftains who had facilitated Ibrahim Qutb Shah’s return to Golconda and accession to the throne, Rao became the prime minister of the Qutb Shahi sultanate before moving first to Berar to take up service with the Imad Shahi sultan, and from there to Vijayanagara, where he became a commander.

[^51]: The Aravidu kings were also following a path blazed by earlier migrations of Telugu-speakers southwards. From the early fifteenth century onwards, martial, mercantile and cultivating castes had been moving from the dry upland plateau of Andhra south into the Tamil country. These aggressive, mobile and land-hungry pioneers generally avoided the most densely populated areas of the south, preferring to open up uncultivated regions for growing rice, millets and dry crops that used the same sort of tank irrigation that characterizes the drier northern Deccan. Migrations extending from the mid fifteenth to the late eighteenth centuries left their mark on subsequent demographic patterns. By the late nineteenth century Telugu-speakers comprised from 15 per cent to nearly a quarter of the population in some parts of the Tamil south. Subrahmanyam, *Political Economy*, pp. 16–17.

[^59]: The king’s career had a shadowy coda. According to Jesuit testimony, Śriranga III led a miserable life in Mysore, and around 1653 Kanthirava Narasaraja, having grown tired of his troublesome guest, left the king to his fate. Early the next year the latter managed to return to Vellore, but Tirumala, *nayaka* of Madurai, was so upset upon seeing that he ‘was again raising his head’ that he encouraged the sultan of Bijapur to drive him out of that city, which ‘Adil Shahi forces did in August 1654. ‘After wandering for six years in foreign states and alienating the neighbouring princes,’ recorded a contemporary missionary, the ‘poor’ king ‘withdrew into the last corner of his dominions still left to him’. That was Bednur, in the western plateau, where the *nayaka* of Ikkeri sheltered the powerless emperor, evidently hoping to use the latter’s nominal imperial status to help prosecute his own wars against his enemy to the south, the ruler of Mysore, one of Śriranga III’s former hosts. The last inscriptions issued in the name of Śriranga III are dated 1660, 1661 and finally 1669, just over a century after the Battle of Talikota. See Sauliere, ‘Revolt’, part 2, pp. 164–5, 169; K. D.

[^61]: This was based on a type of land tenure geared towards furnishing the ruler with troops recruited and maintained by an *amaranayaka*, or the noble granted such a land holding. The term *amara* is derived from the Arabic–Persian *amr*, in the sense of ‘command’. *Amr* is also the root of *amir*, or commander. See Wagoner, *Tidings*, pp. 198–200.

[^65]: In the mid fifteenth century Calicut collected a 2.7 per cent charge on the sale of all goods leaving its port. This rate was doubtless kept low by the availability of pepper at rival ports along the coast, rendering all of Malabar a buyer’s market. Stephen F.

[^68]: Malabar’s only seaport blessed with a natural harbour is Cochin, down the coast from Calicut. Ibn Battuta’s views on Calicut must be taken seriously. Unlike Marco Polo, he was not prone to exaggeration, and, having already visited ports throughout the Mediterranean, the Indian Ocean, and the South China Sea, he certainly had some basis for evaluating Calicut’s relative size.
