[^6]: Munis Faruqui argues that he abandoned Delhi more from a position of weakness than from one of strength. Having been used by ‘Alamgir as a political counterweight to the emperor’s own sons, Nizam al-Mulk had never been assimilated into any of those sons’ households. As a result, he refused to take part in the war of succession following ‘Alamgir’s death in 1707. This, in turn, froze him out of the inner circle of that war’s victor, Bahadur Shah. And by sitting out of the succession wars that followed the reigns of both Bahadur Shah and Jahandar, Nizam al-Mulk remained politically marginalized at the end of Farrukh Siyar’s reign \(1713–19\) and beyond. See Munis D. Faruqui, ‘At Empire’s End: The Nizam, Hyderabad and Eighteenth-Century India’, *Modern Asian Studies* 43, no. 1 \(2009\), pp. 13–18.

[^12]: Unlike in Awadh, though, the larger size of *jagir*s in the Punjab gave more power to its *jagirdar*s, which imposed limits on the governor’s authority within the province.

[^14]: To high-born members of the Mughal nobility who commanded professional archers, lancers or swordsmen mounted on heavy steeds, the peasant-soldiers they encountered in the Deccan appeared as little more than rabble. In 1740 one Mughal aristocrat described his Maratha adversaries as ‘unendowed with the excellence of noble or illustrious birth’. Yet he conceded that ‘as they undergo all sorts of toil and fatigue in prosecuting a guerrilla warfare, they prove superior to the easy and effeminate troops of Hind \[north India\], who for the most part are of more honourable birth and calling’.

Put another way, the meaning of Maratha was expanding to include all those participating in the Maratha state’s northern campaigns, in the same way that, several centuries earlier, villagers of eastern India’s military labour market became Rajputs by virtue of their recruitment by Rajput middlemen for service in extended campaigns far from their homes.

[^21]: ‘Taxes were called by Mughal terms,’ writes Gordon, ‘assessed in a Mughal manner, paid in the customary Muslim months. The Marathas even retained the Mughal differential transit duties, which charged Hindu traders double their Muslim counterparts. Maratha demands never exceeded the pre-existing Mughal settlement … When the Marathas established the basic apparatus of law and order – courts, rural and urban police – both the terminology and function resembled their Mughal counterparts.’ Ibid., pp. 143–4.

[^27]: Revealing the gathering concern with community identity and social boundaries typical of the later eighteenth century, a text dating to that period contends that the rajas’ appeal for Mughal intervention was made on the grounds that the Sikhs’ creation of the Khalsa, by liquidating the fourfold Hindu class system, had represented a threat to social order. In other words, ‘Alamgir was asked to intervene in order to preserve the Hindu social hierarchy.

[^37]: Before Nadir Shah left India with his caravans of Mughal loot, the governor of Punjab ceded part of the western Punjab to the Iranian warlord, and upon his death in 1745 his sons fought over the remainder as though it were a family heirloom.

[^40]: Since the cultivation of wet rice, a labour-intensive crop, was the region’s major income-producing activity, Mughal land revenue statistics reflect changes in the relative population density of different sectors within the delta. Between 1595 and 1659 the revenue demand for the north-eastern and south-eastern parts of the delta increased by 97 per cent and 117 per cent respectively, whereas that for north-western Bengal, the most moribund part of the delta, actually declined by 13 per cent.

[^48]: Writing in 1595, at the dawn of the Mughal age in Bengal, Abu’l-fazl ‘Allami, the foremost spokesman for Mughal imperial ideology, wrote that the indigenous peoples of the eastern delta were of dark skin, had little or no beard, and practised a religion ‘said to be different to that of the Hindus and Muhammadans’. Abu’l-fazl, trans. H. S. Jarrett, ed. Jadunath Sarkar, *A’in-i Akbari* \(1949; 2nd edn, repr. New Delhi: Oriental Books Reprint Corp., 1978, 3 vols\), vol. 2, p. 132.

[^49]: As was noted by Father Martin SJ, who toured the Hooghly region of west Bengal in 1699, ‘nearly the whole country is given to idolatry’. H. Hosten, ‘The Earliest Recorded Episcopal Visitation of Bengal, 1712–1715’, *Bengal Past and Present* 6 \(July–Dec. 1910\), p. 217.

[^50]: In Mukundaram’s *Candi Mangala*, Muslims directing forest-clearing operations are said to have come from the west, in contrast to the aboriginals who came from within the delta. A group of 2,000 Muslim labourers chanting the name of a Muslim holy man were led by one Zafar Mian, evidently the organizer of a workforce dedicated to forest-clearing operations. Mukundaram’s poem can thus be read as a grand epic dramatizing the process of civilization-building in the Bengal delta and, specifically, the eastward movement of the delta’s ecological frontier, as agrarian civilization pushed into formerly forested lands.

[^59]: The figures come from the eccentric Englishman Thomas Coryat, who walked from Jerusalem to India in 1614–15. Along the way he recorded revenue figures he acquired from authorities in Istanbul, Isfahan and Jahangir’s court. Foster \(ed.\), *Early Travels*, p. 246. While most imported silver stayed in India \(as appeared to be the case to Hawkins\), between 1581 and 1590 nearly three million silver coins flowed from India to Iran and Central Asia, mainly for purchasing war-horses.

The high volume of silver imports also had political consequences, since it enabled the Mughals to elaborate a hierarchy of imperial *mansabdar*s whose ranks were based on cash salaries. Monetizing political status in this way had the effect of eroding traditional loyalties that had been based on ethnic, kinship or religious solidarities. Cash salaries had become the new standard of status.

[^74]: In Gujarat’s coastal entrepôt of Surat, where Mughal authority had already been usurped by Marathas, the Company had to share control of the port with Maratha chiefs. It was only after the annexation of the city in 1800 that the Company was able to remove intermediaries between its own agents and weaving communities, prevent non-Company buyers from engaging in trade, or using armed soldiers to enforce its measures.

[^75]: There was actually a bit of charades being played here. In order to prevent the British king from getting his hands on Bengal’s revenues, the House of Commons preferred that they be kept with the Company, which in turn pretended to be passing those revenues on to an Indian king who everybody knew would never see them.
