[^9]: The *Qasideh dar Lughat-i Hindi*, written at this time, gave Persian equivalents for Hindavi terms, indicating that it presupposed an audience familiar with Persian, but not with Hindavi. Walter Hakala, ‘On Equal Terms: The Equivocal Origins of an Early Mughal Indo-Persian Vocabulary’, *Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society* 25, no. 2 \(April 2015\), p. 226.

[^11]: In modern Persian, in fact, *farhang* denotes ‘civilization’ as well as ‘dictionary’.

[^13]: Ibid., p. 462. This helps explain the appearance of Hindus as authors of Persian treatises in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Whereas only six works of Persian literature are known to have been authored by Hindus in seventeenth-century India, in the eighteenth century that figure rose to at least forty-nine, authored by thirty-two different writers.

[^17]: Even something as mundane as the fruits prepared for Shah Jahan’s breakfast suggest the court’s imagined participation in a wider, conceptually unified field: melons from Balkh, plums from Kashghar and Ghur, pears from Samarqand, pomegranates from Yazd and Thatta, fruits from Hindustan, mangoes from Gujarat and the Deccan, watermelons from Kashmir. Kinra, *Writing Self*, p. 109.

[^19]: His list included the collected letters of Jami \(d. 1492\), *Gulistan* and *Bustan* of Sa'di, *Akhlaq-i Nasiri* of Nasir al-Din Tusi, *Akhlaq-i Jalali* of Jalal al-Din Dawani \(d. 1502\), *Akhlaq-i Muhsini* of Husain Wa'iz Kashifi \(d. 1504\), *Habib al-Siyar* of Muhammad Khwandamir \(d. 1534\), *Rauzat al-Safa’* of Mir Khwand \(d. 1498\), *Rauzat al-Salatin* of Muhammad Fakhri Haravi \(fl. 1487\), *Tarikh-i Guzida* of Hamd Allah Qazvini \(d. 1349\), and *Zafar-Nama* of Sharf al-Din ‘Ali Yazdi \(d. 1454\). See Kinra, *Writing Self*, p. 61.

[^20]: Nearly everyone in India who knew Persian was familiar with Jami’s works, which were usually included in the standard *madrasa* curriculum. Muzafar Alam, ‘Scholar, Saint, and Poet: Jami in the Indo-Muslim World’, in Thibaut d’Hubert and Alexandre Papas \(eds\), *Jami in Regional Contexts: The Reception of* ‘*Abd al-Rahman Jami’s Works in the Islamicate World, c.9th/15th–14th/20th Century* \(Leiden: Brill, 2018\), p. 98.

[^21]: Works from that canon served as reference points in their daily thought. The earliest surviving manuscript of one of the most popular works in the canon of Hindavi literature, Jayasi’s *Padmavat* \(composed in 1540\), was copied in 1674 by a scribe named Muhammad Shakir. As he was making his copy, certain episodes from Jayasi’s Hindavi poem sparked his memory of fragments of the poetry of Hafiz, which he then scribbled in the margins of the manuscript.

[^23]: A similar instance would be the attempts of the Académie française \(whose motto is ‘To immortality’\) to purge French of English and other foreign words.

[^24]: The last phrase suggests how the founder of Sikhism saw himself in relation to the tradition he founded. He used neither *peyghambar* nor *rasul*, the respective Persian and Arabic terms for ‘messenger’, far less the Sanskrit *avatar* \(incarnation of a deity\) or *parameśvar* \(lord\). Rather, *tabl-i baz* denotes the drum beaten by hunters that would rouse aquatic birds to be captured by a falcon. Grewal plausibly renders it as ‘herald’. J. S. Grewal, *The Sikhs: Ideology, Institutions, and Identity* \(New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 2009\), p. 14.

[^55]: The historian Nizam al-Din Ahmad \(d. 1594\), author of *Tabaqat-i Akbari*, treats fate and its agents – usually Sufi dervishes – nearly contemptuously, since in his view humans possess power over their actions and destiny.

[^57]: Nearly a century after ‘Alamgir’s death and half a world away, Britain’s American colonies, having successfully rebelled against King George III, debated what to call their new head of state. Instead of reigning over the United States as an absolute monarch, George Washington, it was eventually decided, would merely uphold the laws enacted by the government at which he presided, and therefore be called ‘president’.
