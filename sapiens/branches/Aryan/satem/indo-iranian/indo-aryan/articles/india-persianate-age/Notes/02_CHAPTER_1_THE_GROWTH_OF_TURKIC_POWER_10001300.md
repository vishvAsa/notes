[^8]: David Shulman describes Kautilya, the author of the famous second-century manual of Indian statecraft, the *Arthashastra*, as a ‘hyper-Machievellian theorist’ who ‘inhabits a dog-eat-dog kingdom \(‘fish eat fish’ is the usual Indian metaphor\) in which no one is above suspicion and everyone is vulnerable to sudden assassination by the vast, shadowy army of secret agents and informers that keeps the state going; ruthless utility in such cases overrides all possible ethical scruples. A principle of unabashed craftiness driven by self-interest applies to all levels of political life; truthfulness is seen, in general, as a mostly irrelevant virtue \(or even a fault\)’ David Shulman, ‘Off with their Heads’, *New York Review of Books* 65, no. 6 \(5 April, 2018\), p. 31.

[^13]: Referring to the imperial Cholas, Upinder Singh writes, ‘There is an inverse correlation between the power of kings and the inscriptional references to chieftains. In the early 11th century, at the midpoint of Rajaraja Chola’s reign, an increase in centralization led to a corresponding decline in inscriptional references to chiefs. In the late 11th century, especially after the reign of Kulottunga I \(1070–1122\), there was a rise in the number of such references, indicating an increase in their power as the Chola monarchy declined.’ Upinder Singh, *A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India: From the Stone Age to the 12th Century* \(Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, 2008\), p. 562.

The same pattern continued after the Turkish conquest of India. In the 1460s, Kapilendra, the founder of the Suryavamshi Gajapati dynasty in Orissa, sacked both Śaiva and Vaishnava temples in the Kaveri delta in the course of wars of conquest in the Tamil country. See Phillip B. Wagoner, *Tidings of the King: A Translation and Ethnohistorical Analysis of the* Rayavacakamu \(Honolulu: University of Hawaii, 1993\), p. 146. Somewhat later, in 1514, Krishna Raya looted an image of Bala Krishna from Udayagiri, which he had defeated and annexed to his growing Vijayanagara state. See Davis, *Lives*, pp. 65, 67.

[^20]: India was not the only object of Mahmud’s plundering raids, however. When he captured Ray, near modern Teheran, his army carried off 260,000 dinars of coined money, 30,000 dinars’ worth of gold and silver vessels and half a million dinars’ worth of jewels. C. E.

[^22]: ‘In modern parlance,’ writes Ilker Evrim Binbaṣ, ‘an informal intellectual network is based on personal contact, communication, or correspondence between the participants. The members of an informal network often share similar philosophical, political, ideological, religious, and aesthetic sensibilities. The exchange of letters or pamphlets, the commitment to a methodological principle or to the bonds of friendship and family ties, the occasional attention of a particular patron, as well as not infrequent actual encounters among members kept such networks together and functioning … Such cases of informal networks … are defined mainly by peer-to-peer relationships, hence displaying little or no hierarchical stratification. They were interregional and not territorially bound, a feature that made their participants true cosmopolitans.’ Ilker Evrim Binbaṣ, *Intellectual Networks in Timurid Iran: Sharaf al-Din ‘Ali Yazdi and the Islamicate Republic of Letters* \(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2016\), pp. 8–9.

A cache of coins found in and near a cave in Pakistan’s Mardan District points to the dynasty’s desire to integrate Hindu temples into its fiscal and commercial networks. These small copper coins, which were derived from earlier, Hindu Shahi prototypes but also bore Arabic legends referring to Ghaznavid sultans, were locally minted for the evident purpose of enabling pilgrims to make offerings to a temple complex dedicated to the goddess Bhima Devi. Taxes levied on this complex, which was located near a major trade route, would have provided a steady source of revenue for the Ghazanavid state. See Waleed Ziad, ‘“Islamic Coins” from a Hindu Temple’, *Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient* 59 \(2016\), pp. 618–59.

[^30]: Mahmud of Ghazni was the first ruler actually to style himself ‘sultan’, which he did from 1002 onwards. Although his royal predecessors in Central Asia and the Middle East had been titled ‘*amir*’ or ‘*malik*’, the ideology of the sultan had already been formulated by those predecessors, especially the Samanid *amir*s of Bukhara.

[^36]: Owing to the significance of the Chauhan dynasty’s defeat at the hands of Muhammad Ghuri, the life of Prithviraj has been the subject of many different tellings over the centuries.

[^39]: The earliest historian to identify the sultan in such terms was Minhaj al-Din Juzjani, but he was not writing until 1260, six decades after the conquest. More importantly, he was writing in the immediate aftermath of the Mongol holocaust, which had driven countless traumatized refugees like himself out of Central Asia to the security of India. For him, India was construed as a ‘Muslim territory’, made so by the religio-military exertions of Muhammad Ghuri, who was thus retroactively construed as a *ghazi.* Michael O’Neal, ‘The Ghurid Empire: Warfare, Kingship, and Political Legitimacy in Eastern Iran and Northern India’ \(PhD dissertation, Tel Aviv University, 2013\), p. 215.

There is no evidence that the Ghurids carried off religious images as war trophies, as Mahmud of Ghazni had done at Somnath, or as Indian rajas often did after defeating their Indian rivals.

[^46]: Similarly, whereas the dynasty’s monuments in Afghanistan and the Indus valley conformed to the architectural conventions of that region \(baked brick, blue glazes, stucco\), those they patronized in north India followed the region’s building traditions – carved stone, post-and-beam construction rather than arches and domes, embellishments of carved ornamentation, vegetal motifs, etc. This was due, in part, to the employment of Indian stonemasons on the worksites of sultanate monuments. Architects commissioned by Muhammad Ghuri, his slave commanders and their successors also deployed in their monuments newly carved stone columns that emulated those that were reused from Hindu or Jain structures. This suggests that these rulers consciously adapted themselves to north India’s aesthetic environment. Ibid., pp. 137, 164, 180.

[^47]: Unlike his contemporaries in Delhi, Lahore or Multan, Bakhtiyar Khalaji had not been one of Muhammad Ghuri’s slaves. In fact, the conqueror of Bengal was not even one of the Ghurids’ leading commanders. Hailing from a humble, pastoral background in southern Afghanistan, Bakhtiyar Khalaji actually failed to pass muster by the sultan’s recruiters both in Ghazni and in Delhi. Yet in the early thirteenth century the political situation in the Gangetic plain was so unstable, the demand for armed personnel so great, and Bengal so remote from the centre of Ghurid operations in upper India, that someone of even middling abilities or of relatively low standing in the Ghurids’ social world could make a mark for himself. When news of Bakhtiyar Khalaji’s successes in eastern India reached his Afghan homelands, Khalaji kinsmen joined him and provided him with yet more resources. Finally, in 1204 he surprised and defeated the most prominent ruler in the Bengal delta, Lakshmana Sena, handing the Ghurid leadership yet another conquest in the Indian theatre. Kumar, *Emergence*, pp. 71–3.

[^48]: One of these chroniclers was ‘Ali Kufi, who completed his regional history of Sind, the *Chachnama*, in 1226. This Persian chronicle has been read as an attempt to legitimize Turkish authority in India generally, and specifically Qubacha’s independent sultanate based on Uch, which lasted until his death in 1228. See Manan Ahmed Asif, *A Book of Conquest: The* Chachnama *and Muslim Origins in South Asia* \(Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2016\).

[^49]: Actually, his rise to power echoed that of the slave Sabuktigin, founder of the Ghaznavid sultanate, who married the daughter of his former master, Alptigin – a precedent that Iltutmish’s contemporaries would have remembered. Such matrimonial measures lent both Sabuktigin and Iltutmish at least a semblance of dynastic continuity between their former masters and themselves.

Notwithstanding these arguments made to Yildiz, Iltutmish himself would strenuously endeavour to start a dynasty by leaving the throne of Delhi to his own progeny.

For example, deep in central Punjab and far from the court in Delhi, a government official tried to prohibit the use of music and dance at the lodge of Shaikh Farid al-Din, but failed owing to the Sufi’s immense influence among the local population.

[^61]: Amir Hasan Sijzi, who resided in Delhi between 1308 and 1322, wrote: ‘The son of Khwaja Rukn al-din, the venerable Chishti saint … was taken captive during the onslaught of the infidel Mongols … During the Mongol onslaught, the infidels of Chinghiz Khan turned toward India. At that time, Qutb al-din counseled his friends, “Flee, for these people will overpower you”. When the Mongols reached Nishapur, its ruler summoned Shaykh Farid ad-din ‘Attar … and asked the Shaykh to petition God … It was then that I heard the report from Ghazna: the Mongols had reached that city and martyred my mother, father, and all of my close relations … As the Lahore traders were making their way home, they were informed *en route* that the Mongols had invaded their city and reduced it to rubble.’ Bruce B. Lawrence \(trans.\), *Morals for the Heart: Conversations of Shaykh Nizam ad-din Awliya, recorded by Amir Hasan Sijzi* \(New York: Paulist Press, 1992\), pp. 99, 101, 142, 165, 216.

[^62]: The decline had already set in by the middle of the first millennium across India. Although some Buddhist pilgrimage centres persisted in the south and west until as late as the fifteenth century, by the year 1000 monastic Buddhism had been eclipsed and replaced by Hindu and Jain institutions. In the north-west, too, most Buddhist monasteries and pilgrimage sites had been abandoned by that time. Lars Fogelin, *An Archaeological History of Indian Buddhism* \(New York: Oxford University Press, 2015\), pp. 218–19.

[^63]: Around AD 400 the pilgrim Faxian counted twenty-two monasteries in Tamralipti, a seaport on the Bay of Bengal. By around 637, Xuanzang counted ten monasteries there. By 685, that figure had dropped to just five or six, as recorded by a third Chinese pilgrim, Yijing. Samuel Beal \(trans.\), *Chinese Accounts of India: Translated from the Chinese of Hiuen Tsiang* \(Calcutta: Susil Gupta, 1958, 4 vols\), vol. 4, pp. 403, 407, 408; J.

[^64]: See Wink, *al-Hind*, vol. 2, pp. 146–8, 334–51. By the eleventh and twelfth centuries, these kings gradually withdrew their patronage from these institutions, favouring Hindu temples instead. During those centuries, most of the art patronized by kings of the Pala dynasty was Brahmanic in subject matter, with Vaishnava themes outnumbering the rest three to one. Susan L. Huntington, *The ‘Pala-Sena’ Schools of Sculpture* \(Leiden: Brill, 1984\), pp. 155, 179, 201.

[^65]: Those that escaped attack – such as Somapura in Bengal, or Lalitagiri, Udayagiri and Ratnagiri in Orissa – were soon abandoned by their resident monks owing to disruptions in the flow of land revenues on which they had grown dependent. Fogelin, *Archaeological History*, p. 222. For a provocative analysis of the issue, which argues that Brahmanical classes took advantage of the Turkish conquest in order finally to defeat their ancient Buddhist rivals, see Giovanni Verardi, *Hardships and Downfall of Buddhism in India* \(New Delhi: Manohar, 2011\).

[^71]: Bahram Shah also patronized the translation of a widely popular collection of animal fables, illustrating an early, fruitful encounter between the Sanskrit and Persian worlds. Composed originally in Sanskrit, the *Panchatantra* had been translated into Middle Persian in the sixth century, then in the eighth century from Middle Persian into Arabic as *Kalila va Dimna*, and around 1145 from Arabic into modern Persian as the *Fables of Bidpai*. Since this occurred just as the Ghaznavid court was about to shift to Lahore, the *Panchatantra* effectively returned to India, though in a Persian guise. See Bosworth, *Later Ghaznavids*, p. 109. Browne adds: ‘Few books in the world have achieved so great a success as that of *Kalila and Dimna*, or have been translated into so many languages.’ Apart from Arabic and both Middle and Modern Persian, these include Greek, Hebrew, Latin, Spanish, Italian, Slavonic, Turkish, German, English, Danish, Dutch and French. Browne, *Literary History*, vol. 2, p. 350.

[^72]: The fifteenth-century biographer of Persian poets Daulatshah Samarqandi relates that Mahmud was regularly attended by 400 poets, presided over by the poet laureate. Bosworth, *Ghaznavids*, p. 131.

[^73]: By the mid thirteenth century works in that canon included, in addition to those just mentioned that were produced under Ghaznavid patronage, the advice literature of Kai Ka’us \(d. 1087\), Nizam al-Mulk \(d. 1092\), and Nizami Aruzi al-Samarqandi \(d. 1161\), the panygeric poetry of Anvari \(d. 1189\), the romance literature of Nizami Ganjavi \(d. 1209\) and the mystical poetry of ‘Attar \(d. 1221\). During Balban’s reign there appeared, among other such works, the ethical literature of Nasir al-Din Tusi and the moral poetry of Sa‘di \(d. 1291\). Although the canon of Persian literature continued to grow, for centuries the works of these important literati continued to be copied in libraries, taught in *madrasa*s and in some cases committed to memory.
