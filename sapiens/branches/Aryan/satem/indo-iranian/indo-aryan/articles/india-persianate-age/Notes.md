For contemporaries it was not religion that ordered the world, but a heightened awareness of insider vs outsider. Such a perspective demonized foreigners in much the same way that ancient Greeks had demonized non-Greek-speakers, in the process inventing, for Europeans, the notion of the barbarian Other.

[^10]: The same pattern extends to archaeology, a discipline bedevilled by the assumption that a given artefact indicates a particular religious identity, and that the use of such an artefact, once identified as ‘Hindu’ or ‘Muslim’, was confined to a particular historical period, such as ‘Rajput’ or ‘Sultanate’.

[^13]: ‘Persianate’ is an adjectival construction analogous to Germanic, Latinate, Italianate, Hellenic, Indic, Hispanic, etc., all of which refer to the wide range of culture derived from, or based on, a particular language or literary tradition. Its acceptance in academic and publishing circles is seen in the many book, series and journal titles that have appeared since around 2010, and which foreground the term.

[^14]: See Owen Cornwall, ‘Alexander and the Persian Cosmopolis, 1000–1500’ \(PhD dissertation, Cambridge University, 2016\). ‘Whereas the medieval European Alexander romance traditions were about faraway places,’ notes Cornwall, ‘the Persian Alexander epics were about home and the process of making home into the world. Many of the cities Alexander founded were in the Persian cosmopolis. Alexander’s journeys, therefore, had immediate referents and political consequences. For medieval European readers, Alexander’s encounters with Brahmins in India would have seemed impossibly far away. In medieval India, on the other hand, Muslim rulers encountered Brahmins every day.’ Ibid., p. 12.

[^21]: The notion of justice found no exact counterpart in Sanskrit. The term for ‘justice’ used by Baddena is *nyaayam*, a Sanskrit term usually used in the sense of ‘logic’, ‘reason’ or ‘principle’. It can carry the sense of ‘justice’ in *dharma-śastra* literature when court cases and lawsuits are discussed. But these seem to be secondary, more specialized meanings. Until Baddena, the term was never elevated to the status of *the* fundamental principle of statecraft.

[^8]: David Shulman describes Kautilya, the author of the famous second-century manual of Indian statecraft, the *Arthashastra*, as a ‘hyper-Machievellian theorist’ who ‘inhabits a dog-eat-dog kingdom \(‘fish eat fish’ is the usual Indian metaphor\) in which no one is above suspicion and everyone is vulnerable to sudden assassination by the vast, shadowy army of secret agents and informers that keeps the state going; ruthless utility in such cases overrides all possible ethical scruples. A principle of unabashed craftiness driven by self-interest applies to all levels of political life; truthfulness is seen, in general, as a mostly irrelevant virtue \(or even a fault\)’ David Shulman, ‘Off with their Heads’, *New York Review of Books* 65, no. 6 \(5 April, 2018\), p. 31.

[^13]: Referring to the imperial Cholas, Upinder Singh writes, ‘There is an inverse correlation between the power of kings and the inscriptional references to chieftains. In the early 11th century, at the midpoint of Rajaraja Chola’s reign, an increase in centralization led to a corresponding decline in inscriptional references to chiefs. In the late 11th century, especially after the reign of Kulottunga I \(1070–1122\), there was a rise in the number of such references, indicating an increase in their power as the Chola monarchy declined.’ Upinder Singh, *A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India: From the Stone Age to the 12th Century* \(Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, 2008\), p. 562.

Desai and Darlielle Mason \(eds\), *Gods, Guardians, and Lovers: Temple Sculptures from North India, 700–1200* \(New York: Asia Society Galleries, 1993\), p. 59. The same pattern continued after the Turkish conquest of India. In the 1460s, Kapilendra, the founder of the Suryavamshi Gajapati dynasty in Orissa, sacked both Śaiva and Vaishnava temples in the Kaveri delta in the course of wars of conquest in the Tamil country. See Phillip B. Wagoner, *Tidings of the King: A Translation and Ethnohistorical Analysis of the* Rayavacakamu \(Honolulu: University of Hawaii, 1993\), p. 146. Somewhat later, in 1514, Krishna Raya looted an image of Bala Krishna from Udayagiri, which he had defeated and annexed to his growing Vijayanagara state. See Davis, *Lives*, pp. 65, 67.

[^20]: India was not the only object of Mahmud’s plundering raids, however. When he captured Ray, near modern Teheran, his army carried off 260,000 dinars of coined money, 30,000 dinars’ worth of gold and silver vessels and half a million dinars’ worth of jewels. C. E.

[^22]: ‘In modern parlance,’ writes Ilker Evrim Binbaṣ, ‘an informal intellectual network is based on personal contact, communication, or correspondence between the participants. The members of an informal network often share similar philosophical, political, ideological, religious, and aesthetic sensibilities. The exchange of letters or pamphlets, the commitment to a methodological principle or to the bonds of friendship and family ties, the occasional attention of a particular patron, as well as not infrequent actual encounters among members kept such networks together and functioning … Such cases of informal networks … are defined mainly by peer-to-peer relationships, hence displaying little or no hierarchical stratification. They were interregional and not territorially bound, a feature that made their participants true cosmopolitans.’ Ilker Evrim Binbaṣ, *Intellectual Networks in Timurid Iran: Sharaf al-Din ‘Ali Yazdi and the Islamicate Republic of Letters* \(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2016\), pp. 8–9.

[^28]: Bosworth, *Later Ghaznavids*, pp. 57–8. A cache of coins found in and near a cave in Pakistan’s Mardan District points to the dynasty’s desire to integrate Hindu temples into its fiscal and commercial networks. These small copper coins, which were derived from earlier, Hindu Shahi prototypes but also bore Arabic legends referring to Ghaznavid sultans, were locally minted for the evident purpose of enabling pilgrims to make offerings to a temple complex dedicated to the goddess Bhima Devi. Taxes levied on this complex, which was located near a major trade route, would have provided a steady source of revenue for the Ghazanavid state. See Waleed Ziad, ‘“Islamic Coins” from a Hindu Temple’, *Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient* 59 \(2016\), pp. 618–59.

[^29]: As the renowned political theorist Nizam al-Mulk \(d. 1092\) succinctly put it, ‘One obedient slave is better than three hundred sons; for the latter desire their father’s death, the former his master’s glory.’ Nizam al-Mulk, *The Book of Government, or Rules for Kings: The* Siyar al-muluk, *or* Siyasat-nama *of Nizam al-Mulk*, trans.

[^30]: Mahmud of Ghazni was the first ruler actually to style himself ‘sultan’, which he did from 1002 onwards. Although his royal predecessors in Central Asia and the Middle East had been titled ‘*amir*’ or ‘*malik*’, the ideology of the sultan had already been formulated by those predecessors, especially the Samanid *amir*s of Bukhara.

[^36]: Owing to the significance of the Chauhan dynasty’s defeat at the hands of Muhammad Ghuri, the life of Prithviraj has been the subject of many different tellings over the centuries. For a study of these different constructions of his life, and what they tell us about South Asian history, see Cynthia Talbot, *The Last Hindu Emperor: Prithviraj Chauhan and the Indian Past, 1200–2000* \(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2016\).

[^39]: The earliest historian to identify the sultan in such terms was Minhaj al-Din Juzjani, but he was not writing until 1260, six decades after the conquest. More importantly, he was writing in the immediate aftermath of the Mongol holocaust, which had driven countless traumatized refugees like himself out of Central Asia to the security of India. For him, India was construed as a ‘Muslim territory’, made so by the religio-military exertions of Muhammad Ghuri, who was thus retroactively construed as a *ghazi.* Michael O’Neal, ‘The Ghurid Empire: Warfare, Kingship, and Political Legitimacy in Eastern Iran and Northern India’ \(PhD dissertation, Tel Aviv University, 2013\), p. 215.

Readings on History and Temple Desecration in Medieval India* \(New Delhi: Three Essays, 2008\), pp. 93–139. There is no evidence that the Ghurids carried off religious images as war trophies, as Mahmud of Ghazni had done at Somnath, or as Indian rajas often did after defeating their Indian rivals.

[^46]: Similarly, whereas the dynasty’s monuments in Afghanistan and the Indus valley conformed to the architectural conventions of that region \(baked brick, blue glazes, stucco\), those they patronized in north India followed the region’s building traditions – carved stone, post-and-beam construction rather than arches and domes, embellishments of carved ornamentation, vegetal motifs, etc. This was due, in part, to the employment of Indian stonemasons on the worksites of sultanate monuments. Architects commissioned by Muhammad Ghuri, his slave commanders and their successors also deployed in their monuments newly carved stone columns that emulated those that were reused from Hindu or Jain structures. This suggests that these rulers consciously adapted themselves to north India’s aesthetic environment. Ibid., pp. 137, 164, 180.

[^47]: Unlike his contemporaries in Delhi, Lahore or Multan, Bakhtiyar Khalaji had not been one of Muhammad Ghuri’s slaves. In fact, the conqueror of Bengal was not even one of the Ghurids’ leading commanders. Hailing from a humble, pastoral background in southern Afghanistan, Bakhtiyar Khalaji actually failed to pass muster by the sultan’s recruiters both in Ghazni and in Delhi. Yet in the early thirteenth century the political situation in the Gangetic plain was so unstable, the demand for armed personnel so great, and Bengal so remote from the centre of Ghurid operations in upper India, that someone of even middling abilities or of relatively low standing in the Ghurids’ social world could make a mark for himself. When news of Bakhtiyar Khalaji’s successes in eastern India reached his Afghan homelands, Khalaji kinsmen joined him and provided him with yet more resources. Finally, in 1204 he surprised and defeated the most prominent ruler in the Bengal delta, Lakshmana Sena, handing the Ghurid leadership yet another conquest in the Indian theatre. Kumar, *Emergence*, pp. 71–3.

[^48]: One of these chroniclers was ‘Ali Kufi, who completed his regional history of Sind, the *Chachnama*, in 1226. This Persian chronicle has been read as an attempt to legitimize Turkish authority in India generally, and specifically Qubacha’s independent sultanate based on Uch, which lasted until his death in 1228. See Manan Ahmed Asif, *A Book of Conquest: The* Chachnama *and Muslim Origins in South Asia* \(Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2016\).

[^49]: Actually, his rise to power echoed that of the slave Sabuktigin, founder of the Ghaznavid sultanate, who married the daughter of his former master, Alptigin – a precedent that Iltutmish’s contemporaries would have remembered. Such matrimonial measures lent both Sabuktigin and Iltutmish at least a semblance of dynastic continuity between their former masters and themselves.

Notwithstanding these arguments made to Yildiz, Iltutmish himself would strenuously endeavour to start a dynasty by leaving the throne of Delhi to his own progeny.

For example, deep in central Punjab and far from the court in Delhi, a government official tried to prohibit the use of music and dance at the lodge of Shaikh Farid al-Din, but failed owing to the Sufi’s immense influence among the local population.

[^61]: Amir Hasan Sijzi, who resided in Delhi between 1308 and 1322, wrote: ‘The son of Khwaja Rukn al-din, the venerable Chishti saint … was taken captive during the onslaught of the infidel Mongols … During the Mongol onslaught, the infidels of Chinghiz Khan turned toward India. At that time, Qutb al-din counseled his friends, “Flee, for these people will overpower you”. When the Mongols reached Nishapur, its ruler summoned Shaykh Farid ad-din ‘Attar … and asked the Shaykh to petition God … It was then that I heard the report from Ghazna: the Mongols had reached that city and martyred my mother, father, and all of my close relations … As the Lahore traders were making their way home, they were informed *en route* that the Mongols had invaded their city and reduced it to rubble.’ Bruce B.

[^62]: The decline had already set in by the middle of the first millennium across India. Although some Buddhist pilgrimage centres persisted in the south and west until as late as the fifteenth century, by the year 1000 monastic Buddhism had been eclipsed and replaced by Hindu and Jain institutions. In the north-west, too, most Buddhist monasteries and pilgrimage sites had been abandoned by that time. Lars Fogelin, *An Archaeological History of Indian Buddhism* \(New York: Oxford University Press, 2015\), pp. 218–19.

[^63]: Around AD 400 the pilgrim Faxian counted twenty-two monasteries in Tamralipti, a seaport on the Bay of Bengal. By around 637, Xuanzang counted ten monasteries there. By 685, that figure had dropped to just five or six, as recorded by a third Chinese pilgrim, Yijing. Samuel Beal \(trans.\), *Chinese Accounts of India: Translated from the Chinese of Hiuen Tsiang* \(Calcutta: Susil Gupta, 1958, 4 vols\), vol. 4, pp. 403, 407, 408; J.

[^64]: See Wink, *al-Hind*, vol. 2, pp. 146–8, 334–51. By the eleventh and twelfth centuries, these kings gradually withdrew their patronage from these institutions, favouring Hindu temples instead. During those centuries, most of the art patronized by kings of the Pala dynasty was Brahmanic in subject matter, with Vaishnava themes outnumbering the rest three to one. Susan L. Huntington, *The ‘Pala-Sena’ Schools of Sculpture* \(Leiden: Brill, 1984\), pp. 155, 179, 201.

[^65]: Those that escaped attack – such as Somapura in Bengal, or Lalitagiri, Udayagiri and Ratnagiri in Orissa – were soon abandoned by their resident monks owing to disruptions in the flow of land revenues on which they had grown dependent. Fogelin, *Archaeological History*, p. 222. For a provocative analysis of the issue, which argues that Brahmanical classes took advantage of the Turkish conquest in order finally to defeat their ancient Buddhist rivals, see Giovanni Verardi, *Hardships and Downfall of Buddhism in India* \(New Delhi: Manohar, 2011\).

[^71]: Bahram Shah also patronized the translation of a widely popular collection of animal fables, illustrating an early, fruitful encounter between the Sanskrit and Persian worlds. Composed originally in Sanskrit, the *Panchatantra* had been translated into Middle Persian in the sixth century, then in the eighth century from Middle Persian into Arabic as *Kalila va Dimna*, and around 1145 from Arabic into modern Persian as the *Fables of Bidpai*. Since this occurred just as the Ghaznavid court was about to shift to Lahore, the *Panchatantra* effectively returned to India, though in a Persian guise. See Bosworth, *Later Ghaznavids*, p. 109. Browne adds: ‘Few books in the world have achieved so great a success as that of *Kalila and Dimna*, or have been translated into so many languages.’ Apart from Arabic and both Middle and Modern Persian, these include Greek, Hebrew, Latin, Spanish, Italian, Slavonic, Turkish, German, English, Danish, Dutch and French. Browne, *Literary History*, vol. 2, p. 350.

[^72]: The fifteenth-century biographer of Persian poets Daulatshah Samarqandi relates that Mahmud was regularly attended by 400 poets, presided over by the poet laureate. Bosworth, *Ghaznavids*, p. 131.

[^73]: By the mid thirteenth century works in that canon included, in addition to those just mentioned that were produced under Ghaznavid patronage, the advice literature of Kai Ka’us \(d. 1087\), Nizam al-Mulk \(d. 1092\), and Nizami Aruzi al-Samarqandi \(d. 1161\), the panygeric poetry of Anvari \(d. 1189\), the romance literature of Nizami Ganjavi \(d. 1209\) and the mystical poetry of ‘Attar \(d. 1221\). During Balban’s reign there appeared, among other such works, the ethical literature of Nasir al-Din Tusi and the moral poetry of Sa‘di \(d. 1291\). Although the canon of Persian literature continued to grow, for centuries the works of these important literati continued to be copied in libraries, taught in *madrasa*s and in some cases committed to memory.

## CHAPTER 2: THE DIFFUSION OF SULTANATE SYSTEMS, 1200–1400


[^1]: The Chola army that marched from the Tamil country north to Bengal in 1025, mentioned in the previous chapter, avoided the Vindhyas by hugging the low, eastern coastline.

[^2]: ‘It is advisable’, he said, ‘that during this year, the sublime standards should be put in motion for the purpose of ravaging and carrying on holy war in the extreme parts of the territory of Hindustan, in order that … booty may fall into the hands of the troops of Islam, and means to repel the infidel Mughals \[Mongols\], in the shape of wealth, may be amassed.’ Minhaj-ud-Din, trans.

Revenue according to measurement and house tax as well as grazing tax came to be fully accepted by subjects. Rebellions, idle talk and wishful thinking was entirely removed from people.’ Ibid., pp. 197–8.

When summoned to appear before the *qazi*, the sultan walked unarmed to the *qazi*’s court, saluted and bowed, having previously sent orders that the *qazi* should not stand up for him upon his arrival. At the court, the sultan stood before the judge, who ordered him to recompense the Hindu plaintiff for having killed his brother, and he did so. Ibid.

[^28]: Persian biographies and histories in Kashmir were written in close dialogue with the valley’s pre-sultanate mythic history as recorded in Sanskrit traditions. For example, the *Dastur-i salatin*, a mixed prose and verse praise of a certain Shaikh Hamza written in 1554, drew on Sanskrit texts such as the *Nilamata Purana* and Kalhana’s *Rajatarangini*, which described the Kashmir valley as originating from a body of water through the divine intervention of the great gods Brahma and Vishnu, with the emergent land being adorned by goddesses in the shape of rivers and pilgrimage sites scattered across the landscape. While the *Dastur* did not specifically mentioned those Hindu deities, it is replete with images of the valley’s bodies of water and their resident spirits \(*jinn*s\), just as pre-Islamic Kashmiri religious beliefs had focused on a landscape littered with sacred springs associated with snake deities \(*naga*s\), to which nearby pilgrimage sites were dedicated.

[^45]: This mosque is commonly known as the ‘Bhojsala’, reflecting a myth that it had originally been a ‘Hall of Sanskrit Learning’ erected by the famous ruler of the Paramara dynasty, Bhoja \(r. *c*.1000–1055\). However, the earliest reference to such a hall dates to 1902. Owing partly to nineteenth-century Orientalist stereotypes about Muslim iconoclasm in India, and partly to their own spectacular ineptitude, British imperial officers came to the mistaken belief that the mosque had been King Bhoja’s Sanskrit college, complete with a shrine and statue of Saraswati, the goddess of learning. See Michael Willis, ‘Dhar, Bhoja and Sarasvati: From Indology to Political Mythology and Back’, *Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society* 22, no. 1 \(Jan. 2012\), pp. 136–49.

[^46]: Dhar also had spiritual connections with north India. At the time of the Khalaji conquest in the early fourteenth century Kamal al-Din Malawi \(d. 1330\), a Sufi shaikh of the Chishti order, migrated to Dhar and was patronized by its first governor. As a disciple of two of India’s foremost Sufi shaikhs, Farid al-Din Ganj-i Shakar \(d. 1265\) and Nizam al-Din Auwliya \(d. 1325\), he, too, represented Delhi’s hegemonic presence in the region, for in Malwa, as in other provinces, the diffusion of the sultanate’s power had been accompanied by a diaspora of Chishti Sufis. See ibid., pp. 134–5.

[^61]: Although north Indian states had regularly recruited mounted archers from beyond India, much larger numbers of infantry or auxiliaries were recruited locally, with the ratio of infantry to cavalry varying from 3:1 to as many as 6:1. See ibid., pp. 22, 51.

[^62]: The pattern persisted even into the twentieth century. During the First World War, Hindu landholders who enlisted in the British Indian Army became Sikhs merely by the act of enlisting, while those who stayed at home remained ‘Hindus’. As a British recruiting officer in the Punjab noted at that time, ‘It was an almost daily occurrence for – say – Ram Chand \[i.e. a Hindu\] to enter our office and leave it as Ram Singh – Sikh recruit.’ Ibid., p. 58.

[^65]: Bardic sources dating to fifteenth-century Gujarat depict the ‘Rajput’ in multiple guises: as valorous warriors, as men constituting the retinue of such warriors, and as any itinerant men having access to weapons. These different meanings point to the fluidity of the category itself.

[^67]: Importantly, works that are today designated Hindi or Urdu were formerly called Hindavi, or a variant of that word, regardless of their script or their authors’ religious identity. The choice of script for a given literary work depended entirely on the predilections of the scribe or his patron, not their presumed religious affiliation. Recent scholarship has rejected the practice of categorizing texts and authors by their supposed religious identity, seeing instead an era of a shared landscape with multilingual genres. Orsini and Sheikh \(eds\), *After Timur Left*, p. 22. As used by contemporary chroniclers in the Deccan, ‘Hindavi’ referred to neither Hindi nor Urdu, but to local vernaculars such as Marathi or Kannada.

[^70]: The earliest text of this genre was *Chandayan*, written by Maulana Daud in 1379, followed by *Mirigavati* by Qutban \(1503\), *Padmavat* by Muhammad Jayasi \(1540\) and *Madhumalati* by Manjhan \(1545\).

[^71]: Early-twentieth-century Indian nationalists, trapped in their binary categories of Hindi/Hindu/*nagari* script versus Persian/Muslim/Arabic script, had difficulties fitting this hybridized genre into their dichotomized and polarized understanding of culture. In 1929 Ramchandra Shukla wrote a study linking language, national consciousness and history in an evolutionary scheme. But what to do with Muslims in the evolution of modern standard Hindi? The Islamic identity of *premakhyan* poetry was for him a difficulty and an embarrassment. See Behl, *Love’s Subtle Magic*, pp. 11–12.

[^72]: Maulana Daud was patronized in Awadh by a local functionary of the Tughluq dynasty, Qutban was patronized by Sultan Husain Shah Sharqi of Jaunpur after Sultan Bahlul Lodi of Delhi had driven him into exile in Bihar, and both Jayasi and Manjhan were patronized by Afghan rulers whose political bases were also in Bihar.

[^73]: Nor were Sufi poets like Jayasi the only ones composing such stories at this time. In order to bolster their claims to royal status, petty rulers or chieftains in central India, claiming Rajput status, patronized poets who wrote romance literature very similar in narrative style and substance to the *premakhyan* texts, and also in the emerging Hindavi written language.

## CHAPTER 4: THE DECCAN AND THE SOUTH, 1400–1650


[^1]: Writing around 1600, the historian Firishta recorded that a Deccani was once asked whom he considered the greater person, the Prophet Muhammad or the shaikh. The Deccani replied, with some surprise at the question, that although the Prophet was undoubtedly a great man, Gisudaraz was a far superior order of being.

[^8]: Such borrowing, however, was by no means universal across India. While noting that courtiers at Vijayanagara had avidly adopted the cosmopolitan Persianate dress code, Shah Rukh’s ambassador was shocked to see that upper-class men along India’s coasts went bare-chested in public, which to his Central Asian sensibility rendered them virtually naked. In 1433, a Chinese visitor noted that people in Sri Lanka and the Malabar coast walked in public bare to the waist, as did elite Muslims of the nearby Maldive islands. Wearing elite Persianate apparel – long-sleeved tunics and tall headgear – was a matter of affiliating with a known, transregional style, regardless of one’s religious identity.

[^51]: The Aravidu kings were also following a path blazed by earlier migrations of Telugu-speakers southwards. From the early fifteenth century onwards, martial, mercantile and cultivating castes had been moving from the dry upland plateau of Andhra south into the Tamil country. These aggressive, mobile and land-hungry pioneers generally avoided the most densely populated areas of the south, preferring to open up uncultivated regions for growing rice, millets and dry crops that used the same sort of tank irrigation that characterizes the drier northern Deccan. Migrations extending from the mid fifteenth to the late eighteenth centuries left their mark on subsequent demographic patterns. By the late nineteenth century Telugu-speakers comprised from 15 per cent to nearly a quarter of the population in some parts of the Tamil south. Subrahmanyam, *Political Economy*, pp. 16–17.

[^59]: The king’s career had a shadowy coda. According to Jesuit testimony, Śriranga III led a miserable life in Mysore, and around 1653 Kanthirava Narasaraja, having grown tired of his troublesome guest, left the king to his fate. Early the next year the latter managed to return to Vellore, but Tirumala, *nayaka* of Madurai, was so upset upon seeing that he ‘was again raising his head’ that he encouraged the sultan of Bijapur to drive him out of that city, which ‘Adil Shahi forces did in August 1654. ‘After wandering for six years in foreign states and alienating the neighbouring princes,’ recorded a contemporary missionary, the ‘poor’ king ‘withdrew into the last corner of his dominions still left to him’. That was Bednur, in the western plateau, where the *nayaka* of Ikkeri sheltered the powerless emperor, evidently hoping to use the latter’s nominal imperial status to help prosecute his own wars against his enemy to the south, the ruler of Mysore, one of Śriranga III’s former hosts. The last inscriptions issued in the name of Śriranga III are dated 1660, 1661 and finally 1669, just over a century after the Battle of Talikota. See Sauliere, ‘Revolt’, part 2, pp. 164–5, 169; K. D.

[^61]: This was based on a type of land tenure geared towards furnishing the ruler with troops recruited and maintained by an *amaranayaka*, or the noble granted such a land holding. The term *amara* is derived from the Arabic–Persian *amr*, in the sense of ‘command’. *Amr* is also the root of *amir*, or commander. See Wagoner, *Tidings*, pp. 198–200.

[^65]: In the mid fifteenth century Calicut collected a 2.7 per cent charge on the sale of all goods leaving its port. This rate was doubtless kept low by the availability of pepper at rival ports along the coast, rendering all of Malabar a buyer’s market. Stephen F.

[^68]: Malabar’s only seaport blessed with a natural harbour is Cochin, down the coast from Calicut. Ibn Battuta’s views on Calicut must be taken seriously. Unlike Marco Polo, he was not prone to exaggeration, and, having already visited ports throughout the Mediterranean, the Indian Ocean, and the South China Sea, he certainly had some basis for evaluating Calicut’s relative size.

[^4]: The British would later describe the acculturation of their own people in South Asia as ‘browning in the Indian sun’. But the contrasts between the Mughal and British imperial enterprises in this respect are instructive. Whereas earlier generations of East India Company servants had, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, adopted a wide spectrum of Indian culture, in the course of the early nineteenth century they became progressively more distant from their colonial subjects. With the Mughals it was the other way around, as an originally foreign dynasty over time became progressively more indigenized.

[^25]: Sreenivasan, ‘Rethinking’, p. 577. The same was true in Orissa. In 1589, after a successful campaign in which local Afghan landholders \(*zamindar*s\) in coastal Orissa were dislodged from power, a temple to the regional deity Jagannath in Puri was rebuilt – according to Kachwaha chronicles, by Man Singh, the conquering Mughal officer; and according to local Oriya chronicles, by a local chief. In any event, Man Singh claimed the city and its temple for Mughals, who administered revenues from the temple and the city. Ibid., pp. 575–6.

[^33]: Architecturally, one sees this most clearly in the Atiya mosque in modern Tangail District, Bangladesh. Built by Afghan patrons in 1609, this mosque, with its complex terracotta façade, its ringed corner towers and its curved cornice, is a highly evolved elaboration of the much older Bengal sultanate style, itself modelled on building practices and aesthetics of Bengali folk culture.

They, rajaputas and brahmanas \[*pandia*\] alike, shivered with fear, gathered courage and made submissions in their own languages *ni-a bhasa* \[before the Sultan’s court\].’ Quoted in ibid., p. 337. The passage comes from Vidyapati’s *Kirttilata*, which was composed in Avahatta, an early stage in the evolution of eastern Indian languages such as Bengali, Maithili, Assamese and Oriya.

[^44]: ‘Permanence of dominion’ is the phrase found in early-nineteenth-century British discourse regarding the East India Company’s rapid expansion of power in India. See, for example, Francis G.

In 1655, just two years before that succession struggle began, Dara translated \(or commissioned\) a Persian version of the *Yogavasistha*. Probably composed between the ninth and twelfth centuries, this Sanskrit text consists of dialogues between the troubled youth Rama, who would become the divine hero of the *Ramayana* epic, and the ascetic Vasistha Muni. Once again, the text’s central theme is the young Rama’s dilemma of reconciling disengagement with engagement with the world. In these dialogues, Vasistha relates to Rama the famous episode from the *Mahabharata* epic, in which the warrior Arjuna baulks at the prospect of killing his own relatives on the battlefield. Haunting both Arjuna and Dara was the question of how a spiritually accomplished person could engage in a war of succession against his own brothers. While working on this text, Dara knew that he would soon be facing the same dilemma faced by Arjuna. See Gandhi, ‘The Prince’, p. 73; Alam, ‘In Search of a Sacred King’, pp. 455–9.

On the second day after he reached Delhi’s southern suburb of Khizrabad, riots broke out among the ‘rabble of the city’, and his execution was ordered ‘according to the demands of the well-being of state and rule’. But he was also charged with studying and translating the Vedas, which he was accused of regarding as divine speech, ancient scripture and the holy book. He was additionally charged with wearing jewellery inscribed with the Sanskrit word *Prabhu* \(‘Lord’\). Muhammad Kazim, ed. Hadim Husayn and ‘Abd al-Hayy, *‘Alamgirnama* \(1865–8; repr.

Bernier, *Travels*, p. 10.

[^87]: Chroniclers writing after the emperor’s death, and motivated to paint him in a rigidly puritanical light, recorded that head clerks and accountants who were Hindus were ordered to be replaced by Muslims. But even if such an order were issued, we are told that such a discriminatory measure was never carried out. In any event, such a measure is contradicted by the emperor’s own statement in the matter.

This legal culture survived until the late eighteenth century, and only then, with crucial, British-inspired shifts in ideals of sociopolitical existence and legal governance, was *shari‘a* turned into “Mahomedan law” – or personal status laws for Muslims in British-ruled India.’ Ibid., p. 403.

[^6]: Munis Faruqui argues that he abandoned Delhi more from a position of weakness than from one of strength. Having been used by ‘Alamgir as a political counterweight to the emperor’s own sons, Nizam al-Mulk had never been assimilated into any of those sons’ households. As a result, he refused to take part in the war of succession following ‘Alamgir’s death in 1707. This, in turn, froze him out of the inner circle of that war’s victor, Bahadur Shah. And by sitting out of the succession wars that followed the reigns of both Bahadur Shah and Jahandar, Nizam al-Mulk remained politically marginalized at the end of Farrukh Siyar’s reign \(1713–19\) and beyond.

[^14]: To high-born members of the Mughal nobility who commanded professional archers, lancers or swordsmen mounted on heavy steeds, the peasant-soldiers they encountered in the Deccan appeared as little more than rabble. In 1740 one Mughal aristocrat described his Maratha adversaries as ‘unendowed with the excellence of noble or illustrious birth’. Yet he conceded that ‘as they undergo all sorts of toil and fatigue in prosecuting a guerrilla warfare, they prove superior to the easy and effeminate troops of Hind \[north India\], who for the most part are of more honourable birth and calling’.

Put another way, the meaning of Maratha was expanding to include all those participating in the Maratha state’s northern campaigns, in the same way that, several centuries earlier, villagers of eastern India’s military labour market became Rajputs by virtue of their recruitment by Rajput middlemen for service in extended campaigns far from their homes.

[^21]: ‘Taxes were called by Mughal terms,’ writes Gordon, ‘assessed in a Mughal manner, paid in the customary Muslim months. The Marathas even retained the Mughal differential transit duties, which charged Hindu traders double their Muslim counterparts. Maratha demands never exceeded the pre-existing Mughal settlement … When the Marathas established the basic apparatus of law and order – courts, rural and urban police – both the terminology and function resembled their Mughal counterparts.’ Ibid., pp. 143–4.

In other words, ‘Alamgir was asked to intervene in order to preserve the Hindu social hierarchy.

[^40]: Since the cultivation of wet rice, a labour-intensive crop, was the region’s major income-producing activity, Mughal land revenue statistics reflect changes in the relative population density of different sectors within the delta. Between 1595 and 1659 the revenue demand for the north-eastern and south-eastern parts of the delta increased by 97 per cent and 117 per cent respectively, whereas that for north-western Bengal, the most moribund part of the delta, actually declined by 13 per cent.

[^48]: Writing in 1595, at the dawn of the Mughal age in Bengal, Abu’l-fazl ‘Allami, the foremost spokesman for Mughal imperial ideology, wrote that the indigenous peoples of the eastern delta were of dark skin, had little or no beard, and practised a religion ‘said to be different to that of the Hindus and Muhammadans’.

[^50]: In Mukundaram’s *Candi Mangala*, Muslims directing forest-clearing operations are said to have come from the west, in contrast to the aboriginals who came from within the delta. A group of 2,000 Muslim labourers chanting the name of a Muslim holy man were led by one Zafar Mian, evidently the organizer of a workforce dedicated to forest-clearing operations. Mukundaram’s poem can thus be read as a grand epic dramatizing the process of civilization-building in the Bengal delta and, specifically, the eastward movement of the delta’s ecological frontier, as agrarian civilization pushed into formerly forested lands.

The high volume of silver imports also had political consequences, since it enabled the Mughals to elaborate a hierarchy of imperial *mansabdar*s whose ranks were based on cash salaries. Monetizing political status in this way had the effect of eroding traditional loyalties that had been based on ethnic, kinship or religious solidarities. Cash salaries had become the new standard of status.

[^74]: In Gujarat’s coastal entrepôt of Surat, where Mughal authority had already been usurped by Marathas, the Company had to share control of the port with Maratha chiefs. It was only after the annexation of the city in 1800 that the Company was able to remove intermediaries between its own agents and weaving communities, prevent non-Company buyers from engaging in trade, or using armed soldiers to enforce its measures.

[^75]: There was actually a bit of charades being played here. In order to prevent the British king from getting his hands on Bengal’s revenues, the House of Commons preferred that they be kept with the Company, which in turn pretended to be passing those revenues on to an Indian king who everybody knew would never see them.

[^21]: Works from that canon served as reference points in their daily thought. The earliest surviving manuscript of one of the most popular works in the canon of Hindavi literature, Jayasi’s *Padmavat* \(composed in 1540\), was copied in 1674 by a scribe named Muhammad Shakir. As he was making his copy, certain episodes from Jayasi’s Hindavi poem sparked his memory of fragments of the poetry of Hafiz, which he then scribbled in the margins of the manuscript.

He used neither *peyghambar* nor *rasul*, the respective Persian and Arabic terms for ‘messenger’, far less the Sanskrit *avatar* \(incarnation of a deity\) or *parameśvar* \(lord\).
