In 1655, just two years before that succession struggle began, Dara translated \(or commissioned\) a Persian version of the *Yogavasistha*. Probably composed between the ninth and twelfth centuries, this Sanskrit text consists of dialogues between the troubled youth Rama, who would become the divine hero of the *Ramayana* epic, and the ascetic Vasistha Muni. Once again, the text’s central theme is the young Rama’s dilemma of reconciling disengagement with engagement with the world. In these dialogues, Vasistha relates to Rama the famous episode from the *Mahabharata* epic, in which the warrior Arjuna baulks at the prospect of killing his own relatives on the battlefield. Haunting both Arjuna and Dara was the question of how a spiritually accomplished person could engage in a war of succession against his own brothers. While working on this text, Dara knew that he would soon be facing the same dilemma faced by Arjuna. See Gandhi, ‘The Prince’, p. 73; Alam, ‘In Search of a Sacred King’, pp. 455–9.

[^42]: The charges against Dara were both political and religious in nature. On the second day after he reached Delhi’s southern suburb of Khizrabad, riots broke out among the ‘rabble of the city’, and his execution was ordered ‘according to the demands of the well-being of state and rule’. But he was also charged with studying and translating the Vedas, which he was accused of regarding as divine speech, ancient scripture and the holy book. He was additionally charged with wearing jewellery inscribed with the Sanskrit word *Prabhu* \(‘Lord’\). Muhammad Kazim, ed. Hadim Husayn and ‘Abd al-Hayy, *‘Alamgirnama* \(1865–8; repr.

[^43]: Technically, this was a second coronation. On 21 July 1658, shortly after winning the Battle of Samugarh and confining his father, he had hastily and unceremoniously crowned himself in Delhi before setting off for the Punjab in pursuit of Dara.

[^75]: According to Bernier, while governing the Deccan for the second time, Aurangzeb caused it to be believed that his most cherished wish ‘was to pass the rest of his days in prayer or in offices of piety, and that he shrank from the cares and responsibility of government’. Bernier, *Travels*, p. 10. Manucci writes: ‘Above all, for a long time he pretended to be a faquir \[faqir\] a holy mendicant, by which he renounced the world, gave up all claim to the crown, and was content to pass his life in prayers and meditation.’ Manucci, *Storia*, vol. 1, p. 220.

[^86]: Must‘ad Khan, *Maasir-i-‘Alamgiri*, pp. 13–14. 

[^87]: Chroniclers writing after the emperor’s death, and motivated to paint him in a rigidly puritanical light, recorded that head clerks and accountants who were Hindus were ordered to be replaced by Muslims. But even if such an order were issued, we are told that such a discriminatory measure was never carried out. In any event, such a measure is contradicted by the emperor’s own statement in the matter. Ibid., p. 314; Haq \(trans.\), *Khafi Khan’s History*, pp. 252, 255.

[^88]: The order proved to be such a farce that it was formally withdrawn in 1681. Farhat Hasan, *State and Locality in Mughal India: Power Relations in Western India, c.1572–1730* \(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004\), p. 117.

[^89]: Bernier, *Travels*, p. 303. As Aurangzeb wrote to a Rajput leader during the War of Succession, ‘men belonging to various communities and different religions should live in the vale of peace and pass their days in prosperity, and no one should interfere in the affairs of another’.

[^90]: The Mughal government, he noted, ‘takes no notice of \[the people’s\] various Opinions and Casts \[*sic*\], one more than another. But the \[government’s\] powers are equally extended alike to all, for their Safety and Protection …’. Quoted in Rajeev Kinra, ‘Handling Diversity with Absolute Civility: The Global Historical Legacy of Mughal Sulh-i Kull’, *Medieval History Journal* 16, no. 2 \(2013\), p. 258. The writer was contrasting India under ‘Alamgir with the religious turmoil in England between the Civil War \(1642–51\), the Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell \(1653–58\) and the Revolution of 1688.

[^104]: Perceptions of ‘Alamgir have changed dramatically since the seventeenth century. A story circulating in 1990 in Machnur appears to be a memory of the same flood. In this version, ‘Alamgir built a ditch in an attempt to divert the river at Machnur so that it would destroy the local temple. But, instead, the river outwitted the emperor and, leaving the temple unharmed, washed away his entire camp.

This legal culture survived until the late eighteenth century, and only then, with crucial, British-inspired shifts in ideals of sociopolitical existence and legal governance, was *shari‘a* turned into “Mahomedan law” – or personal status laws for Muslims in British-ruled India.’ Ibid., p. 403.
