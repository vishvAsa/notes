I'm increasingly converging on a hypothesis of the revitalization of the Indo-European religion by an Indo-Iranian warrior-ritualist elite. In this model, the early IEan branches Hittite first & then proto-Tocharian split & moved away from the core. After that western branches, Greco-Armenian(?) & Balto-Slavic split away & started moving away from the core. Much of this grouping was then infused by a mobile Aryan elite with their new horses/chariots (in material terms) & an Aryan version of the Indo-European religion. We posit that caused an reinvigoration of the old IE religion in a form closer to the Aryan state. I suspect this did not affect that Hittites much, but impinged on non-IE religions of West Asia & north Africa. 

Just parking this hypothesis; if the gods of that pantheon are favorable we would present in toto later. Coming from a descendant of that group, I know this sounds incredibly parochial but I think the archaeological (human), genetic (equine) & philological evidence might be in its favor.
