The&#xA;Mongol conquests of Il-Khan Hülegü in West Asia put an end to the Arab&#xA;Islamic Caliphate in Baghdad. This was followed by the ascendency of the&#xA;Turkic Osman empire, at which point the power center within Islam&#xA;completely shifted from the Arab world to the Turkic world. After the&#xA;Osman Sultan Mehmet-II &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; took Constantinople from the&#xA;Byzantine Christians he declared himself the Khalifeh ül-Rasul Rab&#xA;al-A’alamin, i.e. Caliph of Islam. This Osman Caliphate lasted until the&#xA;last century when it was ended by the secular movement of Mustafa Kemal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>IA in west asia</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;First for the actual data.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As Damgaard linguistic supplement pointed out the earliest evidence for IA in Syria refers to mariannu in a tablet from Tell Leilān from 18th century BCE. This suggests IA were alreay making presence felt in region by then. The early Aryan names from West Asia are predominantly Indo-Aryan not Iranian suggesting that this branch was not undivided I-IR but already divided IA. So we have to place IA separation after that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Revitalization</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tressel.xyz/threads/1501402174311571457&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m increasingly converging on a hypothesis of the revitalization of the Indo-European religion by an Indo-Iranian warrior-ritualist elite. In this model, the early IEan branches Hittite first &amp;amp; then proto-Tocharian split &amp;amp; moved away from the core. After that western branches, Greco-Armenian(?) &amp;amp; Balto-Slavic split away &amp;amp; started moving away from the core. Much of this grouping was then infused by a mobile Aryan elite with their new horses/chariots (in material terms) &amp;amp; an Aryan version of the Indo-European religion. We posit that caused an reinvigoration of the old IE religion in a form closer to the Aryan state. I suspect this did not affect that Hittites much, but impinged on non-IE religions of West Asia &amp;amp; north Africa.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
