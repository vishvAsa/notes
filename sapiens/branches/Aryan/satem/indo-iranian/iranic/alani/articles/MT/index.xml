      <description>&lt;p&gt;The mongol word for Arya was Asut. Chingiz Khan conquered the last remaining group of Aryans on the steppes and organized them into several corps that fought alongside his son Tolui and grandson Qubilai. They were probably Iranic Aryans related to Ossetians rather than Indic ones.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A(i)ryana&amp;gt; Alan. It is not clear if the far eastern one were lambdacizing like the western/Caucasian ones. The genetic evidence suggests they entered long before the Chingized period &amp;amp; persisted.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
