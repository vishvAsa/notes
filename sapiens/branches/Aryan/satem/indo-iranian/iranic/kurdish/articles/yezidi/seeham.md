‚ÄúHe told me you are a #Yezidi, either we will kill you or you will convert to lsIam . I said, please kill me, don‚Äôt rape me, I love my husband. He said it‚Äôs not your decision. This is halal. In the Koran,it‚Äôs mentioned that you can take the women of other religions as sex slaves‚Äú. The ISIS fighter who bought Seeham from Abu Anas was called Abu Qutada. 

He was Lebanese and had a Syrian wife from Raqqa. ‚ÄúHe was so bad,‚Äù said Seeham, ‚Äúbut his wife treated me even worse than him.‚Äù üö® She forced me to shave my body. She brought me sexy clothes to wear for her husband and helped him rape me by tying me to the bed. She used very tough, cheap and bad words with me,‚Äù recalled Seeham.

üö®On top of helping Abu Qutada rape Seeham, his wife forced her to clean their four-story house from top to bottom every day. Abu Qutada‚Äôs wife would invite her female friends to join her in taunting Seeham as she cleaned. ‚ÄúShe forced me to clean the entrance to the neighbors' flat and she forced me to clean her and her neighbors‚Äô shoes. They would make fun of me while I cleaned, saying look at my slave, she‚Äôs a bitch, she‚Äôs a Yazidi,‚Äù said Seeham.‚Äú

üö®‚ÄúOnce when I was cleaning, my daughter was on the fourth floor of the house crying because she was hungry. They never gave us enough food. His wife wouldn‚Äôt allow me to go upstairs to see my daughter. She forced me to clean from the fourth to the first floor. üö®The whole time I could hear my daughter crying. This was heartbreaking because my daughter was so hungry. She wouldn‚Äôt allow me to give her milk,‚Äù said Seeham.

## Capture
Seeham was just 19 yrs old when IS invaded Hardan,northern Shingal town where she lived with her husband and infant daughter. IS killed her husband along with the rest of the men in Hardan that day. Women/ children were hauled away in buses and driven to a holding area in Tal Afar she was passed from one ISIS fighter to the next. She was raped almost daily. Sometimes she was gang raped by her owner‚Äôs guards. But of all the abuses she endured, what outraged her the most was the women who were complicit in it -- and who participated directly in her rape.

In addition to being raped, captured Yazidi women were forced to work as domestic servants for ISIS families. The wives and children of ISIS fighters would often participate in verbally and physically abusing Yazidis. For Seeham and at least one other Yazidi survivor, the complicity went even further. The second ISIS fighter who bought her had a wife who helped him rape her. The wife would restrain Seeham‚Äôs arms and legs, apply her makeup, dress her up in lingerie in preparation for her husband. She would prepare Seeham for rape and even seemed to derive enjoyment from the excruciating process, Seeham recalled, her doe brown eyes welling up with tears of anger.

An ISIS prison cell for Yazidi women and girls in the collective town of Tal Ezeir (Arabic name is Qahtaniyah) located south of Shingal. Yazidis were forced to pray in the direction of Mecca as demonstrated by the Qibla on the wall.

Seeham spent the next six months being shuffled between the Iraqi cities of Tal Afar and Mosul from one holding area to the next. She was imprisoned with hundreds and sometimes thousands of Yazidi women and children.

Each day IS commanders would select girls to sell as sex slaves. Seeham watched them drag away girls as young as 9. They were usually pulled from their mothers/older siblings kicking, screaming over the riotous objections of their relatives,who were brutally beaten for protesting. ‚ÄúThey were choosing the prettiest and most beautiful girls for the ISIS leadership,‚Äù said Seeham. Desperate to make herself look as unattractive as possible, Seeham cut her eyelashes, smeared ash on her face and avoided bathing. ‚ÄúI wore the clothes of elderly women. We would cover our faces with scarves and make some crazy movements to try and look ugly. I put a white cloth on my head to look older, anything to avoid being taken by them.‚Äù

Yazidi women quickly realized that ISIS placed a higher value on unmarried girls, so many would say they were married even if they weren‚Äôt. They would even pretend their nephews, nieces or young siblings were their children. Seeham‚Äôs daughter was just 4 months old at the time. Even though she was feeding her child with baby formula, Seeham would pretend to breastfeed her in front of ISIS members to remind them that she was a married woman. Seeham‚Äôs attempts to repel ISIS worked for about six months. Then one day she was selected.

The first IS fighter who bought Seeham was a man called Abu Anas.She pleaded with him not to rape her, asked why he was treating her this way. 

> ‚ÄúHe told me you are a Yazidi,either we will kill you or you will convert to Islam. I said, please kill me, don‚Äôt rape me,I love my husband. He said it‚Äôs not your decision.This is haIaI,In the Koran,it‚Äôs mentioned that you can take the women of other religions as sex slaves. This is our right, we are not doing anything wrong, it‚Äôs according to Islamic law.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are kuffar, you deserve this,‚Äù she remembered him saying. Abu Anas was Iraqi. He had two guards, one Lebanese and the other, a Syrian. The three of them gang raped Seeham on several occasions, usually as punishment for resisting Abu Anas. They would rape her with her baby girl in the room.

It killed her to hear her daughter‚Äôs cries during the abuse. Seeham believed she was living a nightmare that couldn‚Äôt get any worse. But it always did. Abu Qutada returned Seeham to Abu Anas after she threatened to throw herself off the balcony. She was sold to 5 more men after that.

Most of the Yazidi survivors described similar abuses from IS wives. In some cases, they say the children of ISIS fighters also abused them. A report published by the Independent International UN Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic that found the wives and children of ISIS fighters often abused captive Yazidi women and children both verbally and physically.

> ‚ÄúISIS fighters, and sometimes the wives of ISIS fighters, regularly force Yazidi women and girls to work in their houses. Many of those interviewed recounted being forced to be the domestic servant of the fighter and his family. Sometimes, they were also made to look after his children. When held closer to the frontlines, Yazidi women and girls are forced to cook for their respective fighter-owners and other ISIS fighters housed with or near him. One Yazidi girl,13 years old, was held for 11 months in ISIS-controlled territory and sold multiple times. Sexually enslaved, she recounted also being forced to cook,clean and wash the clothes of her Syrian fighter-owner and his family at a house in Raqqah city,‚Äù 

said the report. ‚ÄúIn some cases, wives/ children of IS fighter would also beat Yazidi children,‚Äù adds the report.

## Indoctrination and lack of justice
Iraqi authorities were holding some 1,400 foreign ISIS wives and children in a refugee camp outside Mosul. Though many are said to have been deceived into coming to ISIS territory, at least some likely participated in atrocities against Yazidis.

It remains to be seen if and how the adult women, particularly the foreigners, who participated in such actions will be held accountable or how the indoctrination of children, in ISIS territories, will be dealt with.

A Lebanese woman who was married to two IS fighters, first to a Lebanese man and then to a Tunisian, told Akhbar that ISIS wives would often fight with their husbands ‚Äúbecause they feel jealous‚Äù of the Yazidi sex slaves. ‚ÄúThere was a lot of tension between the wives and sex slaves.‚Äù The IS female terrorist showed no remorse or sympathy for the treatment of Yazidis as she explained how her husband and his friends would buy and sell them on Telegram, an encrypted messaging app. She was cold except for when she giggled while discussing the topic. 

An ISIS wife from Tunisia provided a similar testimony about the jealousy over Yazidi slaves, 

> ‚ÄúMany men loved Yazidi sex slaves more than their wives. Just imagine a man gets himself a Yazidi slave and as time passes he begins to love her more than his own wife, treats her better and if this Yazidi converts to Islam he will be able to marry her.Marry! Do you get this? It means she will become free, go wherever she wants. She won‚Äôt be a slave anymore in this case. Is this clear?‚Äù  

That isn‚Äôt entirely true. Yazidi women were compelled to convert, but that did not free them from sexual slavery. However, it did give them a little bit of wiggle room to run away. That‚Äôs how Seeham escaped. She tricked the last IS fighter who bought her, named Hassan in Mosul, into believing he genuinely embraced Islam, loved him and wanted to be his wife. She slowly gained his trust and he allowed her to contact her family over the phone just to tell them she was still alive. She secretly was in touch with them, they arranged to smuggle Seeham out of Mosul, formerly IS-controlled city where she was being held as Hassan‚Äôs captive. Due to Seeham‚Äôs cleverness and sheer luck, the ruse worked. Had she been caught, Hassan would have killed her daughter.

Indeed, ISIS Terrorists often punished Yazidi runaways by gang raping them and sometimes killing their children. Seeham escaped to her family in a displaced persons camp, but the psychological scars of her enslavement still haunt her. Her sleep is pierced each night by terrifying visions of the men and women who tormented her. By day, she wonders if any of them will ever face justice.

There are still 2713 Yezidis facing same and worse fate of Seeham everyday since 9 yrs.
