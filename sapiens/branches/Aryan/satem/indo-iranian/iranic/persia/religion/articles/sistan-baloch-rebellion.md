King Ezad-al-Dolah: Kill them all, Kill anyone who follows the old religion(Zoroastrians), No Mercy for The lost souls.

In year 970, Ezd-Al-Dolah of Buyid house declared Jihad against Kuch & Baluch tribes of Kerman who had kept their Zoroastrian beliefs, 330yrs after  Islamic Conquest/Invasion.

The House of Ilyas which was The Ruling house of Kerman and the ally of Samanids deceived the Zoroastrians to defeat the Buyid dynasty, Zoroastrians forces won the first battle against Buyids & cut the hand of Muiz-Al-Dolah, King’s brother…

When the news arrived to Buyid’s court, Ezad-Al-Dolah called for Jihad and take an oath to end this 39yrs continuous war & End the Zoroastrianism and Balochs both. The Buyid Army burnt down Sirjan, Baft, Hormuz,.. till they arrived to Jiroft The heartland of the Kuch & Baluch…

Then the big war began: 6K Zoroastrian-Balochis who have been betrayed by the House of Ilyas lead by Abu said and Aba-Al-Fawars against tens of thousands of Buyid Muslim forces; the battle lasted for days but the Zoroastrian Baloch lost the war and The Buyids entered Jiroft.. 

Men or Women, Child or old were killed, the green Barez mountains turned Red, the fire temples were tore down.
The defeated Zoroastrian Baloch were banished from Kerman and chased till Tiz in Makran &Indus.

It took centuries for Baloch to gain strength in Kerman, but  Zoroastrianism died among them.

The last resistance of the Zoroastrian Balochs of Sistan in the 15th century:
The Baloch farmers, who were fed up with the People’s conversion to Islam &the taxes, gathered in Sarbisheh and Nahbandan cities of Sistan and vowed to defeat the Muslims and build fire temples.

First The Farmers burned the Farmakān mosque of Esfezar. One by One, Farmers broke the pulpits of mosques in the city, and set them on fire. Till the news of the mosques burned by infidels(the way Writer called Zoroastrians) reached Herat and Qain, the Muslim rulers. 

Rulers of Khurasan put such a fire on the lives of the followers of old religion(Zoroastrians).

All of them(Zoroastrian Balochs),nomad or farmer, were killed or banished from Sistan &Khorasan, and took refuge in the deserts &mountains of Makuran, Turan,etc.
