A composition by Farya Faraji. The lyrics are in Middle-Persian, the chronological variety of the Persian language spoken in the Sasanian Era, and they are taken from a rhymed ballad dating to the time following the fall of the Sasanian Empire at the hands of the Arabic Rashidun Caliphate. According to J. C. Tavadia from "The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland" in 1955, while the exact date of the poem cannot be pinpointed, some estimates can be made. 

The greatest peculiarity of the poem is that it rhymes--as a general rule of thumb, Iranian and Greco-Roman poems of the Ancient World did not rhyme, and the concept was popularised by the Arabs following their expansion in the Early Middle-Ages. This would point to a late date for the poem, but Tavadia indicates that the use of certain, more archaic Middle-Persian words supports the idea that this poem would have been written at an earlier date, therefore it is possible that this text was produced in the very decades following the conquest of Iran by the Arabs.

The text expresses the hope of the era's Iranians, who await the coming of a Zoroastrian messianic figure called Shah Vahram Varzavand, a figure who will come from India, overthrow the Arab invaders and restore native Iranian and Zoroastrian rule to the land. The poem can essentially be contextualised as a "wish-image" of the oppressed Zoroastrian Iranians yearning for the return of the previous state of rule. The figure of Shah Vahram as a messianic figure carries with him the weight of Iranian mythology, as he is said to be of the lineage of the Kayanian--the mythological dynasty of Iran who was said to have ruled at the beginning of the world, and the dynasty around which the Shahnameh epic revolves. 

The poem can therefore be described as both a deeply nationalistic and religious one; the two concepts being intertwined in this historical context, with Zoroastrianism being one with the concept of Iranian identity in the eyes of the text's writer(s).
