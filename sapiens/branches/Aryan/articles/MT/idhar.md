Interestingly Middle & New Indo-Aryan -- Pkt: idha; Hindi: idhara; Avestan: idhA(?); Old Iranic: Ida; Greek: ithA conform to the PIE state rather than Skt iha. This points to multiple waves of Arya-s (also seen in Vedic/Para-Vedic religions) & the retention of IE archaism in MIA.

One can also, despite all the orthographic challenges, say that the West Asian Indo-Aryan dialect seen in the Mitanni and Hittite lands was distinct from the core RV dialect. It was rhotacizing like some early Aryan dialects in India.
