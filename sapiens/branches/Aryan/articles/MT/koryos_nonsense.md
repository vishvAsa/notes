title = "Koryos Nonsense"
+++

This KÃ³ryos nonsense that is endlessly boosted in the Occidental IEist cycles with an almost lupine/canine frenzy is one of the most foundationless bits of speculation that is largely untethered from IE philology. It really has no place in sane understanding of the IE past. It is something that happens when you only have the language but not the living tradition to conduct a good philological exploration of the past.
