  <meta property="og:description" content="Introduction
Serious scholars will continue to debate many aspects of the Nanking Atrocity perpetrated by the Japanese military from mid-December 1937 to early-February 1938. Why did it take place? How did Japanese military discipline break down? How many Chinese were massacred and raped? These and other questions remain open to scholarly debate. But no serious historian of any nationality doubts or denies that the Atrocity did take place. I stress this point at the outset because of, among other things, the grossly uninformed treatment this issue has received over the past decade in the American news media. The Atrocity has not achieved its full place in the catalog of world atrocities despite the great suffering that took place during those terrible weeks in Nanking, the Chinese capital city. Of course, the same can be said for other great acts of mass murder in the twentieth century, such as massacres of Armenians under the regime of the Young Turks during World War I, or the Porrajmos or Gypsy genocide by the Nazis during World War Two. But this hardly stanches the pain felt by survivors of Nanking and by their descendants. Over the past decade, there has been a dramatic surge of interest in Nanking and other atrocities committed by the Japanese in wartime China. This has taken place both in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and in Chinese diaspora communities, especially in North America. There is even a journal published in Chinese in the United States expressly devoted to the topic, the Jih-pen ch’in-Hua yen-chiu (Studies of Japanese Aggression against China), and there are now many websites focused on Nanking and similar Japanese wartime atrocities.1 Organizations sponsoring the journal and websites have held many conferences and other commemorative events, such as a major symposium at Princeton University in November 1997, and a number of recent books by young Chinese nationalists 1 See, for example, the following websites: www.Nanking1937.org/; www.smn.co.jp/gallery/">

  <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Serious scholars will continue to debate many aspects of the Nanking Atrocity perpetrated by the Japanese military from mid-December 1937 to early-February 1938. Why did it take place? How did Japanese military discipline break down? How many Chinese were massacred and raped? These and other questions remain open to scholarly debate. But no serious historian of any nationality doubts or denies that the Atrocity <em>did</em> take place. I stress this point at the outset because of, among other things, the grossly uninformed treatment this issue has received over the past decade in the American news media. The Atrocity has not achieved its full place in the catalog of world atrocities despite the great suffering that took place during those terrible weeks in Nanking, the Chinese capital city. Of course, the same can be said for other great acts of mass murder in the twentieth century, such as massacres of Armenians under the regime of the Young Turks during World War I, or the Porrajmos or Gypsy genocide by the Nazis during World War Two. But this hardly stanches the pain felt by survivors of Nanking and by their descendants. Over the past decade, there has been a dramatic surge of interest in Nanking and other atrocities committed by the Japanese in wartime China. This has taken place both in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and in Chinese diaspora communities, especially in North America. There is even a journal published in Chinese in the United States expressly devoted to the topic, the <em>Jih-pen ch’in-Hua yen-chiu</em> (Studies of Japanese Aggression against China), and there are now many websites focused on Nanking and similar Japanese wartime atrocities.1 Organizations sponsoring the journal and websites have held many conferences and other commemorative events, such as a major symposium at Princeton University in November 1997, and a number of recent books by young Chinese nationalists 1  See, for example, the following websites: <a href="https://www.Nanking1937.org/;">www.Nanking1937.org/;</a> <a href="https://www.smn.co.jp/gallery/">www.smn.co.jp/gallery/</a></p>

<p>The Nanking Atrocity and Chinese Historical Memory</p>
<p>have highlighted the Nanking Atrocity. In 2007, the seventieth anniversary of that event, it is important to examine the motives behind these highly politicized activities, which show little or no sign of abating.</p>
<p>Most significantly, in 1997 the late Iris Chang published her bestseller, <em>The</em> *Rape of Nanking: The Forgotten Holocaust of World War II. * 2 Not only has it sold several hundred thousand copies and been translated into a host of languages, Chang held numerous extremely successful book signings and appeared at many scholarly conferences before her death. In her book and lectures, she made the startling claim that, not only are the actions of the Japanese military in Nanking comparable to the Nazi Holocaust against the Jews of Europe; in fact, when properly calculated, the Nanking death count actually exceeds the</p>
<p>“Shoah,” as that event is known in Hebrew.3 Although explicit references to the Holocaust in the PRC have been rare until very recently, young Chinese dem-onstrators did seize upon the swastika to vent their anger at the United States after the May 1999 NATO bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade. Why are such comparisons being made both in the PRC and abroad? And why now?</p>
<p>Why is it that young generations of Chinese both at home and in the diaspora overseas try to seize center stage from the established historical professions in the PRC, in Taiwan, and in Hong Kong? Why do they fervently seek to present the pain, suffering, and victimhood to the rest of the world on behalf of all Chinese?</p>

<p><strong>The Nanking Atrocity and Postwar China(s)</strong></p>
<p>From December 1937 to February 1938, at the actual time of the event in and around Nanking, few Chinese were in a position to comprehend the enormity of the mass murder going on around them; any who tried to gather data of this sort would have been in immediate mortal danger. Japanese soldiers who might have been able to report the scale of the killings obviously had no motivation to do so. Japanese journalists on the scene were subject to government censorship, or for the most part they suppressed the story voluntarily. The small Western community in Nanking was living in a compound, the Nanking Safety Zone (NSZ) set up in late-November. Although** <strong>these men and women</strong> **</p>
<p>had some sense of what was going on and have left us with valuable records, 2  The website is: china.muzi.net/news/topics/massacre.shtml.</p>

<p>they could not see or hear about what went on throughout the entire city and in areas outside of it until much later.4</p>
<p>After the war, the International Military Tribunal for the Far East (IMTFE), better known as the Tokyo War Crimes Trials, convened from 1946 to 1948; and a number of Japanese, Chinese, and foreigners in Nanking at the time were called as witnesses. The IMTFE came up with a figure of at least 200,000</p>
<p>Chinese murdered at Nanking. One Japanese convicted of war crimes at Nanking and sentenced to death was Gen. Matsui Iwane, the commander of Japanese forces, who had not even been in Nanking until 17 December. Matsui was aware of the brutal acts committed in the city and condemned his men for their savage excesses, having earlier demanded that Chinese prisoners of war (POWs) not be executed. But at his trial in Tokyo he denied that anything like a wholesale massacre had taken place. Nevertheless, the IMTFE found him guilty for not having prevented the crimes committed by men under his command, and he was hanged in 1948. By that time, however, the trials had become engulfed in more pressing concerns of the Cold War. There was considerable clamor among left-wing Japanese and among some elements of the general public to bring a much longer list of their own wartime leaders to the dock, but Gen. Douglass MacArthur, the commander of Allied Occupation forces, did not want to alienate conservative Japanese elites by prolonging the trials.</p>
<p>The Chinese Kuomintang (KMT) government under Chiang Kai-shek held much harsher postwar trials. These established the death toll at 300,000 and as a result, a number of implicated Japanese were executed. China at this time, however, was in the throes of a second civil war that the Chinese Communists under Mao Tse-tung would soon win. Shortly after its ouster from the mainland, the KMT dropped all claims to reparations for war damages. Chiang was concerned about diplomatic isolation and alienating the Japanese, and he needed East Asian allies in the Cold War as he established a new regime on Taiwan. When the Communists came to power on the mainland, they too refused war reparations as part of a policy of “self-reliance,” and thus foreswore the PRC’s ability to push that demand in the future. (Chinese individuals, however, can and do continue to sue the Japanese government and businesses for compensation.) Thus, in the immediate postwar period, the world did in effect recognize the Nanking Atrocity, but only a handful of Japanese were executed for their roles in it, and the Japanese government itself never tried any alleged war criminals. More importantly, though, nothing was implemented to keep 4  See Rabe, <em>Good Man of Nanking</em>; Smalley, ed., <em>American Missionary Eyewitnesses to the</em> <em>Nanking Massacre</em>; Brook, ed., <em>Documents on the Rape of Nanking</em>; and Zhang [Chang], ed., <em>Eyewitnesses to Massacre</em>.</p>

<p>The Nanking Atrocity and Chinese Historical Memory</p>
<p>the Atrocity in the public memory—such as a monument or annual commemoration. That situation obtained until the impressive stone memorial went up in Nanking on 15 August 1985.</p>
<p>The first postwar PRC generation produced little serious scholarship on the Atrocity, in part because they deemed it but one aspect of a horrific wartime experience interpreted in light of the subsequent Communist victory and the Cold War. As Mao Tse-tung putatively declared on the founding of the PRC,</p>
<p>“China has stood up!” The Communists saw themselves, not the KMT, as victors in the war, and they had far bigger socioeconomic problems to contend with than seeking global recognition of Japanese war crimes. Most significantly, the PRC has always hampered serious scholarship on history in order to control the interpretation of it. The PRC government also strategically exploits history against international enemies, and deploys it to inspire shame in potential trading partners.5 For example, it used the Atrocity as an ideological, albeit irrational, anti-US surrogate during the Korean War. In 1952 the PRC regime tried to implicate Americans in the Atrocity by claiming that the International Committee (IC)—an organization of Westerners who actually saved many thousands of Chinese civilians in the Nanking Safety Zone (NSZ)—was a gang of Western imperialists complicit with the Japanese invaders.6 The PRC would again use the Atrocity during the 1960s to criticize the U.S. role in building up bases in Japan. Both of these deployments of the Atrocity helped escalate the Cold War. Yet at the same time, the PRC regime has been careful to control its criticism of the Atrocity owing to the importance of Sino-Japanese trade. Even before diplomatic normalization in 1972, the two countries had been engaged in trade that has grown to a massive volume today. PRC government leaders like to remind their Japanese counterparts of Japan’s heinous wartime acts, usually at face-to-face meetings, and the Japanese government usually acqui-esces in the interests of continuing this mammoth bilateral trade.</p>
<p>In order to maintain this strategic card, the PRC regime has tried to keep the Nanking issue from imploding among its populace, potentially injuring these lucrative Japanese contacts. Still far from a democracy, the Chinese gov-5  This view has been noted by Japanese and Westerners alike. See, for example, Kojima, “Nit-Chū kankei no ‘atarashii hatten dankai’.” I would not go so far as to argue, as Newby does, that the Japanese play along out of a sense of guilt. See Newby, <em>Sino-Japanese Relations: China’s</em> <em>Perspective</em>, p. 13. See also Gries, “Face Nationalism,” chapter 4. Gries argues convincingly that this is not merely a phenomenon of the Communist Party dictating policy to the Chinese people, but that there is much popular support for anti-Japanese policies in China.</p>

<p>ernment can exercise such prerogatives. It exploits the issue both to keep the Japanese in their place and to show its own people how it has gained the upper hand in Sino-Japanese relations, but it never mobilizes the masses to the point of seriously damaging trade. To be effective, then, the Peking regime has to walk a thin line. It must control public expressions of anti-Japanese sentiment by orchestrating demonstrations against Japan on other selected issues, such as the textbook controversy of the early 1980s, when the Japanese press leaked what proved to be inaccurate stories of the Ministry of Education’s plans to soften the description of Japanese aggression in World War II.</p>
<hr>
<p>**Why Diaspora Chinese and Why Now? **</p>
<p>Mainland Chinese have until very recently had their hands tied by their government. Overseas Chinese, however, have been much more active, nor just in writing about Nanking and other wartime atrocities, but also in** **pushing for a wholesale condemnation of Japan and its alleged nonpayment of compensation. They believe that the Japanese, and other foreign peoples, have not accorded the 1937–38 Atrocity the importance that it warrants in modern world history, and that the Japanese government has not apologized sufficiently. At a number of international scholarly conferences I have attended, Chinese-American scholars have vociferously attacked Japanese academics and castigated fellow Chinese from the mainland for being “soft” on Japan. Overseas Chinese—and not just scholars—are justifiably angered by this or that rightwing Japanese group or individual who periodically denies the veracity of the Atrocity—although high-level Japanese government officials are forced to resign whenever they do this. But unlike Chinese living in the PRC, who cannot easily demonstrate their displeasure on such occasions, diaspora Chinese are free to express their opinions openly.</p>
<p>Recently, expressions of outrage among overseas Chinese about events in Nanking that occurred seventy years ago have become intricately tied to the complex issue of Chinese identity. Japan has inevitably played a crucial role in this identity formation given the close cultural and historical relationship between the two countries and the key role that Japan has played in China’s own modernization since the late-nineteenth century. Despite the complexity and general amicability of this centuries-long history, the Atrocity has become <em>the</em> defining event in how many Chinese perceive Japan—to the extent of overshadowing over a millenium of previous relations. Even some gifted Chinese historians attribute not just World War II, but pre-twentieth century Japanese behavior, to an aggressive and expansionist Japanese “nature,”</p>
<p>162</p>
<p>The Nanking Atrocity and Chinese Historical Memory</p>
<p>usually connected with <em>bushidō</em> (the samurai ethos). As a symbol of Japan-as-aggressor, then, the Atrocity has become profoundly entwined with contemporary Chinese identity.</p>
<p>This issue has come to the fore among overseas Chinese only in the recent past. Other immigrant peoples have forged identities within a diaspora separated from their homelands over many centuries. Unlike them, however, the overseas Chinese experience did not really stare until the mid-nineteenth century, and it has become seriously politicized only in the last 50 years or so.</p>
<p>This politicization largely resulted from the post-1949 PRC-Taiwan rift, with growing numbers of ethnic Chinese living in Southeast Asia, Australia, the United States, and Canada. Whereas the overseas Chinese community was once strictly split between supporters of Taiwan and the PRC, it now reverberates with a multiplicity of voices. Moreover, increasing numbers of these ethnic Chinese were not born abroad. Especially since the 1970s, new modes of transportation—including jumbo jets and cheap air fares—have changed the very nature of immigration. People now move about between nations with considerably more ease, but perhaps ironically this has heightened their individual sense of ethnicity.7</p>
<p>New immigrants from Taiwan as well as highly educated PRC Chinese have brought new experiences and aspirations to the fore to create new fault lines within the overseas Chinese community. One of the more vocal groups of overseas Chinese not born abroad has been the scholarly community. Since the late-1980s, far more Chinese students and academics have been studying and teaching in Western institutions of higher learning than ever before. The West has afforded them more freedom, not only for academic pursuits, but for their gradually emerging political goals as well. This development has allowed many Chinese from the mainland to be less directly bound by their homeland than was true earlier. The worldwide web has also facilitated the expression of new voices by simplifying domestic and international communication to an unprecedented extent, and by providing a forum in which all views can be freely averred. The PRC government is desperately trying to control this phenomenon, but it is impossible to do so.8 As various Chinese constituencies within the diaspora seek to assert themselves in the academic community and over the internet, they search for issues on which to ground their identities.</p>
<p>The Nanking Atrocity has become the most prominent of these.</p>
<p>Thus, there are now more voices claiming to articulate Chinese identity than ever before, but paradoxically there is also a weaker basis on which to 7  See Hirano, “Transnational Flows of People and International Exchanges,” pp. 97–98.</p>
<p>8  Buruma, “China in Cyberspace,” pp. 9–12.</p>
<p>The Nanking Atrocity And Chinese Historical Memory 163</p>
<p>build that identity. One by-product of the modern era has been a kind of cultural deracination. Despite its obvious merits, the North American melting pot has had an unfortunate result: few of us are solidly grounded in the cultures, languages, and histories that are reputedly our own. As overseas Chinese—both those born in China and abroad—search for an identity in this the era of identity politics, they often find that they lack the tools needed to acquire one. Cultural deracination for the Chinese in China itself has been exacerbated by the trend toward iconoclasm in modern history with its self-conscious, often violent, rejection of China’s long cultural heritage. This began in the New Culture Movement of the 1910s that blamed traditional culture for all of China’s political, social, and economic ills; and it culminated in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of the late-1960s and early-1970s. As a result, not only American- or Canadian-born ethnic Chinese, but even mainland Chinese who emigrate, are often ignorant of their culture and history.</p>
<p>Entering the hot-house atmosphere of North American identity politics, they lack positive materials with which to forge their identity.9 It is therefore tempting for them—like many other ethnic groups—to latch on to major negative instances in their history in order to forge that identity. For example, most North American Jews no longer know their own languages, religious texts, and cultural traditions in ways that their grandparents or great-grandparents did as a matter of course. So they have fastened on to the state of Israel and on to the sanctity of the Holocaust—the two are deeply interwoven—as basic to their Jewish identity. Many Chinese in the diaspora embrace the Atrocity, “the <em>Tat’u-sha</em>,” in the same way.10</p>
<p>Why choose a negative instance—a horrific catastrophe in which** **so many of one’s putative fellow ethnics died—as basic to one’s identity? This is, I believe, because such an event represents something unassailable and irreproachable; it immediately links all members of an ethnic group in victimhood and bonds them in a way that cannot be questioned. This aspect or identity formation is elemental to the recent trends toward retribalization and toward the new sanctity of “difference,” especially in the United States and Canada. Jews there have “remembered” and used the Holocaust in a similar way. For 2 decades after the end of the war, memory of the Shoah was faint as it went through a lag period, but took off dramatically from the 1960s and 1970s. By the late-1970s, 9  I tried some years ago to describe the disbelief of one great Japanese sinologue, Naitō</p>
<p>Konan (1866–1934), in the 1920s when he witnessed the assault by young Chinese on their own traditions. It make little or no sense to him and left him highly frustrated. See Fogel, <em>Politics and Sinology</em>, pp. 239–51.</p>

<p>Overseas Chinese have experienced a similar lag, and manifested a similar response, toward the Nanking Atrocity.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>The Fourth Generation on the Chinese Mainland</strong></p>
<p>A new generation in the PRC has also begun to decry Japanese wartime behavior. Its members did not actually experience Japanese aggression in the 1930s and 1940s. Moreover, they are too young to have lived through the Communist victory over Chiang Kai-shek and the KMT in 1949, or to have suffered through the various Communist campaigns of suppression that culminated in the Cultural Revolution. In their mid- to late-thirties now, they grew up within the Communist regime and under its education system, so they acquired an accurate appreciation of their own historical culture with great difficulty, if at all. Unlike their immediate forebears, these young people no longer ascribe China’s many pre-1949 defeats to the weaknesses or failings of pre-Communist regimes, such as the Ch’ing, the warlords, or the KMT. Nor are they content to focus on China’s wartime resistance to Japan as a source of national identity and pride. Instead, they want to focus on China’s victimization at the hands of foreigners.12</p>
<p>In one sense the views of this Fourth Generation ( <em>ti-ssu-tai-jen</em>) match those of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) regime, although these thirty-somethings are not all CCP hacks. They claim that China suffered exploitation in the past because it was weak, so its first national priority is to strengthen itself vis-à-vis Japan and the West. Among many publications, they have authored two best-selling books that exude nationalism and unvarnished antiforeignism— <em>Chung-kuo k’o-shuo pu</em> (China Can Say No) and its sequel, *Chung-11  Novick, “Holocaust Memory in America,” pp. 159–65, citation on p. 163. One line of analysis that Novick docs not pursue is the role of the sharp decline in the popularity of Marxism and other leftist causes, together later with the collapse of the socialist states in Eastern Europe. Many Jews had invested their energies in socialist and other causes of social justice as a kind of secular religion, only to find either their non-Jewish fellows unsympathetic to the cause of Israel or their movement dissolve from within. Witness, for instance, the prominence of Jewish intellectuals among the “new-conservatives,” virtually all of whom had been liberals or leftists prior to their “conversions” in the 1970s and 1980s. *

12  See Gries, “Face Nationalism.”</p>
<p>The Nanking Atrocity And Chinese Historical Memory 165</p>
<p>kuo hai-shih neng shuo pu (China Can Still Say No). Because these youths have suffered none of the hardships that their grandparents and parents did—and some have expressed a perverse envy of their elders in this regard—they also have no historical experience from which to form a meaningful identity. So, they vociferously strive to assert China’s deserved but unrecognized international greatness. This entails an embittered assault on anyone who prevented China from assuming its due glory, and Japan is the preeminent culprit in their eyes.</p>
<p>In sum, members of this generation have championed China’s status as a victim in order to compensate for the very insecurity produced by their lack of anything substantive on which to build an identity. As the China scholar Peter Gries argues, its members’ sense of victimization has but two aims: “quantify-ing the pain and presenting the Chinese case to the world.”13 Thus, their writings about the war do not focus on China’s heroic resistance to and ultimate victory over Japan, but rather on the horrific losses incurred—with unusually inflated statistics. Thus they all cite a figure of at least 300,000 Chinese deaths in the Nanking Atrocity, the figure engraved in stone on the memorial in that city. This effort to gain the moral high ground is geared to silence anyone who disagrees, for the number of victims is simply not open to debate, except for upward revision. Anyone who disagrees is attacked or shouted down in public venues. Japanese professor Hata Ikuhiko, who has written extensively about the Atrocity for many years, concludes that 40,000-plus Chinese died in Nanking aside from prisoners of war (POWs). But he was shouted down by the largely Chinese and Chinese-American audience when he tried to present his views at an international conference at Princeton University in 1997. Similarly, the late Iris Chang, who was of the same generation, based her plea for international recognition of the Atrocity on what she presents as irrefutable numbers.</p>
<p>She pointed out in an interview on American television—repeated in a San Francisco Chronicle interview—that the figure of 300,000 victims surpasses the combined death toll in the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombings.14 Her implicit aim here is to establish a hierarchy of victimhood with China on top, especially because most Westerners cringe before the number of civilian lives lost in nuclear attacks on those Japanese cities. But why not compare the death toll at Nanking with those of Stalingrad or Leningrad, where even more civilians were killed? The same moral hierarchy simply does not hold for Chang.</p>
<p>The Fourth Generation rankles at yet another thought. The Japanese—who received their higher culture from China for centuries before victimizing China in the war—today enjoy great economic and political stature in the world, and 13  Ibid, p. 21.</p>

<p>166</p>
<p>The Nanking Atrocity and Chinese Historical Memory</p>
<p>many profit handsomely by investing in China’s burgeoning economy. That has often led these Chinese thirty-somethings to criticize their own government.</p>
<p>In their newfound nationalism, they find it galling that China depends on Japanese investment or aid, and they express their ire by constantly appealing to the memory of Chinese victimization. Their anger is, however, not directly solely at Japan, but at the entire world—and especially at the United States. As was true with Chang, members of China’s younger generation do not work just to vilify Japan; they seek to marshal world opinion against it. That, first and foremost, means targeting the United States—Japan’s number one trading partner and political ally in Asia. Young Chinese are trying to pressure Americans to make the Japan issue a complete mea culpa—a supreme apology for the war outdoing all previous ones, which they regard as insufficiently prostrate—and also to pay compensation for the war. That the American people and government apparently refuse to play this role angers them further.</p>
<hr>
<p>**Genocide? A Forgotten Holocaust? **</p>
<p>The Fourth Generation in China focuses attention on numbers and victimization, but its members are still too removed from Western discourse to frame their critique in terms of the Holocaust. This is not true of Chang, Wu Tien-wei (who founded the anti-Japanese journal, Jih-pen ch’in-Hua yen-chiu, and is an emeritus professor at Southern Illinois University), and other ethnic Chinese living in the West. The subtitle of Chang’s book is The Forgotten Holocaust of World War II, and she insists that what transpired at Nanking was worse than the Holocaust of European Jewry. Wu has put forward the even more hyper-bolic claim that what transpired in Nanking makes “the Auschwitz gas chambers appear humane.”15 It is surely safe to say that these lines are largely for shock value. Chang’s claim remains grossly unproven in her book. Wu’s is not only profoundly insensitive, and even vulgar; it is wholly unnecessary to his point. In any event, these two should not overly detain us.</p>
<p>At the discursive level, the term the Holocaust came to be used for the Judeicide some time in the early 1960s. Among many other things, it was a way of specially honoring those who perished in what many agreed was the worst mass murder in history. But, sadly, those on the left and right alike have frequently abused the term to advance their own agendas.16 By the same token, many ethnic groups have seized on the term since the 1960s to honor their own people who fell victim in large numbers to some great man-made calamity.</p>

<p>16  See Marrus’s excellent piece, “Is There a New Anti-Semitism,” pp. 172–74 and p. 177.</p>
<p>The Nanking Atrocity And Chinese Historical Memory 167</p>
<p>Each group’s aim has been to bring its suffering to world attention, to garner the universal sympathy that this term elicits, to set its misfortune at a level beyond criticism, and thus to accord itself sacrosanct status. Hence there are Armenian, Roma and Sinti (Gypsy), African-American, Ukrainian, Cambodian, and Native-American holocausts. Finally, we now have a Chinese holocaust.</p>
<p>The Jewish Holocaust shows that such victimhood can serve to shield one’s group against all manner of criticism and strike shame and embarrassment in the hearts of governments. Of all modern genocides, only the Judeicide seems to have acquired this venerated, inviolable status. A few people still deny the existence of gas chambers at Auschwitz and other aspects of the Holocaust, but they are generally treated as pariahs. In stark contrast, it is possible to deny other genocides and not be so stigmatized. One can, for example, belittle or downplay the Turkish massacres, as the Turkish government itself regularly does, and go on with life more or less uninterrupted. The wartime and continuing suffering of the Roma and Sinti (the Gypsies) are regularly ignored or determinedly relegated to a secondary position. The right-wing critic Dinesh D’Souza recently went out of his way to tease positive side-effects out of the long history of African-American slavery. And, as the historian David Stannard has recently noted, scholars of the left, right, and center have all noted pointedly that eradicating the Native American way of life ultimately benefited surviving New World Indians.17 Appreciation of the Nanking Atrocity lies somewhere amid these other “holocausts.” Some in Japan deny it, including some academics and the occasional politician. But unlike Turkey, the Japanese government has acknowledged the Atrocity, and Japanese scholars are the world’s most active and productive in researching it. Chinese and Chinese-Americans—like Armenians and other ethnic groups elsewhere—would like to see their particular tragedy elevated to sacrosanct status; then, only fringe elements could reject or disparage its veracity.</p>
<p>Nor is the idea of a “forgotten” holocaust original to Chang and others like her. Angus Frazer used it in his 1992 work, The Gypsies, referring of course to the Nazi genocide against them. He had borrowed the term from the French scholar Christian Bernadac, who authored a 1979 book entitled L’Holocaust</p>

<p>The Nanking Atrocity and Chinese Historical Memory</p>
<p>Oublié: Le Massacre des Tsiganes.  There is a 1986 book by R.C. Lukas entitled, Forgotten Holocaust: The Poles under German Occupation, 1939–1944.  In an important 1981 study, Genocide: Its Political Use in the Twentieth Century,   Leo Kuper called the Turkish mass murders of Armenians the “forgotten genocide of the twentieth century.” R.J. Rummel cataloged the great mass murders of the twentieth century in a 1994 article, “Democide in Totalitarian States: Mortacracies and Megamurderers.” Referring to those killed by the Japanese in World War II, he wrote, “This is surely the forgotten democide”—“democide”</p>
<p>being a neologism that he coined to mean the government-sponsored murder of persons of a specific group.18 Finally, there is a 1999 article entitled, “The Circassians: A Forgotten Genocide.” Thus, using the word “forgotten” as a modifier has a history of its own, and it usually constitutes efforts by the author to shock readers into altering long-held assumptions.</p>
<p>What needs to be asked, however, is this: does it help to assess the Nanking Atrocity by the standards of comparative genocide and Holocaust research?</p>
<p>Can we better understand this event by placing it alongside other mind-boggling massacres? I previously resisted comparisons of this sort. But, on reflection, I have concluded that they need nor establish a hierarchy of pain, nor need they detract from the uniqueness of a particular event. Every act of genocide and mass murder is unique, and none implies exclusivity; thus</p>
<p>“distinctiveness” is a better word in this context. No group has monopolized suffering unto itself, and its rhetoric is offensive only when it flaunts its victimhood to denigrate the sufferings of other groups. Based on the intent of the murderers, the number or percentage of the target population killed, the circumstances of the killings, and other criteria, scholars have made compelling cases to deem mass murders of the Gypsies by the Nazis, of the Armenians by the Turks in 1915, and of the native inhabitants of North and South America by European immigrants, as being just as horrific as the Final Solution against the Jews.</p>
<p>Accepting comparison as a viable means of approaching genocide, let us take a look at criteria that scholars have devised to examine it. Raphael Lemkin coined the term genocide in 1933, and explained it eleven years later as</p>
<p>“the destruction of a nation or an ethnic group. This new word, coined by the author to denote an old practice in its modern development, is made from the ancient Greek genos (race, tribe) and the Latin cide (killing), thus corresponding in its formation to such words as tyrannicide, homicide, infanticide, etc.”19</p>
<p>Fifteen years later, in 1948, the newly formed United Nations passed its famous Convention on Genocide that generally followed Lemkin’s definition. He offers 18  Kuper, Genocide, p. 105; Rummel, “Democide in Totalitarian States,” p. 34.</p>

<p>a succinct conceptual framework, but no guidelines on the size or scale that a mass murder must reach before it is “genocidal.” In that vein, the social scientist Henry R. Huttenbach wrote: “How do we prevent ourselves from moving glibly from Auschwitz to Hiroshima and back, from the Death Camps to the Gulag, from genuine genocide to non-genocide, from lumping victims of bona fide extermination together with victims of massacres?”20 Not all acts of mass murder are genocidal, and not all genocides may be placed on a plain with the Holocaust. Historian Michael R. Marrus has made perhaps the best argument for distinguishing the Holocaust from other larger-scale mass murders in the simple, terrible fact that the Nazis targeted for murder each and every Jew throughout the world.21 Huttenbach offers his own succinct and useful definition: “[G]enocide is the destruction of a specific group within a national or even international population. The precise character of the group need not be spelled out.” To see if an act deserves to be called genocidal, he suggests one key condition; we must ask, “Is this an act that puts the very existence of a group in jeopardy?”—and not just a case of extreme hardship or large-scale killings.22</p>
<p>There is no single process to genocide. Often it involves sadistic, crude methods of mass execution—despite a ready supply of ammunition—as a means of further terrorizing a subject population. In the 1975–76 Lebanese civil war, for example, sexual mutilation (often committed by well educated, otherwise rational men) was commonly performed by all levels of society, together with vicious acts of rape, desecration, torture, and murder. Whether this rose to a level commensurate with genocide remains to be proven, however. At other times, murders are committed more discretely, out of public view, and often in a way that separates the instigators of mass death from the actually killers. The Holocaust did not immediately become what we now know it as—the rou-tinized mass murder by efficient means through industrialized, regularized, bureaucratically legitimated techniques. Before Kristallnacht in November 1938, the Nazis relied on the pogrom model. And, ultimately about one-third, or fully two million, of the Jews were slain by the Einsatzgruppen,   mobile killing units set loose into Eastern Europe early in the war, aided by local collaborators such as the Romanian volunteers.23 It was not until the Nazis established death camps, primarily in Poland in the early 1940s, that the Holocaust took on its most technologically advanced form—insulating the killers from the acts of killing, and making the victims invisible through ever more sophisticated 20  Huttenbach, “Locating the Holocaust on the Genocide Spectrum,” p. 291.</p>

<p>weapons. This process was horrifically illustrated by the progression from the Einsatzgruppen to Zyklon B, the poison gas used to asphyxiate many thousands of victims. Zygmunt Bauman asks how it is that people who were not “moral degenerates” could commit mass murder on the scale of the Holocaust. And, he responds, the Holocaust shows that many never even faced moral choices:</p>
<p>“moral aspects of actions are not immediately obvious or are deliberately prevented from discovery. . . . In other words, the moral character of action is either invisible or purposefully concealed.”24</p>
<p>What form of violence did the Japanese military use at Nanking in 1937–38?</p>
<p>In this instance, the murderers acted as if engaged in a continuous, bestial pogrom. There was some regularity to the killings, but there was no preconceived master plan of mass murder; and the perpetrators were castigated for their brutality and lack of discipline by their own commander, Matsui Iwane, when he arrived on the scene at Nanking. Most of the perpetrators were impoverished men who had led exceedingly hard lives up to conscription and the war. Moreover, their experiences in the military and on campaigns—</p>
<p>particularly the battle of Shanghai before arriving in Nanking—were extremely harsh. They were not even supposed to have attacked Nanking, but were driven on by overzealous superior officers. They were not the refined, well-educated mass murderers who peopled the Gestapo or served as death-camp comman-dants, although some Japanese were not unlike many death- and concentration-camp guards or even some of the Einsatzgruppen.  Whereas the Holocaust of European Jewry featured rational plans of murder en masse with bureaucratic regularity, the Nanking Atrocity can be more accurately described as a scene of mass murder run viciously amok.</p>
<p>Was there an ideology comparable to anti-Semitism or anti-Gypsy sentiment behind the Japanese war machine in China? Was there a pervasive ideology that so denigrated China or demonized the Chinese that it could legitimate or pave the way for mass murder—another trait found in genocide?</p>
<p>There was certainly a widespread feeling that the Chinese were a weak and chaotic people incapable of running their own country and in need of urgent help. But there was nothing comparable to an ideology for sustaining mass murder, and there was most assuredly nothing comparable to the Nazi slogan that the Jews and Gypsies were “lives not worth living.” In the Japanese treatment of China under occupation, there was not even anything comparable to the discriminatory Nuremberg Laws or the social isolation in ghettos that subsequently necessitated, in the diseased minds of Nazis, physical segregation of Jews and Gypsies into concentration- and death-camps. The Chinese were pitied or patronizingly looked down on, but they were never demeaned to a point 24  Bauman, Modernity and the Holocaust pp. 24–26, 74, and 89–90.</p>
<p>The Nanking Atrocity And Chinese Historical Memory 171</p>
<p>justifying wholesale murder. Of course, in all wartime situations the enemy has to be deemed worthy of death—if only to motivate the troops—especially in cases of foreign aggression or total war. However, there was no Japanese plan to annihilate every Chinese man, woman, and child, as there was for the Jews following the Wannsee Conference of early 1942 in Nazi Germany. Nor was there the well-crafted plan of murder earlier in the twentieth century with respect to Armenians in Turkey. Even among the most retrograde, unattractive elements of the extreme Japanese right-wing and militarist cliques, one would be hard-pressed to locate such sentiments, let alone point to these as an overriding ideology in the 1930s and 1940s.</p>
<p>The only framework in Japan approaching an ideology behind the Nanking Atrocity was that of the emperor state which, from the 1930s, effectively deemed anyone who defied the imperial institution as unfit to live. This might be marshaled as a possible rallying call for Japanese troops in the field to attack Chinese who resisted, but it was by no means directed solely at China and the Chinese. Indeed, it applied with equal ferocity to Japanese Communists, which is one reason that so many of them underwent tenkô or a sudden reorientation of their views to abandon leftism and embrace the emperor system, usually while in jail or in anticipation of being arrested. Racism or ethnic hatred, understood in the broadest sense, was an essential component of the Holocaust and many acts of genocide—against New World Indians, Gypsies, Armenians, various peoples in Africa, and Ukrainian peasants. But it does not appear in any major way in Japanese constructions of China and the Chinese.</p>
<p>In fact, one feature of late-nineteenth and twentieth century East Asian history has been a collapsing of the Chinese and Japanese into a “yellow race” to combat the white race. It is true that this notion may have been used to mask Japanese desires to “guide” the Chinese in a particular direction, or to “chastise”</p>
<p>them for failing to go along, but it reflected a certain ideological solidarity vis-à-vis the West.</p>
<p>Moving from the level of an ideology constructed on the putative basis of a shared racial identity to visceral racism, did the latter play a significant part in Japanese formulations or views of the Chinese? Can we detect a visceral Japanese hatred of the Chinese as a people because of who they were? There was certainly much belittling of the Chinese in Japan at the time. But what enraged Japanese soldiers en route to and in Nanking in 1937–38 and what drove them to acts of mass murder had nothing to do with presumed Chinese weaknesses or endemic failings. Quite to the contrary, Japanese soldiers were stunned and out for revenge precisely because of the unexpected strength and perseverance of the Chinese they had confronted in the battle of Shanghai months earlier. This battle was of horrific proportions, second at the time only to the battle of Verdun in terms of overall numbers killed, in which many</p>
<p>172</p>
<p>The Nanking Atrocity and Chinese Historical Memory</p>
<p>Japanese lost comrades. As one Japanese foot soldier later recalled in an interview with the famed journalist Honda Katsuichi: “[T]he assault on Nanjing cook place as an extension of this fighting [in and around Shanghai]. It just wasn’t the kind of atmosphere in which you’d immediately forgive and release your prisoners, merely because they had surrendered to you. The mood was one of avenging your dead comrades.”25</p>
<p>Fourth Generation Chinese argue char racism—by which they mean the Japanese troops’ dehumanization of the Chinese people—was indeed an essential part of the assault on China. The piece of evidence usually cited is the infamous 100-man killing contest, in which two Japanese soldiers allegedly vied to see who could first slay 100 Chinese en route to Nanking. Many have questioned the veracity of this story, and not only arch right-wingers in Japan. See Bob Tadashi Wakabayashi’s chapter 6 in the present volume. But the Japanese press in November–December 1937 did give the story considerable play, the soldiers did receive death sentences at the postwar Nanking War Crimes Tribunal; so, as a result, anti-Japanese Chinese believe the story today.</p>
<p>But despite the guilty verdict, to accept this story as true and accurate requires a leap of faith that no balanced historian can make.26 If we interpret the story on another level, as symptomatic of the callous way in which Japanese troops acted on the way to Nanking, then we can conclude that dehumanization was elemental to their experience. But this is still not racism. And, when Fourth Generation members go even further, to that claim the slaughter in and around Nanking was not only deliberate but ordered by the emperor, they stray far from the historical record in an effort to find evidence for Japanese victimization of China. What is more, they often push this history of victimization back to the early Meiji era.</p>
<p>For obvious reasons, genocides usually occur where the targeted group is in a minority. This is not to say that the murderers necessarily are the majority, but the murdered are usually a minority, often in times of war or military occupation. Thus the Jews and Gypsies were usually in the minority, even if the Nazis were not the majority in Poland, Lithuania, and elsewhere in eastern and central Europe. Similarly, Armenians living on Turkish terrain were a minority. One exception to this generalization might be native peoples of the New World who were enslaved and murdered by smaller groups of white settlers. In 1937–38, by contrast, the Chinese were the overwhelmingly great majority at Nanking, although they had been abandoned by their army. If we follow Henry R. Huttenbach’s definition of genocide as an act that “puts the very existence of a group in jeopardy,” Japanese actions in China fall far short, if only because the 25  Honda, Nanjing Massacre, p. 240.</p>
<p>26  Also see Wakabayashi, “The Nanking 100-Man Killing Contest Debate,” pp. 307–40.</p>
<p>The Nanking Atrocity And Chinese Historical Memory 173</p>
<p>Chinese population was so huge. Frequently the perpetrators of genocide use other ethnic groups to commit murder by proxy. Thus, the Nazis used apparently willing Ukrainians and other collaborators as guards in many of the death camps. In fact, the Nazis’ ability to separate themselves from the killing went so far as to get Jewish complicity through the Sonderkommandos and through various Jewish ghetto councils ( Judenrätter).27 Although there were Chinese collaborators, similar actions did not take place at Nanking; instead, Japanese military personnel did all the killing.</p>
<p>“Modern genocide is genocide with a purpose,”  notes Zygmunt Bauman. “The end itself is a grand vision of a better and radically different society.”  Because the victim group does not fit into this vision, it must by weeded our. Inasmuch as the modern bureaucracy has no moral component, but is solely directed at increased efficiency, it was the ideal instrument to orchestrate an efficient</p>
<p>“gardening”—as much for Stalin and others as for Hitler.28 Again, this was not true for the Nanking Atrocity. An overarching purpose was missing. There was nothing political, military, ideological, or economic to be gained by committing this mass murder. And, there were no concentration- or death-camps, no elaborate system to distance the killers from the killing, and no bureaucratic organization for it except of the most primitive ad hoc sort. The Rwandan and Cambodian “genocides” of recent years also lacked the bureaucratic efficiency of the Holocaust. There was a vision of a “radically different society” in the case of Cambodia, but the torture and killing lacked the Nazi death machine’s bureaucratic efficiency, even if the numbers of victims was ultimately quite high. Again, this in no way minimizes the suffering of Cambodians in the 1970s or other groups; it just distinguishes the organization of mass murder in different instances.</p>
<p>In sum, this rudimentary typology shows that the Nanking Atrocity was never an end in itself. Rather, it was an instance of impromptu, large-scale, mass murder perpetrated in the context of Japan’s brutal war of aggression against the Chinese and other peoples in East and Southeast Asia. Thus the Atrocity in some respects resembles other events in Africa, Cambodia, and the New World that have acquired the label “genocidal.” However, it fell far short both in numerical count and percentage of population slain, and it lacked the ideological impetus and bureaucratic efficiency that spurred on many of these other genocides. The Atrocity, then, was altogether different from the Shoah, the Porrajmos, or the Armenian experience in Turkey during World War I.</p>
<p>I would ultimately have to agree with Justice Radhabinod Pal, the Indian judge 27  Bauman, Modernity and the Holocaust, pp. 22–23, with obvious nods in the direction of Hannah Arendt.</p>

<p>at the Tokyo War Crimes Trials, who noted: “[T]he case of the present accused before us cannot in any way be likened to the case . . . of Hitler.”29 Chief Justice William Webb effectively concurred: “[T]he crimes of the Germans accused were far more heinous, varied and extensive than those of the Japanese accused.” This diminished assessment in no way slights the suffering of victims at Nanking; nor does it make the Atrocity less heinous. It merely is an attempt to understand these great human tragedies in a comparative perspective.</p>
<p>Chinese victims have a serious case to make, but using the word “Holocaust”</p>
<p>does not help us understand the Nanking Atrocity, nor does it shed light on genocides more generally. It has been more my task to examine the specific contexts in which claims of genocide have been made than to tally numbers or compare victimhood. Why did the issue seem less important to the Chinese in the 1940s and 1950s than it has become since the 1990s? This question involves the complex role of memory in identity formation. To be sure, the Nanking Atrocity deserves our solemn acknowledgment, not only so that the world will not forget, and not only because we need to affirm unequivocally that a great massacre was perpetrated against the Chinese people, which a handful of fringe elements in Japan continues to whitewash. Having said that, past injustices committed against a people do not license them and their descendants to denigrate others. Victimhood does not confer sainthood.</p>

<p><strong>Context, Memory, and Identity</strong></p>
<p>In this chapter, I have tried to demonstrate the importance of context in the ways that people perceive a historical event to form national or ethnic identities. Context is intricately tied to memory (constructed or otherwise), and shared memory is essential to identity. In this respect, China and Japan have been crucial to each other for many centuries. China was fundamental to the development of Japanese identity from at least the sixth century onward, and Japan has been crucial to China’s since the end of the nineteenth century. In the First Sino-Japanese War, or Meiji-Ch’ing War, of 1894–95—a war fought when this turnabout began—the Japanese military committed horrific atrocities against Chinese civilians. The Chinese scholar-official Cheng Kuan-ying briefly catalogued these at the time, although he seems to have been recounting events listed in the foreign press rather than personally witnessed: When the Japanese occupied Lüshun, the entire town was massacred.</p>
<p>Pregnant women in Hai-ch’eng were cut open. . . . When Niu-chuang was 29  Cited in Dower, Embracing Defeat, p. 459.</p>
<p>The Nanking Atrocity And Chinese Historical Memory 175</p>
<p>occupied, . . . our women were tied up and raped. Even innocent children could not escape. Japanese soldiers stabbed their bayonets into the children’s anuses and then held up the body on their bayonets for fun. . . . When Japanese ships passed Teng-chou, they opened fire on villagers for no reason, and the homes of ordinary people were destroyed. . . .</p>
<p>When they attacked Jung-ch’eng, they also opened fire everywhere, even at the houses of residents. People lost their homes and had to sleep out-doors in the fields. At that time, it was snowing heavily, and many died from cold and hunger. . . . It was so miserable and vicious that even the sky and sun would sigh. Oh, how brutal it was!30</p>
<p>Why have these nineteenth-century atrocities been buried in historical oblivion whereas those of Nanking in 1937–38 continue to be cited routinely? The principal reason lies precisely in the issue of context. World War II is crucially important to those who make the case for a “Nanking Holocaust” because of guilt by association impugned to Japan which, after all, later became allied to Nazi Germany. For the historical record, a formal military alliance—as opposed to the Anti-Comintern Pact—was not formed until September 1940, well after the mass murders at Nanking took place. But this has not stopped the likes of Iris Chang, Wu Tien-wei, and others from claiming that imperial Japan and the Third Reich were full-fledged allies in 1937. Indeed, John Rabe’s inveigh-ing against what he witnessed—which, to her credit, Chang has brought to our attention—is transformed in a newspaper interview to: “So sickening was the spectacle that even the Nazis in the city   were horrified.”31 This statement is a bit of a stretch. Chang and Wu link Japan with perhaps the worst murder-ous regime in our time, not just because of the subsequent alliance with Nazi Germany, but also because we have come to regard the European Holocaust as the most horrific act of genocide in recent human history.</p>
<p>The current outrage over events committed in Nanking seventy years ago is not directed at Japan alone, however. Sino-Japanese relations have taken on a new character since World War II. Globalization plus increased Chinese exposure and emigration to the West, especially over the past two or three decades, require that the entire world—which often means the West or, more specifically, the United States—verify China’s victimhood. Chang, for example, was less interested in changing Japanese opinions—about which she knew next to nothing in any case—than in bringing the Atrocity to American attention. This is another reason for her to tally the death toll in Nanking higher than those for 30  Cheng, “Chung-Jih chiao-chan hsi-wen-pao chi Jih-ping t’u-ch’eng ts’an-k’u t’u-shou hsü,”</p>

<p>the two Japanese cities targeted by U.S. atomic bombs. Thus, like the younger generation in China, persons such as Chang are working—and successfully, it should be noted—to marshal the Western media against Japan. This has sadly become central to their identities.</p>
<p>The philosopher Avishai Margalit notes Sigmund Freud’s description of a</p>
<p>“neurotic person’s disproportionate actions.” Freud referred to a Londoner who, looking at a monument to the great fire of 1666, mourned aloud the destruction of three centuries earlier rather than feel joy or relief about the city’s resilience.32 A parallel neurosis of remembering plagues Chinese-American and Chinese groups discussed above. The journalist Ian Buruma recently recounted reading a piece by Iris Chang in which she told of an incident that followed a lecture she had given about the Nanking Atrocity. A Chinese-American woman came forward with tears in her eyes and said to Chang, “You make me proud to be Chinese.” One would think that 5000 years of a resplendent world culture might suffice.</p>
