  <p>Western scholarship on East Asia has taken note of the Japanese group voyage to the United States in 1860, most prominently in Masao Miyoshi’s study of that mission, to officially ratify the treaty imposed upon their country by Townsend Harris (1804–78) and the government of the United States.1 Considerably less well known are the Japanese missions to Shanghai of 1862 and 1864, both domestically inspired and both frank admissions in their respective forms that there was a brave new world out there confronting Japan, that Commodore Perry (1794–1863), Townsend Harris, and the United States were only the beginning of an imperialist onslaught, and that as a result Japan had to take a more activist role in its own future by going out to examine the outside world. The future belonged to international trade and diplomacy, and, in a metaphor of a few years later, Japan could join the table at dinner or be served up with the main course.2</p>
<p>On the Chinese side of things, before the 1880s we know next to nothing of how the Qing government looked upon Japan, soon to become its most important neighbor in every respect. Modern Sino-Japanese relations do not begin with the many thousands of Chinese students flocking to Japanese institutions of higher learning, as significant as that event will be later in the century. Modern Sino-Japanese relations truly commence with voyage of the <em>Senzaimaru</em> from Nagasaki to Shanghai in 1862. The nature of the relationship the Japanese so tentatively sought at the time reads like a blueprint in microcosm for the negotiations that ensued over the next three decades, before war and aggression replaced peaceful diplomacy as the dominant mode of operations.</p>

<p>A Decisive Turning Point in Sino-Japanese Relations</p>
<p>I have written on a number of occasions about the 1862 mission of the <em>Senzaimaru</em> (and the 1864 mission of the <em>Kenjunmaru</em>).3 * * Until several years ago, however, scholars of this topic were operating in the absence of documentation on the Chinese side. We had a good number of travel narratives from the Japanese aboard the <em>Senzaimaru</em> and a fair number of studies,4 some of them excellent, but nothing seemed to have remained extant on the Chinese side. That meant nothing from the Shanghai <em>daotai</em> (circuit intendant), Wu Xu (1809–72), with whom the Japanese met twice, and nothing from the many Chinese with whom they interacted in Shanghai; it also meant nothing about how the Chinese reacted to the case made by the Japanese government for trade.</p>
<p>The strangeness is only compounded by the fact that mention of the circumstances surrounding the arrival of the <em>Senzaimaru</em> is made in several prominent Chinese sources. In his <em>Dongfang bingshi jilüe</em> (Summary of military events in the East), Yao Xiguang (b. 1856) noted the visit of a group of Japanese officials to Shanghai, their request of the Dutch vice-consul for assistance in trade, “because Japan had no trading relations with China,” and their meeting with the <em>daotai</em> of Shanghai, Wu Xu.5 Later, the <em>Qing shi gao</em> (Draft history of the Qing dynasty) noted clearly: “In the first year of the Tongzhi reign [1862], the Nagasaki Magistrate sent men to Shanghai to ask if they might establish a consulate [there] to handle the commercial and customs affairs of their country. The Superintendent for Trade Xue Huan would not allow it.”6 If news of their arrival, their meeting with Wu Xu, and their requests for a consulate and the like reached such a highly-placed official as Xue Huan (1815–80), they had 3  Fogel, <em>The Literature of Travel in the Japanese Rediscovery of China, 1862–1945</em>, chapter 2; Fogel,</p>

<p>4  Among the better works are two recent book-length studies of the <em>Senzaimaru</em> voyage: Miyanaga, <em>Takasugi Shinsaku no Shanhai repotto</em> (Takasugi Shinsaku’s report on Shanghai); Feng Tianyu, “<em>Qiansuiwan” Shanghai xing</em> (The <em>Senzaimaru’s</em> trip to Shanghai). The best work, to my mind, on the 1862 mission has been done by Haruna Akira. See, among many studies: Haruna Akira, “Sen happyaku rokujū ninen bakufu Senzaimaru no Shanhai haken”</p>
<p>(The shogunate’s sending of the <em>Senzaimaru</em> to Shanghai in 1862); “Nakamuda Kuranosuke no Shanhai taiken” (Nakamuda Kuranosuke’s experiences in Shanghai); and “Mine Kiyoshi no Shanhai keiken” (Mine Kiyoshi’s experiences in Shanghai).</p>

<p>to have been transmitted by local officials in Shanghai through channels to Beijing. What raw materials did the authors of these and similar works have to work from? We had not so much as a hint.</p>
<p>Then, from the archives of the Zongli Yamen, the first Chinese foreign office, which are now located on the grounds of Academia Sinica in Taibei, a set of documents relating to the voyages of the <em>Senzaimaru</em> as well as the <em>Kenjunmaru</em> were discovered in 2001 by a Japanese scholar. These documents consist of extensive intra-bureaucratic memoranda about how the Chinese authorities at their various levels from the Zongli Yamen in Beijing down to the <em>daotai</em> in Shanghai should respond to the Japanese requests to trade at the port at Shanghai, to rent a house and open a consulate there, to handle their own customs procedures, and the like. And, far from the indifference on the Chinese part with respect to the Japanese that one might have been led to believe the absence of such documents implied, the Chinese were deeply concerned about how to handle these newcomers and what interacting with them portended.7 The discovery of these documents should serve as a sobering warning never to assume that the absence of information at hand is synonymous with its non-existence.</p>
<p>In what follows, I offer a close reading of these new materials regarding the <em>Senzaimaru</em> and attempt to relate what we can learn from this material about Japanese intentions and the Qing officialdom’s response. Why were they embarking on this 1862 mission? How did they expect to finagle the intrica-cies of trading with a country with whom they shared no diplomatic relations?</p>
<p>How are other states and players portrayed in these documents? And, how did the Chinese perceive these uninvited visitors? In other words, into what framework of understanding were these newfound documents to be placed?</p>
<p>It was clear to the shogunal officials in charge of foreign relations in Nagasaki that international trade was the future. Foreign vessels carrying Japanese goods to China and Chinese goods back to Nagasaki and elsewhere in Japan had made their owners wealthy in the years leading up to 1862.8 When it came time for Japan to venture out on its own into the wider world, it made more sense in the view of the Nagasaki Magistrate’s office to send a mission to Shanghai.</p>
<p>There in Shanghai, one could gain a sense in microcosmic form of the entire 7  These documents were announced in a number of scholarly sources and translated into Japanese with a brief introduction by Huang Rongguang, “Bakumatsu Senzaimaru Kenjunmaru no Shanhai haken ra ni kansuru Shinkoku gaikō monjo ni tsuite” (Qing diplomatic documents concerning the dispatch to Shanghai of the <em>Senzaimaru</em> and <em>Kenjunmaru</em> in the late Edo period). The Chinese originals have as yet not been published.</p>

<p>wider world without going to North America and Europe; one could meet as many representatives of the Western powers as one wished and see how they behaved in an East Asian venue. Just as Japan would later in the century provide a panoply of sources by and about the West already digested and prepared for Chinese use in Japanese translations, so Shanghai provided a similar commercial service for the Japanese at this juncture a generation earlier.</p>
<p>While sailing a ship to the United States and Western Europe was clearly beyond the capacities of all Japanese in 1862, especially given that the Tokugawa government’s interdiction of foreign travel remained in force, even sailing the relatively short distance to Shanghai was still apparently too daunting a venture. Various plans were raised, such as renting a Dutch ship, but they all proved too expensive to persuade the shogunate. Ultimately, a British commercial vessel, the <em>Armistice</em>, * * was purchased from its owner, Henry Richardson, who had for the previous two and one-half years been transporting goods between Nagasaki and Chinese ports.9 The shogunate promptly renamed it the *Senzaimaru * but realized, as noted, that no one in Japan was prepared to sail such a large ship on the open ocean. They therefore hired Richardson and his British crew back to sail it for them.</p>
<p>Although, as we learn from the Chinese correspondence about the <em>Senzaimaru</em>, Chinese ships had been sailing to Nagasaki to trade in precious metals for some time, the Japanese still had no formal diplomatic ties with the government of the Qing dynasty. Through contacts with the Dutch firm of Theodorus Kroes (1822–89), who was also then the vice-consul of the Netherlands and Belgium in Shanghai, the Japanese vessel was allowed to enter the port of Shanghai, dock by the Dutch consulate on the Huangpu River, and store their goods in Dutch warehouses. We have no hard evidence as to why they picked Kroes’s firm, but it can easily be surmised that the Japanese contacted fellow Dutchmen in Nagasaki—where the Dutch for over two centuries had been the only Europeans allowed to trade and reside—for contacts in Shanghai and were put in touch with a businessman who happened also to be the vice-consul there; Kroes was also the representative of the Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij (Netherlands Trading Company) in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Soon after their arrival on June 2, Kroes escorted the eight Japanese officials from among the fifty-one Japanese aboard the <em>Senzaimaru</em> to meet the Shanghai (or Susong) <em>daotai</em>, * * Wu Xu, the most powerful local official, whose responsibilities covered all commerce in this port as well as customs and who had been on duty in Shanghai since 1859. We now know what transpired at the 9  See the daily <em>Lloyd’s List</em> for those * * years, microfiche held in the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, England.</p>
<p>A Decisive Turning Point in Sino-Japanese Relations 115</p>
<p>meeting, as reflected in Wu’s report to his superior, Superintendent for Trade Xue Huan, from the latter’s own report:</p>
<p>[A.] According to a document, dated Tongzhi 1 [1862]/7/l, from Xue</p>
<p>[Huan], Superintendent for Trade, Wu Xu . . . reported as follows. “On 5/9</p>
<p>[June 5] of this year, the consul from Holland in the West, [Theodorus]</p>
<p>Kroes, escorted eight officials from Japan in the East to my office for an audience: [Their names are listed here]. They had the following to say:</p>
<p>‘The eight of us are all officials from Japan. On orders from our superiors, we have come to Shanghai with thirteen merchants from our country, 4,000–5,000 catties each of sea cucumber, shark fin, *konbu *[kelp], and abalone, as well as lacquer-ware, paper fans, and other items aboard a Dutch trading ship. By means of Dutch merchants we have gone through customs, product inspection, payment of levies, and the like. We should now like to engage in trade and seek your permission to do so in Shanghai.</p>
<p>This being our first such effort, our unfamiliarity leads us to seek your instructions.’</p>
<p>[B.] “To this day, Chinese merchants sail every year from Zhapu [a port in Zhejiang Province] overseas and return from Japan having bought Western copper ( <em>yangtong</em>), * * but merchants from Japan have yet to come to trade in China, and following regulations, I was unable to permit them to import [goods]. However, in consideration of the fact that they have now come a great distance over the sea, I could not bear to turn them down. They have transported their goods on a Dutch vessel, and they have gone through customs with [the help of] the Dutch. I have taken into consideration the court’s pleasure in cherishing men from afar, and planning for their convenience allowed them to promptly sell the items as Dutch goods. I have not, however, allowed them to purchase Chinese commodities, and I instructed them that they must speedily return home aboard the Dutch vessel with the money [gained in transactions for their goods] and not rashly to come here again. They listened and replied that they would all be happy to comply. Their attitude and language at this time were exceptionally submissive.</p>
<p>[C.] “Furthermore, Dutch Consul Kroes said: ‘For over two hundred years, the Dutch have traded with Japan, and the friendship between us has grown profound. I could not prevent the officials here from coming on the merchant vessel of the pertinent country [i.e., Holland] together with the merchants and the produce. We have gone through all of the customs procedures, and once they sell all of their goods, I guarantee that they will return home immediately without buying any Chinese goods.’</p>
<p>116</p>
<p>A Decisive Turning Point in Sino-Japanese Relations</p>
<p>[D.] “On 5/25 [June 21] I myself went to their lodgings to inspect the situation at hand. According to them, ‘Because of the chaos engendered by the Taiping Rebellion, the goods we brought on this voyage have not been easy to dispose of, and we have incurred losses. Because of the great distance covered in coming to this foreign land, we were unfamiliar with the local climate and topography, and three among our merchants have died. As soon as we have sold the remainder of our goods, we plan to return home.’</p>
<p>[E.] “My supposition is that they are about to hurry home. When I investigated further, [I learned that] recently countries of the West have been coming to Japan to engage in commerce, and that Japan brought to Shanghai all the items that it produces and put them up for sale. Of necessity, if they have numerous items, the price will go down. It is true that, with Shanghai besieged by the rebel forces, merchants could not come here and they thus had no market outlets. Thus, despite their trial effort at sailing to Shanghai to trade, the Japanese officials and merchants this time did not realize their wishes. Perhaps this will militate against their coming again. When the officials set a day for their return voyage [to Japan], they passed through customs, carried out the proper exit procedures, and were permitted to go, and in addition to making a further report, I now submit this for your instructions.”</p>
<p>[F.] I [Xue Huan] accordingly carried out an investigation and discovered that Japan is not included among the countries with which we have trading relations ( <em>tongshang</em>), * * having thus far not come to China to engage in trade directly. Furthermore, Holland is a non-treaty country ( <em>wuyueguo</em>), * * and Holland accompanied the Japanese officials and merchants when they engaged in trade. On the basis of such precedents, there is the possibility of abuses of unauthorized contracting ( <em>baolan</em>). * * In the future, I do not know if many nations will emulate this [practice of coming unannounced] and do not know how to stop it. This needs to be prevented before there are abuses [of our kindness]. I pray that this will receive your scrutiny and be implemented.10</p>
<p>I have divided this document into paragraphs, which do not exist in the original, as a means of highlighting the many important points we can draw from it; and, incidentally, this report was partially recapitulated numerous times over 10  Translated from the Japanese translation by Huang Rongguong, “Bakumatsu Senzaimaru Kenjunmaru no Shanhai haken ra ni kansuru Shinkoku gaikō monjo ni tsuite,” 180–1</p>
<p>(hereafter cited as Huang).</p>
<p>A Decisive Turning Point in Sino-Japanese Relations 117</p>
<p>the next few years as the Qing bureaucracy tried to come up with both a way to assess Japan’s true wishes and a legal-diplomatic basis upon which to allow the Japanese to trade. As a whole, this document and the others that follow offer us a completely fresh window onto Japanese and Chinese thinking about one another at the time, as we shall now see.</p>
<p>Paragraph A cites Wu Xu’s report of his initial meeting with the eight Japanese officials and their escort, Vice-Consul Kroes,11 and “quotes” their request of him.</p>
<p>They describe the goods they have brought and hope to sell in Shanghai. There were, incidentally, only three Japanese listed as “merchants.” not thirteen, on board, but this is likely just a typographical error, except that, when they later appeal to the Chinese for leniency because “three among our merchants have died” (paragraph D), there may be some purposive befuddlement—three of the original Japanese crew did die, none of them being merchants. They then proceed to the less than complete truth that they sailed aboard a Dutch vessel. No mention is made of the Japanese ownership of the *Senzaimaru * whose extraordinary arrival in Shanghai was in fact reported in the <em>North China</em> <em>Herald</em>,12 nor * * of the British crew who, to a man, simply disappear from history at this point, never to be heard from again in this connection. The least amount of investigation would have revealed the ship’s provenance—it actually sailed into port flying the three flags of Great Britain, Holland, and Japan—but the Qing authorities clearly had other concerns. Perhaps, they were referring to the small Dutch vessel used to offload the goods brought from Japan for storage in Dutch warehouses. The Japanese admit to following all proper procedures involving customs and levies, with the help of the Dutch, and would now like to be allowed to trade in Shanghai. They make it plain that they have no desire to trade anywhere but Shanghai but, in a tone of humility, profess a degree of ignorance of the proper way to proceed. The ball is thrown into the <em>daotai’s</em> lap.</p>
<p>Wu Xu reveals (paragraph B) that, despite the fact that Chinese traders have long been going to trade at the port of Nagasaki, present treaty regulations make it impossible for him to simply permit the Japanese to do as they wish.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as he was at that point the only living Chinese official to have had contact with the Japanese, the information he acquired from them about their situation seems to have disposed him to favor their requests, for he immediately begins to conjure up schemes to enable this to transpire. With the language of 11  He is consistently given in these documents as Dutch consul, but in fact it would appear that he was actually vice-consul. This is a recurrent error in many documents, irrespective of origin.</p>
<p>12 </p>
<p><em>North China Herald</em>, June 7, 1862, 1.</p>
<p>118</p>
<p>A Decisive Turning Point in Sino-Japanese Relations</p>
<p>pitying them after a long journey and “cherishing men from afar,”13 Wu appears to have concocted the plan by which their goods would be construed as Dutch (with whom the Qing had trading relations)—repeating the half-truth that the <em>Senzaimaru</em> was Dutch—to be sold in Shanghai, and then they would promise to scurry home to Japan. No one bothers to ask or volunteer information as to why a Dutch vessel would have a Japanese name (presumably painted on its side, though no extant pictures of the vessel have yet emerged). It was thus he, Wu Xu, who held immediate responsibility for allowing them to attempt to dispose of their goods, but they were forbidden from buying Chinese produce and they could not linger in Shanghai or anywhere else in China. Wu adds that the Japanese complied in a sufficiently deferential manner.</p>
<p>Vice-Consul Kroes then (paragraph C) stepped into the fray to back up all the Japanese claims, introduced by the avowal of long Dutch-Japanese contacts.</p>
<p>The import of this statement is that, although the Chinese have not had recent diplomatic ties with Japan, the Dutch certainly have, and they have learned to trust one another. Kroes also vows that he will ensure that the Japanese play by the book (well known to him by virtue of his commercial and political positions) and return home as soon as they sell their wares. We will learn later from secret communications from the Japanese to the Chinese officials that the Dutch were skimming a healthy percentage off all aspects of Japanese trading ventures on this voyage, and the Japanese—apparently unaware that using an agent was a service that did not come free of charge—were chafing under this arrangement; Kroes’s objectives are thus open to question. By the same token, the Japanese may (later) have been exaggerating their complaints to gain Chinese sympathies.</p>
<p>Paragraph D seems to fit with such a constructed discourse. Wu Xu reports on a visit to the Astor House Hotel, the most famous luxury hotel in Shanghai, at which the shogunal officials and other samurai from the <em>Senzaimaru</em> were residing—lower ranking members of the crew stayed on board ship throughout the ten weeks they spent in Shanghai. The claim of three deaths is accurate, as noted above, though one of them was a result of a measles epidemic in Nagasaki prior to their actual departure; the other two were apparent results of cholera contracted in Shanghai, and, as noted above, none of the three was a merchant.14 The Japanese convey the sense, as reported by the <em>daotai</em>, * * that 13  The title of an award-winning book: James L. Hevia, <em>Cherishing Men from Afar: Qing</em> <em>Guest Ritual and the Macartney Embassy of 1793</em>, * * which won the Levenson Prize of the Association for Asian Studies.</p>
<p>14  Many sources confirm this. See, for example, Chen Zuen, <em>Xunfang Dongyangren, jindai</em> <em>Shanghai de Riben juliumin (1868–1945)</em> (Inquiry into the “Japanese,” Japanese residents of modern Shanghai, 1868–1945), 9.</p>
<p>A Decisive Turning Point in Sino-Japanese Relations 119</p>
<p>they have had a difficult time in Shanghai, lost money on the efforts at trade because of the Taiping Rebellion, and only want to finish their business and go home. The whining tone might make the cynical reader wonder why they came in the first place—didn’t they know of the Taiping Rebellion, which had broken out twelve years earlier and was well known in educated Japanese circles?15—except that we know why they came. By the same token, we do know with a high degree of certainty that monetary gain in trade was entirely a secondary concern of this 1862 mission; much more important was observation of the rules of the game of international trade as practiced in Shanghai.16</p>
<p>Wu Xu then (paragraph E) gives his summation of the case, and he seems inordinately sympathetic to the Japanese, almost surprisingly so, even adding an argument to what he has already reported the Japanese as actually saying to him personally. He states that further inquiries indicate that everything the Japanese claimed about the commercial failures of their mission is true, and he vouches for their preparations and, indeed, their actual departure—again, following all the proper forms. This report leaves one with the impression that Wu was moved by the apparently bedraggled Japanese endeavor in coming to Shanghai unannounced, though one must admit that much of this was certainly to protect himself. He had already taken a decision to allow them to trade just this one time. In an era before e-mail and other forms of virtually instantaneous communication, Wu Xu was compelled to make decisions on the ground before he could know if they would be positively sanctioned by his superiors; should he make a decision which met with disapproval, he might have jeopardized his career, but such were the fortunes of powerful Qing officials.</p>
<p>Finally, in paragraph F we hear from the author of this memorial, Xue Huan. The few words he adds to the discussion effectively add all the important elements for the continuing diplomatic negotiations over the next few years—ultimately leading in 1871 to the first Sino-Japanese Treaty of Amity, a treaty distinguished at this time for being completely equal. Xue claims to have made his own investigation which indicates that Japan lacks the status necessary for “trading” with China. This requires a bit of elucidation. In 1862</p>
<p>and probably for some time thereafter, the Qing government had no conception of what Westerners called diplomacy or diplomatic relations. Countries with which it had potential contact were grouped into three concentric circles: 15  On Japanese knowledge of the Taipings, see Ichiko, “Bakumatsu Nihonjin no Taihei Tengoku ni kansuru chishiki” (Japanese knowledge of the Taipings in the <em>bakumatsu</em> period).</p>
<p>16  Matsumoto, “Shanhai ni okeru Nihonjin hatten no shoki” (The early years of Japanese development in Shanghai), 37.</p>
<p>120</p>
<p>A Decisive Turning Point in Sino-Japanese Relations</p>
<p>trading countries with treaties ( <em>youyue tongshang</em>), * * non-treaty trading countries ( <em>wuyue tongshang</em>), * * and non-treaty, non-trading countries ( <em>wuyue butongshang</em>), * * a system that predated the Opium War and would remain in effect through much of the nineteenth century.17 Heretofore, according to Xue, Japan was in the last category, but they clearly wanted into the second, where the Netherlands then resided. He feared that they would milk the relationship to China’s detriment, <em>baolan</em> being a morally disreputable practice excoriated by Chinese statecraft officials for centuries.18 He also feared that if China were to open its doors even a crack, there might be a flood of tiny countries like Japan attempting to jam their feet in the door, capture Chinese markets, and never leave.</p>
<p>In a memorandum sent three days later to Xue Huan from the Zongli Yamen, we find his concerns seconded by the authorities. After briefly recapitulating the situation, they make things clearer for the immediate future: “We thus strictly order the Susong <em>daotai</em> [Wu Xu] via the aforementioned minister [Xue Huan]: When merchant vessels from various lands hereafter enter port, deal with the matter appropriately on the basis of a rigorous preliminary investigation. We strictly order you not to follow the case of Japan with other countries.”19</p>
<p>In a joint memorial from Xue and Jiangsu Governor Li Hongzhang (1823–</p>
<p>1901) dated precisely one month later (8/4), we learn more about Wu Xu’s interactions with the Japanese. Within the body of a memorial, we find a piece of a subsequent report by Wu and his subsequent activity supporting his decision:</p>
<p>[G.] When their [i.e., Japanese] officials came to my office for another audience [the second of two audiences they had at the <em>daotai’s</em> office], they told me: “Two months have passed since our arrival in Shanghai, but half of our goods have not sold, and now we are putting things in order and planning to return home. As far as we have been able to investigate, 17  Kawashima, <em>Chūgoku kindai gaikō no keisei</em> (The formation of modern Chinese diplomacy), 215; Kawashima Shin, “Jūkyū seiki chūki Higashi Ajia ni okeru kokusaihō juyō o meguru enshinryoku to kyūshinryoku” (Centrifugal and centripetal forces surrounding the reception of international law in East Asia in the mid-nineteenth century), 188–90.</p>
<p>18  Often translated as “tax farming” or “engrossment,” <em>baolan</em> was a standard object of official ire in Ming and Qing times. See, for example, Kuhn, “Local Self-Government Under the Republic,” 268, 278; Kwang-ching Liu, “The Ch’ing Restoration,” 440, 445; Muramatsu Yūji, <em>Kindai Kōnan no soen</em> (Landlord bursaries of the lower Yangzi delta region in the modern era), 681–747; and Will and Wong (with Lee), <em>Nourish the People</em>, * * 228, 350, 393.</p>
<p>One of the fullest treatments of the subject can be found in Nishimura, “Shinsho no hōran” (Engrossment in the early Qing).</p>
<p>19  Huang, 181.</p>
<p>A Decisive Turning Point in Sino-Japanese Relations 121</p>
<p>there are many small countries who engage in trade in Shanghai without a treaty, and you allow them all to trade in the open port in accordance with the regulations pertaining to countries with treaties. You just prohibit them from entering Beijing and from calling at inland ports along the shores of the Yangzi River.</p>
<p>[H.] “Japan is close to China. Every year your official and private merchants dealing in copper come to Japan to import goods. Japan has carried out this business properly until this time, and not once has there been either delay or error. At present, Japan is emulating the small nations without treaties from the West and, without asking boldly to sign a treaty, if we are given permission merely to have our merchant vessels engage in trade solely at Shanghai, to install a consulate, to rent a house, and to see to our own customs procedures and levies for our ships and merchants, this would be an exceptional act of grace.”</p>
<p>[I.] The aforementioned Customs <em>daotai</em> made a list of the treaty nations and the non-treaty nations and submitted it, while this minister ordered an investigation of related materials concerning in what manner in the past non-treaty countries have been permitted to trade at Shanghai.</p>
<p>With these instructions, the aforementioned <em>daotai</em> reported on how small, non-treaty states gained permission to trade.20</p>
<p>Wu’s enthusiasm for trade with Japan does not seem to have diminished in the least. While understanding the possible downside of allowing what the Japanese requested—with a potential influx of ships from small, non-treaty lands—he seems prepared to accept what the Japanese were telling him—</p>
<p>either at face value or as a result of his own office’s investigations, or both.</p>
<p>This snippet from his report cites from their “conversation” at length, stressing two factors (again, artificially divided by paragraphs here). Apparently, in the two months of their residence in Shanghai (paragraph G) and in interactions with other nationals, the Japanese learned that some nations engaged in trade without treaties, for the only thing treaties enabled China’s counterparts to do was to have an embassy in Beijing—a rarity which the Qing government was loathe to allow, except under duress. The Japanese had no such interests, they claimed, adding that they only wished to trade in Shanghai, and promising to stay away from the capital and other ports cities along the Yangzi.</p>
<p>Paragraph H begins by slipping into the centuries-old rhetoric of Sino-Japanese friendship, the sort of thing one still hears at bilateral Sino-Japanese conferences and diplomatic interactions to this day, but it does not stay there 20  Huang, 181.</p>
<p>122</p>
<p>A Decisive Turning Point in Sino-Japanese Relations</p>
<p>long. After mentioning the proximity of the two lands, the Japanese try to lay a “guilt trip” at China’s door: you’ve been coming and trading in Japan for years; we’ve been good and on time till now; we’re just doing what other “small countries” ( <em>xiaoguo</em>) * * from the West without treaties have been doing and we don’t even want a treaty; so, please, can we trade only at Shanghai. Oh, and by the way, can we also open a consulate, rent a house in which to place it, and handle our own customs procedures. I have caricatured this passage, but these requests do seem new to the picture, even if they are perfectly understandable.</p>
<p>The last item requested, the right to handle their own customs procedures, offers a slight hint of a gnawing problem the Japanese felt from the moment they landed in Shanghai: their dependence on the Dutch. Without the Dutch intermediary in all their commercial and “diplomatic” ventures in Shanghai, they were likely to increase the chances for enhanced profits, but they seem oblivious of the fact that, without the Dutch, the entire venture might never have been possible. That is, they needed Kroes to serve as their agent, to famil-iarize them with local Chinese practices and legal procedures, and to gain them access to seats of authority, but it came at a price higher than they apparently had expected. Paragraph I merely demonstrates how assiduous Wu Xu and his staff were in gathering supporting material. It would be as a result of this exercise that they would discover a precedent ( <em>ex post facto</em>) * * for a state such as Japan to engage in trade at Shanghai.</p>
<p>Xue and Li, however, were not through, as they not only continue to cite from a report by Wu Xu but enclose copies of other reports from him in this memorial. First, what they go on to cite from him:</p>
<p>In Xianfeng 3 [1853], the walled city of Shanghai was occupied by bandits, and documents in the <em>daotai’s</em> office were all lost, leaving no materials upon which to investigate. Although it had been stipulated in Article Eight of the supplementary treaty with Great Britain that all foreign merchants would be limited to trading at Canton, a draft of “Regulations on Trade at Five Ports” dated Daoguang 23 [1843] enabled, as a result of negotiations in South China [Jiangnan] the previous year, trade for Western merchants at the four ports of Fuzhou, Xiamen [Amoy], Ningbo, and Shanghai, if imperial permission was given. Great Britain agreed.21</p>
<p>Wu Xu and his staff had been extremely busy in the brief period since the first Japanese requests for a new commercial arrangement with China. This paragraph reflects their continued search for a precedent on the basis of which 21  Huang, 181–82.</p>
<p>A Decisive Turning Point in Sino-Japanese Relations 123</p>
<p>trade with Japan might be carried on. Was he doing this as a favor to the Japanese, or to cover himself in the face of potentially adverse opinion on the part of his superiors, or perhaps both?</p>
<p>Upon reviewing Wu Xu’s memorial and offering their own highly suspicious assessment, Xue and Li concluded:</p>
<p>Accordingly, this minister and this governor understand that this memorial [from Wu Xu] conforms to the language of printed books [i.e., it fits with precedent]. Officials from the land of Japan now have put forward requests to follow the cases of non-treaty states, to carry out trade solely at Shanghai, to set up a consulate, to rent a house, and to see to affairs of their own merchants. This minister and this governor are unable to decide how we are to respond. We pray that these [matters] will receive your scrutiny.22</p>
<p>In other words, Circuit Intendant Wu, you handle it, and we shall see what we shall see. The enclosure Wu promised on countries trading in Shanghai (paragraph I) affords some interesting reflection. Trading partners with treaties include: Great Britain, France, United States, Russia, Portugal, Prussia, Belgium (soon to sign a treaty). Traders without treaties include: Denmark, Sweden-Norway, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Hamburg, Bremen and Lübeck, Oldenberg, and Hanover.23 It would appear that, in Wu Xu’s imagination, Japan was a “small non-treaty state” ( <em>wuyue xiaoguo</em>) * * not unlike the handful of German city-states or small European lands listed.</p>
<p>There are still, though, a number of large, unanswered questions arising from these new documents. Why did the shogunal officials in their initial meeting with Wu Xu, shortly after arriving in port, indicate that they only wanted to trade on this occasion, and then two months later, when their stay in Shanghai was nearing its end, why did they take this new route of requesting to follow the model set by the small Western non-treaty states to establish a basis for continued, future trade ties?24 The Japanese clearly understood the direct relationship between the Taiping assaults on Shanghai and the whole region and the depression of commodity prices—they even sighed about it to Wu Xu—and yet they openly sought direct Sino-Japanese trading privileges, arguing that it would be more advantageous to both sides. Perhaps the hyperbole 22  Huang, 182.</p>
<p>23  Huang, 183–84.</p>
<p>24  This point was actually raised to them, according to Wu Xu in a secret memorial; see Huang, 184.</p>
<p>124</p>
<p>A Decisive Turning Point in Sino-Japanese Relations</p>
<p>was flying so fast and furious that it behooves one not to read too much into all this. More likely, I would argue, the Japanese (like Vice-Consul Kroes) were not being entirely forthcoming.</p>
<p>One fascinating piece of the story, which the Japanese mentioned as a justification for their engaging in trade with the Qing empire and which <em>Daotai</em> Wu Xu took up in his own positions, is the concurrent role of Chinese merchants sailing to Nagasaki and buying up Japanese copper. They had no special treaty enabling this activity, but some sort of hazy problem remains unresolved with two such merchants. Wu tells the Japanese, as he reports to his superiors, that these merchants will be dealt with just as soon as the Taipings are quelled.</p>
<p>While generally sympathetic to the Japanese, Wu has at least one more discourse up his sleeve to keep the Japanese at bay, which he subsequently relayed to Xue Huan and Li Hongzhang:</p>
<p>At the end of the Ming dynasty, Japanese pirates formed groups, came to the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang, among others, and caused disturbances along the coast. They were known as *wokou. *</p>
<p>That was a long time ago, and I am not reproaching you for that now, but the people living in their home villages have conveyed [these stories] by word of mouth, and enmity from bygone times may still remain.25</p>
<p>But, the Japanese respond, that was long ago and all the culprits were punished at the time. And, when Wu Xu expresses incredulity, the Japanese officials, having claimed no malice on their part toward China, which they actually insist they revere, actually claim that their views were substantiated “in the history texts of their own country which they unfortunately had not brought with them this time and thus could not point to proofs from those works.”26 We still live with Sino-Japanese controversy over textbooks, but it is nonetheless fascinating to see that, nearly one and one-half centuries ago and despite actual face-to-face contacts for several centuries, on the basis of a shared cultural assumption the Japanese can claim that recording events in history books is closely related to accepted truth about past events.</p>
<p>When writing a few years back about the second Japanese mission to Shanghai, that of the <em>Kenjunmaru</em>, * * which arrived about eighteen months later in early 1864, I was always puzzled by the fact that the new <em>daotai</em>, * * Ying Baoshi (1821–90), in his first meeting with this new set of bakufu officials, asked if they had brought along a copy of a book entitled <em>Kokushi ryaku</em> (A summary 25  Huang, 185.</p>
<p>26  Huang, 185.</p>
<p>A Decisive Turning Point in Sino-Japanese Relations 125</p>
<p>of Japanese history), a work (first published in 1826) in five fascicles written in literary Chinese, by Iwagaki Matsunae (1774–1849), covering the period from the Age of the Gods through the year 1588. How he might have known of such a book remains unclear, but Ying noted that this work would be a good way to acquire knowledge of Japanese history. As it turns out, the *Kenjunmaru * visitors had not brought that specific work with them, but they had thought to bring along a copy of a much more celebrated and much longer work, also in literary Chinese, the <em>Nihon gaishi</em> (Unofficial history of Japan) by Rai San’yō</p>
<p>(1780–1832),27 one of the great Kanbun stylists of the entire Edo period. The head of this second delegation noted that <em>Daotai</em> Ying was “very pleased” with the gift. Given all the errors in Chinese transcription committed by the lead Japanese official, it seems extremely unlikely that someone just happened to have brought Rai San’yō’s book along for personal reading. A Chinese reprint edition of San’yō’s epic was published in Shanghai in 1889.28</p>
<p>Only four days after the flurry of bureaucratic correspondence in 1862 just outlined, on 8/8 the Zongli Yamen sent exactly the same brief missive to Xue and Li. It concluded:</p>
<p>We have no way to conjecture if there will be any future negative reper-cussions, if the Zongli Yamen authorizes Japan’s petition to engage in trade at the one port of Shanghai, to set up a one-man consulate, to rent a house, and to look after it. Thus, we instructed the aforementioned superintendent to investigate the present situation, take appropriate action based on those circumstances, and at the same time report to the Zongli Yamen on what actions were taken.29</p>
<p>In the weeks following the departure of the <em>Senzaimaru</em> for home, the Qing bureaucracy continued to spin its wheels in an effort to reach a decision about whether Japan would be allowed to come and trade again at Shanghai. The Dutch vice-consul was to be the conduit for the Zongli Yamen’s ultimate decision. Wu Xu was to carry out the investigation that the Zongli Yamen ordered Xue Huan to undertake. He eventually prepared a report in which he appears 27  Shinmuru, ed., “Genji gannen ni okeru bakuri no Shanhai shisatsu ki” (Account of an investigation of Shanghai by shogunal officials in the first year of the Genji period [1864]), 352–55; Yamaguchi, “Meiji izen no Shina bōeki” (Trade with China before the Meiji period), 24.</p>
<p>28  “Critically read” <em>(pingyue</em>) * * by Qian Yi and published by Dushitang. There is a copy in the Harvard-Yenching Library.</p>
<p>29  Huang, 186.</p>
<p>126</p>
<p>A Decisive Turning Point in Sino-Japanese Relations</p>
<p>to have retained his belief in the sincerity of the Japanese. He notes several times their cordiality and deference to the Qing officials: “They only wish to engage in trade and only at the one port of Shanghai—other than that, they claim to have no wishes. They had no cunning ulterior motives. I believe it appropriate to grant them this request.” But Wu was not done: “Thus, we need to permit them to establish a consulate, rent a house, and see to their own national trading affairs, but this shall not stand as a precedent for the other countries of the East. In addition, we need to inform this consul [Kroes] that they will supervise their own merchants, prohibit them from arbitrarily traveling to any other port to trade, and indicate the restrictions placed on them.</p>
<p>If we do all this, there will be no future deleterious effects.” As per his wish, Xue and Li forwarded Wu’s report to the Zongli Yamen with an odd recommendation: “We find it difficult to believe that there will no deleterious effects whatsoever in future.”30 In the end, the Zongli Yamen urged a generous spirit and pragmatic approach, because (as everyone in the bureaucratic chain of command knew) foreigners were by nature cunning. No sooner would you ban them from returning to engage in trade then they would turn up even more deferentially requesting trade again; and as soon as Japan got its little feet in the door, other small countries would come and request trading privileges on the basis of the example of Japan.</p>
<p><strong>Epilogue</strong></p>
<p>It is surely next to impossible to try to gauge Wu Xu’s emotional reaction when the Japanese showed up unexpectedly in the late spring of 1862. He would have been an extremely busy man at the time. With the Westerners pressing him on any number of issues, with the Taipings at the gates of the city, with all manner of bureaucratic correspondence flowing through his office, the Japanese presented just one more (annoying?) source of difficulty in an already difficult job.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, <em>Daotai</em> Wu was nothing if not a consummate professional, and he saw to it that a precedent would be located by his assistants to justify the position he had chosen to take in granting the Japanese extremely good terms in 1862. Without the discovery of these documents, however, none of this would have been known; we would have remained staring at the same black box that generations of scholars have stared at since the events themselves transpired.</p>
<p>Without these materials, Wu Xu’s role in this decisive event in Sino-Japanese 30  Huang, 187.</p>
<p>A Decisive Turning Point in Sino-Japanese Relations 127</p>
<p>relations would remain largely invisible. But, with them in hand, we find that, despite all the other troubles faced by the Shanghai <em>daotai</em>, his professionalism affords us an extraordinary look at the late imperial bureaucracy handling a perplexing case with great grace and acumen. When all we had were the individual accounts of the young Japanese samurai, we could (as many Japanese scholars have) examine them for insights into China and Japan at the time, but we gleaned next to nothing about the bureaucratic relations between the two states, because those samurai were never part of any state-to-state negotiations. With these new documents, the travel accounts of the young samurai are now balanced by the shogunal officials’ efforts to insinuate themselves into the Chinese good graces. The Japanese officials all but beg the Chinese to allow them to continue trading, and the Chinese—with a rather full plate already in mid-1862—condescend to permit this venture but caution against rashly coming again.</p>
<p>There the matter effectively rested until early 1864 when, as the Zongli Yamen predicted, another Japanese vessel, the <em>Kenjunmaru</em> showed up and requested trade.</p>
