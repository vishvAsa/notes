  <meta property="og:description" content="At noon on December 3, 1937, a Japanese military parade—perhaps in ironic imitation of other processions by foreigners in Shanghai—began marching down Nanjing Road through the foreign concessions in Shanghai and along the Bund. In the lead was a military police (kenpeitai) car escorted by mounted troops bearing sabres at the hilt. They were followed by a large infantry detach-ment, machine-gunners, and finally by artillerymen. Japanese aircraft flew by overhead, and Japanese civilians lined the route along the way and shouted out choruses of banzai. When they arrived at Jessfield Park, they were met by a contingent of Italian ladies—allies in the anti-Comintern pact—waving Japanese flags. The event lasted until 3 p.m. and involved all 6000 Japanese troops stationed in the city. The next day a smaller contingent of troops marched in orderly fashion from Garden Bridge south to the Bund and through the concessions ( Tokyo asahi shinbun, December 4, 1937, and December 5, 1937; cited in Muramatsu 1991, 308–9). Lest there be any doubt about it, this was clearly intended as a victory march, an effort to demonstrate the new reality of Japan’s preeminence in Shanghai. However much this display may have been directed at the Chinese, with whom Japan had now been at war for five months, the Western residents of the concessions—with whom the resident Japanese had been at loggerheads for many years—were the primary targets. No such event ever took place in any of the other centers of Japanese residence in China, only in Shanghai, where all the Western powers were present in full force.">

  <p>At noon on December 3, 1937, a Japanese military parade—perhaps in ironic imitation of other processions by foreigners in Shanghai—began marching down Nanjing Road through the foreign concessions in Shanghai and along the Bund. In the lead was a military police (kenpeitai) car escorted by mounted troops bearing sabres at the hilt. They were followed by a large infantry detach-ment, machine-gunners, and finally by artillerymen. Japanese aircraft flew by overhead, and Japanese civilians lined the route along the way and shouted out choruses of banzai.  When they arrived at Jessfield Park, they were met by a contingent of Italian ladies—allies in the anti-Comintern pact—waving Japanese flags. The event lasted until 3 p.m. and involved all 6000 Japanese troops stationed in the city. The next day a smaller contingent of troops marched in orderly fashion from Garden Bridge south to the Bund and through the concessions ( Tokyo asahi shinbun, December 4, 1937, and December 5, 1937; cited in Muramatsu 1991, 308–9). Lest there be any doubt about it, this was clearly intended as a victory march, an effort to demonstrate the new reality of Japan’s preeminence in Shanghai. However much this display may have been directed at the Chinese, with whom Japan had now been at war for five months, the Western residents of the concessions—with whom the resident Japanese had been at loggerheads for many years—were the primary targets. No such event ever took place in any of the other centers of Japanese residence in China, only in Shanghai, where all the Western powers were present in full force.</p>
<p>The complex background to the staging of such an event reflects both Japan’s long efforts to gain respectability among the foreign powers in Shanghai and the sense of frustration among local Japanese with the rising tide of anti-Japanese activities among the surrounding Chinese population. There were nearly 25,000 Japanese in the city by this time,1 and their numbers would</p>

<p>skyrocket over the next few years, but most lived with a deep and increasing apprehension as they found themselves on the front lines of an unfolding tragedy of enormous proportions. The central organization that gave cohesion to the Japanese community of Shanghai, that administered its communal institutions, and that represented it through the consulate to the homeland was the Japanese Residents’ Association (JRA) of Shanghai (Shanhai kyoryū mindan).</p>
<p>Its history is the subject of this essay.2</p>
<p>Yet, the community that the JRA represented was by no means monolithic.</p>
<p>It was subtly stratified into at least two tiers. These different groups within the community had different objectives, concerns, and experiences. As a result they tended to react differently to the events of the years under study. A study of the Shanghai JRA, representing the largest Japanese community within China proper, reveals how these Japanese of different backgrounds responded to events at the time of Japanese aggression against China. One minute they were civilians within the protected concessionary enclave, and the next they were on the front lines of a ferocious war. Were they in fact trapped there by political and military considerations beyond their control, or did they play some role in fashioning the nature of the Japanese response to an increasingly hostile environment? How did their experiences differ from those of other JRA communities in China? And, how did the unfolding perception of a Chinese menace influence the social rifts within the Shanghai community?</p>
<p>While recent years have witnessed a growing body of writings in English on Shanghai (for example, Henriot 1993; Wakeman 1995) and especially on its Western communities (for example, Bickers and Henriot 2000; Wilkinson 2000; Kreissler 2000), little has as yet been published on the Japanese community (Henriot 2000 is a recent exception). Other Japanese expatriate communities in China have also received scant attention (except for Fogel 2000). Before multiethnic Shanghai can be fully appreciated, the largest foreign presence in Shanghai needs greater coverage. This article is part of that project.</p>

<p><strong>Origins and Early Work of the Shanghai JRA</strong></p>
<p>Unlike the other foreign powers, Japan had a long premodern history of ties to Shanghai, going back at least to the fifteenth century and probably earlier.</p>
<p>However, when the first Japanese vessel of the modern era, the Senzaimaru, docked at the port of Shanghai in 1862 (nineteen years after that port had officially opened), it found Great Britain, the United States, Holland, and 2  The only essay in English to date that even touches on the Shanghai JRA is Peattie 1989.</p>

<p>France already well established in the city.3 Only seven Japanese had settled in Shanghai when diplomatic ties were established in 1871, but after the creation of a Japanese consulate the next year, major Japanese companies began setting up branches there.</p>
<p>During the early Meiji years (1868–1912), the population grew slowly, with women constituting roughly two-thirds of the local Japanese; the men were engaged in a variety of business concerns, while the women worked largely in the flesh trade, many having been kidnapped from their homes to fill the brothels in Shanghai and throughout East and Southeast Asia. By 1890 the resident Japanese population reached 639, with men for the first time outnumbering women (337 to 302). Although the population approached 1000 on the eve of the first Sino-Japanese War of 1894–95, during that conflict the great majority of Japanese withdrew; most returned following Japan’s stunning victory. The Treaty of Shimonoseki provided that Japan could build factories on Chinese soil, and as a result Japanese became more deeply involved in the Chinese economy. In late 1904 the resident Japanese population surpassed 3000 and continued to rise much more rapidly from 1905 (Zhu 1995, 401, 406; Takatsuna 1995, 119–21; Katō 1974, 316–17; Yonezawa 1938 and 1939; Soejima 1984, 9, 24; Cao and Ma 1990, 51).4 Throughout the Meiji era the great majority of Japanese in Shanghai came from the southern island of Kyūshū and western Honshū, areas which provided a great number of Japanese emigrants to other sites, including Korea.</p>
<p>The Treaty of Shimonoseki enabled the Japanese to establish a concession area, but they never sought to do so in Shanghai as they did in other Chinese cities, such as Tianjin and Hankou. No one has as yet satisfactorily explained why they opted against a concession, but possible fears of alienating the large foreign presence in the city with this newly emergent (and non-European) group may have militated against such a move. The great majority of Japanese, some 75 percent, remained in Shanghai’s International Settlement, that area to the north of the Chinese city occupied initially by the British after victory in the Opium War. Even before the first Sino-Japanese War, Japanese were settling in the Hongkou quarter of the settlement, soon to become known informally as the “Japanese Concession” or “Japantown.” Interestingly, though, the decision not to construct a concession of its own by no means meant that the Japanese 3  On premodern contacts between Shanghai and Japan, see Qiao 1990, 35–39, 65.

<p>340</p>
<p>the japanese residents’ association of shanghai</p>
<p>community would be more closely integrated into the life of the Chinese city.</p>
<p>To the contrary, it was probably more isolated in Shanghai than in other population centers on the mainland.</p>
<p>Responding to the rapid growth of a Japanese presence on the Asian mainland and to the need to unify and protect their nationals abroad, the Japanese government, through the Gaimushō (Ministry of Foreign Affairs), enacted a “Residents’ Association Law” (Kyoryū mindan hō) on March 7, 1905. The Gaimushō followed with a supplementary directive on August 1 of that year. On December 17, 1905, a Japanese Association (Nihonjin kyōkai) was founded at a joint meeting held in the Japanese Consulate of the Shanghai Japanese Club (Nihonjin kurabu) and the Japanese Business Club (Nihon jitsugyō kurabu).5</p>
<p>Several days later Consul-General Nagataki appointed a thirty-member board, which on December 23 named Itō Yonejirō its first chairman. The most important task for the Japanese Association was to take over the management of the Kaidō Elementary School from the Shanghai branch of the Higashi Honganji (founded in 1874, an outpost of the “eastern headquarters” of the Pure Land Buddhist sect), which had seen to its operation since it was initially set up in 1890. The Japanese Cemetery, located on land purchased by the consulate in 1873 and long run by the Higashi Honganji, was also placed into the hands of the Japanese Association. These and a number of other communal tasks occupied the Japanese Association for the two years of its existence (Shanhai kyoryū mindan 1942, 107–12, 933–34; Hayashi 1929, 91; Nakauchi 1941, 25).</p>
<p>These early years correspond precisely to the immediate post-Russo-Japanese War period of rapid Japanese growth in Shanghai. The Japanese Association was not up to the task, and its role was taken over by the JRA, founded on September 1, 1907, with Itō Yonejirō assuming the chairmanship of the JRA board. Its offices were at first placed in the Japanese Club. The JRA was initially concerned with how to levy taxes from local Japanese in order to support its work, eventually devising a sliding scale based on income. On January 7, 1908, a Residents’ Council (Kyoryū minkai) was formed in compli-ance with a consular order, and this body regulated taxes on the local community. The Residents’ Council varied in size for a number of years before the Gaimushō fixed it at 60 in 1925 (Shanhai kyoryū mindan 1942, 172–76, 178; Yonezawa 1941, 194–96; Takatsuna 1993, 42).</p>
<p>In its early years, the JRA concerned itself with a number of projects. The Japanese Volunteers (Giyūtai) had belonged to the Shanghai Volunteer Brigade since 1900, but with the creation of the JRA, management of the Volunteers 5  The Japanese Club of Shanghai was the quintessential association for the elite of the community, and its relations with the JRA were always intimate. See Kaiin meibo 1944.</p>
<p>the japanese residents’ association of shanghai 341</p>
<p>fell to it beginning in 1907. Operation of the first elementary school by the Japanese Association was turned over to the JRA, and it was renamed the Japanese Higher Elementary School (Nihon jinjō kōtō shōgakkō) in 1908 when it had 125 students enrolled; in 1910 a nursery school was added, and both were soon swamped with pupils. To solve this oversubscription, the JRA opened an Eastern District Japanese Elementary School (Tōbu Nihon jinjō shōgakkō) in November 1923, but it too was soon overwhelmed with students and had to be expanded. A third “Western District” (Seibu) elementary school was opened in April 1927, and a fourth “Central District” (Chūbu) opened two years later.</p>
<p>In 1920 a Japanese Girls’ Higher School (Nihon kōtō jogakkō) was opened, and it moved to its own quarters in 1923. In 1926 a Japanese Business School (Nihon jitsugyō gakkō) also opened its doors, and five years later a Japanese Commercial School (Nihon shōgyō gakkō) followed suit, moving to its own building the next year. The number of schools continued to proliferate as the Japanese population grew over time. In theory, all of these schools were open to all Japanese, there being no distinction by class, and there were no special or elite private Japanese schools in Shanghai.</p>
<p>In addition to all these educational tasks that consumed 80 percent of its budget, the JRA also continued to manage the Japanese cemetery and crematorium as well as the Shanghai Youth Association (Kojō seinenkai, founded in 1902). The JRA assumed responsibility for local hygiene and disease prevention as well, establishing a hospital administrative council in 1931 and a full-fledged clinic in 1934 (Shanhai kyoryū mindan 1942, 178–83, 568, 944–81, 1295–1310).6</p>
<p>Even had there had not been conflicts with the surrounding Chinese community, the JRA clearly had its hands full to overflowing.</p>
<p>One remarkable quality of the entire Japanese enterprise in Shanghai was how extrinsic for the great majority of Japanese it was to the city itself and how much Japanese life there was designed to resemble home, though it should be noted that it was a rare foreigner of any nationality who fashioned a Chinese life-style on the mainland. From the second decade of the twentieth century, Japanese began informally referring to their adopted city with the extraordinary transnational toponym “Nagasaki ken, Shanhai shi” (the city of Shanghai in the prefecture of Nagasaki). This offhand remark indicated both the large number of Japanese residents from Kyūshū (where Nagasaki was to be found) and the extent to which most Japanese lived in a Japanese style. For example, fish and vegetables arrived from the port of Nagasaki on a daily basis and were 6  On educational facilities operated by the JRA in Shanghai, see Shanhai kyoryū mindan ritsu gakkō ichiran 1933; and Wu Jianxi 1994.

<p>sold in the local Shanghai markets. “It was as if a corner of the Nagasaki market had moved,” noted one Shanghai Japanese from Nagasaki; “Japanese residents in Shanghai lived there oblivious to the fact that they were in a foreign country” (cited in Takatsuna 1995, 125).</p>
<p>The JRA weathered the collapse of the Qing dynasty in 1911, the rising poverty and famine in central China which caused refugees to flock to Shanghai (and enhanced the danger of the spread of disease), and the chaos of the early years of the Republic of China. The most distressing and irritating development to them in those years, however, was the rise of the anti-Japanese movement among Chinese. The local Chinese reaction to the Twenty-one Demands in 1915 was a boycott of Japanese goods and, even more debilitating, the refusal of Chinese merchants to sell to local Japanese. Although they had had no say in the formulation of the policy that had led to the delivery of those demands, local Japanese soon found themselves on the front lines facing Chinese ire.</p>
<p>Smaller Japanese businesses suffered as a result, and many Japanese were forced to return home. With several notable exceptions, their answer was to organize themselves locally to withstand assault and, if necessary, respond in kind. Writing an account of his impressions a few years later in the early 1920s, the novelist and travel writer Muramatsu Shōfū (1889–1961) noted in stark tones:</p>
<p>The Japanese have no intention whatsoever of throwing away fifty years of work that have gone into the building of “Shanghai-Japan.” The Yangzi trade runs annually to five or six hundred million yen and often more than seven. As Manchuria is Japan’s lifeline, the Yangzi trade is Japan’s line of nourishment, and it will under no circumstances dispense with this. There is no reason to relinquish such great interests even if it means fighting. We must come to the aid of the 30,000 [Japanese] residents of Shanghai. We cannot let them die before our very eyes. This is our responsibility both as a state and as a government.7</p>
<p>As Muramatsu’s language suggests, the Japanese living in Shanghai were part of a community closely linked to the homeland. Yes, they were living in Shanghai and, as much as possible, still in Japan, but, with few exceptions, they were doing everything possible not to be living in China. In this sense, they had adopted all the worst foreign biases against the Chinese. But the links to Shanghai were not ephemeral or illusory, and not just because of the economic 7  Mato (Demon Capital), published in 1923, as cited in Takatsuna 1995, 131.

<p>the japanese residents’ association of shanghai 343</p>
<p>ties Muramatsu cites. Japan’s penetration into the foreign-dominated Shanghai market had been hard fought and would not be easily relinquished. Already in the early 1920s, Shanghai had been transformed into an essential organ of the Japanese political-economic animal, as Manchuria had been earlier.</p>
<p>Muramatsu’s account thus resounds with several layers of ominous ringing.</p>
<hr>
<p>**Responses to Chinese Nationalism and Rifts within the **</p>
<p><strong>Japanese Community</strong></p>
<p>One of the great shocks of the early twentieth century to Japanese from many different walks of life was that Chinese nationalism should develop precisely as an anti-Japanese movement. Many were unprepared for any sort of cohesive Chinese nationalism to emerge, because they had been led to believe by scholars and journalists alike that the Chinese had no concept of nation. Some, such as the eminent Sinologist Naitō Konan, argued that China had long passed the historical era in which the nation was a meaningful unit. However, since the rest of the world was still stuck in that earlier period, China might need some assistance or guidance to become an active player in the family of nations.</p>
<p>Others were not as generous to the Chinese or as knowledgeable of Chinese history and simply believed that the Chinese were not ready to assume the responsibilities of a modern nation-state. This view was not merely the product of corrupt, imperialist Japanese minds, for Sun Zhongshan (Sun Yat-sen) himself had suggested that the Chinese people were like a sheet of loose sand, not yet cohering into the presumed natural unity that the nation-state would provide. Other Japanese were prepared to recognize Chinese nationalism for what it was, but assumed that East Asians shared a common enemy in the Western imperialist powers and thus shared a common destiny; Chinese could develop nationalism, in this formulation, but it was unthinkable that they would ever identify Japan as the enemy.</p>
<p>In response to fears during the anti-Japanese boycotts of 1915, six neighborhood associations ( chōnaikai) were organized for local self-defense and mutual aid (Hashimoto 1940, 61–62, lists the original six). They worked closely with the JRA and the consulate. Two years later, six more neighborhood associations were formed, and together the twelve were dubbed the League of Japanese Neighborhood Associations of Shanghai (Shanhai Nihonjin chōnai rengōkai); the first head of the League was Hayashi Yūkichi, who would lead it on and off for the next three decades. When boycotts and other anti-Japanese actions erupted, these neighborhood associations were called into action to provide Japanese with current information, deliver the mail, distribute food, protect</p>
<p>344</p>
<p>the japanese residents’ association of shanghai</p>
<p>fellow nationals (especially schoolchildren), and later organize vigilance committees (  jikeidan).  By the mid-1920s, the number of neighborhood associations had risen to forty, and to insure effective coordination of the various groups, Consul-General Yada Shichitarō had the League of Japanese Neighborhood Associations transformed into the more cohesive Japanese Street Federation of Shanghai (Shanhai Nihonjin kakuro rengōkai). Each neighborhood association bore its fair share of the expenses for running the Street Federation. By the start of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, this umbrella organization oversaw the activities of 56 neighborhood associations; by June 1942, there were 179 of them (Shanhai kyoryū mindan 1942, 1047, 1056, 1063, 1070–78; Hashimoto 1940, 5, 56, 58–59; Takatsuna 1995, 127–28).</p>
<p>Although they had to be affiliated with the JRA, the neighborhood associations were not organized by JRA leaders. This disjuncture reveals the most telling social cleavage within the Japanese community of Shanghai throughout its history, a cleavage exacerbated by external assault. From its inception the JRA was run by elite members of local Japanese society. Its board was comprised of this elite and was closely tied to the consulate, to the major corporations and banks in the former British Concession, and to the heads of textile companies that dominated the Japanese economy in Shanghai (see Duus 1989 for a fine overview of Japanese textile investments and factories in China). They were dubbed the kaishaha or “company clique” because of these ties, and most lived in mansions in the British and French Concession areas. They accounted for no more than 5 percent of the Japanese in Shanghai, but they held a disproportionate share of the community’s clout in local affairs and in relations with the home government. In most cases, they did not intend to live in Shanghai for the rest of their lives but were usually there for several years before being transferred to some equally prestigious position in Paris or London or New York. Thus, their social contacts were, more often than not, with their social equals among the Western elite.</p>
<p>By contrast, the great majority of Japanese belonged to what was locally called the dochakuha or “native clique,” comprised of middle-class and poorer people. While the JRA board was dominated by the kaishaha, they knew there would be serious friction within the community if dochakuha interests were ignored, and frequently a dochakuha man was appointed head of the board to placate those interests. At the time of the Shanghai Incident in January 1932</p>
<p>(see below), for example, Kawabata Teiji, a doctor living in the Hongkou district, served in this position; he had been a resident of Shanghai since 1912 and was felled by a Chinese terrorist bomb in April 1932 at a ceremony honoring Emperor Hirohito’s birthday. By no means were all dochakuha  professionals.</p>
<p>the japanese residents’ association of shanghai 345</p>
<p>Most were Japanese expatriates who worked as salaried employees of the textile firms, banks, and other Japanese concerns or operated their own small-and middle-sized firms or shops in various trades and lived in Hongkou and Zhabei, adjacent sites in the north on the edge of the “international city” of Shanghai. At the bottom end, it also included Japanese who were unemployed.</p>
<p>It was, thus, an economically weak group, dependent on local political and economic vagaries, living side-by-side with Chinese in the same trades. It was they who were most affected by anti-Japanese actions and were thus most ter-rified of them. As Sino-Japanese tensions mounted through the 1920s, it was they—not the wealthy business people living in geographical security—that confronted Chinese outrage daily and felt ever more alienated and isolated.</p>
<p>Their early response was to organize the neighborhood associations for self-defense (Shanhai kyoryū mindan 1942, 1101–02; Takatsuna 1993, 32, 42–43, 90; Takatsuna 1995, 123–24; Horimoto 1989, 46–47; see also comments by Professor Usui Katsumi in Dokyumento Shōwa 1986, 188–89.</p>
<p>While it is highly doubtful that these two groups would have interacted socially back in Japan, the nature of the social rift in Shanghai reflects the experience of living overseas and fitting into a socioeconomic mold cast before their arrival. Thus, there were no rural Japanese farmers or a significant Japanese working class in Shanghai, as, of course, there were in Japan. Interestingly, the Japanese community in prewar Singapore had a similar social cleavage: a business elite known as gudan zoku (godown group) and ordinary folk known as shitamachi zoku (downtown group) (Yano 1975, 124–25).8 Among the various sites of foreign residence in China, though, no other city produced such a tense cleavage, undoubtedly because of the concentration in Shanghai of Japanese and Japanese interests.</p>
<p>At the time of the Northern Expedition in 1927, there were renewed fears of rising anti-Japanese activities in Shanghai and of the forces of Jiang Jieshi (Chiang Kai-shek) “becoming red” ( sekishokka), in spite of their ferocious massacre of Communists in the spring of that year. In December a group of local JRA members with military experience organized a Shanghai branch of the Imperial Military Reservists’ Association ( Teikoku zaigō gunjinkai) to protect local Japanese interests. Coming from the same social stratum and neighborhoods as other dochakuha members, the Reservists soon linked up with the neighborhood associations and vigilance committees. This link tied the dochakuha directly to the Japanese military (Shanhai kyoryū mindan 1942, 1081–82; Takatsuna 1993, 49; Takatsuna 1995, 129; Peattie 1989, 207).</p>

<p>The apprehensions of these Japanese were not based on paranoia. They were the closest, most visible representatives of a policy of Japanese expansion into China that</p>
<p>was widely hated by Chinese. However, the spark for the explosion of the 1932 incident in Shanghai was lit hundreds of miles away in the northeast with the Manchurian Incident of September 18, 1931. After that incident, Japanese in Shanghai and elsewhere in urban China felt even more threatened by the forces of anti-Japanism, and this in turn pushed them further in the direction of seeing all Chinese as potential enemies. Such a volatile mix might have been ignited by any one of a number of events, but it would not have the luxury of dissipating with time. The ferocity of the Japanese assault on Shanghai in early 1932 directly reflects the fears and alienation of the dochakuha who were primarily responsible for the horrors visited on the Chinese city at that time.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>The Shanghai Incident and the JRA</strong></p>
<p>As they later narrated the history of events culminating in the Shanghai Incident, the JRA saw a long string of anti-Japanese actions beginning in 1908</p>
<p>and culminating in the Manchurian Incident. While we might now be reluctant to follow this distinctively nationalistic logic and interpret the Manchurian Incident as anti-Japanese, one would be hard-pressed to disagree that it was the start of an altogether new era in Sino-Japanese relations. News of the clashes in Manchuria soon spread south to Shanghai, and many Japanese in less well-protected cities of China withdrew to the relative security of Shanghai. The anti-Japanese boycott in place because of the P’yǒngyang Incident (Shanhai kyoryū mindan 1942, 206–7, 545–47)9 of July 1931 only intensified and sparked countless local incidents. Various anti-Japanese organizations formed in the city to protest the Guandong Army’s actions, and local Japanese felt an unprecedented level of anxiety.</p>
<p>9  On July 1, 1931, Chinese and Korean farmers near the city of Changchun in Manchuria clashed, and Japanese troops stepped in to break it up. News that Chinese had attacked Korean farmers reached Korea and spawned anti-Chinese riots, especially in the cities of Inchon and P’yǒngyang. In the latter 27 people were killed, and another “incident” acquired a toponym.</p>
<p>The boycott in Shanghai was the result of anger that the Japanese overlords in Korea had not prevented the violence against Chinese.</p>
<p>the japanese residents’ association of shanghai 347</p>
<p>There were armed Chinese attacks on the Japanese areas of Shanghai, and Chinese activists carried out sanctions against Chinese merchants who continued to do business with Japanese. These and other anti-Japanese actions hit the small- and middle-level Japanese businessmen—namely, the dochakuha— the hardest, forcing factory and shop closings. For example, whereas 29 percent of all imports on the Shanghai market in 1930 came from Japan, by December 1931 that figure had dropped to 3 percent (Xu Jie 1996, 288). The Japanese Commercial League of Shanghai (Shanhai Nihon shōkō rengōkai), representing 960 small- and middle-sized Japanese businessmen, was hastily formed and appealed to the consulate for help from the Japanese government, which sent three Japanese destroyers to the port of Shanghai from Japan. Ultimately, these businessmen organized mutual aid through the Street Federation with the help of the JRA.</p>
<p>In the first weeks following the Manchurian Incident, the Shanghai Street Federation, led by the aforementioned Hayashi Yūkichi, organized a residents’</p>
<p>assembly ( kyoryūmin taikai), which would eventually meet on four occasions over the next few months preceding the Shanghai Incident. Gathering for the first time on October 11, 1931, some 6000 participants speaking loudly for the dochakuha convened at a Japanese elementary school and adopted a harsh line; they called on the Japanese government and military to provide aid against Chinese efforts to destroy them. At their second meeting on October 27, 3500</p>
<p>participants from fifteen Chinese cities descended on Shanghai to repeat their hard line. The third meeting on December 6 again brought together about 3500</p>
<p>participants from 42 Japanese resident groups throughout China. Their line was even harder this time, as this dochakuha-led group protested against the kaishaha-dominated consulate.</p>
<p>The kaishaha’s more moderate tone seems to have won the day temporarily, but the dochakuha only became angrier afterward when the Japanese government took no determined action against the Chinese. Later, in December, dochakuha groups became emboldened and began calling for Japan to “punish China.” At the fourth meeting of the residents’ assembly on January 20, 1932, some 2000 participants reached a bellicose crescendo, demonstrating in front of the Japanese consulate and clashing with the Shanghai Municipal Police.</p>
<p>At these and smaller meetings of neighborhood associations, these Japanese decided on a policy of striking at the anti-Japanese movement before being attacked further themselves (Takatsuna 1993, 64–75).10</p>
<p>10  Both the Street Federation (Hashimoto 1940) and the Shanghai JRA (Shanhai kyoryū</p>
<p>mindan 1942) have left histories written in the early 1940s; the former is considerably sharper in its attacks on the Chinese and in its self-defense than the latter.</p>
<p>348</p>
<p>the japanese residents’ association of shanghai</p>
<p>The elite level of Japanese society in Shanghai took another approach. At the time of the Manchurian Incident, Consul-General Murai called a meeting of all the major Japanese leaders in the city, including Yasui Gengo, chairman of the JRA, Ikeda Shigeo of the Residents’ Council, and Hayashi Yūkichi of the Street Federation, to plan for the protection of local Japanese should the anti-Japanese movement in the north spread to Shanghai. At that time they constituted themselves as an Emergency Board (Jikyoku iinkai) headed by Murai and to be funded by the JRA. They continued to meet either every day or every few days for the next eight months. The Emergency Board coordinated a number of activities, such as housing, food distribution, and communications, and pressed the home government to dispatch troops to support them. Ultimately, they took complete credit for “saving 30,000 [sic] Japanese from massacre”</p>
<p>through “a unity of officials and people, cooperation of military and civilian.”</p>
<p>The harsh response of the dochakuha to rising Chinese nationalism directed against Japan as compared to the kaishaha’s more measured reactions is not overly surprising. The latter was always more personally protected against violence and in any case had to answer directly to the Japanese government for any actions pursued in the name of the community. The fear and loathing of the former group, though, were certainly exacerbated by the lack of heed paid it by the kaishaha leadership. This in turn only heightened class tensions within the Japanese community of Shanghai. When dochakuha groups did become violent later that month, however, they vented all of their anger against the Chinese. The JRA leadership could claim no responsibility for the vigilante actions taken against the Chinese.</p>
<p>The JRA’s role in this cooperation involved liaison with government and police agencies, making the Japanese position known to the press, providing a temporary postal service, turning some of the dormitories at JRA-run schools over to military use, mobilizing teachers at those same schools to work in field hospitals, collecting funds to support the various agencies during the crisis, purchasing food and fuel and acquiring vehicles from Nagasaki and Dairen (C. Dalian, in China’s northeast), providing housing and provisions for refugees, distributing free food, and interpreting for military personnel (Shanhai kyoryū mindan 1942, 552–57, citation p. 556).11</p>
<p>The Shanghai Incident, beginning in late January 1932, has received some scholarly attention, although most of it has focused on the event as a precursor 11  This mammoth chronicle of the JRA’s work by the JRA significantly mentions almost nothing of the dochakuha activities described above, nor of the atrocities to be described below.</p>
<p>the japanese residents’ association of shanghai 349</p>
<p>to the greater disaster to follow. It left 6080 Chinese dead, 2000 wounded, and 10,400 missing; 814,084 persons suffered direct losses, and 80 percent of urban workers lost their jobs; 50 percent of all factories in Zhabei were destroyed largely from aerial bombardment, and 1.2 million Chinese were made refugees.</p>
<p>Much of the killing and destruction was the direct result of vigilante actions taken by the vigilance committees of the neighborhood associations. These associations worked in conjunction with the Shanghai branch of the Reservists and represented dochakuha animosities and fears. The general pretext used for murdering civilians was that nonmilitary Chinese personnel were all potential soldiers, whether or not in uniform. The Chinese and Western press labeled these mobile killers “Japanese rōnin,” and indeed they apparently included organized criminals and gangsters, as well as ordinary thugs and far-right-wing extremists. The Japanese authorities later tried to suppress stories of these massacres, but they actually had to contend with printed and spirited defenses of these actions from the time of their commission. Muramatsu Shōfū, whose earlier defense of Japanese actions to defend their hard-fought position in Shanghai was cited above, witnessed the Shanghai Incident and wrote for the popular monthly Chūō kōron  in the following way:</p>
<p>As far as we Japanese are concerned, the greatest achievement of the vigilance committees was their having been able to wipe out the plainclothes soldiers. The one real weakness of our Naval Landing Party [the Japanese military body that led the assault on the city] was an overall lack of familiarity with the local terrain. China’s most potent tactic was to take advantage of this lacuna, loose thousands of plainclothes troops upon us, increase the dangers facing the Japanese, and thus attempt to unleash disorder in our rear. To resist this move, we have had no choice but to organize the vigilance committees. However, as we know from the time of the Great Kantō Earthquake [in September 1923 in Japan], vigilance committees may run rampant for a time and go to extremely violent ends. How much easier, then, is it for us to see that under circumstances of taking action against a clear enemy, unlike the natural disaster of an earthquake, the vigilance committees would reach a state of heightened and ruinous agitation. Only the Japanese vigilance committees displayed such heroism as when they sprang to action barehanded against the pistol-bearing plainclothes troops. Thus, the plainclothes soldiers’ tactic of the Chinese was completely defeated. We did not anticipate that the Chinese might use such fighting strength against the ordinary people of their opponents [i.e., the Japanese]. Frequently plainclothes troops were</p>
<p>350</p>
<p>the japanese residents’ association of shanghai</p>
<p>misidentified, and good people suffered. (Muramatsu 1932, 347. Also cited in Takatsuna 1993, 86)</p>
<p>Here and in other contemporary sources, the author admitted to massacres and to the disposal of bodies by carrying them onto Japanese vessels and throwing them into the waters of the Yangzi. Indeed, this was probably the fate of a good many of the 10,400 missing Chinese during the Shanghai Incident, raising the death toll much higher. Most of this gruesome business was the work of the Japanese navy working with the vigilance committees and all in five weeks’ time.</p>
<p>The term used by Muramatsu and many other Japanese of the day to describe the multitude of prospective Chinese troops was “plainclothes soldiers” ( ben’itai). The very existence of such a term is evidence of the volatile nature of the Japanese response to the Shanghai Incident. In the minds of many increasingly nervous Japanese, virtually any suspicious-looking Chinese might be construed as a “plainclothes troop.” In fact, any Chinese at all might be labeled as such and summarily shot by a trigger-happy, frightened Japanese populace constantly checking its rear.12 And, the more Japanese goon squads acted on such fears, the more Chinese in fact must have effectively become figurative soldiers without uniforms in a total war against Japan. Certainly, the justification for violence against the Chinese provoked more violence on the part of Chinese out of self-protection. Indeed, under circumstances such as the Shanghai Incident, not to reach such a conclusion on the part of many Chinese meant almost certain death.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>World War Two in Shanghai</strong></p>
<p>Both sides claimed victory in the Shanghai Incident when Japanese troops withdrew, though it was at best a Pyrrhic victory for the Chinese. The Marco Polo Bridge Incident of July 7, 1937—a clash between Chinese and Japanese troops outside Beijing—which the JRA of Shanghai also blamed on the Chinese, quickly set off a fresh set of incidents through north China and into Shanghai. Again, local Chinese merchants refused to sell to or buy from Japanese, and it soon became difficult for local Japanese to get basic foodstuffs.</p>
<p>As fears of a massacre or siege set in, the JRA through the consulate called for 12  See the interesting essay on the origins of the term “plainclothes soldier” and its distinctiveness to the Shanghai Incident and further Japanese encroachments into China in Kuroha 1979.</p>
<p>the japanese residents’ association of shanghai 351</p>
<p>naval reinforcements in early August. When Shanghai Mayor Yu Hongjun protested on August 13 to Japanese Consul-General Okamoto against violations by the Naval Landing Party, the latter ominously replied that it was not the Japanese but Chinese “plainclothes troops” who were at fault for violating the peace (Shanhai kyoryū mindan 1942, 669–71).</p>
<p>Soon after war broke out, many of the employees of the larger Japanese concerns sent their families home; others at sites further up the Yangzi shuttled their families through Shanghai back to Japan. The Emergency Board continued to do its work and helped facilitate repatriation as well as welcoming the Japanese that started flocking to Shanghai after the arrival of Japanese troops.</p>
<p>As more cities fell to Japanese forces through 1938, Japan’s military position continued to grow. News of the bombing of Pearl Harbor and declarations of war against the United States and Great Britain reached Shanghai in the wee hours of December 8, 1941; the one American river gunboat docked in Shanghai surrendered, and the one British river gunboat there refused to do so and was sunk. Later that morning the Japanese consul-general visited the Shanghai Municipal Council and announced his country’s intentions to occupy the foreign concessions and keep order there; the Naval Landing Party entered at the Bund and the imperial Japanese army entered at other strategic points. As the JRA narrative of the events put it: “Shanghai, stronghold of the West for 100 years, was taken by the Japanese army, and a new dawn for East Asia was proclaimed” (Muramatsu 1991, 313–15; Shanhai kyoryū mindan 1942, 676–79, 681–85, citation on p. 685).13</p>
<p>Once war commenced, the task of protecting Japanese nationals in Shanghai fell to the JRA. This difficult work increasingly required centralizing the JRA’s many subordinate and tangentially connected bodies in Shanghai. It also necessitated a growing budget, from between US $700,000 and $800,000 before the war to $6.2 million by 1942. This money was forthcoming principally in the form of loans from the big Japanese banks, not in grants from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and this change only furthered the image of the JRA as a kaishaha body, not representative of the entire community. As the war developed, however, distinctions of this sort between different Japanese classes melted away before the surrounding Chinese enemy.</p>
<p>Just as the warring Chinese factions in the civil war preceding the Japanese invasion came to terms in the face of the foreign threat, so too did the socially divergent strata of Japanese within Shanghai come together before the Chinese assault on them. The anti-Japanese movement did not make subtle 13  Muramatsu 1991, 316–43, has a fascinating discussion with illustrations of the elaborate Japanese plans to remake the concession areas.</p>
<p>352</p>
<p>the japanese residents’ association of shanghai</p>
<p>distinctions between Japanese classes, and thus with the war the formerly differentiated community of Japanese quickly became unified. The kaishaha had to be prodded into action by the dochakuha, but when the former came around it lost no time in assuming the mantle and forging a coherent set of unified institutions in Shanghai.</p>
<p>In his annual report to the thirty-first general meeting of the Shanghai Residents’ Council on March 24, 1938, JRA Chairman Amano Masusaburō</p>
<p>seemed less concerned with the physical war than with what he termed the</p>
<p>“economic war.” He expressed concern for protecting resident Japanese, but the bulk of his speech involved a wide range of programs aimed at “revival.”</p>
<p>These included building plans for the city now under Japanese occupation, paying off the remainder of the interest-free loan to the consortium of banks, cleaning up scrap iron in the area for the military, and the like. One particularly pressing issue was the maintenance of local health standards. Cholera had claimed numerous victims in the concessions and Chinese areas of the city, and Japanese groups (military and civilian alike) were working with the JRA to prevent its spread; as of March 1938, there had not been a single Japanese case of cholera. Other illnesses, such as typhus and smallpox, were also rampant, and a Temporary Disease Prevention Committee (Rinji bōeki iinkai) was established with JRA involvement. Education also remained important to the JRA’s mandate, as the number of schoolchildren was actually starting to rise due to immigration both from other sites of Japanese residence on the mainland and from the homeland as well. Amano also announced the establishment of a</p>
<p>“Revival Fund” to offset the costs incurred during the troubles of 1937–38, once they had subsided (Shanhai kyoryū mindan 1942, 688–707).</p>
<p>When Amano returned the next year (March 23, 1939) to report to the Residents’ Council, there was a palpable, even eerie sense of peace prevail-ing within the operations of the JRA. He announced the creation in January of a Society Section (Shakaika) within the JRA, which became involved in numerous community affairs: advice, military send-offs and welcomings, military mails delivered care of the JRA, employment and housing assistance for residents and new arrivals, manning military lounges at which the men could always find a hot cup of tea, a bath, or a haircut, and welfare relief for a variety of hardships related to the war. With the continued influx of Japanese into Shanghai, there was insufficient commercial and residential space, and the schools and clinic needed to be expanded. Two new schools were opened that year, and for the first time the same compulsory education required of boys was extended to girls. There were now more Japanese schoolchildren, over 4900, than ever before, and aside from classroom space the one real problem</p>
<p>the japanese residents’ association of shanghai 353</p>
<p>in the realm of education was enticing teachers to come to Shanghai (Shanhai Koryū mindan 1942, 709–28).</p>
<p>Fukuda Chiyosaku succeeded Amano as head of the JRA in December 1939, and again in the annual report to the Residents’ Council (March 25, 1940), the war intruded in only a tangential way. The student population increased at an even higher rate in 1939 than it had before, compelling the JRA to rent additional space. In addition, they expected three new schools to open later that year. As late as 1940 the JRA was still getting some financial support from the Shanghai Municipal Council as well as a larger sum from the home government for local education. In his list of tasks for the JRA in 1940—new school construction, revision of the rules for local tax assessment, the bond for the second JRA loan, new premises for the offices of the JRA, launching an office of industrial encouragement, and expansion of the cemetery and crematorium—</p>
<p>Fukuda made no mention of the war (Shanhai kyoryū mindan 1942, 731–37).14</p>
<p>Exactly one year later, Fukuda announced to the general meeting of the Shanghai Residents’ Council that they now represented 80,000 Japanese in Shanghai, the population having more than tripled over the previous four years. He noted the February 1–3, 1940, meeting in Qingdao of the Congress of Japanese Residents of China (Zai-Shi kyoryū mindan rengō kaigi), the second of its kind, to which three Shanghai Japanese had been sent; the third meeting was held May 11–13, 1940, in Tianjin, attended by 55 representatives from eight JRAs and 23 Residents’ Councils; the fourth was scheduled for Shanghai but had to be moved to Tokyo “because of circumstances.” This Congress, it was claimed, represented 500,000 Japanese residing in China. Fukuda reiterated that support and management of schools remained the JRA’s most important work, though he invoked the Rescript on Education, “Kokutai no hongi” (Basic Principles of the National Polity), and the Greater East Asia Coprosperity Sphere, all for the first time. Perhaps this was indicative of a more nativist and isolated Japanese position. As of late 1940 there were 9894 pupils, fully twice as many as only two years earlier, and three new schools had opened to meet this need; yet another elementary school was scheduled to open in May 1941.</p>
<p>Health maintenance and disease prevention had become even more important JRA functions that year, probably because of the rising Japanese presence and increased student population. The JRA now boasted a full-fledged Hygiene Section (Hokenka). More interesting was the dissemination of health-related 14  Hashimoto 1940, 99, 100–01, describes the process by which the Street Federation sought and received funding for schools from the Shanghai Municipal Council in the late 1920s and early 1930s.</p>
<p>354</p>
<p>the japanese residents’ association of shanghai</p>
<p>knowledge. Earlier that March the JRA had sponsored a venereal disease prevention week with an evening of films and lectures; these were supplemented by radio broadcasts and the dissemination of pamphlets. Health inspections of restaurants, “rooms for rent” ( kashiseki, probably a euphemism for brothels), dance halls, and other public spaces were launched. And, a variey of vaccines and innoculations were provided to Japanese, Chinese, and other foreigners free of charge—altogether 190,000 people took advantage of these offers.</p>
<p>Also, the JRA clinic had added several new departments—dermatology, urol-ogy, and ear-nose-throat—to its existing array: internal medicine, surgery, and pediatrics. An obstetrics and gynecology department was due to be added in May 1941. For the first time since these speeches were published, the head of the JRA (dominated by the kaishaha) mentioned in a praiseworthy vein the work of the vigilance committees and the Street Federation (both decidedly dochakuha bodies) with which the JRA was involved. His citation of the latter groups’ work marks a striking example of the greater cohesion being forged within the Japanese community through a process of elite cooptation of non-elite institutions. In his summation of JRA work that year, Fukuda again made no mention of the war (Shanhai kyoryū mindan 1942, 738–52).</p>
<p>After Japanese aircraft bombed Pearl Harbor on December 8, 1941, the entire universe of Japanese life in Shanghai—and everywhere else—changed, and when Fukuda appeared several months later (March 25, 1942) before the general meeting of the Residents’ Council, his report reflected that change. All the squabbling between the Shanghai Municipal Council and the JRA, the culmination of years of efforts on the part of the Japanese to gain a greater say within the foreign communities of Shanghai, came to an abrupt halt when the Japanese army marched in and occupied the concessions. Several months earlier Imperial Prince Kan’in paid a visit to Shanghai and met with the JRA chairman. The Japanese population in Shanghai continued to soar, approaching 100,000 and necessitating the building of three new schools. However, the big story in JRA documents for early 1942 was the war that had now extended into the Pacific theater and how Shanghai was going to play its part (Shanhai kyoryū mindan 1942, 753–59).15</p>
<p>As of 1941–42, with the kaishaha-dochakuha rift about to be mended and the Japanese in control of the concessions, the JRA structure reached its most sophisticated, comprised of four bureaus ( bu) and ten sections (ka).  The Documents Section (Bunshoka) served directly under the chairman of the JRA with secretarial, personnel, and documents offices. The General Affairs Section (Shomuka) had duties including maintenance of the Japanese temples and 15  Zou Yiren 1980, 146–47, gives a 1942 Japanese population in Shanghai of 94,768, a figure that includes Koreans.</p>
<p>the japanese residents’ association of shanghai 355</p>
<p>shrines, ceremonies, elections to the Residents Council, and liaison with other groups.16 The Financial Affairs Bureau (Zaimubu) was responsible for the JRA’s budget; below it were three sections. The Tax Section (Shuzeika) oversaw four offices for property taxes, business taxes, consumption taxes, and assessments.</p>
<p>The first year that the JRA assessed taxes, 1908, a total revenue of ¥19,435.90</p>
<p>came pouring into its coffers; by 1941 it was collecting over ¥5.25 million. The Accounting Section (Kaikeika) dealt with the JRA’s bank accounts, cash dis-bursements, and fixed-term accounts. It also oversaw four offices. The Supplies Section (Chōdoka) saw to the delivery of equipment, goods, and foodstuffs, the storage of goods, the use and maintenance of utilities, and fire insurance.</p>
<p>The Education Bureau (Kyōikubu) housed an immensely complicated structure. As of April 1942 it oversaw the operation of seventeen schools (including a nursery school) and the largest budget by far of any division within the JRA.</p>
<p>The Society Section had seven clearly identifiable tasks before it: protection and relief for the poor and homeless; comfort and advice for wounded Japanese troops soon to be repatriated; an employment agency to help find work for the thousands of new immigrants from Japan or elsewhere on the mainland; creation and operation of an office for postal life insurance; a housing office to help those arriving from Japan and for those whose homes or offices or factories had been damaged in the fighting; management of two Shanghai parks; and the identification of Koreans in Shanghai, who had had their own residents’ association since 1933, so as to better integrate them into the work of the JRA. The Hygiene Section oversaw four offices, administered vaccines for a variety of diseases, and dealt with the remains of deceased Japanese. The Building Repairs Section (Eizenka) was only founded in May 1942 to deal with the large influx of new students, which required the building of new schools and continued maintenance of the many others. The JRA Clinic continued to grow and add new wings, new departments, and new doctors. The Revival Fund Bureau (Fukken shikinbu) was concerned with collecting money to help local Japanese businessmen rebuild their shops, store, offices, and factories after years of sustaining anti-Japanese attacks (Shanhai kyoryō mindan 1942, 897–98, 900–06, 908–11, 931–34, 936–39, 981, 983, 984–90, 992, 995, 997–1003, 1008, 1011, 1015, 1022, 1024–31, 1035–36).</p>
<p>Finally, the Bureau of Civil Affairs (Shiminbu) represented the culmination of the new JRA structure. On June 1, 1941, the Japanese Street Federation of Shanghai was ordered dissolved and formally integrated into the JRA. Ten days 16  The Street Federation seems to have played a particularly important role in the maintenance of the Shanghai Shinto Shrine; its area was proudly expanded in 1940 to commemorate the year 2600, allegedly dating back to the year in which the legendary Emperor Jinmu ascended the throne. See Hashimoto 1940, 89, 150.</p>
<p>356</p>
<p>the japanese residents’ association of shanghai</p>
<p>later all of the neighborhood associations and vigilance committees were similarly placed under the administrative structure of the JRA, each with offices within the Bureau of Civil Affairs. These offices embraced the work of thousands of Japanese at the street level. This was all part of a larger plan to forge the greatest possible cohesion within a community both growing and under siege. In response to the crisis of world war, on January 1, 1942, Japanese Consul-General Horiuchi Tateki formally launched the work of the Total Strength Patriotic Association of Shanghai (Shanhai sōryoku hōkoku kai) with board members from a host of local institutions and with the JRA—together with the Japanese Chamber of Commerce, youth groups, the Asian Development Board (Kō-A in), the consulate, and other bodies—forming its core (Shanhai kyoryū</p>
<p>mindan 1942, 1047–48, 1280–84, 1285).</p>
<p>Interestingly, in the process of attempting to forge this unity through a stark program of centralization, the JRA, the consulate, and other elite bodies managed to completely co-opt the groups formerly run by dochakuha leaders in a much more independent manner. In a sense, the stark necessities of the war made it impossible for the rivalries internal to the Japanese community to continue. The elite kaishaha  backed by such bodies as the Gaimushō simply took over direction of the self-defense structure created and operated up to that time for several decades by dochakuha people. In a more fundamental sense, though, this development represented the final playing out of the class struggle within the Japanese community of Shanghai, and, as is usually the case, the elite won. Only the elite were in a position to call in the needed protection, should Japan’s enemies launch a full-scale assault on Shanghai. Their victory would be short-lived, however.</p>
<p>**Other **</p>
<p>**JRAs in China: The Distinctiveness of the Japanese **</p>
<p><strong>Experience in Shanghai</strong></p>
<p>Japan had concession areas in a number of other Chinese cities, and JRAs were founded in many. What, if anything, made the Shanghai JRA’s experience unique? How did the Japanese experience in Shanghai, where they did not establish their own concession, differ from cities in which they did? Though little research has been done on the resident Japanese population in these other sites, some suggestive comparisons can be offered. The Sino-Japanese Protocol of October 1896 permitted the Japanese to set up concessions in Shanghai, Tianjin, Xiamen, and Hankou; the “Residents’ Association Law”</p>
<p>of March 1905 led to the establishment in 1907 of JRAs in Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, Niuzhuang, Andong, and elsewhere.</p>
<p>the japanese residents’ association of shanghai 357</p>
<p>One interesting issue is the level of integration with the local Chinese community. A Japanese consulate first appeared in Tianjin in 1875, when the resident population was miniscule. When space was allocated for the Japanese concession there in August 1898, there were still only 52 Japanese in the city; by the time that space was expanded less than five years later in April 1903, there were 1311. The area of the concessions had no previous history of residence; it was effectively built from the ground up, and Chinese were never forced to leave that area. Many Chinese actually served on the Japanese Residents’ Council of Tianjin. In 1914—when there were 1687 Japanese in the city—there were more Chinese on the Residents’ Council than Japanese. Little is known about these Chinese at this point, save that they were primarily wealthy businessmen and their families. The system of selection to the Council was changed in late 1917, when it was deemed that a majority of the 32 Council members had to be Japanese and the operative language of meetings was made Japanese, but Chinese—wealthy Chinese, to be sure—continued to have some say in local affairs. Hankou’s system closely resembled that of Tianjin, though its Residents’ Council had only twenty members (Katsuragawa 1994, 353, 358–59; Ueda 1941, 316–17, 320, 323, 726; Kimura 1993, 30–31, 36, 39; Soejima 1984, 19; see also Peattie 1989, 176–81, for general information on Japanese settlement in Hankou and Tianjin).</p>
<p>Nothing remotely comparable can be cited from the experience of the Shanghai JRA—Chinese were never involved, and Chinese feelings were near the bottom of the list of its concerns. Several reasons for this difference may be suggested. As latecomers to the Sino-foreign world of Shanghai, the Japanese were always playing a game of catch-up, adapting their life in the city both to a world created by other foreigners vis-à-vis the Chinese and to life back home—and the other foreigners were similarly busy replicating in Shanghai the life of their respective metropoles. With the rare exception of a Silas Hardoon or an Uchiyama Kanzō, few residents of the Shanghai concessions had anything to do with Chinese outside of business arrangements and looked down on them all. Also, by the time the Japanese became seriously involved in Shanghai life, there was no surfeit of land to share with the surrounding and growing Chinese population. The Japanese concession in Tianjin was built on virgin terrain, a situation impossible to replicate in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Another issue dividing the urban experiences in Shanghai and Tianjin was the fluidity and size of the local Japanese population. The Japanese population of Tianjin grew steadily to roughly 4000 by the end of World War One and to 6289 by 1932. In 1936, on the eve of the Sino-Japanese War, it ballooned to 11,590. Thus, aside from the sharp increases in the first years of the century and in 1935, Tianjin’s Japanese community exhibited a more stable</p>
<p>358</p>
<p>the japanese residents’ association of shanghai</p>
<p>demographic growth than Shanghai; it was apparently a less fluid population. Hankou was home to only 37 Japanese in 1898 when Shanghai Consul-General Odagiri Masunosuke and Secretary Funatsu Tatsuichirō were sent to the city to negotiate the opening of a concession with Hu-Guang Governor-General Zhang Zhidong. Although that number had increased to 1229 in 1910, it dropped sharply the next year to nearly half that number as a result of the 1911 Revolution; by 1912 it had recuperated to 1337. Prior to the outbreak of the war, the Japanese population continued to rise slowly, though it never exceeded 3000 and in fact fell off in the late 1920s and early 1930s. By 1939 it soared to nearly 6000 (Ueda 1941, 343, 729; Katsuragawa 1994, 359–61; Soejima 1984, 25).17 Thus, Hankou too was a city with a fairly stable resident Japanese presence before the Marco Polo Bridge Incident. Shanghai’s Japanese population, by contrast, did not experience such stability. It shot up precipitously from the late 1930s, much like the Japanese populations of Harbin, Shenyang, and Changchun, which increased dramatically over the course of the 1930s.</p>
<p>The latter cities—all in Manchuria—undoubtedly grew as a result of an influx of carpetbaggers, following the Japanese military seizure of the Northeast. The case of Shanghai remains unstudied in necessary detail, but it would appear that there was both an inflow of new residents from the homeland as well as immigrants fleeing smaller Japanese communities elsewhere on the mainland for the relative security of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Yet another issue would be the centrality of business concerns to the local Japanese in different urban Chinese settings. As in Shanghai, the foundation of the Japanese community in Tianjin, Qingdao, and Hankou was business. After the suppression of the Boxers, large numbers of Japanese small- and medium-sized entrepreneurs flocked to Tianjin in particular. Inasmuch as the concession was to be built from scratch, Japanese in the construction trades also flooded into the city to avail themselves of the new opportunities. Several years later during the Russo-Japanese War, Tianjin businessmen produced goods for both armies, and this in turn spurred a boom in the local economy. Between 1905 and the 1911 Revolution, the Tianjin-Japanese trade increased 20 percent 17  By way of comparison, the cities of largest Japanese concentration in Manchuria, such as Changchun, Fengtian (present-day Shenyang), and Harbin, also experienced sharp increases in the mid-1930s. Changchun’s resident Japanese population rose from 17,382 in 1930 to 83,911 in 1937; Fengtian’s numbers rose from 46,000 in 1930 to 142,020 seven years later; and Harbin’s Japanese population rose from 4306 to 43,010 over the same period, nearly a tenfold increase. See Soejima 1984, 10, 14, 15. Discovering what percentage of these were carpetbaggers remains a scholarly desideratum.</p>
<p>the japanese residents’ association of shanghai 359</p>
<p>to 30 percent annually, with half of all Japanese-made imports still in Chinese hands (Katsuragawa 1994, 361–63).</p>
<p>One stark difference between the Japanese communities in Shanghai and Tianjin is illustrated by the following case. In 1908 a group of Reservists in Tianjin sought permission from the JRA to organize a band of Japanese Volunteers. The JRA denied their request for four reasons: it was “improper”</p>
<p>to discuss questions of self-defense vis-à-vis the Chinese in the Residents’</p>
<p>Council while Chinese were part of that group; such “a military action” in the face of a nonpressing situation was “disagreeable with respect to China’s feelings”; reliance on the Japanese troops stationed in Tianjin was sufficient for the defense of the Japanese residents; and there was no JRA budget for it. The first two reasons are especially interesting, since there seems to have been something of a Sino-Japanese partnership based on trust—at least as perceived by the Japanese at the time—which a band of Volunteers would have harmed, a situation virtually unthinkable in Shanghai.</p>
<p>A Volunteers group was formed briefly in 1913, in the disorder immediately following the Republican Revolution of late 1911, and again in 1925, when the civil war and warlord clashes inundated the Tianjin area. In the latter instance, the JRA felt that the Tianjin army was inadequate to the task of keeping local order and protecting local Japanese, now a much larger group. The Volunteers were charged with assisting the Tianjin army and serving as interpreters, but never with assuming a position as the main Japanese military force in the city.</p>
<p>They were to protect the local Japanese against the violence and depreda-tions of warlord armies and also against the rising anti-Japanese movement.</p>
<p>Vigilance committees had been formed “for self-defense and self-protection”</p>
<p>in Shanghai in the wake of the anti-Japanese response to the Twenty-one Demands in 1915; Tianjin’s Volunteers served a similar function. A May 1927</p>
<p>meeting of the Tianjin Residents’ Council formally established the Volunteers because, as they put it, “the situation in Tianjin has become extremely critical”</p>
<p>(Katsuragawa 1994, 385–6).</p>
<p>Thus, although the JRA experience in Tianjin and Shanghai got off to sharply different starts, they ultimately evolved in similar directions.18 There was, 18  One fascinating comparison is with the various Japanese residents’ associations of Manchuria that were ordered disbanded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the mid-1930s, because the government did not want the other nationalities in the new nation of Manzhouguo (Manchukuo) to feel unfairly discriminated against. In Manzhouguo all ethnic groups were supposed to live in gozoku kyōwa (harmony of the five ethnic groups).</p>
<p>The plan was to incorporate all the residents’ associations into the Kyōwakai or Concordia Society. In the case of Harbin, the local Japanese military actually feared that the</p>

<p>though, no event in Tianjin comparable to the Shanghai Incident, in which local groups were complicit in widespread massacres. Again, perhaps because Japan was a latecomer to the imperialist life in Shanghai and was always struggling with the other powers for respectability, tensions with the Chinese there were higher than elsewhere in China. By the 1920s, Shanghai had become the effective capital of China. It was not only the jewel in the imperialist crown, but it was also the place where anti-imperialist Chinese frequently centered their activities. It was thus the exception to all the rules of Sino-foreign interactions.</p>
<p>By the same token, neither Tianjin nor any other Chinese city could ever rival Shanghai as a commercial and business center; even by the late 1930s, the Japanese population of Tianjin was still only a fraction of that in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Interestingly, while Shanghai had no formal Japanese concession, that by no means meant that the Japanese community was better integrated into local life; if anything, it was more isolated in Shanghai than elsewhere. Why the Japanese never established a concession remains a mystery, unless it can be attributed simply to fears of alienating the other foreign establishments in Shanghai. However, its absence had the interesting effect not of driving the Japanese into the arms, figuratively speaking, of the Chinese, but of the people the Japanese truly sought to emulate: the other foreign powers.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, as Chinese nationalism appeared on the horizon and found its primary focus in all manner of Japanese activity on the mainland, resident Japanese felt they had no choice but to seek self-defense through vigilante groups. What Tianjin Japanese had earlier taken to be a relationship with the Chinese of trust and equity was, of course, nothing of the kind; it was a trade system based on unequal treaties, extraterritoriality, and institutional-ized discrimination against the Chinese. As Chinese nationalism and the anti-Japanese movement grew, Japan’s response was to see China as the enemy.</p>
<p>The use of boycotts—the breaking of economic ties or refusal to acknowledge them—was a great shock to Japanese in Tianjin. In the end the Tianjin concession armed itself and sought financial and military help from Tokyo—just like their fellow nationals in Shanghai.</p>
<p>One important factor that unified the various Japanese communities in China and set them off, especially in Shanghai, from the other major foreign settlers was the simple fact that the Japanese comprised the only significant Asian continued existence of the JRA would lead to “ethnic animosities” ( minzokuteki tairitsu) .  This met with resistance on the part of local Japanese, but the Ministry prevailed.</p>
<p>See Gaimushō Archives, file K3.2.2.1–32, reports of June 16, 1935; December 14, 1937; October 25, 1937; January 21, 1938; May 24, 1938; June 18, 1938; and August 17, 1938.</p>

<p>community. They** **were thus at once neither Chinese nor European in lifestyle or habit. The Westerners only came to respect the Japanese when political circumstances made it impossible to do otherwise, which served to make life in Shanghai, and presumably elsewhere in China proper, seem even more alien.</p>
<p>Japanese did, as we have seen, attempt to recreate home abroad, but that ultimately only intensified the sense of separation. None of the Japanese, not even the wealthiest in the kaishaha, lived in the grand style of the richer Europeans, only two Japanese reportedly ever joined the International Club of Shanghai, and few Japanese—mostly left-wing intellectuals and writers—seem to have participated in the active cafe society of the International Settlement.</p>
<p>“Shanghai-Japan” thus did not mean a close bond between the Japanese people and the Chinese residents of its largest city. In fact, it meant virtually the opposite: a tie linking Japan with the center of East Asian imperialism and the other powers. It was a sign of Japanese separateness from the Chinese. The Japanese decision not to construct their own concession after 1895 also speaks to the fact that the Japanese had made a firm choice to affiliate with the extant foreign communities and their concessions in the city. “Shanghai-Japan” was not a socially unified force from the start, but developed a fractured social structure of two factions at odds with one another. However, as relations with the Chinese deteriorated, the Japanese groups quickly healed their differences in an effort to forge the greatest possible unity in the face of Chinese anti-Japanese actions. Thus, as the Japanese community of Shanghai outstripped all the other foreign populations combined several times over, its isolation only continued to grow. And, as the Japanese community of Shanghai outnumbered all such communities in China proper, it never attained anything remotely similar to the amicable ties that characterized the Japanese experience in Tianjin and elsewhere other than Shanghai.</p>
<p>One interesting difference between Japanese on mainland Asia and those at home was that, during the war years, the Japanese in Shanghai, Tianjin, and elsewhere in China relied on the Japanese military to protect them and, until the last week of the war, they were protected. Thus, their relationship with the Japanese military was based on real-life experiences. They had called for their government to send troops to protect them, and they had received military protection. By contrast, the same cannot be said of Japanese on the home islands, who had the same expectations for their defense and got fire-bombing and nuclear weapons in return.</p>
