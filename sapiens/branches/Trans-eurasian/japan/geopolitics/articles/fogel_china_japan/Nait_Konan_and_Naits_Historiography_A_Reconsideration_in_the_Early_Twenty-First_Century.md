In English the term “Japanese Sinology” might be translated into Chinese as either 日本漢學 or 日本的中國硏究, and it covers as much or even more 

than the Chinese expressions. It can mean Japanese studies of Chinese history and culture, or Japanese exegeses of the Chinese classics throughout the ages, or in fact any instance in which one examines Japanese approaches to or responses to Chinese civilization from antiquity through the present. My own work has tended to fall within the first category: Japanese studies of Chinese history, and it is to this general subject that I shall address my remarks today. 

Some years ago, I spent a great deal of time studying the writings of the celebrated Japanese historian, Naitō Konan 內藤湖南, Torajirō 虎次郞 \(1866–

1934\), and the school of Sinology he helped to build at Kyoto University early in the last century. What I soon learned—this is an obvious point—is that I could not simply read his many writings on Chinese history and culture and then write an analysis of them. Rather, I had to immerse myself in the period in which he wrote, roughly the 1880s through the years just prior to his death in the early 1930s—namely, mid-Meiji 明治 through early Shōwa 昭和 Japan. 

I also came to understand that I would have to read his writings on Japanese history, because the historical and cultural relationship between China and Japan were central to his entire project as a scholar. 

The result was a book that I have never been entirely satisfied with: Politics and Sinology: The Case of Naitō Konan \(1866–1934\) which was translated into Japanese as: 《內藤湖南、ポリティックスとシノロジー》. Unsatisfied 

for two reasons. First, there were several areas of Chinese culture to which he had devoted considerable attention and which I was unable to find a way of addressing in the book. These would include Chinese art history and Chinese historiography; in both of these scholarly areas, he wrote eminent books and articles.

Naitō Konan and Naitō’s Historiography

Second, in the 1970s and early 1980s, I was still writing in a defensive mode. 

With the exception of a handful of his most famous disciples—such as Miyazaki Ichisada 宮崎市定 \(1901–1995\) and Yoshikawa Kōjirō 吉川幸次郞 

\(1904–1980\)—who continued to laud their professor, the influence of the war years was still strong when I was doing my work, and this meant that Naitō was still associated with all things Japanese in China and that meant aggression against China. If I wanted to say anything even remotely positive about his theories, I had to first try to overcome the negative image that had developed around much of the scholarship associated with him in postwar Japan. 

The first postwar articles written about Naitō were highly condemnatory and found the roots of imperialism in every one of his famous theories. Thus, to give just one example, while Naitō may have argued that China entered modernity over a millenium ago at the start of the Song dynasty, that only meant in his harshest critics’ eyes that he thought China had stagnated in modernity for those many centuries. I knew this was all wildly exaggerated, but I had to argue from a defensive posture, all the time knowing equally well that there were, of course, political aspects about his life and career that were tainted with Japanese imperialism. 

This situation has all now happily changed. I would like in my talk today to first address reasons why the mood has changed, look at some of the newer work on Naitō that has appeared in recent years, and then take a fresh close look at one of the two areas I was unable to address in my book twenty-five years ago, his work in the field of Chinese historiography. 

**What Has Changed**

I think the most important thing that has changed since I first began reading and writing about Naitō Konan has been unrelated to changes within Japan. 

Interestingly, since the death of Mao Zedong and the commencement of the Four Modernizations, Mainland Chinese authors have rediscovered Naitō 

on their own, as have scholars in Taiwan over the past decade or more. I say 

“rediscovered” because Naitō had many Chinese colleagues and associates before his death, especially during his years at Kyoto University. A number of his essays were translated into Chinese, and his views were recognized-not necessarily always agreed with, but recognized-as sufficiently significant as to warrant their attention. In the prewar world of Sinological studies by serious scholars as opposed to, shall we say, more popular or journalistic writers such

as Liang Qichao1—Chinese and Japanese had reached a level of interaction are only now, once again, approaching. I would even argue that one of the reasons many of Naitō’s books were never translated in Chinese was that most serious Chinese scholars could read them in the original. 

In the immediate postwar years, when memories of World War II were still extremely fresh, many leftwing Japanese academics returned to teaching positions at Japan’s many universities. Under the American Occupation of Japan through 1952 and well after it, scholars who had supported the Japanese government or espoused rightist, imperialist ideas were removed from their posts. 

Thus, the entire first generation of Japanese scholars—and not only in Asian studies—were far to the left of center. In addition, a significant number had survived during the war years not by having gone into exile, as did so many leftwing and Jewish German academics, but by hiding their views from the spot-light or actually working for an agency of the Japanese government or military in China, such as one of the research organs of the South Manchurian Railway Company. In either case, they were deeply burdened with a sense of guilt for what they saw as acts of complicity with the Japanese war machine. Two of the more prominent ways these men and women worked to exorcise their demons was by virulently attacking all prewar Japanese scholarship on China for being completely compromised by the imperialist Japanese government and army, and by profoundly associating themselves with the Chinese revolution on the mainland which was nearing success soon after the war’s end. A significant number later left the Japan Communist Party when it broke with the Chinese Communist Party—out of sympathy for the latter. 

One example of this postwar condemnatory approach to the work of Naitō Konan was an essay by Nohara Shirō 野原四郞 published in 1946: 



〈內藤湖南支那論批判〉

.2 Nohara took aim at Naitō’s most famous work, 

《支那論》, which was first published in 1914 shortly after the fall of the Qing dynasty. Despite the apparent chaos of the early Republican era, and in the face of Japanese critics claiming that disorder was both the natural culmination of modern China and a perfect excuse for international dismember-ment of China, Naitō argued vehemently that republicanism \(共和主義\) was the historically-determined future for China—and, he strongly implied, 1  See 桑兵, “Japan and Liang Qichao’s Research in the Field of National Learning,” trans.

Naitō Konan and Naitō’s Historiography

China was the future for the East Asian region as a whole.3 That would seem like a highly positive assessment which should have earned Naitō great praise in the postwar years. However, Nohara 野原 and others like him decided that virtually every point in《支那論》was worthy of nothing short of abject condemnation. Where Naitō saw a grassroots basis for republicanism in China at the village level run by elders \(父老\) without the intercession of the central government, a process which had matured over the centuries since the Song dynasty and the end of aristocracy, Nohara 野原 found nothing but “local bullies and evil gentry” \(土豪劣紳\).Where Naitō argued that Chinese had transcended the age of the nation-state and no longer conceptualized the nation as such, Nohara 野原 argued that he was merely concocting an excuse for others, namely Japan, to step in and rule—thus, Nohara 野原 claimed, by identifying the elders \(父老\) as the kernel of Chinese society, Naitō was effectively providing Japanese imperialists with the key to conquering China. To be sure, Naitō 

did argue in favor of China relinquishing control of its national government to a consortium of international powers, so that the Chinese people would not be burdened with the cost of a national defense and would not have to worry about corruption at the level of the central government. Nohara 野原 claimed that this was actually core of Naitō’s argument. 

Nohara’s 野原’s claims were, needless to say, very much caught up in the era in which they were written, the immediate postwar period. It should no longer take us much time to see that they were exaggerated, often wildly off the mark, and more concerned with a larger, self-cleansing process as Japanese scholars of Chinese history and culture faced the extremely difficult task of coming to terms with their own prewar heritage. Being a major figure of that prewar heritage, perhaps it is only natural that Naitō would come under attack. It is also important that Naitō was decidedly not a leftist or Marxist in any sense. Indeed, he described the principal reason for the failure of the Taiping Rebellion to be its “communism” \(共產主義\), namely its communitarian structure which directly conflicted with the structure of rural Chinese village life controlled by elders \(父老\). Hence, the Taiping leaders failed to understand the basic structure of Chinese society and were thus doomed to end in defeat. Naitō wrote admiringly of local Chinese society and his antipathy for what he called “communism” \(共產主義\) was just below the surface. This cannot have sat well with postwar Marxists critics of his work. 

I have singled out one essay by Nohara Shirō 野原四郞, but there were many other similar works which found Japanese imperialism peeking out from every thesis pounded out by Naitō. The other glaring fault these critics found 3  內藤湖南，“支那論”，《內藤湖南全集》（東京：筑摩書房、1972年）第5卷

265

in his work was the putative claim that Chinese history had stagnated. As I have noted, if modernity began in the tenth or eleventh centuries, and China was still modern in the nineteenth century, then it must have stagnated. I have been unable to find any treatment of this subject in Naitō’s written work, but it nonetheless became a hallmark of the postwar critique of him—even reflected faintly in Western scholarship.4 While still in his mid-twenties, Saeki Yūichi 佐伯有一 \(b. 1932\) found time, in the midst of a 1957 article on Japanese scholarship concerned with Ming-Qing economic history, to lambast Naitō 

for eviscerating China's historical dynamism by propounding stagnancy at the hallmark of the past millenium.5 Again, this was wildly exaggerated. 

In the immediate postwar decades in Japan, the statement that someone had ever claimed stagnancy or backwardness in China was an incendiary one. 

This was not only a time when the Chinese revolution was very fresh, but it was also a time when Japanese scholars were doing everything in their power to give China back a history—a normal history—that they perceived had been taken away by the theories of prewar Japanese scholars. In Marxist terms—

terms which dominated the postwar debate—that meant that China had to be fitted back onto the unilinear track toward a glorious socialist future, just like other “normal” countries. We see concerns even in the highly refined scholarship of such an exalted figure as Niida Noboru 仁井田陞 \(1904–1966\) who, writing in the 1950s, sought to locate and analyze in great depth a distinctive feudal period for China; in so doing, Chinese history would acquire periodization, and the engines of history would once again be chugging down their one-way tracks.6

Thus, despite his extraordinary contributions to the topic of periodizing Chinese history, his absence of comment on the topic of stagnation, and indeed his criticism of the Japanese military adventures in Manchuria in the 4  This view was even reflected in English-language writing about Japanese views of China where Naitō’s name would appear as someone who, to cite one example, “popularized ‘unchanging China’ . . . \[and\] wrote persuasively of China’s backwardness, stagnation, and corruption, and tended to create an image of a land in which any change, including a reversal to earlier, more traditional conditions would be preferable.” See Marius Jansen, “Changing Japanese Attitude Toward Modernization,” in Changing Japanese Attitude Toward Modernization, ed. Marius Jansen \(Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1972\), pp. 838–84.

Naitō Konan and Naitō’s Historiography

early 1930s,7 Naitō and his work became the objects of severe vituperation in the first postwar decades. In the process, the baby was almost thrown out with the bath- water; that is, the “bad” parts of Naitō’s writings seemed so offensive that all of his writings became, in some quarters at least, all but taboo for a period of time. Kyoto scholars continued to admire his work; some of the older generation who had studied with him at the end of his career and the beginning of their own remembered his work fondly, but with a handful of exceptions, there were no strong rebuttals to the condemnatory mood for some time.8

The situation began to change in the early 1980s primarily, I believe, because Mainland Chinese scholars found so much of value in Naitō’s extremely rich body of writings. In a P.R.C. publication for internal consumption \(內部\), the journal《中國史硏究動態》, Professor Xia Yingyuan 夏應元, now retired 

but who was then at the Institute of History of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences \(中國社會科學院·歷史硏究所\), published an essay entitled: 



〈內藤湖南的中國史硏究〉

.9 It was a short piece but, unlike so many essays 

in Japan, it curiously did not dwell on the imperialist implications of Naitō’s writings; rather, it introduced his main theories, such as his famous periodization scheme, and expressed great admiration for their author. Many years before in 1934, the year of Naitō’s death, a then young Zhou Yiliang 周一良  

\(1913–2001\) published a longer and more erudite essay about Naitō’s scholarly work, based on his own college graduation thesis, in the journal《史學 

年報》.10 When he returned to China after World War II from Harvard University, where he tutored many Americans in Japanese,11 Zhou taught Japanese history to several generations of Chinese students at Beijing University. 

Xia’s article basically picked up this thread after nearly half a century.

Naitō Konan and Naitō’s Historiography

267

As with Xia’s essay, notably absent from Zhou’s work—and virtually ubiquitous in all Japanese writing on the subject of Naitō’s work—was mention of imperialism, stagnation, and the like; and Zhou was writing only a few years after the Manchurian Incident. Indeed, when I met both men over the course of the late 1980s and early 1990s, they affirmed the view for me that, in their separate estimations, Naitō was simply a great scholar. I shall return to this theme momentarily. 

Another important change leading to the resuscitation of Naitō and his ideas about Chinese history does have to do with changes within Japan. It concerns the generational change within Japanese academia since the conclusion of World War II and the paradigm shift in approaches to Chinese historical and cultural research. As the immediate postwar generation has passed on either through retirement or death, a younger generation has not been as infatu-ated with Marxism—or at least with the overdetermined manner in which Marxism was frequently used to emplot Chinese history, finding feudalism here and capitalism \(or its “sprouts” 萌芽\) there. 

I would point to the early 1980s as the moment when this change was first being identified—again, this was when I was putting the finishing touches on my book about Naitō Konan 內藤湖南. In a collection of essays edited by Professor 谷川道雄 \(b. 1925\) entitled《中國士大夫階級と地域社會との

關係についての總合的硏究》, Professor 谷川 and his colleagues made 

clear what Tanigawa 谷川 had been more subtly working on in his own period of expertise, Chinese history from Wei-Jin 魏晉 through fang.12 Namely, they were all arguing from their various places in Chinese history that there was something more basic to the fabric of Chinese history that social classes as understood by Marxism, and they called this phenomenon the local social community: sometimes “local society” \(地域社會\) and more frequently “local community” \(共同體\). This term is an expression with a long and complex history within Japanese scholarship; even its association with Japanese studies of Chinese history is complex. Professor Tanigawa 谷川 had been for many years dissatisfied by the rigid mold into which Japanese Marxist Sinologists had forced China’s historical experience. He proposed several decades earlier that Sinologists move beyond class to assess local Chinese society, and he was roundly attacked by the dominant Marxist establishment for his 12  谷川道雄編、《中國士大夫階級と地域社會との關係についての總合的硏究》

efforts.13 However, he never gave up, and his views have now produced many disciples and adherents over the years. His late colleague at Kyoto University, Kawakatsu Yoshio 川勝義雄 \(1922–1984\), was a longtime partner in moving the discussion beyond simplistic class analysis. 

Fascinating for me is that Tanigawa’s 谷川 concept of “local community” as a term for the structure of local Chinese society very closely resembles a concept used by Naitō:〈鄕團〉. When I suggested this relationship to Professor Tanigawa 谷川 in the mid-1980s, he was very happy that the connection had been recognized. He has since spent a great deal of time studying Naitō’s works and even organizing a citizen’s group of men from various occupations within the Kyoto area to read works by Naitō together. He also organized a 內藤湖南

硏究會 of scholars from around Japan, and they recently published under his editorship:《內藤湖南の世界：アジア再生の思想》.14 A look through 

the essays in this book, which includes one Chinese author, reveals that these scholars are no longer obsessed with pigeon-holing Naitō or assessing him solely on the basis of “imperialism.” Naitō has now become a figure in intellectual history with some fascinating ideas about Chinese history—some of those ideas may still work and some may not. 

In other words, he is no longer being used as a “whipping boy” or a sacrificial animal onto whom all the sins of the prewar era may be put and exorcised. 

Perhaps, then, the time is right to take a fresh look at his extraordinary history of Chinese historical thought. 

**A Fresh Look at Naitō’s Work in the Field of Chinese Historiography** Several years ago, the long series of books put out by the publisher Heibonsha \(平凡社\) in conjunction with the Tōyō bunko \(東洋文庫\) reissued Naitō’s 13  He first raised his own doubts about labeling the Tang period as “ancient”（古代）at the annual meeting of the 歷史學硏究會 in 1955. In several essays of the 1960s, he suggested that scholarly advances were been severely held back because of the stranglehold of the periodization schemes being imposed on Chinese history by orthodox Marxist theory.

extraordinary work,《支那史學史》.15 This work was the result of lectures delivered at Kyoto Imperial University in the 1910s, and the reader quickly realizes something which is as true now as it was over eighty years ago when Naitō 

first delivered these lectures: not only was there no easy way for him to have organized the raw material for his talks, but even more astonishing is the fact that there were no libraries with easy access to all the major works of Chinese historiography. Naitō had to all the work as he went along. This very fat book was thus not only the first of its kind in any language; it has even today not been superceded, and that is surely why Heibonsha thought it could republish the book and earn money. I would like now to briefly examine the basic arguments of this book. Not many books can still be read with profit nearly a century after they were first published. An investigation of this one may help explain why it is still such an extraordinarily valuable work. 

The single most important debate which Naitō saw informing the entire history of Chinese historical writing—and one which tells us a great deal about his own sense of what was important in historical research—was between a comprehensive approach to history \(tongshi 通史\) and a single-period approach \(duandaishi 斷代史\). Although he found some merit in the latter and admired several historians who advocated it, he was an unabashed partisan of the former and of the great Chinese historians who had adopted it in their work. 

Thus, after 100 pages 01: his《支那史學史》analyzing every known pre-Han text and fragment then in existence for its historical content and every known commentary on them, it is with the Shiji 史記 of Sima Qian 司馬遷 

\(135?–93 bce\) that Naitō identified the true emergence of conscious history writing in China. After the disorder of the Warring States era, there was a general tendency in the Han toward the unification of thought, and Naitō saw the 史記 as the result of efforts to unify the historical records that had accumulated to that point in time. Unlike his father, Sima Tan 司馬談 \(d. 110 bce\), from whom he inherited the work of compiling the 史記, 司馬遷 fell heavily under the influence of Dong Zhongshu 董仲舒 \(179?–104? bce\) and the Gongyang tradition 公羊傳. Naitō interestingly argued that, while the 史記 is not what we might accept as history today, it is factually what we demand of history writing. It was decidedly not like its contemporaries-works which compiled events to serve a sovereign’s needs; the 史記 was thus not born simply out of the “demands of the times” but out of 司馬遷’s own great genius.16

Naitō Konan and Naitō’s Historiography

Such an evaluation might seem rather quaint and certainly old-fashioned in our overly critical age, but let us momentarily give Naitō the benefit of the doubt and look at just what he identified as 司馬遷’s “genius.” First and foremost, it was the use of a comprehensive approach to history which implied an understanding that history did not simply begin in a given year when one sovereign ascended the throne or a new dynasty commenced and end when that ruler or regime left power. As 司馬遷 seemed to clearly understand, history was a process involving change over a long, long time span: the entirety of the known past. 司馬遷 saw himself, perhaps exaggeratedly, as the heir to a daotong 道統 that went from the Duke of Zhou 周公 through Confucius to himself.17 Like his father, though, 司馬遷 believed that the historian’s task was a hereditary commitment to speak the truth—irrespective of the consequences—and thus to explain how history had culminated in the present, the Han dynasty. 

Naitō felt that the 史記 had not been appreciated in its day, largely because it was followed by the Han shu 漢書 of Ban Gu 班固 \(32–92\), a single-era history that set the mold for much of the history writing that followed. Only at a much later date were the contributions of the 史記 recognized. Naitō 

reserved special praise for Shao Jinhan’s 邵晉涵 \(1743–1796\) penetrating analysis of the text.18 It was Zhang Xuecheng 章學誠 \(1738–1801\), though, who first understood the great importance of 司馬遷 work as a whole, and it was Naitō Konan who brought Zhang and his writings out of oblivion in the early twentieth century.19

One thing Naitō criticized 司馬遷 for was the latter’s apparent effort to explain historical events in a rational manner but then to use rational explanation to elucidate legendary events, such as the fatherless births of the founders of the Shang and Zhou dynasties. Perhaps, this reveals the influence of the 

“scientific approach” to historiography not ordinarily associated with Naitō

and the Kyoto School of Sinology. Still, Naitō argued that 司馬遷 was China’s first comprehensive historian and he was not fully appreciated until much later in history. 

A number of scholars did appreciate the 史記 and sought to continue it beyond the reign of Han Wudi 漢武帝 \(r. 140–86 bce\), the point at which Sima Qian had stopped. The Later Han 後漢 historian Ban Biao 班彪 \(3–54\) was not impressed by these sequels and decided instead to write a history of the Former Han dynasty. In form he followed the 史記 but there was the all-important difference that his work no longer encompassed the full run of history, but was to be the history of a single era which, upon his death, his son Ban Gu completed. Although later praised by such critics as Liu Zhiji 劉知幾 

\(661–721\) of the Tang for setting the mold that subsequent dynastic histories would follow, others such as Zheng Qiao 鄭樵 \(1104–1162\) of the Song levelled a stinging attack on it for precisely the same reason. Zheng argued that Ban Gu, despite his claim of admiration for the 史記 clearly could simply not have understood its central message that only a complete history from antiquity through the present could ever capture the complexity of causation in the historical process.20

This was effectively Naitō’s position as well and thus explains his extraordinary praise for Zheng’s work. Thus, he clearly identified Sima Qian’s greatness in his adoption of a tong  通 approach to history from gu 古 to 近 .  In the subsequent few centuries many different kinds of works would appear written in various styles, and the rivalry continued for some time between 通史 and 斷代史. In fact, the number of historical works grew so large that by Tang times China’s first historical critic, 劉知幾, emerged to write his famous Shi tong 

 《史通》. Despite his title, though, Liu favored the 漢書 or 斷代史 approach to history writing, and, as Naitō put it, failed to appreciate the subtleties of the 史記.21

Skipping ahead to an important turning point in Chinese history, we find that one of the longest chapters in Naitō’s 《支那史學史》 concerns the Song dynasty, second only to his chapter covering the Qing. He argued that the change in historical compilation techniques can be seen in the differences between the Jiu Tang shu 《舊唐書》 and the Xin Tang shu 《新唐書》. The former was written between the Later Tang 後唐 and Later Jin 後晉 states of the Five Dynasties 五代 era and included copious amounts of material 20  內藤湖南，《支那史學史》《內藤湖南全集》第11卷、頁136–138。

verbatim from Tang sources. By contrast, the latter was the work of two men, Ouyang Xiu 歐陽修 \(1007–1072\) and Song Qi 宋祁 \(998–1061\), who rewrote the history of the Tang era in the ancient style, quoting few documents from the time at all and all but completely ignoring the Jiu Tang shu.  Many including such scholarly luminaries as Gu Yanwu 顧炎武 \(1613–1682\) and Shao Jinhan though, found little of value in the Xin Tang shu,  but others, such as Ji Yun 紀昀 

\(1724–1805\), came to its defense. Naitō himself found things of use in the later text, though he faulted it for not being as punctilious in assessing historical fact as it might have been, such as in the use of fiction as a historical source.22

What did Naitō think of the Zizhi tongjian《資治通鑑》of Sima Guang 司馬光 \(1019–1089\), another text with the character tong in its title? He argued that Sima Guang’s penchant for drawing lessons from the events of history was tied up with the transition underway in China over the previous century from 貴族政治 to 獨裁君主政治, but he did not go into detail on this potentially fascinating topic. Despite marked differences in organization, the《資治 

通鑑》revived in a major way the tongshi style, searching for cause and effect over the long run of history.23

If 劉知幾 began the Tang-Song transition in Chinese historiography, then 鄭樵 completed it, according to Naitä The main thrust of Zheng’s Tong zhi《通志》was, simply put, that history had to be written in a comprehensive manner or it failed to capture wnat was the essence of historical inquiry: change over time. Thus, as we have seen, Zheng praised the《史記》no end and lambasted the《漢書》 with equal force. Among pre-Qing historians and historical critics, Naitō considered 鄭樵 a man of extraordinary brilliance and ranked on a par with 司馬遷.24

Surely the most extraordinary sub-section of Naitō’s chapter on history writing in the Ming was his six pages on Li Zhi 李贄 \(1527–1602\). Although not the first mention of Li in a modern source—Naitō himself had mentioned Li’s work as early as 190125—Naitō was one of the figures centrally responsible for reviving interest in and study of Li’s work in both China and Japan, and this was the first serious examination of Li’s historical writing in any language in several centuries. Although Li was vilified in the early Qing, Naitō was sufficiently impressed to allocate to Li more space than to any other Ming figure 22  《內藤湖南全集》，第11卷、頁194–201。

in historical writing.26 Naitō recognized Li as an extremist both in personal inclination and scholarship, but saw his work within the general framework of his times. As is well known, Li adopted an essentially biographical approach to history writing, although he rejected the older good-bad \(or right-wrong\) dichotomy as a universal way of assessing historical personages. His contribution was to suggest that the very concepts of “good” and “bad” by which we judge figures from the past are conditioned by changes in times. Thus, we cannot properly apply the same yardstick to all people at all times. 

Reading and writing in the early decades of the twentieth century, the Qing period did not have for Naitō the sense of being distant that it now holds for us. 

Naitō had covered its political events as a journalist for the first twenty years of his adult life, before he began his teaching career at Kyoto Imperial University in the last years of the Qing; in fact, he lived over half his life during the final Qing decades. For Naitō, it was during the Qing period when Chinese—and, for that matter, all humanity—reached the apex of historiographical expertise in methods, the use of sources, and philosophy of history. No Japanese, no Westerner, and certainly no one else could come close. Naitō’s great respect for historiography of the Qing era can be traced to what he perceived as its central focus on accuracy. It also involved a perceived rejection of ideology riding roughshod over scholarship. All of this may sound distinctly naive in our own sharply critical age, but it would be ahistorical of us to dismiss it as such without investigating it first. 

While Naitō did indeed lavish praise upon all the famed scholars of Qing kaozhengxue 考證學 from Gu Yanwu and Huang Zongxi 黃宗羲 \(1610–1695\) at the very start of the dynasty through figures as diverse as Sun Yirang 孫詒讓 \(1848–1908\) and Kang Youwei 康有爲 \(1858–1927\) at the end, he was especially taken with the historiographical writings of the eighteenth-century scholar Zhang Xuecheng—and Zhang was actually quite critical of the kaozheng movement. Thus, Naitō’s views are not easily characterized as simple positivism. 

While he had not gone out of his way to applaud the earlier dynastic histories—largely, it appears, because he did not have faith in these government-sponsored, mass projects to be able to retain any scholarly 26  內藤湖南全集》，第 11 卷、頁 265–278。See also Joshua A. Fogel, “On the

independence—Naitō did have reason to acclaim the Ming shi《明史》of the early Qing, He seemed especially pleased by the efforts of Zhu Yizun 朱彝尊 \(1629–1709\) to abandon the semi-fictional yeshi as sources in favor of a methodology geared toward use of the shilu 實錄 as the basis for writing the history of the Ming. Otherwise, Naitō spent a great deal more time and space on the topic of the early Qing, discussing the historical writings of the three great scholars of the founding generation, none of whom served the new Manchu state: Gu Yanwu, Huang Zongxi, and Wang Fuzhi 王夫之 \(1619–1692\). 

Despite great differences among them, he found admirable qualities in all of their historical writings.27

Much of the rest of his chapter on the Qing consists of explications of the main historical writings of an extremely long list of figures from the time—

some very famous, others all but unknown. His definition of “history” in this context was exceedingly broad, covering many subfields of science and classical studies. And, the general treatment is chronological, from early Qing to late. 

Among those singled out for particular praise, in addition to those mentioned above, are: 胡承諾 \(1607–1681\), 閻若璩 \(1636–1704\), 全祖望 \(1705–1755\), 王鳴盛 \(1722–1798\), 戴震 \(1723–1777\), 趙翼 \(1727–1814\), 錢大昕 \(1728–1804\), 崔述 \(1740–1816\), and 洪亮吉 \(1746–1809\).28 The list is so long and so rich, it simply overwhelms the modern reader. Naitō’s book was first put together from student notes, and at the very end of the text, we find a few brief lines—

in Chinese—of what was apparently covered in the very last lecture. The final line about a contemporary of Naitō’s reads: “Liang Qichao: Doesn’t even know what wants and proceeds to act recklessly” 「梁啓超不知其意而妄作者」.29

As taken as he was with so many Chinese historians, the work of Zhang Xuecheng held a particularly strong attraction for Naitō. Despite his own predilection for hard-nosed, kaozheng-style historical scholarship, Naitō nonetheless found Zhang’s theoretical approach to Historical methodology profoundly inspiring. In a lecture given shortly after his retirement in 1928, Naitō revealed that he had first read Zhang’s two major works,《文史通義》and《校讎

通義》, in 1902 after purchasing them in Hangzhou. In the mid-1910s, Naitō 

obtained an uncut edition of Zhang’s complete works \(《章氏遺書》\) and read them from start to finish. On this basis he wrote up a brief chronological biography \(nianpu  年譜 \)  which inspired Hu Shi 胡適 \(1891–1962\) to do the same and thus Zhang’s work became known to a new generation of Chinese 27   《內藤湖南全集》，第 11 卷、頁294–296, 301, 298–310。

scholars.30 While Zhang’s scholarly aim may have seemed in the final analysis to be philosophical, Naitō believed that it was fundamentally historiographic. 

Zhang was not out to record facts but to discover basic principles of the historical process. As Zhang had put it, all learning was historiography.31 I dare say this view would strike many as perfectly appropriate even today. 

In short, Naitō most appreciated Chinese historical works of a comprehensive nature, beginning with the 史記, works that looked at changes over the full run of history and not just a single dynastic era. He also appreciated scholarship and methodologies that were geared toward gaining a more accurate picture of the past; thus, Li Zhi of the Ming who contested received wisdom on evaluating historical personalities and especially the great Qing scholars working in history and related disciplines found great favor with him. While he highly valued hard work as a means toward an end, it was never an end in and of itself. Thus, he probably reserved the greatest praise for the master innova-tors \(the paradigm-shifters\) in historical studies, the men who came up with the ideas that changed the way we understand the past—first and foremost, Zhang Xuecheng. 

Naitō was a Titan who lived in an era of Titans. His heroes, from Sima Qina to Zhang Xuecheng, were in turn Titans to him. In our era of debunking mas-querading as scholarship, I believe that there is much more that can be gained by learning from the great scholars of the past. 臺北 and 京都 may be, the last two places on earth where Chinese history is still done in this way. I thank you very much for the opportunity to share my thoughts with you today.

**Japanese Travelers to Shanghai in the 1860s**

It \[Shanghai\] seems to be the most thriving place in the world. 

—Matsudaya Hankichi 松田屋伴吉**, **18621

From the middle of the seventeenth century for over 200 years, it was illegal on pain of death for Japanese to travel outside the islands that comprised their archipelago. Indeed, travel even within the islands was tightly regulated.2 

Study of things Western developed here and there over the course of these two centuries via works in Dutch—largely, medical texts—that came into Japan through the port of Nagasaki. Study of things Chinese had a long history in Japan before the start of the Edo period \(1600–1868\) and as with Dutch Learning \(Rangaku\), although on a much larger scale, developed and expanded throughout the country, spawning a wide assortment of regional schools and textual affiliations. When the shogunal government lifted the ban on travel in the middle of the nineteenth century, there was no mad rush to visit Holland; some scholars—such as Nishi Amane 西周 \(1829–97\) and Tsuda Mamichi 津田真道 \(1829–1903\)—did study there, though in small numbers. By contrast, the much closer China became the objective of a wide variety of travelers.3

Why did Japanese want to go to China and, in particular, Shanghai? In trying to answer this broad question, it is extremely important to bear in mind that, from the perspective of the 1860s, it was not at all apparent that Japan’s industrialization and “modernization” would take off with dramatically greater speed and success later in the century than China’s. Indeed, until visiting China for the first time, it was not at all clear to many Japanese that these were even desirable routes for their country—or, at the time, it would be better to say their many domains either separately or collectively—to follow. 

This essay examines three principal motivations spurring travel to China: commercial, military, and cultural. After a brief overview, it will examine 1  As cited in Kawashima Genjirō 川島源次郎, Nankoku shiwa  南國史話 \(Historical Tales from Southern Lands\) \(Tokyo: Heibonsha, 1926\), p. 148.

travelers and their writings in each of these categories for the decade of the 1860s, compare their impressions of Shanghai, and try to assess the place of 

“the West” in their thinking. It will conclude with a look at one of the most intriguing travelers, Kishida Ginkō 岸田吟香 \(1833–1905\), who came to Shanghai twice in the 1860s and many more times thereafter—and for all three reasons, often confused or overlapping in his own mind. 

**The Special Meaning of Travel to China**

As I have argued in the past,4 travel to China for Japanese before the twentieth century—and, in certain quarters, probably through the Taishō period—was qualitatively different from traveling elsewhere, as it was qualitatively different from Westerners traveling in China. No educated Japanese alive in 1862, save a few shipwreck victims who acquired an education outside Japan, had ever been to China at that time, and yet visiting that large land was not like visiting a completely foreign place. It was both known and unknown—physically unknown, personally unseen, contemporarily unexperienced, but culturally it was deeply familiar terrain, or at least most Japanese so imagined. This was not simply because both countries had long used Chinese characters, as was so often claimed by Japanese and Chinese alike. It was because the basic cognitive knowledge of how the world was ordered and how one was to accommodate oneself to it derived from the same set of texts, read and reread, commented on and memorized in both countries for centuries. When Kumashiro Enchō 

神代延長, an official dispatched at the end of the 1860s to Shanghai to encourage Japanese commercial ventures there, said the following as reported by his Chinese friend, Chen Qiyuan 陳其元, it was not just empty sloganeering: 

“My country reads Chinese books, writes Chinese characters, and practices Chinese rituals. We were originally one family.”5 By comparison, the knowledge of Dutch that a handful of Rangaku scholars acquired seems rice paper thin. 

This familiarity meant that the cultural referents implicit in actual Sino-Japanese discourse were assumed and natural. The most obvious manifestation of this was that Chinese and Japanese in these years were immediately able to communicate, despite the lack of a common spoken tongue, through the medium of literary Chinese. There are countless poignant cases to 4  Fogel, The Literature of Travel, pp. 43–46, and elsewhere along similar lines.

substantiate this point, as the essay by Richard Lynn on Huang Zunxian 黄遵憲 

\(1848–1905\) and his Japanese acquaintances in this volume amply demonstrates, and it provided the fundament for Sino-Japanese interactions in these early years. Elite Chinese who were resident in Japan, by way of comparison, did not begin to learn to speak Japanese well until the Meiji period was in its final years—in part because of cultural snobbery, but mostly because there was no need to do so. This covers the generations from Huang Zunxian through \(and including\) Liang Qichao 梁啓超 \(1873–1929\).6

**Travel for Commercial Ends**

Numerous Japanese who traveled specifically to Shanghai or whose ships called there en route elsewhere were taken with the extraordinary prosperity of commercial life in that burgeoning city \(see the opening epigrath above\). They did not all like the large number of ships flying flags from around the globe, though most were thrilled by the experience of seeing them. For example, when the Le Monge arrived in Shanghai on February 15, 1864 en route to England and France where the leader of the thirty-four Japanese on board, Ikeda Chikugo no kami Chōhatsu 池田筑後守長發, was to carry out some negotiations, they found the proverbial “forest of masts” anchored there. Everyone in the group who left an account described a feeling of exhilaration.7 When the previous year, five Japanese passed through Shanghai en route to Europe, virtually to a man their jōi  攘夷 \(expel the barbarians\) views changed overnight to 6  On Liang’s knowledge of Japanese, see Saitō Mareshi, “Liang Qichao’s Consciousness of Language,” paper presented at a conference on Liang Qichao and Japan, Santa Barbara, California, September 1998; and Saitō Mareshi 齋藤希史, “Kindai bungaku kannen keiseiki ni okeru Ryō Keichō” 近代文学観念形成期における梁啓超 \(Liang Qichao in the formative period of the concept of modern literature\), in Kyōdō kenkyū, Ryō Keichō: Seiyō kindai shisō juyō to Meiji Nihon  共同研究、梁啓超：西洋近代思想受容と明治日本 \(Joint Research on Liang Qichao: The Reception of Modern Western Thought and Meiji Japan\), ed.

kaikoku 開國 \(open the country\). This was especially true for two of them, Itō 

Hirobumi 伊藤博文 \(1841–1909\) and Inoue Kaoru 井上蓉馨 \(1835–1915\). Itō 

began to have serious doubts immediately that his hardened jōi ideas, formed in the hot house of Chōshū 長州 domain over the previous few years, would stand either his domain or Japan in good stead. It certainly seemed from the example of Shanghai that kaikoku was the policy to make Japan flourish, too. 

As Inoue’s biographer put it:

When he reached Shanghai, and saw from the deck of his ship the hundred or so warships, steamships, and sailing vessels in anchorage, and the busy scene of ships entering and leaving the harbor, he was completely taken aback. For the first time the Marquis \[Inoue\] . . . saw the full meaning of Sakuma Zōzan’s 佐久間象山 teachings \[on the necessity of opening Japan up\] and the inadequacy of simple exclusionist thought.8

In my earlier work, I have described in detail the first and second bakufu-sponsored group trips to Shanghai.9 Those vessels, the Senzaimaru  千歳丸 

in 1862 and the Kenjunmaru  健順丸 in 1864, were charged by the Nagasaki Magistrate and the Hakodate Magistrate, respectively, with observing commercial conditions in Shanghai as Japan prepared to open itself up to international trade and take full part in it. While every one of the many Japanese aboard these two ships had his own personal aims in traveling to China, the stated objective of the bakufu in authorizing these trips was commercial.10 That, in 8  Okita Hajime, Nihon to Shanhai, pp. 231–33; Etō Shinkichi 衛藤瀋吉, “Nihonjin no Chūgokukan: Takasugi Shinsaku ra no baai” 日本人の中国観：高杉晋作らのばあい

part, explains why they voyaged to Shanghai and not elsewhere along the coast of the mainland. The two magistracies, particularly the one in Nagasaki, had learned from contacts with Chinese, British, Dutch, and American vessels that Shanghai was an immense commercial entrepôt and a window on the West. 

Thus, one could see the West by making the three- or four-day trip to Shanghai and without going halfway around the world to Europe or crossing the Pacific Ocean to the United States. By 1862 the Western powers had been building business empires and semi-colonial enclaves—better known as concessions—for twenty years within the city of Shanghai and along the Huangpu River. By the time the Japanese arrived on the scene, Shanghai was no longer a frontier outpost. As Takasugi Shinsaku 高杉晋作 \(1839–67\), the young hothead from Chōshū domain, put it in his 1862 travelogue, “Shanghai may in fact belong to China, but one might as well call it British or French terrain. . . . 

The Chinese have become servants to the foreigners. Sovereignty may belong to China but in fact it’s no more than a colony of Great Britain and France.”11

What sort of commerce did the Japanese have in mind? What did they have to sell that the Chinese might want or need? There is an amusing story that predates the first actual voyage of Japanese to Shanghai but illustrates a point to be made. On the very day that Hakodate, a port on the southern side of Hokkaidō, Japan’s northernmost island, was opened to trade with the outside world—the second day of the sixth lunar month of Ansei 6 or 1859—an American vessel, the Moray, and a British vessel, the Eliza Mary, arrived in port in the wee hours of the morning. The latter had on board a British merchant by the name of Aston and his Cantonese steward Chen Yusong 陳玉松. The two men proceeded to the shop of a local marine produce wholesaler, Yanagida Tōkichi 柳田藤吉, and Chen there asked brusquely, probably in writing: “Got any haidai?” Mr. Yanagida did not know what haidai  海帶 was, and the matter was only cleared up when a local scholar could be found who confirmed that haidai was what the Chinese called konbu 昆布, a widely consumed variety of seaweed or kelp. Yes, he had plenty and offered Chen and Aston fourteen or fifteen stalks which they brought back with them to Shanghai. The Sino-Japanese market for konbu would never be the same. Massive quantities of Hokkaidō 

konbu \(as well as sea cucumbers and various creatures of the sea\) were purchased by Chinese or other merchants for sale in China, causing the price to fall dramatically on Chinese markets. In short order, haidai was no longer just 11  Takasugi Shinsaku 高杉晋作, Yū-Shin goroku  遊清五録 \(Five Records of a Trip to China\), in Takasugi Shinsaku zenshū  高杉晋作全集 \(Collected Works of Takasugi Shinsaku\), ed.

a luxury commodity for the elite but was being eaten by all social classes in Shanghai, even coolies.12

The bakufu did not allow individuals to travel abroad for business or study until 1866, although any number of Japanese had done just that over the previous three years. The pioneer Japanese enterprise in Shanghai dates to 1868, the first year of the Meiji era. It was known as the Tashiroya 田代屋, founded by Tomonari Genpei 友成源平, an adopted son of a well known Nagasaki ceram-ics dealer named Tashiro 田代, a surname Genpei took for himself as well. 

The Tashiroya sold Arita ware from Bizen 備前 domain and lacquerware to Chinese from a rented shop at the corner of Suzhou Street and Yuanmingyuan Street in the Hongkou area of the city. Hongkou was not then the thriving center that it would later become, one of the reasons the Japanese, late-corners to Shanghai, would settle there, as did sojourners from Guangdong. 

The Tashiroya also sold sundries for Japanese women in Shanghai, although the only Japanese women in Shanghai in 1868 were several prostitutes. 

Over the next year or so, the Tashiroya also opened a Japanese-style inn or ryokan primarily for Japanese visitors to the city.13

Although the 1870s would witness the coming of many Japanese commercial concerns and branches of several major conglomerates, before 1870 the Tashiroya was the only Japanese business in Shanghai. In 1869 the young Meiji government sent a Japanese official to Shanghai to check on local conditions for prospective Japanese entrepreneurs who wanted to trade with the Chinese. 

This official, Shinagawa Tadamichi 品川忠道, was authorized the following year by the Gaimushō 外務省 \(Ministry of Foreign Affairs\) to establish the 12  Yonezawa Hideo 米澤秀夫 “Shanhai hōjin hatten shi \(ichi\)” 上海邦人發展史\(一\) \(A history of the development of Japanese in Shanghai, part 1\), Tō-A keizai kenkyū  

東亞經濟研究 3 \(July 1938\), pp. 55–56; Yonezawa Hideo, Shanhai shiwa, pp. 86–88. 

The term “konbu” interestingly appears in the Hewen Han dufa \(How to Read Japanese the Chinese way\), that all-important and little known text that aided Liang Qichao and others of his generation in rapidly acquiring some reading fluency in Japanese: “kunbu \(J. konbu ‘kelp’\): a belt-shaped vegetable from the sea.” It was probably published in the 1890s, certainly before 1899, which means that even at this point, some thirty years after the first konbu arrived in China, the term had not entered everyday Chinese parlance.

Kaitensha 開店社 or Office for Opening Shops. It was located next door to the Tashiroya, and several years later—after the official commencement of diplomatic relations between the two countries—it became the Japanese Mission, and Shinagawa became Japan’s acting consul.14

Finally, in this vein, mention should be made of a French vessel carrying a large group of Japanese under the tutelage of Tokugawa Akitake 徳川昭

武 \(Minbu 民部\) to the second international exposition in Paris. It departed Nagasaki in February 1867 and called first at the port of Shanghai. On board was a Shibusawa Eiichi 渋沢栄一 \(1841–1931\) who was then in his mid-twenties. In his account of the overall trip to Europe, Kōsei nikki  航西日記 

\(Diary of a Voyage to the West\), Shibusawa mentioned the many things he observed in Shanghai—much of it related to business, as one would expect: the construction of bridges, the building of roads, and the laying of rail and telegraph lines. Indeed, the first telegraph lines in China were laid that very year.15 He also seems to have been genuinely saddened by the state to which China had descended:

The Europeans treat the natives like horses or oxen, striking them at will with sticks. Wherever we went, our passage was blocked by noisy crowds who swarmed about like ants. Now and again an English or French soldier would come along and chase them away, but back they would come like the surging tide. . . . China is a venerable country of renown. In size, population, richness of soil and products, it has no equal in Europe or Asia. Yet the country has been left behind by the advanced nations, for like a towering tree \[vulnerable to the high winds\], it considers itself superior to all other countries and is complacent and arrogant. . . . Clinging to outgrown policies, China becomes weaker by the day. This is truly regrettable.16

Who can say what impact this visit to Shanghai may have had in the career of Japan’s most famous self-made businessman of the Meiji and Taishō eras. 

It is probably not an exaggeration to say that in the bakumatsu era Shanghai rapidly replaced Nagasaki as the place from winch Japan learned of conditions in the world at large. One group of Japanese who played an especially important role in this process were those who had been victims of shipwrecks, whose ships had drifted away from Japanese waters and, often after years of 14  Okita Hajime, Nihon to Shanhai, pp. 262–67.

working their way around the world, ended up in Shanghai. For reasons of time and space, they cannot figure in this essay with one exception, that of the extraordinary case of a man known only as Otokichi 音吉 \(b. 1819\). He, like other Japanese castaways, had sought to return to his homeland but was turned away because the infringment of the ban on overseas travel might entangle other Japanese in a situation for which only bad weather had been initially to blame. His story has been told in detail elsewhere.17

**Travel for Military Ends**

The period under study falls well before military conflict between China and Japan had become a serious issue. The context of travel by Japanese to Shanghai with military aims in mind refers to conflicts, or potential conflicts, back home in Japan either between domains or between certain domains and the shogunate. Shanghai provided a wealth of opportunities to purchase military hardware from European manufacturers. The city was relatively accessible, especially compared with traveling all the way to the West, and the prices were reasonable. It should be emphasized again that the individual Japanese purchasing or attempting to purchase weaponry or ships in Shanghai during the 1860s were not doing so on behalf of “Japan,” a political concept still in the making at that time. They were charged in their missions by their respective feudal domains, and all worked to hide their objectives for fear that the bakufu would find them out. 

The first record we have of a Japanese attempting to buy a vessel in Shanghai appears in 1862 when Takasugi Shinsaku learns to his amazement and jeal-ousy that a deck hand aboard the Senzaimaru, who is actually Godai Tomoatsu 五代友厚 \(1835–85\) in disguise, has plans to look into such a purchase on behalf of Satsuma 薩摩 domain when they arrive in the Chinese port. These ships cost tens of thousands of dollars, and one can only wonder where a deck hand would have secreted such a quantity of money en route. The most Takasugi could muster was to buy a small hand gun. When the Japanese aboard the Kenjunmaru arrived in 1864, they were informed, perhaps by way of warning, of a group of three Japanese—Kobayashi Rokurō 小林六郎, Nagao 17  Haruna Akira 春名徹, Nippon Otokichi hyōryūki  日本音吉漂流記 \(An Account of the Castaway Otokichi of Japan\) \(Tokyo: Shōbunsha, 1979\) is the fullest account of his life and a wonderful read. See also the painstaking research of Okita Hajime, Nihon to Shanhai, pp. 43–70. Most recently, Liu Jianhui has added an interesting interpretation to the literature in his Mato Shanhai, pp. 128–37.

Jisaku 長尾治策, and Ueno Kagenori 上野景範—who had recently come to Shanghai to buy weapons and had been sent home empty-handed because such business was deemed illegal.18

Several years later at the time of the second Chōshū war in 1866, Itō Hirobumi was sent by his lord to Shanghai to buy not one but two ships for the domain. 

He succcessfully purchased one American and one British vessel which were renamed the Daini Heiinmaru  第二丙寅丸 and the Manjumaru  満珠丸 for the domainal navy. Later that year Gotō Shōjirō 後藤象二郎 \(1838–97\) of Tosa domain traveled to Shanghai and bought a gunboat for his lord. A considerably less well known fact was that at roughly the same time Saga 佐賀 domain sent its ship, the Kōshimaru  甲子丸, to Shanghai for repairs; as it entered the port of Shanghai, it was flying the Japanese flag. Saga had bought this vessel from the British in October 1864 for the large sum of $120,000. Similarly, Takezoe Shin’ichirō 竹添進一郞 \(1842–1917\), the great sinologue, diplomat, and author of a penetrating travelogue of China in 1870, made his first trip to Shanghai m 1866 aboard Kumamoto domain’s vessel, the Banrimaru  萬里丸, to seek repairs—to avoid undue suspicions, he claimed he was shipwrecked.19

Soga Yūjun 曾我祐準 from Yanagawa 柳川 domain was on a mission of observation in Shanghai \(and later to Hong Kong, Singapore, and Calcutta\) in 1866, and he bumped into Itō on the streets of Shanghai. Soga had been moved, as were many Japanese of his generation, by a sense of urgency to research foreign affairs. To that end, he had traveled to Nagasaki in the early 1860s where he studied British troop training before returning home. He traveled back to Nagasaki in June 1865 with the hope of boarding a foreign vessel to take him overseas, at a time when it was still technically illegal to do so. He met with a number of foreign merchants and eventually was able to ship out on a British commercial vessel owned by Glover and Company as some sort of aide, and off he went to Shanghai. His diary recounts the meeting with Itō and Itō’s mission there, as well as encounters with other Japanese.20

As the above paragraphs indicate, commercial and military objectives often overlapped. Ships might be used for offensive warfare, but they might also be put to pacific use moving people or goods from place to place. A number of Westerners had become wealthy plying the Nagasaki-Shanghai and Hakodate-Shanghai routes bringing Chinese and Western goods to Japan to trade. When the Japanese finally decided to buy their own vessel to sail to Shanghai in 18  Yonezawa Hideo, Shanhai shiwa, p. 155.

Japanese Travelers to Shanghai in the 1860s 285

1862, they had no choice but to retain the British captain and crew because no Japanese were seaworthy at that point in time. Within a few short years, that situation would quickly change. 

The third Japanese-owned vessel to make the trip to Shanghai—after the Senzaimaru and the Kenjunmaru—was a steamship known as the Cosmopolite which left Nagasaki on October 13,1867, arriving a few days later in Shanghai. It was manned entirely by Japanese, 108 of them—a captain, 24 officers, 60 crew-men, and 23 stokers. Originally a British ship, the Cosmopolite had been sold in 1864 to Higo 肥後 domain. While the Cosmopolite was a 600-ton cargo vessel, the fourth ocean-going ship bought by Japan which came to trade in Shanghai was the 400-ton Dolphin. Purchased by Hizen 肥前 domain in April 1866 from the British for $23,000, it made a number of trips to Shanghai in the waning years of the Edo period.21

**Travel for Cultural Ends**

In this context, I use “culture” and “cultural” in a broad and simple sense. It is meant to convey the intentions of those Japanese travelers who came to Shanghai to meet Chinese artists, calligraphers, and scholars, to exchange brush conversations about various artistic and philosophical matters, and to visit sites of historical significance to all educated East Asians. 

The first Japanese to make the trip to Shanghai and who actually took up residence there upon his arrival in 1864 was Yasuda Rōzan 安田老山 \(Mamoru 養\). He was born in 1833 in Takasu 高須 domain in Mino 美濃 into a family of samurai doctors. In addition to his medical training, Yasuda acquired an early and persistent interest in calligraphy. He eventually left his hometown and settled in Iida 飯田 village in nearby Shinano 信濃 domain where he put up a shingle. His next-door neighbor was a salt warehouse owner by the name of Ihara Shigebee 伊原重兵衛, and Yasuda married his daughter Kyū \(usually written きふ\)—an interesting match inasmuch as they were from opposite ends of the social ladder or Edo Japan. As his practice was not proving productive, Yasuda and his wife moved to Edo and later to Nagasaki, and there he worked for a prominent Zen monk by the name of Tetsuō 鐵翁, head priest of the Shuntoku 春德 Temple, founded in 1630 and for many generations the site at which books brought from China were inspected by the temple head for 21  M.

violations of the strict bakufu regulations on interdicted texts. He also studied calligraphy with Tetsuō until he departed for Shanghai in 1864. There he worked for and studied painting and calligraphy with one of best known and appreciated artists of the day, Hu Gongshou 胡公壽 \(Yuan 遠 1823–86\).22

At least two other students of Tetsuō’s made the trip to Shanghai as well, Nagai Unpyō 長井雲坪 \(from Echigo 越後 domain, posthumously to become well known\) and Ishikawa Kansen 石川澗川 \(from Etchū 越中\). All three Japanese became friends of the landscape painter Xu Yuting 徐雨亭, who had earlier visited Nagasaki, Wang Daozhi 王道之, and Lu Wangxiang 陸王祥. 

In Shanghai, Yasuda became known as Wushui 吳水 \(waterway of China\), Nagai as Wujiang 吳江 \(river of China\), and Ishikawa as Wushan 吳山 \(mountain of China\). When he returned to Japan years later, Yasuda propagated the style of painting he had learned from Hu Gongshou. This style was especially championed in Tokyo by Okuhara Seiko 奥原晴湖 and in Kyoto by Nakanishi Kōseki 中西耕石. Underscoring his contacts with Japanese artists as well as his fame, Wang Tao 王韜 \(1828–97\) included a poem about Hu Gongshou in his Yingruan zazhi 瀛壖雜誌 \(Miscellanies by the Ocean\), one line of which reads: “A piece \[from his hand\] is worth a city in Japan.”23

When he traveled through Shanghai in 1872, Okada Kōsho 岡田篁所 noted in his diary, Kogo nikki  滬呉日記 \(Diary of Shanghai and Jiangsu\), that he had met with Yasuda and that the latter was still studying with Hu Gongshou. In his jottings about the sights and sounds of Shanghai in the 1880s, the author Huang Shiquan 黄式權 \(1853–1924\) mentions that “Mr. Yasu\[da\] Rōzan from Japan . . . has long lived in Shanghai and produced many works. He has done ink drawings of plum trees and landscapes.” 

22  Hu Gongshou hailed from Jiangsu province and was renowned in his day as a poet, 96 calligrapher, and artist. He came to Shanghai in 1861, where he earned his living by selling his own art work, to avoid the Taipings and there established contacts with such painters as Hu Bishan 胡鼻山, Li Renshu 李壬叔, and Xugu 虚谷 \(1823–96\). Shanghai was then becoming a refuge point for many from the long civil war, and among them a number of the painters, such as Hu, forged a new “Shanghai style.” Hu gained great fame in his day, acquiring even Japanese students of the Nanga School of painting, among his disciples.

Japanese Travelers to Shanghai in the 1860s 287

In 1870 Yasuda returned to Japan to gather up his wife and bring her with him to share his life in Shanghai. Kyū changed her given name at this time to Ai, and she became known in her own right as a painter in Shanghai as Hongfeng Nüshi 紅楓女史 \(Ms. Red Maple Tree\). She died there in the summer of 1872 

at the tender age of 26 sui \(J. sai\) and was buried to the west of the Longhua 龍華** **pagoda; her remains were later removed to the Japanese cemetery which had not yet been founded at the time of her death. The stone inscription was prepared by none other than Hu Gongshou.24

Although, unlike Yasuda, he never settled in Shanghai, Nagura Inata 名倉予

何人 \(some read it Anata; also known as Nagura Jūjirō 名倉重次郎 or Atsushi 敦\) from Hamamatsu 浜松 domain first visited Shanghai earlier, altogether three times in the 1860s. Over the course of these trips, he established lasting friendships with well known Chinese scholars and painters. He first came to Shanghai in 1862, one of the 51 Japanese aboard the Senzaimaru.25 His second 24  Okita Hajime, “Shanhai shiwa,” Shanhai kenkyū 1 \(February 1942\), pp. 63–64; Okita Hajime.

She was the wife of Yasuda Rōzan \(Mamoru\). She painted orchids and bamboo beautifully. She had a fine hand for calligraphy and was a lovely woman.

trip was a brief stopover en route to Europe in 1864, while the third voyage was aboard the Ganges in 1867. The Ganges  carried a total of nine Japanese to Shanghai, all of them concerned first and foremost with the pursuit of knowledge. In addition to Nagura, they were: Ōbayashi Toraji 大林虎次, Yagi Saiji 八木財次, Abe Yasutarō 安倍保太郎 \(later, Abe Yasuta 安倍保太\), Itō 

Jinshirō 伊東甚四郎, Kushibe Gozaemon 串戸五左衛門, Watanabe Shōnen 

渡邊莊年, Kaburagi Tatemoto 鏑木立本, and Takahashi Inosuke 高橋佁之

助 \(later, Takahashi Yuichi 高橋由一\). 

The same day, February 15, that the Ganges left Yokohama, a French vessel, the Alphée, carrying a large Japanese delegation set sail from Yokohama as well. The group led by Tokugawa Akitake, younger brother of the shōgun, was set to attend the international exposition in Paris in an official capacity.26 

The two ships arrived in Shanghai at roughly the same time, and as the latter clearly bore men of higher social standing, the men of the Ganges who had planned to take rooms in the Astor House Hotel had perforce to spend the night elsewhere. Takahashi moved the next day to the large residence of a local businessman and art connoisseur by the name of Wang Renbo 王人伯 

who supported Takahashi’s painting pursuits for the several months the latter spent in Shanghai. In addition to a diary, Takahashi left a number of sketches of people and places in Shanghai at the time; he was later to become a renowned artist. 

While on his 1862 trip, Nagura had made close contacts with the writer Chen Ruqin 陳汝欽 \(Miansheng 勉生\). On his third trip in 1867 he made friends with a broad range of wenren  文人: Wang Xuanfu 王亘甫 \(whom he had met in 1864\), Wang Weixiao 王維孝, Hou Tingzun 侯廷樽, Ping Zhai 平齋, Zhe Sheng 喆生, Zhang Xiuzhi 張秀芝, and Xu Xiqi 許錫祺 \(1820–76\), in addition to Wang Renbo whom he had met earlier. Of these men, Xu wrote the most about meeting with the Japanese who had come to Shanghai on the Ganges, including poems to Yagi and Kushibe. Xu’s student, the local poet Yao Chengyan 姚承燕 \(Qisun 芑孫\), later composed a poem in Nagura’s honor Senzaimaru kankei shiryō” 資料紹介：名倉予何人「海外日錄」文久二年千才丸

which appears in the Siming suoji 四溟瑣紀 \(Fragmentary Writings of the Realm\), a collection of writings by Shanghai-based authors. Another Chinese who frequented the Wang Renbo estate, Wang Zhentai 王禎泰, took the entire Ganges group to performances of local theater on several occasions. 

Mention should be made in passing of Nagura’s 1864 trip to Europe that stopped in Shanghai on both legs of the journey, led by Ikeda Chikugo no kami and cited above. Nagura used the few days in Shanghai in February en route to make the acquaintances of several Chinese wenren,  among them Wang Renbo, Hou Kang’an, 侯康安 and Sun Yanfeng 孫硯峰; on the return trip in August he met with Liu Wenhui 劉文匯, Wang Weiqi 王維圻, Wang Renbo again, and Wang Xuanfu.27

Nagura left Shanghai following his third trip in May of 1967. His stated aim in making this last trip was the pursuit of knowledge, but there were obvious ancillary reasons as well. His trips afforded him the opportunity to get to know China and Chinese men of letters, to exchange thoughts and poems via literary Chinese, and to introduce his Chinese hosts to Japan. These trips also gave him a chance to see the outside world through the microcosm of Shanghai. 

There were several other Japanese who had taken up residence in Shanghai in the waning years of the Tokugawa regime, though their motivations for doing so remain more obscure. Yabe \(or Yae\) Kisaburō 八戸喜三郎 \(Hiromitsu 弘光, Junshuku 順叔\) had already been to London and San Francisco and was allegedly fluent in English—perhaps indicating that he was earlier a shipwreck victim—when he found himself in Hong Kong at the time that the Japanese aboard the Ganges arrived in Shanghai; he apparently first arrived in Shanghai in 1866. He then made his way to Shanghai to join this group on a tour led by a Chinese official as far as Suzhou, Zhenjiang, and Nanjing. The Chinese knew Yabe as Hongguang 宏光, a variant of his studio name Hiromitsu, and the very fact that he had several names and elite Chinese contacts would lead one to believe that he, too, was a man of letters. Indeed, in his Wengyou yutan 甕牖餘談 \(Chats from the mouth of a jar\), Wang Tao highly praised “Riben Hongguang” 日本宏光 who, he claimed, had traveled widely, knew many Chinese wenren, and had a fine calligraphic hand. When Wang traveled to Japan in 1879, he asked many people about Yabe, but no one knew anything about him. By contrast, Tani Kanjō 谷干城 \(1837–1911\), the high-ranking Tosa official, met Yabe in Shanghai in 1867 and reported in his travelogue that the 27  Yonezawa Hideo, Shanhai shiwa, pp. 157, 158; Okita Hajime, Nihon to Shanhai, pp. 185–90, 207–14, 233–36, 242, 248–49; Okita Hajime, Kojō shidan, p. 103.

man was exceedingly full of flattery and conceit.28 One final Japanese scholar resident in Shanghai in these years about whom even less is known was Sone Tsunenosuke 曾根常之助 \(Shōun 嘯雲\). He hailed from Uwajima 宇和島, 

is mentioned in several contemporary accounts, and was living in the city by 1866.29

Although it is clearly difficult to distinguish the various Japanese travelers to Shanghai in these years in the somewhat artificial manner that I have chosen, nonetheless several things do suggest themselves. Unlike those who went for commercial or military reasons, the cultural travelers all but completely ignored the West that was so important to the others. No Westerners had anything of substance to contribute culturally to the interactions they sought in Shanghai, and aside for a utilitarian knowledge of English acquired during peregrinations prior to his settling in Shanghai, even Yabe Kisaburō seems to have had no contacts with things Western. The West was simply not on their spiritual radar screens. By contrast, it would not be too great an exaggeration to say that men such as Itō Hirobumi and others traveled to Shanghai with little or no interest in the native population whatsoever. In the life and experiences of Kishida Ginkō in the 1860s, however, we find all three objectives combined—

usually not discretely separated one from the next, but all present nonetheless. 

**Kishida Ginko and His Wide Range of Activities in Shanghai** Even before he made his first trip to Shanghai, Kishida Ginkō had already lived several lives. He was highly educated in Chinese learning, came from a samurai family, had worked as a farmer and as a merchant, and knew more than a smattering of English. In his early thirties, he found himself suffering from a serious eye affliction which made it impossible for him to read. The year was 1864 

and no cure seemed available. Then, his friend and well known legal scholar Mitsukuri Rinshō 箕作麟祥 \(1846–97\) encouraged him to visit the clinic of the missionary Dr. James C. Hepburn \(1815–1911\) in Yokohama. Hepburn’s treatment cured him and a lasting friendship ensued. 

A graduate of Princeton College and the University of Pennsylvania Medical School, Hepburn thought there were simply too many doctors and too much competition among them in the United States. It was best, he believed, to move 28  Okita Hajime, Kojō shidan, pp. 30–31; Yonezawa Hideo, Shanhai shiwa, pp. 159–60, 164; the citation from Wang Tao, Wengyou yutan, juan 2, can be found in Okita Hajime, Nihon to Shanhai, pp. 195–96, 198. 

29  Yonezawa Hideo, Shanhai shiwa, pp. 159–60; Okita Hajime, Nihon to Shanhai, p. 203. 

Japanese Travelers to Shanghai in the 1860s 291

to a country with few doctors where his services would genuinely be needed. 

Many such lands existed at the time, as they still do, and thus Hepburn decided to select a country that not only lacked doctors but also was, in his estimation, ignorant of the Christian God. He spent five years in the Shanghai and Xiamen areas of China, returned to the United States for a number of years, and then settled in the Yokohama area of Japan, after the opening of that port city, for most of the rest of the nineteenth century. 

When Kishida met Hepburn in the mid-1860s, the doctor was beginning to prepare the first Japanese-English dictionary. Hepburn found in Kishida a man whose training in Kangaku as well as his varied past made available to him for his dictionary an extraordinary array of vocabulary registers of the Japanese language. In June of 1865 Kishida moved in with the Hepburns to work full-time on the dictionary project. When a draft was completed in the late summer of 1866, Hepburn realized that he would be unable to print his dictionary satisfactorily in Japan. At this time Japan had no moveable type, only woodblock printing. They thus set sail for Shanghai aboard the Cadiz on October 27, 1866. Printing of the dictionary took place at the American Presbyterian Mission Press \(Hua-Mei shuguan 華美書館\) then run by William Gamble. As a missionary enterprise in China, they had access to Chinese characters and the Roman alphabet in moveable type, but what about kana? As it turns out, they in fact had bad the capacity to print kana since 1861, perhaps aided in this way by Kyūkichi 九吉, brother of Otokichi and another Japanese shipwreck victim resident in Shanghai, who had been involved in the world of Shanghai printing.30

Shortly after their arrival in Shanghai, Hepburn and his wife became ill and returned to Japan, leaving the difficult job of overseeing and proofreading the printing of the dictionary to his Japanese assistant. Kishida worked long hours for minimal wages for the next seven or eight months, seeing this task to frui-tion, and in May of 1867 the printing of the Wa-Ei gorin shūsei  和英語林集成 

\(Japanese-English dictionary\) finally came to an end. The story of Hepburn’s 30  Sugiura Tadashi 杉浦正, Kishida Ginkō, shiryō kara mita sono isshō  岸田吟香、資料か

dictionary is legendary, for it canonized the Hepburn romanization system which we still use in modified form today. Kishida is usually portrayed as an underfed and unhappy coolie, but a look at his diary, the Ūsun nikki 吳淞日記 

\(Wusong Diary\), reveals much, much more going on. 

In fact, Kishida investigated and established such extensive contacts in the world of Chinese scholarship and art that one might be led to assume that this was, in fact, the far more compelling reason for him to make the trip to China. 

He maintained the friendships made on this trip for the next thirty years over the course of at least a dozen more trips. He was also actively studying commercial conditions in Shanghai for a highly successful venture he would start in a few years’ time. These concerns seem far more important to him from the perspective of his diary. 

Before leaving for Shanghai, Kishida had made the acquaintance of Ishii Tankō 石井潭香 \(d. 1870\) when both were studying in Edo. Ishii had earlier studied calligraphy with a Chinese master in Nagasaki. Kishida took several examples of Tankō’s calligraphy with him to Shanghai to show to Chinese interlocutors. Here is an entry from his diary for the nineteenth day of the first lunar month \(late February\) of Keiō 3 \(1867\):

Ding Jiesheng 丁介生 and Sun Renpu 孫仁圃 came to visit. Renpu is a man of extraordinary etiquette. We exchanged some brush talk that day as well. Tankō had done four pieces of calligraphy \[which Kishida had brought to China\]. Upon seeing Tankō’s characters, their faces took on a strange hue, and both Jiesheng and Renpu looked closely at the seals, twisted the paper in their fingers, and asked the nationality of the man who had drawn these characters. I replied \[in kanbun\]: “This is a mere scrap composed by my friend Han Huiyan 韓徽言 \[or Kan Kigen in Japanese, Tankō’s pen name\] for your visual amusement.” At that, Jiesheng said in English: “Japan man.” When I said, “Yes,” he said: “China man.” 

I replied: “No, Japan man.” Renpu wrote: “I believe Mr. Han is a friend of yours from Japan. . . .” This was very high praise, indeed. Jiesheng seemed incapable of believing that these were all from the hand of a Japanese. 

Furthermore, \[Tankō’s\] work was praised by all Chinese.31

Many other Chinese continued to doubt that such marvelous work could have been the product of a Japanese hand. 

In addition to the many Chinese with whom he made contact in Shanghai, Kishida also met up with several of the Japanese who had arrived in 1867

aboard the Ganges,   in particular the painter Takahashi Yuichi and Kaburagi Tatemoto, both from Saga domain, and Yagi Saiji. When they made their trip to Nanjing, he planned to joined them, but was unable to do so.32 But, it was the Chinese painters and calligraphers with whom Kishida spent much time and who were much taken with him. In a letter to his friend Kawakami Tōgai 川上冬崖, dated the fifteenth day of the first lunar month of 1867, he described the artistic scene in Shanghai, and one can clearly see his commercial inclinations rising to the surface as well. 

There appear to be some great painters in Shanghai, but I’ve been so busy from day to day \[with the dictionary project\] that I haven’t had a moment to meet or speak with them yet. In calligraphy, Song Xiaocheng 宋小城 

and Sun Renpu are very good; in painting, Hu Gongshou, Yu Qianyun 余

倩雲, Ling Ziyu 淩子與, and Chen Shimei 陳嗜梅 are said to be well 

known at present. I’d like to have one piece by each of them by the time I return home. As always, though, money is a serious problem. A painter by the name of Ling Susheng 淩蘇生 who paints only marsh geese is a very easy-going man. I’ve shown him the work of many Japanese painters, but he had reserved his praise solely for your work. He said: “Tōgai’s flowers and grass are executed most subtly.” I’ve kept the wastepaper from our brush talks, so I’ll bring it home with me to show you. That’ll prove that this is neither a lie nor flattery on my part. For calligraphy I would most extol Tan Weng 潭翁 \[Master Tan?\]. As soon as you get this letter, please send me one or two scrolls, so I can show your paintings to Hu Gongshou and Yu Qianyun. I’ll also ask them to do some painting and get them to put your name on it which I can bring back home with me. Is it okay if I do this on your behalf?33

Without knowing more about this specific case, though, Kishida’s objectives are not at all transparent. 

Prior to his departure for Shanghai, Kishida had met in Edo the extraordinary figure of Hamada Hikozō 濱田彥藏 \(1837–97\), better known as Joseph Heco, a shipwreck victim of 1850 whose peregrinations had taken him for the better part of a decade to California where he acquired American citizenship. Back in Japan in the early 1860s, he explained to Kishida, who was studying English with him, just what a newspaper was. Kishida had never heard of such a thing, but, extraordinarily enterprising man that he was, he was willing to go in on 32  Sugiura Tadashi, Kishida Ginkō, p. 160; Okita Hajime, Kojō shidan, p. 29.

such a venture with Heco—who knew English well but still had the untamed Japanese of a young fisherman—and another friend, Honma Senzō 本間潛藏. 

The result was Japan’s first newspaper, Kaigai shinbun 海外新聞 \(Overseas news\), whose inaugural issue appeared in the spring of 1864. On June 1, 1868 

Heco and Kishida inaugurated another newspaper, Yokohama shinpō moshiogusa  橫濱新報もしほ草 \(Yokohama press miscellany\), and later still Kishida was a staff writer for the Tōkyō nichinichi shinbun  東京日日新聞 \(Tokyo daily news\), covering among other things the Japanese assault on Taiwan in 1874.34

Kishida made his second trip to Shanghai in February of 1868 allegedly to purchase a steamship. The details on this roughly two-month voyage and its background remain murky at best; we still do not know who was funding such an expensive venture or why. The Yokohama shinpō moshiogusa for Keiō 

4 \(1868\) /5/13 carried a note from Kishida which read as follows: “In a letter received from Shanghai, China on the tenth, we are informed that there are now 100 Japanese in Shanghai \[an exaggeration\]. They say someone was there buying a steamship which is coining to Japan.” This cannot have been a reference to his own efforts, for he was unable to locate an appropriate vessel in Shanghai and thus no deal ever materialized.35

Nonetheless, he used the opportunity of being in Shanghai to set up agencies to market the product that would make him rich in years to come. The product was a miraculous eye wash called Seikisui 精錡水 with which Dr. Hepburn had cured him several years earlier. He had only just begun producing Seikisui in August 1867, and only six months later, in February 1868, he was ready to begin selling it in China. Two shops in Shanghai, the Ruixinghao 瑞興號 and the Wanxianghao 萬祥號, agreed to be agencies to sell Dr. Hepburn’s treatment, and each bore the placard: “On sale here, the eye medicine Jingqishui 

\[Seikisui\], expertly produced by Mr. Kishida Ginkō of Japan.”36 In the newly renamed capital of Tokyo, he soon opened an apothecary shop on the Ginza to market Seikisui, and advertisements for this product appeared in such newspapers as the Tōkyō nichinichi shinbun in the early Meiji years.37

Kishida was clearly a bakumatsu-Meiji jack-of-all-trades. While engaged in all of his many and sundry ventures, he still managed to keep his cultural associations alive in Shanghai. In a Chinese painting reproduced in an 1897 

collection, he is centrally located and clearly the senior member of the group. 

Among Chinese scholars he had earned the extraordinary honorific appellation, “Dongyang zhi xianke” 東洋之仙客 \(the immortal of Japan\). In fact, Kishida may have temporarily acquired wealth but he never saved his money or enjoyed its fruits, at least in the conventional way. Rather, he devoted himself to a variety of projects in China, such as spreading information throughout China on the evils of opium and by establishing rehabilitation clinics for drug users. 

Sino-Japanese friendship was apparently more important to him that personal wealth. Indeed, his business practices were ironically dubbed “Kishida no kata bōeki” 岸田の片貿易 \(Kishida’s one-way trade\) by his contemporaries.38 His influence in the creation of a number of important Japanese institutions in China aimed at Sino-Japanese amity falls outside the scope of this essay. 

**Conclusions**

At this time, I can do little more than indicate some of the central themes that I see at work among the objectives of Japanese travelers to Shanghai in the 1860s. 

The 1860s was a critical decade in both countries. The Qing dynasty was, with British help, finally able to quell the greatest rebellion in its history—Kishida claimed in fact to have seen Taiping remnants in the streets of Shanghai in 1866, though that seems doubtful. In its aftermath, the government launched a massive restoration campaign to bring the country back onto its feet, and this program involved hiring Western experts in manufacturing and military science. Japan was undergoing the waning years of its last shogunate, and many of the youngbloods that became important players in the new Meiji regime from 1868 had visited Shanghai or passed through it en route elsewhere, an experience that frequently played a significant role in their understanding of Japan’s new place in the world. 

As noted above, Shanghai was in this decade—and for many decades thereafter—to replace Nagasaki as Japan’s window onto the world. Whereas in the past one would go to Nagasaki to meet a Chinese or Dutch person, now one could go to Shanghai to meet many Chinese and all manner of Europeans.

Shanghai, though, could teach a multiplicity of sometimes contradictory lessons. Yes, it demonstrated that opening ports would lead to prosperity, but, as Takasugi Shinsaku noted during Japan’s first mission to Shanghai, that prosperity did not necessarily fall to the ones who opened their own ports. 

Japan would have to retain firm control over the opening of its own ports. 

There were crowds of people, forests of ship masts, and hustle-bustle beyond the very imaginations of Japanese visitors—things one can still experience in Shanghai—but that clearly did not portend a uniformly positive future for the Chinese. 

For the cultural travelers, though, Shanghai provided something it is all too easy now for us on the other side of “modernity” to ignore. From the mid-1860s, the very fact that Japanese could actually visit China meant that these men who were trained, as generations of their antecedents had been before them, in the same texts and traditions as their Chinese hosts, would be able to meet real, living, breathing Chinese men of letters. Not only had no one among them ever had that privilege; no one they had ever known could have enjoyed such an honor. On the whole the Chinese who came to Nagasaki were merchants and seaman who were for the most part illiterate. Before the Meiji government launched its breakneck Westernization plans, before China was a place to be “gotten out of” \( datsu-A 脱亞\), and before the Chinese themselves began the wholesale ravagings of their own ancient culture throughout the twentieth century, this reuniting of cultural cousins was a momentous event. And kanbun 漢文** **provided the key link enabling discourse at many different registers to be carried on. That would all sadly be lost over the following decades, particularly as the gruesome twentieth century commenced.
