title = "Introduction: Itō Takeo and the Research Work of the South Manchurian Railway Company"

+++

In November 1906, following the Russo-Japanese War, Japan acquired the South Manchurian Railway \(SMR\). Gotō Shimpei was named its first president and he immediately made plans for inaugurating a Research Department. 

“Research” was something Gotō considered utterly essential to colonial management. Tokutomi Sohō once said of Gotō: “Everyone has his own peculiarities. ‘Research’ is something that always hung close to Gotō like a briefcase.”1 

The Research Department began in April 1907 as a small agency and changed its name many times, at its height, around 1940, encompassing a total of 2,354 

employees. It lasted for thirty-eight years, before the arrest of many of its main operatives by the Kwantung Army and Japan’s defeat in World War II spelled its demise. Who came to work for it and why? How did they see themselves? To what use was their research put, and what did they think about that? These are a few of the questions to be addressed in this introduction. 

With Japan as the major force in Manchuria after 1906, Gotō Shimpei proceeded with his master plan for colonial development through research. 

The SMR received a huge quantity of capital, 200 million yen, half from the government and half in a public offering. It was never simply a for-profit company, for the SMR had a sense of immense responsibility, of mission. Among other things, Gotō wanted to be sure Manchuria never ceased to be under Japanese control, and that necessitated the immigration of 500,000 Japanese to the area.2

The slogan he devised for his conception of colonial control has been the object of considerable discussion: bunsō teki bubi, or “military preparedness in civil garb.” Itō records Gotō’s words on the subject:

Itō Takeo and the Research Work of the SMR Company

In short, colonial policy is military preparedness in civil garb; it is carrying: out the hegemon’s strategies under the flag of the kingly way. Such a colonial policy is inescapable in our time. What facilities, then, are necessary to see it through? 

We have to implement a cultural invasion with a Central Laboratory, popular education for the resident populace, and forge other academic and economic links. Invasion may not be an agreeable expression, but \[language\] 

aside we can generally call our policy one of invasion in civil garb. . . . Certain scholars have said that the secret of administration lies in taking advantage of the people’s weaknesses. . . . Insofar as the secret to administration does hang on the weak points of mankind’s way of life and in fact has throughout history, it is that much more so with colonial policy.3

No mincing of words here. A main research office was established in Dairen, a branch in Tokyo for the first project in January 1908, and the East Asian Economic Investigation Bureau \(EEB\) later that year. Both the human and natural sciences were to be researched, and a massive network of facilities took form in Manchuria and later in China proper. Gotō had been trained as a medical doctor in Germany, and the methodical, clinical approach to research problems became a hallmark of SMR research. 

Gotō asked Professor Okamatsu Santarō of Kyoto University, an expert in Chinese law, to head the Research Department. Okamatsu had led the team that researched the “o1d customs” of Taiwan when Gotō had been colonial civil governor there. But, Okamatsu had never run the kind of Research Department now envisioned for Manchuria, so Gotō sent him to Europe to study the operations of such an outfit. Manchuria was many, many times the size of Taiwan; it was not yet an outright colony of Japan; and the Research Department had not yet acquired the kind of staff needed for a comparable study of Manchuria. 

Nonetheless, Gotō regarded it as absolutely indispensable to colonial management to have detailed research on the “Old Customs of Manchuria,” for without this background knowledge, transforming and protecting the region would be difficult.4

The next major project, begun in response to a suggestion of Shiratori Kurakichi \(founder of the Tokyo University School of Sinology\), was a research facility for the study of Manchurian and Korean history and geography. Only an age of imperialism could have brought together two such different personalities as Shiratori and Gotō. Shiratori was the quintessential scholar, whose only thoughts about contemporary China were scornful and condescending.5 With the Japanese now ruling the roost in Manchuria as well as in Korea \(which would be officially annexed in a few years\), Shiratori saw a prime opportunity \(with Japanese military and financial support\) to get his hands on previously unseen quantities of documents lying dormant throughout the region. Gotō 

had another vision altogether, but that would not become apparent until their three reports were published in 1913–1914. Shiratori had mobilized the cream of Tōdai Sinology, all of whom were his students, to compile this work: five volumes with a total of about 2,250 pages. Considering the short time they had to prepare this research, Shiratori’s young men produced a magnificent piece of pioneering scholarship, a major inspiration to subsequent generations of Japanese, Chinese, and Western scholars.6

Gotō and subsequent SMR heads were not pleased, and the facility was immediately closed in 1914. Shiratori removed the materials to the Faculty of Letters at Tōdai and continued work for the next twenty years, producing another thirteen volumes of research. Gotō’s displeasure was with the lack of colonial drive on the part of the pedants who had collected the documents with his money. Whatever scholarship their work may have achieved, he found little worth in it for Japanese colonization of the region under study. This mix of scholarship and colonial policy, bunsō teki bubi in Gotō’s words, became the main research tradition at the SMR.

forgot this fact at times, the leaders never did. As Hara Kakuten has accurately noted, “research” organs were not established for the sake of scholarship, but to facilitate the management of Manchuria and the operations of the SMR. 

In the late 1910s, the Research Department \(or Research Section, as it was called after late 1908\) began slowly to expand its staff, principally through its EEB, to 51 employees in 1918. By 1926, the number reached 167, and after the Manchurian Incident of 18 September 1931 it began to mushroom. The post-World War I era witnessed a boom in research institutes in the private industrial sector in Japan, and a competition developed for staff from university graduates. Only around 1920 did the SMR begin to consider hiring youngsters fresh out of college.7 Itō Takeo, who completed school that year, recalls seeing an SMR recruitment poster on the Tōdai campus and going to sign up for a test. 

Why would a liberal-minded young man run off to join a colonial company in a foreign country? From the time he graduated from Tokyo University in 1920 until the end of the war, Itō Takeo’s life was consumed by SMR research on China. His autobiography is a fascinating document in the history of that immense Japanese colonial enterprise, its collection of invaluable materials on China, and the tragedy of those idealistic young men who went to work for the SMR and were broken by the Kwantung Army. As an undergraduate, Itō and his school buddies had become aware of large social issues of the day. 

Henry Smith has shown how these confused but concerned young men looked to themselves for standards the nation could no longer supply. Finally they formed the Shinjinkai \(New Man Society\), a liberal group of boys facing real problems in Japan and the world and posing timeless, imponderable questions about mankind. Ozaki Hotsumi, who later joined the SMR as a consultant, was one of Itō’s classmates also in the Shinjinkai. “The typical member of the Shinjinkai,” writes Chalmers Johnson, “adopted this socially tolerated method of student protest but took care not to go so far to the left as to endanger his chances for bureaucratic employment.”8

But why the SMR? Itō explains that through the Shinjinkai he and his friends met men they admired like Sano Manabu, who was active in social 7  Andō Hikotarō Mantetsu: Nihon teikokushugi to Chūgoku \(The SMR: Japanese Imperialism and China\) \(Tokyo: Ochanomizu shobō, 1965\), p. 236; Hara, “Mantetsu chōsabu no rekishi,”

movements in Japan and was also working for the EEB. They had already been introduced to China and the Chinese revolution through the lectures of one of their heroes, Professor Yoshino Sakuzō, the patron saint of Taishō democracy.9 

There was an excitement after World War I, when the Western powers were no longer so powerful in East Asia, about the possibilities for social reform, not just in Japan but all over East Asia. Manchuria was sparsely populated; Japan was feeling a population and job crunch; and peaceful expansion for economic development became a popular notion of Japan’s role in forging the new, postwar international order. It is worth reiterating that Japanese liberalism and reformism have never been strictly separated from something known generically as “Japanese imperialism.” Young men like Itō Takeo were not thinking about the conquest of Asia when they joined the SMR, and under their leadership many other like-minded young men came to the research agencies of the SMR. 

There were, however, other men associated with SMR research who had radically different ideas about the future of Northeast Asia. Take, by way of example, the case of Ōkawa Shūmei. A believer in Indian Buddhism, he made a sharp transition to radical pan-Asianism when he learned of British imperialism and its deleterious effect on the real India. Two years later, in 1918, he joined the EEB. In China he made contact with Kita Ikki, the noted fascist and former friend of Chinese revolutionary Sung Chiao-jen, and got to know others who would later form the extreme right wing. He attracted a good number of followers in Manchuria in the 1930s. 

Another group of right-wing SMR researchers who worked intimately with the Kwantung Army would include first and foremost Miyazaki Masayoshi. 

Miyazaki had studied in Moscow before World War I, and he was there at the time of the Bolshevik Revolution. He became the leading figure among SMR 

Russian specialists, particularly in economic matters. He later forged close ties with Ishiwara Kanji and the Kwantung Army, responding to their call for researchers to take a more active role in the military’s planning. He was there for the Kwantung Army at the time of the Manchurian Incident.10

It is much less difficult to understand why men like Ōkawa, Miyazaki, and those associated with such groups as the Manchurian Youth League went to 9  Itō,

work for the SMR. Nonetheless, the atmosphere among researchers was decidedly liberal and antimilitary. Every memoirist and every critic who has written about SMR research institutions, regardless of their political views, recalls the vibrantly open and free atmosphere there. That atmosphere made it possible for such different types to mix and work together. It also made research at the SMR and in Manchuria generally a much freer place than Japanese institutions or Japan.11 As the political climate moved to the right at home, the SMR would become a haven for many leftists under great pressures in the mother country. 

The Kwantung Army had high hopes for the research, but it was still unhappy at what it perceived to be a lack of direction on the part of the Research Section. For all their antimilitary feelings, the researchers could hardly fight the Kwantung Army; in fact, they often needed military protection in the field. 

This mutual need was satisfied when Sada Kōjirō became head of the Research Section in the mid-1920s. Sada worked hard to convince the Kwantung Army that by creating an anti-Japanese incident out of Chinese nationalism in Manchuria, the military could strengthen its hold in the region.12 It may not be too far-fetched to say that the Manchurian Incident was the result. 

After the Incident, it became increasingly apparent to many SMR researchers that they had no choice but to go along with the Kwantung Army. The volte-face of SMR President Uchida Kōsai illustrates this shift. Although initially antimilitary, after September 1931 he began proposing Manchurian independence, and he earned the disgust of many of his employees. By contrast, Vice-President Eguchi Teijō abruptly resigned, saying: “This \[Incident\] is Napoleon’s Moscow. It will end in dismal failure.” But, despite its harsher stance, the military still needed the research resources of the SMR to carry out its plans for construction in Manchuria/Manchukuo. It was able easily to entice Miyazaki Masayoshi and several others to plan the creation of an agency that would prepare policy for a new regime in Manchuria. Ultimately, they formed the Economic Research Association \(ERA\) within the SMR in January 1932, shortly before the establishment of the puppet state of Manchukuo was announced, 11  Noma Kiyoshi, “Mantetsu keizai chōsakai setchi zengo” \(The Establishment of the ERA of the SMR\), Rekishi hyōron 169 \(September 1964\): 69, 72; Andō, Mantetsu, p. 236; Yamada, Mantetsu chōsabu, p. 142; and Nakanishi Tsutomu, Chūgoku kakumei no arashi no naka de \(In the Tempest of the Chinese Revolution\) \(Tokyo: Aoki shoten, 1974\), pp. 78, 81.

Itō Takeo and the Research Work of the SMR Company 583

Miyazaki and his co-workers then moved en masse over to the ERA to help facilitate the passage of research information to the Kwantung Army.13

Loyal research staffers began to fear for their autonomy, one of the cherished traditions at the Research Section. Their leaders could no longer be trusted, for everyone knew that SMR presidents came and went as a function of party politics back home, and now the head of research, Sada Kōjirō, was demonstrating more fidelity to the military than to his own men. Word got out in mid-1933 that, at the Kwantung Army’s instigation, the Secretariat for Manchurian Affairs was planning a massive reorganization of the SMR to place it directly under the control of the military. Unified military control in the region, it was hoped, would facilitate economic and industrial development. 

The SMR employees association, under the leadership of Itō Takeo, decided to confront the army. They issued a manifesto which began with the words: 

“The SMR is an inheritance bequeathed by the Meiji Emperor, and it will permit no arbitrary violations.” As he vividly describes below, Itō immediately fell under a shadow, suspected by the military police and criticized openly by the Manchurian Youth League, but he persevered. The association decided to send representatives to the SMR stockholders’ meeting in Tokyo with the authority to speak on behalf of the entire SMR staff. Even the SMR board of directors tried to stop this “unthinkable” opposition to the Kwantung Army—unsuccessfully. Ultimately, Itō realized that the only sane solution was for the employees association to devise its own reorganization plan, which the military eventually accepted.14 Although ostensibly a victory, this was the last gasp of overt research independence. The Kwantung Army now had high hopes for research to be prepared by the ERA. 

It was one of the fascinating ironies of this whole subject that the man hired to head the Era’s “agricultural economy” desk a position of considerable importance and responsibility, was a well-known Marxist from Kyoto University, Ōgami Suehiro, a man much influenced by Japan’s first Marxist economist, Kawakami Hajime. Ōgami came to the SMR on the recommendation of his senior classmate from Kyōdai, Amano Motonosuke, perhaps the most famous scholar of Chinese agriculture in the postwar period and also a Marxist. From the mid-1930s, they and others brought numerous left-wing scholars onto the research staff. ERA research still served the needs of the military, and this fact 13  Itō,

no one denies. ERA staffers prepared enormous quantities of reports, surveys, and document collections on every aspect of the economy, natural resources, local industry, and agriculture of Manchuria and North China. Research for the strategic needs of the army was carried out in six areas—agriculture, the general economy, timber, livestock, marine produce, and transport.15

Although researchers could no longer oppose the military in their reports, there were several other means by which they might express their own views. 

For example, the 101 members of the ERA staff sent to study agriculture and water utilization based their examination on the unit of the village. After a thorough analysis of the contemporary state of village life, their reports often stressed rural poverty in China and the ill it boded for public order. 

Indeed, it could lead to banditry or rebellion, code words for anti-Japanese or Communist uprisings. The implication was clearly that unless conditions were improved, the Japanese Army would have monumental problems on its hands. 

Independent views might also see the light of day in one of the SMR serial publications. Tremendous debates transpired on such things as the nature of the Chinese economy, and the lingua franca of these debates was always Marxism. 

In addition there were private ways to retain one’s integrity, such as the study groups of SMR researchers on Marx’s Capital or Wittfogel’s work.16

In 1935 Itō Takeo was transferred to the SMR office in Tien-tsin, near the Chi-tung \(Kitō, in Japanese\) area recently demilitarized by the Japanese Army. 

He used his time to devise a rural investigation scheme for twenty-five villages in Chi-tung, to which the military promptly and unexpectedly consented. Itō 

was an avid student of the work of Liudvig I. Mad’iar, and he used the theories of this Hungarian refugee in the Soviet Union to frame the overall questions asked about the nature of Chinese villages, water control, and the like. 

Concern at this time with the Chinese village was not just an ERA phenomenon. Many scholars—John Lossing Buck, Wilhelm Wagner, Karl A. Wittfogel, and Mad’iar among others—focused on it as holding the secret to the Chinese 15  Yamada, Mantetsu chōsabu, pp. 132–33; Ishidō Kiyotomo, “Mantetsu chōsabu to Marukusushugi” \(The Research Department of the SMR and Marxism\), vol. 2 in Undō shi kenkyū \(Studies in the History of the Movement\), ed.

economy, and the works of all these foreign scholars were translated by SMR 

organs in the 1930s. Itō hoped that his fourteen teams \(thirty-one researchers in all\) would be able to apply “scientific” \(namely, social scientific\) methods and come up with “scientific” results. Although the reports were criticized then and Itō felt that they fell somewhat short of “science,” we are nonetheless indebted to these researchers for bequeathing us a wealth of data not otherwise available anywhere, even though it may have served the military’s needs. 

In actual fact, as Hara Kakuten has shown, some of the research findings did not accord with the military’s wishes, and this led to distrust and eventual tragedy for some of the researchers.17

After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in July 1937, the short-lived Industrial Department, which had replaced the ERA, was renamed the Research Department again \(the Research Section having been dissolved shortly after the founding of the ERA\). The military was becoming desperate, as it now needed large-scale integrated research for long-term planning. To that end, the Research Department underwent an enormous expansion from early 1939. The scholars brought onto the staff in the late 1930s were largely left-wing, socialists and Communists. This was precisely at the time when Marxism was all but banned in Japan, when \(as Yamada Gōichi put it\) if the expression shakai \(social\) appeared in the title of a book, it was usually confiscated. As Itō notes, and many have followed him in this regard, Japanese leftists were prepared to come to Manchuria for three reasons: their political movements in Japan had been crushed; they had been arrested and made tenkō \(true or false\); or their pasts were known and they were unable to find work at home. 

The SMR research organs welcomed them with open arms, especially because the SMR was expanding and because these people, politics aside, were trained in research and had a “scientific approach. Hama Masao put it well: 

“Between Japan and Manchuria there was an ‘intellectual time-zone change.’” 

Among the many leftists who joined the SMR in the late 1930s were Ishihama Tomoyuki, Hosokawa Karoku, Itō Ritsu, Gushima Kenzaburō, and Ozaki Hotsumi. Some of these fellows then helped others, and some came with letters of introduction from former members of the Shinjinkai to the SMR’s Shanghai office where Itō Takeo was now in charge. This body of leftists then proceeded, ironically, to aid the main players in Japan’s pursuance of total war.18

Itō Takeo and the Research Work of the SMR Company

The Kwantung Army must have been aware of all the thinkers of dangerous thoughts who were coming to work for the SMR. Staffer Yamaguchi Susumu recalls that when he left the Research Department in 1942 to return to Japan, he was given a party at a Shanghai restaurant, and the “Internationale” was sung by way of send-off.19 This would have been unimaginable in Japan, and the army must have known about such things. I have no definitive answer to this puzzle, just a few suggestions. Perhaps the army believed these tenkōsha had truly reformed. More likely the military’s need for overall large-scale research by a large number of well-trained social scientists, knowledgeable in the latest methodologies, outweighed immediate political interests. Men like Ōgami Suehiro were indeed Marxists, but only as intellectuals or theorists, not as movement activists. Might an otherwise obtuse military have been aware of such subtle distinctions? Might it have been willing to accept the value of Marxist analysis while keeping close wraps on any spread of a social \(or socialist\) movement in Manchuria or North China? 

Indeed, many left-wing researchers had managed to conceive of the role of Japanese imperialism as ultimately progressive as far as Manchuria’s and China’s social development were concerned. In 1937 Ōgami wrote an essay arguing that the perspective of class was appropriate to historical research but that, in the final analysis, the state took precedence over class. Most researchers buried themselves in the institutes of the SMR to wait out the war. 

Among the major “integrated” studies were the famous village investigations of North China, which have been used by Ramon Myers, Philip Huang, and most recently Prasenjit Duara. The SMR now had considerable experience with field work in Chinese villages \(throughout Manchuria and Chi-tung\), and a more thorough, long-term investigation was launched in 1940, completed in 1942. The fascinating background to this cycle of research has never been discussed in English. Although space precludes a detailed analysis here, one should at least note that, beyond the many volumes of research reports, an additional eighty or more articles were published in the SMR journal Mantetsu chōsa geppō  by these very researchers on Chinese agriculture and village society.20 This represents an untapped gold mine. The subjects of several other 19  Kusayanagi,

Niida Noboru makes three important points about these village studies: \(1\) While they were surely part of Japan’s colonial aims, the researchers themselves were just scholars, without any political motives. \(2\) The aim of the research was not to come up with a “definitive thesis” \( teisetsu\) but to find, insofar as they could, 

Itō Takeo and the Research Work of the SMR Company 587

massive, “integrated” studies can only be mentioned: Chinese property laws, the textile industry, financial structures and practices, inflation, rice markets and brokers, wartime economic conditions, and much more.21

A remarkable story surrounds perhaps the most interesting of the “integrated” projects of SMR research, discussed briefly by Itō: “The Investigation of the Resistance Capacity of the Chinese” \(Shina kōsenryoku chōsa\). The implications of such a study for military needs are self-explanatory. In mid-1938 a base office in Dairen was set up, and research began out of the Research Department branch offices in Nanking, Hankow, Canton, Tokyo, Hong Kong, and elsewhere, with the center of operations under Itō’s auspices in Shanghai. 

There were thirty researchers in all, including Ozaki Hotsumi. Nakanishi Tsutomu \(Kō\) had responsibility for writing up the group’s findings. 

Unbeknownst to all but a tiny handful of his co-workers was the fact that Nakanishi was all the time an operative of the Japan Communist Party \(JCP\). 

He had entered the Tō-A dōbun shoin \(East Asian Common Culture Academy\) in Shanghai m 1929, a common route into the SMR, and there he acquired a mastery of the Chinese language. During his time in school in China, he and several schoolmates developed overwhelming sympathies for the Chinese revolution, and they felt part of an international workers’ movement When he was finally expelled from school for his activities, he returned to Japan to take guidance from the JCP. 

He returned to China to enter the SMR \(presumably under a JCP directive\) in April 1934. Hidden away as a small cog in a mammoth machine, he made his own studies of the workers’ movement and general economic conditions in Manchuria, which were published in SMR journals in 1934–1935 and were completely in the analytical Marxist vein.22

By 1937 Nakanishi had developed the commonplace Communist depiction of the Chinese economy as “semifeudal and semicolonial.” Manchuria was different, however, and he broke with the party line and disagreed with Ōgami’s designation of “semifeudal” for the Northeast. In Manchuria, according to Nakanishi, one could clearly see the development of capitalism underway. The debate evolved in SMR serials, entirely in the language of Marxism, although it was not entirely a theoretical exercise. Nakanishi had been one of Itō Takeo’s Chi-tung village investigators, and he had spent fifty-five days in four villages \(one in each of four counties\), questioning locals about land practices and the like. His analysis of the “ruthless feudal exploitation” of landlords in China, backed up by large quantities of data, provided the background for several more research essays in SMR journals. He also travelled extensively in China on his own or to make political contacts.23

Throughout his years in China, Nakanishi was establishing and retaining contact with a small circle of JCP and CCP agents. What these contacts ultimately amounted to is difficult to surmise; for it is precisely in this extremely intriguing aspect of his activities in China that Nakanishi combines a large dose of boasting with little real information. The result is a combination of frustration and infuriation on the part of the reader of his memoirs, for even the names of his Chinese Communist contacts are usually only pseudonyms. 

Two words he repeats endlessly throughout his memoirs are undo \(the movement\) and soshiki \(the organization\).24

For some reason Nakanishi, a low-level SMR employee and a sub rosa Communist, received major responsibility in this project, most likely because he, of all people, was on good terms with the military. He had served for a time in the Shanghai office of the special services unit of the Kwantung Army. He threw himself into this new work with a supreme sense of confidence that could only have been supported by complete methodological certainty. His assessment of the resistance capacity of the Chinese was not simply going to be a comparison of Chinese and Japanese troop strength or abstract economic might. One had to analyze the specific nature of the formation under wartime conditions of China’s capacity to resist Japan materially, politically, and economically. The five basic elements to be studied in the formative process of Chinese resistance were: its weaknesses as a semicolonial, semifeudal states; its national development over the previous century, especially the 23  Yamada,

previous two decades; its backward rural economy; international conditions; and, finally, the Japanese occupation of China and the consequences of a guerrilla war.25

Two years after the commencement of research, a huge report was drawn up for submission to the Kwantung Army. It stressed the importance of political rather than purely economic factors in the mobilization of China’s capacity to resist. Although Nakanishi was attacked by a more devoted Marxist on his staff for not giving sufficient weight to economics, he took the blame for this and stressed that for him “politics” encompassed “revolution.” He argued that the political and economic realms had been inextricably united over the previous century of rapid modernization in China. And now the Japanese invasion had forced an alliance between the CCP and the KMT.26

China was an immense agrarian society, the report argued, and Japanese forces could occupy all of its major cities while the hinterland would become the bases of anti-Japanese resistance. For, and here Nakanishi injected results of his earlier research, the city and the village were not organically linked by economic ties as was the case in modern states. The links, such as existed, were extraeconomic. Researchers examined eleven places of Chinese resistance, especially in the countryside, and studied rural reconstruction, peasant mobilization, and the flow of goods to the resistance bases from foreign countries. They concluded that the Chinese could resist from the rural areas for an exceedingly long time in what would become a war of attrition, and that they would continue to receive military hardware from the USSR. In other words, Japan could not win military in China without stretching supply lines so far as to be unable to protect them. 

The report went on the compare the roles of the CCP and the KMT in mobilizing resistance. It found the key in the CCP’s superior political organization and military leadership. The Communists had been successful because they were implementing land reform programs to gain peasant support. The report emphasized that, because of the conditions of the United Front, these land policies were no longer aimed at eliminating private property in land or wiping out landlords as a class. By contrast, the KMT sought to preserve the landlord 25  Shina kōsenryoku chōsa iinkai, Shina kōsenryoku chōsa hōkoku \(Investigative Report into the Resistance Capacity of the Chinese\) \(Tokyo: San’ichi shobō, 1970\); Nakanishi, Chūgoku kakumei no arashi no naka de, pp. 220–21; and Hara, “Mantetsu chōsabu no rekishi,” part 41, Ajia keizai 24, 8 \(August 1983\): 83–84.

system; once trapped by the masses, such landlord-KMT types often realized they were better off with the Japanese, and Wang Ching-wei provided the perfect example. The fall of Hankow had made many Chinese landlords fear that support for Chiang Kai-shek would only insure their destruction, and that they now had to throw in their lot with the Japanese. But the real bases of resistance were in the rural hinterland, primarily under Communist control. Whereas the countryside could carry on economically without the urban areas, the reverse was not true. Thus, conquest of China’s coastal cities did not imply control over China and the end of resistance; in addition, without the flow of goods from the countryside it ultimately would be impossible even to hold these areas. 

After all, even after the fall of Hankow and Canton, unoccupied China was still larger than the continental United States.27

Even from this brief, skeletal description of an extraordinarily rich study, it should be clear that Nakanishi was right in almost every way. Japan could not defeat China militarily. When Mao Tse-tung’s “On Protracted War” became known shortly after this report was completed, it made many of the same points. Nakanishi now had to present his report to its sponsors, the Kwantung Army. He persuaded the commanding officer of Japan’s Nanking Army that what he had to say was important, and he and Gushima Kenzaburō, a collaborator on the study, travelled by military transport to Tokyo to make the same report to General Staff Headquarters. There they argued on the basis of their findings for a political end to the war in China. When they were finished there was silence; finally a young staff officer asked: “So, then, what sites would it best for us to bomb? I’d like to know the key points.” It is impossible to know if he was being sarcastic, if he was hiding something, or if he was just an idiot. They lectured elsewhere in Japan, before returning to China for engagements before military and civilian audiences in Peking, Chang-chia-k’ou, and elsewhere.28

As it became clear that the essential points of this study were in actuality taking place for all to see and defeat loomed large on the horizon, the military responded by “killing the messengers.” 

The first sign of trouble was the arrest in November 1941 by the Kempeitai \(military police of the Kwantung Army\) of Suzuki Kohei, Satō Daishirō, and about fifty other organizers of a peasant cooperative movement in northern Manchuria. Suzuki had been a member of the Shinjinkai at Tōdai, became 27  Hara, “Mantetsu chōsabu no rekishi,” part 41, pp. 86–87, 89–91; part 42, Ajia keizai 24, 9

involved in left-wing politics in the 1920s, was arrested three times in Japan, and was a well-known theorist and author of Manshū no nōgyō kikō \(The Structure of Manchurian Agriculture\). At the invitation of Ōgami Suehiro, he joined the Research Department, although he later broke with Ōgami theoretically stressing \(with Nakanishi\) that developing capitalism characterized Manchurian agriculture. He left the RD in July 1940 to devote himself to organizing peasants in Manchuria. For their part, the authorities saw the agricultural collective movement, and its founder Satō Daishirō in particular, as organizing peasants in the interest of the rural areas, not working for the greater glory of the Japanese Empire.29

In June 1942, Nakanishi was arrested. He had expected the ax to fall at any moment, especially after the arrest of his friend Ozaki Hotsumi, and had packed his bags in preparation for departure to Yenan where fellow JCP 

member Nosaka Sanzō spent the entire war. Nakanishi claims to have known that Ozaki was a JCP member, but nothing at all about the Sorge spy ring. The Kempeitai had been following him for some time, apparently having begun to suspect his Communist sympathies after hearing his report on the resistance capacity of the Chinese. Apprehended with him in this sweep were his longtime friends, classmates at the East Asian Common Culture Academy, and fellow sub rosa Communists Anzai Kuraji, Ozaki Shōtarō, and Nishizato Tatsuo.30

The Kempeitai became convinced that what linked all these groups—the peasants organizers, the Ozaki circle, and Nakanishi and other members of the JCP—was the SMR’s Research Department. No one was especially surprised then when the arrests moved over directly into the research staff. A Kempeitai order dated 17 September 1942 read in part:

\(1\) The complete picture of the Communist movement among those associated with the SMR has now become clear as a result of the 28 January operation \[arrests in the agricultural cooperative movement\]. \(2\) The Kempeitai of the Kwantung Army will move to extract and remove it. \(3\) The heads of the Kempeitai in the cities of Hsinking, Dairen, Harbin, Fengtien, and Chin-chou 29  Tanaka Takeo, Tachibana Shiraki to Satō Daishirō: Gassakusha ji-ken Satō Daishirō no shōgai \(Tachibana Shiraki and Satō Daishirō: The Agricultural Cooperative Incident and the Career of Satō Daishirō\) \(Tokyo: Ryōkei shosha, 1975\), pp. 1–5; Yamada, Mantetsu chōsabu, pp. 150–52; and Kodama Taizō, “Hiroku: Mantetsu chōsabu” \(Memoir: The Research Department of the SMR\), Chūō kōron 75, 13 \(December 1960\): 201, 203–204.

are responsible for the arrest and detention of suspects according to item one of the enclosure. Arrests will begin on 21 September.31

Roughly fifty researchers were rounded up late that September. Among them Ōgami was arrested in Kyoto, where he was back teaching economics at Kyoto University. A second group of SMR employees, including Itō Takeo, was arrested in June and July 1943. There he was reunited, with former members of the Shinjinkai, apparently one of the sufficient conditions for arrest. Ōgami and four others died of typhoid fever contracted in Manchurian prisons.32

The Kwantung Army had also begun a massive confiscation of books and periodicals in an effort to substantiate the existence of an intricate Communist plot among Japanese in Manchuria. The result was an 850-page tome, completed in 1944, entitled Zai-Man Nikkei kyō sanshugi undō \(The Communist Movement of Japanese in Manchuria\), It analyzed hundreds of books and articles principally from SMR publications for the political bent of the argument, and it described the background and activities of numerous SMR staffers. 

In spite of their expectation of being apprehended after others’ arrests, most SMR employees and subsequent commentators seem genuinely surprised that the “‘SMR Incident” took place. Weren’t these researchers, whatever their theoretical views, aiding and abetting the Kwantung Army’s conquest of Asia? 

Hadn’t they been providing the military with reams of research? The answer to both questions is, of course, yes. In fact, many lived out their lives with a profound sense of guilt. Ishidō Kiyotomo, a former Shinjinkai member from Tōdai and an SMR researcher, threw a wet blanket on this whole discussion several years ago when he argued that the SMR Incident has to be understood purely as an army operation. Zai-Man Nikkei kyōsanshugi undō, he argues, is a tissue of pure fiction, proof of nothing. If the SMR was packed with actively engaged Communists, why were those arrested charged as individual violators of the peace preservation law, and only a few charged as conspirators? The whole mess was an elaborate excuse for the military’s failures in China, he claims, and this helps explain why many arrested researchers languished in prison for several years before even being indicted.33 The authorities were unable to get their stories straight. With the exception of Nakanishi Tsutomu and a tiny handful of others, all talk of “Mantetsu Marxism” \(the term is Yamada Gōichi’s, but the idea is widespread\), he argues is utter nonsense.

Itō Takeo and the Research Work of the SMR Company 593

Except for the five who died of fever, arrested researchers did not suffer excessively in prison, certainly not as much as apprehended Chinese Communist guerrillas. Itō Takeo recalls their screams from regular torture sessions every evening, although he himself was scarcely ever questioned. Nakanishi says not a word about his prison experiences, interrogations, or torture; and he welcomes 15 August 1945 as a glorious event, a “May Fourth for East Asia.” Released from prison that November, he stayed in Tokyo to take his marching orders for the new postwar movement rather than return home to his certainly anxious family.34

At one point in his memoirs, Nakanishi, who became a celebrity in the postwar Communist movement in Japan, says of SMR field work:

Our immensely detailed research in no way served the cause of Japanese imperialism. Just before the 7 July \[1937\] invasion and war in China, the Japanese military authorities in North China requested of the research organs of the SMR a study of whether they could manage the five provinces of North China severed from South and Central China. The conclusion reached by the SMR study was no. 

Itō Takeo similarly suggests that the military attacked the SMR as part of an irrational, antiscientific bias. 

From the very beginning the military welcomed and made use of the results of our research activities, but as defeat in the war became more clearly ominous, the situation changed. They compelled intellectuals to provide all sorts of materials and to study them, but when the results of all this research pointed to defeat, it was extremely undesirable to them. Although the military realized that it would be defeated, they had to continue to fight, and in order to cover over this complex they abused their final authority and the Research Department of the SMR was liquidated. 

The dissolution of the Research Department did not have to wait for the 15th of August—it had occurred in the arrests of 1942–43. The real significance of the SMR Incident lay in the fascist assault and repression by the military of our scientific work.35

There is more than a kernel of truth in both these assessments. The Japanese military had some of the finest minds at their disposal to carry out the most detailed theoretical and field work studies that have ever been done by anyone in China. None of the researchers really fooled themselves into thinking that they were not collaborating with the army; many actually felt that, although 34  Itō,

they disagreed fundamentally with the military, in the final analysis they had the best interests of Japan and the Japanese at heart. The army listened closely to what SMR researchers said and wrote. 

The problem is that when an SMR report conflicted with what the army really wanted to do, as startlingly apparent in its response to Nakanishi’s report on China’s resistance capacity, the army simply ignored it. A comparison with the American military and the war in Vietnam suggests itself here. The United States was similarly fighting a limited war against a guerrilla foe with principal support in the villages \(not the cities\); and one can imagine General Westmoreland’s commissioning an American Nakanishi to prepare a report of the Vietnamese resistance and receiving exactly the same conclusions the Kwantung Army got. The interesting thing is that the U.S. Army, of course, had no such research operation as the SMR, and the U.S. government was often criticized in the 1960s for being colossally ignorant of Vietnamese realities; for, if it knew anything about its enemy and that enemy’s history, the argument went, it never would have waged such a land war in Southeast Asia. The Kwantung Army had the largest research institute in the world at its beck and call. When it commissioned just such a report, it simply ignored the conclusions, arrested the authors, and pressed on with a calamitous and brutal war. 

This experience should make us all pause and reflect. The simple fact that after 1932 the SMR researchers were not exercising free rein over the topics of their research is important. The vanity that one reads in the memoirs of those whose lives were linked to SMR research, vanity in the sense that their work, because of its “scientific” pretensions, was somehow beyond reproach, is startling. The army ran the whole show. The only freedom that researchers had was within parameters prescribed by the army. When the army needed a scapegoat, it blamed the researchers for reports full of Communist influence. 

The army did what it wanted. 

I think that the questions often raised about the utility of this immense volume of research bequeathed by the SMR may be meaningless. Philip Huang and others caution that however valuable the village studies may seem, they were ultimately the product of an aggressive occupying force. First of all, the village field work in Manchuria and China proper was but one tiny part of the SMR’s total research accomplishment. Second, researchers were clearly aware at the time of the extraordinary situation in which they found themselves. 

Third, if bias is imputed to researchers because of natural sympathies for their Japanese army sponsors \(something, in any event, that is patently false for the most part\), then would they not have striven to make their reports as accurate as possible? Finally, if there is any systemic prejudice in SMR research that 

Itō Takeo and the Research Work of the SMR Company 595

postwar scholars using this material should be aware of, it is ironically the general intellectual Marxist inclination of all the research, especially the village studies and the numerous articles published separately in SMR journals. 

In the postwar period many former SMR researchers found jobs without much difficulty in Japanese institutions of higher learning, something that had been virtually impossible for people of their general intellectual persuasion in the 1930s. Others became involved in leftist postwar politics. They lived with a mixture of guilt and pride: guilt for their service to Japanese imperialism; pride for their accomplishments as free-thinking scholars, a fact attested to by their arrest by the real perpetuators of aggression. Itō Takeo, Kazami Akira, and several others came together shortly after the war to organize a Sino-Japanese Friendship Association, which, like comparable associations elsewhere in the world, combined an uncritical respect for the People’s Republic of China with criticism for the policies of the Japanese government vis-à-vis China. When their delegations returned from trips to China, they reported on a new, liberated country, something rapidly approaching heaven on earth.36

A number of SMR researchers decided to stay in China after the collapse of Japan and the SMR. Some of these men wanted to facilitate the transfer of the SMR’s immense holdings to the Chinese. Although many returned to Japan after a period of five to ten years, they were instrumental in negotiating Sino-Japanese normalization. Yokogawa Jirō, an SMR sociologist arrested in 1943, remained in China for many years after 1945. Sarakura Masao, an employee in the Ore Deposit Geological Research Division of the SMR, chose to stay in the Northeast after the arrival of the Eighth Route Army. He worked for years with Chinese technicians to pass along the technological advances in Manchurian energy resources to the Chinese. Blamed for an accident and arrested as a 

“counterrevolutionary element,” he eventually was repatriated to Japan where he wrote his memoirs, Jinmin fuku nikki \(A Diary of Serving the People\). In it he explained that he felt the SMR had a responsibility that its nearly forty years of research not go for naught. 

Many of the SMR researchers who obtained university positions after the war became major figures in postwar East Asian studies. Village investigators Niida Noboru, Amano Motonosuke, and Hatada Takashi are just three of the most prominent names in three different fields. They have all gone to pains in the decades since the war’s end to assume some measure of guilt, albeit unconscious, for Japanese imperialism, while retaining a sense of pride in their truly 36  Itō,

596

Itō Takeo and the Research Work of the SMR Company

formidable accomplishments. This was also the only opportunity any of them would ever have to do field work in China. 

Itō Takeo first published his memoirs in 1964, long before the more recent spate of books on the SMR, the Research Department, and Manchuria itself. 

His book has become a minor classic in this area of research and remembrance in Japan, in part because he was able to bridge many ideological gulfs that otherwise separated Japanese connected to these events in China and Japan. The integrity of his position has reached a position that has now become virtually unassailable. His memoirs were the starting point for Yamada Gōichi’s study of the Research Department in 1977 and the most often quoted secondary source in Hara Kakuten’s mammoth study of the Research Department published a few years ago. 

When I first decided to translate Mantetsu ni ikite in 1984, I discussed it with Mr. Sakatani Yoshinao in Tokyo. It turned out that Mr. Sakatani was a close personal friend of Itō, and when he communicated the news Itō was overjoyed. 

He died shortly thereafter. I sent my draft translations of chapters to Sakatani as I completed them, and his corrections and comments amount to over one hundred pages. Was a translator ever so fortunate? Particular difficulty arose with a number of names of Germans who were invited to Japan as consultants in the early days of the SMR. All the biographical information supplied by Itō 

concerning Messrs. Thiess, Wiedfeldt, and others was simply copied uncritically by subsequent scholars \(Yamada, Hara, and others\) into their accounts, despite the fact \(as I recently discovered\) that this information is not completely correct. I have amended the translation in those few places where Itō 

introduced extraneous and incorrect material.37
