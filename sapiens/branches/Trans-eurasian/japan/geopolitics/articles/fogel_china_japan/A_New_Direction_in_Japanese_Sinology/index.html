[ Studies on the Relationship Between the Literati Class and Local Society in China], Tanigawa Michio 谷川道雄, ed. Kyoto: Kyoto University Press, 1983.
Historical materialism has dominated postwar Japanese historiography on China, but its great influence is now crumbling or, rather, in the process of being overcome. The noble postwar task of rescuing China from theorists of stagnation by giving her a history, making her historical development resemble that of any European country or Japan, and thus bringing her into the course of world history foundered ultimately when more facts proved exceptions than regularities to the “basic laws of world history.” One could point to traits in Chinese society over time which indicated developmental stages in modes of production. The next step of claiming thereby the unity of the universality of world history with the particularity of the Chinese experience proved considerably more problematic. The distinctiveness of Chinese society could never simply be generated by the “mode of production.” For example, large-scale land management (as a mode of production) and a despotic state structure did coexist in time but should not have, for theory dictated that small peasant management accompany the despotic state.">

  <p><strong>Chūgoku shitaifu kaikyū to chiiki shakai to no kankei ni tsuite no sōgōteki</strong> <strong>kenkyū</strong> 中国士大夫階級と地域社会との関係についての総合的研究</p>
<p>[ Studies on the Relationship Between the Literati Class and Local Society in China], Tanigawa Michio 谷川道雄, ed. Kyoto: Kyoto University Press, 1983.</p>
<p>Historical materialism has dominated postwar Japanese historiography on China, but its great influence is now crumbling or, rather, in the process of being overcome. The noble postwar task of rescuing China from theorists of stagnation by giving her a history, making her historical development resemble that of any European country or Japan, and thus bringing her into the course of world history foundered ultimately when more facts proved exceptions than regularities to the “basic laws of world history.” One could point to traits in Chinese society over time which indicated developmental stages in modes of production. The next step of claiming thereby the unity of the universality of world history with the particularity of the Chinese experience proved considerably more problematic. The distinctiveness of Chinese society could never simply be generated by the “mode of production.” For example, large-scale land management (as a mode of production) and a despotic state structure did coexist in time but should not have, for theory dictated that small peasant management accompany the despotic state.</p>
<p>The “basic laws” position (namely, the strict Marxist stance of stages of historical development through which all societies pass: ancient-slavery, medieval-feudalism, modern-capitalism) has been most closely identified in the postwar era with Tokyo University, although many prewar Marxist scholars were educated at Kyoto University. Niida Noboru’s 仁井田陞 impassioned declaration in the early 1950’s equated the identification of a “feudal” era in China (when and how it developed, what it was, and when and how it was overcome) with the very return to China of her history. This identification virtually constituted a humanitarian act.1 That was over thirty years ago, and little of</p>

<p>A New Direction in Japanese Sinology</p>
<p>theoretical substance has been added to this position since. Much research has called this whole paradigm into question. The recent and most telling rebuttals of the Marxist analysis of Chinese history have come from Kyoto, first from her medieval and ancient historians and now in a comprehensive treatment covering Chou through late Ch‘ing in the volume under review. The study group that produced this volume met at regular intervals in Kyoto over a three-year period (1980–82), with scholars coming from as far south as Okinawa and as far north as Sendai, though the overwhelming majority of contributors were trained at Kyoto University.</p>
<p>The volume is a collection of fifteen essays, preceded by a summary introduction by Tanigawa Michio, one of Japan’s leading historians of medieval China. The book is not primarily focused on refuting Marxism, but implicit in the way Tanigawa and the other authors construct the central problem is a refutation. The impetus for convening the study group from which this volume emerged was a general dissatisfaction with our understanding of the distinctiveness of Chinese society and a search, not temporally fixed, for the nature of the shih-ta-fu 2 士大夫 or literati class as a ruling elite distinctive to premodern China (defined here as pre-Western impact). Before getting entangled in the issues of the shih-ta-fu as property owners or as a talent pool for the despotic state to transform into bureaucrats, these essays locate the shih-ta-fu’s most basic element in their direct contact with the common people and the arena of that contact—local society—where the two groups coexisted.</p>
<p>Once we can answer such questions as how to differentiate the shih-ta-fu and the common people over time, or how the shih-ta-fu were able to maintain control in local society, we will know much more about the basic structure of Chinese society.</p>
<p>Who were the shih-ta-fu, and how old is the term? The expression shih-ta-fu originates in the Chou ruling hierarchy of ch‘ing  郷 (minister), ta-fu or tai-fu 大夫 (lower rank of minister), and shih 士 (“knight”)—all beneath the princes and feudal lords of the Ch‘un-ch‘iu period.3 Tanigawa argues that, as a historical category, shih-ta-fu had already begun to take form in the Eastern Chou.</p>

<p>vassal powers under the Chou feudal system. While the shu-jen’s primary social function was to produce on the land, the ruling class as a body enjoyed religio-ceremonial and military duties. In this way, the two major classes of ancient China complemented each other’s functions.</p>
<p>Most analysts have been considerably less sanguine about the nature of elite-mass relations in ancient China, even those who have studied the phenomenon. But Tanigawa is not focusing on oppression and its instruments per se as an index to the origins of a local elite; rather, he is trying to come to terms with the origins of that elite (and indeed its oppressive capacity) by using something other than economic determinism or a spruced up version of the same. This remains implicit, however.</p>
<p>The ruling class lived off the produce of feudally allocated lands which provided an economic basis for their ceremonial and military needs. Scholars have long debated the role of shu-jen in all this. At the same time that the ruling class enjoyed special privileges, it also bore the task of supervising and maintaining order for the whole of society. The difficulty of distinguishing the elite’s privileges from its duties remains the distinctive inconsistency or contradition of China’s elite. Rarely has the class structure of Chinese society been addressed on the basis of this “contradiction.” If this contradictory nature of shih-ta-fu persists through Chinese history, then it may prove useful in understanding Chinese social structure.</p>
<p>In the Chou, membership in the ruling class was determined by the clans that constituted that class. The clans reproduced themselves by offering the appropriate training to clan members who were prospective members of the elite. The Six Arts comprised the basis of this education and included training in ceremonial and military matters. The special privileges, beginning in the Chou, afforded the shih-ta-fu a certain transcendent power. These privileges were in part exercised through Confucian education and learning, which was in turn linked to a moral consciousness on the part of the shih-ta-fu as the guardians or superintendents of local society.</p>
<p>The first essay in this volume, “Chūgoku kodai kanryōsei keisei ni kansuru ichi shikaku” 中国古代官僚制形成に関するー視角 [“One Perspective on</p>
<p>the Formation of the Bureaucracy in Ancient China”], by Emura Haruki 江村</p>
<p>治樹 (Nagoya University), addresses the Warring States period. The ruling elite of the Western Chou appear clear to us in origin, economic base, and social and political roles because of the overriding importance of clan ties to society and politics. But in the Eastern Chou, as a bureaucratic system and a centralized ( chün-hsien  郡県) empire began to take shape, relationships between rulers and ruled become less evident. Emura begins with the basic issue of the nature of the new ruling class of officials, and he questions the view of Masubuchi</p>
<p>600</p>
<p>A New Direction in Japanese Sinology</p>
<p>Tatsuo 増淵龍夫, who has argued that a patriarchal bureaucracy emerged in the territorial states at the end of the Eastern Chou.4</p>
<p>While not openly disagreeing with Masubuchi’s construction of the problem, Emura stresses that Masubuchi looked solely at the sovereign-minister (or lord-vassal, chün-ch‘en 君巨) personal bonds and not at the social environment which gave rise to them. Emura points out that Confucian as well as Mohist philosophers of the Warring States period called for the bureaucratic recruitment of “men of virtue” ( hsien-che  賢者), and that in fact men were often selected on the basis of their demonstrated “virtue.”5 He wants to revise the generally held theory that the chün-ch‘en bond brought a gross inbalance to rulership, and he shows with a healthy use of the Shih-chi 史記 that designations of “virtue” were often based on popular views.</p>
<p>In graphic terms, Emura is suggesting that the relationship of sovereign-minister-populace was not a strictly vertical despotism. The ministers, upon receiving the confidence of the people, were honored by the sovereign. In other words, by the Warring States era the officials enjoyed a greater degree of autonomy than had their precursors when the tsung-fa 宗法 system was still intact.</p>

He examines the meanings of the two expressions shu-jen and shih-wu as they appear in the Shih-chi and Han-shu 漢書. Tomiya argues that shu-jen were: (a) people freed from slave or servitude status; (b) exonerated or pardoned criminals; and (c) men of high station 4  First in Masubuchi’s “Sengoku kanryōsei no ichi seikaku” 戦国官僚制の一性格 [“One Characteristic of the Bureaucracy of the Warring States Period”], Shakai keizai shigaku 社会</p>

<p>who had committed a crime. The recurrent expression mien wei shu-jen 免為</p>
<p>庶人 does not, he claims, refer to dismissed officials returned to commoner status.6 Following the suggestion of Tsuruma Kazuyuki 鶴間和幸,7 Tomiya believes this expression referred to officials who, for one reason or another, were relieved of their stipends. Shih-wu referred to the rank held by an official ( shih  士) who, for the commission of an offense, had been stripped of the rank he held and his stipend. In other words, it was a rank within the official status system of “zero rank,” the mark of Cain if you will.</p>
<p>Tomiya’s interesting conclusion is that receiving a stipend and possession of shih rank are what distinguished official from commoner in Ch‘in-Han society.</p>
<p>In the Chou this distinction had been based on the blood relations stipulated by tsung-fa principles; in Ch‘in-Han times, imperial power seems to constitute the decisive element. In the subsequent era of disunion, the Six Dynasties period, the situation will again change. Noteworthy, though, is the enhanced degree of autonomy for the shih-ta-fu class from Chou to Han.</p>
<p>Kawakatsu Yoshio 川勝義雄 (Kyoto University), who has contributed more than any other scholar to our understanding of the developing autonomy of the local intellectual elite, has argued that the late Later Han marks the end of an era (China’s ancient period), as the ch‘ing-liu 清流 (Pure Stream) movement presages the origins of the aristocratic class of the Six Dynasties era.8 Although Kawakatsu did not contribute to this volume, Higashi Shinji 東晉次 (Ehime University) follows his lead in the essay, “Go-Kan chishiki kaisō no keisei ni kansuru oboegaki” 後漢知識階層の形成に関する覚書 [“Notes on the</p>
<p>Formation of the Intellectual Class in the Later Han”].</p>
<p>Higashi sees the formation of a shih 士 class (or “intellectual class,” as he puts it), with a sense of leadership responsibilities in all spheres, beginning from the time of Han Wu-ti 漢武帝 and the official sanctioning of Confucianism. By the end of the Former Han, shih groups had established a virtually national network. Higashi, however, wants also to stress the process of maturation undergone by local society which accompanied the formation of a local intelligentsia. The rise in popularity of Confucianism led to the 6  This was the position taken by Katakura Minoru 片倉壤, “Kandai no shigo” 漢代の士伍</p>

<p>development, particularly from the middle of the Later Han, of new personal bonds within the officialdom of teacher and disciple (or school). At the same time that they were charged with maintaining local order, local officials who taught in the areas to which they had been sent also forged such bonds. Higashi concludes that the link between the formation of a shih class and the spread of Confucianism insured that they would emerge as an intellectual class.</p>
<p>They were tied to their positions in local society, while it acquired autonomy through them. Both the Chou ruling class and the shih in the Warring States, Ch‘in, and Former Han enjoyed a position removed from and above local society and people, but the intellectual class from Later Han into the Six Dynasties, according to Higashi, clearly possessed a sense of independence extraordinary for any era in Chinese history. We have good reason to call them an aristocracy.</p>
<p>Ueda Sanae 上田早苗 (Nara Women’s University) examines the function of Confucianism in the control of local society by shih-ta-fu in his study</p>
<p>“ ‘Gatsuryō’ to Go-Kan shakai: kyūjutsu o megutte”「月令」と後漢社会：救 </p>
<p>恤をめぐって [“ ‘Yüeh-ling’ and Later Han Society: On Relief”]. He focuses on the relationship between politics and local society, on the one hand, and the ku-wen 古文 (ancient text) school, on the other, by looking at the uses to which one text, the “Yüeh-ling” 月令 (a chapter of the Li-chi 礼記), was put.</p>
<p>Wang Mang 王莽 and his “political advisors,” Liu Hsiang 劉向 and Liu Hsin 劉歆, were the first to use the “Yüeh-ling” politically in a series of policies for nurturing and securing the people’s livelihood. In the Later Han, Emperor Chang 章帝 cited the “Yüeh-ling” as an authority in his efforts to bring relief to the impoverished and destitute by opening lands for them to work.</p>

In it he recorded the production activities and the everyday lives of these landed clans. Son of a ku-wen scholar who had studied under a man Emperor Chang had sought as his own teacher, Ts‘ui wrote his book towards the end of the Later Han with the aim of restoring local social control to the landed clans through relief work. Because the central government proved incapable in the latter half of the second century, it fell completely to the landed clans to bring aid to local society.

<p>with a discussion of how the Five Pecks of Rice Movement 五斗米道 based their system of charitable inns upon “Yüeh-ling” prescriptions.</p>
<p>The spread of the ku-wen movement at the end of the Later Han provides the background for Yoshikawa Tadao’s 吉川忠夫 (Kyoto University) essay,</p>
<p>“Go-Kanmatsu ni okeru Keishū no gakujutsu” 後漢末における荆州の</p>
<p>学術 [“Scholarship in Ching-chou at the End of the Later Han”]. With the disintegration of state unity towards the end of the Later Han, the empire split into provincial entities centered upon the official headquarters of the privin-cial governor or chou-mu  州牧. Ching-chou 荆州 was one such region, and Liu Piao 劉表 was provincial governor there. Great scholars from the North came together and formed an erudite cultural “salon” under Liu’s patronage.</p>
<p>Yoshikawa argues that the highest quality scholars in the entire country comprised what might have appeared merely as a salon from the outside, and that the social fluidity of chaotic times led to the cohesion of this national-level phenomenon at a specific locale.</p>
<p>What Higashi cites as the autonomous inclinations of local society are evident in Ching-chou, according to Yoshikawa. Here we do not simply have one locality in conflict with the center, but a locality which contains something of the center. The scholarly mold associated with Ching-chou spread to other regions of China as well. In this way, he argues, it was a harbinger of scholarship in the Six Dynasties, based on ku-wen values with broad intellectual concerns beyond Confucianism to include mathematics, divination, medicine, alchemy, archery, and so on. Yoshikawa groups all of these fields so as to characterize Ching-chou learning as humanistic studies (  jen-wen-hsüeh 人文学</p>
<p>[ jimbungaku]).</p>
<p>Learning or scholarship itself, then, became for shih-ta-fu a great system encompassing the principles of the universe as well as techniques for everyday life. As we begin to move into the Six Dynasties era, a problem confronts us: on what basis did the shih-ta-fu, as the foci of intellectual leadership and particularly as hao-tsu in local society, form relations of coexistence with the local populace? How, in other words, were their special privileges as a ruling class transcended? Tanigawa himself has written at length on this question and has located his solution in the moral ethic of the shih-ta-fu.10 Tsuzuki Akiko 都築</p>
<p>晶子 (Ryūkyū University) takes this one step further in her important essay, 10  See, in particular, Tanigawa’s “Chūgoku chūsei shakai ron josetsu” 中国中世社会論序</p>

<p>合について [“Retired Scholars and Local Society: The Unification of Local Society From the End of the Later Han Through Wei-Chin”].</p>
<p>Tsuzuki’s refinement of the Tanigawa thesis focuses on the scholars in retirement ( ch‘u-shih 処士) as an intermediary group between the great landed clans (hao-tsu) and the people. From the end of the Later Han, men known as ch‘u-shih abandoned the salacious political world, content to pass lives of honorable poverty, out of office, as self-made protectors of the Confucian faith.</p>
<p>Their assumption of the life-style of a kind of sage apparently won the support of many people, and when the organization of local society crumbled they became leaders in the effort to reorganize it. Although originally one element of the landed clans, retired scholars dissociated themselves from what they perceived as the decadence to which the landed clans had declined and inaugurated a movement to purify landed clan leadership in local society.</p>
<p>Tsuzuki points out that the success of retired scholars in this effort can be seen in the Wei-Chin period when members of the landed clans class attained higher cultural (and ethical) aims in an aristocratic society patterned after the retired scholar life-style. In this way the contradiction of a hao-tsu class positioned in one corner of society while at the same time ruling all of society is resolved through the mediation of the ch‘u-shih. One of Tsuzuki’s essential points is that the aristocratic houses of the Six Dynasties period formed a kind of “public institution” ( kōkyō kikan 公共機関) for local society.</p>
<p>In his introduction, Tanigawa suggests a political aspect in this development from self-centeredness ( ssu  私) to public-mindedness ( kung  公) on the part of the local elite. The “aristocracy” was another name for the class prominence of the shih-ta-fu, who now owed their social position not to imperial endowment but to having granted it among themselves on the basis of their allegiance to the Pure Stream movement and “local reputation” ( hsiang-lun 郷論). Again the links to local society emerge. The Later Han witnessed both the formation of a distinctive shih-ta-fu class and the maturation of local society, processes which continued into the subsequent era. The permeation of the aristocratic system into local society profoundly influenced local administration.</p>
<p>A major change in the bureaucratic state of the Six Dynasties period was the remarkable increase in the authority of the local aristocracy for the delegation of office. The more a regime sought security, the more it had to abide by this reordering of priorities, a situation unique to this era of political disunion.</p>

<p>Regimes might rise with military might and establish a supreme military government, but they had to accommodate the local aristocracy in the assignment of official posts. The example of the Northern Wei provides a clear illustration of this development from a military to a civil state. At first the regime established garrisons ( chen 鎮) to secure local control, and later many of these were converted into regular political districts ( chou 州). This also betokened a state of non-Chinese, Northern origin ( T‘o-pa 拓跋) becoming encompassed in the “civilizing” aristocratic system. Emperor Hsiao-wen’s 孝文帝 (r. 471–500) policy of “detailed determination of families and clans” ( hsing-tsu hsiang-ting 姓族詳定) less than a century after T‘o-pa warriors first conquered North China implied the conclusion of this process, as the state now sought stability through accommodation with the Han aristocratic system.11</p>
<p>Yasuda Jirō 安田二郎 (Tōhoku University) deals with this problem for the Hsiang-yang 襄陽 area (Hupei) in the first half of the fifth century in his essay</p>

<p>civil one, Yasuda argues, migrants were integrated into the order of the aristocratic system. This reformation of the aristocratic order tells us much about the influence exercised by these migrant shih from illustrious Northern Chinese families who could no longer abide life under military rule in their native areas.</p>
<p>Yasuda’s argument describes the spread and leveling of aristocratic society.</p>
<p>The aristocratic families of migrant shih were initially not regarded as equals of the great Southern houses which enjoyed imperial patronage. Dissatisfaction on the part of the poorer local houses with stagnation, specifically that of the centrally chosen illustrious lines, became a powerful motive force for dynastic change in the tumultuous Southern dynasties. This served both to breathe life into aristocratic society as well as to effect an equalization within the entire aristocratic class, again evidencing that the root of the aristocratic system lay in local society.</p>
<p>Interestingly, when the Northern Wei fell into a state of crisis, it was Han Chinese shih-ta-fu who supported it by organizing military blocs at the local level. How this process unfolded in the Shantung 山東 area is described by Kegasawa Yasunori 気賀沢保規 (Toyama University) in his piece, “Tō-Gi Hoku-Sai seiken to Kanjin” 東魏=北斉政権と漢人 [“The Eastern Wei-Northern Ch‘i Regime and Han Chinese”]. At the end of the Northern Wei, rebellions arose in reaction to the estrangement of the official aristocratic lineage system from both the realm of families of Northern stock as well as from Han local society, a topic Tanigawa has studied more than anyone else.13</p>
<p>The reaction was led by Han shih-ta-fu who rallied soldiers of non-Chinese stock together with local militias. In contrast to the transition from Western Wei to Northern Chou, when these two forces fought together to topple the aristocratic ranking system itself, in the Shantung region we witness the two forces intent on reviving a stagnating aristocratic system. Kegasawa shows how the latter attempt ended in frustration and failure. One commonality he cites between these two historical transitions is the link between the Han shih-ta-fu 13  See, for example, “Hoku-Gi tōitsu teikoku no shihai kōzō to kizokusei shakai” 北魏統</p>

<p>and local society. He also provides an analysis of the complex power structure of the Eastern Wei-Northern Ch‘i which was tied to the Shantung locality.</p>
<p>The Six Dynasties period, then, marked the heyday for shih-ta-fu autonomy as a class, an autonomy supported in local society and which in fact signalled the rise to prominence of local society itself. With Sui reunification of China came the abolition of earlier institutions for official appointment, as well as the transformation of the Nine Ranks 九品 system for official recruitment into the examination system. Both developments served to dissolve the unity of the shih-ta-fu class and political power, wherein local society functioned as intermediary. Yet Tanigawa sees this reverse as only institutional, for the historical movement which had propelled local society into political power was rooted in the shih-ta-fu class and would continue even after the Sui made these institutional reforms. The movements described by Yasuda and Kegasawa indicate a process at work from the end of the Later Han through the Six Dynasties, and the formation of military blocs from the Western Wei through the Sui was part of this process.14 Nor did this movement come to a halt in the Sui, for the rebels that rose at the end of the Sui emerged as leaders of local military blocs. Thus, over this four-century period, local society gave birth to leadership strata one after another with each new wave of political reform; and these leaders shared political power and formed an aristocratic class. Tanigawa has argued that the overall group of new and old shih-ta-fu—from officially acknowledged houses, to the newer aristocratic class of poor and Northern-origin families, to the civil and military officials who rose in the late Sui rivalries—ultimately comprised a massive reservoir for the T‘ang bureaucracy.</p>
<p>It was only when a unified T‘ang secured its base of power that this wave motion was calmed and the Sui institutional reforms actually achieved success. To preserve their position, the shih-ta-fu class had to ally itself closely to central power, and in fact many of the aristocratic houses moved from their native places to the capital. Where, then, did that leave local society?</p>
<p>Otagi Hajime 愛宕元 (Kyoto University) approaches this problem by examining the life of one shih from the era of the great Southern dynastic houses, and his descendants, in the essay “Tōdai Konan shakai no shūkyōteki kankei o baikai to shita shijin to chiiki shakai: Junshū Jinseikan Gi hōshi hi o tegakari ni” 唐代江南社会の宗教的関係を媒介とした士人と地域社会: 潤州仁</p>

<p>静観魏法師碑を手掛りに [“Shih and Local Society Mediated by Religious Contacts in Kiangnan society Under the T‘ang: The Stone Inscription to Taoist Priest Wei at the Jen-ching Monastery in Jun-chou (Kiangsu)”]. The inscription eulogizes a Taoist priest by the name of Wei Lung 魏隆 born at the very end of the sixth century into a poor but noble house tracing its roots back into the Liang and Ch‘en dynasties. Inscribed on the reverse side of the stone were 540 names, seventy-six of whom, all from the same village, bear the surname Wei. They included commoners, priests, and officials (with low local positions, some in education). Otagi’s point is to demonstrate that the Weis protected their positions as low-level officials from the Southern Dynasties, and were able to retain a latent power in the Chien-k‘ang 建康 (Nanking 南京) region.</p>
<p>Otagi also shows how they retained leadership roles in local society through the religious authority of Taoism. The Weis preserved local offices through the system jen-tzu 任子 (hereditary transmission of official position), and since jen-tzu was itself in the late Six Dynasties and early T‘ang a deformed incarnation of the aristocratic system, Otagi regards the power of Wei descendants as a product of the Six Dynasties aristocratic system in decline. On the other hand, the fact that the Weis continued to exercise influence in local society in the years under study implies a continuity from the Six Dynasties through the Sui and into the T‘ang.</p>
<p>What effect did the T‘ang-Sung transition have on the nature of bureaucratic recruitment and the local officialdom? Chikusa Masaaki 竺沙雅章 (Kyoto University) deals with this theme in his essay, “Sōdai kanryō no kikyo ni tsuite”</p>
<p>宋代官僚の寄居について [“On the Temporary Lodgings of Sung Period</p>
<p>Officials”].15 From the Sung era, the shih-ta-fu class became virtually indistin-guishable in meaning from the bureaucracy. Chikusa sheds light on shih-ta-fu lifestyles in the Sung from the standpoint of the bureaucracy by looking at a host of issues concerning “officials in temporary residence.” There were many officials in the Sung, but not nearly enough posts to go around. As a result, many without official positions, for example those awaiting new appoint-ments, took up temporary lodgings in convenient areas and often engaged in illegal activities such as the confiscation of local lands. The court responded by enforcing various interdictions in an effort to break the link between such officials and the lands on which they were resident. Chikusa sees the shih-ta-fu actions as a desire to secure personal stability and wealth (which the officialdom had as yet failed to offer them), and the government’s bans as especially 15  A shortened version of his fuller piece which appeared in Tōyōshi kenkyū  東洋史研究</p>

<p>severe. We have here one indication (with evidence drawn from a variety of locales) of the change from T‘ang to Sung in the life of bureaucrats.</p>
<p>Unlike the earlier Six Dynasties period, the immediate basis for the shih-ta-fu from the Sung on was not local society. Now they owed their existence to the official status gained through the examination system. In the Six Dynasties, the aristocratic class had been bureaucrats because shih-ta-fu  were recognized through the local recommendation system. From the Sung, however, it was on the contrary one’s existence as a bureaucrat which led to recognition as a shih-ta-fu. From this perspective, the T‘ang-Sung transition gives the appearance of having caused a reversal, but the process was not merely contingent on dynastic change but rather part of a larger historical continuity.</p>
<p>Even Max Weber noted that examination officials in China were not administrative specialists but educative politicians. The examinations tested one’s understanding of classical learning and ideas on public policy. Tanigawa feels they thus embodied a shih-ta-fu spirit that combined knowledge and morality.</p>
<p>In other words, examination officials were not imperial lackeys but men saddled with the burdensome political task of governance in the realm. Although we might detect similarities here with the role of knowledge and morality in the relations of the Six Dynasties aristocracy to local society, after the Sung all blood or regional elements associated with family status or clan connections for the shih-ta-fu class had to be abstracted or sublimated into the bureaucratic system itself. Moreover, the method for establishing one’s knowledge and morality was completely objectified from the local recommendation system into the examination system.</p>
<p>We must, then, ask what meaning “local society” had for shih-ta-fu from the Sung era on, and what meaning shih-ta-fu had for local society. Heinous acts of illegality on the lands where shih-ta-fu temporarily resided, as documented by Chikusa, represent one point of contact, a negative manifestation of the examination bureaucrat’s abstracting autonomy in local society.16 Chikusa also discusses positive efforts by locally resident scholars to aid people in need by cooperating with the local administration, and thereby gaining local trust.</p>
<p>The most interesting conceptual essay (and the only one to touch on the Ming dynasty) is Mori Masao’s 森正夫 (Nagoya University) look at the situation confronting shih-ta-fu from the Sung through the Ch‘ing, “Sōdai igo no 16  Chikusa has dealt with a similar issue in his “Hoku-Sō shitaifu no shikyo to baiden, omo ni Tōha sekitoku o shiryō to shite” 北宋士大夫の徙居と買田:主に東坡尺牘を資 </p>

<p>社会: 問題点の模索 [“Shih-ta-fu and Local Society from the Sung Dynasty On: In Search of the Issues”]. While generally praising postwar Japanese studies of landlordism which have elucidated the material base of China’s ruling class from the Sung on, Mori expresses considerable dissatisfaction with scholarship on the intellectual and moral leadership of the ruling elite in the same era.17 The former does not provide us ipso facto with the latter. The ordered integration of society toward which the ruling class strived was the essence of their intellectual-moral leadership, and this was manifest, of course, at the level of local society. A problem immediately presents itself, for as we have just noted, to the extent that the post-T‘ang shih-ta-fu class and the examination officialdom were identical groups, the intervention of local society was no longer necessary. Logic aside, Mori points out, the realities of history demonstrate that the relationship between shih-ta-fu and local society became closer with each subsequent era. Each age brought the examination system further into local society, while local public and private educational facilities expanded considerably. Remarkable growth in the number of those sitting for the examinations led to the development of a literate class remaining in local society, reaching down even to the level of the peasantry.</p>
<p>Mori treats separately the shih-ta-fu of the Sung-Yüan, Ming, and the Ch‘ing.</p>
<p>Past scholarship on the Sung and Yüan has shown a tendency among shih-ta-fu to live as “retired scholars” with heart and soul devoted to local society in complete rejection of the bureaucratic world.18 Even the shih-yin 市隠 (literally, those who escape the world and live in hiding in the marketplace) of the Ming were a kind of shih-ta-fu linked to these earlier models. Miyazaki Ichisada 宮崎</p>
<p>市定 posed this shih-yin type in contrast to bureaucrats pursuing careers while remaining in contact with their own native areas.19 Mori goes one step further 17  Mori published a series of review essays on Japanese theories concerning the Chinese gentry: “Nihon no Min-Shin jidai shi kenkyū ni okeru kyōshinron ni tsuite” 日本の明</p>

<p>in documenting cases of shih-ta-fu resident in rural villages: namely, intellectuals with Confucian training but with no interest whatsoever in becoming examination officials. Their tenacious moral and intellectual leadership, linked to individual character led, Mori says, to the formation of a rural integration of shih and commoner.</p>
<p>The question remains as to how we are to link (a) the fact that an examination officialdom emerges in the Sung era without the need for the intermediacy of local society, and (b) the leadership role of shih-ta-fu in local society. Mori suggests an avenue to resolving this dilemma in the ch‘u-shih, the “retired” or</p>
<p>“distancing” (from central politics) quality, of shih-ta-fu. Although many young intellectuals were educated and qualified to serve as bureaucrats, ossifica-tion and decay in the political realm made such careers impossible for them, and they left the official career route in search of a path to independence.</p>
<p>They were not trained simply as imperial toadies, but had a moral and intellectual leadership component in their own self-conception, and this aspect compelled them to choose a “retired” life-style. This, then, is the link which resolves Mori’s “antinomy,” for among the examination officials themselves there coexisted two opposing tendencies: cogs in a bureaucratic structure on the one hand, they sought personal autonomy on the other. This latter aspect, a response to perceived crassness in the official world, pushed many shih-ta-fu away from major population centers and into a cohesive bond with local society. At the same time, Mori notes, local society was also being adversely affected by bureaucratic decadence, and the “retired” group of shih-ta-fu served to bring relief to local society and expunge this pernicious influence.</p>
<p>Although he deals with an altogether different period from Tsuzuki Akiko, Mori’s treatment of the “retired scholar” aspect of the shih-ta-fu resembles her analysis of retired scholars in the late Later Han. The earlier retired scholars were manifestations of the pure shih-ta-fu spirit, but surely some of that spirit rubbed off on shih-ta-fu in office. This spirit is represented by Chikusa’s locally resident scholars, but either at home or as temporary residents elsewhere the shih-ta-fu were linked to local society in their role as “educators.”</p>
<p>Morita Kenji 森田憲司 (Nara University) addresses the educational role played by low-level scholars in local society during the Yüan period in his essay “Sainanro kyōju Ri Teijitsu o megutte: Hibun no senja to shite no kyōkansō” 済南路教授李庭実をめぐって:碑文の撰者としての教官層</p>

<p>the relationship between people who wanted stone steles inscribed to their ancestors and the person asked to do the inscriptions, Li T‘ing-shih. Offically, Li served in a local educational capacity along two circuits in Shantung. His clients for inscriptions mostly included low-level local bureaucrats and some peasants; Morita regards this group as the leaders of the lowest unit of local society. Even Li was not sufficiently important to warrant mention in the official history. In addition to their educational duties, Morita argues, Confucian officials performed such tasks as carving stone inscriptions for local men of influence, and they often left a record of this in the county gazetteer. He offers a fascinating insight into this side occupation, the human links it fostered, and the centrality of local schools and the local educational system to this process.</p>
<p>Where Mori’s essay notes that the development of the examination system and educational institutions contributed to increasing the body of the shih-ta-fu group locally, Morita’s work specifically traces this development to clarify the cultural position of schools in local society. One might ask where the Taoist views located by Otagi in Kiangnan fit into this picture. Tanigawa suggests that the local educational establishment was severely constricted by the center, and that it could only restore its cultural-educational function by assuming various diverse forms in local society. The advent of an increasingly autocratic monarch from the Sung era on nurtured a sharp opposition between center and locality that had not been visible in the Six Dynasties period.</p>
<p>Although this opposition often remained latent, it continued to grow and became even deeper under the alien Ch‘ing regime. One of its manifestations is the variety of ways in which the local elite expressed themselves on issues of concern to local society. This is Ōtani Toshio’s 大谷敏夫 (Kagoshima University) theme in his excellent essay, “Shindai kyōshin no rinen to gen-jitsu: Hōtō, hōken, seidenron o chūshin to shite” 清代郷紳の理念と現実: 朋党·封建·井田論を中心として [“Ideal and Reality in the Ch‘ing Local</p>
<p>Gentry: Concerning the Debates over Cliques, Feudalism, and the Well-field System”]. It should be noted that Ōtani has authored a number of important articles which examine the confluence of political and intellectual issues in Ch‘ing history.20</p>

<p>613</p>
<p>Ōtani argues that the statecraft debate which began in the Ming and continued into the Ch‘ing dynasty concentrated on three issues: p’eng-tang 朋党 or cliques and parties feng-chien  封建 or “feudalism” (i.e., decentralized political power); and ching-t‘ien  井田 or the classical (perhaps mythical) well-field system of land tenure. The debates, carried on by local gentry ( hsiang-shen 郷紳) in their capacity as a locally resident elite, arose over problems between the center and the locality concerning political, economic, and cultural leadership (or control). For example, the feng-chien debate centered on autonomous rule for local cities under imperial control; the debate over cliques and parties was concerned with the propriety of alliance between the sovereign and the shih-ta-fu; and the well-field debate aimed at returning “official lands” ( kuan-t‘ien 官田) and garrison lands (t‘un-t‘ien 屯田) to impoverished officials.</p>
<p>The displeasure of the Yung-cheng 雍正 Emperor forced these debates to subside for a time, and in fact a number of figures were impeached.</p>
<p>Administrative decadence during the reign of the Ch‘ien-lung 乾隆 Emperor led, however, to the reemergence of statecraft thought primarily in Kiangnan cities, and this trend unfolded further in the Chia-ch‘ing 嘉慶 and Tao-kuang 道光 years. Particularly in opposition to Ch‘ing rule, Ōtani argues, did local society under the leadership of the statecraft shin-ta-fu class come to speak on its own behalf. He cites the works of Wei Yüan 魏源, Kung Tzu-chen 龔自珍, Feng Kuei-fen 馮桂芬, and others. One further example was the hsiang-tung 郷董 system21 whereby responsibility for local administration in matters relating to water control was placed in the hands of the local gentry, who functioned in a sort of official-managerial capacity from mid to late Ch‘ing. Both Ōtani and Mori note that the economic development of local society at this time took the form of markets centering on the county unit. The economic as well as political maturation of local society, with a local elite supporting local interests, led to the demand for fundamental political reform.</p>
<p>Ōtani carries his analysis through the yang-wu 洋務 (early Westernization) era and examines the influence of the Western impact on statecraft thought.</p>

<p>Inoue Hiromasa 井上裕正 (Shimane University) deals with the relationship between the shih-ta-fu class and local society in the midst of this process. In his essay “Go Ranshū to Kanton shakai, toku ni Kakeimatsu-Dōkō shoki ni oite”</p>
<p>呉蘭修と力ントン社会: 特に嘉慶末道光初期において [“Wu Lan-hsiu</p>
<p>and Canton Society in the Late Chia-ch‘ing and Early Tao-kuang Periods”], he examines the nature of the relationship forged between Wu Lan-hsiu and other intellectuals on the basis of the “first opium debate” in the late Chia-ch‘ing years.22 Wu organized a group of chu-jen 擧人 and sheng-yüan 生員</p>
<p>into the Hsi-ku-t‘ang 希古堂, a literary society closely linked to Juan Yūan’s 阮元 Hsüeh-hai-t‘ang 學海堂. Following Wu’s activities closely, Inoue demonstrates his role as an intermediary in the “debate” over legalizing opium that took place indirectly between Pao Shih-ch‘en 包世臣 and Ch‘eng Han-chang 程含章. Furthermore, Wu’s essay “Mi-hai p‘ien” 弭害篇 (On repressing the injurious) later became the basis for Hsü Nai-chi’s 許乃濟 famous memorial to rescind the ban on opium.</p>
<p>Although the Opium War has long been seen as the beginning of modern Chinese history by Chinese, Japanese, and Western scholars—Marxist and non-Marxist alike—Inoue sees it rather as the culmination of a longer historical process beginning earlier and continuing afterward. At the root of this historical process was the integrated realm of local society and the shih-ta-fu class. Inoue’s case study apparently confirms Mori’s hypothesis that this unified structure continued to support Chinese society into the late Ch‘ing.</p>

<p>A major element unifying these studies of shih-ta-fu life over a two thousand year period is the link between the generic moral-intellectual character of the shih-ta-fu and control of the local populace. This collection of essays represents the first effort in any language to study this relationship over time in a scholarly way. By focusing on local society—the world in which people actually led their lives—these studies try to locate the role of this moral-intellectual realm in everyday life. This aspect of the local elite’s existence has often been noted in the past, but it is usually relegated to at best a secondary importance, as intellectual and moral concerns often are. Here, all the authors, and Tanigawa most vociferously, argue it is not a facade but a real facet of class control in imperial China.</p>
<p>These essays also demonstrate that the structure of control was not a static phenomenon, and they show the changes over time, particularly before and after the great T‘ang-Sung divide, in the mechanisms for local rule. One of the more significant accomplishments of this volume has been to establish more clearly many of the connections between the examination system and local society from the Sung era onward. Of course, research into one local area does not necessary apply in its findings to any other locality, and can only be refined through comparative research elsewhere.</p>
<p>The final essay in this volume, by Uemura Yasuo 植村泰夫 (Kyoto University), examines similar issues of local society and control for a region of Indonesia: “Nijū seiki sho Shidoarujo no desa kyōyaku ni okeru desa shuchō</p>
<p>no chii o meguru oboegaki” 20世紀初シドアルジョの デサ協約におけ</p>
<p>るデサ首長の地位をめぐる覚書 [“Notes on the Position of the Village</p>
<p>( desa) Head in the Village Covenants of Sidoardjo County in the Early 20th Century”]. Its inclusion in this volume is somewhat confusing; at best it suggests approaches for future research.</p>
<p>At long last we in the West have some common ground for dialogue in the study of Chinese history. The study of local history and local elites has been a passion of Western scholars over the past decade or more, primarily for scholars of the later imperial period. Now we have a systematic attempt by Japanese scholars to examine the same phenomena, with the added advantage of a preponderance of studies on the pre-T‘ang period in which the Japanese have traditionally excelled.</p>
<p>This focus on the structure of local power in China is not an entirely new direction in Japanese scholarship. Tanigawa and Kawakatsu have been working for some time on the nature of local society and the centrality of what they call the “community” ( kyōdōtai 共同体) to Chinese social structure in the period from Han through early T‘ang. Actually the root of this investigation goes back to Naitō Konan 内藤湖南 (1866–1934), Japan’s foremost scholar of Chinese</p>
<p>616</p>
<p>A New Direction in Japanese Sinology</p>
<p>history in the prewar years. Naitō identified in local society the highest level of any meaning for understanding the mechanics of how China operated. He also clearly downplayed the importance of the central government, particularly after the T‘ang, as irrelevant to an understanding of daily life in China.</p>
<p>In the immediate post-war years, prewar scholarship became the object of a mass cathartic denunciation as the sinological world exorcised from its midst any trace of scholarship that might have, consciously or unconsciously, contributed to Japanese imperialism on the Asian mainland. Naitō and his writings were generally vilified as a cosmetic cover for avowedly aggressive aims; and there can be little doubt that Naitō believed in certain avenues of Japanese expansion and that his scholarship may have supported his political views.23</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Naitō’s scholarship was shunned together with his politics, and so his important scholarly insights were ignored by all but a few for some time. There seems no longer to be any embarrassment associated with citing Naitō’s writings—he has even been given a rather high assessment in China recently.24 While it may be premature to announce the dawn of a “new age,”</p>
<p>since Marxism in a variety of guises continues to occupy an important place in Japanese sinology, it is interesting to note that as “the postwar has ended” (to use the Japanese expression) the truly significant scholarly contributions of the prewar years loom ever larger.</p>
