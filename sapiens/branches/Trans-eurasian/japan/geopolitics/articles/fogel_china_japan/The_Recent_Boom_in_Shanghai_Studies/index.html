  <meta property="og:description" content="The past two decades have witnessed a surge of scholarly interest within the field of China studies in Shanghai’s modern history and culture. As if in replication of China’s exploding economy, this attraction to China’s largest city has by no means been limited to the Anglophone world (most non-native Anglophone westerners who work on China now publish much of their scholarship in English), but has been equally matched if not surpassed in quantity by work in Chinese and Japanese. After examining why Shanghai has become so popular to researchers, I will look at the kinds of work that have been done on the city’s history, examine a few recent works of cultural and intellectual history more closely, and suggest a number of avenues for future scholarship.">

  <p>The past two decades have witnessed a surge of scholarly interest within the field of China studies in Shanghai’s modern history and culture. As if in replication of China’s exploding economy, this attraction to China’s largest city has by no means been limited to the Anglophone world (most non-native Anglophone westerners who work on China now publish much of their scholarship in English), but has been equally matched if not surpassed in quantity by work in Chinese and Japanese. After examining why Shanghai has become so popular to researchers, I will look at the kinds of work that have been done on the city’s history, examine a few recent works of cultural and intellectual history more closely, and suggest a number of avenues for future scholarship.</p>
<p>One of the reasons for the attraction to Shanghai history in the West is that Shanghai was arguably the most Western of all Chinese cities before the Communist victory in 1949. Although Harbin with its largely Russophone community of foreigners in China’s far northeast may lay claim to that dubious distinction in the prewar decades, given Shanghai’s much greater size, it has received the lion’s share of attention.1 Many of Harbin’s Russian expatriates ultimately migrated to Shanghai after the Japanese occupation of Manchuria from the early 1930s.2 In the 1920s and 1930s, however, westerners and East Asians alike referred to both cities as the “Paris of the Orient,” apparently on the assumption that Paris was a glamorous, international city. All Western trends, whether in fashion, film, music, radio, or other forms of popular culture, found resonances in Shanghai before they were felt elsewhere in China or often elsewhere in East Asia. At the same time, Shanghai was home to a relatively large Western émigré community from the middle of the nineteenth 1  A few recent books in English on Harbin deserve mention: Søren Clausen and Stig Thøgersen, <em>The Making of a Chinese City: History and Historiography in Harbin</em> (Armonk, N.Y.: M.E.</p>
<p>Sharpe, 1995); James H. Carter, <em>Creating a Chinese Harbin: Nationalism in an International</em> <em>City, 1916–1932</em> (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2002); David Wolff, <em>To the Harbin Station:</em> *The Liberal Alternative in Russian Manchuria, 1898–1914 *(Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1999).</p>
<p>2  Marcia R. Ristaino, <em>Port of Last Resort: The Diaspora Communities of Shanghai</em> (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001); despite its subtitle, this book primarily concerns the Russians in the city. See also E.E. Aurilene, <em>Rossiiskaia diaspora v Kitae</em> (Khabarovsk: Chastnaia kollekt-siia, 2008).</p>

<p>century. Multinational and multi-religious in composition, this community largely lived unto itself in the Concessions, those areas which by unequal treaty regulations fell under foreign jurisdiction, known as extraterritoriality.</p>
<p>One might expect to find a hybrid culture in Shanghai, a kind of Sino-Western amalgam, but nothing of this sort ever really emerged, perhaps because this was never a full-fledged colonial setting. The “modern” culture that did emerge before the onslaught of World War II and the coming of the Communists soon thereafter was either entirely Western or a Chinese imitation of Western fashions, films, art, and the like.</p>
<p>While there is now a fascination with Shanghai culture in Western, Chinese, and Japanese scholarship, westerners in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries rarely evinced more than a passing interest in the surrounding multitudes of Chinese and only rarely learned their language. Business with westerners was almost always conducted in English or through compradors.</p>
<p>The major exception among the foreign community were the Japanese, especially members of their larger enterprises, who most often sought to do business directly with the Chinese, necessitating the acquisition of one or more topolects of Chinese. Indeed, the major Japanese conglomerates initially sent representatives to China for long periods of study and language training to break into local markets, especially networks of trade that the Chinese had long dominated throughout the region.3</p>
<p>Although home primarily to foreigners, the Concessions also played a central role in the unfolding of modern Chinese history. Perhaps most significantly, the French Concession of Shanghai (beyond the reach of the Chinese police) played quiet, unknowing host to the founding of the Chinese Communist Party in July 1921. Not surprisingly, while this topic was much more popular among Western (and East Asian) academics in the 1960s and 1970s than it is today, that may be changing once again.4 The tiny schoolroom where that initial meeting 3  Motomiya Kazuo, “Sōgō shōsha no keisei” (“The Formation of [Economic] Conglomerates”), in <em>Kindai Nihon no kiseki</em>, * * 8: <em>Sangyō kakumei (The Tracks of Modern Japan</em>, vol. 8: <em>The Industrial</em> <em>Revolution)</em>, * * ed. Takamura Naosuke (Tokyo: Yoshikawa kōbunkan, 1994), 168–74.</p>
<p>4  Recent work indicating more interest in this field would include: Patricia Stranahan, *Underground: The Shanghai Communist Party and the Politics of Survival, 1927–1937 *(Lanham, Md.: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1998); S.A.

<p>The mix of leftists living in or traveling through Shanghai has been another impetus to scholarship on this city. All manner of international conspiracies were hatched in Shanghai. It was here that the famed spymaster Richard Sorge (1895–1944) met with Ozaki Hotsumi (1901–44), Agnes Smedley (1892–1950), and others whom he brought into his extraordinary ring in the late 1930s and early 1940s.5 It was here that China’s most famous modern writer of fiction, Lu Xun (1881–1936), hid out from the police in the upper storey of the bookstore owned by Uchiyama Kanzō (1885–1959), a longtime Japanese resident of Shanghai and close personal friend to Lu Xun and numerous other Chinese writers.6</p>
<p>Another reason for the considerable attention paid to Shanghai history of late is the growing recognition that, in the waning months before the beginning of total war in Europe, it was the one open port in which Jews escaping from Central Europe could find a haven from Nazi terror. Roughly 20,000 of them, mostly from Germany and Austria with smaller numbers coming from Poland and Lithuania, made their way through a variety of routes, usually via Japan, to occupied Shanghai, where they lived out the war. Later, many of the Jews who had similarly fled to Harbin migrated south to Shanghai.</p>

<p>This particular chapter in world history has helped bring proper acclaim to Sugihara Chiune (1900–86), the Japanese consul in wartime Kovno (Kaunas), who wrote semi-legitimate transit visas through Japan to Shanghai for thousands of Jewish refugees, a humanitarian move that cost him his diplomatic career, but has gained him considerable posthumous acclaim.7</p>
<p>In the early 1990s, the Center for Chinese Studies at the University of California, Berkeley began a well-funded Luce project in which a number of senior scholars and graduate students worked in conjunction with their counterparts at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences. A similar project at Cornell University also funded by the Luce Foundation was carried out at about the same time. The main figures at Berkeley were the late Frederic Wakeman, Jr., Yeh Wen-hsin, and Elizabeth Perry, and at Cornell, Sherman Cochran; their work will be discussed below. Though not directly related to either of these projects, Leo Ou-fan Lee, then at the University of California, Los Angeles, was pursuing his own research on modern Shanghai culture, ultimately producing *Shanghai Modern: The Flowering of a New Urban Culture in China, 1930–1945. * As at Berkeley and Cornell, a number of Lee’s students went on to produce theses and books principally in the cultural history of the city.8 Two other centers, both in Europe, also began generating works on Shanghai, in part in interaction with Berkeley, Cornell, and UCLA and in part independently. One was at the University of Lyon under prolific historian Christian Henriot, and the other was at the University of Heidelberg under Rudolf Wagner. Henriot has 7  Irene Eber, “Overland and by Sea: Eight Centuries of the Jewish Presence in China,” <em>Chinese</em> <em>Journal of International Law</em> 4.1 (2005): 235–56; Hillel Levine, <em>In Search of Sugihara: The</em> <em>Elusive Japanese Diplomat Who Risked His Life to Rescue 10,000 Jews from the Holocaust</em> (New York: Free Press, 1996); David Kranzler, <em>Japanese, Nazis &amp; Jews: The Jewish Refugee Community</em> <em>of Shanghai, 1938–1945</em> (Hoboken: KTAV Publishing House, 1988).

<p>been single-mindedly focused in his research on Shanghai for several decades, while Wagner’s wide-ranging interests focused for a number of years on the emergence of the public sphere, especially via the press, in nineteenth-century Shanghai. The seminar he ran on the latter theme—conducted in English—</p>
<p>has since produced several important books on early Chinese newspapers from Shanghai and their publishers.9</p>
<p>If Western imperialism was partly responsible for the transformation of Shanghai into its present size and shape, however, we now know as well that the widespread perception that Shanghai was a sleepy fishing village before the arrival of Western merchants, missionaries, and gunboats in the aftermath of the Opium War (1839–42) is simply a myth. While the origins of this myth are unknown, it may have been generated by self-serving Western interests in the city. As Linda Johnson demonstrated in <em>Shanghai: From Market Town</em> <em>to Treaty Port, 1074–1858</em>, * * Shanghai has a history almost a millennium long. By 1760 it had become the most important domestic port of trade of the entire Qing empire and the main hub for regional trade. By the 1830s, before the Opium War and the residence of westerners in the city, the volume of shipping through Shanghai was on a par with that of London.10</p>
<p>This point is made equally strongly by Meng Yue of the University of Toronto and Qinghua University (Beijing) in her recent, highly thoughtful book, *Shanghai and the Edges of Empire. * At least as important as the arrival of the West to the rise of Shanghai as a Chinese city was the Christian-inspired Taiping Rebellion (1851–64), which devastated vast areas throughout south China, killing millions.11 The Christian rebels, intent as they were in destroying what they deemed idol-worshipping traditional Confucian civilization, attacked the major centers of Chinese culture in the lower Yangzi region—</p>
<p>Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Yangzhou, among others. Chinese figures of cultural prominence who were able to escape with their lives (to say nothing of the countless thousands of ordinary folk) frequently made their way to Shanghai.</p>
<p>The presence of a zone into which they presumed the rebels would fear to tread—the foreign Concessions—made the city all the more attractive. And, it meant that not only did Shanghai’s population soar, but its standing as a 9  Barbara Mittler, <em>A Newspaper for China?

<p>The Recent Boom in Shanghai Studies</p>
<p>center of cultural production rapidly outstripped the rest of the country. Thus, Shanghai was ironically the cultural and intellectual beneficiary of the rest of the lower Yangzi’s catastrophe.</p>
<p>Thus, Shanghai owes its prominence neither solely to westerners nor to domestic rebels alone. The native culture it would produce in the aftermath of the Taiping Rebellion was a rich amalgam of regional Chinese cultures, increasingly over time with influence from westerners and Japanese. Mainland Chinese scholars and many non-Chinese following them have depicted Shanghai as “semi-colonial,” a distinctly unproductive designation. While westerners in the city did enjoy extraterritoriality, they had little authority outside the Concessions, and the Chinese population of Shanghai was always many times larger than all the foreign communities combined. In addition, numerous Chinese owned property and lived in the Concessions, making this whole topic much more satisfyingly complex than any easy appellation might afford.</p>
<p>Meng convincingly demonstrates that focusing solely on the Western component of the city as a reason for its rise is myopic and needs to be integrated into a broader understanding of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century history.</p>
<p>She deals with a number of topics in Shanghai history, though I shall limit myself here to just one, what she dubs “semiotic modernity.” From the last years of the nineteenth century, hundreds of Western works were translated into Chinese, most of them retranslations from the Japanese. In rendering these works into their own language roughly a generation earlier, the Japanese coined hundreds of new words (using Chinese characters) to represent the many foreign terms from Western sciences, social sciences, and humanities. The great majority of these neologisms were rapidly and so seamlessly integrated into Chinese that virtually no native speaker can now detect which terms are native and which of Japanese coinage.12 The linguistic story is all background, as Meng proceeds to a discussion of the Commercial Press of Shanghai, which was responsible for bringing out many of these volumes of translation and for inaugurating the 12  The Italian linguist, Federico Masini, demonstrated that the Chinese, together with missionaries in the first half of the nineteenth century had, in fact, coined many such terms, which Chinese scholars largely ignored. Unlike the crisis of the late nineteenth century, the need for the “new learning” (as Western knowledge became known) was not then recognized. When thousands of Chinese students traveled to Japan to study—just as tens of thousands now are studying in Japan, the United States, and elsewhere—they were introduced to the Japanese neologisms, many of which, it should be added, were borrowed from the earlier Chinese-missionary coinages. See Masini, <em>The Formation of</em> <em>Modern Chinese Lexicon and Its Evolution Toward a National Language: The Period from</em> <em>1840 to 1898</em>, * * monograph series #6, * Journal of Chinese Linguistics* (Berkeley: University of California, 1993).</p>
<p>The Recent Boom In Shanghai Studies</p>
<p>87</p>
<p>practice of <em>bianyi</em> (literally, compiling and translating). Rather than explaining the term and then using the Romanized Chinese, Meng opts for the infelicitous coinage “transcompilation” to convey the two halves of the Chinese term <em>bianyi</em> <em>(bian</em> “compile”; <em>yi</em> “translate”), a choice that obfuscates rather than clarifies.</p>
<p>The contribution of the Commercial Press to Shanghai (and Chinese) culture is happily recounted here, if Meng’s brilliant analysis is occasionally confused by excessively “theoretical” prose. Regrettably, the University of Minnesota Press did not edit this book carefully.</p>
<p>While Western residents in Shanghai may have been largely—though by no means totally—ignorant of Chinese culture, such has not been the case in recent scholarship. Nineteenth- and prewar twentieth-century Shanghai cultural history has been among the most productive areas, including literary, film, art, and intellectual history. In recent studies of Shanghai history in this domain, however, there has been a tendency (unconscious, to be sure, and a trend not limited to East Asian history) to use “theory” to replace thought. One wonders what invoking everyone from Walter Benjamin (1895–1943) to Janet Abu-Lughod to Régis Debray can possibly offer the scholar of Shanghai history and culture. One thing these theorists do have in common—and this would include many more than just the three named here—is a total ignorance of anything having to do with the history, culture, and language of Shanghai in particular and China in general.</p>
<p>In 2007 Alexander Des Forges (University of Massachusetts, Boston) published a fine book entitled <em>Mediasphere Shanghai: The Aesthetics of Cultural</em> *Production. * 13 What does it add to Des Forges’s excellent work, I had to ask myself, when he invokes the vaguest of similarities with Benjamin’s “Arcades Project,” other than joining the chorus of those who have adopted Benjamin as the prophet of the age? This reader, at least, found it painfully tiresome.</p>
<p>Even if Benjamin’s confusing interests coincidentally accorded with those of early twentieth-century Chinese writers, what possible meaning could that have, other than pure coincidence? True, both were concerned with the advent of “modernity,” however one might choose to define that uniformly fungible term, but comparisons need to be justified both internally and externally. This is similar to people who posit linguistic influence between two words from entirely different language groups based solely on sound, what linguist call <em>klang</em> association, without any genetic linkage. That is not, I would argue, how language or culture or history works. Elsewhere, Des Forges invokes Benjamin’s ubiquitous essay, “The Task of the Translator.” I, too, like many who work in the trenches of translation—that is, who actually translate rather than 13  (Honolulu: University of Hawai‘i Press, 2007).</p>
<p>88</p>
<p>The Recent Boom in Shanghai Studies</p>
<p>simply write about it—have read that essay numerous times, though I still have only a faint idea about what Benjamin was trying to say. Maybe Des Forges actually does understand this piece, although Benjamin’s best friend, Gershom Scholem (1897–1982), has written of this essay that it “contained all the ingredi-ents that gained for his writings the reputation of incomprehensibility.”14</p>
<p>Although his book would have been just as good without reference to the term “mediasphere,” a concept taken from Régis Debray (b. 1940),15 Des Forges has produced a fascinating addition to the field of Shanghai studies. He argues that it was serialized fiction in the new newspapers and periodicals that made Shanghai into the unique cultural space that it was at the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centuries. Even more intriguing, he notes that the long novels carried in installments were largely written in “Wu dialect”</p>
<p>(“lect” would have been a better choice of term)16 of the Shanghai region, and his text is full of marvelous instances substantiating this point.</p>
<p>Another work in cultural history that deserves to be on everybody’s Shanghai reading list but appears in the bibliography of none of the English-language books published to date is Liu Jianhui’s *Mato Shanhai: Nihon chishikijin no *</p>
<p><em>“kindai” taiken (Demon Capital Shanghai: The “Modern” Experience of Japanese</em> *Intellectuals). * 17 * * Liu (International Research Center for Japanese Studies) jux-taposes the two spheres of Shanghai: the walled Chinese city and the foreign Concessions, the former symbolizing everything backward and premodern about China and the latter the modern world. He looks at the experiences of numerous Japanese who came to Shanghai or stopped over in the city en route to the West from the 1860s through World War II. As his title indicates, it was there that these men and women, particularly in the nineteenth century, first experienced the modern world—whether that meant their first piano bar, cup 14 </p>

<p>16  Calling both Chinese “language” and Shanghai “dialect” lects enables us to avoid the unproductive language vs. dialect debate. Half a century ago, Max Weinreich summed it up beautifully with the aphorism: “a shprakh iz a dialekt mit an armey un flot” (“a language is a dialect with an army and a navy”).

<p>of coffee, Greta Garbo movie, or mattress-and-box-springs bed. The hustle-bustle of the city was unlike anything they had ever experienced before, but it was also a wake-up call, for the root of all the activity in the city was the Western presence. Only the Western half of the city was worthy of emulation; the Chinese city was pitiable at best.</p>
<p>Liu also looks at the transmission of Western scientific knowledge to China via the translation efforts of missionaries, especially the London Missionary Society which, in addition to distributing a quarter million Bibles in Chinese, published 171 religious and scientific texts in Chinese. The first and most important figure in this effort was the missionary William Muirhead (1822–1900) who actually met several of the first Japanese to visit the city. Of course, none of this activity could have occurred without considerable Chinese help, although the names and careers of the missionaries’ Chinese collaborators are considerably less well known. Whatever impact the Christian texts may have had notwithstanding, the scientific works and the Western news summaries distributed by missionary presses were of great importance. For example, when the theory of a spherical Earth was introduced as a proven scientific fact, it was no longer possible to posit any country at the center of the world. Any Chinese who accepted this thesis would perforce find his native land decentered, one country among many in a world of nation-states. There is much more in Liu’s book worthy of consideration, especially the place of Shanghai in the writings of Japanese novelists in the twentieth century. Perhaps the Chinese translation of 2003 will enable other Sinologists interested in Shanghai’s place in the transnational flow of ideas to take advantage of this marvelous book.18</p>
<p>Another extremely popular Shanghai topic is the world of the nascent cinema there. Several scholars—some more schooled in “cinema studies,” some more in modern Chinese history, but rarely in both—have written recent books on the topic.19 While the Western element in the production of Chinese films 18  The Chinese series in which Liu’s book appears—“Shanghai shi yanjiu yicong” (Collection of works on Shanghai history in translation)—features eleven titles either out or imminent, including two of Wakeman’s three books <em>(Shanghai Badlands</em> and <em>Policing Shanghai)</em>, Bryna Goodman’s <em>Native Place, City, and Nation: Regional Networks and Identities in</em> <em>Shanghai, 1853–1937</em> (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1995); Henriot, <em>Prostitution</em> <em>and Sexuality in Shanghai: A Social History (1849–1949)</em> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001); Kohama Masako, <em>Kindai Shanhai no kōkyōsei to kokka (The “Public” and the</em> <em>State in Modern Shanghai)</em> (Tokyo: Kenbun shuppan, 2000); and Lu Hanchao’s <em>Beyond</em> <em>the Neon Lights: Everyday Shanghai in the Early Twentieth Century</em> (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1999).</p>

<p>The Recent Boom in Shanghai Studies</p>
<p>in Shanghai in its early years is well handled in these works, there is scarcely a mention—let alone a detailed examination—of the importance of Japanese influence, sponsorship, direction, and production of films in Shanghai, such as the company operated by Kawakita Nagamasa (1903–81).20</p>
<p>One cultural topic deserving more attention, mentioned occasionally but only studied of late in one book, is the modern architecture of Shanghai, namely the Western-style buildings built post-Opium War, many of which survived the Japanese invasion and occupation. Muramatsu Shin’s extraordinary text marks an excellent beginning, with its maps, charts, and detailed graphics.21 It begins with a chapter entitled “Shanghae 1852” (reflecting British spelling of the city at that time, itself a reflection of the Shanghainese lect before imposition of a national standard). As he tells the stories of successive waves of architectural booms in the city, Muramatsu includes countless old photographs and a treasure trove of citations. Anyone seriously interested in old photographs of the city of Shanghai, though, should consult the incomparable website, http://</p>
<p>virtualshanghai.ish-lyon.cnrs.fr/, created and maintained by Christian Henriot.</p>
<p>Another topic in the cultural history of the city that has elicited considerable interest among scholars is Shanghai’s central place in the history of the modern or quasi-modern Chinese press and the role of the Concessions in its development. Some of the best works in this sub-field have emerged out of Rudolf Wagner’s ongoing seminar at the University of Heidelberg. Thus far, arguably the most important product of that seminar is a monograph by Barbara Mittler (herself at Heidelberg), <em>A Newspaper for China? Power, Identity, and Change in</em> <em>Shanghai’s News Media, 1872–1912</em>, a * * study of what is generally considered the earliest Shanghai newspaper (dating to 1872), *Shenbao. * Founded, interestingly enough, by a British merchant, Ernest Major (1841–1908), the subject of ongoing research by Wagner himself, <em>Shenbao</em> became the most successful Shanghai paper of its day—until 1949 when the Communists came to power—despite the fact that until 1904 it was written in literary Chinese without punctuation, <em>Culture in Shanghai, 1922–1943</em> (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1999); Poshek Fu, <em>Between Shanghai and Hong Kong: The Politics of Chinese Cinemas</em> (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2003).</p>
<p>20  See, for example, Shimizu Akira, <em>Shanhai sokai eiga watakushi shi (A Personal History of</em> *Films in the Shanghai Concessions) *(Tokyo: Shinchōsha, 1995). Poshek Fu looks at this phenomenon in a relatively short essay: “Projecting Ambivalence: Chinese Cinema in Semi-Occupied Shanghai, 1937–1941,” in <em>Wartime Shanghai</em>, * * 86–109.</p>

A slightly older book on a much more modest scale with similar concerns is Fujiwara Keiyō, <em>Shanhai, shissō suru</em> *kindai toshi (Shanghai, Modern City at Full Speed) *(Tokyo: Kōdansha, 1988).</p>

<p>insuring an elite readership only. Chinese businessmen took over ownership of the paper upon Major’s death. Mittler spends a great deal of time trying to assess the impact that this newspaper had—an extremely difficult topic—and comes away somewhat skeptical of much in this regard.22</p>
<p>An earlier study dealing with a slightly later Shanghai newspaper, <em>Shibao</em>, is Joan Judge’s <em>Print and Politics: “Shibao” and the Culture of Reform in Late Qing</em> *China. * 23 * * Founded in 1904 during a surreptitious visit to Shanghai from Japan by the exiled reformer and polymath Liang Qichao (1873–1929), then with a price still on his head, <em>Shibao</em> was aimed at creating a middle-level readership, between government officials and a largely illiterate common folk. In response and fearful of losing readership, <em>Shenbao</em> made similar compromises at that time. Judge effectively demonstrates that this paper with its constitutional reformist objectives played a major role in the late Qing government’s efforts to reform itself before ultimately being undone by the 1911 Revolution.</p>
<p>Ernest Major inaugurated another important serial in Shanghai, <em>Dianshizhai</em> *huabao (Dian-shizhai Illustrated). * During its fourteen years of publication from 1884 until 1898, it produced 4,509 illustrations with explanatory commentary.</p>
<p>Many of these beautifully drawn and lithographically produced illustrations were sensationalist in the extreme, highlighting both the scientifically novel (air balloons) and the scientifically impossible (half-human, half-beast creatures). There have been a number of introductions to <em>Dianshizhai huabao,</em> but Ye Xiaoqing’s (Macquarie University) <em>The</em> Dianshizhai Pictorial: <em>Shanghai</em> <em>Urban Life, 1884–1898</em> is the first full-length study.24 As Ye demonstrates, it was an important news outlet, not just for international news but for domestic news outside Shanghai as well. It also exposed and lampooned political hypoc-risy. Perhaps Ye’s greatest service is the inclusion of numerous reproductions from the serial and her fluid translations of the difficult, appended prose.</p>

<p>92</p>
<p>The Recent Boom in Shanghai Studies</p>
<p>One issue that has recently been brought to light by an especially brilliant young Chinese scholar, Lai Yü-chih (National Palace Museum, Taipei), is the origin of all of the illustrations in <em>Dianshizhai huabao</em>, a topic scarcely mentioned in work that preceded her groundbreaking essay.25 She shows clearly through comparative and textual analysis—which will please both historians and art historians—that the art work in <em>Dianshizhai huabao</em> came from pro-totypes in earlier Japanese woodblock prints. Lai’s work may need more time to filter down in the Shanghai studies field, but as it gains greater currency, the Sino-Japanese connections in the sub-field as a whole should attract greater attention.</p>
<p>The entire topic of Japanese influence in Shanghai has been left largely untouched in the English-language literature to date. This topic would fall into at least two subfields: the years of the Japanese military occupation of the city (1937–45) and Chinese collaboration; and the Japanese community of Shanghai and its ties both to the other foreigners in the city and to the Chinese there (1860s–1945). The former has received somewhat more attention than the latter. Poshek Fu’s <em>Passivity, Resistance, and Collaboration: Intellectual Choices</em> <em>in Occupied Shanghai, 1937–1945</em> was a pioneering examination of “collaboration,” needless to say an extremely sensitive topic to this day. Fu attempted to address the ways in which Chinese living under Japanese occupational authorities articulated their interests, or remained significantly silent, within the obvious constraints of the time.26 More recently, a similar topic was under-taken in <em>In the Shadow of the Rising Sun: Shanghai under Japanese Occupation</em>, a collection of essays edited by Henriot and Yeh.27 What neither of these studies conveys, however, nor was it the aim of the authors to do so, is much about the occupiers themselves. An additional contributing force to this lacuna is the poor training in Japanese language of most Western Sinologists. It also oddly reflects a Chinese piety that Chinese history is somehow *sui generis. *</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the latter topic, the history of the Japanese expatriate community of Shanghai, has been pioneered and developed by Japanese scholars 25  Lai Yü-chih, “Fuliu qianjie: 1870 niandai Shanghai de Riben gangluo yu Ren Bonian zuo-pin zhong de Riben yangfen” (“Surreptitious Appropriation: Japanese Contacts in 1879s Shanghai and the Japanese Nutrients in the Works of Ren Bonian”), ** ** <em>Meishu shi yanjiu</em> <em>jikan</em> 14 (March 2003): 159–242.</p>

<p>of China. The Japanese have written a tremendous amount about Shanghai, site of the first expatriate Japanese community anywhere in the modern world.</p>
<p>The first and, in many ways, still the most important contributor to research on ties between Japanese nationals and Shanghai was Okita Hajime (1905–85).</p>
<p>Coming to Shanghai as an English teacher shortly after the occupation of the city began, Okita discovered that his fellow Japanese evinced little interest in the history of their own community and had done next to nothing to preserve the material record. He thus made Herculean efforts to document the distinctive history of the Japanese in the city, poring over old newspapers and journals in various languages, and wrote a handful of books on the subject.28 After repatriation to Japan at the close of World War II, however, he soon ceased research on this topic. Those of us who have followed in his wake owe him a great debt of thanks.29</p>
<p>A general history of modern Shanghai in Japanese, richly illustrated and documented, is <em>Shanhai shi, kyodai toshi no keisei to hitobito no itonami (A</em> <em>History of Shanghai, the Formation of a Giant City and the Businesses of Its</em> <em>People)</em>, * * edited by Takahashi Kōsuke and Furumaya Tadao.30 The work of nine men and women, this volume looks at the formation of the modern city, its Chinese, Western, and Japanese components, and brings the story from the 28  Okita Hajime, <em>Kojō shi dan: Shanhai ni kansuru shiteki zuihitsu (Tales from the History of</em> *Shanghai: Historical Notes about Shanghai) *(Shanghai: Tairiku shinpōsha, 1942); <em>Nihon to</em> *Shanhai (Japan and Shanghai) *(Shanghai: Tairiku shinpōsha, 1943); <em>Shanhai ni kansuru</em> *bunken mokuroku (Bibliography of Materials on Shanghai) *(Shanghai: Akita Masao, 1944);</p>

<p>29  The centerpiece of Shanghai historical and cultural studies in Japan and particularly studies of the city’s Japanese community is the Research Group on Shanghai History which meets monthly in Tokyo. As their website (http://www.ricoh.co.jp/net-messena/</p>
<p>ACADEMIA/SHANGHAI/) makes clear, they periodically sponsor conferences, have ongoing joint research projects (often together with scholars from the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences), and maintain an invaluable bibliography of works on Shanghai. One of their first and most impressive projects was <em>Shanhai, jūsō suru nettowakku (Shanghai,</em> *a Stratified Network) * of 2000. This 550-page book contains eighteen essays (by Japanese, Chinese, and one Korean), with summaries of the essays in Chinese and English. It covers such topics as Shanghai entrepreneurs and the image of “public” spaces (such as parks), local reforms and the roles played by local gentry, local communal and public works projects, Buddhism and the Japanese Residents Association of Shanghai, and much more.</p>

<p>mid-nineteenth century through the war years and up to the Communist take-over in 1949 *. * 31</p>
<p>One scholar who has spent years studying the history of the Japanese of Shanghai is, interestingly, a Chinese at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, Chen Zuen. In an online series now numbering over ninety installments, entitled “Shanhai ni ita Nihonjin” (“The Japanese who were in Shanghai”), Chen wrote extensively about any and every aspect of that community before the end of World War II. Much of this series has now largely been transformed into book form as <em>Xunfang Dongyangren, jindai Shanghai</em> <em>de Riben juliumin (1868–1945) (Searching for the Japanese, Modern Shanghai’s</em> *Japanese Residents, 1868–1945). * 32 * * Many topics are covered in this fine book, though at the expense of covering none of them in great depth. He has also co-authored with Takatsuna Hirofumi, former head of the Japanese Research Group on Shanghai History, a volume of photographs from this same community: <em>Riben qiaomin zai Shanghai, 1870–1945 (Japanese Expatriates in Shanghai,</em> *1870–1945). * 33</p>
<p>There are a number of sub-fields in the realm of Shanghai studies that touch on the history of ideas. Two of the most impressive contributions (published the same year, 1997) dealt with the issue of prostitution. Working separately for many years, Christian Henriot and Gail Hershatter (University of California, Santa Cruz), produced wonderful and completely different perspectives on the subject, although Henriot’s did not have an immediate impact (outside France) until it was translated into English as <em>Prostitution and Sexuality in</em> <em>Shanghai</em> and published in 2001. While these works do not deal centrally with intellectual history, Hershatter’s book, <em>Dangerous Pleasures: Prostitution and</em> <em>Modernity in Twentieth-Century Shanghai</em>, did address the issue of the conceptual constructions of prostitution in Shanghai. On the topic of more traditional courtesanship in the last decades of the Qing empire, Catherine Yeh’s (Boston 31  A shorter volume with far more humble aims is Tsuji Kōgo, Nakano Kenji, Takeyoshi Jirō, and Uno Kazuo, <em>Shanhai shi, sekai ni hiraku shōkōgyō toshi (The City of Shanghai, a</em> *Commercial-industrial City Opening to the World) *(Tokyo: Kōbundō, 1992).</p>

<p>University) <em>Shanghai Love: Courtesans, Intellectuals, and Entertainment Culture,</em> <em>1850–1910</em> is a major contribution to this genre.34</p>
<p>Another topic related to elite intellectual history is covered in Yeh Wenhsin’s recent work from the Shanghai project at Berkeley: <em>Shanghai Splendor:</em> *Economic Sentiments and the Making of Modern China, 1843–1949 *(University of California Press, 2007). Yeh looks at the entire period from the immediate post-Opium War years through the coming to power of the Chinese Communists.</p>
<p>Her focus is on the rise of a middle class in the city, whom she dubs “petty urbanites” *(xiao shimin). * This was the class, she argues, responsible for the city’s economic modernization and the rise of urban culture in Chinese Shanghai. Chapter 6 examines the history of ideas as popularized in the periodical and popular press directed at this new class, and its treatment of the popular journal *Dushu shenghuo (Readers’ Life) * is especially deft. Beginning in 1934, this twice-weekly serial appeared in Shanghai for several years. Dressed in Aesopian language, it was (seen with 20–20 hindsight) a Marxist-oriented journal, with several writers already members of the Chinese Communist Party. In straightforward, idiomatic, and vernacular Chinese they addressed the common concerns of the urban reading public, but always provided solutions to everyday problems that led to radical transformation. Several members of the team that produced it were murdered for their political views. One of the most prolific, Ai Siqi (1910–66), would later escape to the Communist wartime lair of Yan’an in the mountains of the Northwest and teach Mao Zedong (1893–1976) about Marxism-Leninism.35</p>
<p>Many other areas of Shanghai history not directly related to the history of ideas have, of course, been studied in recent years. After a brief overview, let us move to topics for future research. Before his untimely death, Frederic Wakeman was the unofficial dean of Shanghai studies in the West. After many years working in Chinese social, intellectual, and political history, he launched the Shanghai project at Berkeley and went on to produce three of his own books on Shanghai topics (all translated into Chinese), several edited volumes, and numerous essays in little more than a decade. These works concerned the 34  Gail Hershatter, <em>Dangerous Pleasures</em>** *<em>(Berkeley: University of California Press, 1997); and Christian Henriot, <em>Prostitution and Sexuality in Shanghai. * See the excellent review of these two books by Angela Ki Che Leung, “Prostitution in Modern Shanghai: Two Recent Studies,” <em>Nan Nü: Men, Women and Gender in Early and Imperial China</em></em></em> **2.1 (2000), 180–87.</p>

<p>The Recent Boom in Shanghai Studies</p>
<p>creation and operation of the Shanghai police, the secret police and gangsters in the city, and similar undercurrents in first half of the twentieth century.36</p>
<p>Undeniably, the prewar history of gangsterism, gambling, and the urban demimonde of Shanghai have been major attractions of westerners to the city at least since Josef von Sternberg’s <em>Shanghai Express</em> graced the screens of movie houses worldwide in 1932. A pioneer in the serious study of Shanghai gangs and their nefarious connections with business and political interests in the city was Brian Martin, whose study of the Green Gang, a secret society and immense criminal enterprise with tentacles going in many directions, and its leader Du Yuesheng (1887–1951), was the first significant work of its kind.37</p>
<p>Two leaders of Shanghai political or political-economic history have been Parks Coble (University of Nebraska) and Marie-Claire Bergère (Institut National des Langues et Civilisations Orientales). Coble’s first book, <em>The</em> <em>Shanghai Capitalists and the Nationalist Government, 1927–1937</em>, * * had a major impact on our understanding of the Shanghai bourgeoisie during the period of Guomindang rule in the city and the relationship between political and commercial leaders in the city, complicating the simplistic idea in vogue before then that the Guomindang and the Shanghai capitalists had completely overlapping interests.38 Most recently, his <em>Chinese Capitalists in Japan’s New</em> <em>Order: The Occupied Lower Yangzi, 1937–1945</em> picks up the story of his earlier work and examines the years of Japanese occupation, following their landing and assault on Shanghai in the summer of 1937, and the collaboration of China’s bourgeoisie.39 Bergère’s <em>L’âge d’or de la bourgeoisie chinoise, 1911–</em></p>
<p><em>1937</em> addresses a similar topic but in a slightly earlier period. Her more popular <em>Histoire de Shanghai</em> aimed at a broader readership.40 One other book 36 </p>

<p>The Recent Boom In Shanghai Studies</p>
<p>97</p>
<p>deserving mention in this context, <em>Shanghai Sojourners</em>, edited by Wakeman and Yeh, brings together essays by many of the people who subsequently wrote full-length books on the topics and whose earlier essays can still be read with profit: Bergère, Cochran, Bryna Goodman (University of Oregon), Jeffrey Wasserstrom (University of California, Irvine), Hershatter, Emily Honig (University of California, Santa Cruz), Martin, and Perry, in addition to the two editors.41 And, for his part, Sherman Cochran produced several volumes as well, largely in the field of business history.42</p>
<p>None of these works in business or economic history are the equation-driven sort that occupy many a library shelf. They are full of fascinating history of people and social and political forces in China’s largest city. Other topics not directly tied to the history of ideas that have been plumbed in modern Shanghai historical studies would include the labor movement in the work of Elizabeth Perry (Harvard University), the student movement in that of Jeffrey Wasserstrom, the life of ordinary Shanghai dwellers in that of Lu Hanchao (Georgia Institute of Technology), and the world of British expatriates in that of Robert Bickers (University of Bristol).43</p>
<p>41  (Berkeley: Institute of East Asian Studies, University of California, 1992). Although it came out too late for me to assess, similar themes appear to be addressed in the recent volume edited by Jean Oi and Nara Dillon, <em>At the Crossroads of Empires: Middlemen, Social</em> <em>Networks and State-building in Republican Shanghai</em> (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2008).</p>

Wright (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1968). Chesneaux was one of the first foreigners, if not the very first, allowed to use Chinese historical archives; nearly two decades would pass before anyone else outside China was permitted access. Following in his teacher’s footsteps is Alain Roux (INALCO). See two of his books: <em>Le Shanghai ouvrier des années trente: coolies, gangsters et syndicalistes</em> (Paris: Editions L’Harmattan, 1993); and <em>Grèves et politique</em> <em>à Shanghai: les désillusions, 1927–1932</em> (Paris: Éditions de l’École des hautes études en sciences sociales, 1995).</li>

<p>98</p>
<p>The Recent Boom in Shanghai Studies</p>
<p>Where may Shanghai historical studies go from here? While all the usual avenues for research remain open and full of possibilities, some recent research offers hints about directions for the future. These include comparative urban history. Comparisons of Shanghai with other megalopolises need to have some meaningful grounding, or the results may be vaguely interesting but largely meaningless. Can Shanghai be compared, for example, with New York City on the basis of the fact that each is a port, the largest city on its respective continent, a major cultural center, not a political capital, and contains a multicultural mix, among other factors? One such joint Sino-Japanese research project produced an impressive volume, <em>Yokohama to Shanhai, kindai</em> <em>toshi keisei shi hikaku kenkyū (Yokohama and Shanghai, Comparative Studies in</em> <em>the History of the Formation of Modern Cities)</em>, * * in 1995.44 Scholars from China primarily looked at Yokohama’s history, while Japanese scholars were primarily responsible for Shanghai. A similarly notable volume on Edo (former name for Tokyo) and Paris, both political capitals and major population centers in the early modern period, appeared in English in 1994.45</p>
<p>Future researchers on Shanghai may also wish to address the internal comparison: Shanghai pre-1949 with Shanghai post-1978, the year that Deng Xiaoping (1904–97) launched the contemporary reforms that have opened China up. Yeh Wen-hsin touches on this in *Shanghai Splendor, * and Jeffrey Wasserstrom looks at it more closely in <em>Global Shanghai, 1850–2010</em>, a book I have only seen but not as yet had an opportunity to read closely.46 Interestingly, the Chinese themselves have not in the least shied away from the comparison—which needless to say puts the harshest years of Communism in a less than flattering light—largely, it would appear, to promote tourism.</p>
<p>More international cooperation in Shanghai studies would be a salutary development as well. At present and for obvious reasons, the most multi-laterally involved national group is the Chinese, involved with researchers from Europe, North America, Australia, Korea, and Japan. This is largely, of course, because all non-Chinese scholars have had to come to Shanghai to access materials and have forged bilateral ties with scholars at the Shanghai Academy, Fudan University, and elsewhere in the city. By comparison, Western scholars with a few exceptions are inattentive to developments in Japanese studies of Shanghai, whereas Japanese scholars are better informed about the Anglophone world. A multinational website for Shanghai studies might be a start, or perhaps links on Christian Henriot’s Virtual Shanghai website.</p>

<p>The Recent Boom In Shanghai Studies</p>
<p>99</p>
<p>While the Europeans in Shanghai have been studied, and the Japanese community is now getting its due, the significant Korean expatriate community deserves some attention. The Korean Communist Party was founded in Shanghai in 1921, the same year as the Chinese Communist Party. At the time Koreans, their country having been annexed by Japan in 1910, were considered Japanese nationals, making the ethnicity issue that much more complex. And, what about Vietnamese in Shanghai? We know that Ho Chi Minh (1890–1969), for example, passed through the city in the late 1920s. Did the French secret police exchange information with their Guomindang counterparts?</p>
<p>How did the Japanese—or any of the foreign communities of Shanghai—</p>
<p>living in the Concessions differ from their counterparts in other treaty port concessions (Chongqing, Tianjin, Hankou, Hangzhou, or elsewhere)? In some cities’ concessions, the Chinese were allowed to own land, while in others they were not. Comparative analysis would help explain such important differences in historical experience.47 And, how did Shanghai as a treaty port differ from other treaty ports? There have been many recent books on urban Chinese history (Suzhou, Hankou, Tianjin, in addition to those about Harbin mentioned above), though these have not been centrally focused on the treaty port quality of those cities.</p>
<p>One last thought for such comparative research would be to examine foreign and Chinese fiction set in Shanghai. Attempts by westerners to examine Yokomitsu Riichi’s (1898–1947) novel <em>Shanhai (Shanghai)</em> have been notably poor, and the recent English translation leaves much to be desired.48 But other Japanese authors also situated their tales in Shanghai, and everyone knows of André Malraux’s (1901–76) *La condition humaine *(translated into English as <em>Man’s Fate)</em>, a particularly sympathetic, fictional look at the Shanghai labor movement on the eve of its destruction. The Malraux-Yokomitsu comparison deserves a much closer look, as well as the broader international literary world of Shanghai in the prewar era. Both books appeared in the early 1930s to acclaim; both followed their authors’ respective visits to Shanghai several years before; and both reflected an almost instinctive support for the young Communist movement in the city.49</p>
<p>47  A good place to start: Ōsato Hiroaki and Son An-suk, eds., <em>Chūgoku ni okeru Nihon</em> *sokai: Jūkei, Kankō, Kōshū, Shanhai *( <em>Japanese Concessions in China: Chongqing, Hankou,</em> <em>Hangzhou, Shanghai</em>) (Tokyo: Ochanomizu shobō, 2006).</p>
<p>48 </p>
<p><em>Shanghai: A Novel</em>, * * trans. Dennis Washburn (Ann Arbor: Center for Japanese Studies, University of Michigan, 2001).</p>
<p>49  One interesting work in this vein is: Wada Hirofumi, Ōhashi Takehiko, Shindō Masahiro, Takematsu Yoshiaki, and Wada Keiko, <em>Gengo toshi Shanhai, 1840–1945 (Shanghai, City of</em> *Languages, 1840–1945) *(Tokyo: Fujiwara shoten, 1999).</p>

<p>The Recent Boom in Shanghai Studies</p>
<p>This review essay has concentrated on books published within the past two decades. Were it to have included journal articles and chapters in edited volumes, as well as older works, it would have been considerably more unwieldy.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding, it should be clear that great energy, particularly in the English- and Japanese-language worlds, has been devoted to the modern history of Shanghai over the past two decades. A fuller inclusion of Chinese-language publications would bloat this review beyond tolerable proportions.</p>
<p>Let me, however, conclude with a (not “the”) *magnum opus * of Shanghai studies, the fifteen-volume <em>Shanghai tongshi (Comprehensive History of Shanghai)</em>, * *</p>
<p>edited by the leader of Shanghai studies and former head of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, Xiong Yuezhi.50 Oddly, it begins with Shanghai’s validation as the “Paris of the Orient,” as if this might somehow warrant the immense collection that follows, but this is largely for internal Chinese consumption. The thousands of pages in this collection may not offer distinctively new approaches to historical research on Shanghai, but they do reveal countless new materials often based on data held exclusively in the immense Shanghai archives. They are the product of years of individual and group labors, and although not the final word on the subjects under study, they often provide a new first word for researchers around the world who can make use of Chinese-language materials.</p>
