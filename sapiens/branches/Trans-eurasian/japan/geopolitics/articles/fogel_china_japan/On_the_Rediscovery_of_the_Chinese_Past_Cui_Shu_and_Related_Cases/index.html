Wang’s works were not totally unknown during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries; in fact, from the research of Chinese scholars in the late 1950s and early 1960s, we know that more than a handful of Chinese scholars saw Wang’s writings in manuscript form and commented on them in their own essays throughout this lengthy hiatus.

  <p>What is meant by the “rediscovery” of some old text, ancient heritage, or person from another era? A whole range of differing circumstances surrounds each of the various entities that we include under this rubric. For instance, the rediscovery par excellence was Dunhuang, where for centuries texts had been preserved in a cave in Gansu Province, apparently without a soul ever having seen them. A less perfect although still exemplary case involved the works of Wang Fuzhi (1619–1692), the brilliant protonationalist and anti-Manchu her-mit from Hunan, whose writings were supposedly unknown for 150 years until Zeng Guofan (1811–1872) sponsored their republication. Wang’s works were not totally unknown during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries; in fact, from the research of Chinese scholars in the late 1950s and early 1960s, we know that more than a handful of Chinese scholars saw Wang’s writings in manuscript form and commented on them in their own essays throughout this lengthy hiatus. As one eminent sinologist explained to me, “It took a big shot like Zeng Guofan to sponsor the publication of so sensitive a writer as Wang.”1</p>
<p>This essay concerns several even less perfect cases of phenomena her-alded, nevertheless, by their promoters as “rediscoveries” (Chinese zai faxian; Japanese sai hakken)—in particular, that of the remarkable eighteenth-century historian and classical scholar Cui Shu (1740–1816). Cui’s works were never lost or sealed in a cave, nor were they remotely anti-Manchu; the importance of his ideas simply had been ignored for a century. Thus, his “rediscovery” involved the resuscitative efforts of twentieth-century scholars who found contemporary meaning in his writings that had been missed or ignored by other readers</p>

<p>On the “Rediscovery” of the Chinese Past</p>
<p>for many years. What is especially interesting about the case of Cui Shu is that his rediscovery occurred twice—once in China and once in Japan—under entirely different circumstances, and it therefore provides us with a fascinating case of comparative sinology. Thus, this essay has the following aims: (1) to present several cases of “rediscovery” of earlier historians by both Chinese and Japanese historians of this century; (2) to ask why Cui and others were seen as so vital by their revivers; (3) to interpolate possible Sino-Japanese connections; and (4) to discuss the importance of the rediscovery effort itself.</p>
<p>For nearly half a century the historiographical output of the Republican period has been shielded from critical evaluation by two connecting forces: (1) a pervasive nationalism, which among other things has taught students of modern Chinese history that all foreign powers and Japan in particular were monstrous ogres at virtually every turn (this can greatly distort one’s perception of events in twentieth-century history and bring an emotional charge to terms like “imperialist”), and (2) the research of a handful of men, like Hu Shi (1891–1962) and his group of students, whose overwhelming intellects have made serious criticism of their work, or in fact their whole intellectual project, extremely difficult. This essay concentrates on the latter of these forces, which itself was heavily influenced by Chinese nationalism. In recent years historians have begun to liberate themselves from this influence and slowly have gained a better understanding of both scholarship in and the history of the Republican period. Nevertheless, much work remains to be done; much needs to be reassessed. Furthermore, whereas we know something about political ties between the Chinese and Japanese in that period (e.g., Sun Zhongshan, Li Dazhao, China rōnin, anarchism), we know much less of intellectual or scholarly ties. For that matter, we know little about late nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century Japanese sinology. I hope to contribute here to a better understanding of these traditions of scholarship.</p>

<p><strong>Cui Shu’s Dual Rediscovery</strong></p>
<p>In the April 1923 issue of Guoxue jikan [Journal of National Studies], Hu Shi introduced Cui Shu, a then little-known scholar from Zhili, to a large segment of the Chinese intellectual world. Several years before, Gu Jiegang (1893–1980), Hu’s pupil, had begun a laborious process of editing and punctuating Cui’s entire corpus of writings; the final product appeared fifteen years later in 1936</p>
<p>in sixteen string-bound volumes ( ce) as the Cui Dongbi yishu [Collected Works of Cui Shu]. In his biography of Gu, Laurence Schneider wrote that “of all the obscure scholars that he resuscitated . . . none had been more obscure than</p>
<p>On the “Rediscovery” of the Chinese Past</p>
<p>619</p>
<p>Cui Shu, nor did any receive more lavish treatment and studied reverence.”2</p>
<p>Schneider suggested that Hu learned of Cui from Zhang Xuecheng’s writings, but as the late Arthur Hummel pointed out in his superb essay on Cui, there is in fact “no evidence” that Zhang knew of Cui Shu’s existence.3 The information came from elsewhere.</p>
<p>The Cui Dongbi yishu contains not only an edited and punctuated edition of Cui’s writings, it includes numerous essays by those who collaborated with Gu in the project (Qian Mu [b. 1895], Qian Xuantong [1887–1938], Hu Shi, William Hung [Hong Ye; 1893–1980], Zhao Zhenxin, and others); reprints of portions of many essays that touch on Cui; a complete punctuated edition of the extant writings of Cui’s younger brother Cui Mai ( Cui Degao xiansheng yishu</p>
<p>[Collected Works of Mr. Cui Degao]) and of four of Cui’s ancestors, several in-laws, and close relatives; maps of Cui’s travels; and more. In the following year William Hung and others prepared an index to Ciu’s work, the Cui Dongbi yishu yinde, as part of the Harvard–Yenching index series.4</p>
<p>Throughout much of the introductory sections to the Cui Dongbi yishu, thanks and praise are traded among the editors with great delight over their completed project.5 Perhaps the most revealing of these sections, however, is Gu Jiegang’s own prefatory comments, in which he explains in detail how he 2  Laurence A.

This short essay on Cui is the best I have seen in any language. Hummel was apparently really taken with Cui. Professor Chaoying Fang, who did a great deal of work on the Eminent Chinese of the Ch’ing Period project, told me that he added to or touched up virtually every entry in that volume except Hummel’s on Cui, to which he made no alterations whatsoever.

<p>5  Qian Mu’s introduction deserves special mention for its typically brilliant command (even forty years ago) of all sorts of materials. His conclusion that Cui Shu, like Chinese people and thinkers in general, always suffered from an over-abundance of reverence for antiquity, is the hallmark of his famous Zhongguo jin saibainian xueshu shi [Chinese Intellectual History over the Past Three Hundred Years] (Shanghai: Commercial Press, 1986).

<p>found various of the Cui materials and identifies who helped at which points of the project. This is interesting less for its content than for the fact that Gu makes no mention that Cui’s works had been edited, punctuated, and published thirty-two years earlier in Japan.6 We will return to this omission shortly.</p>
<p>In the case of Cui Shu, something closer to the ordinary usage of the term</p>
<p>“rediscovery” occurred at the turn of this century with a group of Japanese sinologists.7 In 1900 one of the founders of the Kyoto school of sinology, Kano Naoki (1868–1947), was performing some research in Beijing when the Boxer Rebellion erupted. He is said to have gone to great risks in carrying out with him twenty-five juan in manuscript form of Cui Shu’s most famous work, the Kaoxin lu [Record of Investigating Beliefs]. When he arrived in Japan, he showed them to Naka Michiyo (1851–1908), who is generally considered the father of modern sinology in Japan and is the man who coined the term Tōyōshi (East Asian history).8 Naka was convinced quickly that Cui was someone of intellectual import and set out to prepare an edited and punctuated edition (with Japanese-reading punctuation) of the Chinese texts of Cui’s writings.</p>
<p>6  Gu Jiegang, “Xu” [Introduction] to Cui Dongbi yishu, vol. 1, pp. 1–4. Gu reveals later in other prefatory notes, comments, and by the inclusion of various essays that he was fully aware of the Japanese edition, and Hu Shi knew of it many years before. Gu, though, chose to ignore it here.</p>

The story goes that at a meeting of middle and upper normal school teachers in 1894, Naka proposed a division of the generic course, “Gaikoku rekishi” (History of foreign countries), into “Seiyōshi” (Western history) and “Tōyōshi” (East Asian history). His proposal was accepted, and so the term Tōyōshi was born. For Naka it meant all East Asian nations (except Japan), with China at the center. By 1897 the Japanese Ministry of Education had recognized Naka’s proposal, and a textbook bearing the title Tōyōshi soon followed. The terms Seiyō and Seiyōshi predate this episode, as does the expression Tōyō.</p>
<p>On the “Rediscovery” of the Chinese Past</p>
<p>621</p>
<p>In December 1900, an announcement of the project appeared in the main Japanese historical journal of the day, Shigaku zasshi [Journal of History], and said that Naka’s edition would appear as the second item in the Shigakkai sōsho</p>
<p>[Series of the Historical Association]. The notice concluded by reiterating that Cui Shu’s work was extremely important and that it expressed the realization of the idea of “anticipating [clouds and] rainbows in the midst of a great drought” ( taikan ni gei o nozomu), a kind of awkward allusion to the “Liang Huiwang” chapter of the Mencius.9</p>
<p>Naitō Konan (1866–1934), the other principal founder of the Kyoto school, read this notice while in Ōsaka as a staff member of the Ōsaka asahi shinbun and wrote an article, “Dokusho gūhitsu” [Random Notes on Books Read], which the serial Nihon published on January 2, 1901. He apparently had known of Cui before Kano found the Beijing texts, for in his lectures at Kyoto University, which were later turned into the Shina shigaku shi [History of Chinese Historiography], he noted that Naitō Chisō (1826–1902; no relation), an eminent historian of Japan, had read of Cui in the Kuochao xianzheng shilüe</p>
<p>[Biographies of Prominent Chinese of the Qing Dynasty],10 was impressed, and mentioned it to Konan. Chisō had died already, and Konan already owned his own set of Cui’s works by the time of the first Shigaku zasshi notice.</p>

James Legge, The Chinese Classics, Vol. II: The Works of Mencius (London: Trübner and Co., 1861), p. 47. In this passage, Mencius is referring to an incident from the Shujing [Classic of Documents] to illustrate how anxiously and excitedly the people viewed the great work being done by Tang—later, in the same section, Mencius says, “it was like rain falling at the right time, the people were ecstatic” ( ruo shi yu xia, min ta yue).</p>
<p>10  This account of Cui’s ideas is fascinating and oddly never previously attracted anyone’s attention (so far as we now know). It describes Cui’s distinctive historiographic approach, which we shall examine shortly, and goes into considerable detail. See Li Yuandu, Guochao xianzheng shilüe (Taibei reprint: Wenhai chubanshe, n.d.), vol. 86, pp. 1651–61. As an aside, there is also an entry (from two sources) on Cui in the Guochao qixian leizheng chubian</p>
<p>[Biographies of Qing Venerables and Worthies, Arranged by Categories], comp. Li Huan (Taibei reprint, 1966), vol. 14, p. 8282; this predates all rediscovery efforts by at least a decade, the whole collection having been completed in 1890. I have gone through rapidly the works of Naitō Chisō that I could locate and have found no reference to Cui Shu; my guess is that the communication to Konan was either by letter or done orally. For a brief introduction to Naitō Chisō, see Takasu Yoshijirō, “Kaidai” [Explanatory Preface], in Mitogaku taikei [Great Compendium of the Mito School] (Tokyo: Ida shoten, 1941), vol. 7, p. 15. Chisō was a Kangaku scholar from the domain of Edo who lived into the mid-Meiji era. His principal work was the multivolume Tokugawa jūgodai shi [A History of the Fifteen Generations of the Tokugawa].</p>
<p>622</p>
<p>On the “Rediscovery” of the Chinese Past</p>
<p>Naitō Konan’s edition was almost certainly a text that had been in Japan since late Tokugawa times. As he personally communicated to his student, Kanda Kiichirō (1897–1984), his edition had come from China and was held in the library of the domain of Tōdō in Ise; this is odd, considering that Cui’s works are not listed among the Chinese books that made their way to Japan in the Edo period.11 In his response to this notice, Naitō reported that his own copy of the Cui Dongbi xiansheng yishu [Collected Works of Mr. Cui Shu] had fifty-five juan and that the Kano–Naka edition did not even contain the complete Kaoxin lu. He went on to suggest strongly that Cui Shu’s works be published as a zenshū (collected works) for the benefit of future readers and cheerfully offered his copy to the Shigakkai sōsho editors. Naitō then moved briefly to a discussion of Cui’s life written by his disciple and original compiler, Chen Lihe (1761–1825), and to the entry on Cui in the Kuochao xianzheng shilüe of which Naitō then translated a large portion.12 Naitō concluded in a thinly veiled tone of slight disgust concerning the way in which the Shigaku zasshi  reporters had ended their first notice about “long droughts”; he worded his statement in such a way as to defend Qing scholarship of the Jiaqing (1796–1821) and Daoguang (1821–1851) periods against the idea that this had been a thoroughly arid era in serious historical research.13</p>
<p>In the next issue of Shigaku zasshi, a month later, the editors fell all over each other in apology for their errors in the earlier notice and in gratitude to</p>
<p>“Naitō Konan’s great kindness . . . and genius.” They also reported that Naitō</p>
<p>had lent his edition to Naka Michiyo.14 Naka spent the next three years poring over these texts, punctuating them, correcting errors, and preparing them for 11  Kanda Kiichirō, “Naitō Konan to Shina kodai shi” [Naitō Konan and Ancient Chinese History], in Tonkōgaku gojūnen [Fifty Years of the Study of Dunhuang] (Tokyo: Chikuma shobō, 1960), p. 90; and Ōba Osamu, Edo jidai ni okeru mochiwatari sho no kenkyū [A Study of the Books Brought over from China in the Edo Period] (Suita: Kansai daigaku tōzai gakujutsu kenkyūjo, 1967).</p>
<p>12  Hashimoto and Tam, following Hashimoto, argue that Naitō prepared a biography of Cui (in this essay), based on rare works (Tam, “In Search of the Oriental Past,” p. 173) and explicated the Kaoxin lu (Hashimoto, “Sen-Shin jidai shi,” p. 408). In actuality, Naitō</p>
<p>merely translated the section on Cui from the Kuochao xianzheng shilüe, not at all a rare source. Implicit in his doing such a translation, I believe, was criticism of the Shigakkai sōsho project, because there are sections in the source translated that refer to works by Cui that the Shigakkai sōsho people did not know of.</p>

<p>publication. In the midst of this work, he published an article on the critical importance of Cui Shu’s Kaoxin lu.15   By 1903 three of four prospective volumes were published; by April 1904 the entire project was complete.16 Naka was so excited with this Cui Shu find that in his more popular work, Naka Tōyō ryakushi</p>
<p>[Naka’s Brief History of East Asia], published in December 1903 while he was still engaged in his Cui Shu research, he devoted a full half page of praise to Cui and the Kaoxin lu,   more space than was allotted to Huang Zongxi (1610–1695), Gu Yanwu (1613–1682), Wang Yangming (1472–1529), Sima Qian (135?–93? bce), or virtually any other figure in East Asian history.17</p>
<p>Such an extremely high estimate of Cui was not limited to Naka Michiyo.</p>
<p>On the one hand, Kano seems to have retained a measure of objectivity with respect to Cui;18 and Naitō, aside from a considerable number of references to Cui’s judgments about the validity of certain ancient texts—to which he referred in his own history of ancient China—seemingly wrote nothing about Cui of an evaluative nature.19 On the other hand, however, many others wrote extremely adulatory things about Cui, including Naka’s biographer and a famous historian in his own right, Miyake Yonekichi (1860–1929), who in commenting on Naka’s edition of Cui’s works compared Cui to Motoori Norinaga (1830–1901)—Motoori’s Kojiki den [Commentary on the Kojiki] and Cui’s Kaoxin lu both being exemplary criticisms of biased views of the true meaning of the classics20 (albeit an entirely different set of classics).

<p>The excitement that greeted Cui Shu’s rediscovery in Japan found a parallel twenty years later in China.

<p>A brief comparison of the original Cui Dongbi xiansheng yishu compiled by Chen Lihe (with an afterward dated 1825) with the Naka edition and the Gu Jiegang edition seems in order at this point. I was fortunate enough to have had the opportunity to look through a rare copy of one of the original editions of the Cui work at the Kyoto University Library and to make use of Professor Kuwabara Jitsuzō’s (1870–1931) own copy of the Naka edition, which is replete with Kuwabara’s red-penciled notes and place markers throughout the text. (Kuwabara’s collection was donated to the library of the Faculty of Letters at Kyoto University by his son, Professor Kuwabara Takeo.) Naka Michiyo’s work entailed a reprinting on excellent paper of the contents of the original Chen edition with the addition of punctuation and a certain amount of textual analysis of copying errors. In essence, Gu Jiegang did the same thing. Aside from general clause and sentence breaks, however, the punctuation systems differ. Naka, of course, inserted the Japanese reading punctuation ( kaeriten) that enables a Japanese reader of literary Chinese to reorder the sentence so that it may be read in the ordinary Japanese word order, thus indicating subjects, objects, verbs, and even articles. On the other hand, Gu used Western punctuation with periods and commas, even adding quotation marks, exclamation points, and, most significantly, separate indications (with differently textured marginal lines) of toponyms, titles of texts, and personal names. (Compare Cui Dongbi xiansheng yishu, comp. Chen Lihe, 55 juan, afterward dated 1825; Naka Michiyo, ed., Sai Tōheki isho; and Gu Jiegang, main editor, Cui Dongbi yishu). The major difference between the two twentieth-century editions, aside from numerous prefaces and reprinted material not by Cui himself in the Chinese one, was the discovery by William Hung of a lengthy poetry collection of Cui’s, the Zhifei ji [The Knowing Fallacy Collection], which he found in the Yanjing University Library in 1931, over a decade into Gu’s project. It had been listed in Cui’s own original table of contents, but when Chen Lihe later compiled this edition of Cui’s writings, the Zhifei ji was not included and was thus presumed lost. It and several other bits and pieces supposedly lost were similarly punctuated, edited, and included in the thirteenth ce of the Chinese edition. (See Gu, “Xu” [Introduction], to Cui’s Zhifei ji, in Cui Dongbu yishu, vol. 13, pp. 2–3, 16. Hu and Gu discovered several other hitherto “lost”</p>
<p>Cui poems and essays, also inserted in this volume of the collected works. This is the major contribution of the Chinese edition.)</p>
<p>On the “Rediscovery” of the Chinese Past</p>
<p>625</p>
<p>Arthur Hummel, who translated Gu’s introduction to the Gushi bian [Symposium on Ancient History] as The Autobiography of a Chinese Historian, states without a trace of doubt that “in 1921 Dr. Hu Shih [Hu Shi] came across a Japanese edition” of Cui’s works, surely the Naka reprint.22 “Though this is an excellent reprint,” wrote Hummel elsewhere, “it attracted little notice in China,” except for an occasional mention, often with glaring errors or misunderstandings.23</p>
<p>Yet the Chinese editors clearly knew of Naka’s work and even praised it here and there. In a 1923 article, Hu Shi stated plainly that, as a result of Naka’s work,</p>
<p>“Chinese gradually came to know that such a man as Cui Shu has lived.”24 Hu pointed out also that Liu Shipei (1884–1919) had seen the Japanese text and was influenced by it to write a short biography of Cui for the journal Guocui xuebao</p>
<p>[Journal of the National Essence] as early as 1907. This essay was punctuated and included in the Gu Jiegang edition of Cui’s works. Similarly, Zhao Zhenxin, who proofread the original Cui Dongbi xiansheng yishu  for errors, remarked in a preface that Cui was not at all well known in China until Naka’s edition was published.25 Near the very end of the Chinese edition were selections from a number of Chinese works relevant to Cui and translations of several Japanese writings; Gu pointed out in his introduction to this section (one of the few times Gu had anything to say of the Japanese edition) that the Naka reprint had led to Cui Shu’s first recognition by Chinese scholars such as Liu Shipei and Ge Xiao, a recognition that spread slowly. Other references to the Japanese text in the Gu edition include several paragraphs in translation from Miyake Yonekichi’s biography of Naka as well as an excerpted translation by the young historian Zhou Yiliang of an essay on Cui by Okazaki Fumio (1888–1950) that appeared in 1927 in Shinagaku, the pre-eminent journal of the Kyoto school of sinology.</p>

<p><strong>Cui Shu and the Uses of History</strong></p>
<p>As Schneider points out, Cui Shu’s writings were “the single body of thought most influential on Ku Chieh-kang’s [Gu Jiegang’s] study of antiquity.”26 Let us scrutinize this influence a little more closely.

In Cui’s language this process is called bushang or bushang gu, “adding on to antiquity,” and, in explicating this process by which fabricated strata of history were added on backward in successive periods, Cui was performing an act of Confucian reverence; in Schneider’s words, “with each new discovery of a layer of counterfeit history over the authentic classical stratum, Cui became more assured that he was performing his calling to protect the Tao [Dao], protect the Sages, and protect the canon.”27</p>
<p>Gu Jiegang used and developed this approach in a more secular manner to brilliant ends in his own studies of ancient Chinese history.</p>
<p>As in the case of Cui’s rediscovery itself, however, we find a slightly earlier, parallel development in Japanese historiographic circles. Naitō Konan, one of the central figures in the Japanese rediscovery of Cui Shu, in 1897 published one of his first book-length works, Kinsei bungaku shiron [A Historical Discussion of Modern Japanese Scholarship],28 from a series of articles previously published in the Ōsaka asahi shinbun. It was essentially an intellectual history of the Tokugawa period (1600–1868); however, Naitō selected as</p>
<p>“absolutely the most original and enlightening scholars in the three hundred years” of the Tokugawa era: Tominaga Nakamoto (1715–1746), Yamagata Bantō</p>
<p>(1748–1821), and Miura Baien (1723–1789),29 an extraordinarily unorthodox selection when one considers that these three figures were barely known at that time. Naitō was particularly impressed by Tominaga, a virtual unknown until the publication of Naitō’s work, and his book, Shutsujō kōgo [Emerging from Meditation].30 Tominaga (like Yamagata and Miura) was a nonsamurai, 27  Laurence Schneider, “From Textual Criticism to Social Criticism: The Historiography of Ku Chieh-kang,” Journal of Asian Studies 28.4 (August 1969), p. 777; and Schneider, Ku Chieh-kang, pp. 197–98.</p>

<p>627</p>
<p>nonprofessional scholar from an Ōsaka merchant background, and Naitō was especially pleased by his commoner origins. It appears, interestingly enough, that Naitō first heard of Tominaga from Naitō Chisō, as evidenced by Konan’s first essay concerning Tominaga, “Choin sango” [Scattered Words in the Shade of a Tree of Useless Wood], published in 1893.31</p>
<p>In the Shutsujō kōgo, Tominaga presented his theory of kajō (Chinese jiashang; “accumulation to” or “adding on to antiquity”) in debunking the development of Buddhism. He demonstrated that as each new Buddhist sect preached the superiority of its heaven to all those preceding it, there accumulated a hierarchy of heavens, created backward. Naitō Konan employed this theoretical conception to study ancient Chinese history. He showed that while Confucius generally cited the Duke of Zhou (or Tang) as the essential beginning of Chinese history and institutions, Mozi went back to King Yu of the Xia dynasty. Mencius went back even further to Yao and Shun, who both abdicated their thrones to men of virtue rather than to their own sons, as had Yu—hence Mo-tzu’s ideal was not as good as the earlier Yao–Shun paradigm.</p>
<p>Somewhat later, the Daoists went back as far as the Yellow Emperor, before Yao and Shun; the nongjia (agriculturalist school) made Shennong the beginning, and the divination school went still further back to Fuxi; finally, the Daoist alchemists (  fangshi) spoke of the sanhuang (three deities)— tianhuang (heavenly deity), dihuang (earthly deity), and taihuang (great deity)—as the start of it all.32 Professor Miyazaki Ichisada, one of Naitō’s most famous disciples, Ōsaka in 1921, later included in Nihon bunka shi kenkyū [Studies in the History of Japanese Culture], in Naitō Konan zenshū, vol. 9, pp. 149–57; “Ōsaka no chōnin gakusha Tominaga Nakamoto” [Tominaga Nakamoto, a Scholar of the Ōsaka Merchant Class], in Sentetsu no gakumon [The Scholarship of Former Wise Men], in Naitō Konan zenshū, vol. 9, pp. 370–93, esp. pp. 377–78 on kajō; “Tominaga Nakamoto no ‘Okina no fumi’ni tsuite’ ”</p>

<p>31  See Naitō Konan, “Choin sango,” in Ruishu dashu [Tears and Saliva], in Naitō Konan zenshū, vol. 1, pp. 380–400; the reference to Naitō Chisō appears on p. 380.</p>
<p>32  This is laid out much more elegantly in Naitō Konan, Shina jōko shi [Ancient Chinese History], in Naitō Konan zenshū, vol. 10, pp. 19–23, 145–46. For a slightly different rendition, see Naitō Konan, “Ōsaka no chōnin gakusha Tominaga Nakamoto,” in Naitō Konan zenshū, vol. 9, pp. 387–88. Naitō also used this kajō methodology in his studies of the Shujing, Erya, and Yijing; all are included in his Kenki shōroku [Short Essays for Clarification], in Naitō Konan zenshū, vol. 7. They are “Shōsho keigi” [Pondering Doubtful Spots in the Shangshu ( Shujing)], vol. 7, pp. 9–23; “Jiga no shin kenkyū” [A New Study of the Erya], vol. 7, pp. 24–37; and “Eki gi” [Doubts about the Yijing], vol. 7, pp. 38–47.</p>

<p>has remarked of this inverse development: “A lineage of saints was formed in a direction opposite to the chronological order, a lineage generated by different schools successively vying for superiority.”33</p>
<p>Clearly, Cui Shu’s bushang and Tominaga Nakamoto’s kajō are extremely similar, if not methodologically identical, ideas. Gu draws directly from Cui and Naitō directly from Tominaga. Miyazaki has suggested that Gu Jiegang’s work on ancient China may have been influenced by Naitō, but he frankly admits that he cannot say for sure.34 And, nowhere does Gu make reference to such an influence. While he certainly knew of Naitō either through the Cui Shu project (although neither he nor any other of the Chinese editors ever mention Naitō’s contribution) or many other possible links, according to Gu his source was always Cui. Similarly, we know that Naitō was intimately aware of Cui Shu’s historical theories; however, citations to Cui’s works in Naitō are always to corroborate this or that exegetical point and, aside from the instances mentioned above, not of an overall historiographic nature; for that Naitō had Tominaga.</p>
<p>One might suggest that we have here a dual case of scholarly nationalism, with each twentieth-century historian explicitly deriving his source of inspiration from the eighteenth-century scholar of his own nation. This view does not adequately describe Naitō, however, because, although firmly nationalistic, his vision was much broader and he often relied on the writings and theories of Chinese scholars past and present. For Naitō the overall East Asian sphere centered on China, whose culture he considered the most advanced in the world. Witness, for instance, his admiration for the works of Sima Qian, Zhao Yi (1727–1812), Qian Daxin (1728–1804), Gu Yanwu, and particularly his close friends, Luo Zhenyu (1866–1940) and Wang Guowei (1877–1927), among many others. It would sound strange indeed to hear Naitō echo the kind of sentiments we will soon hear Hu Shi and Luo Zhenyu utter. Yet Gu does not seem 33  Miyazaki Ichisada, “Dokusōteki na Shinagakusha Naitō Konan hakase” [An Innovative Sinologist, Professor Naitō Konan], in Chōgoku ni manabu [Studying China] (Tokyo: Asahi shinbunsha, 1971), p. 257.

Kanda Kiichirō, a scholar of ancient China, has also noted the striking similarity between Gu’s and Naitō’s methodologies; see Kanda, “Naitō Konan to Shina kodai shi,” p. 88.

<p>to reflect this kind of eclecticism; by the same token, Naitō did not have to contend with numerous brilliant Chinese Japanologists.</p>
<hr>
<p>**Why Cui Shu? **</p>
<p>This is indeed the crucial question. The simple answer, that Hu and Gu made a remarkable, independent rediscovery for China of one Cui Shu, a forgotten eighteenth-century man of great historiographic talents, seems no longer sufficient to explain their selection of this figure. Schneider’s answer takes us a little further into the problem but is still just the tip of the iceberg: “Cui was a perfect subject for the scholar’s hall of fame because of the range and brilliance of his critical thought, his charming style of writing, and, of course, his mistreatment by the Chinese scholar—official world.”35 The Cui find may have been happily unexpected (although I have serious doubts about this possibility), but the general scheme into which Cui was either placed or forced must be brought into clearer focus.</p>
<p>We should first bear in mind the continuing search by late nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century Chinese intellectuals for precedents in their own culture for views and attitudes deemed “modern” in their own day.</p>
<p>Scholars of all political persuasions took part in this search, which at times seems to have taken on the air of a parlor game. In due course we find Huang Zongxi dubbed “China’s Rousseau” by Chen Tianhua (1875–1905), Guan Zi (d. 645 bce) labeled “the first Chinese materialist” by Feng Youlan (1895–1990) and others; and Kang Youwei (1858–1927) identified as “China’s Luther” by Liang Qichao (1873–1929). Wang Fuzhi has been seen alternately as China’s answer to the eighteenth-century French materialists, to Kant, and to Hegel; he has even been portrayed as a proto-Marxist by many different scholars.</p>
<p>In such a context, we can see that Cui was a fortuitous find indeed. To scholars of the early Republican era it was clear that one of Western scholarship’s superior points was its reliance on the scientific method and its use of proof in the discipline of history. The numerous fallacies and contradictions and the political conservatism inherent in Western positivistic thought36 were disregarded. Cui appeared as an early paragon of Western-style historical research, while his methodology demonstrated that China’s tradition of hard, critical historians proudly survived into the period of the Jiaqing reign. This theme is 35  Schneider,</p>
<p>Ku Chieh-kang, p. 93.</p>
<p>36  This theme has been treated by Herbert Marcuse in his Reason and Revolution: Hegel and the Rise of Social Theory (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1963).</p>
<p>630</p>
<p>On the “Rediscovery” of the Chinese Past</p>
<p>self-evident in the title of Hu’s inaugural article, “Kexue de gushijia Cui Shu”</p>
<p>[Cui Shu, a Scientific Historian of Ancient China]. Interestingly, Hu admitted thirteen years later, in an introduction to Gu’s edition of Cui’s works, that he may have overestimated Cui’s greatness in this 1921 essay, given that much new material, relevant to the study of ancient China (specifically mentioned are oracle bones and bronze inscriptions) had been uncovered in the past century, but he adamantly maintained that Cui’s scientific spirit of “investigate and only then believe” ( kao er hou xin) would never die.37</p>
<p>Science (it was, in fact, scientism) was a magic word in early twentieth-century China, as it remains to a certain extent, and its forced entrance into the methodology of modern humanistic studies betokened another magic word, progress. This attitude lay behind Hu Shi’s practice of proudly counting the number of proofs supplied by various Qing textual critical ( kaozheng) scholars seeking to prove the authenticity or spuriousness of sections of the classical canon, and then pointing to this as evidence of an indigenous scientific strain in Chinese scholarship.</p>
<p>Such a line of argument, however, reflects only one part of the overall picture. As we have seen, Cui had been rediscovered much earlier in Japan and was known in China considerably before Hu and Gu began to work on his writings and to lionize his spirit. To a large extent, the zeitgeist of early Republican intellectual circles lent Cui the aura of a “pioneer” in their eyes, a view that could not be mustered thirty years earlier in China when the Naka edition first appeared but could be in mid-Meiji Japan. The idea that someone can be ahead of his or her time is, of course, as ahistorical as it is meaningless; nonetheless, certain figures of the past do often strike us as more “modern” than others. This appearance or illusion, however, is entirely due to the concerns of the present, and in the 1920s Cui was for the first time perceived in China as a forerunner of critical, scientific historical research.</p>
<p>Similarly, Wang Fuzhi, even after being rediscovered, was not actively republished and circulated until the 1900s and 1910s, when people perceived his peculiarly irreverent attitudes and his contempt for the influence of state orthodox Confucianism on conceptions of history and certain historical figures. Perhaps most important in Wang’s case was the realization that he advocated a developmental, progressivistic, protomaterialistic theory of history and an anti-Manchu nationalism (theoretical as well as emotional) with extraordinarily</p>
<p>“modern” (ca. 1900–1911) applicability. His historicism had Chinese roots—</p>
<p>Du You (735–812) of the Tang had argued along similar (although not widely accepted) lines—but his nationalism and indeed his conception of China as a 37  Hu Shi, “Xu” [Introduction], to Cui Dongbi yishu, vol. 1, pp. 4, 6–7.</p>
<p>On the “Rediscovery” of the Chinese Past</p>
<p>631</p>
<p>“nation” seem to have had little meaning until the late Qing–early Republican era. In this way, rediscovery may be possessed of a largely self-serving objective totally unrelated to the normal usage of the term.</p>
<p>It is vital that we understand that the cluster of names we associate with a historical period or incident has not fallen from the sky but has been supplied to us by former scholars. Hu Shi and his group of students and colleagues did significant groundwork, particularly with the Cui Dongbi yishu, and we have not as yet transcended them.</p>
<p>Finally, it appears that there was a great deal more conscious effort at work in the Chinese rediscovery of Cui Shu than in the Japanese. More than an act of scholarship (as it seems was the case with Naka Michiyo), Gu Jiegang and Hu Shi were engaged in such enormous labors, much of which already had been done, virtually as an act of nationalism. While Naka seems never to have had any intention that his edition be consumed widely by people other than scholars, Gu’s and Hu’s work was intended clearly as a popularization of Cui Shu, to make him known to as wide an audience of Chinese readers as possible. This kind of nationalistic scholarship shines through in a comment made by Hu Shi in his 1923 essay: “That such a great scholar with such impressive writings should have been buried for a hundred years [ sic] is indeed a great shame to the Chinese intellectual community.”38 This same attitude is reflected in a comment made in 1899 by Luo Zhenyu in an introduction to his edition of Naka Michiyo’s Shina tsūshi [Comprehensive History of China], written in literary Chinese: “Alas, it is shameful [indeed] that the history of our country cannot be written by our own kinsmen but must be written by one of another country.”39</p>
<p>Despite fifteen years of work preparing the Cui Dongbi yishu for publication, with a certain amount of time to reflect on Cui’s real importance, Gu Jiegang noted in a letter to Qian Xuantong that regretfully Cui was only a “Confucianist criticizing ancient history; not an historian criticizing ancient history.”40 Of course, one should not necessarily be held accountable by the scholarly community for comments made in private (or semiprivate) letters, but it is clear that Gu was dismayed here because Cui could not fully jump from the 38  Hu Shi, “Kexue de gushijia Cui Shu,” in Cui Dongbi yishu, vol. 2, p. 5.</p>
<p>39  Quoted in Miyake Yonekichi, “Bungaku hakase Naka Michiyo kun den,” p. 27. Naka Michiyo’s Shina tsūshi was the first modern comprehensive history of China. It has been translated into literary Japanese by Wada Sei as volumes 418–20 in the Iwanami bunko series (Tokyo: Iwanami shoten, 1975).</p>

<p>632</p>
<p>On the “Rediscovery” of the Chinese Past</p>
<p>eighteenth century into the twentieth: Cui must remain a creature of his time.</p>
<p>In a more level-headed moment, Gu fully understood this dilemma: I could not minimize his [Cui’s] limitations, the work being marred by traditional prejudices and by excessive faith in the classics and the doctrines of Confucius and Mencius. It would be unfair, however, to reproach him for this: he was born in a home that reverenced the Song philosophy, and his purpose in writing was to brush aside everything that stood in the way of an understanding of the ancient sages. He employed the critical method primarily to further this end. Our duty is to go a step further and overthrow his preconcep-tions, reconstructing classical study upon new foundations.41</p>
<p>Our task now is to take one step more than Gu’s generation.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Two Further Rediscoveries</strong></p>
<p>Several other rediscovery efforts of the twentieth century may elaborate on and perhaps even elucidate this problem. Naitō Konan is generally accorded the honor of being the first person to have recognized anew the value of Zhang Xuecheng’s (1738–1801) brilliant historiographic insights.42 Naitō began reading Zhang’s major works, the Wenshi tongyi [General Principles of Literature and History] and the Jiaochou tongyi [General Principles of Bibliography] in 1902 and later, through connections in China, was able to obtain a manuscript copy of Zhang’s writings, the Zhangshi yishu [The Writings of Mr. Zhang], in eighteen ce. Naitō relates that he was so excited about reading Zhang’s works that he read all that he possessed straight through to the end and then gave part of them to Kano Naoki; later, Zhang was to become something of a rage at Kyoto University. Yet, despite all the praise others have accorded him, Naitō</p>
<p>admitted that Chinese such as Zhang Ertian (1869–1945) and Sun Deqian (1869–1935) had known of and had been reading Zhang’s work for some time; 41  Ku,</p>

<p>633</p>
<p>and we know that Zhang Binglin (1869–1936) and perhaps even Gong Zizhen (1792–1841) were aware of Zhang Xuecheng’s ideas.43</p>
<p>A native of eastern Zhejiang and landsmann of Zhang Xuecheng, Zhang Ertian was the author of Shiwei [The Little Things in History], published in 1911, in which he actively attempted to revive the historiographic approach of his fellow native.44 However, I do not believe that this was the connection to which Naitō Konan’s praise of Zhang Ertian and Sun Deqian referred. Naitō</p>
<p>knew of Zhang Xuecheng well before 1911 and in that year, probably before he knew of the Shiwei, gave a lecture in Hiroshima on Chinese historical scholarship in which he noted that “the most famous figure of the Eastern Zhejiang school was Zhang Xuecheng. It was he who made the general differentiation of schools between Eastern and Western Zhejiang; and his work, the Wenshi tongyi, is a brilliant comprehensive discussion of writings on history ( shiron) or historiography ( shigaku).”45</p>
<p>Naitō was friendly with Shen Zengzhi (1850–1922), author of Menggu yuanlu jianzheng [Notes on the Origins of the Mongols], and considered him an exceptionally gifted scholar. Shen’s “disciples,” whom Naitō also personally knew and for whom he was also full of praise, were Zhang Ertian, who later compiled the Menggu yuanlu jianzheng and added his own jiaobu 43  Naitō Konan, “Shō Gakusei no shigaku” [Zhang Xuecheng’s Historiography], appended to Shina shigaku shi, in Naitō Konan zenshū, vol. 11, p. 471. Zhang Ertian and Sun Deqian are mentioned by Naitō but not by Nivison. Zhang Binglin’s reference to Zhang Xuecheng is cited by Nivison, Life and Thought, p. 283. Gong Zizhen is listed for discussion by Naitō</p>
<p>but never discussed in this context, because no student notes from this lecture existed at the time this work was compiled; see Shina Shigaku shi, in Naitō Konan zenshū, vol. 11, p. 447; however, Nivison makes this possible connection elegantly clear, Life and Thought, pp. 281–82. Naitō provides elaboration of Sun’s and Zhang’s ties to Zhang Xuecheng in the field of bibliographic studies ( muluxue or mokurokugaku); see Naitō, Shina mokurokugaku</p>
<p>[Bibliographic Studies in China], originally lectures at Kyoto University, April–June 1926, in Naitō Konan zenshū, vol. 12, p. 437. This book provides much information on Zhang’s contribution to this field.</p>
<p>44  See Deng Zhicheng, “Zhang jun Mengqu biezhuan” [A Biography of Mr. Zhang Mengju (Ertian)], Yanjing xuebao 30 (June 1946), pp. 323–25. Zhang’s interests were widespread, although he is perhaps most famous for his role in the writing and compiling of the Qing shi gao [Draft History of the Qing Dynasty].</p>
<p>45  Naitō Konan, “Shina gakumon no kinjō” [The Present State of Chinese Scholarship], originally presented as a lecture in Hiroshima on August 8, 1911, in Naitō Konan zenshū, vol. 6, p. 56. In the Shinchō shi tsūron, given as lectures in the summer of 1915, Naitō had virtually adulatory things to say about Zhang: “No one who came after him could compare with so rare a genius” as seen particularly in the Wenshi tongyi; see Naitō Konan zenshū, vol. 8, p. 368.</p>

Naitō, in fact, requested that Zhang be asked to contribute an essay to a Festschrift dedicated to him; he was asked and complied.</p>
<p>The man who Naitō always claimed, but never it seems wrote down, was the real rediscoverer (or recognizer) of Zhang Xuecheng was Tan Xian (1830–</p>
<p>1901). The recognition of Zhang’s genius appeared in Tan’s diary, the Futang riji</p>
<p>[Futang’s Diary], a work that Naitō not only regarded highly but often firmly</p>
<p>“advised his students to read.” He had obtained a copy of it either at the very end of the Meiji era or at the beginning of the Taishō era (ca. 1912).46 Thus, while Tan was not the source of Naitō’s own interest in Zhang Xuecheng, Naitō</p>
<p>sought to give him the recognition that he felt Tan deserved. We can only guess that Naitō may have initially learned of Zhang Xuecheng from Sun Deqian or Zhang Ertian (or possibly Shen Zengzhi, whom be met in China in 1902), and it is equally possible that they in turn learned of Zhang from Tan Xian, whom it seems Naitō never met.</p>
<p>In 1920 Naitō published in Shinagaku a brief biographical sketch of Zhang Xuecheng, which he prepared from his own copy of the Zhangshi yishu, under the title but without the intent of being a full-fledged nianpu (chronological biography).47 Shortly thereafter, Hu Shi published a much longer, full-fledged 46  Kanda Kiichirō and Mitamura Taisuke, “Sengaku o kataru: Naitō Konan hakase”</p>

Recently, in the mainland journal Lishi yanjiu, a letter from Zhang Binglin to Tan Xian dated 1897 was republished, and it was explained that Zhang considered Tan to be his teacher. The intent of the letter was to attack Kang Youwei and his group of reformers. See “Jindai shi ziliao jieshao: Zhang Taiyan gei Tan Xian de yifeng xin” [Introducing Source Material on Modern History: A Letter from Zhang Taiyan to Tan Xian], Lishi yanjiu 3 (1977), pp. 124–25.

<p>635</p>
<p>nianpu, which, as the great French sinologist Paul Demiéville has remarked, was “a form contrary to all the theories of Zhang Xuecheng.”48 In his introduction to his work, the Zhang Shizhai xiansheng nianpu [Chronological Biography of Mr. Zhang Xuecheng], Hu echoed a by then familiar lament: “What is most shameful for us [Chinese] is that the first scholar to prepare a chronological biography of Zhang Shizhai [Xuecheng] was a foreigner.”49</p>
<p>Hu had intended only to write a kind of corrigendum to Naitō’s 1920 piece, but he claimed to have found so many errors and omissions that he ultimately wrote his own, much more detailed nianpu. Naitō almost immediately wrote a response to Hu, indicating that he was happy to have been the instrument of Hu’s recharged interest in Zhang Xuecheng. Naitō explained that he did not believe in a long nianpu as a viable way to discuss a man’s work and intellectual development but preferred rather a short, simple nianpu, more like a lūli ( rireki, personal resume), to complement a larger investigation of a subject’s ideas. Naitō also pointed out in this response doubtful spots in Hu’s nianpu, important facts missing from both of their efforts, and the vital sources he had discovered since 1920 of writings by Zhang’s friends and acquaintances (principally Wang Zongyan).50 Naitō later provided this promised larger discussion of Zhang in his brilliant essay, “Shō Gakusei no shigaku” [Zhang Xuecheng’s Historiography], written shortly after the response to Hu Shi.</p>
<p>Why Zhang Xuecheng? The Chinese canonization of Zhang Xuecheng by Hu Shi provides material for us to enhance our picture of rediscovery built around Cui Shu. If we trace Naito’s proposed pedigree for the recognition of Zhang Xuecheng’s import back to Tan Xian, then there really is no reason to speak of rediscovery at all in this case, and even less so if the Gong Zizhen connection to Zhang is accurate. Just over a generation separated Zhang’s death from Tan (and Gong’s life overlapped Zhang’s for almost a decade); at best we can say that Zhang’s genius was not recognized by his contemporaries or their immediate successors. Yet, once Hu Shi gleaned the contemporary relevance of Zhang’s ideas, inspired by reading Naitō’s Shinagaku piece, Zhang became 48  Demiéville, “Chang Hsūeh-ch’eng,” p. 177.</p>

<p>(Taipei: Commercial Press, 1968), p. 1. Kang Youwei is often credited with making Zhang known to the Chinese intellectual world; I have been unable to see just where Kang fits into this particular rediscovery effort. As with other Kang endeavors, I suspect it may have been largely a self-professed achievement.</p>

<p>another “significant” but ignored figure who required active resuscitation so that Chinese scholars could be proud of their own heritage.</p>
<p>One puzzling question then is why Zhang and Cui were both used by the Hu Shi group of early Republican scholars in this fashion. The answer is probably simple. The marked differences between Zhang and Cui were topics for specialized research and thus irrelevant to the overall project of revival. In the view of Hu’s group, Zhang and Cui shared the dubious distinction of having been shamefully forgotten and ignored—that they had this in common superseded any philosophical or methodological differences and rendered them source material not for a better approach to the study of history but for election into the pantheon of great Chinese scholars, a pantheon enriched by their belated entrance. Similarly, Hu (and one assumes his students in the early Republic) prided himself on the distance he maintained from political affairs; his “liberalism” surely supported the acceptance for revival of two or more dissimilar men.</p>
<p>Closely related to the case of Zhang Xuecheng is that of Zheng Qiao (1104–</p>
<p>1162), the Song historiographer and author of the Tongzhi [Comprehensive Record]. This writer also was resuscitated in China by Hu and his circle well after having gained renewed attention in Japan through the work of Naitō</p>
<p>Konan, who made Zheng’s ideas central to his own Shina shigaku shi. Zheng had been forgotten soon after his death until Zhang Xuecheng realized the great importance of his conception of the way historical works need be written, i.e., in a comprehensive ( tongshi) fashion, not broken into individual periods ( duandai shi). However, as Zhang was “forgotten,” so, too, Zheng went into his second decline. When Naitō and others began to work on Zhang, Zheng Qiao was “unearthed” in the process.51</p>
<p>51  On Zheng, see Naitō Konan, “Gisaku ichidō” [One Strand of a Draft Idea], written in Kanbun, first published in Shinagaku 6.4 (August 1931), in Naitō Konan zenshū, vol. 14, pp. 78–84; see also Naitō, Shina shigaku shi, in Naitō Konan zenshū, vol. 11, p. 450; Naitō, Shina mokurokugaku, in Naitō Konan zenshū, vol. 12, pp. 407, 411–14, 420, 425, 430–31, 433–34. Also of value is an essay by Naitō’s son that provides information on this rediscovery in China and Japan: Naitō Shigenobu, “Tei Shō no shiron ni tsuite” [On Zheng Qiao’s Historiography], Tōyōshi kenkyū 1.2 (September–October 1936), pp. 1–13.

<hr>
<p><strong>A Different Kind of Rediscovery</strong></p>
<p>One final case illustrates strikingly the degree to which historiographical currents, and ideological currents as well, followed a two-way course between China and Japan. This case, documented by Professor Shimada Kenji, formerly of Kyoto University, is that of the rediscovery by Naitō Konan and others of the late Ming eccentric philosopher Li Zhi (1527–1602). In the Ming section of Naitō’s Shina shigaku shi, initially given as lectures around 1915, the greatest space is reserved for an explication of Li Zhi’s view of history, which is extremely surprising considering that Li was still a virtual unknown in 1915.</p>
<p>In China, Li did not return to the scholarly limelight until Wu Yu’s 1916 essay,</p>
<p>“Ming Li Zhuowu biezhuan” [A Biography of Li Zhuowu (Zhi) of the Ming], was published.52 Even his 1915 reference to Li was not Naitō’s first, however, for in a 1901 article entitled “Dokusho ki sansoku” [Notes on Three Books Read], published in the serial Nihonjin [The Japanese], the third entry is “Ri-shi Sōsho” [Mr. Li’s Cangshu].53 Yet, as Shimada makes clear, Li’s whole rediscovery becomes murky at this point for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>The first actual modern mention of Li in a Chinese publication came in two short pieces in the journal Guocui xuebao [Journal of National Essence], late in 1905.54 Chinese students overseas in Japan, though, undoubtedly knew of Li earlier, because while in Japan many of them had become intimately aware of and reverential toward the great shishi (man of valor) of the late Tokugawa era, Yoshida Shōin (1830–1859). Shōin had been reading Li Zhi’s works in prison shortly before his execution in 1859 and was greatly impressed with Li’s spirit and individuality.55 Li’s suicide also apparently gave Shōin courage to face his 52  Wu Yu, “Ming Li Zhuowu biezhuan,” Jinbu zazhi 9.3–4 (1916), reprinted in Wu Yu wenlü</p>

<p>own imminent decapitation. In turn, so impressed was Liang Qichao with stories he heard of the sacrifice and bravery of Japanese shishi, he took the Japanese name Yoshida Shin—from Shōin and Takasugi Shinsaku (1839–1867), a prominent disciple of Shōin’s, respectively—when in Japan in 1898 to escape execution after the failure of the Hundred Days Reform.56</p>
<p>The Japanese scholar and political activist Miyake Setsurei (1860–1945) once employed Naitō as his assistant, and the latter had in fact ghostwritten several of Miyake’s most famous works, including Shinzenbi Nihonjin [Truth, Goodness, Beauty—the Japanese]. In Miyake’s 1893 book, Ō Yōmei [Wang Yangming], there is an epilogue by Miyake’s colleague, Kuga Katsunan (1856–1907), lauding Li Zhi. The influence of Wang Yangming and his school on the Meiji Restoration shishi is well known. In this epilogue, Kuga pointed out that Li Zhi (himself a follower of Wang Yangming) was deeply revered by Yoshida Shōin, and with this Kuga presented the very first Meiji period writing honoring Li Zhi—three years later Chinese students first came to study in Japan and twelve years later the Guocui xuebao articles appeared. Shimada suggests strongly that Naitō</p>
<p>Konan’s 1901 article in Nihonjin was seen by Chinese students overseas in Japan and triggered Li’s revival; as evidence he cites the notice in the inaugural issue of Guocui xuebao, which states that the editors were in touch with the “journal of Miyake Yūjirō [Setsurei] and Shiga Shigetaka,”57 none other than Nihonjin.</p>

<p><strong>Concluding Remarks</strong></p>
<p>It should be clear that, short of a Dunhuang, “rediscovery” as used by historians in the past has various connotations in various settings. Perhaps zai faxian and sai hakken are misnomers; they are certainly misleading if taken literally.</p>
<p>The actual linkages by which a great figure from the past is brought back to the fore seem to rely to a considerable extent on the politics, concerns, biases, and changing interests of contemporary scholars as well as the exigencies of the times in which the latter live; this ultimately may be more revealing to us as historians than the rediscovered person or persons. We have seen how the revival project in the hands of Hu Shi and his colleagues virtually provided us with our present curriculum for the study of modern Chinese intellectual Columbia University Press, 1976), p. 817; and Shimada Kenji, “Ri Shi” [Li Zhi], in Ajia rekishi jiten, vol. 9, pp. 211–12.</p>

<p>history. One would like to know why, for example, the cluster of eighteenth-century figures we read about is always the same. Why do we always talk about Zhang Xuecheng and Dai Zhen (1724–1777), who was also popular with the Hu Shi group, and not Qian Daxin (1728–1804), Zhao Yi (1727–1814), Zhu Yun (1729–1781), Shao Jinhan (1743–1796), or Wang Mingsheng (1722–1798)? Largely responsible for this, I believe, is the work of Liang Qichao (and Kang Youwei before him), Hu Shi, the early Gu Jiegang, Qian Mu, William Hung, and a handful of other towering intellects who in the late Qing and early Republican eras did an enormous service to our field in bringing into popular focus a number of men largely forgotten or ignored by earlier generations of Chinese. As scholars, however, it is our responsibility not merely to accept this legacy, but to examine it vigorously and criticize its flaws.</p>
<p>It is especially interesting to note the style of reintroduction by which the principals of this essay re-emerged on the twentieth-century scholarly agenda.</p>
<p>In Japan, where these men first were rediscovered for the most part, the intended audience was limited to academic circles. Neither was there concern to popularize these men’s work nor, more significantly, can we detect any signs of defensiveness or nationalistic pride. Of course, the rediscovered figures were Chinese, but not even in the case of Naitō’s work on Tominaga do we see a massive sales campaign touting the newly found figure.58 At least, this reveals the greater sense of self-assuredness on the part of Japanese scholars, which in turn was a reflection of the comparative firmness of China’s and Japan’s respective international positions in the early twentieth century. It is clear that Hu Shi and his group were, however unconsciously, using scholarship in an attempt to bolster China’s national self-esteem.</p>
<p>As I hope I have shown, these scholars were, like everyone else, products of their age, and their concerns reflect that age, just as this author’s concerns reflect our own irreverent times. It should not be surprising that Zhang Xuecheng and Li Zhi continue to fascinate contemporary students of history and philosophy in the West, whereas Cui Shu seems to have gone into a second eclipse. We live in a time when a probing philosophy of history (Zhang) and a lifestyle reflecting a nonconformist philosophy (Li) are far more popular than textual exegeses shallowly (in a philosophical sense) informed only by classical Confucian truth.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best heuristic device for understanding the idea of rediscovery may be found in E.H. Carr’s paradigm for election into the realm of “historical facts”: An event must first be nominated by one historian, seconded by another, 58  Naitō Konan comes closest to this in his Kinsei bungaku shiron and in his essay “Ōsaka no ichi ijin,” cited above.</p>
<p>640</p>
<p>On the “Rediscovery” of the Chinese Past</p>
<p>and then after several votes are cast in its favor by other historians, it can be deemed properly “historical fact.”59 However, this model only describes the act of rediscovery without any indication of causation. Here Benedetto Croce’s observations of over a generation ago on historical judgments can be of service: One always draws on present experience and needs, and in so doing, one lends any period (or personality) under study the character of “contemporary history.”60 In the final analysis, what is history as we know it other than historiography?</p>
