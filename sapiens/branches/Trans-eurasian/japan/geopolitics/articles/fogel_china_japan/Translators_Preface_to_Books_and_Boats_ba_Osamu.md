Ōba Osamu was born in Kyoto in 1927. Three months later his family moved to Osaka, where he grew up. Virtually his entire academic life has been tied to the Kansai region, which generally refers to that area in central Japan encompassing Kyoto, Osaka, and Kobe. He received both undergraduate and graduate training in East Asian history at Ryūkoku University in Kyoto.1 After serving in several teaching positions in the 1950s, he moved to Kansai University in Osaka, where he taught for most of his career. Retiring in 1997, Ōba followed the Japanese practice of teaching elsewhere in post-retirement, in this case, at Kōgakkan University in Mie Prefecture.2 There, he served as its president until his death in 2002. During his distinguished career, he lectured at countless venues around the world, and he was a visiting professor at numerous Chinese universities as well as at Princeton University in the United States. 

Ōba would readily admit that he was not the first scholar to examine Qing-dynasty \(1644–1912\) cultural relations with Japan of the Edo \(Tokugawa\) period \(1600–1867\), but he was without a doubt the most active. After publishing his magisterial *Edo jidai ni okeru Tōsen mochiwatarisho no kenkyū* \(A study of books imported \[to Japan\] on Chinese ships in the Edo period\) in 1967,3 

he spent decades producing highly specialized, detailed works that served as the groundwork for books aimed at a more general audience, such as *Edo* *jidai no Nit-Chū hiwa* \(Chinese relations with Japan in the Edo period\), which is translated here, and *Tokugawa Yoshimune to Kōkitei* \(Tokugawa Yoshimune and the Kangxi emperor\).4 His studies on pre-Tokugawa Sino-Japanese relations include *Shin Gi Waō* \(The ruler of Wa who submits to the Wei\), *Kodai-chūsei ni okeru Nit-Chū kankei shi no kenkyū* \(Studies in ancient and medieval Sino-Japanese relations\), and *Kanseki yunyū no bunku shi: Shōtoku Taishi kara* *Yoshimune e* \(A cultural history of the importation of Chinese texts, from 1  This university is affiliated with the Nishi Honganji True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism.

Prince Shōtoku to Yoshimune\).5 Ōba also strove to republish rare books in Japanese and Chinese dating from the Edo period, which has been a huge boon to scholars in this field.6 Yet one of his greatest contributions has been to train extraordinary young scholars, such as Matsuura Akira and Tao Demin to name just two, whose work he fostered for four decades. 

Ōba also built a parallel career in another field, where he was among the world’s most outstanding and productive scholars—that of unearthing, deciphering, and explicating Chinese wooden strips dating from the Han \(206 bce–

220 ce\) and later dynasties. His many writings in this field include: *Mokkan* \(Wood strips\), *Mokkan: Kodai kara no messeeji* \(Wood strips, messages from antiquity\), *Kankan kenkyū* \(Studies of Han wood strips\), *Shin-Kan teikoku no* *iyō* \(The glory of the Qin-Han empires\), and *Shin-Kan hōsei shi kenkyū* \(Studies in the history of Qin-Han Law\).7 In addition, two volumes of his uncollected essays were published to coincide with his retirement in 1997: *Shōwa gannen* *umaretachi* \(Those born in 1925\) and *Zō to hō to* \(Elephants and Laws\).8 A volume of his posthumously collected essays was published in 2007 under the title *Kigire ni nokotta moji: * Ōba *Osamu ikōshū* \(Writings left on pieces of wood: A collection of Ōba Osamu’s posthumous manuscripts\).9

Translator’s Preface to *books and boats* 79

The volume translated here, Ōba’s only book thus far to appear in English, contains a certain degree of his personal reminiscences.10 He unpretentiously describes decades of labor to unearth so many of the sources now deemed basic in this area of scholarship. In his first chapter, the most autobiographical, Ōba describes his principal scholarly premise: only after debunking commonsensical historical knowledge can true historical study begin. To give one example, he takes pains to demonstrate that, despite all received wisdom about the centrality of the Dutch to Nagasaki in the Edo period, that city’s actual cosmopolitan flavor derived overwhelmingly from the Chinese and their cultural imports. Perhaps this point is more important for Japanese readers, some of whom tend to glamorize the West and slight things Asian, but it is also important for us to bear in mind. 

Ōba, however, goes a step further. He contends that the cultural and intellectual bases for Japan’s modernization in the Meiji era \(1868–1912\) lay in 

“Kangaku” or “Chinese Learning” as it developed in the Tokugawa period. 

This point may seem nonsensical given the universal assumption that Tokugawa Western Learning \(Yōgaku\) had been the key, since “modernization” 

would seem to be synonymous with rapid and far-reaching Westernization. 

According to Ōba, however, this “commonsensical” but fallacious viewpoint results from the lack of historical perspective. He asks: How did Japanese of the late-Tokugawa and early-Meiji eras learn about the West? In fact, with certain exceptions, their major texts on Western affairs were classical Chinese texts \( *Kanbun*\), often translations of Western books made by European missionaries together with their Qing collaborators. Ōba’s attention to this central importance of classical Chinese texts was the crowning achievement of his career, and it has earned him extraordinary praise from both Japanese and Chinese historians. 

10  Several of his books have appeared in Chinese translation, such as *Jianghu shidai* *Zhongguo dianji liubo Riben zhi yanjiu* \(Studies of the transmission to Japan of classical Chinese texts in the Edo period\), trans. Qi Ylnping, Wang Yong, and Wang Baoping \(Hangzhou: Hangzhou daxue chubanshe, 1998\), which originally appeared as *Edo jidai ni* *okeru Chūgoku bunka juyō no kenkyū* \(Studies of the reception of Chinese culture in the Edo period\) \(Kyoto: Dōhōsha, 1984\); and *Qin Han fazhi shi yanjiu* \(Studies in the history of Qin-Han law\) trans. Lin Jianming et al. \(Shanghai: Shanghai renmin chubanshe, 1991\), a translation of *Shin Kan hōsei shi kenkyū. *

Translator’s Preface to *books and boats*

Some Chinese scholars, a minority, have not been as approving of Sino-Japanese contacts in the Edo period. They are outspokenly critical of Japan’s efforts to cut itself off from China and the rest of the world; indeed, this minority on occasion seem to resent this presumed attempt by Tokugawa Japanese to reject China’s great cultural gifts. Ōba offers a different approach, unencumbered by nationalism. He recognizes that both Japan and China imposed severe restrictions on contact with the outside world, interestingly for similar reasons: to create domestic security. But, he sees private parties on both sides striving to maximize contacts with the other side. Japanese consumers craved any and all things Chinese—books, plants, foodstuffs, medicines, lacquer and other art ware, even elephants. And, Chinese traders and ship captains sought out this business in Nagasaki. No restriction on either side was so strict that its enforcement could not be circumvented. In the chapters that follow, readers will discover a field with considerable depth and sophistication of research that Western historians have long yearned to enter. Perhaps the appearance of Ōba’s book in English translation will encourage young scholars outside of Japan to move in this direction. 

It behooves me to acknowledge the assistance of several colleagues at this point. Perhaps the great bane of working in this field is the many different and difficult languages one must master: classical and modern Chinese as well as literary, epistolary, and modern Japanese. The premodern epistolary style, *sōrōbun*, is the Achilles heel for many scholars raised in the postwar era, both Japanese and Western alike. I was fortunate to have two colleagues at the University of California, Santa Barbara who have mastered that linguistic dev-ilry well, Luke Roberts and Haruko Iwasaki. Luke was especially generous in helping me decipher numerous lines of text. On those few occasions when the text got the better of us both, Haruko stepped in and usually unlocked the mystery. In many instances, the only person who could really help was Professor Ōba himself. To my long list of queries, he invariably faxed a response within twenty-four hours. In addition, I would like to thank my colleague at York University, Bob T. Wakabayashi, himself a friend of Ōba’s from their Princeton days, who helped me reconceptualize how this work might be best organized in English. All * * errors of translation, however, are my own. 

A note on this translation. I have reorganized the chapters of Ōba’s text slightly, so that all the materials concerned with the book traffic appear in Part 1, and all those other materials concerning interpersonal interactions between Chinese and Japanese appear in Part 2. This involved placing the final chapter of the original several chapters earlier. Otherwise, the translation follows the original.
