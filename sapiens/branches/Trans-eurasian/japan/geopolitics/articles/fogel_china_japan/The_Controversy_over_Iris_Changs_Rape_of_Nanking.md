title = "The Controversy over Iris Chang’s Rape of Nanking"

+++

In 1997 when Iris Chang, an independent journalist, published her book on the Nanjing Massacre of 1937–38, many people felt that an important story from World War II in East Asia would now be told for the first time in English. 

That is, until they actually read the book. 

The book, entitled The Rape of Nanking: The Forgotten Holocaust of World War II \(New York: Basic Books\), appeared with gushing proclamations on the back cover from an assortment of China scholars and journalists \(Frederic Wakeman, Beatrice Bartlett, and Ross Terrill among them\) lauding the merits of the book and carried a preface by a Harvard University professor of modern Chinese history \(William Kirby\). The early reviews in such esteemed places as the New York Times  continued to gush praise. Yet, anyone who has ever studied modern Sino-Japanese relations should be able to clearly discern that the book is grievously flawed in many ways. And, sadly, it plays right into the hands of the right-wing extremists in Japan who still deny or strongly downplay the massacre itself. 

In her opening chapters Chang attempts to depict the entire history of Japan up to the point of the massacre, and she ultimately reduces it all to bushidō leading to mass murder in the twentieth century. The fact, for instance, that only a tiny fraction of the population was of the samurai class does not enter into her calculations. There are numerous other errors of fact and interpretation in this introduction. The most irritating quirk of this section of the book, though, is Chang’s relentless psychologizing of “the Japanese,” despite her statement that she would offer no “commentary on the Japanese character or on the genetic makeup of a people who would commit such acts” \(p. 13\). Nevertheless, she relentlessly does comment on the “Japanese psyche,” without questioning if such a thing actually ever existed. 

The main body of Chang’s book is divided into three parts: the Japanese assault on the city, the mass murders and rapes; the efforts of the International Committee for the Nanjing Safety Zone to protect Chinese residents; and what she dubs a “second rape” by which postwar Japanese allegedly have been attempting to ignore or cover up the massacres of 1937–38. Her description of the Japanese attack on Nanjing, although occasionally blemished by wild or inaccurate claims, is generally good. Professor Hata Ikuhiko has already pointed out a number of inaccuracies in his essay in Japan Echo \(“Nanking

Atrocities: Fact and Fable,” vol. 25, no. 4 \[August 1998\]\). There is no point in repeating his critique, except to say that, while I am not sure if I agree completely with his understanding of the Nanjing Massacre, virtually all his points are well taken. 

Chang believes wholeheartedly that the Japanese military developed a master plan for the murder of tens of thousands of Chinese civilians and prisoners of war in and around Nanjing when it realized that it could not feed them all during a long military confrontation. A statement like that would, it seems to me, require a great deal of proof. To indict any group of mass butchery of this sort demands the highest standards of historical analysis and scrutiny. Chang’s evidence is paltry, based on a discredited source: David Bergamini’s Japan’s Imperial Conspiracy: How Emperor Hirohito Led Japan into War Against the West \(New York: Morrow, 1971\). There is evidence of organized executions of POW s, though not on the scale claimed by Chang. The same is true for her argument about victims of gang rape in the city. I will not get into the question of numbers murdered and raped, but Chang spends much time establishing an extraordinarily high figure, again with little evidence. Furthermore, Hata Ikuhiko and other Japanese scholars have recently discovered that many of the photographs that appear in her book are either fabrications or misconstructions. 

The Chinese in this book are all depicted as victims, people without agency; the Japanese are depicted solely as aggressors. As she adds a work to the growing body of victim studies, Chang never asks some of the most serious questions of all: How could so many hundreds of thousands of people have been slaughtered by so many fewer Japanese troops? This is by no means to blame the victims for what happened to them, but just to try to understand what transpired in Nanjing. While Chang offers third-rate pop psychology to analyze 

“the Japanese,” she is curiously silent on “the Chinese.”

**Comparative Victimology**

To me, the most offensive argument in the book is her claim that the Nanjing Massacre was a “forgotten holocaust,” even worse than Hitler’s war against the Jews of Europe in the 1930s and 1940s. She employs a peculiar mathematics to come to this conclusion, but this is not scholarship. It is not informed by any of the massive scholarship in European languages on the Holocaust or comparative genocide; it is pure emotionalism on the part of Ms. Chang. For example, how can we compare the situation in which Jews were murdered en masse in countries in which they were a tiny minority to China, where the Chinese were always in the vast majority vis-à-vis the Japanese aggressors? 

396

The Controversy over Iris Chang’s Rape of Nanking

I see this book and similarly articulated points of view as indications of a new voice of diaspora Chinese attempting to stake a place for themselves in the cultural melting pot of, especially, the United States. Unfortunately, identity politics in America has of late taken the comparative victimology approach—

namely, if you and your group have a great massacre in your past, then you have a right to speak, and no one can deny you this right. This, I would suggest, is the reason Chang’s book was met with such acclaim by people who should have known better—they were simply afraid to say otherwise. After I published a short, negative review of The Rape of Nanking in the Journal of Asian Studies \(vol. 57, no. 3 \(August 1998\]\), I received numerous letters and e-mail messages from scholars and graduate students praising my review and the courage it took to write it, none of whom had had the nerve to say so in public. 

By her own admission, Chang relied on numerous others to do her foreign-language research. As it turns out, this includes Chinese materials. No serious historian would ever operate in such a manner. Chang, though, is not a historian, but a journalist. Does this get her off the hook? Some would argue that people writing for a popular market—as opposed to professional historians—

do not have the same responsibility with respect to sources and footnotes and foreign-language documents. I find this argument specious. We can all disagree on what constitutes truth and agree that there may be no hard and fast 

“objective truth.” Perhaps because she is just a journalist, Chang should not be faulted for her ignorance of so much of the writing about the very topic of her book. Still, making obvious claims contrary to what is observable and verifiable is not just wrong but perversely so. 

One of the major claims that Chang makes that is patently false is that postwar Japanese continue to hide from their past and continue to lie about it. She even goes so far as to claim that research in Japan on the Nanjing Massacre can be “career-threatening, and even life-threatening” \(p. 12\). Such a statement reveals an astounding level of ignorance, especially inasmuch as she interviewed Ienaga Saburō for her book. Still, she claims that “the Japanese as a nation are still trying to bury the victims of Nanking—not under the soil, as in 1937, but into historical oblivion” \(p. 220\). Such a crude and dissembling statement does an enormous disservice to the Japanese scholars who, for the past three decades, have been the leading scholars in the world in researching every aspect of the Japanese war in China. It is certainly no crime not to know the Japanese language, but to make such blanket statements despite this ignorance is slanderous. To be sure, there are people in Japan who continue to belittle or downplay the Nanjing Massacre and other aspects of Japanese aggression in China, just as there are crackpots—some evil and others just fools—in the West who deny the existence of the ovens at Auschwitz. There are laws against 

The Controversy over Iris Chang’s Rape of Nanking 397

such writings in Germany, but elsewhere in the West we tolerate the fringe elements, because living in a democracy demands that we do. The same is true of Japan. Would that China had such problems\! 

****

**A Sad Day in American Scholarship**

How has Chang’s book been received by the print media in the United States? 

As I noted earlier, the New York Times  carried a laudatory review by Orville Schell, dean of the graduate school of journalism at the University of California, Berkeley. That a journalist was asked to review a work of history is an inexplicable, though common, practice of the American press; perhaps because Chang is herself a self-proclaimed journalist, the New York Times opted for another journalist to write the review. In any event, it was a case of the blind leading the blind. Schell’s review appeared on December 14, 1997, and basically did not review the book. He merely repeated the arguments of the book, implicitly and explicitly agreeing with them all. It was a sad day in American scholarship. 

Other reviewers effectively followed suit. There was a critical review in the Wall Street Journal, although the criticism mainly surrounded Chang’s equating the Nanjing Massacre with the Holocaust. 

News of the troubles surrounding publication of the Japanese translation of Chang’s book filtered into the American press as well, but with numerous errors of fact. An article in the New York Times on May 20, 1999, “History’s Shadow Foils Nanking Chronicle” by Doreen Carvajal, repeated Chang’s unsubstantiated claims that the publishing house Kashiwa Shobō was bending to pressure from “right-wing Japanese organizations.” Carvajal quoted Chang as saying: 

“I think it is safe to assume that they \[the people at Kashiwa Shobō\] were cracking under pressure from ultranationalist groups. . . . Denial is an integral part of atrocity, and it’s a natural part after a society has committed genocide. 

First you kill, and then the memory of killing is killed.” In the first part of her statement, Chang at least admits that she was “assuming” this conclusion—

which allows her to offer no proof. The second part of this statement continues the line of her book—now claiming “genocide” despite the fact that what transpired in Nanjing falls far short of the standard definitions of genocide, including that of the United Nations. 

Carvajal went on to state that “Japan has historically been reluctant to take responsibility for wartime atrocities.” It is true, I would argue, that some Japanese have attempted to avoid responsibility on behalf of their country, but that falls far short of evidence to indict an entire country, as the quotation would seem to imply. The article concludes with a quote from Chang: “I want 

398

The Controversy over Iris Chang’s Rape of Nanking

the Japanese people to know the truth of the Rape of Nanking. I want them to know a side of history that isn’t properly taught in school. Like it or not, this is a part of their history.” This citation reveals another aspect of Chang’s ignorance of Japan: her belief that Japanese textbooks ignore Japanese aggression in World War II and the Rape of Nanjing in particular. Americans have been led to believe, since the textbook incident of the early 1980s, that all Japanese textbooks have been edited to skip over the war years and whitewash Japan’s role in the war. Of course, this is ludicrous and Chang should be ashamed of herself for perpetrating such a myth. 

I and a number of other scholars wrote a letter to the editor of the New York Times in which we protested such a misconstrued presentation of the facts, but they chose not to publish it. Several weeks after the New York Times article appeared, a much more balanced piece appeared in the Los Angeles Times \(Sonni Efron, “War Again Is Raging over Japan’s Role in ‘Nanking,’” June 6, 1999\). 

Here the entire story of Chang’s squabble with Kashiwa Shobō is laid out with much greater attention to the facts. To check the claim by Chang and others that Japanese have written little about Japanese atrocities committed during the war, the reporter went to the National Diet Library in Tokyo and discovered 42 books about the Nanjing Massacre alone. The reporter also pointed out that right-wing critics in Japan have been using the numerous errors in Chang’s book to discredit all discussion of the Nanjing Massacre. This development could be disastrous to the many serious scholars in Japan who have labored long and hard to bring this massacre to the forefront of Japanese national consciousness. Indeed, one right-wing website apparently is filled with attacks on Chang’s book and is quoted as saying: “Even after this, can you still say there was a Nanjing massacre?” 

The Iris Chang affair will pass, and scholars in China, Japan, Taiwan, the United States, and elsewhere will continue to study the Nanjing Massacre and related events during World War II. Unfortunately, our impact on the general public will never approach Chang’s. While no serious scholar of modern Chinese or Japanese history accepts its findings, her book has already sold hundreds of thousands of copies. When Oliver Stone’s movie JFK appeared several years ago, it was met with a barrage of criticism for his bizarre conspiracy theories. As a historian my biggest worry was that younger students, who had not lived through the events depicted in the film, would not bother to read about the assassination of John F. Kennedy but would simply go see the movie, be entertained, and accept Stone’s weird rendition of the story. Let us hope that this will not happen with Iris Chang’s book. 

A Japanese translation of this article was published in  Sekai, November 1999.

**The Nanjing Massacre in History **

More than sixty years have passea since the series of historical events now called the Nanjing Massacre \(also known as the Nanjing Atrocity and the Rape of Nanjing\). Although historians have analyzed from every conceivable angle other aspects of World War II ranging from the Manchurian Incident of September 18, 1931—now considered the beginning of the war in the Asian theater—to the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, this literature pales in comparison with that focused recently on what happened in Nanjing in 1937–38. There are journals and now a liost of Worldwide Web sites devoted solely to the Nanjing Massacre and associated Japanese atrocities committed in East Asia during World War II, and Iris Chang’s recently published book. The Rape of Nanking, has enjoyed astounding sales. At no time dining the six decades since the event have tempers been more inflamed or research on this subject more intense than now. The Massacre and related events must be lifted beyond the popular level, however, to be studied with greater nuance and in consultation with a wider range of sources. 

How could such a horrific event lie quietly for so long and only in the past few years explode with such force? How did the Nanjing Massacre become a metonym for Japanese behavior in China over the entire half century before the end of the war? Indeed, how has the Nanjing Massacre become so profoundly entwined with—even emblematic of—contemporary Chinese identity, as Ian Buruma has suggested it has?1

Until recently the atrocities that took place in Nanjing in 1937–38 have not been accorded the importance or status they warrant in modem history, except by scholars. Certainly, this has increasingly become the perception of many Chinese, especially in the diaspora. This lack of attention to the Massacre has been partly attributable to the pride and determined self-reliance of the government in Beijing. The post-World War II world witnessed an extraordinary efflorescence of nationalism throughout East and Southeast Asia, and a concomitant unwillingness to play the victim any longer. After the collapse of the Sino-Soviet alliance the Chinese Communist regime assiduously rejected foreign aid or assistance of any kind, even in the face of a starving population and natural disasters \(such as the Tangshan earthquake\) of historically 1  Buruma, “The Afterlife of Anne Frank,” p. 7.

unprecedented proportions. Postwar East Asia’s newly developed self-esteem has militated against countries, blaming others for their own failings. Thus, although the Chinese regime made the Japanese jump through any number of political hoops to reestablish diplomatic and trade relations, it did not demand reparations for the devastation that the Japanese had wrought during the war. 

The denial by certain Japanese of the Nanjing Massacre over roughly the past two decades has contributed to a recrudescence of Chinese anger primarily at Japan but also at the Chinese regimes for not encouraging research on the subject earlier and exposing it to the world. The Japanese deniers of the atrocities are themselves part of a recent Japanese revival of nationalism that has cleaved to right-wing politics and rejected any foreign role in the articulation of Japanese identity. What actually happened in Nanjing is almost irrelevant in and of itself to these people—all that matters is that Japan’s image not be stained, and therefore the atrocities must be denied. 

With the rift between Taiwan and the People’s Republic after 1949 and with increasing numbers of Chinese living in other Asian countries, the United States, and Canada, the complex issue of Chinese identity has been thrown into question. Unlike other peoples who have been exiled from their homelands and have had to forge an identity within a diaspora, the Chinese have had relatively little experience in this realm until recently. In roughly the past decade the Chinese diaspora has begun to speak in an altogether new voice. Where once it was split between those supporting Taiwan and those supporting the People’s Republic, it now embraces a multiplicity of voices—embracing, for example, Tu Wei-ming’s idea of cultural China, meaning all of those Chinese \(living anywhere\) who contribute to the growth of Chinese culture. The Communists and the Guomindang no longer control the discourse. As the diaspora searches for a distinct voice with which to articulate its distinct identity, it is finding that many issues have been swept under the carpet by both regimes. The Nanjing Massacre has become the most prominent of these. 

The role that the Chinese diaspora has played in attempting to return the Nanjing Massacre to center stage may be attributable to yet another factor. 

One by-product of the modem era has been a kind of cultural deracination. 

Despite its obvious merits, the melting pot has led to the unfortunate result that few of us living in diaspora are well grounded in the sources, languages, and histories of the cultures putatively our own. Many are returning to a search for an identity without the tools necessary to acquire it, often latching onto negative events In their history as elemental to their identity. Many Jews, no longer knowledgeable of their own traditions, languages, and texts as were their grandparents or great-grandparents, who learned them as a matter of course, cling to the state of Israel and the sanctity of the Holocaust as basic to their identity. Similarly, many Chinese in the diaspora with considerably

401

less knowledge of their own traditions and history than their forebears have seized on the Nanjing Massacre as their own. Why choose a negative instance? 

Sadly, there are enough great massacres and atrocities to go around, and such an event committed against a people simply because of who they are endows them with an identity perceived as unassailable and irreproachable; it immediately links all members of an ethnic group in victimhood and ties them to their culture, albeit in a superficial way. 

These and other factors have conspired to turn attention, especially among diaspora Chinese, back to the events of the war, and the atrocities committed by the Japanese in that war have often been wrenched out of context and elevated to untold heights. Of course, the Chinese are not the only people who have done this. Many Jews have done the same with the Nazi Judaicide of the war, as have Armenians with the Turkish massacres of 1915 and African Americans with the long history of slavery and discrimination in the New World. Although magnanimous citizens everywhere have been sympathetic to the pain and suffering of all peoples, only the attempted genocide of the Jews has thus far achieved virtually sacrosanct status. One can deny or downplay the Turkish massacres, as the Turkish government regularly does, and go on with ones life. No one denies slavery, but one can deny that the experience was thoroughly nightmarish from beginning to end, as Dinesh D’Souza has recently attempted to do, without derailing ones career.2 By contrast, deniers of Auschwitz and the other Nazi death camps are immediately and justifiably relegated to pariah status, consigned at best to fringe groups, by all thinking human beings. 

Of all these massive, man-made atrocities, only in the case of the Nanjing Massacre has a whole school—actually, several—developed that completely denies or significantly downplays it. How can this be? How can established Japanese intellectuals in many fields—though, importantly, few if any in Chinese or Japanese history—buy into the idea that the Nanjing Massacre is a phantom, an illusion, even a ruse concocted by the Chinese and their allies to ruin Japan’s reputation? How can such people still defend Japanese mass murders of fifty and sixty years ago as the acts of “Asia’s liberator”? 

Frankly, it boggles the mind. More important, it also demonstrates that each of these mass atrocities of modem times is historically and morally distinctive. Lumping them together may serve some emotional end but it ultimately confuses rather than illuminates history, for this is one case in which comparative history may not serve us well. Asserting uniqueness does not mean that we cannot suggest a typology of such mass atrocities; it just means that we should not collapse them. Underscoring specific contexts in which such 2  D’Souza, The End of Racism: Principles for a Multiracial Society.

The Nanjing Massacre in History

massacres occur contributes much more to the furtherance of our knowledge of the events themselves than does a cataloguing of superficial similarities or a use of borrowed and sensational appellations. 

The three chapters that comprise this volume, each based on years of individual research, serve this end of contextualizing the Nanjing Massacre. The authors and editor presented a panel at the annual meeting of the Association for Asian Studies in March 1997 and then decided to compile the present volume. Each chapter considers a different aspect of the history and historiography of the Nanjing Massacre in China and Japan. Although the following three chapters examine some contemporaneous reports documenting the atrocities themselves, the bulk of the material they analyze dates from the end of World War II and the war crimes trials that ensued. They examine, in the kind of detail we have hitherto not seen in English, the voluminous Chinese and Japanese literature on this momentous event of 1937–38. Each attempts to answer the kinds of questions raised here. 

It is a telling state of affairs historiographically that I must say in this introduction that none of us doubts that a great massacre occurred in and around Nanjing from December 1937 through February 1938. These essays are by no means devoted to disproving the claims of the deniers, however. We take for granted that those claims have been made for an assortment of unsavory political reasons or misguided emotional or nationalistic ones. To grant the existence of such an atrocity, though, only begs the question. Far more important to our purpose here is a consideration of how the Nanjing Massacre has been used both by those who aver and by those who deny it—that is, how it has been appropriated as an ideological tool or for nationalist mobilization. 

In particular, the chapters by Mark Eykholt and Takashi Yoshida confront the Nanjing Massacre in contemporary historiography in order to see the uses to which it has been put. 

We have also refrained from engaging in what I call the “numbers game”—

the practice of estimating and seriously debating the numbers of those killed and those raped in the Nanjing Massacre, in which certain Chinese push the figures higher and higher while certain Japanese do everything within their power to push the figures lower and lower. There are two different logics behind this game. The first is to render the Nanjing Massacre as gruesome an event as ever witnessed in world history and thus gamer international attention and sympathy. In her recent book, for example. Iris Chang explicitly claims that the Nanjing Massacre was even more deadly than the European Holocaust.3 

3  Chang, The Rape of Nanking: The Forgotten Holocaust of World War II. 

The Nanjing Massacre in History

403

The second logic is to normalize the events and portray them as understandable actions given the bloody circumstances of the war then underway, as some Japanese critics have attempted to do, purposefully taming the horrors surrounding the mass murders and offering them no special place in history. 

While those Chinese following the first logic now argue that more than 300,000 

were killed and 80,000 raped, Japanese following the second argue that fewer than 100 were killed and very few raped. The contributors to this volume are all of a mind that a great massacre occurred, and whether 200,000 people were killed or 240,000 does not alter the dimensions of the horror. 

No amount of discussion between the contending parties is likely to bridge this gap. Indeed, on a number of occasions in Japan advocates of these two views have confronted one another, made their respective cases, and uniformly failed to convince their opponents of a single item. In part, this inability to reach consensus results from the different concerns motivating these groups. 

Scholars of modern Chinese and Japanese history irrespective of their political views—virtually all admit that a massacre occurred in the Nanjing area, though they may differ on numbers. Others involved in the debate—be they scholars from other fields or other professionals—seem all but oblivious to what constitutes historical fact. This is not a methodological or philosophical difference but an ideological one. Deniers of the Nanjing Massacre have acquired the strength of numbers to ignore the facts, the photos, and the personal memoirs. Their concern is with Japanese national pride and self-confidence, not with redressing a historical wrong. 

In the final chapter in this volume Daqing Yang offers a more contemplative look at our subject in an effort to identify how we all might come to, if not agreement on what occurred in Nanjing sixty years ago, then at least some sort of consensus on the parameters of the event. I am less sanguine than he, but his reflections \(those, incidentally, of a Chinese from Nanjing\) make for deeply compelling reading. He confronts the difficult issues that only such a controversial and contested event can raise: history and memory, atrocity and amnesia, and the capacities of human beings to transcend nationality in the writing of history. 

The aims of this book are several. We hope to place Chinese and Japanese historiography on the events that transpired in Nanjing into their contemporary settings in China \(and Taiwan\)  and Japan, and to offer a more nuanced view of contemporary agendas. We examine what makes the Nanjing Massacre unique in modem Sino-Japanese \(and world\) history and why it has spawned such debate and emotions. Offering the English-reading public access to the voluminous material that has been published in East Asian languages over the 

404

The Nanjing Massacre in History

past sixty years on this event, this book will serve to elucidate the complexity of details in the events surrounding the Nanjing Massacre as they are becoming better known in the English-speaking world. 

The most important contribution this volume will make, however, will be to lay before its readers the highly complex debates in China and Japan since the war, and to attempt to explain why various schools of thought have come to the fore and why the debate has recently become so ferocious. This requires unpacking “Japan” \(and “China”\), identifying interest groups, ideological points of view, schools of thought, scholarly rifts, personal antagonisms, and political intrusions into scholarship, and dropping facile characterizations based solely on nationality. Far too often, for example, Japanese reluctance fully to admit; the role of the Japanese military in the horrific events on the Mainland during the war has led uninformed critics to blame “the Japanese” for historical amnesia, yet much or the most advanced scholarship in the world on virtually every aspect of the war, atrocities included, comes from Japanese scholars. 

Although there axe many different Japanese constituencies, there remain certain compelling reasons to examine these issues from a national perspective as well. It was the Japanese army that invaded China and perpetrated the Nanjing Massacre, and it was Chinese soldiers and civilians, abandoned by their own army and government, who fell victim to the Japanese military. As a result, to this day Chinese write from the point of view of victims and their descendants; the events are being reclaimed by those distant from them often for reasons of changing identity. Japanese tend either to deny the events in an attempt to preserve a positive legacy for contemporary Japanese, or they write out of a deeply felt sense that Japanese wartime actions, although impossible to exonerate, may somehow be atoned for by detailed scholarship exposing all manner of atrocities including vivisection, use of poison gas, and chemical warfare. At the international level, the issues here have become the stuff of political and diplomatic controversy over the past two decades, exacerbating Sino-Japanese tensions. 

The Chinese and Japanese sides of these issues form the basis, respectively, for the analyses of Mark Eykholt’s and Takashi Yoshida’s chapters in this volume. As they demonstrate, the political and intellectual environments in China and Japan are altogether different, to say nothing of the increasingly vocal role played by members of the Chinese diaspora. 

In attempting to set these issues in a larger historiographical and philosophical context, Daqing Yang raises a number of questions about how a scholar \(or a general reader\) is to come to terms with an event so horrifying that it defies ratiocination. How do we make sense of an event rooted, at least at some level, in insanity? A number of the questions raised in this book are also the concern of

405

Holocaust scholars. Although their writings may offer historiographical guidance or correctives, the Nanjing Massacre is best studied on its own ground in China and Japan in the context of World War II in East Asia. When the atrocities associated with the toponym of Nanjing are situated within the context of the war and the debates about them situated in the historiography of the postwar period, then we will have gone a long way toward placing this massacre in history and historiography.
