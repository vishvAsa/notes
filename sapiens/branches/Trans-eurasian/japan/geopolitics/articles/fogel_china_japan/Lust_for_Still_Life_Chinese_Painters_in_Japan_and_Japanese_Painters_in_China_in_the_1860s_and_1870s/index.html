  <p>In the Edo period (1600–1868), Sino-Japanese cultural contacts were mediated through Nagasaki, to which Chinese ships brought quantities of paintings, books, and everyday objects. Nagasaki was the only city in Japan where foreigners lived; it had a Dutch settlement and a Chinese community, which included a number of important Chinese painters. Japanese artists working in the “Southern School” manner (Nanga), an old tradition rooted in China, frequently traveled to Nagasaki to study with Chinese émigré artists and to learn about China. Only in the early Meiji period (1868–1912)—when Japan opened its doors to the outside world—did Japanese artists begin making the trip to China, at long last able to see the true landscapes of Southern School painting.</p>
<p>The Chinese city that the Japanese saw first was Shanghai, a rapidly growing metropolis.</p>
<p>Early Japanese visitors to Shanghai included artists, scholars, and business-people. In the 1840s, the international community of Shanghai had begun the process of sealing itself off from Chinese jurisdictional scrutiny, and as a result, during the Taiping Rebellion, many Chinese artists and literati from the nearby cultural centers took refuge in Shanghai. The mix of painters and calligraphers, who tended to paint for money, brought into being a “Shanghai School,”</p>
<p>which found a new set of patrons in Shanghai capitalists. The Shanghai artists acquired students from as far away as Japan. Like other educated Japanese, these artists wanted to see what many considered to be the homeland of culture itself in China, and were thrilled to be able to commune spiritually with the landscapes of China. The new buyers of art in Shanghai included business-people from Japan, who were the first patrons to enter the Shanghai art scene from abroad. Many Japanese wished to reach Shanghai, either to study painting with an authentic master or to corner a market, in art or other business.</p>
<p>The Chinese port of Shanghai was opened as a result of British gunboats in the Opium War (1839–42), but it would be two decades following the Treaty of Nanjing (1842) before the first Japanese made the trip to Shanghai in 1862. This was only their second official trip abroad, not counting the handful of fascinating cases of earlier shipwreck victims whose unfortunate peregrinations landed</p>

<p>them in Shanghai for shorter or longer periods of time.1 So long kept from extensive overseas travel, when Japanese began venturing abroad, Shanghai was much closer than it might have seemed, the first foreign port to which the Japanese sailed in their own vessels. Some Japanese came to Shanghai for relatively brief periods of time, others for one or more years, still others stayed for the rest of their lives. Interestingly, painters were prominent among the first Japanese who would take up residence in Shanghai. There were, of course, businessmen as well, most of them shopkeepers but also a smattering of those who opened branches of the large combines back home (Mitsui Bussan was the first), a small handful of officials working at the consulate which opened in the early 1870s, and a few religious missionaries of the New Pure Land sect of Buddhism.</p>
<p>Eventually, the Japanese community of Shanghai would fill out with roughly equal numbers of men and women; with children and schools; shopkeepers, businessmen, teachers, government employees, and the full range of professionals one would find in an expatriate community. While there had been tiny overseas communities of Japanese in China, the Philippines, and elsewhere in Southeast Asia in the premodern and early modern eras, Shanghai was to be the first such community in the modern period. After a few words on the first Japanese to set foot in Shanghai in the modern era, we move to a discussion of the Japanese painters who ventured to Shanghai in the 1860s and set them in the longer history of interactions between Chinese and Japanese painters, especially those of the Chinese painters who found refuge somewhat earlier in Nagasaki. Why did painters—of all people—leave Japan in the first place?</p>
<p>Why did they come to Shanghai? What did that port, deemed a virtual hell on earth by just about every Westerner (and many Japanese) who set foot there, have to offer them?2</p>

And, of course, there was the much earlier history of raids on Shanghai in the spring and summer of 1553 by men deemed in the sources to be “Japanese pirates” ( <em>wakō</em>). Indeed, the five assaults that year by <em>wakō</em> led to the building of a wall around the city in the autumn, a wall which survived until 1912. As Liu Jianhui has argued, it was the <em>wakō</em> who effectively created the walled (Chinese) city of Shanghai.

<p><strong>The Earliest Japanese Visitors to Shanghai</strong></p>
<p>The first official Japanese voyages to China in several centuries were the 1862</p>
<p>voyage of the <em>Senzaimaru</em> and the 1864 voyage of the <em>Kenjunmaru</em>, both to Shanghai.3 Those two missions were charged—by two of the highest officials responsible for foreign affairs in the Edo period, the Nagasaki Magistrate and the Hakodate Magistrate, respectively—with observing commercial conditions in Shanghai, as Japan prepared to open itself up to international trade.</p>
<p>The authorities had learned from Chinese, British, Dutch, and American ships calling at those two recently opened Japanese ports that Shanghai was an immense commercial entrepôt and an invaluable window on the West. A journey of several days to Shanghai enabled one to see the entire West in microcosm and obviated the need to go halfway around the world to Europe or cross the Pacific Ocean to the United States.4 Whatever other agendas the Japanese aboard these two vessels may have had—and they were many and varied—the overall intent of these two early trips was commercial.</p>
<p>Much had happened in Shanghai over the twenty years before the latecomer Japanese arrived there. By 1862, the Western powers had been carving out business empires and semi-private enclaves, dubbed “Concessions,”</p>
<p>for two decades along the Huangpu River. But, all that development was not, in the eyes of all the visitors, necessarily a good thing. As Takasugi Shinsaku (1839–67), the young hothead from Chōshū domain, put it in his 1862 travelogue, “Shanghai may in fact belong to China, but one might as well call it British or French terrain. . . . The Chinese have become servants to the foreigners. Sovereignty may belong to China, but in fact it’s no more than a colony of Great Britain and France.”5</p>
<p>The accounts that remain from these early trips to Shanghai are the work of samurai politically active in their local domains and increasingly on the emerging national stage, as well as of merchants getting a first taste of things to come. For better or worse, they all recognized that significant change was 3  I have written extensively about this topic in <em>The Literature of Travel in the Japanese</em> <em>Rediscovery of China, 1862–1945</em> (Stanford, Calif.: Stanford University Press, 1996), 46–61.</p>

<p>in the offing. Their accounts were not immediately published and circulated back in Japan, some taking many years before they would see print. Thus, their writings did not have an immediate or substantial impact, although many of the men themselves would come to play highly important personal roles in Japanese politics, commerce, and the military over the next few years.</p>
<p>Nagasaki, for two centuries Japan’s only open port, quickly began to recede in importance, both as other ports opened and as Japanese vessels began to venture abroad. The Japanese government assisted private businesses in seeing to it that shipping lanes between the home islands and Shanghai, heretofore monopolized by foreigners, would be shared by Japanese and soon dominated by them. This process transpired over the course of the 1870s and 1880s.6 Even before then, however, Japanese were making their way to Shanghai.</p>
<p>A word on travel, travel restrictions, and the declining capacity of the Japanese government to control travel in the last days of the Tokugawa regime might be helpful at this point. Although a “feudal” regime in many ways, the Tokugawa (or Edo) shogunate was also highly centralized and sought to retain as much control as the technology available to early modern policing institutions would allow. Scholars generally regard this inclination as a reaction to the century of warfare and three decades of unification wars preceding the Tokugawa pacificiation at the turn of the seventeenth century. Japan would henceforth control its own borders, while missionaries and anything associated with Christianity would be interdicted, because missionary activity was blamed in part for those many years of chaos and bloodshed. And contacts with foreigners were also to be tightly restricted. Although domestic travel was itself severely curtailed on the books, there were ways for Japanese to travel, for example, on religious pilgrimages or to see relatives living at a distance.7</p>
<p>Foreign travel after the early decades of the seventeenth century was much more closely observed. Aside from a handful of exceptions, the only Japanese who ventured abroad were the shipwreck victims mentioned above. Similarly, 6  See, for example, Katayama Kunio, “Ryōji hōkoku ni miru Nihon sen no kaigai shinshutsu, Mitsubishi no jidai,” in <em>Nihon ryōji hōkoku no kenkyū</em>, * * ed.

<p>only the Dutch and Chinese were permitted in, and they were only allowed to enter Nagasaki, where even their movements were strictly curtailed—</p>
<p>decidedly no Catholic countries were allowed to sail ships into Japanese ports.</p>
<p>By the 1860s, when the government was becoming increasingly busy snuffing out nascent civil wars and after the United States had forcibly opened several Japanese ports by the end of the previous decade, interest in the Western world had grown dramatically. The only Japanese technically allowed abroad until the regime succumbed in 1867 and 1868 were groups with special authorizations, but as we shall see individuals were able to travel outside the country with a fair degree of impunity.</p>
<p>Sino-Japanese cultural contacts throughout the Tokugawa period continued but took new forms. They were mediated through Nagasaki to which Chinese ships regularly came, frequently bringing quantities of books and other art or everyday objects. The shogun and several important feudal lords often ordered specific items (everything from legal texts to horses and equine physicians) through these merchants-cum-culture brokers, who understood that their ability to continue trading with Japan depended on filling such orders. Sinic culture continued to develop throughout Japan—in literature, scholarship, and the arts—but in the effective absence of Chinese or access to them. This is an immense and fascinating area of research only just coming into its own in the West.</p>
<p>The history of East Asian painting is vast and replete with numerous schools, sects, and subsects. The Japanese artists who ventured to Shanghai and environs from the later 1860s, though, fall into only two discrete schools between which there was little (if any) contact, the Western-style oil painters and the Nanga or “Southern School” painters. The former’s roots were planted in Japan (specifically, Nagasaki) in the eighteenth century by Dutchmen, the only Europeans who had direct contact at that time with Japan; the former were part of an old tradition rooted in China, the latter of more recent vintage.</p>
<p>For all their differences, though, these were the two groups that produced early visitors and migrants to Shanghai.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Western-style Painting</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps contrary to expectation, the Western-style oil painters arrived in Shanghai first. The third officially sanctioned mission to Shanghai—after the <em>Senzaimaru</em> and the <em>Kenjunmaru</em>—was a group of nine Japanese who sailed aboard the British steamship <em>Ganges</em> from Yokohama on 15 February 1867.</p>
<p>On the same day that the <em>Ganges</em> left Yokohama, a French vessel, the <em>Alphée</em>,</p>
<p>138</p>
<p>Lust for Still Life</p>
<p>carrying a large official Japanese delegation, set sail from Yokohama as well.</p>
<p>The latter group was led by Tokugawa Akitake (Minbu, 1853–1910), younger brother of the shogun, set to attend the international exposition in Paris in an official capacity.8 The two ships arrived in Shanghai on the same day at roughly the same time, and as the latter clearly bore men of higher social standing, the men of the <em>Ganges</em> who had planned to take rooms at the famous Astor House Hotel had perforce to spend the night elsewhere.</p>
<p>Among the Japanese aboard the <em>Ganges</em> was one Takahashi Inosuke (1828–</p>
<p>94; later Takahashi Yuichi) who was to become one of the foremost painters of the Meiji period.9 Years before as a youth, Takahashi had come to the attention of his lord, Hotta Masahira (1795–1854) of Sano domain, who strongly encouraged him to pursue his work as an artist and released him from mundane domainal duties to enable him to do so.10 On the day after arriving in Shanghai, Takahashi moved with the entire Japanese group to the large residence of a local businessman and art connoisseur by the name of Wang Renbo (dates unknown), who supported Takahashi’s painting pursuits while the latter resided in Shanghai. He remained in the Chinese port city, taking side trips to Suzhou and elsewhere in the lower Yangzi delta, for roughly ten weeks before returning to Japan. In addition to a diary, he left a number of sketches of the trip to Shanghai, the harbor, and scenes in the city. During this time, Takahashi had extensive contacts with Chinese painters and other literati, attended local Chinese theater, met several Japanese then present in Shanghai (such as the ubiquitous Kishida Ginkō, 1833–1905), and soaked up as much of the local atmosphere as he could.11 However, the impact of this trip on his art, or the movement of art in which he played such an important part, seems to have played little role in his subsequent work. Takahashi’s “Shanghai Diary,” which is preserved in the collection of the Tokyo Art University, includes sketches he made en route to and in the city.</p>
<p>8  For a full treatment of this mission, see Miyanaga Takashi, <em>Purinsu Akitake no Ōshū kikō,</em> <em>Keiō 3 neu Pari banpaku shisetsu</em> (Tokyo: Yamakawa Shuppansha, 2000). The prince’s diary has been edited and annotated in Miyaji Masato, ed., *Tokugawa Akitake bakumatsu tai-Ō *</p>
<p><em>nikki</em> (Tokyo: Yamakawa Shuppansha, 1999). There are mentions made of this trip, though not of the stopover in Shanghai, in Beasley, <em>Japan Encounters the Barbarian</em>, * * 114–17; and Miyoshi, <em>As We Saw Them</em>, * * 175.</p>

Several of his sketches have been reprinted in Tanaka Akira, <em>Nihon no kinsei</em>, vol. 18: <em>Kindai kokka e no shikō</em> (Tokyo: Chūō Kōronsha, 1994).</p>
<p>Lust for Still Life</p>
<p>139</p>
<p>Another painter who would make his name in oils, Yamamoto Hōsui (1850–</p>
<p>1910), initially wanted to study Nanga painting, and to that end he traveled first to Kyoto and then to Yokohama, where he arrived in 1868. Yokohama was certainly no home for traditional Japanese arts, but it was a place where, given the right circumstances, he might be able to catch a steamer for China. For all his efforts, though, the opportunity to make the voyage to Shanghai never materialized. In the most Westernized of Japanese cities, he came across the Westernoriented oil painting of Goseda Yoshimatsu (1855–1915) and was so taken with it that he remained there and entered Goseda’s school.12</p>
<p>In both Takahashi’s and Yamamoto’s cases, Shanghai was not a destination in and of itself. Takahashi was simply taking advantage of an opportunity for fresh inspiration, while Yamamoto viewed Shanghai and elsewhere in the region first and foremost as the places to go to study traditional Nanga painting. Their cases would probably not be so exceptional had they not occurred so early in the history of modern Sino-Japanese contacts in Shanghai. Altogether different was the case of the Nanga painters who made the trip to Shanghai from the late 1860s specifically because it was a center of</p>
<p>“Chinese-style painting.”</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>The Southern School</strong></p>
<p>To tell their stories properly, though, requires some background on the artistic connections between Nagasaki and the mainland, going back to an earlier point in the Edo period. Throughout the period, Nagasaki was the only city in Japan that had a considerable Chinese community, including over time a number of important painters who often acquired Japanese disciples during their years of residence in the southwestern Japanese port. Nanga was just one of many schools of painting in Japan—indeed, there were half a dozen prominent ones in Nagasaki itself. Like the style of painting spread by the Ōbaku sect of Zen Buddhism, many of whose abbots came from China in the early Edo period, Nanga was extremely Sinophilic and closely tied to artistic trends on the mainland. Japanese adherents of Nanga painting often drew inspiration 12  Yamamoto Hōsui, “Yōga kenkyū keireki dan (daiichi),” <em>Bijutsu Shinpō</em> 1, no. 1 (30 March 1902): 3; Aoki Shigeru and Furukawa Hideaki, eds., <em>Yamamoto Hōsui no sekaiten zuroku</em> (Nagoya: Asahi Shinbun Nagoya Honsha Bunka Kikakkyoku Nagoya Kikakubu, 1993), 170; Furukawa Hideo, “Tōzai aitsūjiru yō ni shitai nen’o okoshita Yamamoto Hōsui,” in <em>Yamamoto Hōsui no sekaiten zuroku</em>, * * eds.

<p>140</p>
<p>Lust for Still Life</p>
<p>from Chinese paintings and masters, and a steady stream of the latter flowed into Nagasaki.13</p>
<p>The “southern” in this group’s name had nothing to do with Nagasaki’s geography but came from the origins this group traced to the Southern School of Chan Buddhism of the Tang period (618–906), although its principal antecedents were in the high Ming period (1368–1644). Because, like its sister school in China, it laid such heavy emphasis on the high level of education of painters in related bookish disciplines and in its studied knowledge of the history of painting, it often overlapped with “literati painting” ( <em>bunjinga</em>; Ch: <em>wenrenhua</em>). Many painters in this school spent years, for example, painting pictures of Chinese landscapes they could never have seen—and that no fellow Japanese could have seen—based on the paintings of such titans as Dong Qichang (1555–1636) of the Ming, from centuries earlier.</p>
<p>Among the Chinese painters who came to Nagasaki in the eighteenth century, the first important name was Yi Fujiu (dates unknown) from Wuxing County, Jiangsu. He first arrived in 1720, carrying the trading license of his elder brother, Yi Taoji, who had been ordered by the Nagasaki Magistrate—on behalf of the shogun himself—to bring three horses to Japan; it was literally illegal to export horses from China because of potential military needs, and Yi Fujiu perforce had to escort the animals off his ship in the dead of night for fear other Chinese in Nagasaki might observe him. He was equally important as the merchant responsible for bringing a number of valuable Japanese texts back to China, and despite his virtual anonymity in the annals of Chinese painting (to this day, his dates remain a mystery), he was the progenitor of the trend to introduce literati painting of the Nanga School to Japan. Among the Japanese who were much influenced by him was Ike Taiga (1723–76).14</p>
<p>13  There is an immense literature on Nanga painting. I have consulted the following: Yamanouchi Chōzō, <em>Nihon nanga shi</em> (Tokyo: Riru Shobō, 1981); Umesawa Seiichi, <em>Nihon nanga shi</em> (Tokyo: Tōhō Shoten, 1919); Yoshizawa Chū, <em>Nihon nanga ronkō</em> (Tokyo: Kōdansha, 1977); Yonezawa Yoshiho and Yoshizawa Chū, <em>Nihon no bijutsu</em> 23: <em>Bunjinga</em> (Tokyo: Heibonsha, 1966); Wakita Hidetarō, <em>Nihon kaiga kinsei shi</em> (Ōsaka: Shōbunkan, 1943); Takeda Michitarō, <em>Nihon kindai bijutsu shi</em> (Tokyo: Kondō Shuppansha, 1969); Fujioka Sakutarō. <em>Kinsei kaiga shi</em> (Tokyo rpt.: Perikansha, 1983); Kōno Motoaki, “Edo jidai kaiga no shūketsu to tensei,” in <em>Edo jidai no bijutsu: kaiga, chōkoku, kōgei, kenchiku, sho</em>, * * ed.</p>

<p>Another Chinese to distinguish himself as a painter in Nagasaki was Fei Hanyuan (dates unknown), wh arrived in 1734. He was followed later in the century by his relative Fei Qinghu. Both were landscape painters who, while in Nagasaki, acquired disciples anxious to study with real Chinese. In the Tenmei era (1781–89), Zhang Qiugu made his way to Nagasaki where in 1788</p>
<p>he carried on a famous “brush conversation”—the typical manner by which literate Chinese and Japanese “conversed,” using literary Chinese as their written medium—with the official Japanese interpreter. Fei Qinghu attended this session. As a young man, the well-known Japanese painter Tani Bunchō (1703–</p>
<p>1840) traveled from Edo to study with Zhang. Over the course of the century, as many as one hundred Chinese painters would make their influence felt in Nagasaki, and many of them were Chinese Southern School artists. Despite their impact on the history of Japanese art, though, we do not even have dates for most of these Chinese artists.15</p>
<p>Perhaps most important to our story of Chinese influence on Japanese painting was Jiang Jiapu, a man completely unknown in the history of Chinese art but central to the development of the Nanga school in Japan. Jiang hailed from the Hangzhou area of Zhejiang Province and first came to Nagasaki in 1804, as well as many times thereafter. Although he seems to have passed the first stage of the civil service examinations back home, he ultimately failed or ceased trying, and subsequently devoted himself to painting in a highly serious, orthodox style, while earning his living as a merchant.16 He was especially good at landscapes, and during his extended stays in Japan, he directly influenced a number of artists including such major figures as Hidaka Tetsuō (1790–1871), Kinoshita Itsuun (1799–1866), and Miura Gomon (1808–60), known collectively as the “three Nagasaki Nanga masters.”</p>
<p>When he was Jiang’s student, Hidaka Tetsuō was a monk at Shuntokuji in Nagasaki, founded in 1630 and for two centuries the site at which books brought from China were inspected for violations of the strict regulations on interdicted texts. He would serve for many years as the abbot of Shuntokuji 15  The secondary material on this topic in Japanese is extensive, to say the least, though nothing of substance to my knowledge exists in English. For the aforementioned, I have relied on Shimizu Hiroshi, <em>Gajin Nagai Unpei</em> (Nagasaki: Shinano Kyōiku Shuppanbu, 1981), 31–34; Umesawa, <em>Nihon nanga shi</em>, 860; Yanagi Ryō, <em>Kindai kaiga to bunjinga no chisei: Nagai Unpei no bijutsu</em> (Tokyo: Kotobuki Garō, 1974), 60; and numerous brief entries in the <em>Nihon shi dai jiten</em> (Tokyo: Heibonsha, 1992–94).</p>
<p>16  Yamakawa Takeshi cites a letter by the famed cultural connoisseur and shogunal official who was serving in Nagasaki in 1804, Ōta Nanpo (1749–1823), to the effect that Jiang had turned to painting after failing at the examinations. Yamakawa Takeshi, ed., <em>Nagai Unpei</em> (Nagano: Shinano Mainichi Shinbunsha, 1985), 214.</p>

<p>and nurture numerous young Japanese interested in Nanga painting who traveled to Nagasaki from all over the home islands. For all his efforts, Tetsuō never seems to have excelled as an artist to the extent that several of his contemporaries and disciples would, but he proved to be an extraordinary teacher and facilitator of human contacts.17</p>
<p>The most active painter in Nagasaki at this time appears to have been Kinoshita Itsuun. A native of the city, he was an energetic organizer and painting teacher who ran shows and took in numerous pupils willing to work assiduously at the Nanga style of art. His heart’s desire was to visit the putative homeland of Nanga in China, but that goal always managed to elude him—it being illegal on pain of death to leave Japan throughout most of his life. From his home, Kinoshita reputedly would travel mentally to the mainland by studying two paintings he had acquired: Zhang Qiugu’s *Emeishan yue *( <em>The Moon at</em> *Emei Mountain *[Sichuan]) and Jiang Jiapu’s *Xihu shui yun *( <em>Clouds over West</em> <em>Lake</em> [Hangzhou]).18</p>
<p>Among Kinoshita’s most famous and devoted disciples was Nagai Unpei (1833–99), who came from the town of Nuttari in Echigo domain (present-day Niigata Prefecture). Born in the midst of the Tenpō famine to a father who worked as a barber but spent much of his time drinking and a mother who raised him and his two brothers in dire poverty, Unpei somehow discovered painting early in life. Despite his father’s wishes for him to follow in the family profession, Unpei despised cutting hair. This attitude led to frequent paternal beatings and ultimately to Unpei’s running away from home as a teenager. His uncle placed him in the home of a local doctor who fostered the lad’s interest in calligraphy and taught him the Confucian classics and other Chinese texts. He also found for Unpei a local Nanga-style painter, Makabe Setchō</p>
<p>(dates unknown), who had studied some years before with Tetsuō in Nagasaki.</p>
<p>Makabe opened up a world of calligraphy, painting, and Chinese learning in 17  Chen Zhenlian, <em>Jindai Zhong-Ri huihua jiaoliu shi bijiao yanjiu</em> (Hefei: Anhui Meishu Chubanshe, 2000), 31–32; Kawakita Michiaki, ed., <em>Kindai Nihon bijutsu jiten</em> (Tokyo: Kōdansha, 1989), 294; Suzuki, “Kō Kaho,” in <em>Ajia rekishi jiten</em>, vol. 3 (Tokyo: Heibonsha, 1959), 200; Shimizu, <em>Gajin Nagai Unpei</em>, 37–39; Umesawa, <em>Nihon nanga shi</em>, 871–78; and Yanagi, <em>Kindai kaiga to bunjinga no chisei</em>, 60–61.</p>

In 1861, Tomioka Tessai (1836–1924) arrived in Nagasaki with a letter of introduction from Ōtagaki Rengetsu (1791–1875) to Kinoshita. He claimed he wanted to study the Nanga style of painting imported from China, but he allegedly brought with him a big-city arrogance toward backwoods Nagasaki. Despite five months under Kinoshita’s artistic tutelage, Tessai really was primarily interested in learning about conditions overseas, and they parted without much mutual affection.

<p>Japan to Unpei through connections to the work of the great Edo calligrapher Maki Ryōko (1777–1843), his teacher Kameda Hōsai (or Bōsai, 1752–1826), and others. Through a local priest, Unpei was introduced as well to the work of the artist Kushiro Unsen (1758–1811), who was born in Shimabara, raised in nearby Nagasaki, and studied Chinese learning and language with Chinese residents there.19</p>
<p>At age fifteen, Unpei’s taste for studying Nanga painting directly with masters in Nagasaki was such that he simply decided to set off on the long journey despite the opposition of virtually everyone around him. In 1848, this was a major undertaking for a teenager, especially given the shogunate’s restrictions on domestic travel. Traveling overland, he reached Japan’s sole international port some six months later and went straight away to introduce himself to Tetsuō, who later took him to meet Kinoshita. The latter was immediately taken with Unpei’s seriousness—many people came to study Nanga painting in Nagasaki, but few of them showed such apparent purpose and fewer still were teenagers. Kinoshita effectively took the youngster under his wing, trained him as a painter and calligrapher, and even offered suggestions for Unpei’s ultimate decision to adopt that particular given name. Through Kinoshita, Unpei also met a number of Chinese painters who had taken refuge from the Taiping Rebellion in Nagasaki.20</p>
<p>Our story now must shift to the mainland. The great Taiping Rebellion was raging through the lower Yangzi provinces during the 1850s and early 1860s.</p>
<p>Earlier, in the 1840s, many Chinese scholars, painters, and other literati from the nearby cultural centers of Hangzhou, Suzhou, Wuxi, and elsewhere—to say nothing of tens of thousands of common folk—had taken refuge during the rebellion in the Concessions in the hope of avoiding the Taiping devastations they had witnessed and heard of in other places. Accordingly, the population of Shanghai swelled to bloated proportions. The art world was affected in several ways. A large number of elite Chinese artists, in an effort to save themselves and escape the Taipings, made their way to Shanghai, and several of them traveled as far as Nagasaki.</p>
<p>19  Kushiro counted among his friends and traveling companions the likes of Rai San’yō</p>
<p>(1780–1832), Uragami Shunkin (1779–1846), Yamamoto Baiitsu (1783–1856), and Kimura Kenkadō (1736–1802), the cream of late-eighteenth-century mainland-oriented scholars and painters.

<p>Two such emigré painters whose names appear repeatedly in the sources, but who have managed to escape virtually every reference work, were Wang Kesan (Daotai; 1822–?) and Xu Yuting (b. 1824). Wang was from Zhejiang Province, and he was hailed in Japan as the greatest Chinese calligrapher to reach Japan since Jiang Jiapu. To this day, his calligraphy appears on the top of a parade float in a local Nagasaki festival in the Kōjiyamachi section of that city. He arrived in Nagasaki in 1862 and had frequent contact there with Unpei, Kinoshita, and others in the Nanga circle of painters, and he offered frequent calligraphic advice to the young artists in the city. About this time, in the spring of 1864, Kinoshita decided that Unpei was ready to go out on his own; he had been living in Nagasaki for sixteen years, but was still apprenticed to Kinoshita and all but unknown. With inspiration from both his teacher and Wang, Unpei had continued to labor, as he saw it, to create an authentic Nanga tradition in Japan that was directly affiliated with the same tradition in China. In the late summer or early fall of 1864, Wang visited Unpei before his return to Shanghai.</p>
<p>They exchanged paintings, and Wang suggested that Unpei consider making the voyage to Shanghai at some point in the near future to further the efflorescence of Nanga exchanges between their two countries.21 As noted above, the Nanga school in Japan had for many years past continued to paint scenery derived from the lower Yangzi region of China, scenery which (of course) did not exist anywhere in Japan and which none of them would have actually seen.</p>
<p>It was as if these mountains and valleys, temples and rural huts were ideal types—in any event, idealized for all East Asian literati painters. The worldview of Nanga was thus decidedly Sinophilic, a worldview of people living in another world altogether.</p>
<p>Xu Yuting, also from Zhejiang, arrived in Nagasaki even earlier, in 1861, and he quickly became active in the local painting community over the next few years. Whereas Wang was a master of calligraphy and plum tree painting, Xu was famed for his ink landscapes. Among the local painting students, Xu took on one Yasoshima Shakyō (1832–1916) and praised his work to the skies.22 By 1867, Xu was also back in China.</p>
<p>In early 1866, Kinoshita decided to make a trip to Edo to visit a brother who lived near the capital. Faithful disciple that he was, Unpei planned to join him, but he became extremely ill and was unable to make the sea voyage from Nagasaki. Kinoshita wrote from Edo to say that, should Unpei recover, he might join him, but Unpei’s illness persisted. Late that summer, the vessel 21  Umesawa, <em>Nihon nanga shi</em>, 867; Shimizu, <em>Gajin Nagai Unpei</em>, 52–55, 56–57; http://yuki–</p>

<p>carrying Kinoshita and over fifty others left the port of Yokohama en route back to Nagasaki and was never seen again.23 All were lost at sea, and Kinoshita died without ever being able to satisfy his lifelong ambition of seeing the real scenery of China.</p>
<p>In early 1865, Unpei made the acquaintance of another young painter in Nagasaki who would be instrumental in convincing him to try to make the trip to Shanghai. Ishikawa Kansen (b. 1844) came from Etchū domain (contemporary Toyama Prefecture), not far from Unpei’s hometown, and despite his youth had, like Unpei and many others, come to Nagasaki to study Nanga painting at Shuntokuji. He was preparing an album and wanted Unpei to contribute the first piece to it. The second piece, he hoped, would be supplied by either Yasuda Rōzan (Mamoru, 1828/1830–1883) or Chūjō Untei (1834–66); about the former, we shall have much to say below, while the latter was sadly to die with Kinoshita, his teacher, whom he accompanied on the ill-fated trip from Yokohama. Unpei and Kansen became fast friends.24 At Kansen’s suggestion, they and others adorned kites with their artwork for the kite-flying festivities in Nagasaki, and they continued to meet periodically and talk about their work. In the spring of the following year, 1866, they shared concerns about all the tumult then occurring—the assault on Shimonoseki the previous year, the Chōshū wars, the Namamugi Incident in which a British man was murdered in Japan, and other events portending big changes.</p>
<p>Unpei admitted to his friend that he wanted, at long last, to see a Jiang Jiapu landscape with the genuine eyes of the founders of Southern School painting, meaning he wanted to go to China. Much more entrepreneurial than Unpei, Kansen too expressed a similar desire, but it was still technically illegal for individuals to do so. They both knew of Yoshida Shōin’s (1830–59) unsuccessful and ultimately fatal effort to stow away on one of Commodore Perry’s vessels bound for the United States in 1854, a story immortalized in the West in 1878</p>
<p>by Robert Louis Stevenson (1850–94). Shōin, though, had wanted to visit the distant barbarian West, while they only wanted to travel a few days away to nearby Shanghai to view landscapes from the greatest culture in the world.</p>

<p>Lust for Still Life</p>
<p>Unpei ultimately came upon the ideal intermediary who would facilitate their voyage. On several occasions he had met a naturalized American missionary born in the Netherlands, Guido Herman Fridolin Verbeck (1830–98), who had come to Nagasaki in late 1859 on behalf of the Dutch Reformed Church. En route to Japan, the ship carrying him and his wife had called at the port of Shanghai where he left his wife within the Western community before heading off to set up shop in Nagasaki, a site at which Westerners (let alone missionaries) had not lived among the Japanese for over two centuries. It was there several years later that Takasugi Shinsaku, waiting several months for the <em>Senzaimaru</em> to be cleared for departure to Shanghai, met Verbeck. Already fluent in Dutch, English, French, and German, Verbeck was keenly interested in acquiring Japanese as quickly as possible to aid in his work. He also developed a keen interest in Nanga style painting and often visited Kinoshita’s school, met with his students, and asked numerous questions. In April 1864, he moved temporarily with his family to Shanghai; his wife had joined him, apparently, in Nagasaki. In Shanghai they escaped the tense atmosphere surrounding all foreigners in Japan as a result of the many anti-foreign incidents and assassinations associated with late-Tokugawa times. He returned to Nagasaki soon thereafter to continue his teaching and missionary work—he counted as his students several of the luminaries of the coming Meiji era: Soejima Taneomi (1828–1905), Itō Hirobumi (1841–1909), Ōkuma Shigenobu (1838–1922), and Yokoi Shōnan (1809–69), among others.25</p>
<p>After Kinoshita’s death, Unpei had lost his anchor in life. He finally decided that the best way he could repay his gratitude toward his late teacher was to see the scenery of the lower Yangzi region with his own eyes. He knew as well that Verbeck had made the voyage between Nagasaki and Shanghai several times and would undoubtedly help them. In the spring of 1867, he visited Verbeck and laid out his secret plan. The American agreed to help, though he continued the discussion by seeking Unpei’s views on Christianity. Unpei pleaded ignorance. Verbeck explained that he had recently spoken at length with Kansen about the Christian faith, and indeed after he returned from their trip to China, Kansen actually converted. When he learned that Unpei had already begun planning a trip to the mainland, Kansen begged him to come along, and soon Yasuda Rōzan made his similar desires known. But, despite the loosening of the shogunate’s severe travel restrictions, it was still technically illegal for them travel as individuals and certainly without the consent of their lords. That was where Verbeck could help.</p>

<p>Verbeck was able to secure passage for them on a foreign trading vessel plying the Nagasaki-Shanghai route. When Unpei became ill and unable to travel shortly before their scheduled departure, Rōzan and Kansen were simply too anxious to wait. They donned queue wigs—all Chinese males during the Manchu Qing dynasty (1644–1912) were required to wear their hair in the queue (pigtail)—and thus disguised themselves for passage as Chinese servants.</p>
<p>Unpei followed them soon thereafter in June 1867, concealing his identity dressed as a Chinese monk, on another trading vessel, the <em>Fei-loong</em> (sometimes rendered <em>Fe-loong</em> in the <em>North-China Herald</em>), arranged by Verbeck.</p>
<p>With the help of a Chinese man he met on board ship and a monk he met in Shanghai soon after arriving, Unpei located his Nagasaki friends, Rōzan and Kansen, at a local inn. The three young men agreed to assume (fairly pretentious) pen names while in Shanghai and environs; the fact that they are never referred to in Chinese sources by these names (and only in Japanese sources to tell this story) leads me to conclude that the names never stuck: Wujiang for Unpei, Wushan for Kansen, and Wushui for Rōzan. The “Wu” element was the name of an ancient state located in the lower Yangzi delta.26</p>
<p>A word about the third member of this party, Yasuda Rōzan, is now in order.</p>
<p>Despite the skimpy and often contradictory details available on him, he is usually accorded the honor of being the most important early Japanese painter to visit the Shanghai area. He was certainly the first Japanese to settle in Shanghai for a considerable length of time. He hailed from a family of samurai doctors from a village near the famous Yōrō Waterfall in Takasu domain, Mino (present-day Gifu Prefecture). In addition to his medical training, Yasuda acquired a consuming interest in calligraphy. He eventually left his hometown and settled in Iida village in nearby Shinano domain (present-day Nagano Prefecture), where he attempted to make a living as a doctor. His next-door neighbor was a salt warehouse owner by the name of Ihara Shigebee, and Yasuda eventually married his neighbor’s daughter Kyū (1847–72), despite the great difference in their social classes. With his medical practice not faring well, he decided to relocate with his wife to Edo, and later they moved on to Nagasaki. There, in the late 1850s or early 1860s, he began studying Nanga painting with Tetsuō</p>

<p>Most sources—all apparently repeating each other—claim that he unilaterally moved to Shanghai in 1864 (a few say 1868), but I have now concluded that 1867 was the date of his departure for the mainland both because of the circumstances described above and because of the contemporaneous diary of Okada Kōsho (1820–1903). Okada was a scholar of Chinese learning who settled in Nagasaki and a medical doctor, as well. In March 1872, he set sail on a two-month trip to Shanghai and Suzhou. “From my youth,” he explains in his account written in literary Chinese, “I have always thought of traveling to China, but the government banned travel, so I could not go [abroad]. I waited for a chance. After the [Meiji] Restoration [of 1868], the ban [on travel] was lifted, and I was able [to do so].”28 Soon after arriving, he visited the recently opened Japanese consulate, introduced himself to Japan’s first consul in China, Shinagawa Tadamichi, and the next day paid a call on Yasuda Rōzan. “I visited him today and met him and his wife together,” Okada reports. “While drinking wine, we happily passed the time as he regaled me with stories from the past. . . . Rōzan has been living in Shanghai for four or five years and speaks Chinese rather well. . . . He pays his expenses with paintings and cailigraphy.</p>
<p>His wife, Hongfeng, is also a painter of orchids and bamboo.”29</p>
<p>In 1870, Yasuda returned briefly to Japan to collect his wife and bring her with him to share his life back in Shanghai. Kyū changed her given name at this time to Ai, and, as indicated by Okada, she became known in her own right as a painter in Shanghai under the name of “Hongfeng nüshi” (Ms. Red Maple Tree). She died there in the summer of 1872 at the tender age of twenty-five and was buried to the west of the Longhua pagoda; her remains were later removed to the Japanese cemetery which had not yet been founded at the time of her *jiten, * 359–60; Okita Hajime, “Shanhai shiwa,” <em>Shanhai Kenkyū</em> 1 (February 1942): 63; Yonezawa Hideo, <em>Shanhai shiwa</em> (Tokyo: Bōbō Shobō, 1942), 90–91; Okita Hajime, <em>Kojō shi</em> <em>dan: Shanhai ni kansuru shiteki zuihitsu</em> (Shanghai: Tairiku Shinpōsha, 1942), 102–3.</p>

<p>death, and the stone inscription was prepared by none other than the great artist and calligrapher Hu Gongshou (Yuan, 1823–86; see below).30</p>
<p>For all their shared desire to see China in the flesh, our three Japanese Nanga travelers had little to do with one another after they arrived in Shanghai. Their collective first impression of Shanghai was that it was infinitely more prosperous than they had ever imagined, but after that they drifted off in their own directions. Rōzan settled in for the better part of a decade, and the record on Kansen’s whereabouts dries up at this point. Unpei had planned a long stay, but that was not to be. Shortly after Unpei’s arrival, he tracked down his Chinese acquaintance from several years earlier in Nagasaki, Wang Kesan. He and Xu Yuting both lived in or near Shanghai, and they saw to Unpei’s every need. Wang introduced him not only to the city of Shanghai, but more importantly to the new Shanghai school of painting which was emerging in the city, and Unpei was decidedly unimpressed. Unpei’s plans were cut short when he became ill and had to return home.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>The Shanghai School and Japan</strong></p>
<p>As the Taiping Rebellion had forced countless artists to take refuge in the relative safety of Shanghai, a new mix of painters and calligraphers in the city brought into being a new “Shanghai School” ( <em>Haipai</em>). A leading figure in this new movement was the aforementioned Hu Gongshou, a Southern School painter with eclectic interests. Yasuda Rōzan began studying with Hu soon after reaching Shanghai, and the two men became good friends. As noted in Okada Kōsho’s diary, Rōzan had “frequent contacts with Hu Gongshou.”31 Hu was born in Jiangsu Province and was renowned in his day as a poet, calligrapher, and artist. He fled to Shanghai in 1861 to avoid the Taipings, and there he eked out a living selling his own artwork, establishing contacts with such painters as Hu Bishan (1817–62), Li Renshu (Shanlan, 1811–82), and Xugu (1823–96).</p>
<p>30  In the Japanese cemetery, Kyū’s gravestone carried the following inscription on its front:</p>
<p>“Grave of Hongfeng nüshi from Japan, inscribed by Hu Gongshou from Huating.” The back reads: “Hongfeng nüshi of Japan was surnamed Ihara, had the given name Ai, and was also known as Teisha. She was the wife of Yasuda Rōzan (Mamoru). She painted orchids and bamboo beautifully. She had a fine hand for calligraphy and was a lovely woman. She came to live with Rōzan in Shanghai in Tongzhi 9 [1870]. She died on the twenty-third day of the seventh lunar month of Tongzhi 11 [1872]. She was twenty-six [ <em>sui</em>]. Rōzan brought the coffin and she was buried on the western side of the Longhua Temple. This was written when the stone was erected” Cited in Yonezawa, <em>Shanhai shiwa</em>, * * 166–67.</p>

<p>Lust for Still Life</p>
<p>Hu later gained great renown, acquiring students from as far away as Japan—</p>
<p>such as Rōzan and others—who wished to study Chinese-style painting from a real Chinese exponent.32</p>
<p>In the world of Chinese painting, the Shanghai School was far from universally respected. Indeed, some used the term <em>Haipai</em> more as an epithet than as an apposite group designation. According to their critics, one of the traits of this school was shoddiness or crudeness. Masaki Naohiko (1862–1940), head of the Tokyo Art School, emphasized this point when he visited Shanghai in 1931</p>
<p>and saw a show at the Shanghai Art School. Four years later, he remarked after seeing a show of Chinese art in Tokyo: ‘They have displayed there the careless paintings of the Shanghai school.”33 Clearly, he considered their work sloppy and crude.</p>
<p>Stressing the positive, James Cahill has argued that the Shanghai School was the “most vibrant movement” in nineteenth- and twentieth-century Chinese painting. It drew its roots from the Yangzhou school of the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>At that earlier time and place, a wealthy and highly cultivated mercantile elite sponsored artists, and their elevated tastes influenced what was painted—if only because they were the ones buying the artists’ works; and while money clearly was the common denominator in this equation, there remained a sense of shared elite cultural values. Perhaps most important was the fact that in the eighteenth century most artists were also officials, their “legitimate” livelihood.</p>
<p>In the mid-nineteenth century, the merchant-artist relationship was replicated in Shanghai, only now the entire relationship was solely based on money.</p>
<p>Artists like Hu Gongshou worked for money and painted what their patrons wanted. “The painter,” writes Cahill, “typically, was not trying so much to inculcate a higher taste in his audience as he was responding to the audience’s taste in his paintings. The result is that much of Shanghai School painting moves further than before into the realm of popular art, to the verge of what in earlier centuries would have been thought low-class or vulgar.”34</p>

<p>As with so many things associated with Shanghai—such as Shanghai dialect and Shanghai cuisine—the Shanghai style in painting was actually an amalgam of trends brought from elsewhere and crushed in the pestle of a city that was growing rapidly from the mid-nineteenth century on. Although the Taipings never penetrated beyond the outskirts of the city, their actions in the nearby towns and villages forever changed the appearance and population of Shanghai. By the early 1860s, there were surely more non-native painters in Shanghai than native ones, and the new Shanghai capitalists were, like their Yangzhou brethren earlier, becoming patrons of the arts. As Stella Yu Lee has noted, unlike earlier artists, Shanghai artists were not officials and, thus having no “real job” to fall back on, painted for money to survive. “Shanghai patronage,” she adds, “differed from that of Yangzhou in being broadened by the introduction of new buyers. Some of the most famous of them were merchants from southern China and tradesmen from Japan.”35</p>
<p>Not only were the Japanese the first painters to come to China to engage in serious study, but they were also the first patrons to enter the Shanghai art scene from abroad, and this may have owed to the shared traditions in painting and calligraphy going back centuries. In the 1884 work, <em>Shenjiang shengjing tu</em> ( <em>Depictions of Famous Shanghai Sights</em>), there is an extraordinary drawing of two Japanese authenticating and purchasing a Chinese scroll in a Shanghai art shop.36 Writing in 1919, the critic Yang Yi (1864–1929) similarly noted of one calligrapher: “Xu Fangzeng . . . from Pinghu lived in Shanghai in the early years of the Tongzhi period [1862–75]. He excelled in the archaic script and copied Han tomb inscriptions. . . . Japanese profoundly appreciated his calligraphy, buying and returning home with many of his works.”37</p>

Stella Yu Lee (“The Art Patronage of Shanghai in the Nineteenth Century,” 226) cites another source, *Shanghai fengtu zaji *( <em>Collected notes of the ways of Shanghai</em>), which I have not as yet seen, to the following effect: “Most people in the country of Japan were fond of calligraphy, paintings, seals, and stone engravings. In gentry-official families, not only were the collections of those art works rich, but the people were able to distinguish authentic works from fakes, and good works from bad ones. If they discovered something they liked, although it was only a small piece of rock or a few inches of silk, they would spend a thousand gold coins to buy it without a second thought.”</p>

<p>Lust for Still Life</p>
<p>Thus, Chinese artists fleeing the Taipings and later just beginning to make a living from their art came to Shanghai because they had learned that it was China’s most important commercial city and that one might survive by painting alone. For the same reason, Japanese wished to reach Shanghai, either to study painting with an authentic master or to corner a market. Nothing like this confluence of events had ever transpired in Chinese art history: migration from other cities with major cultural histories to Shanghai, the emergence of a modern Chinese capitalist class, and the arrival of Japanese in the city.</p>
<p>Hu Gongshou became the teacher of a number of Japanese aspiring to learn at a Chinese knee. In addition to Yasuda Rōzan and his wife, these included Murata Kōkoku (1831–1912) from Hakata in Fukuoka domain on the island of Kyūshū. Kōkoku initially studied painting with his father, Murata Tōho; in 1864, he traveled to Kyoto to study with the Confucian scholar and painter Nukina Kaioku (1778–1863). Eight years later he made his way to Nagasaki to study with Tetsuō; he later met Kinoshita and other literati painters, including Xu Yuting.</p>
<p>Kōkoku made three trips to China around 1876, to view the landscape he had so often seen represented in Chinese paintings and to study with Hu and Zhang Zixiang (Xiong, 1803–86).38</p>
<p>One final name in this vein is Amano Hōko (1828–94) from Ehime domain on the island of Shikoku. He was a Nanga landscape painter who traveled to Kyoto to study with Nakabayashi Chikutō (1776–1853). When Chikutō died, he moved on to Nagasaki and studied under Kinoshita. From there Hōko went on to Shanghai, together with another artist from Ehime, Tsuzuki Kunshō (1835–</p>
<p>83), also a Nanga painter, to study with Hu. After a number of trips to Shanghai, he settled back in Kyoto in the mid-1870s and played a major role in the world of literati painting.39</p>
<p>Perhaps underscoring his contacts with Japanese artists as well as his growing fame and fortune, Wang Tao (1828–97), the famed Chinese writer and reformer, included a poem about Hu Gongshou in his *Yingruan zazhi *( <em>Miscellanies by</em> <em>the Ocean</em>), one line of which reads: “A piece [from Hu’s hand] is worth a city 38  Kawakita, <em>Kindai Nihon bijutsu jiten</em>, * * 346; Kōno, “Edo jidai kaiga no shūketsu to tensei,” 150; Umesawa, <em>Nihon nanga shi</em>, 879; Aimi Kōu, “Murata Kōkoku,” in <em>Nihon jinmei dai jiten</em>, ed.</p>

<p>in Japan.”40 This phrase suggests—as was often later suggested about Pablo Picasso (1881–1973)—that anything Hu painted was worth its weight in gold, and he knew it. Incidentally, as was noted at the time, he was—together with the famed courtesan Hu Baoyu and the extraordinarily rich compradore Hu Xueyan (1823–85)—one of the “three Hus” of Shanghai.41</p>
<p>A direct connection between Wang Tao and Yasuda Rōzan has yet to be made, but in light of the fact that Rōzan was the longest-term Japanese student of Hu Gongshou, not to mention the fact that his name appears in contemporary Chinese sources, it is highly likely that Wang at least knew of him.</p>
<p>Dr. Okada stressed how helpful Rōzan was to him, as well as to other Japanese who came to Shanghai for longer or shorter periods of time. This group went far beyond artists, however, and included among others Admiral Kabayama Sukenori (1837–1922), famed as the first Japanese governor general of Taiwan—</p>
<p>serving from 1895, having visited the mainland much earlier. When he arrived in Shanghai in the early 1870s as part of Foreign Minister Soejima’s entourage, he met with Rōzan, and the latter—with his extensive knowledge of the local scene—offered the future admiral his store of information.42 By all accounts, Rōzan left Shanghai and returned home in 1873, the year after his wife’s death.</p>
<p>He settled in Tokyo and was extremely successful as an artist and a teacher.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, Unpei was less than enthralled by the Shanghai school of painting to which Wang Kesan introduced him in 1867. Unpei was more interested in viewing the scenery of the lower Yangzi delta and meeting “pure” Southern School painters. In Suzhou he renewed his acquaintance with Xu Yuting who, knowing the importance of pedigree, introduced him to local painters as a Japanese calligrapher and student of Kinoshita and Tetsuō, himself a student of Jiang Jiapu. In addition to the standard list of cultural sites, Unpei also wanted to visit the sacred Buddhist Mount Tiantai, but Wang thought it still too dangerous for him to go alone, only a few years after the defeat of the Taipings, with public order in rural China still unstable. He was 40  Cited in Claudia Brown and Ju-hsi Chou, <em>Transcending Turmoil: Painting at the Close</em> <em>of China’s Empire 1796–1911</em> (Phoenix: Phoenix Art Museum, Ariz., 1992), 126. In a recent study, Jonathan Hay also offers some fascinating tidbits on the Shanghai-Japan ties in the world of painting (and book exchange). See Jonathan Hay, “Painters and Publishing in Late Nineteenth-century Shanghai,” in <em>Art at the Close of China’s Empire</em>, ed. Ju-hsi Chou (Tempe, Ariz.: Arizona State University Press, 1998), especially 166–68, 187.</p>

<p>guided by a friend of Wang’s as well as by a monk from the Tiantai complex.</p>
<p>This part of the trip enabled Unpei to commune with the generations—Jiang Jiapu had visited the site three times to paint a famous scroll of it, and thus this trip through space also took on the aura for Unpei of a trip through time into the authentic world of Nanga art. Illness ultimately got the better of Unpei who was forced in the spring of 1868 to * * leave his erstwhile Japanese companions, Rōzan and Kansen, and return to Japan alone.43</p>
<p>Unpei had been gone roughly a year—1867 to 1868, arguably the most important year in modern Japanese history—but to someone who effectively was mentally living in another place and time, one can only surmise how much the events of the Meiji Restoration would have meant for him had he been in Japan. He settled in the renamed capital of Tokyo in 1870. Rōzan moved there a few years later, but there was never much love lost between the two men. Unpei had demonstrated a predilection for the sanctity of painting in the Southern School tradition, while Rōzan seems to have been drawn more to the Shanghai School’s eclecticism and to what some would have called its ties to filthy lucre. Whether they actually had a falling out is unclear, but they had little to do with one another.</p>
<p>One other Japanese figure, a Nanga painter who traveled to Shanghai to nurture his skills, was a man known as Ōkura Uson (Kingo; dates unknown). He came from Echigo like Unpei and from a family of doctors like Rōzan, but what he most shared with these two was an overriding desire to paint. His father forbade him from doing so, but when the father died, Uson made his way to Nagasaki where he began studying with Tetsuō. In the early 1870s he traveled to Shanghai, though as a low-level clerk in the Foreign Office and not as a painter.</p>
<p>In his spare time, he pursued his first love, making wide acquaintances in the world of Chinese painting.44</p>

<p>**Why Shanghai? **</p>
<p>What then was the attraction of Shanghai in particular for the Japanese who ventured there in the 1860s and 1870s? The most immediate and perhaps compelling draw for those Japanese who actively sought to reach Shanghai has as much to do with leaving Japan as it does with reaching that Chinese metropolis. Although they happen to be located in different countries, both of which 43  Shimizu, *Gajin Nagai Unpei, * 77–78, 81–85.</p>

<p>Lust for Still Life</p>

<p>strictly curtailed travel for several centuries before the 1860s, Nagasaki and Shanghai are closer than Nagasaki was to Edo (renamed Tokyo after the Meiji Restoration of 1868). Before the days of steamships and railroads, navigation might take several days between Nagasaki and Shanghai, but it would have taken much longer to go overland to the Japanese capital.</p>
<p>For educated Japanese to want to see what many considered the homeland of culture itself in China should not seem at all odd.45 It may be difficult to appreciate now, but in the 1860s when the possibility of travel opened up, Japanese educated in traditional continental disciplines, including painting, were a sizable group of those who went to observe the real China. They were not all necessarily pleased with the reality they discovered there—</p>
<p>reality, as we all know, is often vastly overrated—but, like the Nanga painters we have just described, they were virtually always thrilled to be able to commune spiritually with the landscape and often to meet the descendants of the great masters of the past. For the Western-oriented oil painters, Shanghai provided simultaneously new inspiration for artistic subject matter and exposure to the real West, albeit in microcosm.</p>
<p>There was as well a great deal more freedom of movement—again, not simply because it was Shanghai but also because it was not Japan—and this helps us to understand why Japanese from other professions, such as prostitutes who were well represented within the early expatriate community, sought it out. It offered release from the highly restrictive social ties of Japanese society and the equally unrestrictive atmosphere that notoriously characterized Shanghai.</p>
<p>Indeed, Shanghai was justifiably hailed as a wide open city where money bought privilege and where, if one wished, one could easily discard one’s earlier baggage at the port. It was both the real China and a bizarrely transfigured China in which so many Westerners and Chinese from elsewhere were living.</p>
<p>Because of the Westerners—a community almost entirely of merchants and a handful of missionaries—and because of the Chinese who took advantage of their presence there, Shanghai commercialized everything that it touched.</p>
<p>In many cases, that meant that it cheapened everything that passed through it. In a broad sense, one might go so far as to say that the Shanghai School of painting was a depraved incarnation of the earlier Yangzhou School, yet one that was prepared to sell its artistic production to the highest bidder within the metropolis. Nevertheless, the city offered Japanese many opportunities for self-advancement by making commercially available traditional arts for the pleasure of men of means there.</p>
<p>45  This is a theme I develop in Chapters 2 and 3 of <em>The Literature of Travel in the Japanese</em> *Rediscovery of China. *</p>
<p>156</p>
<p>Lust for Still Life</p>
<p>Eventually the Japanese population would grow in the second decade of the twentieth century to outstrip all other foreign communities in Shanghai, and then by the 1930s to outstrip all foreigners combined, reaching 100,000 by the early 1940s. In the last decades of the nineteenth century, it was still larger than any Japanese settlement elsewhere in China proper, though on a much more modest scale.46 In other words, Japanese were specially seeking out Shanghai.</p>
<p>To this day, the long cultural ties between China and Japan have enabled literate, well-educated Japanese in many spheres to partake of continental culture and, on occasion, to actively participate in it. Similarly, Japanese remain to this day the world’s most assiduous patrons and collectors of Chinese art work, past and present. Perhaps this penchant for acquiring Chinese works derives less from a craving to possess works for their invaluable monetary worth—</p>
<p>as with the insane international market for van Goghs—and more because, even when those paintings were executed by Chinese hands, in some significant sense the Japanese shared the experience. Nanga, precisely because of its Sinophilia, provided the perfect bridge for this expression of a shared culture.</p>
