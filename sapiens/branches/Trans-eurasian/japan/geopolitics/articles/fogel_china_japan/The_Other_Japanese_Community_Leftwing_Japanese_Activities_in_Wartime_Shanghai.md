title = "The Other Japanese Community: Leftwing Japanese Activities in Wartime Shanghai"

+++

To speak of the Japanese community of wartime Shanghai as a monolith would be to misrepresent its internal complexity. To the extent that we know of the Japanese in Shanghai in the 1930s and 1940s, we understand them to be a group closely self-protective and dependent on the home government and military for its security. The great majority of the Japanese in Shanghai in those tense years were most concerned with ensuring their government’s active involvement in protecting their community and its interests against the Chinese. 

There were, however, less well known voices among the Japanese who called for peace and urged their compatriots and government to take Chinese interests into account. Their stories come together about 1930 and overlap in the decade of the 1930s. Their range of successes and failures is broad. Their legacy, while debatable, has still played an important role in the revitalization of Sino-Japanese amity since 1972. After setting in context the modem Japanese experience in Shanghai, this chapter will examine a number of often linked events and Japanese personages whose commitment was to make things turn out much differently from the way they did.

**Background: The Japanese Community of Shanghai**

In Shanghai, as elsewhere in mainland China, the Japanese were the last of the foreign powers to become deeply involved in China with local affairs. By the 1930s, however, they had become by far the largest presence. From a population of less than fifty in 1873, just two years after the first Sino-Japanese Treaty of Commerce, the number of Japanese in Shanghai rose steadily. In 1935 there were 26,208 Japanese in Shanghai of a total of 76,931 throughout China proper.1 

This proportion made the Japanese community of Shanghai the largest 1  Ten years earlier, the Japanese had numbered 47,246 in China proper, marking a mild but consistent increase. The Japanese population in Manchuria, by contrast, increased twenty-fold between 1908 \(58,433\) and 1935 \(1,156,646\), much more rapidly than in the cities of China proper.

concentration of any city in China proper. From before the first Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese in Shanghai had been moving into the Hongkew \(Hongkou\) quarter of the city. Though they had won the right to establish their own exclusive concession area as a result of the Treaty of Shimonoseki, the Japanese never did claim such a right in Shanghai, as they did in Tianjin and Hankou. 

Instead the great majority remained in the International Settlement. Of the 26,208 in 1935, 19,651 resided there; only 1,450 were in the French Concession and some 5,107 in the Chinese quarters of the city. 

Many of those in the International Settlement lived in the area of North Sichuan Road, near the center of the concession. Along North Sichuan Road alone were several Japanese schools. Japanese-operated shops were principally on Wusong Road and Wenjianshi Road. This region was informally known as the “Japanese Concession” or “Japantown,” though there was no such formal designation. It was not located at the heart of Shanghai’s major thoroughfares.2

The Japanese established a consulate in Shanghai in 1872, and it was elevated to consulate-general status in 1891. With the Treaty of Shimonoseki, Japan acquired most-favored-nation status, and soon thereafter its consul in Shanghai sat on the governing consular board within the settlement. In 1871 international telegraphy was made possible between Shanghai and Nagasaki, and that same year Reuters set up shop in Shanghai. Four years later, the Mitsubishi Company opened regular sea lanes between Yokohama and Shanghai, and a branch of Mitsui Bussan was established in 1877. The Yokohama Specie Bank established a Shanghai branch in 1893, and five years later the Ôsaka Shipping Company opened a Yangzi Line. It was not until 1907 that the Shanghai branch of the Japanese Residents’ Association \(JRA\) was established, by which time these and many other banks and commercial establishments had branches in the city. Established first as a Japanese businessmen’s association in 1911, the 2  Katô Yûzô, “Shanhai ryakushi” \[A brief history of Shanghai\], appended to Matsumoto Shigeharu, Shanhai jidai: jaanarisuto no kaisô \[The Shanghai years: memoirs of a journalist\]

Japanese Chamber of Commerce came into existence in 1919 when there was a critical mass of Japanese commercial concerns.3

Of the fifteen Japanese schools in Shanghai in 1939, nine were run by the Shanghai JRA, which also operated a clinic, a cemetery, and a crematorium. 

The Higashi Honganji had set up a branch temple in Shanghai as early as 1874, and by the 1930s was managing several schools there. Other Japanese religious groups—Tenrikyô, Japanese Christians, and Shintô—had temples, shrines, and schools in Shanghai, too. 

Shanghai was as well a center of Chinese and international journalism. In addition to a corps of correspondents from the major Japanese dailies and weeklies, a number of Japanese newspapers were based in Shanghai, such as the Shanhai nippô \(founded in 1903\), the Shanhai nichinichi shinbun \(founded in 1914\), and the Shanhai mainichi shinbun \(founded in 1918\). Also the Jiangnan zhengbao \(founded in 1918\), a Japanese-owned and operated newspaper published in Chinese, was run out of Shanghai.4

There were also Japanese clubs, bathhouses, restaurants and bars, beauty salons, and inns in Shanghai. Hongkew was filled with Japanese goods and stores, and in many of the local Chinese shops Japanese was frequently spoken. Indeed, one could live an almost entirely insulated Japanese existence in Shanghai. In this regard, the Japanese were much like their counterparts from Europe. As early as 1920, though, the Japanese outnumbered all other foreign nationalities in Shanghai. By 1930 there were three times as many Japanese as British subjects in the city. 

In tandem with the growth and development of the Japanese community and business interests in Shanghai \(and elsewhere on the mainland\), there was an increasing Japanese police presence there. The largest force was the consular police, a group particularly feared by Japanese leftists active in China. 

There was as well the “higher police”; these were the “thought police” charged with rooting out subversion. The judicial police handled crimes committed within the Japanese community. Finally, the peace preservation police dealt with a variety of local health and welfare issues.5

The Other Japanese Community

The wide array of Japanese investments in Shanghai, more than elsewhere in China, represented interests worth protecting at great cost. As anti-Japanese boycotts and other outward demonstrations of Chinese ire at Japanese activities in China developed from the 1910s forward, the JRA in Shanghai and the Japanese community as a whole assumed an ever more bellicose stand. There were as well a number of Japanese military and paramilitary outfits at work in Shanghai: a Shanghai chapter of the Imperial Military Reserve Association, patriotic youth groups, and civilian \(vigilante\) groups. They all became extremely harsh in their denunciations of Chinese strikes and boycotts aimed at Japanese interests.6

Amid these loud calls for Japan to get tough and protect the Japanese and their concerns in Shanghai, there were other voices as well. After describing the background of the Japanese presence in the city, this chapter will look at several of the more remarkable instances of Japanese activists who risked considerable personal safety, to say nothing of their lives, in the interest of what they assumed would foil Japanese imperialism on the mainland. What drove Japanese at this time to strike out and devote themselves to Sino-Japanese amity in the face of heightening Sino-Japanese tensions? What was it about Shanghai that may have fostered this particular stance? In what ways did their experiences before coming to Shanghai, their reasons for making the trip, and the distinctive nature of their contacts in the city foster the political positions they adopted?

**Uchiyamo Kanzô and His Shanghai Bookstore**

In 1913 a recent Japanese convert to Christianity, Uchiyama Kanzô \(1885–1959\), followed his pastor’s suggestion and set off for Shanghai to make his mark in life. 

Four years later he opened his own bookstore, the Uchiyama Shoten, in an alley off North Sichuan Road in Hongkew. He would continue to operate it for the next thirty years. Uchiyama stocked primarily Japanese volumes, mostly religious works at first, though later catering to the many and varied interests of his customers, both Japanese and the many Chinese who had studied in Japan. As his store expanded, its second storey, which he had converted into a tatami room, became the meeting site for discussions among Chinese and Japanese writers.

As the years passed, Uchiyama thus became a mediator of sorts between Chinese and visiting Japanese authors, and his bookstore became a “salon” for brokering Sino-Japanese literary contacts. He dubbed these intellectual interactions mandankai or “conversation groups.” It was through his auspices, for example, that the great writer Tanizaki Jun’ichirô \(1886–1965\) was able to meet and interact with the likes of Tian Han \(1898–1966\), Guo Moruo \(1892–1978\), and Ouyang Yuqian \(1887–1962\). Later, Tanizaki introduced Uchiyama to the poet and novelist Satô Haruo \(1892–1964\), and through Uchiyama, Satô met many famous Chinese writers.7

Of all his Chinese contacts and associates, Uchiyama forged a special bond with China’s most famous writer of the prewar era, Lu Xun \(1881–1936\). Lu Xun moved to Shanghai from Guangdong with his wife in early October of 1927, and two days later he visited the nearby Uchiyama Shoten for the first time.8 Several days after that, as Uchiyama later recounted the story, Lu Xun returned, bought a large stock of books, and asked the proprietor “in impeccable Japanese” if they might be delivered to his home. Ready to oblige, Uchiyama asked for his customer’s name and address. 

“My name is Zhou Shuren,” he said.

8  I have referred here to Xu Guangping \(1898–1968\) as Lu Xun’s wife, though they may not actually have been married at this point. They had met and fallen in love the previous year, when Lu was married to another woman. He was intent that she fully understand his work, and to that end he assumed a paternal role in her life. In a letter dated December 2, 1926, he had written to her: “I think you do not have as much knowledge of life as I have . . . I feel that it would help you considerably to study something new . . . You have another weak point as well in that you cannot read works in foreign languages. It would be very valuable for you to learn Japanese. I will see that you study \[Japanese\] hard next year.” \(See Lu Xun, Lu Xun chuanji 

\[Collected works of Lu Xun\] \(Beijing: Renmin daxue chubanshe, 1987\), XI, p. 478. My thanks to my student, Tanaka Rei, for locating this passage and bringing it to my attention.\) Despite lessons he planned for her from a textbook he put together himself, Xu showed little aptitude for Japanese.

The Other Japanese Community

“Uh, you are Lu Xun? I certainly know your name well, and I knew as well that you had arrived from Guangdong, but I did not recognize your face. My apologies.” It was from that time that my association with Lu Xun commenced.9

In late March of 1930, Lu Xun was compelled to leave his residence for fear of arrest, and for one month until the end of April he hid out in the Uchiyama Shoten. In early May he found a safer apartment. 

As business prospered, Uchiyama moved his bookstore to North Sichuan Road in 1929. Its growth was fueled at least in part by the contemporaneous publication by the big publishing houses in Japan of huge muIti-volume series of works, with each volume costing one yen. These series are the ancestors of today’s ubiquitous zenshû \(collected works\) and sôsho \(collections\), although prices have increased a bit. Uchiyama marketed these editions of works in China, and because they made immense bodies of literature available at such reasonable prices he was able to forge close ties with many Chinese intellectuals. In addition to having the largest stock of Japanese books throughout China, he also sold 830 titles of Japanese books in Chinese translations.10

As many have since recalled, Uchiyama did his best to remain as apolitical as possible. Under the circumstances—with tensions between the Chinese and Japanese governments high, several recent localized Japanese military interventions in China, and the full-fledged invasion of the 1930s—being apolitical at this time meant being unwilling to accept the pronouncements of one’s own government toward China. It also meant that Uchiyama steered clear of becoming entangled in the internecine political skirmishes on the Chinese left. 

Of course, the overwhelming inclination of his Chinese clientele was strongly left-wing, and many of them were or would soon become Communists, but he stayed out of that fray. It was exceedingly difficult during the 1930s and 1940s to hold to an avowed position of apoliticality when the entire surrounding world was becoming so politicized. This was, none the less, Uchiyama’s stance. 

Furthermore, because he was in China and not in Japan, Uchiyama was able to sell Japanese books in translation, such as the writings of Marx and Lenin, that by the 1930s would have been increasingly difficult, if not outright impos-9  Uchiyama Kanzô, “Ro Jin sensei tsuioku” \[Remembrances of Mr Lu Xun\], in Uchiyama Kanzô, Ro Jin no omoide \[Memories of Lu Xun\] \(Tokyo: Shakai shisôsha, 1979\), p. 39. 

This article originally appeared in the journal Kanzô in 1936. The story has been retold many times, and were it not for Uchiyama’s own memoir, we might have reason to doubt its veracity. See also NHK’s “Dokyumento Shôwa,” part 2, “Shanhai kyôdo sokai” \[The International Settlement of Shanghai\], an hour-long television documentary broadcast on Japanese educational television \(NHK\) in 1986.

sible, to put on sale back home. He also remained in Shanghai after the victory of the Chinese Communists in 1949 and has since been officially lionized as a lao pengyou.  Needless to say, there was an unambiguous political stance in his remaining on the mainland and his longstanding sympathy for the left. For Uchiyama, that stance was less political than it was cultural and personal. 

Many other Chinese writers in addition to Lu Xun spent time at the Uchiyama Shoten. There were other Japanese in Shanghai who also frequented the bookstore, both to buy books and to make contacts with radical Chinese. 

Shanghai was rapidly becoming a breeding ground for subversive types from both countries. Their joint meetings transpired at a small handful of sites, and the second floor of Uchiyama’s shop was one of them. 

Another was the second floor of the Gongfei Coffee Shop at the end of North Sichuan Road. The “salon” that formed here was a place where leftwing Chinese and Japanese writers and cultural types frequently congregated. Ozaki Hotsumi \(1901–44\), the reporter and spy extraordinaire in the ring surrounding Richard Sorge \(1895–1944\), was a regular from the late 1920s on, as was Xia Yan \(Shen Duanxian, b. 1900\) upon his return to China in May 1927 after seven years in Japan. 

Xia supported himself principally by translating current Japanese literature—largely of the proletarian literary movement—into Chinese: Hirabayashi Taiko’s story “Seryôshitsu ni te” \(At the Free Clinic\), Kaneko Yôbun’s play Jigoku \(Hell\), Fujimori Seikichi’s short story “Gisei” \(The Sacrifice\), Nakano Shigeharu’s “Harusaki no kaze” \(The Wind of Early Spring\), Kobayashi Takiji’s story “Kanikôsen” \(Crab-canning Ship\), and many others. He obtained most of these works from the Uchiyama Shoten, and it was actually Uchiyama himself who introduced Xia to Lu Xun in 1928. Around this time he joined the Chinese Communist Party \(CCP\), which, of course, Lu Xun never did, and their friendship was, needless to say, short- lived. In October of 1929 Lu Xun, Xia Yan, and others took part in the planning of what would eventually materialize as the League of Leftwing Writers. At a meeting at the Gongfei Coffee Shop on February 16, 1930, a planning committee to found the League came into existence. Xia Yan brought a copy of the League’s founding manifesto to Nishizato Tatsuo \(see below\), and Nishizato translated it into Japanese and had it published in the cultural column of Shanhai nippô.  This event brought Nishizato to the attention of the Japanese consular police.11

**The Role of the Tô-A Dôbun Shoin**

Another breeding ground for Japanese radicalism in Shanghai and a site of Sino-Japanese cultural and political interactions from the 1920s through the 1930s was the Tô-A dôbun shoin \(East Asian Common Culture Academy\), surely the most famous of all the Japanese schools in the city. A product of the imagination of mainland adventurer and reformer Arao Kiyoshi \(1858–96\) and the hard work of his disciple, Nezu Hajime \(1860–1927\), and Konoe Atsumaro \(1863–1904\), the school was founded in 1900. It was to be, for both Chinese and Japanese, dedicated to the long-term reform of China along Japanese lines and thus to long-term Sino-Japanese friendship. The curriculum at Tô-A dôbun shoin stressed contemporary subjects—business, political science, agriculture—and with a heavy dose of Chinese-language training. Before it dissolved in 1945, with Japan’s defeat in the war, it graduated some 3,652 students.12

If it was hard enough to control Japanese students living in Tokyo who were separated from their families elsewhere in Japan, it was that much harder to do so in Shanghai. A number of Japanese students became deeply sympathetic to the Chinese labor movement in Shanghai, where they may have witnessed the May 30 Incident, Chinese workers’ demonstrations, or organized activities of the young Chinese Communist Party. Some became so enamored of Chinese leftist politics that they abandoned their education and threw themselves into the movement, and their language training and familiarity with the local terrain served them well. 

There were periodic incidents among the students, including strikes and walkouts spearheaded by the Chinese students. Despite the close scrutiny of the various Japanese police agencies, Chinese and Japanese students from the late 1920s became active in decidedly leftwing and anti-imperialist actions.

There were socialist study groups set up by the students with which the school authorities did not interfere. These activities intensified into the early 1930s, when, as Chalmers Johnson has pointed out, “what amounted to a Japanese cell of the Chinese Communist Youth League had been established” at the Tô-A dôbun shoin.13

Among the subsequently more notorious students of these years were such well known Communists as Ozaki Shôtarô \(b. 1906, class of 1930\), Anzai Kuraji \(b.  1905, class of 1931. postwar member of the central committee of the Japan Communist Party \(JCP\)\), Nishizato Tatsuo \(class of 1930\), and Nakanishi Tsutomu \(1910–73, class of 1933 though he never graduated, postwar JCP member of the Diet\). They and others worked with Chinese and with other Japanese in and around Shanghai in the 1930s.14

****

**From Journalists to Spies, from Study Groups to Practical Action** One of the less well known Japanese activists in Shanghai at this time was Kawai Teikichi \(1901–81\). As a student at Meiji University, Kawai had come into contact with radical leftwing groups envigorated by the recent Bolshevik revolution. Through an acquaintance in China in the mid-1920s, he also began to hear about the revolutionary events on the mainland, and he resolved to go to China as soon as he could. To save sufficient funds for the trip, he worked for several weeks for the Seiyûkai, a rightwing political party. This insouciance, this lapse in his ability to distinguish clearly between the far left and the far right—what I dub his “political dyslexia”—plagued Kawai for his entire career and made him a favorite target for the more politically astute. Lacking the full genius of political hindsight, people like Kawai in the 1920s and even early 1930s viewed what we now see clearly as radical rightwing activity as simply radical, opposed to an oppressive government, and anti-capitalist. Kawai, for example, continued through his entire life to argue that Kita Ikki \(1883–1937\), an avowed fascist executed for his behind-the-scenes role in the February 26 

Incident, was in fact a progressive revolutionary. Of course, many did see these left-right differences clearly at the time, but for others it was apparently still inchoate.

The Other Japanese Community

After a short first trip to China in 1928, Kawai returned in 1930, first to Beijing and in June to Shanghai. The friend who brought him there was Komatsu Shigeo. Komatsu had worked for the Japanese Home Office in Beijing as a translator, before leaving to work under Tachibana Shiraki \(1881–1945\), the journalist and expatriate scholar of Chinese affairs, in Shanghai. By 1930, he was in the employ of the South Manchurian Railway Company \(SMR\). Kawai took to Shanghai instantly. He felt he had finally arrived at the heart of the Chinese revolution, and he loved it. 

Upon their arrival in Shanghai, Komatsu telephoned the Chinese translator. 

Wen Shengguang, and the private China scholar, Tanaka Tadao \(1894–1964\). 

Tanaka had earlier served as a translator of Japanese documents for Deng Yanda \(1895–1931\), and through him had made many acquaintances in the Chinese Communist movement—among them Liu Shaoqi \(1898–1969\), Xiang Zhongfa \(1880–1931\), and Li Lisan \(1899–1967\); he also knew Negishi Tadashi through contacts at the Tô-A dôbun shoin. He had worked as well for the Tokyo branch of the Research Department of the SMR, but by 1930 he was engaged in his own research on Chinese currency systems. He had come to Shanghai after Jiang Kai-shek \(1887–1975\) had brought down the Wuhan regime, and he was living with Wen Shengguang and Wen’s Japanese wife, writing for the weekly Shanhai shûhô.  Komatsu and Kawai joined Tanaka and Wen for dinner soon thereafter to discuss China-related issues.15

Their meetings soon became more regular, and they were joined in August by Soejima Tatsuoki and Tejima Hirotoshi, friends of Kawai’s from Beijing whom he had summoned to Shanghai. In addition, several students from the Tô-A dôbun shoin participated in these meetings: Anzai Kuraji, Shirai Yukiyoshi \(class of 1932\), Mizuno Shigeru \(class of 1933\), and Nishizato Tatsuo. Funakoshi Hisao \(1902–45\), a journalist for the Shanhai mainichi shinbun, also attended. 

They saw themselves as a study group—the Chinese Problems Study Group—and their recognized theoretical leader was Wen’s friend, Wang Xuewen \(1895–1985\). Wang was a graduate of Kyoto University where he had studied economics under Kawakami Hajime \(1879–1946\), the leading Marxist economist in Japan. He was virtually bilingual in Japanese by virtue of having spent some fourteen years there. He had joined the Chinese Communist Youth League in Japan, before returning to Shanghai in 1927 and joining the CCP itself. Perhaps most important, he had been assigned the job by the party of rallying “antiwar, anti-imperialist” Japanese in Shanghai to active participation in the Communist cause. None of the Japanese with whom he had contact 15  Kawai Teikichi, Harukanaru seinen no hibi ni: watakushi no hansei ki \[Days of my distant youth: a record of half my life\] \(Tokyo: Tanizawa shobô, 1979\), pp. 48–9, 84, 176, 184, 191, 193, 207–11, 259, 262, 320, 339, 341–3; and Ozaki Hotsuki, Shanhai 1930 nen pp. 119–25.

knew that Wang held positions of importance within the Chinese Communist Party at this time, though few of them would probably have been bothered by knowledge of that fact. Wang remained active in Shanghai until 1937, when he repaired to Yan’an, where he and Japanese Communist Nosaka Sanzô \(1892–

1993\) organized and taught at the Japanese Peasants and Workers’ School for captured troops of the Japanese army.16

With Wang as their guide, the group discussed such topics as the developing Chinese Communist movement and the nature of Chinese society, both hot issues in leftist intellectual circles at the time in China. Through another connection, Nakanishi Tsutomu also heard Wang’s analysis of the recent third party plenum of the sixth congress of the CCP \(September 1930\), the critique of the Li Lisan line, and was deeply impressed. The serial that Tanaka was working for, Shanhai shûhô, had been owned by a conservative reformist of the Kang Youwei school but by 1930 he had died. Kawai and Komatsu had soon thereafter joined the staff, and Shanhai shûhô had become pro-Communist. 

In mid-October, a CCP member by the name of Yang Liuqing—originally from Taiwan, he had participated in the Hailufeng Soviet of 1927 and was active in the Japanese study group—suggested that the members go beyond studying Chinese society and get involved in action. Wang agreed. At Kawai’s suggestion they named themselves the Nis-Shi tôsô dômei, or Sino-Japanese Struggle Alliance. Tanaka and Wen disagreed with this direction, fearing severe police reprisals, and did not join the Alliance, and Kawai criticized them for being too bookish. Many years later Kawai confessed that the Alliance had been established on a directive from the CCP to Yang, who was then operating under the pseudonym of Jiang.17

The Other Japanese Community

The first and most flamboyant act fomented by the Sino-Japanese Struggle Alliance was an antiwar propaganda stunt at the Japanese Naval Landing Party in Shanghai. The latter was a stark, visible symbol of Japanese military protection of Japanese nationals and their property in Shanghai. To commemorate the thirteenth anniversary of the Russian revolution, the young men printed up posters and bilingual leaflets in opposition to any hostilities between China and Japan. Their activities had already brought them under the scrutiny of Japanese consular police and the Kenpeitai \(military police\). On the evening of November 7, 1930, they used coal tar to write in immense characters on the wall of the Naval Landing Party building:

Down with Japanese imperialism\! 

Link hands with the Chinese Soviets\! 

Turn your guns around and bring down the capitalist-landlord state\! 

Long live the Chinese Communist Party\! 

Long live the soldiers, workers, and peasants\! 

The event was, needless to say, widely reported in the press. 

In sympathy with these antiwar sentiments, a group of students in the Tô-A dôbun shoin joined the Alliance. Just before this event, a Chinese Communist Youth Group had formed within the student body, and a student strike was under way there. One Iwabashi Takeji, an activist in the Alliance, was responsible for handing out anti-war leaflets to Japanese officer candidates in port at Shanghai. On December 27, a number of students were arrested, and members of the Alliance turned to Wang for guidance, but before he could get back to them from party channels, most had fled the city for Beijing. These repressions of Alliance activities were exaggeratedly reported in the press as the “Japan Communist Party Incident.” By early 1931, the arrested Tô-A dôbun students had been released and a number of them were expelled from school. Nishizato was arrested as a leader of this incident by the Higher Police in Tokyo in August 1931; he was imprisoned in Nagasaki and released in only December 1932. For a time such radical activities among the Japanese of Shanghai quieted down.18

**Shanghai and the Japanese in the Sorge Spy Ring**

Another CCP directive passed to Yang in October of 1931 called on him to find Japanese to cooperate with the intelligence-gathering activities of Richard Sorge. Yang turned to Ozaki Hotsumi and Kawai Teikichi, and it was at Yang’s home in Shanghai that these two Japanese first met in October 1931.19 Ozaki told Kawai to meet him the very next day, and the two men repaired to a restaurant, accompanied by “a foreign woman,” where they met a foreign man. 

The woman was Agnes Smedley \(1892–1950\), the man Richard Sorge. Kawai knew neither of them, but assumed they were Comintern agents. Sorge asked him if he could go to North China and Manchuria to collect data on Japanese army activities, and Kawai assented. Sorge had been charged by Red Army Intelligence with finding out if the Japanese planned to invade south into China proper or north into Siberia. Ozaki would provide Kawai with contacts. 

ory of the incident\) in one pertinent detail. He claims that the line “Long live the Chinese Communist Party” was not one of the slogans plastered on the wail; it would have been, he claims, contrary to the nature of their movement. As a lifelong Communist, Nishizato found he had many similar bones to pick with Kawai; when describing events of those times in China, he frequently found himself agreeing with fellow comrade Nakanishi Tsutomu in opposition to Kawai. On Nishizato’s arrest, see Kakumei no Shanhai de,  

pp .  100, 110–14. 

19  Because much has been written about Ozaki’s role in the Sorge spy ring, what follows will focus more directly on the role played by Kawai. For scholarship on Ozaki, see Chalmers Johnson, An Instance of Treason; F.W. Deakin and G.R. Storry, The Case of Richard Sorge \(London: Chatto and Windus, 1966\); Gordon Prange, Target Tokyo: The Story of the Sorge Spy Ring \(New York: McGraw-Hill, 1984\); and Julius Mader, Dr.-Sorge-Report: Ein Dokumentarbericht ūber Kunderschafter des Friedens mit ausgewählten Artikeln von Richard Sorge \(Berlin: Militärverlag der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik, 1984\). 

Kawai held the unique distinction of all those intimately involved in the spy ring of both surviving prison and World War II and being willing to speak and write about it after the war. In addition to three volumes of memoirs, cited inter alia  he wrote fourteen popular volumes of Chinese and Japanese history. I have discussed his work as a non-academic scholar in “Senzen Nihon no minkan Chûgokugaku” \[Non-academic genres of Sinology in prewar Japan\], in Kôsaku suru Ajia \[Asia entangled\], ed. Mizoguchi Yûzô, Hamashita Takeshi, Hiraishi Naoaki, and Miyajima Hiroshi \(Tokyo: Tokyo University Press, 1993\), in the series Ajia kara kangaeru \(Reconsiderations from Asia\), 1י pp. 259–65. Kobayashi Fumio has almost fawningly written about Kawai’s scholarship in several essays, such as 

“Kawai Teikichi no Chûgoku   kan” \[Kawai Teikichi’s view of China\], in his Chûgoku gendai shi no danshô \[Fragments from the contemporary history of China\] \(Tokyo: Tanizawa shobô, 1986\) pp. 108–32.

The Other Japanese Community

When Kawai, who was just thirty years of age, asked if this was a Comintern assignment, Ozaki laughed it off and asked Kawai to trust him.20

As he recounted in a volume of memoirs, Kawai assumed he was working on behalf of peace, anti-imperialism, socialism, and hence ultimately in the best interests of Japan. He traveled to Beijing first, where he was inundated by anti-Japanese slogans and banners everywhere. He describes the process by which he turned his entire being into a set of eyes and ears, amassing information on behalf of the international proletariat, and intent on discovering what Japan was up to in the region. As was his wont, he garnered much of his data from Japanese bar girls in establishments frequented by Japanese employees of the SMR, the Gaimushô, the local Japanese press, and later members of the Japanese armed forces. He soon made his way to Fengtian, where the information about the Manchurian Incident was coming fast and furious. He wrote up his impressions, which were dispatched through secret couriers back to Ozaki in Shanghai. Finally, a Chinese contact delivered to Kawai a letter in Ozaki’s hand instructing him to return to Shanghai. 

In early December, after two months on the job, Kawai arrived back in Shanghai. He had much to tell Ozaki, who promptly asked him to write it up immediately and append his own thoughts. He could clearly see that the mood in Shanghai had swung in a sharply anti-Japanese direction in those two months. The next day he and Ozaki went to Smedley’s apartment in the French Concession, and Sorge soon arrived. Ozaki had already translated Kawai’s report for him into English. Sorge shook his hand and began pelting him with specific questions about Japanese troop strengths and their aims. Kawai told him that the Guandong army wanted to sever Manchuria from the control of the Nanjing regime and establish a state under Japanese control. The fact that there were only 30,000 Japanese troops in the region, he surmised, probably meant that they would not invade Siberia any time too soon—not exactly a clairvoyant conclusion. The army had enlisted the support of two ultrarightist groups to these ends. After responding to Sorge’s questions, Kawai was asked to go back to Manchuria, again traveling under cover of being a reporter for Shanhai shûhô.21

On January 18,1932, a small group of Japanese monks walking the streets of Shanghai and intoning the Nichiren chant, for which they were greatly despised among the local populace, were set upon by angry Chinese. One was badly beaten, another killed. The incident outraged the Japanese community of Shanghai. Reprisals were meted out by some Japanese vigilantes, and the troubles escalated. The JRA requested military assistance and demon-20  Kawai Teikichi, Aru kakumeika no kaisô, pp. 48–51.

strated in front of the Japanese consulate, demanding arms to defend themselves. Seventy pistols were distributed to them, which were quickly turned to offensive ends as they attacked Chinese merchants and rioted. By January 21, reports that a Japanese warship was on its way reached Shanghai; it arrived two days later. The Chinese responded by arming the local populace, and fighting erupted on January 29. That such a minor fracas could lead to what would be called the Shanghai Incident in which some 25,000 Chinese were killed or wounded is evidence of the heightened Sino-Japanese tensions in the city. 

Kawai arrived back in Shanghai in the early morning hours of January 30. 

He somehow made his way amid the fighting to his newspaper office. Was he saddened by the fact that, for all his efforts to the contrary, China and Japan were at war? Was he distraught that the imperialist military forces of his native land had attacked and brutalized the Chinese? No, he was ecstatic, because the reverberations of bombs and gunfire were, in his estimation, the death throes of capitalism, for “the laws of history were straightforward.” He made contact with Ozaki, and they later visited Sorge. After making his report, Kawai was again asked to return to Manchuria to continue his work.22

Sorge, though, needed another contact person in Shanghai, because Ozaki was planning to leave the Asahi shinbun.  Ozaki recommended Yamagami Masayoshi \(1896–1938\), branch head of Rengô tsûshin, the Japanese news service, in Shanghai. Yamagami had initially come to Shanghai in 1925 as a reporter for the Shanhai nippô.  His travels through China’s major southern cities brought him into contact with such luminaries of the Creation Society as Yu Dafa \(1896–1945\), Cheng Fangwu \(1897–1984\), Wang Duqing \(1898–1940\), and Mu Mutian \(1900–71\) in Guangdong as well as with Lu Xun. In December of 1927 he filed a detailed report on the Canton commune. Two years later he wrote a play, Shina o shinkan saseta mikkakan \(Three days that shook China\), as a historical testament. After the collapse of the Canton commune, he returned to Shanghai and from there to Japan. In October 1929 he was back in Shanghai, where he bumped into Lu Xun on the street, an event recorded in Lu’s diary. 

Yamagami was living on North Sichuan Road with a Japanese woman, the first Japanese beautician in Shanghai, who operated her own salon in the area. 

In late 1928, shortly after he arrived in Shanghai, Ozaki went to visit the office of the Creation Society on North Sichuan Road. He met many leftwing writers there and even wrote under a pen name for their serial, Dazhong wenyi \(Literature and art for the masses\). One such writer, Tao Jingsun \(1897–1952\), who succeeded Yu Dafu as editor of Dazhong wenyi, recalled in his memoirs that Ozaki later introduced him there to Yamagami. Yamagami and Ozaki, both 22  Kawai Teikichi, Aru kakumeika no kaisô, pp. 82–6; and Jordan, Chinese Boycotts versus Japanese Bombs, pp. 223–33 passim.

The Other Japanese Community

members of the Japanese fourth estate in Shanghai, had been friends for some period of time. Both men contributed, under pseudonyms, essays to Tao’s journal, which translated a large number of pieces from the proletarian literature movement in Japan. Tao had studied medicine and lived in Japan for twenty-two years, where he had met Guo Moruo and founded the literary magazine GREEN in Kyûshû.23

Ultimately, Yamagami was too busy to devote the necessary time to helping Sorge, but he suggested that another journalist with good leftist credentials, Funakoshi Hisao, fill the needed slot. Funakoshi had already been involved** **

in the Sino-Japanese Struggle Alliance and later in communicating Kawai Teikichi’s reports to Ozaki, and hence to Sorge. He** **worked with Sorge and Kawai until Sorge left China in 1933 and subsequently for Sorge’s replacement in Shanghai.

**Nishizato Tatsuo and the Chinese Communist Party**

Another manner in which one leftist Japanese with years of experience living in Shanghai accommodated himself to the changed circumstances and the heightened political atmosphere of the 1930s is typified by Nishizato Tatsuo. Released in late 1932 after sixteen months in prison, Nishizato found he had missed both the Manchurian Incident and the establishment of the 

“puppet” state of Manzhouguo \(Manchukuo\). In 1934 he was able to get back to Shanghai, where he found the main difference from several years before to be the shift toward a harsher Chinese attitude toward Japanese. With the help of friends he was able to secure a position with Rengô tsûshin in Shanghai, an indication that for every overt Japanese activist in China there were probably any number of sympathetic ones. 

Nishizato also began to try to establish contact with the Chinese Communist Party. One day he met his former friend Wang Xuewen in Jessfield Park, and with Wang’s help Nishizato began the process of entering the CCP. “My new 23  Ozaki Hotsuki, Shanhai 1930 nen, pp. 90–6, 142–3, 188–90; Chalmers Johnson, An Instance of Treason, pp. 51–2, 81, 266; and Zhonghua minguo shi cidian, p. 421. In early 1931. Yamagami, having earlier secured Lu Xun’s permission, began to translate “The True Story of A Q” 

into Japanese. Just at that time the Longhua Incident erupted, in which five young leftist authors were arrested and murdered by the Guomindang. The translation was dedicated to these five “martyrs,” and some of their writings were also translated and included in the final product, which appeared later that year. Shina shôsetsu shû A Q seiden \[A collection of Chinese fiction: The True Story of A Q\]. Yamagami used the pen name of Lin Shouren; Lu Xun proofed the translation for accuracy; and Ozaki, writing under the pseudonym of Shirakawa Jirô, contributed an introduction.

life began,” as he recalled many years later. As he would describe it, he was so opposed to the Japanese war of invasion against China and he so wanted to express his solidarity with the Chinese people that the best course he could pursue was to join the CCP He wanted to fight shoulder-to-shoulder with the Chinese people against “world fascism.” 

He was assigned by the CCP the task of carrying on anti-war work among Japanese troops. Every week he met with a representative of the CCP in the French Concession in Shanghai. This contact was his lifeline to the Communist movement elsewhere in China; it was from this line of information that he learned, for instance, of the Fifth Encirclement Campaign being waged by Jiang Kai-shek’s forces against the Communists in Jiangxi. He eventually took a position with the Yomiuri newspaper to support himself while continuing his political activities.24

**Later Developments in 1930s Shanghai**

Japanese operatives and sub-operatives in the Sorge-Ozaki ring continued their work in China after the early 1930s, but mostly in cities other than Shanghai. 

Funakoshi moved on to Tianjin and Hankou, making occasional trips to the northeast, while Kawai, too, traveled mainly in Manchuria. That was where the action about which Sorge sought information was to be found. Sorge and Ozaki themselves remained in Tokyo. Other Japanese sympathetic to Chinese yearnings, though, remained in Shanghai. 

As the political scene in Japan lurched sharply to the right, leftwing activists usually were compelled either to undergo a “reorientation” \(tenkô\)  of their views and a concomitant embracing of the Japanese imperial institution, or effectively to go underground. As hundreds of their former fellows were willing, for an assortment of reasons, to compromise their socialist views and avoid prison terms, or worse, others among these leftists fled the home islands for China. It was, ironically, there that they frequently found work—which was by the mid-to late 1930s impossible for them to come by in Japan—with the largest Japanese colonial enterprise in history, the Research Department of the South Manchurian Railway Company. Their recruitment was made possible by the fact that the leaders of the immense research division, men such as Itô Takeo \(1895–1985\), shared their views on many issues, if not their overall 24  Nishizato Tatsuo, Kakumei no Shanhai de, pp. 115, 122–3, 125–8, 131–2, 167. 

448

The Other Japanese Community

world view, ltô himself employed several dozen such men—including such Communists as Ozaki Hotsumi and Ishidô Kiyotomo \(b. 1904\).25

Most of these Japanese leftists moved to Manchuria. Some, though, were hired to work in Shanghai, where Itô was head of the Research Department’s branch office. Just at this moment in the late 1930s, as Japan was preparing for total war, the SMR was impelled to expand its research activities broadly. It needed capable men who knew how to conduct research, and Itô and others in the SMR knew where to get them. The irony of their position, leftists working for such a colonial enterprise in the middle of Japan’s most egregious imperialist adventure, was not lost on these men. 

This is how Itô described the situation in Shanghai:

There were as well a fair number of leftists at the Shanghai office \[of the SMR\] where I was working. All sorts of people had come with introductions from acquaintances of mine from the Shinjinkai \[New Man Society, a liberal-radical student organization of the late 1910s and early 1920s\] 

days. Altogether our office had over three hundred employees and a budget of over three million yen. 

As the Research Department expanded, several large-scale research projects were carried out, and the Research Division of the Shanghai office bore its share of the responsibility. Shanghai played the most important role in three research projects: Shina kôsenryoku chôsa \[Investigation of the resis-25  Itô Takeo, Life along the South Manchurian Railway: The Memoirs of Itô Takeo,   trans. Joshua A. 

Fogel \(Armonk, N.Y.: M.E. Sharpe, 1988\), pp. xv–xvi, 173. See also Ishidô Kiyotomo’s fascinating memoirs, Waga itan no Shôwa shi \[My heretical history in the Shôwa period\] 

\(Tokyo: Keisô shobô, 1987\), and Zoku waga itan no Shôwa shi \[My heretical history in the Shôwa period, continued\] \(Tokyo: Keisô shobô, 1990\). There are any number of works on the SMR and its Research Department. Among the better ones on the SMR are: Andô Hikotarô, Mantetsu: Nihon teikokushugi to Chûgoku \[The SMR: Japanese imperialism and China\] \(Tokyo: Ochanomizu shobô, 1965\); and Harada Katsumasa, Mantetsu \[The SMR\] 

\(Tokyo: Iwanami shoten, 1984\). The better works on the SMR’s research activities would include: Hara Kakuten, Gendai Ajia kenkyû seiritsu shiron: Mantetsu chôsabu, Tô-A kenkyûjo, IPR no kenkyû \[Historical analysis of the founding of modern Asian studies: studies of the Research Department of the SMR, the East Asian Research Institute, and the Institute of Pacific Relations\] \(Tokyo: Keisô shobô, 1984\); Hara Kakuten, Mantetsu chôsabu to Ajia \[The Research Department of the SMR and Asia\] \(Tokyo: Sekai shoin, 1986\); Yamada Gôichi, Mantestu chôsabu, eikô to zasetsu no yonjûnen \[The Research Department of the SMR: forty years of glory and frustration\] \(Tokyo: Nihon keizai shinbunsha, 1977\); and Kusayanagi Daizô, Jitsuroku: Mantetsu chôsabu \[The true story of the Research Department of the SMR\] \(Tokyo: Asahi shinbunsha, 1979\).

tance capacity of the Chinese\], Nichi-Man-Shi infure chôsa \[Investigation of Japanese-Manchudan-Chinese inflation\], and Sekai jôsei bunseki \[An analysis of international conditions\]. The first of these occupied the Shanghai office for three calendar years, 1939–41. Most prominently active in the project was Nakanishi Tsutomu.26

Exceedingly few, probably not even Itô himself, knew that Nakanishi was a Japan Communist Party operative, a mole of sorts in the SMR. Itô certainly knew that Nakanishi held personal and scholarly views considerably to the left of center, and even had he known of Nakanishi’s party affiliation it is entirely likely that he would have acted no differently. 

Nakanishi had learned Chinese exceedingly well—so well, indeed, that he could pass as Chinese when circumstances demanded—while a student at the Tô-A dôbun shoin a decade earlier. In China he became deeply enamored of the Chinese revolution and was eventually expelled from school. He returned to China in 1934 and entered the SMR. Through the mid-1930s he wrote in SMR 

journals on the Chinese labor movement and general economic conditions in China and Manchuria. He served as one of the thirty-one researchers employed by Itô at the SMR’s Tianjin office in 1935 to carry out the now legendary village investigations in the Jidong region. His many articles on Chinese agriculture repeatedly lacerated the “ruthless feudal exploitation” exercised by Chinese landlords over the peasant population.27

Undoubtedly because of his expertise in village investigation, his knowledge of Chinese, his wide travels in China, and his methodological acuity, Nakanishi, still a low-level functionary in the overall SMR machine, was given the lion’s share of responsibility in the project designed to uncover the resistance capacity of the Chinese people. I have discussed this material elsewhere28 and will not reproduce it here, except to note that the thrust of Nakanishi and his fellow workers’ immense study was to encourage the Guandong Army, sponsor of the study, to seek an immediate political solution and get out of China quickly. 

A ground war on the Asian mainland, he warned, would be unwinnable.

**Conclusions**

Many of the Japanese who traveled to Shanghai for their tertiary education were looking for an altogether new experience, a way to make a contribution to Japan’s future in the new, increasingly international world. What better place than the most cosmopolitan city in East Asia? From the late Meiji period through the early years of the Shôwa period, this outward-looking attitude was far more pronounced that it had been before. Similarly, journalists posted voluntarily or otherwise to China in these years sought out or found a world in Shanghai full of extraordinary excitement and experience unlike anything they could bring to it. A confluence of forces—including a proclivity to sympathize with the nascent Chinese student and labor movements, the new global perspective afforded by living in Shanghai, the intimate personal and cultural links forged with Chinese intellectuals and writers with a similar view of the contemporary world, and the proselytizing activities of Chinese Communist activists, among others—pushed many of them in a decidedly leftwing direction. 

Through the 1930s and into the early 1940s, political and military tensions escalated between China and Japan, as well as within Japanese society. These tensions affected the nature of the activities of the small groups of Japanese leftist sympathizers in Shanghai. Initially literary contacts became increasingly political and resulted in activism—indeed, this was a route that many Chinese writers themselves had traveled. For some Japanese activists, this path led as far as to international espionage. The heightened tensions within Japan forced many Japanese to relatively brief careers as researchers in China. 

Ultimately both of these groups—namely, the Japanese active in antimilitarist, anti-imperialist, and strongly leftwing politics in China and those who went to work for the largest colonial Japanese enterprise that has ever existed—were decimated by the Japanese military and government. Where the majority population of Japanese in Shanghai had once felt isolated and threatened, now with the Japanese military build-up on the mainland it was decidedly those opposed to Japanese pursuance of war against China who feared for their lives. For the Japanese leftist activists in Shanghai, the mushrooming of intelligence agencies represented an ominous threat and finally the end to their continued work. In a volume of his memoirs written after the war, Kawai Teikichi described the scene in this way:

Shanghai was the international capital of espionage. Lines of intelligence linked some people there with Washington, others with London or Berlin, Moscow or Tokyo. Just among Japanese intelligence organs \[in Shanghai\], 

The Other Japanese Community

451

there were those of the army, the navy, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police, the Foreign Office, the Justice Ministry, the Taiwan Governor-General’s Office, and the Korea Governor-General’s Office. Each of these had independent agencies and competed with each other. Of course, the object of intelligence gathering was politics, military affairs, and thought. Furthermore, the Shanghai Municipal Council stood at the forefront in the inspection of all of Shanghai.29

Only the journalist-spy Ozaki was actually executed, but others died in prison or shortly after being released in late 1945 from malnutrition. From the early 1940s Japanese leftists and others even remotely sympathetic to them began to be arrested by the various Japanese police agencies in China and at home. 

Ozaki, Sorge, and their operatives were taken in 1941 and 1942. Nakanishi was seized in 1942, largely, it appears, because his report on the resistance capacity of Chinese had made the Japanese authorities suspicious of his true sympathies; Nishizato was taken in the same sweep of arrests. A large number of SMR 

researchers, including Itô, were hauled off to jail in 1942 and 1943. Many died of malnutrition or exposure in the wintry Manchurian climate. 

None the less, a significant minority of these scholars and activists went on to brilliant postwar careers in government, leftwing politics, and academic life. 

They wore their wartime prison sentences on their lapels as a badge of honor. 

Uchiyama Kanzô, the remarkable man who has never been studied in English, was one of a tiny few able to bridge the Sino-Japanese gap at this savage historical juncture. His determinedly apolitical stance, but clear sympathy in the eyes of Chinese, enabled him to remain with his store through the harshest years of Sino-Japanese hostilities, the end of World War II in 1945 and the establishment of the People’s Republic in 1949, until his death in 1959. 

Of course, these leftwing activists were far from a majority of the Japanese resident in Shanghai or elsewhere in China in these years. Indeed, Japanese journalists were among the most severe denigrators of contemporary Chinese society and politics of all Japanese visitors there in the entire prewar period. 

None the less, the handful of remarkable individuals discussed above did make a distinctive contribution to modem Chinese political history and Sino-Japanese relations, in spite of the fact that at a higher level Sino-Japanese relations were rapidly disintegrating. Given the way the war ultimately turned out, they probably are justified in the enormous postwar pride they have felt for their prewar and wartime activities. No history of the period is complete without their stories.

**Akutagawa Ryūnosuke and China **

Akutagawa Ryūnosuke \(1892–1927\) lived a mere thirty-five years, much of it in ill health, but he filled it with experiences and writings that have long outlived him. He was born in an area of Tokyo inhabited almost entirely by foreigners; there his father sold dairy products to the Westerners. By all accounts his family life was less than happy. One of three children, an older sister had died before he was born, and his mother fell into a state of dementia shortly after his birth. He was raised by his maternal uncle and his uncle’s wife, taking their surname of Akutagawa. On the whole, although he was not a deprived child, the memories of his youth were not without pain. 

In later years, Akutagawa recalled that the favorite novels as a youngster were the great Chinese epics, Xi you ji \(Journey to the west\) and Shuihu zhuan \(Water margin\), and characters from these works figure in several of the theatrical productions he describes at length in his travelogue of China. Indeed, the fact that be knew these and other Chinese novels so well, having read them many times, greatly enhanced his experiences in China. Wracked by illness from a young age, he spent many hours in his youth reading at home and in the local libraries. This voracious reading habit—he gobbled up all the Japanese writers of the Meiji period—remained with him his entire life. By the last years of the Meiji period, in his later teens, he began as well to read works in English or translated into English. 

As a student in the elite First Senior High School, Akutagawa chose English literature as his major. He was a hard-working student there who never accommodated to the reckless lifestyle that many of his contemporaries adopted. 

During these years he also began reading in European philosophy and extensively in continental European literature. His friend and classmate, Kikuchi Hiroshi, whose name appears in this travelogue, believed him to be the best-read Japanese of his generation. 

From his youth through his adolescent high school years, Akutagawa also developed a keen interest in bizarre tales of ghosts and other supernatural phenomenon, an interest that would remain with him his entire short life. 

Many of his early stories combine a penchant for the fantastic, even grotesque, with an inclination toward history. This combination can be seen in perhaps his most famous work, Rashōmon, which appeared in 1917.

Akutagawa Ryūnosuke and China

His stories frequently demonstrate a firm grounding in tile literary traditions of both Japan and China. We may now take it for granted that educated men and women of late Meiji and Taishō times were well educated in the Chinese and Japanese classics, but we should not lose track of the fact that the acquisition of this knowledge still required many long, hard hours of study, and some certainly took that learning to higher levels than others. 

Among those Japanese writers and poets of the prewar era who traveled to China, Akutagawa was in a small class with Satō Haruo \(1892–1964\), Tanizaki Jun’ichirō \(1886–1965\), Yosano Akiko \(1878–1942\), and perhaps a :few others who knew the Chinese literary tradition well. One tends to think of the late Meiji and Taishō era as a time in which Western literary trends had captured the Japanese creative imagination. Without attempting to disprove this general assessment, it is important to remember that even the greatest literary masters of the era, men and women much in debt to and heavily influenced by European literature, such as Natsume Sōseki \(1867–1916\), also owed much to continental Asian literary traditions. Sōseki was one of the greatest Chinese-Ianguage poets ofhisday in Japan. 

From 1918 Akutagawa entered into an exclusive contract to write only for the Ōsaka manichi shinbun, and over the next three years he wrote and published prolifically. In late March 1921 he went to China on assignment for the Ōsaka mainichi to write a series of articles on cultural life in China’s major cities. He had acquired sufficient stature as a writer that the newspaper owners felt that such a series would be a major publicity coup. In fact, installments of his travel narrative were carried in the Japanese-language press in China as well, making the whole journey a literary event The newspaper widely publicized the trip, and he was doted on by Japanese he met all along the way. From the later 1910s China was in the grip of intellectual ferment, the New Culture Movement or the May 4 Movement, and the Japanese press was interested in capturing that ferment for their readers. Akutagawa’s task was to convey how younger Chinese activists under the influence of Western trends in politics, literature, and the arts were confronting age-old Chinese cultural forms. 

Unfortunately, he became seriously ill en route and had to wait more than a week in the Japanese port city of Moji before he was fit enough to board a ship for Shanghai. When he did arrive in Shanghai at the very end of March, he was so ill that he was forced to spend three weeks in a hospital to overcome a bout of pleurisy. His travels took him to a number of China’s major urban centers—Shanghai, Beijing, Hangzhou, Suzhou, and Nanjing, among them. 

Charged with interviewing a number of major Chinese cultural and political figures, Akutagawa hoped to get some answers to questions about die new intellectuals and their opposition to their cultural predecessors. Those interviews with several exceedingly famous Chinese intellectuals—Zhang Binglin 

Akutagawa Ryūnosuke and China

457

and Gu Hongming among them—are all but completely unknown to scholars of modem Chinese history. 

His travels in China came to an end in early July, and his health was all but mined by the trip. He wrote a number of travelogues from this trip. The two most famous of them, those of Shanghai and Beijing, are translated in the text that follows. They make for absorbing and altogether unexpected reading. 

Akutagawa was known for has tales of the bizarre and the thought-provok-ing, not for the overall sarcastic tone we see in these travelogues. His attitude borders on arrogance but without usually crossing that border, living at a time when it was as yet not imperative at every moment to remain on one’s guard in matters of cultural relativity, Akutagawa singly called everything as he saw it The early 1920s were, it should be underscored, a harsh time in China’s coming of age. For all the intellectual excitement of that time in China, there was massive and devastating urban and rural poverty. Akutagawa was not overly sympathetic, nor did he predict the collapse of China or call for Japan to become more involved on the mainland, as others of his countrymen had and would continue to do. 

It is precisely in the unexpected quality of these travel accounts that one pinpoints their uniqueness. One gets neither a hint or guide to Akutagawa’s other writings from these narratives, nor do they in any way typify the hundreds of other Japanese travelogues of China from the prewar era. The famous scholar of Chinese literature, Takeuchi Yoshimi \(1910–1977\), once noted that Akutagawa’s was his favorite piece of Japanese travel writing about China.1

Shortly after he returned home, Akutagawa tried his hand at setting a piece of fiction in a contemporary Chinese setting. In late 1925 or 1926, the year before his suicide, Akutagawa wrote the story Konan no ōgi \(The folding fan of Hunan\) winch began:

Aside from Sun Yat-sen who was born in Guangdong, the outstanding Chinese revolutionaries—Huang Xing, Cai E, and Song Jiaoren—were all born in Hunan. This was of course owing to the inspiration of Zeng Guofan and Zhang Zhidong. To explain this inspiration, we must consider the indefatigably strong will of the Hunanese people themselves. When I visited Hunan \[several years ago\], I had an almost fictional encounter, which may illustrate the dignity and deep passion of the Hunanese.

Akutagawa Ryūnosuke and China

Akutagawa’s storyteller,a Japanese doctor, goes on to describe his trip to Changsha, capital of Hunan Province. There he meets his former Tokyo University classmates Tan Yongnian, or “Tan the eternal,” perhaps a reference to another Hunanese martyr, Tan Sitong \(1865–1898\), and hence to all Hunanese and the undying spirit of reform in China. \(If the surname Tan is read in the Japanese way, it is pronounced hanashi or “story,” and this reading may carry the meaning of the “eternal story.”\) In any event, in Changsha they meet one Yu Lan, the woman lover of a rebel leader executed just a few days earlier. Tan offers the   narrator some biscuits that have been soaked in the blood of this fallen hero, saying that if he eats them, he will never become ill again. No one can stomach such borderline cannibalism except Yu Lan2 One should probably read this story as speaking directly to the enduring admiration Akutagawa had both for the Chinese who were intent on changing their dismal state and for such courageous Chinese women, though one may see a bit of the Akutagawa from his travels in China who would have balked at the sight of such a bizarre Chinese custom. 

In 1926 Gai Zun published a translation of selections from Akutagawa’s various travelogues of China in the journal Xiaoshuo yuebao \(Novel monthly 17.4, pp. 1–26\), recently brought to my attention by Professor Shih Shu-mei of the University of California, Los Angeles. In his brief introduction, Gai notes that a Japanese bookstore owner suggested he might want to read the original because of the “frequent ridicule directed by Japanese recently at your country.” 

Gai immediately read it and was captivated: “There are many places where the book mocks \[China\], but when discussing our domestic circumstances in all fairness, things are as he says.” Akutagawa may put it starkly, he concedes, but not unfairly, unless one insists on standing by exaggerations as if they were fact. And Gai was sufficiently moved that he chose to translate several selections from the work so that fellow Chinese would be able to read it. 

In addition to Shih Shu-mei, I would like to thnk Professor Ronald Egan of the University of California, Santa Barbara, and Professor Yeh Wen-hsin of the University of California, Berkeley, for help with Chinese literary and theatrical terms that appeared in the text, and Professor Gail Hershatter \(University of California, Santa Cruz\) and Professor Christian Henriot \(Université de Lyon\) for technical information on Shanghai prostitution.

**Confucian Pilgrim: Uno Tetsuto’s Travels in China**

In the preface to the account of his travels in China, Shina bunmei ki \(A Chronicle of Chinese Civilization\), written in the same month \(January 1912\) that the fledgling Republic of China was born, Uno Tetsuto \(1875–1974\), the renowned Sinologist, wrote:

The national conditions of China, that country which has maintained intimate contact with our land for well over a thousand years and which is separated from us by only a narrow strait, should already be quite clear to us. But, they are not clear at all. 

Those who understand China by reading her revered classics and sagely scriptures of antiquity may think that China is a paradise on Earth with sages and men of virtue wafting about like the clouds. Is China really a paradise? 

Based on their own limited experiences, men of the world often scorn the Chinese people and consider them ungrateful, immoral, and incorri-gible. Can we really dispense with the Chinese nation with such scorn? 

I originally wrote this book in the days of the Ch’ing dynasty \[1644–

1911\] and sent it to my parents back home in Japan; in it I discuss a variety of matters large and small, such as Chinese customs and practices, social conditions, famous places, and ancient sights. If, on the basis of this book, a glimpse of the national conditions of China is introduced to the world, then the honor is not only mine.1

What sort of false impressions or stereotypes of contemporary China was Uno trying to overcome and why? To whom was his lengthy travel account directed? Why had he traveled to China and what did travel to China mean for him? 

The Tokugawa bakufu lifted its ban on travel abroad in 1862 when the Senzaimaru, the first official ship sent on a mission to China in 223 years, set sail for Shanghai to investigate conditions there in the wake of the Opium War \(1839–1842\). In the years that followed, a number of brave souls and official 1  Uno Tetsuto, Shina bunmei ki \(Tokyo: Daidōkan, 1912\), 1–2.

Confucian Pilgrim: Uno Tetsuto’s Travels In China

emissaries journeyed to the mainland for a variety of reasons.2 Understandably, the first group to travel to China and report on what they found were Japanese scholars of Chinese history and culture, Kangakusha. Strictly speaking, several of those aboard the Senzaimaru,  such as Takasugi Shinsaku \(1839–1867\) and Hibino Teruhiro \(1838–1912\), were Kangakusha; but the genre of a Kangakusha travel account of China only began to take form in the next decade, even though elements of it can be found in their earlier accounts. 

2  Take, for example, the case of Sone Toshitora \(1847–1910\). One of the earliest advocates of genuine Sino-Japanese friendship, Sone was a naval officer who first went to China in 1873 

to accompany Foreign Minister Soejima Tar. omi on official business. See Kuzuu Yoshihisa, Tō-A senkaku shishi kiden \(Biographies of Pioneer Men of Spirit in East Asia\) \(Tokyo: Kokuryūkai shuppanbu, 1933–1936\), 316. He made many trips thereafter and enjoyed the friendship of such Chinese intellectuals as Wang T’ao and Feng Tzu-yu \(1882–1958\). The latter wrote of him: “Among the Japanese, Sone was the most concerned with Chinese affairs.” See Feng, Chung-hua min-kuo k’ai-kuo ch’ien ko-ming shih \(A History of the Revolution Before the Founding of the Republic of China\) \(Shanghai: Ko-ming shih pien-chi she, 1928\), vol. 1, p. 303. 

He made another trip to China late in 1874 and transcribed a long and detailed description of the activities of the Taiping rebels from a monk at the Ching-chi Temple. He also copied out a manifesto delivered in 1858 by Hung Hsiu-ch’üan \(1813–1864\) and his “kings.” 

And, he compiled yet another account when he returned in 1875 and 1876, describing his travels to Chinese and Korean port cities and military installations and his meetings with local officials; he also listed the prices of virtually every product in every place he visited, as well as the temperature and a whole host of other information. See Sone, Shinkoku manyūshi \(Record of Travels through China\) \(Tokyo: Sekibunsha, 1883\), as cited in Meiji ikō Nihonjin no Chūgoku ryokōki \(Japanese Travel Accounts of China from the Meiji Period On\) \(Tokyo: Tōyō 

bunko, 1980\), 1–2. 

Sone’s true motives remain murky, however, for recent research indicates that he was in fact passing all his information directly to the highest levels of the Japanese government and military. He wrote a report in 1881 that detailed the cargoes at various ports in China. See his Shinkoku kakkōbin ran \(An Overview of the Ports in China\) \(n.p., 1881\). In 1884, Sone was assigned as Japan’s official observer of the Sino-French conflict over Annam, and he criticized the Japanese government for failing to come to the aid of the Chinese. See his Hō- Etsu kōhei hi \(Record of Conflict Between France and Annam\), ed. Wang T’ao \(1886; reprinted, Taipei: Wen-hai ch’u-pan she, 1971\); and Paul Cohen, Between Tradition and Modernity: Wang T’ao and Reform in Late Ch’ing China \(Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1974\), 103–4. Yet, in this 1884 trip report, he provided a wealth of intelligence on the port of Yen-t’ai \(Shantung\), including troop and ship numbers and the speed and variety of the ships. He noted as well that Yen-t’ai would be the crux of a naval victory over the Ch’ing. When Port Arthur fell to the Japanese in 1894, Japanese forces attacked at Weihaiwei, near Yen-t’ai, where the Peiyang naval armada was crushed, just as Sone had hinted would be the case. See Kawamura Kazuo, 

“Kaigun taii Sone Toshitora no Shinkoku shisatsu ni tsuite” \(On Lieutenant Sone Toshitora’s Inspections of China\), Gunji shigaku \(December 1978\), 39:44–48. 

Confucian Pilgrim: Uno Tetsuto’s Travels In China 461

Takezoe Shin’ichirō \(1842–1917\) was one of the first Kangaku scholars to travel to China in the Meiji period. Following a trip of over three months there in 1876, he penned a lengthy account, composed in elegant Kanbun or literary Chinese, which he titled San’ un kyōu nikki \(A Diary of Clouds in the Mountain Pathways and Rain in the Ravines, published 1879\). Although Takezoe was attentive to local custom, water conservancy methods, and opium, among the more concrete realities he noted, the greater sense he conveys to readers of his account is of his having finally arrived in China, the motherland of culture as he saw it. He took great pains to make his account a lasting work of poetry and prose, not a mere travel guide; for this reason he wrote it in Chinese. He described contemporary China as a nation that had come down with a cold incorrectly diagnosed by the doctor. With proper treatment—and Takezoe applauded the modernization efforts he witnessed in China during the self-strengthening movement—the patient was sure to recover.3

The year 1884 marks the first watershed in changing Japanese attitudes toward China as revealed in this developing genre of travel accounts. The outbreak of the Sino-French War in 1884, the first major confrontation between an East Asian and a European power since the Opium War, prompted many Japanese travelers to publish reports. One of the results of China’s apparent defeat by the French and the loss of Annam was a general diminution of the grand image of China. A typical response of the time, although not the work of a Kangaku scholar, was that of Komuro Shinsuke who complained about the wartime exaggerations in the Chinese press, a characteristic he came to associate with the Chinese people generally. He also thought they were greedy, petty people with no sense of shame or integrity, concerned only with their personal advantage—the sort of condescending statement that could have been written by Arthur Smith or Père Huc, two of the more famous European travelers and commentators about China of the previous century.4

The most famous Japanese to visit China in 1884 was the Kangaku scholar Oka Senjin \(1832–1913\), and he remained there for an entire year. He composed his long and detailed account, Kankō kiyū \(Trip Report\), in Kanbun but without the devotion to China and her culture that one finds in the account of his forerunner Takezoe. Oka adopted a straightforward, descriptive style. The critical importance of his work is its place as the first severe critique of China by a Kangaku scholar, and it opened the door for others to follow. Adopting the familiar metaphor of illness, he diagnosed China’s disease as twofold: endoku \(the poison of smoke, or opium\) and keidoku \(the poison of the Chinese classics\). The former confronted Oka two days after arriving in Shanghai when he went to meet the famous Chinese reformer Wang T’ao \(1828–1897\) and was told by his intermediary, Kishida Ginkō \(the nefarious mainland adventurer, 1833–1905\), that Wang was indisposed, undoubtedly because of his opium addiction. Oka’s shock would give birth to a disillusionment with Chinese intellectuals generally. He questioned other Chinese closely about the extent of the opium problem, examined and described opium dens himself, and even witnessed the problem personally after a Chinese banquet. The experience left him thoroughly revolted. 

The problem of keidoku involved both Oka’s sense of a Chinese slavishness to antiquity and an essential and unhealthy Sinocentrism. Throughout his travels, Oka made use of the “brush conversation” \(Jap. hitsudan; Ch. pi-t’ an\), the primary means by which Chinese and Japanese who shared no spoken language communicated through the medium of written literary Chinese, the lingua franca throughout East Asia. He had many hitsudan with a wealthy chü-jen \(a scholar who had passed the second level of the imperial examinations\) by the name of Wang Yen-yün. Oka was horrified by the waste and prof-ligacy of the Wang household. At one point he said to scholar Wang that he felt Li Hung-chang’s \(1823–1901\) efforts to build Chinese industry and encourage commerce would be good for China as they had been for the West. Detecting Wang’s anger. Oka gave an example from the classics, something Kangaku scholars were never at a loss for, to demonstrate that the sages had used machines to help the people. Wang responded: “The French and the English are jackals and wolves. They have nothing to say on the subject of human principles.” After further, completely fruitless, discussion. Oka concluded: “Yen-yün is a strange man. As a scholar he is a rare talent indeed, but when he talks of foreign affairs, he becomes perverse, runs to extremes, and fails to understand.” 

Oka saw this as a general Chinese problem.5

What makes Oka’s case so interesting is that it was precisely the depth of his learning in traditional Chinese subjects that enabled him to enter elite Chinese society to a considerable extent and made it nearly impossible for his hosts to ignore him. By the same token, it meant a even starker realization of the depth of perceived decay in China. He was prepared to concede the personal, spiritual realm to Confucius and sons, but the physical realm belonged to modernization on the model of the Meiji reforms. Nothing could have brought the necessity of this dualism closer to home than a meeting he had in Shao-hsing with three Chinese students who explained in a perfectly rational frame of mind that solar eclipses were caused by a bullfrog eating the sun \(following a description in the Ch’un-ch’iu, or Spring and Autumn Annals\).6 It was sadly ironic that this long trip to China should produce a sustained attack on China from within the Kangaku fold. 

Oka queried many Chinese about what they planned to do in the war with France, and no one came up with a satisfactory answer. Sheng Hsüan-huai \(1844–1916\) threw the question back, asking if Japan would enter the war to assist China. Oka squirmed: “Japan is a small island country, and we are pru-dent in our intercourse with the West. Why should we cooperate with China and incur the animosity of France for no reason whatsoever?” The best route for Japan to take, Oka ultimately decided, was “secession” \(ridatsu\) from the Chinese cultural world, a view completely consistent with the famous formula of “dissociation from Asia” \(datsu-A\) elaborated the following year \(1885\) by Fukuzawa Yukichi \(1834–1901\).7

One equally scornful attitude can be found the same year in the trip account of the liberal intellectual Sugita Teiichi \(1851–1920\). Although earlier he had been favorably disposed to Sino-Japanese cooperation to confront the West, after his 1884 trip Sugita radically reformulated the issues. Either Japan would stand with China and be carved up, he claimed, or it would not only not stand aside but actually join in the carving of China. That year’s Sino-Japanese conflict over Korea, he argued, provided a pretext for just such an attack on China, and he urged immediate imperialist advances.8

Over the next two decades, greater access to travel in China by people from many different occupational groups led to a wide variety of responses to 6  See Takeuchi, “Meiji Kangakusha no Chūgoku kikō,” 258.

contemporary China. From his 1891–1892 trip to the Yangtze delta area, Andō 

Fujio, a Kangaku scholar and journalist, put together an altogether new kind of travel account. Composed of newspaper articles describing his experiences in China, Andō’s Shina manyū jikki \(True Account of a Voyage to China\) was explicitly written to enable the Japanese to expand their commercial and shipping interests. Since no sufficient guides to China’s geography existed, he sought to fill the lacunae, adding a wealth of information on Chinese commercial organization, local foods and clothing, and practices in marriage, funerals, and religion. Although he counseled diligence and frugality by Japanese enterprises, he also encouraged unity among like industries so as to demonstrate Japanese resolve to the Chinese. Continuing the metaphor of illness employed earlier by Takezoe and Oka, Andō spoke of China as a “sick old man” \(yameru rōya\) and Japan as a “lively youth” \(katsuratsutaru shōnen\);   were China to decline farther, Japan could step in and take over, he noted.9

This sort of openly instrumental view of China was prevalent but hardly typical of the 1890s. No one, Japanese or Chinese, could deny that China was in serious trouble, but there was no single response to that dilemma in Japan or China. Miyauchi Isaburō confronted the same situation when he went to China in 1892, and his response is perhaps more typical of the confused mixture among Kangakusha of cultural Sinophilia and political Sinophobia: Although the cowardice of this people is well known to everyone, no nation opened its doors earlier, has more territory or greater population, gave rise to more wise men and heroic figures, or produced cultural relics earlier than the people of continental China. Men of letters have recited widely all the many sorts of things that we Japanese have copied from them in the past. Thus, we must be careful when we look at contemporary Chinese politics or trade. . . . Three hundred years have passed since then \[i.e., the founding of the Ch’ing dynasty\], and although the imperial throne has already been handed down consecutively for more than ten generations, the Chinese state has now fallen into decay and has become the laughingstock of the world.10

His account features information on seventy-seven items, from public works projects and agriculture to religious practices, military conditions, opium, women, currency, and poisonous snakes. 

Okakura Tenshin \(1862–1913\) spent the latter half of 1893 in China, and he either ignored or simply missed the harsher side of life in China altogether. Sent by the Imperial Household Department to investigate Chinese art, he concentrated on museums and curio shops and traveled about in Chinese dress with his hair in a queue. From his subsequent speeches and writings that mention his travels, we can isolate several conclusions he reached. While holding to his favorite slogan that “Asia was one,” Okakura came to believe that there was no one “China” \(Shina ni Shina nashi\),  namely, that the cultures of the Yellow and the Yangtze Rivers were sufficiently different to warrant a basic distinction.11

As the nineteenth century came to an close, China increasingly began to attract the type of person who fashioned himself rugged. The popular image of China as an age-old country, extremely poor, and much in need of modern conveniences emerged at this time, largely because of the picture of China presented in travel reports. Also, organizations of Japanese adventurers cropped up throughout China beginning in the mid-1890s. When Takase Bintoku arrived in 1902, he insisted on traveling on foot. He noted that Chinese streets were dirty, workers and coolies looked like beggars, and the general populace was filthy and insensate—all images soon to become elemental to any portrait of China then. While a few lived in grand elegance, the lower classes enjoyed an extremely low level of hygiene. And, here was a severe problem for China: Chinese society had no healthy middle ranks \(chūtō shakai\), also a common view over the next few decades. After a lengthy description of life in China, particularly in Peking, Takase came to the conclusion that China was not a 

“nation” \(kokka\) but had 400 million individuals and four thousand-year-old 11  Okakura Tenshin, “Shina nanboku no kubun’ \(The Difference Between North and South China\), Kokka \(March 1894\), 54, reprinted in Okakura Tenshin zenshū \(The Collected Works of Okakura Tenshin\) \(Tokyo: Seibunkaku, 1939\), 191–98; Saitō Ryūzō, Okakura Tenshin \(Tokyo: Yoshikawa kōbunkan, 1960\), 73–78; Kiyomi Rikurō, Okakura Tenshin \(Tokyo: Heibonsha, 1934\), 70–87; Okakura Kazuo, Chichi Okakura Tenshin \(My Father, Okakura Tenshin\) \(Tokyo: Chūō kōron sha, 1971\), 84–104; Hashikawa Bunzō, “Fukuzawa Yukichi to Okakura Tenshin” \(Fukuzawa Yukichi and Okakura Tenshin\), in Takeuchi Yoshimi and Hashikawa Bunzō, eds., Kindai Nihon to Chūgoku \(Modern Japan and China\) \(Tokyo: Asahi shinbun sha, 1974\), vol. 1, pp. 27, 29–32; and Takeuchi Minoru, “Ajia wa hitotsu nari: Okakura Tenshin to Izuru” \(Asia Is One: Okakura Tenshin and Izuru\), in Takeuchi, Kikō Nihon no naka no Chūgoku \(China in Travel Accounts of Japan\) \(Tokyo: Asahi shinbun sha, 1976\), 65–85. 

466

Confucian Pilgrim: Uno Tetsuto’s Travels In China

customs; in the same breath he claimed, apparently unaware of the non sequi-tur, that the Chinese “nation” was headed for extinction. He called on all foreign \(read Japanese\) educators, religious leaders, and businessman to pursue their lines of work in China.12

Among the more famous and undoubtedly the most obnoxious travel account of the late Meiji period was that of the journalist Tokutomi Sohō 

\(1863–1957\). No sooner had he arrived in Manchuria en route to Peking than he wrote home to say that merchants in An-tung expressed what appeared to be genuine thankfulness for the protection to their property and persons now available because of Japanese domination in the region. He arrived in the Chinese capital just when “the rights recovery fever had reached 40°C.” 

Agreeing with an unnamed English reporter who claimed that the Chinese defiance of the civilized powers derived from this xenophobic fever, he concluded that “‘rights recovery’ may be the other side of xenophobia.” And, revealing his true colors, Tokutomi added: “Where will this . . . movement end? 

Perhaps it will unite with the antiforeign movement of the lower classes? Is such an apprehension needless anxiety? I hope it is.”13

He generally concluded that China lacked the concept of nation, a rapidly developing idea about China in Japan. He had looked hard for a Chinese sense of commonality, and all he could find was effeminacy, lack of skill and drive, and a virtual cult of despair. Although clever in planning in their own self-interest and thoroughly opportunistic, he claimed, the Chinese were, in the final analysis, untrustworthy, again virtually the identical superficial conclusions of Père Huc and Arthur Smith, two famous missionary-travelers in China some decades earlier. “In sum,” he concluded, “China is in a state of transition at present . . . But, will she be able . . . to form a national unity and raise a national spirit, while at the same time joining in the life and thought shared by the civilized nations and become a great and powerful state? This is the gravest of my many doubts.”14 In later years travel accounts of China by Kangaku scholars became the most pedantic subgenre in this entire vast literature. Every sight, every stele, every mountain or village elicited a veritable outpouring of historic and cultural information of interest largely to people who already knew it all.

Furthermore, such information was always presented as if the author were gushing forth with quotations from the Shih chi \(Record of the Grand Historian\) or poems by Su Tung-p’o \(1037–1101\) that hung on the tip of his tongue; in fact, it was perfectly clear that he had packed his account just before publication back in Japan, where he had access to his library. Nonetheless, we would be hard-pressed now to imagine the excitement such men, who had lived Chinese history and the Chinese classics entirely from written texts \(many of them memorized just as Chinese scholars had memorized them for centuries\), must have felt as they actually came into personal contact with “China.” 

This revelatory \(in many cases, self-congratualatory\) style, however, was still novel and fresh in the decade \(1897–1906\) preceding Uno Tetsuto’s travels. 

During this decade several remarkable Kangaku scholars with formidable credentials in traditional Chinese learning traveled to China for the first time and left marvelous accounts of their experiences. Where earlier Kangaku travelers had been shocked by the reality of a China wholly different from their unre-alistic expections, just as Uno expected they might in his introduction, this group had both the advantage of much more information about contemporary China and the opportunity to read the accounts of earlier travelers, including Takezoe and Oka. However, they also were burdened with the developing negative images of China we have seen. 

Yamamoto Baigai \(1852–1928\) devoted his academic life to traditional Chinese scholarship, particularly to the histories and the Tzu-chih t’ung-chien \(Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Government\) of Ssu-ma Kuang \(1019–1089\), which he allegedly read six times. He was also an activist in the popular rights movement of the Meiji period and was centrally involved in the Osaka Incident, in which a number of Japanese were arrested for involvement in plotting a coup in Korea. Over a decade later in the fall of 1897, he seized an opportunity to travel through China’s major cities for several months. In many ways, his account of that trip is typical of Kangaku travelers—inclusion of capsule histories of every sight, every statue, every hillock visited, and usually with quotations from Chinese texts. Entitled Enzan sosui kiyū \(Chronicle of a Trip to the Mountains of North China and the Rivers of South China\), it was also the last of this subgenre to be written completely in Kanbun. 

Yamamoto’s extraordinary ability in Kanbun and his journalistic contacts in China enabled him to enjoy considerable contact with Chinese reformers, such as Wang K’ang-nien \(1860–1911\), Liang Ch’i-ch’ao \(1873–1929\), and Chang Chien \(1853–1926\), as well as with the conservative scholar Lo Chen-yü \(1866–1940\). 

His discussions in China were all recorded in his account, which expressed general agreement with the reformist movement. Back in Japan he maintained contacts with his Chinese friends for many years, particularly when Liang and 

468

Confucian Pilgrim: Uno Tetsuto’s Travels In China

his mentor K’ng Yu-wei \(1858–1927\) were forced to flee there from China at the end of 1898. Yamamoto later organized a Sino-Japanese Cooperative Society, and he offered help to Liang’s publishing efforts from Japan. When asked by the Foreign Ministry, in view of his close association with the Chinese reformers, to inform Liang and K’ang that the Japanese government was expelling them, Yamamoto simply retused.15

Naitō Konan \(1866–1934\), a figure of legendary proportions in prewar Japanese Sinology, made his first voyage to China proper in the late summer and fall of 1899. I have dealt with his trip account, Enzan sosui \(The Mountains of North China and the Rivers of South China\) in detail elsewhere16 and will be brief here. Like Yamamoto’s similarly titled work, Naitō embellished his account with countless historical and classical references, as if to remind himself that he was actually visiting the same China that he had so long studied. 

Among the many prominent Chinese reformers and intellectuals with whom he “conversed” in Kanbun were Yen Fu \(1853–1921\), Wen T’ing-shih \(1856–1904\), Chang Yüan-chi \(1866–1959\), Liu Hsüeh-hsün, and Lo Chen-yü. Their discussions covered many topics but always, perhaps because Naitō was so insistent, returned to the problems of rulership in contemporary China and what role Japan might play in helping China reform itself.17

Despite his insistence that Japan play a role, even if only as a model, and despite his negative remarks about the general state of hygiene there, Naitō 

retained an enormous respect for China and the Chinese, as witnessed by several sketches appended to his trip report. In part, this was because of a frozen image of “China,” the motherland of culture itself, in the words of Takezoe Shinʾichirō. Naitō’s realization that China had severe problems, from opium addiction and footbinding to the lack of an adequate sewer system in Peking, 15  Masuda Wataru, “Yamamoto Ken \(Baigai\),” in Masuda, Seigaku tōzen to Chūgoku jijō \(The Spread of Western Learning to the East and Conditions in China\), 322–25, 330–33, 337–42

never led him to reject China, as it had Oka Senjin and Sugita Teiichi fifteen years earlier. In fact, it never led him to the despair of the writer Lu Hsün \(1881–

1936\), who would soon describe the entire history of Chinese culture as that of cannibalism. His understanding of its ills went too deep for such an extreme response. Also, by the turn of the century the times had changed, and to reject China in the manner of Oka and Sugita usually carried pro-Westernization political baggage with it \(as in the case of Tokutomi Sohō\), anathema to someone of Naitō Konan’s education and proclivities. 

This background should help explain the many different images Uno Tetsuto was trying to overcome when he set down to write his fascinating Shina bunmei ki.  Although he allegedly based his report on his eighteen months of study in Peking \(1906–1907\), his actual travels occupied only a few months of his time on the mainland. As indicated by his title, this was not merely a simple trip report from China, as so many others had written; it was to be a descriptive account of the state of Chinese civilization. Uno had graduated from Tokyo Imperial University in 1900 and would become full professor there in 1918. Although barely thirty years old when he set out, Uno was already extraordinarily learned in classical Chinese traditions, citations from which appear on virtually every page of his work. He had already published several books in his major field of expertise, Chinese philosophy, especially of the Sung period. He returned to Japan for nearly seventy more years of prodigious scholarly productivity.18

As Uno’s account begins, one is easily led to believe that what follows will be the typical Kangakusha’s chronicle of each and every stone \(and its history\) in China, punctuated only by an occasional statement of irritation with the 18  Before his appointment at Tokyo Imperial University, Uno taught Kanbun for a time at the high-school level, where among his pupils was a young Morohashi Tetsuji \(1883–1983\). 

For nearly two decades, he and Hattori Unokichi \(1867–1939\) were the two pillars of learning in Chinese philosophy at Tokyo University. In 1931 he became dean of the Faculty of Letters; in 1936 he retired became professor emeritus. From 1939 to 1944 he traveled to Peking annually to give lectures on Chinese philosophy, and he was named a professor emeritus of Peking University in 1939. His publications and annotated translations are numerous; and two Festschriften were published in his honor, one on his eighty-eighth birthday and one on his ninety-ninth.

Chinese. At sea for several days before landing at the port of T’ang-ku in Hopeh province \(near Tientsin\), Uno expresses genuine sadness at the horrific sight of people’s homes, constructed of mud, built right by the water—“they looked more like pig sties.” But he is revived when he sees, fluttering in the wind, a Hinomaru \(the Japanese flag\), as if reassured that one might find civilized comforts even in T’ang-ku. This is no place, he notes in fairness, to get a first impression of China. Uno’s next stop is Tientsin, where life appears much better to his eye, and then on to Peking, which is even better.19

Uno makes Peking his headquarters, and from there he begins a series of trips throughout China. His descriptions of people, places, roadside stands and their wares, fruits for sale, theater, local festivals, and the like are all interesting, but they read now like an almanac. In fact, Takeuchi Minoru has suggested that Uno’s descriptions are so thick that he may have simply borrowed much of his information from an almanac published at this time in China by Tun Li-ch’en, the Yen-ching sui-shih-chi \(Almanac of Yen-ching\).20 In other words, the material in the first 125 pages of Uno’s nearly four hundred-page travel account provides interesting reading in the way that an encyclopedia provides interesting reading. However, the atmosphere suddenly changes at this point. 

On September 4, 1906, shortly after arriving in China, Uno leaves Tientsin by ship, although he does not mention his destination. The next day he arrives at noon in Cheefu \(Chih-fu\), where the sight of numerous Japanese ships in dock proves especially comforting to him. The next day he boards a German vessel that carries him past the Shantung peninsula south. On the morning of September 7, the ship docks in Tsingtao, and Uno disembarks to check in at, reportedly, the only Japanese inn there. \(Several years later, after Japan seized German holdings in Tsingtao during World War I, Tsingtao would be overwhelmed by Japanese businesses, tourists, and traders.\) Although Uno is unable to control his penchant for introducing historical tidbits into the sights thus far seen on this side trip, the account takes on an altogether different flavor in Shantung. 

From Tsingtao, Uno boards a train bound for Tsinan. On the train, he finds himself uncomfortably surrounded for over twelve hours by Chinese and 19  Uno, Shina bunmei ki, 2–10.

several Englishmen. The Chinese, he reports, were particularly talkative and 

“extremely bothersome” \(hanahada urusai\),   although he admits that he was not offended by them. An occasional mention of an ancient Chinese text and a reference to Mencius’s well-known meeting with King Hsüan of Ch’i \(which had allegedly occurred nearby\)—still, Uno offers not a hint as to where he is headed. 

Upon arrival in Tsinan, Uno hires a rickshaw, his third mode of transport, each one progressively more primitive, to convey him to the home of a local Japanese resident. There he meets several other Japanese for a “circle of unexpected satisfaction.” For five days \(September 8–12\), this Japanese resident shows him the sights of Tsinan and introduces him to Governor Yang Shih-hsiang, with whom he exchanges pleasantries. On the morning of the thirteenth, he departs Tsinan, this time by horse-drawn carriage, which arrives on the afternoon of the fourteenth in T’ai-an-fu. Highly attentive to propriety, Uno pays his respects to the local prefectural magistrate, Yü Kou, immediately upon arrival.21

The next morning he rises at dawn to climb Mount T’ai \(actually, he is carried up bodily, his fifth and most ancient mode of hired transport\). From there he can see all around him, and now it becomes clear what this trip is really all about. He has returned, figuratively, to the fount of civilization itself. He has retraced the steps of progress back to its origins in the homeland of Confucius and Mencius. Just as Confucius climbed the sacred Mount T’ai and saw how small the realm appeared from its summit, so too does Uno Tetsuto some two thousand and five hundred years later. No longer is this travel account a historical almanac. It suddenly is transformed into the record of a Confucian pilgrimage. Now, even when Uno recounts historical and geographical details, they take on added philosophical, virtually religious, meaning. They now enhance his chronicle rather than simply occupy space. 

From this point forward, every single sight elicits a profoundly meaningful impression in his ‘memory,” as his classical education comes alive. Leaving the glorious Mount T’ai, he travels for several days by land and river, again not mentioning where he is headed until he arrives. And, then, Ch’ü-fu appears in the distance:

The yellow roof tiles that I saw high in the city were the those of the Temple of Confucius \(Sheng-miao\).  The azure tiles to its left were probably the Temple to Yen Hui \[Confucius’s disciple\). A forest of cypress 21  Uno, Shina bunmei ki, 125–58, citations on pp. 130, 132, respectively. 

472

Confucian Pilgrim: Uno Tetsuto’s Travels In China

densely surround the city to the north and form a wall there—this was, without a doubt, the Chih Sheng \[Great Sage\] Forest. 

Then, continuing in this euphoric vein, Uno reports \(without a trace of arrogance\): “It was as if we were a band of Crusaders, just arrived in ecstacy, looking at Jerusalem.”22

Uno’s rapture takes on religious fervor when he actually enters Ch’ü-fu and stands before the Temple of Confucius: “I was born in a land of decorum across the Eastern Sea \(Tōen kunshikoku\); separated spatially by several thousand li and temporally by over three thousands years, I have revered this place and looked up to it for many years. Today, whatever day it is, I visited the Temple of Confucius and gazed upon the Chih Sheng Forest.”23 Throughout his travel account, Uno is meticulous about recording not only the day of the events but the time as well. At the Temple of Confucius, it is not that he failed to remember the day—“whatever day it is”—but that the actual date had no meaning. 

The spirit of Confucius had inhabited these environs for ages, and the particular date of Uno’s appearance there had no special importance; it was for all time. It was, in fact, September 18, 1906, a date Uno himself supplies several lines later. One can sense at this point Uno’s joy as he inhaled the same air as Confucius and prayed at the Confucian Temple: “Unconsciously, I bowed my head as if I were closely approaching the spirit of the Sage. Without looking I saw his spirit; without listening I heard his voice. And my insignificant little body immediately became absorbed in the great spirit of the Sage.”24

Lest the reader of this account doubt that Uno actually saw what he claims to have seen, four photographs \(an important addition to travel writing\) from Ch’ü-fu and neighboring Tsou county are inserted in the text at this point, including those of the gravestones of Confucius and Mencius, each with an explanatory caption. Once inside the Temple of Confucius, every single plaque to the disciples of Confucius is described. Not only do the classics come alive for Uno as he walks around these buildings and stelae, but he begins to feel as though he too is walking with the disciples of the Sage. When he visits the Chih Sheng Forest, his concludes his detailed depiction with the words: “The spirit . . . of the great sage Confucius fills the atmosphere \[there\] with its permanence . . . and brilliantly illuminates public morality.”25

Confucian Pilgrim: Uno Tetsuto’s Travels In China 473

When he returns to his inn, Uno finds that his view of the religious centrality of Ch’ü-fu to East Asia is corroborated by County Magistrate Liu, albeit for somewhat different reasons. “Our Ch’ü-fu,” complains Liu, “is  comparable to the West’s Jerusalem, although Confucianism \[K’ung-chiao\]  and Christianity 

\[ Ye-chiao\] cannot be mentioned in the same breath. . . . In the Book of Genesis it states that the omnipotent God created Heaven, earth, and all creatures and that, on the seventh day, he rested. This is a most irrational, laughable matter. There has yet to be a Christian believer in Ch’ü-fu.”26 Liu’s evocation of Jerusalem is nationalistic and antiforeign; he was angry about foreign concessions in nearby Liao-chou-wan. This was not Uno’s concern in the least, and he quickly diverts his discussion to another topic. 

“Does the legacy of Confucius and Mencius,” asks Uno for the second time, 

“still exist in the land of Lu?” “No,” answers Liu, “our scholars prattle about Confucius and Mencius, but it’s all just chatter.” Uno offers his reader not a clue as to his reaction to this stark response, unless we read something into the absence of a comment. But Uno is only learning, slowly, what he will later include in his introduction \(cited at the outset\): that China of the classics is not the China of today. He has elicited his image of China not from newspapers or current events but from late Chou dynasty texts. As he leaves Shantung province on his way toward Kaifeng, he sadly notes: “Because \[the state of\] Lu was the site of the graves of the sages, I expected to find their legacies in as pure and simple form as in antiquity. I was greatly disappointed.”27

The rest of this side trip, to Kaifeng and elsewhere in Honan before returning to Peking, is all epilogue. In fact the next 175 pages, which include seven side trips, revert to the earlier tone of this travel account. His style becomes that of a diary; the dates are no longer incidental to his experiences and so integrated into the account \(let alone unimportant as on that one day in Ch’ü-fu\), but they become the organizers of the events described. The result is considerably less of Uno’s personal and immediate responses to China and considerably more detail, history, poetry, stone inscriptions—and, less exciting reading, to be sure. The trip to Shantung was obviously the centerpiece of his entire stay in China; it was his first substantial sidetrip from his base in Peking, and he never returned there. 

The final 150 pages of the text are topical essays in which Uno assesses aspects of life in China and thirteen qualities he associates with the Chinese 

“national character” \(kokuminsei\).  These essays represent his effort to sort out what he observed and to enter that information coherently back into his mind 26  Ibid., 154. 

27  Ibid., 155, 163. 

474

Confucian Pilgrim: Uno Tetsuto’s Travels In China

in such a way that his world view would not be destroyed. In other words, he came to China with the classics in his head; he confronted Chinese realities that seemed to conflict with the purity and perfection of those classics; and then he returned to Japan with a vision of two radically distinct Chinas. In no way did contemporary China injure his mental picture of antiquity; the latter remained completely frozen and idealized. But he was at least able to separate the two and see the need to reintegrate them. 

Uno’s travel account shares certain elements both with earlier Japanese travel and pilgrimage literature and with the pilgrimage literature of medieval Europe, and reference to those bodies of material may help explain some of the seeming disjunctures in slyle and presentation of Uno’s record. One of the earliest Japanese accounts of foreign travel was the diary of the monk Ennin \(793–864\), Nit-Tō guhō junrei gyōki \(The Record of a Pilgrimage to China in Search of the Buddhist Law\). But, if one reads through this long account with any expectation of gaining an insight into the mind of Ennin, then one reads in vain. This was his account of a religious quest, and he allowed little of himself to intrude. When the priest Shunjō wrote his account of pilgrimage to Zenkōji in 1225, he similarly says virtually nothing of the scenery along the way, undoubtedly because it was superfluous to his intent in writing and, indeed, in traveling.28

As became clearer with subsequent travel and pilgrimage literature in Japan, the reason for such travel was not pleasure, not even of the beauty of a given temple; the idea was to commune directly with the spirit of a divine place. One could pray anywhere, and there were temples and shrines throughout Japan for that purpose, but to go to the source was also seen as the best. 

Matsuo Bashō \(1644–1694\) put it succintly and much more poetically, if in a more secular vein:

Mountains crumble, rivers flow away, roads are changed, stones are buried and hide in the earth, trees grow old and give way to saplings, times passes and the world changes. Everything is uncertain, but coming here and seeing an inscription that without doubt was a thousand years old, I felt I was now seeing before me the minds of the men of old.29

Confucian Pilgrim: Uno Tetsuto’s Travels In China 475

The literature on accounts of European pilgrimages is even richer. Pilgrimage was an extremely important institution in late medieval times. Although the Church made allowances for pilgrimage to secondary holy places, such as Rome or Canterbury, the Jerusalem pilgrimage was in a class by itself, necessitating for the truly pious a long voyage \(much as travel from Japan all the way to China must have been in Ennin’s day\). There are hundreds of pilgrimage accounts; and it is this genre that was most responsible for making the metaphor of travel for life itself elemental to early European fiction, from Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales, to Thomas More’s Utopia, to Jonathan Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels, and numerous works by Daniel Defoe.30

Christian pilgrims had a unilinear sense of history. Getting to the Holy Land was the essential, indeed the only, reason for travel \(and travel writing\). 

The return trip home was altogether less important. In fact, this may be why Chaucer never had his pilgrims recount their promised second tales on the return voyage. The process of getting to the Holy Land and the experiences there were all that mattered; thus, every step along the way was worthy of mention. Once there, the Holy Land set off countless images from the past, as recorded in the Bible and associated apocrypha. This was where Jesus had walked and preached and died. Time collapsed. Every sight and sound deserved translation into written form. And, when it was over, there was no purpose, save sinful egotism, in telling the story of the trip home.31

There was always an uneasy balance between the Church’s willingness to allow pilgrimages and the sin of curiosity \(travel and observation for its own intrinsic sake\). In a study of fourteenth-century British pilgrimage literature, Christian Zacher notes: “Pilgrimage was a theological idea and a cultural phenomenon—but above all it was a religious institution, a devotional practice which let pious Christians travel through the physical world only because their destinations were places sanctified by spiritual, otherworldly associations.” By the end of the Middle Ages, however, the “pilgrimage” had become a thinly veiled excuse to see the outside world itself.32

Confucian Pilgrim: Uno Tetsuto’s Travels In China

At the end of the fifteenth century, a change transpired in the writing of pilgrim accounts, which Donald Howard associates with a transition from medieval to modern times. Now, pilgrims do include sections in their records that concern the trip home, and the return trip becomes an essential element of the trip itself. It is still not a record of the experiences of that return; rather, it involves the lessons learned, the fresh smells of home, and security from the perils of the journey. It becomes a time for summing up the experience of the pilgrimage, and it allows the author a personal voice beyond that of mere observer. By the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, curiosity is no longer a sin, but an intellectual strength. The betterment of the self through travel and the return of the pilgrim from the Holy Land to his point of departure are now far more important to the traveler than communing with some relic in Jerusalem.33

The travel account of Uno Tetsuto similarly centers entirely on the experiences of getting to and absorbing Ch’ü-fu \(the Jerusalem of East Asia\) and its surroundings; the rest of his account by comparison pales in vibrancy. In fact, the rest of the account could easily have been written without ever having been in China. Travel to China was not like going to the South Pole or the far side of the moon; as a Kangaku scholar, Uno “knew” China thoroughly before he ever left Japan, just as pilgrims to the Holy Land “knew” the Land of Israel. 

Both relied exclusively on ancient texts. 

Uno’s excitement as he sees Chinese soil from aboard his approaching ship, just as had been the case with Naitō Konan several years earlier, parallels European pilgrimage literature. For example, the longest and most thoroughly detailed pilgrim account of the fifteenth century was that of Felix Fabri, a Franciscan monk. Brother Felix describes the great joy \(weeping, singing, and the like\) of his group of pilgrims when they saw the Holy Land for the first time from sea.34

Every sight in the Holy Land, and every problem encountered aboard ship on the way there, was recorded by Brother Felix, because everything became important Nor was his merely a detailed listing of what passed before his eyes. As we have seen, Uno too had a penchant for descriptive detail, but the cataloguing of sights and sounds in Peking before his trip to Shantung and his many side trips after returning to Peking is qualitatively different from the ecstacy with which he presented the innumerable sights of Shantung. 

Felix Fabri’s account was also the first pilgrimage chronicle that contained a detailed record of the return voyage. There he laid out the lessons learned as 33  Howard, Writers and Pilgrims, 42–43, 45, 48, 106–7. 

34  Uno, Shina bunmei ki, 2;  Howard, Writers and Pilgrims, 36–44. 

Confucian Pilgrim: Uno Tetsuto’s Travels In China 477

he reentered his life back home. One rarely made a second pilgrimage, so this event was to have inspirational meaning for the rest of one’s mortal existence. 

Although Uno does not describe his return to Japan, he does append several lengthy essays about “the Chinese” in which he tries to explain the source of all their problems in an effort to introduce the contemporary bearers of a once-great civilization to his fellow Japanese. 

In part this represents an attempt to domesticate “the Chinese” for the Japanese readership. Uno knew well how culturally indebted Japan was to China, and sorting out what that implied for the contemporary era—the lessons for the present following his trip to China—was highly important. Japan owed its greatness in many regards to its inheritance of mainland traditions, but Japan could only learn by negative example from contemporary China. In part these appended essays represent as well Uno’s own effort to make sense out of what he had experienced in China, an attempt to merge the China of the classics with the real China of his day. Because this effort was largely futile and indeed occasioned by a series of experiences external to China, the result is often bizarre, even confusing; although some pearls of wisdom are strewn throughout these essays, ultimately they inform us much more about Japan and Japanese concerns than about China. Many would argue this applies to all travel literature. 

The four essays about “the Chinese” all aim to explain customs, institutions, and behavioral patterns. Their topics are: the Chinese family system, social welfare enterprises, the concept of “revolution” \(Jap. kakumei; Ch. koming\),  

and the national character of “the Chinese.” Lest there be any doubt about the principal intent of these essays, Uno begins the first of them: “Because China was the wellspring of our Japanese culture, we must study the Chinese family system to speak intelligently about the Japanese family, ancient and modern.” 

He then moves immediately to make an important distinction, one he shared with other Kangakusha of the time. It is wrong, he contends, to ridicule China for the present decline in political authority of the Chinese state; the government may have no power, but “the Chinese people” indeed remain an influential “ethnic group” \(minzoku\).  This point leads Uno to the central theme of these four essays: “My feeling is that as a state China’s lack of prosperity has been due to an age-old democracy \[minshushugi\], the changes of dynastic control \[Jap. ekisei kakumei; Ch. i-hsing ko-ming\], and the lack of a unifying authority under a fixed sovereign.”35 Japanese readers, for whom this account was of course written, would immediately recognize the implicit comparison Uno has drawn here between China \(with its seemingly endless string of changing 35  Uno, Shina bunmei ki, 343–44. 

478

Confucian Pilgrim: Uno Tetsuto’s Travels In China

dynasties\) and Japan \(with its one, unbroken line still sitting on the throne, descended from the Sun Goddess\). 

He goes on to say that one reason there is still an entity known as “China,” 

despite countless changes of dynasties, lies in the strength of the Chinese family as the moral fabric of society. This would have been an interesting point to investigate; but, rather than proceed to examine the contemporary Chinese family, or even to make a series of observations, Uno immediately begins citing ancient texts, such as the Hsiao-ching \(Classic of Filial Piety\), and speaking in stereotypical generalities about such personal qualities as “filiality.” While we may expect too much if we look for modern sociological analyses in Uno’s account, by the same token we should note that one need not go to China to quote from the Hsiao-ching, as Japanese had done for centuries. In order to make sense of the distinctive qualities of the Chinese family, Uno does what many of us would probably do: draw on our knowledge of our own culture and note the comparison with the case in China. 

In Japan the imperial family embodies the principle of a large family uniting the entire nation into a single group. Thus, the thorough consistency of loyalty \(chū\) and filial piety \(kō\) exists as an absolute truth \(zettai no shinri\) in Japan. But China is different. There, because of centuries of changing dynastic control, this concept of the family writ large has not taken root, and the unity of loyalty and filiality has not fully developed among the populace. This, I believe, is the greatest cause for China’s weakness as a state.36

The second essay on China’s social welfare institutions begins on the same note of the sad fate that China’s “national polity” \(kokutai\) has long been highly democratic, understood as meaning the unstable state structure always subject to rebellion by the people. The very idea of the changeability of Heaven’s will that one finds in the Chinese classics speaks directly to the essential 

“democratic” nature of Chinese civilization. Again, this thesis requires a state-society bifurcation: “In spite of its also having an autocratic state, China has long been a democracy, and the spirit of autonomy \[among the local populace\] has remained vibrant.” The modern Western reader \(indeed, many contemporary Chinese readers as well\) are likely to read all their own democratic biases into this sentence and think Uno was celebrating China’s democratic heritage. Far from it, for democracy was the root of so many of China’s ills, in his estimation. 

36  Ibid., 344–46, 348, citation on p. 350. 

Confucian Pilgrim: Uno Tetsuto’s Travels In China 479

Real power in China, he continues, lies not with the central authorities but with the local gentry \(kyōshin\),   for they are the ones who have contact with the Chinese people. Because of this Chinese democracy and the inattentive rule of the central government, local Chinese society \(under the leadership of local gentry families\) had taken it upon itself, he notes, to establish social and philanthropic institutions.37

After a fascinating list and description of these institutions, Uno finds himself painted into a corner. He has noted several times in his account and will soon repeat that the Chinese are by nature egotistical and individualistic. 

But, we now see that they have probably the most developed system of social philanthropy in the world. Several platitudes about state and society do not elucidate this contradiction. It reflects his own efforts to understand, while simultaneously trying to explain, qualities of life in China for which a thorough knowledge of the classics provides little help. The contradictions here are important in and of themselves, for they slowly become the main story. 

The third essay repeats all the empty generalizations about national character and “revolution” that Uno has already laid out above. He does interject the caveat that it is difficult to speak of Chinese national traits because of regional differences, something he reiterates constantly in the travelogue section of his account. He even admits that “it may be impossible” to depict a Chinese national character. Then, without so much as a paragraph break, he begins to do the “impossible.” After a rather idiosyncratic reading of late imperial Chinese history, the ultimate cause of all China’s problems is once again laid at the door of the country’s changing dynastic fortunes. Despite three thousand or more years of autocratic government, he claims, the Chinese classics, histories, and poetry are imbued with a thoroughly democratic spirit—and, therein lies China’s tragedy.38

How, then, if the entire Chinese tradition is to be labeled “democratic,” 

can one speak of the influence of Confucianism in Japan, which decidedly does not share this democratic propensity? This is no easy matter for Uno. He has been citing text after text to prove how different the Chinese and their historical experience are from the Japanese and theirs. Although this democratic form of government fits the Chinese well, indeed is the root of contemporary China’s tragedy, he argues, it is qualitatively different from Confucius’s key idea of “serving one’s king” \(sonnō\).  Thus, Uno distinguishes Confucius from his “democratic” epigones, Mencius and Hsün-tzu. In later ages, the prodemo-cratic, prorevolutionary ideas introduced by Mencius and others of the late 37  Ibid., 353–56, citation on p. 354. Naitō Konan was coming to similar conclusions at precisely the same time. 

38  Ibid., 362–68, citation on p. 363. 

480

Confucian Pilgrim: Uno Tetsuto’s Travels In China

Chou period held sway in China, while the teachings of Confucius never fully developed in the Sage’s own homeland. Only in Japan did those teachings find a natural home, further proof of the perfection of the Japanese kokutai.  39

This reading of the history of Chinese thought sets the stage for Uno’s delineation of the thirteen character traits of the Chinese, the longest, most revealing, and most contorted of his appended essays. Their first characteristic, expectedly, is “democratic.” Uno repeats all his major claims about how the followers of Confucius twisted his most brilliant insight \(that of fidelity to one’s sovereign\); as a result, subsequent thinkers and poets in China all developed ideas of self-contained, autonomous villages, and, simultaneously, because the central government was unreliable, the local populace developed self-defense organizations against bandits.40

Second, the Chinese were “femilistic” \(kazokushugi\) rather than oriented toward a state or central government. Again, this points to their qualitative difference with the Japanese. Third, the Chinese were “selfish” \(rikoteki\)— namely, concerned with personal gain—a product of their individualistic and family-oriented tendencies. Even Uno recognizes the contradiction at this point: How can the Chinese be both devoted to their families and selfishly individualistic at the same time? Chinese families are formed on the basis of individual bonds in symbiotic fashion; thus, the individual finds personal gain only through devotion to a family. The fact remains that Confucius, Mencius, and their followers through the ages consistently spoke out against selfish profit. How can it have become a basic characteristic of the Chinese people? Uno is unable to solve this conundrum, but he does note that this selfish quality has enabled the Chinese to become extraordinary businessmen.41

Uno admits that the fourth quality, superstitiousness, is one that the entire world \(including Japan\) shares with the Chinese. The Chinese also have a 

“penchant for exaggeration” \(kochōsei\); in this they far outstrip the more naive Japanese. The Chinese also “follow others blindly” \( fuwa raidō\).  This quality would seem to pose yet another contradiction: How can the Chinese be both individualistic and selfish, on the one hand, and blind, unthinking followers of others, on the other? One would also, of course, like to know how a people, an entire ethnic group \(minzoku\), can be any one way or another. At fault is the 39  Ibid., 369–70. 

40  Ibid., 370–73. Again Naitō Konan was developing virtually identical ideas at this time; see especially his Shinaron \(On China\), translated in part by Joshua A. Fogel, in Naitō Konan and the Development of the Conception of Modernity in Chinese History \(Armonk, NY: M.E. 

Sharpe, 1984\). 

41  Uno, Shina bunmei ki, 373–79. 

Confucian Pilgrim: Uno Tetsuto’s Travels In China 481

blanket fashion by which theories of national character portray entire nations or peoples. The unspoken assumption throughout these essays is that because he has actually been to China, he has gained firsthand, authoritative information about the Chinese people. 

Uno additionally claims that the Chinese are also extremely “sociable,” and he offers a bizarre theory of the spoken Chinese language \(which he hardly knew at all\) in which the musical quality of Chinese affords it all the strengths of vowel-rich languages \(a sense of peace and joy\) and of consonant-rich languages \(a means of articulating anger\) elsewhere in the world.42 This assessment on his part is simply sophomoric, and best forgotten. 

As apparently individualistic as the Chinese are, they are also, according to Uno, masters at assimilating foreign beliefs and customs of the non-Han peoples surrounding them and incorporating these alien elements into Han culture. And, as radically and proudly democratic as the Chinese are, Uno claims that they are also extremely conservative. This quality is responsible for the great difficulty Chinese reformers have had in implementing their programs. 

But not only are the Chinese stubbornly selfish and resistant to external interference in their lives; they are also, in Uno’s estimation，submissive, “a people extraordinarily resigned to their lot in life” \(goku akirame no yoki kokumin\).  

This quality has much to do with their eleventh trait, their peaceful, antiwar, antimilitaristic nature.43

The penultimate characteristic of the Chinese, according to Uno, is their extraordinary orientation toward society. This developed sense of society, he argues, fits well with their democratic, peace-loving, autonomous spirit. 

Indeed, it does, but it would certainly seem to clash with their alleged traits of selfishness, individualism, and blindly following others. 

Their final quality is their “leisureliness” \(yūchō naru koto\).  The Chinese seem to Uno always to be composed and never under pressure; this is the one characteristic he suggests, albeit equivocally, that the Japanese might want to examine for themselves.44

No reader of this last essay could come away with a clear picture of the national character, if we can even speak of such a thing, of the Chinese people. 

It is a potpourri of contradictory qualities, some extremely interesting. Others clearly offensive, all dated. However, it is the confusion itself that should be examined, for we learn nothing by studying Uno’s ideas by themselves in an effort to resolve the contradictions. Uno had gone to China for the first time 42  Ibid., 379–86. 

43  Ibid., 386–91, citation on p. 389. 

44  Ibid., 391–92. 

482

Confucian Pilgrim: Uno Tetsuto’s Travels In China

with a preconceived image of China drawn exclusively from classical texts. 

China was a place he thought he knew. He was making a pilgrimage to the origins of civilization itself. But something—many things—went wrong. The contemporary Chinese were not living up to the great standards set down in the Chou dynasty; actually, it was the Japanese who were doing it, as indicated by his bifurcation of Confucius from the subsequent Confucian tradition. Only the Japanese were still loyal to the original Confucius, while the Chinese had followed a frighteningly democratic road from the time of Mencius. 

Uno was too intelligent and too devoted to Chinese \(or East Asian\) culture to jettison the entire Kangaku tradition, to lose faith in his image of “China.” That survived in frozen, still-life from, but contemporary China had to be incorporated somehow into this image of China. However disjointed we may find the two Chinas in reading Uno now, he felt compelled to unify them. His effort was not a rousing success, as his last essay on Chinese character traits indicates. He was still too confused himself. What is ironic is that he commenced this voyage—at least the writing of his account after returning, as noted at the outset—intent on overcoming the plastic images people had been popularizing about China. “Those who understand China,” he wrote in his introduction to this travel account, “by reading its revered classics and sagely scriptures of antiquity may think that China is a paradise on Earth with sages and men of virtue wafting about like the clouds.” One cannot help but think that this was an autobiographical admission. But what began as an effort to overcome a simplistic and stereotypical view of China ended up providing just that: a stereotypical view with thirteen well-defined national characteristics. 

Uno lived nearly another seventy years and reached the pinnacle of his profession at Tokyo University in Japan. His was the last Kangaku travel account of China that, initially at least, entertained an undiluted picture of a pristine China. Kangaku scholars would still travel in China and write about their experiences, but Uno was the last of the great ones in Meiji Japan. It is a telling fact that he completed his account in 1912, just after the final collapse of the imperial system in China and just a few months before the end of the Meiji period. His is also the last travel account of China that truly followed Bashō’s credo: “Do not seek to follow in the footsteps of the men of old; seek what they sought.”45
