title = "Japanese Approaches to the Cultural Revolution: A Review of Kokubun Ryōsei’s Survey of the Literature"

+++

What follows is an extended review of an excellent summary of Japanese writings on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and the changes in China since the death of Mao Zedong and the purge of the “Gang of Four” in Kokubun Ryōsei’s “The Present State of Japanese Research on the Chinese Cultural Revolution and Problems Areas.”1 Professor Kokubun of Keio University is one of the few genuinely recognizable political scientists of China in Japan. Although still young, he has already amassed an impressive list of publications, including two articles in English. This piece appeared in a Keio University publication. 

Kokubun makes no pretense of covering the many hundreds of Japanese books, articles, and media editorials concerning the Cultural Revolution. For example, the National Diet Library has published a listing in its monthly bul-letin of 700–800 items published in Japanese for a period of less than two years \(January 1900–October 1967\).2 Kokubun gives several other, equally lengthy, listings published in Japan. 

He notes at the outset that the whirlwind of events in China—from the Cultural Revolution to the Lin Biao affair, the anti-Lin Biao, anti-Confucius campaign, the Tiananmen incident, the death of Mao, the arrest of the “Gang of Four,” and the rehabilitation of Liu Shaoqi—have dramatically changed Japanese assessments of the Cultural Revolution and considerably undermined approaches adopted earlier to contemporary Chinese history. 

He sees five general evaluative stances taken by Japanese scholars toward the Cultural Revolution. The first includes those who analyzed the Cultural Revolution within a Marxist framework and praised it uncritically.

supported the “class struggle” to topple Liu Shaoqi and others suspected of 

“taking the capitalist road.” Now that the Chinese have reversed the verdict on the Cultural Revolution, advocates of this position, such as Suganuma Masahisa, author of The Cultural Revolution,3 and many others, find themselves in a serious quandary. Kokubun says that they have chosen one of three options: “They can keep pace with the \[new\] Chinese line; they can remain silent about the Cultural Revolution; or they can consistently hold onto their earlier views” \(p. 3\). Suganuma, for example, has taken the first route and admitted the errors of his earlier ways. But, this is not enough. Kokubun notes that “the issue is not resolved in this manner \[that is, by admission of past mistakes\]. We need a reexamination of the whole scholarly attitude of these people” \(p. 4\). Indeed, we do. It may be a religion to them, but there is no reason that confession should exonerate people who were complicit in one of the great crimes of the Twentieth century. Others in this first group include: Ando Hikotaro4 and Fujimura Toshiro.5

The second Japanese approach to the Cultural Revolution also adopted a Marxist framework of analysis, but used it to criticize events in China. These people argued that the Cultural Revolution was either a simple power struggle or Mao’s effort to enforce his dictatorial control; and Liu Shaoqi’s plans for socialism, they claim, were more correct than Mao’s. This position closely parallels the stance taken by the Japan Communist Party which split with the CCP in 1966. As a representative work of this strain, Kokubun cites: Kawazoe Noboru and Inumaru Giichi, The Cultural Revolution in China: Its Origins and Contradictions.  6 From their perspective, the “main aim” of the Cultural Revolution “was to establish and strengthen an unlimited dictatorial control of Mao’s clique based on a deification extraordinaire of Mao Zedong” \(p. 4\). 

It was, they conclude, “anti-democratic, anti-socialist, anti-Marxist, and anti-Leninist.” Nonetheless, they also argue that while the Cultural Revolution was a \(manipulated\) mobilization from above, it also embodied a participatory movement of the masses from below. Just what elements of a popular 3  Suganuma Masahisa 菅沼正久, Bunka dai kakumei  文化大革命 \(Tokyo: San’ichi shobo 三一書房, 1967\).

movement they are referring to have yet to be addressed. Other scholars whose work falls into this second group include Nakanishi Tsutomu,7 among others. 

The third group includes those Japanese scholars who stressed the positive aspects of the Cultural Revolution, though not from a Marxist framework. Unlike the first group Kokubun has identified, this third group did not follow in lockstep the Chinese line at the time. Although they did not deny elements of a power struggle, they were trying to assess the import of the Cultural Revolution for the contemporary world in a positive light. This group—which includes such scholars as Nomura Koichi,8 Kawachi Juzo,9 and Yamada Keiji10—has largely held to its guns despite the reevaluations underway in China. In his book Questions for the Future,11 Yamada argues that the infamous “two-line struggle” had nothing whatsoever to do with the “capitalist road;” what was at issue was the “value of socialism.” Liu Shaoqi envisioned a technocratic society supported by “bureaucratic rationalism,” but this was a far cry from either capitalist or Soviet society. The Maoist line during the Cultural Revolution, in Yamada’s words \(which sound hauntingly reminiscent of many Western observers\), was a challenge to “the alienation of society and mankind controlled by technocrats.” Thus, this group’s basic perspective on the Cultural Revolution was to see it as an issue of visions. One seriously wonders if they ever noticed when the actual events in China clashed with the ideals. 

Kokubun’s fourth group includes those scholars who, from a non-Marxist perspective, recognized many different, textured qualities to the Cultural Revolution. Their work examined these various areas empirically without offering, as a rule, subjective judgment about the Cultural Revolution itself. 

One major work in this vein was Kamibeppu Chikashi’s The Logic of the Cultural Revolution in China,12 a highly detailed account through the Ninth Party Congress of 1969. He argues that it was not a simple power struggle but a conflict between contending lines and policies. Other scholars whose work is in this category include Okubo Yasushi,13 Torii Tami,14 and Uno Shigeaki.15

Japanese Approaches to the Cultural Revolution

The fifth interpretative strategy for the Cultural Revolution was a thorough or practically thorough, denunciation of it from a non-Marxist perspective. Scholars of this stripe see it as a blatant power struggle without an iota of positive significance, and they tend to hold similar views about Chinese Communism and Maoism as well. Two works, cited by Kokubun, that typify this fifth stance are: Shibata Minoru, The Tragedy of Mao Zedong,16 and Kuwabara Toshiji, Mao Zedong and Chinese Thought.  17 Shibata argues that the Cultural Revolution constituted “the appalling ‘malice’ of Mao as it accumulated over a ten-year period,” along with his “tenacious” thirst “for power” 

\(p. 6\). The “tragic” quality of the Cultural Revolution was that “Mao considered himself a proletarian Marxist, while he was convinced that Liu Shaoqi was a bourgeois revisionist.” I cannot help but feel that there were greater tragedies in the Cultural Revolution than Mao’s misconceived self-image, unless Shibata was applying the concept of tragedy in the strict sense of an Oedipal figure who ends up unconsciously destroying everything he has inherited and loved. 

There is still something a bit simplistic about this analysis, as Kokubun notes. 

Surely, the Cultural Revolution and the mobilization of millions of people was not just a marionette show. 

Kokubun concludes by offering his own ideas about future work on the Cultural Revolution and Japanese views of it. He suggests interviews with those who actually experienced it may help convey a more realistic picture of events in China at the time. He also suggests going beyond seeing it solely as a Mao-Liu power struggle. A more recent work by Kagami Mitsuyuki,18 uses an analysis of the Red Guard movement as a vehicle to discuss various other aspects of the Cultural Revolution, such as differences between regions and units. Kokubun also encourages less political partisanship \(as was so thoroughly apparent in the five schools of thought he analyzes\) and more group projects. The Cultural Revolution was a complex affair which convulsed a continent for a decade. He encourages a more cumulative, relative approach to its 16  Shibata Minoru 柴田穂.

many facets. Surely the simplistic analyses, so popular then and now, have no place on the scholarly agenda. 

One thing is for sure: if Kokubun Ryōsei is indicative of the future of Japanese political science on China, then Japan will definitely be number one in at least this area.
