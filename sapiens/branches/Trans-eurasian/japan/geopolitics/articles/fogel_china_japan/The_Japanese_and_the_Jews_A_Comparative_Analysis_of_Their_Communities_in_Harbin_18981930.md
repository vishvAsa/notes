title = "The Japanese and the Jews: A Comparative Analysis of Their Communities in Harbin, 1898–1930"

+++

One effective way to reach an understanding of the experiences of a given foreign community or colonial \(or semi-colonial\) situation in a given city is to compare it with another foreign community or colonial situation in the same city. This enables us to contrast degrees of assimilation, integration, interaction with the surrounding indigenous community and other foreign communities, and the like. Indeed, this volume, as a whole, will move us a large step forward in that direction. This chapter examines the experiences of the Jewish and the Japanese communities of Harbin in the three decades before the Manchurian Incident. 

Harbin enjoys a unique place in East Asian history. Unlike the great majority of other cities in contemporary China, Harbin does not have a history stretching back hundreds, even thousands, of years.1 It was constructed at the very end of the nineteenth century by Russian engineers and city planners, and it became something of a melting pot, a city of pioneers. It was a place where even the Chinese were newcomers. As a result of this newness, although there were not extraordinary levels of intermarriage and intercultural exchange, there was more in Harbin than in the other metropolises housing foreign communities in China. 

For those leaving the Russian empire, Harbin offered Jews an opportunity unavailable elsewhere in the lands of the Tsars: a haven relatively free from the virulent strain of antisemitism so prominent in eastern Europe at the time. 

The elite of the late imperial regime supported this tolerant attitude toward the Jews in the hope that they would spur economic development and help extend Russian authority into Manchuria.2 Thus Jews were used in Harbin 1  Chinese scholars have in the past few decades devised some highly dubious theories for the origins of Harbin which place it in the late eleventh century. This theory empowers the Chinese to claim a long history in Harbin prior to the first Russian settlement of the turn of the century. See Søren Clausen and Stig Thøgerson \(trans. and eds\).

The Japanese and the Jews

by the authorities as an economic vanguard in Asia, at the same time that many Jews utilised this opportunity to escape the clutches of Tsarism and antisemitism. For Japanese, Harbin offered a second chanc—and before 1931 it was not supported by Japanese military might. It was an opportunity to mix and do business in what was arguably the most international city in the world at the time—albeit a backwater from a world perspective—and it was a chance to escape back-breaking poverty for many at home.

**Origins of Harbin and its Japanese and Jewish Communities** The Japanese community in Harbin was the earliest settlement of Japanese in Manchuria. Earlier some Japanese had emigrated to Vladivostok in the Russian Maritime Province, which originally fell within Qing terrain and had been ceded to Russia in 1860 by the Manchu government. At the time Vladivostok was barely a sleepy fishing village; by 1877 there were approximately eighty Japanese living there, most working in the flesh trade servicing the large number of sailors whose ships called at port. Within a few years their numbers reached 140–50—all from Nagasaki—and they had branched out into restaurants and several laundries as well. By 1890 there were nearly 400 Japanese in the city with a gender ratio of three women to two men; frontier cities usually have far more men than women and a thriving brothel world, but Vladivostok’s experience was somewhat different. The Russians began construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway in 1891, and Vladivostok, being the eastern terminus, was overflowing with new businesses involved in the construction of the docks. 

There were some 500–600 Japanese recruited to the city from northern Kyûshû to work as labourers. By century’s end, the number of Japanese topped 1,000, and communal institutions were beginning to emerge. However, the bulk of the population remained involved in prostitution.3

In the fall of 1896 the Ussuri line of the Trans-Siberian Railway—linking Vladivostok with Khabarovsk—neared completion, and China signed a secret treaty with Russia allowing the latter to construct rail lines throughout Manchuria. They were to become the Chinese Eastern Railway \(CER\), and a CER construction authority in Vladivostok was created in the spring of 1897. 

For the transportation of material, a base of operations was still needed near a river; a site was selected near the Sungari river \(in Chinese Songhuajiang\) 3  Sugiyama Kimiko, Harubin monogatari \(Harbin Story\) \(Tokyo, Hara shobô, 1985\), 14–15, 18–24, 27–8. She cites a source that claims there were over 200 young women working as prostitutes in Vladivostok already in the mid-1880s.

that was sparsely populated. The materials were transported from Europe to Vladivostok by sea, loaded on to rail lines there and brought to Khabarovsk, and finally placed on riverine vessels and taken on the Sungari to this new site. 

The first group of men, led by A.I. Iugovich, chief construction engineer of the CER, with an armed Cossack guard, set out to establish this site in March 1898. 

It may be difficult to imagine now, with Harbin a teeming city of several million inhabitants, but what they found when they arrived the next month was a small settlement of local villagers in roughly twenty huts where lowgrade alcohol was being distilled and opium grown along the banks of the river. The Russians bought it all, and soon the massive railway construction enterprise was under way; some 200,000 Chinese would eventually migrate north to find employment with it. 

The Russian developers first set out to build a train station and narrow-gauge track from the Sungari wharf to the centre of the former settlement. This transport route was later to become the major thoroughfare of Harbin, known as Kitaiskaia Ulitsa \(Chinese Street\) in Russian and Zhongyang dajie \(Central Boulevard\) in Chinese. Within two decades, this avenue became the heart of non-Chinese Harbin, lined with an assortment of shops selling the latest fashions and foods from every comer of the European world.4

Russian city planners called this new site simply ‘Posyolok Sungari’ \(the Sungari Settlement\), but in a 1904 Japanese work introducing Manchuria it is already referred to as ‘Harbin’.5 The name must have come into popular currency within this period of six years. From that point forward, the Russian always called it ‘Kharbin’, and the Chinese used the three characters ‘Ha-er-bin’.

There he argues for a Jurchen origin for ‘Harbin’ meaning ‘honoured’; he also maintains that the city dates from 1097, thus supporting the aforementioned Chinese claim on the city and casting his linguistic theory in an equally dubious light. See Li Shuxia,  Haerbin lishi biannian, 1896–1926 \(Historical Chronicle of Harbin, 1896–1926\) \(Harbin, Difang shi yanjiusuo, 1980\), 3.

The Japanese and the Jews

In Japanese writings of the pre-war era it was more often ‘Harupin’. Even today both ‘Harupin’ and ‘Harubin’ are used as readings for this toponym. 

The famed author Yokomitsu Riichi wrote an essay in 1932 entitled ‘Rekishi \(Harupin no ki\)’ \(History: a Note on Harbin\),6 It recounts the story of Miyamoto Chiyo, a remarkable young woman who was one of the first Japanese to settle in Harbin. Born in 1879, she moved with her brother from her native Kumamoto to Vladivostok in 1888; there she earned her living as an assistant to the only Russian doctor in town. When, as part of the Russian development of Harbin, the doctor moved there in 1898, she accompanied him. Within a few years her close ties with the Russian community were sufficient grounds for all Japanese immigration matters to be put in her charge. The Boxer rising brought Sino-Russian border tensions to a high point, and in July of 1900 

the Russian army routed or murdered the entire Chinese population of the city of Blagoveshchensk, altogether some 3,000–4,000 persons. Many Japanese fled Harbin for the relative security of Khabarovsk or elsewhere, as did many Chinese. Yokomitsu noted that only twenty-two of Harbin’s Japanese residents remained during this massive withdrawal from the city; by the following year, however, the Japanese population returned to over 300. 

The paperwork for such a group was now too demanding for Miyamoto to handle by herself, and at this juncture a Japanese residents’ association, the Sôkakai or Sungari Association, was founded. The name indicates that by that early date, 1901, the name ‘Harbin’ had as yet probably not become firmly established, at least among the Japanese population. By late 1902 the population of Harbin had reached about 30,000, of whom some 514 were Japanese, according to a report of the Sôkakai; Manchuria as a whole was now home to about 7,000 

Japanese. In 1903–04, on the eve of the Russo-Japanese War, Harbin experienced a second mass withdrawal, though the city was otherwise unaffected by the fighting.7 The Japanese population of Harbin finally surpassed its pre-war figure only in December 1907, when the number reached 627, at a time when the numbers of Japanese in the cities of China proper were much higher.8

The gender imbalance continued to dog Japanese in Harbin for some time into the twentieth century. Even with a gender-skewed population and the bulk of it feeding the brothel business, Japanese in the city began quickly to branch out into other trades and to form a plethora of communal institutions. 

Comparably precise data for the Jewish community of Harbin have as yet not been uncovered. The records of the Jewish community—minutes of communal meetings, taxation figures, and the like—have yet to be found. We do know, however, that there were Jews among the first settlers in Harbin, if not in the initial Tsarist construction team. Unlike the Japanese who were leaving unemployment or poverty in their homeland the Jews, many from Siberia and others from the Pale of Settlement in the Russian empire, were escaping waves of ferocious antisemitism and organised terror. However, the very first Jews to make Harbin their home were a breed apart. This intrepid group included a handful of former Nikolaevskie soldati,  men who had been effectively kidnapped in their early to mid-teen years into twenty-five-year terms of military service for the Tsar’s armed forces. If they survived this service, they were granted a privilege denied other Jews in Russia: to settle outside the Pale. 

A number of such men, hardy creatures that they were, chose to make the new city of Harbin their home.9

Other early settlers were equally intrepid souls. To help develop this new region of the empire, the Tsarist government allowed a handful of Jewish businessmen the opportunity to invest in various industries in the Harbin area and Manchuria more generally. The activities included furs and lumber, and some of the businessmen became fabulously wealthy. The principal early figure in the Manchurian export trade was Roman Moiseevich Kabalkin, who had made his fortune in the grain trade and served for fourteen years as a consultant on the Riazan-Ural’sk railway. He was permitted to develop freight traffic from Siberia to Manchuria, to which end he established R.M. Kabalkin and Son around 1910. In the face of antisemitic pressures, he found support in the Shanhai, kindai toshi keisei shi hikaku kenkyû \(Yokohama and Shanghai: a Comparative Study of Modern Urban Formation\) \(Yokohama, Yokohama kaikô shiryô fukyû kyôkai, 1995\), 401; Takatsuna Hakubun, ‘Seiyôjin no Shanhai, Nihonjin no Shanhai’ \(Westerners’ Shanghai, Japanese Shanghai\), in Takahashi Kôsuke and Furumaya Tadao, eds, Shanhai shi, kyodai toshi no keisei to hitobito no itonami \(History of Shanghai: the Formation of a Great City and the Occupations of its People\) \(Tokyo, Tôhô shoten, 1995\), 120–1.

The Japanese and the Jews

CER authorities. Another major Jewish player in the Harbin economy was Lev Shmulevich Skidel’skii, who was to become Harbin’s only Jewish millionaire.10

Others were less wealthy men and women who simply gambled that they would do better on the more level playing field of Manchuria than in the pogrom-ridden cities and towns of the Pale. For example, the father of Eve Naftaly \[née Greenwald\) was a lumber and grain merchant who first visited Harbin in 1904 and brought his family there the next year. From the great Kishinyov pogrom in 1903 through the more widespread antisemitic acts associated with the Russian revolution of 1905, Jews began looking for opportunities outside the restrictions and abuses of the Pale. In Harbin, by contrast, a Jew could own land and there were no quotas on Jews in the schools: ‘It was like Russia without the antisemitism of Russia.’ Emile Katz’s father brought his family to Harbin in 1906 for the same reason, as did the father of Abe Traig \( né Treguboff\) in 1907. As Mrs Traig put it in an interview in 1975, ‘You see, the Jews in Siberia \[by which she meant also Manchuria and the Maritime Province\], once they got there, had much more rights than in Russia itself, because Siberia was a country that had to be developed.’ Pearl Levin’s father, responding to the horrors of 1905–06, moved his family to Harbin because he feared that his children would become revolutionaries as a result.11 The Jewish community grew steadily in the early years of the twentieth century. By 1909 its population of approximately 5,000 amounted to 11.5 per cent of the overall total in Harbin, second only in Siberia to Irkutsk \(6,100\) where the numbers amounted to only 5.6 per cent of the overall population.12

What did they think of this strange young city on the other side of the world? 

Most were amazed by two facts. First, it was a perfect replica of a Russian city, although far removed from the centres of Russian culture and civilisa-tion. Second, it was, as Eve Naftaly elegantly put it, ‘a horrible place . . . You know, like in the westerns—a little town, a frontier town. There were no pave-ments. There were wooden sidewalks.’ But, interestingly, she hastened to add, 

‘Harbin was a Russian town . . . on the Chinese soil.’ ‘It was a Russian city,’ noted Pearl Levin bluntly; ‘Harbin was absolutely Russian,’ stated Sara Ossin most 10  Shmuel Rabinovits, ‘Hayishuv hayihudi be-Sin, sigsugo vekhurbano’ \(The Jewish Community in China: its Growth and its Demise\), Gesher, 2:11 \(July 1957\), 108–21; David Wolff, ‘To the Harbin Station’, chapter 3.

succinctly.13 The city was a ramshackle frontier, much less sophisticated than anything with which they were familiar in the Pale, yet completely Russian, they all noted without any irony. What made Harbin and a few other cities like it preferable to anything in western Russia or Poland or Ukraine at the time, it must be emphasised, was the almost complete absence of antisemitism, fuelled in Russia proper by the government itself, or restrictions, a topic to which we shall return. No memoirist remembers any serious incidents before the late 1920s, though there were certainly many minor incidents following the retreat of the White armies toward the end of the 1910s. This quality of life more than compensated for Harbin’s lack of other amenities. As more Jews fleeing persecution in the 1910s made their way to Harbin, the early settlers took them in and together founded a full panoply of communal institutions.

**Work in Harbin: Occupations, Businesses, Shops**

Unlike the Japanese community of Shanghai, which lived much like other foreign ethnic enclaves within its own small universe, in its early years Harbin remained under Russian control. Despite the concessions acquired by Japan after victory in 1905, Harbin was to all intents and purposes a CER fief unto itself, ruled by the general manager of the CER, Dmitri L. Khorvat. However, as prospects for a secure future looked better from 1907 and the immense untapped wealth of the region became known, a new infusion of Japanese capital from that time helped to revive Harbin’s wayward economy; both Mitsubishi and Mitsui opened branches there that year. From this time, as well, there was a sustained return and growth in the number of Japanese in the city, following the withdrawal at the time of the Russo-Japanese War. 

As early as 1905 there were five competing companies plying the sea lanes between Japanese ports and Vladivostok. Even before the war the Japanese had founded larger enterprises in Harbin, such as Tokunaga Shôkai, Suzuki Nichi-Man Shôkai and Moritomi Shôkai—these were not on a par with the great zaibatsu, but neither were they corner bodegos.  A local survey of Japanese businesses in Vladivostok late in 1907, for example, revealed thirty-nine general stores, seventy-five laundries, thirty-six barbers, twenty-seven cobblers, thirty-six carpenters and sixty-two families in the kashiseki or ‘rooms for rent’ 

business, a euphemism for houses of prostitution. World War I brought prosperity to Harbin; trade exports rose dramatically and, by way of example, the 13  Bay Area Jews from Harbin, Manchuria, interview with Eve Naftaly, 11, 17–18; interviews with Pearl Levin and Sara Ossin on cassette.

number of oil refineries increased from seven to twenty. During the war years Japanese contacts throughout Siberia rose to make Japan second only to the United States for the volume of trade with the region.14 Interestingly, even as the Japanese population grew and became more sophisticated and diverse through the 1910s, and even as fresh business opportunities enriched the local community, the number of Japanese linked with prostitution remained extremely high.15

The phenomenon of large-scale Japanese prostitution in Harbin was by no means unique in East Asia. Large numbers of young Japanese women, known colloquially as karayukisan \(lit. those who go to China\), were forced or deceived with offers of jobs to aid their impoverished families into travelling to many of the cities of mainland East and South East Asia, as well as Hawaii and even the west coast of the United States. If they survived the trip, they were faced with a future of indentured servitude as prostitutes, often for the rest of their lives. 

Morisaki Kazue has estimated that some 30,000 prostitutes were transported to Manchuria by unscrupulous Japanese.16 One may see here the origins of what would later, also euphemistically, be called ianfu  or comfort women, the young Asian women dragooned into sexual service for the expanding Japanese military, though others date this development to much later. 

The Bolshevik revolution brought about a major shift in power relations within the city. There were struggles within the CER between Khorvat and the railway workers, exacerbated by demands from the local Chinese authorities 14  Higashi Kochiku, ‘Urajio yori Harubin e’ \(From Vladivostok to Harbin\), Taiyô, 24:9 \(July 1918\), 184–6; Manshû nippô, 18 December 1907, 1; Sugiyama Kimiko, Harubin monogatari, 64–8, 75–8, 90–2.

There is a fascinating listing of the businesses owned and operated by Russians in Harbin in Urajio nippô, 10 August 1922, 3. With the exception of the brothel business, Russians were engaged in many of the same businesses in that city as the Japanese, albeit in larger numbers.

for full sovereignty over both the railroad and the region. Russian culture continued to dominate non-Chinese \(and even some Chinese\) life in Harbin, but from this time forward Russian control of the city began a decline from which it was never to recover. The Russian presence in Harbin in fact only increased over time, with waves of White Russians and others escaping the Bolsheviks after 1917, but without Tsarist support many Russians were reduced to poverty, beggary and criminal behaviour. Harbin may have been the only city in East Asia in which Caucasian beggars outnumbered Asian beggars. Barely two decades old, Harbin remained a city of pioneers—Chinese, Japanese, Russians, Koreans and others—a city undergoing repeated political and social turmoil. 

After the conclusion of the Great War, the joint powers invaded Siberia in an attempt to crush the young Soviet regime, but by the end of 1918 all the powers save Japan had withdrawn. Fearing the immediate consequences of Russian retaliation, Japanese forces remained in the region for over four years, despite worries voiced by the Japanese communities in Siberia and Manchuria of exacerbated tension with Russia and China. By this point there were thousands of Japanese expatriates \(and far more Koreans, whose country had been annexed by Japan in 1910\) living throughout the cities of North East Asia and along the Trans-Siberian Railway. When the decision was reached for the Japanese expeditionary force to withdraw in 1922, many local Japanese residents vociferously protested in the local press against such a move, fearing Russian reprisals because of the long intimacy of the Japanese military with the Whites and the Japanese support for such petty White Russian dictators as Grigorii Semenov.17

During the years of the Russian civil war the Russian émigré population of Harbin tripled to 124,000 by 1921, while the Japanese population rose by 75 per cent over the same period to 3,545 \(excluding Koreans\). The Chinese, far and away the largest portion of the local population, rose in number from 170,000 

in 1917 to over 315,000 by early 1922. Thus, by 1922 the city had a total population 17  See the appeal to the Japanese government \(dated 1 May 1918\), signed by the heads of the Japanese Residents’ Associations of Vladivostok, Harbin, Iman, Nikolsk and Spassk-Dal’nyi, it cautions the authorities on the use of military force in the region.

of half a million, and nominal political control over the city was now in Chinese hands, but each of the constituent ethnic groups effectively managed their own affairs. To do so, each created its own array of communal institutions. 

The Jewish community grew in response to waves of antisemitism in eastern and central Europe. While the great majority of Russian, Polish and Ukrainian Jews migrated to North America, a sizeable minority found their way along the Trans-Siberian Railway to cities in the east. Once the basis of a community had been laid, it began to grow. The population of Jewish Harbin reached its peak in the early 1920s at no more than 15,000—small by international standards but important in other ways. 

Continuing the direction set by the first generation of settlers, the majority of Jews in Harbin were in business. While the greatest wealth was probably to be made in lumber and furs, others dealt in grain, soap, textiles and similar products of daily use. Many were small businessmen who ran their own shops, such as Benjamin Alcone’s father, who ran a jewellery store, and Pearl Levin’s father, who, together with his brother, operated a music store.18 Some Japanese visitors to the city claim that the brothels they visited were run by Jews and/or employed young Jewish women for their clientele, but they generally substantiate such claims by inane statements about someone ‘looking Jewish’ or having ‘a long nose’.19 There indeed may have been Jews in that trade, too, but the question requires further study. Harbin never became a noted centre of Jewish or secular learning; it spawned no great yeshivas or colleges for Europeans. 

Indeed, most young Jewish men and women went to Europe or the United States for a university education.20

Although no one has substantiated the role of Jews in Harbin prostitution, it seems clear that Jews were involved in the local entertainment industry to a considerable extent. Harbin was famous throughout East Asia as one of the liveliest and most freewheeling places on the world map, something that went well with its earlier frontier self-image. It was referred to generally as the ‘Paris of the Orient’ \(as well as the ‘City of Eros’\) by many travellers and settlers there, an appellation applied by others to Shanghai as well. It was renowned for its 18  Bay Area Jews from Harbin, Manchuria,   interviews with Benjamin Alcone and Pearl Levin on cassette tapes; see also interviews with Eve Naftaly, 1, with Abe Traig, 4, with Emíle Katz, 9, and with Leon Lerman, on cassette.

‘dance halls,’ strip tease shows and bar-girls, and it was these institutions that were allegedly operated by Jewish residents.21

One of the enduring themes about Jewish life in Harbin was, with the exception of several notorious cases, the relative absence of organised antisemitism. 

Of course, the Whites brought their antisemitism with them to the city and taught it to the Japanese during the Siberian Expedition, to which time the first Japanese translation of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion can be dated,22 

but there were no Black Hundreds in Harbin, the setting being far removed from the traditional forces that stirred up antisemitic activities elsewhere. It was thus an extraordinary novelty: a Russian city without significant antisemitism, at least before the late 1920s. In the short history of the interface between Ashkenazi Jewry and China, Harbin was the only community which saw itself, more or less, as a terminus in the Exile \(excluding, of course, the final ingathering of all exiles\).

**Communal and Cultural Institutions**

By the 1910s, both the Japanese and the Jewish communities of Harbin had produced a wide array of local institutions supporting their respective constituencies. These institutions were, of course, by no means unique to Harbin; wherever either group settled away from home, they created comparable communal services. Neither the Japanese nor the   Jews were content to rely on the local Chinese authorities to provide any but the most minimal political or policing service to the city; both assumed responsibility for the rest. This meant establishing social, educational, economic and religious institutions to provide for their people in Harbin. Harbin did have the additional circumstance of being such a young city that, unlike most other cities in continental 21  Yamamoto Sanehiko, ‘Harupin’ \(Harbin\), Kaizô, 14 \[October 1932\), 337–40; Kiyozawa Retsu, ‘Sekai no jiyû shi, yoru no Harupin’ \(Free City of the World: Harbin by Night\), Taiyô, 32:7 \(June 1926\), 58–62; Higashi Fumio, Chôsen Manshû Shina,   39–48; Yamaura Kan’ichi,

Asia, it probably would have been in no position to offer such services even if its foreign constituents sought them. 

As elsewhere outside Japan, it was the formal Japanese Residents’ 

Association that took the lead in creating communal institutions. Although Harbin followed Vladivostok’s lead in most civil matters, Japanese in Harbin formed a local residents’ association, the Sôkakai, in 1901; Vladivostok did likewise in March 1902, where there were 2,875 Japanese residents \(and a total of 4,334 throughout the Russian Far East\). The mass withdrawal of Japanese from the region over the following few years left few behind to run communal affairs. 

As Harbin’s Japanese population returned to its pre-war level by the end of the first decade of the twentieth century, the first elementary school for Japanese pupils was opened—with a total of four students—in 1909 in a room of the local Nishi Honganji, a branch establishment of the Pure Land Buddhist sect. 

It acquired its own building only in June 1923, an impressive edifice built by the Sôkakai and the South Manchurian Railway Company \(SMR\) which from 1920 

assumed half of all educational expenses for the local population.23

Despite these separate communal institutions, the Harbin community achieved a much higher degree of integration into the general Harbin population than did Japanese communities elsewhere in China. Whereas, for example, in Shanghai most Japanese lived in blissful ignorance of the surrounding Chinese population, in Harbin most Japanese learned Russian—they agreed with the assessment that it was, after all, a Russian city culturally—and many even made a stab at Chinese. Since those Japanese who settled in Harbin planned to remain there well into the future, it was only natural that they should attempt to learn the language of the predominant groups in the city, much as Japanese sought to learn English in the United States or Portuguese in Brazil. In September 1920 a Russo-Japanese School opened, the forerunner of the Harbin Academy which became famous as a training institute in the Russian language. The first principal, Inoda Kôhai, was a former student of Futabatei Shimei from the Tokyo Foreign Language School. A Sino-Japanese Evening School for language training opened in early April 1923 with similar aims of fostering Sino-Japanese understanding and friendship. 

In addition, many Japanese who worked outside the home adopted Western styles of dress from the end of the Meiji period. In fact, Japanese in Vladivostok 23  Sugiyama Kimiko, Harubin monogatari,   66–7, 78, 116–17; Gotô Shinkichi, ‘Harubin Nihon shôgakkô’/ \[The Japanese Elementary School of Harbin\), in Gotô Shinkichi, ed., Harubin no omoide \(Memories of Harbin\) \(Kyoto, Kyôto Harubin kai, 1973\), 68–82; Sugiyama Kimiko, ‘Harubin no ki: watakushi ga doko de mita koto, kangaeta koto’ \(Notes on Harbin: Where I saw Things and thought Things\), Manshû to Nihonjin, 7  \(November 1979\), 8.

early on became tailors producing Westernstyle men’s and women’s clothing initially for the local Russian population. Fresh Japanese produce \(mandarin oranges, apples, and other fruit and vegetables\) was imported from numerous Japanese ports throughout the north-east as far as the Blagoveshchensk region with Chinese merchants serving as intermediaries. Japanese-language newspapers in Harbin abounded. In addition to journalists from all the major Japanese dailies and weeklies, Harbin produced a wide variety of its own, such as Harubin nichinichi shinbun, Taihoku shinbun, Harubin tsûshin, Ro-A jihô, Hoku-Man denpô and Teikoku tsûshin.  24

In the aftermath of World War I and the Bolshevik revolution, Harbin became congested with countless new immigrants. The year 1919 was particularly difficult, with the Japanese military confiscating freight cars for their own use. That same year, though, the Japanese community founded the Harbin Commercial Exhibition Hall \(Harabin shôhin chinretsukan\) dedicated to stimulating Russo-Japanese trade and incidentally to calming Russo-Japanese tensions. It was headed by Mori Gyoin, who was to become a central figure in the local Japanese community for the next two decades. The Exhibition Hall began that year to publish a monthly magazine, each issue well over 100 pages, featuring all manner of local news, commercial statistics and a variety of human interest stories mostly from Harbin but with occasional reports from Vladivostok and elsewhere in the region. By October 1921 the Japanese Chamber of Commerce of Harbin had 113 members.25

These efforts at smoothing over the ethnic frictions in the city may be unique in the Japanese experience on the mainland, despite the fact that visitors to the city noted that Chinese, Japanese and Russians each had their own interests to protect and their own self-defence mechanisms. When the Japanese army withdrew in 1922, many Japanese residents of Vladivostok decided it was no longer safe to live there, and they resettled in Harbin, presumably because it seemed far more secure to them; others moved to the Korean city of Ch’ongjin to the south, but Harbiners did not move in any significant numbers.

The Japanese and the Jews

from the evacuation in 1922 through the Manchurian Incident marked Harbin’s Republican Chinese phase. The central government in Beijing and later in Nanjing was never strong enough to exercise control over Harbin, though, and the city thus fell under the sway of the massive Manchurian satrapy of warlord Zhang Zuolin, who turned affairs over to his underling, Zhang Huanxiang. The latter Zhang began a course of action aimed at Sinifying Harbin which met with considerable friction from the leaders of the other ethnic communities.26

History has sadly provided far more opportunities for Jews to find themselves forced to leave the country of their birth and migrate to a new setting in which they would carve out communal institutions. Jewish Harbin was a Russian Jewish enclave outside central Russian control. Russian Jews just longed to be left alone; in Harbin they were beyond the reach of the Russian government, and they prospered. Russian Gentiles had come to expect support from the regime; in Harbin they got none and did poorly. 

The first generation of Jewish settlers were generally bilingual in Russian and Yiddish, though, as was the case elsewhere, Yiddish soon gave way to Russian monolingualism in civil affairs, though it is not entirely clear when the transition occurred. Most of those interviewed have denied any knowledge of Yiddish—for an assortment of complex reasons usually associated with a sense that Russian was a cosmopolitan, ‘European’ language while Yiddish was backward and old-fashioned. However, when Israel Cohen travelled through Harbin in 1920 or 1921, carrying the message of the Balfour Declaration around the world, he was asked by the beadle of the Great Synagogue to speak after the morning prayers one Shabbat: ‘Reb Yisroel, vet ir efsher a bisl zogn?’ \(Israel, perhaps you could say a few words?\) The ever-present Chinese military guards, fearful of the spread of Bolshevism, forbade the use of Yiddish, insisting on Russian, which they more or less understood and which Cohen did not know.27 

This story also indicates, as many interviewees have noted, that the Chinese, 26  Higashi Kochiku, ‘Urajio yori Harubin e’,189, Sugiyama Kimiko, Harubin monogatari, 114–15. Higashi Fumio \( Chôsen Manshû Shina,   46\) reported that relations between young Japanese and young Russians were excellent, with some intermarriage, but this strikes me as somewhat exaggerated or propagandistic. His book was published in 1940. More typical was Yamamoto Sanehiko’s comment \(‘Harupin’, 346\): ‘Who must bear responsibility for the crime of turning Harbin into a street of flirtatiousness?’ The White Russians, of course. ‘All their great pride in the glories of the Tsarist era they now discard in the gutters of Harbin. They keep hordes of degenerate women, and they have transformed it 

\[Harbin\] into a prominent boil on the face of the earth.’ Stunning comment, considering that it was the Japanese who pioneered prostitution in Harbin.

too, learned Russian far more often than Russian-speakers learned any Chinese. 

In addition, we have a survey dated 1913 on native language which gives 62 per cent Russian and 32 per cent Yiddish for Jewish Harbin; the 1897 Russian cen-sus produced a figure of 97 per cent Yiddish for Jews throughout Russia.28

A Jewish Nationality Committee was established in Harbin on 16 February 1903, and it elected a ‘Spiritual Directorate’. They immediately set to work trying to establish a synagogue; at first, a place was rented while funds were sought among European brethren. In August 1904, W. Levin, Harbin’s first rabbi, arrived; earlier that year, in January, a five-kopek communal tax per chicken for kosher slaughtering was levied by the Jewish leaders of the city. While Rabbi Levin departed in 1906, a new synagogue \(known as the Main Synagogue\) and Jewish primary school were completed in 1907. They soon created a khevra kadisha or burial society \(like the hundreds of similar associations that exist to this day in Jewish communities through the world\), a cemetery, a mikvah \(ritual bathhouse\), an old age home, a Jewish Women’s Charity Committee in 1907, a library in 1912 and a Talmud-Torah in 1914. Many of the communal institutions established or expanded by Jews were in response to the wave of émigrés  that came to the city later during the years of World War I and the Bolshevik revolution. These included a free kitchen, a Jewish hospital, a low-interest credit union, secular and religious schools, and a second synagogue. 

There were as well Russian secular schools that were not specifically Jewish and which Jewish students attended, such as the Harbin Commercial School.29

The foremost figure of Jewish Harbin, like Mori Gyoin for Japanese Harbin, was Abraham Kaufman. Born in Perm, Russia, Kaufman earned his medical degree in Switzerland before coming to Harbin in 1908. There he opened his practice and thereafter was involved in every aspect of communal life until the Soviet army invaded and occupied the city in 1945. Kaufman was promptly deported to the Gulag for the next eleven years. It was he who organised the Jewish hospital and numerous other communal organisations in the city. 

Not a single memoir about pre-war Harbin is complete without a paean to Dr Kaufman, the community shtatlan or intercessor. ‘When \[a\] new group started,’ remembered Eve Naftaly, ‘he was the president.’ He was famed as well stand the language; he settled on English, which was then translated into Russian.

as an orator; his moving speech on Kol Nidre night in 1912 about the trial of Mendel Beilis played an important role in his rise to prominence within the community.30

Unlike the other ethnic communities of Harbin, Jews did not share a single nationality, and citizenship became a serious issue for many who hoped to leave Harbin some day. Most had been Russian or Polish, but after the Russian Revolution, Soviet citizenship became a touchy issue. Some chose Soviet citizenship as a convenience, not necessarily as a sign of friendship for the new regime. Others retained the citizenship of Poland or Latvia or a host of other eastern European countries. Others opted for citizenship in the short-lived Far Eastern Republic \(1919–24\), and then found themselves without a country when that state collapsed. Many were simply stateless. 

One thing that united the great majority of Jewish Harbiners was Zionism, the new movement that allowed them to take great pride in themselves as Jews, which they had not been allowed to do in Russia proper. Abraham Kaufman had been active in the young movement for a Jewish homeland from the beginning and even attended the 1897 Zionist Congress in Basel. In the long history of the Jewish Exile, Harbin was home to the only sustained Zionist press in the Russian language. The quintessential Zionist cultural and social organisation, Hashomer Hatsair \(mostly left-wing\), had a branch in Harbin. From within it was also formed Betar, the decidedly right-wing Zionist cultural and sports group.31 In contemporary Jewish life, it would be unthinkable for these two groups to be so close; in Harbin early in this century, these political distinctions were less well understood and less important than the fact that both were Zionist. The Jewish Bund, a non-communist left-wing labour organisation later decimated by Stalin, also had representatives in Harbin, though its numbers tended to be small. 

The quasi-military Betar helped the Jews of Harbin to learn the art \(and hence the psychology\) of self-defence in the face of antisemitic attack. Most Jews fleeing eastern Europe did not have this experience of relative freedom until they came to North America or Israel. Most of them discovered their capacity for self-defensive organisation only at this point, when the organised 30  Eve Naftaly, interview, 68, 84; Pearl Levin, interview on cassette; Evsey Domar, interview; Herman Dicker, Wanderers and Settlers in the Far East, 24, 26–7; David Wolff, To the Harbin Station’, chapter 3.

antisemitic groups in Harbin could not call on the support of the Russian government. Thus, the Jews of Harbin effectively acquired this experience earlier in China. Whatever other failings it may have had, Betar did instil pride and the courage to fight back, enabling this group of Jews \(unlike many others of their background and generation\) to overcome the psychologically \(and probably physically\) scarring experience of antisemitism. 

Thus a full Jewish cultural life was to be found in Harbin, as well as non-Jewish Russian cultural events in which Jews participated: clubs, artistic societies, dance companies, oratory groups, orchestras, and a wild night life of cabarets and revues. Harbin became a regular stop for touring companies, including the Bolshoi Ballet. All the principal Jewish holidays were celebrated in Harbin. Matzah was available every year at Passover, and kosher meat was available all year round. William Zimmerman remembers that, when his family lived in Vladivostok, they travelled regularly to Harbin to purchase kosher meat ‘because Harbin is a good Jewish city’. Benjamin Alcone remembers that the Chinese even prepared gefilte fish for the Jewish families in whose homes they worked.32

The Jewish press of Harbin covered the full gamut from far right to far left. The great majority of its output was published in Russian. Evsey Domar remembered there being six daily newspapers in Russian in the 1920s. Some of these newspapers and newsletters \(twenty, in all, for the years 1920–40\), such as Yevreyskaya zhizn’ \(Jewish Life\), lasted several decades; others, such as Diaspora i Palestina \(Diaspora and Palestine\), existed for only a few issues. 

The one Yiddish-language newspaper, Der vayter mizrekh \(The Far East\), represented the voice of social democracy and was sympathetic to what is now the oldest Yiddish newspaper in the world, the Forverts \(Forward\) of New York City. Der vayter-mizrekh appeared thrice-weekly for about fourteen months, 1921–22, and is a fascinating newspaper.33 For a community not noted for the high level of education it offered, Harbin Jewry produced an impressive array of newspapers, periodicals and other publications, and supported a wide range of cultural events.

**Conclusion: Ethnic Integration and Assimilation in Harbin** On the whole Japanese memoirists who grew up in Harbin have gone to great lengths to describe how extraordinarily international, cosmopolitan and multicultural Harbin was. They frequently depict family interactions with Chinese and Koreans and even Russians. Sugiyama Kimiko, who has left an extremely valuable memoir of her nearly twenty years in the city, describes the disorientation in 1945 when her family was warned that it was time to go ‘home’. 

She beautifully describes the eerie feeling of having to withdraw to a ‘mother’ 

country of which she knew next to nothing. Harbin was her home; it was where her parents had met and married and given birth to her.34 In retrospect, though, especially after the experiences of the 1930s and 1940s, this portrayal is hard to accept in full. Perhaps, given the virtual absence of ‘international’, 

‘cosmopolitan’ experience in Japanese history, cultural life in Harbin seemed to be the epitome of ethnic interaction to many Japanese. 

Japanese did, though, before the 1930s bend to the Russian ways of the city. 

Many learned Russian, some—such as the famed diplomat, Sugihara Chiune—

exceedingly well. There is no reason to believe that they all harboured evil intentions toward the Chinese or welcomed the arrival of the Guandong army en masse in the 1930s, despite the orchestrated parade in 1932 along the streets of Harbin. Nonetheless, Japanese born or raised in Harbin and elsewhere in Manchuria—Abe Kôbô, Ozawa Seiji, Etô Shinkichi and Sugihara to name but four—have made an unusually international contribution to wartime and post-war Japanese society and culture, a contribution still not well understood or studied. 

Jewish Harbin was much less well integrated into local society. Reading the issues of Der vayter mizrekh from 1920–21, one senses the almost complete absence of China. There were countless stories about the numerous Jewish war orphans in eastern Europe that needed homes and news from other East Asian cities about the Jewish communities there. This characteristic resonates with other expatriate presses, such as Shanghai’s British North China Daily News, 34  Sugiyama Kimiko, Harubin monogatari,  3–6, 9,  12–13, 15–16, 18–19; see also Kaetsu Mikio, Nanasen mei no Harupin dasshutsu \(Seven Thousand who Escaped from Harbin\) \(Tokyo, published by the author, 1971\). More recently similar works of Japanese caught at the end of the war or later seeking their ‘roots’ in Harbin have been published; see, for example, Watanabe Ichie, Harubin kaikikô \(Return Voyage to Harbin\) \(Tokyo, Asahi shinbunsha, 1996\); Kôno Fumie, Harubin no sora: Nit-Chû no sokoku o motsu shô Nihonjin no kunan \(The Harbin Sky: Sufferings of a Little Japanese who had both China and Japan as Homelands\) \(Tokyo, On Times, 1996\).

which frequently tended to be consumed with stories from ‘home’. For local news, it would have been assumed, there were other sources, but in the continual shaping of communal identity the news from the home front played a critical role that could never be ignored. 

Russian and eastern European Jews, even more than their co-religionists in western Europe, had lived apart from Gentiles—in part because they were compelled to and in part because they chose to do so. Life in Harbin, largely free of virulent antisemitism until the late 1920s, was more conducive to integration. However, integration never seems to have included the Chinese population that outnumbered all others. As Eve Naftaly put it bluntly, ‘every nationality . . . to the great shame of them, treated the Chinese like dirt’.35 This statement has been repeated in less blunt but equally sharp ways by many others. Few learned more than a handful of Chinese words; few even recognised the everpresence of the Chinese around them, except in business transactions or as their servants. Evsey Domar, a retired professor of economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an eminent figure in his field, made a fascinating observation during an interview when he admitted that he had never noticed in his twenty years in Harbin and Dairen how attractive young Chinese women were; only on a trip back to China many years later did that awareness dawn on him.36

As noted above, Harbin offered pre-World War II Jewish émigrés  something denied most other Jews not living in North America or Palestine: a safe haven. 

Beyond the reach of government-sponsored antisemitic attacks, they learned to defend themselves in Harbin. Shanghai would later provide a similar escape for Jews, but it was never as secure, nor was Shanghai ever seen as more than an avenue of escape to somewhere else. In fact, the experience of Jews in Harbin encapsulated in roughly a generation much of the history of the Diaspora. 

Through the rapidly evolving circumstances of the time, the rise, brief efflorescence and decline of Jewish Harbin was telescoped into a few decades. Thus we find many of the institutions and organisations in Harbin that we find in almost all well articulated Diaspora communities, with the caveat that events unfolded so quickly that the same people often found themselves simultaneously members of two or more organisations, which their counterparts elsewhere would never have dreamed of.

The Japanese and the Jews

Harbin underwent a complete transformation beginning in the late 1920s and culminating in the Manchurian Incident and the Japanese military seizure of the city in 1931. From that time forward, the Japanese population skyrocketed, increasing by a factor of ten over the first half of the 1930s from a figure of 3,600 in early 1932. From the late 1920s the city experienced a spate of kidnappings—usually supported by extremist elements in the Guandong army working together with extreme right-wing, antisemitic, and fascist elements from the Russian community—of wealthy Chinese and of Jews for huge ransoms. The 1932 case of Semyon Kaspé, the talented young musician, is only the most notorious and grisly of many similar incidents.37 Following the Kaspé funeral, at which Abraham Kaufman gave the eulogy and denounced the perpetrators of the gruesome crime in no uncertain terms, ‘Dr Kaufman . . . a most cultured scholar, beloved by Gentiles and Hebrews alike,’ reported Amleto Vespa, then allegedly being compelled to work for the Japanese secret police, ‘was attacked daily for two months in two Japanese-owned papers. 

He was attacked on the street by Russians in Japanese employ. My new Chief assigned two Russian thugs to go at night and smash all the windows of the two synagogues.’38

The new mood in the city forced the great majority of Jews to flee for cities in China proper to the south, principally to Shanghai, and Tianjin to a lesser extent. When the young American reporter Edgar Snow visited Harbin in 1934, he had the following to say about the changes in the city’s atmosphere: Harbin, once delightful, today notorious as a place of living death, the worst-governed city in Manchukuo. 

Probably in no other city of the world is life so precarious. Harbin residents, including the 100,000 White and Red Russians, who here bend to the law of the yellow man, risk their lives if they go unarmed anywhere, even in daylight. 

Holdups, robberies, murders, kidnappings are common occurrences . . . 

Some of the worst criminals are White Russians. Destitute, broken in spirit, unwilling to return to Russia under the Bolsheviks, unable to earn a living in China under the Japanese, they turn to crime, nourished on a diet of drugs, 37  John Stephan, The Russian Fascists: Tragedy and Force in Exile, 1925–1945 \(New York, Harper Row, 1978\); Amleto Vespa, Secret Agent of Japan \(Garden City NY, Garden City Publishing, 1941\), 78–80, 89, 196, 198–203, 205–18, 238–9, 253, 272.

which are sold openly in shops infesting the city . . . In Harbin alone there are more than 2000 licensed shops for the sale of opium, heroin and morphine.39

In the new Harbin, the highly feared Tokumu kikan \(Special Services Agency\) of the Guandong army used the ethnic enclaves of the city to control it. Thus, according to sources that still need to be corroborated, they hired, for example, impoverished Cossacks to watch over the local Russian community. With the fox now guarding the chicken coop, this policy was virtually guaranteed to make everyone unhappy, except a handful of venal malcontents. As Edgar Snow noted, the Japanese police then sold off contracts to operate brothels and drug houses to local thugs and other unsavoury elements in the various sectors of the city, siphoning off a percentage of the take for themselves. That Japanese military take-over of prostitution in the city probably worked fist-in-glove with the rise of sexual slavery now being documented after a long hiatus. Many Japanese visitors to Harbin in the 1930s were horrified by what they found and lamented the fact that there were whole illicit industries thriving in Harbin which would have been completely illegal in Japan.40
