That the Chinese port of Shanghai was opened by British gunboats in the Opium War \(1839–42\) is so well known now that it scarcely requires mention. 

It has recently been brought once again to the big screen in Xie Jin’s panoramic 1997 movie Yapian zhanzheng \(Opium War\). That inglorious history aside, it would be two decades following the Treaty of Nanjing \(1842\) before the first Japanese made the trip to Shanghai in 1862, not counting the handful of fascinating cases of earlier shipwreck victims whose unfortunate peregrinations landed them in Shanghai for shorter or longer periods of time.1

This essay is part of a longer, ongoing project on the history of the first generation of Japanese who migrated to Shanghai, roughly 1862–95. Some of them came for relatively brief periods of time, others for one or more years, still others for the rest of their lives. Prominent among the first Japanese who would cake up residence in Shanghai were, interestingly, prostitutes and painters. 

There were also, of course, businessmen, most of them shopkeepers as well as a smattering of those who opened branches of the large combines back home \(Mitsui Bussan was the first\), a small handful of officials working at the consulate which opened in the early 1870s, and a few religious missionaries of the New Pure Land sect of Buddhism. 

Eventually, the Japanese community of Shanghai would fill out with roughly equal numbers of men and women; with children and schools; shopkeepers, businessmen, teachers, government employees, and the full range of 1  The fullest works in this area are: Haruna Akira, Nippon Otokichi hyōryūki \(An account of the castaway Otokichi of Japan\) \(Tokyo, 1979\); Haruna Akira, Sekai o mite shimatta otokotachi: Edo no ikyō taiken \(The men who saw the entire world: Experiences in a foreign land in the Edo period\) \(Tokyo, 1988\); Okita Hajime, Nihon to Shanhai \(Japan and Shanghai\) \(Shanghai, 1943\), pp. 43–72. And the much earlier history of raids on Shanghai in the spring and summer of 1553 by men deemed in the sources to be “Japanese pirates” \( wakō\).  Indeed, the five assaults that year by wakō led to the building of a wall around the city in the autumn, a wall which survived until 1912. As Liu Jianhui has argued, it was the wakō who effectively created the walled \(Chinese\) city of Shanghai. See Liu Jianhui, Mato Shanhai: Nihon chishikijin no

professions one would find in an expatriate community. While there had been tiny overseas communities of Japanese in China, the Philippines, and elsewhere in Southeast Asia in the premodern and early modern eras, Shanghai was to be the first such community in the modern period. After a few words on the first Japanese to make their way to Shanghai in the modern era, I will proceed to discuss the prostitutes and then the painters, and then look for commonalities. Why did such apparently disparate groups leave Japan in the first place? Why did they come to Shanghai? What did that port, deemed a virtual hell on earth by just about every Westerner \(and many Japanese\) who set foot there, have to offer them?2

**The Earliest Japanese Visitors to Shanghai**

The 1862 voyage of the Senzaimaru and the 1864 voyage of the Kenjunmaru to Shanghai, the first official Japanese voyages to China in several centuries, deserve a few brief comments.3 Those two missions were charged—by two of the highest officials responsible for foreign affairs in the Edo period, the Nagasaki Magistrate and the Hakodate Magistrate—with observing commercial conditions in Shanghai, as Japan prepared to open itself up to international trade. The authorities had learned from Chinese, British, Dutch, and American ships calling at those two, recently opened Japanese ports that Shanghai was an immense commercial entrepôt and a valuable window on the West. One could see the entire West in microcosm by making the journey of several days to Shanghai and without going halfway around the world to Europe or crossing the Pacific Ocean to the United States, both of which groups of Japanese would in any case do.4 Whatever other agendas the Japanese aboard these two vessels may have had—and they were many and varied—the overall intent of these two early trips was commercial.

Much had happened in Shanghai over the twenty years before the latecomer Japanese arrived there. By 1862 the Western powers had been building business empires and semicolonial enclaves, dubbed “Concessions,” for two decades along the Huangpu River. By the time the Japanese arrived on the scene, Shanghai was no longer a frontier outpost. As Takasugi Shinsaku \(1839–67\), the young hothead from Chōshū domain, put it in his 1862 travelogue, “Shanghai may in fact belong to China, but one might as well call it British or French terrain. . . . The Chinese have become servants to the foreigners. Sovereignty may belong to China but in fact it’s no more than a colony of Great Britain and France.”5

The accounts that remain extant from these early trips to Shanghai are the work of samurai politically active in their local domains and increasingly on die protonational stage, as well as of merchants getting a first caste of things to come. For better or worse, they all recognized that significant change was in the offing. Their accounts were not immediately published and circulated back in Japan, some taking many years before they would see print, and thus their writings did not have an immediate or substantial impact, although many of the men themselves would come to play highly important personal roles in Japanese politics, commerce, and the military over the next few years. 

In short order, Nagasaki, for two centuries Japans only open port, began to recede in importance, both as other pores opened and as Japanese vessels began to venture abroad. The Japanese government assisted private businesses in seeing to it that shipping lanes between the home islands and Shanghai, heretofore monopolized by foreigners, would be shared by Japanese and soon dominated by them. This process transpired over the course of the 1870s and 1880s.6 Even before then, however, Japanese were making their way to Shanghai.

A word on travel, travel restrictions, and the declining capacity of the Japanese government to control travel in the last days of the Tokugawa regime might be helpful at this point. Although a “feudal” regime in many ways, the Tokugawa \(or Edo\) shogunate \(1600–1868\) was also highly centralized and sought to retain as much control as the technology available to early modern policing institutions would allow. This inclination is generally seen by scholars as a reaction to the century of warfare and three decades of unification wars preceding the Tokugawa settlement at the turn of the seventeenth century. Japan would henceforth control its own borders, while missionaries and anything associated with Christianity \(blamed in part for those many years of chaos and bloodshed because of missionary activity\) would be strictly interdicted. And contacts with foreigners were also to be tightly restricted. 

Although domestic travel was itself severely curtailed on the books, there were ways, for example, for Japanese to travel on religious pilgrimages or to see relatives living at a distance.7 Foreign travel after the early decades of the seventeenth century was much more closely observed. Aside from a handful of extraordinary exceptions, the only Japanese who ventured abroad were the shipwreck victims mentioned above. Similarly, only the Dutch and Chinese were permitted in—decidedly no Catholic countries were allowed to sail ships into Japanese ports—and only to Nagasaki, where even there their movements were strictly curtailed. By the 1860s, when the government was becoming increasingly busy snuffing out nascent civil wars and after the United States had forcibly opened several Japanese ports by the end of the previous decade, interest in the Western world had grown dramatically. The only Japanese technically allowed abroad until the regime succumbed in 1867–68 were groups with special authorizations, but as we shall see individuals were able to travel outside the country with a fair degree of impunity. 

Sino­Japanese cultural contacts throughout the Tokugawa period continued but took new forms. They were mediated through Nagasaki to which Chinese ships regularly came, frequently bringing quantities of books and other art or everyday objects. The shogun and several important feudal lords often ordered specific items \(everything from legal texts to horses and equine physicians\) through these merchants­cum­culture brokers, who understood that their ability to continue trading with Japan depended on filling such orders. Sinic culture continued to develop throughout Japan—in literature, scholarship, Shanghai\), in Taishō jūninen kaki kaigai ryokō chōsa hōkoku \(Investigative report on an overseas trip in the summer of 1923\), ed. Kōbe kōtō shōgyō gakkō \(Kōbe, 1924\), p. 136.

and the arts—but in the effective absence of Chinese or access to them. This is an immense and fascinating area of research only just coming into its own in the West.

**The Oldest Profession**

The 25 August 1866 edition of the North China Herald observed, in its listing of arriving and departing passengers at Shanghai, that two days earlier the Moldavian had entered port from Nagasaki. On board were “two Japanese ladies.” A similar announcement concerning “3 Japanese ladies” arriving from Nagasaki aboard the Fe-loong appeared on 24 December 1867, and a third reported on “1 Japanese lady” arriving aboard the same ship on 16 May 1868.8 

At a time when the entire Japanese population of Shanghai could be counted on the fingers of two hands, these notices stick out glaringly. Who were these apparently unaccompanied “ladies?” What could their business have been in Shanghai in the final years of the Edo period and the first months of Meiji? 

Although we do not even know their names, the newspapers use of the term “lady” may indicate a reasonably good social standing. There is a remote chance that they were the Japanese wives of foreigners resident in Shanghai, although this is open to serious doubt, if only because they would surely have been so identified had they been married to Westerners. More likely, “lady” was being used either in ignorance of their actual social station or \(in the quaint, mid­nineteenth­century English of the North China Herald\) euphemistically or sarcastically. The women so named were probably extremely enterprising courtesans from the Maruyama, the red­light district of Nagasaki, who either were seeing the writing on the wall about Nagasaki’s future or were just interested in expanding their commercial horizons. The very fact that the Nagasaki Magistrate allowed them passage, at a time when it would be highly unlikely for him to allow any other kind of woman to travel on her own, supports the argument that they were, in fact, women of the night. 

Population figures for the Japanese community in the early Meiji period \(from the late 1860s through the early 1880s\) indicate roughly two men to every 8  “Passengers,” North China Herald,  25 August 1866, 24 December 1867, 16 May 1868.

three women; when gender parity was reached in the mid­1880s, the local Japanese population numbered close to six hundred.9 Inasmuch as it was still rare for businessmen to leave Japan with their entire families, there were clearly a lot of Japanese women in Shanghai unconnected by marriage or paternity to local Japanese men. Indeed, many texts, especially of the pre­war era, simply assume that some two­thirds of the resident Japanese women were working as courtesans or prostitutes whose clientele was mostly local Westerners and Japanese10—and, increasingly, wealthy Chinese as well. 

In the 1870s and 1880s, the prominence of houses of prostitution run by Japanese caught the attention of local Chinese commentators. One Chinese poem of uncertain origin is cited in a number of sources:11

東洋女子古來稀  Women from Japan have been rare here since antiquity, 別有風情妙入微 For they have a special quality; this is especially wonderful in its detail. 

狀束不同時俗流 They make themselves up and dress differently from 

contemporary styles, 

偏隨紅紫鬬芳菲 Yet they want people to follow their colors in red and purple so as to compete with the myriad flowers. 

As this poem implies, something of the attraction of such Japanese women was their difference \(that much abused term\), and their popularity among Chinese and Westerners owed much to the Japanese songs and dances which none of their clients understood or likely had heard or seen before. Chinese men who 9  Soejima Enshō, “Senzen ki Chūgoku zairyū Nihonjin jinkō tōkei \(kō\)” \(Statistics on the population of Japanese resident abroad in China before the war, draft\), Wakayama daigaku kyōiku gakubu kiyō, jinbun kagaku \(Essays of Wakayama University Department of Education, Humanistic Sciences\) 33 \(1984\): 9, 24. The Shanghai Municipal Council offered a figure of seven for the entire Japanese population in 1870, but this was clearly not based on reliable information; by the same token, Kishida Ginkō \(1833–1905\) wrote in 1870 

in an article for the Yokohama shinpō moshiogusa that there were one hundred Japanese in Shanghai—equally unreliable. The number was probably somewhere in between, as indicated by Yanagihara Sakimitsu \(1850–94\)—an estimate of fifty or sixty in his Shi Shin nikki \(Diary of a mission to China\)—who Traveled to China that same year to negotiate the first Sino­Japanese diplomatic treaty which came into effect the following year.

could afford it liked Chinese courtesans who could, in addition to waiting on them, write poetry and sing for them; the refined education of such women seemingly added to the experience. These Japanese women were similarly well trained, and their areas of expertise, although initially strange to Chinese ears and eyes, lent something of the exotic and the alluring about them. This is surely high among the reasons Chinese chose to write about them. 

The first Japanese courtesan to settle in Shanghai for whom we have a name is a woman known in the sources solely by her professional nom de guerre of Sansan \(rendered by two different, reduplicated sets of characters\).12   As was the case with virtually all of the local Japanese, she too hailed from Nagasaki and arrived in the autumn of 1869. She was initially lionized by Huang Shiquan \(1853–1924\), a leading editor with Shenbao, one of the oldest Chinese newspapers in Shanghai and certainly the most prestigious, in an 1883 work on the sights and sounds of the city, especially its demimonde.13 Over the course of those fourteen years, she had become extremely famous locally and apparently wealthy. 

By 1882 the number of Japanese courtesans and more common prostitutes had grown well into the hundreds. While Nagasaki still provided the main supply of young women for the Japanese brothels of Shanghai, they also began coming from nearby Shimabara and Amakusa in southern Japan. Morisaki Kazue suggests a number as high as seven or eight hundred, and while that is almost certainly too high a figure it nonetheless does point us to another source of these young women.14 During the same years that enterprising Japanese women came with prospects or improving themselves or their families economically, many others may have been deceived by unscrupulous Japanese with offers of job opportunities which turned into sexual servitude. The early Meiji years were especially harsh times for Japanese villagers, and there was widespread hunger, starvation, and even child abandonment. In addition to blatant opportunism, there were apparently instances in which families conspired to manipulate their daughters’ fates. Morisaki recounts an incident 12  The two readings are read in Mandarin as “Sansan” and ”Shanshan”; and in Japanese both as “Sansan.” In the Shanghai dialect, which is the only standard of importance here, they were pronounced identically.

reported in the Asahi newspaper for March 1, 1879 of a former samurai family in Kagoshima which ran into economic difficulties and applied to the government to ship its female children off to Shanghai where they would be trained as courtesans; they would return when they were able to support themselves. 

All of this assumed a thriving brothel business in the Chinese port. Similarly, once the early Meiji government had banned entrance into courtesanship prior to age fifteen, younger girls headed for the life were often handed over to agents who transported them to the dens of iniquity in Shanghai.15

It would seem that the extant material on Japanese women in the sex trade in Shanghai supports both of the discourses on prostitution in East Asia at this time—the victim discourse and the agency discourse—for the period of the mid­ to late nineteenth century.16 We find references in the sources to women opening brothels and becoming successful \(the agency discourse\) and decidedly unhappy sex workers forced into the business \(the victim discourse\). Although Shanghai was probably the earliest foreign city to which young Japanese women were brought—even earlier than Vladivostok—the numbers of karayukisan \(literally, chose who went to China, or \[more likely\] 

were brought there, the term used for young women transported against their will or in ignorance\) were far fewer than elsewhere in the region. Singapore, Harbin, Hawaii, and elsewhere posted numbers in the thousands. 

A number of volumes from the period include pictures of a Tōyō chakan \(Chinese, Dongyang chaguan, meaning “Japanese teahouse”\) which shows half of the room with Chinese waiters and customers drinking tea and half with a raised tatami on which a Japanese woman is entertaining a Japanese man. One story with a certain amount of credibility is that such an establishment, opened in the early 1880s by a former cook from the Japanese consulate who, having launched his own restaurant which was not doing terribly well, was encouraged to open a teahouse in its stead and to hire only female waitresses age fifteen or younger. That, he was assured, would bring in Chinese customers as 15  Ibid., pp. 90, 92.

well as Japanese.17 In fact, Tōyō chakan was a generic term for Japanese­owned brothels, many of them located on Sima Road \(present­day Fuzhou Road\). One source claims there were sixteen of these concerns in 1880s Shanghai, all but two run by Japanese, with a total or sixty­nine girls working in them.18 As a group they constituted a distinct Japanese red­light district within the world of Shanghai prostitution, and many of the girls working in them would undoubtedly have been karayukisan. 

As they became accustomed to the local scene, the more inventive Japanese women began to pattern their courtesan world more and more to elite Chinese tastes. Like prominent Chinese courtesans of the day, they adopted literary affectations, taking names from Chinese literature. The most famous among them was one “Baoyusheng” \(Baoyu being a famous character in the novel Dream of the Red Chamber and sheng a common suffix\) who reputedly spoke Shanghai dialect with nary an accent. Others included Sanbaosheng, Xinguangsheng, Lantianxian, Enuosheng, and the like. The brothels themselves also bore purposefully exotic names, such as Kaidonglou \(Tower Opening East \[meaning Japan\]\), Meimanshou \(Harmonious Longevity\), Yuchuanlou \(Tower of the Jade Stream\), Yanlige \(Pavilion of Resplendent Beauties\), Buyunge \(Pavilion among the Clouds\), Dongmeige \(Pavilion of Eastern Beauties\), and the like.19

The contemporaneous 1884 Chinese text Shenjiang shengjing tu \(Depictions of famous Shanghai sights\) has a chapter entitled. “Dongyang miaoji shoubo sanxian” \(Charming courtesans from Japan strum the samisen\) in which the author distinguishes two types of Dongying jinü \(Japanese courtesans\). First are the “artistic courtesans \( yiji\) who “specialize in performing \[Japanese\] 

song and dance”; the second are the “erotic courtesans” \( seji\) whose special talents are self­evident.20 Baoyusheng belonged to the former category, and she worked first at the Meimanshou on Qinghe Lane when she arrived in Shanghai at about twenty years of age. By 1884 it was reported that she had moved to the Huajinli \(Village of Colored Brocade\) on nearby Sima Road.21

One reason given for the extensive number of Japanese sundry shops in Shanghai in the early years of Japanese migration to the city was to see to the needs of so many women who perforce strove mightily to retain their physical beauty. The decade ending roughly 1887 represents the high tide of both courtesan culture and prostitution for Japanese in Shanghai. In 1882, the story goes, a gambler by the name of Aoki Gonjirō arrived in Shanghai with several dozen hookers in an effort to launch a full­scale red­light district in West Ward Road area, where he rented over ten storefronts. These efforts all came to naught when the Japanese authorities stepped in, began clamping down on prostitution, and saw to it that Aoki was repatriated.22

As early as 1870 when Yanagihara Sakimitsu \(1850–94\) made his report to the Foreign Ministry about conditions in China, he expressed worry about Japanese being ridiculed abroad for their strange clothing and behavior. Thus, “national dignity” made it incumbent on Japanese overseas that they behave themselves and not embarrass Japan in the modern international community it was belatedly entering. In the spring of 1873 the Foreign Ministry issued a set of guidelines on behavior abroad, Zairyū hōjin kokoroekata kari kisoku \(Provisional regulations for Japanese overseas\). Among the items listed were: only officials may wear weapons; Japanese men and women should wear hats over their hair; women must not walk in public with their arms and legs exposed; and no screaming fights at home.23 These rules—to which several more were added by the Foreign Ministry late that autumn—have the character of sumptuary laws. However, in 1873 Japanese prostitution was not the main issue—it was simply that all Japanese blend in with the background of multinational cities abroad. At the same time, it should be noted that certain among the Chinese authorities were in the 1870s trying to stop the proliferation of Chinese courtesan houses in both the walled Chinese city and the Concessions of Shanghai, and all these measures would become stricter in the 1880s.24

On 24 September 1883, the Japanese authorities issued a new set of regulations specifically for Shanghai: Shinkoku Shanhai kyoryū Nihonjin torishimari kisoku \(Regulations to manage Japanese overseas in Shanghai, China\). These new rules included: one had to follow consular guidelines in setting up a restaurant; one should not travel rashly to the Chinese interior without protec22  Katsuragawa, “Shanhai no Nihonjin shakai,” pp. 42– 43; Ikeda, Shanhai hyakuwa,  p. 15; Chen, “Tōyō chakan.”

tion; women should not without good reason cut their hair and dress like men; when going out, men and women should be properly attired; and irrespective of hairstyle, one should always wear a hat out of doors. Penalties for violations of these rules were modest but not insignificant: between one and ten days incarceration and fines from 5 sen to 1 yen, 95 sen.25

As is often the case with law, this latter set of regulations may indicate precisely what was transpiring in Shanghai, and it certainly reveals an increased consciousness on the part of the authorities in Tokyo—undoubtedly transmitted to them by the Shanghai consulate—that local behavior required some 

“management.” Aoki Gonjirō had been returned to Japan the previous year and his Shanghai businesses shut down. In 1884, shortly after the regulations were promulgated, four consular policemen were dispatched to Shanghai to bring the rise of Japanese women of “questionable character” under control.26 

From a survey of the Japanese cemetery of Shanghai, which has long since ceased to exist, and other death records in the early 1940s, Okita Hajime discovered that a fair number of young women died in Shanghai between April 1883 and February 1891, a high percentage of them prostitutes.27 Research into the role that the authorities played in their deaths or repatriation remains a scholarly desideratum. This process of bringing closer scrutiny and management to Japanese living in Shanghai would continue for the rest of the decade, as the state increasingly sought to keep an eye on the everyday life of its citizens beyond its borders. Many prostitutes left Shanghai for Singapore or Hong Kong or elsewhere in China, and some were sent back to Japan. By 1890 

there had been a dramatic reduction in their numbers from only a few years before. Despite their best efforts, the authorities were never able to stamp out the phenomenon altogether. As a kind of postscript to the golden age of Japanese courtesan life in Shanghai, Tōyama Kagenao noted sarcastically in 25  The text of the Shinkoku Shanhai kyoryu Nihonjin torishimari kisoku is given in Okita, Nihon to Shanhai, pp. 297–98.

a volume published in 1907 that the only Japanese who had been successful in business in these early years of migration were these women of the night.28

One of the most important sources on the topic of Shanghai courtesan culture in the latter half of the nineteenth century is extensive writings on the subject by the famous reformer Wang Tao \(1828–97\), although their veracity remain open to serious doubt. Wang’s one major text which contains material on Japanese courtesans in Shanghai is a large collection of reminiscences that he wrote in his later years, entitled Songyin manlu \(Notes on images from Shanghai, 1887\). This long work, divided into numerous chapters each devoted to one or more courtesans, includes several chapters on Japanese women who had taken up residence in Shanghai brothels. The problem with using this work as a historical source is that it is a mixture of fiction and fact reminiscent of Pu Songling’s \(1640–1715\) famous Liaozhai zhiyi \(Strange stories from Liao studio\) and was in fact recently reprinted in China with the title Hou Liaozhai zhiyi tushuo \(Strange stories from Liao studio, sequel, illustrated and explained\). 

The two chapters directly concerned with our theme are “Dongying cainü” 

\(Japanese woman of talent\) and “Huaxi nüshi xiaozhuan” \(Short biography of Miss Huaxi\).29 They recount Wang’s or others’ becoming enamored of these women, something of their pasts, and how things ultimately turned out. 

Taking them at face value, even critically, can be dangerous, but it might be safe to point to such instances as exemplars of the agency discourse; namely, these were women in control—to Wang’s great consternation in one case—

and suggest closer links structurally to contemporaneous Chinese courtesans.

**Lust for Still Life**

The history of Japanese and East Asian painting is vast and replete with numerous schools, sects, and subsects. The Japanese who ventured to Shanghai and environs from the later 1860s, though, fall into only two discrete schools between whom there was little \(if any\) contact, the Western­style oil painters and the Nanga \(Southern School\) painters. The former’s roots were planted in Japan \(specifically, Nagasaki\) in the eighteenth century by Dutchmen, the only Europeans who had direct contact at that time with Japan; the latter were part of an old tradition rooted in China. For all their differences, though, these were the two groups which produced early visitors and migrants to Shanghai.

**Western-style Painting**

Perhaps contrary to expectation, the Western­oriented oil painters arrived in Shanghai first. The third officially sanctioned mission to Shanghai—after the Senzaimaru and the Kenjunmaru—was a group of nine Japanese who sailed aboard the Ganges, a British steamship, from Yokohama on 15 February 1867. 

The same day that the Ganges left Yokohama, a French vessel, the Alphée, carrying a large official Japanese delegation, set sail from Yokohama as well. The latter group led by Tokugawa Akitake \(Minbu, 1853–1910\), younger brother of the shogun, was set to attend the international exposition in Paris in an official capacity.30 The two ships arrived in Shanghai on the same day at roughly the same time, and as the latter clearly bore men of higher social standing, the men of the Ganges who had planned to take rooms at the famous Astor House Hotel had perforce to spend the night elsewhere. 

Among the Japanese aboard the Ganges was one Takahashi Inosuke \(1828–

94; later Takahashi Yuichi\) who was to become one of the Meiji period’s foremost painters. Years before as a youth, Takahashi had come to the attention of his lord, Hotta Masahira \(1795–1854\) of Sano domain, who strongly encouraged him to pursue his work as an artist and released him from mundane domainal duties to enable him to do so.31 On the day after arriving in Shanghai, Takahashi moved with the entire Japanese group to the large residence of a local businessman and art connoisseur by the name of Wang Renbo who supported Takahashi’s painting pursuits while the latter resided in Shanghai. He remained in the Chinese port city, taking side trips to Suzhou and elsewhere in the lower Yangzi delta, for roughly ten weeks before returning to Japan. 

In addition to a diary, he left a number of sketches of the trip to Shanghai, the harbor, and scenes in the city. During this time, Takahashi had extensive contacts with Chinese painters and other literati, attended local Chinese theater, met several Japanese then present in Shanghai \(such as the ubiquitous Kishida Ginkō, 1833–1905\), and soaked up as much of the local atmosphere as 30  For a full treatment of this mission, see Miyanaga Takashi, Purinsu Akitake no Ōshū kikō.

he could.32 However, the impact of this trip on his art or the movement in art in which he played such an important role remains in serious doubt. 

Another painter who would make his name in oils, Yamamoto Hōsui \(1850–

1910\), initially wanted to study Nanga painting, and to that end he traveled first to Kyoto and then to Yokohama where he arrived in 1868. Yokohama was certainly no home for traditional Japanese arts, but it was a place where, given the right circumstances, he might be able to catch a steamer for China. For all his efforts, though, the opportunity to make the voyage to Shanghai never materialized. In the most Westernized of Japanese cities, he came across the Westernoriented oil painting of Goseda Yoshimatsu \(1855–1915\) and was so taken with it that he remained there and entered Goseda’s school.33

In both Takahashi’s and Yamamoto’s cases, Shanghai was not an object in and of itself. Takahashi was simply caking advantage of an opportunity for fresh inspiration, while Yamamoto viewed Shanghai and elsewhere in the region first and foremost as the places to go to study traditional Nanga painting. Their cases would probably not be so exceptional had they not occurred so early in the history of modern Sino­Japanese contacts in Shanghai. The case of the Nanga painters who made the trip to Shanghai from the late 1860s specifically because it was a center of Nanga painting was altogether different.

**The Southern School**

To tell their stories properly, though, requires some background on the artistic connections between Nagasaki and the mainland going back earlier in the Edo period. Throughout the period, Nagasaki was the only city in Japan that had a considerable Chinese community, including over time a number of important painters who often acquired Japanese disciples during their years of residence in the southwestern Japanese port. Nanga was just one of many schools of painting in Japan—indeed, there were half a dozen prominent ones 32  His diary has been reprinted in Aoki Shigeru, ed., Meiji Yōga shiryō. kirokuhen \(Historical materials on Western painting in the Meiji period, documents section\) \(Tokyo, 1986\), pp. 13–22.

in Nagasaki itself. Like the style of painting spread by the Ōbaku sect of Zen Buddhism, all of whose abbots came from China over the course of the seventeenth, eighteenth, and early nineteenth centuries, Nanga was extremely Sinophilic and closely tied to artistic trends on the mainland. Japanese adherents of Nanga painting drew their inspiration almost exclusively from Chinese paintings and masters, and a steady scream of the latter flowed into Nagasaki.34

The “southern” in this group’s name had nothing to do with Nagasaki’s geography but came from the origins this group traced to the Southern School of Chan Buddhism in Tang times, although its principal antecedents were in the high Ming. Because, like its sister school in China, it laid such heavy emphasis on the high level of education of painters in related bookish disciplines and in its studied knowledge of the history of painting, it often overlapped with “literati painting” or bunjinga.  Many painters in this school spent years, for example, painting pictures of Chinese landscapes they could never have seen—and that no one they ever met could have seen—based on the paintings of such titans as Dong Qichang \(1555–1636\) of the Ming, centuries earlier. 

Among the Chinese painters who came to Nagasaki in the eighteenth century, the first important name was Yi Fujiu \(from Wuxing County, Jiangsu\). He first arrived in 1720, carrying the trading license of his elder brother, Yi Taoji, who had been ordered by the Nagasaki Magistrate—on behalf of the shogun himself—to bring three horses to Japan; it was literally illegal to export horses from China, because of potential military needs, and Yi Fujiu perforce had to escort the animals off his ship in the dead of night for fear other Chinese in Nagasaki might observe him. He was equally important as the merchant responsible for bringing a number of valuable Japanese texts back to China, and despite his virtual anonymity in the annals of Chinese painting \(to this day, his dates remain a mystery\), he was the progenitor of the trend to introduce 34  There is an immense literature on Nanga painting.

literati painting of the Nanga School to Japan. Among the Japanese who were much influenced by him was Ike no Taiga \(1723–76\).35

Another Chinese to distinguish himself at a painter in Nagasaki was Fei Hanyuan who arrived in 1734. He was followed later in the century by his relative Fei Qinghu. Both were landscape painters who, while in Nagasaki, acquired disciples anxious to study with real Chinese. In the Tenmei era \(1781–89\), Zhang Qiugu made his way to Nagasaki where in 1788 he carried on a famous “brush conversation” \(the typical manner in which literate Chinese and Japanese 

“conversed”—using literary Chinese as their written medium\) with the official Japanese interpreter, at which Fei Qinghu was in attendance. As a young man, the well­known Japanese painter Tani Bunchō \(1763–1840\) traveled from Edo to study with Zhang. Over the course of the century, as many as one hundred Chinese painters would make their influence felt in Nagasaki, many of them Nanga artists. Despite their impact on the history of Japanese art, though, for virtually none of these Chinese do we even have dates.36 Perhaps most important to our story of Chinese influence on Japanese painting was Jiang Jiapu, a man completely unknown in the history of Chinese art but central to the development of the Nanga School in Japan. Jiang hailed from the Hangzhou area of Zhejiang Province and first came to Nagasaki in 1804 as well as many times thereafter. Although he seems to have passed the first stage of the civil service examinations back home, he ultimately failed or ceased trying, and subsequently devoted himself to painting in a highly serious, strict style, while earning his living as a merchant.37 He was especially good at landscapes, and during his extended stays in Japan, he directly influenced the work of such 35  See the entry on him by Yonezawa Yoshiho in Ajia rekishi jiten** **\(Encyclopedia of Asian history\), vol. 1 \(Tokyo, 1959\), p. 199.

major figures as Hidaka Tetsuō \(1790–1871\), Kinoshita Itsuun \(1799–1866\), and Miura Gomon \(1808–60\), known collectively as the “three Nagasaki Nanga masters,” among many others. 

When he was Jiang’s student, Tetsuō was a monk at the Shuntoku Temple, founded in 1630 and for two centuries the site at which books brought from China were inspected for violations of the strict regulations on interdicted texts. He would serve for many years as its abbot and nurture numerous young Japanese interested in Nanga painting who traveled to Nagasaki from all over the home islands. For all his efforts, Tetsuō never seems to have excelled as an artist to the extent that several of his contemporaries and disciples would, but he proved to be an extraordinary teacher and facilitator of human contacts.38

The most active painter in Nagasaki at this time appears to have been Kinoshita Itsuun. A native of the city, he was an energetic organizer and painting teacher who ran shows and took in numerous pupils willing to work assiduously at the Nanga style of art. His hearts desire was to visit the putative homeland of Nanga in China, but that goal always managed to elude him—it being illegal on pain of death to leave Japan throughout most of his life. In his home Kinoshita reputedly would travel mentally to the mainland by studying two paintings he had acquired: Zhang Qiugu’s Emeishan yue \(The moon at Emei Mountain \[Sichuan\]\) and Jiang Jiapu’s Xihu shui yun \(Clouds over West Lake \[Hangzhou\]\).39

Among Kinoshita’s most famous and devoted disciples was Nagai Unpei \(1833–99\) who came from the town of Nuttari in Echigo domain \(present­day Niigata Prefecture\). Born in the midst of the Tenpō famine to a father who worked as a barber but spent much of his time drinking and a mother who raised him and his two brothers in dire poverty, Unpei somehow discovered painting early in life. Despite his father’s wishes for him to follow in the family 38  Chen Zhenlian, Jindai Zhong-Ri huihua jiaoliu shi bijiao yanjiu \(Comparative studies in the history of modern Sino­Japanese relations in painting\) \(Hefei, 2000\), pp. 31–32; Kawakita Michiaki, ed., Kindai Nihon bijutsu jiten** **\(Dictionary of modern Japanese art\) \(Tokyo, 1989\), p. 294; Suzuki Kei, “Kō Kaho” \(Jiang Jiapu\), in Ajia rekishi jiten, ** **3:200; Shimizu, Gajin Nagai Unpei, pp. 37–39; Umesawa, Nihon nanga shi, ** **pp. 871–78; and Yanagi, Kindai kaiga to bunjinga no chisei, ** **pp. 60–61.

profession, Unpei despised cutting hair. This attitude led to frequent paternal beatings and ultimately to Unpei’s running away from home as a teenager. His uncle placed him in the home of a local doctor who fostered the lad’s interest in calligraphy and taught him the Confucian classics and other Chinese texts. He also found for Unpei a local Nanga­style painter, Makabe Setchō, who had studied some years before with Tetsuō in Nagasaki. Makabe opened up a world of calligraphy, painting, and Chinese learning in Japan to Unpei through connections to the work of the great Edo calligrapher Maki Ryōko \(1777–1843\), his teacher Kameda Hōsai \(or Bōsai, 1752–1826\), and others. Through a local priest, Unpei was introduced as well to the work of the artist Kushiro Unsen \(1758–1811\), who was born in Shimabara, raised in nearby Nagasaki, and studied Chinese learning and language with Chinese residents there. Kushiro counted among his friends and traveling companions the likes of Rai San’yō 

\(1780–1832\), Uragami Shunkin \(1779–1846\), Yamamoto Baiitsu \(1783–1856\), and Kimura Kenkadō \(1736–1802\), the cream of late eighteenth­century mainlandoriented scholars and painters.40

At age fifteen, Unpei’s taste for studying Nanga painting directly with masters in Nagasaki was such that he simply decided to set off on the long journey despite the opposition of virtually everyone around him. In 1848, this was a major undertaking for a teenager, especially given the shogunate’s restrictions of domestic travel. Traveling overland, he reached Japan’s sole international port some six months later and went straight away to introduce himself to Tetsuō who later took him to meet Kinoshita. The latter was immediately taken with Unpei’s seriousness—many people came to study Nanga painting in Nagasaki, but few of them showed such apparent purpose and fewer still were teenagers. Kinoshita effectively took the youngster under his wing, trained him as a painter and calligrapher, and even offered suggestions for Unpei’s ultimate decision to adopt that particular given name. Through Kinoshita, Unpei also met a number of Chinese painters who had taken refuge in Nagasaki from the Taiping Rebellion.41

Our story now must shift to the mainland. The great Taiping Rebellion was raging through the lower Yangzi provinces during the 1850s and early 1860s.

the 1840s, the international community of Shanghai had begun the process of sealing itself off from Chinese jurisdictional scrutiny, and as a result during the rebellion, many Chinese scholars, painters, and other literati from the nearby cultural centers of Hangzhou, Suzhou, Wuxi, and elsewhere—to say nothing of tens of Thousands of common folk—took refuge in the Concessions in the hope of avoiding the Taiping devastations they had witnessed and heard of in other places. Accordingly, the population of Shanghai swelled to bloated proportions. The art world was affected in several ways. One such was that a large number of elite Chinese artists, in an effort to save themselves and escape the Taipings, made their way to Shanghai, and several of them traveled as far as Nagasaki. 

Two such emigré painters whose names appear repeatedly in the sources, but who have managed to escape virtually every reference work, were Wang Kesan \(Daotai\) and Xu Yuting \(b. 1824\). Wang was from Zhejiang Province, and he was hailed in Japan as the greatest Chinese calligrapher to reach Japan since Jiang Jiapu. To this day, his calligraphy appears in a local Nagasaki festival in the Kōjiyamachi section of that city. He arrived in Nagasaki in 1862 and had frequent contact there with Unpei, Kinoshita, and others in the Nanga circle of painters and offered frequent calligraphic advice to the young artists in the city. About this time, in the spring of 1864, Kinoshita decided that Unpei was ready to go out on his own; he had been living in Nagasaki for sixteen years, but was still apprenticed to Kinoshita and all but unknown. With inspiration from both his teacher and Wang, Unpei had continued to labor, as he saw it, to create an authentic Nanga tradition in Japan that was directly affiliated with the same tradition in China. In the late summer or early fall of 1864, Wang visited Unpei before his return to Shanghai. They exchanged paintings, and Wang suggested that Unpei consider making the voyage to Shanghai at some point in the near future to further the efflorescence of Nanga exchanges between their two countries.42

As noted above, the Nanga School in Japan had for many years past continued to paint scenery always derived from the lower Yangzi region of China, scenery which \(of course\) did not exist anywhere in Japan and which none of them would ever have actually scene. It was as if these mountains and valleys, temples and rural huts were ideal types—in any event, idealized for all East Asian literati painters. The worldview of Nanga was thus decidedly Sinophilic, a worldview of people living in another world. Xu Yuting, also from Zhejiang, arrived in Nagasaki even earlier, in 1861, and he quickly became active in the 42  Umesawa, Nihon nanga shi, p. 867; Shimizu, Gajin Nagai Unpei, pp. 52–55, 56–57; http://

local painting community over the next few years. Whereas Wang was a master of calligraphy and plum tree painting, Xu was famed for his ink landscapes. 

Among the local painting students, Xu took on one Yasoshima Shakyō \(1832–

1916\) and praised his work to the skies.43 By 1867 Xu, too, was back in China. 

In early 1800 Kinoshita decided to make a trip to Edo to visit a brother of his who lived near the capital. Faithful disciple that he was, Unpei planned to join him, but he became extremely ill and was unable to make the sea voyage from Nagasaki. Kinoshita wrote from Edo to say that, should Unpei recover, he might join him, but Unpei’s illness persisted. Late that summer, the vessel carrying Kinoshita and over fifty others left the port of Yokohama en route back to Nagasaki and was never seen again.44 All were lost at sea, and Kinoshita had died without ever being able to satisfy his lifelong ambition of seeing the real scenery of China. 

In early 1865, Unpei made the acquaintance of another young painter in Nagasaki who would be instrumental in convincing him to try to make the trip to Shanghai. Ishikawa Kansen \(b. 1844\) came from Etchū domain \(contemporary Toyama Prefecture\), not far from Unpei’s hometown, and despite his youth had, like Unpei and many others, come to Nagasaki to study Nanga painting at the Shuntoku Temple. He was preparing an album and wanted Unpei to contribute the first piece to it. The second piece, he hoped, would be supplied by either Yasuda Rōzan \(Mamoru, 1828/1830–83\) or Chūjō Untei \(1834–66\); about the former, we shall have much to say below, while the latter was sadly to die with Kinoshita, his teacher, whom he accompanied on the illfated trip from Yokohama. Unpei and Kansen became fast friends. At Kansen’s suggestion, they and others adorned kites with their artwork for the kite­flying festivities in Nagasaki, and they continued to meet periodically and talk about their work. In the spring of the following year, 1866, they shared concerns about all the tumult occurring—the assault on Shimonoseki the previous year, the Chōshū wars, the Namamugi Incident in which a British man was murdered in Japan, and other events portending big changes.45

Unpei admitted to his friend that he wanted, at long last, to see a Jiang Jiapu landscape with the genuine eyes of the founders of Southern School painting, meaning he wanted to go to China. Much more entrepreneurial than Unpei, Kansen too expressed a similar desire, but it was still technically illegal for individuals to do so. They both knew of Yoshida Shōin’s \(1830–59\) unsuccessful and ultimately fatal effort to stow away on one of Commodore Perry’s vessels bound for the United States in 1854, a story immortalized in the West in 1878 by Robert Louis Stevenson. Shōin, though, had wanted to visit the distant barbarian West, while they only wanted to travel a few days away to nearby Shanghai to view landscapes from the greatest culture in the world. 

Unpei ultimately came upon the ideal intermediary who would facilitate their voyage. On several occasions he had met a naturalized American missionary born in the Netherlands, Guido Herman Fridolin Verbeck \(1830–98\), who had come to Nagasaki in late 1859 on behalf of the Dutch Reformed Church. En route to Japan, the ship carrying him and his wife had called at the port of Shanghai where he left his wife within the Western community before heading off to set up shop in Nagasaki, a site at which Westerners \(let alone missionaries\) had not lived among the Japanese for over two centuries. It was there several years later that Takasugi Shinsaku, waiting several months for the Senzaimaru to be cleared for departure to Shanghai, met Verbeck. Already fluent in Dutch, English, French, and German, Verbeck was keenly interested in acquiring Japanese as quickly as possible to aid in his work. He also developed a keen interest in Nanga style painting and often visited Kinoshita’s school, met with his students, and asked numerous questions. In April 1864 

he moved temporarily with his family to Shanghai to escape the tense atmosphere surrounding all foreigners in Japan as a result of the many antiforeign incidents and assassinations associated with late Tokugawa times. He returned to Nagasaki soon thereafter to continue his teaching and missionary work—he counted among his students several of the luminaries of the coming Meiji era: Soejima Taneomi \(1828–1905\), Itō Hirobumi \(1841–1909\), Ōkuma Shigenobu \(1838–1922\), and Yokoi Shōnan \(1809–69\), among others.46

After Kinoshita’s death, Unpei had lost his anchor in life. He finally decided that the best way he could repay his gratitude toward his late teacher was to see the scenery of the lower Yangzi region with his own eyes. He knew as well that Verbeck had made the voyage between Nagasaki and Shanghai several times and would undoubtedly help them. In the spring of 1867, he visited Verbeck 46  Morii Makoto, “Furubekki” \(Verbeck\), in Nihon shi dai jiten \(Encyclopedia of Japanese history\), vol. 5 \(Tokyo, 1995\), p. 1351; Yanagi, Kindai kaiga to bunjinga no chisei, p. 61; Shimizu, Gajin Nagai Unpei, pp. 68–69.

and laid out his secret plan. The American agreed to help, though he continued the discussion by seeking Unpei’s views on Christianity. Unpei pleaded ignorance. Verbeck explained that he had recently spoken at length with Kansen about the Christian faith, and indeed after he returned from their trip to China, Kansen actually converted. When he learned that Unpei had already begun planning a trip to the mainland, Kansen begged him to come along, and soon Yasuda Rōzan made his similar desires known. But, despite loosening of the shogunate’s severe travel restrictions, it was still technically illegal for them to travel as individuals and certainly without the consent of their lords. That was where Verbeck could help. 

Verbeck was able to secure passage for them on a foreign trading vessel plying the Nagasaki­Shanghai route. When Unpei became too ill to travel shortly before their scheduled departure, Rōzan and Kansen were simply too anxious to wait. They donned queue wigs—all Chinese males during the Manchu Qing dynasty were required to wear their hair in the queue \(pig­tail\)—and thus disguised themselves for passage as Chinese servants. Unpei followed them soon thereafter in June 1867, concealing his identity beneath the garb of a Chinese monk, on another trading vessel, the Fei-loong \(sometimes rendered Fe-loong in the North China Herald, the same ship that brought the “Japanese ladies” mentioned above to Shanghai from Nagasaki later that year and next\), arranged by Verbeck. With the help of a Chinese he met on board ship and a monk he met in Shanghai soon after arriving, Unpei located his Nagasaki friends, Rōzan and Kansen, at a local inn. The three young men agreed to assume \(fairly pretentious\) pen names while in Shanghai and environs; the fact that they are never referred to in Chinese sources by these names \(and only in Japanese sources to tell this story\) leads me to conclude that the names never stuck: Wujiang for Unpei, Wushan for Kansen, and Wushui for Rōzan. The “Wu” element was the name of an ancient state located in the lower Yangzi delta.47

A word about the third member of this party, Yasuda Rōzan, is now in order. 

Despite the skimpy and often contradictory details available on him, he is usually accorded the honor of being the most important early Japanese painter to visit the Shanghai area. He was certainly the first Japanese to settle in Shanghai for a considerable length of time. He hailed from a family of samurai doctors from a village near the famous Yōrō Waterfall in Takasu domain, Mino \(present­day Gifu Prefecture\). In addition to his medical training, Yasuda acquired a consuming interest in calligraphy. He eventually left his hometown and set47  Shimizu Hiroshi, Gajin Nagai Unpei, pp. 74–76; Yamakawa Takeshi, ed., Nagai Unpei, pp. 214, 224, Fujisawa Makoro, “Nagai Unpei, no Shinshū jinbutsu ki, bijutsuka den,  p. 170: Furukawa Osamu, “Nagai Unpei no tamashii ni atau,” p. 38.

tled in Iida village in nearby Shinano domain \(present­day Nagano Prefecture\) where he attempted to make a living as a doctor. His next­door neighbor was a salt warehouse owner by the name of Ihara Shigebee, and Yasuda eventually married his neighbor’s daughter Kyū \(1847–72\), despite the great difference in their social classes. With his medical practice not faring well, he decided to relocate with his wife to Edo, and later they moved on to Nagasaki. There, in the late 1850s or early 1860s, he began studying Nanga painting with Tetsuō at the Shuntoku Temple.48

Most sources—all apparently repeating each other—claim that he unilaterally moved to Shanghai in 1864 \(a few say 1868\), but I have now concluded that 1867 was the date of his departure for the mainland both because of the circumstances described above and because of the contemporaneous diary of Okada Kōsho \(1820–1903\). Okada was a scholar of Chinese learning who settled in Nagasaki and a medical doctor as well. In March 1872, he set sail on a two­month trip to Shanghai and Suzhou. “From my youth,” he explained in his account written in literary Chinese, “I have always thought of traveling to China, but the government banned travel, so I could not go \[abroad\]. I waited for a chance. After the \[Meiji\] Restoration \[of 1868\], the ban \[on travel\] was lifted, and I was able to do so.”49 Soon after arriving, he visited the recently opened Japanese consulate, introduced himself to Japans first consul in China, Shinagawa Tadamichi, and the next day paid a call on Yasuda Rōzan. “I visited him today and met him and his wife together,” Okada reports. “While drinking wine, we happily passed the time as he regaled me with stories from the past. . . . Rōzan has been living in Shanghai for four or five years and speaks Chinese rather well. . . . He pays his expenses with paintings and calligraphy. 

His wife, Hongfeng, is also a painter of orchids and bamboo.”50

In 1870 Yasuda returned briefly to Japan to collect his wife and bring her with him to share his life back in Shanghai. Kyū changed her given name at this time to Ai, and, as indicated by Okada, she became known in her own right as a painter in Shanghai under the name of “Hongfeng nüshi” \(Ms. Red Maple Tree\). She died there in the summer of 1872 at the tender age of twenty­five and was buried to the west of the Longhua pagoda; her remains were later removed to the Japanese cemetery which had not yet been founded at the time of her death, and the stone inscription was prepared by none other than the great artist and calligrapher Hu Gongshou \(Yuan, 1823–86; see below\).51

For all their shared desire to see China in the flesh, our three Japanese Nanga travelers had little to do with one another after they arrived in Shanghai. Their collective first impression of Shanghai was that it was infinitely more prosperous than they had ever imagined, but after that they drifted off in their own directions. Rōzan settled in for the better part of a decade, and the record on Kansen’s whereabouts dries up at this point. Unpei had planned for a long stay, but those plans were cut short when he became ill and had to return home. 

Shortly after his arrival he cracked down his Chinese acquaintance from several years earlier in Nagasaki, Wang Kesan. He and Xu Yuting both lived in or near Shanghai, and they saw to Unpei’s every need. Wang introduced him not only to the city of Shanghai, but more importantly to the new Shanghai School of painting which was emerging in the city and—Unpei was decidedly underwhelmed. 



**The Shanghai School and Japan**

As the Taiping Rebellion had forced countless artists to take refuge in the relative safety of Shanghai, a new mix of painters and calligraphers in the city brought into being a new “Shanghai School” \(Haipai\). A leading figure in this new movement was the aforementioned Hu Gongshou, a Southern School keen observer of the women of Shanghai, noted in the collection of jottings cited above: 

“Mr. Yasu\[da\] Rōzan from Japan . . . has long lived in Shanghai and produced many works. 

He has done ink drawings of plum trees and landscapes.” \( Songnan mengying lu, p. 102\). 

51  In the Japanese cemetery, Kyū’s gravestone carried the following inscription on its front: 

“Grave of Hongfeng nüshi from Japan, inscribed by Hu Gongshou from Huating.” The back reads: “Hongfeng nüshi of Japan was surnamed Ihara, had the given name Ai, and was also known as Teisha. She was the wife of Yasuda Rōzan \(Mamoru\). She painted orchids and bamboo beautifully. She had a fine hand for calligraphy and was a lovely woman. She came to live with Rōzan in Shanghai in Tongzhi 9 \[1870\]. She died on the twenty­third day of the seventh lunar month of Tongzhi 11 \[1872\]. She was twenty­six \[ sui\]. Rōzan brought the coffin and she was buried on the western side of the Longhua Temple. This was written when the stone was erected.” Cited in Yonezawa, Shanhai shiwa, pp. 166–67.

painter but with eclectic interests. Yasuda Rōzan began studying with Hu soon after reaching Shanghai, and the two men became good friends. As Dr. Okada noted of Rōzan in his diary: ”He has frequent contacts with Hu Gongshou.”52 

Hu was born in Jiangsu Province and was renowned in his day as a poet, calligrapher, and artist. He fled to Shanghai in 1861** **to avoid the Taipings, and there he eked out his living selling his own art work, establishing contacts with such painters as Hu Bishan \(1817–62\), Li Renshu \(Shanlan, 1811–82\), and Xugu \(1823–

96\). Hu later gained great renown in his day, acquiring students from as far away as Japan who wished to study Nanga School painting, such as Rōzan and others, from a real Chinese exponent.53

In the world of Chinese painting, the Shanghai School was far from universally respected. Indeed, some used the term Haipai more as an epithet than as an apposite group designation. According to their critics, one of the traits of this school was shoddiness or crudeness. This point was emphasized by Masaki Naohiko \(1862–1940\), head of the Tokyo Art School, when he visited Shanghai in 1931 and saw a show at the Shanghai Art School. Four years later, he remarked after seeing a show of Chinese art in Tokyo: “They have displayed there the careless paintings of the Shanghai School.”54

Stressing the positive, James Cahill has argued that the Shanghai School was the ”most vibrant movement“ in nineteenth­ and twentieth­century Chinese painting. It drew its roots from the Yangzhou School of the eighteenth century. 

At that earlier time and place, a wealthy and highly cultivated mercantile elite sponsored artists, and their elevated tastes influenced what was painted—if only because they were the ones buying the artists’ works; and while money clearly was the common denominator in this equation, there remained a sense of shared elite cultural values. Perhaps most important was the fact that in the eighteenth century most artists were also officials, their “legitimate“ livelihood. 

In the mid­nineteenth century, the merchant­artist relationship was replicated in Shanghai, only now the entire relationship was solely based on money. 

Artists like Hu Gongshou worked for money and painted what their patrons wanted. “The painter,“ writes Cahill, “typically, was not trying so much to inculcate a higher taste in his audience as he was responding to the audience’s taste in his paintings. The result is that much of Shanghai School painting moves 52  Okada, Ko Go nikki, 1/4a.

further than before into the realm of popular art, to the verge of what in earlier centuries would have been thought low­class or vulgar.”55

As with so many things associated with Shanghai—such as Shanghai dialect and Shanghai cuisine—the Shanghai style in painting was actually an amalgam of trends brought from elsewhere and crushed in the pestle of the rapidly growing city from the mid­nineteenth century on. Although the Taipings never penetrated beyond the outskirts of the city, their actions in the nearby towns and villages forever changed the appearance and population of Shanghai. By the early 1860s, there were surely more nonnative painters in Shanghai than native ones, and the new Shanghai capitalists were, like their Yangzhou brethren earlier, becoming patrons of the arts. As Stella Yu Lee has noted, unlike earlier, Shanghai artists were not officials and, thus having no “real job” to fall back on, painted for money to survive. “Shanghai patronage,” she adds, “differed from that of Yangzhou in being broadened by the introduction of new buyers. 

Some of the most famous of them were merchants from southern China and tradesmen from Japan.”56

Because of the shared traditions in painting and calligraphy going back centuries, nor only were the Japanese the first painters to come to China to engage in serious study, but they were also the first patrons to enter the Shanghai art scene from abroad. In an 1884 work cited earlier, Shenjiang shengjing tu, there is an extraordinary drawing of two Japanese authenticating and purchasing a Chinese scroll in a Shanghai art shop.57 Writing in 1919, the critic Yang Yi \(1864–1929\) similarly noted of one calligrapher: “Xu Fangzeng . . . from Pinghu lived in Shanghai in the early years of the Tongzhi period \[1862–75\]. He excelled in the archaic script and copied Han tomb inscriptions. . . .  Japanese profoundly appreciated his calligraphy, buying and returning home with many of his works.”58

Thus, Chinese fleeing the Taipings and later just coming to live off their art came to Shanghai because they had learned that it was China’s most important commercial city and that one might survive by painting alone. For the same reason, Japanese wished to reach Shanghai, either to study painting with an authentic master or to corner a market. Nothing like this confluence of events had ever transpired in Chinese art history: migration from other cities with major cultural histories to Shanghai, the emergence of a modern Chinese capitalist class, and the arrival of Japanese in the city. 

Hu Gongshou became the teacher of a number of Japanese aspiring to learn at a Chinese knee. In addition to Yasuda Rōzan and his wife, these included Murata Kōkoku \(1831–1912\) from Hakata in Fukuoka domain on the island of Kyūshū. He initially studied with his father, Murata Tōho; in 1864 he traveled to Kyoto to study with the Confucian scholar and painter Nukina Kaioku \(1778–

1863\). Eight years later he made his way to Nagasaki to study with Tetsuō; he later met Kinoshita and other literati painters, including Xu Yuting. He made three trips to China, circa 1876, to see the landscape he had so often seen represented in Chinese paintings and to study with Ha and Zhang Zixiang \(Xiong, 1803–86\).59

One final name in the vein is Amano Hōko \(1828–4\) from Ehime domain on the island of Shikoku. He was a landscape painter of the Nanga School who traveled to Kyoto to study with Nakabayashi Chikutō \(1776–1853\); when Chikutō died, he moved on to Nagasaki and studied under Kinoshita. From there he went on to Shanghai, together with his fellow Ehime local Tsuzuki Kunshō \(1835–83\), also a Nanga painter, to study with Hu. After a number of trips to Shanghai, he settled back in Kyoto in the mid­1870s and played a major role in the world of literati painting.60

seals, and stone engravings. In gentry­official families, not only were the collections of those art works rich, but the people were able to distinguish authentic works from fakes, and good works from bad ones. If they discovered something they liked, although it was only a small piece of rock or a few inches of silk, they would spend a thousand gold coins to buy it without a second thought.”

Perhaps underscoring his contacts with Japanese artists as well as his growing fame and fortune, Wang Tao included a poem about Hu Gongshou in his Yingruan zazhi \(Miscellanies by the ocean\), one line of which reads: “A piece 

\[from Hu’s hand\] is worth a dry in Japan.”61 By the same token, this phrase suggests—as was often later suggested about Pablo Picasso—that anything Hu painted was worth its weight in gold, and he knew it. As was noted at the time, he was together with the famed courtesan Hu Baoyu and the extraordinarily rich compradore Hu Xueyan \(1823–85\) one of the “three Hus” of Shanghai.62

A direct tie between Wang Tao and Yasuda Rōzan has yet to be made, but in light of the fact that Rōzan was the longest­term Japanese student of Hu Gongshou as well as of the appearance of his name in contemporary Chinese sources, it is highly likely that Wang at least knew of him. Dr. Okada stressed how helpful Rōzan was to him as well as to other Japanese who came to Shanghai for longer or shorter periods of time. This group went far beyond artists, however, and included \(among others\) Admiral Kabayama Sukenori \(1837–1922\), famed as the first Japanese governor general of Taiwan from 1895 

but who visited the mainland much earlier. When he arrived in Shanghai in the early 1870s as part of Foreign Minister Soejima’s encourage, he met with Rōzan, and the latter with his extensive knowledge of the local scene offered the future admiral his store of information.63 By all accounts, Rōzan left Shanghai and returned home in 1873, the year after his wife’s death. He settled in Tokyo and was extremely successful as an artist and a teacher. 

As hinted earlier, Unpei was less than enthralled by the Shanghai School of painting to which Wang Kesan introduced him in 1867. Unpei was more interested in viewing the scenery of the lower Yangzi delta and meeting pure Southern School painters. In Suzhou he renewed his acquaintance with Xu \(Outlines of painting in Iyo\), ibid., p. 26; ** **Matsuyama shishi henshū iinkai, Matsuyama shishi, vol. 3: kindai \(History of Matsuyama city, vol. 3: Modern period\) \(Matsuyama, 1995\), p. 680; ** **Berry, Unexplored Avenues of Japanese Painting, pp. 114, 195; www.shogaya.com/

Yuting who, knowing the importance of pedigree, introduced him to local painters as a Japanese calligrapher and student of Kinoshita and Tetsuō who was himself a student of Jiang Jiapu. In addition to the standard list of cultural sites, Unpei also wanted to visit the sacred Buddhist Mount Tiantai, but Wang thought it still too dangerous for him to go alone, only a few years after the defeat of the Taipings, with public order in rural China still unstable. He was guided by a friend of Wang’s as well as by a monk from the Tiantai complex. 

This part of the trip enabled Unpei to commune with the generations—Jiang Jiapu had visited this site three times in painting a famous scroll of it, and this trip through space thus took on the aura for Unpei of a trip through time as well into the authentic world of Nanga art. Illness ultimately got the better of Unpei who was forced in the spring of. 1868 to leave his erstwhile Japanese companions, Rōzan and Kansen, and return to Japan alone.64

Unpei had been gone roughly a year, 1867–68, arguably the most important year in modern Japanese history, but to someone who effectively was mentally living in another place and time, one can only surmise how much the events of the Meiji Restoration would have meant for him had he been in Japan. He seeded in Tokyo in 1870. Rōzan settled there a few years later, but there was never much love lost between the two men. Unpei had demonstrated a predilection for the sanctity of painting in the Southern School tradition, while Rōzan seems to have been drawn more the Shanghai Schools eclecticism and its ties to filthy lucre. Whether they actually had a falling out is unclear, but they had little to do with one another. 

One other Japanese figure, a Nanga painter who traveled to Shanghai to nurture his skills, was a man known as Ōkura Uson \(Kingo\). He came from Echigo like Unpei and from a family of doctors like Rōzan, but what he most shared with these two was an overriding desire to paint. His father forbade him from doing so, but when the father died, Uson made his way to Nagasaki where he began studying with Tetsuō. In the early 1870s he traveled to Shanghai, though not as a painter but as a low­level clerk in the Foreign Office. In his spare time, he pursued his first love, making wide acquaintances in the world of Chinese painting.65

**Why Shanghai? **

What then was the attraction of Shanghai in particular for the Japanese who came there in the late 1860s and 1870s? Do the prostitutes and painters discussed above have anything in common behind their desires to reach that city? 

The one overarching connection between these two groups and among all those Japanese who actively sought to reach Shanghai has, I suspect, as much to do with reaching that Chinese place as it does with leaving Japan. Although they happen to be located in different countries, both of which strictly curtailed travel for several centuries before the 1860s, Nagasaki and Shanghai are closer than Nagasaki was to Edo \(renamed Tokyo after the Meiji Restoration of 1868\). Before the days of steamships, navigation might take several days between Nagasaki and Shanghai, but it would have taken much longer to go overland to the Japanese capital. 

For educated Japanese to want to see what many considered the homeland of culture itself in China should not seem at all odd.66 It may be difficult to appreciate now, but in the 1860s when the possibility of travel opened up, Japanese educated in traditional continental disciplines were a sizable group of those who went to observe the real China. They were not all necessarily pleased with the reality they discovered there—reality, as we all know, is often overrated—but, like the Nanga painters we have just depicted, they were virtually always thrilled to be able to commune spiritually with the landscape and often the descendants of the great masters of the past. 

This explanation, though, helps little in understanding why Japanese prostitutes sought out Shanghai. Certainly there were more clients there and much more money. There was as well a great deal more freedom of movement—

again, not simply because it was Shanghai but also because it was not Japan. It seems as well that the better known of these courtesans could simultaneously savor that distance from the tight­knit, restrictive communities of Japan and become the toasts of Shanghai because they were \(exotic\) Japanese—singing Japanese songs no one else knew or understood, and dancing in Japanese fashion and playing the samisen, both appreciated because they appeared so alien \(“Oriental?”\), even as they cultivated the Shanghai dialect or Chinese. 

Shanghai was justifiably hailed as a wide open city where money bought privilege and where ones earlier baggage could easily be discarded \(if one wished\) at the port. It was both the real China and a bizarrely transfigured China in which so many Westerners and many Chinese from elsewhere lived. 

66  This is a theme I develop in chaps. 2 and 3 of The Literature of Travel in the Japanese Rediscovery of China.

Because of the Westerners, a community almost entirely of merchants and a handful of missionaries who were living in the city, and because of the Chinese who took advantage of their presence there, as Shanghai rapidly grew it commercialized everything it touched. In many cases, that meant that it cheapened everything chat passed through it. In a broad sense, the Shanghai School of painting was a form of “prostitution” in which the former well­trained “courtesans” of Yangzhou sold themselves to the highest bidders once they reached the metropolis of Shanghai. The city offered Japanese women of capacity opportunities for self­advancement by commercially objectifying traditional arts for the pleasures of men of means there. 

Eventually the Japanese population would grow in the second decade of the twentieth century to outstrip all other foreign communities in Shanghai, and then by the 1930s to outstrip all foreigners combined, reaching 100,000 by the early 1940s. In the last decades of the nineteenth century, it was on a much more modest scale, though still larger than any Japanese settlement elsewhere in China.67 In other words, Japanese were seeking it out specifically.

**On Translating Shiba Ryōtarō into English**

Unlike any other people of whom I am aware, the Japanese have developed, especially in the postwar era, a virtually insatiable appetite for historical fiction. They are willing to buy and read, as well as watch televisions productions of, numerous tales from their history, told and retold, repeatedly. Based largely on personal impression over the years, it seems that the Sengoku \(Warring States, late-fifteenth to late-sixteenth century\) and bakumatsu periods \(late Tokugawa years, 1850s and 1860s\) are the most fecund time frames for beget-ting historical novels, perhaps because both were so pregnant with the seeds of the dramatic change to come. Whatever the reasons may be, a number of Japanese novelists have become rich men writing long lists of historical titles. 

For comparison’s sake, it should be noted that the United States—I am eliding discussion here of other parts of the Anglophone world—has also produced several extremely well-published historical novelists who have prospered greatly. To name just two among many, James Michener \(1907–97\) and Herman Wouk \(b. 1915\) have had huge legions of readers. What, then, is the great difference between a Michener or a Wouk and a Shiba Ryōtarō 司馬遼太郎 

\(1923–96\), the topic of this essay? One important difference may be that few serious readers ever confuse Michener with the real thing. They read and continue to read his mammoth novels in part because of the “history” in them, of course, but more for the great romances or compelling stories in which they happen to be wrapped. The same might equally be said of James Clavell’s \(b. 1932\) historical novel Shogun, a novel set almost entirely not in the era of the Tokugawa shoguns but at the end of the Warring States era, the late Sengoku period; this novel sent the American academy running to attack its historicity or to defend its pedagogical utility.1 Herman Wouk’s two-volume historical novel of World War II, The Winds of War and War and Remembrance, is somewhat more pretentious as a work of “history.”2 Fascinating reads that his two hefty volumes are, they may indeed convey a flavor of the times in Europe, the Pacific, and North America, but they contain none of the normal apparatus anyone would expect to find in a work of historical scholarship. In part, this 1  See, for example. Smith 1980, on Clavell 1975.

may be true because, like Shiba but unlike Clavell, Wouk inserts numerous historical personages with their real names into his tale \(the Roosevelts, Stalin, Hitler, and the like\). 

By contrast, I think many people do read Shiba Ryōtarō to learn history, or to fill in the blanks where history is mum, and until his death he played the role of authority on history to the hilt. True, he was not a university professor of history, but he attended conferences as an expert on history \(and/or literature\). 

Observing him, I was reminded of the late E.G. Marshall \(1910–98\), the actor who portrayed the senior defense lawyer on a much-hailed television series of the 1960s, The Defenders, when he was asked to speak to a convention of the American Bar Association. He responded that, appearances notwithstanding, he was not a lawyer. When about twenty years ago, Alan Alda \(b. 1936\), the star of the then hit series M\*A\*S\*H, a television program about a field hospital unit in Korea during the American war there, did speak to the graduating class of Columbia University’s Medical School, he hastened to remind them that as an actor the only things he had in common with doctors was a compelling need to make people feel better and to be well compensated for it. 

In Shiba’s voluminous corpus of mostly multi-volume historical novels, one finds as well a number of non-fiction works about Japanese history and literature. Do we classify such works as history, or perhaps as historical populariza-tions? Is this history à la Stephen Ambrose \(1936–2002\), Doris Kearns Goodwin \(b. 1943\), or one of the many other popularizers who, although they may use footnotes sparingly, at least do not plagiarize overly much? It is difficult to say. 

Shiba and others like him in Japan, even in their fictional works, frequently do cite directly from old historical and literary texts. They may not give chapter and verse but they do provide author and title. And, as long as Michener’s and Wouk’s historical novels may be, they usually pale in comparison to the length of much of Shiba’s and others’ output of historical fiction in Japan. Like Charles Dickens \(1812–70\), Shiba was often paid by the word. His novels were frequently serialized in weekly or monthly popular journals over the course of a year or two and then reissued in book form. This may in part help explain the author’s “logorrhea,” but it only begs the question on the consumer side of the equation. Can one imagine an English-language equivalent, for example, of Yamaoka Sōhachi’s 山岡荘八、\(1907–78\) twenty-six-volume historical novel entitled Tokugawa Ieyasu 徳川家康, which was incidentally translated in full into Chinese?3

Yamaoka has also written numerous other fictionalized historical biographies.

Let me say just a few words about my own route to Shiba Ryōtarō’s work. I met and spoke with him only once, at a conference in the late 1980s, but I first came in contact with his work in 1977 when I was a graduate student in Kyoto. 

As is well known, Japanese Educational Television \(NHK\) runs a weekly one-hour historical drama each year \(roughly 52 episodes\) based on a historical novel, and the novel for 1977 was Shiba’s Kashin \(God of Blooming Flowers\).4 

Like many Japanese that year, I sat spellbound each Sunday evening, staring at my television set, watching the story of Murata Zōroku 村田蔵六 \(later to become known as Ōmura Masujirō 大村益次郎, 1825–69\), the doctor trained in Dutch medicine and later the military modernizer in Chōshū domain who effectively built a modern army in that one domain in western Japan. Shiba added all sorts of flavor to the story, which even someone like myself who was learning about Zōroku for the first time could nonetheless see. 

Zōroku’s domain of Chōshū was, of course, one of the hottest hotbeds of activity on the eve of the Meiji Restoration, and thus a long list of historical players who would become extremely important in the overthrow of the shogunate or the early Meiji government or both walked across the screen each Sunday evening. I was especially taken with another man from Chōshū, new to me at that time twenty-seven years ago, Takasugi Shinsaku 高杉晋作 

\(1839–67\), primarily because Takasugi, incredible hothead that he was, traveled with the first official Japanese delegation to Shanghai in 1862; and all of this was enacted in the television drama. I bought the novel that week and began voraciously to devour it. It was the first real novel I had read in Japanese, but I was younger then and \(more\) irrational. After making my way through the novel’s 1200-plus pages, though, I found that there was no mention in it whatsoever of this trip to Shanghai. As I later discovered, Shiba had an entire other novel in four volumes—entitled Yo ni sumu hibi 世に棲む日々 \(Alive in the world\)5—about the life of Takasugi Shinsaku from which those TV scenes were drawn and grafted onto the story of Kashin. 

Several months later, I wrote Shiba a letter in which I suggested translating the novel Kashin.  He responded through a relative that he basically was not interested, and thankfully the matter ended there. I have been endlessly fascinated by the 1862 Japanese mission to Shanghai ever since, a topic of my present research, and I have Shiba \(and NHK\) to thank for that.

**Japanese Historical Fiction Concerning China**

In addition to Shiba, I have also been particularly interested in the historical fiction of Chin Shunshin 陳舜臣 \(b. 1924\), his slightly younger classmate from Ōsaka University of Foreign Languages and long-time friend, especially the depictions of Chinese historical figures in their writings. Chin is incidentally a second-generation Japanese from Kōbe whose parents moved there from Taiwan and whose ancestors came from Quanzhou in Fujian Province. 

Although Shiba’s work concentrates on Japanese history, he has set novels on the mainland or placed significant scenes from novels there.6 Chin, by contrast, has a Chinese connection in virtually all of his work. His novels are either set in China over the centuries or involve the Chinese community in Japan. 

I have translated two of Chin’s works: a short novel, Pekin yūyūkan  北京 

悠々館 \(rendered in English as Murder in a Peking Studio\), a murder mystery set in Beijing in 1903 on the eve of the Russo-Japanese War; and a much longer one, Taihei tengoku 太平天国 \(The Taiping Rebellion\), about that long and disastrous event in the middle of the nineteenth century.7 The former is, first and foremost, a mystery story that happens to concern Japanese efforts to blackmail high-level Chinese officials and force the earliest possible commencement of a Russo-Japanese War, because the Japanese know that the Russians are continuing to move troops along the Trans-Siberian Railway to the east in preparation for such a war. The only genuinely famous historical Chinese character, Yuan Shikai 袁世凱 \(1859–1916\), who is also the ultimate villain of the piece, makes only brief appearances in the novel. By contrast, Taihei tengoku  is full of historical characters, from Hong Xiuquan 洪秀全 

\(1813–64\) and Yang Xiuqing 楊秀清 \(d. 1856\) to a wide assortment of Manchu and Chinese officials of the Qing government and military. Only the main characters who, as in Herman Wouk’s World War II novels, manage to be at every major or minor historical scene and thus weave the story into a whole, are fictional.8

To my Western sensibilities, Wouk’s two war novels are much more successful as fiction than Chin’s Taiping novel, though, Chin’s may be better “history.” 

Perhaps this tells us something about their audiences. Perhaps Japanese audiences are more drawn, for whatever reasons, to the kind of tale Chin tells than they would be to Wouk’s. At the same time, we should note that at least the first of these Wouk novels, The Winds of War, was translated into Japanese within three years of its initial appearance; a Chinese translation raised quite a fuss when it appeared on the Mainland several years later.9 Wouk’s novels work better probably because the love story works better than the one in Chin’s work. 

I recently completed the translation of another work of Shiba’s entitled Dattan shippūroka  韃靼疾風録 \(Chronicle of the Tartar Tempest, which I may subtitle A Novel of Seventeenth-Century East Asia\),10 a novel set first in Hirado in southern Japan and then in mainland Northeast Asia in the early seventeenth century on the eve of the Manchu conquest of China. The hero of this virtually impossible story, Katsura Shōsuke 桂庄助, comes from a Hirado family. His grandfather who raised him was fluent in the Zhejiang dialect of Chinese because of his contacts with numerous Chinese traders coming to Hirado, and Shōsuke thus grows up bilingual. After an incident involving his grandfather, for which he is not to blame and in which his grandfather dies, Shōsuke is forced to give up certain samurai appurtenances. One day his lord calls him to an audience and informs him that he is to be charged with a long-term mission. To make a long story short, he will have to escort a young and apparently noble young woman—whom no one is initially able to determine the ethnicity of—back to her homeland, the land of Tartary. She is a Jurchen, a Manchu. Through connections in the Chinese underworld with ties in Hirado, they make their way to the mainland via Korea. 

And, of course, they fall in love, but they manage not to consummate it for hundreds of pages. Promised to regain his full warrior status if he does a good job, Shōsuke remains a no-nonsense samurai, following his lord’s orders to the hilt, and he thus cannot very well fall in love with a woman he has been charged to bring home. He must return to Japan after his mission is completed—a mission he later learns involves collecting information to corroborate or refute the rumor of a storm brewing in Tartary that will sweep the Ming dynasty out of power and conquer East Asia—and he certainly cannot very well marry her wrote a single-volume popular account of the Opium War \(Chin 1971b\), which won the 1971 Mainichi Publishers’ Cultural Award.

and bring her back home to Hirado with him. Eventually, however, he gives in to his emotions. 

Of course, things start to go wrong, and he ends up staying in Shenyang, the Manchu capital, for many years, with periodic trips to Mongolia, Suzhou, and elsewhere. He meets Nurhaci, Abahai, Dorgon \(Prince Rui 睿\), and numerous fictional Manchus, as well as many Chinese, Koreans, Mongols, and even a half-Cantonese, half-Portuguese man from Macao. As one frequently finds in this genre, there are recurrent digressions into the history of China, Manchuria, Mongolia, Korea, and elsewhere as background for a given scene. 

As interesting as these often are, one cannot help but feel that these deviations from the storyline are there, at least in part, to fill that week’s or month’s magazine installment. 

Ultimately, Shōsuke decides he must return to Japan, but unfortunately the new Tokugawa government has in his absence decided to impose the sakoku \(“locking of the country”\) law, which forbids Japanese, on pain of death, from leaving their country. If he returns now, he stands a chance either of being humiliated for doing precisely the opposite of what his lord has ordered him to do—escort the Tartar princess back to her home—or, worse still, being executed. What’s he to do? The impossibility of the story makes the fascinating \(though entirely improbable\) manner in which Shiba lets it unfold 

“seem” possible. 

**Translation Problems**

As good a researcher as Shiba was—in this regard, Clavell, Wouk, and Michener really pale by comparison with him—he was often prone to precisely the kind of generalizations that historians and literary scholars tend to avoid at all cost. 

Shiba, though, was attracted to such big, popularizing themes like a moth to a flame. Among his many books are such titles as Ningen ni tsuite  人間について 

\(About Human Beings\) and Nihonjin to Nihon bunka  日本人と日本文化 

\(Japanese and Japanese Culture\), both the transcripts of extended “face-to-face conversations” \( taidan  対談\) with interlocutors.11 He also collaborated with Chin Shunshin on a similar work entitled Chūgoku  o  kangaeru, taidan 中国を考える、対談 \(Thinking about China, a Conversation\),12 and several others on Korea and Japan.

useful or meaningful—Tu Weiming 杜維明 \(b. 1940\) in our field might be an exception, the late Joseph Campbell \(1904–87\) in another. 

This penchant for the general or more popular explanation forces the con-scientious translator of his fiction into something of a corner. Do we just render his words as they are without explanation? Do we add a translator’s note to the effect that there are many exceptions to the generality just enunciated, or such-and-such a view is not or no longer generally held by specialist scholars? 

The first option of just conveying the words as accurately as possible may work for professional translators, but for scholars who pour their lifeblood into the very questions he and others like him toss off over a few beers, this is unac-ceptable. Translator’s notes in a work of fiction, though, only work if they are few and far between. Otherwise the translated text will no longer be a readable novel but will read more like an essay by Paul Pelliot \(1878–1945\). 

How do we deal with views no longer widely held in academia? This is one issue I have had to face in the Shiba translation. The image he conveys of the Tokugawa shogunate “locking itself up” in the early seventeenth century no longer jibes with much recent scholarship, even in Japan. While Shiba was more understanding of the complexity of the whole sakoku issue, his portrayal of this institution was still out of date from a scholarly perspective, even in the mid-1980s when the book first appeared. I have no answer to this question, but simply raise it here for consideration. 

What about specific errors of fact, as opposed to differences of interpretation from the scholarly consensus? For instance, there is a passage in Dattan shippūroku which Shiba describes the execution by haritsuke  はりつけ, a form of crucifixion and exposure, of the notorious eunuch Wei Zhongxian 魏忠賢 \(1568–1627\). The problem is that we know that Wei committed suicide by hanging after which his corpse was crucified. Should the translator add a note about the specific cause of Wei’s death or even simply add it to the text? 

This may seem like a small point, but it is a slippery slope from this sort of tin-kering to more insidious forms of playing with an original text, such as Arthur Waley’s \(1899–1966\) adding of florid language—and apparently a character in one chapter—to his translation of the Tale of Genji.  13

There is also a relatively small issue related to this, which causes less despair as a translator but some worry nonetheless. That is the issue of Shiba’s getting dates and other numbers wrong. In the roughly 1100 pages of text, this problem has come up about fifteen times. Usually, it involves a well-known person’s age off by a year or maybe two. Occasionally, the dates of events or other numbers are similarly at odds with every available reference work. I have finessed 13  Waley 1935.

217

any problem or infidelity to the text by simply correcting Shiba’s errors and converting all ages to Western reckoning of them, which scholars working on premodern texts do all the time. The errors themselves are less disturbing that what they may portend—namely, sloppiness on the part of the author who wrote so rapidly and voluminously. I stress may because Shiba has many times more dates and figures that do accord with the historical record. 

Yet another issue derives from a rather pretentious inclination on Shiba’s part to flaunt his supposed knowledge of the Manchu and Mongol languages, his college major. In countless instances, he has his Manchu characters speak using Manchu words or phrases, or he himself employs Manchu terms while describing Manchu history or culture, of course in katakana  renderings. The problem is that many of these are simply incorrect. Some are slightly off and easily corrected. Others are way off, but ultimately recognizable to those knowledgeable of Manchu. Probably a third of them are completely unrecognizable. Were Shiba still alive, I could contact him and ask what he meant, but that avenue was shut off some eight years ago. 

Interestingly, this is something Herman Wouk does frequently in his two massive World War II novels with Russian, German, Yiddish, Hebrew, and other languages. It adds authenticity to a historical novel, having the characters occasionally “speak” in their native tongue, and makes it seem as though the author knows that about which he speaks. It is frankly not a lot different from the footnote to a foreign-language source in a scholarly work. The difference between Herman Wouk and Shiba Ryōtarō in this context, though, is that I have never found Wouk to have made a single language mistake, and I have made a point of looking up every foreign word I did not already know that appears in his many historical novels. 

How is a translator to finesse this problem? When I have been able, through consultation with colleagues who specialize in Manchu and Mongol to ascer-tain the correct form of a Manchu or Mongol term, I have rendered them according to the modern romanization schemes. When I cannot figure them out, I simply skip the romanized term. Shiba always gives the alleged meaning of these Manchu or Mongol terms, because of course he does not expect his Japanese readers to know them. I have simply jumped directly into English when the katakana expression makes no sense and elided any linguistic complexity in those difficult cases. 

However, one potentially serious problem still remains. That is the names of his Manchu characters which he occasionally feels he must translate to be meaningful, and these of course cannot be elided. Some of the names do not mean what he says they do, and others are completely inauthentic as Manchu names. I shall spare readers here the details, but suffice it to say: what do you 

218

On Translating Shiba Ryōtarō Into English

do when a specific character is called X in Manchu, because he or she is meant or hoped to embody that quality, but X does not, in fact, translate as that quality? Again, I have no solution to this problem but simply want to raise it. 

There is one point in the text at which three Mongol generals submit their allegiance with all attendant pomp to the Great Khan of the Jurchen people \(the Manchus\). Their Mongolian names are given a number of times in katakana.  Suspecting that they were based on historical personages but having not a clue as to how their names might be romanized, I contacted several Mongolists in the United States and Japan—Christopher Atwood of Indiana University, Harayama Akira 原山煌 of Momoyama Gakuin University, and Nakami Tatsuo 中見立夫 of Tokyo University of Foreign Studies. None of these specialists could figure out the names, which simply did not ring any bells for them, although Mongolian names are not strange to them in the least. 

This issue led Professor Nakami in an e-mail message to go on at length about a more telling issue which concerns the fault lines within the entire genre of historical fiction. He was explaining why he so disliked Shiba Ryōtarō’s work, first and foremost because he wrote fiction for a mass audience. Unlike Inoue Yasushi 井上靖 \(1907–91\) who relied on top-flight scholars to advise him on several of his many historical novels—for example, for Tonkō 敦煌 \(Dunhuang\), a novel about the period in the Tang when that cave site was sealed with countless manuscripts inside, he consulted with Fujieda Akira 藤枝晃 \(1911–98\); for Fūtō  風涛 \(Wind and waves\), a novel about Korea under the Mongol yoke, he consulted with Okada Hidehiro 岡田英弘 \(b. 1931\); and for Tenpyō no iraka  天平の甍 \(The Roof Tile of Tenpyō\), a novel about several young Japanese who travel to China in the early eighth century with one of the periodic embassies from Japan to pursue Buddhist studies and from which several members work to convince the great monk Ganjin 鑑真 

\(C. Jianzhen, 688–763\) to come to Japan, he consulted with Andō Kōsei 安藤更生 \(1900–70\)14—Shiba either did all the work himself or relied on 14   Tonkō \(Inoue 1981\), with translations into English by Jean Oda Moy, Tun-huang: A Novel \(Tokyo, New York: Kodansha International, 1978\), into German by Siegfried Schaarschmidt, Die Höhlen von Dun-Huang: Roman \(Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp, 1986\), intro French by Jean Guiloineau, Les chemins du désert \(Paris: Stock, 1982\), and at least three times into Chinese by the Pomegranate Red Writing Group 石榴紅文字工作坊, Dunhuang 敦煌 \(Taibei: Huatian wenhua gonsi, 1995\), by Dong Xuechang 董学昌, Dunhuang 敦煌

lesser lights. The distinction, in Nakami’s view and undoubtedly in many educated Japanese readers’ views as well, is between Inoue Yasushi as bungō 

文豪 \(literary giant\) and Shiba Ryōtarō as taishū sakka  大衆作家 \(mass market writer\).15

On one final concern on which I chink Shiba does relatively well: his novel takes place in the early seventeenth century, a time when the modern entities of “Japan,” “China,” and “Korea” were not at all well formulated in political, nation-state terms among ordinary people. That has not stopped other historical dramatists from assuming that a twentieth-century perspective on the nation-state has always and forever existed throughout East Asia. Shiba’s main character in Dattan shippūroku is decidedly a man of Hirado rather than a generic “Japanese.” This fact is extremely important to the unfolding of the story, for it is because of his origins in Hirado that he has had contacts with Chinese merchants \(and, as it develops, figures from the Chinese underworld\) his entire life, and knows the spoken Chinese language of the Zhejiang region; and it is because he has traveled nowhere else in the home islands of Japan that he is familiar with little else in Japan from first-hand experience. Shiba makes this very point several times, and it is a salient and salutary one. Similarly, there is a Korean character midway through the first volume who behaves in a manner more Confucian than the contemporaneous Ming Chinese government to which he nonetheless feels an almost subliminal bond of fidelity, even while zuojia xiehui 广东省作家协会\(Guangdong Provincial Writers’ Association\) \(Guangzhou: Huacheng chubanshe, 1993\); and Tenpyō no iraka \(Inoue 1957\) with translations into English by James T. Araki, The roof tile of Tempyō \(Tokyo: University of Tokyo Press, 1975\), into French by René Sieffert, La tuile de Tenpyō: roman \(Paris: Publications orientalistes de France, 1985\), into German by Oscar Benl \(Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp, 1981\), and in Chinese three times by Lou Shiyi 楼适夷, Tianping zhi meng  天平之甍 \(Beijing: Zuojia chubanshe, 1963; reprinted Beijing: Renmin chubanshe, 1980\), Chen Dewen 陈德文, Tianping zhi meng, lishiju  天平之甍：历史剧 \(Roof tile of Tenpyō, a historical drama\) \(Nanjing: Jiangsu renmin chubanshe, 1978\), and by the Pomegranate Red Writing Group, Tianping zhi meng \(Taibei: Jiuda wenhua, Wanxiang tushu, 1992\). These translations were readily available from NACSIS-Webcat; there are undoubtedly many others as well. 

Inoue was a prolific author in his day; among his other historical fiction set in China are Kōzui  洪水 \(The Flood\) \(Shinchōsha, 1962\), translated into English by John Bester as Flood, in Modern Japanese Authors, vol. 4 \(Hara Publishing Co., 1964\), and Kōshi  孔子

he despises individual members of it. I admire also Shiba’s telling of how the Manchu leadership slowly comes to see itself as a distinct “ethnic group”—not his term and perhaps inappropriate—and ultimately to create its own dynastic structure and finally to contemplate attacking and conquering the Ming. The very fact that throughout the novel he refers to the “Ming” or “Great Ming” 

rather that to “China” is an indication of his sensitivity to this important issue. 

**Conclusion: The Bohr Atom**

I think we can all accept the fact that there are not neatly separable realms of history, fiction, and myth, each with comfortable barriers and distinct constituencies. Each of these realms influences the others and washes over into the others’ terrain. By the same token, this does not mean that history and literature are really the same, the only significant difference being the truth claims of the writer, a view that has commanded some support of late in the academy. If we can dispense with the idea of history as a science, even a soft science, what are we left with once we accept the fact that literature—even myth—influences our understanding of the past? Do we then throw up our hands and give in, somewhat nihilistically, to the impossibility of ever saying anything of meaning? Clearly not. Samuel Richardson \(1689–1761\), the father of the Anglophone novel, noted several centuries ago that he wanted to make his epistolary novel Clarissa seem real, not because he wanted people to think that the letters in it were the genuine article but “to avoid hurting that kind of Historical Faith, which Fiction itself is genuinely read with, tho’ we know it to be Fiction.”16 As writers we create “history” as we create “fiction.” History does not simply exist waiting for us to discover it, nor does it fall from the sky—that, I would argue, is the terrain occupied by myth. 

For most of us, the history that we write will be read by precious few and is unlikely to influence even a majority of those in the academy. We live in a strange world—looking down our noses at people who pander to the masses and sighing at how ignorant of history every new college class appears to be. 

When government bureaucrats bemoan the widespread basic historical ignorance of the young, they usually mean ignorance of a whitewashed, decidedly didactic version of our own history. For most people, though, history only lives in television dramas and, if we are really lucky, historical novels. I must confess that when I think or nineteenth century America, I still conjure up images of the westerns of my youth: Hugh O’Brian \(b. 1925\) in my mind will always 16  Cited in Bowersock 1994, pp. 50–51. 

On Translating Shiba Ryōtarō Into English

221

be Wyatt Earp \(1848–1929\), Kevin Costner’s \(b. 1955\) attempts to the contrary notwithstanding. 

Do we, as academics, do much of a service by devoting our time to debunking historical novels and movies? Just in recent years, Oliver Stone’s JFK became a feeding frenzy for American historians, and Steven Spielberg’s Amistad and Schindler’s List were not too far behind. The fear, justifiable as it is, is that most young Americans, and many not so young, get their history from populariza-tions, movies, and fiction. So, just to play devil’s advocate, what is the difference if young people all think there was an elaborate conspiracy behind the assassination of John F. Kennedy? The answer has to be: It’s just not true. But, so what? Hugh O’Brian was not Wyatt Earp either, a fact I know and think largely irrelevant. Is it a slippery slope from there to fiction or pseudofactual stories about events much more important in our times, such as those concocted by Holocaust deniers anywhere or Nanjing Massacre deniers in Japan? 

The French classicist Pierre Vidal-Naquet \(b. 1930\) has described how he feels he must take precious years away from his own research time to disproving what strikes most of us as the patent nonsense of the Holocaust deniers, principally in Europe, because the frauds they perpetrate demand exposure.17

I would like to call this the Bohr atom phenomenon for the following reasons. We all tend to think of the structure of the atom as a nucleus of protons and neutrons with a bunch of electrons whizzing around at extremely rapid speeds. This model of the atom was devised by the great Danish physicist, Niels Bohr \(1885–1962\), who even at the time he received the Nobel Prize in 1922 realized that his model was at best insufficient and demonstrably incorrect. And, yet, to this day we and, I dare say, many scientists still tend to think of the atom in the manner that Bohr pictured it. Most of us cannot possibly understand how an atom should properly be pictured—with the mixture of equations, energy, and matter—and it does little damage in our daily lives to think—to the extent that we do at all—of an atom with protons, neutrons, and electrons in their proper places. 

Does it matter then, as one of my students at Harvard put it some years ago, whether Mao wore red sneakers or black ones? Or, to bring this discussion back to the topic at hand, do the kinds of literary license taken by historical novelists like Shiba Ryōtarō really do irreparable harm? Are we not then just like that tiny coterie of quantum mechanics specialists who actually understand how an atom should be construed? I have no hard answers, but these are some of thoughts and doubts. And, to bring the story even closer to home, if we have qualms about certain historical fiction for possibly twisting history for 17  See Vidal-Naquet 1992.

dramatic effect, should we translate it, thereby expanding the potential readership for good or ill? By doing so, are we, to be a bit melodramatic, sleeping with the enemy? I should add that the project of which the volume I am translating is part was initiated between Donald Keene and the Japan Foundation, because both felt that the Japanese novels that have been translated to date do not, on the whole, reflect Japanese readers’ literary tastes. I should add that Keene and Shiba were close friends, but I doubt that had anything to do with it. 

In the midst of my work on this translation and on Shiba himself, I found in a long online interview with Donald Keene some interesting comments made in the context of the appearance of another Shiba novel that had then just come out as part of this same series. The author of the essay is explaining the reasons for Shiba’s popularity and why he wrote so much about certain periods in history. 

Individual opportunity is maximized not during periods of superficial stability, but rather in turbulent eras like the Sengoku period or the transitional phase between the Tokugawa shogunate and the Meiji Restoration. In many of Shiba’s works, people who lived in such tumultuous times are depicted in vivid and dynamic detail. 

In fact, it is this vividness that explains the popularity of Shiba’s historical fiction. Once touched by Shiba’s pen, people who actually existed centuries ago are brought to brilliant life in the reader’s mind. 

“I knew what Yamanouchi Yōdō did, what he was against, and the opinions he voiced,” says Keene, “but no documents tell us what kind of person he was. 

When I read Shiba’s story, however, I gained insight into the motivation behind Yōdō’s actions. That’s something you don’t get from history books.”18

What then should we aim for when translating historical fiction? Do we attempt to recreate the world of the novel in language redolent of past times and different places? Shiba, for example, uses contemporary grammatical forms for all conversations involving one or more non-Japanese, but he frequently adds local dialect when there are only Japanese conversing. What he does not use is contemporary slang, for obvious reasons, I would assume. However, that opposite approach can work, if extremely skillfully applied. Pat Hanan’s translations of late Ming and late Qing novels brilliantly convey a time and place different from our own in an English that sounds very down-under to my ears.19 I have opted for a style that eschews contemporary colloquialisms and, of course, 18  See: www.lookjapan.com/LBsc/02FebCF.htm.

anachronisms—namely, anything that sounds as if it was informed by events after the early seventeenth century, especially specific knowledge or expressions or metaphors based on such knowledge formed after the Qing dynasty came into being—but I have also gone for a style that may sound somewhat stilted to many ears. 

This essay ultimately raises far more questions than it can possibly answer. 

The issues involved in translating fiction, historical or otherwise, are many, and they are likely never to be resolved to anyone’s particular delight. By the same token, however, they deserve our continued attention and investigation.
