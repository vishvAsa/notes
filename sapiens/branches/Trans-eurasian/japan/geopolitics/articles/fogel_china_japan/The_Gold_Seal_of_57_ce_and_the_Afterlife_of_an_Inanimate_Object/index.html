  <p>This essay operates on the assumption that objects can inspire thought, and thought can generate debate, and the consequences of that debate can be of ontological importance. Thus, the inanimate object plays no “conscious” role in engendering ideas, but humans invest in it a range of meanings which can reach levels of great cultural and historical significance. The object in question is a golden seal, presently on display in the Fukuoka City Museum in Japan.</p>
<p>According to the official <em>Hou Han shu (History of the Later Han dynasty)</em>, in the year 57 ce an emissary from the statelet of Nu in the kingdom of Wo (“Wa”</p>
<p>in Japanese, somewhere in what is now “Japan”) arrived at the court of the Guangwu Emperor of the Later Han. The emissary was seeking investiture, as had other foreign states, within the Later Han’s ritual system for his homeland in the Wa federation, and the court awarded him with a seal and a ribbon. This one-line entry in the massive *Hou Han shu * would doubtless have remained just one among many unprovable items from the Chinese dynastic histories had not something utterly extraordinary occurred over 1,700 years later. In 1784</p>
<p>a rice farmer in Fukuoka domain (Kyushu) was repairing an irrigation ditch in his rice paddy when he happened upon something shiny lodged between some rocks. He pulled it out, washed it off, and found that he had discovered some sort of inscribed seal. Unaware of just what it was or what value it might possess, by various hypothesized routes it was brought to the local magistrate who showed it to a local scholar, Kamei Nanmei (1743–1814), a famous Confucian teacher in his day. Nanmei looked at its inscriptional face (see below—its meaning remains debated till this day), and he knew immediately that this was the very seal mentioned in the *Hou Han shu. *</p>
<p>Before more than a small handful of people knew of its existence, Kamei Nanmei penned a lengthy essay explaining the meaning and defending the authenticity of the seal—an utterly brilliant piece of writing—and in so doing launched a debate that continues unabated till today, over two centuries later.</p>
<p>Every aspect of this small piece of gold, roughly one inch to a side, with a small handle in the shape of serpent or snake has been debated over the years—who received it, the meaning of the inscription, what the snake-shaped handle signifies, the significance of its gold composition as opposed to some other metal,</p>

<p>how it might have ended up where it did, and its overall importance (or irrelevance) in Sino-Japanese relations—altogether over 350 books and articles. In what follows I would like to outline the contours of that debate as a series of four historiographic waves, looking at how it has changed and, more importantly, why. It offers in microcosm a look at the changing nature of Japanese commentary on the relationship of Japan with Mainland culture.</p>
<p>Whatever may have been the interactions between the proto-Chinese and the proto-Japanese in the centuries before the launching of diplomatic interactions, we now generally accept the fact that the year 57 ce marks the first state-to-state meeting of the two (though it was certainly an unequal one). This fact is attested in the <em>Hou Han shu</em>, * * and even those who may have serious doubts about the gold seal do not as a rule question the testimony of the Chinese historical record. For example, writing shortly after the conclusion of World War II, the famed scholar Tsuda Sōkichi (1873–1961) was hesitant about claiming this meeting as the “first time the king of Na [“Nu” on the seal’s inscription]</p>
<p>had paid tribute” to the Han court, but the weight of subsequent scholarship confirms that is surely was.1 The gold seal given by the Later Han emperor to the emissary from the “Japanese” archipelago stands as the first material object of significance exchanged between the two lands, and the fact that it remains extant (despite seventeen centuries of being hidden in the ground) should not be underestimated.</p>
<p>1  See Tsuda Sōkichi, <em>Nihon koten no kenkyū (Studies in the Japanese classics)</em>, * * in <em>Tsuda Sōkichi</em> *zenshū (Collected works of Tsuda Sōkichi) *(Tokyo: Iwanami shoten, 1963), 1:18; Itō Terufumi,</p>

<p>It also effectively marks Wa’s entrance into the world of “international” affairs, a world defined by the Han empire. The five-character inscription on the seal also marks the first instance in which written Chinese characters functioned in and of themselves in the archipelago. Objects with Chinese graphs on them were certainly imported to the archipelago earlier, but they were little more than impenetrable symbols or decorations with no intrinsic significance to the visitors. Kume Masao (b. 1948) has thus asserted that this exchange denotes</p>
<p>“Japan’s” first awareness of the universe of Chinese characters and hence its entrance into that world, where it remains, <em>mutatis mutandis</em>, to this day, a point strongly emphasized by the great Chinese Japanologist, Wang Xiangrong (1920–2006).2 But, long before Kume’s recent work, Kamei Nanmei noted in his defense of the seal’s authenticity: “The five characters of this seal mark the first time writing from a foreign country was transmitted to our land.” The seal’s discovery in 1784 was, according to him, a “good omen *[shōzui] * for civilization”</p>
<p>itself, as it marked the real start of such in his homeland by virtue of the Midas-like touch of continental culture.</p>
<p>Nanmei clearly understood the extraordinary significance of this find.</p>
<p>Equally important to confirmation of the story in the <em>Hou Han shu</em> was the fact that the seal’s actual discovery had taken place in his own domain in Fukuoka, 2  Kume Masao, “Kin’in Nakoku setsu e no hanron” (“Response to the thesis of the gold seal</p>
<p>[having been presented] to the state of Na”), in <em>Ko bunka ronsō: Fujisawa Kazuo sensei</em> <em>koki kinen (Essays on ancient culture in commemoration of the sixtieth birthday of Professor</em> <em>Fujisawa Kazuo)</em> (Osaka: Fujisawa Kazuo sensei koki kinen ronshū kankōkai, 1983), 112–13; Wang Xiangrong, *Xiemataiguo (The state of Yamatai) *(Beijing: Zhongguo shehui kexue chubanshe, 1982), 231–32.</p>

<p>thus marking an event of great auspiciousness as he was just then about to open the doors of one of his domain’s Confucian academies. Here was that early icon of Sino-Japanese ties unearthed just as his own academy was taking off. Nanmei was more than a devout Confucian. One might even think of him as a kind of Confucian fundamentalist. He believed that one could find most answers to questions of a philosophical or moral nature without looking further than the <em>Lunyu (Analects [of Confucius])</em>, * * the central text of the ancient Chinese philosopher. He was also a medical doctor and thus a man of science.</p>
<p>He argued in his other philosophical writings that knowledge and practice had to inform one another or neither would be of much use.3</p>
<p>Roughly three weeks after first being shown and allowed to analyze the gold seal in the spring of 1784, Nanmei wrote his famous piece about it, entitled 3  Yoshida Yōichi, “Kamei Nanmei no igaku shisō” Kamei Nanmei’s medical thought**), ** <em>Yōgaku</em> 8 (1999): 1–21; “Kameigaku koborebanashi” (“Tidbits of the Kamei school”), <em>Kishi Noko</em> <em>hakubutsukan dayori</em> 31 (1997): 7–9; Shōno Hisato, “Kokuhō ‘kin’in’ shutsudo ni tsuite” (“On the unearthing of the national treasure, the ‘gold seal’”), <em>Kishi Noko hakubutsukan dayori</em> 30</p>

<p>The Gold Seal Of 57 CE</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>*Kin’in no ben (On the gold seal). * 4 This piece was preceded by an authentication that the local magistrate asked him to make of the seal in which he merely gave its dimensions and shape and included a drawing. Unlike the seal itself, this drawing and copies of it circulated among Japanese intellectuals who far more often than not made their own (often strident) comments on it based solely on his drawing. The longer essay, written in a traditional style known as <em>mondō</em></p>
<p>(“question and answer”), is primarily a series of hypothetical questions that might be (and later definitely were) raised about the genuineness of the gold seal. One by one Nanmei poses these points of doubt in as strong a way as he can, and one by one he demolishes them. For example: Is it possible that gold could remain underground surrounded by malicious rocks for nearly two millennia and come up without a scratch? Yes, Nanmei replies to his own straw-man question, and he proceeds to marshal scientific data to demonstrate that gold can hold out extremely well even for many centuries. Another example: Doesn’t the middle character of the inscription, *nu, * with its meaning of “slave”</p>
<p>or “servant” or simply “underling,” imply a decidedly negative evaluation of the statelet receiving it and hence of early Japan? Indeed, Nanmei replies, one finds the character in such tribal names as Xiongnu where a deprecatory implication may be read, but that would not have applied here, and he heads into a lengthy exegesis of what this graph would have meant at the time: It being a time in which we did not have writing [in Japan], when our emissary to the Han dynasty [in 57 ce] was asked there what the name of our country was, he would have responded orally ‘Yamato no kuni’ [the land of Yamato]. They attached the character 倭 to our national name.</p>
<p>Through the end of Han dynasty, they added the character 奴 to convey</p>
<p>‘Yamato no kuni’ with 倭奴國. In the Chinese language, [the character] 奴 is pronounced *no *[actually <em>nu</em>, but occasionally used to render Japanese <em>no</em>—JAF].</p>
<p>In [such Ming-period texts as] <em>Wubei zhi [Treatise on military preparedness] * and <em>Riben kao [Study of Japan]</em>, * * Mino [a Japanese place name] is transcribed with the Chinese characters 米奴</em>* **and Kii 紀伊 [another] is rendered 乞奴苦藝 [‘Ki kuni’]. In the [Ming-period work] *Yinyun zihai *</p>
<p><em>[Dictionary of sounds and rhymes]</em>, words from our land are translated, such as *ushitsuno *(ox horn) rendered as 吾失祖奴 and <em>tsuru no kubi</em> (crane’s neck) as 它立奴谷只. Given these [examples], the term Xiongnu 4  Reprinted a number of times; see <em>Kamei Nanmei Shōyō zenshū</em> ( <em>Collected writings of Kamei</em> <em>Nanmei and [Kamei] Shōyō</em>) (Fukuoka: Ashi shobō, 1978), 1:360–68.</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>The Gold Seal of 57 CE</p>
<p>represents a euphonic change from Xianyun [an early Chinese name for the Xiongnu]. These graphs [including 奴] are there for their pronunciation, not for their meaning. . . . There is [thus] no derogatory meaning to the character 奴 in the various writings of that land [i.e., China]. In our understanding of the character usage of that land, this should be something quite easy for us to comprehend.5</p>
<p>On the whole Nanmei’s defense is based on a recipe drawn from a range of disciplines: a little science, a little philology, and a lot of Confucianism. In the immediate years following the gold seal’s discovery and Nanmei’s essay, numerous pieces of varying length would be written by many of Japan’s leading intellectuals of the late eighteenth century. In fact, so many people over a wide geographic area contributed essays that one has frequently to remind oneself that this was an age not only prior to modern communications, of course, but one in which even inter-domainal communications and transportation were anything but smooth and travel was sharply monitored or curtailed.6 Somehow ideas transcended those barriers, even as it was people who necessarily carried the information.</p>
<p>The debate that followed Nanmei’s seminal essay took up many of the issues he raised. Many were based only on news of the discovery or just Nanmei’s authentication. In other instances, his longer essay was copied and circulated.</p>
<p>The contours of the debate, though, soon came down, on the one hand, to Confucians who understood Japan’s cultural heritage as intricately linked to that of the mainland and recognized that anything in which Japan might excel culturally found its roots in China (possibly via Korea). For this group, as for Kamei Nanmei, their progenitor, the seal was a testament to the antiquity of Japan’s ties to the Mainland. Their defenses of it tended to invoke the Confucian classics as the fount of truth and were less sanguine about native Japanese sources. Opponents of this group were, on the whole, men based in the nativist *(kokugaku) * tradition for whom the Confucian classics were an alien body of literature with little importance in Japan. These men tended to marshal evidence from the ancient Japanese classics, such as the <em>Kojiki (Record</em> 5  *“Kan no Wa no Na no kokuō” kin ’inten, kin ’in hakken nihyaku nen (Exhibit of the goal seal *</p>
<p><em>[inscribed] to the “King of Na of Wa under the Han”: Two hundred years since the discovery the</em> <em>gold seal)</em> (Fukuoka: Fukuoka shiritsu rekishi shiryōkan, 1984), 74–75.</p>

<p>*of ancient matters) * and the *Nihon shoki (Chronicles of Japan). * They went out of their way either to downplay the importance of the unearthing of the gold seal or to cast anything from mild to serious aspersions on the small statelet whose emissary had received it from the court of the Later Han dynasty. Interestingly, though, it would be another five decades before anyone—significantly, a nativist scholar—would actually claim that the gold seal was a complete fake. That was to be Matsuura Michisuke (1801–66), a disciple of the notorious nativist scholar Hirata Atsutane (1776–1843), writing in 1836.7 Matsuura’s essay would likely have remained entirely obscure if not for its republication by Miyake Yonekichi (1860–1929) at the end of the nineteenth century. As we shall soon see, Miyake completely disagreed with Matsuura’s thesis, but he thought it deserved the light of day.</p>
<p>Although Japanese Confucians did not completely ignore the Japanese classics any more than nativist Japanese completely ignored the Confucian classics, each group worked overtime to emphasize the importance of its own set of books as the source of truth. Thus, at one significant level, the debate took on almost a religious quality making it all but impossible for either side to convince the other of anything. The starkest contrast in the two main opposing sides was how each viewed the gold seal in connection with their own identity, or more broadly how each side saw its identity in relation to China and Chinese culture. The debate did have the positive effect (for later scholars) of bringing to the surface numerous topics in the more general Confucian-nativist debate which were otherwise submerged, and virtually all the traditional sources extant were brought to the fore, even if modern scholars may now approach them differently. And, as noted, much of the debate rehearsed points made in question-answer fashion by Kamei Nanmei.</p>
<p>Roughly one hundred years later by the middle of the Meiji era, with Confucianism on the wane and Central European academic benchmarks all the rage in scholarly circles in Japan, the well known historian Miyake Yonekichi brought the latest standards of philology and historical phonology to bear on a study of the gold seal, penning an essay which has set the standard ever since in the area of a proper reading of the seal’s five-character 7  Yamada Yoshio. <em>Hirata Atsutane</em> (Tokyo: Hōbunkan, 1940), 161. See Matsuura Michisuk, “Kan no Wa no Na no kokuō kin’in gisaku ben” (“On the forged gold seal [inscribed] to the king of Na in Wa under the Han”) rpt. in Miyake Yonekichi, “Wa no Na no kokuō kin’in gisaku setsu no hihyō” (“A critique of the theory that the gold seal [inscribed] to the king of the state of Na in Wa is a forgery”), <em>Kōkogakukai zasshi</em> 2.5 (1898), 10–13; and in *“Kan no Wa no Na no kokuō” *</p>

<p>inscription.8 There have been dissenting voices since his essay appeared, but they have been largely relegated to the sidelines as the minority opposition or as curiosities—a fact all the more fascinating when viewed in the light of the numerous essays before his that closely debated the reading of the seal’s inscription. Once Miyake’s extraordinary essay appeared, that discussion—on the reading and meaning of the inscription—was, as it were, over, even if some disagreed with it and, more recently, the debate has been somewhat revived.</p>
<p>Philology as the discipline of choice ruled the day from mid-Meiji Japan, and with its universalist claims that the surest way of searching for and reaching the origins of historical problems was by means of language, it had the power to shift paradigms.</p>
<p>The central claim of Miyake’s essay was that the inscription on the face of the gold seal should be read (in Japanese) as “Kan no Wa no Na no kokuō,”</p>
<p>meaning that this seal was presented to “the sovereign [or king] of the state of Na in Wa under the [aegis of the] Han” empire. The implication that this Japanese state of Na or the larger confederation of Wa were subservient in some way to the Later Han dynasty, anathema to nativists earlier, was no longer a serious issue, as it had been until that time. Miyake was also solving two other problems with this reading. First, the second character of the inscription 委, he claimed, echoing Kamei Nanmei himself, was merely a short form for Wa 倭, and thus not the first of a two-character approximation (倭奴) in Chinese for some other ancient Japanese state. Many had read those two graphs as “Ito” or “Ido”. Second, that troubling middle character 奴 was not, in his view, a Chinese stand-in for the genitive particle <em>no</em>, * * as even Nanmei had believed; nor, of course, did he think it bore any patronizing or derogatory view of Japan on the part of China. Instead, historical phonology deemed that it was to be read *na, * and it represented the Chinese approximation for the small state that had sent the emissary to the court of the Later Han.</p>
<p>As Miyake makes clear, however—and this provides another indication that the Confucian-nativist debate was a thing of the past—before the discovery was made, two scholars (one usually associated with Confucianism and the other a major figure in the nativist school) had already identified this troubling graph with the proper site in Kyushu at which the seal was later discovered. Writing in 1716, the celebrated historian Arai Hakuseki (1657–1725) identified the state of Na (as indicated in the *Wei zhi [Chronicle of the kingdom of Wei]) * as Naka-no-kōri in Chikuzen domain, Fukuoka. In his *Koshi tsū *</p>
<p>8  Miyake Yonekichi, “Kan no Wa no Na no kokuō in kō” (“A study of the seal [inscribed] to the King of the state of Na in Wa under the Han dynasty”), <em>Shigaku zasshi</em> 3.37 (1892): 874–81.</p>
<p>The Gold Seal Of 57 CE</p>
<p>55</p>
<p><em>wakumon (Questions concerning an understanding of ancient history)</em>, Hakuseki was not directly discussing the seal itself, of course, but the state referred to in the <em>Wei zhi</em> as “Nuguo” in Chinese, which he noted “was Naka-no-kōr<strong>i</strong> in Chikuzen domain” in his own time. In the absence of the seal itself, not discovered until six decades after his death, this association accrued no followers and as such was not built upon in subsequent years.9</p>
<p>Sixty years later, the famed scholar Motoori Norinaga (1730–1801), writing in 1777, only a few years before the seal’s discovery, associated the same character with two different toponyms in the same region of Kyushu, and he assigned</p>
<p>“Na” to both of them as the correct reading. Arguably the greatest of the nativist scholars, Norinaga would later (after the seal was unearthed and became a topic of debate) go to pains to note that mention of this state of Na in the <em>Wei</em> <em>zhi</em> bore no relation at all to the state named in the middle three characters on the gold seal’s inscriptional face. This middle character, which he claimed was to be read <em>to</em> (and hence all three as “Ito no kuni”) and <em>nu</em> in the context of the three-character expression in the <em>Hou Han shu</em>, * * had now acquired a third reading *(na). * In this last incarnation, Norinaga associated it with the local place names, Na-no-agata and Nanotsu, in the Kyushu region. Although he struck gold with this assertion, it seems to have gotten lost in the mix of opinions flying fast and loose at the time and would not be revived until the essay by Miyake Yonekichi at the end of the following century.10 Thus, despite some apparent confusion, Norinaga made an extremely important point which emerged from his undeniable talents as a philologist. Like Arai Hakuseki before him, he associated the middle character of the seal’s inscription (奴) (though not specifically in this instance of the seal itself, which had yet to be unearthed, but as it appears in the <em>Wei zhi</em> where it should be, he claimed, pronounced *na) * with the character 儺 (also pronounced <em>na</em> and appearing as an ancient toponym from the very region in which the seal was discovered) and additionally with the character 那 (again, pronounced <em>na</em> and also linked with local place names).11</p>

<p>56</p>
<p>The Gold Seal of 57 CE</p>
<p>Instead of sustaining this argument and anticipating Miyake Yonekichi’s paradigm-shifting essay of 1892, Norinaga jumped to the conclusions that the expression 倭奴國 from the <em>Hou Han shu</em> should be read “Wanukoku” (in Japanese) and that this state had nothing whatsoever to do with the kingdom of Wa. Undoubtedly these conclusions were influenced by the discovery of the gold seal and the need in his own mind to disassociate it at all cost either from importance in genuine Japanese history or at least disassociate it from the ancient kingdom of Wa.</p>
<p>Miyake Yonekichi’s conclusions met with rebuttal in the 1890s, but interestingly those scholars who initially disagreed with him in print—Kume Kunitake (1839–1931), Kan Masatomo (or Suga Masatomo, 1824–97), and Hoshino Hisashi (1839–1917)—one by one all switched their positions and came on board with Miyake’s conclusions. These three men were considerably older and more established than Miyake, but they nonetheless recognized that his arguments—especially his resolution of the proper understanding of the seal’s inscription—were correct. Hoshino and Kume were professors at the recently founded Imperial University in Tokyo; Kan, the oldest of the group, was the chief priest of Grand Ise Shrine dedicated to the Sun Goddess, fountainhead of the Shinto religion. What won the day for them was Miyake’s use of philology.</p>
<p>Although philology has all but become a term of derogation in most academic disciplines in North America, it was the queen of the disciplines in mid-Meiji Japan.</p>
<p>It should be noted that Miyake’s achievement was made not by obliterat-ing the entire model and all studies that preceded his own, but by building on them and elevating the entire discussion to a new level with the introduction of modern philological methods. The advance here may, then, be understood as a form of shifting paradigms on the model of Thomas Kuhn’s (1922–96) <em>The</em> *Structure of Scientific Revolutions. * 12 * * The nature of the discord between schools of thought from the time of Kamei Nanmei’s initial essay through most of the nineteenth century was simply spinning its wheels and no longer producing anything new or innovative. It would take a change in approach to relaunch the discussion into a more productive direction, and that was precisely Miyake’s contribution.</p>
<p>The decades following Miyake’s essay mark the maturation of modern Japanese historical scholarship. Overall there were fewer essays on the gold seal in the Taishō and early Shōwa years, though the topic never disappeared from research interests. One of the problems plaguing continued research, 12  Thomas S. Kuhn, <em>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</em> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1962).</p>
<p>The Gold Seal Of 57 CE</p>
<p>57</p>
<p>especially after Miyake had “solved” the enigma of the inscription’s meaning, was the simple fact that the seal was not readily available for viewing, to say nothing of physically examining it. Then came the run up to Japanese aggression and expansionism on the mainland and full-fledged war.</p>
<p>There were efforts to assess the gold seal within the system of seals awarded by the Former and Later Han courts to domestic and foreign entities, and frequently the gold seal was considered an outlier. Few seals made of gold and few with the snake-shaped handle had been discovered prior to the end of World War II. These facts led a number of scholars to question the authenticity of the gold seal, and a small number of scholars were even prepared to judge it a fabrication.</p>
<p>The problem, of course, with Chinese artifacts has been that there are countless items deep in the soil but they are not so easily unearthed. The discipline of archaeology needed to be developed and well funded, as it would be after the war. The new regime in China following the Communists coming to power in 1949 discovered promptly that there was no discipline so intimately tied to national pride, national identity, and national unity as archaeology, especially in a culture that for millennia had tended to revere the old and privilege the ancient over the new and the modern. Even the Communists, who had long made a business of destroying everything that smacked of traditional Chinese culture, found “Chinese” heritage too tempting to ignore as it built its own claims to being the legitimate heirs of its numerous predecessors.</p>
<p>Thus, archaeology was supported and got off the ground in China soon after the new regime consolidated its power. And, sure enough, artifacts underground were more than accommodating. In 1956 another gold seal with a snake design at its top was discovered in a Former Han tomb in Shizhaishan, Yunnan Province, and this Yunnan find more or less shut the door on claims that the gold seal found in Japan was bogus. The Yunnan seal was inscribed “Dian wang zhi yin” (seal of the sovereign of [the state of] Dian [Yunnan]), and its face is a square measuring 2.4 centimeters to a side; it is thought to date to the end of the Former Han dynasty, and its coiled snake is much more easily recognizable as such than that of the gold seal discovered in Japan.13 The Yunnan seal 13  See Li Kunsheng, “‘Dian wang zhi yin’ yu ‘Han Wei Nu guowang’ yin zhi bijiao yanjiu”</p>

<p>bce) conquered the area in 109 bce, and when the king of Dian surrendered, the historical record tells us that he was given a royal seal (undoubtedly the very one discovered in 1956).</p>
<p>Then, in 1983 another gold seal—this one with a dragon-shaped handle—</p>
<p>was discovered in the excavated tomb of the king of the early “Vietnamese”</p>
<p>state of Nam Viêt in what is now Xianggangshan, Guangdong Province in southeastern China. It is a bit larger, measuring 3.1 centimeters on each side, and bears the inscription “Wendi xingxi” (seal of Văn Ðế), namely the seal of the second ruler of Nam Viêt, whose personal name was Triệu Mạt (Chinese, Zhao Mo, r. 137–122 bce), grandson of the dynastic founder, Triệu Ðà (Chinese, *2,000 years and the gold seal to the king of Dian [Yunnan]) *(Nagasaki: Nagasaki Kōshibyō</p>

<p>Zhao Tuo, c. 230–137 bce). It is widely believed to have been privately produced, not imperially bestowed on the ruler of Nam Viêt.14</p>
<p>Around 183 bce, under the influence of Empress Lü (d. 180 bce), the Han dynasty began restricting trade with outlying areas. Zhao Tuo protested, and she had his relatives all murdered and his ancestral tomb demolished. Soon thereafter, according to the treatise on the kingdom of Nam Viêt in the <em>Shi ji</em> <em>(Records of the Grand Historian</em>, * * fascicle 113) of Sima Qian (145–86 bce), Zhao Tuo began calling himself <em>di</em> (emperor) without informing the Han court, and Emperor Wen (r. 180–157 bce) sent a high official by the name of Lu Jia (240–</p>
<p>170 bce) to investigate. Zhao responded apologetically in the form of a letter which he signed “Manyi dazhang laofu chen Tuo” (“your aged subject [Zhao]</p>
<p>Tuo, a barbarian chieftain”), by which he effectively demoted himself (rather dramatically) from putative “emperor” to “barbarian” and, like other Han 14  Mai Yinghao and Li Jin, “Guangzhou Xianggang Nan Yue wangmu muzhu kao” (“Analysis of the main figure buried in the royal tomb of Nam Viêt at Elephant Ridge, Guangzhou”), *Kaogu yu wenwu 6 *(1986): 83–87; Diana Lary, “The Tomb of the King of Nanyue—The Contemporary Agenda of History, Scholarship and Identity,” <em>Modern China</em> 22.1 (1996): 3–27.

<p>(“Male and female power holders in the Dian kingdom, as compared with the state of Yamatai”), <em>Yūsei kōko kiyō</em> 18 (1992): 113–29. Kajiyama Masaru argues for a number of reasons that the Nam Viêt gold seal may have been produced in Nam Viêt (and not in or near the Han capital); see his “Zen Kan Nan Etsu ōbo shutsudo no kin’in ‘Buntei gyōji’ ni kansuru ichi kōsatsu” (“A study of the gold seal [inscribed] ‘Wendi xingxi’ unearthed at a royal Nam Viêt tomb from the Former Han era”), <em>Kodai bunka</em> 36.10 (1984): 23–30.</p>

<p>officials, dropped his surname. His grandson took the further step of issuing himself an imperial seal, ironically with the same imperial name of Wendi.15</p>
<p>One further gold seal deserves mention in this comparative context. It was unearthed in 1981 from the second tomb at Ganquan, a village about twenty kilometers to the northwest of the city of Yangzhou. At its base it forms a square 2.3 centimeters to a side, bears a tortoise handle, and carries the inscription</p>
<p>“Guangling wang xi” (“seal of the prince of Guangling [a fiefdom awarded by Emperor Ming, r. 57–75, to his younger brother, Liu Jing, 37–67]”).16 Liu Jing was the ninth son of Emperor Guangwu, founder of the Later Han; he was enfeoffed at age two (in 39 ce) as <em>gong</em> (“duke” or “prince”) of Shanyang and elevated two years later to <em>wang</em> (prince or king) of Shanyang. When Guangwu died in 57 ce, he was succeeded by his fourth son Liu Zhuang (28–75 ce) as Emperor Ming, and the next year Liu Jing was promoted to “prince of Guangling.” He committed suicide in 67 after being exposed in a treasonous incident, and his seal was buried with him.</p>
<p>Because it was forged in the year 58 ce, only one year after the Later Han gold seal was presented to the ruler of the state of Na, Okazaki Takashi (1923–</p>
<p>90) has argued (and Kajiyama Masaru concurs) that, given their uncanny resemblance—such as the presence of scales on the animal figures of their respective handles, the similarities in the calligraphy of the inscriptions, and the similar way in which the inscriptions were cut—they were most likely fashioned in the same workshop in Luoyang.</p>
<p>Although both are made of gold, there are some important differences. The Guangling seal was designated a <em>xi</em>, * * while the Na seal does not even bear one of the three Chinese graphs designating a “seal.” Second, the Guangling seal has a tortoise handle, while the Na seal has a coiled snake. Finally, the color of the ribbon originally accompanying the seals differed as well, with the Guangling’s 15  See Tsuruma Kazuyuki, <em>Faasuto enperaa no isan, Shin Kan teikoku (Bequest of the first</em> <em>emperor, the Qin-Han empire)</em> (Tokyo: Kōdansha, 2004), 172, 235.</p>

Both recipients enjoyed the position of <em>wang</em> or prince, but they were nonetheless at different levels because of the external versus internal nature of their respective places within the Sinosphere—that is, the China-centered world of culture and international relations.17</p>

<p>The Gold Seal of 57 CE</p>
<p>As these new finds and many more like them indicate, a whole new approach was required in the postwar years to make sense of the field of seals, sigillography, into which the gold seal discovered in Kyushu in 1784 would be placed. The normative texts about seals dating from centuries past were no longer seen as the best guide and certainly not the only guide to understanding where the gold seal fit. The new model discipline supplanting the philological paradigm established at the end of the nineteenth century would now be science. In a sense, just as Japan had lacked truly scientific thinking but had been led down the primrose path to irrational, mystical thinking in the 1930s and 1940s in which decisions of great import were made on the basis of tenuous, xenophobic thinking rather than reason, leading to the insanity of war and aggression, so now the postwar era would be one grounded in reasoned thought and science. Archaeology was only one part of this shift, although certainly an important part. The representative essay that marks this paradigmatic change was published in 1968 by Okazaki Takashi, the noted historian of early China and Japan. In many ways, the shift in studying the gold seal was into a world governed by science: the same world we inhabit today. The power of science is all around us, upending (potentially errant) human judgments and past mis-deeds all the time. One of the rare scholars allowed to actually examine the seal, Okazaki (and his assistants) applied a host of scientific tests to it in an effort to allay the least doubt about the seal’s authenticity. Cold, hard science recognizes no human frailty or prejudice; it is its own universe of verifiability which we ignore at our peril. This was a universe in which “science,” because of its putative claims to universal applicability and pure objectivity, had become the final arbiter of “truth.” The intent of Okazaki’s fine essay was to put an end to any and all allegations of fabrication. And, inasmuch as the seal was not at all easily available for scientific investigation, his study loomed all the larger.18</p>

<p>The Gold Seal Of 57 CE</p>

<p>Both hard science and archaeology have advanced beyond the stage they were a generation ago, but the status of science remains exalted. It has come under attack by postmodernists from one side and religiously inspired men and women from another; its putative sanctity has been criticized from other realms as well, but it still enjoys enormous veneration, as much outside the academy as in. The gold seal is, for example, the shining treasure of the Fukuoka City Museum where it now resides.</p>
<p>As of this writing, we may be seeing a fourth phase in the study of the gold seal, what might be called constructivism. This view, heavily indebted to postmodernism, effectively sees much of reality and certainly the historical past as a construction of the individual perceiver. Few would disagree with the idea that everyone’s sense of reality is different, though most would find it difficult to accept the idea that such differences—with the exception perhaps of schizophrenics—amount to anything fundamental. In 2006 a scholar of ancient Japanese literature by the name of Miura Sukeyuki (b. 1946) from Chiba University published a volume aimed at toppling all supports underpin-ning the authenticity of the gold seal.19 That meant debunking every aspect of the received story and coming up with an elaborate conspiracy theory for how it was forged (in both senses of the verb) in the months or years prior to its putative unearthing in 1784. This he does with a fair degree of expertise, though, to be sure, there are holes (some small, some gaping) in his argument.</p>
<p>Miura is not simply a run-of-the-mill conspiracy theorist run wild, though conspiracy theory is at the core of his argument. He makes a great deal of every point in the seal’s known history where confusion enters the picture, and he sees actors behind many of these points of uncertainty. It is not enough for him simply to raise numerous points where the story gets murky and thus claim forgery, and he knows it. Instead, he goes the next step and offers an elaborate thesis of how and why the seal was fabricated (in 1784) and who the culprit behind the conspiracy was. In the end he points a finger directly at none other than Kamei Nanmei himself. To make his case even more dramatic, he claims that, if he is proven wrong with further scientific tests—he is interestingly willing to accept the independent proof offered by science which presumably can distinguish a 2000-year-old seal from a 200-year-old one—he will go to Nanmei’s grave, fall to his knees, and apologize to his spirit.</p>
<p>19  Miura Sukeyuki, <em>Kin’in gizō jiken: Kan no Wa no Na no kokuō no maboroshi (The incident of</em> <em>the forged golden seal: The illusion of “King of Na in Wa, under the Han”)</em> (Tokyo: Gentōsha, 2006).</p>
<p>64</p>
<p>The Gold Seal of 57 CE</p>
<p>Riding the wave set in motion by Miura’s book and the newspaper articles and debates that followed as well as a series of his own essays, in 2010 Suzuki Tsutomu (b. 1949) published a volume which approached the gold seal from the heretofore unexplored realm of the history of metallurgical technology.20</p>
<p>Although his ultimate position remains a bit vague, in no small part because of the hyperscientific nature of his specialty, Suzuki effectively cast great doubt—not from the perspective of constructivism but from that of better science—on the capacity of Han-era Chinese to cast a seal of the quality of the gold seal. It is still much too early to tell if constructivism or better (newer and more sharply penetrating) science will constitute the discipline of a new paradigm, or if neither will force us to shift gears. The jury remains out.</p>
<p>Where does that leave us now? The likelihood of finding new documents is extremely small. Ōtani Mitsuo (b. 1927), the scholar who has done more research on and unearthed more materials concerning the gold seal than anyone, is unlikely to have an heir. Whether the fourth wave of historiography on the gold seal will be able to sustain itself—and whether that wave will be predominantly social constructivism or better science—remain to be seen.</p>
<p>The first three waves, though, have fully made themselves felt. While each was transcended by the next, it is hard to imagine the present state of scholarship on the gold seal, or much of anything else, without the preceding stages. Thus, Kamei Nanmei’s world of Confucianism in Fukuoka or Miyake Yonekichi’s world of philology in the straitlaced world of Tokyo at the turn of the last century may be far from our own, but they nonetheless produced indispensable scholarship which we ignore at our intellectual peril. And, despite the use of what are now probably outdated scientific methods in the 1960s, Okazaki Takeshi’s work remains finely tuned and balanced. To ignore any of this work would not only be perilous—it would be downright foolish.</p>
