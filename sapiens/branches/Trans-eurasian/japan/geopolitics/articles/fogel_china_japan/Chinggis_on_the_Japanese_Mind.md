+++

A specialist on neither Mongolian nor Inner Asian history, my discussion of Chinggis Khan centers on the uses to which his perceived heroic stature was put in late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century Japan. I came across the stories that will unfold in this essay twice in the process of other, tangential research. Most recently, I completed the translation of a novel about the life of Chinggis Khan by the great historical novelist Inoue Yasushi 井上靖 \(1907–91\), entitled *Aoki ōkami * 蒼き狼 \(The Blue Wolf\), which appeared in 2008 from Columbia University Press. It was made into a blockbuster movie released in 

2007 \(http://www.aoki-ookami.com/\) and shot on location in Mongolia. The earlier occasion was the translation of a work by Masuda Wataru 増田渉 

\(1903–77\), *Seigaku tōzen to Chūgoku jijō, “zassho” sakki * 西学東漸と中国事

情、「雑書」札記 \(The eastern movement of western learning and con-

ditions in China, notes on “various books”\), which appeared in English as *Japan and China: Mutual Representations in the Modern Era* in 2000.1 Rough contemporaries, Inoue and Masuda came of age in the vibrant Taishō era and would have encountered the second incarnation of the Chinggis tale in Japan firsthand. 

The name of Minamoto no Yoshitsune 源義経 is extremely well known, indeed a household name, in Japan, although likely to be recognized only by specialists elsewhere. He was born in 1159 during the tumultuous times at the end of the Heian period \(794–1185\). That same year Yoshitsune’s father and two of his older brothers were killed amid the civil wars of the time, while he and his mother found protection in a temple near Kyoto. He later joined the fighting, allegedly became a great hero, performed extraordinary feats, was famed for his ability to cut leaves with his sword as they floated to the ground from trees and various other exemplary talents, and has had his tale sung in countless fictional and semi-fictional renditions ever since. He was ultimately betrayed and compelled to commit ritual suicide in 1189—at the tender age of 29 or 30. He later became the heroic central figure of the celebrated historical novel, *Heike monogatari * 平家物語 \(Tale of the Heike\). 

However, for those Japanese unable to accept his death—something he seems prepared to have acknowledged himself, if his *seppuku*** **切腹 or ritual 1  Original: \(Tokyo: Iwanami shoten, 1979\); translation: \(Richmond, Surrey: Curzon, 2000\).

Chinggis on the Japanese Mind

self-disembowelment is any indication—legends soon grew up around his stunning escape from the jaws of death. The massive Edo-period collection, *Dai Nihon shi * 大日本史, for example, claims that Yoshitsune may indeed have died in 1189, but goes on to note that it was generally believed that he escaped to Ezo 蝦夷, the toponym associated with what is now Hokkaidō, there to be deified by locals: “The story has been passed down that Yoshitsune did not die at Koromogawa no tate, but escaped to Ezo” 世伝義經不死於衣河館、遁至

蝦夷. “However, perhaps Yoshitsune’s death was faked and he escaped. To this day, Ezo locals revere Yoshitsune. They have enshrined and deified him” \(然則

義經偽死而遁去乎、至今夷人祟奉義經、祀而神之\).2 In fact, according 

to some late Edo texts, Yoshitsune’s devoted retainer, Benkei 弁慶 \(immortalized in a statue of him standing with sword raised at the Gojō Bridge in Kyoto\), helped him flee to the north. 

Yet this was not the end of speculations about Yoshitsune as evidenced in the work of Suematsu Kenchō 末松謙澄 \(1855–1920\), who was born into a low-ranking samurai family in Fukuoka in 1855. Like many men of such backgrounds, he became a journalist, but in his case with extraordinary connections in the political world, notably to Itō Hirobumi 伊藤博文, one of the most important political figures of the entire Meiji era. Suematsu eventually married one of Itō’s daughters. He somehow made his way to London, England in 1878 and two years later to Cambridge to study law. Given the bizarre views he published there, I was suspicious that he may have fabricated this part of his life story. I thus wrote the registrar at St. Johns College, Cambridge University, and learned that their records indicate that he did indeed complete his degree there. 

In 1879, the year after he arrived in England, Suematsu published \(possibly, self-published\) a volume in clearly non-native, though nonetheless highly impressive, English entitled: *The Identity of the Great Conqueror Genghis* 2  On Yoshitsune and the *Dai Nihon shi*, see Honda Mitsugi 本多貢, ** ** *Naze Yoshitsune ga Jingisu* *kan ni naru no ka * なぜ義経がジンギスカンになるのか *** ***\(Why did Yoshitsune become Chinggis Khan?\) \(Sapporo: Hokkaidō kyōikusha, 1986\), pp. 51–54. Arai Hakuseki 新井

白石** **\(1657–1725\) suggests a similar story in his *Takushi yoron * 読史余論** **\(Lessons from history\):「義經手ヲ束ネテ死ニ就べキ人ニアラズ、不審ノ事ナリ」\(Yoshitsune 

was not the sort of man who would meet death passively. This is a highly suspicious story.\)「今モ暇夷ノ地ニ義經家跡アリ。マタ夷人飲食ニ必マツルモノ、イハ

ユル『オキクルミ』ト云フハ即義經ノ事ニテ、義經後ニハ奥へ行シナド云伝

へシ卜モ云フ」\(Today there remain traces of Yoshitsune’s home in Ezo \[=Hokkaidō\]. 

Furthermore, there is something called “okikurumi” \[there\], which the locals claim, if one imbibes it, will cause one to be deified, and this refers to Yoshitsune, for Yoshitsune is said to have escaped to the interior\). 

Chinggis on the Japanese Mind

*Khan with the Japanese Hero Yoshitsuné: An Historical Thesis*.3 “Preposterous,” 

“absurd,” and various other sneering adjectives have been used to characterize the utterly unusual thesis of this book, which was translated by Uchida Yahachi 内田弥八 \(1855–1920\) into Japanese in 1885 as *Yoshitsune saikō ki* 義経再興記 \(Yoshitsune rides again\) and the next year by Shimizu Ichijirō 清

水市次郎 in a popular edition under the title *Tsūzoku Yoshitsune saikō ki * 通俗

義経再興記; both became bestsellers and went through numerous editions.4 

The story was retold in fictional form in 1958 by Takagi Akimitsu 高木彬光 as *Jingisu kan no himitsu * 成吉思汗の秘密 \(Chinggis Khan’s secret\),5 although the original was already about as close to fiction as putative non-fiction can be. 

What sorts of evidence did Suematsu provide for his extraordinary thesis? 

His analysis offers a case study in one kind of nineteenth-century historiography which still finds advocates and contributors today. Inasmuch as his story has been told extremely briefly in a few obscure places,6 I shall not belabor it here, but move on to the second incarnation of this thesis in Japan—which has as yet not received any significant scholarly attention, though raised quite a tumult in its day. Discussion of Suematsu’s ideas should not be construed as my believing that there is so much as a scintilla of evidence for any of Suematsu’s claims. What makes them interesting is, thus, not his conclusions but how he reaches them and how they became so popular in certain quarters in Japan. 

For example, Suematsu will often tentatively put forth a notion, offer equally tentative evidence \(full of maybes and possiblys\), and then conclude with utter certainty. Thus, although the rumor that Yoshitsune escaped to Ezo has been mentioned by historians as just that—a rumor—it was never accepted by any serious historian. Suematsu, nonetheless, throws it out, mentions as “evidence” 

that Yoshitsune was deified by Hokkaidō “aboriginals,” and then concludes \(all in the space of two pages\): “Indeed, Yoshitsuné’s escape to the island of 3  \(London: W.H. and L. Collingridge, 1879\).

Chinggis on the Japanese Mind

Ezo is an indisputable fact” \(p. 14\). He claims the American editor of the *Tokyo* *Times*, * * Edward H. House, had earlier identified Chinggis and Yoshitsune, thus pushing the idea of this identification off on another—that is, by denying originality for the idea, he effectively disavows all responsibility for the Chinggis-Yoshitsune identification and thus effectively downplays any personal credit for an innovative “historical thesis.” There is, incidentally, no mention at all of this topic in the writings by House cited by Suematsu. 

Getting Yoshitsune to Hokkaidō, though, is a relatively minor point in Suematsu’s overarching argument; as he notes, it is something many had long been prepared to entertain, if not wholeheartedly believe, but most of those who were prepared to accept the possibility of his escaping there were satisfied as well to accept the fact that he died on Japan’s northernmost island. 

For Suematsu, however, this point is only the beginning. Once he had gotten Yoshitsune to Hokkaidō, he needed to find a way for him to sail or swim to mainland Northeast Asia. Thus, while it may have seemed like a minor point to acknowledge the off chance of Yoshitsune’s escape from betrayal and death in 1189, it is a slippery slope. Now one must follow Suematsu’s “reasoning” to the end. There are few more slippery slopes. 

Once we are resigned to Yoshitsune’s escape, the voyage to mainland East Asia actually proves a minor stumbling block—at least as compared with what will follow—especially inasmuch as there is no mention of *how* he might have made the trip: navigation, ships, and the like. By citing several works from the late Edo period, he claims: “From this light we can see that Yoshitsuné not only crossed over the sea, but became the king of Mantchoo. If this be so the custom of shaving the head of the Tartars might be an imitation of the shaven crowns of ‘Benkei and the other monk soldiers who accompanied him,’ ” \(p. 24\). And, before the reader can so much as catch his or her breath in the face of these wildly unsubstantiated claims, let alone voice any doubt, just a few pages later Suematsu writes in italics: “*one thing is quite certain, that Yoshitsuné and his* *followers crossed the sea from Yezo to Tartary*” \(p. 33\). Suematsu has worked some clever “logic,” here: while the reader may find his statements following Yoshitsune’s arrival on mainland East Asia troubling—such as his gaining sovereign control over Manchuria or the influence of Benkei on local fighters—

acceptance of his arrival now pales by comparison with these new claims. A susceptible reader might think that the less outlandish claims are—at least for the moment—passable, but the wilder claims cannot stand. The slope just got more slippery. 

It is one thing to get Yoshitsune to Manchuria, let alone Mongolia, and it is quite another to claim that he was to become Chinggis Khan one and the same. 

Here we find Suematsu deploying another form of discursive legerdemain. 

Chinggis on the Japanese Mind

105

“Well, my readers,” he writes “it is indeed wonderful, as Mr. Howorth \[author of the multi-volume *History of the Mongols*, * * 1876–80\] observes, if Genghis Khan was really a Tartar; but can you be so shortsighted as to suppose, even after you are in possession of the information which fairly contradicts it, that the barren deserts of Tartary should produce such a wonderful man? I shall at once reply, Certainly not. Such anomalies can never be possible” \(p. 35\). How, he is arguing, could a world conqueror emerge from out of virtually nowhere? It would require Chinggis to be an extraordinary historical anomaly. Thus, Suematsu uses this constructed form of common sense to disabuse his readers of this utter impossibility. Without even a discussion of that place from whence Chinggis Khan was “alleged” to have hailed, Suematsu has written off Mongolia as capable of producing a world conqueror. Once a reader accepts this kind of madly stretched but nonetheless feeble reasoning, the end is nowhere in sight. 

Suematsu continues: “We know very well he was no exception. We know he had a previous career of contest and glory. He was one Yoshitsuné, the very man whose early life and greatness we have spoken of before” \(p. 36\). 

Suematsu marshals many such random occurrences, in a fashion not unlike conspiracy theorists, to prove that there are no random occurrences in the world. So, Yoshitsune escapes to Hokkaidō and then sails to Manchuria, and to prove that he became a great leader, Suematsu proceeds negatively. How could someone of Yoshitsune’s military prowess sit around on his haunches and do nothing? Destined for greatness he was, and so he became Chinggis Khan. 

Even a generous reader, willing to accept some of Suematsu’s line of argument, might justifiably aver that this last bit is an enormous leap—where is the written evidence? Suematsu is ready, though, for the reason we have no solid written data on Chinggis’s early life in Manchuria, he writes, is not because the Mongols had no written language during those years, but of course because the man who was destined to become Chinggis was not yet on the mainland. 

The most interesting of Suematsu’s evidence—again, all of it completely bogus—is linguistic. We still see this kind of argumentation made by some scholars and lay people, almost always by non-linguists. Linguistic sleight of hand of this sort should stand as a cautionary tale of sorts. For example, Yoshitsune’s family name of Minamoto 源 is pronounced *gen* in its *on* \(Chinese-based\) reading, which happens to coincide with the first syllable of the Great Khan’s name; and, of course, the later Mongol dynastic name is a precise hom-onym *yuán * 元 \(also pronounced *gen * in Japanese\). Both imply origin, source, or root, and obviously, Suematsu states, this was behind Khubilai’s choice of the name for his dynasty \(p. 72\). 

The “tsune” 經 of Yoshitsune is read *kei* in its *on* reading, only a stone’s throw away from *khan. * What about the great khan’s birth name, Temüjin? 

106

Chinggis on the Japanese Mind

Chinggis’s father Yisügei gave him the name Temüjin \(after the chieftain he had just defeated\). Actually, however, Suematsu informs us, “Temüjin” comes from the Japanese *tenjin * 天神, which Yoshitsune used as cover in the new land \(and, presumably, with a bit of inside humor to boot\) \(p. 107\). And, Yisugei’s own name derives from Ezo-kai 蝦夷海 \(sea of Ezo, pp. 73, 81–2\). Suematsu does not bother to explain how Yoshitsune’s father made the trip to the mainland, given the fact that he had died in 1159, nor does he try to resuscitate the father as he had the son. It would have bogged him down in annoying details. 

Chinggis took as the name for his eldest son Jochi, and where might that have come from? Mount Fuji, of course \(p. 110\), the sacred Japanese mountain, and thus Chinggis was able to keep his beloved Japanese heritage alive on the mainland. Why then would his beloved grandson have tried so hard to conquer Japan? Khubilai was only trying to avenge the maltreatment visited on his grandfather. It would be extremely difficult to make this stuff up. 

There are many other, similarly impossible linguistic resonances cited by Suematsu as direct proofs, but let us look at just one of the more eccentric. 

He often refers to a long French work, *Histoire du grand Genghizcan premier* *empereur des anciens Mogols et Tartares*, by François Pétis, dating to 1710.7 Pétis alleges that the *Secret History*, * * a work Suematsu has gone overboard to debunk for many obvious reasons, refers to the descendants of the early Mongol figures in its opening pages as “Nouranyoun.” Indeed, Pétis does make this claim with no substance whatsoever, and it is altogether unclear what Mongolian term he may have been trying to replicate in French. Suematsu then claims that “Nouranyoun” became corrupted to Niron which, apparently only in Pétis’s Mongolian lect, means “children of light.” Suematsu could not have prayed for a more amicable colleague, removed so far in time and space: both terms are much too close to the Japanese term, Nihonjin 日本人 \(the Japanese people\), which like “children of light,” he goes on to claim, means the “sun’s origin men.” It never dawns on any of our critics that the pronunciation of Chinese, Japanese, and Mongolian might have changed over the intervening seven centuries. All of this is what genuine linguists call *Klang * association, from the German word for sound, making etymological connections between words on the basis of sound alone without any external or historical evidence of substance. 

There are many more such inanities in Suematsu’s work, but one can only wonder what he was really up to. Here was a man intent on studying Greek and Roman law at Cambridge University in an era when Japan was supposed to be learning modern historical science through the empirical method and 7  \(Paris: Chez la veuve Jombert, 1710\), p. 13.

under the influence of Leopold von Ranke. Why would he have adopted such a fantastic thesis? Nagayama Yasuo 長山靖生 refers to Suematsu in his book on why people fabricate history and hypothesizes that it was all an attempt on Suematsu’s part to overcome the discrimination he must have felt as a poor Japanese student in Victorian Britain. With his earlier training in literary Chinese texts and alleged contact with the Chinggis=Yoshitsune idea through the American newspaper editor, he used this “historical thesis” as a way to demonstrate to the literate Anglophone world that Japan was not only once great but in fact had produced the greatest military figure in history.8 Nagayama’s theory may ring true, but it is entirely speculation. 

Perhaps, Suematsu knew from the start that his thesis was entirely bogus, but was either making his claim tongue-in-cheek or in an effort to cash in on a potentially gullible Anglophone readership.9 Conspiracy theorists are often motivated by monetary gain. As a journalist in Japan just prior to his departure for England, Suematsu had covered the rebellion in 1877 of Saigō 

Takamori 西郷隆盛 \(1827–77\). Disgruntled by many of the Meiji government’s policies, Saigō led a rebellion against the regime which was quickly crushed and in which he perished, possibly taking his own life. Soon thereafter, though, rumors began to circulate among his former followers that Saigō had in fact not died and that he would some day return from China or India or even Tsarist Russia and repair the injustice his 1877 revolt had failed to correct. Perhaps, Suematsu took his lead from these tales about his fellow Kyushu native to concoct the Yoshitsune-Chinggis tale. 

Regardless, several decades later in 1924 a little known man by the name of Oyabe Zen’ichirō 小谷部全一郎 \(1867–1941\) revived this story and published a full-length study entitled *Jingisu kan wa Minamoto no Yoshitsune nari * 成吉

思汗ハ源義経也 \(Chinggis Khan was Minamoto no Yoshitsune\), a work reissued any number of times including, most recently, in 2000. Oyabe’s personal history is no less exotic than Suematsu’s. Born into a samurai family only a few years before class status was itself abolished, Oyabe was adopted into a merchant household and had by all accounts a miserable childhood. Eventually, he ran off to Hokkaidō \(not unlike Yoshitsune, in Suematsu’s thesis\) and was embraced by the local Ainu populace. Overcome by their kindnesses, Oyabe vowed to return the favor someday. Like Suematsu, he struggled and managed to travel abroad—in Oyabe’s case, to the United States—and there earned 8  Nagayama Yasuo, *Hito wa naze rekishi o gizō suru no ka * 人はなぜ歴史を偽造するのか** **

Chinggis on the Japanese Mind

a doctoral degree from Yale University, became a Christian minister, and returned to Hokkaidō to look after the local folk, build a school, and work for their social and economic betterment. He too wrote a book in English, a memoir entitled *A Japanese Robinson Crusoe*.10

Oyabe made a point of visiting all the sites of Yoshitsune’s alleged escape in Hokkaidō and then on to mainland Northeast Asia. In 1920 he traveled to areas in Siberia occupied by the Japanese Army during the infamous Siberian Expedition, including Vladivostok, as well as into Manchuria and Mongolia. By 1920, it should be mentioned, all the countries initially involved in the effort to snuff out Bolshevism in its infancy had retreated, except Japan whose troops remained there until 1922. Oyabe came away more convinced than ever that Yoshitsune and Chinggis were one and the same person.11

The claims in his volume are ultimately not significantly different from Suematsu’s. He did have the distinct advantage of having actually lived in Hokkaidō for many years and having visited all the many sites on the continent associated with the Mongol armies. He thus spends much less time with mind-numbing linguistic evidence to support his claims—not none, just less—and more time describing actual places and people. Writing at a time when modern Japan was making its first modern military adventures onto the Asian mainland, ones that would end in complete failure two years after his trip there, one might easily speculate on the pride that Oyabe may have felt associating the great world conqueror with one of Japan’s most revered and formidable military men, even if he had to bring Yoshitsune back from the dead as Arthur Conan Doyle had to do for Sherlock Holmes. 

Less than a year following the publication of Oyabe’s book, the journal *Chūō *

*shidan * 中央史壇** **put out a special issue entitled *Jingisu kan wa Minamoto no* *Yoshitsune ni arazu * 成吉思汗は源義経にあらず \(Chinggis Khan was not Minamoto no Yoshitsune\). It was comprised of eighteen essays by some of Japan’s most famous academics and public intellectuals of the day, including: Kindaichi Kyōsuke 金田一京助 \(1882–1971\), a linguist with a specialty in the Ainu language; Ōmori Kingorō 大森金五郎 \(1867–1937\), a scholar of Japanese medical history; Fujisawa Morihiko 藤沢衛彦 \(1886–1967\), a specialist in ethnography and mythology; Miyake Setsurei 三宅雪嶺 \(1860–1945\), famed 10  \(Boston and Chicago: The Pilgrim Press, 1898\).

cultural critic and prolific author; Yanai Wataru 箭内亘 \(1875–1926\), pioneer Mongolist and Yuan specialist; and Torii Ryūzō 鳥居龍蔵 \(1870–1953\), Japan’s pioneer anthropologist—all big names in their day. The individual essays bear emphatic titles denying the possibility of Oyabe’s basic contention. In hindsight, the most amazing thing is that they paid his idea any attention at all and must certainly have contributed to the popularity \(and sales\) of his book. 

Not in the least subdued by this avalanche of negative attention, Oyabe penned another book that very year, 1925, defending himself. It bears the same title as his original work with the added subtitle: *Chosha no dōki to sairon * 著者

の動機と再論 \(The author’s motivation and reasessment\);12 and it backs off from his initial arguments not a whit. 

Devoting any time to lengthy disputations with Oyabe’s \(or, for that matter, Suematsu’s\) arguments misses the point, but as fun as they are to ridicule, one should neither simply dismiss them as ridiculous, as one might, for instance, the views of a Gavin Menzies, author of *1421: The Year China Discovered the* *World*, * * a contemporary example of an insane book that has been taken seriously only in China but has garnered the author sales and the attention of those susceptible to crackpot theories of ocean-crossings.13 Indeed, the more negative attention such works receive, the more interest they might elicit especially among popular, non-specialist readers. Rather, getting at why such views may have been argued as forcefully as they were and when they were, and why they became bestsellers, are ultimately more important tasks for the contemporary historian. 

Perhaps we see something of this impetus in Suematsu’s possibly trying to overcome an inferiority complex and show the world how great Japan really was, or \(conversely\) his playing a inside joke on the Anglophone reading public; he was also the first to translate *The Tale of Genji* into English, though only in part.14 Oyabe’s efforts were both to bring luster to the Ainu for putatively helping Yoshitsune and to glorify the latter’s early expansions onto the Asian mainland. Chinggis, of course, lived long before Hitler and Stalin, and his horrific acts of mass murder are located in a cloudy realm of the distant past; in late nineteenth or early twentieth century Japan, before the onset of World War II, he was seen in largely heroic terms, the builder of an empire from nothing. In Suematsu’s and Oyabe’s day, Japan was hardly a prosperous country, late to the task of modernization, not terribly respected in the West or Asia, not 12  \(Tokyo: Fuzanbō, 1925\).

Chinggis on the Japanese Mind

terribly well known in any fashion around the world. In an apparent effort to enhance the world’s respect for Japan, Oyabe penned a highly popular volume in 1929 entitled *Nihon oyobi Nihon kokumin no kigen * 日本及日本國民之起源 

\(The origins of Japan and the Japanese people\), which was reissued a few years ago under the more explanatory title of *Nihonjin no rūtsu wa Yudayajin da* 日本

人のル一ツはユダヤ人だ *. * \(The roots of the Japanese are the Jews\).15 Such a literature was popular then, as later, but mostly to deny any such connection, although Oyabe was clearly identifying the two peoples. However, associating the land of Japan with that of Chinggis Khan, who was known by everyone everywhere, was clearly an attempt—albeit a major stretch—to bask in the great khan’s majestic light.16

One point elided or explained away by both Suematsu and Oyabe concerns the major way in which the Mongols were, in fact, known in Japan. 

Although the Mongols were all but allergic to water and relied entirely upon Chinese and especially Koreans to build a navy once their empire stretched as far as the Pacific coast, they would eventually attempt on two occasions in the late thirteenth century under Khubilai to conquer Japan. We have seen how Suematsu circumvented this problem, and Oyabe seems simply to have ignored it, but it would have taken some doing to overcome such a negative image of the Mongols. Of course, Chinggis was not Khubilai, but they were the greatest Mongol leaders and likely the only two known to Japanese in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Two decades after Oyabe’s book launched this debate, the most famous modern usage to which the defeat of the Mongols’ attempted crossing would be attributed—“divine winds” or *kami-kaze* 神風—would emerge, though by this time they were completely divorced from the original thirteenth-century context.
