  <p>Like the epic, like history, like the novel, the literature of travel has evolved through the centuries. Like them it has existed since the beginnings of oral and written literature. As with them some of its authors have been bad, others have delighted and informed their readers, and many, from the earliest times, have been popular, influential, even brilliant. As with other forms of literature its quantity and nature have varied because of political, religious, economic, and other social and human factors. And like them it includes countless subtypes that continually approach each other, separate, join, overlap, and consistently defy neat classification.1</p>
<p>Travel accounts form an immense literary genre of international proportions, hundreds, even thousands of years old. The global thirst for knowledge of how other peoples live has known no bounds since the reporting of travel tales first began. The reasons for this curiosity abound, from voyeurism to scholarly interest to concerns for military planning. And, the growth of information about the inhabitants of every corner of the globe has in no way diminished contemporary man’s desire to learn more from places and peoples still little known on earth and elsewhere in the universe. Indeed, an entire sub-genre of science fiction, the imaginary voyage, aims at satisfying this curiosity in the realm of the fantastic.2</p>
<p>Japanese travel to China recommenced in 1862 following the lifting of the ban on travel by the Tokugawa bakufu, and travel accounts began to appear immediately. What were the origins of this literary form? There were the well-known diaries of eminent Buddhist monks who voyaged from Japan to China to study with masters in the Sui, T’ang, and Sung periods.3 In addition, the domestic travel diary constituted a well-recognized genre in Japan that dated 1  Percy G. Adams, Travel Literature and the Evolution of the Novel (Lexington: The University Press of Kentucky, 1983), p. 38.</p>

<p>back as far as the Heian period, such as the Tosa nikki (Tosa Diary) of 936.4</p>
<p>During the centuries of Tokugawa prohibition on overseas travel, the Japanese developed a widespread and rich domestic travel literature, dating from as early as 1655.5 Other genres of Chinese writings served as models for Japanese travelers, in particular the local gazetteer (which clearly played a role in siring the guidebook as a genre).6 The other principal Chinese literary form, widely known in Japan and possibly significant in the formation of Japanese travel accounts of China, was that of the earlier fictional voyages: Hsi yu chi (Journey to the West) or T’ao-hua yüan chi (Peach Blossom Spring), for example.7 This last category is especially interesting because of the comparisons it allows us with the rise of European travel literature, as in the cases of Jonathan Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels, Thomas More’s Utopia, and most of Daniel Defoe’s work.</p>

<p>“Guides for Vexed Travelers—Route Books in the Ming and Ch’ing,” Ch’ing-shih wen-t’i 4:5</p>
<p>(1981):32–76. On differences between travel books and guide books, Paul Fussell has the following to say:</p>
<p>A guide book is addressed to those who plan to follow the traveler, doing what he has done, but more selectively. A travel book, at its purest, is addressed to those who do not plan to follow the traveler at all, but who require the exotic or comic anomalies, wonders, and scandals of the literary form romance which their own place or time cannot entirely supply.</p>
<p>Travel books are a sub-species of memoir in which the autobiographical narrative arises from the speaker’s encounter with distant or unfamiliar data, and in which the narrative—unlike that in a novel or romance—claims literal validity by constant reference to actuality. The speaker in a travel book exhibits himself as physically more free than the reader, and thus every such book . . . is an implicit celebration of freedom.</p>

<p>7  For many years T’ao-hua yüan chi was considered a utopian, imaginary piece, until Ch’en Yin-k’o 陳寅恪 demonstrated that, more likely than not, it was in fact an account of a trip to a community distinctive to the Six Dynasties period. See Ch’en Yin-k’o, “T’ao-hua yüan chi p’ang-cheng” 桃花源記旁証, Ch’ing-hua hsüeh-pao 11.1 (1936):79–88. This view has not gone uncriticized. Similarly, Percy Adams has shown how reliant Thomas More’s Utopia was on the then recent travel accounts of Amerigo Vespucci. Namely, many characteristics of his Utopia are exactly as Vespucci described the New World. The very fact that the latter’s name became forever attached to the New World is a reflection of the popularity of his accounts.</p>

<p>Japanese Literary Travelers in Prewar China</p>
<p>As a discernible genre of travel accounts concerning China (as opposed to elsewhere in the world) began to emerge in the latter part of the nineteenth century in Japan, there soon followed sub-genres distinctive to the professions of the authors (politicians, businessmen, Sinologists, teachers, professional travel writers, and the like). In his magisterial treatment of the relationship between travel writing and the rise of the novel in the West, Percy Adams has also found it most useful to divide the varieties of travel literature according to the occupations of the authors.8 Within this large body, an identifiable subgroup of accounts by Japanese novelists and poets began to appear from the first years of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>Several issues concerning the travel account as a medium of literary reportage need to be raised at the outset. Who traveled to China, and why did they go? What places did they visit or, rather, what did they describe having seen?</p>
<p>Not every Japanese author or poet went to China, and some that did, such as Shiga Naoya 志賀直哉 (1883–1971), wrote nothing about it.9 By the same token, writers often did not record events we now know were occurring at the time they were in China. What one, particularly a professional writer, chose to commit to paper, was highly selective. These authors were profoundly aware of their audiences, their patrons, and what each might wish to read. They had established readerships and reputations, as well as certain modes of behavior and literary styles that their readers at home expected to find reflected in their travel accounts. The novelist and self-styled “globe-trotter” Evelyn Waugh (1903–1966) made this general point explicit (in a fleeting moment of sobriety) in one of his many travelogues when he opined on a writer’s descriptions of his travels:</p>
<p>One does not travel, any more than one falls in love, to collect material. . . .</p>
<p>For myself and many better than me, there is a fascination in distant and barbarous places, and particularly in the borderlands of conflicting cultures and states of development, where ideas, uprooted from their traditions, become oddly changed in transplantation. It is there that I find the experiences vivid enough to demand translation into literary form.</p>
<p>Just as a carpenter, I suppose, seeing a piece of rough timber feels an inclination to plane it and square it and put it into shape, so a writer is not really content to leave any experience in the amorphous, haphazard 8  Adams, Travel Literature, pp. 64–70.</p>
<p>9  Nor did Shiga write another novel for the five years following his return from China. Agawa Hiroyuki 阿川弘之, Shiga Naoya no seikatsu to sakuhin (Sōgensha, 1955), p. 286.</p>
<p>Japanese Literary Travelers In Prewar China 521</p>
<p>condition in which life presents it; and putting an experience into shape means, for a writer, putting it into communicable form.10</p>
<p>Several factors distinguished the Japanese from other literary travelers to China. Few Japanese visitors learned to speak Chinese, although many Chinese were able to converse in Japanese, but virtually every author of an account for the period under study could read Kanbun (classical Chinese). This alone enabled a level of literal understanding in China that few Westerners ever attained. Communications with Chinese often took place through the medium of the “pen conversation” (J. hitsudan 筆談, Ch. pi-t’an) in which the participants wrote in classical Chinese, passing a piece of paper between them. This ability to exchange ideas, to ask questions, to use a language to communicate should not be underestimated. Masao Miyoshi has stressed how an inability to converse in English enormously hampered the first Japanese embassy to the United States in 1860.11 The same problem never presented itself to the first Japanese travelers to China (Takasugi Shinsaku 高杉晋作 and others in 1862) when travel became legal, because they had the “pen conversation.”12</p>
<p>Another important (and related) element for Japanese travelers was the instinctive closeness they felt to what was often referred to as Kanji bunka or the culture of Chinese characters. This sense of intimacy (real or imagined) did not always or necessarily imply love or even sympathy for China, but it did make the Japanese traveler think he or she understood China. Thus, because they could read the Chinese language, communicate with their educated Chinese hosts, gain a sense of closeness to the cultural qualities they felt they shared with the Chinese, and describe their experiences often in beautiful prose, Japanese writers who visited China and wrote accounts for the reading public back in Japan have not only left us a marvelous body of writings, but because they were the most famous travelers in their day in Japan, and doubtless the most widely read at the time, were accordingly the most likely to have had an influence in shaping Japanese attitudes and images of China.</p>

<p>Japanese Literary Travelers in Prewar China</p>
<p>The poets, novelists, artists, and other literary types also form the largest occupational subgroup of those who penned travel accounts of China, and they left by far the most interesting and insightful reports as well. In fact, traveling to China seems to have become de rigueur for members of the Japanese literary scene, inasmuch as virtually every major figure during the prewar period made a trip to China, and most wrote accounts for their readers in Japan. Also, as Japan’s involvement in China grew and as the Japanese reading public became more interested in contemporary events there, China became a setting for the novels and short stories of authors such as Muramatsu Shōfū 村松梢風 and Yokomitsu Riichi 横光利一 (1898–1947).</p>
<p>The earliest travel account by a Japanese literary figure is that of Futabatei Shimei (1872–1912), the novelist and famous interpreter of Russian literature, who visited China in the summer of 1902. However, if he met a single Chinese person, he kept it to himself. He did meet many Russians in Manchuria and many Japanese throughout China, but his diary will today be of interest primarily to Futabatei scholars. Perhaps an inability to converse in Chinese proved too severe an obstacle to overcome. He was followed the next year by the poet Sasaki Nobutsuna 佐々木信綱 (1872–1963). Sasaki offered a lovely description of his trip along the Yangtze and the sunset outside Hankow: “I felt as if I were in some paradise.” Soochow proved to be his favorite place with its beautiful pagodas, textiles, and elegant people; it reminded him of Kyoto. He too, though, ignored virtually everything going on around him.13</p>
<p>The first important account of travel to the Asian mainland was Natsume Sōseki’s) (1867–1916) Man-Kan tokoro dokoro (Here and There in Manchuria and Korea). In the fall of 1909, several months after he had finished his novel Sore kara (And Then), Sōseki accepted an assignment from the Asahi shinbun to write a series on a trip through Manchuria and Korea. Although somewhat reluctant, his curiosity about what his countrymen had achieved since the victory over Russia four years earlier combined with the encouragement of his friend Nakamura Zekō 中村是公 (1867–1927), then President of Japan’s South Manchurian Railway Company (SMR), to convince him. Nakamura for his part knew well what Sōseki’s famous name could mean for the young SMR’s public relations. Well aware of this, Sōseki was not about to act as a mouthpiece for the SMR. Yet he was impressed by their work, as he noted in letters home (but not in his travel account): “As I traveled around Manchuria and Korea, I really 13  Futabatei Shimei, “Yūgai kikō,” in Futabatei Shimei zenshū (Iwanami shoten, 1953), 11:153–</p>

<p>Japanese Literary Travelers In Prewar China 523</p>
<p>felt as though the Japanese were indeed a trustworthy people”; “Japanese are vigorously engaging in activities all over Manchuria, and these activities are just remarkable. I thought that the Japanese were really something.”14</p>
<p>Sōseki put his estimable literary talents to work in describing the social conditions he witnessed. In literary terms, he consciously chose a highly objective style of reportage in opposition to the naturalism so prevalent in Japan at the time. The roots of modern Japanese realism, it has been argued, can be found in this reportage style. One of the recurring images in Sōseki’s account was his amazement at how hard Chinese laborers worked, an image picked up by subsequent travelers. When he arrived in Dairen, he observed and wrote at length about the coolies who carried huge sacks of soy beans on their backs up three flights of stairs over and over again, and always in complete silence.</p>
<p>“Their silence and their regulated movements, their endurance and their precision seemed to me like the shadow of fate itself. While I stood and observed them, for a moment I was overcome with an exceedingly eerie feeling.”15</p>
<p>One harrowing scene that Sōseki witnessed and was sadly unable to do anything about occurred in Fengtien (present-day Shenyang). He saw an impoverished old laborer in the middle of the road with the skin literally torn off his foot. People were gathered around to stare at the old man’s gaping wound, all in silence, and the victim likewise stared expressionless at the ground next to his mangled limb. Sōseki could no longer control the non-participatory reporter in himself, and cried out for a doctor, but his Chinese guide simply drove on, ignoring the incident. One senses in reading this passage that Sōseki could not escape feeling somehow complicit in a crime, and that made him much more than just a visitor in China. But, his chosen style of objective, non-personalized reportage in a curious way provided a loophole from lingering guilt. He nonetheless remained deeply troubled.16</p>
<p>This volume is interestingly the least highly regarded of Sōseki’s works. One has to look through many of the numerous biographical and critical writings about him to find even passing mention of it. To a considerable extent, this is due to postwar Japanese guilt at Japanese activities in China, Korea, and Manchuria. There he was trekking around Manchuria under Japanese colonial 14  Cited in Takeuchi Minoru 竹内実, “Sōseki no Man-Kan tokoro dokoro,” in Takeuchi Minoru, Nihonjin ni totte no Chūgokuzō (Shunjūsha, 1966), pp. 296–99.</p>

<p>dominion, staying in Japanese hotels, meeting with Japanese living there, riding the South Manchurian Railway, and not once did he mention these facts.17</p>
<p>Sōseki, I would argue, chose not to mention them because he did not want to offer the SMR free publicity, however impressed he was with their work. One scholar noted of Sōseki’s account: “I’ve heard it said that it really wasn’t Man-Kan tokoro dokoro but Sōseki tokoro dokoro. It has little to do with Manchuria and Korea and more to do with the rumors [he picked up from] the guys he met there.”18</p>
<p>Another element of his style, his sarcasm, has served to confuse matters. Sōseki used the expression “Chan” (short for the extremely deprecatory</p>
<p>“Chankoro”) to refer to the Chinese on occasion. In this he simply was unable to transcend the prejudices of his time, much in the unmistakably condescending way Evelyn Waugh referred to locals wherever he traveled. Sōseki (again, like Waugh) was just as prepared, though, to turn his sarcasm on himself. The first sentence of his account reads: “When I asked in all seriousness just what in the world the SMR was, the President of the SMR looked at me in amazement and said: ‘You sure are stupid.’”19 Incidentally, Nakamura was widely known for his vulgarity by the SMR staff who had dubbed him as “a pig in a frock coat.”</p>
<p>Lengthy analysis of whether Sōseki liked or disliked the Chinese people is not a productive scholarly enterprise. We can marshall enough citations of his admiration of the Chinese to combat the view that he held seriously condescending views. His travel account has important literary and historical value only if we accept his personal agenda to describe the people and their lives as realistically as he saw them. Whatever faults his work might have, it surely lacked neither for a sense of reality nor for an ability to convey that reality to the reader.</p>
<p>In late 1918, a young Tanizaki Jun’ichirō (1886–1965) traveled to China for the first time. As we know from his later travel account, he had wanted to meet with young Chinese writers in Peking or Shanghai, but he lacked the necessary connections at the time and ultimately was unable to do so. From this trip he left a number of rich descriptions of local nature, customs, foods, and clothing.20 When he returned in 1926, the Chinese political and literary scene 17  Ara Masahito 荒正人, Natsume Sōseki (Jitsugyō no Nihon sha, 1967), p. 133.</p>

<p>Japanese Literary Travelers In Prewar China 525</p>
<p>had changed so thoroughly as to offer a now famous Tanizaki a wholly different experience.</p>
<p>In the same year as Tanizaki’s first trip to China, the haiku poet Kawahigashi Hekigotō 河東碧梧桐 (1873–1937) alighted at the older port of Japanese entry, Ningpo. His travel account provides striking proof for the assertion that a lifetime of immersion in Kanji culture did not necessarily lead Japanese to illuminating conclusions about China. He began (in an effort to attach himself to a tradition of sorts) by saying that Ningpo was the first point at which Japanese visitors in the T’ang dynasty had touched Chinese soil. After visiting Ningpo, he came to the startling conclusion that the world had really changed since the T’ang, Sung, and Ming dynasties. Now, Shanghai was the city with an imported civilization, while the Ningpo of old had become an exported civilization (presumably to Japan). The Ningpoese, he claimed, were ashamed of the situation in Shanghai, although it is unclear what any of this means. Harping on this T’ang connection, he pointed out that, whereas at that time Japanese intellectuals had been smitten with Sinophilia, now Japanese students were embarrassed by the difficulty of their own mother tongue and by the fact that they were not born Englishmen: “This is a symptom of an illness accompanying the importation of foreign civilization.” And, no sooner had he finally come to a point than he undercut himself by claiming that art knew no national boundaries, and for that reason earlier Japanese had excelled in the writing of Chinese-style poetry and prose.21</p>
<p>A more interesting account is that of Ōmachi Keigetsu 大町桂月 (1869–</p>
<p>1925), a poet and literary scholar. He described Chilin, where he arrived in the winter of 1918–19, as breathtakingly beautiful, warranting its reputation as the “Kyoto of Manchuria,” one of a number of recurring expressions aimed at familiarizing a place by nativizing it. There is not even the hint of an imperial-istic tone here. Since Kyoto, especially in winter, was revered by Japanese as the quintessence of beauty, this was extremely high (perhaps exaggerated) praise for Chilin. For every sight Ōmachi visited in the Northeast, he had a Japanese</p>

<p>guide, either an SMR official on the scene or a local representative of a Japanese company. From this point forward, many a Japanese literary personality was led around in Manchuria; though not necessarily shielded, their presence was known and appreciated. They often traveled at the invitation and expense of the SMR, something that Sōseki had pioneered. Ōmachi described in great geographical detail the area around Port Arthur, scene of bloody fighting during the war with Russia, and he relived some of those battles with lengthy quotations from officers of that time. This was not in the least a jingoistic chronicle.</p>
<p>The message is clear in the way only someone trained to write can make it: war is a horror to all sides involved.22</p>
<p>Two artists who journeyed to China in the second decade of the twentieth century had rather different recollections. Toriya Matazō 鳥谷又蔵 traveled to many Chinese cities over four months in early 1913 and left a diary and a series of 115 “stray notes” about his experiences. His general impression was of a disunited, filthy, egotistic country full of coolies, beggars, and starving people whose faces resembled those of animals.23</p>
<p>Ishii Hakutei 石井柏亭 (1882–1958) displayed somewhat more understanding, even though the period he spent in China, April and May 1919, turned out to be considerably more chaotic, especially for a Japanese. After describing the downtown area of Shanghai with its stores, people, and the concession area, he went to visit the Japanese author Inoue Kōbai 井上紅梅 (1881–?) who had taken up residence there. Together they paid a call on the Chinese writer Ouyang Yü-ch’ien 欧陽予倩 (1889–1962) who showed them his art collection and took them on a tour of an art school in Shanghai. Ishii in turn agreed to give a talk through a translator at the Kiangsu Educational Society. When the Shantung issue erupted in early May and Japan was being vilified in the press and on the streets, Ishii naturally became uneasy. He witnessed shops being forced to close and placards warning against the sale of Japanese goods.</p>
<p>When the coolies, dockworkers, and railwaymen went on strike, Ishii resolved to remain indoors and concentrate on his painting. Throughout this intensely anti-Japanese period, though, he had nothing derogatory to say about the Chinese. And, when Ts’ao Ju-lin 曹汝霖 (1876–1966) and his “pro-Japanese”</p>
<p>contingent were removed from the Peking government, Ishii noted that the anti-Japanese movement seemed to die down.24</p>

<p>Japanese Literary Travelers In Prewar China 527</p>
<p>From late March through early July 1921, the Ōsaka mainichi shinbun sent a special reporter to do a series of articles on cultural life in China’s major cities.</p>
<p>The reporter, Akutagawa Ryūnosuke (1892–1927), was not yet thirty years of age but had already achieved tremendous popularity as a writer of fiction in Japan.</p>
<p>The newspaper widely publicized the trip, and he was doted on by Japanese he met all along the way. In fact, his installments were carried in the Japanese-language press in China as well, making the whole journey a literary event.</p>
<p>The Ōsaka mainichi was interested in where and how China’s ancient culture confronted the rise of new ideas, new political concerns, and new ways generally, in the midst of what we now call the May Fourth Movement. Akutagawa was charged with interviewing a number of major Chinese figures in the hope of getting some answers to these questions.</p>
<p>In Shanghai he met Chang Ping-lin 章炳麟 (1869–1936) at the latter’s home.</p>
<p>Chang became agitated as he talked about politics to his guest, and Akutagawa chose to let his host go on as he pleased rather than try to guide the conversation. To this Chang was completely amenable:</p>
<p>I’m sad to say that contemporary China is politically depraved. You might say that since the last years of the Ch’ing dynasty the spread of injustice has reached immense proportions. In scholarship and the arts there has been an unusual stagnation. The Chinese people, however, do not by nature run to extremes. Insofar as they possess this quality, Chinese Communism is impossible. Of course, one segment of the students welcomes Soviet principles, but the students are not the populace. Even if the people were to become Communist, a time would come at some point when they would dispense with this belief. The reason is that our national character—love for the Golden Mean—is stronger than any temporarily flared enthusiasm.25</p>
<p>The Chinese Communist Party held its first national congress the very month this conversation took place and in the same city; and yet, obvious contradictions aside, one senses more than a kernel of truth in what Chang predicted.</p>
<p>25  Akutagawa Ryūnosuke, “Shanhai yūki,” in Akutagawa Ryūnosuke zenshū (Iwanami shoten, 1977–78) [hereafter, ARZ], 5:28–29.

It should be noted that Akutagawa’s is the only report we have of this exchange, as Chang left no account of their meeting.</p>
<p>528</p>
<p>Japanese Literary Travelers in Prewar China</p>
<p>Akutagawa had a quieter exchange with Cheng Hsiao-hsü 鄭孝胥 (1859–</p>
<p>1938). Cheng had been active in the 1898 Reform Movement, and Akutagawa described him as a former official of the Ch’ing, now a private scholar. Their discussion ranged over issues of concern to China broadly. Cheng despaired over the rampant chaos throughout Republican China, and he posited the return to stability should a kingly form of state be implemented and a hero emerge to run it. Despite Cheng’s profound conservatism, Akutagawa thoroughly enjoyed meeting him, his warm hospitality, and his wide learning.26 Several years later Cheng became Prime Minister in the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo.</p>
<p>The third interviewee in Shanghai was a socialist by the name of Li Jen-chieh 李人傑, whom Akutagawa considered a representative of “young China,” the new voices contesting the old cultural and political forces. Fluent in Japanese by virtue of a period of study in Tokyo, Li explained that neither the Republic nor reversion to any past provided the solution to China’s problems. Political revolution had proven ineffective throughout Chinese history; what China needed and what the “young Chinese” advocated was a social revolution and a cultural movement.27</p>
<p>These three interviews constituted Akutagawa’s intellectual contacts in Shanghai—a conservative (Cheng), a radical (Li), and a conservative radical (Chang). Akutagawa must have chosen his subjects, or the material to include in his account, to fit this neat pattern and convey at least a sense that the entire spectrum of responses to China’s present state was to be found in the intellectual world of Shanghai alone. One cannot forget that he was an artist crafting his work for the press and his public.</p>
<p>In addition, Akutagawa as a novelist provided his readers with penetrating descriptions of life in China’s urban areas. Although enthralled by the elegance and beauty of Peking—“I could live here for two or three years. . . . I’ve fallen in love with it”—he was shocked by ubiquitous beggars and the stench of urine in the streets of Shanghai and elsewhere. The filth, particularly for a man ailing with pleurisy at the time, occasionally became unbearable. In a letter from Shanghai he noted: “The specialities of this place are new ideas and typhoid.”</p>
<p>In fact, Shanghai “was more Western than Chinese.” Despite his initial sympathy for the “young China” types with their enthusiasm and idealism, the street scenes he depicted were of a China here and now mired in a deeply depressing reality.28 Although one might argue that Akutagawa tailored his account to the 26   ARZ 5:34–36.</p>

<p>needs of the press, his descriptions are still moving, and the change he underwent while traveling in China (from hoping to find a combination of new and old to a sadness at China’s confused and perilous state) seems utterly sincere.</p>
<p>Akutagawa did many other things in China as well: attending a Peking opera performance by the renowned singer Mei Lan-fang 梅蘭芳 (1894–1961); visiting the grave of the woman revolutionary Ch’iu Chin 秋瑾 (1867–1907) in Shao-hsing and a temple built in honor of the Sung general Yüeh Fei 岳飛 (1103–41) in Hangchow; and often parading around in full Chinese dress, a practice begun by earlier travelers to China such as Okakura Tenshin (1862–1913) at the end of the nineteenth century.29</p>
<p>In late 1925 or 1926, the year before his suicide, Akutagawa published a short story entitled “Konan no ōgi” 湖南の扇 (The folding fan of Hunan). It began: Aside from Sun Yat-sen who was born in Kwangtung, the outstanding Chinese revolutionaries—Huang Hsing 黄興, Ts’ai O 蔡鍔, and Sung Chiao-jen 宋教仁—were all born in Hunan. This was of course due to the inspiration of Tseng Kuofan 曾国藩 and Chang Chih-tung 張之洞.</p>
<p>To explain this inspiration, we must consider the indefatigably strong will of the Hunanese people themselves. When I visited Hunan [several years ago], I had an almost fictional encounter which may illustrate the dignity and deep passion of the Hunanese.</p>
<p>Akutagawa’s storyteller, a Japanese doctor, goes on to describe his trip to Changsha, capital of Hunan, where he meets his former Tokyo University classmate T’an Yung-nien 譚永年 (literally, “eternal T’an,” perhaps a reference to the Hunanese martyr T’an Ssut’ung [1865–98] and hence to all Hunanese or the undying spirit of reform in China). In Changsha, they meet one Yü Lan 玉蘭, the lover of a “bandit” (which clearly means a rebel in this context) executed just a few days earlier. T’an offers the narrator some biscuits that have been soaked in the blood of this fallen hero, saying that if he eats them, he will never become ill. No one can stomach such borderline cannibalism except Yü Lan.30</p>

<p>This story speaks directly to the enduring admiration Akutagawa had both for the Chinese who were intent on changing their dismal state and for such courageous Chinese women.</p>
<p>One of the most fascinating cultural encounters between Chinese and Japanese belletrists occurred during Tanizaki Jun’ichirō’s second visit to China in January–February 1926. In order to set his experiences in Shanghai in context, we need to go back several years to 1913, when the young Christian Uchiyama Kanzō 内山完造 (1885–1959) arrived in China. After working for several years, he opened his own bookstore in Shanghai, Uchiyama Shoten, carrying primarily Japanese volumes; as it expanded, it simultaneously became a center for discussions among Chinese and Japanese intellectuals. Uchiyama himself became something of a mediator or broker of Sino-Japanese cultural contacts and was deeply respected by all who knew him. His own diary account contains the following entry (although mistakenly placed in 1921, this should be 1926): “Tanizaki Jun’ichirō arrived. He said he wanted to meet some Chinese authors, and asked me to introduce him. So, I invited Kuo Mo-jo 郭沫若, T’ien Han 田漢, Ou-yang Yü-ch’ien, T’ang Lin 唐林, Hsieh Liu-i 謝六逸 . . . and others to the second storey of my place for a meeting. I ordered some first-rate vegetarian cuisine to be served.”31</p>
<p>Remembering well his 1918 failures, Tanizaki had been informed that if he wanted to meet Chinese writers he should go directly to Uchiyama’s store and introduce himself (he was, after all, a celebrated author now). “I was told that apart from Manchuria this bookstore has the largest collection of Japanese books in all China,” he noted with the interesting passing admission that Manchuria belonged to China. “One-fourth of the store’s sales go to Chinese customers, and the percentage increases every year. The Chinese buy any and every sort of book available. Philosophy, science, law, literature, religion, art—</p>
<p>new learning in contemporary China has largely been gained through books in the Japanese language.”32 Tanizaki was particularly impressed with the great interest taken in Japanese literature by Chinese intellectuals. He learned of Chou Tso-jen’s 周作人 (1885–1960) translations of contemporary Japanese fiction, T’ien Han’s (1898–1966) of Japanese drama, and Hsieh Liu-i’s (1900–45) of the Manyōshū and The Tale of Genji.</p>
<p>31  Uchiyama Kanzō, Kakōroku (Iwanami shoten, 1961), p. 122. Ozawa Masamoto (in Ozawa Masamoto, Uchiyama Kanzō den, p. 83) says that their meeting occurred in 1923. Both he and Uchiyama are wrong—internal evidence and the publication of Tanizaki’s account corroborate his dating the event to 1926.</p>

<p>Tanizaki’s beautifully written description of his meetings with Kuo Mo-jo (1892–1978), T’ien Han, and others, and the wild party thrown by them in his honor is an invaluable (and altogether neglected) document for the study of Chinese literary history. Only an outsider of Tanizaki’s stature, perhaps only a Japanese writer, could have brought Hsieh, T’ien, and such an unusual assortment of people together at this time. By the same token, his arrival on the scene facilitated this first meeting between Kuo and Hsieh. Kuo was in the midst of an acrimonious debate with Lu Hsün’s group based in Peking, and Lu’s name never appears in Tanizaki’s record of his talks in Shanghai. The month after Tanizaki returned to Japan, Kuo announced in the pages of the literary journal of the Creation Society that their slogan “literary revolution” was now to be changed to “revolutionary literature.” Thus, the meeting with Tanizaki undoubtedly occurred at a time of great tension for Kuo as well.</p>
<p>Tanizaki found that most of the Chinese he met conversed fluently in Japanese. His first discussion at Uchiyama’s bookstore brought together Hsieh, Kuo, T’ien, Ou-yang, and several others. After pleasantries, Tanizaki broke the ice by asking about the Japanese literary works he had heard were being translated into Chinese. The Chinese pointed out that many had appeared in Chinese editions and agreed to help him collect as many as possible, but they were most troubled by the level of their own literary compositions. Ou-yang was looking forward to becoming active in film work, and apparently his company had invited T’ien Han to write a script. He even agreed to introduce Tanizaki to his company and the actresses, although all had little good to say of the state of Chinese cinema. Little in the way of politics intruded into the evening.33</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, Tanizaki met with Kuo and T’ien for a walk. They conveyed their criticisms, with which Tanizaki agreed, of contemporary Japanese authors, and exchanged ideas on the art of translation. Upon returning to Tanizaki’s hotel, a little Shao-hsing wine livened up the discussion. All lamented the poor economic state of China, particularly her rural masses, and all were prepared to lay the blame squarely on the detrimental effects of the intervention of foreign capital. When Tanizaki tried to console them with the view that the same situation had once existed in Japan, Kuo assumed a more argumentative tone. China and Japan, he claimed, were fundamentally incomparable because China was not an independent country. Japan might borrow money to use as it saw fit. In China, foreigners acted as they pleased without the least regard for Chinese interests.</p>
<p>33   TJZ 10:566–67, 569–76.</p>
<p>532</p>
<p>Japanese Literary Travelers in Prewar China</p>
<p>Even if the Chinese were beaten politically, Tanizaki protested, they had often proven their inordinate economic acumen. Many times China had been conquered, but the Chinese people never perished. It was the conquerors who ultimately were conquered by Chinese culture and “melted into the Chinese crucible.” Kuo was not consoled, for past conquerors had all been peoples with lower cultural levels than the Chinese; they had been mesmerized by Chinese civilization. For the first time in history, China confronted a people with a</p>
<p>“higher” cultural level. In addition, they were giving money and weapons to the warlords while building themselves neutral zones (Concessions), and the result was incessant warfare. Kuo noted one side effect of the wholesale imperialist intrusion: “There probably hasn’t been an instance when the concept of nation so penetrated the general mind as it has [in China] today.” Tanizaki expressed a kind of amazed sadness, to which T’ien Han added that Chinese writers usually had no significant amount of money to contribute to the anti-imperialist cause, but they could appeal to the people of the world through poetry, fiction, and the force of art.34</p>
<p>Tanizaki’s description of his last encounter with the Chinese literary world is itself a minor literary masterpiece.35 The co-chairmen of the Shanghai Literary Winter Endurance Society, Ou-yang Yü-ch’ien and T’ien Han, called a banquet in his honor. Novelists, poets, artists, calligraphers, musicians, entertainers from as far away as Peking, film directors, actresses, and others in the movie business were all invited. Tanizaki suggested something a bit less ostentatious and raucous, but T’ien would hear none of it. Upon arriving at his own party, Tanizaki was introduced to each of the twenty or thirty guests already there: a violinist, an aviator recently returned from France, a master swordsman, an itinerant poet, a cameramen, a painter, and many others. He was then hustled off to a side room for the women, including famous actresses, wives and sisters of the men next door, and a number of well-known poets and calligraphers. In all some ninety people attended.</p>
<p>Tanizaki’s depiction of the event becomes murkier as the night proceeds, just as his own drunkenness, that of his hosts, and the clouds of cigarette smoke in the restaurant obscured clearer vision. We meet countless people introducing themselves to Tanizaki in countless ways, the master swordsman putting on a hair-raising demonstration, a short violin concert, questions about the great Kantō earthquake of 1923, singing to the accompaniment of a small Chinese orchestra, a performance on the ch’in ( koto), more and more guests arriving, and all the time gigantic quantities of alcohol being consumed.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, T’ien Han rose to his feet, somehow got everyone’s attention, and delivered a long speech welcoming the guest of honor.</p>
<p>All having gulped their Shao-hsing wine in the Chinese toasting fashion, someone shouted: “The Japanese shall now favor us with a hidden talent, for we cannot have only Chinese doing this!” Before Tanizaki had time even to blush, Ou-yang stepped in and sang a song in falsetto. Tsukamoto Suketarō</p>
<p>塚本助太郎, one of Tanizaki’s two Japanese friends in attendance, responded to the request for a purely Japanese tune with a nō chant. At this point, there was no delaying Tanizaki’s own performance. Kuo Mo-jo leapt from his seat to lead the audience’s anticipatory clapping. A speech was accepted in place of an act, and Kuo agreed to interpret. Apologizing for his musical inabilities, Tanizaki delivered the following address:</p>
<p>A new artistic movement is thriving in China today. A novelist from your neighboring land, I could never have imagined holding such an enormous gathering. I truly thank you. Moreover, tonight’s meeting is an assemblage of simple young people without any ceremoniousness—an atmosphere of genuine, purposeful freedom. When I was a young man, I too planned with up-and-coming writers to hold gatherings like this one. Looking on this evening’s [festivities], I am reminded more and more of those times, and I am full of emotion. I’m not that old yet. (Laughter erupted at this point before the interpreter could translate.) No one in the Japanese literary world thinks that I deserve such a reception. When I return home and relate my travel experiences, my colleagues will undoubtedly be very surprised. Not only as an individual but as a representative of the Japanese literary world, I want to express my deepest gratitude. Japanese writers are also divided into many cliques, and I’ll probably take a thrashing for speaking as a “representative” of them. So, let me just thank you as an individual.36</p>
<p>A drunken Kuo Mo-jo drove him home late that night in a speedy and altogether reckless manner. Tanizaki awoke the next morning with a hangover unparalleled, he claimed, throughout the previous decade of his life. The whole affair had been a thorough success for all concerned. Tanizaki had met the cream of the Chinese artistic and literary scene in Shanghai, especially in the fields of writing and film. And, Kuo Mo-jo, T’ien Han, and Ou-yang Yü-ch’ien had all used their contacts with him to enhance their own positions within their respective spheres of the Chinese literary world.</p>
<p>36   TJZ 10:590–91.</p>
<p>534</p>
<p>Japanese Literary Travelers in Prewar China</p>
<p>It was actually Tanizaki who introduced Uchiyama to the poet and novelist Satō Haruo 佐藤春夫 (1892–1964) on the latter’s second visit to China the next year (1927). Satō felt a close personal connection both to Akutagawa and Tanizaki. “I am often struck by the feeling,” he once wrote, “that if Jun’ichirō</p>
<p>had not lived, I would have had no literary career.”37 Of the three men, Satō was the most deeply interested and best trained in Chinese literature and culture.</p>
<p>He translated a number of works from Chinese, including Lu Hsün’s The True Story of Ah Q.38 Satō traveled three times to China, in 1920, 1927, and 1938, and each time left a record.</p>
<p>Satō’s first trip of 1920 took him to Taiwan and South China, especially in and around Amoy. He had the opportunity there to meet the enlightened militarist Ch’en Chiung-ming 陳炯明, and he described in detail Ch’en’s accomplishments. In 1925 he wrote a bizarre story which drew on his experiences in Taiwan.39 He returned to China in 1927, first to Nanking, where he met his friend and guide—T’ien Han. They apparently had met earlier in Japan. At the time, just a year after Tanizaki’s festive visit, T’ien was preparing scripts for propaganda films for the Nanking regime. T’ien promised Satō a meeting with Chiang Kai-shek (1887–1975), but the Generalissimo was not taking visitors, least of all those from Japan it seemed. Everyone in Chiang’s immediate circle spoke excellent Japanese, according to Satō, as he relayed the widespread and bitingly sarcastic rumor that secret sessions of the Nanking government were conducted in Japanese. Satō recalled a number of frightening adventures he embarked on with T’ien, sneaking around the military police to visit forbidden historical sights, and he remembered T’ien’s incessant fighting with his wife, which had something to do with the women on the sets of his films.40</p>
<p>Satō then continued to Hangchow where he acquired a new guide, another old friend, the writer Yü Ta-fu 郁達夫 (1896–1945). His account here is most interesting for its depiction of his literary host; no sooner had Satō arrived than Yü dropped him off at a hotel and scurried off to a rendezvous with a girlfriend. At one point Yü took him to a local restaurant where he repeatedly banged his fist on the table and yelled at the waiters. He then explained to 37  Cited in Nakamura Shintarō, Nihon to Chūgoku, 2:714.</p>

<p>a shocked Satō: “If you don’t do this, these guys won’t treat you properly as a customer. . . . Hong Kong and Canton are just the opposite, and Foochow’s also different. . . . They wouldn’t behave this way in an open port like Shanghai either.”41 Like Tanizaki’s account, Satō’s travel reports typify one of the great values of this entire genre of material, the personal insights it offers of famous Chinese intellectuals, material often difficult to come by. Unfortunately, Satō</p>
<p>did not describe his meeting with Lu Hsün in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The novelist Muramatsu Shōfū (1889–1961) left several volumes detailing his travels to China’s major cities, particularly in the North. His first and major work of this genre, Shin Shina hōmonki (Record of a Visit to the New China), described his November 1928 trip. He had traveled to China several times previously, and this volume perceptively analyzed the changes he observed, especially in the areas unified by the KMT (his “new China”). He stressed that understanding Nanking, the new capital, was the key to understanding China.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of his book catalogued the many changes the KMT had brought to the city and the problems left to be faced in its reconstruction plan. This was not KMT propaganda, though, as Muramatsu quoted the complaints of the local residents, often in the form of popular ditties.42 The KMT had grandiose plans, some of which had begun to be carried out in earnest, but the leaders seemed devoted only to personal enjoyment. With the evocative power of a novelist, Muramatsu brilliantly depicted their easy life in Shanghai: greyhound races, gambling parlors, dance halls, the latest clothing fashions, and the like.43</p>
<p>Muramatsu traveled to Manchuria in the early summer of 1933 and described in great detail two sights in the Jehol capital of Ch’eng-te: the Summer Palace built by the K’ang-hsi Emperor and the Pa-ta Lama Temple. Although both struck him as spectacular, both were also in states of disrepair, significant commentary on a once great civilization now in decline. He took an especially 41  Satō Haruo, Shina zakki, in SKBZ 11:289–92; and Takeuchi Yoshimi 竹内好, “Satō Haruo sensei to Pekin,” in Takeuchi Yoshimi, Nihon to Chūgoku no aida (Bungei shunjū, 1973), pp. 227–30.</p>

In 1927 Muramatsu published a novel set in China, entitled Shanhai (Sōjinsha). The following year Yokomitsu Riichi visited Shanghai and began a novel, which was to become considerably more famous, by the same title. See note 52</p>

<p>interesting look at the half-farmer and half-monk daily lives of the Lamaist monks. Traveling by an unorthodox route from Ch’eng-te to Peking, Muramatsu ran into fighting between Chinese and Japanese troops, and with no Japanese soldiers to protect him he feared capture by “bandits.” This real-life adventure concluded with his safe arrival in Peking.44</p>
<p>One of the great events in the writing of literary travel accounts was the publication of Yosano Akiko’s 与謝野晶子 (1878–1942) Man-Mō yūki (Record of a Voyage to Manchuria and Mongolia). Yosano was a prolific poet and translator into modern Japanese of classical Japanese literature. In 1928 she accepted an invitation from the SMR to visit Manchuria and Mongolia. She also chose to make the trip because, in her words, “the smooth handling of contacts between” China and “Japan [necessitated] one’s understanding the natural and social life there and one’s comprehension of [the Chinese people’s] feelings and emotions.”45</p>
<p>Accordingly, Yosano’s account consciously sought to make sense of what she was seeing and hearing. She visited factories, hospitals, agricultural stations, a prison, and an opium den, for example. Her general image of the Chinese was a positive one: a physically powerful working class who labored hard and silently, and an industrious merchant group working on a narrow margin of profit. She was equally severe in her evaluation of the Japanese residents in China. She resented their air of superiority and their blissful ignorance of Chinese customs and sensibilities. Of the anti-Japanese movement she had an opportunity to witness, Yosano wrote: “It’s surely frightful from the imperialists’ point of view, but for the Chinese people it must be celebrated in the name of humanity.”</p>
<p>While staying at the Yamato Hotel in Fengtien, one of a chain owned by the SMR, she and her husband were awakened one morning at dawn by a loud blast. It took them several days to sort out all that had occurred, but what they had heard was the explosion of Chang Tso-lin’s 張作霖 last train ride. This led to the massive transport of Japanese troops from Korea, and the atmosphere of growing militarization dampened their spirits. She painfully concluded: “My heart is saddened by the thought that in the end the world may isolate Japan.”46</p>

<p>Japanese Literary Travelers In Prewar China 537</p>
<p>Aside from these insights into the future, Yosano’s daily observations and the respect with which she approached the subject (China and the Chinese) were superior in the travel account genre. Well educated in classical Chinese literature and culture, she, like many travelers to China, adorned her descriptions of every sight visited with its history in literature and the arts. She offered, for example, a rich description of a Buddhist temple for women worshippers in Manchuria. She also stayed at an active Taoist temple for several days to observe the monks in their daily routines, and her descriptions would still be of value to anthropologists.</p>
<p>When she learned that Peking would be impossible to visit in peace, because of the Northern Expedition, she decided to head toward northern Manchuria.</p>
<p>From the train window, she provided descriptions of the countryside, crops, ethnic groups living in the various regions and their customs, religious sights, several rural markets, and a rural theater. Her favorite place on this leg of the voyage was Harbin (often referred to with an intriguing appositional phrase, the “Paris of the East,” by many writers who had never visited the City of Lights itself), because of its wide tree-lined boulevards, European flavor, and the vast beauty of the Sungari River.</p>
<p>One unique aspect of her travel account was her description of meetings with the wives of Japanese living in Manchuria and with the wives of Chinese who entertained her party. The wife of one local militarist made a deep impression on Yosano when they met in Chichihar. She learned one week later that this woman had been killed aboard Chang Tso-lin’s ill-fated train.47</p>
<p>Like so many travelers to China in the prewar period (and the postwar period as well), Yosano was struck by how hard Chinese laborers (particularly coolies) worked. Unlike any other traveler, though, she also noted with equal astonishment how little those same workers ate to sustain such a difficult life; and she reported on just what she observed them eating, as well as how much such items cost in the Chinese markets, and talked to some of them about it.48</p>
<p>Yosano’s account is far richer than these few paragraphs can convey; it marks a high point not only in literary travel reportage but in the entire genre.</p>
<p>Later in 1928 Hasegawa Nyozekan 長谷川如是閑 (1875–1969) visited Harbin and left an account of considerably less interest, except perhaps to students of Hasegawa. Here China and Manchuria have been transformed into figurative extensions of the traveler’s ego, indicating a troubling shift in the tone of literary travel writing itself. Every experience seems to have required a personal reflection on Hasegawa’s part, in the expectation that the reader truly cared.</p>

<p>Japanese Literary Travelers in Prewar China</p>
<p>Staying at Harbin’s finest hotel, the Hôtel Moderne, Hasegawa felt the need to report that he craved a bath and that “moderne” applied only to the price of the room; he followed with a list of complaints. We also are subjected as readers to the traveler’s every passing thought transferred into print.49</p>
<p>When the writer Hayashi Fumiko 林芙美子 (1904–51) got off the train in Harbin in 1930, she looked in vain for another Japanese face. A Chinese called out to her in pidgin Russian: “Yaponski madam.” She responded in the same language: “Yaponski hoteru,” and off they went to a Japanese-owned hotel in the Russian quarter. Conversant in standard Russian as well, Hayashi met a number of Russian women in Harbin who introduced her to the poorer sections of town, and she described them in some detail. She was especially impressed by the beauty of the various places of religious worship, Russian Orthodox, Muslim, Jewish, and Christian.50</p>
<p>Finally, Satomi Ton 里見弴 (1888–1983), writer and younger brother of the famous novelist Arishima Takeo 有島武郎 (1878–1923), traveled through China and Manchuria (21 December 1929 to 1 February 1930) with the prominent writer Shiga Naoya, on an invitation from the SMR. Shiga wrote not a word about this trip, but Satomi left a lively, crisp account full of marvelous vignettes and descriptions from the lives of the people he saw, aside from one moronic remark about the Jewish store owner who sold him a wool coat. Yet, despite his eye for detail and ear for interesting stories, this whole account reads as though China was an extension of either Satomi’s self-gratification or his ennui. It enjoyed no independent existence. As with so many authors of travel accounts, at every place he visited Satomi made a point of noting which Japanese authors had preceded him there, for it seemed to add something of significance to his own account even as he was writing it. He also offered a long description of the pleasure quarters in Peking, in which he spent a goodly amount of time and money.51</p>
<p>Travel accounts by Japanese poets and novelists have not attracted anything remotely approaching the attention their fictional or poetic writings have.</p>
<p>Often their trip reports, as in the case of Satomi Ton, are not even included in their “collected” works; in other cases, most notably that of Natsume Sōseki, the trip report is considered a poor effort rarely noted by critics. Nonetheless, 49  Hasegawa Nyozekan, “Harupin chokkō,” in SKBZ 11:346–49, 356; and Yosano Akiko, in SKBZ 11:330.</p>

<p>it is more than worthy of attention to scholars of modern Chinese history, culture, and literature, to say nothing of its interest as a reflection of Japanese views of China. And, it is primary material for scholars of Sino-Japanese relations. The detailed descriptions of people and places, through the penetrating eyes of men and women trained and paid for their abilities as writers, are second to none as firsthand accounts of China. While occasionally excessive in the quantity of ego these writers allowed themselves to invest in their subjects, they nonetheless show little sign of the firm nationalism present in the travel literature of people from other professions.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was precisely because literary types fancied themselves above the humdrum daily existence of mere human beings or alienated from the scene in Japan that they were able to transcend the fierce nationalism of their compatriots and, in certain cases, be sympathetic to Chinese opposition to Japanese imperialism. Some, like Yokomitsu Riichi, who visited Shanghai in 1928, wrote fiction set in China that was extremely sympathetic to the Chinese revolutionary cause. The remarkable comparison with André Malraux (1901–76) has often been noted.52</p>
<p>Japanese began traveling everywhere in the world from the turn of the century. China, though, then (as now) held special attraction for the Japanese way-farer of any bent, literary or otherwise. Not only was China closer and more convenient for travel, and not only did a good education in the Chinese classics facilitate communication and understanding. China also occupied an alluring place in the consciousness of all literate Japanese for obvious historical and cultural reasons. Travel there for the well-educated Japanese involved a kind of “return” to a place they had never physically been. In this respect, they were wholly different from someone like Evelyn Waugh. For all his often trenchant perceptiveness, Waugh could rarely muster more than a blasé cynicism for the lands and peoples he visited, and he rarely was able to suppress his outrageous racism. The appeal of China for Japanese literary travelers is more closely approximated by that of India for V.S. Naipaul in An Area of Darkness or that of Israel for Saul Bellow in To Jerusalem and Back: the former, bitingly critical,</p>

<p>Just at the time that Japanese travel to China became possible, both countries were beginning reform programs, and every literary visitor was well aware of this process in China. Their accounts often addressed the issue of “changing China” or “revolution” (ongoing or desperately needed). They also frequently noted how difficult transforming a nation of China’s size and age would be.</p>
<p>The crucial point is that “change” became the agenda, both because of efforts witnessed in China and because the Meiji reform program in Japan seemed to provide a model (a mission, in some minds) for the Chinese.</p>
<p>Unlike other groups of travelers to China, novelists and poets were less inclined to make wholesale generalizations about the national character of the Chinese people, or to offer policy suggestions to the Japanese government or military. This disinclination to meaningless, sweeping statements concerning the “nature of the Chinese” owes much to the current of realism in Japanese reportage literature as well as to a genuine and apparent sensitivity to China’s real predicament. The aversion to proffering advice to state planners back home speaks more directly to the literary calling and a more widespread dislike among writers for the authoritarian state.</p>
<p>What a given traveler saw or chose to describe was never simply a function of 20-20 vision. Some visitors to China walked right by sprawling slums and made no mention of them in their accounts. Others focused on the poverty and filth of China, seeing it as a symbol of her present destitution and future destiny. And, a few were able to recognize positive and negative features of life in contemporary China, often better than even Chinese themselves. Few travelers were driven to the despair of Lu Hsün in depicting the history of modern China as that of cannibalism. By the same token, had any Japanese voyager made such a radical assessment of twentieth-century China, it would have seemed rudely out of place.54</p>
<p>A sense of distance had to remain between China as an object of observation and the Japanese observer. The great British travel writer of the interwar years, Robert Byron, noted in a similar vein:</p>
<p>53  V.S. Naipaul, An Area of Darkness (London: A. Deutsch, 1964); and Saul Bellow, To Jerusalem and Back: A Personal Account (New York: Avon Books, 1964).</p>
<p>54  The eminent Sinologist Kuwabara Jitsuzō 桑原隲蔵 (1879–1931), who was by no means a Sinophile, published an article on the history of cannibalism in China just at the time that the May Fourth Movement was raging: “Shina no shokujinniku no fūshū,” Taiyō 25.7</p>
<p>(1919): 121–24. Although the piece made not a single reference to contemporary China, he violated the unwritten sense of distance and has been vilified for this essay ever since.</p>
<p>Japanese Literary Travelers In Prewar China 541</p>
<p>To travel in Europe is to assume a foreseen inheritance; in Islam, to inspect that of a close and familiar cousin. But to travel in farther Asia is to discover a novelty previously unsuspected and unimaginable. It is not a question of probing this novelty, of analyzing its sociological, artistic, or religious origins, but of learning, simply, that it exists. Suddenly, as it were in the opening of an eye, the potential world—the field of man and his environment—is doubly extended. The stimulus is inconceivable to those who have not experienced it.55</p>
<p>For Japanese travelers, China was more like Europe in Byron’s metaphorical sense. It was the bearer of “a foreseen inheritance,” not “unsuspected and unimaginable” in the least.</p>
<p>Yet, regardless of one’s political perspective and regardless of the great cultural debt Japan owed to China, China was not the same as Japan. The Chinese and their ways of life were objects of observation, not of identity, despite the continual use of references from home to make sense of what was being observed, a condition endemic to all travel writing. This effort—as we have noted in the cases of Ōmachi Keigetsu, Satō Haruo, and many others—to make a place seem familiar, to use language borrowed from home or some previous Japanese traveler to the same place may be understood, borrowing Mircea Eliade’s terms, as an effort to sanctify a “profane” space. If home is “sacred”</p>
<p>space and away from home is “profane,” recognition that a famous fellow national or a friend had stood where one was now standing, identification of a sight with something familiar from home, and repetition of an image popularized by an earlier traveler all aimed at making a “profane” space more like home, more “sacred.”56</p>
<p>Travel literature, like fiction, combined objective observations (sights, customs, local histories, interviews, and the like) with the author’s subjective experiences. They were mutually nourishing literary forms. Too much objectivity could lead to the charge of boredom; too much subjective intrusion might lead to the claim of mendacity. “This tension between the personal and the impersonal, the romantic and the realistic, the fanciful and the useful, is as important in the evolution of travel literature as it is in the evolution of the novel, and to study it in one form is to study it in the other.”57 Or, as Paul Fussell 55  Cited in Paul Fussell, Abroad, p. 92. The citation comes from Byron’s The Road to Oxania, a work Fussell (p. 95) considers the equivalent in the travel book genre to Joyce’s Ulysses among novels and Eliot’s The Waste Land in poetry.</p>

<p>put in his typically flip yet insightful way: “Travel writers actually face the same problem of plausibility that confronts so-called novelists: the actual must be made to appear believable, or it cannot be used. An anomaly must be credited if it’s going to work on the reader.”58 It should not come as too great a surprise that the most penetrating insights into life in China would come from Japanese novelists and poets, men and women trained and paid to depict life around them.</p>
