Masuda Wataru, the author of the text that follows was born in a small fishing village in Shimane prefecture in 1903, the only son of a medical doctor.1 

Excelling at school, he entered Tokyo Imperial University’s Department of Chinese Literature in 1926. It was not a particularly happy time to study there in the immediate aftermath of the Great Kantō Earthquake, and Masuda frequently made use of the Ueno Library at the time. The Faculty of Letters had been completely destroyed, and lectures were often held in makeshift bar-racks or in the operating rooms of the Medical School. He especially recalled enjoying the lectures of Shionoya On on the history of Chinese fiction and Taki Seiichi on East Asian art. He also studied with the great poet Satō Haruo and helped with his translations of Chinese fiction. 

Upon graduation in 1929, he continued his translation work with Satō. Then, in March of 1931, he decided to go to Shanghai where good fortune enabled him to work and study under the great Chinese writer Lu Xun. Lu lectured Masuda on his own writings, allegedly every day, for three hours from March through December. Masuda later composed a biography of Lu Xun which was published serially in the journal Kaizō. He also came to know the Chinese writers Yu Dafu and Zheng Zhenduo at this time, and later Guo Moruo. 

Returning to Japan in December of 1931, he communicated with Lu Xun until just before the latter’s death in 1936. Masuda spent a great deal of time in the 1930s translating Lu’s work, including an edition of his history of Chinese fiction under the title Shina shōsetsu shi \(History of Chinese Fiction\)2 and, 1  Helpful in the preparation of this brief introduction to the life and work of Masuda Wataru were the following two articles: Matsueda Shigeo, ‘Masuda Wataru san no omoide arekore’ 

\(Various memories of Mr. Masuda Wataru\), Bungaku 45 \(May 1977\), 548–52; and Katayama Tomoyuki, ‘Hensha atogaki’ \(Editor’s postface\), in Seigaku tōzen to Chūgoku jijō, ‘zassho’ sakki \(The Eastern Movement of Western Learning and Conditions in China: Notes on ‘Various Books’\) \(Tokyo: Iwanami shoten, 1979\), pp. 351–61.

Introduction: Masuda Wataru and the Study of Modern China

with Satō Haruo, of Ro Jin senshū \(Selected Works of Lu Xun\).3 In October 1934, together with Takeuchi Yoshimi, Takeda Taijun, and Matsueda Shigeo, he helped organize the Chūgoku bungaku kenkyūkai \(Research Group on Chinese Literature\). For the next ten years, he wrote regularly for its organ, Chūgoku bungaku geppō \(Chinese Literature Monthly\). 

In June of 1936 he traveled again to Shanghai to visit Lu Xun on his death-bed. It was this time that he also secured the rights to publish a translation of Mao Dun’s Zi ye \(Midnight\), though he never completed this translation. 

After returning to Japan in July, he was asked later in the year by the Kaizōsha publishing house to oversee the planned publication of Dai Ro Jin zenshū \(The Complete Works of Lu Xun\). He agreed, but left Kaizōsha in March of 1939. 

Although Masuda did not see military action on the mainland during the Sino-Japanese War, he was active nonetheless. In May 1939, he worked for the Kō-A in or Asian Development Board on a project, which took him to Shanghai and Nanjing, investigating contemporary Chinese culture. From April 1940 to March 1942, he taught Chinese literature at Hōsei University. In November 1942 

he went to work for the Dai Tō-A shō \(Greater East Asian Ministry\) on a project similar to that at the Kō-A in earlier. 

After the conclusion of the war, he lectured for a time at Tokyo University in September 1946, taught at Keiō University from April 1947 to March 1949, and worked on and off for the Foreign Ministry. For nearly four years from July 1949 through February 1953, he taught at Shimane University in his home prefecture. The next month he began his longest teaching position at Ōsaka Municipal University which he left fourteen years later in March 1967. Toward the end of this stint, in November 1966, he visited China with a Japanese academic delegation and witnessed the Cultural Revolution in full form. 

He began his last teaching position at Kansai University in April 1967 and retired in March 1974. In January of the following year, the Shanghai wenwu chubanshe published Lu Xun zhi Zengtian She shuxin xuan \(Selection of Letters from Lu Xun to Masuda Wataru\). When his old friend and colleague, Takeuchi Yoshimi, died in early 1977, Masuda was asked to give the funeral eulogy. While delivering his speech, Masuda collapsed and died of a heart attack on the cemetery ground. 

Although his greatest contribution to scholarship was in the field of modern Chinese fiction, especially through translation—Masuda also translated 3  \(Tokyo: Iwanami shoten, 1935\). A fuller edition was published after the war in thirteen volumes: \(Tokyo: Iwanami shoten, 1956, reprinted 1964\). 

Introduction: Masuda Wataru and the Study of Modern China 371

Liaozhai zhiyi \(Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio\)4—still, he will be best remembered for his relationship with and translations of Lu Xun. He later wrote a memoir of his ties to Lu, Ro Jin no inshō \(Impressions of Lu Xun\).5

…

The volume translated here— Seigaku tōzen to Chūgoku jijō, ‘zassho’ sakki \(The Eastern Movement of Western Learning and Conditions in China: Notes on 

‘Various Books’\) \(Tokyo: Iwanami shoten, 1979\)—marked a departure of sorts for Masuda. After many years of collecting books and manuscripts in both China and Japan, he prepared a series of 28 essays serialized in the journal Shohyō \(issues 19–46 inclusive, May 1972–May 1977\). It was the last work he would write, and he may have intended to write more. These represent the first 28 chapters of the volume translated here. The essay on Yamamoto Baigai appeared in Kansai daigaku nenshi kiyō \(no. 2, December 1976\); it was appended to the 28 essays when they were published in 1979. 

The sheer love of books, bibliophilia in the best sense of the term, glistens through the pages of this book. Only someone with a lifetime’s experience collecting and reading such works would have been prepared to devoted the exhaustive energies needed to write such a work. Anyone who continues to doubt the interrelatedness of Chinese and Japanese culture at the textual level is advised to read this fascinating book.

In the process of translating this book, I had occasion to call on friends and colleagues to help in their respective areas of expertise, and I would like to thank them here. My UCSB colleagues, Haruko Iwasaki, Kate Saltzman-Li, and especially Luke Roberts, were exceptionally helpful. Luke pondered many a sōrōbun passage with me until its meaning became clear. My good friend Zhou 4  Initially published in Chūgoku koten bungaku zenshū \(Complete Works of Classical Chinese Literature\) \(Tokyo: Heibonsha, 1959\), volume 22; published separately by Heibonsha in 1963; and reprinted in Chūgoku koten bungaku taikei \(Series on Classical Chinese Literature\) \(Tokyo: Heibonsha, 1979\), volumes 40–41 . 

5  \(Tokyo: Kōdansha, 1948, reprinted 1956\); Chinese translation, Lu Xun de yinxiang, by Zhong Jingwen \(Changsha: Hunan renmin chubanshe, 1980\). Other works by Masuda concerning Lu Xun include: Ro Jin no kotoba \(Lu Xun’s Words\) \(Tokyo: Sōgensha, 1955\); and Ro Jin annai \(A Guide to Lu Xun\) \(Tokyo: Iwanami shoten, 1956\). He also wrote Chūgoku bungaku shi kenkyū, bungaku kakumei to zen’ya no hitobito \(Studies in the History of Chinese Literature: The Literary Revolution and People on Its Eve\) \(Tokyo: Iwanami shoten, 1967\).

Introduction: Masuda Wataru and the Study of Modern China

Qiqian, of the Institute of Japanese Studies, Tianjin Academy of Social Sciences and one of the Chinese translators of this book, pointed out a number of errors or misprints in the original text. Professor Ōba Osamu of Kansai University enabled me to use the Masuda Collection at his university and provided me with a copy of its invaluable catalogue. As the reader will see, I have significantly added to the footnotes publication information absent in the original work; the aim is to make the book more user-friendly in the West.
