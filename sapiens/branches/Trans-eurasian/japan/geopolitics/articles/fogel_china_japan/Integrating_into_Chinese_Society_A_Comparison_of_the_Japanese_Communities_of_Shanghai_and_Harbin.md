title = "Integrating into Chinese Society: A Comparison of the Japanese Communities of Shanghai and Harbin"

+++

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Japanese began settling in what were to become famous as the two most “international” cities in East Asia, Shanghai and Harbin. The Japanese communities that formed in these multicultural metropolises varied widely as they faced different issues and developed within different contexts. Writing in 1933 and 1934, the renowned journalist Edgar Snow cut through the “internationalist” hyperbole and inadvertently shed light on the question of ethnic integration within Shanghai and Harbin. 

Harbin, once delightful, today notorious as a place of living death, the worst-governed city in Manchukuo. 

Probably in no other city of the world is life so precarious. Harbin residents, including the 100,000 White and Red Russians, who here bend to the law of the yellow man, risk their lives if they unarmed anywhere, even in daylight. Holdups, robberies, murders, kidnappings are common occurrences. . . . 

Some of the worst criminals are White Russians. Destitute, broken in spirit, unwilling to return to Russia under the Bolsheviks, unable to earn a living in China under the Japanese, they turn to crime, nourished on a diet of drugs, which are sold openly in shops infesting the city. . . . In Harbin alone there are more than 2000 licensed shops for the sale of opium, heroin and morphine. \(Snow 1934, 81, 84. Emphasis added.\) 

Within Greater Shanghai dwell nearly 3,000,000 people. The vast majority is of course Chinese. The last censors notes list 50 different foreign nationalities with a total of 48,000. . . . To find men of all creeds and colors is not so phenomenal perhaps; New York, Paris, Berlin and Vienna can point to a medley of races. But in Shanghai there is for the most part no mixture; that is the phenomenon. Here, generation after generation, the British have stayed British, the Americans have remained “100 percenters.” 

In Paris the foreigner enjoys learning French; in Berlin he must acquire German; in New York the American dialect is considered essential. But in Shanghai he does not learn Chinese, although it is the language of the city’s 3,000,000, and beyond them, of the hundreds of millions from whom he

hopes, with a little surprise, to extract a few coppers. It is believed that the study of Chinese weakens the fiber of the mind, and the few foreigners who do master the language are pointed out as eccentrics; significant smiles are exchanged behind their backs. . . . 

\[I\]n Shanghai \[the foreigner\] . . . is immune from all but his own consular jurisdiction. . . . Many believe that it is advisable to have as little contact with the Chinese as possible. \(Snow 1933, 173–174; Takatsuna 1995, 98–99\)

Both cities were hailed throughout the early decades of the twentieth century—and they have been so remembered in the memoir literature since—

as the ”Paris of the East,” because of their ”international” \(read European\) flavor. As one Japanese journalist wrote in 1940: “Harbin\! . . . International capital of northern Manchuria amid the swirling eddies of extravagant and romantic adventure, where past and future play a zigzagged symphony. . . . What a wonderful place” \(Tachibana 1940, 264, 266\). Where else in East Asia could one on a daily basis brush shoulders with so many foreigners, dine in foreign restaurants, and shop in foreign stores? In fact, Shanghai and Harbin were probably far more cosmopolitan than Paris at the time. 

The central question I address here is how tie Japanese fit into Shanghai and Harbin, if indeed they tried. What roles did they play in these international communities? How well integrated were they into their economic, social, political, and cultural life? In the period preceding the concerted military invasion of the 1930s, what role did these cities play for the Japanese? Edgar Snow’s words offer a hint. Shanghai was a mosaic world of different ethnicities living side by side but having as little to do with one another as possible, while Harbin was a melting pot, more a city of pioneers whose residents, even the Chinese, were newcomers and mixed far more in good times and bad than in Shanghai. 

I begin with a look at the origins of the two Japanese communities, then  looks at the sorts of occupations Japanese residents of Shanghai and Harbin undertook before examining the communal organization they established in China. 

I focus on the politics of the Japanese communities and their interactions with the surrounding Chinese and conclude by looking at their relations with the Japanese homeland.

**Origins of the Two Japanese Communities**

The Japanese were the last of the foreign powers to become a major presence in China. By the time the first Japanese vessel of the  modem era, the Senzaimaru, docked at the port of Shanghai in 1862 \(nineteen years after it 

408

officially opened\), Britain, the United States, Holland, and France were already established there \(See Fogel 1994b, 79–94; Haruna 1987, 555–601; Wang 1989, 140–156; Satō 1984, 67–96; Qiao 1989, 43–52\). Only seven Japanese had already settled in Shanghai when diplomatic ties were concluded in 1871, but after the creation of a Japanese consulate the next year, major Japanese companies began setting up branches there. Through the early Meiji era, the population grew slowly and became roughly two-thirds women, with the men in a variety of business concerns and the women largely in the prostitution trade. By 1890 the resident Japanese population had reached 644, and men now first outnumbered women \(339 to 305\). The population approached 1,000 on the eve of the first Sino-Japanese War. During the war the overwhelming majority of Japanese withdrew, but most returned following Japan’s victory. The Treaty of Shimonoseki concluding that conflict provided that Japan could build factories on Chinese soil, and as a result Japanese became more deeply involved in the Chinese economy. In late 1904 the resident Japanese population surpassed 3,300 and continued to rise much more rapidly from 1905 \(Zhu 1995, 401, 406; Takatsuna 1995, 119–121; Katō 1974, 316–317; Yonezawa 1938–1939\). Throughout the Meiji years the great majority of Japanese in Shanghai came from Kyushu and western Honshu. 

Immigration to Harbin followed a somewhat different course. Although Harbin was home to the earliest Japanese settlement in Manchuria, before it even existed Vladivostok served as a source of goods from abroad; it was also Russia’s mirror on the Pacific. Vladivostok fell within the Maritime Province, originally part of Qing territory, but it was ceded to Russia in 1860. It was then little more than a fishing village, and the whole region, as one source puts it, had more animals than people.1 By 1877 there were some 80 Japanese living in Vladivostok, most involved in the brothel business serving the many visiting sailors; several years later the 140–150 Japanese, all from Nagasaki, had several restaurants and several laundries there. By 1890 there were 392 Japanese in Vladivostok with a 3:2 female-to-male ratio, unlike most frontier settlements, which tend to be predominantly male, but intriguingly like the contemporaneous experience in Shanghai. On March 31, 1891, the Trans-Siberian Railway began construction, and Vladivostok was teeming with the businesses involved and the new construction on the docks. Among the laborers mobilized for the effort, some 500–600 Japanese were recruited from northern Kyushu villages. As the century came to a close, the Japanese population reached 1,000; communal institutions were beginning to emerge, but a preponderant involvement in prostitution remained \(one source indicates that there were 1  Sugiyama 1985, 11, citing an 1892 work by Kawakami Toshihiko, future consul of Harbin, Urajiosutoku.

more than 200 young women working as prostitutes in Vladivostok in the mid 1880s\) \(Sugiyama 1985, 14–15, 18–24, 27**–**28\). 

As the Ussuri Line of the Trans-Siberian Railway, linking Vladivostok with Khabarovsk, neared completion in the fall of 1896, Russia and China signed a secret treaty allowing Russia to spread rail lines across Manchuria. This became the Chinese Eastern Railway \(cer\), and in the spring of 1897 a construction authority for the cer was established in Vladivostok. A base of operations close to a river was still needed for the transportation of materials, and to that end a sparsely populated site near the Sungari River was selected. The necessary materials were brought by sea from Europe to Vladivostok, then by rail to Khabarovsk, and finally down tie Sungari by ship to this site. The first construction team of twenty men with a Cossack guard of fifty left Vladivostok in March 1898, arriving a month later at a site to be known as Staryi Kharbin \(Old Harbin\). They found there a small settlement of roughly twenty huts where the natives were producing low-grade alcohol and growing opium on the moist banks of the Sungari. They purchased it all and began the massive railway construction efforts that would eventually employ as many as two hundred thousand Chinese who migrated north for the work. The first project entailed building a station and narrow-gauge track from the wharf to the center of the former local settlement, and this transport route later became the main thoroughfare of Harbin, known as Kitaiskaia Ulitsa \(Chinese Street\) in Russian and Zhongyang dajie \(Central Boulevard\) in Chinese. In less than two decades, this avenue would become the heart of non-Chinese Harbin, lined with a wide assortment of shops selling the latest fashions and foods from around the world. Russian city planners dubbed the new site Posyolok Sungari \(Sungari Settlement\), but in a Japanese work introducing Manchuria published in 1904, it is referred to as Harbin, and thus the name must have come into popular usage within that six-year period. Always Kharbin in Russian and Ha-er-bin \(Harbin\) in Chinese, it was more often than not Harupin in Japanese writings of the late Meiji and Taishō years.2

2  The Chinese recently have come up with some far-fetched theories claiming that Harbin goes back to the late eleventh century, thereby predating the Russian settlement by many centuries. They have as yet presented little substantive evidence. See Clausen and Thøgersen 1995, 3–4, 12–16. On the early Harbin and the cer, see Quested 1982, 32, 100–101, 129–131; Koshizawa 1989, 13–24; Matani 1981, 1. There have been any number of theories about the meaning and origin of the name Harbin, none of them particularly persuasive. Five of these are summarized in Sugiyama 1985, 52–54. A Japanese guidebook of 1924 discusses three theories but declines to take a stand; see Harubin no gainen 1924, 1. The most recent theory, not cited in Sugiyama, is that of Guan Chenghe, in his Haerbin kao; he argues that it is from a Jurchen word meaning “honored” and that the city dates from 1097 \(see Li 1980, 3\).

In a 1932 essay the famous writer Yokomitsu Riichi recounted the story of the first Japanese, a young woman named Miyamoto Chiyo, who settled in Harbin \(Yokomitsu 1932, 2–17\). She had moved from her native Kumamoto to Vladivostok in 1888 at the age of eighteen with her younger brother, making her living there as an assistant to the only Russian doctor in the city. When the doctor moved to Harbin in 1898, she accompanied him. 

Because of her close association with the Russians, by century’s end she was placed in charge of all Japanese immigration matters. At the time of the Boxer Rebellion, Sino-Russian border tensions mounted; in July of 1900 the Russian Army routed or killed the entire Chinese population of Blagoveshchensk, some three thousand to four thousand persons. Many Japanese residents fled Harbin for Khabarovsk and elsewhere, as did many Chinese. Yokomitsu reported that only twenty-two of Harbin’s Japanese residents remained during the mass withdrawal, but that by 1901 the Japanese population had rebounded to more than three hundred again. At that point Miyamoto could no longer handle all the paperwork by herself, and a Japanese residents association, the Sōkakai \(Sungari Association\), was formed, another indication that by 1901, at least, the toponym Harbin had not yet been firmly established. By late 1902 there were 514 Japanese out of a total population of roughly thirty thousand in Harbin, according to a Sōkakai survey; there were roughly seven thousand Japanese throughout Manchuria at this time. There was another mass withdrawal from Harbin and elsewhere in Manchuria to Japan in 1903–1904 on the eve of the Russo-Japanese War, though Harbin remained untouched by the fighting \(Sugiyama 1985, 30–32, 49–50, 56–60\).3

Thus, the Japanese population of Harbin, which only surpassed its prewar figure in late 1907 when it reached 627, was vastly inferior to the Shanghai figure, which was nearing six thousand at the same time. Japanese residents in Shanghai had already attained a more gender-balanced population and a more professionally balanced one as well by the turn of the century, but these processes would take much longer in Harbin. Despite these differences and the fact that the surrounding populations were ethnically dissimilar, the two communities began to produce interestingly similar patterns of settlement and communal institutions that offer us a handle for comparing their integration into the two larger communities.

**Occupational Integration: Stores, Shops, Businesses, and Other** **Lines of Work**

The most remarkable quality of the entire Japanese enterprise in Shanghai was how extrinsic it was to the city itself and how much life was fashioned to resemble home. From the second decade of the twentieth century, Japanese began informally referring to their adopted city as “Nagasaki ken, Shanhai shi.” 

This offhand remark indicates the extent to which most Japanese lived in a Japanese style, as fish and vegetables arrived from Nagasaki on a daily basis and were sold in the local markets. “It was as if a comer of the Nagasaki market had moved,” noted one Shanghai Japanese from Nagasaki; and, as if to second the point made by Edgar Snow: “Japanese residents in Shanghai lived there oblivious to the fact that they were in a foreign countiy” \(Takatsuna 1995, 125\). 

While the Japanese community of Shanghai was a distinct ethnic enclave, it nonetheless came to represent an economic entity worth dying to protect. 

“Nagasaki-Shanghai” finds a fascinating parallel in the following statement of the famous travel writer and novelist, Muramatsu Shōfū:

The Japanese have no intention whatsoever of throwing away fifty years of work that have gone into the building of‚ “Shanghiai-Japan.” The Yangzi trade runs annually to five or six hundred million yen and often more than seven. As Manchuria is Japan’s lifeline, Yangzi trade is Japans line of nourishment, and it will under no circumstances throw this away. There is no reason to relinquish such great interests even if it means fighting. 

We must come to the aid of the 30,000, \[Japanese\] residents of Shanghai. 

We cannot let them die before our very eyes. This is our responsibility both as a state and as a government.4

Although the Treaty of Shimonoseki enabled them to establish a concession area, the Japanese never staked that claim in Shanghai, as they did in Tianjin and Hangkou. The great majority remained in the International Settlement; of the 26,208 Japanese living in Shanghai in 1935, 19,651 \(75 percent\) resided in the International Settlement. Even before the first Sino-Japanese War, Japanese were settling in the Hongkou \(Hongkew\) quarter of the settlement, soon to become known informally as the “Japanese Concession” or “Japantown”5

The first Japanese to move to Shanghai were principally government officials and independent businessmen who ran their own shops usually in the service sector. There were as well a few who worked as servants in the homes of Westerners. Through the end of the nineteenth century, women outnumbered men by a large margin and most worked as prostitutes for foreigners or as entertainers employed by Japanese businessmen to establish foreign contacts. In 1885, there were more than twenty Japanese-owned brothels and “teahouses” 

in Shanghai. The larger Japanese concerns began to set up branches in the Meiji era—Mitsubishi in 1875, Mitsui Bussan in 1877, Yokohama Specie Bank in 1893—but they did not begin to exert a strong influence until after the Sino-Japanese War and especially after World War I \(Zhu 1995, 406, 410; Takatsuna 1995, 120; Peattie 1989, 183\). 

Whereas the major Japanese banks set up branches along the Bund, mid-level stores and trading firms were located in the French concession. Smaller shops were closer to the area in which most Japanese lived in Hongkou, primarily along North Sichuan Road, Wenjianshi Road, and Wusong Road. A December 1927 survey noted that Japanese were 47 percent of the entire foreign population of Shanghai. Those who worked for the larger concerns and the major banks were dubbed the kaisha-ha,   or company clique, whereas those who operated smaller businesses and stores in Hongkou or Zhabei were known as the dochaku-ha, or “native” clique. This distinction undoubtedly reflects the fact that the former group were rotated in and out of Shanghai on two-or three-year terms, while the latter more often than not had settled in Shanghai. 

Through the Taishō years, there were ten Japanese-run ryokan, some twenty Japanese geshuku, and twenty-four Japanese restaurants and brothels, many of these owned by migrants from Kyushu. 

One-fourth of all Japanese in Shanghai were directly tied to the cotton textile industry, and many more did business with it. These companies grew in tandem with the development of Japanese capitalism. Through the Taishō 

years, Japan gradually replaced Germany and France in economic influence in Shanghai and by the end of the 1920s reached a par with the United States and Great Britain, reflected in the fact that it had the largest number of foreign banks in Shanghai. From 1912, with the establishment of the Republic, Japanese banks began making loans to China and gained a toehold in the Chinese financial world through investments in Chinese railways and the like. Indeed, as the Japanese presence in the Chinese economy grew stronger—according to a 1915 

survey, for example, there were seventy-five Japanese companies in Shanghai overall population of Shanghai at this time was roughly 3.6 million, making the Japanese 0.7 percent of the total.

worth more than 50,000 yen in capital—the Japanese there began to see it as an intrinsic and essential part of their world \(Zhu 1995, 412–414; Duus 1989, 65–100; Katō 1974, 318–319; Takatsuna 1995, 121–125; see also Nakamura 1973, 91–96\). 

The large Japanese economic stake in the Shanghai market certainly helps to explain the willingness of local Japanese, as the citation from Muramatsu Shōfū indicates, to square off and confront the Chinese nose-to-nose. Excluding Manchuria, Shanghai accounted for one-half of Japans trade with China; there were immense investments to protect in the textile industry and with the larger trading companies. These factors, of course, also played an important role in producing anti-imperialist Chinese nationalism, and they served as well to strengthen Japanese resolve to defend their assets \(Banno 1989, 314–329; Jordan 1991\). 

Unlike Shanghai, where each ethnic group lived in a small universe unto itself and enjoyed extraterritoriality, Harbin remained in Russian hands, for all intents and purposes ruled as a fiefdom of the cer by its head, Dmitri Khorvat; and this in spite of the concessions won by Japan after victory in the war. Unlike Shanghai where a Japanese consulate was opened as early as 1872, Miyamoto Chiyo’s work was not turned over to consular officials in Harbin until 1907. The new infusion of capital from Japan from 1907 helped revive Harbin’s sluggish economy. That year marked the beginning of a sustained return of Japanese to the city following the withdrawal at the time of the Russo-Japanese War. 

Mitsubishi and Mitsui both opened branches in 1907 as well. 

As early as 1905 there were five competing companies plying the sea lanes between Japanese ports and Vladivostok. In December of 1907 the Japanese population in Harbin reached 627, superseding its prewar figure. Even before the war, larger enterprises had been founded by Japanese in Harbin, such as Tokunaga Shōkai, Suzuki Nichi-Man Shokai, and Moritomo Shōkai. A local survey of Japanese businesses in Vladivostok, for example, showed that there were thirty general stores, seventy-five laundries, thirty-six barbers, twenty-seven cobblers, thirty-six carpenters, and sixty-two families engaged in the kashiseki, or “rooms for rent” business, clearly a euphemism for houses of prostitution. 

World War I brought prosperity to Harbin, as trade exports rose dramatically and, for example, the number of oil refineries rose from seven to twenty. During the war years Japanese contacts throughout Siberia rose to make it second only to the United States for the volume of its trade with Japan.6 Yet, even as the 6  Higashi Kochiku 1918, 184–186; Manshū nippō, December 18, 1907, 1, article on the civil administration of Harbin and the cer authorities mentions the corning to Harbin of Mitsui; Sugiyama 1985, 64–68, 75–78, 90–92.

Japanese population of Harbin continued to grow and mature as a group during the Taishō years, and as fresh business opportunities emerged, the number of Japanese involved in one end or another of prostitution remained extraordinarily high.7

The Bolshevik Revolution caused a major shift in power relations within the city. Struggles within the cer between Khorvat and the railway workers were exacerbated when local Chinese authorities began to demand the recovery of foil sovereignty over the region and the railroad. From this point forward, while Russian culture continued to exercise a profound impact on the non-Chinese quarters of the city, Russian control in Harbin began a slide from which it was never to recover. Even as the Russian presence in Harbin continued to grow, in fact explode with the Influx of White Russian refugees after 1917, they no longer enjoyed tsarist support and many were reduced to poverty or worse. Harbin was still a city of pioneers—Chinese, Japanese, Russian, and others—a new city undergoing far more change and flax than Shanghai in these years. 

Following the war, the joint powers invaded Siberia in an effort to defeat the Bolsheviks, but by the end of 1918 all of the other powers had withdrawn. 

Japanese forces stayed for more than four years, despite worries on the part of the local communities in Siberia and the Chinese northeast of exacerbated tensions with, the Russians and Chinese. There were by now thousands of Japanese expatriates \(and far more Koreans now under Japanese hegemony\) scattered through the towns and cities of Northeast Asia and along the Trans-Siberian Railway. When the decision was reached for the Japanese troops to pull out, many protested vociferously through the local Japanese press against such a move for fear of Soviet reprisals, in part at least because the Japanese army and navy had been so closely associated with propping up petty White Russian dictators such as Grigorii Semyonov.8

Nonetheless, as the Russian emigré population tripled during the Russian civil war years to 124,000 by 1921, the Japanese population also rose 75 percent 7  Harubin tsūshin, February 1, 1923, 3. This report contains a survey of the local population, breakdowns by the suburbs of Harbin, and a detailed occupational breakdown. By this time, the men outnumbered the women roughly five-to-four \(Song 1995, 104–107\). There is a fascinating breakdown of the businesses owned and operated by Russians in Harbin in Urajio nippō, August 10, 1922, 3. With the exception of the brothel business, Russians \(in larger numbers, to be sure\) were engaged in many of the same sorts of affairs in the city.

over the same period to 3,545, and by far the largest segment of the local population, the Chinese, rose from 170,000 in 1917 to more than 315,000 by early 1922. 

Despite nominal control of the city now in Chinese hands, each of the local ethnic groups basically managed its own affairs. Each created its own array of institutions to protect its constituent population. Unlike Shanghai, though, there was greater interaction among the various communities. 

****

**Communal Organizations and the Japanese Residents Association** Like many ethnic groups who have settled away from the familiar surroundings of home, the Japanese throughout continental Asia established a panoply of communal institutions to organize the local community; mobilize it when need be, and see to the everyday social, educational, economic, and religious needs of its people. In this regard the Harbin and Shanghai experiences were similar. Already in the 1870s, the Japanese consulate in Shanghai took the lead in establishing communal institutions, building a Japanese cemetery in 1873 that was placed in the hands of the local Higashi honganji \(founded 1874\) in 1877. Control over the cemetery land was later passed to the Japanese Residents Association \(jra\), which was founded in 1907 in Shanghai. The Higashi honganji also led the way with the establishment of medical facilities and clinics; by late 1907 there were seven Japanese hospitals in Shanghai and a Japanese Medical Association of Shanghai \(Shanhai Nihon Ikai\) was founded in May 1902. In 1869, even before diplomatic relations were normalized, the Japanese government lent a hand in the creation of schools in Shanghai. As more schools emerged over the course of the 1870s, they exerted a major influence on the permanence of the local Japanese community. The first school for young women was built in 1876, at a time when there were only forty-five Japanese in the city. That year also witnessed the establishment of a Japanese foundling home in Shanghai \(Zhu 1995, 421–422, 426–427; Katō 1974, 319–320\). 

The jra of Shanghai \(Shanhai Nihon Kyoryū Mindan\) fell directly under the management of the consulate and hence the Gaimushō and exercised considerable local authority within the Japanese community, in large measure because the Japanese enjoyed extraterritoriality in China. It was joined by the Japanese Street Federation of Shanghai \(Shanhai Nihonjin Kakuro Rengōkai\) and the neighborhood associations \(chōnaikai\)t which served at various levels to both protect and mobilize the entire Japanese community. By supporting local institutions and by speaking on behalf of local Japanese interests, the jra served to strengthen the internal cohesion of the local community. Soon after its founding, the elite stratum among the Japanese gained control over 

416

the jra. Among their formal duties were maintaining the Japanese volunteer brigade with its responsibility for guarding the International Settlement, maintaining jra-run schools, running the local cemetery, and seeing to the preservation of hygiene and the prevention of disease. Schools were its particular preserve, with more than 80 percent of the jra budget devoted to education. 

In 1908 there were 225 Japanese children in these schools; by 1931 there were 3,345. Over the course of the Taishō years, this number surpassed 2,000, as the percentage of students in the total Japanese population also rose. This change reflected the greater number of entire family units living in Shanghai; earlier, Japanese men had frequently moved to Shanghai alone \(Takatsuna 1995, 125–

127; Zhu 1995, 428\). Also, the Tō-A Dōbun Shoin \(East Asian Common Culture Institute\), a Japanese postsecondary institution of higher learning, graduated more than 3,600 students between 1900 and 1945 \(see below\). 

The street and neighborhood associations became essential to the fabric of the local community. When the Twenty-one Demands were delivered to the Yuan Shikai government in 1915, anti-Japanese boycotts broke out across urban China. A large number of Japanese left for home, and this confrontation provided the opportunity for the formation of six neighborhood associations in Shanghai. Together they worked with the jra and the consulate to protect local Japanese as well as to streamline the operations of local communal institutions. In 1917 six more neighborhood associations were set up. At the time of the May Thirtieth Incident \(1925\), they were mobilized to act as effective policing agencies. By the end of the period of Japanese residency in Shanghai, there were altogether forty such associations. The overarching organization that managed the many neighborhood groups was the Street Federation. Unlike the jra, which was controlled by the kaisha-ha, the neighborhood and street associations were controlled by the dochaku-ha, reflecting the sentiments of the bulk of the local Japanese population. 

These organizations reflect a sense of isolation, unease, perhaps even alienation among the Japanese, all of which influenced their degree of integration into the community of Shanghai. As a group they tended to reproduce as many of the institutions of home as they possibly could. In the face of Chinese nationalism directed against Japan, as was to occur so frequently during the period under study, they remained on the whole staunchly nationalistic themselves. At the time of the Northern Expedition in 1927, fear that the forces of Jiang Jieshi \(Chiang Kai-shek\) would do harm to Japanese interests inspired the formation of a Shanghai branch of the Reserve Officers Association from among the jra members with military experience. Indeed, these organizations sadly provided the organizational structure for the massacres of Chinese who were rounded up on the pretext of being “plainclothes guerrillas” at the time of

the first Shanghai Incident in January 1932. As tensions grew through the late 1920s and 1930s and Shanghai continued to be a major anti-Japanese center, despite both Japanese and Guomindang massacres, the jra simply grew more intransigent. It led the call to punish China and feverishly demanded that the Japanese army defend local interests \(Takatsuna 1995, 127–131\).9

The Harbin community, albeit smaller in numbers, produced an impressive array of communal institutions as well. Although Harbin generally followed Valdivostok’s lead in most civil matters, Harbin had formed a residents association, the Sōkakai, as early as 1901; Vladivostok followed suit in March 1902 at a time when there were 2,875 Japanese in the city \(and a total of 4,334 

throughout Siberia and the Russian Far East\). The mass evacuation of Japanese from the northeast over the next two years left few behind to run communal affairs. As Harbin’s Japanese population began to return to prewar levels at the end of the first decade of the twentieth century, the first Japanese elementary school was opened, with all of four children, in 1909 in a room at the local Nishi honganji; it did not have its own building until June 1923, when an impressive structure built by the Residents Association and the South Manchurian Railway Company \(smr\), which from 1920 assumed one-half of all educational costs for local Japanese, was completed. The first elementary school was called Momoyama; a second one was called Hanazono \(Sugiyama 1985, 65–67, 78, 116–117; Gotō 1973, 68–82; Sugiyama 1979, 8\). 

Despite these separate communal institutions, the Harbin community achieved a much higher degree of integration than that of Shanghai. In Shanghai most Japanese lived in blissful ignorance of the surrounding Chinese populace, whereas in Harbin most Japanese learned Russian and many even took a stab at Chinese. Inasmuch as those who settled in Harbin planned to remain there for the duration, it was only natural that they master the language of the predominant groups in the city, much as Japanese learned English in the United States or Portuguese in Brazil. In September 1920 a Russo-Japanese School opened, the forerunner of the Harbin Academy, which became famous as a training institute in the Russian language. The first principal, Inoda Kōhai, 9  Though little studied, the Shanghai “Incident” beginning in late January of 1932 left 6,080 

Chinese dead, 2,000 wounded, and 10,400 missing; 814,084 suffered direct losses, and 80 percent of urban workers lost their jobs; 50 percent of all factories in Zhabei were destroyed, largely from aerial bombardment, and 1.2 million Chinese were made refugees. This was mostly the work of the Japanese military, but the neighborhood associations played roles in the killing and destruction, and all in five weeks’ time. Small consolation that the Chinese won this battle, though that victory proved a great inspiration in the next and far greater Pyrrhic victory of the Chinese against Japan.

was a former student of Futabatei Shimei from the Tokyo Foreign Language School. A Sino-Japanese Evening School for language training opened in early April 1923 with similar aims of fostering Sino-Japanese understanding and friendship. In addition, many Japanese who worked outside the home adopted Western styles of dress from the end of the Meiji period. In fact, Japanese in Vladivostok early on became tailors, producing Western-style men’s and women’s clothing initially for the local Russian population. Fresh Japanese produce was imported from numerous Japanese ports throughout the northeast as far as the Blagoveshchensk region with Chinese merchants serving as intermediaries. 

In the aftermath of World War I and the Bolshevik Revolution, Harbin became congested with countless new immigrants. The year 1919 was particularly difficult, with the Japanese military confiscating freight cars for their own use. That same year, though, the Japanese community founded the Harbin Commercial Exhibition Hall \(Harubin Shōhin Chinretsukan\) dedicated to stimulating Russo-Japanese trade and incidentally to calming Russo-Japanese tensions. The head was Mori Gyoin, who was to become a central figure in the local Japanese community for the next two decades. The Exhibition Hall began that year to publish a monthly magazine, each issue well over one hundred pages, featuring all manner of local news, commercial statistics, and a variety of human-interest stories, mostly from Harbin but with occasional reports from Vladivostok and elsewhere in the region. By October of 1921 the Japanese Chamber of Commerce of Harbin had 113 members \(Sugiyama 1985, 93–95, 97, 106, 111, 113–114; Harubin tsūshin, March 17, 1923, 3; March 18, 1923, 2; Yamamoto 1932, 357\).10

Despite these efforts at smoothing over the ethnic frictions in the city, visitors noted that Chinese, Japanese, and Russians each had their own interests to protect and their own self-defense mechanisms. When the Japanese army withdrew in 1922, many Japanese residents of Vladivostok decided it was no longer safe to live there, and they resettled in Harbin; others moved to the Korean city of Ch’ongjin to the south, but Harbiners did not move in any significant numbers. The decade from the evacuation in 1922 through the Manchurian Incident marked Harbin’s Republican Chinese phase. The central government in Beijing and later in Nanjing was never strong enough to exercise control over Harbin, and thus the city fell under the sway of the massive Manchurian 10  A June 1922 document marked “secret” in the Gaimushō Archives complained that Japanese in Manchuria had changed their clothing in accordance with the conditions of life and work in the region, which the author regarded as potentially deleterious to long-term planning, and the Japanese “treat locals like slaves.” See Miyahara 1922.

satrapy of warlord Zhang Zuolin, who turned affairs over to his underling, Zhang Huanxiang. The latter Zhang began a course of action to sinify Harbin that met with considerable friction with the leaders of the other ethnic communities \(Higashi 1918, 189; Sugiyama 1985, 114–115\).11

In both Shanghai and Harbin, Japanese newspapers abounded, reinforcing the sense of separate communities. In addition to journalists from all the major Japanese dailies and weeklies, Shanghai produced several of its own, such as Shanhai nippō \(founded 1903\), Shanhai mcfuntchi shinbun \(founded 1914\), Shanhai mainichi shinbun \(founded 1918\), and Jiangnan zhengbao \(founded 1918\), a Japanese-owned newspaper published in Chinese. Although serving a smaller community, Harbin produced even more, such as Harubin nichinichi shinbun, Taihoku shinbun, Harubin tsūshin, Ro-A jihō, Hoku-Man denpō, and Teikoku tsūshin \(Ozaki 1990, 10; Yanagida 1986, 234\).

**Politics Within the Japanese Communities**

The one area of life in Shanghai that witnessed considerable Sino-Japanese integration was left-wing politics, and this in spite of the variety of local Japanese police forces in Shanghai, including an office of the Special Higher Police \(Tokkō\). As we have seen, the great majority of Japanese in Shanghai were at least as supportive of their government and military as their friends and relatives back home. What was the purpose, then, of so many policing agencies? In part, the police were there to protect against intrusions from the Chinese; but there were good reasons, as mainstream politics veered sharply to the right at home, to keep a close watch on the activities of some Japanese in Shanghai as well. I shall introduce three interrelated topics, in each of which a high degree of cooperation between Chinese and Japanese was achieved: Uchiyama Kanzō, the Tō-A Dōbun Shoin, and the Sorge-Ozaki spy ring. 

11  Higashi Fumlo \(1940, 46\) reported that relations between young Japanese and young Russians were excellent, with some intermarriage, but this strikes me as somewhat exaggerated or propagandistic. His book was published in 1940. More typical was Yamamoto Sanehiko’s comment \(1932, 346\): “Who must bear responsibility for the crime of turning Harbin into a street of flirtatiousness?” The White Russians, of course. “All their great pride for the glories of the tsarist era they now discard in the gutters of Harbin. They keep groups of degenerate women, and they have transformed it \[Harbin\] into a prominent boil on the face of the earth.” Stunning comment, considering that it was the Japanese who pioneered the flesh trade in Harbin.

Uchiyama Kanzō first arrived in Shanghai in 1913 and four years later opened the Uchiyama Shoten on North Sichuan Road. He eventually built the largest collection of Japanese books in China proper, catering to local Japanese as well as to Chinese who had studied in Japan. As his business grew, he converted the second story of the shop into a tatami room for meetings between Chinese and Japanese writers. In a short time, Uchiyama became a broker and his bookstore a salon for Sino-Japanese literary contacts. It was through him, for example, that Tanizakai Jun’ichirō met with such eminent Chinese writers as Tian Han, Guo Moruo, and Ouyang Yuqian in 1926. The strongest and most famous bond Uchiyama forged with a Chinese writer was with Lu Xun, who moved to Shanghai from Guangdong in October 1927. In March of 1930 Lu Xun, fearing arrest, hid in the Uchiyama Shoten for more than a month \(Ozawa 1972, 83; Uchiyama 1961, 122; Ozaki 1990, 26–33; Fogel 1989, 575–602; Uchiyama 1979, 39; NHK 1986\). 

Uchiyama went out of his way to remain as apolitical as possible, although as Sino-Japanese tensions mounted, being apolitical meant being unwilling to accept the pronouncements of his own government and the local Residents Association toward China. It meant as well that he had to avoid the endemic struggles within the Chinese literary movement of the 1920s and 1930s. Without a doubt, the overwhelming political bent of his Chinese clientele was leftist, and many were or would soon become Communists. Under extremely politicized circumstances, being apolitical bordered on the impossible, but that was, nonetheless, Uchiyama’s stance. Also, because he was in China and not in Japan, he was able to sell Japanese works, such as translations of the writings of Marx and Lenin, that by the 1930s would have been increasingly difficult, if not outright impossible, to put on sale back home. Uchiyama remained in China through the end of World War II and until his death in 1959; he was posthumously lionized in the People’s Republic as a lao pengyou \(lit., old friend\). 

Another Japanese institution that bred radical activities and fostered close Sino-Japanese integration in Shanghai was the Tō-A Dōbun Shoin. A product of the imagination of the adventurer and reformer, Arao Kiyoshi, and the hard work of his disciple, Nezu Hajime, together with Konoe Atsumaro, it was founded in 1900 in Shanghai, ideally for both Japanese and Chinese students. 

The curriculum emphasized contemporary subject matter: business, political science, agriculture, and much Chinese-language training \(Reynolds 1987, 1989\). A number of students developed overwhelmingly strong sympathies for the Chinese labor movement over the course of the 1920s; some witnessed the May Thirtieth Incident, Chinese workers’ strikes, or even activities of the young Chinese Communist Party \(ccp\). Several of the Japanese students abandoned their education altogether to participate in the Chinese revolutionary

421

movement, while others were expelled for becoming too involved; in either case their language training served them well and set them off from most of their local countrymen, who had shown little or no interest in learning Chinese. 

Despite die fact that the Japanese policing agencies kept a close watch on their movements, many Japanese students \(together with their Chinese classmates\) became deeply Involved in leftist and anti-imperialist actions. These activities intensified into the early 1930s, when, as Chalmers Johnson has noted, “what amounted to a Japanese cell of the Chinese Communist Youth League had been established” at the Tō-A Dōbun Shoin \(Johnson 1990, 55\). 

In 1930 a number of Tä-A Dōbun Shorn students joined with a small group of Japanese and Chinese journalists and writers in Shanghai to form 31e China Problems Study Group. The group’s recognized leader was a Chinese Communist activist and graduate of Kyoto University, Wang Xuewen. Wang had studied economics under Kawakami Hajime and lived in Japan for a total of fourteen years. Because of his experience and language talents, the ccp had assigned Wang the task of rallying “antiwar, anti-imperialist” Japanese in Shanghai to the Communist cause \(Nishizato 1977, 12, 25, 48–49, 74, 89; Kawai 1979, 207–211, 259, 262, 320, 339, 341–343, 368–369; Peng 1988, 28–29\).12 Though Wang’s connections to the ccp were unknown to his Japanese acquaintances, none would likely have been surprised or upset by the news. The group discussed such issues as the developing Communist movement, the nature of Chinese society, and other au courant themes of the day among leftists. In mid-October one ccp member named Yang Liuqing suggested that the group move beyond discussion and participate in direct action. Wang agreed. Then, on the suggestion of Kawai Teikichi, who would become more prominent in the 1930s, they renamed themselves the Nis-Shi Tōsō Dōmei, or Sino-Japanese Struggle Alliance \(Kawai 1979, 371–374, 377; Johnson 1990, 57; Kawai 1973, 12–13; Ozaki 1990, 126–129; Kawai 1975, 2\).13

The first and most startling act of the Sino-Japanese Struggle Alliance was an antiwar action aimed at the Japanese Naval Landing Party in Shanghai. The large cement structure housing the latter was a daily, visible reminder that Japanese nationals and their property fell under Japanese military protection. 

12  Wang left Shanghai abruptly in 1937 and fled to Yan’an, where he and Japanese Communist Nosaka Sanzō organized and lectured at the Japanese Peasants’ and Workers’ School for captured soldiers of the Japanese army. See Nakamura Shintarō 1975, 231–240. 

13  As Nishizato \(1977, 90\) explains, they opted for the “Shi” of Shina in their title, rather than Chūgoku, despite claims that the former denigrated the Chinese, because the latter would be unfamiliar to most Japanese, and the Chinese in the group agreed On “Shina” 

and “Chūgoku,” see Fogel 1994a, 66–76.

In commemoration of the thirteenth anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution, the young men of the Alliance printed posters and leaflets in both Chinese and Japanese opposing all hostilities between the two nations. On the evening of November 7, 1930, they used coal tar to scrawl in immense characters on the side of the Naval Landing Party building:

Down with Japanese Imperialism\! 

Join hands with the Chinese Soviets\! 

Turn your guns around and bring down the capitalist-landlord state\! 

Long live the Chinese Communist Party\! 

Long live the soldiers, workers, and peasants\! 

Needless to say, the press widely reported the event. A group of students within the Tō-A Dōbun Shoin joined the Alliance and went on strike in sympathy. 

Several students and Alliance members were arrested in what was exaggeratedly reported in the press as the “Japan Communist Party Incident.” By early 1931, most of the students had been released from jail and expelled; Nishizato Tatsuo, a recent graduate of Tō-A Dōbun Shoin, was arrested as a ringleader in Tokyo by the Tokkō later in 1931 and was not released until December 1932 

\(Kawai 1973, 11; Johnson 1990, 57–58; Ozaki 1990, 130–135; Nishizato 1977, 100, 110–114\).14

Another ccp order to Yang in October 1931 directed him to find Japanese in Shanghai to cooperate with the intelligence-gathering work of Richard Sorge, an operative for Red Army intelligence. Yang turned to Ozaki Hotsumi, a well-respected journalist, and to Kawai Teikichi, whom lie knew through the Alliance. Ozaki and Kawai met for the first time at Yang’s home. Inasmuch as the Sorge-Ozaki spy ring has been discussed at great length by many fine scholars, we shall elide discussion of it here \(Johnson 1990; Deakin and Storry 1966; Prange 1984; Mader 1984\).15

The politics of Harbin were altogether different from those of Shang hai.  

Before the Japanese military seizure in the early 1930s, the city was administered on a daily basis by representatives of the different constituent communities, including the majority Chinese population. Left-wing activists certainly resided in or passed through Harbin, but it never became home to any sustained 14  Unlike other sources, which generally follow Kawai, Nishizato \(1977, 92\) claimed that the line “Long Live the Chinese Communist Party\!” was not one of the slogans plastered on the wall, because it would have been contrary to the nature of their movement. 

15  I have discussed Kawai Teikichi’s scholarship on China as a genre of non-academic sinology in Fogel 1993, 259–265.

political movement of the left. In fact, as Edgar Snow hinted, the drug trade was to become a kind of Russo-Japanese joint venture. 

Indeed, it was on the extreme right wing of the political spectrum in Harbin that Japanese and Russians found some common ground. From the late 1920s, the city experienced a rash of kidnappings, usually backed by the more fanatic elements in the Guandong Army working together with Russians fascist elements, of wealthy Chinese and of Russian Jews for huge ransoms; the Semion Kaspé kidnapping case is only the most notorious and grisly of many \(Stephan 1978; Vespa 1941, 78–80, 89, 196, 198–203, 205–218, 238–239, 253, 272\). 

Harbin also provided the setting for major political events that, unlike those in Shanghai, had little connection to China or Chinese politics. For Japanese residents of the city, the most dramatic event of the entire first half of the twentieth century was the assassination of Itō Hirobumi in October 1909 in front of the railway station. The assassin, a disgruntled Korean nationalist named An Chung-gun, was unhappy at Prince Itō’s prominent role in the coming annexation of Korea. A memorial statue to Itō was soon erected before the train station, and this event became a defining moment for the local Japanese community, even those born well after die event. About the same time, the Japanese consul general in Harbin, Kawakami Toshihiko, was also shot by a Korean, but he survived the attack \(Manshū nichinichi shimbun, December 26, 1909, 1; Yanagida 1986, 209–217\). 

There were certainly Japanese spies in and around Harbin, but, unlike Shanghai, most of them were working for the Japanese government. Harbin was home to a branch of the smr devoted to Russia-watching. Russian-language experts were stationed there to observe local Soviet politics and, more importantly, Soviet troop movements across the border. The Tokumu Kikan was an imposing presence that occupied two-thirds of an entire city block. Two blocks away it had another, smaller office, across the street one way from the headquarters of the Kenpeitai, or Military Police, which occupied half a city block, and the other way from the Harbin Shinto Shrine. After the murder of Zhang Zuolin in June of 1928 by officers in the Guandong Army, the political climate in Harbin took a decidedly chilly turn. From a general ambiance of “confused freedom,” as one memoirist put it, there was a precipitous slide into a more militarized atmosphere, especially following the Manchurian Incident and seizure of power by the Japanese authorities \(Matani 1981, appended maps\). 

The Guandong Army marched into Harbin in February 1932, several months after the Manchurian Incident. In a well orchestrated welcome, Japanese lined the streets of the city to greet them. There were still only about thirty-six hundred Japanese living in Harbin, though as many as two hundred thousand were scattered through the many cities and towns of Manchuria. Less than one

month later, on March 1, the puppet state of Manzhouguo \(Manchukuo\) came into existence, and the Japanese era in Harbin, the third regime in as many decades in this city of ceaseless transitions, officially took control. Six years later there were thirty-seven thousand Japanese residents, and their numbers continued to grow until the early 1940s. Under Japanese control, the Tokumu Kikan allegedly set up bureaus for the various ethnicities of the city and, for example, hired impoverished Cossack malcontents to keep a watch on the local Russian community. With the fox watching the chicken coop, this policy was guaranteed to make virtually everyone unhappy. As Edgar Snow noted at the time, the Japanese police then sold off contracts to run houses of prostitution and drug dens to local toughs and other unsavory elements in various sectors of the city, drawing off a percentage of the take for themselves. Many Japanese visitors to Harbin in the 1930s lamented the fact that there were whole illicit industries thriving in Harbin that would have been completely illegal in Japan \(Sugiyama 1985, 136–137; Vespa 1941, 33–35, 51, 86\).16

**Conclusions: Relations with the Homeland**

While Shanghai was a mosaic society, as intimated by Edgar Snow, in which the Japanese residents had little meaningful contact with the surrounding peoples, Harbin was more a multicultural melting pot in the sense of different ethnic groups coming together and giving up something of themselves as they attempted to create something new, though the incidence of marriage across racial lines remained low. No one ever dreamed or certainly ever espoused such a fate for the ethnic communities of Shanghai, least of all the Japanese there. Since there was no population “native” to Harbin, everyone was a pioneer and shared common difficulties in a way unimaginable in Shanghai. 

Bom in Harbin in 1928, Sugiyama Kimiko remembers being thoroughly confused in mid-August 1945 when she was warned by her uncle, an employee at the Japanese consulate, that she should leave Harbin for “home” immediately. Harbin was home. Her parents had met and married there in 1925 and had run an agricultural implements store there. They were all part of the pre-Manzhouguo generation who, she claims, lived amid other Asians who were 16  Vespa claims that in 1936 there were 172 brothels, 56 opium dens, and 194 licensed narcotics shops in Harbin alone, and that in Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces there were 550 

licensed brothels with 70,000 Japanese girls servicing customers \(1941, 102\). The Harbin figures, although high, are considerably lower than Edgar Snows, as noted at the beginning of this essay.

their friends and neighbors. During the tension of the Manchurian Incident, a Chinese man helped her father; both men were so far from their native places that neither had a clear idea what a country or an ethnicity really was. One of her close friends was a Korean who, her mother told her, was a cousin of An Chung-gŭn. She, of course, knew she was Japanese, but the primary “ethnic” affiliation she felt was as a Harbiner; and for that reason she felt neither overly upset at Japan’s loss in the war nor particularly threatened afterward. 

When they left Harbin, their Chinese friends threw them a party, in spite of her father’s worry that showing such attention to a Japanese family might be dangerous. Returning to Japan was a truly perplexing experience, because it was alien terrain. Yes, Japan had lost the war, Manzhouguo had dissolved, and Japanese had to withdraw to their “mother” country, but what, she still wondered, did any of that have to do with her \(Sugiyama 1979, 3–6, 9, 12–13, 15–16, 18–19; see also Kaetsu 1971\). 

There are many similar stories for Harbin and elsewhere in Manchuria. 

I have seen nothing comparable for Shanghai or anywhere else in China proper. Perhaps many emigrants to the Northeast Asian continent had truly internalized the propaganda of the day. More likely, they looked at the opportunities a new life in Manchuria afforded them much in the same way Japanese immigrants to the United States felt in the same years, though the presence of Japanese governmental and military agencies was far greater in Manchuria, to be sure, and Japanese did not enjoy extraterritoriality in the United States. The Shanghai community, though larger than the Harbin one, was never as stable nor as permanently fixed in its new home. Aside from rare exceptions such as Uchiyama Kanzō and the radical students and activists described above, Japanese residents of Shanghai had little contact with the local Chinese population. Japanese in Shanghai thus only rarely achieved, or even desired, any level of Integration with the surrounding populace. Unlike in Harbin, it was not a desideratum. In addition, there was considerable interaction among the various Japanese communities of Manchuria—baseball games, newspaper coverage, and other informal, social contacts—though little of a similar nature with or within the communities of China proper. There were far more Japanese communities and residents associations in Manchuria than in China proper and far more Japanese consulates in Manchuria than there are now. 

In one of the interesting ironies of Japanese foreign policy during the Manzhouguo era, the government moved to disband the Japanese residents associations in Manchuria in the mid-1930s, because they did not want the other nationalities in the new nation—who were all supposed to live in gozoku kyōwa \(harmony of the five ethnic groups\)—to think the Japanese were enjoying special privileges. A report from the Gaimushō of October 1937 lists eight 

426

residents associations that were dissolved in late September and early October; Harbin’s was to be discontinued in November. Also, the Japanese in Manchuria would, perforce, abandon all claims to extraterritoriality, for they were no longer fiving on Chinese or contested terrain but in Manzhouguo. All the residents associations were to be incorporated into the Kyōwakai, or Concordia Society, in many ways the ultimate tool of multicultural integration. In fact, it was the local Japanese military that feared the continued existence of the Harbin jra would lead to “ethnic animosities” \(minzokuteki tairitsu\).  After a diplomatic fury between Harbin and the Gaimushō from October 1937 through early 1938, the latter agreed to avoid the displeasure of the Manzhouguo government and disband all special organizations that seemed to offer Japanese any kind of distinctive favors. The Gaimushō specifically wanted to avoid the impression of “racial bias” and act in the spirit gozoku kyōwa \(Gaimushō Archives, file K3.2.2.1–32, reports of June 16, 1935, December 14, 1937, October 25, 1937, January 21, 1938, May 24, 1938, June 18, 1938, and August 17, 1938\). By comparison, it is hard to imagine the Japanese community of Shanghai remaining in existence without the jra. 

How did Japanese at home see the communities of Japanese on the mainland? Both Harbin and Shanghai were dubbed by journalists and travelers as the “Paris of the East,” and both cities were visualized as dens of iniquity. But, these competing images were as alluring to some as they were reprehensible to others. No one thought of the Japanese in Shanghai as pioneers, though that image frequently was used to describe Japanese who had settled in the Northeast. One report from Dalian \(Dairen\) that appeared in Chūō kōron in 1920 belied an image of Japanese that could apply to Harbin as well. 

Children raised here don’t know of the mild Japanese weather nor of its graceful scenic beauty. . . . They see decadent Chinese lives. . . . They will probably grow up with irregularities and with unimaginably strange psyches. Soon after birth, they see two races and learn two languages and see clearly the unnaturalness wherein one of the races overcomes the other. We know the children here are not the Japanese who pull rickshas or work as coolies. . . . Children molded by such a life as this—Japanese without a home place. . . . Elementary school students draw Mount Fuji, which they have never seen, from their imagination and paint it red. How will they ever see it right with the bald mountains of Manchuria \[about them\]? \(Kimura 1920, 73–74\)17
