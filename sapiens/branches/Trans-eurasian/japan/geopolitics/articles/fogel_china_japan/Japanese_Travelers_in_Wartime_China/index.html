  <meta property="og:description" content="This paper grows out of a much longer study of Japanese travel writing about China from 1862, when the first legal voyage set off in over two centuries, through the end of WWII.1 I have collected 500 book-length Japanese travelogues for this period, specifically excluding diaries, most newspaper accounts, and guidebooks. This paper will be a first effort to address those travelogues produced during the war, 1937–45.
There are at least two approaches one may take with these 500 accounts: they may be seen as a mass of primary material on China at the time, or they may be used as a mirror of changing Japanese views of China. This essay is most interested in the latter approach and will examine this body of writing as providing mountains of new evidence on the changing nature of Sino-Japanese cultural interactions over a crucial century. Thus, the larger study is of how East meets East.">

  <p>This paper grows out of a much longer study of Japanese travel writing about China from 1862, when the first legal voyage set off in over two centuries, through the end of WWII.1 I have collected 500 book-length Japanese travelogues for this period, specifically excluding diaries, most newspaper accounts, and guidebooks. This paper will be a first effort to address those travelogues produced during the war, 1937–45.</p>
<p>There are at least two approaches one may take with these 500 accounts: they may be seen as a mass of primary material on China at the time, or they may be used as a mirror of changing Japanese views of China. This essay is most interested in the latter approach and will examine this body of writing as providing mountains of new evidence on the changing nature of Sino-Japanese cultural interactions over a crucial century. Thus, the larger study is of how East meets East.</p>
<p>The number of Japanese travelers to China who penned accounts began to mushroom in the second decade of this century. Whereas the Meiji generation of travelers felt compelled to report back on everything that China had to offer their gaze, China had become a domesticated part of the everyday lives of most Japanese by the early Taishō period, and Japanese began writing and reading accounts tailored more specifically to their professional interests. Thus, for the 1910s, 20s, and most of the 30s, I have organized the material according to accounts by scholars and students, journalists, politicians, businessmen, professional travel writers, novelists, and other bodies by profession.</p>
<p>What happens as we enter the war years is that this useful mode of classification falls apart.</p>
<p>From the early 1930s, and especially with the establishment of Manzhouguo from 1932, Japanese travel writers on the whole began to assume a harsher, less sympathetic attitude toward the Chinese people and Chinese problems in general. Many reasons may have contributed to this change of tone in their narratives, not the least of which was surely the rising nationalistic mood back 1  Joshua A. Fogel, The Literature of Travel in the Japanese Rediscovery of China, 1862–1945</p>

<p>home in Japan and its confrontation with rising Chinese nationalism in the land visited.</p>
<p>Japanese travel on the mainland began to undergo a qualitative transformation in the face of Sino-Japanese military incidents and especially after a state of war came into existence between China and Japan in the summer of 1937.</p>
<p>Long before that year, Japanese visitors had seen signs of anti-Japanese activities connected with political and military events in Shandong, Shanghai, and elsewhere in China proper and in Manchuria. No traveler who left an account, however, even those few allegedly captured by bandits, was ever physically injured by Chinese at any time. When war became a reality of daily life, though, Japanese who came to China only rarely strayed from centers with Japanese civilian population or, more important, Japanese military units.</p>
<p>For that reason, Japanese travelers either tended to spend more of their time in Manchuria or in areas where a Japanese military presence was at least nearby. Already in the 1910s and 20s, travelers had begun devoting a growing portion of their time on the mainland to Manchuria, but that was largely for civil or cultural reasons; they wanted to see how their countrymen and women were doing in colonizing the barren wilderness of the region. They wanted to ride the South Manchurian Railway (SMR) and see the legendary sunset over the Manchurian plains. There were endemic disturbances in China proper throughout the late-Qing and Republican years, but that did not seem to scare away many Japanese travelers. If anything, it titillated their curiosity.</p>
<p>As travel on the whole tended to move more toward safety following the eruption of war, Japanese travel writing about China began to collapse from within. That the quality of travel accounts seriously declined is not at issue.</p>
<p>More to the point, distinctive profession-based sub-genres of travel writing all but evaporated, as almost all travelogues began to sound and read alike.</p>
<p>No longer were Japanese artists meeting, or even seeking out, Chinese artists; no longer were Chinese and Japanese novelists and poets exchanging ideas; no longer did any Chinese other than an occasional official meet with a Japanese governmental figure. The whole story of travel in China became: China and Japan at war. The reading public either no longer sought or was simply no longer getting accounts distinctive to the authors’ professions. None of this should be terribly shocking, but it does jolt the reader who has been working through the travel accounts from earlier decades, because the change is sharp, and a once vibrant literary form sadly becomes another casualty of war.</p>
<p>With the constraints of travel under wartime conditions and especially the political restrictions in both China and Japan during the war, the option available to those who did not wish to use their travelogues for Japanese expansionist propaganda was to stick to as detailed and factual an account of their</p>
<p>490</p>
<p>Japanese Travelers in Wartime China</p>
<p>observations on the mainland as they could. I will now look at a few of the Japanese travelogues of China from the war years.</p>
<p>One of great professional travel writers and surely the most prolific ever was Gotō Asatarō. He continued publishing into the early 1940s, though without his earlier extraordinary productivity, when in some years in the 1910s and 20s he would publish as many as 10 or 12 volumes. He adopted a completely Chinese persona back in Japan, dressing in Chinese clothes, building himself a Chinese-style home in Tokyo, and retaining all this throughout the war years.</p>
<p>Like others, from the late 1930s, his works stressed the importance of the war with China as well as the Chinese people’s misunderstandings of Japan’s true aims, but he also continued to stress the principal theme of his countless books on China, that the Japanese had to try ever so hard to understand Chinese sensibilities. Under such stressful conditions for someone who basically had good feelings for the country to which he had devoted his life, ambiguous messages of this sort were the best he could do. His failure to tow the line completely contributed to his being hounded by Japanese police agencies during the war and, perhaps, to his murder at their hands in August 1945.2</p>
<p>The educators and scholars who traveled to the mainland after the start of the Sino-Japanese War traveled almost exclusively in groups to Manchuria and north China. These included attendance at conferences, school trips, and academic investigations to view newly discovered documents or to dig sites. There are many accounts of this genre, and what they share is a distinct disinclination to mention any subject the least bit touchy. One such account, by a geographer in 1938, followed an eight-month trip through north China and Mongolia. The opening sentence was very typical of the entire account: “They say that China is the great Sphinx of East Asia.”3 Such opening lines—or functionally similar ones, such as “China of the past and China today are dramatically different”—</p>
<p>had become annoyingly hackneyed by this point. An author would raise the idea of China as “inscrutable,” or simply far from anything familiar, largely as a rhetorical device and then would pretend, after completing a trip, to have unlocked the mystery. In the late-19th century, such a claim might carry some glimmer of plausibility, when authors wished to stress that a knowledge of the Chinese classics would not make contemporary China transparently know-able. China could hardly still be seen as “inexplicable,” though, after hundreds 2  On Gotō Asatarō, see Mitsuishi Zenkichi 三石善吉, “Gotō Asatarō to Inoue Kōbai” 後藤</p>

<p>of travel accounts and thousands of newspaper reports had been published, to say nothing of the tens of thousands of Japanese who had actually visited the country. The author of this account described markets, foods, and many local districts on walks through Beijing; and in Mongolia, he described the foods, roads, toilets, clothing, Lamaist religious practices, and similar items from the daily lives of the residents.</p>
<p>As one might expect, far more journalists were active travel writers on the mainland during the war years, and the famed tradition of the Japanese press opposed to its government seems to have fallen by the wayside. The Japanese reading public must have justifiably been curious about developments in China in the immediate aftermath of the commencement of hostilities with China. The year 1938 produced a large number of journalistic travel accounts.</p>
<p>Some of these are just as abysmal as those of Paul Theroux and Fox Butterfield, and journalists seem to have pioneered the more strident tone of travelogues of China from then on. By 1938 or 1939 most travel writers, with the stunning exception of literary figures, had picked up the themes in which journalists had effectively led the way. Journalists’ accounts are lively in tone, but stunningly reductionist and moralistic.</p>
<p>Shortly before he died in 1936, Lu Xun, who had been a great Japanophile, read several accounts written by Japanese of meetings with him and was horrified by their misrepresentations; he swore off all further contacts of this sort.</p>
<p>The main culprit was Nagayo Yoshirō (1888–1961) who published a piece in 1936 based on a meeting the previous year. In 1938 Nagayo wrote a volume on Manchuria entitled Shōnen Manshū tokuhon (Primer on the Young Manchuria) in which he introduced the new developments there to a wide reading public in Japan. Three years later, he wrote another book about Manchuria, and now, he argued, Manzhouguo, a full ten years old, had fully matured, remaining just as important now to Japan. The last line of the book was “Manshūkoku banzai.”4</p>
<p>The qualified exception to the general implosion of travel accounts were those of novelists and poets, who were also the most prolific travel writers about China during the war years. The great literary critic Kobayashi Hideo traveled in China in 1938 as a war correspondent. The several pieces that he wrote magnificently evoke that time from the perspective of a sympathetic observer. Because so few Chinese would talk to him, Kobayashi used the opportunity to reflect on his role as an observer, though he never allowed the reader to forget that there was a war going on. In the parts of China he visited in the spring of 1938—Shanghai, Hangzhou, Nanjing, and Suzhou—that was not particularly difficult.</p>

<p>492</p>
<p>Japanese Travelers in Wartime China</p>
<p>He arrived in Shanghai in April and met an old friend from middle school, a journalist with the Japanese Air Force. Over profuse amounts of whiskey, his friend told him of the mass bombings of some 25 Chinese villages over the previous three days. Kobayashi was only happy that he did not have to file any such horrific reports, and his friend had clearly taken refuge in the bottle. “In meeting with war correspondents like [my friend] who had been here since the start of the war and listening to their stories in which war had already become a part of everyday life, I could see that this was not for me. It became clear that a novice like myself had no business showing up here all full of curiosity.” Under the circumstances, even curiosity seemed rudely out of place. When Kobayashi later arrived in Nanjing, he was told that his timing was perfect because the</p>
<p>“new regime” of Wang Jingwei was just about to be installed, but Kobayashi was not the least impressed.5</p>
<p>His description of the train ride to Hangzhou was devoted largely to the effects of the war. Even when he took time out for a boat ride on nearby West Lake, the war intruded—gunfire and artillery could be heard in the surrounding area, followed by planes flying over at low altitudes, making a frightening, earsplitting noise. “Perhaps the ducks floating on the lake have become inured to it. They didn’t budge”—a disquieting image, to say the least. In Hangzhou the next day, he heard a hard-bitten Japanese soldier say: “The three specialties of Hangzhou are mosquitoes, fires, and I’ve forgotten the third one.”6</p>
<p>The scene in Nanjing in April 1938 was much worse. An area set aside for refugees had ceased to exist, and the 400,000 housed there were released into the city to make their way. It was a gruesome sight, only a few months after the great massacre known to history as the Rape of Nanjing, and every morning Kobayashi would sit at his desk in his room and just observe, going out only in the afternoon.</p>
<p>In December of 1938 he traveled to Manchuria, though anyone looking for an ordinary travelogue of the northeast will not find it here. The opportunity occasioned by visiting sites so close to the Russian border and cities full of Russians and Chinese made Kobayashi reflect. As a student he had been deeply influenced by the great nineteenth-century Russian novelists, and although he knew not a word of the language, to every Russian face he saw—on fashion-able Kitaiskaya Boulevard in Harbin, among hotel bellboys, car drivers, even beggars on the street—he assigned a famous character from Russian fiction.</p>
<p>Realizing how ludicrous this was—like trying to find Lu Xun’s A Q among 5  Kobayashi Hideo 小林秀雄, “Kōshū,” 杭州 in Sekai kikō bungaku zenshū  世界紀行文學</p>
<p>全集 (Tokyo, 1959), vol. 12, pp. 41, 47.</p>
<p>6  Ibid., vol. 12, pp. 12–44.</p>
<p>Japanese Travelers In Wartime China</p>
<p>493</p>
<p>the many faces on the streets of Beijing—it provided him with the chance to consider what “understanding” between peoples and its limitations really entailed. Can two peoples have genuine “mutual understanding,” the term so often raised as the slogan for bilateral Sino-Japanese friendship? Or, does one group inevitably “understand or not understand” a situation “based on their own personal preferences?”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Kobayashi applied these interesting epistemological questions to the perennial issue of Japanese vs. others: “It is my belief that, insofar as the Chinese are foreigners, they have absolutely no understanding of the minds of the Japanese today who are participating in this war. They are not prepared for it. That is to say, we completely lack the preparation to prepare them” to understand.7</p>
<p>Asano Akira was a critic, poet, and former member of the Japan Communist Party. Membership in the last of these won him a period of imprisonment in the 1930s until he renounced his former views in an act of tenkō and subsequently joined the movement of romantic writers. In 1938 he was sent by a publisher to China to write essays on his impressions there, and much of what he produced is rather high-brow literary criticism. By the same token, he encouraged Japanese intellectuals to make a stronger effort to understand China better, because as Japanese interests on the mainland continued to grow, ignorance would only breed acts of anti-Japanese opposition among the Chinese. This much could have been written by an apologist for Japanese expansion, but that was not Asano’s case at all.</p>
<p>He was all for enhancing knowledge about China, for democracy in the region required it. And, yet, “there is no culture in China now,” he argued.</p>
<p>“What appears to be culture are only a degenerate corpse and a parasitic culture of ignorant overseas students. Japanese culture hasn’t yet become something to brag about to the world, but the new Japanese cultural movement is struggling to build a new Japanese culture. So, who are we to speak about reconstructing a new Chinese culture?”8 There is much that is interesting and much that is confusing in this appraisal. His travelogue was published in 1938, and it probably could not have appeared much later. Despite his clearly leftist views, Asano had no choice but to travel with Japanese troops in China.</p>
<p>In earlier decades, Japanese travelers had made considerable contacts with Chinese of their professions, and that level of communication became all but impossible, at least unobservable, after the war began in mid-1937. Inasmuch as that contact between Chinese and Japanese was one of the most interesting 7  Kobayashi Hideo, “Manshū no inshō” 滿州の印象, in ibid. , vol. 12, pp. 58–59.</p>

<p>494</p>
<p>Japanese Travelers in Wartime China</p>
<p>and intriguing aspects of this entire genre of material, the whole suffered. It forced Japanese travelers to write about other things. Most concentrated on the war itself, some on themselves, while others repeated the government’s official propaganda of ill-informed Chinese protesting the clearly benevolent intentions of the Japanese.</p>
<p>Several perceptive travel writers were compelled by virtue of so little contact with the natives to reflect on the extraordinary circumstances allowing them to be on the mainland. In Kobayashi’s case, this reflection led to serious rumi-nations of the meaning of mutual understanding between two peoples, how one wanted to be understood and how the other understood with or without one’s assistance. He thus examined the limitations and even the desirability of</p>
<p>“understanding.” His answers were often less illuminating than his questions, but that does not vitiate the latter.</p>
<p>Interestingly, not one of the extant travelogues by businessmen from the war years remarks on the extraordinary state of affairs under which their trips were being carried out. Businessmen had been forthright in their calls, before the start of the war, for peaceful Sino-Japanese relations and genuine friendship as the basis for healthy commercial interactions. Thus, this absence may support the argument that they continued in their earlier beliefs by not openly advocating the bellicose stance of their home government and military.</p>
<p>To love Manzhouguo—or, at least, to proclaim such love—was a form of positive sanction for Japanese military action in the region. To love Manchuria, though, was not the same thing as professing one’s love for Japan. These toponyms are very important in reading material from that time. Manchuria was merely an area in northeast Asia in which a variety of ethnic groups lived.</p>
<p>Merely to claim love for that part of the world said nothing about the conflicting political forces in the region. If one went on to argue that Manchuria was either part of China’s sovereign terrain or not, then one was making a much more overtly political statement. However, since “Manchuria” had no government of its own, prior to the imposition of the puppet regime of Manzhouguo, to love it carried no political connotations. After 1932, to continue claiming one’s love for “Manchuria” and not to mention Manzhouguo might entail a subtle, implicit critique of the new regime recently created there. To proclaim one’s love for China was another matter altogether.</p>
<p>Taken as a whole, there seems to be something of a watershed at the year 1938 in the publication of Japanese travel narratives of China. The only accounts that so much as suggest dissatisfaction with the war (or any war) or throw, however obliquely, any doubts in the direction of contemporary Japanese policy were published no later than that year. What vanished after 1938 was not simply opposition to war or sympathy for the Chinese. What</p>
<p>Japanese Travelers In Wartime China</p>
<p>495</p>
<p>largely disappeared was any form of written resistance to the dominant ideology of the state, and that development undoubtedly reveals the effects of repression. In each year from 1937 through 1939, new restrictions on publishing, harsher penalties for dubious materials, and more arbitrary powers for the state were added to the previous year’s.9</p>
<p>Just to show how self-censorship and false consciousness can cut both ways on the political spectrum, let me mention one last travel writer. In June and July of 1942, a young Toyoda Masako, who was working for the Information Department of the Japanese Army and would later become a famous leftwing novelist, carried out an investigation of the “mopped up areas” around Suzhou.</p>
<p>She was accompanied by three others, all older and already famous or soon to be. She returned to China 35 years later in 1967, for a six-week trip, during the most intense period of the Cultural Revolution. Her prime goal was to visit Yan’n, “the wellspring of the revolution.” While in Xi’an, she witnessed mass meetings calling daily for the ouster of Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping and people being paraded in dunce caps through jeering mobs of their fellow Chinese. When she finally arrived in Yan’an and visited all the historic sights associated with that period of the revolution—Mao’s former residence, the Anti-Japanese University, the meeting room of the Chinese Communist Party’s central committee—she was overcome with emotion. It was comparable to earlier Japanese travelers’ arriving in Qufu. This section of her volume is pure adoration for Maoist thought and the Cultural Revolution.10</p>
<p>Her account, though, was no different from many others by Japanese, Europeans, Canadians, and Australians.</p>
