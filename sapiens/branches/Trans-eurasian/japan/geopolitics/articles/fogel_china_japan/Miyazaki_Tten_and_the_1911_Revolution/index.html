  <meta property="og:description" content="My name is Joshua Fogel, and I teach East Asian history, in particular the history of Sino-Japanese relations, at York University in Toronto, Canada. Let me begin by thanking the organizers of this symposium for inviting me and allowing me to offer some thoughts at this forum. I have another reason to be thankful for this invitation to Fukuoka which I shall mention at the end of my talk today. Many people, especially those living in warm climates like Fukuoka, believe that because Canada is so far north, it is always freezing cold. In the winter, yes, Canada can be very cold, but Canada is a big place—in fact, it’s the second largest country in the world. East of the Rocky Mountains, Toronto has one of the nicer climates—much milder than nearby Buffalo, New York or even Detroit, Michigan. Please come visit us some time.">

  <p>My name is Joshua Fogel, and I teach East Asian history, in particular the history of Sino-Japanese relations, at York University in Toronto, Canada. Let me begin by thanking the organizers of this symposium for inviting me and allowing me to offer some thoughts at this forum. I have another reason to be thankful for this invitation to Fukuoka which I shall mention at the end of my talk today. Many people, especially those living in warm climates like Fukuoka, believe that because Canada is so far north, it is always freezing cold. In the winter, yes, Canada can be very cold, but Canada is a big place—in fact, it’s the second largest country in the world. East of the Rocky Mountains, Toronto has one of the nicer climates—much milder than nearby Buffalo, New York or even Detroit, Michigan. Please come visit us some time.</p>
<p>My topic today concerns the role of several Japanese in the 1911 Revolution in China. This is not an unknown topic. Scholars have actually worked on it a great deal—in Japan, China, North America, and even Europe. In fact, the central role played by certain Japanese supporters of Sun Yat-sen has provided an important bridge for Chinese and Japanese scholars as well as ordinary citizens to find common ground. My talk today is not aimed at offering a new interpretation or revealing some new documents on this topic of Japan’s role in the 1911</p>
<p>Revolution. Instead, I would like to take a close look at one extremely important Japanese activist and a book by him—well known, I’m sure, to everyone here—Miyazaki Tōten and his autobiography, <em>Sanjūsan nen no yume</em>.</p>
<p>Most scholars mine this work for every possible detail they can find about Miyazaki’s work to help set Sun Yat-sen on a course to overthrow the Qing dynasty and establish a new republican government in China. Miyazaki decided early in life to devote himself to finding a hero in China who would perform such heroic deeds. He was a very young man when he made this decision, and it seems in retrospect very much like the decision of a very young man. The amazing thing is that he not that he had such a dream but that he actually accomplished it, although at the time his dream seemed to him to be a complete failure. That was the final message of <em>Sanjūsan nen no yume</em>. It was the early Meiji period when he began his quest, the Tokugawa bakufu had just been overthrown a few years before, and just about anything seemed possible.</p>
<p>Miyazaki was born at the end of Meiji 3 (January 1871) in what is now Kumamoto-ken, and already many people in the western domains were</p>

<p>Miyazaki Tōten And The 1911 Revolution</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>unhappy about the way in which the Meiji Restoration had worked out. The next few years would witness the Saga Uprising and the Satsuma Rebellion.</p>
<p>Kyushu people sure seem to be an unruly group! In any event, for a variety of reasons, they were not pleased by the outcome of the overthrow of the Tokugawa bakufu. Miyazaki Tōten came to the view that a revolutionary movement to wipe away the decadent Qing dynasty would usher in an international movement aimed at freedom and righteousness everywhere, including Japan.</p>
<p>Sun would be China’s George Washington, and Tōten would be his General Lafayette, the Frenchman who came to Washington’s aid when the fortunes of the young American revolutionary forces were at their lowest.</p>
<p>When Tōten published his autobiography, though, in 1902, the Chinese revolutionary movement was in shambles. Sun was in hiding after the failure of an uprising in south China, and the future looked very grim. <em>Sanjūsan nen</em> <em>no yume</em> thus reads like an extremely self-pitying, romantic tale of total cataclysm. Tōten repeatedly characterizes his life as an utter failure—just a “dream”</p>
<p>without substance—despite his purest motives. He is forever blaming himself for his debilitating weakness for women and alcohol; his self-indulgence is on almost every page of his memoir, and it gets very tiring to read about it over and over again. And, all the time as he writes with an open bottle of <em>sake</em> nearby and a prostitute in his bed, one must remind oneself that he had a wife and child living in absolute poverty far away.</p>
<p>Something must be wrong. Miyazaki Tōten can’t both be a great figure in the Chinese revolution, a great friend to Sun, and also a whoring, self-pitying drunk who neglected his family almost completely. Yet, both statements are recognized as true. What’s wrong is the way I have framed the question. We can’t use early 21th-century eyes and early 21th-century values to evaluate events that took place over a century ago under altogether different conditions. So, I shall withhold evaluation of Tōten’s behavior until after we have a look at the details of his autobiography. Let us go back to the beginning and place Tōten in his proper place and time.</p>
<p>Tōten was born into a low-level samurai family, the youngest of eleven children. One older brother, Hachirō, died in 1877 during the Satsuma Rebellion.</p>
<p>His father died when he was nine years old, and many of his siblings died very young before reaching adulthood. Tōten’s own father possessed a bad combination of an elitist contempt for money and a sincere affection for alcohol. That made life in the Miyazaki household extremely difficult for everyone else. In addition, there was a consciousness bred among the younger family members that sacrifice for a great cause was worth more than living a sedentary, stable life. Growing up, Tōten was often told he should become a hero like his older brother, and his mother was no less stern in this regard than his father. She</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>Miyazaki Tōten and the 1911 Revolution</p>
<p>admonished him to die like a hero, not of old age. When Tōten later avoided military service at the time of the Sino-Japanese War in 1894, his mother was absolutely furious with him.</p>
<p>From my early 21st-century stance, it is almost unimaginable that a mother would wish her son to die young for some heroic cause. But, this is, of course, not something unique to Japan. It reads very much like the jihadist movement in the contemporary Middle East, or the famous line with which Spartan mothers would, allegedly, send their sons off to war: “Come back with it or on it!” The “it” here was their shield—in other words, their should fight and either return victorious with their shield in hand or die in battle and return (dead) on their shield, but never under any circumstances should they surrender and give up their shield and weapon.</p>
<p>Like his father before him, then, Tōten did not make practicality a priority in his life. Finding an objective for some, as-yet undefined heroic behavior was more important to the young Tōten. Even as an elementary school student, he distrusted all authority around him, be it his school teachers or the young Meiji government. The idea of going to school with the end of becoming an official in the new government was utterly abhorrent to Tōten. Like his brother and political comrade, Tamizō, Tōten imbibed the liberal ideas of the popular rights movement current in Japan of the 1870s and 1880s; that was a cause worth fighting for.</p>
<p>Throughout his teenage years and early twenties, Tōten would be attracted to one or another set of ideas or ideology. But, as soon as he wholeheartedly adopted one ideology, he would soon thereafter wholeheartedly reject it and move on to something else. For awhile he studied at the Ōe gijuku of Tokutomi Sohō and, although he enjoyed it for a time, he soon began to distrust everyone around him and then ran off to his next adventure, this time in Tokyo.</p>
<p>What saved him there—again, only for a short while—was his conversion to Christianity which he adopted with the same fervor as he embraced every new phase of his life. He also studied at the Tōkyō Senmon gakkō, forerunner of Waseda University. When he returned to Kumamoto because he was broke and despondent in the early 1880s—still a teenager, by the way—he led Christian church services for young people in his village and instantly became a local leader. He must have had a certain charisma about him.</p>
<p>Like other creeds, Tōten soon abandoned Christianity and later denounced in tones as fervent as he had earlier adopted it in his 1902 booklet. His brother Yazō, who was two and one-half years older than Tōten, had lingering doubts about the whole business of the Trinity and had never been as convinced about Christianity as Tōten, and Tamizō persuaded Tōten that social problems were far more important than otherwordly (religious) concerns. This was a time of</p>
<p>Miyazaki Tōten And The 1911 Revolution</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>great rural poverty in Japan, and many tenant farmers in their area could no longer pay their rent to their landlords. Tōten agreed to join the struggle as soon as his ongoing search and studies came upon a solution to these problems. Tamizō then found the answer in the then-popular “single tax proposal”</p>
<p>of Henry George. This won Tōten to the cause, but it was not only Tamizō’s stress on the here and now but Yazō emphasis on the fact that this solution would embrace all of Asia—that is, it was not just a solution for Japan. A very famous American politician once said that “all politics is local”; the young Miyazaki Tōten would certainly have disagreed.</p>
<p>Remember, Tōten is still barely into his mid-teen years. For Tōten, as for his older brothers, commitment was total; they approached everything with a ferocious intensity that could only lead to great exhilaration or equally great despair. It was all or nothing for Tōten and his brothers. Once he found the answer to the world’s problems, he was prepared to sacrifice everything—</p>
<p>family, possessions, anything—to see that cause realized. Most of us just don’t live like that any more.</p>
<p>So, the lifework that Tōten set for himself was nothing less than the revival of Asia. Yazō impressed upon him the lesson that Asia was suffering from oppression by the Western powers—Russian being the worst oppressor of them all.</p>
<p>The countries of Asia had to throw off the imperialist yoke and regain their sovereignty, their control over their own people, and their dignity as human beings. That immense struggle had to start at the epicenter of Asia—namely, China, the largest and thus most important country in Asia. If Japan suffered because of the inequities of the landholding system, as Tamizō had taught Tōten, then China was in an even worse situation. Rebuilding an equitable land-owning system in China which was terribly poor was, thus, essential to reviving Asia, but it was also an utterly immense task. This task would require heroism and self-sacrifice on a gigantic scale. It would require superhuman compassion and a spirit of universalism.</p>
<p>In a letter to his wife Tsuchiko written a few years later in 1897, he wrote:</p>
<p>“I believe in the Way but cannot as yet merged with it. . . . Today, there are millions of poor people in the world who are crying by the side of the road. This fact is as clear as day. A compassionate man of will who shares his fate with</p>
<p>[these poor people] and fights against injustice and inequality in the world is not false, does not err, and acts out of duty; he cannot prevent himself from doing so. He is a man of sincerity who will not forget that which is just and divine.”</p>
<p>It’s one thing to identify a problem and even write about it. But, it’s quite another thing to try to do anything about it, let alone actually try to solve the problem. Tōten had little money, knew few people, and initially had no practical</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>Miyazaki Tōten and the 1911 Revolution</p>
<p>idea of what he would do. But, as we have seen before, once he decided on a plan or set his mind on an idea, he adopted it with thorough fervor. China was now the center of his thoughts. Solving the world’s social ills would have to start by solving China’s social problems. Reviving China from its present weakness and humiliation would serve as an impetus to reviving East Asia and from there the world. The key to transforming China was to overthrow the decadent Qing dynasty through a political and social revolution. And, again, revolutions demanded a heroic leader. In the 1890s, it was not at all clear who that hero was to be. Certainly, anyone associated with Qing dynasty was out, but the opposition was weak and scattered—and frankly it didn’t seem all that heroic. Yazō</p>
<p>and Tōten continued looking, however, and Yazō at one point even volunteered himself to perform the role of hero, if they were unable to locate a genuine Chinese one.</p>
<p>In the same letter to his wife that I quoted earlier, he wrote: “Resolution of the situation in East Asia will be decided by the fate of China, something known to us without input from intellectuals. Here we stand, ready to address the issue of China and then from there East Asia, the world, and society. Thus, we may for the first time be able to have full human rights and truly bring suc-cor to the poverty-stricken of the world. The situation today is such that we must thoroughly implement a portion of our ideals.”</p>
<p>There was an added poignancy to Tōten’s and his brothers’ sense of urgency about their adopted mission. At the time, Social Darwinism was becoming a widely accepted doctrine, and the idea was becoming accepted as fact that, if a humiliated country did not revive itself to power and dignity quickly, it faced the possibility of permanent extinction. The degradation to which China had fallen under Manchu rule, its victimhood in the face of the Powers’ relentless attacks, and its apparent inability to do anything right thus meant that China might, as the expression at the time put it, be carved up like a melon—and presumably gobbled up as a snack. This was a fate that the Miyazaki brothers simply could not accept. Their romantic idealism was not unusual in mid-Meiji Japan, but their internationalizing of the coming conflict and their willingness to physically throw themselves into the struggle in China was extremely rare. On the one hand, this attitude was similar to the selfless samurai tradition of Japan, but it also drew on the <em>youxia</em> tradition of the great romantic Chinese novels. They even referred to their headquarters as the Liangshanbo (J. <em>Ryōzanpaku</em>), by which they meant the hideout of the heroes of <em>Shuihuzhuan</em>.</p>
<p>One important difference between the approach of the Miyazaki brothers and that of most Japanese in the 1880s and 1890s was their willingness to join the victims. Public opinion at the time was for Japan to gain its own strength,</p>
<p>Miyazaki Tōten And The 1911 Revolution</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>independent of China, by imitating and even bettering the West at the imperialist and colonialist game. If that meant fighting wars against China and later Russia to do so, so be it! Those wars brought spoils—Taiwan, extensive rights in Manchuria, etc.—and if China was to be a victim to Japan’s self-strengthening, too bad for the Chinese! If Japan continued to be seen as one part of a rapidly declining East Asia, then it might just be gobbled up with China, Korea, Viet Nam, India, and elsewhere. Other Japanese argued that Japan was best advised to become the leader of a renascent Asia by taking control over the other parts—becoming the leader and reversing the traditional hierarchy in which China was Japan’s guide. Although this pose may have seemed as though Japan was merely leading a group of equals, it soon was clear that the followers would be second-class citizens in any Asian alliance.</p>
<p>In the face of all this, Miyazaki Tōten took an altogether different position.</p>
<p>He occasionally might work with one or another person from the two other groups I have just outlined, but he trusted none of them. His self-appointed task was to liberate the oppressed peoples of Asia—it was not service to his nation or to his emperor. At one point he took a temporary government job, but the reason was to make contact in 1897 with 孫文, not to serve his nation or state. He was a thorough internationalist before such an ideology had acquired much of a following in Japan.</p>
<p>So, Tōten decided in the early 1890s that, if he was going to become deeply involved in political and social affairs in China, he needed to learn to speak Chinese. He collected up what little remained of the money from his family for a trip to China, only to be cheated out of the money by some old “friends”</p>
<p>to whom he had lent it. It was now 1894 and he tried to work through his contact in Korea, but unfortunately that contact person was none other than Kim Ok-kyun who was murdered in a major incident at this time. So he traveled north to Hakodate which then had a Chinese community and, he thought, he might be able to find a teacher there. Unfortunately, again, most of that community had withdrawn to China when the Sino-Japanese War began that same year. Other attempts also were stymied, but the final blow came in 1896. His brother Yazō had gone to work for a Chinese company in Yokohama in 1895, tying his hair in a queue like other Chinese, and thus meeting a number of immigrant Chinese of importance, but the next year he became terribly ill and die suddenly of illness.</p>
<p>Tōten was profoundly saddened. And, he was also broke. At this very low point, he decided he might have to compromise his principles and accept employment from the Meiji state. He hated having to do this and he despised what it made him seem like to those who knew what his principles were. In a letter to his wife, he referred to himself as a <em>geisha</em>, selling his body to the rich</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>Miyazaki Tōten and the 1911 Revolution</p>
<p>and powerful: “I have, alas, become a geisha. I have received the baptism of vulgarity.” But, this was probably the most important step he would take, because this post for the Gaimushō—which he only held briefly—enabled him to meet Sun. And, now Tōten had found the hero he had long been searching for.</p>
<p>After only meeting Sun once, Miyazaki (as was typical of his character) immediately was won over. Sun was his man, the hero he had been searching for! The year was 1897, they discussed the prospects for China’s revival and the future of Asia—and that was enough for Tōten. He pinned his future and the future of Asia on Sun, making himself Sun’s disciple and assistant thereafter.</p>
<p>Sun had been having a hard time and could use all the help he could get. He was involved in a failed revolt in the Canton area in 1895, and thereafter the Qing government had put a price on his head. He desperately needed support and, of course, money, and his Japanese friends were utterly essential to him. Through Tōten and the contacts he was able to establish in high places, Sun was able to take refuge in Japan—at least for awhile. By the same token, Tōten worked overtime to make Sun widely known to the Japanese people.</p>
<p>At first, he did this, interestingly, by translating Sun’s recently published work <em>Kidnapped in London</em> into Japanese for a Fukuoka newspaper he was working for. I believe Sun wrote this book in English; it was about his secret incarceration by the Qing authorities in England, and I’m not sure what language Tōten worked from when he prepared his translation, but I believe it was a Chinese translation.</p>
<p>And, when Tōten’s own <em>Sanjūsen nen no yume</em> appeared several years later in 1902, it was quickly translated into Chinese twice, and that made Sun better known in his own native land. For five intense years from 1897, then, Tōten was deeply involved in the affairs of Sun and the Chinese revolution. While in government service in 1897, Tōten used his connections to enable Sun to legally reside outside the treaty-port community of Yokohama; according to the treaties with the foreign powers, foreigners at the time were required to live in the restricted areas of the ports.</p>
<p>The next year, 1898, Tōten was sent on a secret government mission to Canton to investigate and report back on the revolutionary movement in China. At that time Kang Youwei was in Hong Kong; Kang had only recently escaped there to avoid arrest and virtually certain execution in the wake of the disaster of the Hundred Days Reform. Tōten helped him escape to Japan and to safety. And, for the next few years, Tōten and his colleagues did everything in his power to bring Sun and Kang together—or, more precisely, to mediate between the revolutionaries and the more reform-oriented group of Chinese.</p>
<p>He also worked as Sun’s agent to make contacts with the secret societies in</p>
<p>Miyazaki Tōten And The 1911 Revolution</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>Hong Kong and South China at a time when Tōten had more freedom of movement than Sun. Because he was a Japanese national, he was able to do things and take risks that Sun would have been risking his life to do.</p>
<p>One of the intellectual bonds that Sun and Tōten shared was a transnational concern for the future of Asia as a whole. That necessitated their willingness to assist the Filipino revolutionary Emilio Aguinaldo in his fight against American imperialism. The logic was that, once the Philippine Islands were liberated, they could serve as a base to spark the revolutionary movement in China. Their efforts, as we all know, ended in complete failure. Then, they looked to Taiwan as a possible base. Taiwan had become a Japanese colony after 1895, and the Japanese presence there did not appear to constitute an obstacle to the liberation efforts in the surrounding lands. But, no sooner was the Huizhou Uprising of October 1900 set to erupt in South China, than it was betrayed by another Japanese before it really got started. Tōten was furious with his fellow Japanese, and found himself profusely apologizing to Sun.</p>
<p>This is the final episode recounted in <em>Sanjūsan nen no yume</em>, and I think you can see why Tōten, looking back on his life to that point, thought it was a complete failure. He resolved to abandon all of his grand ambitions for an Asian revolution and apprenticed himself to Tōchūken Kumoemon, the famous <em>ryōkyokushi</em>. He was ultimately no more successful as a singer.</p>
<p>As we look back on the Meiji period now a full century after it ended, we can see that there were any number of people working around the edges of society, unconnected to their government and trying to forge international ties in semi-legal fashion. As Japan rose ever greater respectability in the international arena, however, the kind of activities Tōten had been involved in—</p>
<p>including smuggling arms and laundering money to revolutionaries intent on overthrowing governments with which Japan had or was trying to establish diplomatic ties—such activities became ever more difficult and genuinely illegal. None of this would have stopped Tōten. He was himself every bit as much a revolutionary as Sun and many other Chinese revolutionaries in the years preceding the 1911 Revolution.</p>
<p>So, there he is at age 33—a complete failure in his own words. When I think back to a time when I was 33, Tōten’s life seems impossible to me. I don’t mean to compare myself to Tōten, but I am only trying to understand this extraordinary man. In his letters to his wife, Tōten is well aware of how desperately poor she is and how she and their young son, Miyazaki Ryūsuke, are suffering. And, yet, he makes no effort to change his plans, come home, and try to take care of them. On occasion he tried to help his wife find a job to support herself, but the thrust of his letters to her is to offer comforting words, words of affection</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>Miyazaki Tōten and the 1911 Revolution</p>
<p>combined with excuses about why his own call to duty would continue to keep him far from home. Tōten was committed to a higher goal—the liberation of Asia starting with the Chinese revolution—and everything else was secondary.</p>
<p>Some years later, in 1929 (seven years after Tōten’s death) when Sun’s mauso-leum was dedicated in Nanjing, Tōten’s widow recalled some of these difficult times in a memoir. She mentioned a time when she was alone with a three-year-old Ryūsuke and an infant second son Shinsaku and she wrote Tōten a letter about of the dire circumstances they were in. His response to her was that he suffered poverty, too, and their allies in the unfair world were the poor and helpless, while their enemies were the rich and powerful. Poverty, he told her, was the natural order of things. His message then was to be courageous in their shared struggle against evil in the world.</p>
<p>The picture he gives in <em>Sanjūsan nen no yume</em>, though, is a bit different. Here was find a self-pitying Tōten, lonely, often drunk, usually sharing his solitude with a prostitute at some bordello. This was not a heroic pose but one of romanticism and harsh but brutally honest self-criticism which readers in the Meiji period would probably have admired. The pose he took in his letters to his wife and the pose he took in his memoir are, thus, wholly different. Obviously, his wife could easily have read the memoir after it appeared—in fact, I’m sure that she did—and she would have seen the stark difference here, but it does not seem to have changed her opinion of him. Which was the real Miyazaki Tōten?</p>
<p>I think the answer is both. He was by turns living a heroic existence but one also plagued by failure and consonant self-doubt and self-pity. I wonder, though, if the information in his letters and in <em>Sanjūsan nen no yume</em> can both be true. There certainly is nothing new in men lying to their wives. And, if he did fabricate some of the information in his autobiography, he would not have been the first nor the last person to do so. At the same time, Tōten seems fully prepared to die a premature death, as his cause was more important and far bigger than his own small life. There seems to me to be something both admirable and a little eccentric in that. It certainly makes Tōten likable, even if the way he treated his family members is anything but likable.</p>
<p>Tōten lived first and foremost not for his family or for himself but for the noble goals he set above everything else. That stance earned him the respect of his colleagues and of the Chinese revolutionaries with whom he was in touch.</p>
<p>A moment ago I ended my discussion of his involvement with the Chinese revolution with the completion of <em>Sanjūsan nen no yume</em> in 1902 and his decision to leave politics and take up <em>ryōkyoku</em>. He soon failed at that career, but in 1905 when Japan defeated Russia in war, many thousands of Chinese students came to Japan. They wanted to study and learn the secrets to gaining the kind of strength necessary to stand up to the imperialist Western powers.</p>
<p>Miyazaki Tōten And The 1911 Revolution</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>Sun himself returned to Japan and that year helped created the organization, the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance), that eventually in 1911 was in part responsible for toppling the Qing government. Tōten together with a small number of other Japanese was present when that group was founded and he held power of attorney for it. He also helped the Chinese publish their revolutionary journal, <em>Minbao</em>, and he traveled to China later after the revolution succeeded in 1911. Although Sun was only president of the new Republic for a few months before being forced from power by Yuan Shikai, he and Tōten remained stalwart friends until Tōten died eleven years later. During that time, Tōten wrote, traveled, and endlessly praised his friend and worked tirelessly to see him returned to power.</p>
<p>I have briefly mentioned his son Ryūsuke, but as is well known he went on to attend the finest high school, Number One Senior High School, and the most prestigious university, Tokyo Imperial University, in Japan at that time. That is quite a career route for someone from an impoverished family.</p>
<p>He was helped in part by his father’s Japanese and expatriate friends. When the Chinese revolutionary Huang Xing died in Tokyo in 1916, the home he had been living in (arranged by Tōten) passed to Tōten’s care, and a few years later Ryūsuke used it as a rooming house for members of the famous organization he helped found, Shinjinkai. While Ryūsuke worked for many of the liberal and radical journals of this period, the height of Taishō democracy, he also helped visiting Chinese students who would become important figures in the young Communist movement. The most famous of these Chinese students and activists was probably Shi Cuntong. He worked assiduously through the postwar period for the betterment of Sino-Japanese relations, organizing such group as the Nihon Chūzankai which honored the memory of Sun (or Sun Zhongshan</p>
<p>[Chūzan]).</p>
<p>Finally, let me once again thank the organizers of the meeting to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the 1911 Revolution for inviting me and all of you for coming today. I mentioned at the start of my talk that I had another reason for coming to Fukuoka.</p>
