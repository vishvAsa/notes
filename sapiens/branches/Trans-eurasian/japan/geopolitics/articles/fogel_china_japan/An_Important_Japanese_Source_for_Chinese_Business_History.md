In the course of recent research on the early history of the Japanese community of Shanghai, I came across a source of prospective interest to anyone concerned with Chinese business history in the nineteenth century. It was a monthly publication entitled Shanhai shōgyō zappō \(Shanghai commercial reports\), published in Shanghai by the “Shanhai shōdōkai” \(Shanghai commercial association\) between July 1882 and October 1883. Initially it appeared monthly, with the last few issues coming less frequently. Little is known about the publishing group or about the editor, Oka Masayasu, who was also the sec-retary of the “Shanhai shōdōkai.” Offices were first listed at Number 7 Jiangxi Road in the British Concession but soon moved to the grounds of the Mitsui Bussan Company at Number 11 Sichuan Road. This was, significantly, the first serial published by the Japanese community of Shanghai. 

The paper was published in a current early- to mid-Meiji style of unpunctuated Japanese, relatively easy to read. The Japanese community at the time numbered only a few hundred, most of them businessmen \(aside from the still prominent group of Japanese prostitutes in the burgeoning international port, who presumably had nothing to do with this serial\). As the first article in its first issue makes clear, it was aimed at describing business conditions in China \(not just Shanghai\) for the Japanese there—and for those back on the home islands who did business with the continent. Agencies sold it in Tokyo, Osaka, Nagasaki, and Hakodate as well as in Shanghai. 

When the idea for the organization which published Shanhai shōgyō zappō 

was suggested to Shanghai Consul-General Shinagawa Tadamichi in December 1879, he heartily supported it. This offers another interesting glimpse of the symbiotic relationship between the consulate and nascent business concerns at the time, a topic that has been developed by a number of Japanese scholars who have worked on the subject. The paper’s statement of purpose included describing commercial conditions, goods and quantities available, prices, etc., all over China. 

One fascinating article in the second issue entitled “Shina tsūshō ron” 

\(“On trade with China”\) by Enami Tetsuo offers an evaluation which gives us a good sense of where on the political spectrum this journal saw itself. Enami

An Important Japanese Source for Chinese Business History

notes that in the old “barbaric age,” if a person or state wanted something in another’s possession, they simply stole it and killed as necessary. But, in the present “civilized age,” bun \(Chinese, wen\) had transcended bu \(Chinese, wu\), and the expansion of trade represented one such civilized mode of behavior. 

In the past the road to wealth and power was warfare, but now, trade and commerce had become the equitable modes of operation. Enami points to the 1871 Sino-Japanese treaty and the flourishing trade it has, in his opinion, reaped. He does note in passing that many Chinese remain arrogant in their relations with others, but the implication is that the practice will pass with time. This attitude seems fully in keeping with the “Civilization and Enlightenment” mode of early Meiji Japan, here applied to foreign trade and international relations. 

Articles in Shanhai shōgyō zappō  include translations from the English-language press of Shanghai, such as Shanghai Mercury,   and translations of all the major treaties recently concluded between the powers and China. None of this is terribly interesting in and of itself. What is interesting and of considerable use to scholars are the numerous tables and charts of imports and exports of countless products, the listings of ships \(sail and steam\) by country calling at the port of Shanghai, the great detail on such items as coal, tea, and other products \(and their sub-varieties\) which we now know were elemental to the international trade of nineteenth-century Shanghai. Also, the Shanghai market prices on a long list of goods are given in tabular form, as are shipping and storage costs. 

Shanhai shōgyō zappō  disappeared without a trace in the fall of 1883 and is rarely mentioned today even in histories of the Shanghai press. Its last issue carried a story on the Chinese huiguan \(Landsmannschaft\) system which its author saw as a force for commercial cohesion among Chinese of the same province; he notes as well that Shanghai had a full panoply of huiguan  and offers a description-translation of the rules and regulations of the Guangdong huiguan  of Shanghai. The careful reader may detect a note of envy that Japanese merchants lacked such solidity away from home. 

Several pages later the journal disappeared forever. It can now be found at Hitotsubashi University Library and the Meiji shinbun zasshi bunko at Tokyo University.
