I think it would be safe to say that not only is the academic organization of Japanese and Western sinology \(as well as numerous other fields in the humanities and social sciences\) different but the two are virtually incommensurate. Whereas in the United States, Canada, Australia, and Western Europe, young academic novices are sent out to find their own topics that have “never been done” \(or done poorly\) and thus stake their claim to a place in the “field” 

on the basis of an “original” contribution at such a relatively early age, their counterparts in Japan enter the mainstream usually by joining ongoing mul-tigenerational research or study groups \(variously dubbed kenkyūkai  研究会, kenkyūhan  研究班, kyōdō kenkyū  共同研究, and the like\)—some of which meet regularly for years—slowly learning their trade through contacts with their peers and elders and subsequently with those younger than they. This latter process, especially in research on premodern Chinese humanities, often involves reading especially difficult texts as a group, possibly annotating and punctuating them for the first time, and then often publishing them also as a group effort in modern Japanese, Chinese with Japanese reading punctuation, or both. This practice has been going on at Kyoto University, for example, for nearly a century. The Japanese system, then, as a rule does not lay primary stress on articulating an independent position at a comparatively early stage in one’s career, but delays that gratification until one reaches what those of us in the West would consider mid-career. 

This system might be crushing to a young person who has something distinctive to say and must constantly defer to his academic superiors, men

and women who control the sources to fund research groups and access to participation in them. While such an argument may make some logical sense, in nearly thirty years of contact and involvement with a host of such academic I study groups I have rarely seen it happen. Democracy seldom plays a role in academic dealings anywhere in the world, and in this regard Japan is no exception.1

The academic brokers in Japanese sinology are also the first people approached by publishing houses when the latter wish to put out compilations or collections of one sort or another, and the former usually tap the members of their research groups and the coterie of their past students to fulfill such a task. By the same token, these same brokers tend to be the ones with enough cachet in the academic and publishing worlds to approach publishing houses about various multiauthor projects. In fact, it is the usual practice for a research group to come to an end by publishing at least a collection of selected essays from the ongoing work of its constituents. One does frequently see publication of multivolume compilations of resources on Chinese history and culture, such as series of comprehensive histories \(with multiple authors\), encyclopedias and dictionaries, source collections often with annotations and reprints of original Chinese materials, and a wealth of annotated translations of primary materials—all far too extensive to list here but nonetheless indispensable to all scholars in the field of Chinese studies. Recent years alone have witnessed exceptionally important collections in all of these areas, often \(although by no means always\) the end result of group research projects. This is anything but the trend in the West, with a number of notable exceptions, such as the Cambridge History of China \(which has been appearing for more than a quarter century and still has at least three more volumes set to materialize\) and the Science and Civilisation in China series from the Needham Research Institute at Cambridge University—both, interestingly, coming out of Great Britain, though with contributors from elsewhere as well. 

The philosophy behind all of this group activity in Japan is, of course, that everyone benefits from everyone else’s work on a joint project. This rarely works well in a society that prizes and rewards individualism above all else. If, for example, an individual were to set out to read all the important newspapers and journals of the late Qing and early Republican periods, that would constitute an overwhelming task requiring a half dozen years or more. With a group, though, these serials might be divided up and their contents reported on at regular meetings, a process that would ensure that now ten or fifteen scholars 1 One is reminded of the following riddle: Q: What is the difference between a tenured professor and a terrorist? A: You can negotiate with a terrorist. 

Tackling the Translation of an Invaluable Primary Source 227

would share all the information unearthed by their collective work. While others are doing the reporting, one can devote one’s time to other research work, perhaps in other study groups. I heard several years ago of one group at Kyoto University that met for over ten years to read and discuss jointly a vernacular Daoist work from the Six Dynasties period. The end result was a punctuated, annotated edition of this hitherto little-known text now made available to a larger—although admittedly still rather circumscribed—scholarly audience. 

The general academic direction I have outlined above fits the mold of the Kyoto area more closely than it does the Tokyo region \(or any other, for that matter\). There are many such groups on the Kantō Plain, but in the Kansai they in fact form the centerpiece of academic life, from graduate school to retirement. It is thus no surprise to find that the extraordinary work under review here is the product of Kyoto University faculty and students ranging in age \(as of 2005\) from twenty-seven to early eighties \(born in 1917 and now deceased\). 

Shortly after his retirement from the faculty of Kyoto University, the late Professor Shimada Kenji \(d. 2000\) privately organized a research group there to translate the long chronological biography of Liang Qichao \(1873–1929\)—

arguably the most important figure of the late Qing period—which was initially compiled decades ago by Ding Wenjiang \(1887–1936\) and Zhao Fengtian \(1906–1980\). There was at this time a research group at the same university that was beginning to examine the impact of Japan and the Japanese on Liang’s thinking and writing. Liang spent over a decade in Japan during his most formative and productive years following the collapse of the Hundred Days Reform Movement of 1898. The latter group was organized by Hazama Naoki 狭間直樹 \(b. 1937\), then a professor at Kyoto University’s Institute for Research in the Humanities and also a member of Shimada’s team. Hazama’s group would meet every two weeks for the next four years before publishing an indispensable collection of essays: Kyōdō kenkyū, Ryō Keichō: Seiyō kindai shisō 

juyō to Meiji Nihon  共同研究，梁啓超：西洋近代思想受容と明治日本 

\(Group research on Liang Qichao: The reception of modern Western thought and Meiji Japan\) \(Tokyo: Misuzu Shobō, 1999\). It was promptly translated into Chinese and published as Liang Qichao, Mingzhi Riben, Xifang: Riben Jingdu Daxue Renwen Kexue Yanjiusuo gongtong yanjiu baogao  梁啟超，明 治日

Tackling the Translation of an Invaluable Primary Source

I was fortunate enough to be present in 1993 at one of the early meetings of Professor Shimada’s parallel translation group. He had amassed a group of eight or nine committed scholars who understood that translating the 1,200-plus pages of the definitive 1983 edition of Liang’s chronological biography was to be a long-term and difficult effort; it ultimately consumed over a decade, and Shimada did not live to see it completed or published. However, no one was likely to pass up the utterly extraordinary opportunity to work so closely with a man so revered in sinological circles both in Japan and abroad. 

Shimada certainly had his scholarly opponents, some of them fine scholars in their own right, but few commanded such widespread authority and respect. 

At that early meeting, one young scholar \(then thirty years old and an assistant to Professor Hazama\) presented his draft translation of one of the early sections of the text. Shimada listened patiently, following along with a printed text of the draft distributed in advance to the members of the group. When the young man was done, Shimada politely suggested that it might better be translated in such-and-such a way, and then from his mouth there flowed forth the most extraordinarily elegant and most mellifluous modern literary Japanese that I have ever heard. It was a sight and sound to behold, in large part because it marked a quantum leap in the respective educational backgrounds of the constituent members of the research group. People just don’t learn to compose prose like that any more. 

In addition to Shimada and Hazama, the other members of the group included Inami Ryōichi 井波陵一 \(b. 1953\), Kyoto University; Mori Tokihiko 森時彦 \(b. 1947\), Kyoto University; Eda Kenji 江田憲治 \(b. 1955\), then at Kyoto Sangyō University, now at Kyoto University; Ishikawa Yoshihiro 石川

禎浩 \(b. 1963\), Kyoto University; Okamoto Takashi 岡本隆司 \(b. 1965\), Kyoto Prefectural University; Takashima Kō 高島航 \(b. 1970\), Kyoto University; Murakami Ei 村上衛 \(b. 1973\), Kyoto University; and Hayakawa Atsushi 早川

敦 \(b. 1978\), graduate student, Kyoto University. Murakami, Takashima, and Hayakawa were not members of the original team. As a first draft of the translation was nearing completion in the year following Shimada’s death, Yang Tianshi and Sang Bing 桑兵 \(b. 1956\), a brilliant young professor of modern Chinese history from Zhongshan University in Guangzhou, were invited at different times to Kyoto to help decipher the countless and often highly obscure literary references, pen names or literary sobriquets of men mentioned in the text, and other difficult textual points. Jin Chongji helped in a similar manner while serving as a visiting professor at Kyoto University. This aspect of the translation is practically worth the price of admission, so to speak; there are numerous instances in which individuals’ names are given by a highly obscure 

Tackling the Translation of an Invaluable Primary Source 229

secondary or tertiary pseudonym, and the translators have tracked most of these down, pen names not found in any ordinary biographical dictionary. 

The completed Japanese edition of Liang Qichao’s chronological biography contains a translation of the entire Chinese original, incorporating the notes and all the front and back matter included by the Chinese compilers; numerous additional notes of many and sundry sorts added by the translators; bibliographies of works in Chinese, Japanese, and Western languages; a comprehensive index to all five volumes of the translation; indexes for Chinese, Japanese, and Western personal names; a twenty-five-page “explanatory postface” \( kaisetsu 解説\) by Hazama; and a shorter “afterward” \( atogaki  あとがき \) by Inami. 

In the end, the 1,200-plus pages of the original Chinese text turn into over 2,500 pages of Japanese. The entire project is daunting in the extreme—not the least because of its astronomical price, nearly $450 at today’s rate of exchange. 

In addition to a discussion of how the translation was executed, a review of a translated text should say something about the worthiness of the work itself as well as the quality of the translation. As noted above, in the estimation of virtually every scholar working on the late Qing period, Liang Qichao looms extremely large in Chinese political and intellectual history. He virtually invented the Chinese political press single-handedly and helped create its quasi-modern language. He knew or came into contact with almost every reformer, revolutionary, and their opponents as well as innumerable scholars in both China and Japan. His writings set the tone and level of numerous political and scholarly debates at the turn of the last century. Nevertheless, little from his collected writings, Yinbingshi heji 飲冰室合集 \(Collected works from the ice-drinker’s studio\), has yet to be translated into English. Only two book-length works have appeared: his history of Qing thought, Qingdai xueshu gailun 清代學術概論 \(Outlines of scholarship in the Qing period\), which could use updating, although it remains an excellent point of departure, and his history of early Chinese philosophy, Xian Qin zhengzhi sixiang shi  先秦政治思想史 

\(History of pre-Qin political thought\), which could use serious updating.2

Tackling the Translation of an Invaluable Primary Source

Will a Japanese translation of Liang’s chronological biography improve the situation? There are numerous Chinese works in Japanese translation that have existed for decades and that have been assiduously ignored by Western scholars. Indeed, some texts have been translated so often that it has become difficult in Japan to teach classical Chinese using them; students run to use the easily available translations rather than struggle with the originals. For the modern era, however, how will a translation of this particular work into Japanese help us? I would argue that if we are serious as scholars about what we do and if we approach the world of scholarly endeavor as an international and collaborative project, then it must be viewed even from our limited, myopic line or vision as a great and unexpected blessing. How so? 

Everyone who works primarily in the late Qing period, especially those in intellectual and cultural history, has had to make use of Liang’s nianpu.  

There is simply no avoiding it. Liang knew so many people and had contact through the mail with so many more that he virtually lived the period itself. 

Easier access to Liang’s chronological biography pushes the scholarly bar one level up. Before assessing samples of the translation itself, two other points about the work recommend it to all scholars of the period. Insofar as they were able, the translators have checked the numerous quotations in the entries against the originals. Thus, for example, the editors frequently support a statement about Liang’s life with a paragraph or two from one of a number of contemporaneous documents. In a number of instances, Ding and Feng inserted incorrect characters into the texts. These have been meticulously sorted out—

to the extent possible. In addition, the translators have included notes clarify-ing that the language used in the extensive citations from documents of the period reflects the usage of the time.3

Are the difficulties with the original Chinese text reduced or eliminated with the appearance of this translation? Let’s take three concrete examples \(drawn from three different sorts of material\) from three different decades in Liang’s life and parse them. The text of Liang’s nianpu is organized in a fairly uncomplicated manner. 

The editors give a simple sentence or two of explanation and then offer as evidence usually a selection from one of his letters or newspaper articles, sometimes a government document such as an imperial edict, or someone else’s letter to him or a piece of writing about him or his activities.

Tackling the Translation of an Invaluable Primary Source 231

Let us look first at an early entry, one from late 1898, shortly after Liang reached Japan in the wake of the failed Reform Movement \(p. 169 in the original—all Chinese citations have been returned to fantizi  繁體字\). 

先生初到東京時，住牛込區馬場下町.楊維新與丁文江書，記當時和

日人往來情形説：

初到東京時，似系住牛込區馬場下町（原住待查\),當時大隈左

法為任公先生著\) 彼時事，弟非目見不能詳言.\(“楊維新與丁在

君書”\)

In this instance neither the introductory passage by the compilers nor the letter provided as evidence is itself terribly difficult. The Japanese translation \(vol. 1, pp. 288–289\) reads as follows:

先生は東京に着いた当初、牛込区馬場下町に住んでいた。楊

維新「丁在君あての書簡」

And my own English translation follows:

When Liang first arrived in Tokyo, he was living in Baba Shitamachi, Ushigome Ward. In a letter to Ding Wenjiang, Yang Weixin noted his various associations with Japanese at the time and went on to write: When \[Liang Rengong\] first arrived in Tokyo, he seems to have taken up residence in Baba Shitamachi, Ushigome Ward \(which was under surveillance—note in original\). Not only did Inukai Tsuyoshi, Takada Sanae, and Kashiwabara Buntaro \(Liang was particularly close to this man, 

232

Tackling the Translation of an Invaluable Primary Source

having concluded a fictive kinship bond with him—note in original\), all intimate associates of Ōkuma Shigenobu, frequently visit him there at the time, but they were energetically teaching him Japanese grammar. 

\(The Hewen Handu fa \[Reading Japanese the Chinese way\] was a work by Liang—note in original\). I did not directly witness this myself at the time, and thus I cannot speak about it in great detail. \(Yang Weixin, “Letter to Ding Zaijun”\)

As noted above, the original Chinese is not particularly challenging in this instance. Then, what added value does the annotated Japanese translation offer us now? First of all, there were two errors in the Chinese original that the Japanese rendition simply fixed without so much as a mention: the character zhu 住 in the first “note in original” should be zhu 注, as it is given for the second and third such “notes”; and the first character of Kashiwabara Buntarō’s name is given incorrectly as 栢 instead of 柏. Neither of these errors earth-shatteringly changes the meaning beyond all repair. But, errors are errors. 

Second, the Japanese translation has a number of additional annotations. 

One such note \(no. 274, p. 410\) traces all of the residences Liang took up in his first months in Japan, using Japanese government archives, and is able to confirm one address—given slightly earlier in a Minbao essay cited in the nianpu \(see p. 278\)—but the address given here that was, according to the original note, “under surveillance” could not be confirmed. In any event, “Baba Shitamachi” is now located in Shinjuku Ward. 

Third, two of the added Japanese notes \(nos. 273 and 275, p. 410\) fill in details on the names given in this letter. We learn that Yang Weixin \(Dingfu 鼎甫\) was also from Guangdong; he studied at the Datong School in Yokohama and later \(June 1909\) graduated from the Teacher Training Course at Waseda University. 

In another we learn that Kashiwabara Buntarō \(1869–1936\) of Chiba Prefecture graduated from the Tōkyō Senmon School \(forerunner of Waseda University\), received the Ōkuma Prize for his excellent schoolwork, and then took up a post on the board of trustees there when it became Waseda. In 1898 with the founding of the Tō-A Dōbunkai 東亞同文學 \(East Asian Common Culture Association\), he became one of its supervisors and played host to Kang Youwei 康有為 \(1858–1927\) and Liang when they took refuge in Japan several weeks before the information in this entry took effect. 

Finally, we are directed to a footnote concerning the Hewen Handu fa \(no. 3, p. 413\), which provides considerable information on this fascinating and little-known text \(more like a crib sheet of sorts\) for Chinese wishing to acquire a reading knowledge of Japanese in a hurry. It was composed by Liang and 

Tackling the Translation of an Invaluable Primary Source 233

Luo Xiaogao 羅孝高 \(Luo Jin 羅晉\), another Cantonese and disciple of Kang Youwei, studying at Waseda from before the 1898 Reform Movement. 

Does the addition of this information make the Japanese translation worth our attention? I think there can be little doubt of this. Does it merit the purchase of the Ryō Keichō nenpu chōhen at its hefty price? Perhaps not for individuals whose native language is not Japanese, but for libraries it is certainly a must-buy. Interestingly, I suspect that probably every Japanese who works on this period in Chinese history will buy it despite the price, a fact known intimately by the marketing and editorial staff at Iwanami Shoten, a publishing house not in the business of academic charity. 

For the sake of clarity and potential interest, let us now open the original Chinese text \(1983 edition\) randomly—and in the middle of page 696, we find the following entry within the year 1914:

九月間,先生曾致湯覺頓一書,可見他當日求去不得的困難情形:

前示敬悉,尊恙乃爾綿惙,真所不解,比復何如耶？請假事果

如公所料,不見派代理,且僅許半月,究當改以何法求自脱,公

宜為我熟思之。萬不獲免,擬請改為學術的,更其名曰研究會, 

公謂如何？亦望與季常一商 之。

On the surface, the opening sentence is, as usual, fairly straightforward, and few scholars will even need to avail themselves of a dictionary: “In the ninth lunar month of the year \[ca. October 1914\], Liang sent a letter to Tang Juedun from which we can discern that at that time he \[Tang\] was in a difficult situation having sought to take a leave of absence but having not been permitted to do so.” 

The only real problem this sentence might pose is the identity of Tang Juedun, who, it turns out, is Tang Rui 湯叡 \(1878–1916\), as a handy footnote added by the Japanese translators makes clear. He was a figure in reformist politics and also a disciple of Kang Youwei—and, like both Kang and Liang, a native of Guangdong Province; he later fled with them to Japan after the failure of the Hundred Days Reform, returning only after the 1911 Revolution. 

He served in early Republican governments in various economic posts, before falling afoul of Yuan Shikai and being assassinated by a local militarist. The Japanese translation renders this first sentence in the same crisp, clear-cut style \(vol. 3, p. 397\):

九月、先生は湯覺頓\[湯叡\]に書簡を送った。当時、彼が辞職

を願っても許されない困難な状況にいたことが分かる。

234

Tackling the Translation of an Invaluable Primary Source

No problems so far. The difficulties arise with the citation from Liang’s letter itself, which is written in an altogether different style, accessible without a dictionary only to old pros, and with a dictionary to a handful more who have reasonably good sinological training. To be sure, scholars have been using Liang’s nianpu  for many years. However, passages such as this one, which can be replicated for its difficulty hundreds of times in this text, are precisely the sort of stumbling blocks for Western historians and social scientists who work on the late Qing and twentieth-century China, those of us whose sinological skills are not as well-honed as they might be. 

Before slugging it out with an effort at rendering this part of the nianpu entry into English, let us look at how the Japanese translators deal with it: 前のお手紙、敬んで拝読いたしました。あなたの御病気がそ

こまで危ないものだったとは、まったく知りませんでした。 

近ごろはいかがで しょうか。休暇願の件ですが、あなたのお

考えのようにすると、代理が任命されません。半月ほど休暇

をもらえるのが関の山です。結局どんな方法に改めて逃げ出

す道を求めたらいいのか、私のためによくよく お考えになっ

て下さい。どうしても辞めさせてもらえなかったら、学術的

なものに改め、名称を研究会に変更することを願い出るつも

りで す。あなたはいかが思われますか。季常ともー度御相談

いただきたいと存じます。

Not only does the Japanese capture the meaning of the original, along with nuances and confusions, I would argue, but also, like all good translations, it helps us to read the original itself. It hones closely to the Chinese text without falling into the trap of being too literal a translation. As an experiment, let us translate the Japanese and then go back to the Chinese, the way we might if we came to a difficult passage in the original and took refuge in a translation into our own mother tongue:

I respectfully read your recent letter. I had no idea that your illness had progressed to such a state. How have you been lately? As concerns your request for a leave of absence, if we do as you suggest, a replacement will not be appointed. 

The best one can hope for is about half a month’s leave. Please give some careful thought to my situation and what route we should take to avoid this impasse. 

If in the end I am not allowed to step down, I plan to change \[our organization\] into \[an\] academic one and to apply to change its name to the 

Tackling the Translation of an Invaluable Primary Source 235

“Research Group.” Do you have any thoughts about this? I want you to discuss this with Jichang, too. 

Not at all clear on who “Jichang” might be, I consulted one of several name indexes at the back of volume 5 of the Japanese translation, and there I discovered that “Jichang” was a sobriquet for Jian Nianyi 蹇念益 \(1878–1930\), who hailed from Guizhou, studied at Waseda University from 1902, returned to China after the advent of the Republic, and became involved in politics and later scholarship in the early Republican period. 

Looking back now at the original Chinese text, it slowly but surely appears to be less and less thorny. First-glance difficulties in the original begin to clear up, and truly tough passages begin to jump off the page. The serious student of this text can then go back and look at these places more closely in the original, and possibly learn some Chinese usages in this way \(indeed, s/he may find, on occasion, that the translation is in error\). In addition, those places where the text appears to be a bit obscure in the original remain so in the Japanese translation: “I plan to change \[our organization\] into \[an\] academic one and to apply to change its name to the ‘Research Group.’ ” 

Finally, let us now move to the final entry in the nianpu, an obituary for Liang from a possibly surprising source. First, the Chinese original \(pp. 1210– 

1212\), with apologies for its length:

As it turns out, this entry was originally published in Englisn in the “Personal” 

column under “Historical News” in the April 1929 issue of the American Historical Review.  I give that note as it appeared in the original AHR with a small number of bracketed comments for clarification:

Tackling the Translation of an Invaluable Primary Source

Concerning \[his\] foreign influence once again, the following was said in the “Personal” \[section\] of the American “Historical News”: Liang Ch’i-ch’ao \[Liang Qichao\] died January 19 in Peking, at the age of 56. Early in life he was associated with the late K’ang Yu-wei \[Kang Youwei\] in initiating the reforms that ended in the collapse of \[the\] 

Manchu régime in 1911. In 1898, at the age of 25, he wrote a memorial advocating revolutionary reforms in the \[civil service\] examination system, thus paving the way for its final abolition in 1905. In the coup d’état of 1898, he lived in exile for some years, writing on political reform through the medium of periodicals which he edited. After the establishment of the Republic \[of China in 1911\], he devoted himself more exclusively to teaching, lecturing, and writing on historical subjects; his activities in the political field being confined to the founding of the Chin Pu Tang 

\[Jinbudang, or Progressive Party\], and more recently the Yen Chiu Hsi 

\[Yanjiuxi, or Research Clique\]—two parties which advocated more moderate views than those held by Sun Yat-sen and the Kuo Min Tang 

\[Guomindang, or Nationalist Party\]. 

Mr. Liang was greatly influenced by two revolutionary works of his teacher, K’ang Yu-wei, “The Forged Classics of the Wang Mang Period” 

\( Hsin Hsüeh Wei Ching K’ao\) \[Xinxue weijing Kao; lit., Studies of the forged classics in the Xin dynasty\]\), and “Confucius’s Programme of Reform” 

\( K’ung-tzu Kai Chih K’ao\) \[Kongzi gaizhi kao; lit., Studies of Confucius as an institutional reformer\]\)—two works which may be said to have set in motion the whole Chinese historical criticism of our day. He was a stalwart defender of Chin Wen \[Jinwen\], or \[the\] ‘modern text’ school which holds that not a few doubtful texts of antiquity were forged by Liu Xin, for political reasons, in the first decade of the Christian era. The intensive study which both K’ang Yu-wei and Liang Ch’i-ch’ao had made of the so-called ‘Han school’ of historical criticism \(of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries\), together with what they had learned of the Western approach, made them the natural founders of a revival of the present-day intellectual renaissance, especially on its historical side. 

The latest edition of Liang Ch’i-ch’ao’s “Collected Writings” \( Yin Ping Shih Wen Chi \[Yinbingshi wenji, Collected writings from the ice-drinker’s studio\]\) appeared in 1927 in eighty volumes. Some scholarly contributions were published separately; the three in which he took the greatest pride being: “Methods of Investigating Chinese History” \( Chung Kuo Li Shih Yen Chiu Fa \[Zhongguo lishi yanjiu fa; published in 1922—

note in Chinese text\]\); “Critical Scholarship during the Ch’ing Dynasty” 

\( Chi’ing Tai Hsüeh She Kai Lun \[Qingdai xueshu gailun, also known as 

Tackling the Translation of an Invaluable Primary Source 239

Intellectual Trends of the Qing Period\]\), and “Chinese Political Thought Prior to the Ch’in Dynasty” \( Hsien Ch’in Cheng Chih Ssu Hsiang Shih \[Xian Qin zhengzhi sixiang shi; published in 1923—note in Chinese text\]\), all published in 1911 and 1912; the last is translated into French. One of his most recent works, “Methods of Studying the Important Classical Books” 

\( Yao Chi Chieh T’i Chi Ch’ii Tu Fa \[Yaoji jieti ji qi dufa\]\) affords the best summary of the present-day criticism of the great ancient books that has yet appeared. At the time of his death he was engaged on a vast “Cultural History of China” \( Chung Kuo Wen Hua Shih \[ Zhongguo wenhua shi\]\) of which only parts have appeared in print. 

In a little autobiographical sketch entitled, “On Reaching the Age of Thirty” \[“Sanshi zishu”\], Mr. Liang remarked, “Prior to my visit to Shanghai at the age of eighteen, when a world atlas for the first time fell into my hands, I did not know of the existence of the five continents. 

\(When I visited Shanghai on the way home after having failed in the civil service examination, I purchased in the market and read the Yinghuan zhilüe 瀛環志略 \[A brief survey of the maritime circuit\], and for the first time I came to understand that there were various countries in the five continents\)”—so reads Liang Qichao’s original text \(note of Chinese translator\). And yet this young man, by extraordinary mental resiliency and an inimitable literary style, captured the intellectual leadership of all China, and retained it till he died. This ability to change with the times, manifested in his literary style as well as in ms ideas, may be attributed, perhaps, to the strict self-application of a motto which he often quoted to others: “Do not hesitate to let your self of to-day pronounce judgment on your self of yesterday.” \(Translated \[into Chinese for the nianpu\] by Liang Sizhuang 梁思莊 \[Liang’s daughter\] from the American Historical Review 34 \[April 1929\], pp. 670–671.\)

What, then, do we gain by having this new Japanese translation when the original is itself mostly from an English source? First, again, there is the question of errors in the Chinese text. The translation by Liang’s second daughter and fifth child, Liang Sizhuang \(1908–1986\), of the somewhat stilted English in the AHR piece takes a certain amount of license with the original. At one point the English reads: “In the coup d’état of 1898, he lived in exile for some years, writing on political reform through the medium of periodicals which he edited.” 

This phrasing sounds sufficiently innocuous to offend no one, but apparently Ms. Liang wanted a touch more excitement in her father’s early years. 

The Chinese text \(在一八 九八年的政變中,他險些喪失生命,以後幾年, 

他過着流亡生活. 在此期間, 他撰寫宣傳政治改革的文章, 登在他擔任

240

Tackling the Translation of an Invaluable Primary Source

編輯刊物上\) would more appropriately be rendered: “In the 1898 coup d’état, he found himself in dire straits nearly losing his life, and for several years thereafter he lived in wandering exile. During this period he wrote essays promoting the theme of political reform and contributed to periodicals which he himself edited.” In this instance the Japanese offers a faithful translation of the Chinese—and not the English original. 

Second, the Japanese text provides a citation from Liang’s Qingdai xueshu gailun \(chapter 26\), for the quotation from Liang for the final sentence of this entry in his nianpu.  It is the famous chapter in the book \(p. 103 in Immanuel C.Y. Hsü’s English translation\) in which Liang speaks of himself in the third person and compares himself to his mentor, Kang Youwei. 

Third, and most important, are the additional data offered by the Japanese translators in the form of notes. For example, the beginning of the third paragraph about the “latest edition” of Liang’s collected writings \(as of 1929, the year of his death\) notes that such a work appeared in eighty fascicles in 1927. In fact, we learn \(vol. 5, p. 436 n. 44\) that this is a reference to the Yichou chongbian Yinbingshi wenji  乙丑重編飲冰室文集 \(Collected essays from the ice-drinker’s studio, revised edition of 1925\), which was published, as the title indicates, in the “yichou” year, 1925, by Zhonghua Shuju 中華書局. 

The Japanese edition also mentions details of the 1926 French translation of Liang’s Xian Qin zhengzhi sixiang shi of 1923. It notes that this French text is listed in the Catalogue des principaux ouvrages sortis des presses Lazaristes à Pékin de 1864 à 1930, compiled by Joseph  van den Brandt \(Beijing: Henri Vetch, 1933\). It should be noted that there is as well a copy in the library of the University of California, Berkeley, from whose online catalog some of this information is derived. 

Finally, the translators note that the material in the final paragraph of the nianpu entry from Liang’s autobiographical essay, “Sanshi zishu,” can be found in full, back in a much earlier entry, the first one for 1890 \(vol. 1, p. 56; p. 22 

of the original\). Perhaps the final sentence of that entry—also from “Sanshi zishu”—would help clarify the moment in Liang’s life when he first came to Shanghai: “My eyes caught sight of works translated and published by the Jiangnan Arsenal in Shanghai. Although very interested in them, I didn’t have the luxury to buy any.” 

I have tried in this review to indicate the ways in which this monumental new source may help those of us for whom Japanese is not our native language. 

That is, you don’t have to be a native Japanophone to find and appreciate the utility of this extraordinary translation. In fact, you probably do not even have to possess particularly stellar Japanese—although it would not hurt to try—to be able selectively to make use of this work. 

Tackling the Translation of an Invaluable Primary Source 241

At the same time, unfortunately, it will probably be many moons before such an important text sees the light of day in English \(or any other Western language\), the result of a rather narrow-minded scholarly and publishing world that accepts translations of literature, although often grudgingly, but oddly discourages translations of scholarly texts, save those written by great names. 

In this instance, filthy lucre remains the driving force. Of course, money lies at the foundation of Japanese publishing, too; the difference is that a large and powerful academic press like Iwanami can easily expect to make back its investment through library and individual sales. Even as book prices rise to stratospheric heights, individual scholars in Japan continue to buy them, despite individual protests; were that not the case, either Iwanami and other such presses would certainly fold, or they would more likely stop publishing books like this one. 

Until Western academic publishers start publishing such translations and translations are given their due in academia, I am afraid we will all be better off learning Japanese.

**Introduction: Liang Qichao and Japan**

During the summer of 1993, I attended some of the initial monthly meetings of Professor Hazama Naoki’s research seminar at Kyoto University. Breaking with custom, he had selected a Sino-Japanese theme, rather than a strictly Chinese historical one, for the subsequent three-year period: the role of Japan as an intermediary in Liang Qichao’s \(1873–1929\) understanding of modern Western civilization. While this was not an altogether new theme—everyone knew that Liang had spent more than a decade in Japan, beginning with his exile there in 1898, had written voluminously while there, and had certainly been influenced by the experience—the precise nature and actual mode of that influence had not been clearly delineated nor by any means fully understood. 

We knew that Liang read many Japanese books that “influenced” him; we knew that he popularized countless two-character Chinese expressions thought to have been coined in Japanese in his serial publications; and we had an idea that he learned much of what he did about the West through Japanese translations of Western works. However, direct connections remained murky at best. Three biographical studies of Liang had already appeared in English and a fourth was soon to come out, but even in Philip Huang’s excellent work— 

the most sophisticated in treating the Japanese connection—this linkage was still vague.1

I was therefore fascinated to hear these early seminar presentations in Kyoto that summer and the next. During the academic year 1996–97, as visiting professor at Kyoto University’s Research Institute for the Humanities, I was privileged to participate for a full year, the final extended year, in the seminar. 

The experience was both mind opening and exhilarating. Liang Qichao will never appear the same.

Introduction: Liang Qichao and Japan

243

It struck me that, because of an abiding interest in Liang Qichao and the entire generation of the 1898 Reform Movement in the West,2 the timing was right to organize an international conference to address the very topic Professor Hazama had taken up but with the addition of Western and Chinese scholars. With funding from the Japan Foundation and the Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange, we were able to invite to Santa Barbara, California, eight Japanese scholars \(five from the original research group in the Kyoto area and three from the Tokyo area\), two scholars from Taiwan, one scholar from the People’s Republic of China, one from Australia, one from France, and one from the United States. In addition, we were fortunate enough to have six bilingual or effectively bilingual commentators. The result was a highly successful international symposium. 

The one serious problem confronting an editor of essays from a genuinely international conference is the challenge of having the non-English-language papers translated into readable, scholarly English with all the scholarly apparatus required on this side of the Pacific. That, we believe, has been achieved, though it has taken two solid years of working and reworking the East Asian-language contributions. In the interim, the final papers from Professor Hazama’s seminar have appeared: Kyōdō kenkyū: Ryō Keichō, Seiyō kindai shisō 

juyō to Meiji Nihon \(Collaborative research on Liang Qichao: Meiji Japan and the reception of modern Western thought\).3 Translations of the Japanese text have already been published in Chinese as well.4 The present collection of essays makes an excellent companion volume to Hazama’s, be it in the Japanese original or in Chinese translation. 

A number of interconnected themes link the essays in this volume to one another and to the overarching theme of Liang and Meiji Japan. In light of the voraciousness with which Liang consumed the writings to which he was exposed in Japan, it is important to note that he came at a specific time and with a specific agenda of his own that strongly conditioned the nature of his experience there. Liang had left China, as we know, under extraordinary circumstances. There was a price on his head, the same price for which a number 2  Most recently, see Peter Zarrow and Rebecca E.

or his colleagues paid with their lives back in China. With the reform movement to which he had assiduously devoted himself in shambles, he reached Japan with a burning sense of crisis for his homeland. China under the Empress Dowager \(1835–1908\) was on the verge of collapse, he believed, and unless various political, social, and cultural reforms were enacted, he feared for demise of Chinese civilization as he knew it. Unlike Zhou Zuoren \(1885–1967\), who went to Japan somewhat later and developed a keen interest in and sensitivity to Japanese culture itself, which he then devoted himself to introducing back into China, Liang approached Japan in a much more utilitarian manner and always ultimately focused on China. 

China, he felt, desperately needed the foundations of a strong nation-state, the structure and infrastructure necessary to bring the entire citizenry together as one. This was the lesson, he believed, that the modern world had laid at China’s doorstep over and over again throughout the nineteenth century, and it was a lesson the Japanese had apparently learned well. Thus, it was to the end of providing China with all the accoutrements of the modern nation-state—from the personal and cultural to the social to the national-political—

that Liang became virtually obsessed. He became a man with a mission, and this is critical to our understanding of the circumstances surrounding Liang’s interface with “Japan” or with the “West” via Japan. 

Japan at the beginning of the twentieth century provided Liang with an intellectual reservoir of great works from the West edited and translated for his selection. It was his avenue into modern Western knowledge, prepackaged and ready to use. Unable to read any Western languages, Liang acquired Western knowledge through the medium of Japanese translations. He was able to use the intellectual world around him in Japan as a quick way to learn about the latest theories in numerous fields from the West. Had Liang traveled to any one of the Western countries that produced the works upon which he drew so profusely and devoted his time to acquiring that one European language, he would never have gained the extraordinary breadth of knowledge for which he is so famous. Thus, as shown in the essays by Marianne Bastid-Bruguière, Ishikawa Yoshihiro, Mori Tokihiko, Huang K’o-wu, Don Price, Saitō Mareshi, Sakamoto Hiroko, Hazama Naoki, and others, Liang was tapping into “Western learning” 

without the intermediacy of the West itself. It was all knowledge refracted via Japan, and hence doubly refracted by the time Liang wrote about it in Chinese. 

To varying degrees many of the authors of the essays in this volume clearly see Liang’s borrowing from his sources—usually unattributed—as problematic. Bastid-Bruguière comes the closest to actually labeling Liang a plagiarist. 

None of the authors, though, allows the issue to stop there, for all are aware of the rather different practices regarding attribution in China a century ago—and

among journalists. After identifying the intellectual route leading back from Liang’s work to a Japanese intermediary and then usually to a Western source, as demonstrated perhaps most clearly in the essay by Ishikawa Yoshihiro, their aim is to stress the use to which Liang put the many new ideas he was introducing to his Chinese readers. Liang was thus not looking to engage the truly sophisticated scholarship on China and East Asia that was available in academic publications in Japan at the time. As Sang Bing and Ishikawa, among others, demonstrate, he was looking to popularize sweeping grand theories, unifying principles that would tie the Chinese experience to the rest of the world, principles that would bring China into the general discourse and not leave it to the realm of exceptions—and Japanese commentators and translators made such theories more easily available to him. 

In tracing the complex process of Liang’s appropriation of Japanese sources, these essays also demonstrate that Japan was more than just an empty vehicle. 

The cultural universe that China and Japan shared was central to his formulation of certain new ideas, some of which were actually Eastern rather than Western in origin. Liang often \(re\)discovered elements or strains from his own tradition only after going to Japan, as Hazama Naoki and Mori Noriko discuss in their essays.5 In these instances, those Chinese traditions had not been forgotten in China, but they had not yet been linked to the project of strengthening the nation-state in the critical way he observed that they had in Japan. 

He thus fastened onto them. Only another East Asian country such as Japan could have served Liang’s needs here, for these were subject areas—Buddhism and the teachings of Wang Yangming \(1472–1529\)—that would have had little meaning outside the region. 

We have seen that Liang’s primary goal was a strong nation-state for China, but that seemed to require a well-managed economy. Mori Tokihiko closely tracks Liang’s coming to terms with the Western notion of “political economy.” 

Mori demonstrates that Liang tried hard to avoid adopting the current Japanese term keizai \(C. jingji\) because he was afraid that the traditional Chinese background to that term—from jingshi jimin or “to manage the realm and save the people”—would seriously confuse his readers. His opponents in the Chinese press in Japan, the revolutionaries, lacked the requisite background in their own tradition to find this a problem, however, and moved quickly to adopt 5  This is, interestingly, also true of Liang’s renewed understanding of the history of Chinese 

“philosophy,” a subject dramatically changed under Japanese influence. See Sueoka Hiroshi, 

“Ryō Keichō to Nihon no Chūgoku tetsugaku kenkyū,” in Kyōdō kenkyū, pp. 168–93; Chinese translation: “Liang Qichao yu Riben de Zhongguo zhexue yanjiu,” in Liang Qichao, Mingzhi Riben, Xifang, pp. 156–83. 

246

Introduction: Liang Qichao and Japan

jingji. Mori shows how Liang struggled for years to come up with an appropriate term, until he reluctantly adopted jingji as well. 

A far grander political issue for which the Japanese case offered Liang considerable grist for his mill was that of the imperial institution. As Peter Zarrow demonstrates, the centrality of the emperor to Liang’s conception of things can hardly be overstated. The   Meiji emperor provided inspiration as a symbol of national unity, apparently signifying reform leadership and historical progress, while presiding over a strong constitutional state—precisely the arrangement Liang and his mentor, Kang Youwei \(1858–1927\), as well as other constitutional reformers sought. How well they actually understood what was transpiring in Japan—either before or after they took refuge there—is a much more difficult issue to assess. What they understood that political situation to be, how and what they sought to appropriate from the political set-up of the Meiji regime, are the central issues here. The imperial institution in Japan was, thus, not a blueprint for Liang but more a model from which to borrow creatively. 

Tying the imperial institution to state control were links reinforced for Liang by his exposure in Japan to the writings of the political scientist and educator Katō Hiroyuki \(1836–1916\). Katō also introduced Liang to the Social Darwinist concepts of natural selection and survival of the fittest—and, in Katō’s formulation, rights. As Don Price shows in his essay, Liang again selectively adopted from Katō’s formulation of might-makes-right thinking to creatively build a statist doctrine for China. Katō’s views were attractive not simply because they made sense intellectually, but also because they seemed to have been applied in Meiji-era Japan with extraordinary results. Evolutionary theory came to play a formidable role in Liang’s consciousness, as it did for many of Liang’s contemporaries around the world. 

One line of inquiry that is explicit or implicit in all of the essays in this volume is the relationship between Liang Qichao and his Japanese sources. In her contribution on Liang and Johann Kaspar Bluntschli \(1808–81\), Marianne Bastid-Bruguière portrays Liang’s appropriation of the fortuitous translation into literary Chinese by a Japanese of a work by Bluntschli. The latter’s stress on a powerful state served Liang’s own needs for a critique of unwieldy democracy. Bastid-Bruguière also shows clearly that Liang’s borrowings were not haphazard but methodical, revealing how Liang worked in Japan—systematically absorbing and adapting everything of utility around him, forming it into the dozens of essays he wrote. 

In this field of political thought, the Japanese helped Liang not only by providing a Chinese-language translation ready-made for adoption but, more generally, by creating a modern political vocabulary that this translation of Bluntschli helped generate. Bastid-Bruguière gives us an excellent case study, 

Introduction: Liang Qichao and Japan

247

as we follow the textual history of Bluntschli’s posthumous publication in Japanese and Chinese and come to understand how the universe of European political science of the day became available to Liang Qichao in translation \(or in his native tongue\) in Japan and how and why Bluntschli was so useful for his own overriding project of strengthening the Chinese nation-state. 

Huang K’o-wu’s detailed treatment of Liang’s introduction of the ideas of Immanuel Kant \(1724–1804\) to his Chinese readers parallels Bastid-Bruguière’s. 

It is important to note from the outset that Liang never read Kant—neither in the original nor in translation; what he read was a Japanese translation by Nakae Chōmin \(1847–1901\), the great Meiji-era intellectual, translator, and political figure, of a French history of Western philosophy that contained a section on Kant. Ultimately, whether Liang understood Kant’s philosophic ideas is largely irrelevant. Liang used, as he always did, what he interpreted from Kant to his own philosophic and political ends—just as had been the case in his readings of Bluntschli and as would be the case with many others. 

Huang traces the inordinately complex process by which Liang himself read, “translated,” interpreted, and criticized what he took to be the work of Kant. He shows how Liang related certain of Kant’s ideas to Buddhist and Neo-Confucian texts, how he used Kant’s views to praise Wang Yangming’s ideas and criticize those of his great predecessor, Zhu Xi \(1130–1200\), as well as to demonstrate the superiority, in certain philosophic realms, of Buddhism. 

Huang also suggests a kind of “inlay pattern” to Liang’s thinking’ with different spheres of knowledge filtrating into different strata in his mind—a process that often left Kant far behind. 

The same process can be found in Liang’s appropriation of the social sciences, especially the modern discipline of geography—an immediate Japanese source that was itself an already digested doctrine of Western origin. 

Ishikawa Yoshihiro demonstrates how Liang fastened onto certain all-embracing Western theories of geographical determinism through the intermediacy of the popularizing works by Shiga Shigetaka \(1863–1927\) and Ukita Kazutami \(1859–1946\). Liang then proceeded to propound their ideas in his own name. 

These theoretical constructs, which posited a genetic link between the environment—the land, the topography, and the climate—and historical-political eventualities, although largely passé today, were widely popular a century ago in both East Asia and the West. 

Ishikawa’s essay highlights the important point about all of Liang’s scholarly work that he evinced virtually no interest in the sophisticated, scholarly studies being produced at that time in Japan, such as the work of Kuwabara Jitsuzō \(1870–1931\), the famed China and Inner Asia historian at Kyoto Imperial University. By the same token, the Japanese academic community, with which 

248

Introduction: Liang Qichao and Japan

Liang intersected only tangentially, seems never to have taken him too seriously. As Sang Bing shows in his essay, they saw him as a gadfly, a journalist working on one project today and another tomorrow, but never with the earnestness they deemed requisite for a true scholar. In his last years, after he had returned to China from his long stay in Japan, Liang worked hard to build a field of “national learning” \(guoxue\) in China, and in this he was much influenced by his time in Japan. Despite this influence, though, Liang’s guoxue and academic Sinology in Japan ultimately had little in common. The former was part of his nation-building efforts, whereas the latter was a much more systematic, academic discipline. As Sang points out, Liang’s death in 1929 passed with scarcely any notice within Japanese academic or even journalistic circles. 

Nonetheless, Liang found elements from his own tradition being touted in the realm of the self and the family in unexpected and innovative ways in Japan that he himself soon adopted. He argued in his lengthy essay Xinmin shuo \(Discourse on the new citizen\) that China needed to develop a modern citizenry with a strong sense of civic morality or virtue \(gongde\) to complement the more internal, personal, or private morality \( side\).  As Hazama Naoki shows, the personal was genetically linked to the larger political realm, for both gongde and side were essential to China’s emergence as a modern nation-state, as had been the case earlier for Meiji Japan and the modern West. After returning from an eye-opening visit to the United States in the early years of the twentieth century,6 Liang had become increasingly fearful of revolution and the social anomie to which it could lead. He found support for his views on civic virtue versus personal virtue in the writings of the great Ming-era philosopher and statesman Wang Yangming. 

Liang’s interest in the contemporary relevance of Wang’s ideas was also a product of Liang’s time in Japan. Precisely at the moment Liang was living in Japan, Wang Yangming was undergoing a revival of sorts in certain Japanese circles.

cornerstone of a strong state. For contemporary Japan, then, Wang Yangming was being employed to buttress the unique Japanese spirit or Yamato damashii.  This caught Liang’s attention, for the Chinese needed something comparable, he argued—what he would call a “Chinese Bushidō” or martial spirit. At the same time, the nationalist philosopher Inoue Tetsujirō \(1856–

1944\) was employing Wang Yangming’s writings to forge a new Meiji-period national morality, another project that Liang saw as linked to gongde.  Japan provided the model, although in this case based on a Chinese tradition. 

Liang also discovered the relevance of Buddhism to modern nationalism while in Japan. Liang had shown considerable interest in Buddhism even before he departed for Japan—despite the fact that he was a student of Kang Youwei, China’s most famous Confucian scholar of the late Qing. In fact, there was widespread interest in Buddhism among many late-Qing scholars. 

However, once he found himself in Japan, as Mori Noriko shows in her essay, Liang found a remixed Buddhism, one that had been outfitted for the task of modern state building. There Buddhism had been combined with evolutionary theory, especially the views of Benjamin Kidd \(1858–1916\). When Liang introduced Kidd’s ideas to his readership, he stressed the latter’s focus on personal self-sacrifice for the general good and the future of the nation-state, much the way Kidd had been read and mixed with select Buddhist ideas in Japan. Liang particularly felt the influence of the great Meiji-period Buddhist scholar Inoue Enryō \(1858–1919\). In Inoue, he found modern evolutionary theory, the modern state, and Buddhist religion combined. That Inoue was already fighting a losing battle and was trying to refit Buddhism for survival in Japan was largely lost on Liang. 

Another personal issue for Liang in which Japan provided a complex vehicle for new political ideas was the relationship between Chinese national identity and language. All the emerging nation-states of Europe and Japan had gone through a process of forging a “national language,” a sine qua non of modernity. As Saitō Mareshi makes clear, there were at least three layers at work in Liang’s understanding of “Chinese” as a language: his native spoken Cantonese, guanhua \(official Mandarin, at which Liang never acquired great proficiency\), and the literary Chinese language \(wenyan\).  Liang himself derived language identity and ethnic identity in being both Cantonese and Han. The linguistic structure of Chinese as a language, though, would become clear to Liang only after he perused Japanese grammars of his day. 

For Liang, the Japanese language was little different from Cantonese. Both were rooted, he believed, in an ancient literary language, wenyan, which had served both countries \(and Korea and Vietnam, it should be added\) for many centuries. The Hewen Han dufa \(Reading Japanese the Chinese way\), a

contemporary work offering easy access to Japanese for readers of Chinese, was an all-important text for Liang.7 It not only enabled him to gain quick entry into contemporary Japanese writings and translations; it also substantiated the notion that Japanese could be read as if it were a topolect of Chinese. 

Another aspect of Liang’s understanding of national identity formulated in Japan, in addition to the linguistic, was the place of gender. This forms the core of Sakamoto Hiroko’s contribution to this collection. She shows how Liang, although deeply concerned with the issue of national identity even before leaving China in 1898, found his conception of the nation and of gender transformed by his stay in Japan. In this instance, Liang was influenced by Takayama Chogyū \(1871–1930\), the literary critic and scholar of aesthetics and moral philosophy, whose work reinforced Liang’s own view of the centrality of race in history and in the ultimate struggle for survival of nations in the world. Just as race was central to national survival, women were central to the strengthening of the race. Women, in Liang’s view, were elemental to the struggle for national survival because they mothered the future generation of Chinese. Bound feet were thus a disgrace because they hindered the free physical movement of these mothers. His commitment to ending footbinding and to female education was thus less inspired by a belief in the need for women’s freedom of movement and edification in and of themselves than it was for the future of the race-nation. 

How are we ultimately to characterize Liang? That he was a public intellectual, at least among Chinese, goes without saying, and he was profoundly politically committed, even if those commitments underwent some considerable change with time. Indeed, Liang may have been a harbinger of a new intellectual class in China, one with roots in the Confucian elite speaking on behalf of the “people” only now speaking on behalf of the “Chinese people” \(in a geographic, not ethnic, sense\).8 This group of new-style intellectuals would rise to greater prominence in the next generation, generating the New Culture Movement and continuing to publish in the sort of political journals that Liang effectively invented for China. One might argue that the extraordinary changes the journalistic Chinese language was undergoing between the late nineteenth century and the New Culture Movement of the 1910s, from literary to vernacular Chinese, was catalyzed by the hybrid journalistic language Liang similarly 7  Hewen Han dufa \(no publication information; copy held in the Kyoto University Library\).

helped to invent, a language irreversibly transformed by his infusion of countless neologisms either coined by Japanese or in use in Japan at the time.9

Japan and the Japanese became over the process of his many years there more than just mediators of things Western; they were providing serious models for the modern nation-state in the countless areas outlined above. 

And these Liang assiduously examined. As Saitō Mareshi suggested during the discussions at our conference and as several essays in the volume suggest, Liang’s role model in this regard consciously or unconsciously, may have been Tokutomi Sohō \(1863–1957\), the Japanese journalist who came of age in the Meiji period and published voluminously over a long career, even if little of his work has much scholarly depth. Both men were concerned with any and every area of their nation’s culture and wrote numerous essays in numerous fields. 

But each was centrally concerned with seeing to it that his homeland emerged stronger and with deserved glory in an increasingly contentions international arena. 

Is Liang Qichao reduced in any significant way as a result of these eleven scrutinizing examinations of the role of Japan and the Japanese in his thought and practice? If one is concerned with Liang as a great scholar, then indeed his ranking in modern history will be sharply demoted. If one is more concerned with Liang as a Chinese nationalist, then perhaps one may view his wholesale appropriation of things Japanese as problematical. However, if one is content to leave Liang as a public intellectual \(as opposed to an academic or scholar\) and a man or his own time in history, then what these eleven essays do is demonstrate how he functioned as a publicist. We now know the sources of numerous lines of thought upon which he drew—virtually always without attribution. For those reluctant to concede a significant Japanese influence on Liang, there is no longer any room for debate. Even many of Liang’s ideas about Chinese history and thought drew on scholars and schools of thought in Japan. 

We seriously hope, though, that Liang’s role has not been reduced, but rather historicized or, at least, relativized. His prolific production as a writer should not—as it should not for Tokutomi Sohō—be confused with academic brilliance, great linguistic breadth, or even originality. It simply reveals a man of exceptional energy with interests that were as wide as they were thin, active at a time when China’s sense of national crisis and national identity were most acute and the introduction of foreign learning at its inception.

an original thinker in as many fields as Liang “contributed” to. But that is also beside the point. Liang was a public intellectual whose self-appointed role was introducing multitudes of Western and Japanese ideas to his readership—all with the aim of building a strong Chinese nation-state and culture. He only fails when he is judged \(ahistorically\) by later academic standards.
