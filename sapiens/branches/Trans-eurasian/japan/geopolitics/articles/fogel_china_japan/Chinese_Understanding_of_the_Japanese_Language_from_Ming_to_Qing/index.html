  <meta property="og:description" content="Generally speaking, there have been four periods in which heightened Chinese interest in Japan has led to the development of scholarship concerning Japan: the late Ming (principally the Jiajing and Wanli eras); roughly the decade between the first Sino-Japanese War (1894–95) and the Russo-Japanese War (1904–05); the 1930s and early 1940s, from the Manchurian Incident until the
end of World War Two; and the present, post-Mao era.1 Concerning the first period it has been argued that, while the Ming years witnessed the compilation of hallmark Chinese texts on Japan, in the Qing period, by contrast, there was a decline in Chinese learning about Japan. This essay will examine this phenomenon by focusing on the specific issue of changing Chinese perceptions of the Japanese language from the Ming to the Qing.">

  <p>Generally speaking, there have been four periods in which heightened Chinese interest in Japan has led to the development of scholarship concerning Japan: the late Ming (principally the Jiajing and Wanli eras); roughly the decade between the first Sino-Japanese War (1894–95) and the Russo-Japanese War (1904–05); the 1930s and early 1940s, from the Manchurian Incident until the</p>
<p>end of World War Two; and the present, post-Mao era.1 Concerning the first period it has been argued that, while the Ming years witnessed the compilation of hallmark Chinese texts on Japan, in the Qing period, by contrast, there was a decline in Chinese learning about Japan. This essay will examine this phenomenon by focusing on the specific issue of changing Chinese perceptions of the Japanese language from the Ming to the Qing.</p>
<p>Although mention of and efforts to represent the Japanese language in Chinese texts long predate the Ming, it was only at that time that Chinese scholars for the first time wrestled with characteristics of Japanese that sharply distinguished it from Chinese. Ming-period texts confronted and analyzed the kana  syllabaries, explained Japanese grammar by parsing sentences, and offered lengthy word lists of Japanese terms.</p>
<p>Language is, of course, not a transparent vessel, but reflects the social and political contexts of its speakers and writers. Prior to the twentieth century, educated Japanese, Koreans, Vietnamese, and others from East Asian states no 1  This is a generally accepted and unobjectionable view. See Wu Anlong and Xiong Dayun, Chūgokujin no Nihon kenkyū shi, pp. 14–16; Watanabe Mitsuo, “Chūgoku kobunken ni mieru Nihongo: Kakurin gyokuro to Shoshi kairyō ni tsuite,” Komazawa daigaku kenkyū kiyō 15</p>
<p>(March 1957), pp. 155–56. The late-Ming period is, however, distinguished in several important ways: it is the first such era of intense Chinese attention focused on Japan; it is longer than the other periods; and the nature of contact between China and Japan associated with the past century (late-nineteenth to late-twentieth) which has been made increasingly convenient by modern transportation and communications was completely absent at that time.</p>
<p>In one significant way, the four are strikingly similar: all are related to the rise of perceived or real Japanese might (military and economic). Wang Yizhong cites eighty-one Chinese works from the Ming period about Japan, and there were many others as well. See his “Mingdai haifang tuji lu,” Qinghua zhoukan 37.9–10 (May 1932), pp. 141–62.</p>

<p>longer in existence (such as the state of Bohai) who looked to China for moral, political, and cultural guidance all sought to master the literary Chinese language. Knowledge of Chinese for non-Chinese East Asians was itself an index to erudition, and inasmuch as knowledge and morality were so closely interwoven in cultures which shared China’s Confucian heritage, to one degree or another, it was as well an important component of self-cultivation and elite social cohesion. By contrast, few Chinese ever bothered to learn a foreign language before the late nineteenth century. The obvious exceptions to this general rule concern the conquest dynasties of late imperial history, namely, the acquisition of Mongolian by Chinese during the Yuan dynasty and the Manchu language during the Qing; these instances again point to the political importance of language. It would be difficult to find many Chinese who learned either language out of intellectual curiosity before the conquest of the Central Plain.</p>
<p>Borrowing a concept from the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu,2 we have a situation here in which there was enormous cultural capital for non-Chinese East Asians to acquire greater talent at the Chinese literary language, but there was almost no cultural capital in Chinese society associated with the acquisition of a foreign language. Within the distinctive linguistic habitus of early modern China, knowledge of Japanese was neither desired nor seen as necessary. Chinese literati appreciated and, indeed, understood Japanese culture exclusively through the erudition its own elites reached in literary Chinese composition and through contributions to the evolving Confucian tradition (such as commentaries on Confucian texts, also written in literary Chinese).</p>
<p>Only rarely did they seem to have any interest in the intrinsic value of the Japanese language or culture.</p>
<p>The issue of language in this Chinese context was not simply a linguistic or political one, but was also ultimately closely tied to culture. The relative lack of concern on the part of the Chinese elite prior to the twentieth century bespeaks a sense of cultural seclusion or, at least, cultural self-sufficiency. For the most part, foreigners who wanted to interact with the Chinese empire had to do so within the parameters of the Chinese cultural universe by learning Chinese. In Ming times, the government created a corps of translators for diplomatic relations and local officials commissioned studies of Japan to combat the threat of Japanese piracy along the coast. In these contexts, the study of foreign languages was largely driven by political, not cultural, motivations.</p>
<p>2  E.g., Pierre Bourdieu, Language and Symbolic Power, pp. 81–89. I have gained some insight from this work by Bourdieu, but the fit with the East Asian cultural setting still remains uneasy, requiring theory—as yet unwritten—of its own.</p>
<p>chinese understanding of the japanese language 301</p>
<p>The Qing era provides an even more interesting vantage point from which to address the issue of Chinese approaches to foreign languages. Precisely at this time Chinese scholars were developing the most sophisticated techniques in historical linguistics, phonetics, and related fields ever devised in Chinese history—namely, the kaozheng or textual critical movement. How is it that their intense interest in the history of the Chinese language seems not to have extended to any other languages? Was their interest in the history of the Chinese language a genuine interest in language itself or in language as one essential element of Chinese culture? What can the case of Chinese approaches to the Japanese language in this period teach us about the premises of this philosophical and cultural movement?</p>

<p><strong>Background: Pre-Ming Traces of Japanese in Chinese Texts</strong> Scholars are generally agreed that the first mention of a Japanese word in a Chinese document appears in the first serious Chinese work that discusses Japan and the Japanese, namely the entry on the “people of Wa” (Woren) in the Wei zhi (Chronicle of the Kingdom of Wei) by Chen Shou (233–97). This famous and much analyzed text contains Chinese-character renderings for a number of Japanese proper nouns—place names, bureaucratic titles, and personal names, such as the renowned Empress Pimiko (or Himiko), and numerous country names in ancient Japan.3 These are, however, treated more as novelties than as linguistic evidence of any sort. Inasmuch as this text was transcribed at a time when Japan still had no written language, the representation of these Japanese names in Chinese characters marked the first instance in which Japanese words were transcribed into any written form.</p>
<p>Subsequent entries on Japan in the Chinese dynastic histories contain similar Chinese-character readings for Japanese proper nouns. These would include the famous listing of the “five kings” and their embassies to various Chinese courts, seeking investiture within the Chinese ritual system, which appears in the entry on Japan in the Song shu (History of the Liu-Song dynasty). It also 3  See the magnificently annotated edition of Wang Xiangrong and Xia Yingyuan, Zhong-Ri guanxi shiliao huibian, pp. 8–13, 18–21; the translations by Ishihara Michihiro, Yakuchū</p>

<p>chinese understanding of the japanese language</p>
<p>includes the names of the king of Wa and various Japanese toponyms given in the entry of Japan in the Sui shu (History of the Sui dynasty).4</p>
<p>Aside from official histories, various early private collections occasionally make mention of Japan and cite Japanese terms in Chinese-character approximations. One such example would be the Shishi liutie (The six models of Buddhism) of the monk Yichu, also known as Mingjiao Dashi, of the Five Dynasties era. In his section on “States, settlements, prefectures, and towns,”</p>
<p>Yichu includes a section on Japan with the following note on Mount Fuji: “Over 1,000 li  to the northeast is a mountain by the name of Fuji. . . . A single flower soaring on high, its summit is covered in mist.”5 Entries of a similar sort are scattered throughout the Chinese literary record, including dozens, perhaps several hundred, references in Tang-era poetry.</p>
<p>Before the Song era, however, no effort has as yet been discovered on the part of the Chinese to say anything about the Japanese language per se.  Luo Dajing (Jinglun, jinshi of 1226), a scholar and poet from Luling in the Southern Song era, reports in his Helin yulu (The pearly dew of Helin) of a meeting in his youth in Zhonglu, Zhejiang, with a Japanese priest by the name of Ankaku (1160–1242). As we learn from other sources, Ankaku, a Rinzai Zen monk, came from the Kōshōji in Chikuzen and was originally known by the name Shikijō</p>
<p>Ryōyū. A brilliant young man, allegedly having read and become conversant in the Buddhist canon by age twenty, he traveled to China just after the year 1200</p>
<p>and remained there for over ten years, during which time he devoted himself to memorizing the Buddhist canon, before returning to Japan in 1214.6</p>

See Wang Xiangrong, “Guanyu Riben kao,” in his Zhong-Ri guanxi shi wenxian lunkao, p. 242. This is, interestingly, not the first mention of a Japanese mountain in a Chinese text. For that one needs return several hundred years to the entry on Japan in the Sui shu wherein one finds mention of Mount Aso.

<p>chinese understanding of the japanese language 303</p>
<p>After a brief note about this Japanese monk, Luo records twenty Chinese terms and their Japanese translations, given in Chinese-character transcription, that Ankaku taught him. The first three are political terms for which Ankaku gave the Japanese equivalents, not transcriptions; the fourth is a mixture of direct translation and Chinese characters used to represent Japanese morphemes. The remaining sixteen are single-character terms given in Chinese followed by Japanese pronunciations approximated by Chinese characters, a process known as kan’yaku (C. hanyi) or on’yaku (C. yinyi) by Japanese linguists. Thus, for example, following the Chinese term yu (rain), we find (in contemporary standard Mandarin) “xiami” which approximates the Japanese term for rain, or ame.  Similarly, the Chinese term tou (head) is followed by</p>
<p>“jiashiluo,” which approaches the Japanese term kashira.  7 In all of these cases, it is exceedingly important to remember that not only do these readings reflect local dialectal Chinese and Japanese pronunciations, but that both spoken languages have changed over the past eight hundred years as well. Nonetheless, even the untrained linguist can recognize these equivalencies. Luo Dajing’s list remains the only one of its kind prior to the Ming era that has thus far been uncovered.</p>
<p>In the Ming, not only would the lists of individual terms grow into the thousands, but Chinese readers would be introduced to the Japanese writing systems for the first time. Although we have no such extant lists or introductions dating to the Yuan period, one explanation for the great explosion of information about Japan and the Japanese language in the early Ming may lie in the manifold opening outward occasioned by the Mongol conquest and the resultant cosmopolitanism. The Mongols themselves only acquired a written language, based on the Uighur script, several decades before conquering China in 1279, and with an empire that stretched well into Arabic and Persian terrain, the Mongols did not overly privilege the Chinese language. Thus, educated Chinese during the Yuan era would surely have been exposed to writing systems other than Chinese.</p>

<p><strong>Kana</strong>** Syllabaries in Ming China**</p>
<p>In fact, when the hiragana syllabary alphabet was first introduced into China at the very beginning of the Ming dynasty, the author of the text noted that its symbols were “like Mongolian.” This text was the Shushi huiyao (Essentials in the history of calligraphy) by Tao Zongyi (completed according to the author’s preface in Hongwu 9 or 1376). Tao hailed from Huangyan, Zhejiang Province, and he lived from the last decades of the Yuan era into the early Ming. He was a gifted scholar who passed the jinshi examination at a young age, but he never served in office and actually turned down several offers of appointment.</p>
<p>The Shushi huiyao is a work in nine juan.  It presents a history of Chinese calligraphic styles from antiquity into the Yuan.</p>
<p>One section in juan eight of this work concerns calligraphic styles of “foreign lands” (waiyu), induding Sanskrit, Uighur, Arabic, and Japanese. After a brief description of Japanese calligraphy, Tao lays out in clearly readable fashion the hiragana syllabaries in the i-ro-ha order (the Japanese alphabetical order comparable to a-b-c in many Western languages). Beneath each hiragana  symbol are Chinese characters approximating the Japanese pronunciation of that symbol; for the sa, ta, and ha rows of the Japanese syllabary alphabet, there are two pronunciations given for each.8 These are all followed by a list of ten terms and their Japanese pronunciations (in kana).  Tao claims that he acquired all 8  Tao, Shushi huiyao; Watanabe Mitsuo, “Chūgoku kobunken,” pp. 159–62; Watanabe Mitsuo,</p>

Hamada Atsushi has shown that these clearly represent voiced/unvoiced pairs in the Wenzhou dialect. Tao would have spoken a variant of the Wu dialect, and Wenzhou dialect falls within the larger Wu dialect group. See Hamada Atsushi, “Kokugo o kisai seru,” p. 11. Tao’s work has also been used by Japanese linguists to help reconstruct the pronunciation of certain kana of medieval Japanese; see, for example, Hashimoto Shinkichi, “Hagyō shiin no hensen ni tsuite,” in  Kokugo on’in no kenkyū, pp. 33–35. There were similar works prepared by Koreans during the Yi dynasty in which the Japanese syllabaries were matched with approximate han’gŭl symbols for pronunciation.</p>
<p>The earliest example of a Korean text of this sort is the Yongbi ǒch’ǒng ka (Songs of flying dragons) by Kwŏn Che, Chŏng In-ji, and others; dated 1445, one year before the famous proclamation announcing han’gǔl, this text is apparently the earliest printed text to make use of the Korean alphabet. The most famous early text of this sort, published only a few decades after the invention of  han’gŭl,   is the Irop’a (I-ro-ha) of 1492. See Ōtomo Shin’ichi, Muromachi jidai no kokugo onset no kenkyū: Chūgoku shiryō ni yoru, pp. 40–41; Kamei Takashi, Ōfuchi Tokihiko, and Yamada Toshio, Nihongo no rekishi, 4: utsuriyuku kodaigo, p. 406.</p>
<p>chinese understanding of the japanese language 305</p>
<p>of this information about the Japanese language from a Buddhist monk by the name of Kokkin Taiyō who had visited China, but nothing of this man has as yet been brought to light. For many reasons, Buddhist monks continued to play a central role in the cultural transmission between China and Japan.</p>
<p>Even a cursory look at Tao’s explanations of the forty-six syllabaries of Japanese reveals a highly serious effort to represent that sound system through the use of Chinese characters. As a native of southeastern Zhejiang, between Ningbo and Wenzhou, Tao’s native tongue would have belonged to the Wu dialect group. He composed the text while living in Songjiang which also falls in the Wu dialect region. Thus, even though he would probably have been a speaker as well of standard capital Mandarin, his readings of the Chinese-character renderings for the Japanese syllabaries clearly reflect Wu readings.9</p>
<p>Inasmuch as we know nothing about his Japanese informant, we cannot at this point speculate what Japanese accent he brought to the pronunciation of kana.</p>
<p>About one hundred and eighty years would pass before Chinese readers would be introduced to the katakana syllabary. It was at this time that Chinese interest in the Japanese language became tied to the perceived Japanese threat along the coast. In 1556 Zheng Shungong—originally from Xin’an, Guangdong—was ordered by Yang Yi, the governor of Zhejiang, to proceed to Japan to request of the Japanese authorities the suppression and prohibition of the wokou (J. wakō, “Japanese pirate”). Zheng was apprehended in Bungo Domain on the island of Kyūshū by Ōtomo Yoshishige (Sōrin, 1530–87) and held there, though not incarcerated, for as long as six or seven months; his entire Japanese stay may have lasted a year or more. During this time he had ample opportunity to observe Japan in some depth before returning to China in 1557 in the company of a Japanese monk by the name of Tokuyō</p>
<p>Seiju, again of the Rinzai Zen sect from the great Daitokuji temple complex.10</p>
<p>Upon his return he wrote up his observations into an encyclopedic work bearing the title Riben yijian (A mirror on Japan) in sixteen juan.</p>
<p>The Riben yijian contains the first Chinese printing of the katakana syllabaries, presented in much the same way as Tao Zongyi had introduced hiragana. Despite a few errors, perhaps in transcription, Zheng not only offered a clear reading for each katakana symbol; the Chinese characters he used for pronunciation actually suggest the origins of the kana symbol in question.</p>
<p>9  Ōtomo Shin’chi, Muromachi jidai no kokugo, pp. 64–66.</p>
<p>10  Ōtomo Shin’ichi gives slightly different dates. He also notes that Seiju ultimately spent time at the Zhiping Temple in Maozhou, Sichuan, and altogether over four years in China.</p>

<p>He called them “Huawen Wozi” (lit., Chinese writing, Japanese characters).</p>
<p>He then laid out the hiragana syllabaries, which he dubbed “Wozi Wo” (by which he probably meant “Wozi Woyin” or Japanese characters and their pronunciations) and occasionally “Wozi caoshu” (cursive Japanese characters).11</p>
<p>The Riben yijian also contains the longest list of Japanese words with Chinese-character renderings—some 3,399 in all—in any text prior to the compilation of modern dictionaries.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Japanese Glossaries and Grammatical Explanations in Ming Texts</strong> One of the other major innovations of the Ming period in evolving Chinese understandings of the Japanese language was this compilation of a number of extensive word lists, far surpassing in length anything that preceded the Ming.</p>
<p>In addition, a number of innovative means of explaining Japanese grammatical usage also appear in these texts. Aside from the works prepared for the government’s diplomatic usage, these works interestingly were all compiled in the Jiajing and Wanli reigns of the Ming in the mid-sixteenth to the early seventeenth century. And, they were all inspired by the military question of dealing with “Japanese” pirates, many or most of whom were Chinese working out of bases in Japan.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate contacts with neighboring states that brought tribute to the Chinese court, early in the dynasty Ming court officials of the Huitong guan (Interpreters Institute)—the office dating to the Yuan that dealt with foreign emissaries, provided them with housing, clothes, and conveyance, and watched over them closely while in China—prepared word lists for the various languages spoken by these foreign embassies. These were collectively known as Huayi yiyu (Sino-foreign vocabularies). The earliest one, compiled on the orders of Ming Taizu, was a Sino-Mongolian word list by Qoninci (fl. ca. 1376–</p>
<p>ca. 1394), a Mongol known as well by the Chinese name of Huo Yuanjie, and 11  Zheng Shungong,  Riben yijian, juan  4–5. See also  Sanshū Nihon yakugo,   pp. 230–32; Watanabe Mitsuo, “Minjin ni yoru,” pp. 101, 106; Tomioka Kenzō, “Nihon ikkan kaidai,”</p>

<p>Dating from as early as the late fifteenth century, there are now six of these glossaries extant that were prepared for dealing specifically with Japanese emissaries, usually referred to as Riben jiyu (Japanese vocabularies). Each runs to roughly 520–560 terms in all. One such list containing 521 terms breaks down as follows: astronomy (42), geography (43), times and seasons (37), flora (52), animals (45), palaces and mansions (14), implements (68), people (47), personal affairs (51), the body (20), clothing (20), foodstuffs (30), precious items (19), literature and history (10), voice and countenance (9), numbers (24), directions (11), and common usage terms (20). While these categories resemble those of subsequent texts, their content tends to stress official discourse and interactions.12</p>

A similar phenomenon of the establishment of a training institute for interpreters and translators can be seen in Korea. In 1276 the T’ongmun’gwan was opened to train experts in spoken and written Chinese only; when the Yi dynasty was founded, it was replaced by the Sayǒgwǒn, and in roughly 1414 a Waehakch’ŏng (Japanese studies office) was set up to train Japanese-language interpreters and translators. See Ōtomo Shin’ichi, Muromachi jidai no kokugo, pp. 39–40, citing the Sejong sillok (The veritable records of King Sejong). Among the texts they used for Japanese training was the Irop’a mentioned above.</p>
<p>308</p>
<p>chinese understanding of the japanese language</p>
<p>These works were not known or available outside the confines of the government offices using them and hence had limited influence. The first text written outside the halls of the Ming central government that carried a word list of this sort was a work inspired by the threat of piracy, the Riben kao lüe (Brief study of Japan), sometimes also known as the Riben guo kao lüe (Brief study of the country of Japan), by Xue Jun. Generally considered the first specialized Chinese text about Japan, the  Riben kao lüe in one juan dates to 1523 (Jiajing 2); it is also the first Chinese book to have the expression “Riben” (Japan) in its title. All subsequent Chinese writings on the subject from the late Ming were influenced by it. Xue was a student in the country school in Dinghai—he later served as an assistant instructor (xundao) in Changzhou and an instructor ( jiaoyu) in Fuliang—when Dinghai District Magistrate Zheng Yuqing ordered him to compose a work that clarified the known information about Japan and to offer suggestions to the military on how best to cope with the pirates who were attacking the coast. As he notes early in the text, there had been destructive fighting earlier in 1523 in Ningbo between men under the command of the Ōuchi envoy Sōsetsu Gendō and the Hosokawa envoy Song Suqing, but it had not spread to Dinghai. Unlike several of the authors of later texts in this tradition, Xue was never able to visit Japan, and thus his work was prepared without any direct knowledge of the subject under study.13</p>
<p>In the one full study we have of the Riben kao lüe, Wang Xiangrong argues that it would not have been an especially noteworthy work had it not been China’s first specialized study of Japan. The real distinctiveness of Xue’s work lies in an extremely important innovation, a section entitled “Jiyu lüe” (Brief vocabulary)14 which lists a total of 357 Japanese words (or 359, depending on edition) with kan’yaku style readings provided, a list repeated verbatim (including errors) in many texts that followed in the Ming. Unlike the official vocabu-13  Wang Xiangrong, “Zhongguo diyibu yanjiu Riben de zhuanzhu: Riben kao lüe,”   in Zhong-Ri huanxi shi wenxian lunkao, pp. 222–23, 224, 230; Kyōto daigaku bungaku kokugogaku kokubungaku kenkyūshitsu, ed., Nihon kigo no kenkyū, p. 1; Watanabe Mitsuo, “Minjin ni yoru,” p. 104; Akiyama Kenzō, “Mindai ni okeru Shinajin no Nihongo kenkyū,”  Kokugo to kokubungaku 10.1 (January 1933), p. 9; Miao Fenglin, “Mingren zhu yu Riben youguan shiji tiyao sizhong,” Jiangsu shengli guoxue tushuguan 2 (1929), pp. 1–4; Fukushima Kunimichi,</p>

<p>14  Xue Jun, Ribun kao lüe, pp. 16b–23a. The expression jiyu requires explanation. It derives from the Liji, one of the ancient ritual classics, in which the vocabulary of the “barbarians” in the four directions are distinguished; those from the east are designated ji. See Watanabe Mitsuo, “Minjin ni yoru,” p. 104.</p>
<p>chinese understanding of the japanese language 309</p>
<p>laries prepared from the early Ming for diplomatic correspondence, Xue’s list is broader, more detailed, and better organized. He himself claimed that the ultimate aim of this section was, as was the case for the entire text, defense against wokou incursions: “Speech is the voice of the heart, and if you understand their speech, you will be able to see through to the sincerity or falsehood of their hearts. Thus, I have compiled common expressions, categorized and translated them. This may help in defending ourselves from distant enemies.”</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the terms he offers are decidedly not military language but ordinary everyday terms, even some commercial expressions. Having not learned Japanese himself, he probably acquired these terms from Chinese merchants who plied the Kyūshū-Ningbo trade route, but he does not reveal his sources.</p>
<p>The Chinese pronunciations given in characters for the Japanese terms reflect the sixteenth-century eastern Zhejiang dialect.15</p>
<p>The categories and numbers of terms within each run as follows: astronomy (11), times and seasons (17), geography (9), directions (6), precious items (8), people (64), human affairs (92), the body (14), implements (45), clothing (10), foodstuffs (20), flora, (9), animals (11), numbers (16), and common usage terms (27). There are occasional differences in pronunciations given in different editions. Yet, a comparison of all the major late-Ming texts about Japan that include such glossaries indicates that the Riben kao lüe set pronunciation standards for the subsequent texts. On the whole, Xue’s work gravely misun-derstood Japan—he basically saw all Japanese as wokou and took much of his information from the Wei zhi entry on Wa, by then over one thousand years old—but his “Jiyu lüe” set an important model for well over a century.16</p>
<p>The next major text on Japan was the much longer and fuller Riben yijian,</p>
<p>described above. Although compiled only four decades after the Riben kao lüe,   its word list included almost ten times as many Japanese terms and their Chinese-character transcriptions. These break down in the following manner: astronomy (61), geography (246), times and seasons (120), people (164), palaces and mansions (86), instruments (296), animals (255), flora (244), the body (160), clothing (75), precious items (34), foodstuffs (95), literature and history (57), voice and countenance (122), stems and branches (35), divination terms 15  Wang Xiangrong “Zhongguo diyibu yanjiu Riben de zhuanzhu,” pp. 232–33. The earliest edition of the Riben kao lüe now extant dates to 1530, with a preface by Wang Wenguang.</p>

<p>(8), numbers (30), and common usage terms (1311).17 In addition, other sections of the text contain Japanese toponyms and the like with Chinese renderings. Unlike other Ming texts on Japan, the Riben yijian represented each kana syllable with a single Chinese character, uniformly employed, not a multitude of different ones. It is also unlike the other Ming-era word lists which generally reflect Kyūshū dialect pronunciations of Japanese terms, and it contains numerous terms which appear in no other Chinese texts of this period.18</p>
<p>By far the most analyzed Chinese text concerning Japan of this period has been the Chouhai tubian (Illustrated essay on maritime defense) by Zheng Ruozeng in thirteen juan. The text exists in four or five editions dating from 1562 to 1624. Hu Zongxian (1511–65), the governor of Zhejiang, has often been named as the author of this text largely because of the efforts of his descendants, but it is now clear that it was the work of Zheng Ruozeng.19 Zheng was born in Kunshan, near Suzhou, and the whole region from Suzhou to Shanghai had been hit hard by wokou activity over the first decades of the sixteenth century. Hu Zongxian had built his career on crushing the wokou, especially the notorious pirates Wang Zhi (d. 1559) and Xu Hai. When he learned of Zheng’s interests in pursuing the pirates, perhaps through a work in one juan  Zheng had completed in the summer of 1561 entitled Riben tu zuan (Collection of Japanese maps), Hu invited him to join his staff.</p>
<p>Zheng never actually traveled to Japan but compiled his writings by interviewing numerous people along the south China coast affected by corsair raids, captured wokou, and Chinese merchants who had visited Nagasaki to engage in trade; two men of commerce who provided him with much material were Jiang Zhou and Chen Keyuan. Hu’s connections also enabled Zheng to examine government documents. The Chouhai tubian will ultimately, though, 17  Zheng Shungong, Riben yijian, Qionghe huahai, juan 5.</p>

<p>19  Even the Siku quanshu zongmu tiyao states clearly: “The Chouhai tubian in thirteen juan by Hu Zongxian of the Ming.” This information was repeated in a number of other Qing sources as well. The first modern author to recognize that Zheng in fact authored the Chouhai tubian was Gotō Shukudō, “Wakō shiryō: Chūkai zuhen ni tsuite (1),” Tōyō</p>

<p>be remembered much more as a treatise on the wokou than as a study of Japan. The advice it offered helped Hu to win subsequent battles against the marauders.20 The linguistic information in the text does not mark a major advance over previous works in this lineage. However, in a subsection entitled “Jiyu daoming” (Vocabulary of names of islands), Zheng included 81 items (11 of which have no transcription beside them), and many of these were new to Chinese texts. They are followed by a list of 358 words in 15 categories, effectively the same as that given in the Riben kao lüe.</p>
<p>One final text worth noting from the late Ming dates to the middle years of the Wanli reign at the very end of the sixteenth century. This is entitled the Riben kao (Study of Japan) in five juan by two military men, Li Yangong (then working at the military headquarters of the Capital Training Divisions) and Hao Jie (then right censor-in-chief), and it turns out to be the same as another text, entitled Riben fengtu ji (Account of the customs of Japan), appended to the Quan-Zhe bingzhi kao (Study of the military institutions of Zhejiang) by another military man, Hou Jigao (a regional commander to whom it is frequently incorrectly attributed). Published between the seventh month of 1592</p>
<p>and the tenth month of 1593, precisely at the time of Hideyoshi’s first invasion of the Asian mainland, Li presented their work in the eleventh month of 1593 to Song Yingchang (1530–1606), the military commissioner in charge of combating the Japanese invading army. Li had been sent to Japan by Song to attempt to forestall further incursions. His firsthand experiences there and en route along the Korean peninsula, the interviews he carried out, and his acquisition of some knowledge of the Japanese language enabled him to provide more up-to-date information about Japan.21</p>

<p>chinese understanding of the japanese language</p>
<p>While the initial impetus to the compilation of this work was gaining more accurate data about the Japanese invaders, fully one-half of the Riben kao was devoted to language. The first juan  contains, amid other information, the names of the Japanese islands with Chinese-character pronunciations (all apparently taken from the Chouhai tubian); juan 2 offers 70 terms concerned with Japanese customs and practices, almost all of which appear again later in the text’s word list. In juan 3, the hiragana syllabaries are introduced in a cursive form, arranged in i-ro-ha order and accompanied by Chinese characters for pronunciation (some nonstandard, probably reflecting the eastern Zhejiang area accent of the time); there is as well a extra kana represented by what appears to be the Chinese character jing (capital city). It also contains some 39 Japanese waka (31-syllable poems) with a complex system of explanation described below.</p>
<p>Juan 4 is devoted entirely to the Japanese language, a word list of between 1,140 and 1,186 terms (depending on edition). Although the actual number of terms pales in comparison to that of the Riben yijian, the categories under which these terms were arranged reached 56, far greater than any other text. These 56 categories include altogether new ones such as medical implements (6), agricultural tools (6), cities (14), crafts (19), and calculation methods (29), among others.22</p>
<p>Appearing in juan 4 is one of the most remarkable features of this work, a long Chinese-style poem of four-line stanzas, each with seven characters, entitled “Qieyin zhengshe ge” (Poem on correct pronunciation). It describes in poetic form the different ways in which Chinese characters are used and pronounced in Japanese. It also contains a passage on the use of grammatical partides in Japanese, something entirely foreign to Chinese grammar and not taken up again in a Chinese text for nearly three hundred years.</p>
<p>The 39 waka in the Riben kao come from various Japanese poetry collections. To each poem the two authors added the following explanatory tools: (a) a four-character title; (b) a Chinese-character reading corresponding to the kana value next to each character in the text; (c) huyin or Japanese pronunciation (using Chinese characters) for each character in the poem that stands in its own right; (d) dufa or yomikudashi rendering in an all Chinese-character pronunciation for each poem (basically combining b and c); (e) shiyin or 22  See Li Yangong and Hao Jie, Riben kao, passim; Watanabe Mitsuo, transl. and annot., Shinshū yakuchū Nihon kō, passim. See also Watanabe Mitsuo, “Minjin ni yoru,” pp. 107–08; Wang Xiangrong, “Guanyu Riben kao,” p. 260.</p>
<p>chinese understanding of the japanese language 313</p>
<p>explanation of the meaning or function of every character; and (f) qieyi or a Chinese poetic rendition of the poem’s overall meaning. The following is one such example of a waka taken by the authors from the Japanese collection known as the Shūi shū:</p>
<p>a. 摘花遇雨 “Zhaihua yuyu”</p>
<p>b. 櫻革里埃米外勿里氣奴和乃失古活奴而禿木花那革計爾羊多賴奴</p>
<p>櫻かりあめはふりきぬおなしくはぬるとも花のかけにやとらん</p>

<p>助語 睡不得</p>

<p>摘櫻逢暴雨，衣衫左右濕，花不堪遮躲，淋灕睡不得</p>
<p>The amount of work that went into such an effort must have been immense, there being not a single relevant Chinese reference work of any kind then in existence. In addition, juan  5 contains twelve kouta (ballads, ditties) under a section entitled “Shan’ge” (Mountain songs), most of which date to the Muromachi period (1338–1573). In a manner similar to the presentation of the waka, the authors provide the following explicatory data for each song (save the first): (a) a four-character title; (b) a Chinese-character reading to explain the Japanese pronunciation; (c) shiyin; and (d) qieyi.  For example: a. 夫歸妻接 “Fugui qijie”</p>
<p>b. 一多濕那禿那耶和一多濕那禿那 耶他賣里油米各打推（搖）</p>
<p>いしとの 殿 やおいとしの 殿 や賜れ 弓 肩 よ</p>
<p>屋繪箔一單彈可尼</p>
<p>靱 戴 かうに</p>
<p>c. 一多濕小肝•禿那丈夫•和一多濕大心肝•他賣里遞來•油米弓•各</p>
<p>打肩•屋繪箔箭袋•一單彈可頂在頭上•那搖尼皆助語</p>
<p>d. 心肝丈夫 • 大心肝丈夫 • 遞弓來 • 放在我肩上 • 箭袋頂在我頭上</p>
<p>The characters used to approximate Japanese pronunciation here reflect the Zhejiang regional accent of the era. It should probably be noted as well that the</p>
<p>314</p>
<p>chinese understanding of the japanese language</p>
<p>waka and kouta themselves—all originally written primarily in kana— are now frequently difficult to read, and the Chinese-character explanations of these works provided by Li and Hao offer a helpful explanatory tool.23</p>
<p>There are many other Chinese texts of the late-Ming period concerned with Japan; many of these contain a handful of Japanese names or words with Chinese-character pronunciations.24 The ones discussed here, though, are the most important in chronicling the increased sophistication of Chinese perceptions of Japan, Japanese culture, and the Japanese language. This development did not, however, prove fecund in the centuries that followed, for scholars of the Qing period did not build on this emerging tradition of Chinese scholarship on Japan.</p>

<p><strong>Japan in the Qing Period: The Case of Weng Guangping</strong></p>
<p>The early years of the Qing dynasty coincide with the years when the recently founded Edo regime began to enact restrictive ordinances on travel by foreigners to Japan; they were to reside solely in Nagasaki, and their contacts with Japanese were curtailed as well. There were still, though, a number of Chinese travelers to the port of Nagasaki in the early- and mid-Qing period who wrote of their experiences. Few of these have anything to say concerning the Japanese language, though there are exceptions. One such exception from the Qianlong period (1736–96) is the Xiuhai bian (Essay from the sea of my sleeve) by Wang Peng, the subject of Ōba Osamu’s essay in this volume.25 Wang was a merchant who first went to Nagasaki in 1764 and then traveled between the two countries frequently thereafter. His account contains a small handful of Japanese terms with kan’yaku readings—for example, jishiliu (J. kiseru) for the long, narrow Japanese pipe.26</p>

In addition to describing his mission as an emissary sent to the Ryūkyū kingdom in 1534, Chen Kan (1489–1538) lists 407 Ryūkyūan words and how to pronounce them, and he appends the 46 hiragana syllabaries. They are written with pristine clarity (see Chen Kan, Shi Liuqiu lu, pp. 47b–48a).</p>

<p>chinese understanding of the japanese language 315</p>
<p>Before the changes brought about in Japan in the Meiji era and the beginning of a new Chinese tradition of writing on Japan from the 1870s and 1880s,27</p>
<p>there was really only one comprehensive new study of Japan by a Chinese of the Qing period. This work was the Wuqi jing bu (Commentary on the Azuma kagami) by Weng Guangping (Haichen, 1760–1843), a work that waited nearly two centuries before finally being published in 1997.28 The Azuma kagami (Mirror [or, Comprehensive history] of the East) is a medieval Japanese chronicle in 52 fascicles, written in literary Chinese by an official (whose name is now unknown) of the Kamakura shogunate (1165–1333), that describes in great detail the shōgun’s daily activities from 1180 through 1266. At the beginning of the Edo period, Tokugawa Ieyasu (1542–1616) so prized this work for its studied attention to the lessons to be derived from historical experience that he ordered it reprinted.29 The work then made its way to China amid the Sino-Japanese book trade at the end of the Ming dynasty; there is an edition dated 1626, with Japanese reading punctuation provided by the great Confucian scholar Hayashi Razan (1583–1657), held in the Beijing Municipal Library.</p>
<p>One of the earliest Chinese commentators on the Azuma kagami was the early-Qing scholar Zhu Yizun (1629–1709). As he later recounted the story: “In the jiachen [third] year of the Kangxi reign [1664], I was able to see this work at the Jigu tang (Hall for the Examination of Antiquity) of Mr. Gao of Guodong.</p>
<p>Forty-three years later I obtained it for my own bookshelf.” He also introduced the contents of the Japanese work, using it to criticize his countrymen’s ignorance of Japan. He also praised the Riben kao for laying out the customs and practices of the Japanese, but held it wanting, for in it the “hereditary chronicles of [Japan’s] rulers ( guowang) remain unclear.”30 Weng would heartily fill this lacuna.</p>
<p>27  See D.R. Howland, Borders of Chinese Civilization: Geography and History at Empire’s End.</p>
<p>28  Through the diligent work of two scholars from Hangzhou University, Wang Yong and Wang Baoping, Hōyū shoten (Kyoto) published the work in the late 1997. It still has not been published in China.</p>
<p>29  A preface dated 1605 to a Keichō (1596–1615) edition of the Azuma kagami  notes: “Our great shōgun Ieyasu frequently read from this work to learn about the experiences of the past in bringing orderly rule to the world, seeing its benefits, and reflecting on the bad. . . .</p>
<p>He ordered it to be printed so that it would be passed down for years and subsequent generations would be able to read it and distinguish clearly. Thus, not only would it be a clear mirror for the East, but indeed it was surely written as a warning for all.”</p>

<p>chinese understanding of the japanese language</p>
<p>While investigating the private, illegal minting of coinage along the coast in the Qianlong period, one official found coins engraved with the characters</p>
<p>“Kuanyong tongbao.” Upon investigation, he soon realized that China had never had a Kuanyong period, and thus he did not know where these coins had come from. As the search continued, no one else seemed to be able to solve this conundrum until a Suzhou scholar by the name of Wang Huiyin recognized the reign period not as Kuanyong but as the Japanese Kan’ei era (1624–44); he had read Zhu Yizun’s piece on the Azuma kagami in which the Kan’ei reign was mentioned. Jiangsu Governor Chen Hongmou (1696–1771) then reported to the throne that the problem had been resolved. He also learned of the existence of this Japanese text, but all his efforts to obtain a copy proved fruitless.31</p>
<p>Weng Guangping was a young man when this incident occurred. He was born in the village of Pingwang, Wujiang County, Jiangsu. Pingwang lies on the west bank of the Grand Canal at the crossroad of Zhejiang-Jiangsu traffic. By his own admission, Weng was a scholarly man who “by nature enjoys strange books.” He was also a noted painter and calligrapher with a number of other important works to his name. Unfortunately, he was born into a family always on the edge of poverty and was thus unable to support his scholarly inclinations as fully as he wished. After several failures, he managed to obtain the xiucai degree at the age of forty-six and the juren degree at sixty-one, and he was able to establish a reputation for himself as an erudite man. In his preface to Weng’s Tingying ju wenchao (Prose writings from the dwellings of listening orioles), the great scholar of the Tongcheng school Yao Nai (1731–1815) wrote:</p>
<p>“He is widely conversant with the numerous writings of classicists and historians, works of geography and phonology, and the Shanhai jing (Classic of the mountains and the seas), as well as with foreign lands and alien terrains.”32</p>
<p>Other contemporaries also praised his omnivorous reading.</p>
<p>How then did Weng Guangping happen on the Azuma kagami?  At some point he read Zhu Yizun’s essay as well as a note by Zhu’s friend Cai Cheng in the latter’s Jichuang conghua (Collection from the chicken coop) which told fascinating case in which the famed Cao Yin (Lianting, 1658–1712) happened upon a copy of the  Azuma kagami  and put it to interesting use. See Feng Zuozhe, “Cao Yin yu Riben, cong xin faxian de Cao zang Wuqi jing tanqi,” in Zhong-Ri guanxi shi guoji xueshu taolunhui lunwen, pp. 209–18; and Feng Zuozhe, “Sō In to Nihon, shin hakken no Sō In kyūzō</p>

<p>of both men’s affection for the Japanese text.33 This intrigued Weng. He finally came upon a copy of the text—made from Zhu’s own—in the private collection of a Mr. Wang of the Zhenqi Pavilion in Wulin. After reading it, he asked Wang if he might take it home to make his own copy, but Wang was reluctant to lend out this rare work; Weng thus returned several more times to read Wang’s copy further. Time passed and eventually he found another copy in the possession of the eldest son of the well-known scholar and Hanlin compiler Pan Jiatang (Lei, 1646–1708). This copy had been made from one formerly in the Shuizaixuan collection of You Tong (Xitang, 1618–1704). As Pan had noted of the text:</p>
<p>It covers only eighty-seven years. Every day contains a record of the weather conditions, much like the yinqing bu (records of darkness and clarity) kept by governmental offices in China. The language [of the Azuma kagami) is rough and does not convey its meaning as well as it might. One cannot read it just once. However, few overseas [i.e., Japanese]</p>
<p>writings have flowed into [China]. Through one month’s work, I copied it all out.34</p>
<p>Why did this particular text have such an impact on Weng (and others)?</p>
<p>Although it is still difficult to say with certainty, several factors suggest themselves. First, it was written, by all accounts, in a fine literary Chinese, something that not only Tokugawa Ieyasu and Hayashi Razan had recognized, but something which Zhu Yizun and other Chinese scholars also noted, although Pan Jiatang seems to have mildly dissented. Second, Ieyasu’s authority enabled it to be reprinted and make the reverse trip westward from Japan to China.</p>
<p>Among the several dozen Japanese texts that became known in China, no other one so stimulated Chinese interest in Japan itself. In fact, it is one of only two Japanese texts in the entire seventeen hundred-year history of Sino-Japanese cultural contacts that so widely circulated in China and inspired the composition of Chinese commentaries.</p>
<p>The more Weng investigated the text and compared it with other Japanese historical works known in China, such as the Nihon nengō sen (Japanese era names, with annotations) which had been brought to China by merchants, the more interesting he found it. This research also led him to discover errors in the Azuma kagami and inspired him to make a thoroughgoing study of Japanese history and culture, not just the 87 years covered in the Azuma kagami. He was 33  This note is reprinted in Weng Guangping, Wuqi jing bu, 30/14a.</p>

<p>318</p>
<p>chinese understanding of the japanese language</p>
<p>well aware of the fact that Chinese had not produced many studies of foreign lands; most of what did exist was contained in the treatises accompanying the standard dynastic histories. In his opinion, “Japan was the largest country of those in the Eastern Sea. . . . I wanted to pattern my work on the annals of historians and compose a comprehensive mirror for Japan” all its own.35 Hence, despite his title, Weng’s work went far beyond the Azuma kagami.</p>
<p>Altogether Weng used a total of over one hundred and ninety sources, some forty of which were works by Japanese written in literary Chinese; perhaps living in Pingwang enabled him to have access to many books brought by sea from Japan to China. He devoted seven years of his time, from 1807 to 1814, to this task, polishing the writing through five drafts, before completing this major text. Until just a few years ago, it had circulated exclusively in various manuscript editions of 28 juan and 30 juan in length.36 “It is like a gazetteer (zhi) in form,” he explained, “and is also called the Riben guo zhi (Gazetteer of Japan).”37 Seventy years later, Huang Zunxian (1848–1905) would also write a major work with this alternate title, though I have yet to discover any evidence of Weng’s influence on Huang.</p>
<p>The first ten juan, or fully one-third of the Wuqi jing bu, are shixibiao or historical annals. Perhaps responding to Zhu Yizun’s complaint that Chinese writings about Japan failed to elucidate the names of its rulers through the ages, Weng recounts in annalistic form (arranged by both Chinese and Japanese reign years) what he considered the most important events for every single year of Japanese history by sifting the through dozens of texts at his disposal.</p>
<p>These follow a complex effort on his part to sort out various theories about the historicity of the so-called “age of the gods”  (kamiyo).  In the somewhat fuller 30- juan edition of the text, there are then two  juan on geography, one of maps, two on customs, one on food and produce, one on commercial treaties, one on government posts, seven on bibliography, one on the Japanese writing system, two comprising a Japanese word list, one on the military, and one on subject states.</p>
<p>What follows will focus on an analysis of the three juan concerned with the Japanese language. In addition to these three juan, it should be noted, kana 35  Weng Guangping, Wuqi jing bu, 1/1a, 1b.</p>

<p>chinese understanding of the japanese language 319</p>
<p>syllabaries appear elsewhere throughout the Wuqi jing bu for no clear reason; there are over a dozen instances in the ten juan of the historical annals in which Weng employed kana  for a purpose that is now difficult, if not impossible, to surmise, especially since it is clear that he did not fully understand them.38</p>
<p>Juan 26 is extremely short, devoted to guoshu or “national writing” or the kana syllabary alphabets. Weng gives two charts here. The first is characterized as the “48 foreign symbols of Japanese” which appears to be a chart of the hiragana syllabaries in i-ro-ha order with the addition of the Chinese character shang (above) and, as in the case of the Riben kao, the Chinese character jing.</p>
<p>Most of the syllabaries are given in two forms, though it is unclear what difference there is between them, and each is followed by a Chinese-character transcription. Most of these are extremely difficult to decipher. The second chart lays out a total of sixty-one symbols of what appears to be the katakana syllabary in no particular order, again with Chinese characters for pronunciation. These are also not clearly written, and without the Chinese characters attached to each, it would be impossible to decipher many of them.39 These flaws may not be entirely Weng’s fault but of manuscript copiers who would have been even less familiar with Japanese than Weng.</p>
<p>Juan 27–28, entitled guoyu jie or “explanation of the national language”</p>
<p>(implying Japanese), comprise the now familiar word list of Japanese terms with Chinese characters appended for readings. It should be noted that over two hundred years had passed since the last major list of this sort had been published, in the late Ming. Weng provides 1,223 terms under 14 categories: astronomy, time words, and seasons (98); geography (17); the body (93); people (93); animals, insects, and fish (61); flora (60); foodstuffs (57); clothing (56); residences (19); instruments used aboard ships (154); numbers (22); personal affairs (154); colloquial expressions (69); and commonly used terms (105).</p>
<p>These are followed by 81 terms for the islands and domains ( kuni) of Japan, as are 26 ward names and 58 street names of Nagasaki.40 The pronunciations seem to reflect the southwestern Kyūshū dialect.</p>
<p>It remains unclear who first put this list together or when it was compiled.</p>
<p>Many of the terms in Weng’s list concern the Nagasaki-China trade, especially the items brought from Japan for trade. Watanabe Mitsuo has surmised 38  See, for example, Weng Guangping, Wuqi jing bu, 2/11a, 3/8b, 10b, 11a, 4/4b, 5/9b, 12b, 6/1a, 8/6b, 10/3a, 3b, 10b, 12a, 13b, 14a.</p>

<p>320</p>
<p>chinese understanding of the japanese language</p>
<p>that because the Jūzenji, a temple located at the Tōjin yashiki or Chinese Compound in Nagasaki, is part of Weng’s list, it must have been compiled after 1689 when that temple was built.41 The inclusion of many street and ward names from Nagasaki suggests that the original compiler may have come from that city or lived there for some period of time. It seems fair as well to agree with Fukushima Kunimichi and Watanabe that while Weng did not collect this list by himself he took it from a text, mentioned any number of times in the Wuqi jing bu, entitled Haiwai qitan (Intriguing tales from overseas), though this text has not as yet been tracked down.42 There was a text with this title that circulated in Japan (Kaigai kidan), a Japanese retranslation of a Chinese translation of the Chūshingura tale. This was not, however, the work cited by Weng Guangping. To his great credit, Weng recognized the superiority of the list of terms in this work to those included in the many late-Ming works (discussed above).</p>
<p>Many of the categories and terms listed in these two juan of Weng’s book can be found in other works from the late Ming, though a significant number were new in this genre of vocabulary. For example, while the inclusion of colloquial expressions was not entirely new, such a significant number (69) was unprecedented. Each Chinese expression is followed in slightly smaller Chinese-character transcription, set below and just to the right of the expression in question, of the intended Japanese term.</p>
<p>For example:43</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>回</p>
<p>不</p>
<p>己</p>
<p>再</p>
<p>色</p>

<p>42  20–21; Sanshū Nihon yakugo, p. 238. I was recently told by a Japanese scholar that the Haiwai qitan was a chronicle of the experiences of a shipwrecked sailor. See also Wu Anlong and Xiong Dayun ( Chūgokujin no Nihon kenkyū shi, p. 104) who state that this was an appellation attached by Chinese to the Azuma kagami which they found such an</p>
<p>“intriguing tale,” but they offer no evidence to support this hypothesis.</p>

<p>Several of the expressions under this heading still elude analysis.</p>
<p>A second significant addition in Weng’s list of terms is the large number (154) of those concerned with shipping, unprecedented in both size and variety. If not Weng, then whoever collected this vocabulary must have had contact, direct or indirect, with Chinese merchants who plied the trade route to Nagasaki. Many of these terms concern bookkeeping, measuring goods, and items transported.44 A third important innovation in Weng’s list is the extensive number of place-names, especially from the Nagasaki area. While there are readings given for all the Nagasaki toponyms, several of the “domain and island names” are given without readings. At least one of these places names is fictitious; Onnajima (lit., Isle of Women), a site in a play by the great writer Chikamatsu Monzaemon (1653–1725), and several others may be miswritten.</p>
<p>On the whole, though, the readings are extremely accurate, indicating the participation of someone who not only knew the Japanese language but knew the city of Nagasaki as well. For example:45</p>
<p>山</p>
<p>肥</p>
<p>土</p>
<p>出</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>城</p>
<p>後</p>
<p>佐</p>
<p>雲</p>
<p>島</p>
<p>羊</p>
<p>非</p>
<p>拖</p>
<p>因</p>
<p>密</p>
<p>馬</p>
<p>谷</p>
<p>撒</p>
<p>字</p>
<p>什</p>
<p>失</p>
<p>木</p>
<p>麽</p>
<p>羅</p>
<p>[ Yamashiro]  [ Higo]  [ Tosa]  [ Izumo]  [ Mishima]</p>
<p>Weng explicitly notes that his list of Nagasaki ward and street names came from a text entitled Dongyang keyou lüe (Traveler to Japan in Brief), but no one has yet been able to track down this work.</p>
<p>As noted, Japanese kana appear elsewhere in the text for no apparent reason, for example, on the first of five maps of Nagasaki and amid the descriptions of Japanese geography.46 At other points in the text, Japanese words for everyday items are given in Chinese-character renderings. For example, under Japanese “customs” Weng notes: “They use wood for their pillows and call them magula [J. makura]. . . . Tobacco they call danbag u [J.  tabako], and a pipe is a jishiliu [J. kiseru]. . . . Courtesans [in Nagasaki] wear a belt . . . known as a yaobei 44  Weng Guangping, Wuqi jing bu, 28/2b–5b; Ōtomo Shin’ichi and Kimura Akira, Azuma kagami ho shosai, pp. 28–34.</p>
<p>45  Weng Guangping, Wuqi jing bu, 28/12b–13b; Ōtomo Shin’ichi and Kimura Akira, Azuma kagami ho shosai, pp. 48–50.</p>

<p>322</p>
<p>chinese understanding of the japanese language</p>
<p>[J. obi].”47 Interestingly, makura and kiseru do not appear in Weng’s vocabulary list, and tabako and obi do appear but with different Chinese-character transcriptions: tabako as taiboge and obi as w upi.  This divergence can best be explained as different people or writings having been relied on for these two portions of the text.</p>
<p>From the larger historical perspective, Weng’s accomplishment is extraordinary. He put together a word list that, while far from the longest prepared by a Chinese, was innovative and rich in specific ways heretofore unknown in China. What is even more extraordinary, however, is that he did all this without knowledge of the Japanese language itself. The first response a contemporary scholar is likely to have after examining Weng’s treatment of the Japanese language is surprise that Weng apparently never bothered to learn the language.</p>
<p>In fact, it is highly unlikely that he ever met a Japanese, and he probably met few Chinese who had been to Japan. Learning the language and meeting the people of Japan were by no means easy feats in early nineteenth-century China, but at least some greater familiarity with the language would seem to be the barest necessity. It is now, of course, incomprehensible that a scholar would devote such attention to the study of Japan without learning Japanese.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>From Ming to Qing in Chinese Knowledge of Japan</strong></p>
<p>In order to probe this question of why Weng undertook this seven-year study of all things Japanese without learning the language and what this may tell us about the shift in Chinese views of Japan from the Ming to the Qing period, let us draw some data from a parallel cultural development: the shift in Chinese pictorial representations of Japanese from Ming encyclopedias to those of the Qing, a phenomenon studied by Professor Tanaka Takeo. Tanaka has demonstrated that in Ming encyclopedias Japanese are pictured as either domedheaded, long-sleeved, sagacious monks or topknotted, sword-bearing, barefooted, half-naked warriors, a point reiterated in the essay by Wang Yong in this volume. The image of warriors in particular reflected the over-weening Chinese perception of Japanese in this era. In Qing times, however, the Japanese in such drawings became fully clothed and more in line with the image of sagacity.48 The question then is: What exactly does this change 47  Weng Guangping, Wuqi jing bu, 14/13a, 15/2b.</p>
<p>48  Tanaka Takeo, “Wakō zu tsuikō: Shindai Chūgokujin no Nihonjin zō,” Tōyō daigaku bungakubu kiyō shigakkahen  46 .  18 (1992), p. 2. This essay is a follow-up to Tanaka Takeo, “Wakō</p>
<p>zu zakkō: Mindai Chūgokujin no Nihonjin zō,” Tōyō daigaku bungakubu kiyō shigakkahen</p>
<p>chinese understanding of the japanese language 323</p>
<p>reflect? Does it indicate an increased, more nuanced Chinese understanding of the Japanese?</p>
<p>The key reasons for this changing image of the Japanese were that the wokou menace was long over, there was extensive Sino-Japanese trade, and relations between the two countries were calmer than in the past. The decline of the threat of piracy meant that the imagery of the bloodthirsty marauders had given way to the more pacific metonymy of the wise, monk-like Japanese men-dicant; pirates from Japan had not completely passed from Chinese memory, as images of them remained in the popular imagination and popular culture. The renewed trade between China and Japan brought with it new, more civilized Chinese images of the Japanese, perhaps transmitted by Chinese observers at the Chinese Compound in Nagasaki. What is most important for our purposes, however, is not this shift in iconographic representations per se but what it reflected about changing Chinese views of and interest in Japan. Tanaka reads this change in representations not as an instance of maturing Chinese views of Japan but as the reassertion of China’s earlier lack of interest in foreign countries and cultures. The more complex images from the Ming period could be attributed to the immediate threat posed at the time which thrust the Japanese into Chinese cultural consciousness. Tanaka argues that Chinese knowledge of Japan then decreased in quality once again from Ming to Qing as this threat disappeared. Thus, the clothing or civilizing of images of Japanese represents not an important change based on more or better information about Japan but a reflection of less Chinese concern with Japan.49</p>
<p>Weng Guangping was completing his work some time after visual images of the Japanese had changed. Can we speak of his representations of Japan and the Japanese language in the same way as Tanaka discusses visual representations of the Japanese as ultimately reflecting a less complex understanding?</p>
<p>Clearly, his willingness to write extensively about Japan and its language without bothering to study that language bespeaks a certain arrogance somewhat difficult to appreciate two centuries later. Weng did nonetheless devote seven years of his impoverished life to this project—he did not take it lightly. The question remains, however, as to just what the ultimate aim of this project was.</p>
<p>While Weng spent a number of years studying Japan, in the final analysis he 41.13 (1987), pp. 1–26, which describes the Ming period. For an easily accessible example of these “clothed Japanese,” see the cover of Wu Anlong and Xiong Dayun, Chŭgokujin no Nihon kenkyū shi, which also incidentally includes in the background an old Chinese map of Japan with an island named “Onnajima.”</p>
<p>49  Tanaka Takeo, “Wakō zu tsuikō: Shindai Chūgokujin no Nihonjin zō,” pp. 2–3, 6, 7, 8, 12–13; Wang Xiangrong, “Guanyu Riben kao,” p. 247.</p>
<p>324</p>
<p>chinese understanding of the japanese language</p>
<p>was not a Japanologist in any sense of the word familiar to us. He did write a few other short pieces about Japan, but nothing even remotely on a par with the Wuqi jing bu.  50 His seven-year project was essentially a challenging exercise in textual research—a phenomenal one, to be sure—but not the magnum opus  of someone devoted to or even primarily interested in Japan studies. To be able to look back over nearly two thousand years of Chinese writings on Japan as well as Japanese writings in literary Chinese and attempt to chronicle the history, culture, and political and military institutions—as well as the language—of that land through an immensely complicated process of textual comparisons was a challenge that someone of Weng’s self-professed “nature”</p>
<p>could apparently not resist.</p>
<p>Had the Qing cultural environment supported an intellectual career in Japan studies, perhaps Weng might have made greater efforts to learn the Japanese language. However, inasmuch as the lack of cultural or symbolic capital associated with such an endeavor militated against such a career choice, it is understandable that he only planned this one project and learning Japanese may never have seriously crossed his mind. The very facts that Weng even viewed himself as a bit of an oddball (someone instinctively attracted to the “strange”) and that he was never able to get his work on Japan published in full may indicate the extent to which his whole endeavor, however extraordinary in retrospect, was out of touch with his own cultural and political milieu. Despite his lack of knowledge of Japanese, he saw the need for sections in his text on language, probably because such sections had become elemental to this Chinese tradition of writing about Japan since the late Ming.</p>
<p>We return to a question raised at the outset. How it is that in the midst of a scholarly movement aimed at the most intense linguistic and phonological research in Chinese history Weng did not use the new tools developed by his fellow kaozheng researchers to analyze the Japanese language? As suggested above, the answer undoubtedly lies in the fact that the textual critical movement of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries was not interested in language itself but in Chinese as the language of culture. For that reason, none of the many thousands of works produced by these truly great scholars addressed issues concerning any other languages and militated against Weng’s doing so himself.</p>
<p>50  Weng apparently wrote accounts of the Japanese tea ceremony and of Japanese art. See Wang Baoping, “Wuqi jing bu zhuzhe Weng Guangping kao,” in Zhong-Ri wenhua luncong, p. 154; Wang Baoping, “Azuma kagami ho ni tsuite,” in Azuma kagami ho: Chūgokujin ni yoru saisho no Nihon tsūshi, p. 4.</p>
<p>chinese understanding of the japanese language 325</p>
<p>Generally speaking, in late imperial Chinese history, two distinct aims have alternately motivated Chinese scholarly interest in the outside world. On the one hand, there is the utilitarian need to know one’s enemy so that one will survive. This is summed up well in the ancient classic on warfare by Sunzi: “If you know yourself and you know the others, you will always be victorious.” By the same token, there is the more broad-minded, universalist approach that the proper scholar should “investigate all things under heaven.” As the Chinese saying goes, “any single item left unknown marks the shame of the man of the world.”</p>
<p>Unlike his predecessors from the Ming, Weng was not driven to address the issue of Japan out of a concern for national defense. Knowledge of Japan had long passed from a national defense concern to an arcane intellectual pursuit. As a result of the “reverse” book traffic from Japan to China in this period, a manuscript of the Azuma kagami fortuitously landed in the hands of an unusual scholar devoted not to utilitarian matters but to the “investigation of all things under heaven.”</p>
<p>Weng and his work were largely forgotten soon after his death, save in the local area where he was born and raised. What influence, if any, he had on late-Qing thinking about Japan remains an important scholarly desideratum.</p>
<p>Did Huang Zunxian and others who traveled and lived in Japan from the 1870s and 1880s—as Weng Guangping had not—read the Wuqi jing bu? It was really only with China’s defeat in the Sino-Japanese War of 1894–95 that the Chinese turned once again to building their knowledge of Japan. It had been three hundred years since a threat from Japan stimulated such Chinese interest, and Japan’s military success in the international arena at the turn of the last century led thousands of Chinese students to pursue their own studies in Japan, to learn firsthand how to make Chinese rich and strong. Once again there was cultural capital to be gained through acquisition of knowledge of Japan and the Japanese language.</p>
