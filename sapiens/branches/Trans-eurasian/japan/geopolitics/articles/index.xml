      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1365238140995256321.html&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today marks the 85th anniversary of the &amp;ldquo;February 26 Incident&amp;rdquo; of 1936, when junior officers in the Japanese army tried to violently overthrow the government and &amp;ldquo;restore&amp;rdquo; direct control to the Emperor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Young officers associated with the Kōdō-ha (&amp;ldquo;Imperial Way Faction&amp;rdquo;) of the Army believed that &amp;ldquo;evil advisors&amp;rdquo; were deceiving the Emperor and sought to liberate him by assassinating the advisors and launching a &amp;ldquo;Shōwa Restoration&amp;rdquo; akin to the Meiji Restoration 7 decades prior. Issuing orders to approximately 1,500 enlisted soldiers under their command, the rebels marched out of their barracks into the snowy streets of Tokyo in the wee morning hours to try to seize control of the Imperial Palace and assassinate 7 senior leaders on their hit list. The rebels also occupied Police Headquarters, seized control of the Ministry of War, and attacked the left-leaning Asahi Shimbun newspaper. By 7:00 a.m., much of central Tokyo was in rebel hands.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The key reason why Hideyoshi&amp;rsquo;s invasion was halted was due to Yi Sun. The only time he wasn&amp;rsquo;t in charge, the Samurai destroyed almost the entire Korean fleet in a single battle. That&amp;rsquo;s how critical he was. But these days you have scholars like Kenneth Swope ascribing a larger than life role for Ming. Fact was throughout that massive war right to the end, the Ming-Joseon alliance was inferior to Hideyoshi&amp;rsquo;s forces on land. Had Yi Sun not come back post Chilcheollyang disaster, its anyone&amp;rsquo;s guess how things would have gone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Title: Defeat in first Sino-Japanese war a turning point that shocked China&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Author:  Ni Tao | August 5, 2014&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;sinking-of-battleship-zhiyuan&#34;&gt;Sinking of battleship Zhiyuan&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;UNDER the scorching August sun, a vintage, 90-meter-long iron-clad vessel, clearly an anachronism on the seas, is gradually taking shape in Dandong Harbor, one of northern China’s busiest ports.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The ship, scheduled to be launched in September, is not a merchant vessel, but an exact replica of famous Chinese battleship Zhiyuan, which sank in 1894.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sophia University&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Samidare-Sho&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Author(s): Miura Baien and Leon Hurvitz&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Source: Monumenta Nipponica, Vol. 8, No. 1/2 (1952), pp.  289-326&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Translations&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Samidare-sho&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By Miura Baien&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Translated by Leon Hurvitz, New York&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Samidare-sho is a minor work of Miura Baien, one in  which he strays off his main field, namely, economics. It is a polemic against  Christianity in what the Japanese isolationists of the time regarded as its  two most pernicious aspects, viz., its affront to &amp;ldquo;Confucian&amp;rdquo; reason and its  social function, that of driving a religious wedge into the social unity of the  Oriental peoples in order to soften up their countries for invasion, occupation, and exploitation by the Occidental powers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

They reached American soil early in 1872: the first leg of a trip that took top Japanese statesmen around the world, on a fact-finding mission, covering everything from factories to parliament buildings to opera houses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
