<h3 id="editors-introduction">EDITOR&rsquo;S INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>This essay is the second in a translation series edited by the Center for Research on the  History of Japanese Education at Indiana University. The purpose of the series is to make  important work by outstanding Japanese scholars of the history of Japanese education  available in English. W e plan to translate journal articles, book chapters, and historical  documents such Aizawa Seishisai&rsquo;s Preprandial Chat, The work was translated by Todd  Munson as part of his Master&rsquo;s essay in the Department of East Asian Languages and  Cultures at Indiana University, and was edited and revised by Professor Jurgis Elisonas.</p>
<p>Aizawa Seishisai (also Yasushi; 1781-1863) was a scholar-official of the Mito  domain, home to a syncretic ideology of xenophobic loyalism that held great currency  among disaffected samurai during the final decades of the Tokugawa period (1600-1868). In the influential work Shinron (&ldquo;New Theses&rdquo;) of 1825，Aizawa expressed the key issues  of the Mito school in impassioned prose. &ldquo;Men of high purpose&rdquo; (shishi) during the late  Tokugawa era seized upon his ideas as they moved toward radical action, and for this  reason Aizawa is considered a founding father of restorationist ideology.</p>
<p>Taishoku kanwa —a talk over pre-dinner appetizers referred to here as a  &ldquo;Preprandial Chat&rdquo;—was neither widely read nor taken as a call for radical action.  Nevertheless, it is worth attention for several reasons. It provides a brief but cogent  summary of the major points of Mito thought. It also holds an important place in the history  of education in the Mito domain since its composition is directly related to the founding of  the Mito domain school, Ködökan.</p>
<p>The daimyo of Mito, Tokugawa Nariaki (1800-1860), was a foremost advocate of  reform within the context of the bakuhan system. He hoped that an official domain school  might stem the tide of moral and cultural degeneration and return the realm~not just Mito—  to the halcyon days of the founding of the Tokugawa shogunate. In the sixth month of  1837 Nariaki commissioned Fujita Töko (1806-1855) to draft a charter for the proposed  domain school. Less than a year later the 491 word charter, known as Ködökanki (Charter  of the Academy for Broadening the Way), was inscribed in stone in the school garden in  the name of Tokugawa Nariaki, who had written the first draft. The school opened on a  provisional basis in the summer of 1841 and the formal opening ceremony was held in  1857.</p>
<p>Nariaki commissioned Aizawa Seishisai—co-head of the domain school—to prepare  Preprandial Chat in 1843 in order to make the concepts of the Ködökanki comprehensible  to &ldquo;beginning students and the unlettered.&rdquo; Submitted in 1841，the final text was neither  published nor circulated in manuscript form until after Nariaki&rsquo;s death in 1860. It received a  small readership after Aizawa&rsquo;s nephew had it printed and distributed it at the Ködökan.  Thus, the value of Preprandial Chat lies not in its profound effect on contemporaries, as  Shinron clearly had, but in its straightforward description of Mito thought, a complex and  syncretic ideology recast in plain language for the laym an~a sort of &ldquo;young reader&rsquo;s guide&rdquo;  to Mito learning.</p>
<p>The preface to Preprandial Chat is followed by the main body of the text, which is  in the form of a question-and-answer session between Aizawa and an unnamed young  student. The questions, adhering closely to the text of the Ködökanki, traverse a  predictably narrow range，but Aizawa&rsquo;s answers sketch in broad strokes nearly the entire  range of Mito thought. As such, the Preprandial Chat is likely the shortest route of access  to Mito thought of the Tenpö period (1830-1844).</p>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>In the year of earth senior and the dog of the Tenpö era [1838]，the Counsellor my  Prince founded the Academy for Broadening the Way, inscribed its Charter upon a stone,  and enunciated the fundamental principles for the cultural refinement of his people. His  subject Yasushi，of inferior learning, thankfully received his gracious command, and  along with Aoyama En’u supervises the instruction and ascends daily to the academy to  perform his official duties. Although I am but a base scholar, a clumsy “tile-breaker and  dauber of paint” 1 and do not even amount to a meager assistant, my aspiration  nonetheless is to preserve the teachings of the sages in some small way. In moments of  leisure after retiring from m y duties, I receive guests. The “youthflxl and inexperienced”2  occasionally seek me out. At other times，friends new and old also come by to engage in  discussion. As day passes into night, I light a candle, and our discussion often extends to  our Prince and his intentions in founding the academy.</p>
<p>One day， I gave a lecture before m y Prince. Quite composed， he spoke:  “Recently，I crafted the Charter for the Academy for Broadening the Way. However, its  meaning its multifaceted，and the substance of the text must therefore be difficult to  grasp. Discuss this with E n，u and others，and th en ~ u sin g common language~ m ake its  basic concepts comprehensible to beginning students and the unlettered.” I then  reverently withdrew, and upon withdrawing reflected upon m yself~ u p o n m y hardened  ignorance and biased leanings— and wondered if I was worthy of a fraction of his  confidence in me. However，the import of m y Prince’s words was such that I could not</p>
<p>refuse. That is to say, I conferred w ith E n’u and others, and we presented our respective opinions for adoption or rejection. Accordingly, I took up m y recent conversations with  various acquaintances and those termed “youthful and inexperienced，，，recorded them in  w riting and thus fulfilled my responsibility. It may be that m y ideas are useless and</p>
<p>unworthy of adoption; still, it is not necessarily always the case that rubbish has no use. Indeed，“the W ay is like a great road.”3 It emanates from H eaven’s constant laws,  and inheres in the immutable teachings that men m ust follow. Because the five  relationships exist, therefore the five teachings also exist.4 The people “use them every  day without realizing it;，，5 even if the teachings have not been written down，w hen the  people seek out the W ay amongst themselves there will inevitably be an abundance of  teachers.6 When a great road falls into disuse, however, brambles grow. When the five  teachings are not spread, the people cannot seek them out themselves. Therefore，the  W ay cannot broaden a man, but rather that which broadens the W ay is man_7 Thus it is  the responsibility of wise rulers and capable assistants to unify government and  edification, and in so doing to broaden the Way. Yasushi, though unworthy, is bly  faithful to his position and awaits the spread of the ruler’s moral edification among the  people.</p>

<p>Aizaw a Yasushi set</p>
<p>his hand to this.</p>
<p>Preprandial Chat</p>
<p>respectfully composed by Aizawa Yasushi</p>
<p>Having retired from the academy for the day, I was leaning against a stool and  looking over some written works when by chance someone came by to engage in  conversation. The discussion came around to matters doctrinal, and this person stated，  “N ot long ago，our Prince established in this domain an academy，entitled it the Academy  for Broadening the Way, inscribed its Charter in stone, and thus propounded his grand  design. Although I read the Charter, and seem to comprehend a fraction of its very  illustrious m eaning，I still cannot understand it in detail.I was hoping that you might  explain its particulars.”</p>
<p>I replied, &lsquo;T hough I am ignorant, for some reason I received the command to  supervise the instruction and humbly acceded to it. As my scholarship is shallow, I am  surely unequal to the task. However，as I long as I am debasing the teaching profession  for as much as a day, I cannot very well refuse to answer your questions. I shall certainly  not insist on the correctness of m y paltry opinions, but will merely respond as best I can  within the narrow range of my views. I ask of you，please engage a true scholar of wider  learning to judge whether I am right or wrong in these matters.”</p>
<p>M y guest spoke. “There are，then，a few questions that I wish to ask you. The  first concerns the meaning of the phrase from the classics which states that “men can  broaden the W ay.，，81 have heard that it means this: As the Way inheres in our nature，9  when one exhausts one’s nature w ith one’s heart the W ay is thus broadened. However,</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>the heart-nature is not mentioned in the Charterwhy does it seem to differ from the  prevalent interpretation?”</p>
<p>I replied, “It states in the Doctrine of the Mean that “accordance with one’s nature  is called the Way; to cultivate the W ay is called the Teaching，” 10 so it is of course  reasonable that to cultivate the W ay is，to wit, to accord w ith one’s nature. However, that  passage from the D octrine of the M ean is a discussion of the foundations upon which the  W ay is built. What does “broaden the W ay” mean, then? It means that although the  foundations of the W ay are indeed based upon according with one’s nature, it is diffused  in the world by means of the virtuous actions of men. To discuss the foundations of the  W ay is a separate m atter altogether. In these latter days，learning has descended upon all  classes. Even in discussing the W ay，men fix their gaze only upon themselves，thinking  that the Way refers only to governing one’s own heart-nature. However, the Way of  antiquity isjust as it is written in the Charterthe “great constant norm of Heaven and  Earth.，，11 Because H eaven and Earth exist，human ethics are naturally present，12 and  because human ethics exist, the five relationships are naturally present. Therefore, as  parent and child exist, parental intim acy exists; as ruler and subject exist, duty exists. All  of this is the Great W ay of the realm, the correct path13~ n o t the private words of one  man. As there exist sages above, government and edification are conducted, and the Way  is practiced in the realm; as they exist below，language is established，ability is cultivated,  and the W ay is transmitted tofuture generations.</p>
<p>“The Way is like a great road.” In places where the public travels，a road is  naturally formed when a place is trodden upon often enough. So “broadening the W ay”  refers to this: Along a natural road, post-stations are established, inns built, pack-horses</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>and couriers employed，and travel to the very corners of the four seas allowed to proceed  without delay. In other words，it refers to the wide-ranging effort to encourage all m en in  the realm tofollow upon the Great W ay of human ethics. As all of this is the product of  human effort, it is thus stated by the sages that “men can broaden the W ay.”</p>
<p>‘N ow ，our Prince founded the Academy for Broadening the W ay in the endeavor  to clarify the Great W ay that exists naturally in Heaven and Earth and to ensure that the  people’s travels go smoothly without their getting lost along various branch ro ad s~ th is  is，in other words, what is meant by “m en can broaden the W ay.” W ith the Great W ay  made clear, officials and commoners alike will all understand the direction in which to  proceed without becoming lost along crooked pathways. W hen this occurs, thenI  believe— the people will be able to expend their individual heart-natures and realize their  potential according to their respective measure of talent and virtue.”</p>
<p>He asked, “How the Deities built the foundation of the realm in ancient times has  been recorded in the Kojiki，Nihon shoki，Kogo shüi, and other sources, but I can find in  none of these texts any explanation of the “W ay of human ethics” and the like. In the  Charter it states that “It is that from which men must not deviate for even an instant，，，</p>
<p>evidently referring to the Way of human ethics. At the same time, it states that the  Deities established the ultimate standards, and it is this way that they follow ed~w hat is  the meaning of this?，，</p>
<p>I stated，“Though I a junior scholar, late in acquiring an educationreally ought  to shy away from impertinently meddling about when it comes to the facts of the Age of  the Gods，I will state m y trifling views and answer your question; but you should ask a</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>man of em inence whether or not I am correct. In the simple days of antiquity, the Deities  bestowed m oral principles without using words, instead demonstrating their meaning  through action. By showing their teachings through their actions, the gods thus made  them the laws of the people. The five ethical principles~ the five articles of ruler-ruled,  parent-child? husband-wife, elder-younger, and firiend-fiiend<del>are also called the five  codes. First，to speak of the duty of ruler and ruled: W hen Amaterasu Ömikami，residing  in the High Plain of Heaven, bestowed Heavenly rank upon Her Imperial Descendant,  Amatsu Hikohikohono Ninigi no M ikoto， She granted Him the three sacred  treasuresthe curved beads of Yasakani, the “Eight-Hand” Mirror and the sword Grass  Scythe</del>saying, “This Reed-plain-1500-autumns-fair-rice-ear Land is the region which  my descendants shall be lords of.，，14 Thus these sacred treasures were established  eternally as signs of Heavenly rank，and the great duty of ruler-ruled and parent-child was  demonstrated thereby. Reverence for Heavenly rank is endless along with Heaven and  Earth. The fact that from the day that Heaven and Earth opened forth until the present  day, not one person has ever violated Heavenly ran k ~ n o w , that is duty between ruler  and ruled. These teachings do not rely upon words; they inhere in nature.</p>
<p>‘And w hat of intimacy between parent and child? When Amaterasu Ömikami  bestowed the sacred treasures to Ninigi, She took the Precious M irror in Her hand and  said, “My child, when you look upon this Precious M irror, let it be as if you were looking  on me.” 15 The Precious Mirroralongside Ninigi in His bed, and with Him in His  h a ll~ th u s becam e the repository of the divine spirit of the Heavenly Ancestress, and  from this intimacy between parent and child was revealed. The ruler who succeeds as  Heir to the Sun is invariably the descendant of the Sun Goddess, and from the antiquity</p>
<p>6of the Age of Gods to the present day the Imperial line has not changed. The Precious  M irror, repository of the divine spirit of the Heavenly Ancestress, resides eternally in Ise.  Even to d ay ~ w h en the ruler who is Heir to the Sun worships at the Grand Shrines at  Is e ~ th e form reflected in the Precious M irror is in fact the bodily reliquary of Sun  Goddess, so the Jewel is consubstantial with the body of the Sun Goddess. Even in a  million years, the intimacy between these consubstantial bodies will never be exhausted;  there is no stronger example of the intimacy between parent and child than this.</p>
<p>‘Since the beginning of Heaven and Earth, from the time that Izanagi no Mikoto  preceded Izanami no M ikoto in reciting the song “Ananiyashi，” the distinction between  husband and wife has been clear. When Izanagi no Mikoto and Izanami no Mikoto,  dwelling in Heaven, engendered Amaterasu Ömikami, Tsukiyomi no M ikoto， and  Susanoo no M ikoto, They entrusted to Their offspring the responsibilities of rule, stating  that “Amaterasu Ömikami will rule the High Plain of Heaven, Tsukiyomi no Mikoto will  rule the Kingdom of Darkness, and Susanoo no Mikoto will rule the broad and tranquil  oceans.” Here is the order between elder and younger. The various deities Omoikane,  Tajikarao, Koyane, Futodama, Take M ikazuchi，Sarutahiko, and the like，unified Their  hearts, assisted the heavenly deities, used Their respective strengths to the utmost of  Their capabilities, and through Their friendship，promoted benevolence16~ th is is what is  known as the faithfulness of friends.</p>
<p>‘In this way, the teachings of the five ethical principles are rooted in the  beginnings of Heaven and Earth and have never changed to the present day. One who is  human cannot exist in the world for a single day while deviating from the Way of ruler ruled, parent-child, husband-wife, elder brother-younger-bother, and friend-fiiend. So</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>today the holiest ruler whom we revere and Amaterasu Ömikami are one and the same  substance. The great shoguns quelled the disorder of hundreds of years, and put the  multitudes at ease; the descendants of Our Lord of Eastern Radiance17 spread the rule of  the Heavenly Court across the realm ，and spare the people calamities such as military  revolt and banditry. The great provincial lords are the palisades of the Heavenly Court;  as delegates of the Great Shogun，they rule their various domains. Now, of those bom  w ithin these seas，of those who would be counted among the numbers of our people, is  there one who does not receive the benevolence of the Emperor, the shogun，and the  provincial lords? Therefore, could anyone for even an instant iail to desire to exhaust the  W ay of the five ethical principles, and recompense a fraction of the blessings of the state?  W hen the Charter says，“The Divine Sages followed this W ay，，，I believe this is the  meaning to which it refers.”</p>
<p>He asked, “What you have just said makes m e think that I am roughly able to  roughly understand the statement, “The Precious Crown by means of this is immutable;  the kokutai by means of this is dignified; the masses by means of this are at peace; the  barbarians and savages by means of this were conquered.，，18 But I should still like to ask  you to explain its specific details.”</p>
<p>I stated，“Regarding the immutability of the Precious Rank, it is as I have stated:  Amaterasu Ömikami bestowed the Three Sacred Treasures, and in so doing rectified the  duty between ruler and ruled; stated of the Precious M irror that “when you look upon it,  see my reflection，” and in so doing strengthened the intimacy between parent and child.  Thus She perfected the dual precepts of loyalty and filial piety, and the hearts of men</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>became unified and unmoving. Even after myriad generations have passed, the holiest  one whom we have revered as our ruler since the beginning of the world w ill not change.  Because the holiest ruler whom we revere today is consubstantial with Amaterasu  Ömikami，it goes without saying that the customs and manners of the people are in  themselves deepened, there are none who have designs on the Heavenly Rank, and the  Precious Crown is immutable.</p>
<p>‘As for the dignity of the kokutai: Even if countless nations exist beyond the four  seas, there can be but one in all of Heaven and Earth who is the most holy. In other  countries, the family name of those bearing the title of “sovereign” often changes and is  not fixed. In none of the myriad nations is there a Imperial line like that of our own  Heavenly Court, endless and immutable along with Heaven and Earth. This happy  paradigm has its origin at the beginning of Heaven and Earth, when the great principles  of ruler-ruled and parent-child were rectified，and the customs and manners of the people  were deepened. Accordingly，as Japan is so superior to the myriad nations，is not its  kokutai to be revered?</p>
<p>‘As for the peaceful security of the masses: In antiquity, heresy and heterodoxy  did not exist; rather, what the ancients called “the true spirit of the Deities” 19 existed as  indeed the Deities had taught it, as I stated earlier. Because the great principles of parent child and ruler-ruled were not in disorder，there never were great disturbances of the sort  that occurred in a foreign land, such as those of the “five barbarians” and the “sixteen  kingdoms.，，20 However, because fc4he constant norm of Heaven is a cycle of orderly rule  and disorder，” 21 during the long period of tranquility persons of high rank drowned  themselves in pleasure, the teachings of the Deities declined, and the W ay of ruler-ruled</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>and parent-child went awry. The Högen and Heiji disturbances occurred，and the  authority of the Court waned. There were also disturbances in the Juei，Jökyü，Genkö，  and Kenmu eras, and the four seas boiled over with disorder.22 Thereafter warfare was  incessant. O ur Lord of Eastern Radiance subsequently quelled the disorder, and for the  first time people were spared the weapons of warfare. Men could take саге of their</p>
<p>fathers and m others, their wives and children, and end their lives in tranquility. Because  the teachings of the gods were rectified, and the great principles of ruler-ruled and parent child had in fact not been extinguished, the world finally returned from disorder to</p>
<p>rectitu d e ~ is this not what is meant by “the masses by means of this are at peace?” ‘Moreover, the barbarians submitted, just as the prayer for worshipping the Great  Imperial Progenitrix states: “And you entrust the distant lands [to the Imperial Grandchild] as if casting myriad ropes about them and drawing them hither.，，23 Susanoo  no Mikoto crossed over to Shiragi; during the reign of the Emperor Sujin，the people of  M imana submitted; the Empress Jingü conquered Sankan, and then the Western  barbarians submitted; and the Emperor Keikö sent Yamato Takeru no M ikoto to conquer  the Emishi. By the reigns of Kanrnu，Heizei, and Saga, famous generals such as  Sakanoue no Tamuramaro and Fun’ya no Watamaro had been employed to subdue the  Emishi and drive them across the seas, and the Northeast regions w ere pacified. To cite a  single example, during the reign of the Empress Saimei conquest extended as far as the  Shukushin, and Imperial authority reverberated to distant lands.24 In later ages，the  assaults of the Jurchen, the M ongols and the like posed no serious concern. The Taikö  Hideyoshi struck at Korea, and his glory resounded across the oceans.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>‘Now then, as for the damage inflicted by barbarian ways upon the teachings of  the Deities: When the Indian W ay came to be practiced in the Land of the Gods，the  people’s hearts were for the first time not purely unified. Luxurious and pretentious  customs from the W estern Land infiltrated the Land of the Gods，temples and pagodas  were constructed, and since manors were donated to temples and exempted from taxation,  Court revenue decreased by half. As the men of antiquity themselves stated, all within  the four seas was reduced to poverty. The priests of Enryakuji, Köfukuji, Onjöji25 and  the like, made violent petitions and often violated the palace precincts; for this reason,  the Court itself knew no peace. In the northern regions the adherents of the Single</p>
<p>Directed sect ran rampant, and for this reason many of the successive provincial rulers of  Kaga and Echizen were either ruined or fell into decline. Even someone of Lord O da，s  ingenuity had to work his head off in battling the Single-Directed sectarians of  Nagashima, Ishiyama，and soforth.26 Despite the fame for loyalty won throughout the  realm by the warriors of M ikaw a，during the disturbances at Toro and Harisaki they took  up bows and arrows against their lords and fathers.27 And then, the adherents of the  pernicious faith of the W est arrived.28 By means of their duplicity, the barbarians  attempted to lead the people astray and convert the Land of the Gods into their tributary  state. However, Oda subdued the evil priests in the various provinces from the Enryakuji  on down, perceived the wicked plans of the W est, and attempted to drive back the  advocates of perniciousness. Although he iailed to do so, they were at last driven across  the oceans following Toyotom i’s rise to prominence.</p>
<p>4By the time of Our Lord of Eastern Radiance, the ban on the pernicious faith was  made ever stricter; by the K an’ei period [1624-45]，all efforts were exhausted to eradicate</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>it, and its roots w ere at long last extirpated. At that time it was said that foreign  barbarians told each other that “Japanese people have three eyes each,” and that they  trembled with fear.29 Thus the teachings of the gods were again rectified. Because the</p>
<p>Way of Human ethics is the Great Way of Nature, never to be abolished from Heaven  and Earth, the realm could once again return to rectitude. Must we not say, therefore，  that there is a connection between this and subduing the barbarians? Hence the  immutability of the Precious Crown, the dignity of the National Essence, the peaceful  security of the m asses, and the repulsion of the barbarians~these are not empty words,  but rather all m ay be seen in the course of actual events.”</p>
<p>He asked, “It says in the Charter that ‘&ldquo;the policies of governance and edification  of Yao，Shun，and the Three Dynasties were adopted to assist in the design of Imperial  rule.”30 However, in the Western Land they revere rhetoric，while in the Land of the  Gods we venerate essence; thus, our customs have always been different. Also, it is said  that because the customs of the Western Land and the Land of the Gods have become  mixed，the pure manners of old have been lost. What do you think of this notion?”</p>
<p>I stated, “In Heaven and Earth there is but one Great Way, not two. Essence and  rhetoric and are like the tw o wheels of a cart, and it is precisely because there is no  deviation between the two that it should be called the Great Way. Therefore even  Confucius stated that “W hen rhetoric and essence are blended you get the nobleman.’’31  The essence of the Land of the Gods is complemented by the rhetoric of the W estern  Land; in other w ords, this is the meaning of ‘Чаке up good from others, and with this  perform goodness.，，32 Now then, rhetoric has its own flaws, as does essence; so one may</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>speak of “duly blending rhetoric and essence，” but it is apt to be very difficult to put that  into practice. Be that as it may, the essence of the Land of the Gods，the rhetoric of the  Western L an d ~ th ese do not affect the W ay of the Five Relationships one whit.</p>
<p>‘As I have stated earlier, however, in the Land of the Gods the substance of the  five ethical principles has always existed, but a name for them has not. The flaw is that  where there is no nam e, the people are apt to lose track of the substance. Therefore，due  to the adoption of the names established by Yao, Shun，and Confucius, we are able to  understand the natural substance that has existed since the origin of the Land of the Gods;  this is what is meant by “assist in the design of Supreme rule.”</p>
<p>‘As for the phrase “govern and edify”： “govern” refers to governing a state by  means of a system of laws and institutions, while “edify” means edification in rites and  music.33 W hen a system of laws and institutions exists, but edification in rites and music  does not, it as if one，s limbs worked but the basis of one，s inner-nature was lacking. If  edification in rites and music exists but a system of laws and institutions does not, it is as  if the basis of one’s inner nature existed, but the limbs did not function. Unless  governance and edification are both present，governance becomes trivial，edification a  lifeless thing，and neither is of practical use. The governance and edification of the Land  of the Gods resembled a state where the foundation had been established, but the means  of making it function were lacking. And what of the governance and edification of the  Western Land? The foundation, that is，the duty of ruler-ruled and soforth, is not equal  to that of the Land of the Gods，but the tools are in place. Therefore, it is no wonder that  “adopting this and assisting in the design of Supreme rule” has made this Way all the</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>more great and all the more brilliant; this is what is called “blending rhetoric and  essence.”</p>
<p>He asked, “What is meant by the passage, “During the M iddle Ages and after,  heresy and pernicious doctrines deluded the people and deceived the world. Vulgar  learning and twisted scholarship rejects what is ours, and adheres to what is theirs.”</p>
<p>I stated, “The damage wrought by heretical doctrines from India，the W est, and so  forth，is as I have already outlined, and is well known. “Delude the people and deceive  the w orld，，’ indeed! People are required to do nothing more than fulfill the way of human  morality, and it is plain before one’s eyes that human morality concerns the trio of  ancestors, self，and descendants<del>that is, the past，present, and fu ture</del> and that the  human race w ill multiply inexhaustibly. Ignorant of these truths and depending instead  on airy conjectures, they postulated a separate theory of the Three Worlds, and stated that  the obligation to one’s lord and father are m erely transient connections. It naturally  followed that obligation became weak and the W ay of loyalty and filiality was rendered  insignificant.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Furthermore, they put forth the notion of “original prototypes and derivative  manifestations，，，in which the illustrious gods w ere explained away as derivations of  foreign devils,34 and the people’s feelings of reverence for the gods were diverted  elsewhere. “In Heaven there are not two suns; on Earth there are not two kings.”35 As  this statement points out, it stands to reason that there cannot be two who are the most  holy, but they cleverly argued that “there is under heaven one holier than the supreme</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>ruler, holier than the deities of creation.” Thus they deranged the masses. Is this not the  enormity of “delude the people, deceive the world?”</p>
<p>&lsquo;A s for the meaning of “vulgar learning and twisted scholarship rejects what is  ours, and adheres to what is theirs”： The only ones who read books during the era of war  were priests of Gosan temples and the like.36 Because they knew nothing of the kokutai to start with, it is no wonder that the only lands they revered were the likes of China and  India. In more recent times, otherssuch as adherents of old O gyu~referred to China  by such names as “The Middle Flower” and “The M iddle Kingdom，” while referring to  themselves as “Eastern Barbarians” or “East of the Sun,” something that subjects of the  Land of the Gods never ought to say.37 Also, when Arai and others term ed the Kanto  shogun “King，” they were in effect referring to the Heavenly Court as though it had been  eclipsed.38 In their attachment to a Chinese title, they violated the serious intention with  which Our Lord of Eastern Radiance reverently worshipped the Court. Both Ogyü and  Arai w ere heroes，and their works contain much of value; however, they could not escape  the malady of rejecting what is ours and adhering to that of another.</p>
<p>cAnd in our own times, there is the school known as “Imperial Learning.，，39 They  extol the sacred nature of the Land of the Gods，and this it must be said is both clear and  far-sighted. A great deal of what they say is exceedingly beneficial to public morality.  W hile what they stand for is certainly not “rejecting what is ours and adhering to that of  another” and in some ways is meritorious, for the m ost part adherents of this school are  ignorant of the basic outline of “governance and edification” and unenlightened regarding  the D eities’ methods of government. They situate human ethics outside of the Heavenly  Investiture, hold narrow views，propose peculiar theories，equate the w ay of humanity</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>with that trod by horses and cattle，approach Lao Tzu，Chuang Tzu，and Mo Tzu in  meaning, persist in clinging to personal biases, slander Yao and Shun，trifle about with  great men, and scorn the words of the sages. W hen it comes to the point where the  adoption of their teachings causes damage upon the profound intent to assist in the design  of Imperial rule in this our Heavenly Land, then that damage surely compares with that  wrought by the proponents of “rejecting what is ours and adhering to that of another.”</p>
<p>‘Accomplishments such as painting and poetry are another aspect of the field of  learning. However, by shelving the Great W ay of the Deities away in som e lofty tower,  and playing about instead with dazzling but empty rhetoric, by em bracing vanities, by  sneering at society and indulging in their egos, and wasting their lives traveling about in  search of pleasure, adherents of such arts fall into the style of Chuang Tzu and damage  the Way of human ethics. Theirs is not the W ay of the benevolent or the noble man. In  addition，there is what is called the School of Statecraft.40 Although it is of some benefit  to the enterprise of the state, its epigones are intent upon only gathering short-term petty  profit for themselves; relying upon their own personal and narrow knowledge, they do  not base themselves upon the Great W ay of the sages. Therefore, this group is by no  means free from the evil of putting profit first and duty afterwards.41 Then there are  those who advocate moral training strictly for personal gain, lack devotion to the truth of  recompensing the country and loving the people, and neglect the people and the state.  Although their trust in themselves is fine, their teachings approach the W ay of Yang  Tzu.42 This is the commoner’s mode of action and is not the W ay of the knight or  gentleman. Its evil is thus: Youths still w et behind the ears produce high-flown and  complex arguments, far from any practical use， and have no idea how to apply</p>
<p>16themselves to practical enterprise. This is contrary to sages’ W ay of completing one’s  self and things.43</p>
<p>‘There is also the “School of Textual Criticism，’544 that reflects upon antiquity and  maintains that later ages are deluded. A discourse on the Chinese classics based on  ancient readings is beneficial for scholars, but the problem is that the adherents of this  school compete with each other to be the most clever and original，and do not actually  discuss the great deeds and flourishing virtue of the sages.45 W asting time on useless  arguments, this group ends up in the same place as those who argued about the  “separateness of hardness and w hiteness/546 something of no practical benefit whatsoever.  W hat all this amounts to is allowing people to treat the writings of the sages as though  they were mere parlor games.</p>
<p>‘A lso，in recent tim es，w hat is known as “Dutch Learning” has come into wide  practice. By rights, it is nothing m ore than translating texts from Dutch into Japanese, the  duty of official interpreters in Nagasaki; as such it brings no harm to society. In this way  overseas conditions are ascertained, and the foreigners’ technical accomplishments can  be put to use in assisting the state. However, those who know nothing of the Great Way  of the Sages and have no settled views, idly look to Dutch studies and delight in clever  arguments. In the name of the “Exhaustive Investigation of Principle，，’ they inquire into  empty theories of grasses and trees, birds and animals, insects, fish, and soforth，and they  dissect corpses. Unaware of the ebb and flow of yin and yang on Heaven and Earth, they  debate capriciously the form of the sun, the moon, and the constellations, regarding them  as inanimate objects equal to m ere toys. Worst of all，they secretly believe in the  pernicious religion of the West, which is strictly forbidden in our state. Unabashedly</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>spreading the word that this religion actually is not pernicious at all，they mislead the  stupid masses. As it states in the work of m ilitary science，“do not let anyone talk of the  enem y’s good points.’^47 Those who pay no heed to the august intention to strengthen the  state’s defense against barbarians, although they dwell in that state，those who agitate  public sentiment and gradually come to revere the foreign barbarians in secret~they  should be branded traitors to the state.</p>
<p>‘Thus students in their discussions put forth various differing theories. Although  each of these theories has its own strong points，they are bereft of the great foundation  and in the dark regarding the G reat Way of the Divine Sages. Such obscurations of the  W ay are m any, and a great deal of them approach what is called “rejecting w hat is ours,  and adhering to that of another” as well. It says in the classics, “Even in “small ways”  there is something worth being pursued. But if taken toofar，there is danger of their  proving a hindrance; therefore, the nobleman does not follow th e m ,548 Similarly, those  who pursue biased, private theories not based on the Great W ay follow w hat are all  “small ways,” go toofar, and without fail become bogged down. This is，in other words,  “twisted scholarship.” Therefore, heresy and pernicious doctrines, vulgar learning, and  twisted scholarship~ the negative influence that flows from this evil is exceedingly  plentiful; consequently, in the august words of the Righteous Prince,49 those who cling to  a particular bias represent a “heresy within the world of scholarship•”</p>
<p>‘Accordingly，could anything be more natural in the present day than m y Prince’s  desire to uncover the delusion of the world and his profound intention to clarify the Great  W ay? A t this tim e，provided that those who aspire to study endeavor to ground  themselves in the Great Way of the Divine Sages，employ their hearts profoundly, open</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>themselves to insight, plant the great roots of study, and do not err at the crossroads, then  they m ay undertake whatever studies they wish, even the course pursued by the adherents  of the types of “twisted scholarship” listed above. For if the strong points of each are  realized and put to the use of the state, then what harm can they cause? of course, even  what are called “small ways” all exist within the Great Way. As long as the foundation is  not abandoned, both the Great and small Ways can therefore proceed side by side without  contradicting one another.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Although in the Charter “the middle ages and thereafter” is a passage that refers  to a time prior to “Our Lord of Eastern Radiance quelled the disorder and returned the  realm to rectitude，” every item I have enumerated earlier as a cause of great harm to the  state has been broadly discussed; consequently，as I do not wish to become bogged down  any further in the surrounding passages，I thus mention to you these general principles of  twisted scholarship and heretical doctrines up until recent times，and in so doing answer  your question.”</p>
<p>H e asked, “Because even children and errand-boys know that Our Lord of Eastern  Radiance quelled the disorder and returned the realm to rectitude, it is unnecessary for  you to explain it. But what does “revere the Emperor, repel the barbarians” refer to?”</p>
<p>I stated, “Our Lord of Eastern Radiance had the virtue of respectful modesty. He  accumulated vast riches and held all within the four seas in his grasp, but he did not  intrusively wield the authority of his wealth and power. He often ventured to the capital  to attend at Court, and rectified the duty between ruler and ruled. During the era of  military disturbances, all those from the holiest ruler down to the nobles and courtiers had</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>suffered in absolute poverty. Our Lord of Eastern Radiance ordered the expansion of the  cramped quarters of the Palace, made repairs，augmented the rice paddies dedicated to the  Emperor，ensured an abundance of supplies, restored lost arcana and objects of art to the  throne, revived the office of court musician, and selected the legislation for the Court.50  Even the old practice, long since abandoned, of rebuilding the Grand Shrines of Ise every  twenty years was reinstated for all eternity.</p>
<p>‘Moreover，during the time of turbulence, the Court lacked income, and great  rituals such as the Accession Ceremony and Great Thanksgiving Ceremony were not  perform ed because only a few families such as Öuchi and M öri contributed to the  expenses of the accession rites.51 It is true that in the time of Lords Oda and Toyotomi  these funds were not lacking as such, but it was Our Lord of Eastern Radiance  w ho<del>revering the Court even m ore</del> ensured that these great ceremonies be held in all  perpetuity. Later, the Classification of Rites and Ceremonies^ com piled by the Righteous  Prince, was presented to the Court.52 Accordingly，the Court was in complete possession  of ritual and ceremony, and I have heard that because the shogunate supplied the funds,  long-abandoned ceremonies were completely revived and conducted during each and  every reign. These are all examples of what is meant by “revere the Emperor.”</p>
<p>‘Even in times of peace, Our Lord of Eastern Radiance did not forget the age of  disorder. He warned constantly that should Japan neglect the m ilitary arts during times  of peace, it would invite foreigners to encroach upon Japan. On hearing of warlike  activities in barbarian countries, he urged, select experts in the m ilitary arts to keep the  foreigners in check! Internecine strife, whether one wins or loses，affects only the  prosperity of the house in question; losing a conflict to a foreign country, however, would</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>be the shame of the entire country of Japan {Nipponkoku\ he cautioned. Thus Our Lord  of Eastern Radiance was deeply suspicious and perceptive of the plans of W estern  heretics to encroach upon the Land of the Gods and issued extremely strict prohibitions  against them. Lord Taitokuin and Lord Taiyüin continued these policies53 and by the  K an，ei era had executed them all. Thus the roots of permanent damage were eradicated.  Our national prestige reverberated toforeign countries, all thanks to the profound plans  and far-reaching vision of Our Lord of Eastern Radiance. This what is meant by the term  “repel the barbarians.，，</p>
<p>He asked, “of all the numerous sages of ancient times, only Yamato Takeru no  M ikoto was revered by the Majestic Prince5 4 why was this so?”</p>
<p>I stated, “Because the import of the Majestic Prince5s reverence has not been  handed down in any written sources, I do not know the reason why this was so and can  only make a feeble estimate. However, if I m ay be allowed to proffer my own humble  opinion, let m e state the phrase “the barbarian tribes disturb our bright great land，”55  which refers to something that distressed Shun greatly. In the ancient period of the  Heavenly Court, the Kumaso and the Hayato numbered among the barbarians that  harmed the people，but none matched the Emishi in vehemence. They abounded in the  areas of Hitachi，M utsu，Shimotsuke，Közuke，Echigo, and Dewa，and the good people  had not a single day of peace. Yamato Takeru no M ikoto，prince of the Emperor Keikö,  was a man of peerless bravery. Wielding the divine power of the Precious Sword Grass  Scythe, he subjugated the Emishi in Hitachi and Mutsu and brandished Imperial authority</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>there. Consequently, the barbarians were driven out for generations to come, the Emil  were finally subdued, and for a long time their m ischief ceased</p>
<p>‘The M ajestic Prince was the son of Our Lord of Eastern Radiance, a mani  transcendent bravery who occupied the territory of Hitachi and pacified the Northeas  Therefore, I would venture to surmise that the M ajestic Prince proceeded with tb  resolute intention to build an eternal palisade of the Heavenly Court by suppressing thl  barbariansall in the manner of the valiant accomplishments of Yamato Takeru в  M ikoto. Moreover, the Yoshida Shrine— an Eminent D eity’s Great Shrine, one whöi  Yamato Takeru no Mikoto is worshipped as a d eity ~ w as close to the Great Castle.56 Lj  it any wonder, then，that the Majestic Prince endeavored to recall this deity’s meritorious  virtue and authority, and strove to emulate Yamato Takeru no M ikoto? In so doing，th*  Majestic Prince preserved our sacred land, and the people were greatly contented. Maj  we not suggest that he felt such reverence and longing because of his feeling for actual  affairs? Because of this, the W ay of the Gods was revered, the sinister w ay of the  barbarians stamped out, armaments prepared，and the means to repel the primitives  completed. Such accomplishments as these all arose from the M ajestic Prince’s high1  aspirations. Accordingly, I venture to suggest that his love for the ancients w as not like  that manifested by those whey-faced scholars who merely mimic the appearance and  words of others.”</p>
<p>He asked，“W hen the Righteous Prince was eighteen, he read the biography of  Po I and was deeply moved, came to love study，resolved to compile a history, and  fulfilled duty by handing over his realm ~ these are things that people know .57</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>Accordingly, he revered Confucian teachings ever m ore，clarified human ethics, rectified  moral obligations, and became a palisade of the state: this，too，is all quite evident.  However, whereas the M ajestic Prince longed for Yamato Takeru no M ikoto, the  Righteous Prince was moved by the tale of Po I. It is said that “filiality is following  one’s aim，”58 but there is no trace of similarity between Yamato Takeru no M ikoto and  Po I. Furthermore, because there is a distinction between the deities of the Land of the  Gods and the sages of foreign lands, was the august will of the Majestic Prince somehow  unusual?”</p>
<p>I stated，“Akhough Yamato Takeru no Mikoto and Po I do not appear to be the  same, the Righteous Prince felt that in actuality they proceeded along the same track.  Because the Righteous Prince was established as an heir，his older brother having been  passed over, he was moved by the duty of Shu Ch，i，s bequeathal of the realm, and was  deeply interested in its resemblance to his own experience. Thus he loved study because  he would carry out in actuality what he had studied of the W ay of the Sages; accordingly,  he revered this W ay, and established the Ming loyalist Chu Shim-shui as an instructor  and ritually deferred to him as a disciple.59</p>
<p>&lsquo;The compilation of a history, too, had as its basis his grand aspiration to clarify  supreme duty in the realm and clarify human ethics for the realm ’s future generations. In  no w ay did it resemble the work of scholars who put empty theories on paper.  Accordingly, in his reverence for the W ay of the Sages, he put the W ay of “conquering  one’s self and ruling the people” into practice, recording instructional provisions for the  warriors and the people. M aking the five relationships the foundation，in his compilation  of the Great History the Righteous Prince added the Consort Jingü to the list of female</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>Emperors, established the Emperor Ötomo in the historical records，and legitimized t|  Sons of Heaven of the Juei and Engen periods.60 These classifications ensured that:  future generations, the realm &rsquo;s subjects would not mistake supreme duty; these were и  empty theories jotted down by the stroke of a pen, but were the actual clarification  human ethics.</p>
<p>‘In this way, the Righteous Prince became a palisade of the state. of great benei  to the realm w as that all of this was a concrete effort to carry out the will of the Majesti  Prince. Therefore, the Righteous Prince studied the W ay of the Gods, wiped out sue  evil customs as establishing Buddhist temples within shrine precincts and fostering tb  belief that Buddhas were “original prototypes” of the Deities, returned to the Singula  Way of the G ods,61 revived the Yoshida Shrine，followed in the footsteps of Yamati]</p>
<p>Takeru no M ikoto and completed the work He had left behind, and undertook militan  preparations. In all of these affairs, the Righteous Prince clarified supreme duty, polish®  his honorable principles and sharpened his w arrior’s courage. When viewed as a whok  we see that the Righteous Prince was only expressing his adherence to the Majestit  Prince’s intentions.</p>
<p>‘From this same sort of far-sightedness, the Righteous Prince, wishing to enact  moral reform within the domain，decided to establish an academy in order to provide his  subjects with an education. Until that time, the very term “academy” was still quite rare.  The Righteous Prince asked Shun-shui about the plan of the Ch’ueh Li Shrine and had a  small version constructed. Afterwards, when the shogunate built the Taiseiden, this  small version was copied directly as a model, and it became a revered locale for scholars  all across the realm .62 As for academies, it is thus: In antiquity there was the university</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>in the capital and provincial schools in the various provinces for the education of  officials’ sons.63 However, during the days of the great disturbances, they fell out of use  and were no longer maintained. W hen he had quelled the disorder, Our Lord of Eastern  Radiance summoned Fujiwara Seika and Hayashi Döshun，64 inquiring into the heart of  the sages’ teachings and personally debating the meaning of such terms as “all-pervading  unity,” “equilibrium and harmony，，’ and “principles and force.” 65 He sought out old  copies of such works as the Shoku Nihongi and had them emended, and ordered the  printing of a great number of works such as the Ch un Shu Chih Yao, which were made  using movable copper type.66 W hen one views all of this，the extent to which Our Lord  of Eastern Radiance loved study m ay be readily surmised.”</p>
<p>‘In addition， the Academic Institute67 was established at the Shinobugaoka  m ansion of the Hayashi family. It has since been moved to the district of Yushima，and  its regulation has been broadened. That Our Lord of Eastern Radiance loved study is the  source of everything of this nature; thus，both Lord Taitokuin and the Reverent Prince of  Owari revered Confucian teachings, the Southern Dragon Prince of Kii and our own  Majestic Prince worshipped the W ay of the Gods，and the Righteous Prince revered the  Heavenly Court and engaged in the Conflician arts.68 That they required the teachings of  the sages had its reasons; it was not a momentary enthusiasm. Therefore in the present  day should we not, as retainers, spread the teachings as they are recorded in the Charter,  elevate the virtue of Our Lord of Eastern Radiance, the Majestic Prince, and the  Righteous Prince, and be obedient to the profound meaning behind the foundation of this  academy?”</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>He asked, “In ancient times aem es of superior merit were many. of these, the  one that is singled out by our Prince is Take Mikazuchi no Kami because, the Charter  states, “He assisted in Heavenly endeavors during the time of confusion and darkness,  and His powerful spirit resides in this land,” However，the Way that we are presently to  broaden is the Great Way of the realm. In order to broaden the Great W ay of the realm,  and to recompense the blessings that have flowed from its roots, it does not seem as  though we should limit ourselves only to those deities whose powerful spirits reside in  this land.”</p>
<p>I stated,</p>
<p>“This Way is as I have described previously: As Heaven and Earth exist,  human ethics exist; as human ethics exist，the Great Way of Nature exists. This, in other  words，is the Way of Heaven and Earth. Therefore, during the beginnings of Heaven and  Earth, as Amaterasu Ömikami bestowed the Sacred Instruments to Her Imperial  Descendant, the Way of loyalty and filiality was demonstrated and the Great Way of  ruler-ruled and parent-child was clarified. When the Emperor Jinmu unified the realm and ascended to the throne at Kashihara Palace，the proprieties of ruler and ruled were  thus rectified further; when Jinmu established a ritual site in Tomiyama, and expressed  his filiality to the Heavenly Imperial ancestors, the feeling of obligation that a child owes  its father increasingly prospered. Therefore, in the present day, subjects of the realm serve their fathers and serve their lords. Who is there that would not revere the  enlightening teachings of the Emperor Jinmu, teachings that originated with the Heavenly  Imperial Ancestress? In order to recompense the blessings of these enlightened teachings,  then, it is quite obvious that we must return to the roots and worship the Emperor Jinm u  and Amaterasu Ömikami.</p>
<p>26&rsquo;However, in the present, we are most thankful for the holiest ruler. A heavenly  descendant of the Sun Goddess, the Emperor holds the Heavenly Rank, and because the  Emperor worships the Imperial Ancestress Amaterasu, ‘4he hearts and virtues of all  within the seas are made the same.”69 If we expend our efforts for the Heavenly Court  with sincere respect, then that respect will of itself pass from us to the Imperial  Ancestress Amaterasu.</p>
<p>4 Also，as it states in the Book of Rites，“The Emperor w orships Heaven and Earth,  while the lords worship the mountains and rivers of their own domains,” and ‘4he feudal  lords are not descendants of the Emperor，，，70 the Counsellor m y Prince respectfully  renders his utmost services to the Imperial House. In pacifying the eastern lands and  bestowing enlightened teachings，m y Prince was recompensing fundamental blessings  and acting out of dutiful propriety. Our Prince’s territory is H itachi，and because the  shrine of Kashima is the foremost shrine of Hitachi, he worships this deity.</p>
<p>‘What were the valorous accomplishments of this deity? As may be seen in the  histories, when Amaterasu Ömikami was about to bestow it to Her Imperial Descendant,  the land was not yet at peace. This deity, sent as an emissary to Önamuchi no Kami,  consecrated this area and dedicated the land. The Imperial Descendant then made His  advent in Tsukushi, and Sarutahiko no Kami arrived in Ise.71 Details of the august  achievement of the Deity of Kashima are lacking in the historical sources, but it is  believed that at this tim e He conquered the eastern territories. And th u s~ a s they are  consubstantialF utsunushi no Kami resides in Shimösa no Kuni，while Take M ikazuchi  no Kami dwells in Hitachi. However, when viewing the multitude of deities worshipped  in the regions of Hitachi and M u tsu ~ th e Deities of Kashima and K atori,72 the</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>Descendant of the Kashima Deity, and the Descendant of the Katori Deity атщ th e m f r o m the Deities of Kashima and Katori down to their descendants, counties!  generations of deities have expended great effort in pacifying the eastern territories in the  cause of the Heavenly Court.</p>
<p>‘A lso，when the Emperor Jinmu subdued the m iddle lands, Take Mikazuchi no  Kami bestowed the Sword of Futsu no M itam a upon Kumano Takakuraji, and offered it  to the Exnperor，w ho<del>invigorated w ith the spirit of a thousand arm ies</del>crushed the  powerful enemy and met with great success. Accordingly the meritorious deeds of this  deity do not merely extend to the eastern territories alone. The advent of the Heavenly  Descendant, the Great Progenitor’s pacification of the middle lands， and the vast  greatness of the magnificent deeds of this d eity ~ a ll of these exploits extend to the entire</p>
<p>realm.</p>
<p>cAnd so, our Prince’s worship of this deity bears the meaning of the pacification  of the eastern lands，becoming a palisade of the Heavenly Court, and recompensing the  blessings of Amaterasu and the Great Progenitor. As long as his officials and his people,  too, turn back to those origins and recom pense those ancestral blessings, reflect upon  those w ho assisted in Heaven’s norm ative processes in antiquity, m ake identical their  hearts and their virtues, and revere the Heavenly Court, then it stands to reason that this  reverence is transmitted to the Heavenly Imperial Progenitrix as well. Accordingly,  understanding the fact that this W ay is the Great Way of Heaven，Earth, and Nature for  which the ultimate standards were established by the Deities in antiquity; understanding  that the teachings of the loyalty and filiality of the Heavenly Ancestress and the Great  Progenitor cover the four comers of the realm ，and that the meritorious deeds of Take</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>M ikazuchi no Kami are many; following the will of the deities and clarifying the Great  W ay in the realm; endeavoring to realize the profound intention demonstrated in the  manifest teachings of the Heavenly A ncestress~this，in other words，m ust be the true  intention of worshipping this deity. Thus, even though the object of our worship is the  deity of one province, if one thereby reveres the Imperial Family，and clarifies that Great  Way in the realm, those actions will be of great m erit，making one worthy of following in  the path of Take M ikazuchi no Kami. I surely believe that is why to worship this deity  and not others is the profound intention of our Prince.”</p>
<p>He asked, “The establishment of a shrine to Confucius is described in detail in the  Charter. Nevertheless, I wish you would explain comprehensively and precisely for the  benefit of beginning students.”</p>
<p>I stated，“The Way of Y ao，Shun, and the Three Dynasties is the W ay that  clarifies human ethics; thus, to the extent that human ethics exist in the ten thousand  countries across the four oceans，the W ay reaches every one of them. As it is applied to  quotidian affairs and practised constantly，it being impossible to deviate from it for even  an instant, so it is also called the “Comprehensive Way of All Under Heaven.”73 In other  w ords，it is the Great W ay of Heaven and Earth. Although even foolish men and women  may be able to partake of the W ay and put it into practice, when there are no teachers the  W ay is impossible to understand, and people approach the level of the birds and beasts.  Therefore, through Y ao，s “rectification，straightening, helping, and giving of wings，’，</p>
<p>Shun’s deepening of the five codes and use of the five classes of ceremonies, and through 29</p>
<p>the diffusion of the five teachings of filiality, duty, distinction，order, and faithfulness,  people were able to rise above the level of the birds and beasts.74</p>
<p>&lsquo;Confiicius then took the splendorous works of the sages and brought them to  perfect completion.75 He handed down the teachings of Yao and Shun as though they  were his ancestors,76 brought to their teachings an even greater clarity, and thus furnished  a model of human ethics for later generations. This is what the Charter means by “In this，</p>
<p>the Way of Yao, Shun, and the Three Dynasties is blended.” The teachings of Confücius  were introduced to the Land of the Gods in the reign of the Emperor Ojm. The Analects was the first text to be transm itted and then the classics of the sages gradually came to be  taught~ these are things that everyone knows. Because the W ay is the Comprehensive  W ay of All U nder Heaven，it w ill naturally be put into practice within the fom seas and in  the myriad countries wherever and so long as human ethics exist.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Barbarian lands，however, are countries of a deviant spirit. In what they consider  to be their doctrines, there is m uch of a deprived and perverted nature，with human ethics  obscured. The Land of the Gods and the Land of the Han both are located on the Eastern  Sea, facing the direction of the rising sun. So they are situated where yang is generated;  thus both are countries of the correct spirit, and their teachings are correct. As I have  explained previously, they have been endowed with the teachings of the five relationships  since the beginnings of Heaven and Earth. In the antiquity of the Land of the Gods，the  people were simple and pure, and w ere naturally in accord with the Great Way of the  Deities. Nevertheless, to proceed from essence to rhetoric is a constant of Heaven and  Earth. Consequently， because the names of what are called the “nam ed  teachings”77—<del>loyalty, filiality, benevolence, duty, and soforth</del> w ere not yet established,</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>the people easily became lost along the many side-paths. Thus by the various names used  in the Land of the H an~ loyalty, filiality, benevolence, duty, and soforththe illustrious  virtue of Confucius was taken as a model, and human ethics were clarified. This is the  m eaning of ‘Чаке up good from others，and w ith this perform goodness，，’ and, in other</p>
<p>w ords，is “revere that virtue, and contribute to those teachings.’，78</p>
<p>&lsquo;However, the Great Way of the Sages has expanded broadly. Down to the  present day，serving one’s lord and father, supporting one’s retainers，making harmony  between husband and wife, brothers, and friends, being able to differ from the birds and  the beasts~ these are things that have happened for a reason, not by chance. In founding  a school and worshipping Confucius, our Prince shows that their origins are not forgotten.</p>
<p>This is what the Charter means by “endeavoring to inform the people that this did not  happen by chance.” Therefore, to worship at shrines of the Deities, as well as temples of  the Sage，to know the basis of the D eities，teachings，to clarify human ethics, and then to  endeavor to put these studies into actual practice~ this must be his profound intention of  worshipping the Deities.”</p>
<p>He asked, “the deity of Kashima is a military deity，Confucius a sage of civil  virtue. So it would appear that whereas the shrine houses the deity worshipped by  warriors, the temple of the Sage is where the literati should worship. Why, then, are civil  and military officials alike now made to worship at both shrine and temple equally?”</p>
<p>‘I stated, ‘4vhat is now known as “civil and military” refers to the civil and  military arts. For men of old，“civil and military” referred to the Civil and M ilitary Ways.  Skills in the use of the sword, spear, bow, gun, and soforth，are the military arts.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>Understanding ceremony and decency，following the path of the warrior, seeking to  exemplify fidelity to principle, becoming the “shield and buttress’’79 of the state~ th is is  the M ilitary Way. Reading literature, interpreting the classics, learning the ancient texts  by rote; skill in prose, poetry, calligraphy, arithmetic, and the likethese are all civil arts.</p>
<p>M aking loyalty, filiality, benevolence, and duty the foundation; being well versed in the  G reat Way of the Deities; discerning the conditions of the state; “being head and heart to  one’s prince” 80~ t h i s is the Civil Way. Therefore, when discussing the arts, we  differentiate between the civil arts and military arts. When the Way is discussed,  how ever，the Civil W ay and the M ilitary Way m ay be likened to the two wheels that  m ake a cart fimction: a cart cannot goforward if one wheel is disconnected from the  other.</p>
<p>‘Accordingly，in antiquity, what was known as the Arts of the Way81 w ere learned  by men as a single entity. W hen the arts are present but the Way is lacking，it is similar  to archery of Yi. Rather than an art，it turned into an impairment.82 Now, of the six arts  of old，ceremony, music, calligraphy, and arithmetic were civil; archery and charioteering  w ere military. Accordingly, in learning the arts, the civil and the military were learned in  combination w ith the other. Thus it was stated by Confucius that “A man of civil affairs  m ust possess military training.，，83 Moreover, the four teachings of the Conflician school  are letters，ethical conduct，loyalty，and faithfulness.84 “Letters” include poetry and  calligraphy, as well as the six arts. Archery and charioteering being two of the six arts,  w hat is military is comprehended within the civil，and civil and m ilitaiy affairs do not  branch off into two separate pathways. Although the deity of Kashima is a m ilitary deity,  H is assistance in Heavenly affairs during N inigi9s advent and the bestowal of the</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>Heavenly Ancestress，manifest teachings must be spoken of as civil virtue. Although  Confucius was the sage of civil virtue, we may also see that he possessed m ilitary virtue:  H e discussed augmenting armaments, foiled the violent assault by the ruler of C h’i at the  m eeting in Chia-ku，destroyed the three cities, and advocated the punishment of C h’dn  H eng.85 As this is all widely known, however, I need not comment upon it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Similarly, with respect to the need to combine of the civil and the military, our  Sovereign Realm and the Land of the Han are the same in principle. Therefore, in the  present，our Prince follows the Way of the Land of the Gods, adopts the teachings of The  W estern Land, and teaches his disciples without discussing “civil learning” or “military  arts.” Rather, he informs us to worship at shrine and Confucian temple equally，to turn  back to the origins and recompense our ancestral blessings. Unifying the civil and the  military, our Prince thus completely realizes the useful talents of men. Accordingly, it is  stated in the Charter that “the civil and the military are not divergent.”</p>
<p>He asked, “I was roughly able to understand what is meant by “civil and m ilitary  affairs do not diverge.” As for the meaning of “loyalty and filiality are not two”： As  people have stated since the days of antiquity, both loyalty and filiality can be practiced  perfectly in ordinary times，but in times of flux, it is difficult to accomplish both loyalty  and filiality fully. So it is difficult to say that they are “not two，’’ is it not so?”</p>
<p>I stated, “Loyalty is the W ay of revering one’s lord. As may be seen in the  Classic of Filial Piety，revering one’s lord is what is known as，in other words, serving  one’s lord with the heart of revering one’s father.86 Filiality has two aspects: love and  reverence.87 To show love and reverence to one，s parents for having been reared in their</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>lap m ay be an obvious matter，but our bodies are also the reliquaries of our parents,88 our  flesh and blood received from our fathers and mothers. Thus we m ust also think of our  bodies and those of our parents as identical. In order to revere them, we establish  ourselves and follow the W ay ~ th is is what is meant by transforming the bodily reliquary  of our parents into sage and nobleman.89</p>
<p>‘Accordingly, the Son of Heaven rules over the realm, the great lords rule over  their respective domains，the high stewards and warriors serve their lo rd s~ a ll of them  fulfill the Heavenly vocation that appertains to them. In other words, this is the filiality  of establishing one，s self. W hen confronting an upheaval, however，even casting away  one’s life for the sake of one’s lord and neglecting the duty of a child to his father  mayif the actions are appropriate for the circumstancesbe construed as the filiality of  establishing one’s self. M aster Tseng said that “cowardice on the battlefield is contrary  tofiliality.’’90 Similarly, tossing aside one’s rank and salary, and resigning one’s post in  order to discharge filial duties toward one’s father and mother，may~~should it accord  with the intention to serve the objective of one&rsquo;s lord’s administration to rule the state  w ith filialityalso be said to be a form of loyalty.</p>
<p>‘Thus all actions of this sort, should one appropriately respond to conditions in  confronting radical changes, are not separate from the W ay of Loyalty and Filiality. In  other words, it may be said that loyalty and filiality together form a perfect whole. As I  have explained above, both loyalty and filiality have loving reverence as their foundation;  because that foundation is wholly singular, when the teachings of the Heavenly  Ancestress were bestowed through the Three Sacred Treasures, the duty of ruler and  ruled was rectified. of the three treasures, the Precious M irror served as the divine</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>repository of the Heavenly Ancestress, and thereby the Way of Filiality was made more  profound. These teachings hold that loyalty and filiality both are comprehended within  the three treasures. Therefore, when discussing these matters it is made quite clear that  both loyalty and filiality derive from that singular foundation. These are the manifest  teachings that have existed since heaven and earth opened forth. Consequently, it is my  humble belief that this is what may be m eant by “loyalty and filiality are not two.”</p>
<p>He asked，“the meaning of “scholarship and affairs do not differ in their utility” is  surely as it appears thus; however, in the present day，there are quite a few persons of no  learning who are able to engage in affairs. Persons of learning, on the other hand，are  foolish and careless，and thus unable to engage in affairs. W hat is the reason for this?”</p>
<p>I stated, “In antiquity, governance and edification w ere united; in governing the  country, “the people were led by virtue, and uniformity was sought to be given to them by  ritual.，，91 In addition, by means of administrative and judicial measures, good deeds were  rewarded and bad deeds were punished. As it is in pharm acology~w ith its divisions of  “lord, vassal, assistant, and envoy，，9 2 virtue and ritual are aided by administrative and  judicial measures, and it is in the unity of virtue and ritual, laws and punishments, that  governance and edification are accomplished. Benevolence is something one tenders  forth from him self to the realm, thereby putting at ease the people within the four seas.  As it is the Great W ay of the realm, what is known as “scholarship” means both to study  of the Way of “cultivating the self and ruling the people，” as well as to train in the  practical action of ritual and administrative and judicial measures. Therefore both  scholarship and practical action are united.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>them as the Huns of the north are from the Viets of the south. They mimic the words of  earlier Confücians，saying things like “if one’s whole heart is governed, then the state  will be governed.”96 M erely holding themselves in high regard, such men do not study  that which must be put into practical action，do not inquire into human feelings and social  conditions, and know nothing of the interests of the people. Accordingly，scholarship and  practical action have become utterly separated, and neither is of any use.</p>
<p>‘Now then，m y Prince has endeavored tofound a school to nourish talent. Surely  he will not cultivate any good-for-nothings. Those who would be scholars must therefore  inquire into the utility of that which is to be put into practical action. Just as the disciples  of Confucius studied matters of use to the realm according to their respective talents in  various fields such as virtuous actions, speech, administrative talents， and literary  learning,97 those who would be scholars m ust endeavor to recompense [the blessings of  the state98] and thus fully realize their wisdom and virtue. Let those who enjoy polite  accomplishments use their spare energies to study poetry and literature and relate their  opinions. The likes of those who examine human sentiments also should be left to that  which interests them. However, the foundation of all this is worshipping the Deities,  revering the sages, and understanding that the W ay of the Deities is the W ay of the Sages,  and that the Way of the Sages is the W ay of the Deities. It is not losing track of the true  direction of the Great Way, studying the Civil and M ilitary W ay, mastering its arts,  gathering the peoples5 sentiment and promulgating their collective strength, exhausting  loyalty and filiality, recompensing the blessings of the state, and never forgetting for even  a moment the advent of the spirits of the Deities. However, because attempting to train</p>
<p>37m en how to utilize their talent in practice is no easy matter, one whose scholarship is as  shallow as mine is surely not up to the task.</p>
<p>‘Also，education and administration are to be carried out without ranking one ii  im portance above the other. To speak of recompensing the ancestral origins of these twf  things, and of leading the lower ranks, surely should not be trusted to lowly retainers  Thus it was the ruler’s sincere intention that he administer governance and edificationhim self; accordingly, it states in the Charter’s conclusion, 6&quot;who is the person whsfounded this academy and controls governance and edification?” and there our Pnnce!nam e is written.</p>
<p>‘This，in other w ords，fulfills the Righteous Prince’s posthumous intention. Hetoo，admonished his retainers w ith the words “as one who endeavors to study the Wayothe Sages, I am also a scholar•” Because these are the admonishments of the rules him self，I must hesitate w hen attempting to discuss them in m y own words. To гетаівsilent and not answer, however, would approach neglecting m y official duties, so I havanswered your queries to some small extent. I fear there is a great deal of conjecture annonsense, and so I beseech you again to engage a scholar of eminence and ask him if mjanswers are correct.”</p>

<h2 id="postscript">Postscript</h2>
<p>In days past I composed the “Preprandial Chat” at the behest of the former Prince,  who had wished to have it printed and distributed within our borders.&rdquo; The Prince  passed away，however, and that plan was not realized. My nephew, Terakado, was  trained at the Academy for Broadening the W ay，and asked of me if he could print this  w ork in his house. As I recall it，I told him that this work was composed by the decree of  m y Prince for use as an instructional aid, and was not suitable for private publishing.  Still the young man pleaded with me，so I reconsidered; as he currently holds a teaching  post，I told him that should he print it for the benefit of his colleagues I would not be  entirely opposed to it. Thus I followed his request.</p>

<p>25 Strongholds of the Tendai (C. T，ien-t’ai) sect of Buddhism. Enryakuji is the head temple of the  Tendai sect, located on Mt. Hiei, on the outskirts of Kyoto. In September 1571，Oda Nobunaga  ordered the complex destroyed, and the entire monastery complex was burnt to the ground.  Onjöji (more commonly known as Miidera)，located in the city of Ötsu，Shiga Prefecture, began  as a branch temple of Enryakuji, but the two temples fell into conflict in the tenth century and  fought a series of bitter conflicts. The Onjöji temple buildings were destroyed several times over，</p>
<p>but were rebuilt with funds solicited from the court, the aristocracy, and the shogunate.  Köfükuji，one of the two head temples of the Hossö sect of Buddhism, is located in Nara city.  Kofukuji also relied on imperial patronage tofund its efforts, and maintained a substantial army  of warrior-monks tofight repeated battles against Enryakuji and other rivals during the Heian  period.</p>
<p>26 Ishiyama was the location of the head of the Ikkö sect，Honganji temple. The Ishiyama  Honganji came into conflict with Oda Nobunaga in 1570，and proved to be the initial test in his  quest for national unification, as Honganji5s major areas of strength coincided precisely with  Oda，s primary sphere of interest in central Japan. Between 1570 and 1580 Nobunaga led a series</p>
<p>of three attacks against the Ikkö warrior-monks on various fronts, including Nagashima in Ise  (now part of Mie Prefecture) before ultimately forcing submission and the surrender of the  Ishiyama Honganji.</p>

<p>27 During the Ikkö uprising of 1563 in Mikawa, home of Matsudaira (later Tokugawa) Ieyasu,  several hereditary vassals of the Matsudaira clan fought Ieyasu on the side of the Ikkö sect. Toro  and Harisaki were two strongholds of Ikkö Buddhism in Mikawa.</p>
<p>28 Christianity was first introduced to Japan by the Jesuit missionary Francis Xavier in 1549.  While Oda Nobunaga largely favored the missionaries, Toyotomi Hideyoshi was suspicious of  their increasing influence in Kyushu and ordered them expelled. The first Tokugawa shoguns  brought the persecution of Christians to a fever pitch, carrying out mass executions and almost  completely closing the country toforeign influence.</p>

Antoku was killed in the naval battle of Dannoura in 1185, when Taira no Kiyomori’s widow  took him in her arms and plunged into the sea. While the court in Kyoto changed the era name  from Juei to Genreki in 1184，the compilers of the Dai Nihon shi continued to refer to the period  as Juei and thus recognized Antoku，s reign as the legitimate one.</p>
