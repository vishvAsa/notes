+++

Today, students of Western political history consider the separation of church and state to have been an important step in the formation of modern European nations. The textbooks tell us that Machiavelli's views on government were modern, as opposed to medieval, in that he distinguished the ruler's personal morality as a private individual from his public responsibilities as a head of state: For the prince, reprehensible personal conduct was often praiseworthy statecraft. After Machiavelli, Western rulers for the most part would exclude ethics and religion from the affairs of government; and as a result, the nation-state in modern Europe became a purely secular institution. 

Most Japanese students of Western affairs in the second half of the Tokugawa period, however, did not think of contemporary European states in this way: They perceived Christianity to be an integral part of Western government. Their studies told them that "religion and government" as well as "administration and edification" were one in the West[^1] And most importantly, they believed that this non-separation of church and state was the secret of Western greatness and strength. Such an understanding of the contemporary West produced two noteworthy reactions among the Japanese: genuine admiration and genuine fear. A few thinkers, such as Maeno Ryōtaku and Shiba Kōkan, praised Western nations as benevolently-ruled utopias in which Christian teachings had a humanizing, salubrious effect on government. But by and large, Japanese thinkers-including the Rangakusha-stressed the dangers, not the virtues, presented by Christian-inspired Western governments. 

100Expulsion by Force 

In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, better knowledge of world affairs alerted many Japanese thinkers to A foreign crisis in the form of Christian non-military conquest. This in turn heightened their sensitivity to domestic unrest and to the need for relieving distress among the masses by implementing benevolent government and Mencius' "good teachings, which would produce popular unity, integration, and allegiance. Only then could bakufu leaders meet the foreign threat 

successfully. 



Western Learning also forced many Japanese leaders to feel a keen need for joi. Before the nineteenth century, as we have seen, jōi had been mainly cultural in nature: It meant sweeping away or eradicating what is barbarian through Confucian edification, so that the common people would not be attracted to evil foreign ways. This would keep the foreign menace from exacerbating domestic instability. Cultural joi was a logical Confucian response to the threat of foreign encroachment disclosed by Western Learning[^2] Students of both Western Learning and Mito Learning supported joi. But by the nineteenth century, joi took on predominantly military overtones: the indiscriminate expulsion of Westerners by force. In this chapter I briefly discuss the proposal for armed expulsion that Takahashi Kageyasu, a Rangakusha, made to the bakufu in 1824. Then I introduce Aizawa's thinking on the same subject as outlined in New Theses and in his 1828 anti-Christian tract, Kikōben (Some call me disputatious). 

RANGAKU AND EXPULSION BY FORCE: TAKAHASHI KAGEYASU 

Expulsion by force became bakufu policy in 1825, when it promulgated the so-called No Two Thoughts Expulsion Edict. This nullified earlier edicts issued in 1806 and 1807, which had stipulated that intruding vessels, particularly if disabled, be supplied with fuel and provisions and persuaded to leave peacefully. By contrast, the 1825 edict ordered that foreign ships be fired on and driven off summarily. Yet in a separate edict issued at the same time, the bakufu ordered: 

3 

101 

Aizawa and New Theses 

It has always been a violation of bakufu law for persons on Japanese rice transports and fishing vessels to become friendly with crews on foreign ships at sea. At this time it has been newly decreed that foreign ships approaching any inlet be fired on and driven off. Hence, boatmen and fishermen must observe the above prohibition all the more strictly. They should take pains to steer their boats away from and to avoid encountering foreign ships at sea as much as possible. Should [commoners] cover up contacts with foreigners and such facts be brought to light later on, persons involved will be subject to the ultimate punishment. . . .

Clearly, the bakufu sought not only to keep foreigners from approaching Japan, but also to keep commoners in Japan from approaching foreigners. It had to erect a barrier between Japanese commoners and alien barbarians so that the former would not be "transformed" by the latter. 

7 

The Rangakusha Takahashi Kageyasu 5 had originally proposed the 1825 Expulsion Edict one year earlier. Takahashi, who read Russian and English in addition to Dutch, argued in a memorial that recent British incursions were perpetrated by whalers whose crews entered Japanese territorial waters on purely private business." He claimed that these foreigners were not representatives of any government and harbored no evil designs on Japan. Because their crews were at sea for months at a time, they constantly suffered from malnutrition and occasionally had to obtain fruits and vegetables. Thus they meant no harm. But although they were told repeatedly not to return, they inevitably kept coming back to acquire foods essential to their health. To fire on them and drive them off without warning might seem to "lack benevolence," Takahashi admitted, but the foreigners had repeatedly taken advantage of the bakufu's good will; their brashness was becoming intolerable. Unless the bakufu adopted a tougher line, he declared, there would be no end to the foreigners' intrusions. Trying to get rid of these foreigners was like "brushing flies away from a bowl of rice." The "stupid barbarians," he wrote, would seek provisions not only from duly constituted bakufu officials, but also through illicit bartering 

102 

Expulsion by Force 

at sea with "mean and lowly" Japanese commoners, who by nature were atracted to novel and exotic Western goods. During such clandestine meetings, Japanese commoners and British seamen would become friendly, and the British would begin to spread Christianity. Takahashi cited at least three instances of Englishmen distributing Christian books 

Christian books to commoners on Japanese craft at sea, and asserted, "this proves they intend to increase such activities."" We should note in passing that Takahashi, like Chinese Confucians, used the mouth radical to write the characters for "England" and "English"-this to express contempt for their barbaric nature. 10 

From a purely military standpoint as well, Takahashi proposed that the bakufu should revise its procedures to deal with foreign vessels which were appearing off Japan's coasts. To mobilize a great number of troops and set up a grand encampment as was done at Uraga when the Brothers arrived in 1818, he claimed, was "like using a four-foot cleaver to chop off a chicken's head." Bakufu officials might think this an imposing show of strength, but actually such overreactions earned the foreigners' ridicule and contempt. Not only that, to display this much force every time a foreign ship appeared offshore placed onerous burdens on both daimyo and commoners. 

Takahashi's idea of expulsion by force was, in a sense, an attempt to use his knowledge of the rules governing Western diplomacy to uphold the Japanese policy of isolation (sakoku): 

According to the laws of European nations, cannon are mounted along the coast, and when ships of a nation with whom trade relations are maintained enter the harbor, signals are exchanged by flag. When ships from a nation with whom diplomatic relations are not maintained try to enter, blank rounds are fired from the nearest cannon on shore. It is customary for those ships to leave the harbor after thus being informed that entry is not permitted. 12 

Takahashi fully expected the foreigners to leave peaceably. Although the bakufu always had recourse to the use of live ammunition, he assumed that the need would not arise. He advocated 

103 

Aizawa and New Theses 

erecting batteries along northeastern Japan's Pacific coastline and in Edo Bay, and gave special instructions for doing so: 

Yoshio Chujirō [a Rangakusha] possesses a barbarian book describing the principles of gunnery in detail. I recently completed the translation of it that I had planned, and if it would be of service to the bakufu, I will quote some passages from it. 

Although cannon are most effective when fired from a low elevation, the stone ramparts they are mounted on should be built high, so that the cannon are visible far out at sea. Then the foreign ships may go away without our having to fire at all. 13 

If the foreigners approached shore despite these deterrents, they should be issued a stern warning written in Dutch, English, and Russian: "The law of our country is that all foreign ships appearing in our waters shall be fired on and driven off (uchiharau). Any ship that has approached in ignorance of this law should withdraw immediately. For good measure, Takahashi proposed that more detailed pronouncements be delivered through the Dutch to English officials at their trading station in Bengal. These pronouncements would inform British authorities about sakoku and order them to keep their ships from fishing within ten ri (approximately twenty-four miles) of the Japanese 

coast. 

15 

Takahashi used his translating skills, his knowledge of European protocol, and what he thought to be advanced Western military technology to formulate a more effective, up-to-date method of joi, his policy of expulsion by force. In Takahashi's case, Numata Jiro's thesis that the Rangakusha reinforced bakufu rule by supplying advanced Western technical knowledge seems borne out by the evidence. Takahashi's main intent was to use jōi to simplify and standardize the bakufu's case-by-case methods of turning away foreign ships, whose visits were becoming increasingly numerous and irksome. 

Takahashi's thinking was unmistakably Confucian. Regarding disabled foreign vessels, for example, he wrote that out of benevolence, "we must rescue even enemy ships." He continued: 

104 

Expulsion by Force 

If we [repair and] send it home after giving its crew the usual admonishment about our laws prohibiting visits by their ships to Japanese waters, they truly will admire our benevolence and will tell their countrymen to comply. 16 

Takahashi's attitude toward Japanese commoners was similar to Yukoku's: They "by nature" are easily alienated from their rulers and readily feel affection for foreigners. They are attracted to "novel and exotic" gadgets that foreigners barter, and are susceptible to the Christian teachings that foreigners spread. The situation had reached the point where foreigners "do not have to entice [our commoners] at all; they naturally feel affection for them." Takahashi noted: "This is an unavoidable part of human sentiment, but we may not permit them to feel this way toward the foreigners [whose presence in Japan] is prohibited."17 For Takahashi, bakufu law was bakufu law. Only by building barriers, by physically separating aliens and commoners, could bakufu leaders prevent their subjects' "transformation" to barbarian ways. This would end the trouble from abroad and keep Japan's socio-political order intact. Like Arai Hakuseki, Takahashi believed that foreigners came to Japan with no intention of subverting it. And like Hakuseki, he reasoned that their activities inevitably led to subversion nonetheless. Therefore foreigners and their religion had to be shut out. 

But the situation in Takahashi's day differed from that of Hakuseki's in one key respect: Foreigners, in Takahashi's own words, kept coming back to Japan like flies to a bowl of rice. Despite his vast knowledge of the West, Takahashi could not comprehend this changed world situation: Unilateral bakufu fiat simply would not keep Westerners away any longer. As Aizawa charged, people like Takahashi "relied on the barbarians' staying away. 

upon something not within our power to 

control."18 

Takahashi's views may seem naively foolish, but we must not forget that his was one of the finest minds of the age and that he knew more about the West than any other Japanese then. The basic flaw in his proposal for firing on and driving off Westerners was that he assumed all foreigners would obey bakufu 

105 

Aizawa and New Theses 

21 Takahashi could 

commands as docilely as did the Chinese and Dutch[^19] Like Takano Chōei fourteen years later, Takahashi believed that the bakufu needed only to explain the inviolability of sakoku as Japanese law and the British would obey it. 20 He viewed English whalers simply as private individuals. He did not think about the state authority to which they would appeal in protest against the arbitrary treatment that Edo meted out. not conceive of an English government redressing its subjects' grievances by demanding not only that the bakufu permit foreign ships to call at Japanese ports, but also that Japan accept the entire system of laws governing relations between Western states. Unlike Holland, Ch'ing China, Korea, and the Ryūkyūs, England and other Western nations would not maintain relations with Japan on the unequal terms that Edo dictated. Quite the contrary, three decades later they forced their own unequal terms on the bakufu. 

Fujita Yukoku was justified in faulting many Rangakusha for their inability to perceive the nature of state authority and national integration in Western countries: "Though bakufu interpreters [like Takahashi] may understand the barbarians' speech and be able to read their writings, they cannot understand the true 'barbarians' nature' (ryojo)."22 Takahashi, for all of his Western expertise, was blind to the spiritual cohesion that turned peoples into nations. That is why he did not take the Western threat from Christianity as seriously as did Yukoku and Aizawa. Nor did Takahashi understand that the world situation had fundamentally changed by the nineteenth century. To him, the rightness of sako ku as well as Edo's ability to uphold it seemed self-evident. The barter-goods that English seamen brought ,923 not a were trifling items they "happened to have on hand, potentially valuable source of national revenue. Christianity posed a possible danger to the existing order, but the bakufu could easily avert that danger by strictly enforcing sakoku. Japan's problems would disappear if the bakufu built barriers between "stupid barbarians" and "mean and lowly" Japanese commoners. It could accomplish this by ordering the expulsion of Western ships and constructing coastal batteries visible far 

out at sea. 

106 

 

Takahashi proposed joi out of exasperation over frequent foreign annoyances, not from a compelling sense of crisis. This basic complacency is underscored by his lack of specific reform plans to alleviate distress at home. Ironically, Aizawa, with far less Western Learning than Takahashi and scant ability to communicate with foreigners, nevertheless discerned the "barbarians' nature" (ryojo) more acutely. It was Aizawa who perceived the popular unity and support that lay behind Western strength. Equally important, Aizawa contrasted these sources of foreign strength with domestic factors creating Japanese weakness. He saw clearly that trouble from abroad endangered Japan precisely because distress at home made Japan vulnerable to it. To eliminate this internal vulnerability, Aizawa concluded, the bakufu must emulate Western leaders, who used Christianity as a state religion (hōkyō) to secure popular unity and allegiance. Let us examine Aizawa's ideas on these subjects as expounded in New Theses and "Some Call Me Disputatious" (Kikōben). 

THE WORLD SITUATION IN 1825 AS SEEN IN "NEW THESES" 

New Theses contains five treatises: "What is Essential to a Nation" ("Kokutai"), "World Affairs" ("Keisei"), "The Barbarians' Nature" ("Ryojo"), "National Defense" ("Shugyo"), and "A Long-Range Policy" ("Chōkei"). To facilitate analysis we can divide these treatises in two groups: (1) "World Affairs" and "The Barbarians' Nature" contain the fruits of Aizawa's Western Learning, in these he describes the unprecedented crisis facing Japan in 1825. "National Defense" outlines Aizawa's concrete measures to meet that crisis. (2) "Kokutai" and "A Long-Range Policy" explain what a people need to be a nation, stipulating which factors had created spiritual unity in Japan's antiquity, why that unity later disappeared, and how the bakufu could 

and must recover it. 

Historians, based on the certainty that comes from hindsight, usually deprecate "World Affairs" and "The Barbarians' Nature" as inaccurate, outdated sources of knowledge about the West. 24 Viewed from the 1850s and 1860s, it is undeniable that Aizawa's information on world affairs was long out of date: No informed 

107 

Aizawa and New Theses 

Japanese in that era believed the Mogul empire to be a world power. Likewise, many specific proposals that Aizawa made in "National Defense" to strengthen Japan, such as returning warriors to the land or reestablishing a rice economy, were reactionary and would have weakened her against the foreign powers. But we must remember that Aizawa drew up New Theses in 1825, a decade and a half before the Opium War. Though some of his specific defense proposals and information on world affairs were outdated, his fundamental messages possessed lasting value. They were (1) the world situation facing Japan is dissimilar in crucial ways to anything in her history, (2) the Western barbarians are unlike those dealt with up to now, and (3) the bakufu must devise new policies to overcome the unprecedented danger it faces. It was these fundamental messages, not Aizawa's misinformation, that late Tokugawa leaders and shishi took to heart. In 1849, for example, Kawaji Toshiakira, though generally critical of New Theses, wrote, "The author. . . knows not only of Japan, but of foreign countries as well. . . . Of his seven sections, 'Ryojo' (The Barbarians' Nature) is by far the best."25 

In "World Affairs," Aizawa wrote that because of recent Russian and British encroachments, "those seeking to defend our territory cannot afford to be ignorant of changed world conditions or unconcerned with policies to deal with them."26 He did not think that Westerners posed a danger of mass invasion; Japan faced primarily a non-military threat. A knowledge of Western affairs and world geography had given him a healthy respect for Russian or Turkish armed forces, but only when they fought against other Eurasian continental powers. In the final analysis, he still believed that the sea effectively guarded Japan against any direct, full-scale, military takeover. Russia, Turkey, Britain, and Spain could not assemble assault fleets large enough to conquer Japan by storm[^27] there was little danger of all-out invasion and occupation similar to that posed by Mongol forces in the thirteenth century. To be sure, Western military power was a factor to be reckoned with, but not the most menacing factor. During the 1810s and 1820s, when unarmed whalers were the main intruders into Japanese waters, 

108 

 

this appraisal-shared by Takahashi Kageyasu-was not rash or 

unrealistic. 

Takahashi had dealt with the Christian threat almost in an offhand manner; Aizawa not only took it seriously, he analyzed its nature and causes with sophistication and thoroughness. Aizawa mainly feared an indirect Western takeover of Japan through Christian "transformation." The Westerners would employ Christianity, cultural assimilation, and economic inveiglement to fill their ranks; first they would capture the Ezo tribes in the north and other primitive peoples on Pacific islands to Japan's south, and then seduce the "stupid commoners" in Japan proper. In New Theses he carried this reasoning one step further: After capturing Japan through Christianity, Russia would recruit Japanese forces to help conquer the Ch'ing empire. 28 

Aizawa displayed no small respect for the Western barbarians when he attributed to them an ability to employ the strategy used by Chao Ch'ung-kuo and Chu-ko Liang. Like these legendary Chinese geniuses of military tactics, Western generals procured provisions in the enemy's homeland and enlarged their own armies by first taking over small states and conscripting captured enemy troops[^29] The Westerners also practiced Sun Tzu's dictums: They "defeated enemy armies without resorting to battle, and they conquered territories intact, which is the best of all possible victories."30 Thus, Aizawa was fundamentally at odds with Takahashi (who belittled foreigners as merely "stupid barbarians") in assessing the Westerners' capacity to wreak havoc. Aizawa, too, denigrated Westerners, calling them "stupid barbarians," "dogs and goats," and other like names. But such blustering and vilification should not obscure the fact that he took their threat in dead earnest. To counter the enemy's astute strategy directed against Japan (and, ultimately, the Ch'ing empire), Aizawa asserted the need for a consistent, sustained program of religious and cultural "countertransformation" supplemented by armed might. Such a longrange policy, he claimed, originally had been devised and carried out in antiquity by Amaterasu, Jimmu, Sujin, and other sage 

109 

Aizawa and New Theses 

emperors (shinsei). Aizawa's knowledge of the West led him to believe that European leaders recently had appropriated this long-range policy for themselves and had turned it against Japan; whereas in Japan, it had fallen into disuse. Herein lay the West's non-military threat and Japan's vulnerability to it. 

World affairs, like other political matters, are subject to continual change, Aizawa claimed. They must be understood by carefully observing and analyzing both historical and contemporary conditions. Japan's leaders had to revise old, rigid conceptions of the world order and of the barbarians. They had to make these views conform to new situations; only thus could the bakufu formulate appropriate new policies. In "World Affairs," "The Barbarians' Nature," and "National Defense," Aizawa displayed his understanding of a changed world. Not only were the Westerners of contemporary times materially stronger and technologically more advanced than barbarians in ages past, they had made great strides in the realm of spirit: 

As civilization (jimbun) steadily progresses, even barbarians partake of its blessings and learn [the technique of] creating religious injunctions and precepts to guide their peoples. Their towering fortresses surrounded by deep moats are a far cry from their crude huts and tents of yesteryear; their huge warships and cannon are a vast advance over their mounted bowmen of bygone days. 31 

For Westerners as well as for Japanese, "civilization" had progressed in a linear and cumulative fashion. 32 The biggest difference between earlier barbarians and those of today, Aizawa argued, was the unity and strength that contemporary Westerners derived from Christianity and Islam+++(5)+++: 

> In eras past, their only means of winning and maintaining obedience among their vast hordes was to lure with promises of booty and to intimidate with displays of force. As a result, those hordes lacked integration and permanence. But now the religions (kyōho) of Islam and Christianity have provided Western leaders with these two elements and more. Today, each barbarian tribe, while maintaining its own territory, allies itself with all others to convert the entire world to their religion. This is indeed a far cry from the past.

110 



33 

We have seen that new knowledge of the West forced Aizawa to question, at least to himself, the notion of Japan as Middle Kingdom Civilization and to look at her geographical position in global perspective. Politically and militarily, he now had to size up Japan against six foreign powers. In stark contrast to Takahashi Kageyasu's complacence, Aizawa's appraisal of Japan's place in the world was a grim one. The bakufu's policy of unilateral national isolation was becoming difficult to uphold. Japan's fate was less of Japan's own making than contingent on developments in far-off lands and on decisions made by foreign rulers over which the bakufu had little or no control. 

Aizawa compared the seven great empires that dominated the contemporary world to the seven great kingdoms of China's ancient Warring States period (403-221 B.C.). 34 In so doing, he disclosed his true assessment of Japan's international standing. Japan was in a position even more hazardous than that of the weak state of Yen; more precisely, it was analogous to Chou, 35 a tiny kingdom whose precarious existence hinged on the tolerance of other, greater powers though its cultural tradition was the richest and most venerable. He compared Russia to Ch'in, ancient China's eventual unifier. For Aizawa, Russia, Turkey (the Ottoman Empire), and the Ch'ing empire were the world's greatest powers in 1825; they would be the decisive participants in the upcoming struggle for global supremacy. Aizawa's knowledge of things Western forced him to recognize that even lesser powers such as Britain and Spain enjoyed a clear edge over Japan in precious metals and raw materials due to their possession of overseas colonies. 36 

Russia, though suffering serious military setbacks on its western front, remained the world's most powerful empire, and was building up strength for a final drive to unify the world by subduing its long-standing nemesis, Turkey[^37] But before that, Aizawa believed, Russia would try to dispose of the Ch'ing empire on its eastern front. To accomplish this, it first would use Christianity to win over the Ezo territories north of Japan in 

111 

Aizawa and New Theses 

concert with its British and Spanish allies, who were striving to capture Pacific islands to Japan's south. Russia and Britain then would subvert Japan proper by Christianizing its "stupid commoners," and would beguile a new generation of "Japanese raiders" (wako) into attacking and weakening China. With the Ch'ing thus crippled, Russia could deliver the coup de grace from the north. 38 Aizawa's analysis reduces Japan to little more than a pawn in Russia's chess game of world conquest; Japan was a third-rate power, more affected by, than actively shaping, world events. Indeed, Japan's national security seems to hinge on the Ch'ing and Turkish empires' ability to contain Russian expansion on the Eurasian continent. 39 Aizawa notes with more than a little alarm: "The great empires are dividing up the earth. Today we find ourselves alone in a hostile world, like the defenders of a solitary fortress under siege by enemy forces."40 

"NEW THESES" ON DOMESTIC REFORM 

Aizawa's knowledge of the West informed him about conditions in European nations that contributed to their strength. After comparing conditions abroad with those at home, he formulated administrative reforms--some of which were quite radical-to reinforce bakufu rule and Japan's socio-political order against foreign encroachment. His vituperation against the West, far from showing contempt, expressed admiration and envy: 

Barbarian leaders possess the nature of dogs and goats.. But their customs are savage and they constantly wage war; they could not establish and maintain their states through a policy of keeping their subjects ignorant and weak [as we do]. Hence they register and conscript their subjects into armed service and further augment their ranks with other barbarian peoples [whom they convert] on overseas campaigns. 41 Related to the Western leaders' capacity to cultivate unity and allegiance in their peoples through Christianity, Aizawa here perceives that their national strength stemmed from an ability to conscript large segments of their populations into military 

112 

Domestic Reform 

service. In short, Western leaders indoctrinated their peoples with a state religion and thus inspired them to enlist and fight valiantly in mass national armies. This situation contrasted starkly with the perception that Fujita Yukoku had of Japanese commoners: not merely refusing to support bakufu and domain leaders, but eagerly joining the enemy's ranks. Aizawa realized that Japan's present "feudal" (hōken) state system, laid down by ancient sage emperors and reinstituted by Tokugawa Ieyasu, made it impossible "to conscript commoners again [as was done in antiquity]."[^42] He fully shared Yukoku's fears about Japanese commoners, writing, "commoners today are totally lacking in pluck and can hardly be expected to achieve great exploits in a battlefield situation."43 But when "transformed" by Christianity, Our people would consider it an honor and a privilege to die for this foreign god; and this willingness to die, this fearlessness, would make them fit for battle. Our people would gladly cast their riches into the sacrificial coffers of this foreign god, and those riches would finance barbarian campaigns[^44] 

Western leaders did not keep their subjects ignorant and weak. But the Edo bakufu, following policies laid down by Ieyasu in another era, was doing just that. In Ieyasu's day, the realm suffered from too much military might: That made it difficult to uphold order. Therefore, after carefully weighing conditions in the realm, Ieyasu adopted a policy "to weaken the empire and make commoners ignorant; and he succeeded on both counts. Aizawa concluded that what had once been an astute policy, now helped make Japan vulnerable to foreign encroachment. But we should note that Western Learning helped him reach that conclusion by informing him about the West's strengths; this invited contrasts with factors in Japanese politics and society that created weakness. 

The same can be said for his analysis of problems stemming from the bakufu-imposed system of daimyo alternate attendance in Edo (sankin kotai) and the concentration of samurai in castletowns. These measures, too, Ieyasu had adopted in a different era-when powerful daimyo on the periphery presented the greatest threat to bakufu security[^46] At that time it was wise to 

113 

Aizawa and New Theses 

concentrate daimyo in Edo and in castletowns, make them expend their wealth in corvée labor and extravagant consumption, and thereby prevent them from cultivating strength in outlying areas far from bakufu control[^47] But in 1825, that threat to bakufu authority no longer existed; old policies calculated to produce daimyo weakness and deprivation only exacerbated Thus, Aizawa wrote, "Can we contemporary problems[^48] blithely ignore the need to adjust state policies to meet the demands of changing times?"49 His knowledge of conditions in Western nations and of changed global realities awakened him to the anachronisms in bakufu policies, and made him realize that responsible leaders in Edo could not remain complacent about the situation. This was why he proposed that the bakufu itself seize the initiative to revise outdated policies and push through drastic reforms: 

Even if the bakufu insists on maintaining the realm by means of obsolete traditional measures, our coastal areas, for instance, are weakly defended. Should a particular daimyo's domain be attacked and suffer defeat [by foreigners], the bakufu would be forced to send him back to his domain to strengthen his forces anyway. It is far wiser to take the initiative and send him back to begin with, rather than wait until conditions deteriorate to the humiliating point where there is no other choice. 50 

In addition to reforming the sankin kōtai system and relaxing other traditional policies that weakened and impoverished the daimyo domains, Aizawa advocated stationing warriors in coastal garrisons. He also urged creating coast guard forces to engage enemy vessels at sea rather than rely solely on cannon to repulse them as Hayashi Shihei and Takahashi Kageyasu had proposed earlier. 51 

But more important, he suggested creating a form of peasant militia to supplement the warrior-class garrison forces. 52 This is one crucial issue on which Aizawa's Western Learning clashed with his prior political allegiances. Since he knew that the strength of Western nations stemmed in large part from their leaders' ability to indoctrinate and recruit commoners into 

114 

Domestic Reform 

armed service, Aizawa could not help concluding that the Tokugawa system of hereditary social statuses hindered self-strengthening in Japan. He no doubt envied Western leaders and wished that the bakufu could institute similar systems to indoctrinate and enlist Japanese commoners. But such a reform would entail repudiating the hereditary distinction between warrior and commoner (heino bunri), a structural principle that the Tokugawa bakuhan order based itself on. This, of course, Aizawa would 

never do. 

A close examination of his proposed militia reveals that he would allow peasants to become sentinels in the garrisons, not regular troops. 53 He had little hope that commoners would render distinguished service, writing, "Our only enlistees would be feeble old men or indolent delinquents, and neither would do us much good."54 Commoners would simply warn of the enemy's approach, and refrain from collaborating. This clearly was a halfway measure: to have peasants serve in Japan's armed forces, but not as full-fledged soldiers. It stemmed from Aizawa's half-hearted attitude toward Japanese commoners. He wished to entrust them with a share of the nation's defense, but did not trust them enough to make it a crucial share. 55 At the bottom of this dilemma lay the fundamental contradiction between what a knowledge of the West told Aizawa must be done to strengthen Japan, and what his commitment to the existing Tokugawa socio-political order stopped him from doing. In 1825, when the West posed no great military threat, such halfway measures and half-hearted attitudes sufficed; after Perry's intrusion in 1853, they would not. 

Aizawa thus owed much to Western Learning for his understanding of contemporary international affairs and conditions in foreign countries, as outlined in "World Affairs" and "The Barbarians' Nature." This changed view of world conditions led him to examine traditional bakufu policies and existing institutions in a critical light, and to devise bold new plans for creating military strength. Aizawa's proposals would prove insufficient to meet Japan's needs after 1853, but given the social and political conditions of 1825, his ideas seemed extreme, not too mild. Aizawa called on the bakufu to abandon Ieyasu's policies of 

115 

Aizawa and New Theses 

weakening and impoverishing the daimyo-measures instituted solely to uphold Tokugawa supremacy-because they made Japan as a whole vulnerable to foreign encroachment. 

Western Learning had five significant ramifications in Aizawa's thought. First, he began to recognize in a blurry and imperfect way the emerging nation-state (or empire) system in a global context. Second, he acknowledged the cultural advances achieved by barbarian rulers, advances that enabled them to mobilize their peoples spiritually in pursuit of national goals. Third, he learned that no nation could hope to be a great power without winning the voluntary support and allegiance of its people. Fourth, he tacitly admitted that Japan had failed in this task: Japan was a small, weak nation needing drastic reform. Finally, he realized-but could not openly admit-that pushing these reforms through to their logical conclusions might entail dismantling the existing Tokugawa bakuhan order. 

THE SAGES AND THEIR "EXPEDIENT DEVICE" 

The Western barbarians had achieved national strength; Japan had not. Aizawa comprehended this failure in historical perspective and in terms of human emotional needs. As he put it, Western leaders had "stolen the sages' ch'üan" while Japanese leaders had let it slip away. But what was this "expedient device," the ch'üan, that the ancient sages had possessed? Just how had Western leaders stolen it? Did this theft make them equivalent to the sages, at least in some crucial respects? To answer these questions and fully understand the implications of Aizawa's new proposals, we must look closely into the meaning of this key Chinese term, ch'üan. Aizawa's anti-Christian tract, Kikōben (1828) provides important clues. 

The tract's title, "Some Call Me Disputatious," is taken from the "T'eng Wen Kung" chapter of Mencius. In that chapter, Mencius places himself in a tradition of sagely personages, Yao, Shun, Yü, and Confucius, who did battle with floods, wild beasts, barbarians, and heretical teachings that repeatedly arose to victimize men in Middle Kingdom Civilization during history. In Mencius' own time (372-289 B.C.?), the new heresies of Yang

Sages and their Expedient Device 

Chu and Mo Tzu called for extirpation. Hence, he railed, "Some call me disputatious, but do I have any choice?" Aizawa adopted this line from Mencius's harangue to project the image of himself as a staunch moral teacher seeking to subdue this latest and most dangerous heresy, Christianity. The essay, composed in classical Chinese, is a dialogue between a Chinese master of the Confucian classics and one of his disciples. In response to the disciple's query, "Why is the 'True Way' upheld so feebly while evil heresies flourish in the world?", the Chinese master (Aizawa) replies: "The barbarians have only one technique, but are able to expound their ideas and beguile stupid commoners because they have stolen the sages' ch'üan and use it to take advantage of what is easy to do.. "How should we interpret the meaning of "the sages' ch'üan"? And how do Western leaders use it to “take advantage of what is easy to do”? 

Although it would be a mistake to suppose that Aizawa adhered to Ogyu Sorai's views in all matters, recent scholarship attests that Sorai influenced him considerably. 56 The "Way of the former sage kings" according to Sorai consisted of ritual, music, laws, and institutions. 57 The ritual and music were of cardinal importance, since for Sorai, the sovereign should be a "ruler-edifier" who induced acceptance of his teachings by utilizing ch'üan rather than by relying on words: 

The former sage kings realized that words alone were insufficient to edify people, and therefore created ritual and music. They realized that political institutions and laws alone were insufficient to bring peace and stability to the people, and therefore created ritual and music to exercise kwa, "an inducing influence" over them. 

over them. . . . When one follows ritual, one comes under this "inducing influence" and unconsciously obeys the laws of the sovereign. How can any evil result? Could political institutions and laws ever be as good [i.e., efficacious] as this[^58] 

According to Sorai, kwa, or what I have thus far translated as "moral suasion" or 

"transformation," should not take 

place through wordy explanations or ethical injunctions; instead, the ruler should achieve it through the "reality of ritual 

117 

Aizawa and New Theses 

performance." Hence, I translate Sorai's kwa as "an inducing influence." Through it, the performer of ritual induced those viewing it to enter a psychological state of oneness with him and to carry out the deeds that he willed. Each sage king in antiquity, Sorai held, brought the people under his inducing that they influence through ritual, and thereby made sure "unconsciously obeyed" his laws. Aizawa termed this potency "the mystical, efficacious function of ritual and music."59 For Sorai and Aizawa, the purposeful utilization of ritual to produce an inducing influence was one important element of 

ch'üan. Sorai had written: 

The harm stemming from Tzu-ssu and Mencius is that they desired to explain their views thoroughly and make understanding easy for the listeners. This is the way of the litigant, one who seeks to get his views accepted quickly. In this case, ch'üan lies with the listeners. Such is not the Way to edify people. Ch'üan lies with the edifier since he follows the Way of the Ruler-Edifier. The skilled edifier always ensnares his learners with technique (jutsu), makes them feel long at ease, alters their perceptions, and induces them to change their ideas. Hence, the edifier does not rely on words, yet manages to make his learners understand as a matter of course.... 

This is what the former sage kings and Confucius did. The former sage kings did not explain ritual and music in words, but rather demonstrated these in reality. When we reach Mencius, we find that he debates in an annoying, domineering fashion, trying to argue his listeners into submission. He who seeks to make his listeners submit through wordy explanations has already failed to make them submit voluntarily. A teaching is something dispensed to those who believe in the edifier. People [in antiquity] believed in the former sage kings, and the disciples of Confucius believed in him. . . . Through wordy arguments, Mencius sought to make people-who did not originally believe in him-believe in him. 60 

Sorai here asserts that in the era before Tzu-ssu (492-431 B.C.) and Mencius, the sage kings and Confucius had rejected polemics 

118 

Sages and their Expedient Device 

as a means of getting their ideas accepted. For a teacher or ruler-edifier to rely on polemics meant that ch'üan-the ability to weigh pros and cons, to deliberate on the propriety or impropriety of a matter, and to decide which course of action was expedient to pursue-lay with the listeners. Since these listeners were skeptical of the ruler-edifier to begin with, they presumed to judge whether or not his teachings were valid and warranted compliance. By contrast, Confucius and the ancient sages recognized the need to win the people's unquestioning trust before edification could take place. They would "ensnare" the people with the "technique" of ritual and music, and thus place the people under their inducing influence. This caused the people to obey without realizing that their obedience was being manipulated. In this sense, ch'üan lay with the sages: It was they who weighed conditions in a given situation and decided what was proper for the learners to do. Since they already had made the people believe in them, they produced compliance without opposition. This ch'üan, Sorai argued, rightly belonged only to the sages: "For [mere] men to seek to seize the ch'üan of the former sage kings is stark impudence, a grand delusion, or else a gross overestimation of their own [human] capacities."61 

Aizawa's ideas on the sages' ch'üan, as expressed in Kikōben, were basically the same as Sorai's: 

In general, human sentiment is such that man cannot but feel reverent awe for the power of Heaven. The sages' idea of Reverence for Heaven meant serving Heaven as one would serve one's parents, placing forebears in the position of Heaven, and then serving them as one would serve it. Ritual and music exist for this purpose, and these devices for "making the people follow the Way" are found in it [the sages' "Reverence for Heaven"]. Therefore when the people respectfully serve their sovereign with the same reverent awe that they feel toward the power of Heaven, sovereign and Heaven become one, and the ruler mercifully nurtures the people. This is the sages' Great Ch'üan for ordering the realm and ruling the people. 

But the barbarians have set up a false god and beguile their peoples with it. Therefore, they are able to make their peoples 

119 

Aizawa and New Theses 

revere rulers [i.e., themselves] with the same reverent awe that those peoples feel for Heaven. Though their teachings are not the true teachings found in nature, these are sufficiently cogent to let them steal the sages' ch'üan.... They make [their peoples] look upon them as one with Heaven. 62 

The above discussion of ch'üan by both Sorai and Aizawa should allow us to grasp what they meant by it. Ch'üan consisted of three elements: (1) "weighing" (hakaru), or giving careful consideration to the relative merits of all possible courses of action before determining which is proper to follow, 63 (2) the "provisional" or "expedient" (kari no, gon) implementation 64 or adoption of a measure deemed proper to attain calculated ends, and (3) in Japanese Confucianism, the idea that ch'üan should be a "prerogative" (kengen) that the ancient sages alone might exercise. 65 

Aizawa argued that the sages had utilized ritual and music as a "device" that accorded with the requirements of human sentiments. In their wisdom, they knew that all human beings had, among other needs, an irrepressible longing to revere Heavenanother point Sorai stressed. A survey of Aizawa's works shows that he considered the following attributes to be part of the common people's nature: 

To fear Heaven and revere the spirits is inherent in man's 

nature. 

66 

The natural sentiments of the people are that they cannot help coveting personal gain and standing in awe of the spirits. 67 

At this time of the year [spring, the planting season], it is a natural human sentiment for the people to pray for an abundant harvest. For this reason, invocations to the Buddhas and to the Christian Heaven take place. 68 

The masses by nature cannot avoid an unconscious and irrepressible abhorrence of the world to come. Unless they put their minds at ease and attain a measure of self-composure, they will inevitably believe in doctrines of [paradise and hell in] the world to come. 

120Sages and their Expedient Device 

In short, the people had certain emotional needs: to overcome their anxiety toward death and the afterworld; to cope with their fear of Heaven, spirits, and other supernatural forces; and to seek assurances of personal gain and prosperity in the present life. As he phrased it in New Theses, the people were in need of a spiritual source of reliance within. The ruler-edifier was supposed to fulfill such emotional needs by using the sages' ritual and music: "The responsibility for performing these rituals; that is, for recompensing Heaven, worshipping ancestors, praying for good fortune, and eliminating calamities and evils rests with rulers."70 Through this "device" of ritual and music, a ruler followed Confucius' maxim to "make the people follow the Way," and induced them to "serve their sovereign with the same reverent awe that they feel toward the power of Heaven."71 In other words, the ruler performed ritual in a calculated manner to meet his people's emotional needs: "[Man] is conscious of his own life and death, particularly when faced with the prospect of dying. That is why the sages elucidated the proper religious rituals." 72 

It had been the sages' prerogative to establish ritual and music as a device to facilitate government. Rulers in later ages or alien lands might-indeed, ought to-utilize that device. But they should not presume to invent and use new, heretical forms of the device as the Europeans had done in Christianity. In Aizawa's mind, Christianity's false doctrines of Heaven and hell were no different from the concepts of heavenly paradise and hell in Buddhism. Although Aizawa did not share the admiration for Indian pseudo-sages that the author of Honsaroku felt, 73 both thinkers held the same conception of ch'üan, as here stated in that work: 

Shaka, knowing that India was difficult to govern because its people were not of a docile nature ... carefully considered how best to deal with Indian customs. He made up the fictions of heavenly paradise (gokuraku) and hell (jigoku) as an expedient method of government. He taught the people that if they did good in this world, they would be born in heavenly paradise, but if they did evil, they would fall into hell. In 

121 

Aizawa and New Theses 

truth, heavenly paradise and hell do not exist; these were [invented] for the purpose of governing the realm. The mind of the Buddha was indeed great: This idea corresponds to the principle of government. It is ch'üan tao: the "Way of Expe- 

dient Method." 74 

In Aizawa's eyes, Western barbarian leaders had done the same thing. But they were more clever because they instituted and used their religious ch'üan as an integral part of government. In Kikōben, as we recall, Aizawa stated, "They have stolen the sages' ch'üan and [use it to] take advantage of what is easy to do."75 In New Theses he expressed the same sentiments: 

[Japanese commoners] are attracted to pernicious doctrines from abroad because they need a basis of spiritual reliance within. It is no surprise that the followers of evil [the Christian barbarians] take advantage of this spiritual void and this fear of the hereafter to deceive our commoners into embracing their notions of paradise and hell. 76 (emphasis added) 

9977 

Like the Indian Buddha, Western pseudo-sages had set up a "false god"; they had created a type of ritual and music that resembled those of the true sages closely enough to deceive "stupid commoners. The efficacy of this Christian ritual and music in fact equaled that of the true sages: Barbarian leaders "made their peoples revere rulers with the same reverent awe that those peoples [naturally] feel for Heaven."78 This stolen ch'üan allowed them to gain popular unity and support at home; this was the true source of their strength. And moreover, Christian ritual and music permitted Western leaders to win over local populations on overseas campaigns: 

In recent years, the wily barbarians have established ethical precepts of their own that sound very much like the genuine ones prescribed [by the sages] in antiquity. Armed with their Way of wickedness, they eat into the people's hearts and minds. The barbarians' teachings are not [Mencius'] "good teachings," but they pass these off as "teachings" just the same, and this allows them "to capture the people's hearts." "9 

122 

Kokutai 

Through this notion of the sages' ch'üan and its supposed theft and utilization by barbarian leaders, Aizawa grasped what was essential to a nation's sovereignty and territorial integrity--political concepts beginning to take shape in the minds of nineteenthcentury Japanese thinkers. 

"KOKUTAI" AND "A LONG-RANGE POLICY" 

Aizawa's New Theses explained how the bakufu might create national strength and wealth in 1825 to meet the Western threat posed mainly by Christianity. This threat, though unique in its magnitude, was not unprecedented in Japanese history. Earlier, Buddhism had entered Japan. 

The practitioners of this doctrine sought to transform our Divine Land into another India, to convert innocent subjects of our Middle Kingdom into followers of the Indian barbarians. When transformed by barbarism within, how can "what is essential to a nation" (kokutai) remain intact? Due to their adoration of India, those members [of the True Pure Land Sect] forsook our Middle Kingdom; due to their devotion to Buddhist clerics, they forsook ruler and 

80 parent. 

Partly because of this earlier Buddhist "transformation" of Japanese customs, beliefs, and values, Japan's kokutai, or "what was essential for it to be a nation,"81 had been gravely endangered. Heresy and dissension within created national weakness which foreign enemies could exploit. In 1825, Aizawa feared that subversion by alien heresies, not invasion by Western military forces, chiefly threatened the independence and integrity of Japan's bakuhan state. Aizawa's knowledge of the West had shown him that a nation must possess something of more basic importance than wealth and armed strength: 

Just what is essential (tai/t'i) for a land and people to be a nation (kuni)? Without four limbs, a man is not a man. Similarly, a nation also possesses some essence [or requisite and defining entity that makes it a nation] (kokutai). 

123 

Aizawa and New Theses 

Certain people stress the need to enrich our country and strengthen our arms in order to defend our borders. But the foreign beasts now seek to take advantage of the fact that people in outlying areas crave a source of spiritual reliance, and furtively seduce our commoners into betraying us. Should the barbarians win over our people's hearts and minds, they will have captured the realm without a skirmish. Then the wealth and strength that these people stress will no longer be ours to employ. In effect, we would provide arms for the brigand and provisions for the bandit. What a pity if, after all our meticulous planning and painstaking effort, we merely ended up joining the enemy's ranks! 81 (emphasis added) 

Wealth and strength were worthless unless Japan's people willingly placed these resources at the bakufu's disposal. Conversely, if foreigners won the people's allegiance, Japan's autonomy and territorial integrity would cease. Securing "our people's hearts and minds" was essential to the bakufu as a national government. Sage emperors had accomplished this in antiquity: "All people in the realm were of one heart and mind; they were so endeared of their rulers that separation was unbearable."82 This national spiritual unity-the voluntary affection and trust that commoners felt for their rulers-was what Aizawa basically meant by kokutai in New Theses. As Bito Masahide argues in his seminal articles on Mito Learning, rulers produced this affection, trust, allegiance, and unity from above through manipulation. 83 The threat from Christianity and the West would be overcome only when bakufu rulers achieved this original kokutai. Only then would wealth and strength take on meaning for the nation. Western rulers recently had "stolen the sages' ch'üan" and learned the technique of creating religious doctrines to instill unity and loyalty in their peoples. In stark contrast, Japanese rulers had neglected and lost this ch'üan. Aizawa, the historian, delved into Japan's past to discover what had gone wrong and how to set it right again. His conclusion was: "The Way that Amaterasu used in antiquity to administer the realm, to achieve spiritual unity among the people, and to endear them inseparably to their rulers can be used today." 84 In "Kokutai" and "A 

124 

Kokutai 

Long-Range Policy," he clarified how this Way had produced popular allegiance in antiquity and proposed how to recover it. 

Yukoku and Aizawa held that the sages' original intent (whether they be Chinese or Japanese) was to nourish the people, eliminate hardship from their lives, and provide ethical instruction and spiritual fulfillment. 85 Basing himself on myths found in Kojiki and Nihon shoki, Aizawa asserted that Amaterasu bestowed the gift of rice upon her people because of her great concern for their welfare. 86 Thus, rice was her sacred gift to the Japanese people alone. As her descendents, they were obliged to treasure and revere this cereal, to display unceasing gratitude to her, and to extend this feeling of gratitude to her lineal descendents on the imperial throne. 87 Amaterasu also had provided the Japanese people with silk to make clothing 88 and with other items that made daily life less toilsome. As a result of this original gift of rice bestowed by Amaterasu, and in part because Japan was climatically suited to the cultivation of grains, Japanese customs and folkways had been cast along certain distinctive lines: "Our people do not eat flesh and drink blood as the barbarians do, hence, our country has been known as "The Land of Ripening Rice Crests' since ancient times."89 Such particularities of diet and dress, Aizawa held, were an important part of Japan's kokutai and had to be preserved. 

Amaterasu's imperial descendents also had established Kuni no miyatsuko, Agata nushi, and other administrative organs in antiquity. These organs governed the people and enabled them to enjoy personal security within a stable social framework. In this manner, sage emperors had laid down a political and social order that Aizawa labeled "feudal" (hōken). First created in antiquity, it was reestablished by Tokugawa Ieyasu. This hōken system corresponded to the bakuhan state, was an integral part of Japan's kokutai, and as such, might not be altered fundamentally. 

Finally, Amaterasu provided her people with ethical instruction. This was not expressed in words; it was embodied in the Three Imperial Regalia and conveyed through religious rituals. The jewel, mirror, and sword, embodied virtue, wisdom, and courage respectively. 90 The Daijo, Niiname, and other rituals 

125 

Aizawa and New Theses 

were means to teach loyalty and filial devotion[^91] This was the Way that, according to Aizawa, Amaterasu had established in antiquity-nourishing the people, eliminating hardship from their lives, and providing them with ethical instruction and spiritual fulfillment. 92 The last aspect of this Way-Amaterasu's methods of edifying her people and meeting their emotional needs-is the most important to consider here. 

Aizawa conceived of Amaterasu and early Japanese sage emperors such as Jimmu, Tenji, and Sujin, as identical to Yao, Shun, the Duke of Chou, and other former sage kings of the Confucian pantheon because they all had created rites and music as the Way to facilitate government. 93 Aizawa's ideas on the Way and sageliness did not derive solely from Sorai. With regard to Amaterasu and her Way, Aizawa wrote: 

In antiquity, Amaterasu (Tenso) established teachings (oshie) in accordance with the "spirit-like processes of nature" (shen tao), thus elucidating loyalty and filial devotion and prescribing the rules of conduct by which men live. It is by means of these teachings that the realm can be maintained for all eternity. 94 (emphasis added) 

In antiquity, Amaterasu (Shinsei) established teachings (oshie) in accordance with the "spirit-like processes of nature" (shen tao), and thereby captured the hearts of the people. Her teachings were the only doctrine by which popular allegiances could be secured. 95 (emphasis added) 

The Way that Amaterasu established was shen tao. Aizawa took the above phrases verbatim from the Book of Changes: 

When they [the sages] gaze upon the spirit-like processes of nature (shen tao), the seasons unfold in proper order. The sages established teachings in accordance with these spirit-like processes of nature (shen tao), and the realm submits [in proper order][^96] (emphasis added) 

Aizawa here reveals his intellectual debts to Yamazaki Ansai and Asami Keisai for the idea of "coincidental correspondences": He substitutes the Sun Goddess, Amaterasu, (Tenso, Shinsei) for "the sages," and inserts "loyalty and filial devotion" as the

tao. 

دو 

Kokutai 

specific teachings that she established "in accordance with shen For Aizawa, as for Asami Keisai, the Way revealed itself coincidentally in both Chinese and Japanese classics: China's shen tao and Japan's shinto were separate but essentially similar Ways. 

9997 

In 

By means of such sagely teachings, Aizawa believed, the realm could be induced to submit voluntarily. And so it was in antiquity. But how? Following Sorai, Aizawa writes, "This ultimate ethic of loyalty and filial devotion existed without overt expression and was unconsciously adhered to by all in antiquity. that era, Japan's sage emperors gained the people's willing compliance to the teachings of Amaterasu, founder of their imperial line. They did this not by resorting to arguments or explanations, but by employing the mystical, suggestive power of ritual: 

In antiquity, religious ritual corresponded to government, administration was ultimately identical with edification, and the people looked to their leaders for the fulfillment of their desires... There was a ritual for every meaning His Majesty sought to convey, and through these rituals, the people became aware that the Emperor's [heartfelt wishes were] intended to benefit them. They rejoiced in this realization and their loyal and filial devotion were made pure and directed to but one object. 98 

In this manner, the sage emperors of antiquity achieved spiritual unity; "each person was loyal to his own ruler and all revered the imperial court." Through state-prescribed rituals, each sage emperor conveyed the meaning of "service to Heaven,' "reverence for ancestors," "love of the people," and gratitude to Amaterasu for her original gifts of rice and silk which nurtured and clothed his people. 99 The imperial descendants of Amaterasu communicated this gratitude not through explanations or lectures, but through the Niiname and Daijo rituals, during which each emperor personally consumed newly harvested grain every fall and at the beginning of his reign. By viewing the emperor himself cherishing this precious commodity bestowed by Amaterasu, all persons who witnessed the ritual could not but come under his inducing influence (kwa). The 

127 

Aizawa and New Theses 

people became one with him in reverent appreciation for blessings received, and they submitted to the Way without question. This was the sages' ch'üan for securing the people's trust and allegiance. 

,,100 Former sage 

Another important characteristic of kokutai, or the spiritual unity and popular allegiance which had made Japan strong and wealthy in antiquity, was that all spiritual authority stemmed from the imperial court: It outlawed other teachings and ritual practices as heresies. "The performance of all religious rituals was subject to Court control, and the myriad deities of the land were integrated within a [centralized] system. emperors had worshipped local deities and heroes by distributing cloth offerings (heihaku) to shrines in the provinces, and thereby inspired reverent loyalty in people living there. 101 They had secured popular support in outlying areas through other methods as well. In antiquity, sacrificial rice fields and ritual sites for the Daijo and Niiname rituals were selected anew through divination on each occasion. Every year the rituals took place in different provinces, so people in all parts of the realm could witness the proceedings. 102 Moreover, people not residing in the province where one or the other ritual took place could still view the imperial processions passing along the nation's highways. 

103 Residents of the province where the ritual took place bore its expenses; they felt honored and privileged to play a part in its successful completion. 

Sujin was the sage emperor who perceived most astutely the need to carry out ritual performances in view of as many of the realm's people as possible: 

In those days, the Court still followed the ancient custom of worshipping the Sacred Mirror, the embodiment of Amaterasu [privately] within the imperial palace. The emperor [Sujin], however, was awe-struck and ill at ease. Therefore he transferred this imperial treasure to Kasanui, where he worshipped it publicly. He hoped to turn it into an object that everyone in the realm might revere with him. His Majesty's action was intended to make reverence for Amaterasu something common 

128 

Kokutai 

to the court and people, and to show the people that their worship of Amaterasu at once constituted reverence for the imperial court. 105 

Aizawa presents an enlightening explanation for Sujin's actions: 

By worshipping Amaterasu [privately] within court enclosures, earlier emperors had offered the full measure of their sincere devotion to Her, it is true. But the significance of [earlier] emperors' ritual acts was lost on the people below. By worshipping Amaterasu publicly, Emperor Sujin displayed his sincere devotion to the whole realm. Thus, the people grasped the significance of His Majesty's act [directly and sensually], not through explanations or lectures. 106 

Aizawa then attributed to Sujin sageliness and political acumen equal to that of the Duke of Chou: 

The ancients [i.e., Mencius] said, "Filial devotion by the realm en masse is the ultimate in filial devotion." When the Duke of Chou was praised in antiquity for having attained the "ultimate in filial devotion," it was because everyone in the realm [joined him] in worshipping his ancestors, each person according to his proper status. The Duke of Chou did not worship his parents within ritual-hall confines, but in public, together with his people. No doubt he had the same idea as Emperor Sujin. 

107 

Here we see another important element of "sageliness" for Aizawa-political calculation behind the conduct of ritual. 108 Aizawa argued that through religious rituals, Japanese sage emperors of antiquity had produced spiritual unity and allegiance, and thereby achieved kokutai. In later eras this kokutai disintegrated for two reasons. First, "wicked heresies" (jasetsu) from abroad, such as Buddhism and Christianity, created spiritual divisiveness. Second, "changed historical forces" (jisei no hen), such as those leading to warrior supremacy and the establishment of bakufu rule, required the altering of political institutions. 

129 

Aizawa and New Theses 

But the original blame for Japan's loss of kokutai, Aizawa tacitly admitted, lay with the imperial court: 

In later ages, rulers conducted these affairs [rituals and politics] in an abbreviated and simplified manner. The sacrificial rice fields and ritual sites employed in the Daijo ritual [which formerly had been located in different provinces from year to year], became permanently established [in Omi, Tamba, and Bitchu Provinces]. The ritual itself then became limited to the area in and around the capital. The emperor's will and the significance behind his religious rituals were lost upon the people in the realm as a whole. 

Thus [in later ages], rulers might explain and lecture to every household and domicile in the land; yet not a soul could be made to understand. These same rituals, though extant today, have lost their [mystical, transforming] function. How lamentable indeed! 109 

Astute sage emperors such as Sujin had taken pains to perform state rituals in full public view in order to achieve the desired effects. But from the mid-Heian period onward, 110 emperors (and shoguns) neglected and ignored the political ends that religious rituals and their mystical, suggestive power should be employed to achieve. Latter-day rulers "simply conducted rituals in a perfunctory fashion, ignoring the significance contained therein." As a result, "the myriad deities and countless rituals lacked systematic organization and coherence; the people no longer directed their devotion to a single object."111 

Aizawa did not reprove latter-day emperors explicitly, but alert readers will readily discern his critical attitude. Those emperors failed to utilize religious rituals to evoke voluntary affection and trust from the people-this was the fundamental reason why Amaterasu's Way declined in Japan. Unlike Confucian historians in the early and mid-Tokugawa eras, who criticized emperors for turpitude, Aizawa placed the imperial court above moral judgment. Yukoku and Aizawa skirted the question of the emperors' moral and political culpability through the concept of sei, "historical forces or conditions."112 According to 

130Kokutai 

their view, the seizure of imperial prerogatives at court by Fujiwara regents (sesshō) and civil dictators (kampaku), the eclipse of this sekkan government due to rising warrior clans in the provinces, Yoritomo's establishment of bakufu rule, the period 

of disorder, civil war, and Ieyasu's reestablishment of bakufu rule that followed-were all beyond human power to alter. These developments resulted from "historical forces or conditions" or from a "constant tendency" for "orderly rule and anarchy" to follow each other in recurring fashion. 113 This concept of sei, the impersonal forces, conditions, or laws that moved history, in Aizawa's view, required no further explanation and absolved emperors of all personal responsibility. Even so, Aizawa had to admit that the spiritual unity created by sage emperors in antiquity diminished and disappeared when later emperors stopped performing religious rituals properly. And Japan's people became susceptible to foreign heresies such as Buddhism and Christianity because of that spiritual disunity and unrest: 

In subsequent ages rulers lacked vision and planning, and they made but a pretense of serving Heaven and revering ancestors. As a result, the people lost their object of reverential awe in life and their place of repose in death. Doubts and fears arose among them, and they began to yearn for a source of spiritual reliance. Then the Western barbarians succeeded in striking further anxiety in the commoners' hearts by spreading doctrines of paradise and hell. 114 

At present, commoners "embrace the foreigners' words of religion as they long for a mother's compassion; they are attracted to any pernicious doctrine from abroad because they need a basis of spiritual reliance within. "115 It was this "spiritual void," which Ōhara Sakingo also had detected, that was so easy for the barbarians to take advantage of. This was Japan's greatest vulnerability to foreign incursion in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. 

In antiquity, Aizawa argued, Japan's sage emperors had "transformed" barbarians such as the Ezo, Emishi, Hayato, Kumaso, and the inhabitants of Korea, Siberia, and other lands on the continent to the ways of civilization. Now the tables were reversed: 

131 

Aizawa and New Theses 

The Western barbarians have grown tremendously powerful in recent times; what is more, they too have learned how to discern prevailing conditions confronting them and to ply stratagems of their own. . . . They have appropriated the stratagem that our sage emperors in antiquity once used to subjugate barbarians, and at this moment, seek to turn it against our Middle Kingdom. 116 

very 

At 

Although their teachings were wickedly false, barbarian leaders seemed to display certain characteristics of sageliness. The threat posed by them necessitated a reapplication of "the sages' ch'üan" by bakufu leaders responsible for Japan's defense: "We must transform them [the Western barbarians] by appropriating the very Way they now seek to use to transform us."117 The Tokugawa bakufu could achieve kokutai as it once existed in antiquity by utilizing the emperor to conduct religious state rituals. present, the emperor was "conducting these rituals in an abbreviated and simplified manner," he "made but a pretense of 'serving Heaven' and 'revering ancestors""; and he did so within court enclosures as emperors before Sujin (who lacked sagely acumen) had done. The bakufu now had to place the emperor on public display, so that it could exploit the mystical, transforming power latent in his officially prescribed rituals and thus create popular unity and allegiance. In short, Aizawa argued that the bakufu should and must avail itself of the emperor's religious authority to shore up its own political authority. 

Western Learning played a key role in shaping Aizawa's concept of Japan's kokutai. Knowledge acquired from abroad convinced him that the strength of Western nations stemmed from their rulers' use of religion as an integral part of government. Through Christian "ritual and music," rulers in the West produced spiritual unity and allegiance at home. And away from home, "they defeated enemy armies without resorting to battle and conquered territories intact" which was the best of all possible victories 119 according to Sun Tzu. The bakufu, Aizawa urged, should emulate these shrewd foreign leaders by reviving Amaterasu's Way, her form of ritual and music, which in Japan had fallen into neglect after the coming of Buddhism, the rise of 

132 

Kokutai 

Fujiwara regencies, and the emergence of warrior rule. Aizawa's knowledge of contemporary Western political institutions, though not abundant and often inaccurate, provided an alternative model with which to contrast the existing Tokugawa sociopolitical order. This contrast led him to restudy his own nation's history to determine why and how the separation of "religion and government" and of "edification and administration" had taken place. Through this reexamination of history-including the so-called Age of the Gods, which earlier Confucian historians had dismissed as mythology-Aizawa concluded that a long process of secularization had occurred in Japanese society. This secularization, which increased with each change in historical conditions or "Great Transformation" in Japan's past, had weakened and impoverished the nation both spiritually and materially.

In sum, Western Learning convinced Aizawa that the main foreign threat to Japan's bakuhan state in 1825 was not a military threat; it stemmed from the popular spiritual unity that he believed Western rulers had achieved through their state cult of Christianity. This discovery led him to compose New Theses, in which he argued that the bakufu must establish a similar state cult to create a similar form of popular spiritual unity, or kokutai. Only then could Japan overcome its present foreign crisis. He urged bakufu leaders to include religious elements in their administration, not through proscription or family-temple registration systems, which served merely to suppress deviance, but by evoking voluntary, active allegiance among Japan's masses. Aizawa proposed that the bakufu could compensate for inadequacies in its traditional methods of social control-so unsuccessful in winning popular support-by reviving and utilizing the Emperor's religio-political role as the performer of prescribed state rituals. 121 Then religion and government, as well as administration and edification, would be one in Japan too. 

Like his knowledge of conscription in the West, Aizawa's understanding of the supposed unity of Western religion and government led him to submit a reform proposal that ultimately proved incompatible with the structural principles of the Tokugawa bakuhan state. Ever since issuing the "Regulations for

Aizawa and New Theses 

Court and Nobility" (Kinchu narabi ni kuge shohatto) in 1615, the bakufu had striven to dissociate itself from court-related sources of authority or legitimacy in various ways. For example, scholar-advisors to the bakufu such as Arai Hakuseki and Ogyu Sorai had urged that Edo institute its own separate court ranks and rituals. By acknowledging, even tacitly, bakufu dependence on the spiritual authority of emperor and court for functional administrative purposes, Aizawa unknowingly introduced the possibility of an alternative locus of sovereignty in the bakuhan state. His proposals went beyond current legitimizing theories of the investiture (miyosashi, go-inin) of authority from court to bakufu. Aizawa would make the emperor the principal performer of religious rituals which formed a key part of shogunal state administration. Of course he believed that the popular unity and allegiance instilled by the emperor's performance of state rituals necessarily would shore up bakufu rule. To him it was a foregone conclusion that emperor and court remain under bakufu control. Aizawa was writing, we should recall, in an era of possible but not imminent military danger from abroad. Moreover, bakufu leaders had yet to discredit themselves toward the court in any way. Thus his argument for using the emperor's religious authority to bolster bakufu political supremacy was sensible and compelling. In 1825, this seemed an ideal way to reinforce secular bakufu rule. But after 1853, historical conditions changed so drastically that neither Japanese nor foreigners would tolerate a form of state authority divided between secular and sacred sovereigns.

[^2]: Wang Fu-chih, a late Ming Confucian widely regarded as "protonationalistic," held the same view of "cultural joi." The shih, or literatiofficial class, had to maintain the distinctions of civilization and barbarism, and of superior men (chün-tzu) and small men (hsiao-jen). To maintain these distinctions, Wang said, the shih must "build barriers" between Chinese commoners and alien barbarians.

However, we should note that Takahashi would not allow Japanese vessels to venture beyond this ten ri limit. Thus, his ideas should be thought of as a logical extension of "sakoku" to the seas surrounding Japan.

[^55]: I agree with Yasumaru Yoshio, who sees Mito thinkers as understanding the need to tap popular energies, to create a "Japanese nation" (kokumin) that would work actively toward fulfilling national goals rather than "serfs" (nodo) who merely acquiesced in passive fashion. See Yasumaru, Nihon nashonarizumu no zenya, pp. i-ii, and pp. 155-157. However, such a change would have placed burdens on the feudal mibun order that it could not have borne.

This last volume contains useful modern Japanese translations of basic Mitogaku texts, including Aizawa's Shinron. My understanding of both Sorai and Mitogaku, as will be apparent in the following paragraphs, owes much to the excellent works of Professors Bitō and Hashikawa, which is gratefully acknowledged.

[^63]: This is Mencius' well-known usage in the "Li-lou" chapter. See D. C. Lau, tr., Mencius, pp. 124-125; also see Lau's discussion of the term, "ch'üan" in "Appendix 5," of the same volume.

[^64]: Professor Oba Osamu of Kansai University has called my attention to this aspect of "ch'üan." He contends that "ch'üan" should be interpreted according to the Japanese usage of "gon," as in "gon-dainagon" or other "gon-kan," of the Nara and Heian periods. The gon-dainagon was a permanent extra-legal post with real administrative functions, but at other times, particularly in cases of envoys to the Sui or T'ang court, a "gon" rank or office would be granted as a temporary expedient. It would be in effect only during the envoy's term in China, was purely nominal in nature, and was instituted to obtain favorable treatment relative to envoys from other nations who possessed lower official ranks in their home countries.

[^65]: Yamazaki Anzai quotes Chu Hsi to this effect in Hekki, p. 245. Even when a sage employed it, ch'üan might become the object of criticism by Japanese Confucians when associated with the idea of the Heavenly Mandate as a justification for overthrowing an existing dynasty. See for example, Asami Keisai's usage in Kōyū sōshi setsu, pp. 233-234, where he approvingly quotes Confucius' words of censure, "King Wen's was the ultimate in virtue; [the overthrower] Wu did not fully perform goodness."

[^81]: Aizawa's term "kokutai" is extremely difficult to translate. Basically, it has two meanings "the nation's honor or prestige" (kuni no taimen) and "what is essential" to a land and people in forming a "nation." In this latter sense, "tai" assumes roughly the same meaning of t'i in the Ch'ing

299

Notes to Pages 124-129

Confucians' "t'i-yung" thinking. That is, "tai" is some defining quality or group of characteristics that may not be allowed to undergo "transformation." In the Ch'ing context, however, t'i was what was of essence to the shih, or literati-official class; it did not become connected to a "nation."

[^108]: I have profited from J. Victor Koschmann, "Discourse in Action: Representational Politics in Mito in the Late Tokugawa Period," pp. 9293. Koschmann describes Aizawa's use of ritual to induce popular obedience and allegiance as "a principle of 'magical' government" according to the definition of "magic" given by Herbert Fingarette. However, Fingarette explains, "The user of magic does not work by strategies and devices as a means toward an end..." See Confucius: The Secular as Sacred, p. 3. Yet in my opinion, this is precisely what Sorai and Aizawa argue that the former sage kings, Amaterasu, and barbarian leaders had done. Ritual and music were deemed a "technique" (jutsu) by Sorai, and a "device" (gu) by Aizawa: The sages and Amaterasu had invented and utilized religious ritual for the purpose of securing order in the realm, and the Westerners had invented a false imitation for similar purposes.
