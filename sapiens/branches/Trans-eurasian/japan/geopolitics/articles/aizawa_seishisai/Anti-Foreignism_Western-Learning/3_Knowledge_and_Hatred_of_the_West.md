THE ROAD TO NATIONAL ISOLATION: MISCONCEPTIONS OF "SAKOKU" 

In 1838, Takano Chōei and his colleagues in Western Learning were apprehensive about how the bakufu would treat a Western ship they mistakenly assumed was approaching Japan. In fact, the bakufu had already driven away the vessel in question (named the Morrison) one year before. Chōei, however, believed that the eminent English Sinologist, Robert Morrison, was commanding the ship and was repatriating Japanese castaways. And he distrusted Morrison's motives: 

The bakufu has always stipulated that other nations return our castaways by placing them in custody of the Dutch, that only the Dutch repatriate them. England is a neighbor of Holland; the English should be well aware of this law. Indeed, a few years ago [in 1830], a Japanese ship from Bizen was cast ashore in the English territory of India, and on that occasion, the English repatriated our nationals through the Dutch. Why are they using one of their own ships to return our castaways this time? Moreover, if they simply wanted to return castaways, they could place anyone in charge of the mission. Why do they assign so high-ranking an officer as Morrison? None of this sets right[^1] 

Chōei reasoned as follows: The Dutch and English were competing for commerce and empire in the Far East, and the Dutch had been slandering the English as pirates to be kept out of Japan; this was to protect their monopoly on Japanese trade. Morrison realized that bakufu officials, misled by these Dutch slanders, would enforce the 1825 Expulsion Edict. By the overtly 

58 

Road to National Isolation 

humanitarian act of returning Japanese castaways, however, he would allay suspicions of English rapacity and set about achieving his ulterior motive-to prevail on the bakufu to grant England trading privileges. But Chōei argued: 

From the beginning of the present [Tokugawa] dynasty, the hallowed law (goseido) of national isolation (sakoku) has limited our trade with barbarian nations to Holland; it allows trade with no others. Therefore granting permission to trade is unthinkable. And at any rate, the law (osadame) holds that because visits by Western ships are bothersome, we must fire on and drive them off...[^2] 

By the 1830s and 1840s, Takano Chōei, Aizawa Seishisai, Watanabe Kazan, and many other Japanese were under the impression that sakoku, or national isolation, was a policy dating from the beginning of Tokugawa rule, if not earlier[^3] They believed that it restricted Japan's "barbarian" trading partners to Holland, and that it demanded the armed expulsion of all other Western nationals. Thus, only the Dutch might return Japanese castaways. Most important, they believed that this hallowed law was an integral part of the Tokugawa ruling system and that bakufu leaders would enforce it any any cost-even to the point of sinking foreign vessels that were returning shipwrecked Japanese nationals. By the 1830s and 1840s, altering or rescinding sakoku was unthinkable to many, if not most, Japanese. 

Such nineteenth-century notions were anachronistic. The Edo bakufu's 1825 Expulsion Edict was not a reaffirmation of its so-called "Seclusion Edicts of the Kan'ei Era" issued from 1633 to 1639. National isolation and the expulsion of foreigners, as consciously-conceived state policies, came into being between 1793 and 1825. They owed their existence not only to bakufu design, but also to waning Dutch power, compared with that of Britain and Russia, in Far Eastern waters. 

On the one hand, Matsudaira Sadanobu formulated and instituted national isolation (sakoku) as bakumatsu thinkers would understand it, when he rejected Russian overtures for trade and diplomatic relations in 1793. (The term sakoku itself, howwas coined in 1801.) In 1793, Sadanobu referred to 

ever, 

59 

Knowledge and Hatred of the West

venerable conventions forbidding Japan from trading with countries other than Ch'ing China and Holland, and from exchanging diplomatic messages with countries other than Korea and the Ryukyus. In 1804, the bakufu explicitly declared to the Russian ambassador, Nicolai Petrovich Rezanov, that those conventions were inviolable national laws, and it repeated this declaration to Russia in 1813[^7] 

6 

On the other hand, the bakufu's policy of driving away foreigners by force emerged in final form with the Expulsion Edict of 1825. The text reads: 

We have issued instructions on how to deal with foreign ships on numerous occasions up to the present. In the Bunka era [1804-17], we issued new edicts to deal with Russian ships. But a few years ago, a British ship wreaked havoc in Nagasaki [the Phaeton Incident of 1808], and more recently their rowboats have been landing to procure firewood, water, and provisions. Two years ago they forced their way ashore [in Satsuma domain], stole livestock and extorted rice. Thus they have become steadily more unruly, and moreover, seem to be propagating their wicked religion among our people. This situation plainly cannot be left to itself. 

All Southern Barbarians and Westerners, not only the English, worship Christianity, that wicked cult prohibited in our land. Henceforth, whenever a foreign ship is sighted approaching any point on our coast, all persons on hand should fire on and drive it off. If the vessel heads for the open sea, you 

need not pursue it; allow it to escape. If the foreigners force their way ashore, you may capture and incarcerate them, and if their mother ship approaches, you may destroy it as circumstances dictate. 

Note that Chinese, Koreans, and Ryukyuans can be differentiated [from Westerners] by physiognomy and ship design, but Dutch ships are indistinguishable [from those of other Westerners]. Even so, have no compunctions about firing on [the Dutch] by mistake; when in doubt, drive the ship away without hesitation. Never be caught offguard. 8 

60Road to National Isolation 

The stipulations of this edict plainly reveal why it was epochmaking. Two new types of Westerners, the Russians and British, had appeared in Japanese waters in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. The Japanese could not tell the various Western ships and peoples apart, and as we shall see, this confusion created unprecedented difficulties which forced the bakufu to revise current foreign policies. Moreover, these new Western nationals, unlike the Dutch, refused to obey bakufu-dictated rules governing Japan's foreign relations. They had become "steadily more unruly"; brute force now was called for. The Dutch would continue to be permitted entry at Nagasaki-but only there. Should they or other Westerners approach Japanese shores anywhere else, they faced immediate armed expulsion. The indiscriminate and unconditional character of the 1825 Expulsion Edict made it decisively different from earlier bakufu decrees ordering that Westerners be excluded or expelled from Japan. Let us briefly trace how bakufu methods of dealing with foreign ships evolved from the Kan'ei era (1624-43) down to the late eighteenth century. This will provide the historical background needed to clarify why Western Learning prompted early nineteenth century thinkers and leaders to institute policies of national isolation and armed expulsion of Westerners. In short, why did increased knowledge of, and contact with, Western peoples and cultures lead to xenophobia in men like Aizawa Seishisai and Takano Chōei? 

It is important to keep in mind that during the 1500s and 1600s Japan and the Western world were still very far apart geographically. In those centuries, the only Europeans to visit Japan were the Spanish, Portuguese, English, and Dutch. The so-called "Seclusion Edicts of the Kan'ei Era" issued from 1633 to 1639 were motivated primarily by the desires to eradicate Christianity and to establish bakufu controls over trade. These edicts prohibited Iberian missionaries from coming to Japan and Japanese nationals from leaving the country. They did not apply to the Dutch, who were permitted to trade in Japan. And they were not binding on the English, who had left Japan voluntarily in 1623 due to economic distress at home and to a number 

9 

61 

Knowledge and Hatred of the West 

of military setbacks incurred against Dutch forces in the Far East. 10 The Kan'ei edicts ordered only the Portuguese and Spanish out of Japan; only these two peoples were subject to armed expulsion should they return, and the Spanish never did. 

In effect, then, the Edo bakufu excluded no foreign peoples other than the Portuguese from Japan. After the decline of China as a maritime power in the sixteenth century and the issuance of the Kan'ei edicts which halted Japanese naval development, Portugal and Holland were left as the main competitors for mastery of the seas in East Asia. It is a little-known fact that during the seventeenth century, Dutch, not Japanese, forces "expelled" most foreigners from the oceans surrounding Japan. From 1629 to 1635, for example, the Dutch navy destroyed over one hundred fifty Portuguese ships in Far Eastern waters. In 1641, Dutch forces seized the key Portuguese colony of Malacca, and in 1642, captured Taiwan from Spain, thereby overpowering these two European rivals and establishing colonial supremacy in the region. 11 As long as Dutch naval power went unchallenged in the Far East, Tokugawa Japan largely was spared troublesome visits by other foreign peoples. But in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, Russia and England arrived to challenge the Dutch, and the resulting confusion forced bakufu leaders to institute a policy of indiscriminate armed expulsion in 1825. 

In contrasting the Kan'ei edicts of the 1630s with the 1825 Expulsion Edict, we should note that the earlier edicts did not authorize local daimyo to attack and destroy foreign ships on sight. Instead, the bakufu ordered daimyo to escort intruding vessels to Nagasaki under armed guard. 12 Presumably, bakufu officials there were responsible for sending them away. Not until the 1640s and 1650s did the bakufu authorize daimyo in coastal areas to destroy Iberian ships. But it stipulated that the daimyo should do so only if those ships tried to call at a port or put men ashore; if the ships merely passed by or anchored offshore, the daimyo should take no hostile action. 13 Second, the sole instance of the bakufu actually destroying a Western vessel under the Kan'ei edicts took place in 1640. Besides sinking the Portuguese ship in question, bakufu forces killed sixty-one of 

62 

Road to National Isolation 

14 

The those on board and deported thirteen others to Macao. bakufu itself would not exercise force against an intruding Western vessel again until 1837, when it drove away the Morrison. During the two centuries between 1640 and 1837, the bakufu's basic policy toward foreign vessels was to avoid armed confrontation. Edo leaders repeatedly commanded daimyo in coastal areas to try to persuade foreign ships to leave peaceably, and to seek bakufu intercession if necessary, but to use force only as a 

last resort. 

Thus the Kan'ei edicts of the 1630s, which excluded only the Spanish and Portuguese from Japan, did not constitute a policy of joi in the key nineteenth-century sense of indiscriminate and unconditional armed expulsion. In 1647, a mere eight years after the last Kan'ei exclusion edict was issued, two Portuguese men-of-war appeared in Nagasaki Bay. The bakufu magistrates there ordered the captains to surrender munitions before coming ashore, but this order was ignored. In haste, the magistrates put troops from nearby domains on alert, informed Edo of the intruders' presence, and awaited orders. The bakufu replied that there was no need to expel these ships because they bore a royal ambassador informing Japan of Portugal's independence If from Spain and the accession of a new Portuguese king. either the Nagasaki magistrates or bakufu officials in Edo had construed the Kan'ei exclusion edicts in the nineteenth-century sense of joi, they would have ordered those vessels destroyed immediately. But quite to the contrary, the magistrates supplied food, water, and firewood to the Portuguese ships-even though their captains contemptuously had defied orders to surrender their arms. 

16 In one case, local daimyo destroyed a foreign ship under the Kan'ei exclusion edicts: Fukuoka, Hirado, and Karatsu clansmen attacked and sank a Western vessel in 1644. But their act plainly violated the 1640 bakufu decree enjoining daimyo to escort such vessels to Nagasaki peaceably." 

17

During the seventeenth century, then, the only Westerners that the Japanese knew from direct contact were the Spanish, Portuguese, English, and Dutch. The Edo bakufu subjected the Portuguese alone to armed expulsion, and only if they tried to land, not if they merely appeared in Japanese waters. Prior to 

63 

Knowledge and Hatred of the West 

the nineteenth century, the bakufu used force against foreigners only in the Kan'ei era, from 1624 to 1644. From the second half of the seventeenth century, the bakufu became increasingly lenient. For example, it customarily rewarded with thirty bales of rice Dutch, Chinese, or Korean ships that returned shipwrecked Japanese nationals. In 1685, it even extended this kindness to the Portuguese. 

18 

The policy of sakoku, or national isolation-in the sense of limiting trade and diplomacy to specific countries-also came into being in the period 1793 to 1825. The Kan'ei edicts did not prohibit trade with foreign countries other than Holland and Ch'ing China. When the English ship, the Return, arrived in Nagasaki requesting permission to reopen trade with Japan in 1763, the Nagasaki magistrates received its captain hospitably, and bakufu officials in Edo also showed a desire to grant his request. The Dutch factory captain on Dejima in Nagasaki Bay, however, pointed out that the English and Portuguese ruling houses were related through marriage, intimating that England too, was a Christian country that should be banned from coming to Japan. (Of course, the Dutch offered this information out of a desire to preserve their monopoly on European trade with Japan.) It was solely for this reason-fear of Christianity-that the bakufu refused the English request to reopen trade. 19 

In their communiqué, bakufu officials said nothing about Japan's trade being restricted by law to Ch'ing China and Holland, because no such law existed. Non-Western foreign peoples, from Siam, Annam, and Cambodia, who had traded with Japan earlier in the century were not prohibited from returning. These peoples stopped coming after the 1640s largely because the Dutch navy forcibly prevented them from reaching Japan. This was to protect the Dutch East India Company's trading interests in the Far East. 20 Officials in the Company also used a variety of obstructionist tactics against Chinese, French, and Danish merchants to maintain their monopoly on Japanese trade. 21 Thus, Japan's lessened trade and diplomatic contacts with the outside world in the sixteenth century did not result solely from the bakufu's Kan'ei edicts. The Dutch 

64 

Road to National Isolation 

did their best to cut foreigners off from Japan, and this helped create the illusion of a closed country from the 1640s onward. 

In 1739, Captain Martin Spanberg visited Japan commanding a fleet of Russian vessels. His party landed and bartered goods at Ojika in Sendai domain, Awa (Chiba), and Shimoda. 22 The party also reportedly left behind pieces of silver and written messages containing sketches of crosses. The bakufu promptly confiscated these notes and turned them over to the Dutch for deciphering, but showed little further interest in the Russians' activities. 23 After the fleet departed, the bakufu instructed daimyo that in the future, foreigners should be apprehended if they attempted to land, but otherwise they should be left to go up deaway. It issued no statements about the need to shore fenses or drive away foreigners by force. 

In 1771, Baron Moritz Aladar von Benyowsky landed in Awa (Chiba), Tosa in Shikoku, and on Amamiōshima in Satsuma domain. 24 He delivered messages through Satsuma officials addressed to the Dutch on Nagasaki, and in one of these, warned that Russia had fortified the Kuriles and was planning to attack Matsumae. Implicit in his statement, however, was that Russia's southward advance endangered the Dutch position in Japan. His message leaked to the Japanese in garbled form, and caused in the last quarter of the century great consternation over a possible Russian threat from the north. Here we need only note that officials in Awa, Tosa, and Satsuma supplied provisions to Benyowsky without incurring bakufu punishment. A British ship landed at Kumano in the Tokugawa collateral domain of Kii in 1791, and it also received supplies and hospitable treatment. The bakufu's lack of punitive measures following these and similar incidents indicates indifference to, or even tacit approval of, local daimyo who provided food, water, and firewood to foreign ships. 

In 1777, a Russian ship appeared in Ezo requesting permission to trade. The following year, Matsumae domain officials answered that all Japanese trade with foreign nations was handled at Nagasaki, so the Russians must go there to make their petition. The Russians refused, saying that the Dutch were in Nagasaki. 25 Even at this late date, however, Matsumae officials said 

65 

Knowledge and Hatred of the West 

nothing about Japan's trade being legally restricted to China and Holland because the idea was not yet widely held or firmly 

established. 

The Russian ambassador, Adam Laxman, made the first serious challenge to the Dutch monopoly on Western trade with Japan when he arrived in Ezo (present-day Hokkaido) in 1792[^26] Matsudaira Sadanobu, then head of the bakufu, was willing to open a port to Russian trade in Ezo temporarily, as a way of keeping the Russians from coming to Edo Bay and discovering the lack of Japanese defenses. He clearly did not advocate opening the country to trade as a matter of principle, only as an expedient. At any rate, in 1792 he led Laxman to believe that going to Nagasaki to make his petition was merely a formality, that the bakufu would permit trade. However, in the following year, 1793, Sadanobu replied, making the following points: 

1. From ancient times, Japan has been bound by the following proscriptions: (a) when a ship from a country not maintaining diplomatic relations with the bakufu approaches shore, we must seize or destroy it at sea. (b) Every foreign ship, even those returning Japanese castaways, may call at no port other than Nagasaki. (c) Should a foreign ship from a country without diplomatic ties be "cast upon our shores,"27 we must turn it over to the Dutch in Nagasaki; they will repatriate it. (d) We must destroy any ship from a country not maintaining diplomatic ties that is cast upon our shores, and we must permanently incarcerate its crew. 

2. But in consideration of the trouble you took to return our nationals and your ignorance of our laws, we shall allow you to return home on the condition that you never return to this port (Nemuro). 

3. We do not understand the languages of countries with whom we have no diplomatic ties. Hence, we do not know the proper appellations used to address your sovereign, and we are unsure of what constitutes correct protocol. 28 This precludes an exchange of messages, though we do not disapprove of your returning our shipwrecked nationals. 

4. We may not permit you to call at Edo even though your sovereign has so instructed you. Our reasons are: (a) We exercise 

66 

Road to National Isolation 

strict controls in our dealings even with those countries who maintain trade or diplomatic relations with us. (b) No foreign ship may call anywhere besides Nagasaki. Our authorities at all other ports are instructed to destroy any foreign vessel that approaches shore. 

Sadanobu accepted the Japanese castaways that Laxman returned at Nemuro, and presented him with a permit (shimpai) to enter Nagasaki. However, let us examine the points in his replies against the historical record: There was only one instance of the bakufu destroying a foreign ship, this in 1640. The bakufu consistently held that force be used only when the intruders themselves were belligerent. There was no basis for the statement that foreign vessels returning Japanese castaways may do so only at Nagasaki: Laxman was the first to try elsewhere. That the bakufu could have no dealings with countries other than those already maintaining trade or diplomatic ties was true only for diplomatic relations, not trade. The bakufu never banned all countries other than Ch'ing China and Holland from coming to Japan; the Dutch had obstructed the others from coming, or else those countries abandoned their interests in Japan voluntarily. It was untrue that ships blown ashore from countries without diplomatic ties were sent to Nagasaki and their crews repatriated on Dutch ships. It was also untrue that the bakufu confiscated all ships, and permanently imprisoned all persons, from countries not maintaining diplomatic ties. Only Dutchmen were returned on Dutch ships. Ryukyuans and Koreans were repatriated on their own ships at Nagasaki or through Satsuma for the Ryukyuans and Tsushima for the Koreans. Moreover, the bakufu imprisoned and executed only Western missionaries such as Sidotti; not all Westerners cast upon Japanese shores. Benyowsky's visits, which had caused such a stir, were still within living memory-and he had been sent away safe and sound. 

Historical inaccuracies aside, Sadanobu's replies in 1793 established national isolation and the armed expulsion of Westerners as time-honored bakufu laws. In 1825, a scant thirty-two years later, when the bakufu issued its Expulsion Edict and Aizawa Seishisai composed New Theses, these not-so-hallowed 

67 

Knowledge and Hatred of the West 

laws became part of the established political order. Their revocation, as Takano Chōei lamented in 1838, was now unthinkable. National isolation and armed expulsion received support from politically conscious Japanese in all schools of thought; their popularity was by no means limited to followers of Mito Learning or Native Learning. Why did these policies, which had come into being so recently, win such widespread belief and acceptance? To answer this question, we must examine what information Japanese thinkers were receiving on Western and world affairs during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Such information quickly fostered support for anti-Western foreign policies. 

AIZAWA'S VIEW OF CHRISTIANITY: CONQUEST WITHOUT WARFARE 

Maeno Ryōtaku and other informed students of world affairs discovered that Western barbarians had developed superior religious teachings used as an integral part of government. The Europeans had perfected techniques of edification, which along with their benevolent and just political institutions, won appreciative support not only from their own peoples, but also from less-advanced barbarians in areas they annexed, such as the Americas, Africa, Australia, Siberia, and the Pacific islands off to Japan's south. Consequently, Western religious "teachings" and forms of government dominated a far greater portion of the earth than did any abstract Middle Kingdom Civilization. In 1795, Ōhara Sakingo (1760?-1810), one-time advisor to Matsumae domain, summed up the crisis facing late eighteenth-century Japan: 

Their [the Russians'] customs allow popular unity and integration (jinwa) to be well established. High and low act as one. Even the lowly and base are recruited if they be talented, so all government officials are men of worth. Moreover, since they have but one religion (ho) as a state teaching (oshie), once their people revere that religion, they do so for the rest of their lives. They consider its essence to lie in serving their sovereign while they live. In death as well, they believe them- 

68 

View of Christianity 

selves to be repaying the benefits of that religion, so they do not feel the slightest remorse. All of them-the sagacious and stupid according to their callings and the high and low according to their statuses-are united in striving to expand their territory. 29 

Ōhara Sakingo, Fujita Yukoku, and Aizawa Seishisai saw Christianity as the means that Western rulers used to achieve jinwa, or popular unity and integration, which was the key to national strength, wealth, and expansion. Aizawa conceived of kokutai and other ideas and policies outlined in New Theses largely out of a desire to achieve the same kind of popular unity in Japan that he believed Christianity and Christian-inspired government had created in Western nations. He construed kokutai, or what is essential to a nation, as the spiritual unity and integration that make a territory and its inhabitants a nation. He did not formulate this idea based solely on a perception of what Christianity was and how it spread. But I believe that Christianity was of prime importance and thus requires careful examination. 

Aizawa was no less impressed than Maeno Ryōtaku or Ōhara Sakingo with the fact that Christianity, rather than Confucian culture and values, had won the allegiance of most of the earth's inhabitants. It seems likely that his shock and chagrin at this discovery prompted him to conceive of the concept of kokutai, as outlined in New Theses. Despite the hostility Aizawa displayed toward Christianity in word and deed, it profoundly impressed him. His particular understanding of Western affairs made him hate and fear Christianity for the threat it posed. But at the same time, he sought to obtain for the bakufu the benefits in Christianity that made it threatening. The following two episodes are revealing in this respect. 

In the fifth month of 1792 the bakufu suppressed Hayashi Shihei's works and sentenced him to house arrest in Sendai. But by coincidence, Adam Laxman arrived in Nemuro later that year seeking permission to trade. This ominous event seemed to bear out Hayashi's warnings that Muscovite ships were fully 

69 

Knowledge and Hatred of the West 

capable of making their way to Japanese shores. A letter composed by Aizawa sometime during the 1850s describes his reac- 

tions to this event which he remembered from his childhood: 

In 1792 when I was at the tender age of eleven, the Russian barbarians arrived in northern Ezo. When Master Yukoku told me about their fearsome, cunning nature, my blood began to boil and I resolved then and there to drive them away. I built an earthen statue of Laxman and derived great pleasure by lashing it with my riding whip. From then on I vowed to devote myself to learning. 

Like all historical documents composed decades after the events they purport to describe, this letter of Aizawa's requires cautious examination; the historian must be wary of any image that Aizawa might have wanted to project of his youth. Even so, we can cull important insights. In addition to the fact that Aizawa nurtured an intense dislike of Russians, we learn that his resolution to devote himself to a lifelong pursuit of learning was first sparked by what he considered a foreign threat. He perceived a great danger in Laxman's arrival in Ezo, which remained for the most part unexplored, uncharted, and beyond the pale of Japanese civilization. The letter continues: 

The only thing that allows the barbarians to achieve their sinister designs is their wicked doctrine, which they use to incite stupid commoners to rebel. The only way we can counteract that wicked doctrine is to elucidate the Great Way of Justice. When our Great Way is clear to all, the barbarians' wicked religion will be foiled, and with it, their sole tactic of subversion. This is what the ancients meant by "counteracting the enemy's strategems in advance" and "capturing the hearts and minds of the foe."31 

The "wicked doctrine" is Christianity, which Yukoku and Aizawa believed was the prime weapon that Europeans used to subdue and colonize foreign nations. 

This same letter informs us of Aizawa's personal conviction that Heaven had conferred upon him a mission to extirpate heresy from the face of the earth. This mission would find 

70View of Christianity 

fulfillment only through the combined efforts of a "sagacious thinker" (Aizawa himself) and a "Great Hero."32 The original model for this Great Hero was probably Peter the Great. But the phrase Great Hero and Man of Talent and Virtue as mentioned in New Theses undoubtedly refer to Tokugawa Nariaki, whom Aizawa had personally tutored. 

In stark contrast to this irrepressible hostility toward Laxman, Aizawa expressed unconstrained admiration for another foreign visitor to Japan's shores-Giovanni Battista Sidotti, the Jesuit missionary interrogated by Arai Hakuseki in 1709. In an undated essay entitled "A Tract to Enlighten the Roman [Sidotti] (As Might Have Been Written by Arai Hakuseki)," Aizawa praised 

the Italian: 

You, sir, enjoy the blessings of and derive inner strength from your religion and system of government. Upon the order of your Pope you have traversed thousands of miles of desolate ocean, seeking only to disseminate the religion you hold so dear to your heart. I am deeply touched and impressed by your sense of patriotism, which fully accords with our own values of loyalty and truth. 33 

For Aizawa, Christianity was Russia's means of encroachment in Ezo; as such, he feared and hated it. At the same time, he considered Christianity the source of Sidotti's courage, fortitude, and spiritual strength; it was the inspiration for Sidotti's "patriotism" (hokoku no kokoro). It prompted Sidotti to forsake home and family and to devote himself wholeheartedly to overseas expansion and aggrandizement (or so Aizawa thought) in dutiful compliance with the will of his spiritual lord. Aizawa, then, attributed courage, fortitude, and patriotism to Sidotti's faith in Christianity. These were the very qualities that he and Yukoku sought to instill in the samurai class, a class whose physical prowess and spiritual vitality, they along with Hayashi Shihei, Ōhara Sakingo, and Sugita Gempaku judged, had been sapped by two hundred years of peace and soft living. 

Aizawa at first understood Christianity as Confucian ritual and music, but like Maeno Ryōtaku, he came to think of it as similar to the modern-day idea of state religion. 34 This 

71 

Knowledge and Hatred of the West 

institutionalized state or civil religion, Ohara and Aizawa concluded, was the secret behind Western military might and expansion because it enabled European rulers to unite and mobilize their own as well as foreign peoples. In Chihoku gudan (1795), 

Ōhara had written: 

Though the Russians scheme to annex other lands, they do not necessarily send troops directly. At times they use trade to conclude treaties of amity; or they first spread their state religion (sono kuni no oshie), and after winning the allegiance of the people [in question], convince them that it is not wrong to revolt against their sovereign. Thus they stir up trouble between that sovereign and his people and then send troops to take over the country. 

In Aizawa's mind as well, Christianity was an effective vehicle of sedition that allowed European rulers to practice the precepts of the Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu-to "vanquish enemies without resorting to battle" and achieve "the best of all victories," namely, "taking over enemy homelands intact."36 This image of the Cross as a power capable of subverting Japan and her civilized Confucian way of life explains both Aizawa's revulsion for Christianity and foreign peoples and his envious admiration of them. It was this ideological weapon, not Western armed might, that men such as Ōhara and Aizawa feared most in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. But how did Aizawa arrive at such an image of Christianity? What were the specific sources of his Western knowledge? 

Aizawa was not, as is commonly believed, a blind and ignorant xenophobe. In fact, he was fairly well-informed on world affairs. He was one of only a handful of Japanese, excluding bakufu interpreters or officials, who had interrogated a Westerner directly. If we are to evaluate accurately his anti-foreignism and joi thought, we must know the sources and the extent of his information on the outside world before he wrote New Theses in 1825. Furthermore, we should attempt to compare his knowledge of world developments with that held by other students of Western affairs during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Fortunately I have had access to two of his

unpublished, early manuscripts, Chishima ibun (1801) and An'i mondo (1824)[^37] Careful analysis of these two documents gives us a clear understanding of Aizawa's Western Learning. 

Ezo. 

38 

In the Tokugawa period, the only authorized points of contact with the outside world were Nagasaki and Matsumae in It is vital to bear in mind that even in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, "Ezo" was uncharted territory: It stood for all land(s) north of Matsumae domain, at the southern tip of present-day Hokkaido. Aizawa, for example, thought Ezo included Siberia, Manchuria, Kamchatka, Sakhalin, and the Kuriles. But more important, Japanese thinkers also thought of "Ezo" as a cultural entity; it was that area where Japanese customs and folkways did not obtain, where the inhabitants were believed to be culturally, if not racially, different from Japanese in Japan proper. Hayashi Shihei, for example, argued that the frontier boundary between Japan and Ezo had been pushed further and further north during history as more and more territory came under "the dynasty's sphere of moral suasion." He placed the current borderline at "Kumazeki,"39 (now pronounced "Kumaishi"), and defined this as "the limit to which Japanese customs extend."40 

Thus Ezo was Japan's only point of direct contact with peoples and cultures less advanced than her own. It was the only area that Japanese Confucians could, with some semblance of validity, designate barbarian (i) in contrast to their own Middle Kingdom Civilization (ka). Particularly during the "northern crisis" of the late eighteenth century, many Japanese thinkers began to think of Ezo as a possible avenue of foreign incursion by military or non-military means. It is clear from the writings of concerned thinkers such as Kudo Heisuke, Sugita Gempaku, Honda Toshiaki, Ōtsuki Gentaku, Hayashi Shihei, Mamiya Rinzō, Ōhara Sakingo, and Habuto Seiyō, that in the eyes of a small group of well-informed "Europe-watchers," Russia presented a grave threat to Japan's northern frontier. 

Opinion was divided on the exact nature of this threat and how to meet it. The most aggressive advocated forestalling Russia by occupying and developing Ezo. Modern historians discuss their proposals in terms of "colonizing" or "annexing" Ezo. But 

73 

Knowledge and Hatred of the West 

actually, these thinkers spoke of "edifying" and "transforming" 

the barbarian customs of the natives living there as the means of Hayashi gaining control over that territory. For example, Shihei, who considered the Japan-Ezo cultural border to be at Kumaishi, argued: "We should make Soya and Shiranushi in the northernmost part of Ezo the limit to which Japanese customs extend, and thereby incorporate the territory of Ezo into Japan."41 Such a move constituted overseas expansion, since even to irredentists like Hayashi, Honda, and Mogami, Ezo was a foreign land. 42 Shiranushi, in fact, was on the island of Sakhalin. 

44 

Opposed to the expansionists was a peace faction consisting of men like Nakai Chikuzan, Nakai Riken, Yamagata Banto, and (early in his career) Matsudaira Sadanobu. These men were "grateful that Heaven had made Ezo a desolate frontierland, "43 a barren buffer-zone against Russia to the north. This peace party believed that the best way to deal with the Russians was "to have nothing to do with them, to keep away from them "as one would from a mad dog. "45 To occupy and develop Ezo, they reasoned, would only expose Japan to danger. "To settle the area and spend money and grain attempting to develop it would not produce a return on our outlays in the foreseeable future." When prosperity finally did come to Ezo, "the Russians would only further be tempted to invade it."46 

The crux of the debate lay in whether Japan's leaders should respond aggressively or passively to the Russian threat. Should the bakufu take over and develop Ezo, thereby risking a greater frequency of encounters? Or should the bakufu leave the area as a "natural firebreak,"47 thus avoiding direct contact with the Russians as much as possible? Of course, at the bottom of this latter viewpoint lay the fear that encounters might lead to embarrassing military defeats. On the other hand, the expansionists worried about Russian encroachment through the "transformation" of native Ezo customs." The following ideas expressed by Hayashi Shihei in 1786 convey this fear, and at the same time introduce new conceptions of civilization and 

barbarism: 

74 

View of Christianity 

The Ezo are the same kind of people [as the Siberians who are now part of Russia], but their country has never undergone civilization. In antiquity there were no precious goods, no grains and silk, no writing, no ceremonial dress, and no methods of measuring time. Food-gathering and sexual intercourse were the only activities known. The Ezo remain just as they were in antiquity because no sagacious man has appeared to edify them. 

• 

Japan, China (Kara), Korea, and Holland now are civilized nations but at the time of their foundings, their peoples were just like the Ezo of today. However, sagacious men appeared and took pains to edify them during the following millenia. That is why they have become civilized nations. If a sagacious man appeared and edified the Ezo, they too would become a civilized nation. . . . The custom of their land is to exalt Japan. If we but edified them a little, their customs immediately would be transformed [in submission to us][^49] 

The relativization of the Middle Kingdom world view described in the last chapter has led to an interesting conclusion in this passage. Hayashi placed Japan, China, Korea, and Holland on an equal level as civilized nations (ka) that had evolved from a similar state of primitiveness that the Edo people then lived in. According to Hayashi's view of history, civilization (bunka or bumbutsu) developed in a cumulative, progressive fashion everywhere. A given country's level of civilization could rise due to the edification of its people through advanced teachings. Indeed, a people such as the primitive Ezo would eagerly aspire to be "transformed" and to obtain the benefits of civilized life. Japan's vulnerability to incursion from the north lay precisely in such aspirations. Ohara Sakingo wrote: 

The natives [of Ezo] are still like people in high antiquity: they have never heard any religious teachings (oshie) and suffer from a spiritual void (kushin, literally, "empty hearts"), which makes it easy for the Russians to disseminate their teaching. 50 

75 

Knowledge and Hatred of the West 

If the Russians took advantage of this spiritual void and seized Ezo, sooner or later they would be able to spread their own culture among those whom Yukoku and Aizawa called the "stupid 

commoners" in Japan proper. 

THE THREAT FROM THE NORTH: RUSSIA 

Tachi- 

The urgency of this northern crisis and the debate over how to meet it were not lost upon thinkers and officials in Mito. Tachihara Suiken (1774-1823), head of Mito's Historiographical Institute (Shōkōkan) in Edo, was a close personal friend of Honda Toshiaki's and secured copies of Honda's private manuscripts (which were never published) for Mito domain archives. 51 hara also obtained manuscripts and valuable information verbally from Ōhara Sakingo, 52 probably the most belligerent member of Japan's expansionist party in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Tachihara was so impressed with Ōhara's Chihoku gudan that he presented it to bakufu senior councilors, Matsudaira Nobuakira and Honda Tadakazu, for official inspec-. tion in 1795[^53] Copies of Honda's and Ōhara's manuscripts did exist in Mito and presumably were available to Aizawa through Yukoku. 54 

was 

In 1785-86, when Tanuma Okitsugu dispatched a bakufu exploring expedition to Ezo and other territories north of Japan, Tachihara managed to get a Mito clansman, Kimura Ken, included. (Kimura's report on the mission, Suiko hikki, 55 consulted and cited by Aizawa in Chishima ibun.) Tachihara passed on this concern over the northern threat to Yūkoku, then his prized pupil. Aizawa began his studies under Yukoku in 1791, at the age of nine. He clearly was impressed by his teacher's anxiety over Russia's presence in the north and by the ramifications it had for Japan's political and social order: 

76 

Master Yukoku had always been troubled deeply by the barbarians' prying along our coasts. In 1794 [sic], the Russians came to eastern Ezo seeking permission to trade. The master knew their ulterior motives all along. we allowed these Western barbarians to achieve their aims, He believed that if darkness would shroud the entire universe. 56 

Threat from the North 

At the time of Laxman's first visit to Ezo in 1792, Aizawa was ten. The statue-whipping episode related earlier indicates his emotional and violent reaction to foreign activities near Japan. Had Aizawa been content to go on lashing his statue, we might properly label him a blind and ignorant xenophobe. Instead, he went 

on to survey world conditions and Western (mainly Russian) history. His studies bore fruit in Chishima ibun, which he completed in 1801, at the age of nineteen. In this work he drew upon over twenty-five major Chinese and Japanese sources, some of which were translations of Jesuit works, and many of which bakufu censorship had made inaccessible to the general Tokugawa readership. That Aizawa examined proscribed reading material suggests that he entertained real concern over Russian incursions and that he felt compelled to study conditions in Europe. 

58 

Chishima ibun begins with a brief historical outline of Ezo and of Japanese contacts with neighboring territories in ancient times. Aizawa explained the geographic features of the area and gave an account of Japanese military triumphs and glories there. In antiquity, Imperial Prince Yamato Takeru and other heroes such as Abe no Hirafu and Regent Jingū had extended Japan's frontiers through brilliant campaigns. The Kuriles as well as the Three Kingdoms of Korea, Siberia, and Manchuria on the Asian mainland, had all sent tribute-bearing ambassadors to the imperial court, thereby showing their submission to imperial virtue. In short, Japan then stood in a position comparable to China's at the apex of the world order as Middle Kingdom Civilization. But for reasons unexplained by Aizawa, Japanese dynastic prestige in later ages plummeted so much that foreign barbarians withheld their tribute-bearing ambassadors and ceased coming to Japan in search of moral transformation. What was worse, those same barbarians grew strong and impudent enough to assault Japan. First, the Jurchen attacked during the reign of Emperor Goichijo (r. 1016-35), and the Mongols invaded two centuries later. On the latter occasion, Emperor Kameyama's prayers and Hōjō Tokimune's measures for joi produced the divine wind that saved Japan from destruction. Aizawa noted that shortly after Hideyoshi's brief period of glory on the 

77 

Knowledge and Hatred of the West 

tion in China, and Russian barbarians took over all parts of Ezo mainland, Manchu barbarians overran Middle Kingdom Civiliza- 

except the domain of Matsumae. 59 

After presenting this brief historical background, Aizawa asserted that people living in northeastern Japan and on the Japan Sea coast should not be ignorant of events on the contineed to know about affairs on the Asian mainland was now nent because "we are separated by but a strip of water."60 This more urgent than ever due to the rise of Russia-a great power expanding eastward with frightful speed, and believed to be har boring designs on the Japanese portion of Ezo. On this note, Aizawa began his description of Russian strength and analyzed 

its sources. 

Russia began its eastward advance in the seventeenth century. It had not chosen that direction voluntarily, for a number of strong powers in Europe and in the south thwarted Russia's ambitions on these fronts. Consequently, Russia opted to acquire the less lucrative, but easy-to-conquer, sparsely-populated territories in Asia as a first step to self-strengthening and enrichment. This eastward expansion inevitably brought Russia into conflict with Ch'ing dynasty China. It also forced Russia to construct border fortresses and to dig canals and build roads in order to improve Russia's military transport system. As a result, Russia had come to lie much closer to China. Aizawa displayed his cognizance of a shrinking world by observing, "Whereas it used to take six years to reach China from Moscow, it now requires but four months."61 

Later conquests brought Russia, which had grown to be a European colossus, even closer to Japan. This aroused in Aizawa a gripping sense of imminent danger. Russia's subjugation of the greater part of Kamchatka in 1698 clearly evoked irredentist sentiments in him: "According to Honda Toshiaki, Kamchatka was formerly part of Ezo, and as such, should be under Matsumae control. But we have been ignorant of this for more than a hundred years since that territory was stolen from us. 

,962 Aizawa 

noted with alarm that the Russians were building forts and trading-posts in their newly acquired areas, and that from these bases, they were converting the natives to Russian manners 

78 

Threat from the North 

and customs. He had this to say about their settlement of 

Siberia: 

When the Russian barbarians took over Siberia, it was a vast wasteland with few inhabitants. That is why they settled many people there and turned the area into a prosperous territory. One of the keys to their success in this undertaking was the large numbers of prisoners they dispatched to Siberia as settlers. 63 

We should note that thirty years later Tokugawa Nariaki would propose the same tactic as part of a bold scheme for Mito to acquire and develop Ezo[^64] (After the Restoration, the Meiji government actually implemented this plan in Hokkaido.) 65 

Aizawa stated that "in 1624, a 'Captain X' was the first Russian explorer to make his way to the islands near Kamchatka and give them Russian names," and that "in 1729, Captain Bering arrived in St. Lawrence."66 It piqued Aizawa to learn that "according to Kondo Jūzō, the Russians called themselves 'men from the Land of the Rising Sun"" in an effort to awe the simple-minded natives into submission. 67 Aizawa described how Russian conquests continued under "Captains Chirikov and Spanberg," until "North America and Sakhalin came under Russian control." He declared that "all their undertakings are turning out exactly as they wish." Guided by the "detailed map of Siberia that they recently drew up," they were digging canals in all parts of the region to facilitate transportation and communications. 

Aizawa had discovered that Russia's trading activities were bringing prosperity to Siberia. With the wealth thus gained, the Russians were "building military academies and institutions of higher education for the sons of nobles" and "primary schools" ostensibly to instruct the children of commoners. Aizawa complained that Russian leaders were building forts and trading-posts in Japan's former territory of Kamchatka as well. The Russians were "transforming the natives culturally so that they would follow Russian manners and customs." He cited Kudo Heisuke to the effect that "by 1730, the natives in Kamchatka were paying tribute to Russia." 9968 

79 

Knowledge and Hatred of the West 

"As early as 1735-38, Russia's Queen Anna," Aizawa asserted, "had had her eye on the Ch'ing empire and Japan." At that time, however, she was directing her main efforts to the south and west. Therefore, Russia's policy was to use trade as a means of reconnaissance, "to see if these two Asian nations were strong or weak." In 1739, for example, 

Foreign ships came to Mutsu and Awa, and after giving pieces of silver to people on shore, went on their way. When questioned about this affair, the Dutch in Nagasaki replied that this ship was a Russian vessel that had departed from Muscovy the previous year. 

Having read a translated Western work entitled Barbarian Gazetteer (Teki shi), Aizawa related with great alarm: 

Russia does not seem to have annexed the Ezo Islands until that time [1741]. But now [in 1801], the only islands left to us are Kunashiri, Etorofu, and Karafuto [Sakhalin]. All the rest were snatched away before we knew what was happening. Teki shi lists the Ezo Islands (which the Russians claim), and ends the account saying, "the large southern-most island in the Ezo Archipelago is called 'Matsumae'." This means they think they already own the island containing Matsumae! 70 

Aizawa thought that Russia considered itself the owner of what today is Hokkaidō. 

According to the reports of Kondo Juzo and Kimura Ken, Japanese castaways landing on Siberian and Kamchatkan shores received cordial treatment. Aizawa believed that the Russian government welcomed them by awarding them lucrative teaching positions in the state-sponsored language school. 71 Furthermore, he discovered that those castaways assumed Russian names, married Russian women, and adopted Russian customs in general. In short, they were transformed to follow Russian ways. With the aid of these teachers, the Russians "learned to read Japanese kana." They "found out all they wanted to know about Japan's geography and climate, and about our people and customs." From Kondo, Aizawa learned to his horror that "because of such castaways, Kaempfer's book 72 could be written," 

80Threat from the North 

a book "containing a large detailed map of Japan showing the locations of castles and the deployment of all daimyo throughout the country. 

ge 

73 

From the Chinese work, Hsi-yü wen-chien lu (Records of things seen and heard in the West), 74 Aizawa learned that in 1735 Russia had stopped paying tribute to its overlord, a country called "K'ung-ge erh," 75 which Aizawa incorrectly supposed to be the Holy Roman Empire. Aizawa believed that this "K'ungerh" was a small, weak power. But because it was the spiritual head of Europe's ruling houses, he presumed, all of them pledged fealty to it and were united to smite any enemy who might dare oppose it. Aizawa reasoned that this position was somewhat like that of the Chou House in China's feudal period. 76 Due to that breach of loyalty, full-scale war broke out between Russia and an allied army of federated European states under K'ung-ge erh hegemony. 

In 1770, Russia took a sound drubbing during this conflict. It lost "two hundred thousand men and suffered invasion by hundreds of thousands of foreign troops."77 Under such circumstances, its plans for expansion received a serious setback. Russia had to seek peace and reaffirm fealty to K'ung-ge erh by again pledging to pay the yearly tribute it had discontinued in 1755. What is crucial to note is Aizawa's assumption that Russia's drive westward was stopped abruptly and with staggering losses by 1770, and that in addition, the country was burdened with huge war indemnities. For these reasons, Aizawa concluded, Russia would expand toward eastern Asia in the future, as it had done earlier in history. 78 It would seek territory and booty in the east to pay off war reparations. 

Aizawa described the Beyowsky affair 79 of 1771 as Russia's first step toward conquering Asia. He quoted Mogami Tokunai to the effect that Benyowsky surveyed Japan's coast in command of three ships, and that he carried a map of the Orient showing Japan in detail. 80 From another of Honda's works, however, Aizawa was heartened to learn that although the Russians claimed Ezo for themselves, the natives there still considered the Matsumae clan their kamoidono, a corruption of the Japanese word for "divine lord."81 Nevertheless, Russian fishermen 

81 

Knowledge and Hatred of the West 

and trappers came to the Ezo Island of Uruppu in 1772 to fish and obtain otter skins, and Honda reported that by this time all islands as far south as Shimoshiri were really under Russian control. This prompted Aizawa to resolve, "We must take Karafuto [Sakhalin] before they do!" 82 

Regarding otter skins, Aizawa first quoted from Mogami Tokunai's Ezo sōshi: "Otter skins are a special product of our Divine Realm and are trade-items shipped to China through Nagasaki. Recently the Russian barbarians have been marketing these skins directly to Peking...." Then he commented: "If this is true, the whole world probably thinks that Russia has snatched away our vassal state of Ezo, where we obtain this item."83 This passage reveals that in 1801 Aizawa did not oppose trade as being contrary to hallowed bakufu laws; he implicitly supported it assuming that it be conducted under strict bakufu control. 

Aizawa then noted that a Russian named Ishiyuyo first appeared on Uruppu Island in 1780, and he observed: 

Kondō Jūzō writes, "The Russians subjugated Shimoshiri a mere thirty years ago but the inhabitants' manners and customs were thoroughly transformed to those of Russia within ten years. The natives, both men and women, adopted Russian hairstyles, began to wear hats and shoes, started to carry rifles and gunpowder, learned to speak Russian, and took up the practice of dangling Russian Buddhas from their necks." 

The Russians periodically dispatch officials and priests to the various Ezo Islands to collect taxes and to instill affection and submissiveness in the natives. This Ishiyuyo later would employ Christianity to seduce the inhabitants of Etorofu into submission. From this fact we can assume that he was the scoundrel who transformed Shimoshiri to Russian customs as well. 84 

Next, Aizawa presented an account of Ishiyuyo's method of operation as reported by Kondo: 

82 

In 1785, three Russians including Ishiyuyo landed on Etorofu. They erected a Cross and taught the natives their cult's magic 

Threat from the North 

sign. A certain native named Haushise became especially close to the [Russian] barbarians, grew his hair long, and took on other Russian customs. Later, Kondo Juzo questioned him, and he said, "When the Russians gave us images of their Buddha and taught us their magic sign, they told us, 'If you believe in this image, your catches of fish will always be bountiful, your boats will never be shipwrecked, and your prayers will all be answered.""[^85] 

In addition, the Russians handed out sake and mochi (which Kondo mistook for wine and bread 86) to the primitive natives. By bartering such luxury items, and more importantly, by dispensing a religion promising happiness and well-being in this world, the Russians captured Ezo. They "transformed" the folkways and won the allegiance of the simple-minded inhabitants at little cost to themselves. 

Aizawa was not alone in his opinions. The Rangakusha, Ōtsuki Gentaku, also cited the account by Kondo Jūzō and commented: 

They erect Crosses, teach their religion, and give Buddhas to the barbarian-natives. Thus they have come close to transforming fully the natives' folkways. . . . I am overwhelmed by the astuteness of Hayashi [Shihei]'s foresight: Over twenty years ago he predicted this would happen. 

After some prodding, Aizawa noted, Kondo got the "deceitful Ishiyuyo" to reveal his true motives for coming to Ezo. Aizawa paraphrased Kondo's remarks: 

Ever since the time of their King Peter, [the Russians] have been annexing territories and appointing military governors to rule these. In order to acquire all of Ezo, they first wanted to employ trade as a pretext for surveying conditions there and determining whether an immediate takeover was possible. That was their motive for wanting to establish trade relations with the bakufu, and this is why they minutely survey the geography of our Divine Realm. 88 

In Chishima ibun, Aizawa implied that one main source of Russian strength lay in the ability, resourcefulness, and energy 

83 

Knowledge and Hatred of the West 

of Peter the Great. It was Peter who first "unified the formerly independent Red, White, and Black states of Russia into a single nation,' 

"89 Aizawa observed. Russia's rise to become a great power stemmed from Peter's assiduously executed reforms: 

He devoted all his energies to stabilizing the people's livelihoods and enriching the nation. He achieved great things indeed. He planted vineyards and orchards to secure a sufficient supply of food for his people. He established schools to propagate the official religion. He drilled Russia's army, and with it, struck terror in the hearts of Russia's foes[^90] 

This view of Peter as a heroic reformer, and of Russia's methods for territorial aggrandizement, certainly distressed Aizawa. Peter emerges as a benevolent and dedicated "ruler-edifer," who, after ensuring his people's livelihood, elevated their morals, spiritually unified them, and imbued them with a sense of reverence toward himself. 

Russia did not absorb foreign nations and peoples through military conquest and harsh subjugation; it did so peacefully, by transforming manners and customs to Russian ways. Through such voluntary "transformation," the natives in annexed lands received the material benefits of civilized life: food, clothing, advanced technology, and firearms. Equally important, they obtained spiritual strength through Christianity, which guaranteed the fulfillment of their desires for gain in this world. As a result, they could not help feeling spontaneous affection for, and allegiance toward, their new Russian masters. 

Peter had recognized Russia's backwardness and its need to learn from the West. For that reason, Aizawa noted, he dispatched students abroad to learn skills and to investigate conditions in Europe. "With the wealth he obtained through trade with Britain, Holland, and the Ch'ing empire," Aizawa observed, Peter "bought books on law, science, religion, mathematics, and astronomy" from advanced European countries, and he founded "great centers of learning in Moscow and St. Petersburg." Aizawa praised the capital's splendor and strength as a fortress, and he outlined Peter's educational achievements. He even noted the number of rubles that Russia expended 

84 

Threat from the North 

annually for education and the number of volumes stocked in Russian university libraries. 91 

Peter updated, strengthened, and enlarged Russia's armed forces. By studying European techniques of navigation and by building scores of warships, he created a Russian navy that grew to become the world's most powerful, or so Aizawa believed. What probably impressed Aizawa most was Peter's personal involvement and total commitment to the goal of national wealth and strength. Peter was not satisfied with importing books and hiring foreign teachers; "he personally went to the West disguised as a workman to master the techniques of building large ships. 

92 

Thus, the nineteen-year-old Aizawa's survey of Russian affairs told him that with proper leadership, even a divided, weak, subvassal state, a state by no means blessed with good climate and geography, could develop into a leading world power. Let us further analyze the reasons for Russia's phenomenal growth as Aizawa perceived them. 

To begin with, Russia's leaders from the early seventeenth century possessed certain fixed, long-range objectives: the attainment of national unity, the securing of popular allegiance, the creation of wealth and strength for the state, and territorial expansion. In pursuing these objectives, Russian leaders were beset by sudden reversals and unexpected obstacles. But they, and especially Peter, pursued their long-range goals with flexibility. Though adhering to fixed objectives, they adjusted themselves to world conditions, a dexterity that they demonstrated, for example, by expanding to the east when frustrated in the west. Second, though barbarians, the Russians recognized the need to learn advanced techniques from Europe in order to realize their long-range objectives. Finally, though barbarians, their leaders had achieved a level of cultural development that allowed them to invent an efficacious Way for achieving unity at home and expediting expansion abroad. The above conclusions, the fruit of Aizawa's Western Learning, can be culled from Chishima ibun and would be woven into his opus, New Theses, twentyfour years later. 

We cannot justifiably accuse Aizawa of ignoring Japan's need 

85 

Knowledge and Hatred of the West 

to obtain and assimilate knowledge about the outside world. His prime concern in 1801 was Japan's insufficient knowledge of world affairs, or as Ōhara Sakingo put it, "They know more about us than we do about them."93 Aizawa sought to learn about conditions in the West and to place this knowledge at bakufu disposal. This is why he composed New Theses and sought to submit it to bakufu senior councilors in 1825. 

THE THREAT FROM THE SOUTH: SPAIN AND (NEW) ENGLAND The bakufu's successful settlement of the Takadaya-Golovnin Incident in 181394 lent credence to the hard-line approach to foreign affairs conceptualized as joi. After exchanging prisoners, the bakufu delivered a memorandum to the Russian negotiators. It read in part: 

Our nation's laws prohibit the establishment of any new trade or diplomatic relations with foreign countries. . . . Our officials are instructed to fire on and drive off (uchiharau) any foreign ship approaching Japan proper and the Ezo Islands. There will be no change in this [policy][^95] 

On top of that, the Russians were informed: 

It is a national law that any foreign ship not calling at Nagasaki will be driven off (uchiharau). Christianity is strictly prohibited. Anyone disseminating it among Japanese people is subject to the ultimate punishment[^96] 

The Russians accepted these stipulations without qualms; 1813 marked the end of Russian requests for trade until mid-century. Aizawa, then, had cause to believe that a proclamation banning trade and Christianity, coupled with the threat of force, persuaded unwanted intruders to stay away. So he adopted this militant stance against British and American merchant ships and whalers, which appeared from the south in great numbers during the 1810s, and 1820s. 

At some time during these years Aizawa read Arai Hakuseki's Seiyō kibun, which together with his earlier study of conditions in Russia, was instrumental in reshaping his world view. 97 Then 

86 

Threat from the South 

in the summer of 1824, his interest in the world outside Japan received a jolting new stimulus when a fleet of foreign whalers approached the Mito coast at Ōtsuhama and twelve crewmen came ashore[^98] These foreigners were promptly apprehended, and the domain government dispatched Aizawa and Tobita Shiken, another of Yukoku's students, to question the intruders about their motives for landing. Aizawa had five days alone with the prisoners before the arrival of the bakufu official, Koyama Zenkichi, and his two interpreters, Takahashi Kageyasu and Yoshio Chūjirō. 

Aizawa's An'i mondo is an account of his encounters with the captain of the captured foreign crewmen. He later submitted this document to domain authorities. 99 Its main portion records the questions and answers he exchanged with the prisoners. The appendix, "Bemmo" (Exposing foolish fancies), is as the title indicates, Aizawa's exposé of the wishful thinking indulged in by domain and bakufu officials about the foreigners' true motives. Although he wrote that his sessions with the prisoners "did not allow me to obtain detailed information on foreign affairs," Aizawa was sure that he "did discover the general outlines of recent world events." 100 In a separate memorial to the daimyo, Fujita Yukoku was even more enthusiastic about Aizawa's performance, calling it "an achievement unmatched since Arai [Hakuseki]'s interrogation of the Roman [Sidotti]."' That was more than slightly exaggerated praise. 

"100 

Let us examine An'i mondo closely, since it tells us what additional knowledge of world affairs Aizawa acquired between 1801 and 1824. The first problem he faced in interrogating the prisoners was communication, a problem compounded by his ignorance of their true nationality. Aizawa arrived at the scene believing that the intruders were from Russia, and came prepared to question them in Russian. 102 He brought along a notebook in which he had jotted down a few Russian words mastered from earlier reading about the West. He also brought reference works, including a map of the world and Katsuragawa Hoshu's Bankoku kōkai hyōkizu (Navigation-flags of the world). 103 

Upon discovering that their leader, "Captain Gibson," could read neither Chinese ideographs nor Japanese kana, Aizawa 

87 

Knowledge and Hatred of the West 

wrote the word "Russia" in Russian script. Gibson, however, responded by writing Arabic numerals and the word "England" in the English alphabet. Aizawa, who believed that all Western languages were phonetically related, pronounced these numerals and letters "according to Dutch pronunciation."104 It is highly unlikely that Aizawa's knowledge of any European language was more than paltry. Even so, his language ability, meager as is must have been, coupled with his earlier reading in Western Learning, helps explain why the domain selected him to conduct these interrogations. 

Through written notes, facial expressions, gestures, the drawing of pictures, and the services of a local jailer who had acquired a smattering of conversational English (and would later be punished for it), Aizawa obtained bits and pieces of not wholly inaccurate information on contemporary world affairs and new national boundaries. His main objectives, however, were to find out why this party of foreigners had come to Japan and to investigate what they had been doing on shore before they were apprehended. Gibson claimed that the original fleet to which he belonged numbered thirty-five ships and that they had set sail from their home port thirty-two months earlier. When Aizawa inquired why they had come to Japan, Gibson replied that his particular detachment of ships came in search of whales. But on the following day, when Aizawa spread a map of the world in front of Gibson and repeated this query, a crewman named Middleton engaged Captain Gibson in heated debate. According to Aizawa, 

The second man [Middleton] walked over to the map, placed his hand on our Divine Realm, and repeatedly drew it in a sweeping motion straight toward England as if to say, "We will make the Divine Land, too, into an English colony."105 Then Aizawa was quick to add, 

88 

I was not the only one who interpreted his action in this way; everyone present thought so. Then, on the next day when I repeated my question, Gibson drew a picture of a whale and said they had come for whales. This plainly was an attempt to cover up the truth that came to light the day before. 106 

Threat from the South 

In their memorials to the domain, Yukoku and Aizawa sought to convince doubting officials that foreigners were by nature deceptive and cunning, that they posed a dire threat to Japan's existence. Yet behind this outlandish interpretation of the Englishman's hand-sweeping, there was more than an irrational hatred of foreigners. To Aizawa, foreigners did pose a threat to Japan, as the following two pieces of misinformation gained from Gibson show. The first was about an island called "Naideshikoetsu," which Aizawa imagined to lie north of the Ogasawaras, due east of the Mito coast. Aizawa lamented that "Gibson, a foreigner, considers this island part of Japan, but our own people do not even know it exists!"107 Second, Aizawa learned from Gibson that the Spanish were exploiting a "Marabariko Island" (also unidentifiable), which Hakuseki's Seiyo kibun reported to lie due south of the Ogasawaras and to be rich in gold and silver. 108 These two bits of misinformation obtained through interrogations heightened his anxiety over European colonization near Japan. He concluded that Japan was caught in a pincer movement between Russia from the north and England and Spain from the south: 

England, Russia's ally, has annexed both ends of the African continent and has settled and developed India. Even nearer to Japan, Russia's comrade, Spain, has already devoured most of the Ogasawara Islands to the south; so this territory is in effect an English colony. From these advanced bases, the British ply between points throughout the Far East: We must think of them as being right on our border. Their ships anchor in Far Eastern waters, and on one pretext or another, they seize every opportunity to become friendly with our people, to draw maps, to measure the ocean's depths off our coasts, to land on our shores, in short, to probe our defenses. 109 

The fear that European powers other than Russia also were closing in on Japan by colonizing territories and assimilating peoples nearby was very real to Aizawa. It was all the more gripping because of the particular tactics he believed they were using: 

89 

Knowledge and Hatred of the West 

They now endeavor to annex all nations in the world. The wicked doctrine of Jesus is an aid in this endeavor. Under the pretext of trade or whatever, they approach and become friendly with peoples in all areas, secretly probing to see which countries are strong and which weak. If a nation's defenses are weak, they will seize it by force, but if there are no weaknesses to pounce on, they take it over by leading the people's minds astray with their wicked doctrine [of Christianity]. In this manner the Westerners have acquired many, many colonies located thousands of miles across the sea from their homelands. 110 

In An'i mondo, Aizawa asserted that neither Gibson's statements nor the fanciful thinking of bakufu officials should be taken seriously. He refused to view the Ōtsuhama Incident as an isolated act; he saw it as the last in a series of illegal English intrusions into Japanese territorial waters that included the Phaeton Incident of 1808 (described below), and also the Brothers Incident of 1818 at Uraga, in which "Christian books" translated into classical Chinese were distributed to Japanese looking on from shore. 111 As Shinobu Seizaburo has noted, Aizawa did not perceive Gibson to be an individual, a lone whaler who happened to be English. 112 Instead, he saw Gibson as part of an English nation. Gibson's lies must not be believed: 

Even if we were to give him the benefit of the doubt [as an individual], they [the English as a whole] have been probing our coasts for decades now. At one time they bribed the Hollanders to allow their ships to call and dock at Nagasaki under false pretenses [of being Dutch vessels]. They forced their way into Nagasaki Bay, wreaked havoc and caused the death of a bakufu magistrate there. 113 

Here we see Aizawa's grounds for regarding English requests for water, provisions, and firewood to be a form of reconnaissance, the prelude to attack or subversion. 

Such suspicions were not peculiar to Aizawa. Seventeen years earlier the Dutch Studies expert, Ōtsuki Gentaku, had expressed bitter resentment over the activities of the Westerners in Japanese 

90Threat from the South 

waters. Ōtsuki cast a jaundiced eye upon what he considered deceitful trading practices perpetrated by New England merchantship captains in violation of bakufu law from 1797 to 1807[^114] Gentaku also linked these violations to the Phaeton Incident of 1808. By placing these events in historical context, we can understand the suspicions raised by both Japanese thinkers. 

Holland suffered revolution and an invasion by the French in 1794-95, and this gave birth to a Batavian Republic forced into a wartime coalition with France against England. Therefore, Dutch shipping and colonial outposts, including Dejima, became fair game 

for British men-of-war. By the late eighteenth century, the naval supremacy that Holland had enjoyed in the Far East was over, and this Dutch weakness exposed Japan to visits by other Western nations who sought trade or territorial concessions. Holland's maritime power atrophied so much that Dutch East India Company officials had to charter foreign vessels to maintain their trade with Japan. Of the twenty-two merchant ships flying the Dutch flag that called at Nagasaki between 1797 and 1817, eight were Dutch and nine were American. 115 Of the remaining five privately owned vessels hired by the Dutch, three were British, one was Danish, and one was from Bremen. In addition, American ships not chartered by the Dutch made four visits to Nagasaki, which brings to thirteen the number of American visits to Japan during this twenty-one year period between 1797 and 1817. In 1803, one American skipper, Captain William Robert Stewart, requested permission to trade with Japan, not as a hired agent of the Dutch, but as a private American citizen half a century before Perry. 

Dutch officials on Dejima were unwilling to disclose information about conditions in Europe or wartime developments that might lead to an abrogation of their trading privileges or endanger their very existence in Japan. Holland itself was incorporated into the French Empire in 1810. Its last colonial holding, Java (under whose jurisdiction Dejima lay), fell to British armed forces in September of 1811. From then until August of 1816, when the British returned most of their captured former Dutch possessions to the newly reinstated Dutch monarch, Dejima was the only spot on earth where the tri-color 

91 

Knowledge and Hatred of the West 

royal Dutch flag flew. 116 It is no wonder that news of America's War of Independence, the French Revolution, the Napoleonic Wars, and other information harmful to Dutch interests went unreported or was misrepresented in the official reports submitted to the bakufu. 117 

Ōtsuki Gentaku, however, had access to more accurate information through his contacts with bakufu interpreters in Nagasaki and through his interrogations of Tsudayū, a Japanese castaway whom Rezanov returned to Sendai domain (where Ōtsuki was serving) in 1804[^118] In 1807, one year before the Phaeton Incident, Ōtsuki wrote Book One of Hoei mondo. In it, he discussed the problem of American ships calling at Nagasaki in Dutch employ. Ōtsuki knew that "New England" was a British colony in North America, but he did not know that the Americans had formed an independent nation in 1783. Because the ships calling at Nagasaki were registered in places like "Providence" or "Boston new [sic] England," he concluded that the so-called "American" ships regularly putting into Nagasaki Harbor were really English. 119 Moreover, Ōtsuki had learned about the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars from Tsudayu. He had discovered that the King of Holland had fled to England in the wake of "great civil disorder"-revolution and invasion from 1794 to 1795-in his own land. 120 Ōtsuki reasoned that the British were forcing the vanquished Dutchmen in Nagasaki to falsify the identity of those ships calling there under the Dutch flag. In other words, he believed that these vessels really were (New) English, but that under duress, the Hollanders had to report them as their own. 

121 

Otsuki knew that English forces were capturing Dutch colonial outposts in other parts of the world, and assumed that they would try to take over Dejima also. 122 He suspected that these (New) English ships were on spy missions to prepare for such an assault. 123 Since Britain and Russia had allied against Holland in campaigns on the European continent before, he judged that these two powers might well ally again to seize the Dutchmonopolized markets in Japan by forcing trade agreements on Japan or even invading her. 124 

In the Phaeton Incident of 1808, British sailors had forcibly 

92 

Threat from the South 

abducted Dutch officials in the custody of the Nagasaki Magistrates. This violent act heightened Ōtsuki's suspicions, expressed in Book Two of Hoei mondo (1808). He was unconvinced by the Dutch explanation that a British warship, flying the Dutch flag, had forced its way into Nagasaki Harbor in search of Dutch ships to seize. Ōtsuki, the Dutch Studies expert, firmly believed that the Phaeton was in Japanese waters to spy for Britain's ally, Russia, 125 and urged that the incident be subjected to more rigorous scrutiny. 126 Clearly, then, a distrust of foreigners as deceitful and threatening was not limited to Mito xenophobes like Aizawa. Moreover, Japanese thinkers, whatever their scholarly affiliation, did have certain grounds for distrust. 

Throughout his life Aizawa believed that trade and Christianity were stratagems intended to facilitate a Western takeover. To understand fully the logic behind this belief, we must examine the Western knowledge Aizawa gained from Arai Hakuseki. 127 Aizawa was critical of Hakuseki's historiography and attitude toward Japan's imperial house. 128 But he lavished praise on Hakuseki for discerning Christianity's potential threat to Japan's social and political order. 129 Aizawa read Hakuseki's Seiyō kibun sometime between 1801 and 1824, and Sidotti's recorded statements in the work easily confirmed the fears about European expansion that Aizawa had gained from earlier readings on Russia. What follows is not a thoroughgoing exposition of Seiyo kibun. Instead, my aim is to present certain viewpoints or statements expressed by Sidotti and Hakuseki that exacerbated Aizawa's xenophobia. 

Many historians hold that Hakuseki's dissociation of Western arts and science from the "dangerous heresy" of Christianity greatly stimulated Japan's importation and assimilation of advanced technical knowledge from Europe. 130 Be that as it may, Hakuseki did not deny that Christianity was dangerous; he insisted that the bakufu should continue to proscribe it. 131 He held that Christianity was a doctrine unsuited to and incompatible with Tokugawa Japan's bakuhan state and social order. The fall of the Ming dynasty, he asserted, was due in no small part to its religious tolerance. 132 In opposition to Hakuseki, Sidotti argued that the Vatican was different from secular states such 

93 

Knowledge and Hatred of the West 

as Holland, Spain, or France; "Rome [the Vatican] has never conspired to annex an inch of foreign territory throughout its 1380 year history."133 Furthermore, Sidotti reported, "nations meet their ruin because of their rulers' mistakes, not because of "134 The rise and fall of regimes, and the any particular religion.' social stability or instability of nations, stemmed from purely political factors-their rulers' ability or incompetence. The religion and spiritual beliefs that their peoples embraced were of no consequence. Since state security and individual belief were separate things, religion posed no political danger. Japanese secular authorities, Sidotti said, should not outlaw his missionary activities. Sidotti went on to argue that when secular powers such as Spain and France did annex foreign nations, the conquered native peoples either lacked proper rulers due to their primitiveness, or else were so embroiled in political turmoil and warfare that existing rulers had lost popular support. 

135 Since neither situation was true in Japan's case, Sidotti concluded, there was no reason to ban his proselytizing. 

Despite genuine sympathy for Sidotti's plight, Hakuseki replied that tolerating Christianity would "naturally and inevitably lead to subversion from within," 136 even though Sidotti himself did not desire such results. The existing polity rested on the moral absolutes of "loyalty of retainer for ruler and filial devotion of child for parent." Any belief in a transcendent Creator necessarily would lead retainers and sons to "slight ruler and parent. "137 That would constitute "heresy" in the Mencian sense, and would undermine the value system supporting the Tokugawa bakuhan state. Hakuseki's attitude can be conceptualized abstractly as a form of cultural joi: eradicating what is barbarian to prevent the transformation of civilized customs within Japan. 

138 

But more important to this discussion is the rightness of a state-instituted orthodoxy that Hakuseki hinted at. This was a potent legacy not only to Aizawa, but also to most later Japanese thinkers, for it denied the principle of the individual's religious or spiritual autonomy. If state authority is to uphold political stability at home and territorial integrity against foreign nations, Hakuseki implied, it must have the authority to 

94 

Threat from the South 

control the people's spiritual and religious lives. It also must be free to propagate any set of beliefs or values best-suited to its socio-political structure and to exclude any doctrines that might prove harmful. 

A second point in Seiyō kibun that undoubtedly caught Aizawa's attention was that Western missionaries had been thoroughly trained in languages and familiarized with local cultures before arriving in the Far East. Sidotti had already studied Japanese for three years in Rome; then he received further schooling in Japanese language, manners, and customs from Japanese nationals on Luzon. 139 Moreover, Sidotti carried with him a book 140 This indicated to on Japan written in a foreign language. Aizawa that Europeans were compiling and disseminating information on Japan among themselves. 

Third, Hakuseki related that Western missionaries recruited native Asians to assist in proselytizing. When Hakuseki questioned Sidotti about Li Ma-tou, Matteo Ricci's Chinese name, Sidotti replied that he knew nothing about the man. This answer raised suspicions in Hakuseki's mind. 141 Hakuseki mistakenly believed that Li Ma-tou was born in Kwangtung Province, that he was a Chinese national educated in Christendom and sent back to China to win converts for the Church among his countrymen. "According to a certain Dutchman," Hakuseki 

wrote: 

The foreign missionaries look for bright little children in the lands where they proselytize, round them up, and send them to Europe for education in Christianity. When this education is completed and the children are grown up, they are returned to their homelands to preach the Gospel. In this way, the undiscriminating and less intelligent among the native populations are converted. 142 

The fourth and most upsetting piece of information that Aizawa gained from Seiyō kibun concerned the non-aggressive manner in which European rulers annexed foreign lands, a manner all too similar to the Way of the ancient sage kings. European rulers bestowed the fruits of their advanced civilization on primitive peoples and thereby induced them to submit voluntarily. 

95 

Knowledge and Hatred of the West 

In describing how Spain and France "annexed and colonized foreign countries," Sidotti related through Hakuseki that in the territory called "New Spain," "the inhabitants had no ruler to maintain order," "the weak fell prey to the strong," and "people ate the flesh of corpses."143 On Luzon as well, "the inhabitants were living in nakedness... not far from beasthood" until the Spanish came. 

The Spanish taught the natives how to grow food and sew clothes, saw to it that goods and commodities circulated throughout the territory; then they led the natives along the proper Way through Christianity. Thus, for the first time ever, the natives could enjoy security of livelihood. That is why they gladly submitted to the Spaniards. Before long, they even asked to have their land incorporated into the Spanish Empire so that they might enjoy the blessings of direct rule by the King of Spain. 

144 

Despite its historical inaccuracy, this portrayal of Spanish missionary activities presented by Hakuseki, based on what he learned from Sidotti, matches to a tee the requirements that Yukoku and Aizawa used to define sagehood. Their definition (discussed in the next chapter) was to dispense the "Way of nourishing the people, eliminating hardship from their lives, and providing them with ethical instruction and spiritual fulfillment." 145 This meant that Spanish activities in the Philippines resembled the Confucian Way as Yukoku and Aizawa understood it. 146 

Finally, European rulers as described by Sidotti were farsighted and energetic, quite unlike faint-hearted Japanese such as Nakai Chikuzan, Nakai Riken, Yamagata Banto, and (initially) Matsudaira Sadanobu, who refused to take over Ezo. European leaders vigorously pushed through programs of overseas colonization despite protests lodged by petty, economy-minded advisors who doubted the profitability of such ventures. Most important, this far-sightedness and drive stemmed from the European rulers' faith in Christianity. Hakuseki quoted Sidotti: 

96 

Confucian World View 

One minister remonstrated with the Spanish king, "Isn't it better to ignore the requests of such natives [to be incorporated into the Spanish Empire]? We should forget about annexing their lands, which, after all, are thousands of miles away. To administer such lands would only strain our resources. 

But the king replied, "No. By making it possible for foreign peoples to enjoy economic security in life and to escape the sufferings of death, we can repay a large measure of God's blessings to us."147 

WESTERN LEARNING AND CONFUCIAN WORLD VIEW 

Aizawa learned about world geography, about how much of the globe Christianity and Islam controlled compared with Confucianism, and about the methods European rulers supposedly used to colonize foreign lands. This new Western knowledge destroyed the Sinocentric Middle Kingdom world view for him just as it had for Maeno Ryōtaku and Ōhara Sakingo. Aizawa could not remain sanguine about who represented civilization, and who, barbarism. 

At a basic, general level, Confucian political theory holds that a sage, or a True King, is one who conducts benevolent government in accordance with the Way, nurtures his people as a loving parent cares for his children, sees to it that their material needs in life are met, reassures them spiritually, and "transforms" them morally. 148 Such an ideal ruler theoretically did not need armed force to bring alien peoples under control: Barbarians submitted voluntarily. They eagerly "came to be transformed.' T'ang, virtuous founder of the Shang Dynasty, was such a True King. In describing T'ang's campaigns to "bring government to all under Heaven," Mencius wrote: 

In eleven expeditions he became matchless in the Empire. When he marched on the east, the Western Barbarians complained, and when he marched on the south, the Northern Barbarians complained. They all said, "Why does he not come 

97 

Knowledge and Hatred of the West 

as they 

to us first?" The people all longed for his coming as longed for rain in time of severe drought. 

Aizawa's Western Learning turned this scheme of affairs topsyturvey: Could it be that lowly Western barbarians had appropriated the Confucian Way and were using it to their own advantage? In antiquity, China under the former sage kings and Japan under its own former sage emperors had dominated the world spatially and demographically. This was because Chinese and Japanese sage rulers had implemented the Way for their peoples and extended it to barbarians. This idealized Sinocentric world view now was untenable. First, in terms of simple geographic extensiveness, the surface area of the Middle Kingdom (whether China or Japan) proportionate to the world as a whole shrank drastically. "All under Heaven" was not dominated by a Middle Kingdom in the center with barbarian peoples existing precariously along the fringes of the known world. Instead, Aizawa now realized, barbarian lands such as North and South America, Australia, Siberia, Africa, and the Middle East constituted a far greater portion of the earth's land mass and supported populations far larger than China and Japan. Second, these barbarian lands and peoples had come under the moral suasion of the Christian God or the Islamic Allah, not the Confucian sages, and much less Amaterasu. Worse still, as Chishima ibun reveals, Aizawa believed that large areas once under Japanese moral and cultural hegemony-Siberia, Manchuria, Kamchatka, Sakhalin, and the Kuriles, all of which he labeled "Ezo"-had succumbed to Russia through Christian "transformation." 

These upsetting realizations led to a bigoted reassertion of Japanese Confucian cultural superiority in the more vituperatively anti-foreign passages of New Theses. I believe that these discoveries impelled Aizawa to formulate his idea of kokutaithe spiritual unity and cohesion needed to make a territory and its inhabitants into a nation (discussed in the next chapter). Aizawa had to admit, even in spite of himself, that European leaders deserved respect. They had created a civilization and religion whose sphere of moral influence was much vaster than that of either the Ch'ing empire or Tokugawa Japan. 

98 

Confucian World View 

Furthermore, he could not deny that Amaterasu's sagely Way, Middle Kingdom Civilization, Japan's divine imperial house, and its kokutai-all of which had created spiritual solidarity and helped assimilate barbarian peoples during antiquity-had degenerated grievously by 1824. Aizawa addressed these gripping issues in New Theses, which he composed the following year.

[^97]: Aizawa and Yukoku specifically cite Hakuseki's name in reference to the Sidotti incident. In addition to mentioning Hakuseki's interrogation of Sidotti, Aizawa quoted the following passage (in single quotation marks) regarding "Marabariko Island" from Seiyo kibun in An'i mondo.[Hakuseki:] "... Mata Roson [Luzon] no chi ni hakugin ōku idenuru koto, mata 'waga kuni tōnan no kaitō yori kingin ōku idenuru wo Isupaniyajin no toriuru' koto nado iite... [Aizawa:] "Marabariko wa Ogasawaratō yori nampō e tsuranaritaru shotō no sōmei nari.

[^127]: As further evidence that Aizawa read Hakuseki's Seiyo kibun, note the following passage from An'i mondo, in which Aizawa asserted that Gibson refused to reveal his true identity as a Christian, and added, "Gibson's surname is John,' the name of one of Christ's disciples, which he has assumed for himself-a custom described in Arai's writings. Moreover, the fact that many believers in Christianity are named 'John' is another piece of evidence [to show he is a Christian]."

[^146]: Ibid. Bito stresses the reversal in emphasis from seitoku, which is traditionally placed ahead of riyo and kōsei, and argues that Yukoku and Aizawa viewed the latter two as being primary.

[^148]: Of course China's relationship to surrounding barbarians changed according to historical conditions-the relative strengths of Chinese and barbarian forces. Under the first Ming emperor, for example, China adopted a militant, expansionist policy. Under weaker dynasties such as the Sung, more emphasis was placed on "virtue" and non-military means of "transforming" barbarians. And under barbarian conquest dynasties such as the Yuan, Confucians were at a loss to explain why the reversal of "civilization" and "barbarism" had taken place. See Lien-sheng Yang, "Historical Notes of the Chinese World Order,” and Wang Gungwu, “Early Ming Relations with Southeast Asia: A Background Essay," pp. 20-62. For a revisionist critique of Fairbank, see the essays in Morris Rossabi, ed., China Among Equals.
