  <p>In 1855, Ikebe Tōzaemon, a samurai from Yanagawa domain, shrewdly appraised the political position held by Tokugawa Nariaki, former daimyo of Mito and the then advisor to the bakufu on coastal defenses. Nariaki had been an avid exponent of joi since 1825.</p>
<p>He advanced such views before anyone else in the realm; [now] he cannot bring himself to act on them. You might say he has climbed to the peak of a steep mountain. He cannot go up any further, but he cannot back down either. 1</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Ikebe detected a disparity between rhetoric and reality. With the coming of Commodore Matthew C. Perry&rsquo;s steam-powered warships in 1853, the Mito slogan of joi, or armed expulsion, lost much of its former appeal. The measure that Nariaki had clamored about for thirty years was now plainly unworkable.</p>
<p>Awkwardly perched atop his mountain peak, Nariaki conceded that much. In a reply to Abe Masahiro&rsquo;s call for advice on how to deal with Perry&rsquo;s demands and armed threats, he wrote, &ldquo;Driving away the barbarians might not be such a good idea now.&ldquo;2 In explaining this tactical about-face to his trusted retainers, Fujita Toko and Toda Tadaakira, Nariaki meekly</p>
<p>confided:</p>
<p>When Westerners came in the past, they never intended to start a war. When we fired on them [as ordered in 1825], they would in fact go away. But now they come spoiling for a fight; they are waiting for us to attack. If we do, we will just be playing into their hands. 3</p>
<p>135</p>
<p>Epilogue</p>
<p>By 1853, Nariaki had come to realize that attacking Westerners gave them an excuse to invade Japan or extort concessions-and that &ldquo;might not be such a good idea.&rdquo; Unlike earlier Western solicitors knocking on Japan&rsquo;s door, Perry was ready to exploit such an excuse. In 1853 he came fully determined and fully able to make the bakufu do what he wanted: revoke its policy of national isolation. Thereafter, Nariaki clung to sakoku and joi more from obstinate pride than conviction.</p>
<p>The rhetoric of national isolation and armed expulsion emerged in the era 1793 to 1825. It remained cogent until 1853 because, as Nariaki pointed out, Westerners did in fact go away when fired on. In 1844, for example, Fujita Toko quoted Nariaki&rsquo;s statement that &ldquo;the barbarian presence in our seas is hateful, but not a grave menace.&ldquo;4 Perry&rsquo;s arrival in 1853, however, presented Japan with a real military crisis. For the first time in Tokugawa history, a foreign power defied bakufu-dictated rules governing Japan&rsquo;s relations with the rest of the world; and armed expulsion gave way to realpolitik. Mito ideologues and Japanese leaders had to stop fancying their nation as Middle Kingdom Civilization. They had to repudiate a state policy of expelling Western &ldquo;barbarians&rdquo; by force, and open Japan to trade and diplomacy under rules imposed by the West. The alternative was to suffer colonization.</p>
<p>The class-bound form of sonno, or &ldquo;revering the emperor,&rdquo; peculiar to Aizawa and Mito Learning also lost cogency after the 1850s<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Aizawa&rsquo;s intention was that bakufu leaders utilize the emperor in Kyoto to perform religious rituals as an integral part of government. He believed that these ritual acts would inspire the people&rsquo;s reverent submission in peacetime and their active loyalty in wartime. When he wrote New Theses in 1825, Aizawa assumed that Japan would remain at peace, that foreigners could never mobilize enough military strength to threaten or humiliate the bakufu, whose legitimacy had come to rest on an ability to expel Westerners by force. But in the 1850s and 1860s, the bakufu was indeed so threatened and humiliated. Western powers coerced Edo leaders into signing treaties that opened the Divine Realm to trade and permanent foreign residence; this violated a &ldquo;hallowed&rdquo; national law that the emperor</p>
<p>136</p>
<p>Looking Ahead</p>
<p>himself sanctioned. In the course of diplomatic wranglings over treaty ratification, both Japanese and Western negotiators realized the need for an ultimate source of political authority in Japan whose commands would be obeyed. This brought to a head the issue of where actual sovereign power lay: with the court or the bakufu. Politically active Japanese had to choose whether to obey the emperor, who ordered Westerners expelled from Japan, or the shogun, who had let them in under duress. In either case, Western military pressures-unforeseeable in 1825-now foiled Aizawa&rsquo;s original plan for the emperor&rsquo;s spiritual authority to reinforce bakufu secular authority.</p>
<p>After the late 1850s, knowledgeable men such as Tokugawa Nariaki and Aizawa Seishisai discarded the rhetoric of expulsion, but rank-and-file shishi continued to accept it at face value. Aizawa wrote New Theses in 1825 to shore up bakufu prestige and authority, but after 1853, the tract roused shishi to flout that authority. By 1860, Aizawa discovered to his horror that slogans he had endorsed in New Theses now were being used to justify insurgency: &ldquo;I understand [the rebels at] Nagaoka proclaim that their actions are to revere the emperor&rsquo; and &rsquo;expel the barbarians.&rsquo; But in truth they twist the meaning of those words to suit their own purposes.&rdquo; And in 1862, a year before his death, Aizawa was obliged to advocate opening Japan to Western trade and diplomatic intercourse. His ideas of armed expulsion and reverence for the emperor-in their particular forms expounded in New Theses-suffered repudiation after 1853. But in other forms, they contributed to the formation of a Japanese nation-state later in the nineteenth century. Let us look ahead, beyond 1853, to examine how.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>By the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, Japanese thinkers had relativized and repudiated the Sinocentric Confucian view of world order. They no longer considered Japan a barbarian nation which was civilized only to the extent that its people assimilated Confucian moral culture. Early Tokugawa Confucians such as Ito Jinsai and Ogyu Sorai had recognized Japan as barbarian, and China as Middle Kingdom Civilization. For them, the Way of China&rsquo;s ancient sages embodied civilized life for all peoples. But they insisted that because</p>
<p>137</p>
<p>Epilogue</p>
<p>contemporary Japan practiced that Way more faithfully than contemporary China, Japan could boast moral excellence despite being barbarian. Such rationalizations of Japanese superiority based on Sinocentric moral and cultural norms, however, were too far-fetched to be persuasive and too nationally demeaning to be acceptable.</p>
<p>Later in the Edo period, Confucian-Shinto syncretists such as Yamazaki Ansai and Asami Keisai declared that the imported Chinese categories of civilization and barbarism were irrelevant. They argued that China&rsquo;s Way of the sages corresponded &ldquo;coincidentally&rdquo; to Japan&rsquo;s Way of the kami. Since these Ways, though separately expressed, were in essence one, both Japanese and Chinese customs and morals possessed equal worth. Still later, Motoori Norinaga and other Kokugaku thinkers retorted that Japan was a superb nation in its own right: Its culture and morality were superior because they were different from, not the same as, China&rsquo;s. Meanwhile, the applied technology and the improved knowledge of world geography supplied by Western Learning debunked all Sinocentric conceits, whether invoked by China or Japan. Thinkers in all schools welcomed this advanced Western knowledge, largely because it was useful, but also because it discredited Chinese claims of cultural superiority. By the early nineteenth century, Mito thinkers such as Aizawa were struggling to work out an acceptable synthesis. They revived Confucian moral culture by infusing elements of Kokugaku myth, but proclaimed that Japan&rsquo;s native Way was primary and esteemed Chinese moral norms as a supplement. Equally important, they felt constrained to respect and assimilate useful Western skills and knowledge to make up for deficiencies in traditional Japanese or Chinese learning. In 1834, Tokugawa Nariaki, for example, grudgingly conceded the superior size, speed, strength, and navigability of &ldquo;barbarian&rdquo; ships. He admitted that Japan must acquire and use advanced Western techniques for shipbuilding in order to create a powerful navy and merchant marine. But he insisted on designing the outside of all new vessels in a conspicuously Japanese style, so that the borrowed barbarian techniques would not show through. 10</p>

<p>8</p>
<p>These currents of thought signaled the beginnings of national</p>
<p>138</p>
<p>Looking Ahead</p>
<p>consciousness-over and above simple ethnic pride-in nineteenth century Japan. Throughout the Edo period, Japanese thinkers and leaders had been proud of their land and asserted that pride against Chinese claims of moral or cultural excellence. But the criteria on which they based their assertions changed significantly over time; these became increasingly irrational and centered on the putative uniqueness of Japan&rsquo;s imperial line. By the late eighteenth century, Motoori Norinaga made it respectable, if not imperative, for Japanese thinkers to profess a belief in the literal truth of Kojiki myths which described Japan&rsquo;s divine national origins. After him, the Tokugawa climate of opinion was decidedly different: One asserted Japan&rsquo;s superiority to foreign lands most convincingly by citing the descent of its unbroken imperial line from the Sun Goddess. Bakumatsu leaders might borrow advanced Western skills and knowledge in order to strengthen their nation-but they were loath to admit their indebtedness openly.</p>
<p>Japanese thinkers in the mid-nineteenth century clearly recognized how drastically their world outlook and cultural values had changed compared with the Ch&rsquo;ing dynasty Chinese. For example, in 1842, Saitō Chikudo, a poet of classical Chinese and scholar in the bakufu&rsquo;s Shōheikō Academy, wrote an essay called &ldquo;The Origins and Outcome of the Opium War&rdquo; (&ldquo;Ahen shimatsu&rdquo;). In it, he stated that right and wrong, justice and injustice, were self-evident: The wicked British had sold China a hateful narcotic that they banned at home. They were &ldquo;ugly barbarians,&rdquo; who were ignorant of the rules of proper behavior and righteousness. But what had allowed them to defeat the Ch&rsquo;ing empire, a &ldquo;grand, huge nation of humanity and righteousness?&rdquo; he asked. 11</p>
<p>After pondering this question repeatedly, I concluded that English victory and Ch&rsquo;ing defeat, English cleverness and Ch&rsquo;ing ineptness, had nothing to do with [the moral issue of] opium. Instead, the crux of the matter lay in a more commonplace, everyday attitude of long-standing. Namely, there are many countries in the universe, and each differs from the others. Who can say that one of them is civilized, and the rest,</p>
<p>139</p>
<p>Epilogue</p>
<p>barbarian? But China (Kando), presumes itself Middle Kingdom Civilization (Chuka) and considers other peoples despicable animals, mysterious beings devoid of spirit.</p>
<p>They know nothing of the Westerners&rsquo; shrewdness or of highly sophisticated machines because they have never considered these valuable as such. . . . When the Chinese (Kan) devise strategies to ward off Western incursion, they simply rant, &ldquo;barbarian, barbarian.&rdquo; 12</p>
<p>Unlike Ch&rsquo;ing leaders, who clung to fixed notions of Sinocentric civilization and of barbarism, bakumatsu Japanese-even those steeped in Chinese literary traditions-quickly recognized and actively assimilated superior Western knowledge and skills. They did so while sneering at China for cultural complacence, exhalting the innate excellence of their Divine Realm, and disparaging Western peoples as barbarian. After 1825, Japanese intellectuals pretentiously claimed Middle Kingdom standing for their nation, but they knew full well that their claim lacked any basis in reality.</p>
<p>This gnawing awareness of the discrepancy between rhetoric and reality disposed Japanese leaders to adjust to changing world conditions by transforming the Tokugawa bakuhan polity into a Western-style nation-state. Although Aizawa flaunted Japan&rsquo;s superiority to the so-called Western barbarians, a careful reading of New Theses shows that his blustering lacked selfassurance. Western Learning forced him to abandon the traditional Sinocentric conception of the world as &ldquo;all under Heaven&rdquo;-an ideally universal empire where a uniform Confucian moral culture ought to prevail. Instead, he perceived the world as an arena where seven large territorial units, analogous to the seven great kingdoms of China&rsquo;s Warring States period (403-221 B.C.), vied for spiritual and military hegemony. Aizawa saw Japan as but one of these seven &ldquo;territories.&ldquo;13 He compared her to Chou in ancient China-an insignificant state which existed precariously in a world dominated by far larger and stronger powers. In sum, Western knowledge made him admit Japan&rsquo;s inferiority to the West in certain crucial respects.</p>
<p>Aizawa feared an indirect Western takeover through Christian</p>
<p>140Looking Ahead</p>
<p>transformation, or what we today would call ideological subversion and cultural assimilation. Therefore a Western military</p>
<p>threat was not the uppermost worry in his mind. But he nonetheless recognized Japan&rsquo;s armed weakness. Western countries, for example, enjoyed a decisive edge in raw materials over the</p>
<p>Divine Realm:</p>
<p>The barbarians appropriate lead, copper, iron, sulfur, and other precious metals from their far-flung overseas possessions (kaigai shokoku), so they never suffer from a shortage of these metals. We, however, must rely solely on deposits of these metals found in our homeland (uchi), so we are at a clear [material] disadvantage when defending ourselves against foreigners. 14</p>
<p>Bringing to light this source of Western strength had to make him question the status quo he sought to reinforce. Since Westerners had benefited greatly by expanding overseas, Aizawa could not help wondering if Japan should follow suit.</p>
<p>Beneath his puffed up claim that Japan was the Middle Kingdom lay a realistic perception of Japan as merely naichi, or &ldquo;Japan proper.&ldquo;15 Aizawa so designated Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyūshū, in contrast to &ldquo;overseas lands&rdquo; 16 (such as the Ezo or Ogasawara Islands), which he feared would succumb to Christian subversion. His use of naichi foreshadowed modern Japanese thinking on foreign policy. Until Japan&rsquo;s defeat in 1945, the term denoted its four main islands (including Hokkaido), as opposed to gaichi, or areas such as Korea, Taiwan, and Sakhalin, which Japan colonized or annexed. Unlike Meiji leaders, Aizawa did not advocate overseas expansion beyond Ezo<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> But his terminology indicates how mindful he was of Japan&rsquo;s being a small country, whose weakness compared with Western nations stemmed partly from a bakufu-dictated &ldquo;hallowed law&rdquo; that kept Japanese bottled up at home.</p>
<p>Japan, Aizawa realized, was not really the Middle Kingdom, and Westerners were not simple barbarians. Aizawa&rsquo;s pejorative, &ldquo;Western barbarians,&rdquo; should not obscure his genuine respect for their achievements and his rational understanding of their capabilities. 18 They had stolen the sagely device of religious</p>
<p>141</p>
<p>Epilogue</p>
<p>teachings implemented in government to instill active allegiance in commoners. Their use of Christianity created the spiritual unity essential to turn Western peoples into nations (kokutai); it allowed them to mobilize popular energies in pursuit of state goals. Equally important, Aizawa believed that Christianity enabled Westerners to subvert the lands they sought to colonize:</p>
<p>The barbarians employ occult religions and other mysterious doctrines to seduce foreign peoples into their fold. Should the barbarians win our commoners over to their cause, their paucity of numbers would become a great multitude&hellip;. &ldquo;Whenever they arrive in a country it is doomed because they conquer it from within by recruiting the local inhabitants into their ranks&hellip;.&ldquo;19</p>
<p>This permitted them to conquer foreign nations intact-to practice the precepts of Sun Tzu and other legendary tactical geniuses. Here was the secret of Western strength and what made Aizawa hate the West so fiercely.</p>
<p>Aizawa was not the only late Tokugawa thinker convinced that Westerners used Christianity as a state religion to create popular unity and national strength. Nakajima Hirotari (17921864), a Kokugaku scholar from Kumamoto domain and contemporary of Aizawa&rsquo;s, considered Christianity a &ldquo;trick&rdquo; that European rulers used to &ldquo;make their peoples docile and easy to lead.&rdquo; Nakajima also suggested that bakufu leaders master the Westerners&rsquo; &ldquo;technique&rdquo;-their calculated use of religion to facilitate political control. In Japan, &ldquo;the Way of the imperial land,&rdquo;</p>
<p>by which he meant Shinto, should be made to serve this</p>
<p>purpose.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>Nineteenth-century Japanese thinkers and leaders expressed fascination for the idea of &ldquo;national essence,&rdquo; perceived as the spiritual cohesion supposedly achieved in European nations due to a unity of state and church. In 1856, Yokoi Shōnan wrote:</p>
<p>Although our land possesses the Three Teachings [Confucianism, Shinto, and Buddhism], it is a national polity (kokutai) lacking a [national] faith. The Way of the sages is an amusement for scholars; the Way of the kami is irrational and</p>
<p>142</p>
<p>Looking Ahead</p>
<p>absurd; Buddhism deceives foolish commoners, but is not a Great Way that both high and low will accept. How, then, can we unify the people&rsquo;s hearts and minds? How are we to govern and edify? These are the most grievous ills afflicting us now.</p>
<p>When we examine conditions in Western countries, however, we find [a stark contrast]. Although I have no detailed understanding of [present-day] Christianity, I know that it differs from the Christianity brought [to Japan] in the Tembun era [1532-54] as night differs from day. It is based on the Will of Heaven; its main doctrines follow the rules of ethical behavior; and its religious teachings dictate commandments [for the people to obey]. It is a religion that combines government and edification. From sovereign on down to commoners-all are true to its commandments. 21 (emphasis added)</p>
<p>Shōnan feared Christian-inspired Western government as much as Aizawa, but was more candid about praising it. He too believed that Japan&rsquo;s leaders had to imitate European rulers, who skillfully used Christianity to cultivate popular unity. Knowledgeable Japanese in this era did not think of Christianity as the same faith that sixteenth-century Spanish and Portuguese missionaries had propagated. 22 Quite the contrary, they elevated it to the level of Confucian ritual and music-an efficacious &ldquo;device&rdquo; that sagacious Western rulers exploited to make their peoples love and fight for their countries.</p>
<p>Itō Hirobumi also perceived the value of, and need for, state religion. On 18 June 1888, he explained what prompted the Meiji oligarchs to draft Japan&rsquo;s imperial constitution:</p>
<p>In Europe, constitutional government has had over a thousand years since its inception. Not only are the people thoroughly familiar with it, religion serves as a &ldquo;linchpin&rdquo; for them. [Religion] has seeped deeply into the people&rsquo;s hearts; their hearts and minds are united in this faith.</p>
<p>But in our country religions are very weak; none of them can serve as a linchpin in the state. At one time Buddhism was strong and bound the hearts of high and low together, but it is now on the wane. In sectarian Shinto, followers carry on</p>
<p>143</p>
<p>Epilogue</p>
<p>the teachings of sect founders, but it has little of the power of a religion to unify and direct the people&rsquo;s wills. . . . In our country, the only thing that can serve as a linchpin is the imperial house. 23 (emphasis added)</p>
<p>In other words, only by making the Japanese people revere the imperial line, could Meiji leaders attain the spiritual unity that Western nations enjoyed because of Christianity.</p>
<p>These nineteenth-century thinkers and leaders realized that to maintain Japan&rsquo;s sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of Western encroachment, it was essential for its government to win popular support and loyalty, and that to achieve this task, some form of state religion was imperative. The Imperial Rescript on Education issued in 1890 lucidly reveals this concern, and we should note that its drafters borrowed a line from the section entitled, &ldquo;What is Essential to a Nation&rdquo; (&ldquo;Kokutai&rdquo;) in Aizawa&rsquo;s New Theses: &ldquo;All the people of the realm be of one heart and mind.&rdquo; 24 This need guided the Meiji government&rsquo;s policy of nationalistic ethical instruction in compulsory education and its use of state Shinto to inculcate popular reverence for the</p>
<p>emperor.</p>
<p>This persisting fascination with the Western-inspired idea of kokutai discloses an important qualitative change in how politically-conscious nineteenth-century Japanese conceived of their nation. In earlier Tokugawa political parlance, the term &ldquo;nation&rdquo; or &ldquo;state&rdquo; (kokka), had denoted the daimyo &ldquo;lands and house&rdquo; to which samurai were in hereditary liege. Thus, it stood for a daimyo&rsquo;s domain and the samurai belonging to it. Following that class-bound usage, Aizawa expanded the concept to include the entire realm (tenka): He conceived of the current Japanese state as a bakufu-led federation of all daimyo domains and warrior bands. 25 This &ldquo;nation&rdquo; or &ldquo;state&rdquo; still did not include all persons living in Tokugawa Japan, only the military aristocracy; it excluded &ldquo;stupid commoners&rdquo; whose loyalty</p>
<p>Aizawa distrusted.</p>
<p>However, Aizawa&rsquo;s knowledge of world affairs showed that Japan&rsquo;s bakuhan state was only one of several states struggling to preserve independence in the world. This realization compelled</p>
<p>144</p>
<p>Looking Ahead</p>
<p>him to grope toward the idea of a nation construed as &ldquo;the land and people,&rdquo; or kokumin in modern-Japanese usage. Western Learning suggested that Japan was gravely imperiled unless Edo leaders exploited the emperor in Kyoto as a unifying symbol to inculcate active political allegiance in all Japanese people, irrespective of their hereditary status. Aizawa&rsquo;s concept of kokutai thus broadened the idea of what properly constituted the Japanese nation in two crucial dimensions. He proposed that the imperial court and the common people-hitherto strictly excluded from the state&rsquo;s political life-must begin to assume limited but key roles in it.</p>
<p>When pushed to its logical conclusions, this proposal meant dismantling the existing order. As long as no true military crisis forced the issue, Aizawa and other bakufu supporters were free to ignore those logical conclusions. But when faced with a real Western threat after 1853, people began to see that the shogun could not rule Japan without borrowing spiritual authority from the imperial court, and the daimyo could not defend Japan without demanding some form of military service from the nonsamurai classes. Thus the bakuhan system was structurally incompatible with the drastic institutional changes that Aizawa&rsquo;s proposed reforms ultimately entailed: an emperor-centered state and a mass conscript army. Regardless of Aizawa&rsquo;s original intentions, after 1853 his concept of kokutai turned into an ironic contradiction. What he deemed &ldquo;essential&rdquo; to sustain the Tokugawa polity proved decisive in undoing it.</p>

<p>But not the rhetoric of reverence for the Emperor in general. By the late 1850s, just before his death, Yoshida Shōin was advocating the idea of &ldquo;one ruler over all the people&rdquo; (ikkun bammin). This idea entailed eliminating the existing class-bound form of loyalty within the hierarchic status order. Under that system-ideologically reinforced by Mito Learningdaimyo and samurai owed loyalty to the bakufu which in turn owed loyalty to the emperor. Commoners owed no loyalty, only submission. After Shōin, however, samurai and commoners both were seen as owing loyalty directly to the emperor, overriding the daimyo and bakufu who were deemed superfluous.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
