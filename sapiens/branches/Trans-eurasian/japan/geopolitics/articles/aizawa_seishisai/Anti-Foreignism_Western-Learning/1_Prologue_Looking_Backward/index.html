  <meta property="og:description" content="In the second lunar month of 1825 the Edo bakufu ordered officials in coastal areas except Nagasaki to attack on sight and drive away all Western ships, whether or not clearly identified as Dutch. In the following month Aizawa Seishisai (1781-1863), a Confucian scholar of Mito Learning,1 composed a polemical tract entitled New Theses (Shinron) justifying that policy. These events mark a great divide in early-modern Japanese history: Even though the Expulsion Edict was revoked in 1842, bakufu authority and legitimacy after 1825 hinged on maintaining national isolation (sakoku), conceived of as an inviolable law of the land. This in turn meant being willing and able to perform joi, or the expulsion of Western barbarians by force. In this study, which serves as an introduction to the English translation of New Theses, I show how this idea of armed expulsion evolved during the Edo period and try to explain why bakufu leaders adopted it as the guiding principle of Japanese foreign policy.">

  <div id="post_content">
  <p>In the second lunar month of 1825 the Edo bakufu ordered officials in coastal areas except Nagasaki to attack on sight and drive away all Western ships, whether or not clearly identified as Dutch. In the following month Aizawa Seishisai (1781-1863), a Confucian scholar of Mito Learning,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> composed a polemical tract entitled New Theses (Shinron) justifying that policy. These events mark a great divide in early-modern Japanese history: Even though the Expulsion Edict was revoked in 1842, bakufu authority and legitimacy after 1825 hinged on maintaining national isolation (sakoku), conceived of as an inviolable law of the land. This in turn meant being willing and able to perform joi, or the expulsion of Western barbarians by force. In this study, which serves as an introduction to the English translation of New Theses, I show how this idea of armed expulsion evolved during the Edo period and try to explain why bakufu leaders adopted it as the guiding principle of Japanese foreign policy.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Quite rightly, we generally examine Mito Learning and the idea of armed expulsion in the context of Western impact and Japanese response leading to the Meiji Restoration during the 1850s and 1860s. Mito Learning represented a final ideological attempt to shore up the existing Tokugawa feudal order. Aizawa&rsquo;s thought, as articulated in New Theses, provided normative grounding for bakufu de facto sovereignty, its policy of national isolation, the hereditary supremacy of the samurai class, and a pre-modern economy based on agricultural self-sufficiency.&quot; The Meiji Restoration could not occur, capitalism and industrialism could not advance, and a powerful centralized nation-state</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Prologue</p>
<p>could not emerge, until these old Tokugawa institutional arrangements were scrapped. First of all, Japan&rsquo;s leaders had to disown the Mito-inspired policy of armed expulsion, a policy that became unrealistic after Commodore Matthew C. Perry and Consul Townsend Harris forced Japan&rsquo;s ports open in the 1850s. Japan&rsquo;s leaders had to recognize the inevitability of &ldquo;opening the country&rdquo; (kaikoku) to trade and diplomacy, and of joining the world community of nations.</p>
<p>For these reasons, Japanese and Western historians have focused on the bakumatsu, or &ldquo;End of the Shogunate,&rdquo; era from 1853 to 1868 in their attempts to understand the slogans jõi and kaikoku. Political and diplomatic historians explain that in this era the rhetoric of expelling Westerners and opening the country should not be accepted literally<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> These slogans were not mutually exclusive. Both allowed for a wide range of usage and interpretation as changing political conditions dictated. Not only did elliptic literary forms of writing foster ambiguity, bakumatsu writers manipulated these slogans in a purposely cryptic way, for they were masters of the skillful hedge. &ldquo;Expelling Western barbarians,&rdquo; for example, often was for domestic consumption, while &ldquo;opening the country&rdquo; was an expedient ploy for diplomatic maneuvering with the foreign powers. And after 1864, the rhetoric of joi was little more than a pretext for overthrowing the bakufu.</p>
<p>Yet ambiguities and qualifications aside, this interpretation holds, jōi and kaikoku advocates shared the same basic goal: to preserve Japan&rsquo;s independence. They also agreed on the means to achieve that goal: national wealth and military strength. Even after 1853, sakoku, or national isolation, persisted as an ideal; it was transformed into the conviction that Japanese leaders should not open their country under foreign coercion, that they themselves should determine the time and the conditions under which to pursue trade and diplomacy. Advocates of armed expulsion knew full well that this policy could lead to defeats in combat with the foreigners. But a few lost battles would unify the Japanese people spiritually and inspire them to achieve equality with the West, even if this entailed importing Western arms and technology through trade and intercourse. Expulsion,</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Looking Backward</p>
<p>then, was not an end in itself; it admitted the eventuality of opening Japan to the Western world. Nor was opening the country an ultimate goal. Instead of risking immediate military defeat, Japan prudently should accede to Western demands, at least for the time being. But Japan must use this respite to master Western science and technology, adopt Western institutions, and thus strengthen itself to recapture the ideal behind national isolation-an ability to expel Westerners should the need or desire arise. In effect, opening the country was the best way to expedite the expulsion of Western barbarians in the long run.</p>
<p>Some scholars reject this joi/kaikoku polarity in favor of a three-stage developmental scheme to clarify the character and scope of change in bakumatsu foreign policy attitudes. First, increased public engagement in the foreign policy debate through the call for expulsion meant advancing from a passive acceptance of national isolation to a positive advocacy of it. Next came acquiescence, however reluctant and resentful, in a policy of opening the ports. Finally, active support for the policy would follow. This three-step process, it is held, produced an ethical transvaluation in which Japanese leaders came to believe that national isolation was bad, and that opening the country to Western trade and diplomatic intercourse was good. This entailed repudiating the bakuhan system as unworkable and not worth supporting.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Other scholars oppose this joi/kaikoku dichotomy for different reasons. 6 They see the primary issue not as a debate over whether to expel or admit foreigners to Japan, but rather, as a clash between traditional Confucian and modern Western conceptions of the world order. Jõi assumed a hierarchy among nations, kaikoku, equality between nations. Expulsionist thinkers could conceive of Japan only as the embodiment of civilization at the center of a Chinese-style &ldquo;all under Heaven&rdquo;; Westerners were inherently inferior beings, barbarians to be kept at bay. Opening Japan to the world in a true and meaningful sense required accepting a Europe-centered international order composed of independent and equal nation-states. Modern trade and diplomacy could take place only under these conditions: The Western powers, not Japan, determined the game&rsquo;s rules.</p>

<p>Prologue</p>
<p>ap-</p>
<p>Intellectual historians offer a different way of analyzing joi in the bakumatsu era. 7 For them, the expulsionist ideas in New Theses serve as a convenient departure point in tracing the breakdown of traditional modes of thought and the emergence of a modern political realism. These processes would take Japan through the Meiji Restoration and culminate in a centralized, bureaucratic nation-state. The history of nineteenth-century Japanese thought, according to this view, describes the liberation of political decision-making from Confucian moralism. Mito thinkers such as Aizawa could not perceive the foreign threat realistically-as a military problem. Instead, Aizawa construed barbarian intrusion to be a portent from Heaven signifying daimyo and samurai moral decay. Like earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and other irregularities of nature, the pearance of Western barbarians for Aizawa was an admonition to carry out moral reform in government. According to the logic behind his premodern Confucian idea of interaction between Heaven and man, a ruler&rsquo;s good or bad deeds invited Heavenly reciprocation in kind. The daimyo and samurai, Aizawa believed, had brought the Western menace on themselves by governing in a lackadaisical, irresponsible manner. Mito critics such as Aizawa were convinced that chuko, political reform through moral reinvigoration, of which jōi formed a central part, would suffice to end the foreign threat. But after 1864, when Western armed strength proved unassailable, such reformist ideas based on moral rigor lost cogency and gave way to an opportunistic realpolitik in domestic and foreign affairs.</p>
<p>Cultural historians argue that the empiricism of Western science and the useful knowledge gained from a study of world affairs discredited backward-looking joi ideas and policies. The scholars of Dutch Studies (Rangakusha) enlightened their countrymen by providing new, practical knowledge from the West. Responsible Japanese leaders came to realize the impossibility of trying to drive away Westerners by force. Pragmatic statesmen found that they must open the country to Western trade and diplomatic intercourse in order to master the secrets of Western power and wealth. Informed specialists in Dutch Studies and Western Learning challenged outmoded Mito views</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Looking Backward</p>
<p>of state and international order; New Theses lost credence and currency; kaikoku replaced joi. One distinguished scholar emphasizes the decisive role that men with Western knowledge played in refuting the xenophobic Mito policy of expulsion:</p>
<p>the pursuit of Dutch studies had already in the eighteenth century created a body of scholars who, primarily because of their interest in science, were anxious to see the opening of the country. This tendency had been strengthened as with the lapse of time more knowledge was acquired and more was needed, until at length it became clear that the Bakufu was too weak to withstand accumulating foreign pressure.&quot;</p>
<p>Another authority lends further support to this view:</p>
<p>The kaikoku school is closely connected with the Rangakusha whose study of the West gave them a greater knowledge of world conditions than that possessed by most of their contemporaries. With greater knowledge came a more vivid realization of Japan&rsquo;s military weakness, and it was this that was the distinguishing feature of their thought. 10</p>
<p>Mid-nineteenth-century Japanese leaders rejected direct military confrontation with the West in favor of thoroughgoing cultural borrowing. By adopting Western ideas and institutions in the name of &ldquo;civilization and enlightenment,&rdquo; they strove to create wealth and power under a centralized nation-state.</p>
<p>This brief survey only begins to introduce the rich and sophisticated secondary literature on Aizawa&rsquo;s New Theses, Mito Learning, and joi, but I believe it accurately reflects a pertinent range of scholarly opinion. Despite the diversity of viewpoints I have presented above, all have two themes in common: They ascribe prime importance to Western knowledge in repudiating joi as an outdated idea and an unrealistic policy, and they focus on the period 1853 to 1868. By synthesizing the various scholarly theses presented above, we would arrive at something like the following consensus. First, joi ideologues such as Aizawa were convinced that a &ldquo;muscular Confucianism&rdquo; which reasserted the superiority of traditional culture and values would beat back Western encroachment. After this proved futile,</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>Prologue</p>
<p>menace was a</p>
<p>realists such as Sakuma Shōzan declared that, since the foreign matter of power rather than culture or ethics, Japan&rsquo;s leaders need but assimilate demonstrably superior military technology and science from the West. Finally, enlightened thinkers such as Fukuzawa Yukichi realized that importing such by-products and outward forms of Western civilization was not enough: Modern Western nations derived their strength from a spiritual source; so Japan must acquire this spirit of modern Western civilization as well.</p>
<p>In short, historians treat Aizawa&rsquo;s Mito Confucianism and jõi as representing outmoded values and a state policy that Japan had to leave behind in her quest for independence and modernity. There is much validity in this view, but it is only one way of coming to grips with the problem at hand. In this study of Aizawa&rsquo;s thought I will examine nineteenth-century Japanese anti-foreignism from a different perspective in the hope of gaining new insights into its historical significance. I will primarily look backward in time from 1825 to discover how the idea and policy of joi emerged, rather than look forward from 1825 to discuss why this idea and policy declined.</p>
<p>The appearance of New Theses and the promulgation of joi as national policy in 1825 marked the end of one epoch as well as the start of another. After more than a century of intellectual ferment, the era from 1793 to 1825 saw the perfection of an ideology to support the Japanese state in its then-existing form: a Tokugawa-led federation of regional daimyo which historians label the bakuhan system. This national ideology of &ldquo;Japan as Middle-Kingdom&rdquo; allowed bakufu leaders to extricate Japan from subservience to a China-dominated diplomatic world order of universal empire and culture. Equally important, it allowed them to conceive of ideas like national sovereignty and territorial integrity, ideas indispensable to the formation of Meiji nationalism. Throughout New Theses Aizawa calls Japan &ldquo;the Divine Realm,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Middle Kingdom.&rdquo; Granted, he was not the first Tokugawa thinker to boast that Japan rather than China represented Chugoku, &ldquo;Middle Kingdom Civilization,&rdquo; and that therefore Japan was the superior nation. But in New</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>Looking Backward</p>
<p>Theses, Aizawa achieved the ultimate synthesis of Confucian and nativist rationales for claiming Japanese superiority, and he linked the idea of Japan as Middle-Kingdom to the existing state structure more forcefully and convincingly than anyone had before. In short, his New Theses contained tenets of protonationalism: the idea and belief that all Japanese, despite their unalterable differences in social status, owe ultimate loyalty to the existing bakuhan state as the only form of political organization proper to an independent and sovereign Japan. Thanks to this ideology of Japan as Middle-Kingdom, Aizawa made the crucially important shift in world view from universal empire (tenka) to nation-state (kokka), a perceptual shift that would take decades longer in China. 12 After the appearance of New Theses in 1825, bakumatsu thinkers and leaders continued to conceive of a Japan-centered world order, but they realized that Japan did not dominate it. Although the Tokugawa bakuhan state claimed centrality and superiority in the international arena, a plurality of nations vied for supremacy and survival. Japan was only one of the competitors-and a small, backward one at that.</p>
<p>In yet another sense, 1825 marked the culmination of an important historical change. The concept of joi took on a new, militant character, and found institutionalization in state policy with the promulgation of the 1825 Expulsion Edict. Earlier in the Edo period, Confucian thinkers had conceived of joi in highly abstract, cultural terms; for them it had meant sweeping away, or eradicating &ldquo;what is barbarian.&rdquo; They had seen it as eliminating alien ideas, customs, and values by edifying commoners in Confucianism. Joi in this abstract, cultural sense entailed erecting barriers to prevent Japanese commoners from being &ldquo;transformed&rdquo; by foreign ways. In 1825, the term changed in meaning from eradicating &ldquo;what is barbarian&rdquo; to eradicating &ldquo;the barbarians.&rdquo; This semantic change accompanied a shift in methods of execution-from edification to armed force-which reflected the bakufu&rsquo;s recognition that world conditions called for a new basic foreign policy. Before 1825, the bakufu customarily turned away foreign intruders by persuading them to leave peacefully. Edo leaders shied away from provoking encounters</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>Prologue</p>
<p>with Westerners, sometimes even if it meant humiliating themselves. But in 1825, they publicly committed their regime to violence as a first resort, not a last resort, in upholding national</p>
<p>isolation.</p>
<p>Western Learning contributed directly to the bakufu&rsquo;s formulation and justification of armed expulsion: We must discard any preconceptions linking knowledge of the West with an &ldquo;enlightened&rdquo; kaikoku policy. Nineteenth-century Japanese students of the West such as Takano Chōei and Watanabe Kazan argued that the bakufu should strive to exclude Westerners and uphold national isolation insofar as international developments allowed. 13 In fact, the most brilliant and informed Rangakusha of the day, a bakufu official named Takahashi Kageyasu, first proposed the 1825 Expulsion Edict. thermore, when Aizawa composed New Theses that same year, he knew much more about the world outside Japan than we generally assume. Though at times mistaken, his understanding of things Western was crucial in shaping his development as a xenophobic thinker.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>Fur-</p>
<p>Some may resist this argument. Given the virulent nature of Aizawa&rsquo;s anti-foreign rhetoric, he and Mito Learning should be deemed irrelevant to, if not incompatible with, Western Learning and its liberalizing effects on Tokugawa thought, politics, and society. Aizawa, they would claim, steeped himself in traditional Confucian and Shinto biases. He flaunted Japanese cultural and ethnic superiority, contemptuously calling Westerners &ldquo;barbarians,&rdquo; &ldquo;dogs and goats,&rdquo; &ldquo;wild boars and wolves,&rdquo; and the like. He warned of sinister Christian designs on Japan and exhorted all Japanese to hate and kill foreigners as they would hate and kill vicious, cunning predators. In stark contrast to Aizawa&rsquo;s xenophobia, this interpretation holds, thinkers engaged in Western Learning were forward-looking heralds of Japanese modernization. They should be viewed as liberal or progressive for wanting to transcend the narrow confines of classical Chinese or native Japanese learning. Would not the zealous pursuit of practical knowledge from Europe foster good will toward foreign peoples? Xenophobia stemming from uninformed prejudice and open-minded liberalism fostered by</p>
<p>10Looking Backward</p>
<p>knowledge-these are the contrasting images that Mito Learning and Western Learning present to many.</p>
<p>In truth the issue is not this simple and clear-cut. 15 Seeking or possessing Western knowledge to a greater degree did not make Japanese in the nineteenth century more liberal or more kindly disposed to Westerners. As mentioned earlier, the period&rsquo;s most accomplished Rangakusha, Takahashi Kageyasu, proposed that the bakufu order all daimyo to drive away Western ships on sight. Nor did a lesser understanding of conditions in the West preclude some Japanese from formulating &ldquo;enlightened&rdquo; policies: In 1825, Aizawa perceived Japan&rsquo;s foreign and domestic crises much more clearly than Takahashi, and he proposed much more sensible solutions.</p>
<p>Few studies of the past are unimpaired by discrepancies of perception; historical hindsight often yields images of people, ideas, and events that contemporaries would have found hard to accept. Aizawa and his New Theses are a case in point. As we have noted, postwar historians tend to characterize his Mito Learning as feudal, traditional, backward-looking, or outmoded; in short, as a hindrance that could not be overcome quickly enough<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> But many people in Aizawa&rsquo;s own lifetime saw New Theses in a different light. His very use of the adjective new in his title must have struck bakumatsu readers as deliberately provocative. To Tokugawa scholars trained in the Confucian historiographical tradition, new (as opposed to ancient) often implied something radical or unorthodox, if not downright dangerous. Wang Mang&rsquo;s New Dynasty in the first century A.D., and Wang An-shih&rsquo;s New Laws during the Sung dynasty would have been the immediate associations. 17</p>
<p>Aizawa&rsquo;s New Theses of 1825 intimated much that was similarly deviant. In the 1850s, for example, Yamagata Taika, a high-ranking domain scholar in Chōshu, cast a jaundiced eye on &ldquo;adherents of the Mito school in our domain&rdquo; who were &ldquo;misled by its heterodox teachings.&ldquo;18 Regarding Aizawa&rsquo;s concept of kokutai (discussed below), Taika wrote: &ldquo;The term kokutai appears often in Sung dynasty writings, but I have yet to come across it in Japanese works. It probably originated in Mito.&ldquo;19</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Prologue</p>
<p>Taika deserves no high marks for philological erudition, but his comments show that he considered Aizawa&rsquo;s ideas to have been &ldquo;outlandish concepts not expressed by men in earlier ages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;20</p>
<p>He plainly did not think that Mito ideas were sanctioned by tradition, or that they could shore up the existing order. Quite the contrary, he feared that New Theses would lead young men down evil and aberrant paths.</p>
<p>Chōshu scholars were not alone in attacking Aizawa&rsquo;s ideas as dangerous. In 1871, the Kurume domain samurai, Kawashima Suminosuke, recalled:</p>
<p>Scholars both in and outside the domain school, the Meizendo, refused even to look at Mito-related writings and would not allow their students to read them either. They branded readers of Mito works &ldquo;followers of Tempō Learning.&rdquo; They detested and spread tales about such followers, depicting them as practicers of black magic, in an attempt to imbue common folk with fear and loathing of them. Those scholars would say, &ldquo;such persons possess the evil eye; if you associate with them, they will cast its spell on you.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>Aizawa&rsquo;s &ldquo;new&rdquo; theses seemed uncanny and extremist to many contemporaries. They labeled his Mito ideas &ldquo;Tempo Learning,&rsquo; after the Tempo era, from 1830 to 1843. In those years his works began to circulate throughout Japan, winning the enthusiastic support of impressionable youths and earning the fearful disdain of fusty establishment scholars. In this study I argue that the idea of kokutai and much else that appeared new (and ominous) in New Theses derived from Aizawa&rsquo;s Western Learning.</p>
<p>In 1825, a decade and a half before the Opium War, Aizawa perceived that the Western &ldquo;barbarians&rdquo; were unlike any who had confronted China or Japan in the past. He did not discern a Western military threat to Tokugawa Japan because no such threat existed. In the 1810s and 1820s, British and American whalers, not warships, were appearing frequently in Japanese waters. The Industrial Revolution had yet to tip the technological scales decisively in Europe&rsquo;s favor, so Westerners brandished no overwhelmingly superior weapons in the Far East. In short, expulsion by force was a safe and sound policy for</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>Looking Backward</p>
<p>Japan to adopt at that time. Since no clear and present military from abroad existed in 1825, we miss the point when we danger fault Aizawa for failing to detect it. Instead, we should try to explain how and why he construed the foreign menace as he did. Aizawa argued that the secret of Western strength lay in Christianity, a state cult that Western leaders propagated to cultivate voluntary allegiance both in their own peoples and in those they colonized overseas. Aizawa called the popular unity and allegiance so cultivated kokutai, &ldquo;the essence of a nation,&rsquo; (and by extension, &ldquo;what is essential to make a people into a nation&rdquo;). This meaning of kokutai constituted a significant departure from customary usage. Tokugawa and Ch&rsquo;ing writers used the term kokutai or kuo t&rsquo;i to mean &ldquo;the nation&rsquo;s honor&rdquo; or &ldquo;dynastic prestige,&rdquo; and in some contexts Aizawa too used the term in this sense. But in New Theses his use of kokutai also connoted &ldquo;the unity of religion and government&rdquo; (saisei itchi) used by a ruler to create spiritual unity and integration among his subjects: Only in this manner would a people be made into a nation. In antiquity, the emperor was both a spiritual and secular sovereign who conducted religious rituals as part of government. Though Aizawa claimed that this form of rule was purely Japanese and made Japan superior to foreign lands, actually he derived this idea of kokutai in large part from a knowledge of Christianity and the West. His studies of world geography and foreign affairs convinced him that Western leaders had attained kokutai better than the bakufu. In his eyes, Western power came from a spiritual source. Indeed, he equated a state&rsquo;s independence with its religious autonomy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The only nation besides our own that is not yet befouled by either Islam or Christianity is the Manchu Ch&rsquo;ing empire. Countries such as Korea or Annam have also done an admirable job of maintaining their independence (tokuritsu) by remaining unconverted to those occult religions.+++(5)+++ 23</p></blockquote>
<p>In New Theses Aizawa covertly argued that bakufu leaders must imitate Western methods of government by using the emperor to conduct a Japanese state religion designed to win the same type of national unity and mass loyalty that Western leaders</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>Prologue</p>
<p>had captured through Christianity. He considered national unity and mass loyalty more important than wealth and armed strength in ensuring Japan&rsquo;s independence as a nation. This was because he perceived that the Western threat Japan faced in 1825 was ideological, not military, in nature. Commodore Perry&rsquo;s steampowered warships changed that-but not until 1853.</p>
<p>It is true that much of Aizawa&rsquo;s Western &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; was based on misinformation. But his particular grasp of Western politics and society, whether accurate or not, provided a model against which to contrast and criticize Japanese institutions. Identifying what he believed to be Western sources of strength at once disclosed factors causing Japanese weakness. This prompted him to draw up radical new proposals intended to reinforce the Tokugawa bakuhan state by assimilating Western ideas and administrative practices.</p>
<p>Such reform programs prompted many contemporaries to look askance at New Theses. Discerning readers sensed that the bakuhan order could not absorb his suggested reforms and remain intact. For example, to suggest that the emperor play a crucial role in government administration in effect meant admitting that the bakufu could not rule effectively without borrowing prestige and religious authority from the imperial court. Such an admission seriously undermined the cardinal principle of bakufu political supremacy over the court, which the first three Tokugawa shoguns had been so intent on establishing. In addition, Aizawa&rsquo;s call for a Japanese state religion to imbue commoners with voluntary allegiance logically contradicted another categorical imperative of the bakuhan state-daimyo and warrior monopoly on military functions. This categorical imperative, usually stated as &ldquo;the separation of warrior from peasant&rdquo; (heino bunri), justified samurai-class privilege and supremacy in Tokugawa society. But Aizawa&rsquo;s proposal suggested that commoners, hitherto forbidden to engage in political or military affairs, owed loyal service to the bakuhan state in wartime. And those commoners could hardly be expected to bear this large new burden without demanding large new benefits. Of course, Aizawa never intended things to go that far. But his own intentions aside, the logical implications of his New Theses</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>Looking Backward</p>
<p>pointed to an emperor-centered government utilizing state religious teachings to infuse nationalism, not a status-bound and domain-centered form of loyalty, in commoners. Though his original intention was to reinforce the status quo, Aizawa&rsquo;s ideas entailed repudiating the structural principles that upheld the Tokugawa bakuhan order.</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>To summarize, the era 1793 to 1825 ended an epoch and marked a turning point in Tokugawa history. In 1825, the bakufu ordered that all Western ships be fired on and driven off (joi, uchiharai) and Aizawa Seishisai composed his New Theses in support of this unprecedented policy. Western Learning played a key role both in producing the joi edict and eliciting Aizawa&rsquo;s approbation of it. New Theses, coupled with the government&rsquo;s policy of expulsion by force, signaled the emergence proto-nationalism in Japan. Bakufu leaders after 1825 viewed their nation in its current form, the bakuhan state, as having surpassed China&rsquo;s long-held position of world-preeminence. Japan, not Ch&rsquo;ing dynasty China, was Middle Kingdom Civilization. In this Japan-centered world order, Edo dictated the rules governing trade and diplomatic relations between Japan and other states. One of these rules, which bakufu leaders established in 1793, stipulated that no Westerners other than the Dutch be permitted entry into Japan. In 1825, for the first time ever, the Edo bakufu publicly committed itself to upholding this rule through the unconditional use of armed force. Thereafter, and largely because of the climate of opinion that New Theses helped create, politically active segments of the Japanese population made bakufu legitimacy contingent on the ability to expel Westerners from Japan by force.</p>
<p>Informed critics such as Aizawa were not without misgivings when they saw the bakufu put its political honor at stake in this new way, for Western Learning had disclosed serious weaknesses in Japan&rsquo;s defenses. Fifteen years before the Opium War, Aizawa&rsquo;s knowledge of world affairs convinced him that the Westerners he denigrated as &ldquo;barbarians&rdquo; presented a foreign menace of unprecedented scale. While Japan and China had been regressing, the Westerners had made astounding progress in important areas of government and had seized vast colonial</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>Prologue</p>
<p>empires. Aizawa had to admit that only drastic new countermeasures would forestall territorial encroachment by the Westerners. The Edo bakufu had to reorganize Japan somewhat along Western lines in order to strengthen itself and preserve national isolation, a &ldquo;hallowed law&rdquo; to be enforced at any cost. Aizawa proposed how to do this in New Theses. He specified certain Western-inspired reforms deemed &ldquo;essential to make Japan a nation&rdquo; (kokutai). Paradoxically, his proposals would destroy the bakuhan order when pushed to their logical conclusions after 1868. But in 1825, the foreign threat facing Japan was far different from what it would be in 1853. Despite certain misgivings, Aizawa and like-minded bakufu supporters had cause for guarded optimism.</p>

<p>Modern historians divide &ldquo;Mito Learning&rdquo; (Mitogaku, itself a neologism dating from the 1830s) into &ldquo;Early&rdquo; and &ldquo;Later&rdquo; Schools. Throughout this work I refer solely to the Later Mito School when I employ the term &ldquo;Mito Learning.&rdquo; The Early Mito School centered on the Mitosponsored compilation of The History of Great Japan (Dainihonshi), particularly the &ldquo;Main Annals&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lives&rdquo; portions, which took place between 1657 and 1720. The Later Mito School refers to the Mito-style politicization of Confucianism expressed in ideals such as &ldquo;Honor the Emperor, Expel the barbarian,&rdquo; &ldquo;practice both military and literary arts, &ldquo;the identity of loyalty and filial submissiveness,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the unity of government and religious rituals.&rdquo; This Later Mito School is represented by scholar-activists such as Fujita Yukoku (1774-1826), his son Toko (18061855), and his grandson Koshiro (1842-1865); Aizawa Seishisai (17811863); and Toyota Tenko (1805-1864).
