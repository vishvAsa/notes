Samidare-sho
By Miura Baien
Translated by Leon Hurvitz, New York
Introduction The Samidare-sho is a minor work of Miura Baien, one in which he strays off his main field, namely, economics. It is a polemic against Christianity in what the Japanese isolationists of the time regarded as its two most pernicious aspects, viz., its affront to “Confucian” reason and its social function, that of driving a religious wedge into the social unity of the Oriental peoples in order to soften up their countries for invasion, occupation, and exploitation by the Occidental powers.">

<p>Samidare-sho</p>
<p>By Miura Baien</p>
<p>Translated by Leon Hurvitz, New York</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The Samidare-sho is a minor work of Miura Baien, one in  which he strays off his main field, namely, economics. It is a polemic against  Christianity in what the Japanese isolationists of the time regarded as its  two most pernicious aspects, viz., its affront to &ldquo;Confucian&rdquo; reason and its  social function, that of driving a religious wedge into the social unity of the  Oriental peoples in order to soften up their countries for invasion, occupation, and exploitation by the Occidental powers.</p>
<p>Miura Susumu __ (1723-1789) was born in the village of Kinetsuki Tominaga ;S_ 7 in Bungo M Province, the present Oita t$# Prefecture in  Kyushu hJl. His azana 4 was Yasusada %A, and, in addition to Baien, he  designated himself during his scholarly career by the following go R: Renzan  frLi, Dosen J,i}f, Kizan T{b, Tosen *ftj, Nishi-sanjin =t A, and Bujisai</p>
<p>shujin XWA46#. He got his initial training in the Cihinese classics, the basis  for all education in Japan at that time, under Ayabe Keisai VAKI$&quot;, an official  of the Matsudaira ta2 clan, in whose domain the Miura family dwelt, and  Fujita Keisho F, [Rff. Subsequently he went to Nagasaki, where he studied  astronomy, physics, philosophy, ethics, government, economics, medicine,  natural history, and linguistics. He devoted an entire lifetime to scholarship,  rejecting many offers on the part of various and sundry feudal lords to serve  them in an official capacity. Late in life, however, he accepted a position in  the service of his then lord, Matsudaira Chikakata tRT_. He established a  school within the domain and also served a s clan economist. It was during this  service that he died in his ancestral home at the age of sixty-six.</p>
<p>Baien&rsquo;s extant works are quite numerous, and were collected and edited as  a body for the first time in September 1912 by the Baienkai fg.Et (Baien  Society). For a brief biographical sketch the reader is referred to Nishimura  Tokihiko Nf, Gakkai no ijin g (Great Men of the Learned World,  Osaka 1911), pp. 5-48. For a description of his philosophical views one may  consult Takata Shinji Y Miura Baien no gakufu to Na;npo no jugaku</p>
<p>290 Leon Hurvitz</p>
<p>^^ikM t iE1 (Miura Bajen&rsquo;s Thought and the Confucianism of  Southern Bungo), in Kinsei Nippon no jugaku idfth * E (Japanese Confu cianism in Recent Times, T6kyo 1939), pp. 477-510. Neither of these accounts  is very satisfying in my opinion, but I recommend them faute de mieux.</p>
<p>This translation was originally submitted in partial fulfilment of the require ments for the M.A. in the Department of Chinese and Japanese, Columbia  University, New York. Except for a reduction in footnotes, the version appear ing here is substantially the same as the one submitted to Columbia. The in</p>
<p>spiration to translate the Samidare-sho came from Mr. R. Tsunoda A0pft,  Special Lecturer in Japanese History at Columbia, who mentioned the work in  the course of his lectures on the history of Japanese religion and thought. The  translation was motivated by the consideration that, while Western readers have  ample access to sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Christian judgments of Japan,  they have almost no access whatever to Japanese judgments of Christianity. The  Samidare-sho is perhaps not the best choice of a text for this purpose, having  been written in 1784, exactly a century and a half after the promulgation of the  Edict of Seclusion; on the other hand, it is interesting if only for the distortion  of Christianity perpetrated by a writer who had come into no direct contact with  the object of his polemics. But its principal value to Western readers lies  perhaps in the rationale used by a writer whose thinking was typical of the  ruling class of Tokugawa Japan to justify one of the most ruthless religious sup pressions in human history.</p>
<p>I have rendered the title Mussings Duiring the Early Summer Rain-samidare  being the name of the rain that falls in Japan during the fifth lunar month,  corresponding roughly to June in the Gregorian calendar.</p>
<p>The Sanmidare-sho isa rambling work, which at first blush would appear to  have no plan whatever. It consists of a Preface and two parts. I have num bered the paragraphs in my translation, and I give below a brief outline of the  contents with the corresponding paragraph numbers:</p>
<p>Preface</p>
<p>This gives Baien&rsquo;s supposed motive for composing this work. &ldquo;Look what  havoc Christianity has wrought in our land!&rdquo; says he in effect, who then goes  on to point out that this is the fruit of having dealings with Occidentals. The  suppression of Christiianity must remain in force, and Occidentals must be kept  out, he concludes.</p>
<p>Parat I</p>
<p>1-6: A rough description of the world with a breakdown into continents and  the principal religions of each.</p>
<p>7-10: The author singles out Christianity from among the religions just men tioned and describes its pernicious effects. Then he states his main thesis:  Christianity is the harbinger of Occidental imperialism in the Orient.  He gives some of the historical background of the Jesuits in China,  particularly P. Matteo Ricci, their writings, and the banning of their  works (and of all works however remotely connected with Christianity)</p>
<p>Samidare-sh6 291</p>
<p>from Japan.</p>
<p>11: The distinction between stable and unstable societies.</p>

<p>for a slovenly product, but the slovenliness is further compounded by the text  available in this edition, which is obviously reproduced without change from the  manuscript of a bad copyist. I had the opportunity to compare this text with  that of the Nippon shliso toso shiryoH Ifieg 14 (Historical Material on</p>
<p>Ideological Disputes in Japan), and in every disputed passage the latter invari ably had a clearer and more intelligible version. But as I did not have the  latter in my possession long enough to proof-read he former thoroughly, Ihave  made sense of the former to the best of my ability.</p>
<p>Of necessity there has had to be an extensive use of footnotes, which I have  tried to make as brief as possible. The Appepdix deals in somewhat greater  detail with the Chinese books banned from Japan by the Shogunate because of  their (real or alleged) connection with Christianity. The numbering of sub divisicons of the work is entirely my own. Anything in parentheses is part of  the original; anything in brackets is added by me for clarification.</p>

<p>Musings During the Early Summer Rain</p>
<p>Preface</p>
<p>Sitting in front of my window during the season of the early summer  rain, a season in which I have few visitors, and after perusing some books  written in kana,&rsquo;) I wrote as follows:</p>
<p>The hearts of the men of this world change as a thread when it is dyed,  or as a winding path. Depending on customs and teachings, there are some  who are enlightened, others who go astray. It is sad that some must correct  their errors and turn their misery into joy only to incur general disfavor, and  yet have the courage to adhere to their views. Alas!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But is this2) not the very thing we are forbidden to discuss?&rdquo; said  my child, who was nearby at the time.</p>
<p>To which I replied, &ldquo;As the ancientsaid, everything has its day. If  one always knew of the evil beforehand, who would ever repeat a mis take? Since error is the product of ignorance, to show how the front  carriage was overturned is to warn the rear carriage of the danger-is it  not? Although Occidental doctrines have become extinct for the time  being, one does indeed yet hear of persons who use insidious devices to  deceive others. They all followv previously established precedents. But  if we are aware of the records of the past, how can we be duped by their  evil designs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have heard that when Occidentals plan to seize another country  they consider direct military action an inferior method. Consequently,  in planning to conquer a cotuntry they first help the weak and restore the  poor to prosperity with gifts of gold, silver, grain, and cloth; then heal</p>

<p>the sick with medicine and beguile men&rsquo;s eyes and ears with their wiles;  finally bedevil their hearts with the doctrine of the Lord of Heaven and  the three worlds3) and make them think that these are infinitely more  precious than parents and rulers; and, when they see that their preach ing has had its effect, they follow it up with invasion, thereby achieving</p>
<p>their foul aim with one stroke.</p>
<p>For example, south of China there is in the midst of the sea an island  called Takasago ARiPJ [Formosa]. The Hollanders had already taken it,  but at the end of the Ming EH4) Dynasty they were driven out by Cheng  Ch&rsquo;eng-kung Wg:.5) They went further south to an island called  Carapa, where they leased land and, on the pretext of warding off</p>
<p>pirates, built a fortress. They then distributed trinkets among the  natives and wvaited for them to rise to the bait. Finally they succeeded  in taking territory as far as Java and establishing traffic among these  various countries.6)</p>
<p>Also, during the Kan&rsquo;ei 7 era [1624-1644] a barbarian named  Y6su7) memorialized the Court to the following effect: In former times,  the Occidentals, desiring to take the island of Luzon, first infested it  with missions, and in the course of time it easily fell into their hands.  Japan, being a land of much gold, silver, and treasure, had long been  the object of their covetous desires. The Court thereupon made a gift  of land to Yosu and, deciding that these were Japan&rsquo;s greatest enemies,  determined to cut them down root and branch. Offering rewards to  volunteers, it finally succeeded in clearing the seas.</p>
<p>Once, when I was visiting Keiho iR [Nagasaki], Yoshio Kogy&rsquo;u  1t)I+W ) told me that the Occidentals had recently succeeded in taking</p>

<p>A Ming loyalist who refused to do homage to the Ch&rsquo;ing j4 Dynasty (1644-  1911). The son of a Chinese father and a Japanese mother, he spent his boyhood in  Japan. After the establishment of the Ch&rsquo;ing he carved himself out a stronghold in  Kwangtung )*A and Fukien - Provinces, from which he invaded Formosa in 1661.  For his faithful service to the deposed dynasty, the Ming pretender conferred upon him  the Ming family name of Chu ;t. Hence he came to be known as Kuo-hsing-yeh W#  A (the old man with the imperial surname), which has been corrupted by Westerners</p>

<p>into Koxinga or Coxinga. His dates are 1624-1662.</p>

<p>There is an inaccuracy here, since Carapa is merely another name for Java.  7) Other versions of this name are Yorisu and Yarisu. I do not pretend to be  able to fathom the European name of which this is a corruption, but it is obvious from  the context that the author is referring to an apostate missionary, one of the remarkably  few who broke under torture at the time of the mass persecutions. The &ldquo;Court&rdquo; is the  Shogunate, not the Imperial Court.</p>

<p>The commotion made in our country about Jesus is part of the  same scheme. Although several hundred thousand murders and ex ecutions have taken place in connection with the suppression of  Christianity, the nation is coolly indifferent to it, but the scheme is  obvious. The West Country10) was led astray by it, and the Middle  Country11) was plagued by it for several decades, thanks to a mistake  made by Nobunaga12) on the spur of the moment. But fortunately the  Taiko Hideyoshi 7 exposed its evil nature, the Divine Lord14)  caught a glimpse of its evils, and the eyes and ears of the common people  were once again enabled to see and hear the truth. Therefore, even  books coming from China (to say nothing of the Western lands them selves), if they but have the name of Christ on them, are blotted out  with ink and thrown to the flames.</p>
<p>However, during the incumbency of Yuttokuin-dono tW RU,l5) in  response to a request from the Bureau of Astronomy, books merely men tioning these matters were permitted. People began to read Occidental  books, and works on such subjects as astronomy, geography, botany, and  physiology were translated and published. The stern warning of the  Divine Ancestor alternated with the toleration of forbidden books by  hlis descendant, and we have enjoyed the grace of both simultaneously.</p>

<p>Consequently, in writing this tract to beguile the lonely hours of the  early summer rain, I do not necessarily expect anyone to read it; I only  feel that there can be no harm in thus utilizing time that would other wise go completely to waste. I leave it on my desk with the feeling that  I can have no greater satisfaction than that someone may see it and,  absorbing its lessons, take warning for the future.</p>

For a detailed study of his activities see Tsuji Zennosuke d -f1}j, Nippon  Bukky6shi Kenkya E Zokuhen, Chap. XIII. The Nanzenji ii4E, in  which he had his Ky6to headquarters, is one of the five great Zen temples of that city.

<p>South America. If one were to dig from Asia straight through the  globe, one would come out to the east of this continent.  2. Europe is also known as the Occident. Since it is more than a  myriad of leagues distant from our country, we do not even hear rumors  of it. However, in that land science and technology are extremely  advanced. Its learned men are thoroughly versed in astronomy and  geography; they have calculated the positions of the sun, the moon, and  the stars; they can determine the location of their own ships on the high  seas and chart a precise course with a compass; in short, they have the  myriad-leagued ocean in the palm of their hand. They travel back and  forth freely to foreign countries, tempting the inhabitants with the lure  of profits, breeding confusion for them with their false doctrines, and  seizing their countries when the time is ripe. At such times they acquire  a base from which to operate, transport and store up their merchandise,  and trade with other countries. Under such conditions the South Sea  Islands have all become the possessions of Occidental countries.  3. The &ldquo;southern barbarians,&rdquo; i.e., India and the South Sea Islands,  are all part of Asia. Asia is a land wvhich accepts the teachings of Con fucius and Sakya.</p>

<li>In Europe during the Middle Ages a certain Jesus made his  appearance and founded a doctrinal system.

Jesus  was later killed by Judas, but his teachings gradually spread. The reli</li>

<p>gions of that land are three in number, viz., Christianity, the doctrine  of Jesus (from which the Japanese word Kirishitan is derived); Moham medanism, the religion of the Moguls; and Heathen or Gentile.

<li>To the west of Asia is the country called Arabia, and to the east  of it is the country called Hui-hui IBd &lsquo;, known in T&rsquo;ang Jh times as  Hui-ku [M4&rsquo;l.

Hui-hui and  Hui-ku (ca. the T&rsquo;ang Dynasty, 618-907, the latter would have been pronounced some thing like khwai-got or khwai-gut) are both Chinese attempts to reproduce the name  Uighur, a people which now inhabits all of Sinkiang. The Uighurs were islamized ca.  the fourteenth century, and by late Ming U all traces of Buddhism in Uighur territory  would have vanished.

<p>&ldquo;Master K&rsquo;ung,&rdquo; K&rsquo;ung being the Sage&rsquo;s family name) and explained to him that in  his Christian opinion the Confucianists were atheists. For more on the Uighur question,  see Wittfogel &amp; Feng ;Xj, History of Chinese Society, Liao a (907-1125), p. 92, n. 8.</p>

<p>(36) Ti-wei Ri (one work in two volumes). Burned in the fiftl  month of the third year of Jokyo [1686]. This book, an atlas  of the world, praises the Christian countries and has one or  two references to the cult of Jesus. Therefore it was burned.  However, since it was not a book on doctrine, the title and  maps were submitted to higher authority.</p>
<p>(37) Fu-chien t&rsquo;utng-clih 1h (one work in six volumes). Ihis  book was burned in the sixth month of the third year of J8kyo  [1686] because it had a picture of the Lord of Heaven in it.</p>

In an appendix to  the preface are references to Li T&rsquo;ai-hsi TIMN and the titles of  several forbidden books.

<p>The above are all books which were to be blotted out and thrown to  the flames in the Jokyo, Genroku, and Hoei eras [1684-1711], and were  not to be used by scholars under any circumstances. They include any thing dealing with ritual or doctrine, or even making a passing refer ence to the subject. When the prohibition was strictly enforced, for  example, the following books were prohibited: (a) Stt-chou fu-chih,  because, although it has no reference to doctrine, the chapter on  Emperor Shih-tsu-chang Atfl ]j 35) mentions the Rites Controversy; (b)  Aling-chia shih-kuan, because there is a poem in it dedicated to the  Occidental T&rsquo;ang Jo-wang MTS; (c) Fang-ch&rsquo;eng-lun, because it has  chapter-headings on Occidental mathematics and famous forbidden  Occidental books. In short, anything with even an allusion was de stroyed, and anything with a reference to religious&rsquo; doctrine was burned.  However, since the Bureau of Astronomy begged exemption from this  prohibition on the grounds that Occidental books, which were advanced  in matters of astronomy and geography, had much that was of value, in  the second year of Kyoh6o o [1717] the ban was lifted on books con taining mere allusions, while it remained in force where religious doc trine was concerned. At that time the following specific titles were re moved from the original list: T&rsquo;ien-wen-liieh ; Chiao-yu-lun 3U-mfS  Chi-ho yiian-pen *Jirjq, T&rsquo;ai-hsi shui-fa 7 Chih-fang wai-chi</p>

<p>In the fourth and fifth volumes of this work, respectively, reference is  made to a church and to the grave of Li Ma-tou. In the passage on the  !church mention is made of a house for the worship of Jesus and of Jesus&rsquo; life  and death.

<p>However, the subject matter of the entire Ching-wu-liieh is a description  of Peking and vicinity. Therefore, with the exception of the two volumes  just mentioned, there is no mention of Jesus anywhere in the book.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the abovementioned two volumes themselves there is no  mention of religious teaching or of proselytization. In the poem praising  this man it is his learning and skill, his virtue and accomplishments, that  are praised.

<p>In all countries customs differ. First of all, there are dochaku  ?X and kokoku 4SK.37) China and Japan, for example, are dochaku:  their people are of the kind that are satisfied with their land, build  houses and walls, and live in them. Kokoku are those societies which  do not have a fixed abode, but which, in accordance with time and op portunity, dwell where it suits them best. China, Japan, and similar  countries determine their boundaries and remain within them. Extra territorial quests are characterized by them as aggression, and are con demned. The Occidental countries, on the other hand, regard all  the confines of the seas as a single unit, and, undaunted by the greatest  distances, evince a greedy desire for profitable trade with all countries,  which they treat as vassal states. Wishing to seize other countries, they  play upon mankind&rsquo;s natural desire for gain in order to win sympathy  for themselves. The rebellion fomented by the followers of Jesus in  our country also can be traced to the employment of these means.</p>

<p>Ryuizo6ji sent him one of them. He, like the others, was a European.  Since he had come by way of the southern barbarian lands [Jap.  namban], he was referred to here as Namban. The person&rsquo;s name was  tlrugan Bateren. (Bateren means &ldquo;teacher,&rdquo; while the word for &ldquo;dis</p>
<p>ciple&rdquo; is said to be iruman.)40) In the ninth month of the eleventh year  of Eiroku AKA [1568] he met Nobunaga. When asked through an inter preter why he had come, he replied that his purpose was to spread  Buddhism in Japan. (The fact of the matter is that he had been sent  from his own country to take our country.) Nobunaga, taking a fancy</p>
<p>to his strange appearance, permitted him to stay and expressed a desire  to see him perform his missionary duties. The Confucian scholar Dosen  LA@ff, of the Tenkeiin t ,41) said, &ldquo;His ceremonial and garb are neither  Shintoist nor Buddhist. One day he may breed misfortune for us all.  It would be best to send him back whence he came.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other courtiers agreed. Nobunaga, however, replied, &ldquo;In  antiquity the teachings of Buddha, which did not originate in our  country, were brought here from abroad-were they not? Let him be,  for I wish to see how he conducts himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, he ordered Sugenoya Kuemon Nagahide Vi@Xt W J3:  to confer upon the stranger a piece of land of four cho ET42) at Shijo RlY{  Gate in Kyoto, and to permit him to go about his business there. His  country knew that our country had much gold and silver, and, since he  had come for the purpose of conquering our country, his king had given  him whatsoever valuable gifts he desired. Telescopes and magnifying  glasses were among the gifts he presented to Nobunaga when he first  m-yet him.</p>

<p>In this church, since Heaven was the object of their worship,  there was no image. Since the religious service, which made use of  ornaments of many precious materials and a brocade canopy, was an  unusual one, people came from everywhere to see it. The priests, un moved by this, sent men out everywhere to find and bring to them beg gars and outcasts lying in alleyways or at the foot of bridges, persons who  had been rejected from society because of their diseases and were dying  of hunger in their destitution. They would bathe their filthy bodies,  give them decent food, fresh clothes, and a clean place to sleep, treat  them with the costliest medicines, and care for them diligently. In this  way most of them were cured, while those who died were given decent  burial. To the poor they gave fresh food and boiled hot water for their  bath, washed them, gave them money, and sent them home, so that the  present was in fact happier for them than the prospect of Buddhahood.</p>

<p>At length, when they saw that men&rsquo;s hearts were inclined in  their direction, they preached as follows: &ldquo;Our country venerates and  calls upon the name of the Lord of Heaven; therefore there are no poor  in our country.

<p>Written by Fujiwara no Sanekata jf,W; (d. 908), the poem is very popular  in Japan to this day. Baien&rsquo;s meaning is that the ibukiyomogi, reputed to have origi nated with these missionaries, is not to be confused with the ibukimogusa referred to  in the above poem, a. species going back at least to the ninth century, when the poem  was written.</p>

<p>So saying, they brought out what they called the Mirror of the  Three Worlds and showed it to the populace. The people looked and  saw strange and terrifying reflections of horses, oxen, and imaginary  demons, which caused their liver and spirit to take leave of their bodies,  as it were.</p>
</li>

<p>&ldquo;WVe have escaped the illnesses of this life, to be sure, thanks to  the mercy of the King and the Lord of Heaven, but how sad that we  must be the victims of such woes as these in the future!&rdquo; exclaimed all  of them in tears, adding, &ldquo;We pray you to rescue us from these evils as  well! &quot;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In that case, be converted to our faith,&rdquo; said they, and, giving  them rosaries of forty-two beads, taught them the proper incantations.  WVhen they had fasted for seven days, reciting the rosary all the while,  they were given another look at the mirror. This time the reflection</p>

He who worships the Lord  of Heaven but once, though he should be stretched on the rack, roasted  over a flame, or suffer torture through the use of water, fire, oxen, or  carts, would suffer them but ephemerally; whereas in the future he would  have the joy of eternal salvation. If you think on these things thus  without allowing your spirits to be crushed by your tormentors, we shall  permit you to see the Blessed Vision.&rdquo;</p>

<p>their hands with the blood, they clasped them and worshipped, saying,  &ldquo;Though we were to suffer such pain as this for the sake of the Lord of  Hleaven, we should have no regrets. In time to come, save us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moreover, news of an armed rebellion was rife everywhere. In the sixth  year of Tensho [1578] it was heard that Takayama Ukon ,Ajti;L52) had  aligned himself with the rebels.

When Nobunaga was asked to take the  field in person, one thing or another delayed him, and it was rumored  that this was the first act of cowardice in his life. Nobunaga, giving the  whole matter profound thought, remembered that Takayarna was a  believer in Jesus. Calling the priests, he said, &ldquo;It is the height of dis loyalty on your part to side with Takayama Ukon. If your sect is the  guardian of righteousness, it is your duty to make him my ally, since he  is a follower of yours. If you cannot, your worthless sect deserves to be  destroyed.&ldquo;58)</p>

<p>The priests, in alarm, talked to Takayama, who, being a devout  believer, quickly made peace with Nobunaga. When Nakagawa did  likewise, the Honganji forces abandoned Ishiyama HW Castle, and  Mori&rsquo;s forces quieted down. Nobunaga, as a result of this exploit,  found himself in the same situation as before, and, as he did not inter fere with the new sect, it is said to have become even more widespread.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the sixth month of the tenth year of the same era [1582]  Nobunaga died, and Hideyoshi took over the military power. Being  made aware of the evil practices of these priests, he destroyed their  church in the thirteenth year [1585]. This was eighteen years after the  eleventh year of Eiroku. In this space of time forty-two principal  churches and innumerable subsidiary churches had been erected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reasons for his actions were as follows: When Hideyoshi  was living in Yodo it Castle, a skilled craftsman named Nakai Hambee  rPt4Af, taking the Taiko&rsquo;s tklj fancy, was made official in charge of  repairs. Inasmuch as he was the best of all such craftsmen in the world  at the time, his reputation spread. The priests, wishing to win him  over, sent Fabian to see him.

So they invited a [Zen] layman  named Byaku6o r1, of Yanagi-no-Baba 0P0,), Shijo-dori Elj.</p>
<p>to argue with Fabian. Fabian, castigating the teachings of Buddha,  said, &ldquo;The object of veneration in our sect is a Buddha named Deus,  wvho appeared before there was anything between Heaven and Earth,  created all things, including the sun and moon, human beings, birds and</p>
<p>beasts, grass and trees; who created the world and saved mankind.  Therefore, if one put one&rsquo;s faith in this Buddha, there is none whom  he will not save.

<p>Byakuo, who had been listening all the while with his head  inclined, waited for Fabian to finish, then replied, &ldquo;If what you say is  true, then the same applies to the religion of your Deus.

Bhiksu (Skt. &ldquo;mendicant&rdquo;) is the normal designation for a Buddhist  monk, since all members of the old Buddhist community used to beg for their food.  Amaterasu 0-mikami, the Heaven-Illuminating Great August Deity, is the dean of the  Shint6 &ldquo;E pantheon. Hachiman (orig. Yawata) is the Japanese war god. When  Buddhism and Shint6 came to be grafted together into one religious organism he was  given the title Bosatsu, an abbreviation of Bodaisatta (Ch. p&rsquo;u-t&rsquo;i-sa-t&rsquo;o, fr. Skt.

Seventeen years later, on the twenty third day of the eighth month in the tenth year of Eiroku [25 September  1567], one of the &ldquo;black ships&rdquo; entered Nagasaki for the first time. Since  this was an age of civil disturbance, with no one about to set it right,  foreign ships could enter the country at will,68) and in the third year of  Genki 7C [1572] they built a settlement. Thereafter votaries of the  cult of Jesus entered our country from the lands of the southern bar barians and, giving the people gold and silver and displaying magical  arts to them, deceived them. Within eleven years of the end of the  Genki era [i.e., ca. 1573], by about the ninth year of Tensho [1581], this,  doctrine had gradually spread, and everyone was a Christian.

The reason the  devotees of this cult welcomed death [the report went on to say] was  that they were seeking the invisible bliss of a future life. Since their  impending banishment had been made known in Macao, over a hundred  persons had come from there to Nagasaki to meet them. Then Fuji</p>
<p>hiro had piled them all aboard ship and let them go. Matsuura Hizen no-Kami Takanobu g&rsquo;ffiEjri{JcXr82) of Hirado 1P, heading a group of  officers and men, was sent through the Nagasaki area, Takaki-gun Ai*i,  Arima . and the vicinity, raiding the homes of the followers of Jesus,  arresting and imprisoning those who from their possession of icons were  obviously profound believers, and warning and restoring to Buddhism  those whose faith was wavering. He was kept in Nagasaki to maintain  order. In the twelfth month of the same year there was peace between  Osaka and the Kanto.83) On the twentieth day of the same month [19  January 1615] Fujihiro reported that the cult of Jesus had been eradi cated in Hizen. From then- on, men became more peaceful in their  inclinations. (The annals have &ldquo;Luzon&rdquo; where the Hennen has  &ldquo;Macao.&rdquo; The Hennen is probably right.)</p>

They are also  hardy and skilled in naval combat. In addition, they are good sword smiths, making blades renowned the world over. The southwestern lands  all fear this country, and consider her people pirates. The king, dis pleased with this reputation, ordered a cessation of overseas commerce  and would not permit his subjects to go to sea at their own pleasure.  This country originally practiced the cult of Heaven and observed its  Ten Commandments, a violation of which was considered the most  terrible of crimes. But when the king divorced his wife and married  his mistress, the Pope in Rome, considering this a violation of the  Commandments, severed all relations with him. In the spring of the  fifth year of Keicho [1600] men of this country arrived on the same ship  with some Hollanders at Sakai Bay in Izumi Province. There is an  age-old tradition that the Hollanders were first able to put out to sea  by having these men aboard; it may be true.

<p>The western barbarians are entrenched in the old establishments of Malacca, Java, Luzon, and other places, all of which they won by an  appeal to the profit motive. The Occidental ships lade themselves with  treasures and rare and valuable things and ask the right to establish  trading posts in key areas. The barbarians always thrive on liawlessness  and poor border defenses. Then, pleading defense against pirates and  natural calamities, they ask permission to build earthworks in order to  protect their merchandise. When they have built their fortresses and  distributed their troops throughout them, they secretly invite attacks by  our enemies. This is where their profit lies, and this is what their privi leges come to. The rich man thereby increases his wealth, while the  poor man relies on these schemes for his food and clothing, and they  make a display of kindness and authority simultaneously.

<p>eleven descendants of the red-haired ones were discovered and sent to  Carapa. Foreign shipping having been excluded, as has been mentioned  above, in the following year, the seventeenth [1640], a ship came from  Macao and asked to trade. Displeased that the local authorities and the  national laws had been so brazenly flouted, the officials questioned the  more than seventy members of the crew. Thirteen who were found to  have been tricked into coming were spared, but the other sixty-one were  beheaded. Their ship was burned, and the survivors were given an  abandoned Chinese junk in which to sail back whence they had come.  Nevertheless, twelve years later, in the twelfth year of Shoh6,&lsquo;10) two  ships, constructed like men-of-war and apparently carrying only military  equipment and battle rations, arrived from Macao. The lords of</p>

Our military defenses being of the high order  previously described, the barbarians were frightened, and merely said  that the criminal entry of the ship of the year before had not been  ordered by their king, and that therefore they wished to apologize and  once more ask for trade. They were merely relieved of their military  equipment and sent back. Twenlty-eight years later, in the second year  of Jokyo [1685], a ship from Macao, adrift off Jinryo 0 $* village in</p>

Furthermore, the Taiko Hideyoshi died in the third  year of Keicho [1598], after the campaigns in Korea and in an age  when things were still not quiet. Then, in the fifth year of the same  era [1600] came the battle of Seki-ga-Hara,l) after which Ishida and  the others were put to death. Thereafter there was no strife for fif-  teen years. In the nineteenth year of Keicho [1614] and the first year  of Genna [1615] were the winter and summer campaigns of Osaka,  since which time the Empire has enjoyed uninterrupted peace for one  hundred and seventy years. However, in the Chinzei2) was the Shima-  bara Rebellion, which lasted from the fourteenth year of Kan&rsquo;ei [1637]  until the spring of the following year [1638].

<p>In and around the abovementioned Takaki-gun ,iAci the in-  fluence of Jesus was strong. During the Keicho era [1596-1615]  the lord of Hara W, Castle, Arim! Saemon-no-Suke Yastuzumi -.,  ;Sk$WMOR)MV) received a command to move to Agata pw Castle &ldquo;in  Hyu&rsquo;ga. However, there was a report that such a- move would be  difficult in view of the fact that most of his retainers were followers  of Jesus. Therefore Yamaguchi Tajima-no-Kamni W ii!E.hP9 and Mamiya  Gonzaemon MBg90AA were commanded to go front the bay of Sakai  *, in Izumi l7, Province, to Hara Castle to investigate the evil sect,  and to gather armies from all the provinces to crush them if their  power should prove to be great. Consequently, Yamaguchi seized  all the votaries of the evil cult from Takaki-gun&rsquo; and sent them to  Nagasaki, where they were executed on the western slope. Their  bodies were then buried together and a mound was constructed over  them. Nabeshima, Terazawa, Omura, Arima Yasuzumni, and the other  lords sent officers and men to burn all the Christian churches, and  Hasegawa Fujihiro *i11IAg completed his investigation.</p>

<p>This Yasuzumi was the son of Arima Shuri-tayui Naozumni TM,  40501AkMVR.6) While lord of Arima Castle in Takaki-gun, he sent  a ship- to Cochin-China in quest of kara [aquilaria agallocha]. Some  men of Macao seized this ship and killed its crew of fifty. In the  fourteenth year of Keicho [1609] over two hundred men of Macao  came to Nagasaki. Someone heard them mention the above incident  and reported the fact to Naozumi. Naozumi, unable to contain him-  self, reported the matter to the central authorities and, seizing the  captain, interrogated him. It was his intention tot kill the guilty  persons, but the barbarians, early becoming aware of this fact; put to  sea in flight. They were pursued and their ship was completely &lsquo;burned.</p>

He served in the field against both Konishi Yukinaga  ,j%04jKp and the Shimabara rebels. He married one of Ieyasu&rsquo;s adopted daughters.</li>

<p>At this time Honda Kozuke-no-Suke Masazumi ; :IEX7)  had a yoriki8) named Okamoto Daihachi ;I*AJk. He was a close  friend of Naozumi, but tricked him by saying that Kozuke-no-Suke  had stated, in effect, that there would be a reward forthcoming for  the burning of the barbarian ship. Naozumi, overjoyed, gave Dai-  hachi a very large sum of money and improved his lot in every way.  However, when it became obvious that this was merely a trick on Dai-  hachi&rsquo;s part, he was imprisoned and beheaded at Abegawara. While  in prison, Daihachi accused Naozumi of plotting to assassinate Hase-  gawa Fujihiro.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From this it was discovered that Arima belonged to the cult  of Jesus, and he was put to death in Tsuru-gun MINX in Kai EY5 Pro-  vince. His eldest son, Saemon Yasuzumi, fifteen years old at the time,  had long been in the service of Daitokuin-dono , and not under  the influence of Christianity, hence he was given forty thousand koku  and succession to the Arima fief, where he prosecuted the followers of  Jesus.</p>

<p>The lordship of Nagato was conferred upon the elder Matsukura  Bungo-no-Kami Shigemasa , a former retainer of Tsutsui  Junkei R14JIIi9) and a fearless fighter, who, for taking the first enemy  head in the Osaka summer campaign, was given an income of fifty  thousand koku at Shimabara. On the grounds that he must suppress  rebellion in a country infested, as his was, with Christians, he was re-  lieved of his duties in Edo. Shigemasa, upon obtaining- his fief, con-  ducted a thorough investigation, and every day five or ten persons  would be arrested and decapitated, burned to death, or sawed in two  with a bamboo saw. Subjected to such severe treatment, the sect was.  speedily exterminated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shigemasa was fond of military exploits; he was good to his,  warriors and provided for them well. He sent two of his retainers,  Yoshioka Kuemon -&amp;tmA&rsquo;mm and Kimura Gonnojo, t*#CS os-  tensibly as traders, to Luzon, to observe the situation there. On the  basis of their observations, he reported to Edo that the Occidentals.  had taken Luzon, from Luzon they had branched out to the lands of  the southern barbarians, and from there they were eyeing Japan.</p>

<p>Therefore it was possible that our country might be endangered.  Shigemasa requested permission to attack Luzon with his own forces  and stem the tide of barbarian invasion there, but before a reply was  received he died and was succeeded by Shigetsugu.10)</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>
<p>Shigetsugu was addicted to over-indulgence in food and drink,  and took no heed of his warriors. Consequently, in the twelfth year  of Kan&rsquo;ei [1635] forty-eight of his warriors left -him. Such being the  case, his people also despised and hated him, and so brought about  this rebellion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At this time Konishi Settsu-no-Kami Yukinaga +1&rsquo; i$1ITF-R-  had a retainer named Masuda Jimbee Yoshitsugu *MgR W&rsquo;k. After  Konishi&rsquo;s eclipse he floated aimlessly about Higo Province, but, not  satisfied with the prospect of sinking into oblivion among the local  people, he bethought himself of ways and means of reviving the for-  tunes of his house. Having decided that for winning over men&rsquo;s  hearts and establishing a following there were no better prospects than  among the Christians, he went throughout the Amakusa and Takaki  areas, deceiving the people and persuading them to do his bidding.  Thereafter people would set up icons and worship them privately, but  when large groups gathered together for that purpose there was no con-  cealing the fact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once a large group, old and young, gathered at the home of  one Sashiki Saemon iwiX and, setting up an icon, worshipped  it.. The daikan ftA 11) heard of this and went to the place in ques-  tion, where, in great anger, he rebuked the populace for violating the</p>

<p>law; and, seizing the icon, broke it and trod upon it. The towns-  people, enraged, beat the daikan to death. Thereafter daikan were  killed in many places, and then the rebels of Takaki and Amakusa  rose up at once. Having some successes in their initial battles, they  finally attacked Tomioka Castle in Amakusa and Shimabara Castle in  Takaki. This was in the winter of the fourteenth year of Kan-ei [1637].</p>

<li>The leader, Jimbee, had a son named Shiro, who was treach-  erous, brave and intelligent. Being a person of some slight education,  he was called Shiro-tay&rsquo;u Tokisada.

<p>-abroad in the world. The members of this sect, concluding that this  Shiro was that very person, called him Heaven&rsquo;s messenger and made  him their general, although he was in reality nothing more than- a  superb scoundrel. He could,- for example, make a bird land in his  hand and lay an egg there, and do similar things to blind men&rsquo;s vision  -and lead them astray, so that the common people looked up to and  revered him as an authority on the supernatural, and his followers  grew to the tens of thousands.</p>

<p>When this was heard in the Kanto, the central authorities  sent- down Itakura Naizen-no-ShM [Shigemasa] ;l E Ili: as daikan  and Ishitani Juzo 0 f? as metsuke.13) When the rebels heard this,  they repaired the abandoned castle of Arima and all took refuge in it.  Itakura gathered the generals &lsquo;of all Kyushu and fought against them  several times, but was unsuccessful.

<p>At a place called Itakayauma there is a Christian chief called Hatsuwa.23)  He sends priests to all countries to propagate the faith. Following Hatsuwa&rsquo;s  commands they hasten to send governors and make laws for the newly  acquired areas. New Spain is Luzon. In his greed, Hatsuwa has taken  many countries. Since Japan is very hard to take by military measures alone,  his intention is to send priests to expand the cult of the Hereafter.</p>
<p>One of those arrested was Kurokawa Juan ,JI!J-T.24) He said that  he had long meant to come to Japan. In addition, I have heard that  -five or six Japanese boys are studying at Luzon, twelve at Macao, all  to become priests and to be sent to Japan. The priests take a survey  of all countries. When they were due to come to Japan, at a time  when Christianity was spreading, gold and silver were sent to the  Japanese Christians, and brothers were sent to the various Buddhist  temples to study the different sects and to learn the principles of  -Buddhism and Shinto. Then they were sent to Hatsuwa, at whose  command these things were translated into the language of the southern  barbarians and printed, and sent to the priests everywhere to be&rsquo;learned.  In every case the plan was to propagate their religion and win people  to their side.</p>

Finally,  in gratitude for the nation&rsquo;s kindness to them, the priests joined the:  Zen sect and made a written declaration of faith.26) Their Japanese  guides were all executed and their heads exposed, and the ship they  came in was burned. The yashiki in lida-machi had a stone wall one  j6,27) two shaku high and a screen one shaku high all round, with a  picket fence the points of whose nails faced inward and a constant  guard night and day.

<p>According to the Hito senki, the suppression of Christianity-  was as follows: In Hideyoshi&rsquo;s time complaints came from representa-  tives of all the Buddhist sects to the effect that the rise of this new  sect was coming to mean the destruction of temples and pagodas. In.  the fourth year of Bunroku [1595] Hideyoshi issued an order com-  pletely banning the new religion, but the matter passed without even  an investigation. The Tosh6ogu, perceiving the evil, appointed Honda-  Sado-no-Kami Masanobu I 28) and Kozuke-no-Kami Masa-  zumi L:W-fiER his official representatives in this matter, while Okubo  Sagami-no-Kami Tadachika ~1A ,,%29) went to the Capital, took  the traitors in hand, and prornulgated the ban diligently to all the  people of all the provinces.</p>

<p>The Butoku hennen also contains an account of this, stating  that in the second month of the eighteenth year of Keicho [16131 the  followers of Jesus were found in isolated instances within the Capital.  Okubo Sagami-no-Kami Tadachika, hearing of this, went to the Capital  and ordered that they must all be cleaned out. Consequently, in the  first month of the year following Tadachika&rsquo;s visit to the Capital, the  Christians of the Capital, of Osaka, and of Sakai were seized and sent  to Nagasaki for questioning.

The Divine Lord, regretting this feature  in a brave warrior, frequently lectured him on the subject, but could  not shake him out of his intoxication. Ultimately he was executed.  This was in-the nineteenth year of Keicho [1614]. At this time there  was a person named Hara Mondo Yi7J1*, a Christian of long standing.  He was captured, but he escaped and covered up his tracks.

A person who had been brought up  under his care was banished on the grounds that he could be expected  to act perversely. It became known that this person had harbored  Heinai -TN, son of Oka Echizen-no-Kami Sadatsuna RM;11MR. An in-  vestigation revealed that Sadatsuna had had no knowledge of the&rsquo; mat-  ter. Heinai had been the son-in-law of Akashi Kamon Matataka</p>
<p>a hanger-on of the Ukida T-M* family. When Ukida  Hideie , had been defeated at Seki-ga-Hara, Akashi Kamon  expostulated with him, saying that he was prepared to withdraw to  his own territory of Okayama in Bizen, defy the forces of the entire  Empire, and die in battle. Hideie, agreeing, returned to his own  territory. His staff had already left, taking with them the things  that the villagers and townspeople had stored up in the castle. Hideie  withdrew to Ashi-no-Mori A, and, invited by Kamon Hideyori 0-R  3f, took refuge with Goto Matabee I,5!&rsquo; and others. (This is the  account given in the Ochiboshui Mg.)53)</p>

<p>Akashi Hara, and Oka had all been deeply involved in the  cult of Jesus. On this basis Sadatsuna was pardoned and Heinai was  transferred to another fief.

<p>According to the Sairan igen, the Occident is the land of  Europe. The people are referred to as &ldquo;southern barbarians&rdquo; be-  cause Occidental ships come hither by way of Luzon. It is said that  the reason they are called &ldquo;black ships&rdquo; is that they are smeared wvith  pine-tar. In the tenth year of Temmon [1541] they came for the  first time to Bungo. (Research reveals that this account differs as to  the year with the Nagasaki annals.) Their passenger was the famous  Portuguese missionary Francis Xavier,36) referred to in the Chinese  records as Fu-lai Shih-ktt-che . In the twelfth year of the same  era [1543] he arrived at Tane-ga-Shima + 1 in Satsuma J. The  Murashukusha mentioned in the Afamnpo bunshi&rsquo;t %jW 37) is none  other than this person. In spring of the twelfth year of Tensho  [1584] he sent one Wasada Genza Mtffl-ffE from Bungo.38) This per-  son had originally been a member of the Saito clan of M\Iino i9&rsquo;.  He went to the Occident, taking his children with him, and died in  Rome. His grave is now to be seen at Rome and the Roman, Gio-  vanni Battista Sidotti, is said to have showed a picture of it to Arai  Chikugo-no-Kami VOXMVt. In the fifteenth year of Tensho [1587],  when the Taiko went down to Tsukushi, he was so ei+raged bv  these missionaries&rsquo; disrespectful conduct that he barred them from the  land. However, business being its usual self, the greedy pursued their  selfish interests, fools were led astray by the doctrines, and the whole  affair led ultimately to a total of two hundred and eighty thousand  deaths.</p>

<p>Luzon is ruled by the Occidental land of Spain. During the  Keicho era [1596-1615] a letter was received from there and gifts were  conferred upon its bearers, but the letter was from the Spanish Gov-  ernor, not the King of Luzon. Goa is ruled over by an official sent  from the European land of Portugal, who rules over Macao simul-  taneously. Carapa belongs to Holland. In addition, there is, among-  the lands of the southern barbarians, a land called New Holland. It  seems that this land was named after Holland. Beneath our country  is a land called America. Part of this land was taken by the European  land of Spain, and is called New Spain. In this way, when they see  that a country has no defenses, they take it over by means of gold,  silver, food, drink, and fine clothes. The Tosh&rsquo;ogu, who ruled our  country then, in his wisdom perceived this fact well, and the people  thus were fortunately able to receive the light of the sun and the  moon.44) In the first year of Kan&rsquo;ei [1624] Spain sent an envoy with  tribute. All three hundred in the party being worshippers of the  Lord of Heaven, the tribute was rejected. The entire affair is dealt  with in the Gojiryaku.</p>

<p>rulers of our country afford to be ignorant of their trickery?  40 In general, these missionaries were somewhat like Buddhist  priests; but they regarded their Lord of Heaven as the Creator, and  appeared to preach the doctrine of the three worlds to convert men.  The reason, as given in the Ha-kirishitan RJIA:), is that according to  Christianity a Buddha named Deus is lord of Heaven and Earth, and  creator of Heaven and Earth and all things. Since he gave no real  soul to animals, when their bodies die their souls die together with  them, but to man Deus gave a real soul, so that when his body perishes  his soul does not. One receives bliss or woe according to the good-  ness or badness of one&rsquo;s present life. A person of good deeds is sent  to a world- of endless bliss called paradiso, while a person of evil deeds  is sent down to a world of woe called inferno. In Japan they worship  the sun and the moon, which they are said to characterize as the lamps  created by Deus for the world.</p>

<p>In the venerable Hakuseki&rsquo;s Sairan igen, in the section on  Rome, is the statement that the king of that country is the chief of  the religion, that his clerical garb is called ruricho [rubric?] and re-  sembles the samhghd.ti of Western India.45) In viewing the religion as  a whole, one sees that their clergy has a distinctive garb, that they  set up a particular object of worship called the Lord of Heaven, preach  the doctrine of the three worlds, and distinguish Paradise and Hell.  Hence it is obvious that their -religion is far different from the Way  of the Sage.46)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Way of the Sage does indeed worship and venerate  Heaven, to&rsquo;be sure, but it is based exclusively on a doctrine of human  ethics. To draw an analogy for a moment, the object of the Con-  fucianist&rsquo;s respect is Confucius. Now if, for example, a wicked ruler  were to destroy the temples of the Sage, smash his images, and shut  down the schools, responsible persons would do everything in their  power to reproVe and correct him. If he still refused to heed their  admonitions, but went about doing as before, persons devoted to Con-  fucianism would either leave his service when they saw their oppor-  tunity or would reprove him further by committing suicide. But there</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>would scarcely be anyone who, calling his lord his enemy, would aim  his bow at him. Moreover, if foreigners were to invade our country  -with statues of Confucius and the Sages at the head of their army,  then persons devoted to Confucianism would line up their spears and</p>

</ol>
<p>Samidare-sh6 345</p>
<p>defend themselves resolutely against the invaders in battle. The reason  is that the doctrine of the Sage demands that one treat one&rsquo;s father  as a father and one&rsquo;s lord as a lord, and that one have no object of  veneration exclusive of them.</p>
<ol start="43">
<li>
<p>This foreign cult makes use of man&rsquo;s love of profit to lead  him in the direction of greed. It sets up a system of bliss and woe,  reward and punishment in the hereafter, and, exploiting men&rsquo;s fears  and predilections, creates a being more venerable than lord and father.  Taking advantage of human desires, it offers a tempting bait in a  vague after-life, ensnares men in their own ignorance, and breeds in  them an inclination to cast aside their lords for their own selfish sakes.  Then, when they see their opportunity, they make plans to seize our  country. Since childhood I have had doubts about Heaven and Earth,  sufficient to cause me loss of sleep and meals, but, knowing that there  is order and method in the Universe, I have been released from the net  of doubt about life, death, and mysterious.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Occident seems to excel in unusual skills and to be very  advanced in astronomy and geography, but it would appear that they  are acquainted with the rough matter and know nothing about crea-  tion. The reason is that they place the Lord of Heaven in the posi-  tion of Creator. The realm -of the Creator, according to this view,  stands completely apart from the rest of the Universe. Though they  have a theory of cause and effect in the three worlds, though they  distinguish a world of bliss and a world of woe, they do not know how  to view things properly. Theirs is the error of seeing Heaven and Earth  from the standpoint of man, instead of seeing man from the stand-  point of Heaven and Earth. Although it is true that there is nothing  more venerable in the world than Heaven, its likeness is not to be made  to conform to clay images or wooden idols. In Christianity, it is not  a virtue to beget, nor a crime to kill; not a disgrace to be lowly, nor  an honor to be wealthy; there is no lord with whom to side, nor any  being to oppose. When we venerate Heaven, we fear Heaven&rsquo;s ma*  jesty, we obey its rules, we wait upon its commands. Hence, as a  subject one dies for loyalty, as a son one dies for filial piety, as a wife  one dies for chastity. There is no possible way of relegating one&rsquo;s lord  or father into the background because of something else which one  venerates. If one incurs the enmity of one&rsquo;s lord, father, or husband,  one has no choice but to die. The Sages who in antiquity taught  us to venerate our lords and parents are venerable, but to draw the  bow against one&rsquo;s own lord or father on the pretext of adhering to</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>346 Leon Hurvitz</p>
<p>these Sages&rsquo; principles is to violate their teachings. This distinction  must be clearly understood. The Roman spoke contemptuously of  Confucianism, saying that it never spread beyond its own borders,  because he falsely considered the doctrine of the Sage to be, like the  religion of Jesus, an evangelizing religion. The Way of the Sage- is  the Way by which, in antiquity, true kings ruled the world. There-  fore it did not seek to spread itself out, nor to make converts. Treat-  ing lord as lord and father as father, it did not exceed the bounds of  common sense or necessity, and therefore lived life in accordance with  reality. Since there is no country between Heaven and Earth where  are not father and son, lord and subject, husband and wife, elder  brother and younger brother, as long as they live together in harmony  woe do not attempt to bring- our way of life to them, for they live by  the same rule as we do. As for cultural refinements, each country  follows those which suit it best-tha.t is the doctrine of the Sage. Since  the gentle;nan-scholar thinks much of honor, he is prepared, if necessary,  to set aside his pleasures, whatever they may be, and enter into the  midst of fire or water. In the other religion the individual, to enjoy  the bliss of the Hereafter, rejects his lord and father, wife and children,  regarding such an act as the highest good. Oh, how outrageous!  While we live we have this living body; when we die we lose our life  and our body changes. If, ignorant of this fact, one is foolish enough  to think that one lives on after death, one seeks uselessly after death  for some vague happiness, and falling into sin during one&rsquo;s lifetime,  destroys the goodness of one&rsquo;s own life permanen&rsquo;tly.</p>

<li>Therefore, Masuda, calling himself an emissary- of Heaven,  spread the word about, by the use of magic, that even the Creator  followed his instructions; and he would catch birds and show them  off, or make them lay eggs in his hand and display them. He said that</li>

Hence there is no human  device necessary, apart from obedience to the very mandate of Heaven</li>

The followers of the evil sect do  things which are difficult for men to comprehend, and thereby de-  ceive them. However, it is not by the use of creative powers that  they do these things, but by clever tricks. The first day the bArba-  rians arrived here they brought clocks and telescopes, with which they  astounded people, but now people are used to them and regard them  as everyday utensils. When the Westerners went to China they swal-  lowed swords, spat fire, and in other ways astounded people. Accord-  ing to the Fa-yiuan chu-lin itjBL%,47) there is a trick to spitting fire.  However, recently there has come from the land of the barbarians an  instrument called the electer, which can be attached to a human body  and give out fire, and all men know about it. Sword-swallowing and  needle-swallowing are things which anyone can see nowadays at any  marketplace for the price of six mon.48) Even strange and unusual  acts are possible only because their performers do not reveal their  methods. One hears even now, occasionally, of cases where the follow-  ers of the evil sect rouse the spirits of the deceased at night in aban-  doned places, or show people monstrous or gentle images in mirrors,  and thereby delude them.</p>

<p>In this connection, I heard an amusing tale recently. Some-  where there was a servant-girl who, day or night, whenever she had  a spare moment, would take out her mirror and look admiringly at  her own reflection. A certain young man, knowing this, took the  mirror one day when the girl had gone out, and with all his might  changed its shape, without giving any indication that he knew any-  thing about the matter. The servant-girl, not knowing what had  happened, took the mirror out as usual, and when she saw the long,  &rsquo;narrow face reflected in it, threw the mirror away in fright, exclaim-  ing in tears, &ldquo;Flow can I ever have come to look like that!-&rdquo; All  mirror tricks are merely elaborations on this one. It is an amazingly  simple thing, yet the masses, being stupid, are like a pack of dogs,  who, when one lets out a false cry, all take it up, convinced that what  is not is.</p>

<p>In a certain place there was a man who went on a pilgrimage.  Some time later it was noised about in his native village that the pil-  grim had become a demon. His wife and children, unable to bear  their grief, inquired who the person was who had seen him personally,  that they might verify the report. When they met the man, he said,  &ldquo;No, of course it is not true. When I met the man in such-and-such  a province, he said to me, &lsquo;At home I used to pass the days and nights  in a sickly state, but now that I am travelling I have not been ill a  single day.

<li>According to the Way of the Sage, whatever the faults of lord  and father, one may not rebel against them. In that way there is no  possibility of setting up another object of veneration, which can take  precedence over lord and father. A lord who rules a country must  teach this principle diligently and guide his people in accordance with  it. When the Venerable Book52) speaks of establishing the Common  Way of Heaven and Earth, that is what it means. Of course, the Way  of the Sage comprises the principles of benevolence and righteousness.  If it is not in keepinig with righteousness, one may disobey the com-  mand of one&rsquo;s lord. If one cannot help oneself, one rebukes one&rsquo;s  lord and dies a martyr. But one does not rebel against one&rsquo;s lord.  The purpose of rebuking one&rsquo;s lord is to avoid obeying an unrighteous  command which would make one&rsquo;s lord unworthy of his position of  lord. There is no doctrine that entitles one to say that one will not  give up the bliss of the Hereafter even if it means paying the highest  penalty53) or rebelling against one&rsquo;s lord. Therefore the Way of the  Sage does not exchange righteousness for the personal comfort of the  individual. The foreign religion, however, having no such principle  of righteousness, creates such trouble in the world. Thereore, if those</li>

It is the summary of ten conversa-  tions held by him with some high-ranking Chinese at various periods. It is  primarily directed against Buddhism. The subdivisions are as follows:</p>
<p>a) The year in antiquity was no longer than the present year.  b) Man is a sojourner on earth.</p>
<p>c ) Frequent meditation on eternity is beneficial.</p>
<p>d) Such frequent meditation is good preparation for death.  e) The good man knows how to keep silence and to be sparing with words.  f) The end of abstinence need not necessarily be the destruction of one&rsquo;s  own life.</p>
<p>g) There is reward and punishment in the life to come.</p>
<p>h) To divine the future is to hasten one&rsquo;s own misfortune.  i) Self-examination cannot consist of inaction, of not-doing.  ) Riches accompanied by greed are more conducive to misery than poverty  accompanied by contentment.</p>

<h2 id="corrigenda">CORRIGENDA</h2>
<p>After publication of Part I of the Samidare-sho in Monumenta Nipponica,  Vol. VIII, the Rev. Jos. M. Goedertier, C.I.C.M., Okayama, proposed the follow-  ing corrections:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>p. 303, n. 38: &ldquo;Ibuki mogusa&rdquo; is the story of the Nambanji and similar  to other Nambanji novels (See H. Cieslik, Nambanji-Romane der Tokugawa-  Zeit, in Monumenta Nipponica, Vol. VI p.31).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>p. 304, n. 40: To the name &ldquo;Urugan&rdquo; H. Cieslik, S.J., says l.c., p. 17:  &ldquo;Der Name &lsquo;Urugan&rsquo; jedoch wird allgemein als eine Verstiimmelung von</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>356 Loen Hurvitz</p>
<p>Organtino gedeutet, namlich P. Organtino Gnecchi-Soldi S.J. (1533-1609), der  1570 nach Japan gekommen und bald darauf in die Mission von Kyoto geschickt  worden war.&rdquo;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>p. 305, n. 44: &ldquo;Furaten&rdquo; seems to be a personal name. See Paske-Smith,  Japanese Traditions of Christianity, p.9, and Cieslik, 1. c., p. 39.  4) p. 305, n. 44: &ldquo;Gregori&rdquo;, according to Cieslik, 1. c., p. 22, is Gregorio de  Cespedes, S. J., while &ldquo;Yariisu&rdquo;, also &ldquo;Riisu&rdquo;, may be Luis Frois, S. J.  5) p. 308 n. 27: &ldquo;GOsum6&rdquo; is, according to Cieslik, 1. c., p. 23, the Jesuit  Brother Cosme; of Eshun Faibian a short biography is given.  6) p. 319, n. 93: Hasegawa Gonroku, according to Dokushi-biy6 p. 501,  was commissioner of Nagasaki from 1614 till 1626.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>p. 325, n. 110: Dokushi-biy6, p. 368, mentions that in 1647 Spanish  boats arrived at Nagasaki and asked for trade.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To these corrections the author wishes to add two more: p. 305, n. 43:  Enryakuji was destroyed in 1571, not in 1570. p. 318, n. 85: -&lsquo;The Azuchi  Mond6 took place in 1579, not in 1597.</p>
