## FOREWORD AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 
1. A readily-accessible Japanese language edition (kakikudashibun) which I consulted is in Mukyukai bunko at Machida-shi, Tokyo. 
2. Hōjō Shigenao, Mitogaku to ishin no fuun, pp. 110-111. 
3. Hashikawa Bunzo, Jidai to yoken, pp. 339-340. 
4. The biographical information on Aizawa presented here is sparse- perhaps overly so-because little reliable information exists, and also be- cause my analysis neither turns on, nor gains from, a recounting of events in his life. Two standard biographies of Aizawa are Nishimura Fuminori, Aizawa Hakumin and Seya Yoshihiko, Aizawa Seishisai. Both are based largely on the 1863 panegyric by Aizawa's disciple, Terakado Kin. A printed version of this work is appended to Aizawa's Kagaku jigen. 
5. In Hashikawa Bunzo, ed., Nihon no meicho, 29: Fujita Toko. 
6. To list a few examples, "shen tao" rather than "shinto," "yuan ch'i" rather than "gen ki," "ch'üan" rather than "ken."

## ONE: PROLOGUE: LOOKING BACKWARD 
1. Modern historians divide "Mito Learning" (Mitogaku, itself a neo- logism dating from the 1830s) into "Early" and "Later" Schools. Through- out this work I refer solely to the Later Mito School when I employ the term "Mito Learning." The Early Mito School centered on the Mito- sponsored compilation of The History of Great Japan (Dainihonshi), particularly the "Main Annals" and "Lives" portions, which took place be- tween 1657 and 1720. The Later Mito School refers to the Mito-style politicization of Confucianism expressed in ideals such as "Honor the Emperor, Expel the barbarian," "practice both military and literary arts, "the identity of loyalty and filial submissiveness," and "the unity of gov- ernment and religious rituals." This Later Mito School is represented by scholar-activists such as Fujita Yukoku (1774-1826), his son Toko (1806- 1855), and his grandson Koshiro (1842-1865); Aizawa Seishisai (1781- 1863); and Toyota Tenko (1805-1864). Key writings include Fujita Yuko- ku's "On Rectifying Names" ("Seimeiron") of 1791, Aizawa's New Theses (Shinron) of 1825, and Toko's Commentary on the "Inscription to the Mito Domain School" (Kōdōkanki jutsugi) of 1847. See Kikuchi Kenjiro, Mitogaku ronsu, pp. 1-4; Bito Masahide, "Mitogaku no tokushitsu"; and Hashikawa Bunzo, "Mitogaku no genryu to seiritsu." 
2. For a recent revisionist work on the subject of "sakoku" to which I am greatly indebted, see Ronald P. Toby, State and Diplomacy in Early Modern Japan, especially pp. 240-246. 
3. This is the standard interpretation of Mito Learning formulated by Toyama Shigeki, see his Meiji ishin. 
4. The following insights derive mainly from W. G. Beasley, Select Doc- uments in Japanese Foreign Policy, 1853-1868.

6. This view is that of Maruyama Masao, "Kindai Nihon shisōshi ni okeru kokka risei no mondai"; also Uete Michiari, "Bakumatsu ni okeru taigaikan no kaiten," in his Nihon kindai shiso no keisei.

11. I borrow the term from Benjamin Schwartz, In Search of Wealth and Power, p. 15. 
12. See Joseph Levenson, Confucian China and Its Modern Fate, pp. 95- 116; Yen-p'ing Hao and Erh-min Wang, "Chapter 3, Changing Chinese Views of Western Relations, 1840-95," in John K.

14. However, as we shall see in Chapter 3, Takahashi's proposal differed in certain important respects from the edict that actually was promulgated. 15. For a critical discussion of the various interpretations current in Japanese and Western secondary scholarship on Western Learning and its impact on Tokugawa politics and society, see Bob Tadashi Wakabayashi, "Aizawa Seishisai's Shinron and Western Learning." 
16. For a revisionist view to which I am greatly indebted, see Bitō, "Mito- gaku no tokushitsu." 
17. Because of its blatantly anti-bakufu contents, Yamagata Daini's 1759 tract, New Theses (Ryushi shinron), was ruthlessly suppressed after his execution in 1767. Thus, Daini's New Theses was not widely disseminated or known in the Tokugawa period, but the "newness" of his views as well certainly was associated with deviance.

He wrote New Theses in classical Chinese and derived much of his thought from classical Chinese sources. See Imai Usaburo, "Mitogaku ni okeru jukyō no juyo," pp. 525- 555; also Imai Usaburo, "Aizawa Seishisai ni okeru jukyō keiden no ken- kyu," pp. 501-542.

## TWO: THE CIVILIZED AND THE BARBARIAN 
1. See Fairbank, ed., The Chinese World Order, pp. 1-32; and Uete Michiari, Nihon kindai shiso no keisei, p. 21 and pp. 235-245. I also prof- ited from Harry D. Harootunian's insights into the metaphorical nature of the terms "Chuka" and "Chugoku" which expressed the idea of "civiliza- tion" for Tokugawa thinkers and could be detached from China and trans- ferred to Japan. See his "The Functions of China in Tokugawa Thought," pp. 9-36. In addition to Fairbank and Uete, see Tsuda Sōkichi, "Odo seiji shisō," pp. 133-172; Hihara Toshikuni, Shunju kuyōden no kenkyū, pp. 235-266; and Ogura Yoshihiko, Chugoku kodai seiji shiso no kenkyu, pp. 320-335. 
2. Shisho shitchu 1:160-161, 428. Quoted in Bito Masahide, "Sonnō joi shisō," pp. 47. Note however that Bito rejects this Chu Hsi gloss as a source for sonno joi thought in Tokugawa Japan, arguing that political concepts of "nation" or "state" were more important. On the other hand, I hold that cultural considerations of "customs" and "ritual" should be given priority over military or political factors in analyzing the formation of joi ideas in the early Edo period. Moreover, Bito's main emphasis is on "sonno" thought; he does not treat "joi" extensively. 
3. The original terms are "Chugoku," "Chuka," "Chudo," and "Ka." 4. Mencius wrote: "Good rule is not as good as good teachings. The peo- ple hold good rule in awe and have love for good teachings. Good rule wins the people's revenues; good teachings win the people's hearts" (emphasis added). See Mōshi, p. 443. To avoid confusion between ka meaning "Mid- dle Kingdom Civilization" (or) and kwa (1) meaning "moral trans- formation" or the "extent of a dynasty's moral suasion," I have employed historical kana usage in transliterating the latter term alone throughout this essay and the translation of New Theses. 
5. Taionki, Oritaku shiba no ki, Ranto Kotohajime, p. 411. 
6. Thus Chinese "literati-officials" (shih) supported the alien Manchu ruling house in suppressing the Taiping Rebellion led by the Chinese na tional, Hung Hsiu-ch'üan. 
7. Shisho shitchu 1:160-161, 428. 
8. This is a modified version of D. C. Lau, tr., Confucius: The Analects, pp. 126-127. 
9. Tsukamoto Manabu, "Edo jidai ni okeru 'i' kannen ni tsuite," pp. 1- 18. I gratefully acknowledge my heavy debts in this chapter to Tsukamoto and Uete for elucidating the concepts of ka and i. Tsukamoto's article was extremely enlightening, particularly about early Tokugawa perceptions of Japan as barbarian. 
10. See Satō Shōsuke, Yogakushi kenkyu josetsu, pp. 15-23, where he argues that Japanese animus against Western learning developed only after Dutch Studies achieved academic respectibility, that such an attitude did not exist to a significant degree during the early Edo period. 
11. See Uete, pp. 22-23.

13. See Rongo, I, 59-60; Hihara, pp. 242-243. 
14. Of course the term "chu Hsia" (here translated "Middle Kingdom") can also be taken as plural, and this is probably a more valid interpretation considering the historical conditions of Confucius' day. But I am concerned with how Tokugawa Confucians construed this passage, and they often neglected this factor of historical context in making their interpretations. 
15. Shisho shitchu 1:66-67, 400. The two different interpretations are reflected in the translations by Waley, The Analects, pp. 94-95, and Lau, Confucius, p. 67. 
16. This gloss is from Ito Jinsai's Rongo kogi (compiled in 1683), p. 32. 17. Ibid., pp. 137-138. The English translation is adapted from Lau, p. 98, to fit Jinsai's interpretation.

23. It was on these grounds these grounds that Nishikawa Joken (1648-1724) and Terashima Ryōan (dates unknown) designated Westerners i. See Tsuka- moto, p. 9. 
24. The following remarks are all taken from essays of Soko's that were compiled between 1663 and 1665. See Yamaga, Yamaga Sokō zenshu 5:22.

33. Ibid., p. 47. 
34. As Nakai notes (pp. 197-199), their arguments, fraught with logical inconsistencies as these were, probably left the thinkers themselves unconvinced. 
35. See Harootunian, "Functions of China," p. 12. However, I again wish to emphasize that this "centrality" should not be viewed solely on the horizontal geographical plane, but also on the perpendicular socio-political hierarchy: The "noble" and the "high" were considered superior to the"base" and "low." 
36. Henji zokusan no sakai or Zokusan henji no sakai. For two early examples of such perceptions of Japan's geographical position and size, see Heike monogatari 1:144 and 172; Heiji monogatari, p. 342. 
37. This work was first composed in 1688-89, but was revised and pub- lished in 1701. See pp. 416-420. Also see Maruyama Masao's essay, "An- saigaku to Ansaigakuha" in the same volume.

41. "Chugoku ben," p. 416. 
42. Ichibun no tenka. The "ichibun" here should not be interpreted as "a part of" or "a unit of," but rather as "pride" or "honor," as in the phrase "otoko no ichibun." Thus the phrase comes to mean, "full-fledged."

Hence, ritual and music as expounded in [Chinese clas- sics such as] the Book of Odes or Book of Documents are all that they [may rely on] as teachings." Sorai, Gakusoku, p. 188.

61. When Norinaga was accused of employing Taoist arguments of "na- ture" (shizen or "things as they are") to justify criticism of "cleverness" (sakashira) and artificiality, he retorted that the Chinese Taoists made a conscious attempt to set up nature (shizen) as an alternative norm in op- position to cleverness, which they disliked. Therefore, he argued, the Taoists' "nature was not 'true' nature." "If they really considered 'leaving things to nature' to be good, they should have gone along with 'cleverness' when the world became clever, for such cleverness would constitute true 'nature' (shizen, or 'things as they are')." In contrast to the Taoist's norma- tive nature, Norinaga held that Japan's Way of the Gods was truly natural because it was "as the gods would have it" (kannagara), and if the gods would have it "clever," Japanese should submit to it as such.

73. Yoshikawa Kōjirō and Kate Nakai have pointed out that Sorai pos- sessed more ethnic pride than is usually recognized. But the fact remains that in the late Edo period, that element of his thought was not usually recognized: The image he cast was that of worshipping Chinese moral cul- ture to the detriment of Japan. For Mitogaku thinkers' views, see Aizawa, Taishoku kanwa, p. 243, p. 287.

76. "Shina" did not assume pejorative connotations until the Meiji period. Scholars of Dutch Studies began using "Shina" as a value-free desig- nation for China because "Chuka" or "Chugoku" connoted Chinese moral and cultural superiority. In this respect, they were motivated by the same sentiments that induced Keisai to call China "Kara," and foreign countries, 
"ikoku."

91. Sugita, Kaitai shinsho, p. 215. 
92. Sugita's "empiricism" owed much to the method of inductive criti- cism applied by Jinsai and Norinaga to literary texts and to shinshi jikken, the "close personal observation, actual experience in curing" procedure employed by Yamawaki Tōyō (1705-1762), Yoshimasu Tōdo (1702-1773), and others of the School of Ancient Method. 
93. Sugita, Yaso dokugo, pp. 291-292. 
94. Satō plays down Sugita's examples of the Han Confucian idea of "interaction between Heaven and man" as being mere "rhetorical flourishes," but is unconvincing. See Yogakushi no kenkyu, p. 144. 
95. In precisely this era, the Kokugakusha and students of Western Learning such as Honda Toshiaki and Shiba Kōkan were arguing to end the practice of writing in Chinese and instead use Japanese kana or the Western alphabet. See Motoori, Tamakatsuma, p. 479; and Keene, Japa- nese Discovery, pp. 69-73.

106. Ibid., p. 147. 
107. Ibid., p. 147. 
108. Ibid., pp. 145-146. 
109. Maeno considered the earth a sphere whose "center" was not on its surface, but rather, was at its "core." Ibid., pp. 142-143. 
110. Ibid., pp. 142-143. 
111. Ibid., p. 148. 
112. Western cartographers conjectured that "Magellanica" was a large continent in the southern hemisphere. See ibid., p. 144. 
113. Ibid., pp. 147-148. 
114. Ibid., p. 147. 
115. Ibid., pp. 147-148. 
116. But note that Maeno mistakenly believed Islam (fuifui no oshie) to be a sect of Christianity (tenshukyō). See ibid., p. 147 and the note on p. 
148. 
117. Ibid., p. 147. 
118. Ibid., p. 128. 
119. In Rangaku kaitei (p. 337), Ōtsuki Gentaku lists many of Ryōtaku's works including Kanrei higen and presumably had access to them. 
120. Aizawa cited at least one of Maeno's works, a translation entitled Kansatsuka-ki (An account of Kamchatka) in Chishima ibun. 
121. Fujita Yukoku, "Seimeiron," p. 227. 
122. For a good example, see Aizawa's Tekiihen (esp. pp. 274-276), wherein he justifies Confucian hierarchical relations in society on the basis of analogies to nature. 
123. "Nagakuko Sekisui ate shokan," pp. 703-704. This passage is quoted in Toyama Shigeki, "Mitogaku no seikaku," p. 188 and Meiji ishin, p. 80. 
124. Shōsho, pp. 621-623. 
125. Yukoku's analysis was anachronistic, since commoners did not normally join in military campaigns during Shang and Chou times. 
126. Yukoku zenshu, p. 123. 
127. Aizawa, Taishoku kanwa, pp. 246-247. 
128. However, we should make a clear distinction between Confucians such as Aizawa who merely acknowledged the value of assimilating ad- vanced technology from abroad and Confucian-Rangakusha like Sugita, Sakuma Shōzan, and Hashimoto Sanai, who invested enormous amounts of time and energy to study Dutch and thereby actually assimilate such knowledge.

97. Aizawa and Yukoku specifically cite Hakuseki's name in reference to the Sidotti incident. In addition to mentioning Hakuseki's interrogation of Sidotti, Aizawa quoted the following passage (in single quotation marks) regarding "Marabariko Island" from Seiyo kibun in An'i mondo.[Hakuseki:] "... Mata Roson [Luzon] no chi ni hakugin ōku idenuru koto, mata 'waga kuni tōnan no kaitō yori kingin ōku idenuru wo Isupa- niyajin no toriuru' koto nado iite... [Aizawa:] "Marabariko wa Ogasawaratō yori nampō e tsuranaritaru shotō no sōmei nari. Anzuru ni, Shōtoku-chu mo romajin no Arai-shi ni kotaeshi nimo, 'Shinshu tōnan no kaitō yori kingin ōku toriidasuru wo Isupaniyajin toriuru' to iishi mo sunawachi kono shima no koto narubeshi." Assuming that the copied manuscript of Aizawa's held by Mukyukai bunko in Tokyo is authentic, Aizawa's citation of Hakuseki by name plus the above evidence leave little room to doubt that Aizawa did in fact read Hakuseki's Seiyo kibun.

As further evidence that Aizawa read Hakuseki's Seiyo kibun, note the following passage from An'i mondo, in which Aizawa asserted that Gibson refused to reveal his true identity as a Christian, and added, "Gib- son's surname is John,' the name of one of Christ's disciples, which he has assumed for himself-a custom described in Arai's writings. Moreover, the fact that many believers in Christianity are named 'John' is another piece of evidence [to show he is a Christian]."

148. Of course China's relationship to surrounding barbarians changed according to historical conditions-the relative strengths of Chinese and barbarian forces. Under the first Ming emperor, for example, China adopted a militant, expansionist policy. Under weaker dynasties such as the Sung, more emphasis was placed on "virtue" and non-military means of "trans- forming" barbarians. And under barbarian conquest dynasties such as the Yuan, Confucians were at a loss to explain why the reversal of "civiliza- tion" and "barbarism" had taken place. See Lien-sheng Yang, "Historical Notes of the Chinese World Order,” and Wang Gungwu, “Early Ming Rela- tions with Southeast Asia: A Background Essay," pp. 20-62.

## FOUR: AIZAWA AND HIS NEW THESES 
1. For Tokugawa Nariaki's view, see Mito-han shiryo: bekki 2, p. 679. For Watanabe Kazan, see Shinkiron, p. 47. For Yokoi Shōnan, see Yokoi Shōnan ikō, pp. 242-243. 
2. Wang Fu-chih, a late Ming Confucian widely regarded as "proto- nationalistic," held the same view of "cultural joi." The shih, or literati- official class, had to maintain the distinctions of civilization and barbarism, and of superior men (chün-tzu) and small men (hsiao-jen). To maintain these distinctions, Wang said, the shih must "build barriers" between Chi- nese commoners and alien barbarians. See Gotō Motoi and Yamanoi Yu, ed., Mimmatsu-shinsho seiji hyoron shu, pp. 212-213.

5. Four years later Takahashi was sentenced to be executed in the Sie- bold Incident by the very bakufu that he strove so diligently to serve. He died during imprisonment, but his corpse was preserved in salt to await sentencing. See Keene, p. 152. 
6. I used the text in Uehara, Takahashi Kageyasu no kenkyu, pp. 289- 294, checking it against the one in Tokutomi lichirō, Kinsei Nihon koku- minshi, 27: Bunsei-Tempo jidai, pp. 371-384.

15. Ibid. Inobe (p. 323) suggests that this may be interpreted as the be- ginning of the idea of "territorial waters" among Japanese officials. How- ever, we should note that Takahashi would not allow Japanese vessels to venture beyond this ten ri limit. Thus, his ideas should be thought of as a logical extension of "sakoku" to the seas surrounding Japan.

24. A good example is Ueda Jo, "Shinron keiseihen ni mirareru sekai chiri chishiki," pp. 223-236. Interestingly, Ueda believes that Aizawa em- ployed the map, Shintei bankoku zenzu, compiled by Takahashi Kageyasu in 1810, because both thinkers established zero-latitude as running through Kyoto. This view is also held by Nagakubo Mitsuaki, "Shinron no chiri- gakuteki kōsatsu," pp. 46-51.

32. Although Aizawa did hold a view of history as a recurring cycle of "orderly rule and anarchy," (ibid., p. 63) this linear aspect of his thought- the progression from "simplicity" (shitsu) to "refinement" (bun)-should 
not be overlooked. 
33. Aizawa, Shinron, pp. 89-90. 
34. The Chinese thinker, Wang Tao, would not make this analogy until 1873-1874. But note that Wang did not extend the analogy to include China among those "warring states." See Paul Cohen, Between Tradition and Modernity, pp. 93-94.

55. I agree with Yasumaru Yoshio, who sees Mito thinkers as under- standing the need to tap popular energies, to create a "Japanese nation" (kokumin) that would work actively toward fulfilling national goals rather than "serfs" (nodo) who merely acquiesced in passive fashion. See Yasu- maru, Nihon nashonarizumu no zenya, pp. i-ii, and pp. 155-157. How- ever, such a change would have placed burdens on the feudal mibun order that it could not have borne.

This last volume contains useful modern Japanese translations of basic Mitogaku texts, including Aizawa's Shinron. My understanding of both Sorai and Mitogaku, as will be apparent in the following paragraphs, owes much to the excellent works of Professors Bitō and Hashikawa, which is gratefully acknowledged.

63. This is Mencius' well-known usage in the "Li-lou" chapter. See D. C. Lau, tr., Mencius, pp. 124-125; also see Lau's discussion of the term, "ch'üan" in "Appendix 5," of the same volume. 
64. Professor Oba Osamu of Kansai University has called my attention to this aspect of "ch'üan." He contends that "ch'üan" should be interpreted according to the Japanese usage of "gon," as in "gon-dainagon" or other "gon-kan," of the Nara and Heian periods. The gon-dainagon was a perma- nent extra-legal post with real administrative functions, but at other times, particularly in cases of envoys to the Sui or T'ang court, a "gon" rank or office would be granted as a temporary expedient. It would be in effect only during the envoy's term in China, was purely nominal in nature, and was instituted to obtain favorable treatment relative to envoys from other nations who possessed lower official ranks in their home countries. 
65. Yamazaki Anzai quotes Chu Hsi to this effect in Hekki, p. 245. Even when a sage employed it, ch'üan might become the object of criticism by Japanese Confucians when associated with the idea of the Heavenly Man- date as a justification for overthrowing an existing dynasty. See for example, Asami Keisai's usage in Kōyū sōshi setsu, pp. 233-234, where he approv- ingly quotes Confucius' words of censure, "King Wen's was the ultimate in virtue; [the overthrower] Wu did not fully perform goodness."

81. Aizawa's term "kokutai" is extremely difficult to translate. Basically, it has two meanings "the nation's honor or prestige" (kuni no taimen) and "what is essential" to a land and people in forming a "nation." In this latter sense, "tai" assumes roughly the same meaning of t'i in the Ch'ing 
299 
Notes to Pages 124-129 
Confucians' "t'i-yung" thinking. That is, "tai" is some defining quality or group of characteristics that may not be allowed to undergo "trans- formation." In the Ch'ing context, however, t'i was what was of essence to the shih, or literati-official class; it did not become connected to a "nation."

108. I have profited from J. Victor Koschmann, "Discourse in Action: Representational Politics in Mito in the Late Tokugawa Period," pp. 92- 93. Koschmann describes Aizawa's use of ritual to induce popular obedi- ence and allegiance as "a principle of 'magical' government" according to the definition of "magic" given by Herbert Fingarette. However, Fingarette explains, "The user of magic does not work by strategies and devices as a means toward an end..." See Confucius: The Secular as Sacred, p. 3. Yet in my opinion, this is precisely what Sorai and Aizawa argue that the former sage kings, Amaterasu, and barbarian leaders had done. Ritual and music were deemed a "technique" (jutsu) by Sorai, and a "device" (gu) by Aizawa: The sages and Amaterasu had invented and utilized religious ritual for the purpose of securing order in the realm, and the Westerners had in- vented a false imitation for similar purposes.

The Daijo ritual, which had been discontinued in 1466, was revived in 1687, was again discontinued for a span of fifty-one years until revived by the bakufu once more in 1738.

5. But not the rhetoric of reverence for the Emperor in general. By the late 1850s, just before his death, Yoshida Shōin was advocating the idea of "one ruler over all the people" (ikkun bammin). This idea entailed elimi- nating the existing class-bound form of loyalty within the hierarchic status order. Under that system-ideologically reinforced by Mito Learning- daimyo and samurai owed loyalty to the bakufu which in turn owed loyalty to the emperor. Commoners owed no loyalty, only submission. After Shōin, however, samurai and commoners both were seen as owing loyalty directly to the emperor, overriding the daimyo and bakufu who were deemed superfluous.

9. Tokugawa Nariaki understood the need to assimilate advanced West- ern knowledge in military technology, medicine, and foreign affairs. In 1842, he urged Senior Councillor Mizuno Tadakuni to continue support- ing the "inexperienced and clumsy" Takashima Shuhan, then studying Western artillery techniques. See Mito-han shiryo: bekki, 1, pp. 124-127. Nariaki learned that innoculation was successful against smallpox in the West, and in 1849, introduced it to Mito domain, vaccinating his own children first of all to eliminate popular fears. He innoculated 13,400 per- sons in Mito during the early 1850s. See Mito-han shiryo: bekki, 2, pp. 320–323. In 1857, he encouraged Toyoda Tenkō, a Mito ideologue and Rangaku student, to drink "cow's milk" in order to increase resistance to disease. See Mito-han shiryo: jo hen ken, pp. 928-929. Such little-known facts suggest that Nariaki recognized the superiority of Western science-at least to some extent-and strove to assimilate it, often in the face of stub- born opposition from less-enlightened segments of Japan's ruling class. But his motive for sponsoring Western studies was to reinforce and pre- serve bakufu and daimyo rule by assimilating advanced Western technical knowledge about armaments, shipbuilding, and medicine, which unobtainable through traditional forms of Chinese or Japanese learning.

17. Though as we have seen, his idea of "Ezo" was quite vague; it in- cluded the Kuriles, Sakhalin, and Siberia. 
18. Aizawa's attacks on Westerners and Christianity were qualitatively different from what Paul Cohen has called "the foul and obscene calum- nies" that nineteenth-century Ch'ing literati gave vent to in anti-Christian tracts such as Pi-hsieh chi-shih, which focused on the alledged salacious and perverted practices of Western missionaries in China.

I have rendered the passage into English somewhat differently from Titus. He translates Ito's metaphor, "kijiku, literally, as "axis." Ito's figurative use of the term, however, was to characterize something deemed vital to hold the state together. In this figurative sense, "linchpin" seems more appropriate.

## NOTES TO THE TRANSLATION 
1. Two early Chinese uages of the term shinshu (shen-chou) are note- worthy. First, the Warring States period thinker, Tsou Yen, considered China to constitute but one-eightieth of the world's surface area, and not to be the major, central portion of it. Second, in 356, Huan Wen of the Eastern Chin attempted to recover the north from barbarian conquest, and is reported to have exclaimed, "That this Wondrous Realm (shen-chou) [or China] should have sunk away to become but an empty waste for these hundred years is something for which Wang Yen and those others cannot escape the responsibility." Both of these Chinese usages are quoted from Kung-chuan Hsiao, A History of Chinese Political Thought, p. 63, and p. 646. Thus, in China as well as in Japan, the claim of divinity (shen) for one's homeland was induced or accompanied by a consciousness of geographical insignificance or military weakness toward alien powers deemed barbarian. 
2. On translating the philosophical term "ch" see Wing-tsit Chan, tr., Reflections on Things at Hand, p. 360. Also Fukui Fumimasa, "Seiyō bunken ni okeru 'ki' no yakugo,' pp. 557-567. On yuan ch'i as a Later Han concept, see Ki no shiso, pp. 3-11 and pp. 181-208. 
3. Aizawa did not really believe that the world was shaped like the hu- man anatomy. He had access to and utilized Chinese translations of West- ern atlases and gazetteers and to maps drawn by Japanese geographers and explorers. Moreover, in 1824 when he was ordered by Mito han to interro- gate the English seamen who came ashore at Otsuhama (Mito territory), he brought a global map of the world (chikyuzu) with him for use in the interrogation. See An'i mondo.

7. This phrase, "all the people of the realm be of one heart and mind" (okuchō kokoko o itsu ni shite), appears in, and can be considered the guiding principle behind, The Imperial Rescript on Education.

9. Kuni no miyatsuko were provincial officers established by the Yamato Court before the Taika Reform, in the sixth century at the latest. Most ap- pointments were given to local magnates. The office itself was abolished during the Taika Reform, but most of the Kuni no miyatsuko continued to function as District Governors (gunshi) under the Ritsu-Ryō System. 
10. Aizawa here quotes extensively from the Book of Changes, Book of Rites, Doctrine of the Mean, Classic of Filial Piety, Book of Documents, and Analects to support his assertions. He ends this long gloss by stating that because geographical and climatic factors (outlined in the Book of Changes) in Japan are similar to those in China and the spiritual make-up (ninjo) of the Japanese people is similar to that of the Chinese, the numer- ous quotations he has just made hold for both nations and peoples. 
11. Tomo no miyatsuko were provincial officers established by the Yamato Court before the Taika Reform. They were similar to the Kuni no miyatsuko except that they held jurisdiction over people-the various be owned by the Imperial Court, rather than territorial districts. Nihonshi jiten, p. 696. The point here is that the Imperial Court in antiquity estab- lished the "hōken" system-which I translate as "feudal." Aizawa later argues that Tokugawa Ieyasu revived this system; therefore the existing bakuhan state structure accords with the polity Japan possessed in high antiquity. 
12. Of course Aizawa considered Japanese history to have begun in 660 B.C., with the accession of Jimmu. 
13. Examples include Ex-emperors Gotoba, Tsuchimikado, and Juntoku in 1221, after the Jōkyu Uprising; and Emperor Godaigo in 1332, after the Genkō Uprising. 
14. Quotations from Mencius, Spring and Autumn Annals, and Rites of Chou here support Aizawa's arguments. 
15. By Soga no Emishi and his son, Iruko, in 645. 
16. To obtain lucrative trade rights with Ming China, Ashikaga Yoshi- mitsu accepted the degrading terms imposed by the Ming tribute system. He willingly acknowledged himself "king" of the tributary state of Japan bearing tribute to the Ming court in return for gifts bestowed by the Chi- nese Son of Heaven. Under such an arrangement, the Emperor in Kyoto occupied the position of the Ming emperor's sub-tributory, or so it seemed in Aizawa's eyes. 
17. This practice was the source of much political corruption, intrigue, and unrest in daimyo houses. In many cases, the adoption of a son as family heir was accompanied by large sums of money or political favors, so that the heirship went to the highest bidder. In other cases, high-ranking re- tainers plotted the assassination of a legitimate heir in order to adopt a bribe-bearing candidate from the outside. In 1830, the Fujita reform fac- tion, to which Aizawa belonged, used the argument that an heir must be a direct male descendent of the Mito daimyo house to confirm the selection of Tokugawa Nariaki (brother of the deceased daimyo Narinobu). This was in opposition to the conservative faction then entrenched in power, which sought to adopt an heir from a Tokugawa collateral house. 
18. Here Aizawa quotes passages from Kumazawa Banzan and Arai Haku- seki, who also lamented and opposed the practice. 
19. This passage is taken from Mencius 3A/3. This view of history as a cycle of anarchy and orderly rule did not preclude progressive, linear development. Aizawa believed that history basically represented the pro- gressive movement from "simplicity" (shitsu) to "cultured refinement" (bun); and moreover, he held that this progressive view of historical devel- opment was true also for Western "barbarians.' 
20. This is the Ōtsuhama Incident of 1824 in which the captain and crew of a British whaler came ashore at Mito, were captured, and were intero- gated by Aizawa. 
21. Aizawa's reference, of course, is to the bakufu's 1825 Expulsion Edict, originally proposed by the Rangakusha, Takahashi Kageyasu. 
22. This interpolation is based on Aizawa's statements in Kagaku jigen, p. 62. 
23. Here Aizawa uses the term "Shinsei," which he also employs on p. 214. But in the same quotation from the Book of Changes made on p. 332, he employs the term, "Tenso." This indicates that he used these terms interchangeably to designate Amaterasu. See Shinron, p. 64, p. 65, and p. 140. 
24. The distinction between shen tao, the Chinese "spirit-like processes of nature' and the Japanese shinto is of the utmost importance. In attack- ing an assertion made by Motoori Norinaga that Japan's "kami" and "shinto" were essentially different from the "shen" and "shen tao" of China, Aizawa merely quoted from the Book of Changes and insisted that these were the same; he could not logically refute Norinaga, but made a counter-assertion. For Aizawa's criticism of Norinaga, see Toku naobi no mitama. For Norinaga's views, Motoori Norinaga zenshu 1:534-535. 
25. A gloss containing a passage quoted from The Doctrine of the Mean along with Aizawa's commentary are deleted. 
26. Traditionally attributed to Kūkai (774-835), but in fact dating from the tenth century. The doctrine held that native deities were earthly mani- festations of buddhas. 
27. An erroneous reference on Aizawa's part. The Cloistered Emperor Shirakawa, not ex-Emperor Go shirakawa, is reported to have made re- marks to this effect in Heike monogatari. 
28. This refers to the Shimotsuma clan, which participated in Ikkō Up- risings. See Kagaku jigen, p. 7. 
29. Ogyu Sorai is the target of Aizawa's criticism. See Aizawa's Taishoku kanwa, p. 243. 
30. Arai Hakuseki. See ibid., p. 243. 
31. "Keizai no gaku." The followers of Sorai such as Dazai Shundai and Hoashi Banri. 
32. Aizawa is not criticizing professional Rangaku scholar-officials, but rather, "Rangaku enthusiasts" such as Shiba Kōkan or Hayashi Shihei, who possessed secondhand knowledge of conditions in the West, and used it to criticize political, social, or military conditions in Japan publicly. 
33. The original reads, "kuwashihoko chitaru no kuni." It is instructive to compare this Mito interpretation of this ancient name with Motoori Norinaga's. Norinaga held that "kuwashihoko" was merely a pillow word for "chi," and maintained that the appellation meant "wealthy nation." This contrasts sharply with the martial overtones that Aizawa and Fujita Toko wished to stress. See Motoori Norinaga zenshu 3:457. 
34. In another work Aizawa wrote, "After Jingu Kōgō conquered and incorporated the Three Kingdoms of Korea, an Imperial Magistrate (fu) was established to pacify the new territory. This 'Mimana Magistrate' was much like the 'Nagasaki Magistrate' (bugyo) of today." See Soen wagon, p. 17. Aizawa, then, definitely considered the Three Kingdoms to have been part of Japan in ancient times, and clearly lamented their subsequent loss. 
35. According to Confucian political theory, by "ceasing to bear tribute," the Three Kingdoms and other tributory states signified that they no longer recognized the virtue of Japan's Emperor and his claim to be dis- pensing virtuous government. In short, they bolted from Japan's "sphere of moral suasion" (kwa). 
36. This is in present-day Hokkaido. This "Imperial Magistrate" in Shiribeshi was similar to that established in Mimana, mentioned earlier. In Aizawa's mind, all of Ezo, which was then uncharted territory, was under Japanese rule in antiquity. 
37. These prayers are recited during the Toshigoi and Tsukinami Rituals. 38. This quote is taken from the Book of Changes. 
39. This military system, characteristic of warrior rule, was known as "gun'yaku," and dated from the Kamakura period. Under it, each retainer was responsible for maintaining a certain number of followers to be placed at his overlord's disposal on command. This duty was in return for stipends or grants of land. Bakufu edicts on gun'yaku date from 1616 and 1630, and stipulate five men per two-hundred koku. See Takayanagi, Nihonshi 
40. Presented most coherently in Kagaku jigen, pp. 79-82. jiten, p. 307. 
41. "Chōhei." This refers to the sankin kōtai system. That Aizawa uses the term "Court" (cho), a term usually reserved to designate a ruling dynasty, is of considerable significance. 
42. By providing the people with the "Way of convenience and liveli- hood," (riyō kōsei no michi) in antiquity, Amaterasu, in Aizawa's mind, was equivalent to China's ancient sage kings. Aizawa insisted that Ama- terasu bestowed rice and silk on the Japanese people, but in his ignorance of the true conditions of the daily lives of peasants, he unwittingly ascribed rice and silk, every day consumption and use items for the samurai class, to peasants as well. In fact, peasants (except for gōno) rarely if ever wore silk and only occasionally ate boiled white rice. As scholars of Japanese folklore have pointed out, boiled white rice unmixed with other cereals was an item consumed on special occasions (hare), such as festival days, not in everyday life (ke). It is therefore unlikely that Aizawa had much success in his campaign to instill reverent gratitude toward Amaterasu and Her Imperial Line among the mass of the peasantry through such arguments. 
43. "Mizuho no kuni." 
44. An instructive anachronism on Aizawa's part. He read the four- tiered Confucian mibun system back into his idealized picture of ancient Japanese society. 
45. Sake, mochi, rice confections called dango, and noodles are all (hare) food idems, and as such, played an important part in the people's spiritual lives. Decrees banning the distillation of sake were periodically issued (particularly during famines) to conserve rice. Mochi and dango are made from a special type of glutinous rice (mochigome), which yields less per acre than regular rice. Hence the obstruction to agricultural production. 
46. The Italian Jesuit, Giuglio Aleni, who served as a missionary to China during late Ming times. Aizawa's quote is from Aleni's Chih fang wai chi which (along with Arai Hakuseki's Sairan igen), were regarded es- sential reading for Japanese students of the West during the latter half of the Tokugawa period. See Miyazaki Michio, Arai Hakuseki no yogaku to kaigai chishiki, p. 182. 
47. Two such advocates were Shiba Kōkan and Baba Masamichi. See Keene, pp. 109-110; Inobe, pp. 177-178. 
48. That is, the amount of land required to produce ten koku. 
49. Otsuki Gentaku was one such Dutch Studies scholar: He listed as "empires" Russia, China, Japan, Germany, Turkey, India, and the Mogul. Gentaku then went on to state:Japan is a small land compared with others, but it is an empire whose ruling Imperial Line has remained intact throughout the myriad ages. This is why Japan is superior to other countries, and why they stand in awe of her.... Kankai ibun, p. 415. 
50. This idea was fairly common at the time and served to heighten Japa- nese anxieties about Russian encroachment during the latter half of the eighteenth century. Hayashi Shihei, for example, quoted Arend Willem Feith (Dutch Commander of the Nagasaki Trading Post from 1771-1781) as follows: A Dutchman named Heito (Japanese transliteration) told me, "It is easier for armies from northern lands to take over territories to the south, but it is difficult for armies from southern lands to take over territories to the north. . . . Hence Holland took over Java, Tartary took over China, and Muscovy took over Tartary. All these cases represent northern states taking over lands to their south." Sankoku tsuran zusetsu, p. 263. In his Ezo sōshi (pp. 382-383), Mogami Tokunai cites this same "Captain Arento Ueruremu Heito" (Japanese trans- literation) indirectly through Nagasaki Magistrate Natsume Masanobu to the same effect. 
51. Here Aizawa lumps all Christian peoples under the heading, "Church of Rome," but in a later section he does distinguish certain European peo- ples as belonging to different sects of Christianity. 
52. Aizawa here refers to the fact that Russian heads of state began to employ the title "Czar" from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries onward and that Russia claimed to be the successor to the Byzantine Empire. 
53. The Russo-Turkish War, 1768-1774. 
54. The connotation of this classical metaphor is "interdependence," but in this context, the interdependence is clearly not between equals: Japan needs China more than China needs Japan. 
55. A quotation taken from Son shi, pp. 36-37; Griffith, tr., Art of War, pp. 77-78. This idea of counteracting the enemy's strategy in advance through expulsion edicts and persecutions of Christians was a key element in Aizawa's joi thought. 
56. Aizawa used Mo Tzu's term chien ai to represent the Christian idea of universal love. 
57. Otomo Sōrin (1530-1587) at the height of his power controlled six of the nine Kyūshū provinces. He engaged in trade with Korea and Portu- gal, became baptized in 1578, and established seminaries and novitiates in his territories. In 1582, together with Arima Harunobu and Omura Sumi- tada, he sent a mission to visit the Pope in Rome, which was Japan's first mission to Europe. Konishi Yukinaga (d. 1600), another Christian daimyo, however, became a military commander under Hideyoshi, and in 1588 be- was the son of a wealthy Sakai merchant serving the Ukita clan. Yukinaga, came lord of Udo in control of half of Higo Province. After Hideyoshi's death, he along with Ishida Mitsunari, plotted to depose Tokugawa Ieyasu but suffered defeat at Sekigahara and execution. 
58. Nobunaga cleverly used the Jesuit missionary Gnecchi-Soldi Organ- tino to induce Araki (whom Nobunaga suspected of treachery) to stage an unsuccessful uprising. 
59. Nishi was originally a samurai from Omura domain but later became a "red-seal ship" merchant licensed by the bakufu. Aizawa is incorrect in his assertion that Nishi was sent to the West. In fact, Nishi was baptized and travelled to Manila, where he learned Spanish. Upon his return to Japan, he became a trusted advisor to Ieyasu, supplying the bakufu with information on foreign affairs. 
60. Ibi Masakichi spent seven years in Kyushu (saigoku), not the West, where he gathered information on Christianity and its adherents. 
61. These two incidents were recorded by Arai Hakuseki. See Arai Haku- seki zenshu 4:821 and 824. 
62. The reference is to a late Ming work, Su Nai-yü's Hsieh tu shih chü. 63. The correct title is Nagasaki yawa so, a work completed in 1720 by Nishikawa Joken (1648-1724), a Nagasaki astronomer. Nishikawa also re- lated the Sidotti incident in this work. 
64. This reference is to Giovanni Battista Sidotti. 
65. It is related in Aizawa's Chishima ibun. 
66. For an account of the Benyowsky affair in English, see Donald Keene, pp. 31-35. 
67. Tanuma Okitsugu made this decision based on a suggestion in Kudo Heisuke's memorial, later rewritten to form the first half of Aka ezo fusetsu kō (also called Kamuchatsuka füsetsu ko), a work which Aizawa consulted. 
68. This refers to the Laxman and Rezanov missions in 1792-93 and 1804-05, respectively. 
69. The attacks were made on the order of Rezanov's subordinates there in 1806-07. 
70. This is clearly untrue. The Golovnin-Takadaya affair dragged on for three years, but was amicably settled in 1813. The Russians made no re- quests for trade. Quite the contrary, they apologized for their acts of vio- lence in the above-mentioned incidents, saying that the attacks on Karafuto and Etorofu did not have the Czar's sanction, and the Russian government would take steps to punish the offenders. 
71. Aizawa received this piece of information from explorers such as Kondo Jūzō and Mogami Tokunai, Ezo sōshi, p. 393. Sato Genrokurō, of the bakufu expedition to Ezo from 1785-86 correctly identified these items distributed by the Russians to the Ainu as bread (pan), not mochi. Ezo shui, p. 307. 
72. This gloss is not found in the 1931 Iwanami bunko edition of Shin- ron, Tekiihen edited by Tsukamoto Katsuyoshi. 
73. This is the Phaeton Incident of 1808 in which an English warship forced its way into Nagasaki harbor in search of Dutch ships to destroy, since the two nations were then at war. The Nagasaki magistrate, Matsu- daira Yasuhide, committed suicide to atone for indignities suffered. 
74. In 1818, the Brothers called at Uraga and requested permission to trade. This request was refused; and the crew is reported to have left two copies of Bibles translated into classical Chinese before leaving. Then in 1822, an English whaler, the Saracens, landed at Uraga and received fire- wood and provisions. 
75. This incident took place in 1816. 
76. This incident took place in 1806. 
77. These last two sentences are not as ridiculous as they appear. Al- though the bakufu learned about America's independence in 1809, this fact did not become publicly known until much later. The Rangakusha Ōtsuki Gentaku shared precisely the same suspicion as Aizawa. See Hoei mondo, pp. 419-420 and pp. 424-427. 
78. This reference probably is to Matsudaira Sadanobu's reply to Lax- man's request for trade and diplomatic relations in 1793. Sadanobu boldly asserted that national exclusion and the expulsion of Western ships other than the Dutch were sacred national laws in effect since ancient times despite the lack of historical evidence supporting his claims. On this point, see Inobe, pp. 142-147. Aizawa may also have been referring to the baku- fu's statement to the Russian negotiators following the Golovnin-Takadaya Incident in 1813. 
79. Son shi, pp. 29-30; Griffith, Art of War, p. 74. 
80. Aizawa owes this piece of information to Arai Hakuseki. See Arai Hakuseki zenshu 4:826. 
81. This reference is to the fact that Chao (137-52 B.C.) was the first to institute the garrison system in China. His troops farmed and lived off the frontier land where they were stationed. The Ti and Ch'ing were barbarian tribes that he and his troops conquered. 
82. Son shi, pp. 68-69; Griffith, p. 100. 83. Son shi, p. 65; Griffith, p. 98. 
84. Son shi, pp. 36-37; Griffith, p. 77. 85. Su Chi-yü. 
86. The bakufu prohibited and persecuted this sect throughout the Tokugawa period. As an article of faith, the Fuju fuse sect accepted offer- ings from, and performed religious services for, its own members alone. In addition, it strictly forbade its members to worship at Shinto shrines or at the temples of other Buddhist sects. The sect was not anti-bakufu, but rather, sought to maintain its independence as a religious body distinct from political and secular authority. 
87. A believer sat on a lotus-leaf platform, and priests chanted the Lotus Sutra. When the lotus petals wilted away, he was stabbed to death. It was believed that death in this manner guaranteed rebirth in paradise. 
88. A religious organization founded in the Sengoku period whose mem- bers adopted Mt. Fuji as their object of worship. Members were primarily from the merchant, artisan, and peasant classes. After 1724, edicts banning the organization were periodically issued. 
89. Son shi, pp. 133-134; Griffith, p. 139. 
90. This is attributed to Ch'en Liang (1143-1194). 
91. Son shi, pp. 133-135; Griffith, p. 139. 
92. Son shi, pp. 126-127; Griffith, pp. 135-136. 
93. This is a subtle hint to the effect that talented but low-ranking mem- bers of the Fujita reform faction (to which Aizawa belonged) in Mito do- main should be granted posts in the domain government at the expense of the conservative faction then entrenched in positions of authority by vir- tue of their hereditary house rankings. 
94. Aizawa criticized the dochaku theses advocated by Kumazawa Ban- zan and Ogyu Sorai on the basis that the systems they sought to implement were suited to "centralized empires" (gunken no sei), not "feudalism" (hōken no sei), and that therefore, these two thinkers failed to take "his- torical conditions" (jisei) into account. Aizawa presented his own theory in Kagaku jigen, pp. 79-82. 
95. Chinese historians employed this term, "subversives," or "ryūzoku," to designate the peasant armies of Li Tzu-ch'eng and Ch'ang Hsien-chung, whose rebellions toppled the Ming dynasty prior to the Manchu conquest. 
96. One of Aizawa's primary aims behind putting the nation on a war- time footing was to impose state controls over the merchant class and to allow bakufu and daimyo to appropriate the merchants' right to deal in and transport rice within Japan. Honda Toshiaki and Sato Shin'en also advocated such ideas. 
97. This point was also made by Ogyu Sorai in Seidan, although he used the term "kaku." These kaku, Sorai said, had not been prescribed in the rituals of ancient times, nor had they been established by the bakufu, but had sprung up spontaneously, and were not informed by coherent or logical principles. See Ogyu Sorai zenshu 6:126. 
98. This point was also made by Hayashi Shihei. See Hayashi Shihei zenshu 1:126. 
99. Put differently, a 12.5 koku tax yield would be required to obtain the 5 koku stipend. 
100. Two quotations from Ming sources have been omitted. 
101. Aizawa is referring to the exchange of money or other valuables and food, water, and firewood taking place between Japanese commoners in coastal areas and Western sailors. Aizawa conceived of such activities solely as smuggling, or illicit trade, since all trade conducted by Japan with foreign countries according to bakufu law had to be conducted under bakufu control or with bakufu permission. 
102. We should note that the role Aizawa envisioned for these warships is purely a defensive one. For this reason, I call his naval forces a "coast guard" throughout this translation. 
103. Son shi, pp. 63-64; Griffith, p. 97. 
104. The reference is to Hayashi Shihei and Takahashi Kageyasu. See Hayashi, Kaikoku keidan, p. 126. Moreover, Hayashi argued that large can- non should be fired from shore, not mounted aboard ships because the re- coil when fired might break open and sink the small, frail Japanese ships. For Takahashi, see Takahashi Kageyasu no kenkyū, pp. 289-294. 
105. Aizawa owes this idea to Chi Chi-kuang (1528-1585). 
106. Aizawa refers to the ship in question as "barbarian" (ry ohaku), but it was in fact Chinese (karabune). See Tsuko ichiran 5:294. 
107. A chapter in his Chi hsiao hsin shu. 
108. This was taken from Hayashi Shihei's Kaikoku heidan (pp. 127- 128). Aizawa's original term, "sumpan, might be translated "board." Hayashi wrote, "The Westerners call their ships 'castles on the water' while the Chinese call theirs 'boards' (han); and the difference between the two is as great as night and day." 
109. This statement probably refers to the "ama no iwakusubune" and "tori no iwakusubune" that were used to set adrift the Leech Child born by Izanami mentioned in Nihon shoki. See Nihon shoki, p. 87 and p. 89. 
110. Ibid., p. 249. 
111. Yü Ta-yu (d. 1580) and C'hi Chi-kuang were Ming commanders who did much to suppress piracy and eliminate the wako menace along China's eastern seaboard. 
112. Aizawa's esteem for Peter the Great is evidenced in Chishima ibun, which Aizawa compiled in 1801. Aizawa's reference to Peter as a "khan, is instructive because it reveals his early image of Russians as horseriding nomadic hordes. Here he expresses admiration for their attainment of naval power. 
113. "Kaikoku." Aizawa clearly surpassed Hayashi's Kaikoku heidan, both in tactical thinking and assessing the international situation. For ex- ample, Hayashi believed that cannon and small ships were sufficient to ward off attackers, and he conceived of the Ch'ing Chinese, not Westerners, as probable enemies.

129. The term "shen tao" should not be interpreted according to the Japanese reading "shinto." Aizawa adapted his portion of his text from a passage in the Book of Changes ("kuan" hexagram) that reads, "When they [the sages] gaze on the spirit-like processes of nature (shen tao), the seasons unfold in proper order. The sages establish teachings in ac- cordance with these spirit-like processes of nature, and the realm submits [in proper order]." Aizawa obviously substituted "Amaterasu" for "the sages," and inserted "loyalty and filial devotion" as the specific teachings that were "in accordance with shen tao." By means of these precepts, Aizawa believed, the realm could be induced to submit voluntarily and forever. 
130. Aizawa's probable source for this assertion, Nihon shoki (p. 238), reads simply, "... so fearful was Emperor Sujin of Her divine power that he did not feel at ease in the same abode." This mentions nothing about publicly worshipping Amaterasu to achieve spiritual unity: Aizawa clearly misused the source for political purposes. 
131. According to the Nihon shoki (pp. 244-246, 250-252), Takehani Yasuhiko led an uprising in 88 B.C., and Izumo Furune killed his brother for having surrendered the Divine Jewels of Izumo upon the demands of the Imperial Court in 38 B.C. 
132. That is, the sages' "true" good teachings that according to Mencius "capture the peoples' hearts." 
133. Aizawa consciously adapted this sentence from a statement in Men- cius, "Unless the way of Yang Chu and Mo Tzu are blotted out, the Way of Confucius remains unelucidated." Ito Jinsai also quoted this passage along with another, "Some call me disputatious [but when battling heresies how can I be otherwise?]" in his Dōjimon, p. 140. Aizawa used this same phrase, "Some call me disputatious," as the title of an essay written in 1828 wherein he inveighed against Christianity. In short, Aizawa conceived of himself as carrying on this tradition of heresy-extirpation begun by Mencius and continued by Jinsai. Christianity was the most recent in a long list of dangerous heresies that intermittently sprang up during the 
course of history. 
134. A long gloss comparing similarities between religious rituals in China and Japan is deleted here. In this and numerous other glosses Aizawa asserts that the function of religious ritual observances and the nature of the deities worshipped by the Chinese and Japanese people were virtually identical. This shows Aizawa's intellectual debts to the Kimon School of "coincidental correspondences." 
135. This concept is found in the Book of Documents, "Ta Yü mo." Ac- cording to Aizawa, both the ancient sage kings in China and Amaterasu in Japan achieved these ends for their peoples. See Kagaku jigen, pp. 51-59. 
136. This is part of a Shinto prayer delivered during the Toshigoi Ritual. Aizawa, like twentieth-century nationalists, here interprets it in an expan- sionist fashion.
