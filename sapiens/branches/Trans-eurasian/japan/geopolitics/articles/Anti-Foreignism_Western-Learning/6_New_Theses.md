## 1 Prefatory Remarks 

(Note: In the translation that follows, the glosses were written by Aizawa himself.) 

Our Divine Realm is where the sun emerges[^1] It is the source of) the primordial vital force (yuan ch'i) sustaining all life and order. Our Emperors, descendents of the Sun Goddess, Amaterasu, have acceded to the Imperial Throne in each and every generation, a unique fact that will never change. Our Divine Realm rightly constitutes the head and shoulders of the world and controls all nations. It is only proper that our Divine Realm illuminates the entire universe and that our dynasty's sphere of moral suasion (kōkwa) knows no bounds. But recently the loathsome Western barbarians, unmindful of their base position as the lower extremities of the world[^3] have been scurrying impudently across the Four Seas, trampling other nations underfoot. Now they are audacious enough to challenge our exalted position in the world. What manner of insolence is this? 

(Gloss: The earth lies amid the heavenly firmament, is round in shape, and has no edges. All things exist as nature dictates. Thus, our Divine Realm is at the top of the world. Though not a very large country, it reigns over the Four Quarters because its Imperial Line has never known dynastic change. The Western barbarians represent the thighs, legs, and feet of the universe. This is why they sail hither and yon, indifferent to the distances involved. Moreover, the country they call America is located at the rear end of the world, so its inhabitants are stupid and incompetent. All of this is as nature dictates.) 

These barbarians court ultimate ruin by ignoring the moral laws of nature and refusing to accept the lowliness of their status.

New Theses 

But alas, the normative forces of Heaven and Earth must wane as well as wax: "When the power of men is immense, they overcome Heaven."4 Unless a Great Hero bestirs himself to assist Heaven's normative processes, all creation will fall prey to the wily, meat-eating barbarians. 

Yet today, when I propose great plans to benefit the realm people look at one another in astonishment; they are all taken aback. This is because they cling to conventional ideas and to outmoded, inaccurate sources of information [about foreign countries]. Sun Tzu says, "Do not rely on the enemy's staying away; be ever prepared to keep him away. Do not rely on his not attacking; make yourself immune to any attack." If we govern and edify well, if we make the people's morals pure and their customs beautiful, if we induce high and low alike to embody righteousness, if we enrich the people and strengthen our arms, if we make ourselves immune to attack from even the strongest of enemies, all will be well. But if we neglect these tasks, if we are complacent and lax, what is there for us to rely on? 

But skeptics argue, "They are only barbarians in merchant ships and fishing boats. They pose no serious problem; there is no grave danger." Such skeptics rely on the barbarians' staying away, on their not attacking; they rely on something not within our power to control. Should I question them about our military preparedness or immunity to attack, they would be dumbfounded. Ah, how can we prevent the world from falling prey to the barbarians? 

Unable to suppress my anger and grief, I respectfully present my views to the bakufu (kokka). This memorial contains five essays: (1) "What is Essential to a Nation" ("Kokutai") wherein I relate that Amaterasu founded our nation on the twin precepts of loyalty and filial devotion, that She esteemed martial virtues, and that She attached supreme importance to nurturing Her people. (2) "World Affairs," wherein I describe important developments in the international situation. (3) "The Barbarian's Nature," wherein I discuss the barbarians and their designs on us. (4) "National Defense," wherein I assert the need to enrich the nation and strengthen its arms. (5) "A Long-Range Policy," 

150 

Prefatory Remarks 

wherein I propose how to edify the people and purify their folkways. 

These five essays were inspired by the prayer that "Heaven will return to normal and again control men's destinies." In this memorial I outline the theses on which I pledge my life in service to Heaven and Earth.

## 2 What is Essential to a Nation [Kokutai] (I) 

The ancient sage kings (teio) did not maintain the realm, prevent unrest, and uphold everlasting domestic tranquillity by forcing their people into submission. Such methods may work for a single reign [but not forever]. Instead, the ancient sages relied on something else: "all people in the realm were of one heart and mind"; they were so endeared of their rulers that separation was unbearable. This is what we can really rely on. 

Ever since earth became distinct from the firmament and men came into being, a Divine Line of Emperors descended from the Sun Goddess, Amaterasu, has ruled the realm. Can it be mere coincidence that no one has ever had evil designs on the Throne? Loyalty of subject for ruler is the greatest moral precept of the cosmos. Affection between parent and child is the ultimate form of blessing within the realm. This greatest of moral precepts and this ultimate form of blessing exist together between Heaven and Earth; they slowly and steadily seep into men's hearts in all places and eras. By understanding and utilizing these sentiments of loyalty and filial devotion, the ancient sage kings regulated the realm and forever upheld nature's moral order among their people. 

In antiquity, the Heavenly Progenitress, Amaterasu, set down the precepts on which to base this nation. Her Imperial Throne was divinely ordained, Her virtue was divinely bestowed, and through these, She carried out the Processes of Heaven. All of Her achievements were the work of Heaven itself. She incorporated Her virtue in the Jewel, Her wisdom in the Mirror, and Her Majesty in the Sword. Being the embodiment of Heavenly Beneficence and possessed of Heavenly Majesty, She ruled over all nations according to the dictates of Heavenly Wisdom. 

152 

Kokutai I 

When Amaterasu bequeathed the realm to Her Divine Grandson, Ninigi, She also bequeathed to Him these Three Regalia as symbols of the Imperial Throne and as manifestations of Her Heavenly Virtue. She decreed that Ninigi step in to carry out the divine tasks hitherto accomplished naturally through the Heavenly Processes, and that thereafter the Three Imperial Regalia be handed down faithfully from generation to generation for ages eternal. The majesty of our Imperial House descended from Amaterasu is inviolable. The distinction between ruler and subject was established, and the greatest virtue of all, loyalty of subject for ruler, was made manifest. In bequeathing the Mirror to Ninigi, the Sun Goddess said, "When you look at this Mirror, think of it as myself." Throughout the myriad generations, Emperors have worshipped this Mirror as the embodiment of Amaterasu Herself. When they gazed into it, they caught a glimpse of what they perceived to be Her sacred image, though what they really saw was their own reflection as Her offspring. When making sacrificial offerings at ritual time, a communion between men and gods inevitably occur. One cannot help revering ancestors, expressing filial devotion, being circumspect in behavior, and cultivating personal virtue. The affection between parent and child also is thus warmly displayed, and this affection, which is Amaterasu's ultimate blessing, bursts forth in all its splendor. 

[In antiquity,] Amaterasu established the norms of human conduct-the twin precepts of loyalty of subject for ruler and affection between parent and child-and She bequeathed these to the myriad generations. These precepts constitute the ultimate Way of Heaven: affection between parent and child radiates inwardly, and the loyalty of subject for ruler manifests itself outwardly. Through loyalty, the honorable were honored; through filial devotion, parents were shown affection. Thus, for good reason, the people "were of one heart and mind" and were inseparably endeared to their rulers. Thus, for good reason, the ultimate ethic of loyalty and filial devotion existed without being expounded and was adhered to unknowingly by all. 

The Sun Goddess exists amid the firmaments and beams down radiantly on earth. Her Divine Descendants occupy the Imperial 

153New Theses 

to Their people in Her stead. Religious rituals and government Throne and serve Her by devoting Themselves wholeheartedly are one and the same. The Emperor's Heavenly duties of administration and the Heavenly Processes realized through him constitute His devotion to Amaterasu. Because His Majesty reveres His Heavenly Forbears and cares for His people, He is one with, 

and His Throne is as everlasting as, Heaven itself. Can this be otherwise? Each succeeding Emperor strives to recompense Amaterasu's blessings by personifying filial devotion, honoring 

the tombs of Imperial Forbears, and revering Her prescribed set of religious rituals. Hence, religious rituals and political institutions are well-established in the land.

Nothing better exemplifies the principle of recompensing ancestral blessings and remaining true to ancestral will than the Emperor's role in the Daijō Ritual, the first thanksgiving ceremony following his coronation. During this [religious ritual], His Majesty partakes of newly harvested grain and offers it to the Heavenly Deities. 

(Gloss: In antiquity the term "Divine Progenitress" referred only to Amaterasu, and "Heavenly Deities" was a general designation for the gods collectively.) 

Amaterasu obtained the best rice seeds [from the god Ukemochi], and desired to nurture Her people with them, so she planted them in Her august rice field. She also placed silk cocoons in Her mouth and began to spin thread, thus introducing sericulture to mankind. Hence Amaterasu graciously secured the basis of Her people's livelihood-their food and clothing. When She bequeathed the realm to Her grandson, Ninigi, She also bequeathed the seeds from Her august rice field. This shows that Amaterasu was greatly concerned about ensuring Her people's food supply and that She attached special meaning to rice. This is why we cook the newly harvested rice and offer a generous portion of it to the Gods of Heaven during the Daijo Ritual. 

(Gloss: [In antiquity,] prior to each Daijo Ritual the province where it was to take place was selected by divination. Once the location of the sacrificial rice field and ritual site were 

154 

Kokutai I 

thus chosen, the Iname and Negi branches of the Urabe uji were dispatched as reapers. They harvested the crop and presented part of it to His Majesty. The remainder of it was brewed into dark and light varieties of sake. The rice presented to His Majesty was threshed and cooked at ritual time. He then personally placed it in sacrificial bowls and offered it to the gods in the Enthronement Hall. In this ritual He displayed filial devotion to His ancestral gods and personified the meaning of recompensing Amaterasu's blessings.) 

The Emperor distributed Imperial Cloth Offerings to shrines throughout the land at the time of His Daijo Ritual. These Cloth Offerings had been spun from smooth and rough material. 

(Gloss: When the god Ame no Futotama served Amaterasu, he had his retainer Ame no Hiwashi weave coarse yu garments made from the bark of the kōzo tree. Later on, Emperor Jimmu dispatched a descendant of Hiwashi's to Awa Province with kōzo and flax seeds, and ordered that these be planted there. Thereafter, the Imibe uji of Awa, descendants of Hiwashi, presented rough cloth to be woven into Imperial Cloth Offerings distributed at every Daijō Ritual. This is a good example of descendants honoring and carrying on the hereditary calling established by their forbears.) 

Thus, all participants in the Daijo Ritual display the principle of recompensing ancestral blessings. 

His Majesty performs ritual cleansing to purify himself before the Daijo Ritual. His emergence into the Ritual Hall goes unheralded, and He enters barefoot in order to personify the highest Reverence. The simplicity of His garments symbolizes Reverence and a desire to avoid stylistic refinement. 

When She bestowed the realm to Ninigi, Amaterasu decreed that Ame no Koyane divine the will of the deities and that Ame no Futotama assist Ninigi in any way possible. Bearing this in mind, we can grasp the import behind the roles played in the Daijō Ritual by the Nakatomi uji, who are descendants of Koyane, and the Imibe, who are descendants of Futotama. The Nakatomi deliver auspicious prayers to His Majesty and the 

155 

New Theses 

Imibe present Him with the Imperial Jewel, Mirror, and Sword. [In antiquity] these functions were faithfully carried out at each successive Daijo Ritual. It was as if the Nakatomi and Imibe received their original decrees from Amaterasu anew on every 

occasion. 

(Gloss: Amaterasu decreed that Koyane, Futotama, and three other gods escort Ninigi to earth. She also decreed that they set up sacred bush-barriers around him to afford him divine protection in the same manner that they would do in Heaven. When Emperor Jimmu pacified the realm, he also set up these sacred bush-barriers. He ordered Taneko, Koyane's descendant, and Ame no Tomi, Futotama's descendant, to present a mirror and sword at the Daijo Ritual and to distribute Imperial. Cloth Offerings to shrines throughout the land. All asperor J this ritual were meticulously observed for countless reigh-barrien Emperor Sujin worshipped Amaterasu at Kasanui Villa mene ordered the Imibe uji to instruct the descendants of the gods Ishikoritome and Ame no Mahitotsu to cast replicas of ancient-style mirrors and swords and to place these in the Imperial Palace. Emperor Sujin did this because these two deities once had served Amaterasu; Ishikoritome, by forging the Jeweled Mirror, and Ame no Mahitotsu, as a goldsmith. The Imibe offer these articles to the Emperor during each Daijō Ritual. This action symbolizes the care shown to objects handed down from ancestors and the concern that these not be lost or damaged.) 

In addition, the Imibe procured and presented all other articles used during the ceremony. Each participant in this Daijo Ritual carries out the same hereditary ceremonial function in accordance with ancestral will, and each performs his role carefully down to the last detail, just as his particular forbear did on the day that Ninigi descended to earth. Thus, ruler and retainer alike cannot but remain true to Amaterasu's original decrees. 

(Gloss: Futotama led the gods Hiwashi, Taoki Hooi, Hiko sachi, Kushiakarutama, and Mahitotsu in serving Amaterasu. Ame no Tomi, Futotama's offspring, instructed the descendants 

156 

Kokutai I 

of the above gods to produce mirrors, halberds, shields, and other necessary objects to be offered to His Majesty during the Daijo Ritual. This was performed in obedience to ancestral custom. To give additional examples, [the Engi shiki says that] the Tomo no Miyatsuko light fires, the Azumi fan these fires, and the Kuramochi remove reed pot lids. These and other similar ceremonial roles were observed throughout the ages in each family line.) 

When the Emperor, Amaterasu's own flesh and blood, solemnly performs this Daijo Ritual in Her honor, Her own countenance presents itself to all who gaze on His Majesty. The Court nobles looking on, both high and low, imagine themselves to be in Amaterasu's presence. This feeling [of communion] arises naturally among them and 

among them and cannot be suppressed, for they too are descendants of the gods. Their own ancestors once served Amaterasu and Her Imperial Descendants by performing deeds of merit on the people's behalf. Their names are found in our set of officially prescribed classics, and the eldest son in each noble house leads its members in worshipping its forbears. 

(Gloss: In antiquity, old families and clans who became Kuni no miyatsuko or Agata nushi gave their members a sense of unity by worshipping clan ancestors. For example, the Miwa no Kimi, descended from Ōnamuchi, worshipped him generation after generation. The same was true for the Chichibu no Miyatsuko, descended from Omoikane, and for all other prominent clans. By Emperor Tenji's time, uji heads known as konokami were referred to as ujinoso in the Taiho Code. This is an example of embellishing an old, established custom with a new name. In later ages, gods particular to certain localities were called ujigami, and their worshippers were known as ujiko. This is another vestige of an ancient practice.) 

Each noble house displays filial devotion to its own divine founder at home, and by participating in the Daijō Ritual as a public function, it worships Amaterasu, the progenitress of all the gods. 

157 

(Gloss: In antiquity, the Omi, Muraji, and Tomo no Miyatsuko made certain that the various uji under their command upheld hereditary callings. The aforementioned Imibe organized the various Imibe uji scattered throughout the country in this way also. The Imibe located in Awa descended from Hiwashi are a good example. [In that era,] every uji performed its hereditary ceremonial role in each successive Daijō Ritual.) 

When we recall how ancestors reverently served the progenitress of our Imperial Line and other Heavenly Deities, how can we ignore ancestral will? How can we turn against our ruler? Through such rituals, filial devotion is transmitted from father to son, and from son to grandson. Each carries on the wishes of his parent and bids his offspring to do likewise. The passing of a thousand generations produces not the slightest change in their filial sentiment. Loyalty and filial devotion have always been one and the same: Filial devotion is transformed into loyalty to ruler, and loyalty is demonstrated by respecting the wishes of forbears. Edification of the people and the reform of their folkways is accomplished: The ruler places the people under his "inducing influence" (kwa) without recourse to injunctions or exhortations. Religious rituals are a means of political rule, and political rule is identical to ethical inculcation. Throughout history, edification and administration have been inseparable: When the people are taught simply to revere Amaterasu and Her Divine Imperial Line, their allegiances are undivided and they are blind to all heresies. Thus we achieve both spiritual unity among the people and the union of Heaven and man. This was the ancient sage kings' one true reliance for maintaining the realm, and was the basis on which Amaterasu founded our nation. 

Just as the myriad things stem from Heaven, man stems from his ancestors. He acquires his body from his forbears and his vital life force (ch'i) from the cosmos. For this reason, not even the basest of commoners remain unawed when told about the spirits of Heaven and Earth. When government, edification, laws, and decrees all stipulate reverence for Heaven and recompensing ancestral blessings, spiritual unity among the people is a foregone 

158 

Kokutai I 

conclusion. The hearts and minds of men stem from the mind of the cosmos. When their hearts and minds are unified, their spiritual powers (ch'i) are heightened. When their hearts and minds are unified so that these accord with the mind of the cosmos, men obtain the primordial vital force that sustains all life and order (yuan ch'i) in the cosmos. Since the people of our realm possess this consumate yuan ch'i at birth, their manners and temperament are cordial and warm. This phenomenon is known as the unity of Heaven and man. When the people are induced to think of antiquity, their customs are purified, they recompense the blessings originally bestowed by Amaterasu, and remain forever true to the wishes of their ancestors.

In antiquity [the feudal lords] known as Kuni no miyatsuko and Tomo no miyatsuko inherited their family posts from, and performed sacrificial ceremonies to, their ancestors generation after generation. 11 Near the midpoint of our nation's history 12 [Nara and Heian times], Court nobles and Imperial collaterals monopolized hereditary posts within their own clans. More recently [Kamakura and Muromachi times], warrior families arose, each of which bound its members with ties of filial reverence. Yet even in this period, members of the prominent clans continued to worship their own ancestral progenitors [who in turn originally had worshipped Amaterasu]. Because these prominent families remained true to their ancestors, no one dared blaspheme the Imperial Institution, and all recognized its inviolable majesty. Since the difference between loyalty and treachery was as plain as night and day, no one would aid and abet evildoers. The perfidious were hard put to exist in the world, much less could they achieve their villainous designs. 

Although we have had troubled eras in our past, the majesty of our Imperial Throne remained undisturbed. It is quite true that certain Imperial Highnesses suffered exile, 13 but no one dared lay hands on the Three Sacred Treasures. It is also true that certain subvassals [such as the Hōjō] exercised power for generations on their own behalf, but no one dared depose his overlord. Amaterasu founded our nation on the precepts of loyalty and filial devotion, and these virtues exist among the people even today; it is quite natural that our Divine Line of 

159 

Emperors has remained unbroken and coeval with Heaven and Earth. This shows the firmness of our nation's Divine foundations under Amaterasu and the longevity of Imperial virtue. 

May we then conclude that the Imperial Dynasty's benevolent government and illustrious virtue have been impeccable? No, normally, nothing under Heaven is entirely free of evils. Many evils now exist, but they stem from two distinct sources-changing historical forces and wicked doctrines. Before we can rectify what is deformed or revive what has declined, we must examine these evils in detail. 

Changing Historical Forces. In antiquity, Amaterasu laid the foundations for Her Heavenly Tasks and lovingly cared for Her people. She appointed Heavenly Village Chiefs to look after the tillers of the soil and dispatched warrior gods to bring peace and order to the land. Thus She prompted the people to revere the Imperial Court. But the creation of earth by Heaven was just completed; the world remained nebulous and confused. The Four Quarters awaited pacification. Local tribes and territorial chieftains divided up the land among themselves and defied Imperial attempts at unification for generations. 

When Emperor Jimmu, founder of our Imperial Line, pacified the realm, He enfeoffed rulers known as Kuni no miyatsuko and commanded them to minister to the needs of gods and men. Emperor Jimmu bound all of these feudal houses by means of noble titles and pledges of fealty. He brought all people under Imperial sway so that the entire realm enjoyed orderly government. . . . 

14 

With the passing of time, administration grew lax and insurrections occasionally broke out. But Emperor Sujin suppressed these rebellions, administered the land, edified the people, levied taxes and corveys, and increased the number of Kuni no miyatsuko feudatories. In this way, he pacified even the remotest corners of the realm. The next several Emperors spared no efforts to administer the land and people; as a result, the Imperial Dynasty's sphere of moral suasion (kokwa) became ever more vast and the nation's territory expanded correspondingly. All land was the Emperor's land, all people were the Emperor's 

160 

Kokutai I 

people. We achieved spiritual unity and all under Heaven enjoyed orderly government. 

But later, the ways of ease and comfort set in. The Court lacked vision in its decision-making, and high officials abused their powers by establishing private estates. The land and people soon became divided into two distinct groups: First there remained Dynastic lands and subjects, the Miyake and Minashiro; second, aristocratic families, such as the Omi, Muraji, and Tomo no miyaytsuko, acquired private landholdings and populations. When the land became divided, the people lost their former spiritual unity. [At this dark hour,] Emperor Tenji revived the Dynasty's fortunes. After valiantly squashing an attempted coup at court, 15 His Majesty (then Heir Apparent) served Emperor Kōtoku and Empress Saimei. He carried out long-needed reforms and instituted a totally new form of government by converting the old feudatories into administrative units called "provinces and districts" and appointing governors to rule over these. By creating a centralized form of administration, Emperor Tenji abolished the private ownership of land [and people]. Every inch of territory, every single person submitted to the Imperial Dynasty, and all under Heaven enjoyed orderly government. 

Yet after a number of generations, the Fujiwara seized power. The ways of insolence and presumption again set in among Court officials, causing them to vie with one another in founding private estates (shōen) and bringing the people under their own control. In the provinces, warrior families who had ingratiated themselves with these aristocrats worked to subdivide and annex the land, making slaves of Imperial subjects. The realm became divided; its map had as many crisscross lines as a turtle's shell. In short, regionalism was the order of the day. 

When Minamoto no Yorimoto was appointed Overlord-General, all land and people became subject to Kamakura. Under the Kamakura and Muromachi shoguns there were eras both of prosperity and anarchy, but in general, these shoguns countermanded decrees from the Throne because they were in actual control of the land and people. Wars broke out because the 

161 

old aristocratic families and local magnates sought to retain their hold on the land and people. The strong devoured the weak; insurgents appeared one after another. The realm was in constant turmoil and the people suffered incredibly. Amid such confusion, they were confused about whom they should submit to. The courageous fought valiantly, each dying for his own lord. But because name did not conform to status, their loyalty was not true loyalty, and their filial devotion was not true filial devotion. True loyalty and filial devotion steadily wasted awayand with the appearance of that scoundrel, Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, the virtue of name and status reached its lowest ebb. Although a subject of the Emperor, he kowtowed before the Ming dynasty and demeaned himself as its vassal. But no one in the realm found this odd in the least. His action amounted to treason, since it induced the Ming to look on the Imperial Court as a sub-tributory[^16] So grievously did he disgrace our nation (kokutai o kaku) [before the world]. But no one in the realm found this odd in the least! 

Thus, the principle of name and status, and above all, that of sovereign and subject, were debased. Folkways became increasingly depraved, and the virtues of recompensing Amaterasu's original blessings and of remaining true to ancestral will were all but forgotten. In succession to family headship, political or economic advantage took precedence over legitimacy of bloodline. This gave rise to the evil custom of adopting heirs from outside one's extended family. 17 If persons without blood ties may be grafted together as parent and offspring, then conversely, the blood line connecting true parents and offspring, and by extension, ancestors and descendants, may be severed. If so, everyone would be ignorant of the immutability of Heaven's ethical principles. The most extreme example of this can be discerned in the practice of allowing Imperial Princes to take the tonsure. Because of this evil practice, we almost brought the Dynastic Line to extinction...[^18] land and people, he cannot govern and edify. Ultimately, loyalty Unless the ruler unifies 

of Heaven and Man also will fall to ruin. 

Way 

But "history's cycle of orderly rule and anarchy"19 is the 

162 

Kokutai I 

normal course of events on earth: When Heaven tires of disorder, Great Heroes arise. For example, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, though a mere commoner, rose up and created order out of chaos. He served the Throne as kampaku, issued commands throughout the realm, and unified the land and people. Next, Tokugawa Ieyasu came to the fore. Loyalty and filial devotion were the sole means by which he laid the foundations of a two-hundred year peace. He issued injunctions for his descendants to follow, and this they did to the letter. At the appropriate time, Ieyasu led the lords of the land to Kyoto to honor the Imperial Court, and the Emperor bestowed awards, offices, and Court ranks on them. Government over all land and people in the realm became unified. All revered Imperial benevolence and submitted in awe before bakufu virtue. Orderly rule, then, was the order of the day. 

But because peace has prevailed for so long, lassitude has set in. The typical daimyo today enjoys a life of ease and softness from birth. His lack of measures to deal with natural disasters causes him no concern. Renegades roam freely throughout his domain, but he takes no steps to outlaw them. Foreign barbarians reconnoiter our perimeter, but he pays them no heed. This amounts to forsaking the land and people placed in his charge. The typical retainer today thinks only of his own wellbeing, not of loyalty to domain (kokka) or of solving problems on its behalf. He is lax and irresponsible, is a disgrace to his ancestors, and is unmindful of blessings received from his lord. When daimyo and retainer alike are this derelict in their duty, how can we unite the land and people? How can we maintain the spiritual solidarity that makes land and people a nation (kokutai)? 

When a Great Hero seeks to rouse the realm to action, his only fear is that the people will not respond. But when leaders of mediocre talent temporize and gloss over problems, their only fear is that the people may indeed respond. Hence they patch up affairs to create an aura of normality and calm. They even allow foreigners to land on our shores, and afterward, in high and low places, cover up the truth by declaring that those barbarians were fishermen in search of provisions. Such [handling 

163New Theses 

po- 

tential threat posed by the barbarians, an attitude which can of this recent affair] 20 betrays an attitude of minimizing the 

only spell trouble. 

Leaders today do not heed this danger. They sit back smugly, and when such an incident occurs, take stop-gap, temporizing measures that lead us unwittingly to the brink of disaster. They are truly a deplorable lot. Can anyone with foresight help griev ing in silent protest? But the bakufu has just ordered that barbarian ships be destroyed on sight[^21] It has publicly declared that it, along with the whole realm, regards foreigners as the enemy. Everyone in the realm took heart after learning of this decree and now eagerly await the chance to execute it. Such is the indomitable strength of the people's spirit! 

22 

Our current state structure cannot be other than feudal (hōken) because that is the system of government Emperor Jimmu first instituted [and Tokugawa Ieyasu restored].2 Tokugawa Ieyasu founded national peace exclusively on the principles of loyalty and filial devotion because these are the moral precepts that Amaterasu first prescribed. If we make use of and regulate the strength of the people's indomitable spirit, if we base ourselves on those moral precepts first utilized by Amaterasu to administer the realm, if we rectify the name and status of ruler and subject and make warmer still the affection between parent and child, and if we induce spiritual unity throughout the Divine Realm, how can armed expulsion be beyond our power? A chance like this will not come again in a thousand years-we must exploit it! Seeking to clarify the evils to be rectified, I cannot help bearing in mind "changing histor- 

ical forces." 

Wicked Doctrines. In antiquity Amaterasu 23 established precepts in accordance with shen tao, "the spirit-like processes of "24 and thereby captured the hearts of Her people. Her teachings were the one and only doctrine to secure 

doctrine to secure popular 

nature, 

allegiance. She transmitted Her august message of "serving Heaven and worshipping forbears" to later ages so that all might know the meaning of "recompensing Her original blessings" and 

"remaining true to ancestral will." 

When the first Emperor, Emperor Jimmu, worshipped the 

164 

Kokutai I 

gods of Heaven and subdued the rebellious, He set up a ritual site [at Tomiyama]. He worshipped Amaterasu and displayed filial devotion to the fullest. Emperor Sujin worshipped the deities, reverently served His Heavenly Progenitress, and distributed Her set of religious rituals throughout the realm. Consequently, all people recompensed Amaterasu's original blessings, remained true to their ancestors, and revered the Imperial Court as they would revere the deities of Heaven. Each served his respective overlord with filial devotion, and the people united themselves in spirit to perform deeds of loyalty, so that folkways were purified and uplifted. 

Emperor Ōjin obtained the Confucian classics and circulated them throughout the realm. These classics contain the precepts of Yao, Shun, the Duke of Chou, and Confucius. Their land is close to our own, and its folkways and natural ch'i are similar to ours. The sages' teachings are based on the concepts of "Heaven's Will" and "the people's hearts." They sought to make manifest the twin virtues of loyalty and filial devotion, and stressed service to ruler and worship of ancestors. . . 25 In short, the sages' teachings are virtually identical to Amaterasu's precepts. If only we had adopted Confucius' teachings to make Amaterasu's government and edification more illustrious still! If only we had upheld those teachings sedulously! But no, their limitless merits were lost to us. Wicked doctrines such as shaman cultism, Buddhism, the ideas of perverse Confucians, petty scholasticism, Christianity, and other teachings inimical to Imperial "transformation" (kwa) and injurious to morals arose one after another. 

Amaterasu conducted Imperial Rituals properly, so that everyone in the realm joined Her in serving Heaven and revering forbears. The meaning in those rituals reached everyone without exception. But certain ancient territorial clans clung tenaciously to their hereditary shaman cults. Even today, in remote parts of the country, they revere vile gods and pray for personal fortune rather than serve Heaven and revere forbears. Devious thinkers provided such wicked folk cults with philosophical backing; they clung to old superstitions and delighted in the occult. They have spun out mystical, shamanistic nonsense about spirits being transferred to humans or men being possessed by demons. In 

165 

later ages, shaman priests borrowed ideas from Buddhism and Confucianism in order to make their doctrines appear more reasonable and acceptable. They simply prayed for their own fortune in total disregard of "recompensing Amaterasu's original blessings" or "remaining true to ancestral will." Consequently, would-be loyal retainers and filial sons did not know where to direct their loyalty and filial devotion; the people's unity of spirit [achieved by Amaterasu] disintegrated. 

When Buddhism first entered our Middle Kingdom, one group of ministers at Court argued that we should not tolerate this foreign idol because we already had Amaterasu's set of religious rituals. But the traitor, Soga no Umako, secretly revered it and erected temples to it in league with Shōtoku Taishi. The number of clerics attached to these temples steadily increased, and they engaged in sectarian disputes to gain followers. This further divided the people's hearts and minds. The Taiho Code [701], in that it placed the Office of Divinities above the Council of State and put clerics and nuns under the control of the Office of Barbarian Affairs, shows an understanding of the need to maintain popular spiritual unity which is essential to a nation (kokutai). But because folkways and morals had lost their former purity [due to Buddhism], the separation of government functions from religious rituals was unavoidable under this code. By the reigns of Emperor Shōmu and Empress Kōken, ministers at Court conducted all rituals and proceedings according to Buddha-worship. They built magnificent temples in each province which soon rivaled the provincial capitals in splendor. They disseminated Buddhism throughout the land and made government conform to Buddhist ritual. Since commoners below [always] submit eagerly to whatever rituals government officials choose to employ 

to employ from above, absolute devotion to their foreign idol was evoked in the people's hearts throughout the realm. 

Later, the honji suijaku doctrine arose. 26 This teaching gave our illustrious native gods Buddhist names. The clerics deceived Heaven and man; they convinced our people that the gods they worshipped were base manifestations of Indian Buddhas. The clerics sought to transform our Divine Land into another India, 

166 

Kokutai I 

to convert innocent subjects of our Middle Kingdom into followers of Indian barbarism. When transformed by barbarism from within, how can "what is essential to a nation" (kokutai) remain intact? Thus, Ex-emperor Go shirakawa 27 despaired of bringing Buddhist clerics under control-and that despair bespoke a great watershed in our history. 

[Soon] the fanatical True Pure Land sect arose. This sect did not allow members to participate in the duly prescribed religious rituals of our land or to worship at shrines dedicated to our illustrious national gods. It suppressed its members' devotion for Amaterasu and reverence for ancestors, and it forced them to worship a barbarian idol. Due to their adoration of India, its followers forsook our Middle Kingdom. Due to their devotion to Buddhist clerics, they forsook ruler and parent. During their treasonous uprisings, they labelled the nation's righteous and loyal defenders "enemies of the Dharma." 28 Thus they turned their courage and faithfulness against ruler and parent. Never were loyalty and filial devotion more ignored, never were the people's hearts more divided. 

(Gloss: ... If clerics can be made to obey the nation's laws, there is no evil in their taking delight in Buddhist teachings and living in the peace and solace of enlightenment. Only when they violate the law do they menace the nation.) 

The ancient sages taught rulers the Way-how to cultivate themselves and rule over others-and nothing else. Scholars of late cannot understand this. On the one hand, perverse Confucians expound pet theories and distort the true meaning of the classics, trying to appear original or erudite. On the other, petty men of letters vie for fame and fortune. But such riff-raff are the least of our problems. The true source of our malaise lies in four other types of scholars. First there are those who designate the Ming and Ch'ing, rather than our Divine Realm, "Middle Kingdom Civilization."29 They are ignorant of the virtue of name and status, and disgrace our nation (kokutai). Second are those who, misled by short-term trends in our history, distort names and abandon virtue by depicting the Emperor as a defunct monarch in exile[^30] This impairs the Imperial Line's 

167 

transforming powers (kwa) and defames the bakufu's virtuous achievements. Third are picayune extollers of fiscal solvency and administrative efficiency who style themselves "political economists."31 Finally are those who expound concepts from Sung Learning, such as "nature" or "Heaven's Will," in seemingly impressive tones and with an imposing mien, but who really are sham Confucians, indifferent to the tasks of the day. None of these four types of scholars represent loyalty, filial devotion, and the Way of Yao, Shun, and Confucius. 

In short, Amaterasu's moral precepts have been disrupted by shaman cultists, transformed into something alien by Buddhist clerics, and debased by perverse Confucians and petty men of letters. Because such wicked doctrines were so diverse and contradictory, they destroyed the people's spiritual unity [achieved in antiquity by Amaterasu]. Loyalty of subject for ruler and affection between parent and child are now utterly ignored, leading us to wonder if the Way of Heaven and Man really exists. In times past, even the worst spreaders of sedition were fellownationals working from within. But the Western barbarians are different. They all believe in the same religion, Christianity, which they use to annex territories. Wherever they go, they destroy native houses of worship, deceive the local peoples, and seize those lands. These barbarians will settle for nothing less than subjugating the rulers of all nations and conscripting all peoples into their ranks. And they are becoming aggressive. Having overthrown the native regimes on Luzon and Java, they turned their predatory eyes on our Divine Realm. They instigated insurrections in Kyūshū using the same methods as on Luzon and Java: Not only in Japan have nefarious commoners led people astray by spreading wicked doctrines. Fortunately, our enlightened lords and their astute advisors perceived the foreigners' pernicious designs and took steps to exterminate them. Due to our leaders' wise policies, Christianity was utterly eradicated. Not a single adherent remained alive to subvert our Middle Kingdom, and our people have been spared from the foreigners' wiles for two hundred years. 

Even so, Amaterasu's Great Way is not fully elucidated, and the people have nothing to rely on spiritually. What is more, 

168 

Kokutai I 

there are as many nefarious commoners in our midst as ever, and if they do not owe their allegiance to shamanism or Buddhism, then most surely they commit themselves to some perverse form of Confucianism or belletristic foolishness. Our present situation is like that of a patient recovering from a nearfatal disease: Though his life is no longer in danger, he is weak and in doubt about his best future course of action. He needs something spiritual to rely on within, and he is attracted to many harmful things from without. 

One source of harm that has appeared of late is Dutch Studies. This discipline grew out of translation work-the reading and deciphering of Dutch books by specially trained interpreterofficials. There is no harm in Dutch Studies itself; the harm comes when some dupe with a smattering of second-hand knowledge of foreign affairs mistakenly lauds the far-fetched notions spun out by Western barbarians, or publishes books to that effect in an attempt to transform our Middle Kingdom to barbarian ways. 

32 There are, moreover, many curiosities and concoctions from abroad that dazzle the eye and entice our people to glorify foreign ways. Should the wily barbarians someday be tempted to take advantage of this situation and entice our stupid commoners to adopt beliefs and customs that reek of barbarism, how could we stop them? [The Book of Changes tells us,] "The lining of frost on which we tread [in early winter soon] turns into a hard sheet of ice." We must adopt appropriate measures to thwart them now, before it is too late. 

Now, when barbarians prowl about our coasts harboring pernicious designs on us, wicked doctrines of all sorts are rife within. Nurturing barbarism within our Middle Kingdom will trigger disturbances throughout the realm: Commoners will hatch evil conspiracies, and fawning men will collaborate. What would become of us? Would we still be Middle Kingdom Civilization? Or would we be transformed into another Ming or Ch'ing [China]? Or into an Indian [Buddha-Land]? Or into a Western [barbarian state]? Just what is essential for a land and people to be a nation (kokutai)? Without four limbs, a man is not a man. Similarly, a nation has some "requisite and defining entity" (tai/t'i) that makes it what it is. Some people stress the need to enrich 

169 

our country and strengthen our arms in order to defend our borders. But the foreign beasts now seek to exploit the fact that people in outlying areas crave a source of spiritual reliance: They furtively beguile our commoners into betraying us. Should the barbarians win our people's hearts and minds, they will have captured the realm without a skirmish. Then the "wealth and strength" that these people stress would no longer be ours to employ. In effect, we would provide arms for the brigand and provisions for the bandit. What a pity, if, after all our meticulous planning and painstaking effort, we merely ended up joining the enemy's ranks! No one who understands such matters can help being angry and vexed. 

The bakufu has decreed resolutely that all contact between commoners in outlying areas and barbarians is strictly forbidden, that commoners may not aid and abet barbarians. This is to prevent the wily foreign curs from luring our people into their fold. Because of this decree, everyone in the realm, wise and foolish alike, is aware of the foreign beasts' loathsome nature and of their detestable designs on us. This is the indomitable spirit of our people. 

Though present and past be far removed, His Imperial Majesty is a Descendant of the same Dynastic Line founded by Amaterasu. The masses below are descendants of those masses first blessed by Amaterasu's loving grace in antiquity. If we establish a set of doctrines for the people in keeping with their indomitable spirit, if we serve Heaven, if we revere forbears, if we recompense Amaterasu's original gifts to us, if we remain true to our ancestors in the spirit that She displayed in caring for Her subjects long ago, and if we rectify the loyalty of subject for lord and make warmer still the affection between parent and child, then it will not be difficult to edify the people and achieve spiritual unity. An opportunity like this will not come again in a thousand years-we must exploit it! 

I have sought to outline the origin and development of the various ills now afflicting us, and I am deeply disturbed by those stemming from wicked doctrines. A Great Hero can, at a single stroke, alter history by infusing a touch of the Divine. He can accomplish anything at any time. The ancient sage kings 

170 

Kokutai I 

maintained control over all within the Four Seas by means of the Great Way of Heaven. Though it assumes different forms [in different eras and places], the essence of the Great Way is immutable. Hence, the Way that Amaterasu used in antiquity to administer the realm, to achieve spiritual unity among the people, and to endear them inseparably to their rulers can be used today. The evils that stem from changing historical forces and from wicked doctrines are too numerous to relate. But by devising counter-measures [based on the Way] we can reform and revitalize the hearts of men. Need we do more? 

## 3 What is Essential to a Nation [Kokutai] (II) 

Long, long ago the Imperial Court established feudatories and brought its armed might to bear against the four quarters. Expert use of arms was evinced in the Age of the Gods, and the Sword is one of our Three Imperial Regalia. For good reason, then, our country derived its name, "The Land of Proficient Halberds Aplenty."33 When Amaterasu bequeathed the Middle Kingdom to Ninigi, She dispatched Ame no Oshihi in command of the elite Kume regiment as an escort. This regiment also provided the spearhead of Emperor Jimmu's attack forces, with which he eventually pacified the Middle Kingdom. Emperor Jimmu established the Mononobe [of warriors] and combined this with the Kume regiment to form the Imperial Guard, which he ordered to defend the Palace and bring peace to the land. 

Emperor Sujin dispatched generals to the Four Circuits and struck down the rebellious. One of those generals was Prince Toyoki, who suppressed insurrections in the east. Emperor Sujin ordered commoners to hunt during the agricultural offseason and to offer up their catch as a form of tax. These hunts also gave commoners military training and enabled Emperor Sujin to press them into service on His campaigns. Such discipline was upheld during succeeding reigns, and the nation's territory expanded further and further. We drove the Ezo off to the east, eliminated barbarism from Kyūshū, and subdued the Three Kingdoms of Korea. We set up an Imperial Magistrate 34 in Mimana, through which we governed the peninsula. At that time, our ruling prowess was manifest, and by Emperor Nintoku's time, the realm enjoyed such tranquillity that our armed might need no longer be exercised. 

But beginning with the reigns of Emperors Richū [r. 400-05] 

172 

Kokutai II 

and Ankō [r. 453-56], our position gradually weakened and declined. After the next few reigns, we lost possession of Mimana, and the Three Kingdoms of Korea ceased bearing tribute[^35] Although Emperor Tenji restored the Dynasty's fortunes temporarily, he was vexed at the narrow sphere of our Dynasty's moral suasion and control (kōkwa). During our campaigns in Mimana, Emperor Tenji personally oversaw operations, but in the end, victory eluded us. Our campaigns in the east and north, however, met with triumph. We drove the Ezo even further eastward, and set up an Imperial Magistrate at Shiribeshi. 36 

(Gloss: There is a Mt. Shiribeshi in present-day western Ezo. This probably was the site of ancient Shiribeshi. I understand that in antiquity, there was a road running through this Shiribeshi mountain range and that the ancient Ezo constantly traversed it. But after a hundred years or so, they staged a rebellion, and after this was suppressed, they were forbidden to use the road, so it fell to ruin. In antiquity, Shiribeshi was an area of great strategic importance on our frontier. Because of its rugged, mountainous terrain, the Ezo barbarians could easily convert it into a staging ground for insurrection. That is probably why we forbade them access to the area and why we established an Imperial Magistrate there. We made full use of geographic advantages to check and control barbarians.) 

We conquered the Jurchen on the mainland. These conquests actually took place during Empress Saimei's reign [655-61], but it was through [the future Emperor] Tenji's heroic efforts as Imperial Prince that our Dynasty's fortunes revived. Po-hai began to send tribute in recognition of our might and virtue; our ruling prowess was manifest once again. 

Although the Way declined [due to Buddhism] for the next hundred years or more, during the reigns of Emperors Kammu [781-806] and Saga [809-23], we brought our northern and eastern regions under control and drove the Ezo across the seas [to Hokkaido]. In short, our prowess was still intact. It was Amaterasu's manifest design that Her descendents repulse enemies and cultivate the frontiers of the earth, and this design 

173New Theses 

became an Imperial legacy. Ritual prayers addressed to Her, for example, contain the lines "may the realm ruled over by Amaterasu extend as high as Heaven and as broad as earth, may the unruly nations be reduced to subjugation, and may far-off lands be brought into our fold as if hauled in with numerous ropes."37 During these rituals, His Majesty prays that the Imperial sphere of moral suasion (kōkwa) might encompass the four quarters. Herein lies the value that the Imperial Court attached to military prowess when it established its feudatories. 

Yet normally in the universe, affairs change with time. Military organization, for example, has undergone many changes. In antiquity, a militia made up of commoners supplemented the Kume and Mononobe; and local feudatories, the Kuni no miyatsuko and Agata nushi, possessed military units to control their peoples and territories. In general, this was the system of military organization first set up by the state. [Subsequently that system underwent changes.] The first change was the establishment of a conscription system [under the Ritsu-Ryō state], and a second change was the emergence of specialized, family military units in the provinces called bushi. Under this latter form of military organization, agriculture and the military first became functionally distinct; military families became known as "houses of mounted bowmen." With the emergence of regionallybased warrior chieftains struggling for power in the Warring States era [1467-1590], feudalism again came into being, and this transition produced a third change in military organization. 

In antiquity, people stored weapons in local shrines, and in times of war, prayed to the gods without fail. Not even the Emperor presumed to make decisions for war and peace by himselfhe always obtained divine sanction. Through this divine medium, the people were spiritually unified; any dissipation of their energies in diverse directions was prevented. Sacred integration between gods and men characterized this form of military organization. 

But after Buddhism entered our Middle Kingdom, spiritual unity dissolved. The people no longer worshipped our heavenly deities with wholehearted devotion, and the meaning behind divine sanction became obscured. Warfare lost its divine quality 

174 

Kokutai II 

and became a purely human affair: This was the first Great Transformation in our history. Following the Minamoto regime, the Kamakura and Muromachi bakufus monopolized control over armed forces in the realm: This was the second Great Transformation in our past. In antiquity, all warriors lived on the soil, but by medieval times when warfare was endemic, warrior chieftains campaigned throughout the length and breadth of the realm. After the Warring States era ended, all fighting subsided and warriors settled permanently in castletowns, removed from the land that sustained them: This was the third Great Transformation in our history. Note that none of the three was a simple altering of institutions; instead, the three resulted from changing 

historical forces. 

When warriors maintain roots in the land and the Emperor receives divine sanction, Heaven, Earth, and man form a triad. When men discipline themselves on the basis of this triad, when they train and study diligently, when they prepare for war in times of peace, thereby elucidating the awesome decrees of Heaven and promoting the work of the spirits, there is no limit to what they can achieve. But [after Buddhism came], the first Great Transformation occurred: Our people ceased revering Heaven, Heaven and man became disparate entities, and rulers had nothing to achieve spiritual unity with. 

The Kamakura and Muromachi regimes [which ruled during the second Great Transformation] assumed control over the nation's armed forces. Thereafter, great baronial families divided the realm up among themselves, and during the Warring States era [1467-1568], fighting raged throughout the entire land. Because no single source of authority existed, warriors committed themselves to their own particular liege lords, and military power dissipated. Hence the realm was reduced to ruin. The only basis for optimism was that warriors remained on the land that sustained them, for warriors on the land are as plentiful as "water under the ground."38 Even in the most out-ofthe-way rural areas, warriors still defended their land. That is why armed strength remained the order of the day despite dynastic decline and chaos in the realm. Hence we drove off the Mongol enemy and [Hideyoshi] captured the Korean 

175 

New Theses 

capital. Our immense military might still resonated to far-off 

shores. 

But this tremendous military might greatly troubled Hideyoshi. He assembled the lords of the land in Ōsaka, set them to work on construction projects, or dispatched them to invade Korea. In either case, he prevented them from fortifying their own domains. Tokugawa Ieyasu continued this policy of strengthening central bakufu authority and weakening adversaries on the periphery. By forcing warriors to live permanently in castletowns, he sought to keep them from fortifying themselves in their domains, and to prevent peasants from learning the ways of war. He thus reduced the number of warriors in the land and made commoners ignorant of warfare: For the first time in our history, military weakness became the order of the day. The bold heroes of yesteryear docilely obeyed bakufu decrees. The astuteness of Ieyasu's strategem quickly revealed itself in the way he manipulated the realm. 

Nothing in the realm that is of benefit can be without harm. In this case, military weakness led to stagnation. Yet an image of military strength persisted though military weakness was the real order of the day. Why was this? When Ieyasu founded his regime, his warriors were trained in the principles of honor; they willingly died in battle rather than live in shame. Even the strongest and most valiant of his enemies dared not oppose him. Although Ieyasu put an end to warfare in the realm, his officers and men continued to observe the principles of honor and to pride themselves on battlefield heroism. Warfare was still in living memory, and men of that generation continued to prepare for battle. Thus, although military weakness was the order of the day, it had yet to appear on the major thoroughfares and in the castletowns where warriors congregated. 

Since the produce of the entire realm sustains warriors, it follows that wealth will accumulate wherever warriors reside. In turn, wherever wealth accumulates, merchants cluster. By nature, merchants follow every latest fashion and stock odd gadgets or novelties to make profits. Such a situation well suited [Ieyasu's] motive: to make valiant commanders and fearless warriors crave peace and loathe war. But after peace continued 

176 

Kokutai II 

for a long time, evils appeared, such as the consumption of luxury items not permitted to one's status, or the failure to control one's passions according to the rules of propriety. To grow rich without moral teachings leads to insolent, licentious behavior 

that knows no bounds. 

When wealth overflows, it gives rise to poverty, and poverty goes hand-in-hand with military weakness. To be poor yet indulge in extravagance creates a concern for one's livelihood. A concern for one's livelihood leads one to long for riches. A longing for riches drives one to seek profit without regard to virtue. Then high and low alike hanker for material benefits and are lost to all shame. When a nation falls to such depths, its vitality is sapped and military weakness appears in full view. 

Skillful maneuvering of troops, appropriate countermoves in response to enemy tactics, adroit control over the battlefield situation achieved by exploiting topographical advantages-these are the demands of warfare. Yet present-day commanders do not set foot outside the city. They talk about women, banqueting, actors at the theater, flower arrangements, bird hunting, and fishing. Men who take up fencing and spearmanship do so only to fight duels. Those who practice archery or gunmanship do so only as sports to put on display. Those who train horses do so only for ritual events. Armor and weaponry are now antique curios, whose proper apparel and use are known to none. Actual battlefield conditions are beyond the imagination of all. 

Warriors are of use only when physically fit. Strength, agility, endurance, indifference to the elements, simplicity and austerity in diet and dress-these constitute the warrior's way of life. That is why a wise commander picks men from tough, nononsense country boys reeking of paddy mud, and detests glibtongued, quick-witted townsmen. When warrior youths live and grow up among merchants, they become frivolous and extravagant. They drink fine wines, relish sweet delicacies, and grow soft. Such a lifestyle inures them well enough to the rigors of late-night banqueting and merrymaking, but hardly prepares them for combat. A wise commander hates such qualities, for they make his men less than useless in wartime. The 

177 

New Theses 

situation we face fits the adage, "Troops as now trained are worthless." 

Military weakness is all too clear; our methods of cultivating strength are fundamentally wrong. [For example,] the rationale behind rice stipends is that each warrior receives a yearly allowance from his daimyo to maintain a personal retainer band. 39 But in reality, warriors cannot maintain these bands because they fritter away stipends in profligacy and presumptuous luxury. So they hire idle townsmen on a part-time basis instead. Should an emergency arise, even high-ranking warriors who receive generous stipends [and should be maintaining large retainer bands,] are essentially no different from commoners. This shows the dearth of warriors in our realm. 

Commoners pay extremely heavy taxes to support the warriors [under our present system], so it is not possible to register and conscript them into armed service once again [as we did in antiquity]. Commoners today totally lack pluck and can hardly be expected to achieve great exploits in battle. Thus, there are no warriors to speak of except those in direct liege to bakufu or daimyo and who live in castletowns or traverse our nation's highways [on sankin kōtai duty]. Who is to defend the countryside? All warriors in the realm are concentrated in cities and castletowns where they practice fencing during the day. When we look only at the castletowns, we get the illusion of great numbers and military strength. But when we look at the realm as a whole, the virtual absence of warriors in the countryside attests to [the true situation]-paucity of numbers and military impotence. Land exists to support warriors, and warriors exist to defend the land. It is only natural that land without warriors is utterly depleted land, and warriors without land are feeble and few in number. Generations have passed since land and warrior were torn asunder and warriors were allowed to lead lives of ease and comfort. The population as a whole is far greater than in antiquity, but the number of fighting men is far, far fewer. The result of Ieyasu's policies was to debilitate the center as well as the periphery, the bakufu as well as the outer lords. This was not part of his motive for establishing peace and stability. The realm now presents a delusive aura of 

178 

Kokutai II 

administrative strength that masks the reality of weakness and decay. I cannot help recalling the adage, "Secure your founda- 

tions before it is too late!" 

All within the realm today rush headlong toward profligacy and dissipation. Daimyo take the lead in lavish spending beyond their allotted station in society. They are by no means wholeheartedly submissive to the bakufu, but their poverty and sloth prevent them from rebelling. Destitute commoners vent their wrath in peasant uprisings and urban rioting. Their treasonous behavior has not developed into armed insurrection only because of their natural timidity and their ringleaders' ignorance of military affairs. Nefarious commoners roam audaciously through the countryside, and adherents of seditious foreign doctrines infest the realm. Such deadly symptoms have not broken out in a nationwide plague only because of the bakufu's current policy of benevolence and the stop-gap, temporizing measures it adopts to deal with the grave problems before us. 

[Tokugawa Ieyasu] sought to weaken the empire and make commoners ignorant, and he succeeded on both counts. Even if someone wanted to stir up trouble, it would be difficult. Our present lack of turmoil can be explained in one sentence: Everyone is afraid of war. When the phrase "fear of war" appears in books of history, even a child can tell that the nation under discussion is weak. How disgraceful! It has been many years since we lost possession of Mimana and since Po-hai ceased bearing tribute. The barbarians are now devouring the Ezo Islands, and here in our homeland (naichi), we are separated from their lair by only a strip of water. The lament "under Kings Wen and Wu the nation's territory expanded one hundred miles per day, but now it contracts one hundred miles per day," did not hold only for the Eastern Chou. We, who cower in abject timidity, and whose territory is daily contracting, must face the barbarians, veterans of a hundred campaigns, whose territory is daily expanding. This is enough to send shivers down one's spine. 

People today look only at the lingering remnants of bakufu ruling power; they ignore the fact that weakness now prevails. They view the realm as though we were still living in the Bunroku and Keichō eras [1592-1614, when armed might was the 

179 

New Theses 

order of the day]. How deluded can they be? Barbarian leaders possess the natures of dogs and goats, so it is pointless to compare strengths and weaknesses with them. But their customs are savage, and they constantly wage war; they could not establish and maintain their states through a policy of keeping their subjects ignorant and weak [as we do]. Hence they register and conscript their subjects into armed service, and they augment their ranks with other barbarian peoples [whom they convert] on their overseas campaigns. How can we despise them as few in number? Their nations constantly engage in battle, and they train their peoples in the use of arms. How can we despise them as weak? Because barbarian leaders seduce their peoples into spiritual unity through occult religions, they are more than fit to wage war; because their forte is the manufacture and use of large ships and cannon, they are well equipped to intimidate their foes. They present a mighty spectacle on the high seas and devour far-off lands and peoples at will. How can we despise them as stupid? 

Such is the adversary we face. Can we rely on restrictive traditional policies, policies designed to weaken the realm and make commoners ignorant? Can we blithely ignore the need to adjust state policies to meet the demands of changing times? When our objective was to make the realm easy to control, it was wise indeed to make warriors weak and commoners stupid. But advantages always have drawbacks. The bakufu's decision for armed expulsion discloses a larger design: to transform our paucity of numbers into a great multitude and to turn our weakness into strength. This change in policy was dictated by changing historical forces. 

To train troops in the principles of honor, and in accordance with Ieyasu's original motive, is the way to strengthen central bakufu authority. To allow daimyo to fortify themselves in their domains and to permit their vassals and sub-vassals to cultivate armed strength in the countryside, so that no land lacks warriors and no warrior lacks land, is the way to strengthen our periphery. When both center and periphery are strong and armed warriors exist in great multitudes, the people of our realm will be fearless and will know where to direct their 

180 

Kokutai II 

allegiance. Then the spirit of virtue will abound within the four seas. We must raise a chastising army and utilize the might of the whole realm to remove every trace of the ugly barbarians from our shores and make sure they never return. That will more than uphold the nation's honor (kokutai). 

Some may argue, "If we allow the daimyo to strengthen themselves, we run the risk of insurrection." I disagree. A Great Hero manipulates the realm by relaxing or tightening the institutional system according to his cognizance of contemporary needs. Restraints do not fetter him; he acts in an autonomous manner. With vastness of mind and clearness of vision, he accommodates himself to changed conditions in the realm. With discipline and rigor, he controls life and death within the realm. Therefore, disturbances will not occur. People in the realm understand the bakufu's astute decision [for joi] and ardently await the chance to carry it out. Who would dare stage an uprising? Should the bakufu exploit the present chance to ally itself with the daimyo, to share their joys and sorrows, and to allow them to cultivate military strength, who would dare not comply? If some unruly daimyo did try to use his newly developed strength to defy the bakufu, it should mobilize loyal daimyo in the realm and liquidate that traitor summarily. 

Moreover, though I advocate cultivating armed strength in the countryside, I do not mean that we should scrap the present military system totally, or that we should close down the castletowns and return all warriors to the soil. Earlier scholars have proposed doing that, and their arguments were wise on the whole. But they sought to implement military systems suited to a centralized empire though living in a feudal society, which made certain aspects of their proposals unworkable. I will present my own ideas on this subject in detail elsewhere[^40] 

The Great Hero relaxes and tightens, adopts and discards [laws and institutions in autonomous fashion]. When he discards one thing, he does so better to adopt another, and when he relaxes one thing, he does so better to tighten up another. Now is the time for him to tighten up the realm. Yet if he is to concentrate tax grains and wealth in the cities, he must relax the system elsewhere. There must be a set criterion for determining what to 

181 

New Theses 

tighten and what to relax, what to adopt and what to discard. Men and matter decay unless used constantly. The daimyo, their vassals, and sub-vassals should be given life, not left to decay. We must exploit the chance presented by joi to allow the daimyo to strengthen themselves, and we must provide positions of responsibility for those who do. But this proposal is a temporary expedient; we should not make it permanent. Furthermore, we should provide incentives to make these lords perform deeds of merit on behalf of the whole state. The realm is a public trust; one does not cultivate wealth and strength to further private ends. 

There is a proper method and a correct time for determining when to relax or tighten, when to adopt or discard. Particulars, such as the frequency and duration of visits to the Court in Edo 41 

or the amount and types of taxes or military services imposed on the daimyo, must be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. If we are to adjust state policies to meet the requirements of changing conditions and stave off apathy among the masses, we must make the most of every chance that presents itself. Even if the bakufu insisted on controlling the realm through [obsolete] traditional measures, our coastal areas, for instance, are weakly defended. Should any daimyo's domain be attacked [by foreigners] and suffer defeat, the bakufu would have to send him back to his domain to strengthen his defenses anyway. It is far wiser to take the initiative and send him back to begin with, rather than wait until conditions deteriorate to the humiliating point where there is no other choice. Thus it is said, "seizing the initiative is the key to ruling over others; waiting until too late is to be ruled over by them." Whether the bakufu maintains or loses the realm hinges on its ability to make a decision now! As the ancients said, "When a man resolves and acts, even the spirits defer to him." How much greater are chances for success when his enterprise is one they look upon with favor. 

Long ago, prior to his rise to power, Tokugawa Ieyasu esteemed martial prowess because he sought to establish a new regime and to end warfare and suffering in the land. Upon achieving power, he made the realm weak and the people ignorant in order to give them repose: By loosening what was 

182 

Kokutai II 

overly tight, he relieved pressures within. At present, the barbarians prepare for war. They annex territories and peoples wherever they go; they conspire with one another and prowl about our shores. The situation today is similar to that of Ieyasu at Hamamatsu, surrounded as he was by Oda, Takeda, and Hōjō. That was no time for repose; it called for cultivating armed strength by tightening up what was overly loose. 

In sum, we must base ourselves on Ieyasu's motive for establishing his regime-not fetter ourselves by adhering to his specific measures. An examination of our changed times can lead to no other conclusion. It is said, "the caterpillar constricts itself in order to lunge forward." We must loosen the realm so as better to tighten it up, discard some things so as better to adopt others. We should discard what we once adopted and adopt what was once discarded, loosen what is now tight and tighten what was once loose, disregard non-essentials and concentrate on urgent problems, drop meaningless formalities and seek actual results. Thus we can tighten up what was tight and adopt what was used in antiquity. For this, we need a Man of Talent and Virtue. When Ieyasu arose, the military prowess of Hamamatsu thundered forth through the realm. By making the whole realm Hamamatsu and thundering forth overseas, we will adhere to Ieyasu's motive for training troops. We will establish government and elucidate [Amaterasu's] moral precepts, our armies will obtain divine sanction, Heaven and man will be reunited, and the spiritual unity [established by Amaterasu] will be reestablished among the people. Then, [Amaterasu's] virtue will shine forth in all its splendor, and [Her Heavenly tasks] will be achieved. We will make the nation's prestige felt far across the seas, repulse the barbarians, and cultivate the frontiers of the universe. Truly, this was Amaterasu's manifest design and Her legacy to the Imperial House.

## 4 What is Essential to a Nation [Kokutai] (III) 

Because Amaterasu attached great importance to Her people's livelihood, She provided them with the source of life-food and clothing[^42] The rice and silk that now abound in the realm all originate from Her august rice field and loom; we, Her subjects, continue to enjoy Her blessings even today. Our nation's bountifulness stems from Amaterasu's benevolence and the fertility of our soil, which is well-suited to growing cereals. Our Divine Realm lies to the east, in the direction of the sun. The Book of Changes says, "Emperors emerge from the east." The east corresponds to wood and is appropriate for cultivating grains. The east corresponds to spring; it gives life to, and sustains life in, all things. Our people do not eat flesh and drink blood as the barbarians do, so our country with good reason has been called "The Land of Ripening Rice Crests"43 since 

ancient times. 

In antiquity, the Emperor received cereal grains from the Heavenly Deities. 

(Gloss: In "What is Essential to a Nation [Kokutai I]," I discussed how Amaterasu provided Ninigi with seeds from Her august rice field and how Ninigi offered these to the Heavenly Deities.) 

All wealth came from a single source, the earth; it belonged to the people as a whole. In later ages, that wealth gradually dissipated; first passing into the hands of warriors, then ending up in the clutches of merchants. The ill effects of these two events are immeasurable, as I relate below in detail. 

During Daijo Rituals in antiquity, the entire realm joined His Majesty in devoted worship of the Heavenly Deities. In the 

184 

Kokutai III 

autumn of each year when the grain ripened, His Majesty offered some of it to the gods as a symbolic act of thanksgiving, and afterward, consumed it with His people. At such moments, everyone in the realm was made to realize that the grain they consumed derived from Amaterasu's original rice seeds, and they stood in awesome veneration of Her will. They labored to bring forth the richest possible harvests that the soil would yield; their hearts were one with Heaven and Earth, and they gladly partook of the bounties that these provided. Heaven and Earth formed a union. 

Even in antiquity, though, there was a time before Imperial rule fully developed, and there were eras of both decline and prosperity: Some people appropriated for themselves the wealth [intended for all]. Emperor Tenji rectified this evil [as part of the Taika Reform] by abolishing all private forms of wealth and equalizing its distribution throughout the realm-ideals instituted in the Taihō Code [701]. In the simple days of antiquity, the four classes worked dilligently.44 Their only business dealings were simple exchanges of goods and services. The people engaged in production extensively, but in consumption, only slightly. 

With the development of luxurious habits at Court, however, state revenues went to entertain Court ladies and handmaidens. [Buddhist] subversives appropriated state revenues to their hearts' content in order to build huge temples, and they squandered precious grain to feed a parasitic clergy. After the Fujiwara seized power, great families amassed huge fortunes, created private land holdings called shōen, and claimed ownership over the people living there. Since shōen lands paid few taxes, Court revenues dwindled. Later, [under the Kamakura regime,] the shugo and jitō surreptitiously amassed wealth and grain over many generations, until they finally became de facto rulers of the lands under their jurisdiction. At that point, the realm's wealth passed into the hands of warriors. 

Since those warriors supported vassals and subvassals to uphold peace and tranquillity in the realm, the wealth they consumed was not wasted. Although the realm witnessed rebellion and disorder at times under early warrior rule, people did not 

185 

New Theses 

suffer extreme poverty. Today, by contrast, we enjoy peace, but high and low alike are at their wit's end trying to escape destitution. This paradox stems from our failure to understand the Great Way as it applies to managing the realm's finances. 

After the warriors left their land [for castletowns], they could no longer afford to maintain large retainer bands, so they hired idle townsmen as servants or workers when the need arose. Cities now teem with idlers and vagabonds who are less than useless in the event of war, and are a tremendous drain [on the realm's precious food supplies]. There are close to five hundred thousand Buddhist temples in the realm, and who knows how many million clerics, nuns, and servants belong to these. 

(Gloss: The T'ang minister Fu I wrote a memorial stating, "If we provided husbands and wives for the monks and nuns, over ten thousand new households would come into being...." From the year 845, Emperor Wu destroyed all temples in the land [except for two temples in both Ch'ang-an and Lo-yang and one in each of the other large cities]. He destroyed a total of 44,600 main and branch temples and converted some 260,500 clerics, nuns, and novices into useful, tax-paying subjects. In addition, the state reclaimed countless millions of acres of temple lands. As these figures show, despite the vastness of the T'ang Empire, it contained less than one-tenth the number of Buddhist temples now in our Divine Realm. Even so, the Chinese of that era were amazed at the numbers involved, which only underscores the size of the Buddhist establishment in our Divine Realm.) 

The erection of palatial temples gave rise to, and now supports, hordes of merchants, artisans, and other townsmen [who should be working the land]. Tramps and beggars make their work a hereditary calling. Gamblers and thieves swagger through the countryside in countless numbers. Fortunetellers and shamans hoodwink and fleece the people of their wealth. Actors and entertainers of various types parasitically deplete the nation's grain supply, which is meager enough to begin with due to our production and consumption of luxury items such as sake, mochi, rice confections, and noodles.45 We lose much rice on 

186 

Kokutai III 

land and sea during shipment to Edo, Ōsaka, and other cities. The growing of cash crops such as tea, tobacco, dyer's saffron, sugar cane, and sweet-pears reduces farm production. Thus, our large-scale cultivation of commercial crops hinders farming, our methods of consumption are inefficient and wasteful, we have a tremendous number of idle mouths to feed, and our grain harvests are hardly enormous. Why is it that rice seems to abound and goes to waste throughout the realm while we suffer destitution? This is bewildering at first glance. 

But the amount of rice we possess is not great at all-it is only made to appear so. If we store small amounts of some commodity in many separate places, its total volume might be quite large, despite appearances to the contrary. By the same token, even a relatively small amount of that same commodity naturally is made to appear large when stockpiled in one place. For example, one koku of rice stored in a farmer's house does not seem very much, but if ten thousand farmers each sold his one koku to a rice dealer, we could not help being impressed by how much flowed into the market. 

Warriors live in cities and receive yearly rice-stipends, and have no trouble frittering these away on banqueting and women. That leaves them no surplus rice to repair or replace armor and weapons or to maintain a retainer band. They sell it [to meet living expenses] rather than store it at home. Farmers are extravagant and indolent despite being poor. They sell their crop to obtain a cash income, but the more rice they sell, the lower its market price falls, and the lower this falls, the more they must sell. No matter how much more they sell, their cash income is always lower than before, and this makes many of them abandon their village for the city. The fields they formerly cultivated go to waste for want of tillers, but the taxes owed by those who remain are as high as before. After paying taxes, selling the rest of their crop, and disposing of all valuables, these villagers still find themselves in debt. 

Thus, the amount of rice sold on the market constantly increases, but the amount in the realm as a whole steadily decreases. The amount of rice in the realm as a whole steadily decreases, but the cities are full of rice. Looking at the cities 

187 

New Theses 

full of rice shows just how depleted the rest of the realm is. But even so, the cities cannot store much more rice than the people consume there. They contain just a little more rice than is necessary to support their populations-and that is not really very much. The difference between a small surplus and a slight deficiency does not seem very great, but it can make all the difference in the world. Imagine a man who has just eaten his fill. If we offered him "just a little more" rice, he would think it far too much. But consider the poor man, who, even in the best of times, never receives quite enough to eat. If we made his rice ration "just a little less," he would think it a great deprivation. In this sense, the slight difference between "a little too much" and "not quite enough" is made to seem large indeed to those on the short end. Thus I say, the amount of rice stored in the cities is not very great, and the amount in the realm as a whole is even less. 

Today we distress ourselves about the cheapness of rice and our lack of money. But these are not real problems: Rice is not cheap, nor is money in short supply. Our true problem is the high cost of goods and services. For example, let us say that 0.1 koku of rice sells for 5 momme. If a cotton garment also sold for 5 momme, we would be able to exchange 0.1 koku of rice for one garment. But in fact, it sells for as much as 0.6 or 0.7 koku of rice at current prices. In other words, rice is not cheap; cotton garments are too expensive. We eat rice to fill our stomachs; there is a limit to how much we can consume. This is not true with other commodities. We continually seek the fashionable or the novel, and there is no limit on our desire to possess, or our willingness to pay for, such articles. A single lady's hair ornament, for example, may cost as much as a middlesized farm. Warriors exchange rice, a commodity that can be consumed only to a limited extent, for money. But with that money they purchase goods that they desire to possess, and are willing to pay for, to an unlimited degree. This is why rice alone is cheap, while other commodities are extremely costly. 

Money [has no intrinsic value, it] simply measures the relative worth of commodities. When goods to be sold are abundant, their value is low, and that of money is high. As long as the 

188 

Kokutai III 

value of money is high, it suffices to meet our needs even if there is little in circulation. For this simple reason there was never any destitution in earlier ages despite the extreme scarcity of money. Since the Keichō era [1596-1614], however, a great amount of gold has been mined and minted, so money now is of low value and goods and services are costly. To make ends meet, artisans and merchants must raise their prices. Living costs climb steeply, but the value of coinage plummets, and people mistakenly believe they need more money despite its plentiful supply. 

(Gloss: According to one barbarian writer, 46 "Since the New World was discovered, the volume of trade between Europe and the Americas has been increasing steadily, and the quantity of gold and silver accruing to Europe from America is immense. Therefore, the value of gold and silver within Europe has declined steadily, and the cost of rice and other commodities has risen steadily. Many scholars are concerned about the disastrous effects of this excess coinage, but little can be done. to help the situation because Europeans are so accustomed to garnering large profits from this arrangement that they are not likely to abandon their mercenary ways in the foreseeable future." Even the barbarians realize that too much coinage in circulation creates huge problems. Why is it that we in the Middle Kingdom remain ignorant of this fact?) 

When some things are too expensive, others appear unduly cheap. Because the cost of goods and services in the realm is excessively high, coinage is made to seem worthless, and the price of rice falls. Warriors live in cities and must buy all necessities of life from merchants. They exchange rice, whose market value is steadily declining, for coinage, whose value is also steadily declining. With this depressed coinage, they purchase goods and services, whose prices are steadily rising. No wonder they cannot make ends meet. 

Their hereditary retainers also are used to luxuries, so warriors cannot retain these sub-vassals with paltry sub-stipends. In time, they must discharge their hereditary retainers and hire followers on a contract (annual or biannual) basis. But later on, even 

189 

New Theses 

these part-time followers (known as nenkimono) acquire expensive habits, and prove too large a burden. Warriors then must hire idle townsmen on a case-by-case basis. But because of their extravagant ways, these men also turn out to be a great financial strain. On top of that, household expenses, allowances to wives and mistresses, and entertainment fees, all keep rising. Because warriors cannot meet these expenses with stipends alone, they borrow money from rich merchants. This soon becomes an ingrained habit, and even the greatest daimyo today find themselves deep in debt. In short, cunning, tight-fisted profit-mongers manipulate the great lords of the land like so many puppets-ona-string. Clearly, the realm's wealth has fallen into the merchants' clutches. 

Rice is the object that the ancient sage-ruler [Amaterasu] greatly treasured. Not even the Emperor dares consume or distribute it without offering thanks to the gods. He obtains it from Heaven and nourishes His people with it. This is as it should be. [But today] lowly merchants enjoy the exclusive right to procure and market this treasured item while princes and great lords submit in mute deference: The people's very livelihood has been entrusted to contemptible merchants. We lack provisions for an army or to meet the needs of natural disasters; the entire realm is a depleted void, but no one finds this odd in the least. We look at one another complacently, our only concern being what to do with all the excess rice on our hands. How deluded can we be? 

In antiquity, Amaterasu cared greatly about Her people's livelihood, and we enjoy Her blessings even today. The rice nurturing our bodies derives from the original seeds that She bestowed on our ancestors. But not only do we fail to cherish and conserve Her gift to us, we grumble about having too much of it, and fret over how to dispose of it. Some people even wish to barter it off to the foreign barbarians!47 They were born in "The Land of Ripening Rice Crests" yet despise rice. They would sell this precious gift of Amaterasu's to the dogs and goats of the world and gloat over having found a clever solution to our fiscal ills! Is this how a subject repays Amaterasu's blessings? 

[Aside from that issue], it is easy to see why we should keep 

190 

Kokutai III 

the rice we produce at home rather than dispose of it abroad. Our nation's farmers now grow about twenty-five million koku of rice. Since the average land-holding of one farm household is about ten koku's worth48 [or one chōbu of land], there must be approximately two and one-half million farm households in the nation. If each retained one koku above its actual needs, the amount stored in the nation's farm households would total twoand-a-half million koku. At present, the annual amount of rice bought and sold on the Ōsaka market comes to no more than two million koku. 

(Gloss: According to records left by a certain Ōsaka merchant in the early Temmei era [1781-88], the total annual amount of rice transacted on the Ōsaka market from 1763 to 1780. was less than two million koku, and the amount stored in Ōsaka was anywhere from thirty or forty thousand koku to one million koku per year at the most. But since I know little about business, a merchant should be consulted on such matters.) 

The general situation in other cities can be inferred from these figures. If each of our two and one-half million farm households stored one koku above its actual needs at home, two and onehalf million koku would leave the market. And if the daimyo and warriors did likewise, the volume of rice in circulation would decrease even further. As the volume of rice sold on the market. dwindled, we could look forward to its price going up. Then farmers could sell less and still make ends meet. If farmers sold less rice, city-dwellers would have less to waste and would have to find ways of conserving it. Of course, as the volume of rice flowing into the cities decreased, the amount remaining in the realm as a whole would have to increase. The people would not suffer from too much rice because they would store and consume it, rather than sell it at depressed prices. 

If we really wanted to store rice in the realm, we could. Why do people advocate bartering it off to foreigners as a way to save the realm from destitution? There are any number of appropriate measures and incentives to make people store rice, but first we must admit the need to do so. Only when the 

191 

New Theses 

people have sufficient supplies of rice and have no anxieties. about their livelihood, will they refrain from evildoing. And only when they refrain from evildoing can they be induced to stand in awesome veneration of Amaterasu's will, to labor to bring forth the richest possible harvests that the soil will yield, and to partake of Amaterasu's gifts, derived as these are from the bounties of Heaven and Earth. 

192 

## 5 World Affairs 

Change is the constant Way of Heaven and Earth. The world's nations have undergone innumerable changes. Two great landmasses [or hemispheres] exist amid the oceans; one contains our Middle Kingdom and the lands on the western side of the sea. The lands on the southern side of the sea may also be considered part of it. 

(Gloss: This land-mass extends from a point twenty-five degrees east of Kyoto to a point seventy-five degrees west of it. Some think of it as comprising areas called "Asia," "Africa," and "Europe." But these names were coined by the barbarians, and are not generally used in the world. Furthermore, because the Imperial Court has not authorized their use, I shall not employ them here.) 

The other great land-mass lies on the eastern side of the sea. 

(Gloss: This extends from a point fifty degrees west of Kyōto to a point ninety-five degrees east of it. This land-mass is sometimes divided up into areas called "South America" and "North America," but these names too, were coined by the barbarians.) 

There are many [independent] territories (kuiki) on these two great land-masses, and each defends itself against all others. Collectively, these territories are known as "the nations of the world." 

In antiquity, prior to the dawn of civilization, barbarian tribes flocked and herded together like so many birds and beasts: They displayed no development worth outlining. On the other hand, we in the Middle Kingdom established feudatories in the form 

193New Theses 

of Kuni no miyatsuko and Agata nushi, each of which defended its own territory. About midway through our history [the Nara period], we set up a centralized administrative system of provinces and districts. Later, regional lords divided up the land, and the feudal system again sprang up. [In China, by contrast,] the Yü, Hsia, Shang, and Chou ruled their realms through feudal princes, but after Ch'in and Han times, the system of provinces and districts remained with few modifications. The Yü, Hsia, Shang, and Chou periods witnessed unified rule, but during the Spring and Autumn period, there was a loose hegemony, and in the Warring States period, Seven Great Kingdoms fought among themselves. The many periods of unity and disunity thereafter are documented in works of history. 

Barbarian peoples of times past scampered about like birds and beasts. Each, in turn, made a nuisance of itself, but on the whole, they were an intermittent menace at most. Only after Yü and Hsia times did the Hsien-yün appear, only after Shang and Chou times did the Hsiung-nu appear, only after Ch'in and Han times did the T'u-fan and Hui-ho appear, and only after Sung and T'ang times did the Khitan and Jurchen appear. Finally, only after Sung and Yuan times did the Western barbarians appear. They venture out to ravage and annex lands despite living ten thousand miles across the sea. As civilization steadily progressed, even the barbarians received its blessings; they learned [the technique] of creating religious injunctions and precepts to guide their peoples. Today their towering fortresses surrounded by deep moats are a far cry from their crude huts and tents of yesteryear; their huge warships and cannon are a great advance over their mounted bowmen of bygone days. Moreover, in past eras, their only means of securing obedience in their vast hordes was to lure followers with booty and intimidate them with force. As a result, those hordes lacked integration and permanence. But now Islam and Christianity have provided their leaders with these two elements and more. Today, each barbarian tribe, while maintaining its own territory, allies itself with all others to convert the entire world to their religion. Thus they are a far cry from the wandering nomads of centuries 

past. 

194 

World Affairs 

In antiquity, periods of warring states signified fighting between small regional units within a single territory; today, entire territories go to war. Besides our Middle Kingdom and the Manchu Ch'ing Empire, five other states call themselves empires: Mogul, Persia, Turkey, Germany, and Russia. These constitute the world's Seven Great Empires. The small regional units that fought in previous periods of warring states are dwarfed by comparison. 

(Gloss: According to scholars of Dutch Studies,49 the barbarians call all the above nations "empires" (teikoku). In addition, other states such as Ethiopia, Morocco, Siam, and Sumatra in Java are often referred to as empires. Of these [lesser states,] Ethiopia considers itself a great power because of its size, and Morocco, because of its Islamic orthodoxy. But Ethiopia is populated by Negroes possessing foolish old customs, and Morocco is reeling from internal strife. Siam is rich but militarily impotent. Sumatra occupies a key position as the gathering place for the various barbarians, but is small and weak. None of these [lesser states] qualifies as a great power, so I omit them from this discussion. Scholars of Dutch Studies also label the kings of barbarian states "emperors." But they simply use the ideograph "tei" to convey a sense of nobility relative to baseness when translating the Dutch word "keiser, which originally designated the founder of ancient Rome. Because these barbarian kings bear no semblance to our Emperor, I do not refer to them with the ideograph "tei.") 

The barbarians who menaced our periphery in ages past were the Kumaso, Hayato, Emishi, and Ezo. After subduing them, we induced the Three Kingdoms of Korea, the Su-shen, and the Pohai to bear tribute to us. On the other hand, the Jurchen and Mongols tried to invade our shores from abroad. 

(Gloss: After the Jurchen defeated the Khitan, they tried to invade the Sung, and in the Kannin era [1017-20], they attacked Kyūshū. We call this raid the "Attack of the Toi." Some two hundred years later the Mongols reigned supreme in the northeast and tried to annex the Sung. They too 

195 

New Theses 

attacked Kyūshū. Both cases represent southward thrusts made by northern peoples.) 50 

But blocked by rough seas, these would-be invaders could cause little damage. At that time, we took the ocean for granted as a natural barrier. Now, the barbarians traverse thousands of miles with whirlwind speed in their huge ships; they think of the ocean as a highway to distant lands. Because we are surrounded by water, we must be prepared on all sides. What was once a natural barrier is now a raiders' highway. Those seeking to defend our borders and pacify outlying areas cannot propose measures today based on assumptions belonging to eras past. 

In today's era of warring states, the Mogul and Turkish Empires use Islam to strengthen their armies and enlarge their domains, Turkey being the more successful. But neither has attempted to invade our Middle Kingdom because they specialize in cavalry warfare to the detriment of naval operations. The Western barbarians, on the other hand, all believe in the Church of Rome. 51 The more outstanding of these are France, Spain, Sweden, and England. Their common mother-country is Germany, but it is no longer powerful. Its head of state simply maintains the title "Holy Roman Emperor" along with something of his former glory, and is therefore accorded a degree of respect by the other Western states. 

Russia was once subject to Germany (as was France), but recently has acquired awesome strength and has reclaimed its ancient status as an empire. 52 Its territory includes states to the east and west, and borders our Divine Realm on the northwest. Russia contains vast expanses of frozen tundra, and longs to expand southward. But Turkey, Russia's long-standing nemesis, has been thwarting it. Russia has revived as an ally the Persian Empire (recently weakened by rebellion), and has defeated Turkey. 53 Should Russia and Persia again join forces, Turkey's left flank will be cut off. Russia, hegemon of the north, is now expanding southward to gain a stranglehold on the continent by dividing it in half, and is preventing Turkey from allying with the Mogul Empire. Ch'ing power has reached its limit, and can expand no further west. Russia has reduced neighboring domains 

196 

World Affairs 

to subservience and is a threat to all nearby states. It brandishes its power on the pretext that it is successor to the long-defunct Eastern Roman Empire. The lesser barbarians tremble in fear and brace themselves against Russia's mighty onslaughts. Russia will not desist until taking the entire world by storm. 

In times past China (Kando) was plagued intermittently by barbarian tribes of various sorts [as previously mentioned]. One of them conquered China and became its emperor. Now Russia has annexed the homeland of these tribes, the Tungus area, and this will bring it into conflict with the Ch'ing Empire. But the Ch'ing, as strong as ever, is holding its own. So Russia has turned its predatory eyes on our Divine Realm. Russia plots to take over our Divine Realm first; then it will round up our people to ravage China's eastern seaboard and subvert the Ch'ing just as the so-called Japanese Raiders (wako) subverted the Ming many years ago. Russia then will exploit this golden opportunity [while Ch'ing forces are held down in the east] to capture Hami, Manchuria, and other lands on the Ch'ing northern frontier. Then it will make a daring thrust on Peking itself, and the Ch'ing will have to capitulate. Having defeated China, Russia could easily topple the Mogul Empire. Then, with help from Persia, it would have no trouble conquering Turkey. 

But if the Ch'ing prove more formidable than expected, and success seems unlikely in the east, Russia may strike to the west first. At the opportune moment, it will ally itself with Persia and seize Turkey. Having taken Turkey, it will assault the Mogul Empire and push on to Dzungar, to grapple with the Ch'ing. If successful against the Ch'ing, it will assemble a fleet and close in on our Divine Land. 

In short, Russia either can sweep westward from the east, or eastward from the west. It will wait for the best time and consider all relevant factors before choosing. But whichever course Russia adopts, if successful, it will become ruler of the world. Naturally, it will opt for the easier of the two courses. That is why the Russians constantly prowl about our islands-they want to probe our defenses. Because navagation is Russia's forte, it is not timid about venturing on turbulent, stormy seas. Russia has already beaten Turkish land forces and seized various 

197 

New Theses 

doorstep, 

overseas islands (kaigai shoto). Russia is right on our and is a far graver menace than the Jurchen or Mongols ever were. Those who seek to defend our borders and pacify outlying areas must realize that world conditions today are different from eras past; they must devise policies to deal with the 

present. 

The world situation today, with its Seven Great Powers, presents striking similarities to that of the late-Chou period and its Seven Great Kingdoms. For example, Russia and Turkey are large, powerful states constantly at odds; in these respects, they resemble Ch'in and Ch'u. The wealth and power of the Ch'ing empire and its eastern location remind us of Ch'i. The Mogul and Persian empires resemble Han and Wei due to their central position. Germany, despite the respect accorded it by virtue of its title and former grandeur, is no longer an empire in reality; instead, Germany is on a par with France, Spain, or England. At most, Germany is a Han or a Wei; in lesser terms, a Sung or a Chung-shan. 

(Gloss: Due to the respect accorded it by other barbarian nations, Germany appears analogous to the Eastern Chou. But viewed in today's world situation, there is a big difference that stops me from drawing that parallel.) 

Our Divine Realm, due to its location east of the Ch'ing, would seem analogous to Yen, shielded from attack by Ch'i and Chao. But today the ocean is a raiders' highway; we alone cannot hope to escape the grim realities of war as Yen did in antiquity. Therefore, our position is more like that of Chou, bordered on by Han and Wei. France, Spain, and England all revere the same religion as Russia: Christianity. 

(Gloss: Some say that Spain and England revere different religions, but these are simply variant sects, so there is little real difference. What is more important, both employ religion to annex territories whenever and wherever they please.) 

It is only natural that these three countries conspire. They have already annexed Luzon and Java in the South Sea Islands, and have seized the Americas, located at the eastern end of the sea. 

198 

World Affairs 

The Great Powers are dividing up the earth. Today we find ourselves alone in a hostile world; we defend a solitary castle under attack by enemies who erect fortresses along our borders. 

The foremost adversary to stave off is Russia. If Turkey heeds conditions here in the east and coordinates troop movements accordingly, its power might keep Russia from striking in this direction. Or if the Mogul Empire allies itself with Turkey and they take over Persia [Russia's ally], this also would check Russia. The Manchu Ch'ing empire is the only nation besides ours unbefouled by either Islam or Christianity. 

(Gloss: Countries such as Korea and Annam also maintain their independence (tokuritsu) by remaining unconverted to those occult religions. But these states are small and weak, so I omit them from this discussion.) 

[Ch'ing China and our Divine Realm either stand or fall together:] "if the lips crumble, the teeth are naked and exposed."5 

54 

This is the world situation facing us today. We must adjust to it and remain flexible enough to deal with constantly changing conditions. At home we must set up adequate defenses; in our foreign policy, we must "counteract the enemy's stratagems in advance and deprive him of would-be allies."55 But to do all this, we first must select the right statesman-general.

## 6 The Barbarians' Nature 

For close to three hundred years now the Western barbarians have rampaged on the high seas. Why are they able to enlarge their territories and fulfill their every desire? Does their wisdom and courage exceed that of ordinary men? Is their government so benevolent that they win popular support? Are their rites, music, laws, and political institutions superb in all respects? Do they possess some superhuman, divine powers? Hardly. Christianity is the sole key to their success. It is a truly evil and base religion, barely worth discussing. But its main doctrines are simple to grasp and well-contrived; they can easily deceive stupid commoners with it. Using clever words and subtle phrases, they would have commoners believe that to deceive Heaven is to revere it, and that to destroy the Way is needed for ethical understanding. 

They win a reputation for benevolence by performing small acts of kindness temporarily to peoples they seek to conquer. After they capture a people's hearts and minds, they propagate their doctrines. Their gross falsehoods and misrepresentations deceive many, particularly those who yearn for things foreign. Such dupes, with their smattering of secondhand Western knowledge, write books with an air of scholarly authority; so even daimyo or high-ranking officials at times cannot escape infection from barbarian ways. Once beguiled by Christianity, they cannot be brought back to their senses. Herein lies the secret of the barbarians' success. 

Whenever they seek to take over a country, they employ the same method. By trading with that nation, they learn about its geography and defenses. If these be weak, they dispatch troops to invade the nation; if strong, they propagate Christianity to

The Barbarians' Nature 

subvert it from within. Once our people's hearts and minds are captivated by Christianity, they will greet the barbarian host with open arms, and we would be powerless to stop them. Our people would consider it an honor and a privilege to die for this foreign god, and this willingness to die, this fearlessness, would make them fit for battle. Our people would gladly cast their riches into the sacrificial coffers of this foreign god, and those riches would finance barbarian campaigns. The barbarians believe it their god's will that they seduce other peoples into subverting their respective homelands; they borrow the slogan "universal love" 56 to achieve their desired ends. Barbarian armies seek only plunder, but do so in the name of their god. They employ this tactic in all lands they annex or conquer. 

Only after developing their strength to the fullest did barbarian nations come to spy on us. The Portuguese were the first to enter our homeland (naichi). Their nation, Portugal, is under the control of Spain, but during the Tembun era [1532-54], it expanded greatly, annexing numerous islands in the South Sea and large parts of America. The Portuguese came to Kyūshū to propagate Christianity and incite our stupid masses to revolt, but they converted certain daimyo such as Ōtomo Sōrin and Konishi Yukinaga as well. 57 Oda Nobunaga himself erected a church to their god in Kyōto and invited barbarian clerics to preach there. As a result, Christianity gradually infected the realm. The barbarians quickly proceeded to comfort and care for the needy and distressed in an effort to capture our people's hearts and minds. When Oda Nobunaga perceived their ulterior motives, he vowed to destroy the church in Kyōto and eradicate all clerics from the land, but passed away before accomplishing this. 

(Gloss: When Nobunaga first decided to build the church, his trusted retainer, Gyōbu Masanori, tried to dissuade him, but to no avail. Nobunaga probably planned to use Christianity to subvert his enemies as he once subverted Araki Murashige, 58 But he soon realized his mistake and lamented, "Gyōbu was right about those Christians. I have heard of believers in Buddha giving alms to clerics, but never have I heard of 

201 

New Theses 

almsgiving from clerics to believers. Yet that is exactly what the barbarian clerics do. When they first came, they said they wanted to trade, but they do not seek profits. Quite the contrary, they engage in charitable works. They must be out to subvert out land.") 

Toyotomi Hideyoshi banished overseas all stupid commoners whose minds had been polluted by this barbarian religion, and Tokugawa Ieyasu strictly prohibited propagation of it or belief in it. Thereafter, barbarians like the English or Spanish might come to our land, but never again could they bring their religion. 

(Gloss: Tokugawa Ieyasu once sent a Nishi Munazane to the West, and he returned three years later. 59 Hideyoshi as well, sent a certain man named Ibi to the West, and he returned seven years later. 60 In both cases, the men were sent on reconnaissance missions, it is said, and they probably picked up a thorough knowledge of foreign languages. Without a doubt, their reports had much to do with the banning of Christianity. Iemitsu, in turn, sent an interpreter to India to inspect Buddhist temples there. His lordship undoubtedly had good reasons for doing so.) 

At the beginning of the Kan'ei era [1624-44], the bakufu passed edicts forbidding the casting of barbarian images and forcing all stupid commoners who had been Christians to tread on the Cross as a test of loyalty. The barbarians probably surmised that they could not evade this bakufu decree; the mere thought of paying anchor at Nagasaki struck fear in their hearts. Ch'ing writers who advocated razing churches and eradicating Christianity in their own land lauded our policies. 

(Gloss: The Hsi-ho chih and T'ai-wan chih are two good examples.) 

When state power is on the upswing, Heaven lends a helping hand. So it was at Shimabara. Heaven brought all the realm's Christians together in one castle so that they could be exterminated. At that time, the barbarians were doing their best to propagate Christianity in our land. The King of Poland sent his 

202 

The Barbarians' Nature 

niece, and the King of Navarre came in person, to win converts. But as soon as they arrived, they were cut down. 61 When other barbarians heard this news, they were so dejected that, according to one Ming writer, 62 they muttered to themselves, "[Japanese officials are so perceptive] they must have three eyes each." How gratifying to know that our nation's power looms this great in foreign eyes! 

(Gloss: The Ming writer [Su Nai-yü] records that this occurred in "the year of elder-brother, earth-tiger," which corresponds to 1638. In a supplementary note to his text, he wrote, "This 'three eyes' lament stems from the fact that these two persons had returned to Japan and resumed their proselytizing only to be executed." 

This note refers to the King of Navarre and the King of Poland's niece. But the King of Navarre was executed in 1636, two years before the year of elder-brother, earth-tiger, and the King of Poland's niece met her demise in 1639, one year after that year. Obviously, the Ming writer was mistaken. [I propose that our suppression of the Shimabara Rebellion was the true cause of the barbarians' dismay.] The Shimabara Christian insurgents were smitten in 1638, the year of elder-brother, earth-tiger. This event was more than enough to strike terror in the barbarians' hearts, but the Ming writer probably did not know this. That is probably why he attributed the Westerners' dismay to the executions of the two European nobles.) 

After we enjoyed peace and tranquillity for many years, the barbarians appeared again, this time the English, who begged permission to trade. 

(Gloss: The Nagasaki yawa has this to say about them. 63 "English ships frequently appeared in Nagasaki until the Genna era [1615-23], when they voluntarily closed their trading post and stopped coming; undoubtedly they realized that the times no longer favored them. But their mercenary spirit prompted them to return to Nagasaki in 1673, when they came begging permission to reopen trade. On that 

203New Theses 

occasion, their request was denied." If we think carefully about the significance of this passage, it seems to be a realistic assessment.) 

Next, Rome sent one of its clerics to propagate their faith surreptitiously among our people. 64 In this case, too, we foiled the barbarians' designs. But Russia has expanded tremendously of late. It utilized Christianity to seduce the Ezo tribes into submission and to capture island after island [to our north]. Now Russia has turned its predatory eyes on Japan proper (naichi). The English also appear at frequent intervals, furtively trying to beguile our commoners and peoples in outlying areas. Portugal was the first to use Christianity to spy on our Middle Kingdom, but was by no means the last. 

The peoples of Europe happen to be at war with each other now. But they all revere the same god. When the opportunity for a quick kill presents itself, they combine forces, and [after attaining victory,] divide the spoils. On the other hand, when they encounter difficulties, each withdraws to its own territory. This explains why we enjoy peace here in the east whenever there is strife in the west, and why there is peace in Europe whenever they venture to the east seeking plunder and territory. Russia, after subduing the lesser barbarians to the west, has turned its attention to the east. It has captured Siberia, and wants to infiltrate the Amur River area. But the Ch'ing empire, as strong as ever, is frustrating Russian designs there. As a countermove, Russia now is invading our Ezo territories. This is the same stratagem Ssu-ma Ts'o [of the Ch'in] used to conquer Shu; [that is, to build up one's troop strength by annexing easilyconquerable states to begin with, and only then take on large, powerful enemies]. Moreover, after its crushing defeat at the hands of K'ung-ge erh, 

(Gloss: I cannot identify this "K'ung-ge erh" for certain, but it probably refers to Germany. I have my own hypothesis about the etymology and Chinese transliteration of the name, but will not present it here. 65 Germany is no longer a great power, but the barbarian nations of the West still revere it as their mother country, and rushed to its defense against 

204 

The Barbarians' Nature 

Russia. From this, the Ch'ing historian who heard about Russia's defeat, erroneously inferred that Germany was a great power.) 

Russia concluded a treaty of peace. Now Russia probably will try to expand in the east to recoup her losses and obtain reparation monies [to pay the West]. For these reasons, it has stepped up spying operations in our waters. 

(Gloss: In the Gembun era [1736-40], a Russian ship appeared off the Mutsu and Awa coasts, but during the next few decades, Russian ships paid few visits to our land. The Russians concluded peace with K'ung-ge erh in 1770, and in the following year, a Russian named Benyowsky sailed by our eastern and southern coasts, measuring the ocean's depth and drawing a map of the Orient. He left a letter saying that Russia was about to launch an invasion of the Ezo Islands. 66 The next year, the Russians commenced hostilities against the Ezo to take over Uruppu, and after winning the natives over to their side with gifts, they captured it along with Shimoshiri. Next they infiltrated Nokkamapu, and lost no time disseminating their religion among the Ezo on Etorofu. Such events. prompted the bakufu to draw up plans to develop the Ezo wilderness.) 67 

First, the Russians confined themselves to drawing sketches and maps of our terrain and coastline and to studying our moves and countermoves. Then they began to seduce our commoners into their fold and politely requested permission to trade.68 But when we denied this request, they ravaged Ezo, seized our weapons, and set fire to our outposts there. 69 Then they requested permission to trade once more. 70 In other words, after slowly and methodically reconnoitering our position, they make their requests, sometimes under the cloak of politeness and correct protocol, sometimes accompanied by armed violence. They use every conceivable technique to achieve their ulterior motives, ulterior motives that are clear to any thinking man. 

But our temporizing, gloss-it-over officials say, "They only come for provisions of rice; there is no cause for alarm." What 

205 

New Theses 

simpletons! Unlike us, the barbarians eat flesh, not rice: A lack of rice should not bother them. 

(Gloss: This is not entirely true. They do eat rice, but only in the form of mochi [glutinous rice cakes].) 7 

Even if they did want rice, there are many rice-growing areas in their home countries, in their colonies, and in their allies' lands. 

(Gloss: India and the South Sea Islands all produce rice, as do other territories further to the south, no doubt. It is quite clear that their recent expansion has provided them with more than ample supplies of rice.) "2 

72 

They use trade to probe for weaknesses and disseminate their occult religion [among their victims.] Russia seeks to enrich and populate her eastern provinces of Kamchatka and Okhotsk with profits garnered from trade. Then she could raise and supply large armies right here on the eastern front [instead of transferring men and provisions from the west.] Trade, then, is her single stone to kill two birds; this is why she has stepped up operations in the east. She is now fully committed on this front, and will not desist until attaining her goals here. 

But the Russians have been strangely quiet of late, and in their place, the English have suddenly appeared. First they perpetrated violence in Nagasaki. 73 Then they forced their way into Edo Bay. 74 In short, the Russians, who have harbored designs on us for over one hundred years, suddenly disappear without a trace, and the English, who have rarely ventured to our coasts, just as suddenly zoom in to reconnoiter and probe. Can this be mere coincidence? Vicious birds of prey always pounce on their victims from dark shadows: The Russians are now hiding in wait for the kill. To facilitate their sly stratagem, they have English underlings do their reconnaisance work. 

(Gloss: Once a castaway from Owari was saved by an English ship, and one from Satsuma, by a Russian ship. When the two ships met on the high seas, the Owari castaway was transferred to the Russian vessel, and both were sent to Russia. 75 On another occasion, when guardsmen at our outposts on Karafuto 

206 

The Barbarians' Nature 

and Etorofu were captured by the Russians and interned in Kamchatka, an Englishman was among their interrogators. 76 This shows that the Russians and English are in league against 

us. 

Furthermore, in 1807, the year that the Russians assaulted the Ezo Islands, a merchant ship from Boston [the Eclipse] "just happened" to call at Nagasaki seeking firewood and water. This town of Boston is the site of England's magistrate in her American colony of New England. In other words, Russians violate our northland and New Englanders reconnoiter our southern coast. Can this be mere coincidence?) ?? 

77 

When Chu-ko Liang sought to conquer Wei, he first enlarged his army by conquering small states to the south and enlisting captured troops. But the Wei remained oblivious to Chu-ko's moves and were taken aback when he attacked in force. The Russians are trying to pull this same trick on us now; how can we be so witless when they are so clever? 

78 

The bakufu once made it plain to Russia that Japanese law requires us to destroy on sight any barbarian ship approaching our coasts. But now the English regularly appear and anchor off our shores, and we do not lift a finger to drive them away. [Quite the contrary, as in the recent Ōtsuhama affair,] when they have the gall to land, we go out of our way to provide for their needs and send them merrily along. Will the barbarians have any respect for our laws after they hear about this? The English come and go as they please, draw maps and sketch our terrain, disrupt our inter-island transport system, and win over our commoners with their occult religion and the lure of profit. If smuggling increases and we fail to stop commoners from aiding and abetting the barbarians, who knows what future conspiracies may hatch? 

But our temporizing, gloss-it-over officials reply, "The foreigners are just fishermen and merchants doing nothing out of the ordinary; there is no cause for alarm." What simpletons! The barbarians live ten thousand miles across the sea; when they set off on foreign conquests, "they must procure supplies and provisions from the enemy."" That is why they trade and 

207 

New Theses 

fish. Their men-of-war are self-sufficient away from home. If their only motive for harpooning whales was to obtain whale meat, they could do so in their own waters. Why should they risk long, difficult voyages just to harpoon whales in eastern seas? 

(Gloss: The waters off Greenland, for example, teem with whales. 80 That is why barbarian whalers from all over the world go there. Moreover, Greenland is but a short voyage from England.) 

Their ships can be outfitted for trading, or fishing, or fighting. Can anyone guarantee that their merchant vessels and fishing boats of today will not turn into warships tomorrow? The English barbarians come and anchor off our shores whenever they please; they learn all about convenient approaches to our islands, about the location of bays and inlets along our coastline, and about our climate and our people's spiritual make-up. Should we let them occupy the small islands off to our southeast, 

(Gloss: Many of these lie quite near the Ogasawaras.) 

and establish bases on Hachijōjima, Yaskushima, and Tanegashima, they would be in a perfect strategic position to invade our Middle Kingdom. This would be another case of two birds with one stone. It is easy to see why the English conspire with the Russians and spy on our coastal fortifications: They are eager to combine forces and obtain spoils. Their constant fishing and trading in our waters is essentially the same tactic that Chao Ch'ung-kuo used to conquer the Ti and Ch'iang; [that is, to eliminate any need to maintain cumbersome supply lines from home].81 How can we be so witless when the barbarians are so clever? 

But Heaven has not forsaken our Divine Realm. The bakufu has discerned the barbarians' cunning designs. It has prohibited efforts by commoners to aid and abet the barbarians, thereby nipping in the bud any possible conspiracies. The bakufu will also revive the practice of "treading the Cross," no doubt. Furthermore, it has ordered daimyo to sink on sight all barbarian ships. This will remind Russia that bakufu decrees-even 

208 

The Barbarians' Nature 

past bakufu decrees-are more than words on paper. Our armed might and our reputation as eagle-eyed extirpators of heresy will be revived and enhanced. Such a noble tactic, such heroic decisiveness! What better way to spark the samurai spirit and cow the barbarians into submission? 

But those ignorant of the bakufu's astute reasoning and farsightedness argue, "If we treat the barbarians with kindness, they will comply docilely; to intimidate them only invites reprisals." Such men cling to out-dated, erroneous views with unbelievable tenacity. They would have the bakufu issue injunctions when in fact the barbarians understand nothing but force. 

For hundreds of years the barbarians have desired and resolved to subvert enemy nations through their occult religion and thus conquer the whole world. They will not be deterred by occasional acts of kindness or displays of force. When they wreak vengeance against us, they intimidate us into backing down; when they submit meekly before us, they lull us into a false sense of security. They employ these two tactics "to probe for strengths and weaknesses."82 Those spied on can never fully fathom the thoughts and feelings of the spies: The barbarians "assume different guises and employ a variety of feints.' This forces us to commit ourselves one way or the other on each occasion and throws us off balance; so we often commit blunders in spite of ourselves. This should explain the acuity and astuteness behind the policy of armed expulsion. 

But some dimwits argue, "The warriors of our Divine Realm have been peerless throughout the world since antiquity. The barbarians are puny runts; there is no cause for alarm." True, the fighting men of our Divine Realm are brave and skilled in warfare, and our customs reinforce this [native martial spirit]. But times change; there are eras of weakness as well as strength. During the Warring States period [1467-1568], our warriors were truly fit for combat; proper movements on the battlefield were simple reflex actions. Our warriors proved their valor through actual battlefield achievements, such as capturing enemy banners or beheading enemy generals. But two hundred years have passed since our warriors last tasted battle. How many of them today are trained well enough to cope with the 

209 

New Theses 

sudden thrusts and feints or the other complexities of warfare? The weak-hearted would flee for their lives, disrupting the ranks; the courageous would die meaninglessly, their valor coming to naught. Our skill and valor do not guarantee victory. When the Mongols attacked [in 1274 and 1281], the military prowess of our Divine Realm was at its prime. But due to our ignorance of enemy formations and tactics, our valor counted for little. Our headlong charges led only to self-decimation. This is why I maintain that victory in war depends entirely on the statesmangeneral's stratagems and long-range planning. But the art of war as taught today consists of outmoded ideas and tactics employed by medieval generals like Takeda Shingen and Uesugi Kenshin. We do not observe foreign troops directly, nor do we gather information about them. Once war breaks out, they may engage us in a totally unexpected way, so it is a poor idea to rely solely on our reputation for valor. 

Again the dimwits argue, "Because the barbarians live across vast oceans, they can dispatch but few troops. If they be so foolhardy as to attack us, let them. There is no cause for alarm." But a skilled barbarian general may assess the tide of battle and the drift of wartime conditions, and adroitly adjust his strategems to turn our numbers against us. Sun Tzu says, "To take over the enemy's homeland intact is the best stratagem of all; to destroy it is only second best."84 An inept Japanese commander might well turn our numerical superiority to the enemy's advantage, so strength of numbers alone does not ensure victory. To cite an example, once in the past, nefarious commoners from Kyūshū illegally put to sea and became pirates. Just then the Ming dynasty was plagued by decay and insurrection. Naturally, the Chinese rebels welcomed these Kyūshū pirates into their ranks, and called themselves "Japanese raiders" (wako). They wreaked havoc along China's eastern seaboard almost every year. When they finally were apprehended and executed, it was discovered that only twenty-five Japanese nationals were among them. These twenty-five were extremely few in number, but by shrewdly exploiting given conditions, they did much to hasten the Ming dynasty's fall. The most 

210 

The Barbarians' Nature 

important factor in warfare is to overawe the enemy; superiority or inferiority of numbers is secondary. 

The skilled commander procures not only supplies from the enemy; he also conscripts manpower. The barbarians employ occult religions and other mysterious doctrines to seduce foreign peoples into their fold. Should they win our commoners over to their cause, their paucity of numbers would become a great multitude; they will have turned our numerical advantage against us. 

(Gloss: One Ming scholar 85 writes, "The Western barbarians are adept in the ways of intrigue. Whenever they arrive in a country, it is doomed because they conquer it from within by recruiting the local inhabitants into their ranks. Over thirty nations have fallen in this way.") 

Again the dimwits argue, "The barbarians' religion is a set of shallow, base doctrines. They may deceive stupid commoners with it, but they will never beguile our superior men (chün tzu). There is no cause for alarm." But the great majority of people. in the realm are stupid commoners; superior men are very few in number. Once the hearts and minds of the stupid commoners have been captivated, we will lose control of the realm. The ancient sage kings enforced harsh penalties for seditious and subversive activities (in the Book of Rites); such was their hatred. for those who incited stupid commoners to rebel. The barbarians' religion infiltrated Kyūshū once before, and spread like the plague among stupid commoners. Within less than a hundred years, two hundred eighty thousand converts were discovered and brought to justice. This indicates how fast the contagion can spread. Should we allow our stupid commoners to be deceived and converted once again, and in addition, should we permit nefarious lords such as Ōtomo Sōrin and Konishi Yukinaga to win over and employ these converts in furthering their wicked ends, the resulting insurrections will not be easy to suppress. It is of no avail for a few superior men to remain untouched by the pollution spreading around them. The immunity of superior men to Christianity does not permit complacence. 

211 

New Theses 

Again the dimwits argue, "Stupid commoners cannot be deceived and converted today because Christianity is strictly prohibited. Though the barbarians may display trifling shrewdness, there is no cause for alarm." The barbarians have been unable to work their wiles on us up to now only because the bakufu hast strictly outlawed Christianity. And I might add, the people of the realm are very fortunate that it has. Nevertheless, the fact remains that mysterious evils are spreading throughout the land today, though under different names and in different forms. If the barbarians decide to work their wiles on us, they need not restrict themselves to old methods; they will adopt new ones. 

The natural feelings of the people are such that they cannot but covet personal gain and hold the spirits in awe. Should someone capture their hearts by furtively appealing to such natural feelings, prohibition is impossible, no matter how harsh our penalties may be. For example, gambling and conspiratorial parties are strictly prohibited at present. But drifters, gamblers, and other nefarious elements swagger through the countryside, meeting clandestinely at night and dispersing at dawn. The reason we cannot bring them under control lies in the people's love of gain. Or again, prayers and incantations of various weird sorts designed to secure personal fortune and happiness are used by group leaders to call and bind together fellow-believers. The reason these bands are intermittently suppressed only to spring up again lies in the people's fear of spirits. 

(Gloss: The fuju fuse sect of Nichiren Buddhism, 86 the Human Lotus Sacrificial Sect,87 and other such groups have been uprooted. But recently, countless new forms of pseudoBuddhistic miscreancy have arisen. The so-called Fuji Association, 88 for example, already has some seventy thousand adherents, it is believed. All such conspiratorial groups are made up of persons who hold spirits in awe.) 

Should we again allow the barbarians to take advantage of the people's love of gain and fear of spirits, this time allowing them to lead our masses down evil paths other than Christianity itself, no law actually would be violated, but our people's hearts and minds would be captured just the same. What good do laws alone 

212 

The Barbarians' Nature 

do? We must ponder this point carefully. Those who indulge in rumination without accurate knowledge or who are overly attentive to details without long-range, comprehensive policies are little more than blind men destined to fall prey to barbarian wiles. History has shown that such men, though adept enough at polemics or pedantry, are little more than desultory sophists. Confucius had them in mind when he said, "I detest clever talkers who bring the state to ruin." 

The barbarians coming to spy on our Middle Kingdom during the past three hundred years arrived one after another from various nations. Though their homelands differ, they all revere the same god. This means that Christianity has had designs on our Middle Kingdom for the past three hundred years. In dealing with this [sustained threat], our Middle Kingdom has on each occasion adopted a different policy based on the thenprevalent opinion. The predators have a firm, fixed objective and steadfastly try to achieve it; the prey intermittently changes its defense posture, at times assuming the hard-line, at times, the soft-line, always vacillating between the two. Who can guarantee that the predators forever will meet frustration trying to discover our weaknesses? To turn our vacillation into constancy of purpose and eliminate the weaknesses we possess, we first must fully understand the barbarians' nature. We first must fully understand the barbarians' nature. 

213

## 7 National Defense 

To defend the nation and improve military preparedness, we first must determine our fundamental [foreign] policy-war or peace. Otherwise we will drift aimlessly, morale and discipline will slacken, high and low will indulge in the ways of ease and comfort, intelligent men will be unable to devise stratagems, and courageous men will be unable to work up their anger. Some people today fritter away precious time, assume an air of unruffled sedateness, and allow the barbarians slowly but steadily to attain final victory over us. In truth, this composure masks the cowardice in their hearts, a cowardice that precludes bold decisiveness. 

By contrast, when the Mongols sullied our honor [in the thirteenth century], Hōjō Tokimune resolutely beheaded their envoy and ordered that an army be raised to smite them. His Imperial Majesty, Emperor Kameyama, prayed that disaster befall himself rather than the nation. In that hour of crisis, we willingly courted oblivion and the people ceased fearing death. Indeed, did anyone not aspire to die ardently in the realm's defense! Hence, we once again attained spiritual unity, and the purity and intensity of our sincerity unleashed a raging typhoon that destroyed the barbarian fleet. Ah, the ancients expressed it well when they said, "Place a man between the jaws of death, and he will emerge unscathed."89 Or again, "If officials and commoners are led to believe that savage hordes are closing in, fortune will be with us."90 Therefore I say that we must once and for all establish our basic foreign policy and place the realm between the jaws of death. Only then can we implement defense measures. 

A discourse on war or peace seems out of place now because the barbarians seek only trade; hostilities have yet to break out. 

214 

National Defense 

But those ignorant of the evils stemming from trade are in truth too timid to assume a warlike stance, and inevitably they adopt policies of conciliation. Those who would strictly ban trade are immune to fear and unperturbed even if the consequences of their bold decision led to war. As a rule, if we make up our minds to do something, we usually achieve it. Now that the Expulsion Edict has been proclaimed and war has been decided on, the realm has a sense of purpose and direction. Only now will I present my proposals for national defense. 

We must carry out four categories of reforms: 

(1) Internal Administration. There are four specific items under this general heading: (a) reviving the samurai spirit, (b) prohibiting presumptuous luxury, (c) ensuring the people's livelihood, and (d) promoting men of ability. 

First, reviving the samurai spirit. Licentiousness among warriors stems from their lack of shame. To foster a healthy sense of shame in them, we must institute a system of rewards and punishments. These rewards and punishments must be based on the affection between parent and child and be meted out according to the criteria of loyal devotion. When rewards are called for, not even enfeoffments or ministerial posts should be begrudged; when punishments are called for, not even royal personages or high-ranking officials should be exempted. "Favoritism and other heinous irregularities cannot be tolerated"91 as long as righteousness and the Way exist. In times of peace, the ruler must do everything in his power to inspire his ministers, especially the complacent or hidebound among them. If he follows the practices established by Tokugawa Ieyasu and other wise leaders of that era to exhort and discipline his retainers, the samurai spirit will revive. 

Second, prohibiting presumptuous luxury. Whenever presumptuous luxury appears, poverty develops and the morals of high and low alike inevitably decline. Then bribery and graft occur, and malice and discontent pervade the realm. To remedy this situation we must straighten out government finances, teach men the difference between good and evil, and make expenditures conform to income. Domain finances must be restored to a sound, normal footing, and the distinction of high and low 

215 

New Theses 

must be upheld. Most of all, His Lordship should take the initiative and set an example for all by setting his household affairs in order, cleaning up administration, curtailing waste, eliminating inefficiency, rescinding complex or cruel regulations, and slashing expenditures for private construction projects or personal recreation. None of these proposals is new; all were introduced in antiquity. To eradicate presumptuous luxury, the ruler must make men forget about outward appearances and esteem sincerity above all else. To make men forget about outward appearances, he must get them to believe that they "are all aboard the same ship [of state], riding out the present storm together [or sinking together]."92 To induce his people to feel concern for one another's livelihood, he must spell out the evils now plaguing the realm and inspire them to bear any burden, to withstand any suffering. If he carefully selects, trains, and outfits troops, and if he persuades the high and low alike to live each day prepared for war, the realm will be ready to meet any contingency. Thereafter he need only abide by regulations and practice diligence and austerity. Then the ways of presumptuous luxury will disappear. 

(Gloss: After we beheaded the Mongol envoy at the beginning of the Kenji era [1275-77], we decided to give the enemy a sound drubbing. We slashed expenditures and practiced austerity at all levels of government, and [with the revenues thus saved,] cultivated armed strength. When a ruler issues laws to his people in this fashion, high and low alike are instilled with resolution and a desire to be prepared. Only then is government on a sound fiscal basis possible.) 

Third, stabilizing the people's livelihoods. Agriculture is vital to the people's lives; it must take priority over the crafts and commerce, which are of secondary importance. We must regulate production, equalize the distribution of wealth in the realm, levy corvées only in the off-season so as not to obstruct agricultural production, institute the equal-field system to prevent the concentration of lands by the wealthy, root out nefarious elements from the countryside, chastise the indolent, carry out relief measures for the disabled and needy, reactivate the ten-man 

216 

National Defense 

and five-man control systems, issue injunctions concerning mutual cooperation and surveillance, enrich the people, and increase domain population. Above all, we must induce the people to be filial and respectful, to care for the elderly, the orphaned, the widowed, and others in society who have no one to depend on. These measures are to ensure the people's well-being and have been proposed since antiquity. To implement them today, we must make high and low alike feel a genuine concern for one another, and this concern can be imbued in the people only through actual deeds, not through vain preaching. 

Hence, by preparing the nation for war, we could stockpile food and supplies each and every year with the same sense of urgency as though last fall's crop had failed, and we could get the people to work at their jobs with the same diligence and intensity that they would display in beating off enemy marauders. The people's hearts would be united, their efforts would be coordinated, and not a single idler would remain among them. Thereafter, all we would need to do is issue injunctions and conduct benevolent rule. Then the people's livelihood would be ensured. 

Fourth, promoting men of ability. The ancients compared men of ability to tigers roaming loose in the mountains: Neither may be left as is. By rewarding able men with government posts, political gravity is shifted from the periphery to the center; whereas if these men go unrecognized, political gravity remains on the periphery; and in the worst of all possible cases, if able men are allowed to remain in their domains, they are utterly beyond the reach of central [bakufu] control. Unless we make this central authority the focus of political gravity, we will not command respect in the realm. That is why the sages placed men of talent and ambition in ministerial posts where they could express their views on state policy. They monopolized the energies of ambitious men for state purposes and prompted the people to love and respect their government as children love their parents.

posts. 93 After the implementation of the Taiho Code, sons in provincial schools were enabled to enroll at the state university in the capital. On completing their studies, they took civil service examinations, and if successful in these, received office. [On the continent,] the Yü, Hsia, Shang, and Chou had systems of education, and the various feudal lords also maintained programs under which promising young nobles in their domains were sent to study in the capital. All this shows the importance attached to finding, training, and employing men of talent in antiquity. No man of ability went unrecognized. 

State affairs are many and varied. If officials come from only one area, debate and policy formation will be monotoned and one-sided, since the men taking part all will have similar backgrounds and attitudes. Government would inevitably suffer from favoritism, narrowness of vision, and factionalism, rather than deal with matters in a manner equitable to the whole realm. That is why the sages paid so much attention to discovering and employing men of ability from all over the realm. The sage king, Yü, for example, said, "The ruler must employ men of talent. If not, he will fare well in nothing." Upon pondering the meaning of these words, we realize why Shun utilized the goods deeds of others to do good himself, and why he did nothing, yet kept the realm well ordered.) 

Before we can promote men of talent, we must understand the correct method: Listen to what he says, look at what he does, and if he demonstrates his worthiness through actual deeds of merit, confer appropriate posts and titles on him. If we place the realm's talented men in a position to express their opinions fully and freely whatever these may be, we will relieve their pent-up frustrations. Then all of them will present their views enthusiastically in state councils. If we judge men by what they accomplish, they will have to turn their words into actual deeds. This would distinguish the wise from the foolish and the capable from the incompetent at a glance. We will bar from advancement those who are all talk and no action. This will promote the virtues of self-effacement and deference to superiors. If we confer posts and titles only on those who prove their worth 

218 

National Defense 

through meritorious deeds, men of real ability will demonstrate it in concrete achievements. Then everyone in the realm will respect them and follow their example. Government will gain the services of all talented men, and they will propose and execute policies for the common good, with no tinge of bias. Who, then, would refuse to recognize and submit to central [bakufu] authority? 

(2) The Military Command. There are three specific items under this general heading: (a) eliminating haughtiness from the ranks, (b) increasing troop strength, and (c) improving methods of training. 

First, eliminating haughtiness from the ranks. Without a doubt, crack troops should command our respect. But insolent, overbearing troops both abuse the people and deprave morals at home, and flee before enemy spears and ruin military discipline at the front-which leads a nation to defeat. We must weed out such elements carefully at the start, so that we can train and discipline the remaining troops properly. Only then will we be able to ward off enemy attacks and take the offensive ourselves. Second, increasing troop strength. Troop strength is difficult to increase because warriors are clustered together in castletowns where they idly fritter away their rice stipends [and cannot maintain personal retainers]. To remedy this situation, we must study past and present military systems thoroughly, and increase troop strength by instituting an appropriate system of samurai-farmers that would allow us to meet any demand for more military manpower. 94 Moreover, attack from abroad normally occurs in conjunction with subversion at home. At present, swarms of nefarious commoners brandish swords and guns. They flock together like wild birds to drink, gamble, and pillage. After their evildoing has ended, they scatter like leaves before an autumn gale, only to flock together on another occasion. The countryside is a breeding ground for these subversives, 95 where they terrorize good, hardworking subjects, and present a sinister threat to the state. Should famine or plague occur [to aggravate the situation], who knows what crises would emerge, and should the barbarians take advantage of this situation to recruit our commoners into their ranks, the 

219 

New Theses 

resulting horrors would be frightful indeed! We must act now to adjust our policies. If there are soldiers on the land to defend it, rebellion by subversives from within can be averted, attack from abroad can be deterred, and other unexpected crises can be nipped in the bud. 

Third, improved methods of training. Drilling troops is neither a game, nor an exhibition. Military drill is to train warriors for real combat; all frills and stylistic elements must go. Drilling should center on signal flag and battle drum as actually employed in battle. We should drop useless, empty theories and make simplicity the rule, so that commands are easy to understand and execute. We should test the men's skills regularly on hunting expeditions or by making them pursue and apprehend fugitives. The men should be subjected to arduous duties of all sorts, inured to pain, hunger, and the elements, forced to march long distances wearing heavy armor, and accustomed to harsh training and discipline in order to cultivate toughness of mind and spirit. Only when tough in mind and spirit, will they be fearless and able to meet any contingency; only then will they be of use in wartime. 

(3) Domain Finances. Most daimyo today are indolent and indulge in consumption not permitted to their status. Their tax systems lack regularity and their finances are in disorder. Their poverty is entirely of their own making. Throughout their lifetimes they live in the lap of luxury; they are mollycoddled by women in their inner chambers, duped by flatterers, and shielded from pain or difficulty. 

At present, the great and small lords remain within domain borders because they are bound by fealty oaths to a common overlord, the bakufu (kokka). They uphold the [state] just as a centipede's legs support its body; so there is no fear that our political structure will collapse suddenly. Hence, the bakufu should make these daimyo shoulder some of the military burdens that it now bears alone, and force them to assume responsibility for defending their own local regions. It should order the daimyo to reform their domains with as much urgency as though they were locked in mortal combat. It should periodically check the state of each domain's preparedness, 

220 

National Defense 

apportioning rewards and punishments not on the basis of traditional house-rankings, but as it deems proper case by case. Above all, the bakufu must make each daimyo realize the urgency of ministering to his subjects' needs. If the samurai spirit is revived, if extravagant ways are suppressed, if the people's livelihood is ensured, if men of ability are placed in positions of authority, if regulations are adhered to scrupulously, if finances are kept in the black, and if the people are spared maltreatment and abuse, domain wealth and strength is a matter of course. 

All domains suffer financial distress because merchants monopolize the right to deal in rice. 96 Warriors cannot avoid dealing with merchants, since they must procure all necessities of life from the marketplace with money obtained by selling rice. For this reason, warriors suffer constant torment from rising costs. Moreover, the ceremonial offerings that the various domains make to the bakufu each year are all crafted and sold by artisans. and merchants (except for a few food products famous in certain areas). Such items are mere ornaments of metal, bamboo, or lacquered wood, totally devoid of practical value. But they must be stamped "certified" by the appropriate licensed craftsman or merchant. Nowadays, daimyo hire townsmen [to replace the hereditary retainers they can no longer afford to maintain] as road clearers in front of their processions. Daimyo who hold banquets obtain the services of cooks and caterers from the city. In the furnishings of their mansions, in their attire, in the number of concubines and maidservants they support, in their pastimes and diversions; in short, in every aspect of their lives, a customary and extremely expensive "proper level of expenditure" has arisen, known as "daimyō yaku.' The daimyo must adhere rigidly to this unwritten set of standards as though it were an ancestral law that not even the most powerful of them might dare alter. 97 

When daimyo desert their domains for Edo, bringing, as they do, the bulk of their tax revenues, their subjects eagerly follow suit. This leaves the countryside barren and destitute. To transform destitution into wealth, we must above all free ourselves from the fetters of custom. Of course, not all customs today 

221 

New Theses 

deserve to be abolished, and not all past customs deserve to be revived. The Great Hero must weigh the relative merits and demerits of each case. He drops meaningless ritual to achieve actual results by discerning the right time and adopting the proper 

measure. 

(4) The Deployment of Defense Forces. At present, the daimyo and their defense forces are concentrated in Edo. The original objective of this policy was to shift the nation's military center of gravity from the outlying provinces to the center [the bakufu]. But in Edo, warriors live in idleness and develop lavish, licentious habits-and this in truth weakens the realm. If but one strategic area in the nation is vulnerable to barbarian attack, our defenses contain a fatal weakness. Kyōto lies at the realm's forehead, Edo, at its heart. Ōsaka constitutes its midsection, and the Sagami [Kanagawa] and Bōsō [Chiba] peninsulas form Edo's jaws. The Ise and Atsuta Shrines house the Three Imperial Treasures and harbor the realm's "divine vital force" (shen ch'i). We must maintain strict security in all these strategic areas. But our defense forces are not well-organized or systematically deployed anywhere. Fortifications, for example, exist in some areas but not in others. How can we instill a sense of crisis in the people when such is the case? Appropriate security measures should be drawn up immediately. 

Nagasaki Bay was originally fortified because that is where we make barbarian ships call. But today, the barbarians recognize no spot along our coastline to be off-limits and call wherever they please. In essence, the whole realm is [no different from] Nagasaki. Why isn't the whole realm fortified?98 As for the Ezo territories and other overseas islands (kaigai no shoto), unless we dispatch officials and expeditionary forces to these areas, we can gain no accurate and detailed information, and will be unable to win the reverence and allegiance of inhabitants there. 

(Gloss: Most people today believe that there is nothing to gain by taking over Ezo, and nothing to lose by leaving it as is. Is this really so? If we do not seize these islands, the barbarians surely will. What is more, if we allow them to establish a staging area there from which to attack Matsumae, the entire 

222 

National Defense 

northern Honshu area will face the threat of insurrection, and if we allow their raiding parties to ravage our coasts, the whole realm will be threatened. True, even if we do not take over Ezo, the barbarians may choose to leave it alone, and in that case, there is nothing to worry about. But if, by our failure to act, we allow them to gain this territory, it will do them a world of good, and us, a world of harm. So we must do everything in our power to seize and defend it.) 

We must formulate plans to develop and control this vital area, and must also make the daimyo in coastal domains shore up their defenses to eliminate any points of vulnerability. Then their warriors, now concentrated in Edo, can be deployed in their respective home domains. Then all habits of ease and luxury will be at an end: If the daimyo and their vassals resolutely man their lonely coastal garrisons, they cannot enjoy the city's pleasures. Their troops, inured to hardship and accustomed to garrison life, will be ready for any contingency. Only then will the realm's strategic areas be secure. 

These, then, are the four general reforms we must undertake: internal administration, the military command, domain finances, and defense. I have presented my views on these topics in broad outline form: Once the main points are clear, the details can be worked out. The Great Hero must discern the right time and adopt the proper measures. There is no reason not to meet today's needs by implementing policies that did not exist in antiquity, for with proper study, this can be done. 

Next, I discuss five specific programs to implement: (1) coastal garrisons, (2) communications networks, (3) a coast guard, (4) manufacturing firearms, and (5) stockpiling materiel and provi- 

sions. 

(1) Coastal Garrisons. Presently, no spot along our coastline is immune to barbarian attack. Should the enemy land at some point, troops must be dispatched [from the nearest castletown, which might take days]. They would arrive exhausted, and would be too late to do any good. Therefore, we must implement a system of fortifications regularly manned by military units. Since Keichō and Genna times [1596-1623], building more than one 

223New Theses 

castle per province has been prohibited. This law was designed to check the power of potentially rebellious daimyo, and it was applied uniformly throughout the realm. Although we cannot alter it now, we must take steps to deal with the barbarian menace. Unless we build fortifications along the coast, where local inhabitants may collect forces, we will have no rallying point to instill spiritual solidarity in them. Unless we organize the people into neighborhood [militia] units, we will be unable to tap their energies. 

The way of the soldier consists of regularized maneuvers and skills. With proper training, even women and children can be made to brave fire and water to beat off an attack; without it, even grown men will scatter before an invading host. [Unless appropriate steps are taken] all people in coastal regions will flee for the hills under enemy assaults. The barbarian dogs and goats would trample us underfoot, and nothing could save us. For this reason, the ancients built fortifications in outlying 

areas. 

(Gloss: In the "Defense" section of the Taiho Code, it is written, "The people living in frontier regions to the east, north, and west will be deployed in fortifications except when cultivating their fields, when they shall erect [and live in] temporary dwellings. During the farming season, the able-bodied are to leave the fortifications, labor in the fields, and return after harvest time. All necessary repair work on the fortifications will be done in the off-season." The Ryō no gige reads, "An embankment' is a high earthen barrier to ward off bandits.") 

We cannot revive this ancient system completely, but certainly some aspects of it warrant adaptation to meet today's needs. 

Warriors originally were divorced from the soil to weaken the realm and to prevent wars from breaking out in provincial areas. But unless we garrison warriors in peripheral areas, we will not be able to defend ourselves against barbarian enemies. If we dispatch troops from a castletown to defend coastal areas, they will exhaust their strength on long marches back and forth, and the people along the way will rise up in vigorous 

224 

National Defense 

protest. On the other hand, if we enlist local commoners into militia service, their luxurious, slothful habits will make them demand high rates of pay. Moreover, they simply would be posted to warn of the enemy's approach; they would not actually fight. In advancing, they would seek to achieve no great feats of heroism, and in retreating, they would hold military discipline in contempt. Our only enlistees would be feeble old men or indolent delinquents, and neither would do us much good. 

In addition, the lands to support troops [with rations] are already held in perpetuity by the peasants, and cannot be confiscated for this purpose. Generally speaking, agricultural lands in or near the realm's strategic areas are valuable, and the peasants living there are not destitute [enough to abandon these]. Agricultural lands not already under peasant control are few and far between, which means that there is very little land to distribute to the garrisons. But to supply them with rice [instead of rice fields] would be many times more expensive, since this rice first must be taxed from the peasantry, and then distributed to the men. Therefore we could not sustain a great number of troops. 

(Gloss: We could support the troops by giving them tracts of land to cultivate, and allow each man a five to six koku tax exemption. At present, some daimyo employ such a system. On the other hand, if we allotted each man a rice stipend, much more rice would be needed to begin with, since taxes [on that five koku] computed at the usual rate of forty percent would amount to but two koku, which, of course, is insufficient for one household's annual needs. In other words, a two koku stipend could not support a soldier's family, but a five koku plot of land could. 99 This is the difference between rice fields and rice itself.) 

Many people have pointed out these problems, but if we implemented a system that took the peasants' interests into account, we could reduce our expenses and still secure steady tax revenues. Generally speaking, lands that have gone to waste are found in oppressively-taxed, poor areas, and lands not yet under 

225 

New Theses 

cultivation are infertile and of low value. In the realm's strategic areas, few wastelands or uncultivated lands exist, but in coastal areas, they can still be found. We must persuade troops to live on and cultivate such lands, exempting taxes if these be heavy, or supplying farm implements if the soil be unproductive. If some local peasants choose to enlist and enter the ranks, we should assess their holdings and exempt these from taxation. Thus, we would realize the original motive [of rulers in antiquity] for establishing garrisons. 

The sea is an inexhaustible source of wealth we can exploit to cover the costs of building ships and maintaining maritime forces. It is both a training ground for our seamen and a source of food to sustain them wherever they may go. The Man of Talent and Virtue must devise the correct system to recruit brave, well-trained captains and crews. 

The nation's defense must not be a burden for the garrisons to bear alone. The realm's pains and pleasures must be shared by all if our forces are to be of use. Garrison troops support themselves through farming and fishing, and they undergo rigorous training in their spare time. When the enemy approaches, it is they who first see action. Their lot is harsh indeed! But what of those warriors who live the year around amid the comforts of the city? Not one of them finds pleasure in defending the state. We must toughen them up on military drills and manuevers. We must inure them to hardship by making them go on hunts, apprehend fugitives, build roads and bridges, clear fields, and perform other unpleasant tasks. We must not permit the warriors in castletowns to indulge in license and debauchery. We must also make the peasant, artisan, and merchant classes realize that the realm is in dire peril, that only by hard work, frugality, and compliance with our laws, can they escape the horrors of war. We must convince the garrison troops that not only they, but everyone in the realm, is making sacrifices, that they should pluck up their courage to perform heroic feats. Only after we achieve all this, will our armed forces be of use. 

A system of coastal fortifications, injunctions to create neighborhood [militia] units, the equal distribution of burdens 

226 

National Defense 

in the realm-all are requisites of national defense. We must deliberate on these matters thoroughly while we still have time. 

(2) Communications Networks. At present, observation towers do exist in coastal areas, but are few in number and isolated from each other. This makes sending and receiving messages between towers on hilltops all but impossible. Many observation posts lack the signal fires, flags, rockets, and other necessary equipment, or else the lookouts there are ignorant of the proper codes. These lookouts can only stare blankly at the open sea, and when the barbarians appear, they must report this fact to the authorities on foot. Since barbarian ships traverse miles in a matter of minutes, but our lookouts go on foot to report news of their approach, it is no surprise that their reports are too late to be of help. 

By contrast, the law texts of antiquity state that observation towers existed in all frontier areas, everyone clearly understood the signal codes, and commanding officers supervised the lookout squads posted there. 

(Gloss: In the "Defense" section of the Taihō Code, it says, "Signal posts may be set up at any convenient intervals, provided these posts are within sight of each other. Two officers shall be in command at each. At regular hours of the day and night, each post along the line will relay signals by smoke or fire. If the post immediately next to one's own fails to pass on the signal promptly, runners should be dispatched to find out why, and the entire mishap should be reported to the provincial governor....") 100 

If we improve on these ancient systems, if we place observation towers within sight and earshot of each other, if we standardize signal systems and codes, if we keep lookouts under strict supervision and spur them on with rewards and punishments, we will never be caught off guard. 

Since information is conveyed through our way-station system, its efficiency is imperative. If the distance between stations. is too long, inhabitants along the way are spared toil and trouble, but horse and rider become exhausted. Yet if way-stations are too close together, more of them must be built, frequent 

227 

New Theses 

demands on the local inhabitants must be made, and increased regulations and procedures along the line may actually cause delays. 

At present, there are too many way-stations, and too many people jam the nation's road system on trivial personal business. This places great burdens on local inhabitants. An extreme example is that of lowly cooks and quartermasters who think nothing of traversing the nation's highways on non-official business. All of this interferes with the peasants' work at the busiest time of the year and hinders agricultural production by depriving it of precious labor. How can such abuses be excused in a time of peace and security? Furthermore, we do not distinguish urgent from routine business when using way-station facilities. The same plow-horse or man-carriage may serve in an emergency and on a leisurely excursion. 

(Gloss: One Ch'ing writer boasts, "Our road and communications network is of the highest quality. Our western border, five thousand li away, can be reached in nine days; Hopei, Honan, and Sian can be reached in five. When Wu San-kuei launched his rebellion, he discovered that due to our good communications network, government forces were well prepared for him. He bemoaned his fate to Heaven, 'Alas, we cannot even begin to fight."" 

This writer goes on to state, "The Sung and Chin maintained a system of express runners and way-stations used exclusively in times of war or rebellion. But a distance of three hundred li per day was the best that either could attain. Never in history has a system achieved over five hundred li per day. This was due partly to the soft, lazy ways of the people and to the lack of proper training for runners. But the main responsibility lay with poor government planning. Our present-day system is far superior to anything that existed before. In emergencies, we can deliver messages at speeds of over six hundred li per day, and we maintain regularly scheduled communications with even the remotest rural districts." This shows that a nation's road and communications network depends on its leaders' skill at institutional planning.) 

228 

National Defense 

Since the Keichō and Genna eras [1596-1623], intercourse with overseas countries has been strictly prohibited, but in recent years, the barbarians have begun to seduce commoners in outlying areas again. It is extremely difficult to detect and ferret out stupid commoners who stealthily aid and abet the wily barbarians at sea. 101 Unless we institute an exhaustive system of informants and collective responsibility among commoners and assign able officers to investigate these illicit activities thoroughly, we will remain ignorant of the evildoings now perpetrated in our bays and inlets. 

Thus, erecting coastal watchtowers, improving roads and relay systems, discovering methods to detect and ferret out nefarious commoners-all are of prime concern to leaders charged with developing communications networks. We must deliberate on these matters thoroughly while we still have time. 

(3) A Coast Guard. In defending a castle, one [cannot remain within its walls, but] must engage the enemy outside. Likewise, in maritime defense [one must engage the enemy at sea].102 The barbarians feel completely at home on the water and are superb at naval warfare. To repulse them, our warships must be of the finest quality, and our techniques of navigation must be highly refined. Establishing coast guard forces does not require us to assemble all men in one place and make them undergo military training for extended periods of time. But we must accustom the realm's warriors to deck life so that their normal functional skills are unimpaired on rough waters. Also, they must be able to handle large vessels as deftly as they now guide rowboats. The men must be put to work aboard transports or fishing boats so that they acquire sea legs and master skills such as how to steer, how to enter and leave harbors, how to adjust to shifting tides, how to sail in fair or foul weather, and how to use the compass and similar devices. All this will prepare them for service in a coast guard. 

We should assign daimyo the tasks of building large, sea-going vessels. They would undertake this construction work as part of, and in accordance with, the prescribed duties of military service they now owe the bakufu. 

229 

New Theses 

(Gloss: In other words, shipbuilding should be thought of as similar to corvées that the bakufu now levies on daimyo.) 

The vessels that cach daimyo builds must be sturdy and well puttogether, no less so than barbarian ships, for domain troops will be onboard and will see action in an attack. 

(Gloss: In the "Construction and Public Works" section of the Taihō Code, it says, "An appropriate number of troops shall be dispatched from the capital to guard government ships wherever these be stationed.") 

Accordingly, bakufu officials should supervise shipping operations. We must select these overseers with great care, since they will wield considerable authority. They must hold ranks high enough to command a large number of lesser officials, and must receive generous stipends to eliminate any need to accept graft. In peacetime we could use the ships to transport rice to Ōsaka or Edo. This also would let us transfer to the bakufu the right to deal in rice-a right now monopolized by merchants. This would free the daimyo from their dependence on profit-mongering merchants. Later on, we could conduct regular training sessions and military reviews to evaluate the performance of men and ships. If we upgrade our coast guard to the point where it can clear the enemy from our waters, we may go to war without fear. Then the barbarians' impudent behavior off our coasts will be at an end. "When we choose to fight, they will be unable to evade us; when we choose not to fight, they will be unable to harass us."103 Only in this way can we gain the freedom of initiative to control them. 

Some say, "We should mount cannon along our coast and repulse the barbarians from shore when they approach."104 I do not belittle the importance of cannon. But they, along with other projectile weapons, must be fired at close range to be effective, 105 for their value lies in their shock effect, which temporarily throws the enemy into confusion. Our seamen must make a speedy attack utilizing small arms fire in boats of their own following the initial cannon barrage; cannon alone cannot demolish a strong enemy naval force. Boats on the water 

230 

National Defense 

are extremely hard targets, and since barbarian ships are sturdily built, more than one or two direct hits is needed to sink them. At present, we do not conduct military training onboard ships; instead, we remain on shore and hope to demolish enemy fleets far out at sea. Can we be serious? Cannon are profitably employed in coastal defense only when mounted on high ground overlooking inlets or straits where barbarian ships are certain to anchor or pass. How can anyone maintain that mounting cannon along our shoreline is an effective way to defend our coasts? 

(Gloss: When Arima clansmen burned and sank a Portuguese ship in the Keichō era [1596-1614], they employed small attack rafts and boats with flaming bales of straw piled on board. Kuroda clansmen used this same tactic to sink a barbarian ship in the Kyōhō era [1716-35]. 106 In Ch'i Chi-kuang's "Attacking Fortresses Surrounded by Water," 107 it says that "the standard range of firearms and flaming arrows is about fifty paces," but that "these weapons should not be used at such distances in an attack. Instead, small boats should press in on the enemy stronghold and pump these missiles in at close range." This is a prime example of Ming techniques for fighting on the water. Western barbarians, on the other hand, fire on each other's warships or attack in small boats lowered from the mother craft. When Coxinga demolished barbarian ships, he always plunged in through their cannon eyelets and set fire to the vessels from within their holds. All these examples clearly show that to sink and obtain victory over enemy fleets, we must attack them at close range in boats of our own.) 

Some say, "We should not fight the barbarians on the water; it is unwise to try beating them at their own game. Instead, we should lure them ashore and only then engage them." Such reasoning is not fallacious. But the battle-wise barbarians will hardly discard their own forte and do battle as we would like. They will anchor off our coasts and disrupt our transport system [blocking the flow of food and supplies to Edo]. In the meantime they will probe carefully for weak spots in our defenses and wait for the right moment to attack. They zoom 

231 

New Theses 

from place to place like lightning. How could we engage them on our own terms? How could we even keep track of their whereabouts? 

The barbarians have full confidence in their own capabilities and hold nothing in fearful awe. They threaten in one spot and strike in another; they remain motionless, yet dominate peoples. We cannot launch a single raft 108 against them. We run around in circles on shore, and only wear ourselves out. The barbarians act as they very well please, and we can do nothing to stop them. Quite the contrary, flustered as we are, we simply play into their hands. Just how are we to "lure them ashore" in the first place? 

Spirit (chi) is the key to victory in battle. When troops have full confidence in their own capabilities and hold nothing in fearful awe, their powers are heightened many times over by a feeling of inner spiritual strength. If we allow ourselves to fall behind the barbarians in military techniques, our inner spiritual strength will wither away before the battle begins. How could we attack and destroy them with confidence or composure? 

Shipping originated [here in Japan] during the Age of the Gods. 109 Only later did it spread to foreign lands. Emperor Sujin revived sea transport to curtail the people's transportation costs and to gain additional state revenues. 

110 Well over one hundred Imperial Majesties have been lain to rest since then, and never in all that time have foreign barbarians ravaged our transport system. [But what have we today?] We shrink from the water's edge in fear of the Western barbarians; even the great lords cannot put to sea. [In our own domain, for example,] certain officials seek to abolish seaborne transport altogether, and instead, dig a canal to ship goods to Edo. This proposal is all too attractive to those looking for easy answers. Such is the level to which our native courage has sunk. The ancients had a saying, "When we retreat one step, they advance one step." There are many island steppingstones between us and them: Iki, Tsushima, Tanegashima, Yakushima, and Hachijōjima, to name but a few. How can we sit back and watch the barbarians ravenously annex and convert these into military strongholds, while we diffidently mutter, "warfare on the water just isn't our long suit?" 

232 

National Defense 

Some say, "The key to ship handling lies in the captain's skill; nothing precludes a small ship from attaining naval victories." This reasoning is not fallacious. But it presumes that all our officers are masters of navigation. If not, our small flimsy ships will not always defeat their large sturdy ones. Moreover, skills vary from person to person; who can say for a fact that throughout the ages skilled navigators have never been found among captains of large ships? Indeed, history shows that most battles in which small boats defeated large ones took place in harbors or inlets. To stage such an encounter on the open sea would be like so many goldfish attacking a whale-one swish of its tail would end it all.... The outcome of sea battles is not a matter of courage and skill, but of ship size and construction, so we cannot ignore the advantages offered by large ships. Most of the battles that we lost [against the Mongols] in the Kōan era [1278-87] and [against the Koreans and Chinese] in the Bunroku era [1592-95] were lost not on land, but at sea. And we did not lose because we lacked courage: Our small boats proved no match for the enemy's large warships. 

111 

(Gloss: Tu Chung-lü of the Ming wrote, "Land warfare is Japan's strong point. Her weakness on the water stems from the inferior size of her ships and their lack of firepower." Yü Ta-yu111 wrote that his countrymen's most urgent task was to repel us with their navy, that they should devote their utmost efforts to outfitting large ships. Ch'i Chi-kuang as well said, "Our huge sailing ships are like floating castles; Japanese ships are small and flimsy. With a strong wind in our sails, we smash them as the wheels of a cart crush insects on the road. Battles are fought between ships, not men. If Japanese ships were as large and powerful as ours, we would be in a fix." All these statements show that the key to victory at sea lies in ship size and construction.) 

Therefore, attacking large warships in small boats is a stratagem we can resort to only when a particular captain's special skill and daring make victory probable. We cannot rely on it as a basic principle in maritime defense. 

Small arms were first cast by the Western barbarians, but we 

233New Theses 

in the Middle Kingdom imported and refined these weapons so much that the Ming Chinese named them "Japanese guns," not “barbarian guns." This shows their respect for our ingenuity. Let us repeat this tour de force in shipbuilding. There is no reason to be outdone by anyone. 

(Gloss: The Russian khan, Peter, 112 once travelled to Holland disguised as a carpenter to learn the art of building large ships. This took place in the Genroku era [1688-1703], and there is little doubt that Russia began to possess huge warships and sophisticated navigating skills at that time. Even the barbarians heed this vital matter; how can we in the Middle Kingdom ignore it?) 

Thus I say, "We must strengthen our arsenal with large ships to instill confidence in our own troops and fearful awe toward us in the barbarians. Only then will we put an end to their contemptuous and wayward behavior. 

The creation of a coast guard is one of our top priorities. Training in navigation and the construction of large ships are the requisites of a maritime nation. 113 We must deliberate on these matters thoroughly while we still have time. 

(4) Manufacturing Firearms. Firearms too are the barbarians' forte, and we cannot hope to control them with these weapons [alone]. But since cannon are effective in blowing apart solid structures, they are indispensable when attacking or defending castles. Furthermore, because sea battles today are encounters between floating castles, the cannon employed must be wellbuilt. Though high-grade cannon are basically long-range weapons, capable of shooting vast distances and hitting even the smallest targets with precision, they also can be effective at close range-if we properly employ them. After all, how many men can one cannon shell actually kill? Rather, it is the thundering shock effect that takes a toll. If the enemy alone skillfully employs these weapons, our men will be gripped with terror before the battle even begins. How could we expect them to fight? Ever since our Middle Kingdom first acquired guns, we have been casting and using mainly small arms. Warfare in our land ended soon after cannon were introduced, and the techniques 

234 

National Defense 

of casting and firing these weapons became jealously guarded secrets of a few hereditary gunsmiths, who were loath to impart their skills to others. As a result, the number of qualified cannoncasters now falls far below the realm's needs. Unless all domains cast large cannon and all troops in the realm learn to employ these, our fighting spirit cannot be sparked, and these marvelous weapons cannot serve in the nation's defense. We must simplify methods of casting, mounting, and firing so that they are perfectly clear to everyone: We cannot put any trust in the family secrets and mystical nonsense now shrouding these procedures. 

The barbarian ships closing in on us are floating fortresses; the protection of their hulls permits them to attack. To repel them, we must build and utilize a variety of firearms-offensive guns to demolish enemy ships far offshore, defensive guns to pin them down in our bays and inlets, and small arms for use on our patrol boats. In addition, we need flaming arrows, rockets, and other projectile weapons. Our rank-and-file must be fully trained to handle such auxilliary firearms in addition to their own handguns. Then the Man of Talent and Virtue would have to make the most of this army when he deemed proper. 

There are many arguments about using shields in addition to body armor, bows and arrows to supplement firearms, and iron and stone to replace lead and copper in casting weapons. Although some fighting men in the Warring States period [14671568] mocked death by doing battle without shields, many warriors did avail themselves of shielding devices in that era. 

(Gloss: In assaulting castles, large, tall bamboo shields were set up in front of the besieging troops to protect them against enemy missiles. On his campaigns in Korea, Katō Kiyomasa employed armored carts, much like those used in ancient China, called "tortoise shells." Any number of similar historical examples could be cited. 

Of course, a cannon shell can pierce any shielding device. But even so, this shield absorbs most of the shell's force, so the body armor that each soldier wears will usually protect him from being wounded. And this sense of security allows the men to maintain their courage under a shower of enemy 

235 

New Theses 

projectiles. For example, when Katō Kiyomasa attacked Konishi Yukinaga's stronghold at Udo in Higo Province, his officers and men were without shields and therefore had to improvise by using sliding doors removed from the houses of local residents. Yet even these makeshift devices allowed them to press their attack free from the fear of being struck by enemy projectiles. How much greater their composure would have been had they possessed genuine shields. 

Moreover, the shells that the barbarians now use contain pellet-like shot and splatter on impact, so their total explosive power is slightly less than conventional shells. Therefore, the two-fold protection afforded by shield and body armor should be adequate, but we should conduct tests to make sure. In any case, the important thing about shielding devices is not whether they can withstand the impact of enemy shells. Instead, shields are valuable because they keep our men from looking at the enemy's muzzles. The wise commander understands this.) 

Troops today are weak and used to soft living. Should they find themselves facing enemy fire without shielding, they would be panic-stricken. Hence, we must give them shields and armor to make them stouthearted and fearless. Serious studies as to types and methods is called for now, while we still have time. 

The barbarians appropriate lead, copper, iron, sulfur, and other precious metals from their far-flung overseas possessions (kaigai shokoku), so they never suffer from a shortage of these metals. We, however, must rely solely on deposits of these metals found in our homeland, so we are at a clear [material] disadvantage when defending ourselves against foreigners. 

(Gloss: At one time the Ming enlisted and garrisoned troops in frontier areas to ward off their enemies. Wang Ju-shun then wrote, "Our biggest headaches are our chronic shortage of gunpowder and trying to find armor and weapons for an everincreasing number of troops." In other words, the Ming were plagued by shortages of gunpower, which is easily produced. How much greater are our problems with copper, iron, lead, 

236 

National Defense 

and other metals, which can be produced only in limited quantities.) 

Thus, we should not depend solely on firearms, but must supplement them with bows and arrows. In making firearms, we should not rely solely on copper and lead, but must use iron or wood to make the barrels, and iron or stone, or various other materials, to make shells. We must always be prepared to improvise with any odds and ends at our disposal. We should stockpile string, worn-out netting, wood-shavings, lumber scraps, sand, discarded pieces of metal, and the like. We must teach our men how to produce munitions from these odds and ends in peacetime so that we will not be found wanting in wartime. The volume of munitions we produce is small, but our habitual economizing will enable us to go all out when necessary. To attain victory at the precise moment requires grand stratagems from the mind of a master tactician. However, such matters should be discussed privately with those conversant in the art of war, not committed to writing in abstract, theoretical terms. 

(Gloss: According to Ch'i Chi-kuang's "Methods of Warfare on the Water," bows, arrows, slings, and other projectile weapons should be employed along with firearms. Regarding "firearms," he says that "the amount of gunpowder placed onboard any one ship should be five hundred pounds, while the lead-encased cannon shells placed onboard should be no more than three hundred pounds." From this we can see that gunpowder was not used solely in firing cannon shells. Furthermore, since not only cannon shells, but flaming arrows and similar projectiles were also used, the term "firearms" did not refer only to cannon and cannon shells.) 

The casting of cannon, the use of shielding devices, the techniques of bowmanship, the production of munitions from castoff paraphernalia-all are methods of putting firearms to work in the nation's defense. We must deliberate on these matters thoroughly while we still have time. 

(5) Stockpiling Materiel and Provisions. The munitions stored in castletown armories may be adequate for present purposes, 

237 

New Theses 

but fall short of massive wartime needs. Supplies and foodstuffs procured from city merchants may suffice for drilling and training in peacetime, but cannot meet sudden emergencies. Therefore, each domain should be ordered to increase the production of its local products such as nitrates, sulfur, tallow, glue, leather, hemp, and so on: Dependence on other domains cannot be allowed. Weapons and armor must be forged in volume and stockpiled now, while we still have time. Then, when war begins, we will have limitless supplies. 

We must conserve the produce of our mines-gold, silver, lead, copper, iron, and precious stones-to the utmost. Squandering these irreplaceable resources is intolerable. The profligate use of gold and silver by Buddhist temples, the gilding of toys and ornaments, the use of precious metals by commoners, the making of women's jewelry and gold-laced kimonos-all squander valuable resources. We must act now to prohibit further melting down and recasting of gold and silver. 

(Gloss: According to Chinese (Saido) works of history, dynastic rulers supplied gold and silver articles from their own households to be recast into armaments. They also prohibited the production of gilt and gold lace. We can surmise, then, that the ancients valued gold and silver mainly for military use, not for ornamentation.... 

The Sung outlawed gold plating, the use of gold and silver on. clothing, and the gilding of utensils. They also prohibited the use of gold on buildings, toys, and household furnishings. Women not belonging to the royal family could not wear gold hair ornaments. The emperor himself melted down his gold and silver personal effects for government use. Buddhist temples wishing to decorate statues or buildings with gold plate or gold foil could not do this themselves. Instead, they had to take unprocessed gold to one of the provincial government-run foundries which did the desired work for a fee. In addition, the government prohibited clerics from collecting donations of precious metals and gems for use in casting or decorating statues. At court, strict laws regulated the use of 

238 

National Defense 

gold by non-members of the royal family. And of course, commoners were absolutely forbidden to use gold. 

These and other carefully detailed injunctions appear repeatedly throughout history. From them we see how important it is to conserve the riches that Heaven provides for us.) 

Frequent recoinages cause the lamentable destruction of precious metals through melting down and reminting. Foreign trade is largely a frittering away of our precious metals for useless commodities and must be banned. In town and village, people nowadays squander untold amounts of wealth on luxury items. We must stop all this! 

(Gloss: High and low alike adore luxury items, and townsmen continually seek out new conveniences. People once were content with houses or tools made of wood and bamboo; now they demand iron and bronze. Grindstones and flints are indispensable to a military state. Our finely wrought, delicate tools-gimlets, chisels, knives, handsaws-wear away in no time. Our supply of pure iron-ore and high quality grindstones is just about depleted. People are so used to luxury that they reject simple lacquerware for fine china. We waste precious flints in great quantities to fire blast furnaces used in producing the useless items of glass that abound everywhere. Our list of squandered resources is endless. We must find ways to conserve these natural riches and eliminate waste before our irreplaceable treasures are completely gone.) 

If we stopped producing and consuming things devoid of practical value, our mines and quarries would not be drained of their deposits so readily; our resources of divine spirit, also, would not be exhausted. 

Not only do our people's lives depend on rice, it is vital as a source of rations for our troops. The surplus rice now amassed in urban areas may fatten decadent city dwellers, but these valuable rations cannot be distributed to fighting units. If we really want to store rations for our men, we must return to our original calling [agriculture], cultivate rice diligently, and treasure 

239 

New Theses 

it. Both the people and domain governments must store this precious grain throughout the countryside. 

(Gloss: See "What is Essential to a Nation.") 

Then decadent city dwellers gradually will have to return to the villages they once deserted. Then the processing of food products wasteful of rice-such as sake, mochi, rice confections, and noodles-will be reduced. Also, the cultivation of cash crops that lower agricultural production-such as tea, tobacco, and dyer's saffron-will come under some control. 

With proper study and adaptation, many ancient institutionsthe ever-normal granary system and the Leveler's Office [of Nara times] to name but two-could be revived to meet today's needs. If we restored agriculture to its proper place of primacy in society, if we kept the price of rice fixed all year round every year, if we prevented avaricious merchant princes from garnering exhorbitant profits and trampling underfoot small proprietors, and if we taught high and low alike to curb their acquisitiveness, then everyone from the daimyo on down would store rice voluntarily in their homes and could make ends meet. When warriors and peasants are on sound financial footing, benefits will accrue to merchants as well. 

An orderly system to regulate rice transactions would be a boon to high and low alike, and would help curb acquisitiveness throughout the realm. Rice should be the primary medium of trade between domains and should serve as legal tender for transactions between firms or individuals; coinage or silk products would supplement it only when necessary. Then rice would circulate freely among the people all over the realm instead of piling up in city storehouses. If a system of relief granaries, whether governmentor privately-run, were set up in the countryside, even the most destitute would be free from hunger in lean years. Granary rice dispensed in times of need would be replenished, and old rice [remaining at summer's end] would be replaced by newly harvested grain [each fall]. Ancient institutions such as these all possess certain merits that we should select and utilize in our famine-relief or defense programs. Then the good bounties of earth and nature would circulate freely 

240 

National Defense 

and abundantly throughout the realm, and our vital life force (yuan ch'i) would not weaken. 

(Gloss: Techniques for managing finances or a relief granary system are far from simple: When we implement them, we must realize that for every benefit we obtain, a disadvantage arises. Hence we must implement measures as each situation dictates, rather than adhere strictly to some set program. For this reason, I confine myself here to one aspect [of a much vaster problem]. On another occasion, I will state my views in more detail.) 

We must end wastefulness in consuming rice, using the produce of our mines, and fashioning products from earth and sea. We must eliminate harmful practices and establish beneficial programs. We must ponder deeply, plan with broad vision, and tighten or relax our institutions after carefully discerning the needs of the day. None of these things can be accomplished until the Man of Talent and Virtue has been found. All my proposals are ways to stockpile materiel and provisions. We must deliberate on them thoroughly while we still have time. 

I have thus outlined five specific programs to implement: coastal garrisons, communications networks, a coast guard, manufacturing firearms, and stockpiling materiel and provisions. I have written in general terms because I believe that after we outline guidelines and programs, we can work out details ac cordingly. We must reestablish institutions that existed in antiquity but are gone today, and revive the discipline that was upheld strictly in antiquity but is lax today. We must implement and rigorously enforce laws that should be but have not yet been drafted. 

In this section, I have presented a basic outline of my views on national defense. But whenever knowledgeable men ponder the consequences of their proposals, they must bear in mind that harmful and beneficial results always come together; they must recognize the sources of both harm and benefit. Therefore, I conclude this section with a few words on the evils [encountered in political reform]. 

Anything of benefit to the realm must also be of harm. The Book of Changes [as interpreted by Chu Hsi] states, "Profit 

241 

New Theses 

must accord with virtue." Unless we deem virtue itself to be profit, any benefits obtained will be specious. If we revive the samurai spirit without differentiating virtue from profit, we will be unable to tell the sincere from the wicked, we will have no just criteria to base rewards and punishments on; the realm will plunge into turmoil, and we will be unable to elevate the people's manners and morals. Efforts to eliminate luxurious habits and consumption denied to one's status will lead to indolence and furtive, large-scale graft; meanwhile, diligence and frugality will be impossible to instill. Measures designed to stabilize the people's livelihood will lead to distrust and estrangement between high and low: Commoners might feign compliance and industriousness, but their hearts would not be in it. Promoting men of ability will lead to favoritism and partisanship in government. Eliminating insolent, overbearing troops from the ranks will earn us the enmity of officers and men. Increased troop strength will tempt us into foolhardy belligerence. Improved methods of military training and the conduct of field maneuvers would amount to nothing more than cadenced flamboyance. Enriching the domains will tempt them to be insolent. Deploying defense troops throughout the land will precipitate warlord insurrections. Establishing garrisons will turn marauders loose in the countryside to pillage and to deprave folkways and morals. Setting up an intricate system of observation posts and way-stations will heap immense, unbearable burdens on the people. Building large ships and transporting goods in them will make smuggling all the more easy for nefarious commoners. Casting weapons and training troops in bowmanship and gunnery will open up avenues of advancement to phony tacticians and show-offs. Exploiting and stockpiling nature's treasures will breed embezzlers and swindlers. Retrenchment and austerity will cause the loss of many people's livelihood. Restoring agriculture to its proper place of primacy in society and stabilizing rice prices will usher in illegal marketing practices. In other words, none of our reforms would achieve hoped-for results. 

Confucius once said, "Superior men (chün tzu) keenly perceive virtue; petty men (hsiao jen), profit." If we permit petty men-who cannot tell virtue from profit-to wield princely 

242 

National Defense 

authority, programs designed to benefit the realm may well end up harming it. For that very reason, I argue that reviving the samurai spirit is the key to national defense and that we must lead the realm through virtue. To lead the realm through virtue, we must base ourselves on its interests as a public trust (kōgi). The bakufu has proclaimed a policy of armed expulsion throughout the land, thus appealing to our sense of shame; it has elucidated great virtue, and provided a focal point toward which all should direct their loyalty and energy. We must plunge into our work day and night with dedication; the intelligent must formulate stratagems, and the courageous must prepare for death. We must fire up our spirits, annihilate the impudent barbarians, and thereby demonstrate the greatness of our virtue to the entire world. 

But alas, our slothful, indolent ways are as deeply ingrained as ever. How many of us are truly prepared to risk death? By nature, man does not willingly forsake pleasure for pain: We all long to remain in our soft, familiar ways. Even though the Expulsion Edict has been promulgated, none of us has actually executed it; momentous, long-needed reforms for national defense remain unimplemented. No wonder the masses long for peace and remain skeptical about armed expulsion. We have yet to fix our hearts on a policy of war. No wonder warriors remain unresolved to die. 

Sun Tzu says, "In the face of death, men know not the meaning of fear."114 Hōjō Tokimune [realized this when he] beheaded the Mongol envoy: Like it nor not, our warriors found themselves staring death in the face. If we expelled the barbarians but once, even the realm's laggards would bestir themselves to confront the nation's peril. We would "make them climb to great heights," and "take away the ladder from behind [to make them forget their fear]."115 As Sun Tzu says, "Place men with their backs to the wall and they will die before fleeing to the rear."116 Can there be a better way to dispel fear from men's hearts? 

Whenever sovereigns in antiquity set out to accomplish a goal, they vigorously seized the initiative and boldly plunged into action. They disposed of routine business at Court in the 

243New Theses 

early hours of dawn. During the remainder of the day they debated vital matters of state, reviewed and exhorted their troops, or held audiences with ministers to relate opinions to them. The rulers of old made plain everything in their hearts: They clearly revealed their aims and aspirations to their people and shared joys and sorrows with them. Intelligent and courageous men throughout the realm then responded resolutely by offering their talents to the state in a spirit of sincere and loyal devotion; they vowed never to co-exist with the barbarians. Sovereigns in antiquity, then, succeeded in attracting intelligent and courageous men to government service. When such is the case, the central government needs but issue a decree and it is executed all over the land. Only when the spirit of righteousness permeates the realm can our spirits thus be sparked. 

244 

## 8 A Long-Range Policy 

Before the Great Hero undertakes any important enterprise in the realm, he makes a panoramic survey of contemporary conditions, considers the broad vista thus obtained against the vast sweep of historical change, and establishes an immutable, longrange policy. Once this policy is implemented within, it will accommodate infinite changes from without. For this reason, the Great Hero is unperturbed by changes of fortune and unabashed when plans go awry. He may meet with innumerable setbacks, but is certain to achieve ultimate success because his objective is fixed. Although he pursues it through diverse methods, his efforts are constant and sustained. 

It was this [timeless, immutable policy,] the Way, that enabled Amaterasu and Sage Emperors [in antiquity] to expel barbarians and extend our frontiers. Thus, our Middle Kingdom has always possessed a definite stratagem to bring barbarian tribes under control. Our rulers achieved great enterprises through indomitability of spirit by which they extended the Imperial sphere of moral influence (kōkwa). In ages past, barbarian tribes [surrounding our Middle Kingdom] were at times strong, and at times weak, at times rebellious, and at times submissive; but in the end, all were encompassed within it. The barbarians could not oppose our long-range policy because they could not achieve enterprises or pursue far-sighted goals through sustained planning. 

The successful ruler possesses a boundless spirit and always begins an enterprise by surveying conditions in the realm. He meticulously ascertains topographic and climatic conditions in his land and the spiritual make-up of his people with a view to devising effective military and political stratagems. Only then 

245 

New Theses 

does he implement his measures, slowly and methodically, so that he controls all affairs of the realm in the palm of his hand. For example, when Emperor Jimmu pacified our Middle Kingdom, he thoroughly surveyed lands to the east to determine their worthiness of Imperial rule before setting off to conquer them. He first formulated clear plans for conquest, and then executed them. As a result, his forces were victorious everywhere. Emperor Sujin aspired to enhance the nation's power and prestige and to make these felt abroad. 

(Gloss: During his dream, a divine messenger appeared and said, "Nations across the sea should also submit to our sphere of moral suasion (kikwa)." This dream was no chance occurrence.) Even before the capital region was fully pacified, His Majesty drew up plans to administer the realm. He divided the land into four administrative circuits and [placed warrior-gods] in charge of these, a measure he no doubt decided on after carefully assessing prevailing conditions. His future administrative system was thus mapped out [before he went on to pacify the land]. No sooner did Sujin subdue barbarian tribes close at hand than those far away submitted to him. Thus dynastic fortunes revived magnificently. 

The Emperors succeeding Sujin followed his example, eradicating the customs of savagery and enlarging the nation's territory so that foreign peoples [on the Korean peninsula] submitted in good order. During Empress Genshō's reign [715-24], we dispatched an expedition to the continent to survey the terrain and climate. This shows that we still aspired to conquer foreign 

territories. 

(Gloss: During the Yōrō era [717-23], we dispatched Morogimi no Kurao, the provincial governor of Watarishima and Tsugaru.) 

Amaterasu and Sage Emperors [in antiquity] keenly perceived the situation confronting them and administered the realm through policies so profound and sublime that their divine resplendence endures to this day. When we look back on these 

A Long-Range Policy 

Sage Emperors [in antiquity], we see how broad and vast their 

spirit was. 

(Gloss: When the Sage King Yao of the T'ang [in high antiquity] set up his regime, he dispatched Hsi and Ho to live at the remotest ends of the realm. He ordered them to observe the movements of the Heavens and to teach the people when to sow and reap based on the knowledge they thus gained. After first exhaustively studying the warp and woof of the universe in all its vastness, Yao, Shun, and their retainers slowly and methodically went on to achieve great tasks. They would have failed utterly had they not first discerned the nature of the situation confronting them. 

At the beginning of the "The Heavenly Officers" section of the Rites of Chou, it says, "They establish order over the state, over political organs, and over people by means of the Six Classics." This means that the Heavenly Officers exercised comprehensive control over all government processes. At the beginning of "The Earthly Officers," it says, "They manage geographic and demographic affairs," which means that they performed the basic functions necessary to political administration. When the Duke of Chou established his capital at Lo-i, he made sacrifices to Heaven before doing anything else, because to honor Heaven-which presides over the people-is the most important requirement of government. When Liu Pang, who became the first Han emperor, occupied Ch'in, he first seized all maps and domicile registers. With the aid of these, he became thoroughly familiar with the terrain and where the people lived, and as a result, he greatly offset the power of his rival, Hsiang Chi. Thus, one must be quick to size up the situation and determine one's course of action.) 

For many and varied reasons, however, foreign peoples in later ages ceased bearing tribute to our Middle Kingdom. The Court lacked men of vision and planning, our territory contracted day after day, and Emperors lost the will to govern. The Western barbarians have grown tremendously powerful in recent 

247 

New Theses 

way 

times, and what is more, they too have learned how to discern prevailing situations confronting them and to ply stratagems of their own. Thus, they have been annexing territories at will for over three hundred years, slowly and steadily making their toward our Divine Realm. They have appropriated the very stratagem that Amaterasu and our Sage Emperors [in antiquity] once used to subjugate barbarians; now they seek to turn it against our Middle Kingdom. Yet we in the Middle Kingdom have yet to establish a coherent policy to deal with them. Councils are divided both in and out of government. We waver indecisively, or at best, adopt gloss-it-over, stop-gap measures. We even allow these foreign beasts to come ashore and run amok! Ours is the Land of the Illustrious Gods-have we no sense of 

shame? 

The ruler of men is both prince and edifier to the multitudes. He who rules over others has a broad spirit that encompasses the four seas; he tends to affairs in the realm in a poised, selfassured manner, and accomplishes every task. By contrast, he who is ruled over by others is capable of perceiving only shortrun advantages; he acts without thinking and lacks the capacity to manage affairs in the realm. 

Since we have yet to observe conditions in foreign lands, it comes as no surprise that the wily barbarians take advantage of us and deride us for our shortsightedness. To determine our basic [foreign] policy, we first must assess conditions in the realm and then compare strengths and weaknesses. I have already presented a brief account of conditions at home and abroad. Thus informed of the situation confronting us, we now must make our islands into a castle and think of the ocean as a moat. We must adopt defense measures dictated by conditions in the realm as a whole. Yet before comparing specific strengths and weaknesses with the barbarians, we must determine just whose forces enjoy preponderance [in this theater]. Then we must devise ways to gain the freedom of initiative to control them. 

Our forces should enjoy overall preponderance, since we await them in our homeland, and they must travel thousands of miles to spy on us. But in truth, they have turned the tables on us. They have a superb stratagem at their disposal and rule their 

248 

A Long-Range Policy 

territories in a poised, self-assured manner. Through fishing and trade, they procure food and supplies without having to maintain supply lines far from home: They are truly masters at the art of "securing provisions in the enemy's homeland."117 They "transport men and materiel effortlessly and without loss or damage"118 in their huge ships. They remain motionless at sea, but we scurry from place to place on shore, exhausting ourselves in an attempt to cover all possible weak spots: They are truly adept at "subduing the enemy without resorting to battle."119 They lure our commoners over to their side through their barbarous religion, for they have learned well the lesson, "to take over the enemy's homeland and people intact is the best strategy of all."120 

Sun Tzu says, "Only when enjoying a ten to one advantage in men does one lay siege to fortresses."121 The enemy must cross vast oceans to reach us, and even if they assembled all their forces to make a sudden assault, they lack sufficient numbers to surround us [and lay siege]. But in effect, they do enjoy a ten to one edge over us because we must "spread our forces thin" to defend ourselves on all four sides, and theirs are "concentrated" 122 in a single fighting force. Moreover, [because they control the seas,] "they are free to maneuver and choose the best time and place to do battle."123 They need only dispatch one or two ships to incite an uprising by commoners on shore, so it takes little insight to see just who is strong and who is weak. 

To turn our weakness into strength, we must outwit the enemy and throw him off balance. To do this, we must put him on the defensive; there is no defense apart from offense. As the ancients put it, "To attack is the key to defense." If we take the offensive, the enemy will have to assume a defensive posture, and freedom of initiative will revert to us. We must shore up our defenses and seize the opportune moment to cut off barbarian forces on the open sea. Though they seek to incite rebellion in outlying areas, they possess only a few ships and men. Therefore they would lose effective strength by dividing up the small squadrons they dispatch. If we prevented them from inciting our commoners here, there, and everywhere along our coastline, the troops we deploy, though few in number, would suffice. 

249 

New Theses 

past. 

Furthermore, as long as their ships remain huddled together for defensive purposes, the barbarians cannot secure needed provisions through fishing and trade as they normally do. As a result, they will have to leave our coastal waters as soon as their supplies run out. They will not be able to employ their stratagems against us, and their insolence will be a thing of the Moreover, since we await the enemy in our homeland (naichi), we are in [what Sun Tzu terms] "defection-prone territory," whereas the enemy, who has yet to penetrate our territory ,,124 As Sun Tzu says, deeply, is in "falter-prone territory. "When in defection-prone territory, one must unify the [the people's] wills."125 If we determine our basic [foreign] policy now, lead the people along the proper path, and thus unify them spiritually, defeating the barbarians should not be difficult, since they are still in falter-prone territory. What keeps us from devising stratagems to slaughter them? 

128 

By taking the offensive, I do not necessarily mean killing enemy troops, vanquishing enemy armies, and capturing enemy strongholds. Rather, what we must do is "fortify ourselves so that we are invincible and devise measures to defeat the enemy."126 We first must rejuvenate ourselves spiritually and study conditions [at home and abroad]. Externally, we must "counteract the enemy's stratagems in advance."127 Then we must "disrupt his alliances, and devise tactics to stop him cold. Internally, we must shore up our defenses and increase troop strength to bring the enemy under control. Our government and edification must be so perfect that we can transform barbarian ways to those of civilization. Then, if they attempt to spy in our coastal waters, we could exterminate them; and if they choose to submit, we could spread the blessings of Imperial Virtue far and wide, to the remotest regions of the world. 

We should annex the Ezo Islands and absorb the barbarian tribes on the continent; we should roll back the tide of barbarism and extend our frontiers ever forward. This is what I mean by "measures to defeat the enemy." In this way we could attack and capture the hearts and minds of the foe before the battle begins. Then we need but assault their strongholds, strike their weak points, and take advantage of every opportunity to wreak 

250 

A Long-Range Policy 

Heavenly Devastation on them. This is the way to ensure vicdefensive, and our forces will have reclaimed the overall pretory. In short, we then will have put the barbarians on the ponderance that theirs now enjoy. This is what I meant earlier by "outwitting the enemy, throwing him off balance, and making him take the defensive." We will have turned their strength into weakness and our weakness into strength. Thus we will have revived the stratagem so adroitly employed [in antiquity] by Amaterasu and Sage Emperors to control the barbarians, and which they have recently turned against us. Can there be a better method of counteracting the stratagem that they now use to subvert us? Thus we will have recovered the freedom of initiative to control them. 

Now that the bakufu has proclaimed armed expulsion, high and low alike are spiritually united, and all our efforts are directed toward one objective. This indeed was the Way for controlling barbarism that Amaterasu and Sage Emperors employed: a resolute strategy decided on within, and impenetrable safeguards against encroachment from abroad. Then no matter how often the barbarians might come spying, they could not wreak havoc on shore. 

(Gloss: Tokugawa Ieyasu once sent an interpreter named Shimano Kenryo to India. Shimano set off in a Dutch vessel, and after visiting many lands, finally arrived in a huge country three thousand miles to the east. Firmly believing that this territory should belong to our Divine Realm, he erected a small sign saying, "Part of Japan (Nihonkoku)." This shows the breadth of vision men had in those days. This land "three thousand miles to the east," I believe, was the territory that the Western barbarians now call "America.") 

Simply bringing the barbarians under control with a definite stratagem should be enough to achieve spiritual unity among the masses. But there are two methods to strengthen further the bonds binding our people together: performing short-term feats of greatness through inspired effort, and implementing gradualistic programs whose successful culmination must be left to future generations. The former method is impossible without 

251 

New Theses 

timing, resourcefulness, and the presence of an able statesmangeneral. The latter method is impossible without long-range vision and unless we resolutely achieve the enterprise [delegated to us by Amaterasu] by extending the sphere of Imperial moral suasion (kōkwa). The former method calls for rewards and punishments periodically applied to inspire the people; the latter, for prescribed rituals and edification eternally upheld to disci pline them. [Mencius says,] "The people fear good government and love good teachings." This means that they occasionally hold authority in fearful awe, but always yearn for timeless moral precepts. Thus, [Mencius says,] "good teachings capture the people's hearts." 

In maintaining the realm for all eternity, [a sage] first takes into account any and all problems that might arise and prescribes broad guiding precepts to deal with them. He clarifies the decrees of Heaven, the nature of men's hearts, the laws inherent in things, and the ethical principles by which men live. Then he lays down teachings and injunctions to disseminate in good order: Immutable precepts originate from [the sage's] mind. In antiquity Amaterasu "established teachings in accordance with the 'spirit-like processes of nature"" (shen tao), thus elucidating loyalty and filial devotion and prescribing the rules of conduct by which men live. It is through these teachings that the realm can be maintained for eternity. 129 That the present dynasty was founded in antiquity, that it has been maintained for countless generations, and that therefore its sphere of moral suasion (kōkwa) should extend far and wide-all this accords with the august motive that inspired Amaterasu to "establish her precepts" for posterity. 

Whenever Emperor Jimmu, the founder of our Imperial Line, waged war, he looked to divine powers for help in performing great heroic feats. 

(Gloss: While pacifying the Middle Kingdom, Emperor Jimmu prayed to the deities, obtained divine assistance, and marched with the Sun [Goddess] at his back. Guided by the Yata Crow and armed with the Futsunomitama Sword, He displayed obedience to the instructions of Amaterasu and Takemikazuchi. 

252 

A Long-Range Policy 

By worshipping the Heavenly and Earthly Deities at the upper reaches of the Nyu River and by ordering His sub-lieutenant, Michinoomi, to worship the god Takamimusubi, His Majesty displayed reliance on divine assistance.) 

After pacifying the Middle Kingdom, He established a site to worship godly spirits at Tomi, where He paid reverence to Amaterasu and to His Heavenly Ancestors. Thus, he was a living exemplar of filial devotion. 

(Gloss: Emperor Jimmu attained victory over Nagasunehiko only after the auspicious appearance of the Golden Kite (tobi). For this reason, he named this area "Tobinomura," or [after a euphonic change,] "Tomi." This is probably why His Majesty worshipped the godly spirits there.)

When Emperor Sujin acceded to the Throne, local chieftains rebelled. In those days, the Court still followed the ancient custom of worshipping [the Sacred Mirror, the embodiment of] Amaterasu, [privately] within the Imperial Palace. Emperor Sujin, however, was awe-struck and ill at ease. Therefore he transferred this Imperial Treasure to Kasanui, where he worshipped it publicly, and turned it into an object that everyone in the realm might revere with him. His Majesty intended to make reverence for Amaterasu a feeling shared by Court and people alike. [He sought] to show the people that their worship of Amaterasu constituted reverence for the Imperial Court. 

(Gloss: It is true that by worshipping Amaterasu [privately] within Court enclosures, [earlier Emperors] had offered the full measure of their sincere devotion to Her. But the meaning in Their Majesties' ritual acts was lost on the realm's people. By worshipping Amaterasu [publicly,] outside Court enclosures, Emperor Sujin displayed sincere devotion together with the whole realm. Thus, the realm's people grasped the significance of His Majesty's act [directly and sensually,] not through explanations or exhortations. Since His Majesty's sincere devotion alone touches the gods' hearts, how much greater is the effect when the entire realm joins in!) 

253New Theses 

The ancients [Mencius] said, "Filial devotion by the realm en masse is the ultimate in filial devotion." When the Duke of Chou was praised in antiquity for having attained "the ultimate in filial devotion," it was because everyone in the realm [joined him] in worshipping his ancestors, each person in accordance with his proper status. The Duke of Chou did not worship his parents within ritual-hall confines, but in public, together with his people. No doubt he had the same idea as Emperor Sujin.) 

[Emperor Sujin] also worshipped the local deities Ōmononushi and Yamato no Kunitama. Because the inhabitants of the capital region revered these two gods, His Majesty gave their rituals Imperial recognition and official standing. Thus, he captured the minds and allegiances of the people in the capital area, and they revered the Court thereafter. 

(Gloss: Local commoners worshipped Ōmononushi, a god who performed heroic deeds in pacifying the realm. Therefore, [Emperor Sujin] allowed their descendants to conduct religious rituals dedicated to Omononushi. These people were deeply moved that Emperor Sujin joined them in worshipping their clan god, and thereafter looked to the Imperial Court for fulfillment of their hopes and prayers. 

The meaning behind Emperor Sujin's worship of Omononushi is no doubt similar to that of the 'Great She' religious ritual in Chou times. According to the Book of Rites, "the shê instituted by the king for the people's benefit are 'Great Shê.' "She" are rituals in which people worship local deities and heroes who have performed meritorious services. Thus, for example, in Tso Chuan it says, "Kung Kung-shih had a son named Chu Lung who became the god Hou T'u. This Hou T'u is worshipped during the shê." 

Likewise, the god Yamato no Kunitama is probably "the deity who pacified Yamato Province." Since the nation's capital then was located in Yamato, this god probably was worshipped by many inhabitants there. This form of worship is very similar to that displayed by the Chinese people during 

254 

A Long-Range Policy 

their "Kingly Shê" in Chou times. The Book of Rites says, "Kingly She' are those established by the emperor himself." The land is the basis of the people's livelihood, and the local deities of the land are the objects of their worship. If the Emperor takes the lead in worshipping these local deities, He will gain the allegiance of and create spiritual unity among His people.) 

[Emperor Sujin] proceeded to worship provincial clan deities in area after area, establishing Heavenly and Earthly shrines to Heavenly and Earthly Deities throughout the realm. He captured the hearts of the people, and thereafter they revered the Court. 

(Gloss: In antiquity, the term "Heavenly Deities” designated Amaterasu and Her august offspring as well as the gods and heroes who served and aided the Emperors in Their Majesties' Imperial government. The term, "Earthly Deities," referred to old clans of long-standing who subdued outlying districts. These deities are worshipped at "Heavenly Shrines" and "Earthly Shrines" respectively. In the Ryō no gige it says, "Ise, Kamo [in Yamashiro], Sumiyoshi, and the deities worshiped by the Izumo Kuni no Miyatsuko are examples of "Heavenly Deities;" Ōmiwa, Oyamato, Kamo [in Katsuragi], and Ōnamuchi [of Izumo] are examples of "Earthly Deities." The shrines at which these gods are worshipped are "Heavenly Shrines" and "Earthly Shrines," respectively.) 

In addition, Emperor Sujin set up special rice fields for the deities and appointed villagers to tend these and secure stable supplies of rice for offerings at ritual time. Thus, the people were made aware of the homage paid by the Imperial Court to their local deities. The weapons of war were also employed during rituals to the gods. Through these rituals, the people were made aware of the divine sanctions attached to military commands, the realm's strategic areas were always well guarded, commoners were impressed with the inviolability of the Imperial Court, and they were induced to hold it in ever greater religious 

awe. 

255 

New Theses 

(Gloss: According to the "Suinin Chronicle" in Nihon shoki, "Bows, arrows, and swords were stored in shrines. The use of weapons in worshipping the gods during religious festivals began at this time." But actually even before this, during the reign of Emperor Sujin, halberds and shields were used to worship deities in festivals at Sumisaka and Ōsaka. I believe that because these two regions were of strategic importance to the realm, religious festivals also served as a means of storing weapons and tacitly conveying the need to shore up defenses to people in those key spots. This [use of religious rituals] continued as late as Emperor Suinin's reign [29 B.C. to 70 A.D.].) 

The people revered the Court, the rebellious were subdued as a matter of course, and the likes of Takehani Yasuhiko and Izumo Furune promptly received their just deserts. 131 The "spirit-like processes of nature" (shen tao) were elucidated, the Imperial Line was maintained, and an official list of recognized rituals and deities [as part of the Engi shiki] was distributed throughout the realm. Bona fide deities who had been overlooked were added to the list and granted official standing. 

(Gloss: According to the Engi shiki, the total number of shrines in the Court, capital region, and the seven administrative circuits are over 3,100. There are 492 Great Shrines, of which 304 received Imperial Cloth Offerings from the Office of Divinities and conducted the anjo kampei ceremony during the Toshigoi, Tsukinami, and Niiname Rituals. Of these 304, 71 participated in the Ainame Ritual. The remaining 188 Great Shrines received Imperial Cloth Offerings from the Office of Divinities. There were 2,640 Lesser Shrines, of which 433 received Imperial Cloth Offerings during the Toshigoi Ritual. The above-mentioned rituals-the Toshigoi, Tsukinami, Niiname, and Ainame-were accorded the highest official rankings, and these rankings applied to all shrines in the realm.) 

Gods who had performed feats of heroism on Imperial campaigns were appointed tutelary deities in the regions they had helped to conquer. 

256 

A Long-Range Policy 

(Gloss: Those gods and heroes who conquered and pacified particular regions during Imperial campaigns in antiquity were worshipped. Their descendants were placed in charge of religious rituals, and in this capacity, they continued to pacify the peoples in those areas. For example, Takemikazuchi, the god enshrined at Kashima Shrine, performed great heroic feats in pacifying the east.... Because of these gods' and heroes' great deeds of merit in antiquity, the inhabitants of these areas continued to worship them for countless generations. Likewise, Ōnamuchi pacified Izumo, and Prince Toyoki pacified Kōzuke and Shimotsuke. The descendants of these deities continue to watch over and conduct religious rituals at the various shrines dedicated to them in these regions. Numerous examples of this sort in all areas of the nation can be cited. By winning the devotion of the local inhabitants, we keep the provinces in peace, and instill an attitude of respectfulness in the people. 

When the Chou established their capital at Lo-i, they gave official standing to as yet unrecognized deities, and they deified any local inhabitants whose ancestors had performed meritorious deeds in antiquity. Thus, the actions of the Chou were prompted by motives similar to those of [Sujin and other] early Emperors in our history.) 

In these regions, they unified the people's hearts, drove off barbarian tribes, and transformed barbarous customs to civilized ways. Thus, our sphere of moral influence became more extensive with each passing day and the common people enjoyed harmony. The innumerable deities and myriad shrines near the capital and in the provinces watched over and protected their respective lands and peoples. The descendants of those peoples continue to revere and worship those deities even today, since the virtues of recompensing the blessings bestowed by Amaterasu and remaining true to ancestral will [outlined in "What is Essential to a Nation"] has been tacitly conveyed. 

Amaterasu and Sage Emperors [in antiquity] established broad guiding teachings and thus maintained the realm forever; Their Majesties prescribed rituals which were made manifest and 

257 

New Theses 

dutifully followed. When viewing the vestiges of these teachings and rituals today, we can judge for ourselves just how broad and vast Imperial solicitude once was. But various heresies sprang up in later ages and the Way became obscured. The Court lacked men of planning and vision, Dynastic decay set in, [the Imperial House] gradually lost its hold on the people's hearts, and Impegovernment breached Amaterasu's manifest will that Sage Emperors should rule the realm for ages eternal. 

99132 

In recent years, the wily barbarians have established ethical precepts of their own that sound very much like the genuine ones prescribed [by the sages] in antiquity; armed with their "Way of Wickedness," they eat into the peoples' hearts and minds. The barbarians' teachings are not "good teachings, but they pass these off as "teachings" just the same, and manage "to capture the people's hearts." In every country they go to, they raze the dwelling-places of native deities, trying to introduce their own god and win over the inhabitants' allegiance. 

The barbarians are triumphant everywhere and have begun to disseminate their poisonous doctrines in our Divine Realm. They have their hearts set on transforming us to barbarism by turning against us the very stratagem that Sage Emperors [in antiquity] employed to encompass them within our Middle Kingdom. Yet we in the Middle Kingdom remain without an unswerving moral basis of action; our people lack unity and spiritual cohesion, our leaders can dream up nothing better than stop-gap, gloss-it-over measures to tide them over each day's new crises. Our Land of Illustrious Gods has fallen to such depths that we now sit by idly and allow these foreign beasts to lure the common people away from us. Have we lost all sense of shame? 

Nothing is more awe-inspiring than Heaven. That is why the Sages venerably serve and fear it. They do not think of Heaven as inanimate matter [informed by Principle and discernible to human reason; but instead, view it as a living entity]. By venerably serving it, they evoke a sense of reverent awe and respectful submissiveness in commoners. Nothing is more possessed of spirituality than man. His soul is of an imperishable nature, unlike that of the grasses and trees, or the birds and beasts. He is 

258 

A Long-Range Policy 

conscious of his own life and death, particularly when faced with the prospect of dying. That is why the Sages elucidated the proper religious rituals. With the aid of these, they soothed man's doubts and fears and assured him of a place to rest his soul after death, so that his uncertainties about the hereafter would not lead him down evil paths. When commoners stand in reverent awe of Heaven and respectfully submit to its decrees, wicked doctrines will not beguile them on the threshold of death, and [fictive tales of] paradise in the afterworld will not 

mislead them. 

The responsibility for performing these rituals, that is, for recompensing Heaven, worshipping ancestors, praying for fortune, and eliminating calamities and evils, rests with rulers. Commoners need only do as their ruler tells them; by respecting their ruler as they would serve Heaven, they worship their ancestors. In addition, by binding their families together with warmth and affection, they cherish their ancestors as they do their parents. When the masses below are spiritually unified, outlandish doctrines hold no attraction for them. But when religious rituals fall into neglect, people are cut off from Heaven, and they become disdainful toward it. In death, they are reduced to insignificant floating spirits in a cosmic sea, futilely seeking some place of repose. In life, their hearts are unsettled, and they are fearful of the hereafter. 

This makes them susceptible to notions of paradise and hell. They crave happiness in the world to come and reject virtue in this life; they shirk their ruler's commands as they would avoid the incursions of enemy raiders; they embrace the foreigners' [religious] teachings as they long for a mother's compassion. They are attracted to pernicious doctrines from without because they need a basis of spiritual reliance within. It is only natural that the barbarians take advantage of this spiritual void and this fear of the hereafter. They beguile commoners into embracing barbarian notions of paradise or hell, fabulous places that no one has ever seen or visited. 

(Gloss: It is written, "Whenever pure vital force conglomerates, matter is formed; when it disperses, floating spirits are 

259 

New Theses 

released and transformed." Unless the proper religious rituals are duly performed to soothe the spirits of the dead on their way to Heaven, there can be no repose for the living or the dead, for the common people by nature cannot help feeling a vague sorrow [at the thought of dying]. Unless they possess an inner source of composure that puts their minds at ease when faced with death, they cannot help being deceived by tales of paradise and hell. It is to relieve their fears that we perform religious rituals to ancestors. 

Ancestors and offspring belong to the same original ch'i: The progenitor is the fountainhead and the offspring are temporal extensions. [This ch'i cannot be severed] so how can the spirit of a deceased ancestor, even though it be floating about the cosmos, be separated from his offspring? Through religious rituals the ancestral spirit in Heaven is soothed and comforted. [As explained in the Chung-yung,] "Heaven is a mass of luminous ch'i." Man exists between Heaven and Earth and is permeated by the vital force (ch'i) flowing therein, which imparts life to him. In other words, Heaven, Earth, and man are composed of the same ch'i. Man's primordial vital force (yuan ch'i), which sustains all life and order, is common to Heaven and Earth as well. When man conducts the proper religious rituals to Heaven and Earth, he can make contact with them, and [through this ritual medium,] they reveal their secrets. Therefore, when the sages served Heaven and revered ancestors, the people's sorrow [at the thought] of dying disappeared, and the realm readily submitted. 

In subsequent ages rulers lacked vision and planning, and they belittled the need to serve Heaven and revere ancestors. As a result, the people lost their object of reverent awe in life and their place of repose in death. Doubts and fears arose among them, and they began to yearn for a source of spiritual reliance. Then the Western barbarians struck further anxiety in the commoners' hearts by spreading doctrines of paradise and hell. This is [what Mencius meant when he said,] "Only when one demeans himself do others scorn him.") 

260 

A Long-Range Policy 

To achieve resolutely the great enterprises [delegated by Amaterasu], we first must prescribe broad guiding precepts and make perfectly clear the difference between justice and evil, Middle Kingdom Civilization and barbarism. I have already outlined the great essence of our nation as prescribed by the gods in antiquity. Since our broad guiding principles are established, we must extend these to all within the Four Seas, as if they formed one large family, and we must uphold these precepts for all eternity while making necessary modifications as changing times dictate. To clarify the difference between justice and evil, and between our Middle Kingdom Civilization and barbarism, we must elucidate the great Way of Heaven and make it the standard for our actions. 

Our Divine Realm stands at the vertext of the world, where the "ch'i of justice" and the "clear ch'i of dawn" prevail. 

(Gloss: Our Divine Realm is the land that the gods first created. The Chinese (Kanhito) call [our land] off to their east "The Area of the Sun." The Western barbarian also call our Divine Realm, the Ch'ing Empire, India, and Tungusland, "Asia" or "Morgenland." These names are based on [the earth's] natural configurations.) 

The "ch'i of justice" and "ch'i of dawn" are yang. Therefore, the Way of our Divine Realm is just and bright. By clarifying the Five Human Relationships, we serve Heaven; by honoring the gods, we exert our human powers to the limit; and by sustaining the myriad things, we embody "the life-nurturing virtue of Heaven and Earth" [as elucidated in the Book of Changes]. By contrast, the barbarians inhabit those parts of the world [that correspond to the] legs and feet [of the human anatomy], where the "ch'i of wickedness" and "the murky ch'i of dusk" prevail. The "ch'i of wickedness" and "the murky ch'i of dusk" are yin. Therefore, the barbarians seek out the dismal and practice the occult. They destroy the Way of man and preach doctrines of the hereafter. They desecrate Heaven and curry favor with the spirits. They amuse themselves by fabricating 

261 

New Theses 

absurd [Biblical] fables. They spell death and devastation for all creation, and they adhere to the Way of darkness and ill-omen. 

If we truly are to roll back this tide of devastation, we must supplant barbarian destruction with the power of Life. We must transform (kwa) their darkness into our light; we must refute their fanciful tales of life and death with the great, resplendent Way that encompasses the Will of Heaven and the hearts of men. If we illuminate the entire world with the sun's radiant splendor, how can the flickering flame of barbarism maintain its hold over men? Then we will have counteracted the prime stratagem that they use to annex peoples and nations. In short, we must transform them by appropriating the very Way that they now seek to use to transform us; this is the most pressing need behind setting up broad, guiding precepts. 

Barbarians are, after all, barbarians. It is only natural that they adhere to a barbarous Way, and normally we could let things go at that. But today they have their hearts set on transforming our Middle Kingdom Civilization to barbarism. They will not rest until they desecrate the gods and destroy the Way of Virtue, until they lure all peoples into their ranks and take over all lands in the world. Our Way of Virtue and their deceitful techniques are as incompatible as fire and ice. The universe is not vast enough to contain us both: "Unless their barbarous way is blotted out, the Way of Amaterasu and our Sage Emperors remains unelucidated."133 Until the Way of Amaterasu and our Sage Emperors is elucidated, their barbarous way remains to be blotted out. Either we transform them or they will transform us-we are on a collision course. How can a leader of planning and vision shirk his duty of counteracting [their] deceit with our justice? Only thus can he spare future generations from pestilence! 

Benevolence and universal love extend as far as the sun shines; men are men no matter what part of the earth they inhabit. But how can a benevolent ruler sit back and watch the barbarians propagate their occult religion, destroy the Way of Heaven, trample underfoot accepted rules of human conduct, and deceive and reduce commoners to the level of beasts and demons? Indeed, the benevolent ruler aspires to transform barbarism to 

262 

A Long-Range Policy 

our Middle Kingdom Civilization. Thus he would rescue the whole world from the ravages of savage cunning-just as Heaven radiates to all corners of the earth. The benevolent ruler must promote learning and military prowess at home and make these felt abroad if he is to display great virtue and resolutely achieve the tasks [delegated by Amaterasu]. 

(Gloss: Yü's great personal achievement in antiquity was to edify the entire realm. Yi Yin's claim to greatness was his deep sense of personal responsibility. If but one commoner in the realm was denied the blessings of sagely rule, Yi Yin felt as though he himself had pushed that poor man into a ditch. Similarly, though the flood was certainly none of Yao's doing, he interpreted it as Heaven's admonition to himselfsuch was the extent of his benevolence. When Emperor Wu of the Han took it on himself to avenge his great-great-grandfather's disastrous defeat by the Hsiung-nu, he did so not because he specifically had been charged with this task. Instead, he felt constrained by his great sense of duty. Such examples indicate the keen sense of personal accountability felt by rulers of old.) 

To realize this aspiration, we first must strive to clarify "our national essence" (kokutai). We must make the present conform to the past by adhering to the great methods [laid down by Amaterasu]. With broad mind and vision, we must reign supreme over Middle Kingdom Civilization and barbarian lands alike. By boosting troop strength we will be true to our name The Land of Proficient Halberds Aplenty, and by raising agricultural output we will be true to our name The Land of Ripening Rice Crests. To make the people trust us, we must elucidate loyalty and filial devotion and thereby elevate the realm morally. To amass supplies of food, to cultivate adequate troop strength, and to make the people trust us; to elucidate loyalty and filial devotion, and to reestablish the union of Heaven and man; to eliminate the doubts and fears that the masses now hold regarding death and the hereafter; to convert [barbarian] deceit into justice; and to transform barbarism to our Middle Kingdom Civilization-these are the enterprises delegated by Amaterasu 

263New Theses 

for Her Descendants to achieve resolutely. To accomplish these tasks, we must induce the people simply to submit [to Her Way without asking why]. How can this be done? I say, "Through [the mystical, suggestive power of] ritual, and through ritual alone." There are five categories of rituals, but religious rituals are the best means of teaching commoners respectfulness. 

(Gloss: In the Offices of Chou it is written, "When the people are taught respectfulness by means of religious rituals, they become deferential.") 

There are different categories of religious rituals, every ritual has a meaning of its own. We must clarify meanings before speaking of categories. By worshipping the deities of Heaven and Earth, the Emperor recompenses Heaven; by reverently worshipping Amaterasu, he honors his ancestors; by worshipping the deities of the Yamato Plain, he pacifies the earth; and by worshipping the god Ukemochi, he shows his concern for the people's livelihood. . . .134 There are detailed rituals for worshipping the gods of the wind, rain, grasses, trees, and all creation, 

(Gloss: These deities are Yamatsumi, Mizuwa, Watatsumi, Shinato, Haniyama, Kayano, Kukunochi, and so on. The reason so many famous mountains are places of worship to Izanagi, Ōnamuchi, and Ōyamatsumi is that these gods pacify the land. The sea god, Sumiyoshi, is worshipped in coastal areas in hopes of calm seas. The other gods whose names are listed [in the Engi shiki] all are worshipped by the people to obtain bountiful harvests and protection from natural disasters....) 

There are rituals for worshipping Imperial Princes, Imperial Offspring, illustrious retainers, and others who rendered service to 

the Court. 

(Gloss: For example, Prince Yamato Takeru, Prince Toyoki, Takemikazuchi, Futsunuchi, Ame no Koyane, and Sugawara no Michizane are worshipped at the Ōtori, Futawara, Kashima, 

264 

A Long-Range Policy 

Katori, Kasuga, and Kitano Shrines, respectively. The Chinese [Kando] customarily worship deities who performed services on the people's behalf. . ..) 

The ritual procedures are prescribed in our classics in detail. No worthy deity or person, no spirit of Heaven and Earth is overlooked during these rituals, and as a result, every corner of the land is pacified. The religious rituals performed by various lesser functionaries at Court serve to protect His Majesty and to assist Him in ordering the realm. 

(Gloss: These are the Mikan no Ko, who conduct rituals to the gods of antiquity; the Ikasuri, who conduct rituals to the spirits of the Imperial Palace Grounds and the deity of the Palace Well; and the Ikushima, who conduct rituals to the spirits of the various provinces and islands. In addition to the above Court functionaries, in the Department of the Imperial Household, rituals are performed at the Sono and Kara Shrines. In the Court kitchens, rituals are performed to the deities of foods and fire. In the Distiller's Agency, rituals are performed to the spirits of sake. And in the Waterworks Agency, rituals are performed to the god of thunder. Protection is afforded to the Imperial Line through all these rituals. In China [Kando], the Five Rituals serve this same purpose.) 

[The five categories of rituals can also be divided into three groups according to the length of purification involved-great, intermediate, and lesser.] There is but one great ritual, the Daijō, which is after the Emperor's Coronation. By acceding to the Throne, His Majesty recompenses Amaterasu's blessings and carries on Her Manifest Will [that Her Descendants reign over the land for ages eternal]. Therefore, this ritual deserves our highest veneration. 

There are [five] intermediate rituals; the Toshigoi, during which prayers are offered so that the year's religious rituals might be conducted in good order at all shrines throughout the land; the Tsukinami, during which the Court makes offerings to the Heavenly and Earthly shrines throughout the realm (much 

265 

New Theses 

as commoners make offerings to the protective deities watching over their homes); 

(Gloss: However, the Emperor thinks of all within the Four Seas as his household. Because His Majesty distributes offerings to the gods of the whole realm and to those of the islands within our seas, and because He prays that His blessings might extend far and wide, it is quite clear that His Majesty's prayers and rituals are not performed to benefit his own household alone.) the Niiname, the significance of which is similar to that of the Daijō; the Kammizo, during which offerings of Heavenly Garments are made in summer and autumn at the Ise Shrines; and the Kanname, which is performed on the same day as the autumn Kammizo ritual. 

Through the first three of these [five] intermediate rituals, the Emperor nourishes the people and brings security to the state; and by means of the last, the Kanname, His Majesty pays thanks to Amaterasu for Her original gifts of rice and silk to the people. In addition, there are numerous lesser rituals such as the Ōimi, Kaze no kami, Hanashizume, and Hishizume, to placate the gods of nature or to prevent crop failures, fires, natural disasters, and plagues. By performing these rituals, His Majesty prays for good fortune and eliminates calamities and suffering in the land. 

(Gloss: The Chou also performed a sort of Toshigoi ritual along with their Five Rituals... for much the same reasons as our Emperor performs the above rituals.) 

Each religious ritual possesses its own particular meaning; the Court performs each, and its ritual effects pervade the Four Quarters. The meaning of recompensing Amaterasu's original blessings and remaining true to ancestral will, as well as an awareness of His Majesty's concern for the realm and for the people's happiness and well-being, are imbued in all the realm's people. The responsibility for conducting these lies with rulers; the common people should do as they are told. If they but pay homage to the Imperial Court, they can do no evil. This is how to achieve spiritual unity. 

266 

A Long-Range Policy 

Before performances of the Daijo Ritual in antiquity, sacrificial rice fields and ritual sites were selected through divination, and reapers were dispatched to the areas selected. After obtaining the cooperation of the provincial governors there, the reapers enlisted commoners to cultivate, reap, and prepare rice for sacrificial offerings. All provinces equally possessed the opportunity of being chosen to serve the gods in this manner; and the common people aspired to toil mightily to offer rice for use in this ritual. His Majesty's desires to serve Heaven, revere ancestors, be filial, and ensure His people's livelihood were manifested throughout the Four Quarters. The provincial governors led their ple in transporting the sacrificial rice, and all people along the nation's highways assisted; so the meaning behind the Emperor's ritual acts was conveyed along the highways [of the entire nation.] 

peo- 

Moreover, each province paid a ten-thousand bale levy to defray expenses [for the Daijo Ritual], so all people in the realm understood its symbolic meaning. Ritual purifiers were dispatched throughout the realm, so everyone recognized the need to purify himself and serve the gods. The Court distributed Imperial Cloth Offerings to all shrines in the realm, so people everywhere realized that their local deities were united under Amaterasu's aegis. These Cloth Offerings conveyed the meaning behind the Emperor's ritual acts to everyone in the realmHis service to Heaven, reverence for ancestors, and love of the people. A ritual existed for every meaning to be conveyed, and through these rituals the Emperor made his will understood to the people day-in and day-out, without recourse to explanations or exhortations. Each person was loyal to his ruler, and all of them in turn revered the Imperial Court. Thus, the hearts and minds of the people were one. 

In later ages, rulers conducted rituals and politics in an abbreviated, simplified manner. The sacrificial rice fields and ritual sites employed in the Daijo Ritual, [which formerly had been located in different provinces yearly,] were permanently established [in Tamba and Bitchū]. The Ritual itself [which had been conducted in all regions of the realm] was now limited to the area near the capital. The Emperor's intentions and the 

267 

New Theses 

meaning behind his religious rituals went unknown to the people in the realm. The transporting of sacrificial rice took place over but a few tens of miles, [so people] along the nation's highways lost sight of what it stood for. Special rice levies were 

the people no longer collected from the provinces [involved], so living there became ignorant of the rituals' meaning. The practice of dispatching ritual purifiers died out, and with it, the meaning of purity before the gods. The Court ceased distributing Imperial Cloth Offerings to shrines throughout the realm, so everyone forgot that local deities were once united under Amaterasu's aegis. [Thus in later ages,] rulers might explain to every household and exhort every domicile in the land, but no one could be made to understand. These same rituals, though extant today, are devoid of their [suggestive, transforming] function. How lamentable indeed! 

In antiquity the great shrines in the capital and outlying provinces were all consecrated to gods who had assisted or performed deeds of merit on Amaterasu's behalf. The myriad gods of mountain and stream pacified man and matter, aroused wind and rain, and assisted the works of the Heavenly Deities. The local people could not help recompensing these deities' virtue, and the Imperial Court as well, felt bound to repay them. This it did through Imperial Cloth Offerings presented to provincial shrines before every Tsukinami and Niiname Ritual. 

(Gloss: In an earlier gloss I listed those shrines to which Imperial Cloth Offerings were distributed.) 

The performance of all religious rituals was under Court control and the myriad deities of the land were integrated within a [centralized] system. 

(Gloss: At present, the god Uka no Mitama is worshipped in the eleventh month. This is a carry-over from the ancient practice of worshipping local deities when the Imperial Cloth Offering was made at Niiname Ritual time. On this day, commoners prepare sake and festival foods in their homes, and they feast the entire day, much as the Chinese did during the Cha festival of Chou times. This Cha festival was conducted to

A Long-Range Policy 

give pleasure to elderly persons, and in it, one finds many ancient practices such as "playing the pin sung and beating the earthen drum," [as outlined in the Rites of Chou.] On this day, the elderly were tenderly cared for, and commoners were taught filial devotion through strict respect for a 

age order. 

In the Book of Rites, it says,] "Whether the year's crop is plentiful or poor is shown in the Pa-cha ritual." This means that when the realm (tenka) suffers a lean year, the Pa-cha ritual is dispensed with in order to conserve the people's tax revenues. During the Cha ritual the elderly were tenderly cared for, and people all across the land became drunk and delirious with wine and joy. Confucius said, "The one-day Cha festival following one hundred days of labor is a means of alternating work with play; it has something in common with the Way of Kings Wen and Wu." This is how the ancients provided the people with pleasure and harmony. It is yet another meaning that religious rituals tacitly convey.) 

Shrine storehouses contain treasured objects, weapons, supplies, provisions, documents, and other items for use at ritual time and for regulating the people's daily affairs through aweinspiring divine powers. Stockpiling provisions in shrines enables rulers to carry out the sages' original intent: "to make daily life easier for, and to ensure the livelihood of, the common people."135 

"135 Moreover, it also tacitly conveys the idea that shrines can serve as defense posts when our military state faces emergencies. 

(Gloss: I have already noted that in antiquity, government and edification were [conducted in and] conveyed through religious rituals and that the weapons of war were stockpiled in shrines. But in addition, the Kuni no miyatsuko and Agata nushi worshipped their respective domain gods, and in each domain, there were lesser officials known as "rice-stockpilers" who stored rice seedlings and plants in the villages. If we established a system modeled after this, we would always have adequate provisions against famine, and our armies would have extra supplies of rations. The awe-inspiring power of divinities would benefit the people's daily activities. But I 

269 

New Theses 

will present my views on this subject in detail on another 

occasion. 

The Chou rulers also utilized religious rituals to call people together and communicate decrees to them, to admonish them for misconduct, to place them in proper order by age, or to present awards to men of ability. . . . "Religious rituals" heads the list of The Twelve Teachings, and "service to the gods" appears at the beginning of The Eight Precepts; these served to make commoners deferential. There are countless similar examples of making them take part in religious rituals. 

In later eras, ever-normal granaries were built to benefit the people. If we incorporate the good features of such institutions found in antiquity and utilize the awe-inspiring power of divinities to carry out projects to benefit the people, they undoubtedly will submit to us, since we will have provided them with precisely what they desire. The people will submit to us just as water flows downward. At present, when Buddhist festivals are employed to call commoners together and set them to work on tasks, they respond like an echo. If the people respond this quickly when the spiritual powers of Buddhas are invoked, how much swifter would their response be when prompted by the awe-inspiring powers of our [native] gods!) 

In antiquity, then, religious ritual corresponded to government, administration was identical with edification, and the people looked to their leaders for the fulfillment of their desires. The Emperor's sincere will [to serve Heaven, embody filial devotion, and love his people] touched all deities in the realm. There was a religious ritual for every meaning His Majesty sought to convey, and through it, the people became aware of their ruler's will. They rejoiced in and respected it; their loyalty and filial devotion were unified and had a clear object to be directed to. In later ages, however, rulers conducted rituals in perfunctory fashion, ignoring their meaning to be conveyed; the myriad deities and countless rituals lacked systematic organization and coherence; the people's devotion was not directed toward a single object; and the religious rituals lost their [suggestive, transforming] function. How lamentable indeed! 

270 

A Long-Range Policy 

Imperial Mausolea have always been objects of solemn worship. But after an Emperor's relatives all passed away, it was only natural that his mausoleum became lost through neglect. The great virtue and exploits of Emperors Jimmu (who pacified the realm), Sujin (who conquered vast new areas), and Tenji (who reestablished order in the realm), however, were not forgotten; their meritorious deeds remain known even today. Our properly identify their mausoleum sites and thus can conduct array of official shrines and rituals remain incomplete until we 

rituals in their honor. 

(Gloss: It is generally thought that the Kamo Shrine is dedicated to Emperor Jimmu, but some scholars are skeptical of this due to a lack of documentation in ancient records. It is time for us to recompile our list of shrines and rituals so that no deserving deity or hero is overlooked.) 

With the spread of Buddhism, funerals were conducted according to Buddhist rituals, and many Imperial Rituals and Mausolea were lost through neglect even before relatives passed away. This created a serious defect in our array of official shrines and rituals. Likewise, the exploits of many Imperial offspring and illustrious ministers in antiquity come down to us [in legend] but remain unrecognized in our official set of rituals. As a result, their descendants find themselves in pathetic circumstances, being unable to pay proper worship to their ancestors. This too stems from our incomplete set of official shrines and rituals. To remedy this, we must consider antiquity in the light of presentday needs, revive rituals that have fallen into disuse, reinstate rituals now missing from our classics, and tacitly convey their didactic value to people. By thus inducing all people in the realm to be loyal and filial, to be sincere in their reverence for forbears, to feel gratitude and indebtedness to rulers for blessings bestowed, to hold the spirits in awe, and to respect the deities, we will make them submit [to the Way, without asking why]. 

Then the people will prostrate themselves en masse echoing, "Amaterasu inaugurated the Heavenly enterprises from on high, and Her legions of godly retainers aspired to assist Her in 

271 

New Theses 

pacifying the realm. By conducting rituals to our local gods, we requite them for their services performed on our behalf, and we recompense Amaterasu for Her original gifts to us." In short, we will have unified the myriad gods and countless rituals. The people will continue, "Amaterasu [the sun itself,] beams down on us from on high, Her Divine Descendant carries on Her Manifest Will by lovingly nurturing us, the Shogun upholds the Imperial House by maintaining peace throughout the realm, and the daimyo rule their domains-all of this allows us to enjoy stability of livelihood and security of possession. By following our lord's decrees and obeying bakufu laws, we look up to the Imperial Court and recompense Amaterasu's original gifts to us." In short, we will have unified bakufu and domain rule. When each family in the realm gathers together to conduct rituals in reverence of its ancestors, its members will say, "to revere our main house is to revere our progenitor; to live in peaceful harmony by submitting to our lord's decrees, obeying bakufu laws, looking up to the Imperial Court, and recompensing Amaterasu's original gifts to us, is to carry on the will of our ancestors." In short, we will have given unity to the people's loyalty and filial devotion. 

The benevolence of Amaterasu and Her Divine Descendants will reach the whole realm, the virtue of bakufu and domain lords will fill all under Heaven, parental love and filial reciprocity will endure forever, reverence for ancestors and gratitude to Amaterasu for Her original gifts will be elucidated to all, and the teachings of loyalty and filial devotion will be firmly established. The people will live by this Way day in and day out, and will be blind to all heresies. 

(Gloss: In the Chou period, high officials were in charge of state religion [hōkyō] and carried out the Twelve Teachings, the first of which reads, "When respectfulness is taught through religious rituals, the people become deferential." This shows how important rituals are to state religion [hōkyō].) 

Rituals can be established only when there is loyalty between ruler and subject and affection between parent and child. We must discriminate prudently the different roles for men and 

272 

A Long-Range Policy 

women, uphold the hierarchic relationship between old and commoners cooperate and assist one another at all times, preyoung, and be of good faith in dealings with friends. If we make vent crimes together, care for the sick and needy, feel affection for their rulers and leaders even to the point of dying for them, then their minds can never be led astray though faced with a thousand heresies. The barbarians' grand stratagem-to raze the dwelling places of our native deities in an attempt to introduce their own god and to incite our stupid commoners to rebel and subvert our country from within-will be counteracted. [As Sun Tzu said,] "the ultimate in warfare is to counteract the enemy's stratagems before hand." This is truly our best longrange policy. 

Those scoundrels who ruined our powers of moral suasion (kwa) and depraved our folkways in days past-shamans, Buddhist clerics, perverse Confucians, and petty scholasticswere nevertheless little children of our Middle Kingdom. If we make them live in the solace of their homes, bask in our great sphere of moral suasion, accept Imperial Benevolence, and obey bakufu and domain laws, they may pursue personal gratification as they wish throughout their lives. But should anyone swallow whole the Western barbarians' absurd tales or laud the barbarians publicly in a blind and excessive manner, thereby aiding and abetting foreigners in their attempts to subvert us, he must be prosecuted most severely. Should anyone violate these bans, he should be punished in accordance with the "Sedition and Insurgency Statutes" in the Rites of Chou. All Western goods, medicines, woolens, and the like, must be burned on sight-the sale or use of imported articles must be absolutely forbidden. Commoners must be made to despise foreigners as they would despise dogs and goats, to hate the barbarians as they would 

hate wild boars and wolves. 

(Gloss: An Imperial Edict issued in the Tempyō era [729-49] reads, "Should persons study heretical doctrines, practice the occult, or cast harmful spells on others, their leader shall be beheaded, and his followers, exiled. Any persons who live in mountainous woodlands and teach false, heretical doctrines 

273New Theses 

prac- 

under the guise of Buddhism, or who concoct poisons by mixing medicinal herbs, or who engage in other mysterious tices that violate this Imperial Edict, are subject to the same punishments as stated above." This is how rulers prohibited evil heretical doctrines in antiquity, and how we must prohibit these now if we are to teach commoners the Way. 

After we build up our military strength, put an end to the barbarians' encroachments, and extend our virtuous teachings to them so that they become our vassals and bear tribute to us, it is perfectly all right to accept and use the tribute articles they bear.) 

Anyone informing us about nefarious traitors who secretly aid and abet foreigners at sea will be rewarded the same as if he had beheaded an enemy general; anyone withholding such information will be punished the same as if he had harbored a renegade criminal. Any domain that destroys a barbarian ship will be decorated the same as if it had captured an enemy fortress; any that fails to fire on the barbarians will be punished for cowardice in the face of the enemy. Such measures [for armed expulsion] are temporary expedients, but should inspire both warriors and commoners to respect and obey bakufu injunctions. By thus strengthening our defenses, by prevailing on the realm to reform itself in the name of a [national] emergency, and by sincerely sharing the people's joys and sorrows, we should be able to rouse the realm to action. 

If we implement decrees, laws, and punishments together with rituals of edification, if we base ourselves on the ch'i of justice and carry out the Way of Righteousness, and if we firmly establish grand procedures to administer the realm, commoners will possess a basis of spiritual reliance within. [The Book of Documents] says, "Heaven obeys what the people desire." If the people obey us, and Heaven obeys them, the barbarians will be unable to turn against us the long-range policy that Amaterasu and Sage Emperors used to transform their barbarous folkways and subdue them in antiquity. Quite the contrary, we will turn against them the very stratagem that they have been trying to employ against us. Then we will regain the freedom of initiative 

274 

A Long-Range Policy 

to exercise powers of edification over them. The bakufu's decision [for armed expulsion] has been made, and the hearts of high and low alike are united. 

Diverse though our modes of action may be, all are based on the Way. Today we are prompted to extend our Imperial sphere of moral suasion (kōkwa) by the same inspiration that prompted Amaterasu and Sage Emperors to extend it [in antiquity]. If we resolutely achieve the tasks bequeathed by Amaterasu at home, and establish impenetrable safeguards against subversion from without, the foreign beasts will never be able to beguile our people no matter how hard they try. 

Naturally, achieving [Amaterasu's] tasks within the realm and implementing an eternal, long-range policy [to deal with heresies from without] cannot be done overnight. The enterprises delegated by Amaterasu were begun by Emperor Jimmu, enlarged on by Emperor Sujin, and continued with unswerving dedication by later Emperors. Therefore our Imperial sphere of moral suasion (kōkwa) extended over all within the seas. [Today,] we first must determine our fundamental [long-range] policy and establish an unswerving moral basis for action. Only then will we encompass the barbarians within Middle Kingdom Civilization, only then will we base ourselves on antiquity and clarify [the Sage Emperors'] meaning, only then will we bequeath political stratagems to our descendents in keeping with Amaterasu's precepts and carry on Ieyasu's grand traditions forever, only then will we rescue all nations in the world from suffering, only then will we eliminate every vestige of the Western barbarians' occult religions from the face of the earth, and only then will we spare the children of our Middle Kingdom from barbarian cunning. If we first establish this [immutable longrange] policy within, we will be able to deal with the infinite changes occuring from without. 

By spreading benevolence throughout the four quarters and treating the barbarians as children [of our Middle Kingdom], we will induce them to regard the Imperial Court as their loving parent. Antiquity is our guide. Making the present approximate the past prevents the future from diverging from the present: We will achieve timelessness and immutability. The barbarians 

275 

New Theses 

will bear tribute to us for all eternity. Patriots of humanity and high resolve will aspire to offer their lives to advance our cause. No matter how bewilderingly the situation before us may change, we will never lose sight of our objective; we will remain with fixed resolve forever and a day. Nourished by the rations of our Heavenly Deities, brandishing the weapons of our Heavenly Deities, and inspired by the benevolence of our Heavenly Deities, we shall wage war against the enemies of our sovereign. Our might will reverberate all over the earth. "[Our] small nation will expand, and the unruly nations will be subdued."136 Our invincible might stemming from gentleness and humanity will extend beyond the farthest reaches of the earth, and will induce foreign barbarians to approach us seeking virtue. Never again will we need to worry about commoners in outlying areas being lured into their fold. 

The ancients said, "The state's greatest concerns are rituals and war." Through war, 

Through war, we draw up a definite stratagem; through rituals, we indomitably achieve Amaterasu's enterprises. Indeed, these are the state's greatest concerns. That is why the Hero makes a panoramic survey of contemporary conditions in the realm, considers the broad vista thus obtained against the vast sweep of historical change, and establishes a timeless, immutable long-range policy. Elucidating "what is essential to a nation" (kokutai), being informed on world affairs, understanding fully the barbarians' nature, strengthening national defense, and establishing a long-range policy-these represent the best form of loyalty and filial devotion, the best method of recompensing Imperial Ancestors and Heavenly Deities, and the best way for bakufu and daimyo to rescue their peoples and dispense benevolent rule for eternity. The theses I respectfully submit are not a set of private theories: The spirits of Heaven and Earth themselves seek to share them. 

I have long kept these five theses (in seven parts) to myself, but not because I was loath to share my opinions. It is said, "The universe is a living entity." Man as well is a living entity. When one living thing operates amidst another, transformations occur which we cannot fully fathom. With the passing of ages, 

276 

up 

A Long-Range Policy 

innumerable transformations take place, and the moment at which each transpires is instantaneous. Most people are so caught with specifics that they neglect overall processes. To present my theses on overall processes, I believed, would expose me to the censure of those preoccupied with specifics. [On the other hand, I feared,] discussing how to solve difficult problems as these and how to deal with changed situations now would commit me to proposals lacking future applicability. Once ideas are verbalized they become vacuous, once committed to paper they become so many dead letters. That is why I refrained from addressing Your Lordship. 

But deep in my heart, I believe that all men, whether noble or base, have maintained the same natural ch'i that connects parent and offspring from the beginning of time to the present. Though of low status, I have received the blessings of Amaterasu and generations of Sage Emperors; I observe bakufu laws, enjoy Your Lordship's benevolence, and lack nothing to sustain my family and observe rituals to my ancestors. How can I remain silent any longer in this time of the realm's peril? Thus, I have drafted the present memorial, which outlines our present crisis in broad, long-range terms. 

The Book of Changes says, "The Way does not implement itself; that requires the Man of Talent and Virtue." To solve difficult problems as these arise and to devise methods of dealing with changed situations-these tasks await the appearance 

of the Great Hero. 

Aizawa Yasushi Spring, 1825

[^1]: Two early Chinese uages of the term shinshu (shen-chou) are noteworthy. First, the Warring States period thinker, Tsou Yen, considered China to constitute but one-eightieth of the world's surface area, and not to be the major, central portion of it. Second, in 356, Huan Wen of the Eastern Chin attempted to recover the north from barbarian conquest, and is reported to have exclaimed, "That this Wondrous Realm (shen-chou) [or China] should have sunk away to become but an empty waste for these hundred years is something for which Wang Yen and those others cannot escape the responsibility." Both of these Chinese usages are quoted from Kung-chuan Hsiao, A History of Chinese Political Thought, p. 63, and p. 646. Thus, in China as well as in Japan, the claim of divinity (shen) for one's homeland was induced or accompanied by a consciousness of geographical insignificance or military weakness toward alien powers deemed barbarian.

[^2]: On translating the philosophical term "ch" see Wing-tsit Chan, tr., Reflections on Things at Hand, p. 360. Also Fukui Fumimasa, "Seiyō bunken ni okeru 'ki' no yakugo,' pp. 557-567. On yuan ch'i as a Later Han concept, see Ki no shiso, pp. 3-11 and pp. 181-208.

[^3]: Aizawa did not really believe that the world was shaped like the human anatomy. He had access to and utilized Chinese translations of Western atlases and gazetteers and to maps drawn by Japanese geographers and explorers. Moreover, in 1824 when he was ordered by Mito han to interrogate the English seamen who came ashore at Otsuhama (Mito territory), he brought a global map of the world (chikyuzu) with him for use in the interrogation. See An'i mondo.

[^4]: The locus classicus is Shih chi, "Wu Tzu-hsü." See Shiki, p. 83; also Watson, tr., Records of the Historian, p. 22.

[^5]: Son shi, p. 89; Samuel B. Griffith, tr., Sun Tzu: The Art of War, p. 114.

[^6]: See Shiki, p. 83; Watson, Records of the Historian, p. 22. In the original context, Aizawa's two quotes are found as a single sentence rather than being divided into two.

[^7]: This phrase, "all the people of the realm be of one heart and mind" (okuchō kokoko o itsu ni shite), appears in, and can be considered the guiding principle behind, The Imperial Rescript on Education.

[^8]: Two excellent studies of the Daijo ritual exist in English. See D. C. Holtom, The Japanese Enthronement Ceremonies; also Robert S. Ellwood, The Feast of Kingship.

[^9]: Kuni no miyatsuko were provincial officers established by the Yamato Court before the Taika Reform, in the sixth century at the latest. Most appointments were given to local magnates. The office itself was abolished during the Taika Reform, but most of the Kuni no miyatsuko continued to function as District Governors (gunshi) under the Ritsu-Ryō System.

[^10]: Aizawa here quotes extensively from the Book of Changes, Book of Rites, Doctrine of the Mean, Classic of Filial Piety, Book of Documents, and Analects to support his assertions. He ends this long gloss by stating that because geographical and climatic factors (outlined in the Book of Changes) in Japan are similar to those in China and the spiritual make-up (ninjo) of the Japanese people is similar to that of the Chinese, the numerous quotations he has just made hold for both nations and peoples.

[^11]: Tomo no miyatsuko were provincial officers established by the Yamato Court before the Taika Reform. They were similar to the Kuni no miyatsuko except that they held jurisdiction over people-the various be owned by the Imperial Court, rather than territorial districts. Nihonshi jiten, p. 696. The point here is that the Imperial Court in antiquity established the "hōken" system-which I translate as "feudal." Aizawa later argues that Tokugawa Ieyasu revived this system; therefore the existing bakuhan state structure accords with the polity Japan possessed in high antiquity.

[^12]: Of course Aizawa considered Japanese history to have begun in 660 B.C., with the accession of Jimmu.

[^13]: Examples include Ex-emperors Gotoba, Tsuchimikado, and Juntoku in 1221, after the Jōkyu Uprising; and Emperor Godaigo in 1332, after the Genkō Uprising.

[^14]: Quotations from Mencius, Spring and Autumn Annals, and Rites of Chou here support Aizawa's arguments.

[^15]: By Soga no Emishi and his son, Iruko, in 645.

[^16]: To obtain lucrative trade rights with Ming China, Ashikaga Yoshimitsu accepted the degrading terms imposed by the Ming tribute system. He willingly acknowledged himself "king" of the tributary state of Japan bearing tribute to the Ming court in return for gifts bestowed by the Chinese Son of Heaven. Under such an arrangement, the Emperor in Kyoto occupied the position of the Ming emperor's sub-tributory, or so it seemed in Aizawa's eyes.

[^17]: This practice was the source of much political corruption, intrigue, and unrest in daimyo houses. In many cases, the adoption of a son as family heir was accompanied by large sums of money or political favors, so that the heirship went to the highest bidder. In other cases, high-ranking retainers plotted the assassination of a legitimate heir in order to adopt a bribe-bearing candidate from the outside. In 1830, the Fujita reform faction, to which Aizawa belonged, used the argument that an heir must be a direct male descendent of the Mito daimyo house to confirm the selection of Tokugawa Nariaki (brother of the deceased daimyo Narinobu). This was in opposition to the conservative faction then entrenched in power, which sought to adopt an heir from a Tokugawa collateral house.

[^18]: Here Aizawa quotes passages from Kumazawa Banzan and Arai Hakuseki, who also lamented and opposed the practice.

[^19]: This passage is taken from Mencius 3A/3. This view of history as a cycle of anarchy and orderly rule did not preclude progressive, linear development. Aizawa believed that history basically represented the progressive movement from "simplicity" (shitsu) to "cultured refinement" (bun); and moreover, he held that this progressive view of historical development was true also for Western "barbarians.'

[^20]: This is the Ōtsuhama Incident of 1824 in which the captain and crew of a British whaler came ashore at Mito, were captured, and were interogated by Aizawa.

[^21]: Aizawa's reference, of course, is to the bakufu's 1825 Expulsion Edict, originally proposed by the Rangakusha, Takahashi Kageyasu.

[^22]: This interpolation is based on Aizawa's statements in Kagaku jigen, p. 62.

[^23]: Here Aizawa uses the term "Shinsei," which he also employs on p. 214. But in the same quotation from the Book of Changes made on p. 332, he employs the term, "Tenso." This indicates that he used these terms interchangeably to designate Amaterasu. See Shinron, p. 64, p. 65, and p. 140.

[^24]: The distinction between shen tao, the Chinese "spirit-like processes of nature' and the Japanese shinto is of the utmost importance. In attacking an assertion made by Motoori Norinaga that Japan's "kami" and "shinto" were essentially different from the "shen" and "shen tao" of China, Aizawa merely quoted from the Book of Changes and insisted that these were the same; he could not logically refute Norinaga, but made a counter-assertion. For Aizawa's criticism of Norinaga, see Toku naobi no mitama. For Norinaga's views, Motoori Norinaga zenshu 1:534-535.

[^25]: A gloss containing a passage quoted from The Doctrine of the Mean along with Aizawa's commentary are deleted.

[^26]: Traditionally attributed to Kūkai (774-835), but in fact dating from the tenth century. The doctrine held that native deities were earthly manifestations of buddhas.

[^27]: An erroneous reference on Aizawa's part. The Cloistered Emperor Shirakawa, not ex-Emperor Go shirakawa, is reported to have made remarks to this effect in Heike monogatari.

[^28]: This refers to the Shimotsuma clan, which participated in Ikkō Uprisings. See Kagaku jigen, p. 7.

[^29]: Ogyu Sorai is the target of Aizawa's criticism. See Aizawa's Taishoku kanwa, p. 243.

[^30]: Arai Hakuseki. See ibid., p. 243.

[^31]: "Keizai no gaku." The followers of Sorai such as Dazai Shundai and Hoashi Banri.

[^32]: Aizawa is not criticizing professional Rangaku scholar-officials, but rather, "Rangaku enthusiasts" such as Shiba Kōkan or Hayashi Shihei, who possessed secondhand knowledge of conditions in the West, and used it to criticize political, social, or military conditions in Japan publicly.

[^33]: The original reads, "kuwashihoko chitaru no kuni." It is instructive to compare this Mito interpretation of this ancient name with Motoori Norinaga's. Norinaga held that "kuwashihoko" was merely a pillow word for "chi," and maintained that the appellation meant "wealthy nation." This contrasts sharply with the martial overtones that Aizawa and Fujita Toko wished to stress. See Motoori Norinaga zenshu 3:457.

[^34]: In another work Aizawa wrote, "After Jingu Kōgō conquered and incorporated the Three Kingdoms of Korea, an Imperial Magistrate (fu) was established to pacify the new territory. This 'Mimana Magistrate' was much like the 'Nagasaki Magistrate' (bugyo) of today." See Soen wagon, p. 17. Aizawa, then, definitely considered the Three Kingdoms to have been part of Japan in ancient times, and clearly lamented their subsequent loss.

[^35]: According to Confucian political theory, by "ceasing to bear tribute," the Three Kingdoms and other tributory states signified that they no longer recognized the virtue of Japan's Emperor and his claim to be dispensing virtuous government. In short, they bolted from Japan's "sphere of moral suasion" (kwa).

[^36]: This is in present-day Hokkaido. This "Imperial Magistrate" in Shiribeshi was similar to that established in Mimana, mentioned earlier. In Aizawa's mind, all of Ezo, which was then uncharted territory, was under Japanese rule in antiquity.

[^37]: These prayers are recited during the Toshigoi and Tsukinami Rituals. 38. This quote is taken from the Book of Changes.

[^39]: This military system, characteristic of warrior rule, was known as "gun'yaku," and dated from the Kamakura period. Under it, each retainer was responsible for maintaining a certain number of followers to be placed at his overlord's disposal on command. This duty was in return for stipends or grants of land. Bakufu edicts on gun'yaku date from 1616 and 1630, and stipulate five men per two-hundred koku. See Takayanagi, Nihonshi

[^40]: Presented most coherently in Kagaku jigen, pp. 79-82. jiten, p. 307.

[^41]: "Chōhei." This refers to the sankin kōtai system. That Aizawa uses the term "Court" (cho), a term usually reserved to designate a ruling dynasty, is of considerable significance.

[^42]: By providing the people with the "Way of convenience and livelihood," (riyō kōsei no michi) in antiquity, Amaterasu, in Aizawa's mind, was equivalent to China's ancient sage kings. Aizawa insisted that Amaterasu bestowed rice and silk on the Japanese people, but in his ignorance of the true conditions of the daily lives of peasants, he unwittingly ascribed rice and silk, every day consumption and use items for the samurai class, to peasants as well. In fact, peasants (except for gōno) rarely if ever wore silk and only occasionally ate boiled white rice. As scholars of Japanese folklore have pointed out, boiled white rice unmixed with other cereals was an item consumed on special occasions (hare), such as festival days, not in everyday life (ke). It is therefore unlikely that Aizawa had much success in his campaign to instill reverent gratitude toward Amaterasu and Her Imperial Line among the mass of the peasantry through such arguments.

[^43]: "Mizuho no kuni."

[^44]: An instructive anachronism on Aizawa's part. He read the fourtiered Confucian mibun system back into his idealized picture of ancient Japanese society.

[^45]: Sake, mochi, rice confections called dango, and noodles are all (hare) food idems, and as such, played an important part in the people's spiritual lives. Decrees banning the distillation of sake were periodically issued (particularly during famines) to conserve rice. Mochi and dango are made from a special type of glutinous rice (mochigome), which yields less per acre than regular rice. Hence the obstruction to agricultural production.

[^46]: The Italian Jesuit, Giuglio Aleni, who served as a missionary to China during late Ming times. Aizawa's quote is from Aleni's Chih fang wai chi which (along with Arai Hakuseki's Sairan igen), were regarded essential reading for Japanese students of the West during the latter half of the Tokugawa period. See Miyazaki Michio, Arai Hakuseki no yogaku to kaigai chishiki, p. 182.

[^47]: Two such advocates were Shiba Kōkan and Baba Masamichi. See Keene, pp. 109-110; Inobe, pp. 177-178.

[^48]: That is, the amount of land required to produce ten koku.

[^49]: Otsuki Gentaku was one such Dutch Studies scholar: He listed as "empires" Russia, China, Japan, Germany, Turkey, India, and the Mogul. Gentaku then went on to state:Japan is a small land compared with others, but it is an empire whose ruling Imperial Line has remained intact throughout the myriad ages. This is why Japan is superior to other countries, and why they stand in awe of her.... Kankai ibun, p. 415.

[^50]: This idea was fairly common at the time and served to heighten Japanese anxieties about Russian encroachment during the latter half of the eighteenth century. Hayashi Shihei, for example, quoted Arend Willem Feith (Dutch Commander of the Nagasaki Trading Post from 1771-1781) as follows: A Dutchman named Heito (Japanese transliteration) told me, "It is easier for armies from northern lands to take over territories to the south, but it is difficult for armies from southern lands to take over territories to the north. . . . Hence Holland took over Java, Tartary took over China, and Muscovy took over Tartary. All these cases represent northern states taking over lands to their south." Sankoku tsuran zusetsu, p. 263. In his Ezo sōshi (pp. 382-383), Mogami Tokunai cites this same "Captain Arento Ueruremu Heito" (Japanese transliteration) indirectly through Nagasaki Magistrate Natsume Masanobu to the same effect.

[^51]: Here Aizawa lumps all Christian peoples under the heading, "Church of Rome," but in a later section he does distinguish certain European peoples as belonging to different sects of Christianity.

[^52]: Aizawa here refers to the fact that Russian heads of state began to employ the title "Czar" from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries onward and that Russia claimed to be the successor to the Byzantine Empire.

[^53]: The Russo-Turkish War, 1768-1774.

[^54]: The connotation of this classical metaphor is "interdependence," but in this context, the interdependence is clearly not between equals: Japan needs China more than China needs Japan.

[^55]: A quotation taken from Son shi, pp. 36-37; Griffith, tr., Art of War, pp. 77-78. This idea of counteracting the enemy's strategy in advance through expulsion edicts and persecutions of Christians was a key element in Aizawa's joi thought.

[^56]: Aizawa used Mo Tzu's term chien ai to represent the Christian idea of universal love.

[^57]: Otomo Sōrin (1530-1587) at the height of his power controlled six of the nine Kyūshū provinces. He engaged in trade with Korea and Portugal, became baptized in 1578, and established seminaries and novitiates in his territories. In 1582, together with Arima Harunobu and Omura Sumitada, he sent a mission to visit the Pope in Rome, which was Japan's first mission to Europe. Konishi Yukinaga (d. 1600), another Christian daimyo, however, became a military commander under Hideyoshi, and in 1588 bewas the son of a wealthy Sakai merchant serving the Ukita clan. Yukinaga, came lord of Udo in control of half of Higo Province. After Hideyoshi's death, he along with Ishida Mitsunari, plotted to depose Tokugawa Ieyasu but suffered defeat at Sekigahara and execution.

[^58]: Nobunaga cleverly used the Jesuit missionary Gnecchi-Soldi Organtino to induce Araki (whom Nobunaga suspected of treachery) to stage an unsuccessful uprising.

[^59]: Nishi was originally a samurai from Omura domain but later became a "red-seal ship" merchant licensed by the bakufu. Aizawa is incorrect in his assertion that Nishi was sent to the West. In fact, Nishi was baptized and travelled to Manila, where he learned Spanish. Upon his return to Japan, he became a trusted advisor to Ieyasu, supplying the bakufu with information on foreign affairs.

[^60]: Ibi Masakichi spent seven years in Kyushu (saigoku), not the West, where he gathered information on Christianity and its adherents.

[^61]: These two incidents were recorded by Arai Hakuseki. See Arai Hakuseki zenshu 4:821 and 824.

[^62]: The reference is to a late Ming work, Su Nai-yü's Hsieh tu shih chü. 63. The correct title is Nagasaki yawa so, a work completed in 1720 by Nishikawa Joken (1648-1724), a Nagasaki astronomer. Nishikawa also related the Sidotti incident in this work.

[^64]: This reference is to Giovanni Battista Sidotti.

[^65]: It is related in Aizawa's Chishima ibun.

[^66]: For an account of the Benyowsky affair in English, see Donald Keene, pp. 31-35.

[^67]: Tanuma Okitsugu made this decision based on a suggestion in Kudo Heisuke's memorial, later rewritten to form the first half of Aka ezo fusetsu kō (also called Kamuchatsuka füsetsu ko), a work which Aizawa consulted.

[^68]: This refers to the Laxman and Rezanov missions in 1792-93 and 1804-05, respectively.

[^69]: The attacks were made on the order of Rezanov's subordinates there in 1806-07.

[^70]: This is clearly untrue. The Golovnin-Takadaya affair dragged on for three years, but was amicably settled in 1813. The Russians made no requests for trade. Quite the contrary, they apologized for their acts of violence in the above-mentioned incidents, saying that the attacks on Karafuto and Etorofu did not have the Czar's sanction, and the Russian government would take steps to punish the offenders.

[^71]: Aizawa received this piece of information from explorers such as Kondo Jūzō and Mogami Tokunai, Ezo sōshi, p. 393. Sato Genrokurō, of the bakufu expedition to Ezo from 1785-86 correctly identified these items distributed by the Russians to the Ainu as bread (pan), not mochi. Ezo shui, p. 307.

[^72]: This gloss is not found in the 1931 Iwanami bunko edition of Shinron, Tekiihen edited by Tsukamoto Katsuyoshi.

[^73]: This is the Phaeton Incident of 1808 in which an English warship forced its way into Nagasaki harbor in search of Dutch ships to destroy, since the two nations were then at war. The Nagasaki magistrate, Matsudaira Yasuhide, committed suicide to atone for indignities suffered.

[^74]: In 1818, the Brothers called at Uraga and requested permission to trade. This request was refused; and the crew is reported to have left two copies of Bibles translated into classical Chinese before leaving. Then in 1822, an English whaler, the Saracens, landed at Uraga and received firewood and provisions.

[^75]: This incident took place in 1816.

[^76]: This incident took place in 1806.

[^77]: These last two sentences are not as ridiculous as they appear. Although the bakufu learned about America's independence in 1809, this fact did not become publicly known until much later. The Rangakusha Ōtsuki Gentaku shared precisely the same suspicion as Aizawa. See Hoei mondo, pp. 419-420 and pp. 424-427.

[^78]: This reference probably is to Matsudaira Sadanobu's reply to Laxman's request for trade and diplomatic relations in 1793. Sadanobu boldly asserted that national exclusion and the expulsion of Western ships other than the Dutch were sacred national laws in effect since ancient times despite the lack of historical evidence supporting his claims. On this point, see Inobe, pp. 142-147. Aizawa may also have been referring to the bakufu's statement to the Russian negotiators following the Golovnin-Takadaya Incident in 1813.

[^79]: Son shi, pp. 29-30; Griffith, Art of War, p. 74.

[^80]: Aizawa owes this piece of information to Arai Hakuseki. See Arai Hakuseki zenshu 4:826.

[^81]: This reference is to the fact that Chao (137-52 B.C.) was the first to institute the garrison system in China. His troops farmed and lived off the frontier land where they were stationed. The Ti and Ch'ing were barbarian tribes that he and his troops conquered.

[^82]: Son shi, pp. 68-69; Griffith, p. 100. 83. Son shi, p. 65; Griffith, p. 98.

[^84]: Son shi, pp. 36-37; Griffith, p. 77. 85. Su Chi-yü.

[^86]: The bakufu prohibited and persecuted this sect throughout the Tokugawa period. As an article of faith, the Fuju fuse sect accepted offerings from, and performed religious services for, its own members alone. In addition, it strictly forbade its members to worship at Shinto shrines or at the temples of other Buddhist sects. The sect was not anti-bakufu, but rather, sought to maintain its independence as a religious body distinct from political and secular authority.

[^87]: A believer sat on a lotus-leaf platform, and priests chanted the Lotus Sutra. When the lotus petals wilted away, he was stabbed to death. It was believed that death in this manner guaranteed rebirth in paradise.

[^88]: A religious organization founded in the Sengoku period whose members adopted Mt. Fuji as their object of worship. Members were primarily from the merchant, artisan, and peasant classes. After 1724, edicts banning the organization were periodically issued.

[^89]: Son shi, pp. 133-134; Griffith, p. 139.

[^90]: This is attributed to Ch'en Liang (1143-1194).

[^91]: Son shi, pp. 133-135; Griffith, p. 139.

[^92]: Son shi, pp. 126-127; Griffith, pp. 135-136.

[^93]: This is a subtle hint to the effect that talented but low-ranking members of the Fujita reform faction (to which Aizawa belonged) in Mito domain should be granted posts in the domain government at the expense of the conservative faction then entrenched in positions of authority by virtue of their hereditary house rankings.

[^94]: Aizawa criticized the dochaku theses advocated by Kumazawa Banzan and Ogyu Sorai on the basis that the systems they sought to implement were suited to "centralized empires" (gunken no sei), not "feudalism" (hōken no sei), and that therefore, these two thinkers failed to take "historical conditions" (jisei) into account. Aizawa presented his own theory in Kagaku jigen, pp. 79-82.

[^95]: Chinese historians employed this term, "subversives," or "ryūzoku," to designate the peasant armies of Li Tzu-ch'eng and Ch'ang Hsien-chung, whose rebellions toppled the Ming dynasty prior to the Manchu conquest.

[^96]: One of Aizawa's primary aims behind putting the nation on a wartime footing was to impose state controls over the merchant class and to allow bakufu and daimyo to appropriate the merchants' right to deal in and transport rice within Japan. Honda Toshiaki and Sato Shin'en also advocated such ideas.

[^97]: This point was also made by Ogyu Sorai in Seidan, although he used the term "kaku." These kaku, Sorai said, had not been prescribed in the rituals of ancient times, nor had they been established by the bakufu, but had sprung up spontaneously, and were not informed by coherent or logical principles. See Ogyu Sorai zenshu 6:126.

[^98]: This point was also made by Hayashi Shihei. See Hayashi Shihei zenshu 1:126.

[^99]: Put differently, a 12.5 koku tax yield would be required to obtain the 5 koku stipend.

[^100]: Two quotations from Ming sources have been omitted.

[^101]: Aizawa is referring to the exchange of money or other valuables and food, water, and firewood taking place between Japanese commoners in coastal areas and Western sailors. Aizawa conceived of such activities solely as smuggling, or illicit trade, since all trade conducted by Japan with foreign countries according to bakufu law had to be conducted under bakufu control or with bakufu permission.

[^102]: We should note that the role Aizawa envisioned for these warships is purely a defensive one. For this reason, I call his naval forces a "coast guard" throughout this translation.

[^103]: Son shi, pp. 63-64; Griffith, p. 97.

[^104]: The reference is to Hayashi Shihei and Takahashi Kageyasu. See Hayashi, Kaikoku keidan, p. 126. Moreover, Hayashi argued that large cannon should be fired from shore, not mounted aboard ships because the recoil when fired might break open and sink the small, frail Japanese ships. For Takahashi, see Takahashi Kageyasu no kenkyū, pp. 289-294.

[^105]: Aizawa owes this idea to Chi Chi-kuang (1528-1585).

[^106]: Aizawa refers to the ship in question as "barbarian" (ry ohaku), but it was in fact Chinese (karabune). See Tsuko ichiran 5:294.

[^107]: A chapter in his Chi hsiao hsin shu.

[^108]: This was taken from Hayashi Shihei's Kaikoku heidan (pp. 127128). Aizawa's original term, "sumpan, might be translated "board." Hayashi wrote, "The Westerners call their ships 'castles on the water' while the Chinese call theirs 'boards' (han); and the difference between the two is as great as night and day."

[^109]: This statement probably refers to the "ama no iwakusubune" and "tori no iwakusubune" that were used to set adrift the Leech Child born by Izanami mentioned in Nihon shoki. See Nihon shoki, p. 87 and p. 89.

[^110]: Ibid., p. 249.

[^111]: Yü Ta-yu (d. 1580) and C'hi Chi-kuang were Ming commanders who did much to suppress piracy and eliminate the wako menace along China's eastern seaboard.

[^112]: Aizawa's esteem for Peter the Great is evidenced in Chishima ibun, which Aizawa compiled in 1801. Aizawa's reference to Peter as a "khan, is instructive because it reveals his early image of Russians as horseriding nomadic hordes. Here he expresses admiration for their attainment of naval power.

[^113]: "Kaikoku." Aizawa clearly surpassed Hayashi's Kaikoku heidan, both in tactical thinking and assessing the international situation. For example, Hayashi believed that cannon and small ships were sufficient to ward off attackers, and he conceived of the Ch'ing Chinese, not Westerners, as probable enemies.

ground" and "frontier ground," respectively. See Art of War, p. 131.

[^124]: Son shi, pp. 118-121. Griffith translates these terms "dispersive 125. Son shi, pp. 131-133. This is to prevent them from defecting.

[^127]: Ibid., pp. 36-37; Griffith, p. 77.

[^128]: Son shi, pp. 36-37; Griffith, p. 78.

[^129]: The term "shen tao" should not be interpreted according to the Japanese reading "shinto." Aizawa adapted his portion of his text from a passage in the Book of Changes ("kuan" hexagram) that reads, "When they [the sages] gaze on the spirit-like processes of nature (shen tao), the seasons unfold in proper order. The sages establish teachings in accordance with these spirit-like processes of nature, and the realm submits [in proper order]." Aizawa obviously substituted "Amaterasu" for "the sages," and inserted "loyalty and filial devotion" as the specific teachings that were "in accordance with shen tao." By means of these precepts, Aizawa believed, the realm could be induced to submit voluntarily and forever.

[^130]: Aizawa's probable source for this assertion, Nihon shoki (p. 238), reads simply, "... so fearful was Emperor Sujin of Her divine power that he did not feel at ease in the same abode." This mentions nothing about publicly worshipping Amaterasu to achieve spiritual unity: Aizawa clearly misused the source for political purposes.

[^131]: According to the Nihon shoki (pp. 244-246, 250-252), Takehani Yasuhiko led an uprising in 88 B.C., and Izumo Furune killed his brother for having surrendered the Divine Jewels of Izumo upon the demands of the Imperial Court in 38 B.C.

[^132]: That is, the sages' "true" good teachings that according to Mencius "capture the peoples' hearts."

[^133]: Aizawa consciously adapted this sentence from a statement in Mencius, "Unless the way of Yang Chu and Mo Tzu are blotted out, the Way of Confucius remains unelucidated." Ito Jinsai also quoted this passage along with another, "Some call me disputatious [but when battling heresies how can I be otherwise?]" in his Dōjimon, p. 140. Aizawa used this same phrase, "Some call me disputatious," as the title of an essay written in 1828 wherein he inveighed against Christianity. In short, Aizawa conceived of himself as carrying on this tradition of heresy-extirpation begun by Mencius and continued by Jinsai. Christianity was the most recent in a long list of dangerous heresies that intermittently sprang up during the

course of history.

[^134]: A long gloss comparing similarities between religious rituals in China and Japan is deleted here. In this and numerous other glosses Aizawa asserts that the function of religious ritual observances and the nature of the deities worshipped by the Chinese and Japanese people were virtually identical. This shows Aizawa's intellectual debts to the Kimon School of "coincidental correspondences."

[^135]: This concept is found in the Book of Documents, "Ta Yü mo." According to Aizawa, both the ancient sage kings in China and Amaterasu in Japan achieved these ends for their peoples. See Kagaku jigen, pp. 51-59.

[^136]: This is part of a Shinto prayer delivered during the Toshigoi Ritual. Aizawa, like twentieth-century nationalists, here interprets it in an expansionist fashion.
