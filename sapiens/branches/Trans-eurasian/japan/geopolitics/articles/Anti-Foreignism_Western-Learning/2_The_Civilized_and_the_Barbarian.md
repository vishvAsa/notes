The Civilized and the Barbarian 

Explaining the bakumatsu slogan "Expel the barbarians" (jōi) seems simple enough. The Japanese are civilized and are superior to Western barbarians; Western ships approaching Japan are to be driven off by force. But this simplicity is beguiling. The con- cepts of "civilization" and "barbarism," as applied to peoples and nations, underwent important changes during the Edo period. Roughly speaking, early in the period, Japanese think- ers saw Ming dynasty China as representing civilization in con- trast to Japan which they considered a barbarian state. Since Europeans were largely out of sight and mind, they escaped ready categorization. And in any case, these categories were cul- tural, having little to do with military force. But by the nine- teenth century, Tokugawa thinkers claimed that their nation had surpassed Ch'ing dynasty China as the center of world civili- zation, and they reviled Westerners as barbarians who should be expelled militarily. Only after tracing how the concepts of civili- zation, barbarism, and expulsion evolved during the Tokugawa period will we properly understand Aizawa's joi rhetoric in New Theses. 

Efforts to trace this evolution are complicated by problems of historical terminology. In Tokugawa times, the Sino-Japanese terms connoting civilization-Chuka and Chugoku-were not value-free geographic names for China, as they are today. In- stead, these terms were honorifics: Many Tokugawa thinkers felt that using them to designate China demeaned their own nation. Yet at the same time, a good many early Tokugawa Con- fucians thought of Japan, not Western countries, as barbarian.

Civilized and Barbarian 

What precisely set civilization off from barbarism as these concepts evolved over time? Just when did joi take on primarily military, as opposed to cultural, overtones? How did contact with Western cultures and peoples alter these ideas? To discuss these historical issues as they would have appeared to Aizawa, I begin this chapter by borrowing two theoretical models. One, adapted from John K. Fairbank and Uete Michiari, depicts the Sinocentric Middle Kingdom world view which differentiates Confucian moral civilization from barbarism.1 The other, which can be traced all the way back to the writings of Chu Hsi (1130- 1200) defines joi, or the "expulsion of what is barbarian" in cultural terms.2 I apply these models to the thought of sentative Tokugawa thinkers in order to outline the broad his- torical development of these key concepts central to Aizawa's New Theses.

CIVILIZATION: WHERE CONFUCIAN RITUAL OBTAINS 

Middle Kingdom Civilization3 was conceptualized in two dimen- sions: the vertical social hierarchy, on which "superior men" occupied a position midway between Heaven above and the masses of commoners below; and the horizontal-geographic plane, where inhabitants of a central realm were thought to be morally and culturally superior to aliens beyond its pale. One defining characteristic of the Middle Kingdom on both the vertical-hierarchic axis and the horizontal-geographic plane was to possess "rites, rituals, and the rules of proper behavior"- believed to be the essence of civilized existence. Another essen- tial characteristic was to be literate in, or at least familiar with, classical Chinese. After all, people belonging to the central realm of civilization upheld the customs and conformed to the values and norms set down in classical Confucian writings. Con- fucians thought of commoners and aliens as similar in the sense that both required edification (kyōkwa) or moral transforma- tion (kwa) through the mystical power of ritual and music and what Mencius called "good teachings." 

This identification of the Confucian literati with civilization, and of commoners and aliens with barbarism, was a highly 

18 

Civilization 

abstract, idealized view. Theoretically, the leisure and means to pursue classical learning and thereby gain a knowledge of ritual and music were largely literati privileges. Therefore, commoners and aliens were not expected to embody civilization unless they were morally transformed or edified by their rulers from above. This ritual edification centered on making one's activities accord with one's hereditary social-status designation. In short, ritual edification was designed to produce submissive adherence to the existing social hierarchy. In like manner, edified aliens sig- nified their proper subservience to Middle Kingdom Civilization by submitting themselves to rituals such as the kowtow. 

This world view, which categorized peoples as either civilized or barbarian, was of Chinese origin and therefore was extrinsic to early Tokugawa Japan; it poorly fit the realities of Japan as a small island country. For example, "the world" as conceptual- ized in Sinocentric terms was "all under Heaven" (tenka), and it recognized no fixed national boundaries. As Arai Hakuseki (1657-1725) wrote in the context of international law, for ex- ample, "A crime is a crime anywhere on earth" (tenka no aku wa hitotsu nari).5 In another usage, tenka designated "the realm," or the geographical extent of Middle Kingdom Civiliza- tion conceived of as China (or Japan). But according to Con- fucian political theory, these two conceptions of tenka ought to coincide: The Chinese (or Japanese) empire ideally should encompass all under Heaven, and extend to the ends of the earth. Through benevolent government and ethical example, and by extending the benefits of advanced Middle Kingdom Civilization, the emperor, the Son of Heaven, ought to incor- porate aliens within it. On the other hand, if he conducted cruel government and set an evil example, not only would aliens refuse to "come to be transformed," commoners also would cease submitting to his authority. 

Commoners and alien barbarians were identical in one im- portant sense. Normally, both were ignorant of the civilized way of life defined by ritual and classical canon; both had to be morally transformed by the emperor. And both presented a threat to the existing hierarchical order characterizing Sino- centric civilization. Chinese bandit-rebels were seen as little 

19 

Civilized and Barbarian 

different from barbarian invaders in that they refused to affirm and submit to this Middle Kingdom world view. Whether the Middle Kingdom's borders expanded or contracted, whether barbarians remained outside it or were incorporated within it, and whether commoners acquiesced below or revolted against those above, depended on the emperor's virtue, benevolent gov- ernment, ritual observances, and moral transformation. 

Thus, the Middle Kingdom world view boils down to four essential characteristics: (1) centrality on both the horizontal- geographic and vertical-hierarchic dimensions, (2) extensiveness or widespread acceptance by both aliens and the lower classes in society, and (3) superiority based on Sinocentric moral and cul- tural standards. Moreover, Confucians presumed that extensive- ness and superiority were inseparable: The emperor's personal virtue, the excellence of Middle Kingdom Civilization, and the "transforming power" of ritual and good teachings would win eager acceptance by commoners and foreign barbarians alike in all historical epochs. This universal acceptance found concrete form in customs or folkways that correspond to Confucian teachings and theoretically should prevail everywhere and at all times. Therefore, (4) Middle Kingdom Civilization was charac- terized by timeless cultural monism. 

Jõi is another ambiguous, problematic term. It too is of Chi- nese origin and was alien to early Tokugawa Japan. One key example that clarifies its meaning is in Chu Hsi's commentary on the Analects. There he introduces the phrase, "to revere the Chou dynastic house and sweep away (or eradicate) what is barbarian." This phrase glosses the following passage: 

[Analects:] Tzu-kung said, "I do not suppose Kuan Chung was a benevolent man. Not only did he not die for Prince Chiu, but he lived to help Duke Huan, who had the Prince killed." The Master said, "Kuan Chung helped Duke Huan to become the leader of the feudal lords (pa) and to rectify all under Heaven. To this day, the common people still enjoy the benefit of his acts. Had it not been for Kuan Chung, we might well be wearing our hair down and folding our robes to the left...."8 

20Civilization 

In short, according to Chu Hsi, Confucius defended and praised Kuan Chung (7th c. B.C.), a minister who ruled by force instead of benevolence. Confucius defended him for preventing the common people's customs and manners from being transformed to alien ways. For Confucius, as construed by Chu Hsi, "wear- ing our hair down and folding our robes to the left" constituted a violation of ritual, or the proper rules of behavior, which set off civilized life from barbarism. In Chu Hsi's interpretation, Confucius had asserted that, by rescuing Middle Kingdom Civili- zation from morally and culturally backward foreign ways, Kuan Chung performed an act of joi. Tokugawa thinkers before 1825 thought of joi primarily as Chu Hsi's gloss indicates: the cultural sense of "sweeping away (or eradicating) what is bar- barian." By tracing how this idea of "cultural joi" developed in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, we will gain the back- ground knowledge needed to understand why joi took on mili- tary overtones in the era 1793 to 1825. 

During the seventeenth and through most of the eighteenth centuries, Japan had little contact with Western cultures. As a result, Caucasians did not enter much into Japanese thinking about civilization and barbarism. Westerners were described as "red-hairs" or "Southern barbarians," but they were not objects of animosity unless they attempted to spread Christianity; Japanese in the early Edo period persecuted Christians, but not Westerners as such. The most significant disputes as to who was civilized and who barbarian centered on Japan's relationships with her Asian neighbors. As Tsukamoto Manabu holds, early Tokugawa thinkers tended to admit Japan's barbarian status to- ward Chinese civilization; they generally did not stigmatize Westerners as barbarians. Toward the end of the eighteenth cen- tury, after the rise of Dutch Studies, Westerners did take on this stigma. 10 And after Fujita Yukoku, Aizawa Seishisai, and their Mito Learning emerged in the early nineteenth century, many politically conscious Japanese denigrated Westerners as sub- human beasts.1 

11 

Japanese perceptions of China, Japan, and the West as being civilized or barbarian changed during the Edo period, and in the discussion that follows I seek to place these perceptions in 

21 

Civilized and Barbarian 

dynamic historical perspective. Tokugawa thinkers, even early in the period, had not borrowed the abstract idea of Middle Kingdom Civilization from China without serious reservations. Later on, in response to attacks from Native Learning (Koku- gaku) and Western Learning, scholars of Mito Learning had to create a "Japan-centered" Middle Kingdom world order sub- stantially different from the Sinocentric view. 

JAPAN: A LAND OF SPLENDID BARBARIANS 

Early Tokugawa Confucians faced a difficult problem: how to Japanize the Way of the Chinese Sages without losing its univer- sal validity and value, but also without compromising too much of Japan's cultural tradition. 12 This problem overlay more fun- damental questions about the nature of civilized life itself. Could there be culture and morality apart from Confucianism? If not, how could Confucianism be detached from its Chinese moorings, from the Chinese society and way of life that pro- duced it, and from the classical Chinese language that trans- mitted it? Were the categories of civilization and barbarism fixed along racial or ethnic lines? If not, how could an alien people like the Japanese leave barbarism behind and become part of Chinese civilization? Or was this really a desirable aim? Many Tokugawa Confucians found answers to these gnawing questions in this passage from the Analects: 

夷狄之有君不如諸夏之亡也 

The passage allows two radically different interpretations. 13 Following the pre-Sung commentaries, we get, "[Even though] 

the eastern and northern barbarians possess rulers, [they] are 

e."14 Accord- 

not as good as the Middle Kingdom which lacks one. 

ing to this older interpretation, pu-ju Fa 

meant "do not 

measure up to." Chu Hsi, on the other hand, claimed that ju 如 meant "to be similar to," which would make the passage read, "The eastern and northern barbarians who possess a ruler 

are [very much] unlike the Middle Kingdom which lacks one. 

15 

By adhering to the older interpretation, scholars might con- tend that China's superiority to the barbarians, whether based 

22 

A Land of Splendid Barbarians 

on morality, culture, language, or, in an extreme case, blood, was absolute. Other factors such as the political unity and ad- ministrative order achieved by aliens (suggested by the existence of a ruler over them) counted for nothing. Confucius emerges as confident that civilization is inseparable from the Chinese way of life. 

By contrast, if scholars in later ages or foreign lands chose to follow Chu Hsi's interpretation, a whole new avenue of possi- bilities opened up. Confucius emerges as deferential toward aliens, as willing to acknowledge their political accomplishments and to admit that the Chinese in his day did not measure up. Because the Chinese people lacked good rulers, they suffered anarchy and civil strife. Following Chu Hsi, it might be argued that Confucius attributed equal, if not preponderate, weight to factors other than Chinese culture or race in judging the worth 

of men. 

According to the older interpretation, narrow ethnocentric criteria determined Middle Kingdom superiority; non-Chinese were simply excluded from civilized life. But Chu Hsi's inter- pretation allowed Tokugawa thinkers leeway to claim quasi- Middle Kingdom status for themselves and their nation. They could acknowledge Japan to be ethnically barbarian, but still declare it superior to Ming or Ch'ing China based on other cri- teria within the general framework of Confucian values. Civilized life did not require Chinese lineages or inclusion in the Chinese empire; many specific aspects of Chinese culture also were dispensable. 

A good number of Tokugawa Confucians adopted this cul- tural relativism based on Chu Hsi's portrayal of Confucius, even scholars like Ito Jinsai (1627-1705), who contentiously rejected Chu Hsi Learning on most other counts. In commenting upon the above passage from the Analects, Jinsai wrote, 

[Analects:] "The eastern and northern barbarians who possess rulers are [very much] unlike the Middle Kingdom which lacks 

one." 

[Jinsai's gloss:] Confucius was extremely attentive to the slightest change in customs of the times. . . . What a tremendous 

23 

Civilized and Barbarian 

change he notes here! Although the states of China are sup- posedly that area of the world where ritual and righteousness exist, he says that China does not measure up to the barbar- ians. That is why he wrote the Spring and Autumn Annals. ... In it, he called "barbarian" any Chinese lord who adopted alien rituals, and he treated as part of the "Middle Kingdom" any alien who advanced to adopt the rituals of the Middle Kingdom. Confucius [impartially] praised the good as good, and hated the evil as evil. How can this distinction [of civilized and barbarian] be [arbitrarily] applied to Chinese and bar- barian peoples?16 

Here Jinsai equates "customs of the times" with the rituals men practice-whether those of the Middle Kingdom or of the bar- barians. He defines "good" as practicing the rituals of Middle Kingdom Civilization, and "bad" as ignoring or rejecting them. It was wrong to attribute moral or cultural superiority to the Chinese people as such. Aliens could advance to Middle King- dom standing by adopting the rituals and customs of the Middle Kingdom. Conversely, ethnic Chinese could revert to barbarism by rejecting Middle Kingdom rituals and customs for those of aliens. In other words, civilization and barbarism were mutually convertible categories for Jinsai. 

Jinsai declared Japan to be one of the nine barbarian tribes of the east amongst whom, according to the Analects, Confucius wanted to settle. Jinsai, along with many early Tokugawa Con- fucians, acknowledged Japan's "barbarian" status relative to Chi- nese civilization. But this did not demean Japan, for she could boast moral excellence precisely because she was barbarian. Let us examine Jinsai's rationale for that assertion, based on his interpretation of this key passage from the Analects. 

[Analects:] "The Master wanted to settle amongst the nine barbarian tribes of the east. Someone said, 'But could you put up with their uncouth ways?' The Master said, 'A gentleman (chün-tzu) once settled there, so what uncouthness can there 

be?"" 

After identifying the Japanese as one of these nine tribes, Jin- sai went on to comment that the so-called uncouthness of 

24 

A Land of Splendid Barbarians 

barbarians really stemmed from their faithfulness. From ancient times, he noted, there were reports that "a country of gentle- men" existed off to the east. Then he went on: 

[Jinsai's gloss:] Confucius once said, "The barbarians with their ruler are [very much] unlike the Middle Kingdom which lacks one." From this we can see that he long held the nine barbarian tribes close to his heart. The present passage and the lament he uttered in the "put to sea on a raft" passage are identical in meaning. 

No matter where under Heaven or where on earth [they may live], all men are equally men. Even a barbarian, if he but possesses ritual and righteousness, is a part of the Middle Kingdom. Even a Chinese, should he lack ritual and righteous- ness, cannot escape being barbarian. Shun was born an eastern barbarian and King Wen of Chou was born a western barbar- ian, but their being aliens made no difference [to their be- coming sages]. Though the countries of the nine barbarian tribes are far away, none lies outside the universe (tenchi). Their inhabitants possess the ordinary nature of all other men. Indeed, their simplicity is always that of faithfulness, while [Middle Kingdom] Civilization is often that of falsity. No wonder Confucius "wanted to settle amongst" them. 18 (empha- sis added) 

When we read this gloss together with the one Jinsai added to the "put to sea on a raft" passage mentioned above, we get the point he was driving at. 

[Analects:] "The Master said, "The Way is not being carried out; I shall put to sea on a raft. The one who would follow me will surely be Yu.'" 

[Jinsai's gloss:] This passage means the same as the "the Mas- ter wanted to settle amongst the nine barbarian tribes of the east" passage. It surely represents Confucius's long-cherished aspiration. [In China] at that time, rulers were foolish and ministers acted haughtily, so Confucius had no place to go [to implement his ideals]. Hence he wished "to put to sea on a raft" and morally transform island barbarians so that their 

25 

Civilized and Barbarian 

customs would be those of [Middle Kingdom] ritual and righ- teousness. Here we see the Sage's heart, which seeks to trans- form morally the entire world. 

These are amazing philological acrobatics. From the first line-"The Way is not being carried out; I shall put to sea on a raft"-Jinsai nimbly jumped to the conclusion that Confucius despaired of his homeland and desired to spread his teachings in Japan. The island barbarians there practiced faithfulness stem- ming from simplicity, and evinced superiority to the falsity of Chinese civilization. Confucius had a soft spot in his heart for barbarians like the Japanese; he viewed alien peoples in an egali- tarian, universalistic light, since they possessed the same "ordi- nary nature" as the Chinese. Shun and King Wen overcame alien birth to attain moral superiority over ethnic Chinese, had they not? 

Jinsai submitted one other reason for Japan's moral superiority to China, this time not only the China of Confucius's era, but the China of all eras: 

Emperor Jimmu's first year of rule upon founding our nation corresponds to the seventeenth year of the Chou emperor King Hui's reign [660 B.C.]. But here in Japan the statuses of sovereign and minister have been strictly upheld down to the present day. We revere our sovereigns as though they were Heaven, and we honor them as though they were divinities. Truly, in this respect China is not our equal. 

Jinsai's gloss on Confucius's lament, "The Way is not being car- ried out," as we recall, read, "rulers were foolish and ministers acted haughtily, so Confucius had no place to go [to implement his ideals]." That is why he desired to leave China for Japan. Had he in fact done so, he would have lauded what he found there during the next two thousand years. Jinsai believed that no Chinese ruling house enjoyed the measure of faithful rever- ence and honor that Japan's imperial line did, hence he could boast, "China is not our equal." 

We should not overemphasize Jinsai's use of the imperial insti- tution to prove Japan's superiority to China, for this is a minor 

26 

A Land of Splendid Barbarians 

feature of his thought. Unlike the Kokugakusha, or scholars of Native Japanese Learning, he did not argue that the imperial line's longevity revealed divine will, or that it was unique to Japan, and therefore proved in itself that Japan was superior. Instead, he felt that the unbroken imperial line signified Japan's superior adherence to a set of values within the Confucian tradi- tion-simplicity and faithfulness in strictly maintaining a hier- archic social order. Phrased differently, Japan embodied the hierarchical status order of Middle Kingdom Civilization better than China. 

In asserting Japan's moral excellence, Jinsai first posited China as Middle Kingdom Civilization, examined its actual per- formance against certain of its own professed standards of nor- mative culture, and noted how grievously it fell short. Then he showed how Japan, despite being a barbarian nation, actually out-performed China according to certain other criteria of Sino- centric moral culture. Japan was like the sage kings, Shun and King Wen: Alien birth did not hinder the attainment of moral superiority over ethnic Chinese. 

Jinsai, it should be stressed, was a thoroughgoing Confucian. He once praised the Analects as "the greatest book ever written anywhere in the world."21 This stands in marked contrast to Motoori Norinaga's preference for Japanese classics such as Ko- jiki, Genji monogatari, and Shinkokinshu. Jinsai judged Japan according to imported, Sinocentric conceptual categories and ethical standards. Most important, he conceded that Japan was a barbarian nation. He espoused elements of an egalitarian, uni- versalistic view of man's nature found in Confucianism, but did so to allow Japan to claim superiority over China. 

Jinsai emphasized the idea that customs disclosed whether a people were civilized or barbarian. If their customs corresponded to "ritual and righteousness," they were civilized, if not, bar- barian. Confucius was not concerned with the Chinese people alone; he wished to transform morally all peoples on earth. A ruler performed the act of joi by morally transforming alien peoples and preventing his own people from adopting alien ways; he eradicated what is culturally barbarian and ensured that customs in his land conformed to Middle Kingdom "ritual 

27 

Civilized and Barbarian 

and righteousness." Jinsai explicitly defined joi in exactly the same way as Chu Hsi: He employed that term in a gloss, "Revere the Chou dynastic house and sweep away (or eradicate) what is barbarian." In this gloss, Jinsai, too, praised Kuan Chung's act of joi, or "eradication of what is culturally barbarian," and he went on to argue: 

The benefit received [by Confucius and his people] was that they did not become barbarian; the righteous meaning of dis- tinctions between ruler and minister, and father and son re- mained intact. . . . In the Warring States period [403-221 B.C.], the common people's suffering was extreme: Only because of Kuan Chung could they nonetheless remain "people of Middle Kingdom Civilization." If not for Kuan Chung, they would have become "a barbarian people. . . ."22 

For Jinsai, as for Chu Hsi, joi meant preserving the common people's customs against barbarism and upholding Middle King- dom Civilization construed as the Confucian hierarchical status- order in society. 

Before concluding this section on early Tokugawa views of civilization and barbarism, we should note certain key ideas that thinkers in the next two centuries would carry on. Middle King- dom Civilization was that part of the world and stratum in so- ciety where customs accorded with Confucian ritual, or ethical rules of behavior, and where people understood the classical Chinese language that conveyed that ritual. These two prerequi- sites to Middle Kingdom standing-ritual and classical language- did not obtain among the lower orders in Ming, Ch'ing, or Tokugawa society or among alien barbarians. 23 Commoners as well as aliens had to be edified or morally transformed. Yamaga Sokō expressed this idea when he wrote that barbarism corre- sponded to "where moral transformation (or suasion) does not extend."24 The people there were ignorant of proper behavior: "Their customs are bad and they do not know good from evil." 25 Sokō noted that different lands possessed different customs due to different endowments of "vital force" (ch'i). But even so, he held that, because all people shared the same "moral principle" (li), aberrant customs could be transformed to accord with Con- 

28 

A Land of Splendid Barbarians 

fucian norms of conduct. 26 Moreover, though he had Japan, not Western nations, in mind, he wrote that "the sages created teach- ings appropriate to each land and each people's customs. Like Jinsai, he allowed room for Japan to be slightly different from, yet superior to China. Japan, not China, was truly worthy of the name "Middle Kingdom Civilization" (Chugoku), he de- clared. However, and this is of great importance, Sokō held that Japan was superior to China based on Sinocentric criteria of judgment. In other words, he claimed that Japan was more Con- fucian than China in certain key respects-not that Japan was superior in its own right. 

Soko stressed that barbarians and commoners had a common nature: "The relationship between ruler and minister among barbarians is just like that between merchants in Middle King- dom Civilization."28 He wrote, "When intermingling with bar- barians occurs, the customs of Middle Kingdom Civilization are transformed to profit-seeking."29 This led to such a degenera- tion of morals that commoners "do not differ from birds and beasts."30 Customs would "reach the point where commoners despised and eliminated their rulers."31 Thus to Soko, Middle Kingdom Civilization signified the extent to which moral suasion or moral transformation prevailed. The ruler had to carry out a form of cultural jõi through edification. "Since moral transfor- mation depends on ritual and music," he remarked, "looking at these will reveal whether the realm enjoys orderly rule or suffers from disorder,"32 and "Customs are improper unless there is moral transformation."33 

Thus, early Tokugawa Confucians (except the Kimon School, discussed below) generally accepted the Sinocentric Middle Kingdom world view that discriminated China-as-civilization from barbarism. They grudgingly tended to admit that Japan was barbarian and, hence, inferior in at least some respects to China. They tried to find ways of asserting Japan's parity with, if not superiority to, Ming or Ch'ing China without disavowing Confucianism as a universalistic creed. But their strained argu- ments (such as Jinsai's non sequitur about Confucius putting to sea) failed to convince contemporaries. 

In short, they tried to relativize or accommodate Sinocentric 

29 

Civilized and Barbarian 

moral culture to indigenous values and socio-political realities. Thinkers like Jinsai wanted to achieve Japanese pride and inde pendence within the Sinocentric world view: Though Japan was a barbarian country, it still could claim moral excellence based on virtues within the Chinese Confucian tradition. Later, eighteenth-century Japanese intellectuals would find such arguments far-fetched and intolerable. They relativized Sino- centric moral culture even further, and some ended up rejecting 

it totally. 

INNATE JAPANESE SUPERIORITY: THE RISE OF KOKUGAKU 

Jinsai based his view of civilization and barbarism on ancient Chinese perceptions of world geography. He conceptualized the world as "all under Heaven," or "that which Heaven covers and the earth supports," or "all within the four seas. 

Much as English expressions like "to the ends of the earth" or "to the four corners of the world" suggest, Jinsai's cosmology saw the world as a plane, a flat surface. The states of ancient China sup- posedly occupied the center of this plane and most of its surface area. This centrality and extensiveness carried assumptions of cultural and moral superiority to aliens living on the plane's fringes. 35 Jinsai himself admitted that Japan was a peripheral island: To reach it, Confucius would have had to "put to sea on a raft." 

Before the advent of Western Learning, Buddhism had provided at least two alternatives to this Sinocentric view of world geog- raphy in medieval Japan. One placed Mt. Sumeru at the center of the earth and described Japan as "a peripheral cluster of lands resembling scattered millet."36 The other was the Three King- doms view of Tenjiku (India), Shintan (China), and Japan. In either case, Japan assumed a marginal, insignificant position in 

the world. 

Not every Tokugawa Confucian shared Jinsai's Sinocentric view of world geography. Asami Keisai (1652-1711) of Yama- zaki Ansai's Kimon School expounded a significantly different view in "Chugoku ben" (On defining Middle Kingdom Civiliza- tion), which he wrote in 1701.37 Keisai declared that China's 

30The Rise of Kokugaku 

putative superiority to Japan based on geographic extensiveness had no grounding in reality: 

A map of the nations in the world shows that China (Kara) does not occupy even one one-hundredth of its surface. There are several nations (kuni) ten times as large as China. If we were to designate one of them "Middle Kingdom Civiliza- tion," and China, "barbarian," would the Chinese (Karahito) approve?38 

Here Keisai calls contemporary China "Kara." He used this value- free term to claim that China is distinct from "Chugoku," as a value-laden metaphor for civilization. Keisai denied contempo- rary China's claim to superiority based on geographic extensive- ness, centrality, and other traditional criteria. For example, he dismissed the Book of Rites, which said that China's Mt. Sung- kao was the centerpoint of the world. This was claimed because measurements conducted in antiquity supposedly showed that the shadows that mountain cast in sunlight or moonlight were "perfectly equal." But, as Keisai pointed out, such would be true at all points along the sun's zenith. 

[Mt. Sung-kao] is the centerpoint of China (Kara). . . . The sun revolves in an arc over the "equatorial line." Can there be any place on the equatorial line that does not have shadows of equal length? If you measured these at various spots along it, you would find them all of equal length.39 

Keisai himself does not propound the earth's sphericity here, though a small number of Japanese Confucians knew and ac- cepted this theory as early as 1650.40 Rather, his views fit into the traditional Confucian framework. What concerns us is how he used new knowledge of world geography to refute the Sino- centric association of centrality and extensiveness with superi- ority. China-as Kara, not Chugoku-was not the center of a world perceived as a flat "all under Heaven." Centrality, if deter- mined in a neutral, objective manner, no longer corresponded to some middle point such as Mt. Sung-kao in China, but rather, was a line. China was but one among many lands-and a small one at that. 

31 

Civilized and Barbarian 

New knowledge of world geography thus helped Japanese thinkers overcome Chinese Confucian standards of value by ex- posing these to be devoid of reality. Keisai delivered two more blows against Sinocentric civilization: a new view of interna- tional relations and a historical critique of the concept of Mid- dle Kingdom Civilization. The first was directed against Japanese Confucians like Jinsai, who, despite claiming that Japan was superior, acknowledged that China embodied civilization while Japan was barbarian. In so doing, Keisai began to shed the tradi- tional Confucian conception of the world as "all under Heaven" and an ideally unified empire, and to grope toward a more modern view of the world comprised of numerous independent "lands." 

Heaven envelops the earth; no matter where one travels upon it, there is no place that Heaven does not cover. Thus every land (tochi) is defined by the extent to which its customs pre- vail. Each is a full-fledged realm in itself, and none is more noble or base than any other.41 

Here Keisai introduces a significant new conception of tenka, "the realm." Each land is a "full-fledged realm" in itself.42 Each is marked off from other lands by its own distinctive customs or culture, and boasts a position equal to all others. Contemporary China (Kara) is but one of these lands, characterized by cultural distinctiveness: 

That portion of the land of China called the Nine Provinces has been cultured in manners and natural endowment (ch'i) ever since high antiquity. It has maintained similar customs and a common language. Hence it naturally forms a realm of its own. 

43 

Keisai's second attack, related to his first blow at Japanese Confucians who mistook China for civilization itself, was his claim that such thinkers failed to place the dichotomy of civi- lization and barbarism in proper historical perspective. As for ancient China's relations with surrounding territories and peo- ples, Keisai wrote: 

32 

99 

The Rise of Kokugaku 

From the Chinese point of view, those areas where customs were unlike China's were "countries of strange shapes and ways. 

Areas closer to the Nine Provinces, where one could make himself understood [through written Chinese], looked like "peripheral lands." Thus they have come to call their Nine Provinces "Middle Kingdom Civilization" (Chugoku), and surrounding areas, "barbarian."44 

But, Keisai claimed, it was wrong to gloss over these historical facts and extend the barbarian label to other countries, least of all Japan. Moreover, Japanese Confucians ignored cultural or ethnic variations within the China of later eras. The historical boundaries of China as a designation for civilization, Keisai asserted, had never been fixed. 

Areas such as Wu or Ch'u were barbarian in antiquity, and were so designated in works like Mencius or the Spring and Autumn Annals. .. But by the end of Chou times these areas were gradually prospering and rivaled China proper (Kara). And from Ch'in and Han onward, they have clearly been part of China proper.45 

Some of China's later capitals were located in formerly bar- barian areas. Chu Hsi, who was considered the paragon of Chi- nese Confucian orthodoxy, hailed from a province that was part of the barbarian state of Wu in antiquity.46 Keisai noted that China had expanded gradually during history, incorporating contiguous peoples and areas. At present, the Chinese thought of Chugoku as "all areas under their emperor's unified rule," or "the extent to which the inhabitants' customs have been Sini- fied."47 But even so, Keisai pointed out, "the land (kuni) of the Three Miao Tribes" and other lands inhabited by ethnic minor- ities "still are considered barbarian despite being included with- in" China proper. 

To clear up the confusion about which countries were civilized and which barbarian, Keisai advocated eliminating these Sino- centric categories entirely. Instead, he suggested substituting the terms "our land" (waga kuni) for one's own land and 

33 

Civilized and Barbarian 

"foreign lands" (ikoku) for all other countries.49 Every nation then could use these value-free designations toward all other na- tions. What is more, the inhabitants of each waga kuni should consider it primary, though of course peoples in all other lands would consider it secondary. 50 This would skirt the problem of cultural superiority or inferiority built into the Sinocentric terms, Middle Kingdom and barbarian, and it would make each country equal to all others. 

For Keisai, as for Jinsai, Shun, the ancient Chinese ruler, was the ideal sage for Japanese Confucians to emulate, though for different reasons. In Jinsai's mind, Shun was an ethnic barbarian who overcame his alien birth and achieved sagehood. For Keisai, Shun's single-hearted devotion to his perverse father, an unalter- able blood relationship, constituted sageliness and indicated the Way for Japanese Confucians to follow. Shun's fate was to have been born the son of an evil man, but his "self-evident duty" lay in assiduous filial devotion to such a father. 51 By the same token, Japanese Confucians could not help having been born in a land "of eastern barbarians" which had never produced a sage (as Sorai lamented), 52 or whose cultural refinement did not match China's. But this should cause them no despair. Through wholehearted devotion to the land of their birth, they too could attain moral excellence. 

Despite this attempt to shed the Sinocentric categories of civi- lization and barbarism, Keisai was still committed to Confucian moral culture. His model was, after all, the Confucian sage Shun, and the exemplars in his writings were Chinese loyalists. The Kimon School, in which he was a leading figure, espoused Confucian-Shinto syncretism in which Chu Hsi's teachings sup- posedly corresponded "by coincidence" to those of Shinto. This insistence on "coincidental correspondence" (myōkei) may seem like quibbling, but to Keisei, it was immensely significant. Members of the Kimon School prided themselves on being inde- pendent from the syncretism of Hayashi Razan, who identified Japan's Way of the kami with the Confucian Way in more Pro- crustean fashion. Keisai asserted that a universal corpus of nor- mative culture known as the Way, revealed in concepts like 

24 

The Rise of Kokugaku 

moral principle (li) and the Five Elements, had grown up coincidentally in both Japan and China; so neither country was superior. Both Ways, though in essence identical, found separate expression in the Chinese and Japanese classics. "The Book of Changes is a 'Chronicle of the Gods' [in Kojiki and Nihon shoki] for China just as "The Chronicle of the Gods' is a Book of Changes for Japan."53 

There was a logical inconsistency in Kimon-School pluralism. Keisai would have each particular "land" possess its own cus- toms, culture, and moral values to which its inhabitants must remain true. Yet at the same time, he professed a universal Way valid in all times and places. Kokugakusha, or scholars of Native Learning such as Motoori Norinaga (1730-1801), strove to eliminate this logical inconsistency by basing all value judgments on purely indigenous criteria. 

Norinaga vehemently rebuked Japanese Confucians who used Sinocentric ideals of moral, civilized behavior to disparage Japan. One such Confucian, Dazai Shundai (1680-1747), chas- tised the ancient Japanese for their custom of half-brother-half- sister marriages: this violated the Confucian taboo on incest between persons of the same surname. Shundai therefore con- demned the ancient Japanese as living like the "birds and beasts. Not until the Confucian classics reached Japan, he charged, did his countrymen learn proper moral behavior. At the same time, Norinaga was no less critical of Japanese apolo- gists like Toba Gi (Yoshiaki), who justified this ancient custom in light of extenuating circumstances. 55 Norinaga's view was: 

54 

Japanese intellectuals consider this ancient practice a disagree- able defect of our Divine Land, so they appeal to this or that cleverly contrived theory hoping to cover it up or explain it away. Yet none has come up with a convincing argument be- cause they are all set on servile fawning toward China. If not, it would not matter that we differ from China. 56 

Norinaga vigorously opposed this type of Confucian monism and advocated pluralism in cultural and moral standards: 

Civilized and Barbarian 

China (Morokoshi) is China; our Imperial Land (Mikuni) is our Imperial Land. Today is today; the past is the past. Con- fucians who judge affairs based solely on the standard of Chi- nese customs, and contemporaries who denigrate [ancient] practices based solely on present-day customs, are not being fair. 57 

This was not just an attempt to relativize normative Sinocen- tric culture. Norinaga examined Japanese customs and morals with the empathy of what we now call "historical understand- ing." Past periods of history, like different nations, were distinct cultural units that must be judged according to their own par- ticular standards. In Man'yoshu days, half-brothers and half- sisters married, and in the Heian times of Genji monogatari, men visited and married into the households of women. But such seemingly immoral customs were right and proper in those periods. It was improper for contemporaries to condemn those practices based on alien or present-day standards of right and wrong. 

In Norinaga's Kokugaku, discovering and clarifying the origi- nal meaning of Japan's classics was the only proper form of scholarship and correct method of understanding Japan's own unique Way. In one of his most vituperative attacks on Japa- nese Confucians (like Jinsai and Soko) and Confucian-Shinto syncretists (like Ansai and Keisai), Norinaga wrote: 

They envy China (Karakuni) for its supposed possession of the Way, and bend over backwards arguing that precisely the the same Way exists in Japan as well. This is just like the man who, after being teased by a bunch of monkeys for his lack of body hair, feels ashamed. He searches frantically for any of the thinnest hairs he can find on his body, proudly points to these, and says, "See, I've got hair too." Are they not dimwits who fail to see that the lack of body hair is more to be esteemed?58 

Japanese Confucians, Norinaga held, based all value-judgments on putatively timeless and universal normative concepts (such as yin-yang, li, the Five Elements, or the Five Constant Virtues). 

36 

The Rise of Kokugaku 

They assumed that these norms had to find expression in Japan's ancient classics as well as in China's, so they "bent over back- wards" to read those alien norms into the Japanese texts. (The Kojiki story of Izanagi and Izanami, for example, became a "parable" or "allegory" said to symbolize the distinction between male and female that Confucians valued.) 59 

But the above quotation discloses far more. Norinaga repudi- ated all Japanese claims to cultural and moral superiority over China that were based on imported Sinocentric criteria. He in- sisted that the Chinese sages-especially the Duke of Chou-were not paragons of morality. After overthrowing the Shang dynasty and usurping the throne, they deceitfully invented moral norms like the Heavenly Mandate, virtue, and the Way to justify their perfidy and to protect themselves against similar uprisings by their subjects in the future. 60 Using an argument similar to one employed by Chinese Taoists, 61 Norinaga argued that Chinese Confucians felt a special need to enunciate repeatedly or espouse emphatically moral norms like the Way, righteousness, or the rules of ethical behavior, because they did not truly practice those virtues. In ancient Japan, by contrast, people felt no special need to enunciate moral norms or rules of ethical be- havior because their conduct was naturally good. 63 

In short, the Chinese invented and espoused normative con- cepts like the Way or the loyalty of subject for ruler. But in point of historical fact, they overthrew their ruling dynasties more than twenty times. The ancient Japanese had lacked such moral concepts, but thanks to their innate goodness, they revered one ruling house throughout all time. That is why lack- ing a normative Way, like the absence of body hair, was "more to be esteemed." 

Norinaga's arguments to claim Japan's superiority over China were just as far-fetched as Ito Jinsai's, but the crucial difference between their rationales is quite clear. Jinsai attributed the im- perial line's longevity, and Japan's superiority, to the presence of Confucian virtues; Norinaga, to their absence. Norinaga held that "men know all they need to know about the rules of ethi- cal behavior naturally, through the spirit of the deities. They have no need of moral teachings."64 Confucian moral precepts 

37 

Civilized and Barbarian 

were not the "good teachings" Mencius said they were: In truth they despoiled men of goodness. Edification or the transforma- tion of a people's customs signified nothing beneficial. Neither the geographic extensiveness of Sinocentric moral culture nor its widespread acceptance by people within China proved its ex- cellence. Norinaga wrote: 

The fact that the Chinese masses revere the sages as they revere Heaven is because they have been deceived by those sages, not because the sages were truly honorable. If we assume that being revered by many people is tantamount to true moral ex- cellence, what do we make of Shinran? Present-day followers of the Ikkō Sect, who revere him as its founder, are far more numerous than the [Chinese] Confucians who revere their sages. But does this prove that Shinran's virtue is greater than that of the sages?65 

Shinran, the Chinese sages, and Christians66 were deceivers, pure and simple. Norinaga denounced them for the falseness of their views but he did not fear them. Unlike Confucians such as Aizawa, he did not equate the widespread acceptance of a par- ticular teaching with its moral and cultural superiority. One final example, dealing with world geography, should demon- strate this point. 

From 1786 to 1787, Norinaga and another prominent scholar of Native Learning, Ueda Akinari (1734-1809), debated fiercely about (among other things) the world as depicted on Dutch maps. Akinari turned to the Dutch "map of the globe"67 and 

said: 

Only a few countries use and understand ideographs; the rest have strange names we have never heard of, and many of them are vast in size. When we try to pick out our Divine Land, we see that it is but a tiny island, a single leaf floating on the sur- face of a wide pond. 68 

To which Norinaga replied: 

38 

How funny it is that you view this world map with such curiosity. In this day and age, has anyone not seen such maps? 

The Rise of Kokugaku 

Does anyone not know that our Divine Realm is not very ex- tensive? The nobility or baseness, beauty or ugliness, of a thing does not hinge only on whether it is large or small... An inferior nation, even if large, is still inferior; our superior land, even though small, is still superior. 69 

Norinaga listed these reasons for Japan's superiority despite being small: (1) Being the land where the Sun Goddess was born, Japan was the fountainhead of all other nations. (2) Japan's imperial line was unbroken since the beginning of time. (3) Japan possessed the only classics containing the gods' true reve- lations. (4) Japan produced the world's best rice. (5) Japan had never been conquered by foreign powers. 

70 

Western Learning did not directly challenge any of these Kokugaku "reasons" for Japanese superiority. But all of them hinged on unquestioning belief in the literal truth of Japan's oldest classical text, the Kojiki, where they supposedly were re- vealed. And Western knowledge did challenge this credulity. Norinaga recognized value in Dutch Studies because it awakened Japanese thinkers to the error of "slavish adherence to Chinese ways and values."71 He also echoed the views of many Japanese about Chinese Confucianism and Dutch Studies in the late eigh- teenth century: 

By learning about world affairs one ought to realize the excel- lence of our Divine Realm. But they [the Rangakusha] refuse to revere our Divine Realm because they believe slavish adher- ence to Chinese ways and values is bad. This makes them think that slavish adherence to anything is wrong. So they place ultimate value in slavishly adhering to this attitude of rejecting slavish adherence. 72 

Norinaga affirmed the Rangakusha's stubborn skepticism and refusal to commit themselves wholeheartedly to China. But he would not tolerate such attitudes toward Japan. 

Kokugaku was by far the most influential movement in eigh- teenth-century Japanese thought. After Norinaga, Tokugawa thinkers might profess respect for Chinese or Western civiliza- tion, but not to the extent of national self-effacement in the 

39 

Civilized and Barbarian 

manner of "Sorai, the eastern barbarian." " From the late eigh- teenth century onward, for better or worse, "the Japanese spirit" (wakon) would be supreme, would have to be lauded for its own sake. Only then might thinkers supplement it with Chi- nese or Western "learning" (kansai, yōsai). In 1807, for exam- ple, the Dutch Studies expert Ōtsuki Gentaku wrote: 

Japan is a small land compared with others, but she is an empire whose ruling imperial house has remained intact throughout the myriad ages. This is why Japan is superior to other countries, and why they revere and stand in awe of her....74 

An understanding of eighteenth-century intellectual develop- ments just presented is needed to place Dutch Studies and West- ern Learning in balanced historical context. Students of Western and world affairs played a decisive role in formulating a modern conception of Japan in the international order. But their achieve- ment was possible only because the Sinocentric Middle Kingdom world view already had been largely relativized and repudiated. We shall now see how two Dutch Studies experts, Sugita Gem- paku and Maeno Ryōtaku, rejected Chinese claims to cultural and moral excellence, and how one of them, Ryōtaku, took the label of superiority off of China and applied it to the West. 

THE EXCELLENCE OF WESTERN BARBARIANS 

Sugita Gempaku (1733-1817) and Maeno Ryōtaku (1723-1803) were domain doctors of Dutch medicine, but their basic values and world view were unmistakably Confucian. Ryōtaku began studying Dutch in 1770 at the age of 47, Sugita, one year later, at the age of 39. Sugita seems mainly to have read Dutch books on his specialty, medicine. Ryōtaku, as his writings show, in- formed himself about far more Western subjects. But as we shall see, certain tenets central to their Confucian philosophy made their reaction to Western Learning decisively different from that of Kokugakusha such as Norinaga. 

In 1775, one year after he helped complete the translation of the Dutch anatomical text Ontleedkundige Tafelen, Sugita 

40Excellence of Western Barbarians 

wrote Words of a Fanatic Doctor (Kyōi no gen). The title is of no small significance. Sugita portrayed himself as "fanatic" in his desire to sally forth to do battle with the forces of Tokugawa medical obscurantism. He compared his zeal to that of Po-i and Shu-ch'i of the fallen Shang dynasty, who refused to serve the victorious Chou dynasty, vowing to die rather than submit. 75 Sugita had two objectives in composing this work. First, he sought to assimilate advanced Western medical techniques, demonstrably superior to those of China, through the time- honored Confucian method of canonical sanction. Second, he relativized (but did not totally repudiate) Sinocentric civiliza- tion through arguments similar to those advanced by Jinsai, Keisai, and Norinaga. 

Words of a Fanatic Doctor is a dialogue between Sugita, the fanatic doctor, and a sympathetic friend who urges him to aban- don his infatuation with Western surgery and return to the Way of Chinese medicine. The tract begins with a vitriolic denuncia- tion of Sugita by a third character, a doctor of Chinese medicine steeped in Confucian prejudices. The author, Sugita, carefully differentiates the term "Chuka," Middle Kingdom Civilization, from "Shina," a neutral designation for China, without conno- tations of moral and cultural superiority. The bigoted doctor of Chinese medicine and Sugita's friend use "Chūka," but Sugita himself uses "Shina" to show his less approving view of China. 76 

The doctor of Chinese medicine bases his arguments on Sino- centric criteria long discredited by Keisai and Norinaga: "Coun- tries like Korea or the Ryūkyūs (and by logical extension, Japan) are not far removed from Middle Kingdom Civiliza- tion," 77 since they had adopted the classical Chinese language and Confucian culture. The doctor's grounds for asserting Ja- pan's excellence are identical to Jinsai's: faithfully embodying aspects of a superior Sinocentric civilization. Japan is culturally and geographically closer to China's Middle Kingdom Civiliza- tion; thus it is far less barbarian than Holland. Unlike the Japa- nese, the Dutch do not read classical Chinese and have not heard the sages' teachings. Holland "is located in the remotest area of any dwelt in by the barbarians; its customs are utterly different [from those of the Middle Kingdom]." 

78 

41 

Civilized and Barbarian 

Having thus vented his spleen, the prejudiced doctor of Chi- nese medicine left. We should note that his arguments were anachronistic even by Confucian standards in the eighteenth century. It is easy to imagine why Sugita endowed him with so combative an attitude: Men of the doctor's stripe were be- leaguered not only by students of Dutch Learning, but also by Kokugakusha and Confucian-Shinto syncretists. 

79 

In contrast to Jinsai, who viewed Japan as barbarian, and Kei- sai or Norinaga, who scarcely mentioned Westerners, Sugita's doctor of Chinese medicine in 1775 vehemently denigrated the Dutch as barbarian. As Satō Shōsuke argues, only with the rise of Rangaku did intense animosity against Western knowledge, as distinct from Christianity, appear. People most threatened by the new learning were among the first to lash out at it. Sugita's detractor was a doctor of Chinese medicine, not a scholar of Confucianism itself. His value to society lay in an ability to dispense Chinese technical skills, but Western science discredited them. With his personal worth thus impugned, he could only fall back on Chinese moral culture, but Kokugakusha like Norinaga denied its validity. At that point, the merits of Sinocentric culture could be rescued only by infusing it with native Japanese elements, the goal of Confucians like Keisai and Aizawa. We should keep these points in mind when reading the following passage: 

In China (Shina), they have already realized that traditional methods of astronomy, calendar-making, and the various arts and crafts are in error. Since late Ming times they have been studying many Western (seiyo) methods. . . . For example, the globes they now rely on are far different from those of antiquity. This shows that they adopt what is good from the West and abide by these [superior methods]. It is only our own Japanese doctors of Chinese medicine who cling to out- dated practices. How sad indeed! 80 (emphasis added) 

Sugita did not belittle Shina, or contemporary China, in all respects. Here he praises the Ming and Ch'ing Chinese for appre- ciating and adopting advanced Western technical skills in con- trast to unregenerate Japanese doctors of Chinese medicine. 

42 

Excellence of Western Barbarians 

Even in China, homeland of Middle Kingdom Civilization, Con- fucians had sense enough to import the best from the West; Toku- gawa Confucians ought to follow suit. Sugita did not disparage Confucianism itself. He only attacked Confucians who "cling to outdated practices," and he provided the following rationale for assimilating demonstrably superior Western techniques. 

The sage kings of ancient China (Shina) did, it is true, "edify the people by 'differentiating' Middle Kingdom Civilization from barbarism." But to Sugita, this did not mean esteeming the former and despising the latter unconditionally. Some peo- ples had strong customs, in the sense of being impervious to acculturation; other peoples' customs were weak and easily altered. The sage kings, in their sagacity, knew that Chinese customs were of the weak sort. Hence: 

It was to prevent Chinese customs from becoming indistin- guishable from those of the barbarians that they established proper rules of ritual behavior, esteemed Middle Kingdom Civilization, and despised barbarism.81 

The sages' bias against barbarians was functional, not absolute. They differentiated their own Middle Kingdom Civilization from barbarism only "to protect their people with a barrier." In this connection, Sugita, like Jinsai nearly a century earlier, cited Kuan Chung's act of cultural joi: "Confucius said, 'If not for Kuan Chung, we would be wearing our hair down and fold- ing our robes to the left.' Thus he praised Kuan Chung's great achievement." 

But such efforts to "build barriers" and prevent the transfor- mation of Chinese customs to those of the barbarians proved futile: 

From Ch'in times onward, after the Way of Hsia, Shang, and Chou had declined, China's borders were violated by the northern barbarians. The First Ch'in Emperor [like the an- cient sages] realized the weakness of his people's customs and built the Great Wall. After Han times, the Chinese could not prevail against the northern barbarians. . . . In the Yuan and Ch'ing periods, the entire country became Tungusland. . . . 

43 

Civilized and Barbarian 

Now, a little over one hundred years after K'ang-hsi made the country strong and prosperous, the Thirteen Provinces of China and all its myriad people wear barbarian dress and are fettered by barbarians. But not one of them feels any shame. The weakness of their customs makes them thus. 83 

The Chinese sages sought to eradicate what is barbarian in order to prevent their people's customs from being transformed. But this did not preclude assimilating advanced barbarian techniques. There is a seeming contradiction here, at least from a traditional Confucian standpoint. Would not customs be transformed and the people made barbaric by adopting these barbarian tech- niques? No, says Sugita, because Chinese moral culture is not the only form of civilized life: 

Hidebound Confucians and run-of-the-mill doctors of Chinese medicine don't know how large the world is. Having heard about two or three countries in the East (Tōyō), they think that China (Shina) is the greatest of all nations.. They charge that the barbarians' customs lack rules of ethical behavior, 84 

Thus far Sugita seems merely to be repeating hackneyed argu- ments to claim Japan's superiority over China by relativizing the Sinocentric Middle Kingdom world view. But his method of relativization differs from Keisai's or Norinaga's: 

Ritual, music, and the other accoutrements of civilization exist to maintain the statuses of noble and base. Does any country lack statuses of noble and base? Does any country lack ritual and music? Confucius said, "[Even] the barbarians have a ruler." To have a ruler and honor him is [the essence of] ritual. 85 

Sugita, like Jinsai, followed Chu Hsi's intepretation of this Ana- lects passage. But for Sugita, the barbarians were the Dutch, not the Japanese. He universalized the concept of ritual, or the rules of ethical behavior, by making it, like the differentiation of civilization from barbarism, functional rather than absolute. The function of ritual, music, and the other accoutrements of 

44 

Excellence of Western Barbarians 

civilization was to distinguish noble from base, and this distinc- tion obtained in every nation of the world. Therefore the ritual, music, and accoutrements of civilization in all nations possessed equal value. Ch'ing China had no monopoly on this value; Chi- nese civilization was not world civilization. 

Sugita went on to relativize the Way itself, which he defined as "leaving evil behind and progressing to goodness. 

"86 This Way found embodiment in "customs" that differ according to the area in which one lived; Dutch customs were fully compatible with it: 

The Way is not something established by the sages of China (Shina). It is the [universal] Way of Heaven and Earth. Where- ever sun and moon shine, wherever dew and frost form, there are nations, there are people, and there is the Way.8 

Chinese customs represented but one form of this universal Way; any attempt to force those customs on the inhabitants of different climates would seriously harm their health. 88 

Sugita's most devastating attack on the Sinocentric Middle Kingdom world view, however, resembled Norinaga's: accusing China's ancient medical sages of moral duplicity. Sugita defined sageliness as "wisdom, caring for people's lives, and refusing to deceive them."89 Yet, argued Sugita, Chinese medical texts attributed to the sages were based on speculation and forced metaphysical analogies to yin-yang, the Five Elements, and similar vacuous theories. They were proved false when compared with accurate Western anatomical drawings. To treat patients according to such faulty Chinese texts and medical practices was to fail "to care for people's lives"; it was, in fact, "to de- ceive them." Only Dutch medical texts and techniques, con- firmed to be true and accurate, allowed one to fulfill the requirements of sagehood. 

There was a clear limit to Sugita's championing of the Dutch cause, however. In Keiei yawa (1802), he asserted, "I discovered the true principles of medicine to exist in far-off Holland."90 However, in his Preface to Kaitai shinsho, the translation of Ontleedkundige Tafelen, he noted that the word "dissection" (kaibo) had appeared in an ancient Chinese medical text, and from this he concluded: 

45 

Civilized and Barbarian 

The Chinese (Karahito) must have possessed this method [dissection] in antiquity, but men in later ages did not receive it. They now futilely place their faith in worthless practitioners of medicine and spew forth groundless theories. Thus, for thousands of years since antiquity we have remained ignorant of this method's true nature. Ah, how sad indeed! 91 

Here Sugita emphasizes that dissection was known in ancient China but subsequently disappeared. This idea of a Way lost in China and Japan since antiquity but discovered thereafter in the West was an important concept for Aizawa, as we shall see. The 92 and above passage underscores Sugita's antiquarian leanings, shows the limits of his antipathy to Confucianism. 

Sugita proclaimed Dutch moral superiority over the Chinese sages in Kyōi no gen, but a perusal of his other works, particu- larly Yasō dokugo (1807) and Nochimigusa (1787), shows that he did not repudiate Confucianism in general. For example, he began Yasō dokugo by citing twenty-two irregularities in natural phenomena and other recent inauspicious omens. Then he stated, "These are all warnings from Heaven that men should reform morally."93 This way of thinking is reminiscent of Chi- nese Han dynasty Confucianism and suggests intellectual debts to it.94 We should also note that he composed Kyōi no gen in classical Chinese, and that it was exceptional among his writings in criticizing the sages. Sugita, then, retained considerable re- spect for Sinocentric civilization. 95 How should we interpret these seeming inconsistencies in his thought? 

Sugita repudiated Confucian moral culture in order to assimi- late superior Western medical techniques-and for that purpose only. In his mind, these techniques could be appropriated and utilized without disrupting traditional ways of thought or exist- ing socio-political institutions. Maeno Ryōtaku's study of things Western, by contrast, would show that such assimilation might entail repudiating the established political order. 

Maeno Ryōtaku (1723-1803) took up Dutch Studies for dif- ferent reasons and out of different interests. In The Beginnings of Dutch Studies (Rangaku kotohajime), Sugita noted: "Ryō- taku, due to his outstanding talents, wanted to make Rangaku 

AC 

Excellence of Western Barbarians 

his life's work, to attain a full mastery over Dutch, and thereby learn about conditions in the West. His great ambition was to acquire the ability to read all their books."96 Maeno read much more widely about Western subjects than Sugita; he avidly learned about "conditions in the West" and compared Tokugawa institutions unfavorably with what he discovered. Maeno prob- ably did more than anyone else to establish systematic instruc- tion in the Dutch language during the mid-Edo period. 97 His numerous works consisted mainly of Dutch primers and transla- tions on a wide variety of subjects, including medicine, natural science, and geography. But only one of these works, Kanrei higen (1777), informs us of his thought. 98 

In Kanrei higen (Comments on narrow-mindedness to be kept secret), Maeno rejected the Chinese Five Elements theory, tradi- tional cosmology, and the Confucian view of nature. In their place he advanced the Aristotelian idea of four elements and other theories of Western science. What concerns us, however, is his idealistic portrayal of Western conditions and the unfavor- able implications this had for Sinocentric moral culture. Maeno equated superior Western achievements in Naturkunde or natu- ral science, 99 with a superior morality. 100 The essence of Natur- kunde, Maeno assumed, was kyuri, or "investigating Principle exhaustively."101 But at the same time: 

Through Naturkunde they revere Heaven, honor the deities, conduct government, seek out the truth, become conversant with affairs and proficient in techniques, correct [defective] goods, and make effective use of tools. Thus, their emperors (teio) disseminate virtuous teachings, their princes maintain the state, their people are secure in their livelihoods, and their arts and crafts attain perfection. Their sphere of moral suasion must truly be vast! 102 (emphasis added) 

As a Confucian, Maeno linked learning and government to geographical extensiveness: Virtuous European rulers imple- mented superior Western knowledge in political administration, and this necessarily extended their sphere of moral suasion. From an important non-Dutch author, Matteo Ricci, Maeno learned of the constant strife characterizing Ming China before 

47 

Civilized and Barbarian 

the Manchu takeover. Echoing Norinaga he wrote, "From the Shang and Chou down to the Ming, they have overthrown more than twenty dynasties." 103 But in contrast, he noted: 

In European states, no one has ever succeeded in becoming the ruler of a nation (tenka kokka) through violent usurpa- tion. Since they have never had a haughty and unprincipled Chieh or Chou on the throne, they never had a treacherous overthrower like T'ang or Wu. 

Because Ming leaders failed to heed Matteo Ricci's remonstrances to reform, Maeno believed, their dynasty fell to the Manchus. 105 By introducing and contrasting European methods of succes- sion and of selecting state officials with Chinese or Japanese methods, Maeno implied Western superiority: 

In Europe, Italy [i.e., the Vatican] is sovereign in matters of moral transformation.... Responsibility for government is delegated to priest-officials, of whom there are seventy-two. When the king dies, each noble and commoner writes on a secret ballot the name of that priest-official who he believes has enough virtue to be a worthy successor. The minister who gets the most recommendations accedes to the throne. This method is used to select the priest-officials as well. 106 

This was not only true in "Italy": "European countries in gen- eral use this method to select successors to the throne when heirs are lacking or to fill vacancies among priest-officials. They show no favoritism in choosing an heir or granting office." 107 In addition to the election system, Maeno discovered an important form of Western rule: the unity of government and religion, conducted by state officials invested with religious authority. This authority derived from a head of state whose sovereign powers were spiritual rather than political. As we shall see, this idea of the unity of government and religion assumed great sig- nificance in Mito Learning. 

We must also understand Maeno's knowledge of world geog- raphy and the Western moral superiority he extrapolated from it. He stated that Europeans formerly believed that the three continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa made up the entire 

48 

Excellence of Western Barbarians 

world, 108 

However, "in the second year of Meio [1493], an Ital- ian named Columbus set off to prove that there was yet another continent in the Western sea." Maeno believed that Columbus was a "savior of other lands," a missionary of impeccable moral standing. After discovering the New World, he and other Euro- peans, such as Magellan and Amerigo Vespucci, founded many colonies there. For Maeno, the known world had expanded to include two new continents, North and South America. ("Cen- trality" by this time had long ceased to be an issue.) 109 

Unlike Kokugaku scholars, the Confucian Maeno logically attributed European geographic extensiveness to the efficacy of European kyōhō, or religion. 110 First he noted the basic similar- ity between Confucianism and other "teachings" (oshie or kyo): 

Christianity (tenshukyo), the state religion (kokkyō) of Hol- land, and the teaching (oshie) of Africa... all have the same aim: to save and nurture widowers, widows, orphans, single persons, the sick and disabled, and the destitute and suffering, and to base edification and government on this policy. (emphasis added) 

111 

This passage is pregnant with meaning: In it Maeno anticipated Aizawa on several points. First, Maeno propounded the basic universality of all religious "teachings." Second, he stated that their essence is to care for the needy and helpless in society. Third, he held that implementing such teachings is, or should be, the responsibility of the ruler; religion is inseparable from government. Fourth, Holland had established its own state religion: 

Holland is the only nation [in Europe] that excludes the reli- gion (hō) of other lands and has established [its own] separate religion. Many of its colonies such as New Holland in North America, Jakarta and Australia in Asia, and Magellanica, also believe in this religion. North and South America were originally frontier areas developed by Europeans, who rule over the various lands located there. The natives revere the Europeans as sage-rulers (shinsei). How much more so do most of them adhere to European religions.

We should note one more point about Maeno's universalistic view of religions: 

When ancient sage kings (senno) established teachings and brought men under moral transformation, there were bound to be variations according to time and place. But even so, when we examine the consequences of those teachings-order or rebellion, prosperity or decline-and when we appraise the geographic extent to which these teachings and moral suasion spread-near or far, narrowly or broadly-it seems that these two outcomes depend on whether the teachings had been established well or poorly. 114 

Maeno did not express himself as lucidly as we might wish, but he sought to convey the following ideas. Whether a nation enjoys peace and orderly rule or suffers anarchy and demise depends on the quality of the religious teachings that its ancient sage kings had established. The "good teachings" Mencius talked about would gain widespread reverence, but poor teachings would win acceptance only in a limited area if at all. As we noted, Maeno disparaged China for its frequent dynastic changes, and on this point he did not differ from Keisai or Norinaga. Un- like them, however, he praised European nations, not Japan, for never having overthrown a ruling dynasty.115 To Maeno, every country-not China alone-had had "ancient sage kings." And China's frequent dynastic turnovers reflected a lack of domestic order stemming from the poor teachings that the Chinese sages had established. 

To Maeno, the religious teaching of the Western sages was best; that Christianity had spread over far more of the globe than any other teaching proved this. 116 Better knowledge of world geography and demography broke down the Sinocentric Middle Kingdom world view held by Japanese Confucians: "Buddhism has spread over one-fifth of Asia, Confucianism, one- tenth of Asia. Christianity dominates the rest of the world."117 People inhabiting but one-tenth of one of the world's five con- tinents believed in Confucianism; Christianity had transformed all other nations. Confucian norms of excellence were unlike 

50The Mito Synthesis 

the particularistic criteria Norinaga set up to claim Japanese superiority. Middle Kingdom Civilization, whether represented by China or Japan, held universal pretensions. Widespread non- acceptance over the globe had to discredit the Confucian Way and Sinocentric culture in Maeno's eyes. 

Maeno refrained from publishing Kanrei higen for fear of in- curring bakufu displeasure, explaining, "To extol the customs of foreign lands surely violates bakufu law."118 Nevertheless, this manuscript circulated privately among doctors, translators, and technical experts serving bakufu and daimyo domains. 119 Although it is difficult to gauge the direct impact of his ideas on Tokugawa thinkers, we know for certain that men like Fujita Yūkoku and Aizawa Seishisai were familiar with Maeno's work. 120 They took over his sympathetic views of the West and used these for their own purposes-creating an ideology of hatred to shore up the bakuhan order. 

THE MITO SYNTHESIS: JAPAN AS MIDDLE KINGDOM 

By the late eighteenth century, the Sinocentric Middle Kingdom world view had been so relativized, or compromised to Japanese values and socio-political realities, that it was untenable. Radical refashioning through massive injections of Native Learning was needed to make it acceptable once more. Tokugawa thinkers had attacked this imported world view largely to retain a sense of pride in their own land. They welcomed Western Learning, particularly its superior techniques and knowledge of world geography, in part because it discredited Confucianism and Sino- centric civilization even further. The world no longer was a flat "all under Heaven"; it was a sphere, where Ming or Ch'ing China could not claim centrality and superiority. Customs and social mores in Japan and elsewhere, though different from those pre- scribed by Confucianism, possessed equal validity and worth. Some Tokugawa thinkers discovered that Christian teachings were more effective than, and therefore superior to, Confucian- ism in morally transforming barbarian peoples all over the globe. In general, Japanese Confucians-but not Kokugaku thinkers- 

51 

Civilized and Barbarian 

had to admit this when they looked at the world map, for Chris- tendom encompassed a territory far more vast than their puta- tively superior Middle Kingdom Civilization. 

Western Learning brought to light hard facts that could not be wished away; Mito Confucians like Fujita Yukoku and Aizawa Seishisai had to make radical adjustments in the Sinocentric Middle Kingdom world view in order to retain its cogency and their own sense of worth in society. Forced to admit the unreal- ness of Middle Kingdom Civilization on the horizontal-geographic plane, Yukoku and Aizawa reasserted all the more tenaciously its moral rightness for the vertical, socio-political hierarchy within Japan. In 1791, Yukoku wrote: 

How vital indeed it is to rectify names and adhere strictly to prescribed statuses within the realm, for names and statuses can no more be altered than can Heaven and Earth. [It is writ- ten,] "Heaven and Earth exist; hence ruler and subject exist. Ruler and subject exist; hence the high and low exist..." Unless the names of "ruler" and "subject" are rectified, the statuses of high and low will not be strictly adhered to. The noble will become the base and the base will become the noble, the exhalted and despised will lose their respective places in society, the strong will overpower the weak, the many will oppress the few, and the day of doom will be near at hand. 121 (emphasis added) 

Yukoku and Aizawa asserted that the Tokugawa hereditary status system and bakuhan state structure were part of nature, beyond men's power to alter. 122 This fit the needs of the Toku- gawa ruling class quite well, because it meant that its position was immutable. Whether Yūkoku and Aizawa actually believed this claim is doubtful. But they proclaimed that the statuses of high and low, rulers and subjects, must be "rectified," by which they meant unconditionally upheld. 

In the late eighteenth century, Yukoku's awareness that Euro- peans were spreading Christian teachings in the territories they colonized effected him profoundly. From Honda Toshiaki, Mamiya Rinzō, Mogami Tokunai, Kondo Juzo, Ohara Sakingo, and others, Yukoku learned of Russian proselytizing and

colonizing north of Japan. I discuss the information these men gave to Yukoku and Aizawa more fully in the next chapter. Here I note only that Maeno's vision of a Christian-dominated world inspired fears that Yukoku held for Japan. Yukoku made Middle Kingdom Civilization on the perpendicular socio-political order absolute because he was acutely aware of the danger stem- ming from contacts between Japanese commoners and Christian barbarians. In a letter dated the second month of 1797, he of- fered the following advice on defense measures to ward off Russian encroachments. Purely military countermeasures were "not practicable." 

First of all, since popular unity and integration (jinwa) have been lost, the four classes will scatter before the enemy. Should the Russian barbarians entice our stupid commoners (gumin) with their 

their wicked [Christian] teachings and sugar-sweet words, should they beguile them with lucrative benefits, [we will suffer the same fate as Chou, the wicked last ruler of the Shang dynasty:] "those in the front lines will turn their hal- berds on troops to the rear." It goes without saying that we will suffer this at the hands of stupid commoners, who are afflicted with hunger and cold, but perhaps also at the hands of those officials among us who seek personal gain in disre- gard of righteousness. All of this may be exaggerated, but still, the barbarians will advance like lightning by sea and land. If we remain oblivious to this threat, we can expect help from no quarter. 123 

Yukoku keenly perceived Japan's susceptibility to Russian in- cursion through religious conversion and economic inveigling. To understand his message fully, we must search out the locus classicus of his quoted phrase, "those in the front lines will turn their halberds on troops to the rear." This comes from the (spurious) "Successful Completion of the War" chapter of the Book of Documents, where King Wu's campaign to punish Chou, the wicked last ruler of the Shang dynasty, is decided: 

[The Shang] troops were as numerous as the trees in a forest, but none opposed us. Their troops in the front lines turned 

53 

Civilized and Barbarian 

their halberds on troops to the rear, attacked, and fled. The blood flow was enough to carry away their shields. Thus did we topple the Shang....124 

Yukoku feared that if barbarian armed forces appeared on Japa- nese soil, "stupid commoners" would not only fail to support domain leaders, they would join forces with the enemy. By implication, he put himself and the entire daimyo-samurai ruling establishment in the position of wicked King Chou, whose ne- glect of kingly duties created alienation among the commoners and led to the demise of the dynasty. 125 Japan's bakufu and do- main rulers must take heed. They must eliminate the hunger and deprivation afflicting "stupid commoners" so that collabora- tion with the enemy would not take place. Given social and economic conditions in eighteenth-century Mito domain, Yu- koku's allusion to mass defection causing the Shang demise was not far-fetched. As he himself reported, between 1726 and 1798 Mito's population dropped from 318,475 to 229,239 be- cause of starvation and flight. 126 

Yukoku argued that Japan's rulers had to win "popular unity and integration" (jinwa), which Mencius perceived as the true key to national strength. In waging war, Mencius held, favorable weather was not as important as topographical advantage, and topographical advantage was not as important as popular unity and integration. According to accounts by Maeno Ryōtaku and other informed students of Western affairs, European rulers somehow had managed to implement the Way in their domestic politics and thereby win voluntary support from their peoples. Yukoku realized that rulers in Japan had to do likewise. If not, barbarian takeover was inevitable. 

Joi, conceived of as sweeping away or eradicating what is cul- turally barbarian, was an attempt to build barriers between Japanese commoners and foreigners. Mito thinkers stressed the need to carry out internal reforms and conduct edification to make those commoners less susceptible to barbarian transfor- mation. But even more important in the minds of nineteenth- century Mito Confucians such as Aizawa was the use of brute force; military action assumed a new and important place 

54 

The Mito Synthesis 

alongside moral transformation in notions of how to eradicate what was barbarian. Aizawa glossed joi as follows: 

[Ieyasu] constantly exhorted men living in an age of orderly rule to remain prepared for [warfare and] upheaval. Should Japan be lax about military training in peacetime, she will in- vite foreign encroachment... 

[Ieyasu] warned that civil wars result in victory or defeat, prosperity or decline, only for daimyo houses. Defeat by a for- eign nation, however, would disgrace the entire country of Japan (Nihonkoku). For this reason, he strictly banned the evil Westerners from coming to Japan after he had discerned their wicked designs on our Divine Realm. Hidetada and Iemitsu carried on his policies. By the Kan'ei era [1624-44], they had annihilated the [Westerners], eliminated the source of their evil forever, and made foreign lands stand in awe of our na- tion's might. 127 (emphasis added) 

Aizawa here incorrectly asserts that the first three Tokugawa shoguns had instituted the policies of national isolation (dis- cussed in the next chapter) and indiscriminate armed expulsion of Westerners. Mito scholars portrayed Westerners as rapacious barbarians intent on capturing the hearts and minds of "stupid" Japanese commoners-so called because the scholars were con- vinced that commoners could be easily converted to Christianity and induced to forsake their rulers. Here the Confucian empha- sis on virtue and edification has disappeared. According to Aizawa, Ieyasu advocated that foreigners seeking to transform Middle Kingdom Civilization be eradicated by violent means. Aizawa applied the Middle Kingdom world view and the con- cept of joi directly to the nineteenth-century Tokugawa polity and its relations with foreign countries. He anachronistically attributed to Ieyasu a consciousness of Japan as a nation-state on the brink of war with Western nations. 

To Aizawa, the Tokugawa state was more than the sum of its constituent parts. The bakufu-led federation of daimyo domains that constituted Japan as a national unit represented civilization; Western countries were contemptible barbarian lands. Aizawa, unlike Jinsai, did not consider the civilized/barbarian dichotomy 

55 

Civilized and Barbarian 

mutually convertible: Japan might regress to barbarism if her commoners were transformed to Christianity, but Westerners could never advance to civilized status on a par with the Divine Realm. Japan must maintain her superiority over foreigners through military force; to suffer defeat would be an unbearable humiliation for all Japanese daimyo and samurai. 

But despite fears of transformation by Christianity, Aizawa, like Sugita, recognized the value of adopting advanced Western techniques to supplement Confucian moral culture. 128 In New Theses, he wrote: 

Small arms were first cast by the Western barbarians, but we in the Middle Kingdom (Chugoku) imported and refined these weapons so much that the Ming Chinese (Minhito) named "This shows them "Japanese guns," not "Barbarian guns. their deep respect for our ingenuity. Let us repeat this tour de force in the field of shipbuilding. 129 

He went on to say: 

The Russian khan, Peter, once traveled to Holland disguised as a carpenter to learn the art of building ships. This took place in the Genroku era [1688-1703], and there is little doubt that Russia began to possess huge warships and sophisticated navigating skills at that time. Even the barbarians heed this vital matter. How can we in the Middle Kingdom ignore it? 130 Throughout New Theses Aizawa would call Japan the "Middle Kingdom" or the "Divine Realm," but not out of cultural or intellectual complacence. In the above passages, not only does he insist on Japan's need to assimilate advanced Western tech- nology; he advocates emulating the leader of a less-advanced barbarian state who had done so. He points with pride to the praise Ming Chinese gave to Japan regarding its adoption of, and improvement on, Western technical expertise. Aizawa would af- firm Chinese moral culture, infuse it with elements of Kokugaku myth, and seek to reinforce it with superior Western techniques. Aizawa's greatest fear was that the bakufu might not be able to adopt and utilize the benefits of Western Learning without succumbing to the danger it posed-Christian subversion. Despite 

56 

The Mito Synthesis 

this fear, he argued that Edo leaders should assimilate from the West as much useful information as possible, particularly on "international affairs, firearms, and ship construction."131 There was nothing wrong with studying Western subjects as long as the bakufu monopolized the fruits of those labors: 

Some take pleasure in reading strange books written in far- off, foreign lands. Their activities do not need to be a crime against the Tokugawa ruling house (kokka). Quite the con- trary, if they placed the knowledge thus gained at bakufu dis- posal, their services would be of great value. 

132 

With the rise of Mito Learning in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, politically conscious Japanese came to regard bakufu and domain governments as constituting an ideally federated nation-state. They cast off the barbarian status they formerly had acknowledged toward China, and now claimed centrality and superiority throughout the world for Japan in her own right. Together with these radical changes in world view came a momentous revision of bakufu foreign policy. National isolation, upheld by the indiscriminate armed expulsion of Western ships, emerged in the era 1793 to 1825. The following chapter describes how Western Learning helped create this crucial political development.
