How could they not have known? Japanese sailed to Mexico in early 1600&amp;rsquo;s itself. Tokugawa era Japanese elite weren&amp;rsquo;t braindead kangers. The observations of these visitors to Europe, Goa, New Spain, &amp;amp; Philippines would play a role in Shogunate&amp;rsquo;s decision to extirpate Xtians &amp;amp; close Japan because those who went saw Japanese slaves being sold in Goa by Xtians, colonization of Philippines, New Spain helped along by padres.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://amitavghosh.com/goas-japanese-slaves/&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Goa’s Japanese slaves – Amitav Ghosh&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I met Daniel Botsman recently in New Haven, Connecticut. An Australian by origin, he is a scholar of Japanese history and teaches at Yale. When he heard of my connection with Goa he asked if I was aware that Goa’s population had once included a fair number of Japanese.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I suppose I should no longer be surprised by the ‘connectedness’ of the world, but I confess that I was astonished to hear this. Cosmopolitan as Goa is, I have seen no signs of a Japanese presence there.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Any large scale manufacturing in Korea will create exportable surplus since its domestic market is small. Rest was their ability to compete in export market..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Much of (Korea&amp;rsquo;s development) was emulation of wartime Japan &amp;amp; Manchukuo (where Park served) &amp;amp; helped along by postwar Japan. To begin with, he went to World Bank &amp;amp; asked them for a loan to get into steel making which was denied as SK had no &amp;ldquo;comparative adv&amp;rdquo;. When his first efforts came to nothing – he was turned down for World Bank and U.S. Exim Bank loans – he used personal connections in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
