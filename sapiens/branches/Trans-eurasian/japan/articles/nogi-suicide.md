In 1912, the Newspaper carried a vivid account of the Seppuku of the General Nogi Maresuke(1849 –1912) and his wife Shizuko.
The head of the Akasaka Police department said there were many false rumors about the Seppuku of Shogun Nogi and his wife,

> "Incorrect details regarding the Waripuku (Seppuku) of the Shogun Nogi at the eight o’clock in the evening on the 13th of September (the day of the Meiji Emperor’s funeral). For this reason I would like to tell the truth about what happened in his final moments.”

I have bore witness to many suicides however I have never before encountered such a Bushido-like taking of one’s life. All I can say is that it was exemplary in every way. The Shogun was found on the second floor of his home. He was sitting in Seiza with just his undershirt on. In bottom of his belly a Gunto or military sword had been stabbed in and pulled across his stomach from the left. The cut moved slightly upward to the right, 25cm and then rotated upward. He then cut up. It was magnificent in its accordance with the precepts laid down for Seppuku. From there he put the sword point on his windpipe and placed the handle on the tatami mat floor. He then threw his weight forward onto it and the sword tip extended tome 6 Sun or 19 centimeters out of the back of his neck. He was found partially slumped over.

Beside him was his wife in her full regalia. With a knife of some 7 Sun, 22 cm, in length she had cut open her windpipe with one slash and turned the knife around and placed it upon her heart. She then fell forward onto the knife with the hilt placed on the pillow before her. The blade stabbed through her heart and protruded out her back. The position she was found in showed that her knees had never moved. The scene of the two in their final movements caused those who laid eyes on it to straighten themselves up.
