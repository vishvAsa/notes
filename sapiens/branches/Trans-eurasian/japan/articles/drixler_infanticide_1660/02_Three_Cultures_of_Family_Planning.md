Sometime in the early eighteenth century, a merchant named Shinbei traveled toward the great shrine of Itsukushima near Hiroshima. One evening as he was settling down at an inn, another guest suddenly rushed out. Puzzled, Shinbei turned to a pilgrim at his side. Could it be that there were robbers among the travelers? “In the lodging that we share, an odious thing has happened,” the man explained. “Th

e rest of us are also thinking about moving out. Apparently, there is someone from Tosa among the pilgrims. We always hear that when people in Tosa do not want to raise a child, they kill it on the fl oor of its birth. Th e other guest fl ed 

because on a pilgrimage to a sacred site, it is disagreeable to share an inn with people from such a place.” As it turned out, Shinbei himself was the off ending man of Tosa. What the other pilgrims could not know was that true to the reputation of his home province on the Pacifi c coast of Shikoku, he had recently killed one of his newborn children. Taken aback, Shinbei asked whence the punctilious pilgrim hailed. “In our country of Izumo,” came the reply, “it has long been the custom that not raising a child is completely out of the question. Occasionally, if a woman without a husband conceives a child in iniquity, she will have a doctor perform an abortion. Such doctors are called ‘gynecologists’ \( *joishi*\) and people despise them 

\[to the point that they will scarcely suff er them\] to dwell even at the edge of their towns; even our nursery rhymes warn children that if you point your fi nger at the gate of a gynecologist, that fi nger will rot.”1

Also in the early eighteenth century, a similar clash of childrearing cultures took place in an inn at the other end of Japan. Like many of his fellow inhabitants of Etchū, a province at the heart of the Hokuriku region on the Japan Sea coast, Futsukaichiya Jirōemon made a modest living by peddling patent medicines in 25

distant parts of Japan. One evening in about 1720, he was staying in the Northeastern province of Mutsu when he saw the innkeeper carry his newborn child into the garden. Th

e anthology of meritorious deeds in which Jirōemon’s life is remembered describes the encounter as follows:

Jirōemon politely asked the innkeeper what he was doing. “I am returning the thing that was just born,” came the reply. In tears, Jirōemon clung to the sleeve of the landlord. “Killing a being that has been born is heartless\! Please raise the child\!” Th e 

landlord’s temper rose. Saying that the peddler was a bother, he was already about to strangle the child in the garden. Jirōemon now pulled him aside with single-minded determination. “Although I am not wealthy, it should not cost that much to have you raise this child for me; I will give you a little allowance to supplement the milk. Pray raise the child\!” So earnest were his words that even this landlord of pitiless local customs could no longer ignore what was right and reasonable. “If you go to such lengths, I will bring up the child. But it is the custom of this land that few people raise children other than an heir, and even if you are rich, raising too many children is to act against the order of things. But give me the milk allowance, and with it I will present the child to my neighbors. When I tell them that this is a child whose life has been saved by Jirōemon from Etchū, we can keep the child while also maintaining our social standing.”2

Neither story needs to be taken at face value, but both are telling beyond their overt claims. Th

e encounter near Hiroshima appears in a family chronicle written in Tosa by the great-grandson of Shinbei’s uncle. While we need not trust the details aft er two generations of possible embellishments, the account struck readers in the 1780s as plausible. One such reader was the lord of Tosa, Yamauchi Toyochika, who responded to the story with a lament that infanticide was disgrac-ing his domain.3 Th

e haggling scene in Mutsu comes from a compilation of local exemplars of virtue written in Etchū in 1807, and as such may be a better source on the view from Hokuriku in 1807 than on attitudes in Mutsu circa 1720. Again, however, the account must have seemed plausible enough to serve its edifying purpose for a local readership that had much fi rst-hand experience of life in Mutsu, some as peddlers, others as migrant laborers. In 1807, the view from Etchū 

would have included a certain amount of smugness. Domains and intendancies in several parts of Mutsu were then aggressively recruiting people from Hokuriku to resettle their depopulated villages. Th

e reason these governments turned to 

Hokuriku was in no small part its celebrated abhorrence of infanticide. 

Contemporary descriptions clearly imply that attitudes toward infanticide were regionally diverse in eighteenth-century Japan.4 Scores of scholars and travelogue writers named the provinces of Eastern Japan and parts of Kyushu, Shikoku, and western Honshu as lands where it was the local custom to abort fetuses and kill infants \(see Map 5 and Appendix 5\).5 A second group of regions—particularly Hokuriku and the western tip of Honshu—was praised by locals and visitors alike

for a pious renunciation of infanticide. Th

e rest of Japan, including the central 

section of Honshu, seems to have fallen between the two extremes. Few if any writers singled out Central Japan for killing babies, and neither its governments nor local philanthropists showed special concern for infant lives. Infanticide was nonetheless common enough to leave demographic traces in some villages of this region. Its great cities—Edo, Osaka, and Kyoto—had a reputation for their busy abortionists, who plied their trade so openly that we even know what the going rate for restoring a woman’s menses was: 372 copper mon, according to one fl ier advertising “fi rst day of the month” pills \( *tsuitachigan*\).6

Following these Edo-period statements and silences, this chapter argues that three separate cultures of family planning existed within eighteenth-century Japan. In the culture of infanticide, killing babies was a matter of social consensus: parents should only raise a set number of children, do away with all others, or risk the ridicule of their neighbors. In the culture of inclusive parenting, people prided themselves on bringing up every child, whether they actually did so or not. Th e 

third approach to childrearing lacked the strict fertility norms of the culture of infanticide but does not seem to have considered abortion and infanticide particularly problematic on ethical grounds. Th

is threefold typology is of course a simpli-

fi cation, but as the following two sections will show, it is broadly consistent with the geography of Japan’s infanticide discourses and countermeasures, as well as with the demographic record.

Apart from staining regional reputations, the perception that infanticide was widespread prompted local countermeasures: propaganda \(which I use in the original neutral sense of the word\), subsidies, and surveillance. Much of this evidence can be traced back to specifi c localities, allowing us to gauge to what extent reputations refl ected local concerns and local practice. Propaganda against infanticide survives on paper, wood, and silk. Th

irty-fi ve votive tablets and sixteen 

scrolls show women killing their newborns. Sometimes, a crying buddha or god sheds tears above the scene, and usually the painter shows the infanticidal mother transformed into a devil, hag, or animal. Especially in images created by Buddhist priests, mothers, midwives, or fathers suff er the punishments of hell. 

Occasionally, an inscription reinforces the visual message and records the name of the donor. We fi nd one domain lord and several priests among those who commissioned such images, but more typically, groups of concerned lay commoners paid the painter.7 With three exceptions, Eastern Japan accounts for all infanticide scrolls and votive tablets whose original locations are known.

which were frequently used to illustrate sermon tours, deteriorate easily from use. 

Votive tablets may have fared even worse; it is only very recently that museum curators have identifi ed them as cultural properties deserving of preservation. 

Even of those tablets and scrolls plotted on the map, eight have been lost over the last century. 

Smaller in size but far larger in number, mass-produced posters and pamphlets were the other major vehicle for moral suasion. Eastern Japan dominated this genre in both authorship and dissemination, but areas of Western Japan infamous for infanticide also produced a number of examples.9 Posters usually showed a woman committing infanticide and framed that image with verbal admonish-ments. Booklets combined eclectic arguments and colorful warnings, and oft en deployed gruesome illustrations. Some ended with a request to read the text aloud to those who could not read it themselves. Like the tablets and scrolls, they were sometimes sponsored by governments or temples but most frequently were the work of elite commoners. 

At least fi ft y-six domains and intendancies introduced childrearing subsidies, and thirty-fi ve imposed pregnancy surveillance on all commoner women \(Map 7\). 

Oft en, village elites were the driving force behind these policies, and none could have been implemented without their long hours of clerical work dedicated to writing reports, inspecting newborn children, and fi ling applications. Th e geography of subsidies and surveillance largely follows the pattern of reputations and moral suasion materials, with two notable exceptions. As we have seen, sizable portions of Shikoku were known for infanticide. However, other than in one district of Matsuyama domain, neither general childrearing subsidies nor pregnancy surveillance was introduced on the island. One possible reason has implications for the motivations of elites throughout Japan: because the population of Shikoku grew throughout the Edo period, infanticide never became more than a merely moral problem.10

While infanticide was at least lamented in Shikoku, the northern tip of Honshu produced neither protective policies nor much evidence of concern over the fate of newborns. Its four domains, ruled by the Nanbu \(Morioka and Hachinohe\) and Tsugaru clans \(Hirosaki and Kuroishi\), occupied the northern third of Mutsu, by far the largest province in Japan. While Mutsu was a byword for infanticide, no campaigns against the practice are on record in the Nanbu and Tsugaru lands until the aft ermath of the Meiji Restoration.11

How common infanticide was at the northern tip of Honshu in the eighteenth century is an open question, since relatively few of population registers survive from this region.12 Th

e fertility levels and sex ratio patterns of the eighteen Nanbu villages whose registers form part of the Ten Provinces dataset suggest that even in good years, infanticide was widespread there. Census data is consistent with these fi ndings. Although Morioka began falsifying its headcounts in 1756 to hide the

eff ects of a famine from the shogunate, there is no reason to doubt the reliability of the fi gures before this date. Every year, these reported about 120 commoner men for every 100 commoner women, a disparity that is at least consistent with widespread infanticide. While the fi ft een Hirosaki villages in my sample show neither distorted sex ratios nor low fertility, in 1850 a traveler on the Hirosaki coast was told by his host, a local fi sherman, that infanticide was common, especially farther inland.13 In the Meiji period, the Hirosaki area reported skewed sex ratios at birth and in the mortality of newborns; however, its offi

cial stillbirth rates were among 

the lowest in the whole Northeast \(see Map 11, in Chapter 10\), which may have meant that the people of Hirosaki practiced infanticide on a smaller scale than their neighbors immediately to the south. 

T R AC E S I N T H E D E M O G R A P H I C R E C O R D

Infanticide left deep traces in the demographic record of the eighteenth century, which largely mirror the geography of reputations and local eradication eff orts. 

Most provinces known for infanticide counted far more men than women in the census of 1750 \(Map 8\). Frequent sex-selective infanticide would produce just such imbalances, although other factors—excess female mortality at adult ages, gender-specifi c migration fl ows, and the undercounting of women—can also result in lopsided sex ratios. 

Provinces notorious for infanticide were also prominent among those whose commoner population shrank in the eighty years aft er the fi rst shogunal census of 1721. Although the quality of these headcounts varies, they are reliable enough to allow us to examine their general pattern \(Map 9\).14 All but two provinces that recorded a decline of more than 5 percent were either infamous for infanticide or near one of the three great cities of Edo, Osaka, and Kyoto, with their greater mortality risks and distractions from marriage. Especially in the Northeast but also in parts of Kyushu and Shikoku, famine decimated populations during these eighty years, but it is notable that the two provinces with the steepest declines, Shimotsuke and Hitachi, did not suff er catastrophic famine mortality. Instead, they were notorious for infanticide, and their rulers also complained that many of their villagers absconded to Edo. 

Not all populations said to frequently kill babies shrank. With the exception of Mimasaka and Bungo, the western provinces with an infanticide reputation did not report large declines. Populations famous for abhorring infanticide typically recorded steady growth. Most of these were strongholds of Jōdoshinshū, the True Pure Land sect of Buddhism, which condemned infanticide more consistently than other Buddhist sects and long denied the importance of the stem family, whose logic required only one surviving child to continue each line.15 Th is doctrinal distinctiveness could explain why the relative number of Jōdoshinshū temples

correlates strongly with the growth of regional populations over the eighteenth century.16 A marginal minority in Eastern Japan, Jōdoshinshū believers maintained more temples than all other sects combined in Hokuriku and various provinces of Western Japan, such as Aki, Iwami, and Nagato.17 Th ese areas, in turn, had 

some of Japan’s fastest-growing populations. 

Village studies have broadly confi rmed these regional diff erences. Historical demography has thrived in Japan for forty years and produced a wealth of longitudinal analyses of villages whose population registers survive for many consecutive years. Th

e majority of these studies are weighted toward the nineteenth century, but about two dozen permit conclusions about the eighteenth century \(Map 10\).18 

Th

e fertility rates they have published omit children who died between their fi rst hours and the point of recording, usually several months later; most, moreover, are stated as total marital fertility rates, a measure that is so sensitive to the distribution of women’s ages at marriage that it can be misleading in making comparisons. Th

ese fertility rates are therefore not strictly comparable to those calculated in this book, but they still provide an important context for my own fi ndings. In one village, the outcaste community of Minamiōji near Osaka, fertility rates exceeded eight children. For twenty-three eighteenth-century villages, they ranged between four and seven children; another seven villages and three towns had fertility rates of three to four children per woman; and for nine villages, all of them in Eastern Japan, historical demographers have computed fertility rates of less than three. In the town of Hida Takayama in central Japan, fertility plumbed similar depths if we include unmarried women in the denominator *. * In addition, reported births in eight villages deviated from natural sex ratios in ways that are statistically signifi cant and diffi

cult to explain in the absence of 

infanticide.19

Th

ese village studies are particularly important in what they suggest about the intermediate regions, which were neither notorious for infanticide nor famed for large families. Even allowing for the omission of children who died before they could be added to the register, typically in their fi rst spring, recorded fertility rates of less than four require some form of birth control, infanticide, very late marriages, exceptional rates of sterility, or extraordinarily low coital frequencies. As we saw in the introduction, most historical demographers have concluded that in central Japan, infanticide was at most a minor factor in reducing fertility. Instead they point to high rates of labor migration, which reduced coital frequencies. 

Two villages in the central province of Mino show that infanticide could be frequent even where recorded fertility remained relatively high. Th omas Smith 

and Robert Eng, who used the pseudonym “Nakahara” for their study village of Asakusanaka, found that sex ratios of recorded births varied depending on how many boys and girls the child’s parents already had. With its high levels

17/04/13 3:54 PM

of statistical signifi cance, this pattern, which will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 6, is clear evidence for frequent infanticide.20 In an analysis that combined data from Asakusanaka and neighboring Nishijō, G. William Skinner went even further than Smith and Eng, arguing that the sex of a couple’s fi rst surviving child varied depending on the balance of conjugal power.21 Despite the clear evidence for infanticide, marital fertility rates in both Asakusanaka and Nishijō 

exceeded six children per woman. While there is much room for research on the cultural and demographic role of infanticide in the intermediate regions, the present evidence suggests that at least in some areas infanticide was suffi ciently 

frequent to distort sex ratios but not frequent enough to lead to the very low fertility and population declines we see in most of the regions with an infanticide reputation. 

Not all microdemographic work sustains the broad brushstrokes of regional stereotype. Infanticide was not necessarily unknown in regions with a reputation for raising every child. One such area, Echigo, contributes 173 villages to the Ten Provinces dataset. With the exception of the mountainous district of Uonuma bordering Kōzuke, fertility in the Echigo villages was higher than in Eastern Japan, but nonetheless remained moderate, fl uctuating at around four to fi ve children per woman.22 For some sibling confi gurations, however, sex ratios showed statistically signifi cant deviations that imply that children were selected and rejected at birth even in Echigo.23 Despite this complication, it remains useful to think of three dif-ferent cultures of family planning in eighteenth-century Japan. Although at least some areas known for raising every child did not live up to their reputation, infanticide was still far less frequent there than in Eastern Japan and, presumably, the other areas notorious for this method of managing family size. 

Conversely, not everybody in Eastern Japan participated in the culture of infanticide. As Chapter 7 will explain, fertility rates below four were diffi cult to 

achieve without abortions, infanticides, or eff ective contraception, given the ages at marriage and rates of labor migration that generally prevailed in Eastern Japan. 

In every decade, however, my sample of Eastern Japan includes villages with TFRs above fi ve. While these numbers are no proof that infanticides and abortions did not occur, such levels of fertility can be explained without recourse to them, especially if we assume that menarche was late, sterility common, and coital frequencies low. As Figure 5 shows, within the population sampled in the Tōgoku dataset, the proportion of those living in villages with robust fertility rarely dropped below 10 percent, suggesting that the culture of infanticide in the pure form described by so many observers—raising no child aft er the fi rst three or four—never became universal even in Eastern Japan.

Th

e geography laid out in this chapter changed considerably in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Th

e central storyline of this book is the diminution of infanticide in Eastern Japan, beginning in the 1790s and leading to a resumption of population growth by the 1840s. As Figure 5 suggests, by the 1850s more people in Eastern Japan lived in villages where infanticide and abortion were rare than in villages where they remained common. Similar processes seem to have been at work in the north of Kyushu and in Mimasaka in Western Honshu. Elsewhere, however, the opposite trend may have transpired. In the nineteenth century, evidence for widespread infanticide begins to appear in areas that had previously not been known for killing children. In the 1850s, one offi

cial in Tottori in Western 

Honshu felt that he was fi ghting a losing battle: “In recent years,” he wrote, “it has been wildly fashionable to not raise newborn children or to abort fetuses. How large a population this wastes is beyond reckoning. I have governed the districts and villages around here and lamented this situation for a long time. How can I stop this custom?”24

In Izumo, the native province of the scrupulous pilgrim whose sudden fl ight opened this chapter, infanticide had become such a problem by the 1850s that local priests were moved to launch their own infant-protection eff orts.25 In general, however, such passion for saving newborns seems to have been considered mildly eccentric in this province once so proud of its childrearing ways. In 1867, one of its domains ordered three temples to sermonize against infanticide. When it checked on the progress of this moral suasion eff ort, it found that only one priest was doing any preaching on the subject; his two colleagues pled illness and distraction by other matters and never bothered to talk people out of killing their babies.26 In the 1870s, districts in Izumo had some of the highest sex ratios at birth in all of Japan, and from the 1890s to 1930 they also reported implausibly high stillbirth rates. 

When, in the 1930s, folklorists interviewed elderly villagers throughout Japan about the birthing customs of their childhood, they found a high concentration of reports of habitual infanticide in Izumo, or the eastern half of Shimane prefecture as it had now become.27

Th

e 1930s folklorists also found clusters of infanticide recollections within the large region of Japan that in the eighteenth century had neither been notorious for infanticide nor noted for raising every child. Among these was the south of Okayama prefecture \(Bizen province\), where eighteenth-century infanticide is evinced by a shrinking population as well as the results of two village studies.28 

Other areas, including Kagawa prefecture just across the Inland Sea and Yamanashi prefecture at the western edge of the Kantō, though not conspicuous in the eighteenth century, generated credible reports and suspicious statistics in the early twentieth century. As Chapter 13 will explain in detail, around 1900 the stillbirth

rates of all but a handful of prefectures were so high and so skewed as to imply that communities condoning infanticide existed throughout Japan.

Th

roughout eighteenth-century Japan, rural couples shared the same basic concerns: to feed, clothe, and shelter themselves and their dependents; to maintain or improve their status within their community; to provide a decent future for their children; and to secure for themselves an aft erlife safely beyond the cycle of rebirth and suff ering. For most, these goals required keeping their households small. 

Th

e inhabitants of Japan had much else in common besides. By shogunal decree, they were all parishioners of a Buddhist temple; they also worshiped spirits at shrines, and most had some notion of the basic tenets of Confucianism. People traveled throughout Japan in very large numbers and conducted commerce from one end of the island chain to the other. Th

ose who were literate participated in a 

Japan-wide print culture, and even those who could not read heard and retold stories that were shared throughout the archipelago.29

How, then, could such distinct cultures of infanticide arise? While this book, centered on Eastern Japan as it is, cannot give a conclusive answer, it can suggest two possibilities. Th

e fi rst is that regional conditions made possible diff erent strategies for limiting households to a manageable size. Many areas renowned for raising every child, for example, were equally famous as exporters of labor, and the intermediate regions sent many of their sons and daughters to the great cities. 

Second, diff erent views of infant lives may have refl ected larger worldviews, which in turn were infl uenced by factors such as the varying local strength of the True Pure Land school of Buddhism. 

Extensive labor migration before a late marriage could be nearly as eff ective as infanticide at keeping households small. For Central Japan, this is the explanation most Japanese historical demographers now advance for the generally moderate fertility rates they observe in their study villages.30 Already in 1649, the shogunate urged all but elite commoners to send away most of their children: “If those without high status who do not own many fi elds have many children, they should give them to others or send them away in service; let them think carefully about how to fi ll their mouths throughout the year.”31

Central Japan, the Kinai, and the South Kantō were particularly congenial for medium-distance labor migration. By the late seventeenth century, Kyoto, Osaka, and Edo probably all ranked among the world’s ten largest cities, with a combined population of around two million. Nagoya had 100,000 inhabitants, and more than 40,000 commoners lived in Sakai and Wakayama. Nara, Uji, Fushimi, Hikone, Sunpu, and the shrine town of Ise each had around 30,000

inhabitants.32 Th

e supply chains of these cities extended far into the surrounding countryside, where a range of manufacturing industries provided employment for rural-to-rural migrants. Th

e cities themselves also exerted an irresistible pull on many young men and women. Service in the city was in many cases an exciting and not excessively strenuous alternative to life in the countryside.33 In Uehara, a village fi ve days’ walk from Edo in Central Japan’s Suwa region, 13 percent of the working-age population was recorded as working in Edo in 1700.34 For the residents of Nishijō, a village a day’s walk from Nagoya, three cities—Nagoya, Kyoto, and Osaka—accounted for nearly half of person-years spent in service in the late eighteenth century.35

As in other parts of the early modern world, mortality appears to have been substantially higher in cities than in villages.36 In English, this phenomenon is called the “urban graveyard eff ect,” but the great historical demographer Hayami Akira has coined an equally evocative phrase in Japanese: *toshi arijigoku, * which means both “the city as an ant hell” and “the city as an antlion,” a predatory larva that lurks at the bottom of sand pits waiting for small insect prey. Although Susan Hanley has stressed the cleanliness of Edo’s streets and water supply, given the crowding of commoner tenements and the side eff ects of commercial sex in a city of far more men than women, life expectancy must surely have been shorter than in the countryside.37 Edo’s famously frequent fi res may have contributed further to its role as an “antlion pit” that many entered and few escaped.38

Among the people of Nishijō, servants employed in a city died at higher rates than those who remained in the countryside.39 Nor was mortality the only reason cities required a steady infl ow of migrants to maintain their population. Especially in Osaka, the predominance of live-in service made marriages among rural immigrants both rare and late, so that birth rates were lower than in the countryside. It is possible that low urban nuptiality was a more important reason for the negative natural growth rate than any mortality diff erences between cities and villages.40 Live-in servants were generally expected to remain unmarried. 

Although some set up a mistress \( *mekake*\) in separate lodgings, this was not a congenial environment for bearing or raising children.41

Whatever the balance of higher mortality and lower fertility in cities, the power of the urban graveyard eff ect is evident in the census returns from the Kinai, Japan’s most urbanized region. Th

ose of its villages that have been studied re-

corded relatively high fertility rates and were only lightly brushed by famine and epidemic disease. Nonetheless, the Kinai’s population dwindled by 10 percent from 1721 to 1792. Th

e role of Edo as a demographic sinkhole may similarly explain why the headcount of the southern Kantō declined slightly over the same years, even though that region suff ered no major mortality in famines or epidemics. In the words of a merchant’s son from the edge of the Kinai, “Th e number of people 

who are unable to bear their poverty and abandon agriculture to move to Edo,  

17/04/13 3:54 PM

42 The Culture of Low Fertility

Osaka, or a castletown and become merchants has steadily increased. If they have many children, they cannot help but make one a farmer, but the others they mostly send as servants into the cities, where they ultimately become merchants. In all villages, the number of commoners has gradually decreased, fi elds have gone out of cultivation, and the villages are consecutively declining.”42

Labor migration was also important in areas famed for abhorring infanticide, but their geography gave it a diff erent pattern. Large cities within these regions were few. Only Kanazawa, long Tokugawa Japan’s fourth-largest city, Hiroshima, Fukui, and Okayama had more than 20,000 inhabitants.43 In addition, many of the lands in which parents were said to raise every child had a climate that forced many people to seek work far afi eld if they did not want to spend the winter snow-bound in their huts. While Japan’s Pacifi c coast has mild, dry winters, Hokuriku and the Japan Sea coast of western Honshu lie smothered under several feet of snow for a quarter of the year. Today, this is a problem mainly in that elderly hom-eowners die of heart attacks while shoveling their driveways, but in the Edo period snow isolated villages and hindered farm work. Already in the seventeenth century, many Hokuriku villagers left their homes in the winter months to earn extra income as day laborers or itinerant peddlers in areas with open roads, especially in the Kantō. When villages struggled to accommodate a growing population, their second sons and unmarried daughters walked in the footsteps of the earlier snow refugees and looked for work in diff erent provinces. Some domains in the Hokuriku province of Echigo actively encouraged such labor emigration. Already in 1675, Echigo’s Takada domain responded to a petition for tax relief by advising hard-pressed peasants to leave their villages as servants and use their wages for tax payments.44

Much of this migration was long distance and long term. Echigo supplied the Kantō and the Northeast with farmhands and sawyers, carpenters, thatchers, and brewers.45 Etchū’s medicine peddlers and Echizen’s lacquer tappers roamed far and wide in search of customers. In Western Japan, men from Suō and Nagato traveled to Shikoku and Kyushu as carpenters and builders of stone embankments. Natives of Aki, the pious province surrounding Hiroshima, worked in the fi elds, saltworks, and mines of the adjacent infanticidal lands of Mimasaka, Bizen, and Bitchū; as far away as the Kinai, they were known as itinerant coopers and sawyers.46 Th e habit 

of seeking one’s fortune afar established itself so well in Hokuriku and western Honshu that in Imperial Japan, these regions accounted for a disproportionate number of migrants to Hokkaido, the Americas, and Japan’s expanding colonial empire.47

Of all the long-distance migrants, none became more emblematic than the prostitutes from Echigo. By the nineteenth century, they accounted for the majority of the women in many brothels of the North Kantō and the Northeast.48 In Edo, they inspired comic verses.49 Back in Echigo, their export reached such a scale that

an offi

cial of Nagaoka domain wrote two dialogues that debated whether it was right for parents to sell their daughters into prostitution.50 Several contemporary observers drew a connection between raising all children and selling some of them into prostitution. 

One such was Murata Ryūmin, a doctor of Mito domain who was so incensed at the negative portrayal of his homeland in the incipient genre of moral suasion pamphlets that he penned a dialogue between Dapeng, a giant bird of Chinese myth, and a hitchhiking louse that had “traveled a thousand *ri, * dwelling in seams of brocade and in rags, and \[knew\] the hearts of their owners well.” In this passionate defense of Eastern Japan’s reproductive culture, Murata implied that judicious infanticide was more humane than its alternative, the selling of children. “In other provinces, people raise children like dogs and cats, and if they have a fi ne fur \( *kenami ga yoki*\), they sell them in the spring of their sixth or seventh year. To raise prostitutes and thereby support one’s own livelihood . . . is as inhumane as eating one’s own children. It is this \[and not infanticide\] that deserves to be called having a human face but the heart of a beast \( *ninmen jūshin*\).”51

Th

irty-fi ve years later, a man who could claim to have traveled farther than even the most adventurous louse still described infanticide and the sale of children as alternative choices. Satō Nobuhiro was a roving policy consultant and self-styled expert on agronomy, astronomy, artillery, and, among much else, the conditions of every part of Japan that he had traversed in journeys between his native Akita in the north and Satsuma in the south. “Th

e one place where infanticide 

seems to be extremely rare is Echigo, but instead it is a common practice to sell girls over seven or eight years of age to other provinces for prostitution. In fact, they are a kind of special product of northern Echigo.”52

Labor migration had a far smaller demographic eff ect in Eastern Japan.53 Th e 

number of servants peaked there around 1690, at levels of under one-fi ft h of the adult population.54 Service was the fate of a generation that was born during the baby boom of the 1660s and 1670s but grew up just as their parents embraced the idea of the stem family, in which only one child would take over the household. 

Disinherited and discouraged from staying in their native families, the spare children looked for livelihoods as the dependents of other households. We may speculate that the inheriting brothers internalized the stem household ideal and raised far fewer children; and that younger brothers who were eventually able to found their own households would have remembered their own expulsion and not wished it on their own children. With the decline of fertility, the supply of servants declined sharply aft er the disinherited generation retired. By the mid–eighteenth century, servants accounted for less than 5 percent of the population, and complaints about the outrageous cost of hired labor rang throughout Eastern Japan.55

Th

e moderate scale of labor migration is partly explained by the predominantly rural character of the region. Sendai, whose total population never exceeded

70,000, was by far the largest city in Eastern Japan. At about 10,000 inhabitants, Kōriyama in Nihonmatsu was considered the commercial hub of that domain. Th at 

said, the North Kantō lost many of its sons and daughters to Edo. Th is antlion-pit 

of a city no doubt contributed to the depopulation of the North Kantō, a loss as serious as that of the Northeast despite the far smaller death toll during the great famines.56 Th

at infanticide continued to be practiced in the North Kantō despite the opportunities for sending adult children to Edo shows that geography alone did not determine whether infanticide would be rare or common. 

Th

e view that Jōdoshinshū deserved credit for inspiring vigorous population growth was common even in Eastern Japan. Beginning in the 1790s, an increasing number of that region’s lords, village headmen, and priests saw an opportunity in the stark diff erences between the demographic culture of their region and that of neighboring Etchū and Echigo with their numerous Jōdoshinshū adherents. If the locals refused to raise enough children, the pious and hardworking poor of Etchū 

and Echigo could be brought in as settlers. Th

is managed migration served varied 

interests. Lords hoped that the newcomers would return fallow land to cultivation and taxability. Headmen intended to resurrect defunct houses in their diminished villages. Jōdoshinshū priests, fi nally, wanted to reinvigorate the faith in a region where it had a proud history but very few living adherents. 

Tax breaks, allowances for travel and settlement, and the logistical support of religious networks convinced thousands of families to migrate east permanently, where they settled into an archipelago of villages that stretched from the modern prefecture of Ibaraki in the South to the Northeast coast of Fukushima and beyond. Th

eir movement sparked confl icts, of course. At home, some domains considered them illegal emigrants and tried to repatriate them. At their destinations, the locals were not always welcoming of the strangers, whose inclusive childrearing ways they were told to admire but may have considered more akin to cats and dogs than to their own responsible restraint.57 Nevertheless, the immigrants did succeed in making a new life for themselves, and mostly repaid the expectations of those who had facilitated their journey. Yet, as if to illustrate the distinctiveness of Japan’s regional cultures, the descendants of the Jōdoshinshū migrants maintained a separate identity well into the twentieth century, long aft er high fertility became the norm in Eastern Japan.

While diff erent degrees of urbanization and the varying strength of diff erent Buddhist sects may go some way toward explaining the distinct demographic cultures of the eighteenth century, other approaches are possible as well. Hayami Akira and a series of collaborators have sought the origins of diff erent demographic attitudes in the deep history of environmental conditions. Th

ey have modeled the Northeastern

household, discovered that it maintained higher ratios of working adults to dependents than households in Central and Southwestern Japan, and concluded that harsh ecological conditions in the Northeast forced households to avoid even short spells with unfavorable dependency ratios.58 At the northern edge of the world’s rice-growing area, Northeastern farmers could reap ample harvests in average years. 

If temperatures dropped by even just a few degrees, however, the crop might fail altogether. It is possible that Northeastern farmers therefore had a heightened sense of the fragility of their existence relative to the inhabitants of more sheltered regions. 

However, Hayami hypothesizes that not just the ecology of the moment, but that of millennia past decisively shaped attitudes to household formation. According to his argument, the legacy of the prehistoric Jōmon people lingered in the Northeast. 

As hunters and gatherers, Hayami hypothesizes, the Jōmon people took the carrying capacity of the land to be fi xed, and were proactive in keeping their population in balance. Identifying the inhabitants of Central Honshu as descendants of the Yayoi, long considered Japan’s fi rst agriculturalists, Hayami argues that their heritage left them with the assumption that more people could always be accommodated on the land by clearing forest and planting new fi elds. Th

is interpretation requires an open 

mind about environmental determinism and cultural essences, and has diffi culty 

accounting for the sheer magnitude of the historical change that this book describes.59 

It also sits uneasily with the fact that during the Edo period the people of the Northeast expanded their arable land more aggressively than the inhabitants of any other major region of Japan. However, just as aerial photography discovers lost buildings in the subtle shades of wheat stalks, the study of household records may sometimes detect ancient cultural distinctions long aft er these have vanished from view.60

Whatever their ultimate origins, the regional patterns described in this chapter argue for the salience of spatial scales larger than the province but smaller than the entire archipelago. Over the past two decades, historians of Japan have demonstrated the importance of space to economic developments during the Edo period.61 Th

ey have explored diff erent spatial subjectivities.62 Th ey have become 

increasingly aware of the importance of domains and provinces, for example as units of economic activity or as loci of identity.63 Larger divisions—especially the opposition of east and west—have drawn the attention of medievalists, led by Amino Yoshihiko, as well as by historical demographers, especially in the work of Hayami Akira and his collaborators.64 Th

at infanticide was endorsed or tabooed in 

large, mostly contiguous areas demonstrates that to understand Tokugawa Japan, it is at times helpful to think in macroregions too, such as Eastern Japan, Hokuriku, or the littoral of the Inland Sea. 

Th

e regional diversity of attitudes toward infanticide has large implications for the cultural unity of eighteenth-century Japan. Despite the similarities in political organization, speech, and religion across Japan, and despite the considerable integration of commercial, intellectual, and cultural life, regional diff erences persisted

in the attitudes toward some of the most fundamental questions of human existence. Th

at there could be such basic, and regionally defi ned, disagreements over the meaning of life and death, the aft erlife, and the household community suggests that we cannot speak of eighteenth-century Japan as truly culturally unifi ed.65

In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, other new or future nation-states were riven by similarly deep divides. In Germany, for example, parents watched more than a third of their infants die in one part of the country while in another, nine in ten infants survived their fi rst birthday. Much of this diff erence hinged on whether mothers breastfed their children, but there are also unmistakable signs that deliberate mortal neglect played a role in the high infant mortality of southern Germany. One of the foremost students of this phenomenon, Arthur Imhof, speaks of two cultures: one that sought to preserve life, and one that had resigned itself to wasting it.66 Th

ese diff erences persisted even at a time when the movement for national unifi cation gained ground, and they were still present in the early years of Otto von Bismarck’s nation-state. Japan’s distinct cultures of infanticide persisted all the way into the modern imperial state of the twentieth century. In Japan as in Germany, people who lived in separate cultures of life and death could feel connected at other levels and share a political identity. 

Th

at attitudes to childrearing diff ered so much between regions reminds us that before the rise of modern mass media, it was face-to-face communication in all its spatial boundedness that governed attitudes to some of the most intimate questions of life. Th

is is a theme that will recur throughout this book. Th

e culture of 

infanticide lived in villagers gossiping about a neighbor who was recklessly raising his fi ft h child, in glib metaphors that dehumanized the infant, and in meaningful silences that held back the good wishes about a birth until the family presented the child to the community.67 Th

e retreat of infanticide, too, played out in conversa-

tions. Many of these unfolded between neighbors, but some transpired between travelers from far-fl ung parts, such as the encounters in two highway inns that opened this chapter.
