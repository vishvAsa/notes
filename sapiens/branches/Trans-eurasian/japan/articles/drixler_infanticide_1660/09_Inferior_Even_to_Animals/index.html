In the early winter of 1857, a group of fourteen men celebrated the completion of a hundred-temple circuit by dedicating a votive tablet. Fashioned from six wooden boards, this *ema * shows a young woman clad in layered robes of red and green. Still wearing the sweatband typical of women giving birth, she smothers a child on a reed mat. Diagonally above, she and the dying child appear once again. Her skin, white and smooth in the fi rst scene, has turned the same shade of green as her outer clothes, and buckles with knots and tensed muscles. From a mountainous bluish face, two embers glow above the scarlet leer of an angular jaw. Her hair, carefully tied up in the fi rst scene, is now a mane, pierced by two curved horns. All around the two fi gures, a long text furnishes further arguments against infanticide, borrowed like the images themselves from a printed pamphlet. Th e ema remains">

  <p><em>Moral Suasion and the Boundaries of Humanity</em></p>
<p>In the early winter of 1857, a group of fourteen men celebrated the completion of a hundred-temple circuit by dedicating a votive tablet. Fashioned from six wooden boards, this *ema * shows a young woman clad in layered robes of red and green. Still wearing the sweatband typical of women giving birth, she smothers a child on a reed mat. Diagonally above, she and the dying child appear once again. Her skin, white and smooth in the fi rst scene, has turned the same shade of green as her outer clothes, and buckles with knots and tensed muscles. From a mountainous bluish face, two embers glow above the scarlet leer of an angular jaw. Her hair, carefully tied up in the fi rst scene, is now a mane, pierced by two curved horns. All around the two fi gures, a long text furnishes further arguments against infanticide, borrowed like the images themselves from a printed pamphlet. Th e ema remains</p>
<p>where the fourteen placed it, in a temple that today nestles among copses and golf courses east of Tokyo, but its history did not end in 1857. Pale gray marks are scattered all over, each the size of a child’s fi st. As the priest explained when I visited the temple, this was the work of local children and their mud balls. Perhaps they had picked the infanticide scene for target practice in condemnation, or perhaps to exorcise its unsettling presence.1</p>
<p>Of the material legacies of infanticide, none quite reaches the emotional immediacy of such paintings and prints. Although their creators fashioned them with complex motives, their overt purpose was to argue that infanticide was monstrous, self-destructive, and self-defeating. As we have seen, routine infanticide was possible because parents did not accord newborns a full measure of humanity.</p>
<p>It was frequent because any pain, pity, and guilt that attended it oft en weighed lighter than obligations to one’s elders or aff ection for one’s chosen children, whom 138</p>
<p>17/04/13 3:54 PM</p>
<p>“Inferior Even to Animals” 139</p>
<p>responsible parents would raise as well as their station allowed. Th ose who sought</p>
<p>to stamp out infanticide by educating the misguided addressed both parts of this logical chain. Th</p>
<p>ey argued that infanticide would ruin the perpetrator’s house, leaving them and their ancestors without descendants. Yet their greatest rhetorical eff orts went toward rearranging the boundaries of humanity to affi rm the status of</p>
<p>newborns as full human beings. Where couples saw themselves drawing a clear line between their own reproductive prudence and the unrestrained whelping of beasts, the texts and images extolled animals as moral guideposts. Animals played a usefully multivalent role in the eff ort of the propagandists; indicating on the one hand the natural order of things, they could also remind humans that they were obliged to do better than beings that occupied a lower rung of existence.</p>
<p>For all the creativity that their makers poured into them, the moral suasion materials fall into just two broad and interweaving traditions. One grew out of two vehicles of Buddhist teaching: hell scrolls and *wasan * verses, with their stress on karma and infernal punishment. Th</p>
<p>e other category, far more numerous, presents</p>
<p>a unifi ed genre. Although some of its texts conjure the lore of vanished Chinese kingdoms while others employ homely analogies from the world of farming, three or four key arguments echo through the texts, oft en presented in phrases that document their shared provenance. Its images were sometimes painted on silk, sometimes printed until the woodblocks wore out, but they show just two major themes: the loss of humanity and divine surveillance.</p>

<p>We can trace this unity of expression to one man. Suzuki Busuke was a senior administrator for Kurobane, a domain that ruled about 15,000 subjects at the northern edge of the Kantō. In 1789, he devised a new way to combat infanticide. At the time, several domains, including his own, paid poor parents to raise children. Several more also required women to report their pregnancies and account for any that did not result in a healthy toddler. Sporadically, scholars had written short texts that challenged infanticide. Suzuki’s idea was to combine a number of key arguments and phrases with a stirring image that would anchor the message in the hearts of the illiterate.</p>
<p>When he sent the posters to each village, he explained how he thought they would work. “I will get people to pin up [the posters] in front of their faces, and they will absorb the message while they do their daily work. [Th</p>
<p>ey will reach] old people and</p>
<p>young children . . . and even little girls will no longer be heedless.”2</p>
<p>Suzuki’s poster fi rst draws the eye to the picture of a woman with the face of a monstrous cat.3 With her left knee, right foot, and both hands, she crushes a newborn child (Plate 3). Th</p>

<p>perpetrators. It begins by explaining that the local custom of strangling newborns is an evil beyond words, but then goes on to defi ne the language in which generations of campaigners would condemn infanticide:</p>
<p>Humans are the most ensouled of all beings ( <em>banbutsu no reichō</em>).4 As such, they are endowed with the divinely shining virtue of Heaven and Earth. In the three thousand worlds of the [Buddhist] cosmos, no other being has the worth of humans. People can see how swallows and sparrows that build their nests under the eaves devote themselves to nourishing their young. By contrast, it is a great evil that humans, the most ensouled of all beings, will smother their own children calmly, without sympathy or shame. Such people have the hearts of vile beasts. Th is is what is called</p>
<p>human-faced and beast-hearted ( <em>ninmen jūshin</em>).5 Th is is what this picture expresses.</p>
<p>It shows a combination of the teachings of the Buddha and the books of the Sages.</p>
<p>Upon inquiring about the various provinces of Japan, I understand that the practice of “returning” newborns is the custom of a region of forty miles’ radius around here. Th</p>
<p>is has earned us the contempt of other provinces, which loathe and fear us as a “land of devils.” Th</p>
<p>at, too, is a cause for shame.</p>

<p>“Inferior Even to Animals” 141</p>
<p>If you kill your child in reckless greed, oblivious of the karmic consequences, do not expect the gods and buddhas to hear your prayers. If you think of the prosperity of your house and the safety of your present children, you should overcome your evil ways and reform your face of a fell beast. Of course, you should also consider the suff erings that await you in the eternal chain of future lives. When the childless grow old, there is only emptiness in their fi nal hours, and many starve to death in their rude shacks. Aft er they die, nobody performs services for the benefi t of their souls.</p>
<p>Rather than trying everything to avoid present poverty, you should plan ahead for the prosperity of your descendants ( <em>shison hanjō</em>).</p>
<p>Suzuki appealed to wounded regional pride, and stoked the fears of his audience for the future of their household in this world and of their soul in its future incarna-tions. ** **Yet he gave pride of place to his appeal to humanity. In doing so he drew on two cosmologies: the Buddhist view of humans as a privileged incarnation in a chain of lives ruled by a law of karma, and an empiricist Confucian view of the universe that read nature as a guide to an ethical life. In this system of thought, humans enjoy a special relationship with Heaven and with their unmatched mental faculties occupy a privileged place in the universe. Th</p>
<p>e universe is ordered by</p>
<p>one single principle. Because all its parts represent this principle, the human mind is able to learn about the latter by observing the former. For example, sparrows feeding their young can teach people how they are supposed to behave. While privileged, Suzuki argued, humans are not secure in their eminence. By failing to live up to their potential for goodness, they can sink lower even than animals.</p>
<p>People who kill their children have a “beast heart,” as they disregard two of the four qualities that Mencius sees as conferring innate goodness on humans: sympathy and shame.6</p>
<p>Like the cosmologies that enabled and motivated infanticide, Suzuki eff ort-lessly wove in and out of the diff erent traditions that constituted the intellectual landscape of eighteenth-century Japan. While his language and imagery draw from Buddhist notions of the universe, Suzuki’s empiricist ethics can be traced to the Kyushu-based philosopher and naturalist Kaibara Ekiken (1630–1714).7 Th e</p>
<p>phrase *banbutsu no reichō * is a quote from one of East Asia’s Five Classics, <em>Th</em> * e Book *</p>
<p>*of Documents *( *Shujing * or <em>Shokyō</em>). ** **Its original context is that humans are the favorite children of Heaven and Earth and as such are held to high moral standards in their reverence of Heaven and their respect for each other.8 Kaibara gave new prominence to *banbutsu no reichō * in Japan, and went beyond the *Book of Documents * in stressing man’s status as the most “valuable” of all beings.9 Th e other</p>
<p>beings are nonetheless important guideposts in the moral universe. Kaibara is a founding fi gure in what historian Tetsuo Najita identifi es as the school of thought that saw “nature,” as opposed to “history,” as the ultimate source of knowledge. Its epistemology of empiricism called for an observation of the natural world, but also for the basic equality of all humans in their ability to achieve virtue.10 To Kaibara,</p>
<p>17/04/13 3:54 PM</p>
<p>142 Redefining Reproduction</p>
<p>human eminence was an obligation. Failure to live up to one’s potential for moral cultivation meant sinking to the level of animals.11</p>
<p>Even before it became a mainstay of arguments against infanticide, the natural ontology shaped a range of other debates. For example, the obstetrician Kojima Naoyoshi remarked just seven years before Suzuki’s poster, * “* Look at the animals such as cows, horses, dogs, and cats. . . . All give birth easily. . . . But although human beings are *banbutsu no reichō, * many suff er from diffi cult births. Th</p>
<p>at</p>
<p>humanity should be inferior to the birds and the beasts is an extraordinary thing.”12</p>
<p>Animal analogies were also discussed by authors concerned about the cosmic place of male-male love, including such luminaries as Kumazawa Banzan (d. 1691), Ihara Saikaku (d. 1693), and Hiraga Gennai (d. 1779).13</p>
<p>Even in the fi ght against infanticide, Suzuki’s rhetorical strategy had several antecedents. Manabe Gen’itsu, whose description of northern Kyushu features one of the earliest instances of scholarly comment on infanticide in Japan, argued in 1675 that people who killed their children were not humans, but animals.14 Two headmen in Shinjō domain employed the phrases “the prosperity of descendants”</p>
<p>( <em>shison hanjō</em>) and “inferior even to animals” ( <em>chōrui chikurui ni mo otoritaru</em>) as early as 1729.15 Within Suzuki Busuke’s own province and lifetime, the Buddhist priest Bukkai Tenchō deployed “the most ensouled of all beings,” “inferior to animals,” and “the prosperity of descendants” as part of a lengthy 1746 treatise against infanticide.16 Th</p>
<p>ere are also several Japanese writings on infanticide that presage Suzuki’s approach of using the solicitude of animals toward their young as benchmarks for human behavior.17 One of these, composed in classical Chinese in Hitachi, mentions the devoted parenting of crows and monkeys, and in a diff erent section dubs man the <em>rei</em> among the *banbutsu. * 18 A Chinese song against the drown-ing of daughters, craft ed by a fi ft eenth-century magistrate of the Ming Dynasty for the benefi t of his people, used similar language and appeared with Japanese annotations on a fl yer just three years aft er Suzuki’s poster.19 Why was it Suzuki’s poster that triggered an explosion of similar materials, and not these earlier works?</p>
<p>For one, Suzuki’s combination of the key phrases with a memorable image was new. For another, rural depopulation had become such a serious problem in the aft ermath of the Tenmei famine of the 1780s that many men were looking for a language to challenge the tolerance for infanticide; in this sense, Suzuki’s poster represented a synthesis of ideas whose time had come.</p>
<p>Th</p>
<p>e poster with the cat-woman was followed by a sudden blossoming of writing by local elites and administrators against infanticide. Th eir pamphlets</p>
<p>and posters were so numerous that two men of Mito, Kimura Kenji and Okano Shōgorō, were able to compile voluminous scrapbooks of such materials by the fi rst years of the nineteenth century.20 Most of the materials in their collections originated not far from Kurobane: in Hitachi, eastern Shimotsuke, and northern Shimōsa. Suzuki received some credit for his innovation. In 1792, three</p>
<p>17/04/13 3:54 PM</p>
<p>“Inferior Even to Animals” 143</p>
<p>high-ranking warriors returned to their domain of Sendai from the Ashikaga Academy in southern Shimotsuke. As they crossed Kurobane, they employed the portage services of several villagers. Despite the diff erence in status, the men struck up a conversation, in which the Sendai retainers expressed their respect for the policies of Kurobane. As the villagers reported with evident pleasure, the high-born visitors were especially impressed with a certain poster that they had seen at a tea house near the Sakai Myōjin Shrine.21 Half a generation later, at least some connoisseurs remained aware of the seminal importance of Suzuki’s print. In 1807, Tachihara Suiken, director of Mito’s historiographical project and one of the intellectual leaders of his generation, received a copy from a friend. “I will make this an heirloom of my house,” Tachihara told him. “Th</p>
<p>is has become a model for the</p>
<p>country at large.”22</p>
<p>Much of the next generation of pamphlets and posters adopted Suzuki’s language.23 If they were illustrated, they typically elaborated Suzuki’s cat-faced woman. Among the texts, three were particular infl uential: <em>On Childrearing</em> ( <em>Ikushihen), A Manual for a Prospering Posterity</em> ( <em>Shison hanjō tebikigusa</em>), and an untitled poster that begins with the words “Quoth the Amida Buddha” ( <em>Amida no</em> <em>shaku ni iwaku</em>). * * Between them, they accounted for a quarter of all distinct anti-infanticide print runs, and the latter two also found their way onto votive tablets, including the mud-spattered ema of Guzeiin that opened this chapter. With a few exceptions, the other eighty or so anti-infanticide texts created between the 1790s and the 1870s built on the pattern of these three.</p>
<p>*On Childrearing * was fi rst printed in 1790 by the Mito townsman Ebata Jirōemon.24 It used no illustrations, but presented Suzuki’s three arguments—</p>
<p>humanity, regional shame, and self-interest—in the same accessible language, including pronunciation glosses. It opened with an appeal to <em>banbutsu no reichō,</em> which it explained to mean that although the birds and terrestrial animals and grasses and trees ( <em>banbutsu</em>) all had souls ( <em>rei</em>), man’s was the greatest. Each living thing follows its nature. Birds fl y, animals run, plants fl ower and fruit. Among humans, parents must follow “the Way of the parent” and children “the Way of the child.” Parents who do not understand this are *ninmen jūshin, * human in appearance but beasts at heart. Parents who refuse to raise their children are inferior even to animals. Infants, by contrast, are fully human; just like adults who died a wrong-ful death, they may return as vengeful spirits.</p>
<p>*On Childrearing * outraged some men of Mito with its criticism targeted at Eastern Japan, but was also a publishing success. Two more print runs followed in Mito in 1791 and 1792.25 In 1792, Ōsaki Hachiman Shrine in Sendai had it recarved and distributed to the headmen of the domain’s nearly seven hundred villages.26</p>
<p>Th</p>
<p>e year aft er, the academy of Ise Shrine, the holiest Shinto site, endorsed another edition with an aft erword. Th</p>
<p>ere were at least four other print runs, including an</p>
<p>1826 edition sponsored by the spacious northern domain of Akita.27</p>
<p>17/04/13 3:54 PM</p>
<p>144 Redefining Reproduction</p>
<p>Th</p>
<p>e <em>Manual for a Prospering Posterity</em> was fi rst printed in 1793 by Teranishi Jūjirō. Th</p>
<p>e year before, Teranishi had assumed his post as intendant of Hanawa in the mountains north of Mito. In administering the ninety thousand villagers of this territory, he made the eradication of infanticide his fi rst priority. Soon aft er his arrival, he corresponded with Kimura Kenji about possible propaganda materials.28 Kimura helpfully sent him his own erudite exposition on the evils of infanticide. Teranishi returned a polite appreciation of the piece but decided not to use it.</p>
<p>Instead, he wrote a text that was an expansion of Suzuki Busuke’s poster, which Kimura, who included a hand-copy in the scrapbook of moral suasion materials against infanticide that he began to compile at this time, may have supplied as well.</p>
<p>Teranishi chose the fi nal phrase of Suzuki’s poster, <em>shison hanjō</em>, “the prosperity of descendants,” as the title of his pamphlet.”29</p>
<p>Like its model, the <em>Manual</em> devoted much space to animal analogies.30 When ants have to run for it, they fl ee carrying their eggs. A pheasant will protect its nest even in a wildfi re. Tigers and wolves do not kill their young, and a mare will refuse food for days when separated from her foal. When one slices the belly of a pregnant bitch, she will mournfully take the unborn puppies into her mouth and try to run away. How could humans, who are aft er all *banbutsu no reichō, * conduct themselves in a manner so much inferior to animals? Teranishi expressed the same empiricist approach to ethics as Suzuki, and the same view of man’s place in the universe. By devoting more space to extolling the childrearing ways of animals, the *Manual * was even more emphatic in negating a social consensus that had prevailed in many villages for at least a century: the idea that reproductive restraint elevated human beings above sentient beings.</p>
<p>Th</p>
<p>e *Manual * visualized “human face, beast heart” * * more consistently than Suzuki’s cat-faced woman. Leaning against a pile of futons, a woman recovers from childbirth, averting her gaze from an older woman who crushes the newborn on a reed mat at her feet (Plate 4). When one turns the page, the two women appear again, recognizable by the patterns of their clothes and the speech bubble–like lines that connect the two sides of the fold. However, the young mother now looks at the infanticide scene, and her hair, tied in a bun in the fi rst picture, bristles like a ghost’s. Th</p>
<p>e older woman, too, has acquired a billowing mass of hair and seems to enjoy her gruesome task. A little caption, composed in the syllabaries of a <em>tanka</em> poem, narrows the room for interpretation: “Th</p>
<p>ink of the aft erlife rather than</p>
<p>about the present world; this is the act of a parent no diff erent from a demon.”31</p>
<p>Th</p>
<p>e *Manual * was reprinted at least twenty times between 1793 and 1873, sponsored by men between Shikoku in the south and Sendai in the north.32 Others copied it by hand, presumably to serve them as lecture notes.33 Variations of its text appeared, and its images evolved. By 1826, a design that dispensed with the midwife and only showed the mother crushing her child had emerged. Her</p>
<p>“human” state was now that of a conventionally beautiful woman, and the</p>

<p>demonic transformation was far more explicit than in Teranishi’s original version, with curving horns and bulging eyes. So impressive was this image that it soon appeared on votive tablets all over the North Kantō, sometimes, as in the case at the head of this chapter, surrounded by the <em>Manual’</em> s text.34</p>
<p>Th</p>
<p>e original author of <em>Quoth the Amida Buddha</em> is unknown, but its oldest dated copy was printed in 1793.35 Obviously inspired by Suzuki’s poster, the text followed its moral empiricism. For example, aft er acknowledging that people said that they killed babies out of destitution, it countered that, “marvelously, dogs and cats have eight teats because they litter seven or eight kittens or puppies at one time. . . . Although humans give birth to only one child at a time, they have two</p>
<p>17/04/13 3:54 PM</p>
<p>146 Redefining Reproduction</p>
<p>nipples.” <em>Quoth the Amida Buddha</em> illustrated the basic equality of humans in words anyone could understand. In the fi ght against infanticide, it seems, even radical statements could be made with impunity. “Although one thinks of a great lord with an income of a million koku as a person apart, this is only a diff erence in name from a townsman or villager, an outcaste or a beggar. Th ere is not an arm’s</p>
<p>or a leg’s, a fi ngernail’s or a hair’s diff erence between them *. *” Th e precious gift of</p>
<p>humanity is easily lost by the base act of infanticide, the pamphlet goes on to argue.</p>
<p>“Look at the pheasant dying in a wildfi re; when the fl ames close in, it may fl ee for a moment, but then, unable to abandon its child, it returns, and not grudging its own body tries to shield its young. In the end, it burns.” Although the pheasant’s sacrifi ce could be read as manifest futility, the text implies that such devotion puts humans to shame. To drive home the point, it switches from empiricism to the cosmology of Buddhism. “To kill a baby that has at long last achieved the diffi cult</p>
<p>feat of being born as a human being, that is endowed with the potential for buddhahood—that is an act inferior to devils, snakes, beasts, and birds.”</p>
<p>Th</p>
<p>e concept of “human face, beast heart” * * is once again visualized as a cat woman, but in symmetry with a religious argument far more elaborate than Suzuki’s, a crying buddha levitates above on a cloud (Plate 5). Th is theme of divine</p>
<p>surveillance appeared in a transitional form in 1793 in Mito.36 In the original version of *Quoth, * a karmic bubble rises from the head of the dying infant, in which a buddha, robes billowing on his cloud-borne lotus, covers his face in distress. Several more print versions with the crying buddha or bodhisattva survive, some showing a cat-headed woman, others a mother with animal ears, horns, and fangs.</p>
<p>*Quoth the Amida Buddha * was reprinted several times and read as far afi eld as Tosa and Tsuyama in Western Japan.37 Its text appears on two votive tablets, and its crying deities came to populate many more tablets, scrolls, and prints.38</p>
<p>Monster-headed mothers, demon alter egos, and higher beings watching from above proliferated over the nineteenth century. As they spread, they added more and more variations.39 Th</p>
<p>e theme of disapproving gods or bodhisattvas seemed</p>
<p>particularly suited to votive tablets and scrolls, which were aft er all displayed in a religious context. At a shrine of the fox god Inari, a cloud-borne fox leaps above the murderous mother;40 in a temple associated with the Kannon of safe childbirth, Kannon looks down—and so on.41 Many other ema show a Jizō or Kannon welcoming the child, but in other depictions, the primary role of the god or bodhisattva is to watch rather than to welcome.42 On one ema, a ray streams from the eyes of a buddha onto the infanticide scene.43 Like the pregnancy surveillance systems that covered much of Eastern Japan by this time, such images sent a clear message: you cannot hide.</p>
<p>Artists found a variety of ways to convey the inhumanity of infanticide. On one votive tablet, a cat kills one of her kittens before a screen that partly covers a human who smothers her child.44 Th</p>

<p>shows a young mother killing her child as, above her, her husband and in-laws fi ght about the infant’s fate.45 While a red rope of evil karma rises from the child’s mouth and loops around the necks of the three family members bent on killing him or her, none of the actors is shown as dehumanized. When another artist copied the scene onto a new scroll, however, he painted the old woman as a she-devil; to the young couple, he gave pointy ears and narrowed their pupils into feline slits.46 In other depictions, the demonic nature of a woman could be indicated subtly by her shadow on a shōji screen sprouting horns, or not so subtly by manes of hair that seem to dance like black fl ames.47 Mirrors would refl ect not appearances but the heart, so that a grimace of fangs and bug eyes would stare back at the fair-faced infanticidal mother.48 As a devil, the woman usually looks older, with sagging fl esh and wrinkled skin. In some depictions, her jaw squares, and hairs appear on her arms, now coarse and thick as legs. Youthful beauty and femininity were as much at stake as humanity itself.</p>
<p>B U D D H I S T H E L L S</p>
<p>As we have seen, Buddhist notions motivated and enabled the culture of infanticide. Funerary Buddhism heightened the importance of the stem line and thereby gave parents a reason to raise only a few children. Th</p>
<p>e concept of rebirth helped</p>
<p>parents overcome any lingering reluctance to kill a newborn child by making that act seem less consequential. To be sure, Buddhism condemned the taking of life ( <em>sesshō</em>), but precisely because this category was so broad that even farmers who defended their fi elds against locusts would violate the tenet, it was open to exceptions. Only a small number of priests is known to have actively opposed infanticide before the late eighteenth century. Bukkai Tenchō, whose writings in the 1740s anticipate the arguments of Suzuki’s synthesis, was in this sense ahead of his time.49</p>
<p>Beginning in the 1790s, however, a number of Buddhist priests became important participants in the fi ght against infanticide. In their sermons and printed texts, they used the language of Bukkai Tenchō and Suzuki Busuke, but naturally tended to elaborate the religious argument, explaining how infanticide violated the tenets of Buddhism as well as the wishes of the Shinto gods.50 Th ey also composed *wasan * verses against infanticide, some of which were published in the course of the nineteenth century.51</p>
<p>Before long, Buddhist artists put the established tradition of hell paintings into the service of saving infant lives. Th</p>
<p>e genre had entered Japan from medieval</p>
<p>China and showed souls laden with bad karma going through a series of ten trials before towering demonic judges, as well as suff ering grisly punishments at the hands of lesser demons, before they are reborn into a new life.52 Around 1800, the opponents of infanticide appropriated the genre. At one level, these images simply intimidated onlookers with their punitive carnage. As importantly, the</p>
<p>17/04/13 3:54 PM</p>
<p>“Inferior Even to Animals” 149</p>
<p>scrolls’ liturgical connection to ancestor rites implicitly warned that killing infants would lead to the extinction of one’s household.</p>
<p>In the Middle Ages, temples commissioned scrolls of the Ten Kings as a means to illustrate the importance of karma. With the transformation of the economic base of temples from landed wealth to parishioners’ donations in the early seventeenth century, the Ten Kings mainly became a backdrop for funerary rites.53 To propitiate each of the Ten Kings as he tried the soul in his court, Buddhist priests performed a series of rituals from the seventh day to the third year counting from the moment of death.54 Arguably, the Ten Kings retained a place in Tokugawa Buddhism precisely because of the economic opportunity they represented for priests, as well as the emotional need of the bereaved to reach the deceased across the chasm of death. Buddhists now used their iconography to decouple people’s resort to infanticide from one of its chief motivations, their hope for painless immortality as ancestors of a stem household, whose branches had been pruned for the benefi t of a prospering stem.</p>
<p>Th</p>
<p>e cases of two priests illustrate the range of popular reactions to Buddhist sermons and the usefulness of the hell scrolls. In 1810, Jōkei of Jōsenji in Shirakawa received a magnifi cently detailed hell scroll from a fellow priest in Edo (Plate 6).</p>
<p>In it, a painted mother strangles her newborn child, while an older woman brings her a reed mat in which to wrap the little corpse. Beyond the screen that marks off the birthing space, the child’s father smokes a pipe and boils water for a nice cup of tea. Below their house gapes the black chasm of hell, into which the pale soul of the mother darts “like an arrow,” as an inscription explains.</p>
<p>Demons in tiger pelts arraign mother and father before Enma, the infernal judge. Elsewhere on the scroll, the mother is forced to watch herself killing a baby on the magic mirror Jōhari, and undergoes a series of grizzly punishments administered by brightly colored demons cheered on by groups of plump infants.</p>
<p>Far above, a triad of Shinto gods and a buddha with two attendants survey the scene.</p>
<p>In a letter back to Edo, Jōkei reported that when he fi rst unfurled this scroll for a sermon to the townspeople of Shirakawa, the faithful stood listening to him in the snow with hats and straw coats, then joined him in a <em>nenbutsu</em> procession while beating their drums. Th</p>
<p>ey continued their sacred march into mountains and</p>
<p>untilled land, “so that onlookers wondered whether they were looking for children who had lost their way.”55 Th</p>
<p>e following spring, Jōkei toured the entire domain for</p>
<p>more than twenty days, preaching to two or three villages at a time—according to his own records, to great eff ect—and was treated with great honor. Upon the conclusion of his circuit, three village headmen, eight group-heads ( <em>kumigashira</em>), and more than a hundred members of a nenbutsu association escorted him back to his temple. Th</p>
<p>e nenbutsu association of Shirakawa’s castletown walked toward them, united, and treated everybody to <em>chazuke</em> rice and saké.</p>

<p>One reason for Jōkei’s apparent success may have been that, along with the scroll, he had received a thousand *myōgō * talismans from the brush of Yūten Shōnin, whose seventeenth-century exorcisms we briefl y encountered in Chapter 3. His listeners would receive them if they promised to chant the name of Amida a hundred times a day in repentance of “former evil deeds.” Jōkei was not just warning against the consequences of infanticide, in other words, but he also off ered a reasonably easy remedy to the contrite. By the time Jōkei wrote back to Edo, he had almost used up his talismans and received another fi ve thousand from a temple in Hitachi. As if to illustrate how intertwined the Buddhist approach to combating infanticide was with the tradition that grew out of Suzuki Busuke’s eff ort, that temple also supplied Jōkei with fi ft y copies of the *Manual for a Prospering Posterity. * 56</p>
<p>Taiken of Shōonji in Sendai found his audiences to be less sympathetic. Th e</p>
<p>domain sent out orders ahead of him to arrange the logistics of his sermon circuit in 1794. For example, temples that were in bad repair and shorthanded in the aft ermath of the great Tenmei famine were to be cleaned so that Taiken could stay there, and the visits were to be timed in a manner that avoided confl icts with the busiest seasons on the farm. Nonetheless, Taiken found that in some villages, nobody showed up for his lectures. In response, the domain issued another order to ensure that his 1795 tour would be more eff ective. According to these instructions, Taiken would move according to a prearranged schedule that had him begin each day’s journey before dawn, then lecture in one village in the morning and in another in the aft ernoon, where he would also spend the night. To ensure that his presence caused the village no inconvenience, he would pay for his food and that of his attendants. Th</p>
<p>e villagers for their part were ordered to all assemble in a large house or temple, apart from one guard who would mind the village, and they were to refrain from gossip and banter while listening to Taiken’s sermon. Th at such</p>
<p>explicit instructions were necessary suggests what a typical sermon visit looked like: villagers grudgingly feeding a preacher whose exhortations bored them.57</p>
<p>While there are many possible reasons why Jōkei (at least according to his own claims) was so much more successful in his sermons than Taiken, it is notable that the documents about Taiken’s circuit mention neither talismans nor scrolls.</p>

<p>e image of the vengeful infant spirit completed the redrawing of the boundaries of humanity. Adults could lose their humanity, and the spirits of dead infants, which the culture of infanticide held to be so weak, could exercise as much malevolent power as the soul of any wronged adult. Th</p>
<p>e idea that infant spirits</p>
<p>could avenge their deaths appeared around the same time as Suzuki’s seminal poster. Around 1790, Matsudaira Sadanobu, in his capacity as lord of Shirakawa, and Takegaki Naohiro, intendant of shogunal lands in Shimotsuke, hired female</p>

<p>mediums to conjure up the spirits of dead infants in the presence of their parents.58</p>
<p>Matsudaira Sadanobu also dedicated a memorial for the victims of abortion at Ekōin in Edo, evidently to imply that their spirits required as much management as those of dead adults. In the early 1790s, spirit wrath also featured in a number of pamphlets.59 As we have just seen, on the hell scroll that Jōkei paraded through Shirakawa infant spirits watch their mother’s torments in poses of delight. Th ese</p>
<p>spiteful spirits had come a long way from the whimpering shadows of Yūten Shōnin’s exorcisms of the 1680s. In the course of the nineteenth century, infant and fetal spirits grew ever more active and violent. In a scroll from Shichigashuku in southern Sendai, they rush to the scene of an abortion at the head of a detail of club-wielding demons, ready to carry their mother to hell on a fi ery chariot.60 In a design that was probably fi rst painted by Arai Utei in the 1820s, infants hammer nails into their mother as she lies prostrate before Enma’s bench (see Plate 7). Th e</p>
<p>violence perhaps reaches its climax in an 1854 tract, which shows a maelstrom of infant spirits taking a midwife by both legs and tearing her asunder.61</p>

<p>“Inferior Even to Animals” 153</p>
<p>A gentler strategy for humanizing the infant appealed to a parent’s tender feelings for the adorable little person. As a rule, the tablets and scrolls do not show the victims of infanticide as newborns, umbilical cord fl apping and slick with blood, even though everything else suggests the immediate aft ermath of birth.62 Rendering the victims of infanticide as slightly older infants—plump, large, with a full head of hair and, when visible, an expressive face—implied that newborn infants already possessed the attributes of older children, whose killing no parent would consider. In a phrase that anticipates the methods of the twentieth-century ProLife movement, the 1830 pamphlet *Why Children Are Treasures *( <em>Kodakaraben</em>) * *</p>
<p>extended the humanity of the child back into the womb by pointing to its human shape: “Although you cannot see the face and shape of the child while it is in the womb, how adorable is it once it is born! People who abort it by killing it with poisons or stabbing it to death cannot even be compared to devils or snakes.”63</p>
<p>Along similar lines, a revolution in anatomical knowledge may have made an unintended contribution to the decline of infanticide. In a pioneering essay, Ochiai Emiko argued more than twenty years ago that starting in the 1750s, a</p>
<p>“reproductive revolution” changed attitudes toward fetal life and childbirth in Japan.64 She draws her evidence from the writings of a new school of obstetricians, the Kagawa-ryū, whose careful Western-style anatomy replaced earlier beliefs about fetuses.65 As Susan Burns has pointed out, however, the fame of the Kagawa school rested on its ability to save mothers by forcibly extracting fetuses during diffi</p>
<p>cult births, oft en destroying their crania in the process.66 Th e detractors of</p>
<p>Kagawa doctors therefore charged them with performing abortions. Th e fact that</p>
<p>intrauterine photography in North America and Europe convinced many people to think of fetuses as human beings makes it tempting to conclude that the anatomical discovery of the fetus and its position in the womb may have had a similar eff ect in eighteenth-century Japan. However, that parallel may be misleading.</p>
<p>Somebody ready to kill a newborn child would surely not shrink from abortion because the fetus looked much like a newborn, or spare a newborn because it had looked approximately human in his fetal form. Th</p>
<p>e personal infl uence of obstetri-</p>
<p>cians, meanwhile, must have been constrained by their relatively small numbers.67</p>
<p>Even in print, their infl uence remained limited. Well into the nineteenth century, most almanacs continued to portray the early stages of pregnancy with Buddhist symbols rather than with fetal shapes.</p>

<p>Th</p>
<p>at the images of infanticide as dehumanizing and self-destructive captured many imaginations is evident from the fact that they were copied and elaborated for more than a century (Figure 16), and by a diversity of people. More than a hundred distinct prints survive, most of them illustrated with a demon</p>

<p>woman. ** **Twenty-eight ema and eleven scrolls with an infanticide theme remain, and there are photographs or descriptions of thirteen ema and scrolls known to be now lost. Some people commissioned multiple ema. For example, Terauchi Shirōemon, headman of a village near Utsunomiya, displayed an ema of an ogre woman under the eaves of the Kannon chapel in his home village in 1843.68</p>
<p>Th</p>
<p>irteen years later, his name appears among the ten donors of another ema with a horned mother smothering her child.69 Others, such as Igarashi Tomiyasu in Aizu and Inoue Ikutsune in Chichibu, paid for multiple print runs.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a striking aspect of the remaining record is the range of the sponsors and artists. Dozens of diff erent artists were involved. Some of the donors were headmen, but others whose social status is known from surviving population registers were not.70</p>
<p>Th</p>
<p>e surviving scrolls and ema probably represent only a small fraction of those ever painted. Scrolls were oft en used to illustrate the sermons of itinerant preachers, but frequent travel shortened their lifespan. Of the infanticide scrolls painted by Arai Utei for four temples around Yonezawa in 1824, for example, none is now accounted for.71 Th</p>
<p>e Edo-based priest who gave Jōkei his hell scroll sent at least several and possibly numerous others to temples in various parts of Japan; in spite of their uncommonly fi ne execution, which would tend to win them notice, I was able to locate only two.72</p>
<p>Ema have fared just as badly. Aft er many decades of wind and rain, some surviving infanticide ema are weathered to the point where their original patterns and inscriptions are only visible in raised lines where the wood was once protected by a layer of paint. Since most ema were displayed under the open eaves of temples, chapels, or shrines, this pattern of erosion must have been very common, and most would surely have been discarded once the fading pigments made their display pointless. Indoor displays did not guarantee survival either, since inside chapels the accretion of ema oft en became so great that room for new dedications was made by burning older off erings. It is only in the past few decades that ema have become recognized as cultural properties as deserving of protection as statues and scrolls. It is therefore not surprising that only some of the last infanticide ema to be painted, the mid-1890s works of the itinerant priest-painter Hanabusa Fuhaku, come in a group done by the same hand. Given the typically serial mode of artistic production in Edo Japan, it is likely that earlier artists, too, executed the same theme more than once, but before the Meiji period no two of the surviving ema were signed by the same hand.</p>
<p>While most of the losses can only be dimly guessed at, some are well documented. Even in the last decade, a fi re claimed one ema, and two more that appear in earlier publications are said to be now lost.73 Since many were displayed in chapels with no resident priest, a combination of cold winter nights and vagrants could be fatal.

<p>or fi ve infanticide ema were burned as fuel by homeless squatters in the fi nal winter of World War II. Deliberate destruction also seems to have claimed many ema.</p>
<p>Demon faces have been scratched out on several, and, as we have seen, mud balls thrown at others.74 Th</p>
<p>e late priest of Tokumanji, a temple overlooking the lower course of the Tonegawa, recollected that there used to be infanticide ema everywhere along the river, many of them in small shrines and halls, but that around 1920 the local police declared them injurious to public morals and ordered them burned. Th</p>
<p>e Tokumanji ema itself survived only because the priest pretended to burn it and then hid it under a layer of paper.75</p>

<p>Th</p>
<p>is book argues that the practice of infanticide depended on understandings of humanity and responsibility. How large a contribution the moral suasion eff ort made to the rearrangement of these categories is diffi</p>
<p>cult to determine. Two things</p>
<p>are certain, however. First, the words and images of this eff ort had real power, or else they would not have been repeated by a hundred diff erent authors. Second, whether heeded or not, they were an important presence not just in the minds of their authors, but throughout Eastern Japan. In some domains, every single village received a pamphlet, to be read out by its headman; in others, each village was visited periodically by sermonizing priests or “childrearing” offi cers.76 In village</p>
<p>upon village, images of demonic women scowled at passersby from the eaves of temples and shrines, and pasted onto a pillar or a wall, printed monster mothers crushed infants in highway inns and private homes.</p>
<p>When read from a gender perspective, the handful of designs that show infanticide scenes without dehumanizing transformations in this world or punishment in the next hint at the power of the iconography they omit. Two prints remain in which the baby killers are neither transformed nor tormented. Both show male participation.77 Th</p>
<p>ere are several infanticide prints and scrolls that show men being punished by demons alongside their wives.78 Only one print, however, implies that a man is losing his humanity, and it does so by attaching a karmic speech bubble with a little cat to the infanticidal father.79 Compared to the bared fangs and blow-ing manes of the she-devils, this juxtaposition seems rather subdued.</p>
<p>While men, who sketched, painted, carved, and dedicated the vast majority of infanticide depictions, seem to have been reluctant to portray other men as having lost their humanity, the only two votive tablets that are known to have been commissioned by women show infanticide scenes without any demons; the women simply kill their babies without punishment or transmogrifi cation. In one, the bodhisattva Kannon fl oats above the birthing chamber. In another, the bodhisattva Jizō covers his face in grief over a woman killing her infant.80 Th is design suggests</p>
<p>17/04/13 3:54 PM</p>
<p>“Inferior Even to Animals” 157</p>
<p>that at least some women rejected depictions of infanticidal mothers as monsters. In this rendering, infanticide is not a dehumanizing crime, but an unfortunate yet unavoidable deed over which merciful bodhisattvas may cry with compassion for both child and mother. Th</p>
<p>e superfi cial similarity to the votive tablets that</p>
<p>condemned infanticide made such ema safe to commission and display. Th eir true</p>
<p>intent, however, may have been to accompany a prayer for pity and forgiveness, and perhaps also to subvert a genre that frightened or off ended their women sponsors.</p>
<p>If so, even the absence of the demonic transformation speaks to its power to unsettle a reproductive culture.</p>
