  <p>*Four Approaches to Estimating the *</p>
<p><em>Rate of Infanticide</em></p>
<p>Th</p>
<p>e preceding chapters have explored the understandings of human life, family, responsibility, and time that permitted, motivated, and patterned infanticide.</p>
<p>Th</p>
<p>is short chapter attempts to quantify its frequency through four diff erent approaches. Th</p>
<p>e fi rst of these consults the reports of contemporary observers who stated clearly what proportions of infants were killed at birth. Th e other</p>
<p>three derive estimates from the demographic record. One trace of missing children to be found there is the sex ratio pattern of surviving brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>Since infanticide in Japan was not strictly sex selective, sex ratios only yield only a minimum estimate. To approximate the actual scale of infanticide, we have to look to the number of recorded children rather than to their sex alone. By modeling the reproduction of the women of the Tōgoku dataset, it is possible to simulate to how many children they should have given birth in the absence of contraception, abortion, and infanticide, and to calculate how many infanticides or abortions are necessary to explain the number of children they actually recorded. Finally, many infanticides and abortions left traces in the stillbirth statistics that the modern Japanese state collected. Th</p>
<p>eir exorbitant numbers</p>
<p>and extravagant sex ratio patterns show that parents and midwives reported many children as stillborn who would have lived had their parents not desired otherwise. Meiji-period statistics do not permit direct conclusions about the rate of infanticide during the years of its greatest frequency a century earlier, but they do off er independent confi rmation that infanticide on a vast scale really did occur in Japan.</p>

<p>Th</p>
<p>ose Edo-period writers who quantifi ed the incidence of infanticide asserted that newborn children were about as likely to be killed as to be raised. Describing the women of Chikugo in northern Kyushu, a domain physician suggested that infanticides ran to 40 or 50 percent of all births: “if they give birth to fi ve children, they kill two; if they give birth to ten, they kill four or fi ve.”1 In Sendai, a scholar banished to the countryside stated in 1754 that villagers now only raised one to four children instead of the fi ve to eight that couples had brought up half a century earlier.2 In a comparison of two family planning strategies, a merchant-philanthropist in Kōzuke implied that to limit themselves to “two sons and a daughter,” a couple would have to abort about four fetuses.3 For the general area of Hitachi and Shimotsuke, the lexicographer, Ōta Zensai noted that “those who give birth to many children but cannot raise them,” presumably a subset of the population, killed 40 percent (two out of fi ve).4 Th</p>
<p>e painter, essayist, and travelogue</p>
<p>writer Shiba Kōkan put the fi gure at 40 percent overall in Chikuzen and Chikugo in northern Kyushu. In Hitachi, Dewa, and Mutsu, he thought, farmers married so early that many of them bore more than ten children and resorted to infanticide.</p>
<p>If we combine this statement with the frequent assertion that people in this area raised only two to four children, we are left with an implied rate of infanticide of at least 60 percent.5</p>
<p>M I S S I N G G I R L S A N D M I S S I N G B OYS</p>
<p>As we saw in Chapter 6, the balance of newborn boys and girls diff ered markedly depending on how many sons and daughters a couple already had. In these distortions, the ghosts of missing children are faintly visible. To ensure that we do not mistake random fl uctuation for sex selection, I have only included distortions that are statistically signifi cant at the 5 percent level and sorted children into just nine diff erent categories, all defi ned by the number of elder brothers and sisters. I then made the extreme assumption that only children of the sex disfavored in each sibling confi guration were killed. Th</p>
<p>is assumption is of course not supported by</p>
<p>the textual record, which only occasionally mentions sex selection as a motive for infanticide. Th</p>
<p>is approach does, however, serve to establish an absolute minimum number of infanticides. For each of the nine sibling confi gurations, I calculated the 90-percent confi dence interval for the number of missing boys or girls, and then added up the results. As Figure 10 shows, this calculation yields a minimum infanticide rate of about 7 percent for the years between 1660 and 1740. Aft er a steep decline around 1750, the rate remained at 2 to 3 percent until around 1830 and then subsided to about 1 percent toward the end of the Edo period. Figure 10 also plots</p>

<p>112 The Culture of Low Fertility</p>
<p>the relaxed assumption that only every other infanticide was strictly sex-selective (that is, that only about two-thirds of infanticides fell on the disfavored sex), which drives the proportion of missing children above 14 percent in the early eighteenth century.</p>
<p>A M O N T E C A R L O S I M U L AT I O N</p>
<p>Scholars have advanced a small menagerie of factors to explain the moderate or low fertility of various Japanese populations. Late marriage, labor migration that separated spouses, pathological sterility, chronic malnutrition, and excessive female workloads have each had their proponents, who have all marshaled good arguments for identifying such alternative explanations to infanticide and abortion.6 To assess to what extent these factors can account for the observed fertility of the women of Eastern Japan, I have designed a Monte Carlo simulation model that combines information from the Tōgoku dataset with empirical values that physicians, anthropologists, and demographers have established for the processes that determine whether a woman conceives and delivers a child.</p>
<p>To conceive, a woman needs to clear a series of hurdles. She must have experienced menarche but not yet menopause, and she cannot suff er from pathological sterility. She must be experiencing menstrual cycles, which is unlikely as long as she nurses an infant intensely. Her menstrual cycle must be ovulatory, and sexual intercourse must take place at the right time relative to ovulation. Many embryos and fetuses miscarry, most of them so early that their mother may not even notice that she was pregnant. If the child is born and lives, it infl uences the mother’s subsequent reproduction by inducing lactational amenorrhea through frequent breastfeeding.</p>
<p>To model this process, we need to know the probabilities of all these and a number of other factors. Th</p>
<p>e Tōgoku dataset provides some of the necessary</p>
<p>information: it tells us how many women of a given age were married, and how many were separated from their husbands due to labor migration.7 Mortality fi gures for children and mothers come from the same sources that I employed in generating the Edo-period fertility fi gures in this book: necrologies and longitudinal village studies (see Appendix 1). Other inputs can be gleaned from the qualitative record of the Edo period. For example, there is wide agreement that, with few exceptions, Japanese mothers breastfed their children, oft en until they were able to walk.</p>
<p>Th</p>
<p>e remaining probabilities have to be derived from the research of physicians, anthropologists, and demographers on relatively recent populations. Whenever possible, I have consulted studies of populations with high disease burdens and poor nutritional status so as to accommodate a pessimistic view of the physical condition of Edo-period women. Whenever there was a range of empirical observations, I have chosen fi gures that bias the model against implying large proportions of infanticides or abortions. For example, I used sterility rates from</p>
<p>17/04/13 3:54 PM</p>
<p>The Ghosts of Missing Children 113</p>
<p>1980s Central Africa, which then had the world’s highest incidence of pathological sterility. In the same spirit, I have assumed that no sexual intercourse took place outside marriage, that coital frequencies were lower than in any survey of married women in the modern world, and that famine amenorrhea was universal in times of subsistence crises. I explain these choices, as well as the precise operation of the model, in a separate article.8</p>
<p>Stocked with these inputs, the simulation creates an artifi cial population of women. Th</p>
<p>e program randomly generates a birthday between 1610 and 1860. On each new day, it then calculates whether the woman lives or dies, experiences menarche or menopause, marries or becomes single, separates from her husband due to his labor migration or her own, acquires pathological sterility, experiences amenorrhea or the return of her menses, ovulates, has intercourse, conceives a child, miscarries, gives birth, or has an illness carry off a child she is nursing. Once the program has determined the death of this fi rst woman, it creates another, and continues to do so until the simulated population reaches a sample size that returns stable results and permits confi dent conclusions.9</p>
<p>From this simulated population, fertility rates are calculated just as they would be from a sample of real women. If the simulation returns fertility rates that are lower than those of the observed population, I have gone too far in my principle of biasing the model against conceptions and births. If the simulation returns fertility rates that are higher than those of the actual population and if we are satisfi ed that the assumptions are unlikely to generate unrealistically many births, we must conclude that contraception, abortions, or infanticides account for the diff erence. As I discuss below, the evidence for eff ective contraception among Edo-period villagers is so weak that we can, for the time being, exclude it from our model. For abortions and infanticides, we cannot simply subtract the observed from the simulated fertility. An abortion prevents fewer new conceptions than an infanticide. An infanticide, in turn, prevents fewer new conceptions than raising and nursing the child, since lactational amenorrhea typically delays the woman’s next ovulation for a year and a half.</p>
<p>Good estimates for abortions and infanticides therefore require that these two interventions be integrated into the simulation model. To this end, I repeat the simulation for ninety diff erent levels of infanticide (0 to 89 percent of all live births) and ninety diff erent levels of abortion (0 to 89 percent of all pregnancies that would have been carried to term). It is then possible to match the observed fertility (for each decade and age group) with one of the levels of infanticide or one of the levels of abortion. In principle, the technique can be run for varying combinations of infanticide and abortion, but because it is probably impossible to determine the precise balance of the two, I have chosen to establish the range within which their frequency must have fallen by simulating one scenario where all such interventions are infanticide (Figure 11), and another where all are abortions (Figure 12).

<p>116 The Culture of Low Fertility</p>
<p>with the conservative assumptions employed by the model, in several decades of the eighteenth century between 40 percent (where all interventions were infanticides) and 50 percent (where all interventions were abortions) of pregnancies must have ended with the destruction of the fetus or newborn.</p>
<p>One way of assessing whether the assumptions were indeed biased against the conclusion that a large number of infanticides occurred is to compare these results to the sex ratio analysis. For the 1660s, the simulation comes close to explaining the observed fertility without any infanticides or abortions, while sex ratio distortions prove that infanticides must have amounted to an absolute minimum of 4.5 percent of births in that same decade, or 9 percent if, more plausibly, only half of infanticides were strictly sex selective (see Fig. 14, below). Since the simulation model is designed to be biased against the conclusion that infanticides and abortions were frequent, this discrepancy is reassuring, as it only confi rms that the assumptions are indeed conservative. While the simulation model produces rates of infanticide or abortion that may challenge our imaginations, it is therefore possible that in reality they were higher still.</p>
<p>T H E BA L A N C E O F A B O RT I O N S A N D I N FA N T I C I D E S</p>
<p>Far less certain than the magnitude of these numbers is their breakdown into infanticides and abortions. Th</p>
<p>e simulation model can do no more than establish</p>
<p>the bandwidth of how many abortions or infanticides were necessary to result in the observed rates of fertility. Th</p>
<p>e sources do not permit us to estimate the precise</p>
<p>balance between the two, beyond deriving a minimum number of infanticides from sex ratio distortions. To parents, infanticides had certain advantages over abortions. Rightly or wrongly, infanticides seem to have been thought to be safer, perhaps because women who died in abortions loomed large in popular culture.10</p>
<p>It appears that most abortions were accomplished with poisons or the insertion of pointed objects into the uterus. While such procedures must have carried a considerable risk, adult women did not suff er extraordinarily high mortality rates in Edo-period Eastern Japan. Th</p>
<p>is may either mean that abortions were less</p>
<p>perilous than their reputation—perhaps thanks to reasonably safe techniques, such as inducing the expulsion of the fetus by massage—or that they accounted for only a minority of rejected children.11 Infanticides had two other signal advantages over abortions: they helped a woman postpone her next pregnancy longer than an abortion would, and they allowed parents to select for children whose sex, timing, and health suited the household and promised a good character and a strong hold on life.</p>
<p>Before the nineteenth century, a majority of contemporary observers implied that infanticide was the more important of the two practices in the countryside.</p>
<p>We should take seriously the possibility that the prominence they accorded</p>
<p>17/04/13 3:54 PM</p>
<p>The Ghosts of Missing Children 117</p>
<p>infanticide owes something to its particular vulnerability to attacks on moral and cosmological grounds; while some opponents of infanticide and abortion treated the two as morally equivalent, others decried infanticide as the greater outrage.</p>
<p>Th</p>
<p>e moral suasion materials generally directed the main force of their words and images at infanticide. While posters and votive tablets made the infanticidal mother an instantly recognizable icon, few such materials showed abortion scenes.12 As we have seen, abortions were advertised openly in Edo, and their methods explained in medical handbooks.</p>
<p>Th</p>
<p>e balance between abortions and infanticides may well have shift ed over time. Sawayama Mikako has speculated that the surveillance systems as well as changing concepts of fetal life prompted at least some couples to substitute abortions for infanticides.13 Even if abortions came to partially substitute for infanticides in the nineteenth century, however, infanticides were still suffi ciently</p>
<p>common in the 1870s to distort regional sex ratios at birth (see Map 13, in Chapter 13) and, as we shall see later in this chapter, left their traces in the stillbirth and neonatal death statistics of many Japanese prefectures throughout the early twentieth century.</p>
<p>T H E C O N T R AC E P T I O N P U Z Z L E</p>
<p>Th</p>
<p>ere is one important possible reason why, for some decades, the simulation may overstate how many fetuses and neonates were sacrifi ced to the culture of reproductive restraint. If the couples in the Tōgoku dataset used eff ective contraception, many of the forestalled lives of the simulation model would never have been conceived in the fi rst place.</p>
<p>Th</p>
<p>e evidence for contraception in the Edo period is vexingly inconclusive.</p>
<p>Some potentially eff ective substances, such as cottonseeds with their high content of gossypol, seem to have been known for their ability to avert conceptions.14 By the mid–eighteenth century, specialized stores for sex toys sold imposing horn condoms; while their main attraction may have been their rigidity, their usefulness in preventing conceptions was well understood.15 Soft er sheaths were imported from the Dutch in Nagasaki, if presumably in only modest numbers *. * 16 * * Prostitutes routinely used paper pessaries ( <em>tsumegami</em>) and tried to rinse away their customers’ semen.17 It is doubtful that such contraceptive practices ever reached married women. One author humorously called the paper barriers a “false bottom”</p>
<p>( <em>agezoko</em>), a joke that works especially well because of the context of commercial sex.18 A witty verse observed: “What makes nonprofessional women a special treat is that they do not use paper inserts.”19</p>
<p>People understood the role of semen in reproduction, but it is not clear whether coitus interruptus ever became very common. In late-nineteenth-century France, coitus interruptus backed up by abortions was the mainstay of a birth control</p>
<p>17/04/13 3:54 PM</p>
<p>118 The Culture of Low Fertility</p>
<p>regime that resulted in very low fertility rates.20 Th</p>
<p>ere is no evidence of a similar</p>
<p>culture in Edo-period Eastern Japan, however. Chinese medical texts regarded semen as part of the body’s vital force, which should not be squandered. Th ey</p>
<p>instructed their male readers in techniques such as coitus thesauratus and coitus reservatus, both of which avoid ejaculation.21 To what extent men followed this advice is uncertain.</p>
<p>In an analysis of a mid-nineteenth-century village in Sendai, Takagi Masao has detected a seasonal pattern of births that favored conceptions and deliveries in the less busy seasons on the farm. He has read this as evidence that couples pursued a contraceptive strategy.22 Th</p>
<p>ere is no telling whether this was accomplished through</p>
<p>varying frequencies of intercourse, through deliberate abstinence, or through actual contraception. Although these births transpired under a pregnancy surveillance system, it is even possible that their seasonal distribution bears the marks of abortions and infanticides.</p>
<p>Around 1900, a number of women writers portrayed a husband’s use of contraception as a slight against his wife.23 Th</p>
<p>eir attitudes need not have been shared by</p>
<p>the population at large; however, survey data implies that even in the 1930s, aft er two decades of lively debate and considerable advertising campaigns, fewer than 10 percent of Japanese couples used contraceptives. Th</p>
<p>e onus of proof is therefore</p>
<p>on the hypothesis that in the Edo period, an age innocent of vulcanized rubber and IUDs, eff ective contraception played a role outside the context of prostitution.24 Even if such devices and techniques inserted themselves into the marital lives of some villagers, their high failure rate may have rendered their demographic eff ects quite modest unless they were adopted by a large portion of the population; even prostitutes found their techniques unequal to the task of preventing unwanted pregnancies altogether.25</p>
<p>Th</p>
<p>ere is a good deal of evidence to suggest that women, including married village women, put their faith in contraceptives of doubtful effi cacy, including</p>
<p>amulets, rituals, moxibustion, and acupuncture.26 In Edo and perhaps other major cities, fl iers and posters aggressively marketed pills ( *tsuitachigan * and other names) that promised women protection from pregnancy if taken on the fi rst day of every month. Technically, these pills were probably abortifacients, but Japan’s foremost student of the history of contraception doubts that they were eff ective as such;27 it is also not clear whether they ever found wide distribution in the countryside.</p>
<p>Th</p>
<p>e many otherwise perceptive men who worried about depopulation never mentioned contraception, eff ective or otherwise, as a contributing cause of the demographic malaise.28 In the cultural context of the time, contraception was not vulnerable to attack on moral grounds in the way that infanticide and abortion were, but arguments against its use did exist. When a twenty-year-old samurai of</p>
<p>17/04/13 3:54 PM</p>
<p>The Ghosts of Missing Children 119</p>
<p>rank made a list of contraceptives in 1724, he concluded that they should not be used even by the poor or prostitutes, since they could result in lifelong sterility.29</p>
<p>Given the many fi ne-grained analyses of infanticide that men of the Edo period produced, it would be strange if pervasive contraception eluded comment.</p>
<p>We cannot ascribe this silence to delicacy. Miyaoi Sadao, who worried that depopulation was making Japan susceptible to foreign attack, listed both “misplac-ing human seed by fornicating with another man’s wife” and “pruning ( <em>mabiki</em>) a baby and thereby decreasing the human seed [i.e., the population]” as off enses that could get people into trouble in the netherworld.30 Surely, his readiness to talk about spermatic transgression and demographic sabotage on the same page would have prompted him to decry contraception as well, had he thought its use to be common.</p>
<p>If contraception was widely employed in the eighteenth century its use to be is equally diffi</p>
<p>cult to explain why that knowledge was lost in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, to be replaced with high fertility and an array of magical practices that folklorists recorded in the 1930s.31 Yet it would also be remarkable if the world of prostitution was so insulated from the world of marital sex that the routine use of moderately eff ective contraceptive practices in the one could have coexisted with general ignorance of contraception in the other.32 Many married men would have encountered the techniques prostitutes employed to avoid getting pregnant. A failure to apply this knowledge in a marital context could have had two reasons.</p>
<p>One, given the lack of privacy that characterized most residential arrangements in Japan before the twentieth century, for many couples marital sex may have been a matter of seizing spontaneous opportunities.33 Unlike prostitutes, wives would therefore have found it diffi</p>
<p>cult to arm themselves for such encounters. A second</p>
<p>possibility is that the association with prostitution rendered pessaries and other eff ective forms of contraception inappropriate for any “decent” woman.</p>
<p>If this second hypothesis is true, it tells us a great deal about the culture of infanticide. It suggests that when presented with the choice between the destruction of a child and an act that was insulting to the wife, couples chose the former.34</p>
<p>While such attitudes may puzzle us today, similar priorities are prominent in the historical record of Europe. Well into the nineteenth century, coitus interruptus was still denigrated in many areas; meanwhile, mothers abandoned millions of newborn children to foundling homes that were oft en tragically bad at keeping them alive. In parts of nineteenth-century Italy, the Catholic Church actually forced unwed mothers to give up their newborn children, most of whom died prematurely in institutional care. According to historian David Kertzer, the impe-tus for this policy so destructive of infant lives was a desire to protect the honor of those children’s fathers.35 It is possible that in a similar sense, the unwanted newborns of Japan were sacrifi ced to the honor of their mothers.</p>

<p>120 The Culture of Low Fertility</p>
<p>T H E S T I L L B I RT H S TAT I S T I C S O F I M P E R IA L JA PA N</p>
<p>While many riddles remain about the history of contraception in Japan, a third type of quantitative evidence suggests that Edo-period observers did not wildly exaggerate the frequency of infanticide and abortion. From 1886, the prefectures of Japan obliged parents and midwives to fi le reports of stillbirths and began to publish them as part of their statistical digests. Listing stillbirths by calendar month, month of gestation, the sex of the fetus, and its status of legitimacy, these statistics are at once marvelously precise and monumentally inaccurate.</p>
<p>Contemporary observers occasionally noted that infanticides would be reported as stillbirths, status of a tradition that went back to the pregnancy surveillance systems of the late Edo period.36</p>
<p>In many prefectures, the pattern of stillbirths had little in common with those observed elsewhere in the world. In Europe, stillbirth rates of 3 to 4 percent were typical between the sixteenth and early twentieth century, and for large populations, a rate of more than 6 percent was unheard of; rates from the parts of the Americas, Africa, and Asia (including Taiwan and Korea) that produced such statistics in the early twentieth century generally fall into the same range.37 In Imperial Japan, by contrast, a third of prefectures reported rates above 10 percent year upon year in the fi rst decade of the twentieth century. In Yamabe, a district in Chiba, such rates reached as high as 46 percent in the 1890s.38 Without even considering those abortions and infanticides that parents kept entirely off the books, or infanticides that they passed off as neonatal deaths, this implies that abortions and infanticides foreshortened the lives of about 40 percent of all children in Yamabe, the same range to which Edo-period statements and the simulation model point. By the 1890s, Yamabe was of course an outlier. As we shall see in later chapters, however, the geography of stillbirths implies that it was a holdout of the culture of infanticide rather than a recent aberration.39</p>
<p>Th</p>
<p>anks to the precise categories in which the stillbirth statistics are published, it is possible to calculate minimum estimates for how many of these were in fact late-term abortions and how many infanticides.40 While male fetuses are at a higher risk of dying in the womb of natural causes, induced abortions could not, before the dissemination of ultrasound technology in the late 1970s, discriminate against one sex. Abortions should therefore refl ect the sex ratio prevailing among fetuses. If reported stillbirths contain a large number of abortions, we would expect the reported sex ratio to be lower than if all reported stillbirths are genuine. Since the same logic applies to sex-blind infanticide, this approach cannot distinguish it from late-term abortions. Sex ratios for alleged stillbirths that are signifi cantly lower than that of fetuses, however, are diffi cult</p>
<p>to explain in the absence of sex-selective infanticide. To establish a minimum rate of infanticide, we now have to make an assumption about how many baby</p>
<p>17/04/13 3:54 PM</p>
<p>The Ghosts of Missing Children 121</p>
<p>boys were killed for every baby girl. Given what we know about infanticide in Japan, a ratio of one to two between male and female victims of infanticide is conservative.41 Th</p>
<p>e actual ratio was probably far closer to parity, but since the task at hand is the computation of a minimum, it is well to err on the side of caution. Once we assume a minimum sex ratio and a maximum rate for natural stillbirths, every sex ratio of reported stillbirths has a corresponding combination of defi nite infanticides and induced deaths that could have taken place on either side of birth.42</p>
<p>Th</p>
<p>ere are reasons to believe that a large fraction of fi ctitious stillbirths that by this logic could have been late-term abortions were in fact infanticides. In the 1920s, the forensic pathologist Okamoto Harimatsu compiled details on 320 abortion cases adjudicated by thirty-four local courts between 1899 and 1918. Of those fetuses whose age Okamoto was able to determine, fully 62 percent were aborted in the fourth, fi ft h, and sixth months of the pregnancy; fewer than 6 percent fell into the eighth, ninth, and tenth months, months that accounted for 84 percent of Japan’s fi ctitious stillbirths over the same years.43 Women unlucky enough to be tried for abortion were certainly not representative of all women who rid themselves of an unwanted pregnancy;44 however, there is no obvious reason why the abortions of women who were brought to trial should have been earlier than those of women who escaped such scrutiny.45 Okamoto’s fi gures are therefore at least consistent with the hypothesis that in the population overall, the overwhelming majority of abortions occurred in the fi rst two trimesters.</p>
<p>Th</p>
<p>ere are other grounds on which to doubt that late-term abortions were particularly frequent. Although second- and even third-trimester abortions had their advocates, others thought them more dangerous than either early abortions or infanticides.46 Susan Burns cites one abortion court case from 1877 in which an abortionist advised his patient that “an abortion would be diffi cult, since [she] was</p>
<p>already at least fi ve months pregnant.”47</p>
<p>If third-trimester abortions were indeed rare compared to interventions earlier in pregnancy, there are two possible explanations for the timing of fi ctitious stillbirths. One, those reported in the fi nal trimester may have been mostly infanticides rather than abortions. Two, many abortions in the fi rst and second trimester may never have entered the stillbirth statistics. Since the proportion of fi ctitious stillbirths in months eight to ten was fi ft een times greater than that of Okamoto’s abortion cases in the same months, in isolation the second explanation would imply that only one in fi ft een abortions before the end of the seventh month was reported as a stillbirth. Th</p>
<p>e two explanations—infanticides and unreported</p>
<p>early abortions—are not mutually exclusive, of course, and it is plausible that both played a role in the curious time pattern of fi ctitious stillbirths. For the time being, the precise breakdown of infanticides and abortions in Imperial Japan must therefore remain an open question.</p>

<p>The Ghosts of Missing Children 123</p>
<p>Th</p>
<p>is ambiguity also applies to the minority of stillbirths reported as having taken place in the fourth or fi ft h month, for it is far from certain that they all really happened so early in the pregnancy. Especially in the fi rst years of the twentieth century, several prefectures reported year aft er year that more female than male second-trimester fetuses were stillborn, a pattern not observed elsewhere in the world.48 Midwives and parents evidently agreed that by reporting a child they had killed as an early stillbirth rather than a full-term baby, they would dispel any suspicions.</p>
<p>While most infanticides were concealed as stillbirths, some were reported as early deaths.49 As with stillbirths, boys in other populations are usually at greater risk of unintended neonatal death than their sisters. As with stillbirths, the reverse pattern obtained in many parts of early-twentieth-century Japan. For example, in the 1914 statistics for the Northeastern prefectures of Iwate, Miyagi, and Akita, 1,582 boys and 1,803 girls died in the fi rst fi ve days of their extrauterine lives. If we add up all these categories for Eastern Japan, infanticides and abortions amounted to a minimum of about 9 percent of all pregnancies that would otherwise have resulted in a live birth in the early twentieth century (Figure 13).</p>

<p>Figure 14 summarizes the rate of infanticide implied by sex ratio distortions, the simulation model, and the stillbirth statistics. Th</p>
<p>ese proportions add up to very</p>
<p>large numbers. A rough calculation will suffi</p>
<p>ce to sketch out the magnitude. In</p>
<p>1750, Eastern Japan, as defi ned in this book, had about fi ve million inhabitants. If we assume for the moment that the Tōgoku dataset is roughly representative of Eastern Japan as a whole and multiply estimates for the population size of Eastern Japan with the rates of infanticide and abortion displayed in Figure 14, we obtain the following numbers: Th</p>
<p>e sex ratio distortions alone imply close to 1,900,000</p>
<p>infanticides between 1660 and 1750, and another 600,000 in the century thereafter. According to the simulation model, whose results lie consistently above 40,000</p>
<p>rejected children per year between the 1710s and the 1810s, between 8.5 and 10.5 million infanticides or abortions transpired in Eastern Japan between 1660</p>
<p>and 1870. Estimates for the 1870s and 1880s are perilous, but if, in a reckless moment, we interpolate the results of the simulation with those of the stillbirth analysis, we obtain a total of about half a million for those two decades. Aft er 1890, about 450,000 fi ctitious stillbirths are on record.50 Combined, these fi gures for infanticides and (mostly late-term) abortions for the years between 1660 and 1940</p>
<p>amount to between 10 and 12 million in Eastern Japan.</p>
<p>Figure 14 also illustrates one of the main story lines of this book. Th e percentage</p>
<p>of pregnancies that ended in an infanticide or an abortion entered a long decline in the 1790s, interrupted only by the hunger of the 1830s and the crop failures,</p>
