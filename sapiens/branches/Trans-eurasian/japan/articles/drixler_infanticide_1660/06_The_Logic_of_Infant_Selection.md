A woman who followed Eastern Japan’s fertility norm and raised only three children would still, on average, give birth about six times.1 As couples faced the decision of which newborns to keep and which to discard, they could draw on an elaborate system of evaluating the promise of each child. Th e needs of the household played an important role, but so did a cosmology that understood time as patterned with peril and promise. Parents tried to balance the genders of their children but also paid close attention to whether the sex of a birth matched their predictions and whether a child arrived at an auspicious moment. Th is system of 

optimizing the balance of genders in the household and designating days, months, and entire years as inauspicious for the birth of one or both sexes grew so luxuriant that a high proportion of all children came into this world with the wrong sex or at an unlucky time. Not all were killed, for there were ways to work around a bad omen and to adjust one’s ideal household composition. Yet the many grounds on which a newborn child could be declared ill fi tted to its household ensured that parents ambivalent about raising another child rarely wanted for an excuse to return it to the spirit world.

Unlike other systems of infanticide, Eastern Japan’s logic of infant selection did not consistently reject baby girls. Th

e sex of a child nonetheless mattered. In general, 

parents were the more likely to raise a newborn the fewer children of the same sex they already had.2 Although most parents seem to have wanted to raise at least one 91

child of each sex, the pursuit of the ideal household composition put female infants at a considerable disadvantage. In the decades when this pattern was the most pronounced, the 1710s to the 1740s, the extent of sex selection was dramatic \(Table 2\). Among mothers who already had two daughters but no son, nearly three went on raise a son for every one that raised another girl, producing a sex ratio of 289 boys for every 100 girls. Among mothers who already had two sons but no daughter, about two-thirds next raised a daughter, producing a sex ratio of 70. Th e 

extent of this pattern varied from decade to decade, and could produce extreme sex ratios ranging from 60 \(Figure 8b\) to 400 \(Figure 9\). In the early nineteenth century, its traces disappeared from the record. 

One possible motivation for this system of sex selection was a desire to plan for household succession.3 Most fathers passed their household headship to a son. However, a daughter could serve as an insurance policy: if the son, or sons, turned out to be incompetent or quarrelsome, the parents could bring a more likely young man into the household as a son-in-law and successor. Since adopted sons-in-law were oft en considerably older than their wives, such uxorilocal marriages also secured male labor for the household faster than waiting for the birth of a son. Some families preferred this form of marriage, relying on it generation aft er generation. Th ere are 

many such cases among distinguished merchant families, but this pattern also existed in less pecunious strata of society. Fathers who themselves appear in the registers as \(grand\)sons-in-law or adopted \(grand\)sons were unusually likely to have at least one girl in the family, the earlier, the better \(compare Table 3 to Table 4\). 

Not only the absolute number of older siblings, but also their sequence infl uenced infanticide choices \(Table 5\). Th

e sex ratio of chosen children born to 

parents of one son and one daughter—137—breaks down into 132 if the previous child was a boy and 145 if it was a girl. In other words, parents apparently liked to

e same logic worked for children with three 

older siblings. 

No textual source discusses the motivations behind this preference, but we may speculate that interspersing sons and daughters may have been attractive for the same reason that having only two or three children was: it had become part of a fertility norm, a notion of what an ideal family should look like. Perhaps the alternation of sons and daughters also struck parents as propitious. Th is attitude

features in a report from another reproductive culture, in the Chinese province of Fujian. From the hinterland of the port of Amoy, a British missionary reported in the 1840s that “the people esteemed it good luck” if “sons were alternately interspersed with daughters,” a circumstance that saved female children otherwise destined for infanticide.4

However clearly the sex-selective aspect of infanticide emerges from the demographic record, it is curiously muted in Edo-period analyses. A few texts mention the goal of balancing sons and daughters, and others note that girls were killed in larger numbers overall.5 Most, however, make no reference at all to the gendered dimension of infanticide. Th

is is even true for visual representations of infanticide. 

Among a hundred and fi ft y painted babies that die beneath their mothers knees, only three have visible genitalia.6

Beyond adapting the balance of genders to the needs of their household, parents attempted to sequence their chosen children in ways that off ered the best prospects for their future. In a particularly innovative fi nding, Robert Eng and Th omas 

Smith discovered that if a child died, the next child its parents recorded tended to have the opposite sex.7 In their study village of Asakusanaka \(“Nakahara”\) in Central Japan, a dead son was replaced by a baby girl, and a dead daughter by a baby boy, in fully forty out of fi ft y-fi ve cases. Perhaps parents took the death of a child as a sign that a superior power did not mean them to have a child of the particular sex in the present birth order, or feared the reincarnation of a soul that had already proved its weak hold on life. For a number of the villages that I analyze in this book, population registers remain for every year, permitting us to look for the same pattern. In four villages in southern Aizu, the pattern was just as strong as in Asakusanaka. In the eighteenth century, over 80 percent of births following a child’s death recorded the sex opposite of that of the deceased child.8 However, there is no such pattern in the nineteenth-century data from the same villages, and in fi ve villages in Nihonmatsu and Mito it was altogether invisible even in the eighteenth-century record.9 Th

is fi nding may understate how common the avoid-

ance of a recently deceased child’s sex was. Th

e reluctance to replace a dead child 

with another child of the same sex ran counter to a more intuitive attitude to sex selection, that of replacing a dead child with a child of the same characteristics. If the population was evenly split on which principle to prioritize, the eff ects would cancel out and elude simple detection. 

A panoply of other methods assessed the promise of a newborn child. Many of these were attempts to reveal the underlying patterns of time and the processes that determined a child’s sex. Parents divined whether their fetus was a boy or a girl and hesitated to raise a child that disappointed the prediction. Th ey tried to

avoid births in certain unlucky life years. And they consulted the complexities of the calendar in fi nding an auspicious time for a child to be conceived or born. 

Although there was loud disagreement about the merits of individual forms of divination, few men in the Edo period expressed fundamental doubts about attempts to foretell the future. By the late seventeenth century, congeries of diff erent traditions vied for the favor of clients. Chinese prognostication manuals appeared in annotated Japanese editions, and Japanese yin-and-yang masters \( *onmyōji*\), physiognomists, geomancers, dream readers, astrologers, and hexa-gram experts published their techniques in a newly vibrant market for books.10 

Buddhist priests oft en preferred to restrict their techniques to initiates, but similarly began to write them down for transmission to those chosen few.11

Th

e demand for prognostication arose at a historical moment when the growth of a commercial economy confronted people with a new world of choices. Choices can be empowering, but just as oft en they cause stress. A man whose grandfather may have planted a mix of grains and hemp every year now had to weigh the relative merits of indigo and saffl

ower, mulberry trees and konnyaku roots. If he 

had a little extra capital, he had to decide whether to acquire a struggling neighbor’s land, join a savings society, buy better farm tools, start a little brewing business, or take the year off and go on a pilgrimage. Lives in an earlier age were certainly not devoid of choices, but farmers probably faced many more such decisions beginning in the late seventeenth century. 

Farm manuals helped to create this world of choices and off ered themselves as guides to navigating its new complexity. Th

ey began to appear in large volumes at 

the same time as divination guides. One genre taught to read the visible world of soil, water, and crop varieties, while the other promised to reveal the invisible patterns of the cosmos.12 In another sense, farm manuals and divination guides spread the same message: the supreme importance of planning, timing, sequence, and matching. Farm manuals instructed readers in how to keep fi elds fertile through the correct sequence of crops, which was best planned years in advance. Th ey 

insisted on the correct matching of plant varieties to the soil, sunlight, and drain-age of individual fi elds. Th

ey urged farmers to combine crops that would not 

overlap in their peak labor demands and educated them about the ideal timing of tilling, sowing, fertilizing, weeding, and harvesting. Especially for farmers who raised silkworms, wonderfully profi table but fearfully delicate, a timing mistake of a single hour could spell ruin.13

Th

e farmer’s careful attention to planning, timing, sequence, and matching cultivated a mindset through habit and metaphor. Th

at the term *mabiki * could be 

equally applied to infanticide and radish cultivation suggests the mental proximity of raising crops and children.14 Men and women who believed that every plant had its perfect soil and season, that some crops should not follow each other on the same fi eld, and that a careless overlap stunted both could hardly leave the timing,

spacing, and sequencing of their boys and girls to unplanned chance.15 Once couples began investing a small number of children with the responsibility to secure their immortality, no decision was more important than the selection of the right infants.16 To pick the right children, they now consulted the pattern of time as well as a system of numerology that promised to reveal the compatibility of a child with a given moment in their own life.17

Th

roughout history, parents have regarded the sex of their unborn child with intense interest. In Japan, the sex of a child was thought to be determined by such factors as the precise circumstances of the preceding birth, the time of conception, and the month in which the woman noticed that her menstruation had stopped. 

Th

e infl uential sixteenth-century obstetrician Nakarai Akifusa taught that the sex of the child depended on the age of the mother: children both conceived and born during the mother’s life-years number 15, 17, 19, 23, 27, 28, 30, 32, 36, 38, 44, or 48 

would be female; children born in most other life-years would be male.18 While Nakarai’s method remained in use, a luxuriant variety of diff erent formulae developed that also took into account the father’s age. Generally, they added the ages of both parents and some other value, and then divided the sum by either two or three.19 Whether the sum was divisible without a remainder determined the sex of the child. In the case of division by three, this of course meant that one sex—

typically boys—was predicted with greater frequency. 

Other experts sought to read the sex of a fetus from nonmathematical evidence. 

Th

e ancient medical classic, *Ishinpō, * listed the pulse of the vein in the right or left hand, the gait of the pregnant woman when returning from a southern direction, and the combinations of the ages and zodiac signs of the parents as valid grounds for “telling male and female in the womb.” Katsuki Gyūzan cited these in his 1692 almanac for women, and noted in addition that an examination of the pregnant belly \(if soft , girl; if hard, boy\) or of the breasts indicated the sex of the fetus.20

When the prediction failed, the fault evidently lay with the child, not the divination master. In the words of the Tosa scholar Tani Shigetō, “Th ere is a type 

of fortunetelling that determines whether the child in the womb is male or female; if the child does not agree with the prediction, people say that it is a child that does not match \( *fusawanu*\) its parents, and kill it.”21 One divination manual predicted that such children would die at the age of three, six, or nine.22

Th

ere was a time when fetal sex modifi cation off ered a gentler solution. *Ishinpō* 

claimed that the sex of a fetus could be altered up to the third month of the pregnancy. In a novel by Ihara Saikaku published in 1692, a *yamabushi* ascetic works a  

17/04/13 3:54 PM

The Logic of Infant Selection 99

sex change on a female fetus just when her mother is about to enter labor. In the same year, however, Katsuki Gyūzan pointed out that according to the Ming-dynasty text *Yinchan quanshu, * the sex of the child was determined by the timing of intercourse, and that it could not be altered even if the pregnancy was only in its third month. Aft er Saikaku and Gyūzan, the topic of fetal sex change does not seem to have stirred much debate.23

In contrast, the belief that the sex of a fetus could be derived from circumstan-tial evidence had remarkable staying power. In the 1930s, folklorists found its expressions in all corners of Japan.24 Even Ogata Masakiyo, an infl uential obstetrician trained in German-style medicine at Tokyo Imperial, Jena, and Freiburg, believed that the relative ages of parents infl uenced the sex of a child.25 In his 1907 

*Family Hygiene for Ladies, * he stated that if a man was between one and ten years older than his wife, they would have more girls; if he was older by eleven years or more, they would have more boys. If the woman was twenty or younger, however, girls would predominate regardless of the husband’s age.26 Most husbands in Meiji Japan were at most a few years older than their wives, but Ogata did not explain how a system that so clearly favored female births could produce the roughly even number of boys and girls that his compatriots brought into the world. 

Back in the Edo period, sex divination was performed by midwives and male divination experts, who were oft en Buddhist priests or yamabushi ascetics. Parents could also make their own forecasts based on do-it-yourself manuals of magic, which are found in great numbers among the household documents of rural Japan. Th

e oldest datable guide of this kind was printed in 1611 and is therefore among the fi rst printed books of any kind in Japan.27 However, most fi rst editions in this genre date from the 1680s and 1690s. Apart from informing readers about sex divination, they gave instructions for a range of charms and spells to secure pregnancies or obtain divorces, to ward off thunder, thieves, and fi re, and to heal all manner of diseases. Others off ered recipes for removing grease stains and spells for speeding the departure of unwelcome guests, as well as charms to make pregnancies go away and an amulet that would act as a contraceptive if swallowed.28

Unsurprisingly, given the necessarily high failure rate of any divination formula, there was much disagreement on precise methods of prediction. By the time folklorists conducted a survey on this question in the 1930s, they found that relatively distant regions oft en shared a divination method, while as many as four diff erent formulae might compete in neighboring districts.29

Th

is diversity in space, which was probably complicated further by fashions changing over time, makes it diffi

cult to determine the precise extent to which sex 

divination aff ected decisions over life and death; the parallel use of contradictory formulae may have hidden the traces of their use in the demographic record. 

Th

e ancestors of people who told twentieth-century folklorists about their sex divination formulae behaved in ways consistent with these reports, but not enough  

17/04/13 3:54 PM

100 The Culture of Low Fertility

so to leave results of high statistical signifi cance.30 Th e search for the traces of 

Nakarai’s method suff ers from some of the same diffi

culties, since there was at least 

one other method for deriving fetal sex solely from the mother’s age and the timing of the birth. Nakarai’s method left suggestive, if inconclusive, patterns in Eastern Japan’s sex ratios. Mothers for whom Nakarai’s chart predicted a boy registered 10 percent more boys than girls, but only 7 percent more if a girl was predicted.31

In contrast to the cacophony of sex prediction methods, there was wide agreement on a small number of life-years during which conception and childbirth as well as any other important ventures were best avoided altogether. Th e concept of 

*yakudoshi, * as such years were known, * * fi rst appeared at the Heian court of the eleventh century. In the Edo period, yakudoshi were understood to be 25 and especially 42 for men, and 19 and especially 33 for women. Th e preceding \( *maeyaku*\) and 

following \( *nochiyaku*\) life-year also required caution. Th roughout the eighteenth 

and nineteenth centuries, many intellectuals ridiculed yakudoshi as a nonsensical superstition. Some pointed out that the Chinese classics did not mention yakudoshi, some noted that the peak of sexual lust around the major yakudoshi caused all sorts of disasters that had nothing to do with the precise life-year, and some concluded that the belief was a shrewd marketing device of diviners and spirit mediums. Nonetheless, yakudoshi were very widely observed, through pilgrimages and rituals as well as through an avoidance of risky behavior and a reluctance to begin new projects, such as an important business venture or a new child.32

Th

e potential eff ects of yakudoshi on procreation were enlarged by the fact that most pregnancies extended over more than a single life-year and that birth was not the last important milestone for becoming a human being. In particular, a child’s fi rst New Year’s Day was not supposed to coincide with the beginning of a parent’s yakudoshi.33 Th

e second shogun himself had his sister adopt a son of his at birth, since the child would have turned two in his father’s forty-second year.34 Tani Shigetō devoted an entire section of his 1719 analysis of infanticide to yakudoshi. 

He explained the superstition with the coincidental homophony of “four-two” 

\( *shi-ni*\) and “to die” \( *shini*\), and observed that “children born in such a year are killed due to a popular belief that they will harm their parents.”35 In his native Tosa, yakudoshi were still considered a reason for infanticide 150 years later.36 In Eastern Japan, a townsman, a shrine attendant, a priest, a scholar, and a rural astronomer all mentioned the forty-second yakudoshi as a motive for infanticide.37 As late as 1861, yakudoshi beliefs were still enough of a threat to infant lives in Western Honshu that a local priest asserted that “even if bad things happen \[in that year\], virtue prevails over inauspiciousness \( *fushō*\).”38

Yakudoshi beliefs have left traces in the demographic record, but as with sex prediction, they are less prominent than the descriptive sources imply. Infants with 33-year-old mothers or, at higher parities, 42-year-old fathers were about 15 percent rarer than they would have been in a smooth age schedule of fertility.39

Th

e role of numerology in infant selection has left some of its most remarkable traces in the diary of Tsunoda Tōzaemon, a successful merchant based in the mountains of Minamiyama Okurairiryō.40 Born in 1669 as a second son, Tōzaemon founded his own branch household and subsequently made a fortune exporting local hemp. In his best days, he dealt in hundreds of ryō worth of merchandise. His diary details how concerned he was about the children he chose to raise. For example, he off ered prayers at shrines and temples when his three-year-old daughter fell ill in 1693. When, in 1709, both his daughter of fi ve and his son of two seemed to turn the corner in their fi ght with smallpox, he celebrated by serving the festive dish of *sekihan *\(white rice with red beans\) * * and sending a gift of tea to all the women of his village. When the two-year-old boy nonetheless succumbed to smallpox, Tōzaemon recorded his grief in his otherwise sober diary. By this point, Tōzaemon had lost three children to disease but, apart from the surviving daughter, still had a living teenage son. At the end of the same year \(1709\), his wife, Otsuru, gave birth to a girl. Tōzaemon’s diary entry stated matter-of-factly: “My wife has had a safe delivery. \[We\] returned the child by force \( *ko wo oshikaesu*\).”41

Th

e year, already blighted by the death of his son, was Tōzaemon’s forty-second. 

Tōzaemon raised the next two children, a girl and a boy. At this point, he probably considered his family complete, for he named the boy Tomenosuke, written with the character for “stopping.” In 1716, he noted in his diary: “My wife has had a safe delivery; the child was in the womb in two diff erent calendar years; since it was supposed to be a girl but turns out to be a boy, \[we\] returned the child \( *ko kaesu*\). 

\[Th

e boy was born\] in the forty-fourth year \[of my wife’s life\].” According to Nakarai’s sex divination rules, a child conceived in a woman’s forty-third year and born in her forty-fourth should have been a girl. Th

is was the fi rst time Tōzaemon 

remarked on the prediction of a child’s sex; perhaps he had only come into contact with this idea sometime around 1710, two or three decades aft er instructions on how to predict the sex of a child had begun to circulate widely in print.42

In 1719, ten years aft er the fi rst infanticide mentioned in Tōzaemon’s diary, his wife Otsuru died. Tōzaemon remarried in 1722. In 1726, he recorded another infanticide in his diary: “My second wife had a safe delivery. She was pregnant since the eighth month of last year and gave birth in the ninth month \[of the pregnancy\]. As she is a woman in her forty-second year, we expected a boy but a girl was born, so we returned the child as a *tagaiko *\(mistaken child or changeling\).”43

In eighteenth-century Japan, calendar time was not uniform, but richly patterned with promise and peril. Japan’s basic system of marking absolute time—hours,

days, and years—was the Chinese zodiac of twelve animals combined with fi ve elements \(wood, fi re, earth, metal, and water\) in their yin and yang versions. Th e 

permutations of these components added up to cycles of sixty zodiac signs and opened endless possibilities for the science of determining the auspiciousness of years, days, and even hours. 

Th

e best-known inauspicious zodiac sign is * hinoeuma, * the yang-fi re horse. 

Even in the most recent year to bear this sign, 1966, Japan’s birth rate dipped sharply, as couples feared that the stigma of hinoeuma would leave their daughters unable to fi nd a spouse. Hinoeuma fi rst acquired a bad name when the thirteenth-century Chinese scholar Chai Wang compiled a record of eclipses, meteors, civil wars, and natural disasters in fi re-horse and fi re-sheep years.44 Th e belief that 

women born in the year of the yang-fi re horse would ruin their husbands was fi rst recorded in Japan in 1662.45 Subsequently, popular culture absorbed and amplifi ed this theme, not least through plays about murderesses and female arsonists born in hinoeuma years.46 By 1692, handbooks for women advised their readers to avoid births in hinoeuma years.47 By 1786, the prejudice must have been widespread, for a fi rst tract appeared urging people not to kill their newborn daughters in a hinoeuma year.48 So many people expected a surge of infant-killing in 1846 that in 1845 more than a dozen distinct pamphlets and posters argued against the custom.49 Th

ese materials were far from universally successful, however. Imperial Japan published its fi rst detailed age structures in 1886. In that year, abnormally few women claimed to be between thirty-nine and forty-one years old, the decimated survivors of the hinoeuma year of 1846.50

Th

eories about other zodiac signs were propounded with much enthusiasm and some inconsistency. Children born in ox years wanted to be their parents’ 

senior child and would therefore kill their elder brothers and sisters.51 Women born in years of the yang-fi re tiger were thought to be domineering, and tigers more generally were considered too roving and restless to settle down in marriage.52 Boys born when a tiger year overlapped with the ascendancy of the Goō “planet” would have good fortune, but girls would not. From the mid–Edo period, snake, horse, monkey, and rooster came to be considered unlucky in their combinations, so that children conceived in a snake year and born in a horse year, for example, were said to have especially bad fortunes.53 A Chinese medical text, however, pronounced all horse children to be destined for spiritual and material well-being.54 Among the fi ve elements, water, fi re, and metal were respectively associated with fl ood, confl agration, and violence.55 It was a rare child indeed that drew its fi rst breath in a year that no expert had declared ominous. 

Because of the sheer number of diff erent zodiac signs as well as the profusion of confl icting theories, their salience to the decision of whether to raise a child is diffi cult to establish statistically. Women registered more children in wood and earth years than in years of the three supposedly dangerous elements.56 Any number of

other fi gures can be produced that seemingly match some part of the discursive record. It is well to treat them with caution; with all the possible combinations of zodiac signs, even a random distribution of male and female births is likely to produce pairs with apparently consistent and statistically signifi cant sex ratio patterns. 

Another diffi

culty is that not just years, but also days and hours could be inauspicious for conceptions or births. Since the Tōgoku dataset states ages only in years, it does not permit the search for the eff ects of these smaller units of time. 

Textual sources attest that a range of properties and events could render a day unfi t for conception or birth. One nineteenth-century handbook warned against the death days of ancestors, eclipses, thunderstorms, sudden darknesses, the fi rst and last day of the month, and the third, seventh, and twenty-second day of each lunar cycle.57 Th

e ancient but enduringly infl uential *Ishinpō* cited an even longer list of days and months during which sexual intercourse should be avoided.58 Th e 

Ming Chinese medical text *Qianjinfang, * a popular reference work in the Edo-period, counseled against intercourse on all fi re \( *hinoe* and *hinoto*\) days, that is, for a full fi ft h of the year.59 A popular seventeenth-century almanac, Inō Kōken’s * *

*Inagokusa, * defi ned fully two-thirds of the year as inappropriate for intercourse. 

Another book in this genre, the *Onna chōhōki, * advised readers how to determine whether a newborn child was “good or bad” depending on the month of its birth.60 

Other manuals warned parents that intercourse on certain days would result in unfi lial, short-lived, or sickly children, and could even sicken the couple or make them both “vomit blood and die.”61

Conceptions on *kanoesaru* \(yang-metal monkey, also pronounced *kōshin*\) days were feared to such an extent that they inspired a whole dimension of sociability. Because of the double-metal connotation of kanoesaru, children conceived on such nights were said to grow up to become thieves.62 To make sure no children were sired, entire village communities would spend such nights in gregarious eating, drinking, and storytelling, sometimes, but not always, segregated by sex.63 Avoiding conceptions was not the only motivation for kanoesaru wakes. Initially, they were a response to the Daoist notion that three worms were trapped in the body. Since only their host’s death would allow them to escape for good, they tried their best to shorten his or her life. On kanoesaru nights, they could briefl y leave a sleeping host. Th ey would ascend to 

Heaven and relate his sins, hoping to provoke Heaven’s fatal retribution. A variety of related beliefs sprang from this root. Some claimed that intercourse rather than chaste sleep would liberate the worms on kanoesaru nights. Others substituted the Daoist worms with the three monkeys of see-nothing, hear-nothing, say-nothing fame, based on the pun of *zaru* \(not\) and *saru* \(monkey\). 

A witty verse had it that “if you include *sezaru *\(‘not doing it’\), there are four monkeys \( *saru*\) in kanoesaru.”64

An 1857 kabuki play includes a dialogue in which one man confesses that he abandoned his fi rst-born son who was born on a kanoesaru day, since a priest foretold that he would become a thief.65 While the action of the play was set in the twelft h century, the role of the Buddhist priest may have been typical of the Edo period. 

Although some of the key leaders in the fi ght against infanticide emerged from the ranks of the Buddhist clergy, the majority of the tens of thousands of rural priests seem to have participated in the culture of careful child selection. As they are to this day, temples were a major source of printed calendars as well as personal horoscopes. Manuals of magic may have been available in many villages of the eighteenth century, but only a handful of villagers had the literacy to unlock their secrets. Priests, however, oft en owned such handbooks and in addition had their own esoteric traditions of magic, which ranged from healing to sex divination; in the case of the Sōtō sect of Zen, priests passed these to their sons and disciples on special notes called *kirigami. *

It may have been the management of dead souls that fi rst drew priests into divining the sex of unborn children. Th

e death of a pregnant woman not only was 

a tragedy for her family, but also threatened to leave behind restless spirits. While ritual technologies could facilitate a calmer fate for the souls of the dead, they required the priest to fi rst ascertain the sex of the unborn child. Th e formulae used 

for this purpose were structurally identical to the popular addition and division procedures mentioned earlier, and there can be little doubt that priests were equally happy to diagnose the sex of a fetus in a living womb.66

Elites sometimes castigated parents who killed their children for “superstitious” 

reasons, but very few fundamentally disagreed with the underlying notion of time. 

Several pamphlets against the killing of infants in hinouema years urged couples to avoid intercourse on hinoeuma \(yang-fi re horse\) *days. * 67 Another opponent of infanticide tried to argue that hinoeuma years were actually an excellent time for childbirth. Th

e yang force, you see, was strong in hinoeuma, since both of its components belonged to the south.68 Arai Nobuaki, whose poetic commentary about silkworm stelae we encountered in Chapter 3, included the following line in his collection of poems against infanticide: “A child that turns into a thief has it origin in getting pregnant on a kanoesaru night.”69

If a doubtful horoscope or the wrong sex could turn parents against a newborn, obvious deformities placed the infant’s life in acute peril. A wide range of presentations at birth were considered deformities. For example, children with umbilical cords around their necks were believed to be destined for death by hanging.70

Children born with teeth were called “devil children” \( *onigo*\).71 Premature babies were routinely killed.72 Th

e bias against birth defects of any kind was only intensifi ed by the widespread notion that they were the result of infi delity.73 Twins, too, were oft en considered a sure sign that their mother had mixed the seed of several men.74

Twins roused disgust for other reasons.75 Although as early as 1702 Confucian scholars expounded on the auspiciousness of twins, popular discourse long saw them as blurring the line between human births and animal litters. Mothers of twins were derided as having “animal pregnancies.”76 Andō Shōeki, a doctor in northern Honshu now famous as a philosopher, considered twins a pathological deformity and thought that mothers of quadruplets \(admittedly, not a numerous sisterhood\) were literally animals \( *kinjū*\).77 Parents of multiple births frequently resorted to infanticide to put themselves on the right side of the boundaries between humans and animals.78 One ward of Kōriyama, the major market town of Nihonmatsu, recorded 6,162 births between 1708 and 1870. All of its fi ft y-eight twin births were recorded aft er 1795.79 Experience may have supported the view that twinning was an ill omen. Twins that escaped infanticide had far higher mortality rates than singletons. Of the fi ft y-eight twins in the Kōriyama ward, twenty-four died within the fi rst fi ve years of life. Th

is was a mortality rate 1.5 times as high as that of their singleton neighbors, even though Nihonmatsu paid lavish subsidies to parents of twins.80

While numerology and patterned time frequently appear in accounts of infanticide, their traces are faint in the demographic record. Th

is is even true for yakudoshi. 

Th

ese ill-omened years are not accompanied by the confounding factors that render the statistical study of horoscopes and sex prediction so diffi cult; in the Tōgoku 

dataset, however, they only led to a surprisingly moderate reduction of births. One possible explanation for this apparent disagreement between the descriptive and the quantitative sources is that numerology and patterned time primarily supplied parents who did not want to raise a particular child on other grounds with an additional justifi cation; given the ill-starred life that lay ahead, they could tell themselves, sending the little being back to the spirit world was ultimately for its own good. On the other hand, parents who wanted to raise a child could fi nd ways to override an unpromising prediction. 

Even at the height of Eastern Japan’s culture of infant selection, many children were allowed to live despite the unlucky signs of their birth. Tsunoda Tōzaemon’s diary records that his son raised a boy even though he thought him a *tagaiko, * a child that contradicted the sex prediction. Luckily for the boy, he was born under a zodiac sign that Tōzaemon, somewhat unusually, thought worthy of mention in his diary.81 Even if no such mitigating circumstances existed, a number of strategies could turn a bad omen into a reasonably promising future. In China, a well-chosen

name could compensate for a degree of confl ict between the dominant elements of the child’s horoscope and that of his parents’.82 Japanese parents seem to have invested naming with the same power, but with a twist. In the 1710s, Terajima Ryōan, a doctor and naturalist, observed that “if children are born in the forty-fi rst year \[of their father’s life\], they are called ‘two- *sai*-children of forty-two’ and as such abhorred. People give them diff erent surnames and make them the children of other people.”83 Another way to change the parentage of the child was to stage a mock abandonment. Families with a poor record of infant survival, or parents who had given birth at an inauspicious time, would abandon the child to have it picked up by friends or relatives. Th

ese *hiroi-oya * would eventually return the foundling to its birth parents.84 Another option was to pretend that the child was born on a diff erent day.85 One memoir recollected that “in the 1st year of Ansei, 12th month, 25th day, 4th hour \[i.e., February 11, 1855\], my wife safely delivered a boy. I was in my 41st year *. *‘A child that enters his second year in the 42nd year of his father is a bad thing,’ we agreed. ‘Let us not raise him \( *okan*\).’ My mother stopped us, saying, ‘I shall bring him up.’ By pretending that the boy had been born eight days later, that is on the 2nd day of the 2nd year of Ansei, we avoided calamity.”86

Perhaps a child’s fate could be rearranged by such expedients. Th at they were 

necessary in the fi rst place, however, suggests how large numerology and timing loomed in the minds of many parents.

If considerations such as budgets, child spacing, and the wish to ensure the future of the stem line gave parents a basic sense of how many children they wanted at roughly what points of their lives, sex divination, the calendar, and even the ideal sequence of boys and girls primarily determined which individual children they would raise, rather than how many.87 To the extent that parents heeded inauspicious sexes, years, and days, these had the combined eff ect of increasing the intervals between births, which in turn had clear benefi ts for the parents. Mothers found it diffi cult enough to 

reconcile their productive work with caring for a small child. With longer intervals, older children could help with minding their younger siblings. Later, when their younger sibling was still of little use around the house, they could stabilize the household economy by working alongside their parents. Having children in rapid succession, conversely, meant that for many years, the household would have a lot of mouths to feed relative to its active workforce. In the words of a popular saying, “if you have three baldies \( *kaburo*\) \[that is, small children\], they will eat you into ruin.”88

For the chosen children, infant selection had even greater advantages. Not only did it reduce competition for their parents’ emotional and economic resources, both during childhood and at the time of inheritance; even more** **important, long intervals gave the lucky infants undisturbed access to the most critical resource of

their early lives: breast milk. In European populations before the mid–twentieth century, breastfeeding and the child’s age at weaning were by far the most important determinants of infant mortality.89 In Japan, it was common for mothers to nurse even their toddlers.90

Th

e benefi ts of long breastfeeding for the child seem to have been well understood in the Edo period. Before pasteurization, breast milk was the only safe and nutritionally complete baby food. Since Japanese farmers kept neither sheep nor goats and milked neither their cows nor their mares, even the \(risky\) animal substitutes used in other parts of the world were not available. In the 1870s, some of the men who draft ed measures against infanticide reserved a prominent place for newly introduced Western milk cows in their designs.91 Decades earlier, Mito tried to get around the limited supply of breast milk through technological innovation, with uncertain success: From 1813, it distributed an ersatz “milk powder” to indigents unable to lactate, and forwarded a recipe for “Echigo milk” to headmen and instructed them to teach it to the poor.92 

Th

e only real alternative to breast milk was to hire a wet nurse. Hashizume Bin, who wrote about infanticide in Tosa, thought that people whose family budgets were in good order would be willing to do this for their fi rst and second child. Aft er that, they would “chafe under the cost” and not raise any further children.93 Among the poor, the loss of a lactating woman spelled disaster for her child. In 1813, the thirty-four-year-old wife of a destitute Sendai villager named Rokuta gave birth to a boy. In a heart-rending application for childrearing subsidies, the headman wrote that Rokuta’s wife had been ill ever since the birth of her son and unable to nurse him. 

Rokuta went around “day and night” among his neighbors and even to nearby villages collecting donations of small amounts of fresh breast milk. Th e hope of the headman 

seems to have been that a subsidy could allow Rokuta to hire a foster mother.94

Th

e wish to breastfeed one’s chosen children properly recurs in analyses of the culture of infanticide. One commoner offi

cial in Sendai’s childrearing system, 

Heinosuke, noted that people would kill a newborn boy if his older brother was still too small.95 Sendai’s dialect had a word for a child that was killed for a lack of milk. In Kuroha Jirōemon’s typology of infanticidal parents \(see Chapter 5\), nursing overlaps were one of fi ve main motives.96 Th

e infanticide countermeasures of 

Takada domain included a provision that employers had to structure work schedules in a way that allowed maids to nurse their children at least three times a day.97 Takada thereby implied that even maids would rather kill their children than raise them without proper breastfeeding. In applications for subsidies in the childrearing systems, the diffi

culty of obtaining suffi

cient milk makes a frequent 

appearance, and it was also cited during infanticide trials in the Meiji period. 

Susan Burns relates a court case from the 1870s whose defendants testifi ed that they killed a newborn girl because her mother was still nursing a little boy and would not have been able to feed both infants successfully.98

108 The Culture of Low Fertility

Th

e aversion to rearing children in rapid succession must have been based on bitter experience. Demographic studies in developing countries have consistently identifi ed short birth intervals as one of the best predictors of higher mortality risks for both the preceding and the subsequent child, frequently doubling the risk.99 While nursing is a key factor, the patterns persist even in studies that control for breastfeeding and prematurity. Th

ere has been a deal of debate about the mech-

anisms that underlie the birth interval eff ect, in particular on whether it derives from maternal depletion or sibling competition. In a breastfeeding culture like Japan’s, either explanation implies that an infanticide would have secured the chosen children most of the benefi ts they would have enjoyed if their mother had not become pregnant with another sibling. Infanticide not only removes sibling competition, but it also frees the mother from breastfeeding another child. Breastfeeding accounts for a much greater part of maternal depletion than pregnancy, since day for day lactation requires more additional calories as well as greater increments of sixteen out of twenty-two essential micronutrients.100

Luckily for the chosen children of Eastern Japan, only 1.8 percent of them had parents who recorded another birth in the calendar year aft er theirs.101 Th ere were 

two reasons for the long intervals between chosen children. First, lactational amenorrhea suppresses ovulation for a median length of one and a half years in women who breastfeed vigorously; in the Edo period, this mechanism seems to have been widely understood. Extended breastfeeding could therefore be motivated by both the wish for a healthy child and the desire to postpone the next pregnancy.102 Second, the fact that so many children were born under inauspicious circumstances meant that a couple’s chosen children were not necessarily the fi rst two or three. Th

e manifold grounds on which a newborn could be rejected 

meant that infanticides oft en resulted in sparser spacing of children rather than just in early stopping of childrearing. 

By spacing children more comfortably and discarding sickly infants, the aggressive selection of newborns may have contributed to the relatively low post-infanticide infant mortality rate of the Edo period. Even documents that were specifi cally designed to account for infant lives—the pregnancy surveillance reports of the nineteenth century—typically recorded infant deaths at a rate of less than 20 percent.103 Th

is placed Eastern Japan in the same range as the more salubrious parts of Europe and China.104 Th

e better survival outcomes in families that 

selected their infants carefully would have backed up the claims of the divination experts that they were able to identify the most promising children. Parents who followed their advice would have grieved over fewer children who died aft er an attachment had formed.105 Th

e reduced burden of childrearing would have made 

them more economically successful. It would have been hard for such couples not to conclude that in shaping the best possible future for their households, they did well to fi rst chart it with every available forecasting device.
