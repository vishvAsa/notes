Until 1872, all dates are given in the Japanese lunar calendar, with Common Era \(c.e.\) years understood to last from the beginning of the roughly corresponding lunar year to its end. 

Japanese names are given family name fi rst, other than where English publications by Japanese authors reverse the order. Individuals who are known under a range of diff erent personal names appear consistently under the name that is most familiar in the larger literature, even when they did not use that particular name in the relevant period of their lives. 

Unfamiliar Japanese words are italicized at their fi rst appearance but not thereaft er.

map 3. Territories of Eastern Japan, approximate borders of 1867. \(Th e map is illustrative 

in two senses. Boundaries of some domains, such as Shirakawa and Taira, changed considerably over the centuries of the Edo period. For large parts of the Kantō, translating the reality of rule into a map of this scale is diffi

cult, since neighboring villages could be 

ruled by lords headquartered hundreds of miles apart, and even single villages were oft en divided between multiple lords.\)
