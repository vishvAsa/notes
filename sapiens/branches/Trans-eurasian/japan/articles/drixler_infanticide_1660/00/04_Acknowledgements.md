At the beginning of this project, I knew little of the hypnotic power of documents and databases. I also had no notion of the many debts I would incur. It is a pleasure to acknowledge some of them here. 

During my doctoral years at Harvard, Andrew Gordon formed my sensibilities, catalyzed my ideas, and encouraged my conceptual ambitions. Henrietta Harrison energized me in long conversations and has improved this book at every level with her clear-eyed advice. Over many sunlit mornings in her offi ce at MIT, Anne 

McCants tutored me in demographic history and later helped me formulate some of the key insights of this book. Th

roughout, she has been a role model of profes-

sional generosity. Dani Botsman has shaped this project from beginning to end with his gift for constructive criticism, fi rst as a member of my dissertation committee and more recently as my senior colleague at Yale. Early on, a conversation in his offi

ce helped me set the project’s parameters, and the structure of this book owes much to his incisive rethinking of the purely thematic chapters of the dissertation. 

During my research in Japan, Kawaguchi Hiroshi and his colleagues hosted me at Tezukayama University. His high standards of critical thinking have long since turned into an inner dialogue for me: “Would this convince Kawaguchi-sensei?”

Kurosu Satomi gave important assistance especially during the early stages of this project, and her work on the Own-Children Method has been an inspiration for my own eff orts.

publications I could not even have posed my initial research questions, welcomed me to their Shinjuku offi

ce and loaned me eleven villages from their great hoard of 

“Basic Data Sheets.” When, years later, the fi nal revisions spilled into a stay at Waseda University, Ōhashi Yukihiro and the members of his *zemi * were gracious hosts and insightful interlocutors. 

Back in the United States, David Howell shared a conference paper that shaped my *mondai ishiki * early on. Susan Burns organized a workshop that launched my attempts at Edo-period paleography. More recently, both of them traveled to New Haven and helped me make critical improvements to the manuscript. James Lee welcomed me into the world of historical demography. David Ambaras pushed me to reexamine my impression that infanticide receded to the margins of society aft er 1880. Mark Metzler made me critically rethink my argument about the economics of infanticide and helped me refi ne the manuscript with wonderfully detailed feedback. Peter Perdue, among his many other contributions, found solutions to two key problems: the presentation of the microdemographic analysis and the placement of the twentieth-century material. Kären Wigen helped me reconceive the dissertation as a book and sustained me through a long revision process with her mentorship. Valerie Hansen has watched over this project from a time when it had fewer chapters than it now has parts, and has shaped its course with invaluable advice. 

Many other scholars have shared their time and ideas with me, including Mark Auslander, the much-missed Hal Bolitho, Al Craig, Hamano Kiyoshi, Helen Hardacre, Hiroshima Kiyoshi, Isoda Michifumi, Michelle King, Kitō Hiroshi, Kondō Shigekazu, Kurushima Hiroshi, Miura Shigekazu, Murayama Satoshi, Nakao Ryōshin, Nemoto Haruko, Ōtsu Tadao, Sawayama Mikako, Saitō Osamu, Ellen Schattschneider, Takahashi Shin’ichi, Joanna Handlin Smith, Suzuki Jun, Takagi Masao, Yuki Terazawa, Toishi Nanami, and Tomobe Ken’ichi. 

Th

e various stages of the manuscript have benefi ted from the critiques of readers whose insights would take an extra chapter to acknowledge properly. Th ey 

are Dani Botsman, Susan Burns, Paul Bushkovitch, Lindsay Dow, Valerie Hansen, David Howell, CJ Huang, William Johnston, Kate Lynch, Sara McDougall, Mark Metzler, Peter Perdue, Bardwell Smith, Carrie Th

iessen, Adam Tooze, Brian 

Turner, Kären Wigen, Robert Wyman, and an anonymous reviewer for UC Press. 

Few pages of this book could have been written without the labors of local historians and curators in Japan. While my encounters with most of them have taken place in the pages of their publications and archival catalogues, some have obliged me in person. Jingū Yoshihiko took me on a four-day tour of temples and shrines in Gunma. Chiba Nobutane of Hiraizumi showed me his family documents. 

Other municipal offi

cers, especially in Hitachi Ōta, Iide, Marumori, Shōnan, and Utsunomiya, helped me locate materials or confi rmed their loss. Aft er the Kyūdenji scroll, pictured on the book cover, was lost in the tsunami of 2011, Sasaki Atsushi

donned a headlamp to fi nd the last surviving negative in the ruins of the Ishinomaki Bunka Center. In addition, my study of scrolls and tablets was made possible by Nōtomi Jōten of Sōjiji and the owners of chapels in Doppara, Ujiie, and Tsutsumidai; shrine attendants in Hokkitsu and Haba; and the priests of Banshū 

Kiyomizudera, Daienji, Guzeiin, Hōrinji, Jōsenji, Kichijōji, Kikusuiji, Kyūdenji, Ontokuji, Rakumanji, Tokumanji, Shinkōji, and Sōkeiin. A dozen curators shared their expertise and facilitated my access to sources at the prefectural museums of Fukushima, Ibaraki, Iwate, and Tochigi; the city museums of Hitachi, Ichinoseki, Ōta, Sakura, and Sendai; and the National Museum of Japanese History. 

Archivists and librarians oft en went beyond the call of duty in answering my questions and humoring my gluttonous requests. Th

ey include staff at the Tōhoku 

History Museum; the National Archives in Tokyo; the prefectural archives and/or libraries of Akita, Aomori, Chiba, Fukushima, Gunma, Ibaraki, Niigata, and Tochigi; the city libraries of Mito and Aizuwakamatsu; and the libraries of the universities of Gunma, Harvard, Hokkaidō, Ibaraki, Juntendō, Kinki, Kyoto, Tezukayama, Tōhoku, Waseda, and Yale, as well as the Library of Congress and the National Diet Library. Th

rough their volunteers in Woodbridge and Salt Lake City, the Family History Library loaned me microfi lms during a fi nal bout of data entry. 

For years of extraordinary helpfulness, I am particularly indebted to Kuniko McVey, Ellen McGill, Ellen Hammond, and Haruko Nakamura. 

Th

e quantitative leg of this project would have been all but impossible without the mental agility and meticulous effi

ciency of Lin Cunyang, who performed the 

fi rst round of data entry for 1,500 of the published population registers in my dataset. For helping me discover new uses for my data, I am grateful to the organizers and faculty of a workshop at the University of Michigan’s ICPSR, especially George Alter. Lex Berman taught me the basics of ArcGIS, opening the door to new analytic possibilities and to many months of agonizing over how to fi t the realities of Tokugawa Japan into the cartographic categories of the present. An old friend, George Ehrhardt, wrote the Python code for the Monte Carlo simulation in Chapter 7. 

A series of grants has fi nanced this project over the years. At Harvard, it was funded by the History Department, GSAS, the Reischauer Institute, the Asia Center, the Weatherhead Center, and an Eliot Fellowship. Th e Japan Foundation made 

possible a year of itinerant research in Japan. At Yale, I thank the Council on East Asian Studies, the MacMillan Center, and the Morse Fellowship for their funding, as well as the History Department, which held a publication colloquium for me toward the end of 2010. Th

e Frederick W. Hilles Fund has helped defray the costs 

of publication. 

A series of communities sustained me during the years of research, writing, and revision. At Harvard, friends and fellow graduate students made the dissertation years a happy time of discovery and inspiration. Th

history did not always light sparks of rapt interest in their eyes has, I hope, made this a better book. For favors that improved it directly, I thank Raja Adal, Pär Cassel, Konrad Lawson, and Li Haihong; many others contributed indirectly with their intellectual companionship and collegiality. At Yale, graduate and under-graduate students have helped me see the material from new angles, and balanced my intellectual life by thinking through completely diff erent historical problems with me. At the History Department, the Council on East Asian Studies, and in other parts of Yale, I have been blessed with an extraordinary group of colleagues who have inspired me with their own high standards and smoothed my path with kindnesses great and small. Among my friends in Japan, two couples, Adachi Michiko and Tadashi and Hitomi Akemi and Tatsuo, made their houses a home away from home for me, and supported me in ways that make it impossible to imagine the years of research for this book without their friendship. 

At UC Press, Reed Malcolm and Stacy Eisenstark guided me with grace and good humor during many months of cutting old chapters and building new simulation models. Rose Vekony managed the production process with professional-ism and fl exibility. Anne Canright’s eagle eye and exceptional helpfulness made the copy-editing process unexpectedly enjoyable. 

Whether in our shared study or on diff erent continents, my wife has watched my unfolding obsessions with aff ectionate good humor. Although her own interests center elsewhere, she has also been one of my most perceptive readers and editors. 

I dedicate this book to my parents and to Robert Wyman. If it were not for the three of them, it would not exist.
