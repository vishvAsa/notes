The single most comprehensive source on the infanticide countermeasures of the Edo period is the work of Takahashi Bonsen, *Datai to mabiki no kenkyū* and his magisterial three-volume *Nihon jinkōshi no kenkyū*. In addition, the list draws on the following sources: 1. Works by individual authors: Chiba, “Akago yōikuhō no hottan”; Endō, “Aizu-han”; Hironaga, “Tsushima-han”; Honjō, “Rakuō-kō,” “Ōu shohan,” “Shirakawa-han,” “Ikushisaku shiryō,” and *Nihon jinkōshi; * Chichibu Ōmiya-gō Murayakunin, *Satsuji kyōsei kokoroe* \(1863\); Kalland, *Tokugawa Fishing Villages, * 256–257; Kalland and Pedersen, “Famine and Population in Fukuoka Domain”; Kodama, *Kinsei nōmin seikatsushi, * 268, 275; Kusano, *Shiryō de miru onnatachi, * 120–134, 150–155; Matsueda, *Aizu-han; * Mizuno, “Kazusa, Shimōsa”; Narimatsu, *Edo jidai no Tōhoku nōson, * 47; idem, *Edo jidai no nōson no kurashi,* 122–125; Nishigai, “Edo kōki no nyoninkō,” 164; Ohara, “Sendai-han”; Ooms, *Charismatic* *Bureaucrat, * 57–59; Ravina, *Land and Lordship, * 78–79; Sakurai, “Mabiki to datai,” 104–106; Sawayama, “Sendai hanryō-nai,” *Shussan to shintai, * and *Sei to seishoku; * Kikuchi, “Shichigashuku”; Tabata, “Kōhai suru nōson,” 85–88; Takahashi, “Kinsei no jinkō shisaku”; Yatabe, “Akago yōiku shihō ni tsuite”; Yokota, “Karatsu-han”; and Yoshimi, “Sendai-han.”

Local histories \(omitting many that confi rm or elaborate the information in the sources above\): *Annaka shishi 2, * 556–557, and *5, * 49; *Chiba kenshi Meiji-hen, * 487–488; *Chichibu* *shishi, * 308–312; *Chōkai chōshi, * 538–540; *Fukushima shishi 7, * 561, and * 8, * 579–581; *Haga chōshi* *tsūshihen Kinsei, * 754, 771, 858; *Iwaki shishi 9, * 394–395; *Kahoku*- *chō no rekishi jō, * 759–760; *Kanuma shishi shiryōhen Kinsei 1, * 307–309; *Karasuyama chōshi, * 210; *Katsuda shishi* *Chūseihen Kinsei-hen, * 852; *Kōriyama shishi 3, * 67–72; *Kurobane chōshi, * 328–329; *Kurume* *shishi 2, * 327–328; *Minamikawachi chōshi shiryōhen 3, * 940–942; *Mito shishi chū 2, * 593–595; *Mōka shishi 3, * 273–288; *Naraha chōshi 1, * 376–381; *Saga shishi 2, * 621–622; *Sakura shishi 2, * 140; *Shinjō shishi 3, * 41–42, 423–424; *Tōwada chōshi 2, * 305–308; *Ushiku shishi Kinsei, * 383–385; and *Yamamoto chōshi, * 331–333. Th

is list is limited to sources on the inception of policies and is not exhaustive; most local histories in Eastern Japan discuss the infanticide countermeasures of the late Edo period and many have published some of the sources these generated.

9. See also the observation of an offi

cial in Sakura domain that in the villages of Chiba 

district, infanticides occurred rarely among people suff ering extreme poverty, while in other parts of the domain slightly farther to the east, even many middling farmers would only bring up two children. Yamazaki, *Zonnensho *\(1834\). 

10. In certain periods and regions, population registers did not list ages, and some simply stated the number of people in each household rather than listing them separately, but neither format has been used for this book. 

11. See chapter 1 of my dissertation, “Infanticide and Fertility,” where I also discuss the origins of population registers and their limitations as a source and point to the assessments of other historians. See also Hayami and Cornell, “Th

e Shūmon Aratame Chō.” 

12. In the longer East Asian tradition of population registration, the Ming system seems to have been an example of the fi rst kind, the Qing system an example of the second. When a famine broke out in northern Hubei in 1778, the number of people applying for relief exceeded the local population by a hundred thousand. To his consternation, the emperor in Beijing soon discovered that some county offi

cials had simply invented plausible numbers 

based on the returns from an earlier year \(Ho, *Studies on the Population of China, * 47\). In Japan, too, not all registration systems worked well. Aft er 1756, Morioka domain reported the number of its subjects as unchanged year upon year, even as horrifi c famines emptied its villages. Apparently, Morioka falsifi ed its headcount to hide the eff ects of famine from the shogunate and thereby escape the charge of misrule. See Kikuchi, *Kinsei no kikin, * 65. 

13. At least some domains, such as Uwajima in Shikoku and Yonezawa, kept separate population registers for warriors. See Hamano, *Rekishi jinkōgaku de yomu Edo Nihon,* 141–143; and Watanabe, *Kinsei bukechi no jūmin to yashiki kanri, * chap. 5.

17. Most of the materials in local histories are not presently available in archives. Th e 

private owners, in the case of village documents oft en the descendants of former headmen, made these materials available to the compilers of the local histories and then returned to guarding them as family treasures. 

18. Th

e national TFR was 5.1 in 1925, 4.7 in 1930, and 3.6 in 1950. In 1930, no prefecture outside the eastern half of Honshu—that is, no prefecture west of Niigata and Chiba—had a TFR above 5.5, while, with the exception of Gunma and Ibaraki, all of eastern Honshu exceeded that level.

comprise the entire population of seven prefectures; unlike the village sample, this includes all of Shimōsa and excludes southern Akita and southern Iwate. Th e eff ect of these compromises is probably slight, since in the relevant decades the TFRs for Iwate and Akita were only very slightly higher than those of Miyagi, Yamagata, and Fukushima.

24. Hayami, “Population Changes,” 281–290, surveys earlier debates about whether the Demographic Transition Th

eory describes Japan’s experience. For a defense of the theory’s applicability to Japan, see Mosk, “Demographic Transition in Japan.” 

25. To my knowledge, this was fi rst stated by Saitō Osamu in “Jinkō hendō,” 35–39. 

26. Tuberculosis had claimed an ever-increasing number of lives in the early twentieth century. See Johnston, *Th*

27. Even from the point of view of the fetus, the diff erence between a late-term abortion and a neonaticide is not necessarily large enough to place the two timings of death on opposite sides of a great ontological divide. Be that as it may, this book does not pretend to take the point of view of fetuses and infants, but tries to understand the mental categories of their parents. 

28. Th

is is true for forty-nine of the fi ft y-seven cultures surveyed in Minturn and Stashak, “Infanticide.” At least thirty of the fi ft y-seven cultures gave social sanction to infanticide. Arguably, even Christian infant baptism is a ritual that makes a newborn a member of the human community. For an excellent survey of ritual milestones and diff ering defi nitions of when fetuses or infants become human beings, as well as an evolutionary hypothesis on how humans came to diff erentiate between infants to be raised and infants to be discarded, see Hrdy, *Mother Nature, * 454–457, 464–474. 

29. In some texts, the Chinese characters for abortion, *datai, * bear the pronunciation gloss *mabiki*, the most common Japanese term for infanticide. See Ochiai, “Th e Reproductive Revolution,” 197. For opposing views that stress the distinction between abortion and infanticide, see Saitō, *Hikakushi no enkinhō; * and Sawayama, *Shussan to shintai no kinsei, * 123–128.

Similarly, a 1798 call for donations for infanticide countermeasures issued by Moriyama domain stated that “childrearing has been seen as an obstacle to agriculture, so that the number of *births * has been declining” \(Kusano, *Shiryō de miru onnatachi no Kinsei, * 141; my emphasis\). 

32. In many domains infants that died of natural causes passed unrecorded as well. 

A number of excellent studies on unintended infant mortality make it possible to estimate it with some confi dence, a crucial step in triangulating the incidence of infanticide. See

33. Th

at literature is so well developed that it is the subject of several surveys. Saitō, “Infanticide, Fertility, and ‘Population Stagnation,’ ” explains why widespread infanticide was no longer the received wisdom in 1992. Kinoshita and Hamano, *Jinruishi no naka no jinkō *

*to kazoku, * 63–82, off er a wealth of detail in the most comprehensive survey to date. Kurosu,

Th e view that infanticide was unim-portant is also implied by Kinoshita Futoshi in *Kindaika izen no Nihon no jinkō to kazoku,* where he concludes that the rising fertility of his study village in Yanbe was the result of the shortening distance of labor migration, which presumably raised coital frequencies between spouses.

“about 10 percent of overall infant mortality,” which would translate to about 2 percent of all births; see Derosas and Tsuya, “Child Control,” 131.

1. Hirota, *Shimazaki kafūden* \(1785\). According to this family chronicle, Shinbei broke off his pilgrimage, returned to Tosa, and mended his ways. Tosa’s reputation for infanticide persisted. In 1759, Tani Mashio, a Tosa scholar, wrote with some rhetorical exaggeration that 

“in ten million people, no more than two or three . . . do not kill children” \( *Kingenjō* \[1759\]\). 

Both sources are reproduced in Ōta, “Tosa hanryō-nai.”

is has long been recognized. See Ōta, *Kinsei Nihon mabiki kankō shiryō shūsei,* 9–11. 

5. While Kazusa had some of Japan’s highest infanticide rates by the late nineteenth century, its reputation in the eighteenth century is ambiguous, since the character “Sō” could  

 

294 NOTES to Pages 28–32

refer to either or both Shimōsa and Kazusa. Th

e designation of Nagato, Sūo, Echizen, and 

Hida rests on references to Hokuriku and on Buyō Inshi’s claim that infanticide was rare in provinces dominated by Jōdoshinshū. It is also signifi cant that in 1791, the Jōdoshinshū 

headquarters issued a letter against infanticide to the faithful in the Kantō, but apparently not to its far more numerous followers in other regions. Th e evidence is mixed for Higo 

and Hyūga, where infanticide reports and population policies coincide with Jōdoshinshū 

strength and steady population growth. 

6. Th

e reputation of Osaka, Kyoto, and Edo for rampant abortion is stated in Amano, *Shiojiri *\(1730s\), cited in Matsuzaki, “Datai,” 155–156; * * Nakai, *Sōbō kigen *\(Osaka, 1788\); Gen’a Hōshi’s comment to *Kinsei kijinden, * in Ban, *Kinsei kijiden *\(1788\), 70; and Murata, *Shiramiron *\(1791\). Illustrations in Gojūken, *Edo meibutsu kanoko* \(1733\); Teranishi, *Kanzen chōaku tebikigusa* \(1814\); and Utagawa, *Kaichū kagami* \(1816\) also show abortion in an urban setting \(the last of these is reproduced in Nihon Ishi Gakkai, eds., *Zuroku Nihon* *iji bunka shiryō shūsei 1, * 213.\). In a petition in 1842, the headmen of a group of villages complained about rampant abortion in their Kinai province of Yamato \(Arimoto, *Shinshū *

*no shūkyō shakaishi, * 213\). Th

e fl ier advertised the services of Nakayama Gyokuboku of Imoya Onarikaidō in Edo and is preserved in the Sōda Collection at Nichibunken. 

7. Th

e votive tablet of Taiheiji in Karasuyama is said to have been donated by the domain lord himself, although no documentation survives to prove this tradition. 

8. Th

e idea of this map is inspired by Chiba and Ōtsu, *Mabiki to mizuko, * 69. 

9. Th

e concentration of such materials in the North Kantō may in part refl ect the eff orts of two men of Mito around 1800, Kimura Kenji and Ōkano Shōgorō; both left us collections of pamphlets that center on Mito and neighboring areas, which include numerous materials that have not otherwise come down to us. It is therefore conceivable that more pamphlets have been lost \(or survive but are unknown to me\) in Western than in Eastern Japan. 

10. According to the shogunal census, the commoner population of Shikoku was 1.5 million in 1721, 1.7 million in 1798, and 1.9 million in 1834. In the 1680s and 1690s, Tosa domain was so concerned with excessive population growth that it facilitated emigration and restricted marriages. See Roberts, *Mercantilism, * 67–68. Ōta Motoko \(“Tosa hanryō-nai,” 580\) explains the lack of eff ective infanticide countermeasures in Tosa with the fact that the domain did not suff er population decline. On the general importance of depopulation to domainal policymakers, see Ravina, *Land and Lordship. *

11. Two pamphlets against infanticide survive in Morioka, but these appear to have been imported from farther south. 

12. In Morioka, paper was so oft en recycled that surviving documents are oft en gray rather than the shades of ivory common elsewhere in Japan. In Hachinohe, even domain offi

cials seem to have treated paper as a precious commodity at times; some of its population registers have come down to us because their reverse was used for a domain diary. 

13. Matsuura, *Tōō enkai nisshi *\(1850\). 

14. On some of the problems of Tokugawa period census data, see Cullen, “Tokugawa Population: Th

e Archival Issues.” 

15. Iwata, * “Ohaka” no tanjō; * Shintani, *Ryōbosei to takaikan, * 42; Arimoto, *Shinshū,* 151–172; Hur, *Death and Social Order, * 205. However, it is uncertain what eff ect doctrinal indiff erence to the stem household had on actual practice. In both Eastern Japan and Echigo, a slightly higher proportion of Jōdoshinshū believers lived in stem households than  

 

NOTES to Pages 35–37 295

parishioners of other sects \(Tōgoku dataset and Echigo dataset\). Perhaps this was the result of the waning of Jōdoshinshū exceptionalism. In the eighteenth century, some of its most infl uential priests became enthusiastic advocates of fi lial piety and the \(stem\) household. 

See Hur, *Death and Social Order, * 206 and 303. 

16. Th

is correlation obtains in comparisons both of diff erent provinces and of districts in the same province. See Arimoto, *Shinshū, * 212, and *Shūkyō shakaishi no kōsō, * 77–81. 

Arimoto demonstrates the district-level correlation for the provinces of Bingo and Aki. Th e 

province-level correlations are not quite as strong, and do not hold for the Kinai, where urbanization was a far more important determinant of population growth than was the preponderance of diff erent sects. 

17. Arimoto, *Shūkyō shakaishi no kōsō, * 77–81. Arimoto derives the number of temples from 1880s prefectural statistical digests \( *Fuken tōkeisho*\), which do not account for temples lost or abandoned in the Meiji transition. 

18. Th

ese fi gures span diff erent parts of the eighteenth century, and in fi ve cases reach several decades into the nineteenth. Eng and Smith, “Peasant Families,” 424–428; Hanley and Yamamura, *Economic and Demographic Change, * 229–240; Hayami, * *“Th e Demographic

For overviews of fertility rates that include the nineteenth century, see Kitō, “Zen-Kindai Nihon no shusshōryoku,” 84; and Tomobe, “Tokugawa nōson ni okeru

20. Eng and Smith, “Peasant Families,” 424–428. Hayami Akira looked for similar patterns in Nishijō, a village only three miles from Asakusanaka, but failed to fi nd them \( *Kinsei Nōbi chihō, * 218–222\). To Hayami’s credit, he left open the possibility that future research, with larger sample sizes, might confi rm Smith’s discovery. But Hayami’s response largely closed the question of infanticide in Central Japan, at least among Japanese scholars. One possible explanation for the discrepancy is the diff erent time frame of the two

samples, 1773–1869 for Nishijō and 1717–1830 for Asakusanaka. In the Tōgoku dataset, sibset sex ratio patterns subsided aft er the eighteenth century. If the same trend obtained in the two Mino villages, the pattern’s traces could be obscured for the Nishijō sample, weighted as it is toward the nineteenth century. Another possibility is that most of Nishijō’s inhabitants were followers of Jōdoshinshū, who, true to the reputation of their faith, may have been reluctant to kill infants. On religious affi

liations in Nishijō, see Toby, “Mind Maps,” 125. 

21. Skinner, “Conjugal Power,” 251–259. Skinner defi ned conjugal power by drawing borders on a complex matrix of relative age and position in the household. Th ese appear 

to have been chosen so as to maximize the sex ratio deviati ons of the fi rst surviving child. 

While this is a useful technique for establishing a hypothesis, it does not produce an otherwise meaningful result. Statistical signifi cance cannot be properly calculated from the same data, since this would amount to testing the hypothesis with the data that suggested it \(a.k.a. 

post hoc theorizing\). 

22. Between 1670 and 1699, sex ratios for the Echigo villages in the Ten Provinces dataset were 110 for children who at birth had more brothers than sisters \(n=880\) but 153 for those who had more elder sisters than brothers \(n=465\); in the eighteenth century, the same sex ratios were 102 \(n=894\) and 116 \(n=584\). 

23. Echigo dataset. For TFR by decade and district in Echigo, see Appendix 4. 

24. Hori, *Seiiku mondō *\(1854\); it is not clear whether this reports a real dialogue, but Hori must have considered plausible that a man would despair over how to stop infanticide. 

Other writings against infanticide in nineteenth-century Tottori include Asuwa, *Kanzen* *shōsen* \(1822\) and Itō, *Seiiku* *kyōyu benran* \(1865\).

28. Hanley and Yamamura, *Economic and Demographic Change, * 239–240. Bizen seems to have acquired no particular reputation for infanticide in the Edo-period. Its rulers, the lords of Okayama, devised no policies to suppress the practice, and when a Confucian scholar in their employ proposed possible countermeasures, he appeared to be speaking about policies for the entire realm: instead of mentioning his own domain, he noted the problems of four Eastern provinces \(Inoue, *Keizai Jūniron* \[1787\]\).

Even inhabitants of medium-sized and small cities like Nara and Takayama had substantially shorter life expectancies than those of most villages. See Hayami, “Kinsei toshi no rekishi jinkōgakuteki kansatsu,” 171–172; Takagi, “Toshi chōnai no population dynamics”; Sasaki, “Urban Migration,” 151. Even in the small castletown of Izuhara \(the capital of Tsushima\), the death rate was a quarter higher than that of the surrounding villages \(Sekiyama, *Kinsei Nihon no jinkō kōzō, * 256–257\). On the other hand, inhabitants of Kōriyama Kamimachi, a ward in a mid-sized Northeastern market town, had life expectancies similar to those of nearby villages.

52. Satō, *Keizai yōroku* \(1827\). Satō’s pseudonymous contemporary, Buyō Inshi, was rather more sympathetic to the distress of girls from Echigo, Etchū, and Dewa, who according to him were sold into prostitution for 3 or 5 ryō by indigent parents \( *Seji kenbunroku *

\[1816\], 249\). 

53. However, there is some confl icting evidence from individual village studies in the Northeast. Nagata, “Chokkei kazoku shisutemu ni okeru rōdō idō,” describes levels of male \(but not female\) labor migration in two villages in Nihonmatsu that are comparable in magnitude \(if quite distinct in pattern\) to those in Central Japan’s Nōbi region. 

54. Th

is maximum estimate derives from villages that record at least one servant. 

For all villages, which may include some that did not mention servants in their population registers even when they existed, the proportion of servants is only 6 percent even in the peak period of 1680–1699. By the 1740–1759 interval, the possible range had collapsed to 0.3–2.2 percent for Southern Ōu and 2–6 percent for the North Kantō. Longitudinal studies of individual villages show a similar trend. For example, in the Nihonmatsu village of Minamisugita, labor migration rates were as high as a quarter around 1680 but fell to just over 5 percent around 1740 \(Narimatsu, *Edo jidai no nōson no* *kurashi, * 81.\)

In her analysis of a headman’s diary from Central Japan \(part of the Nishimatsu diaries of Nishijō\), Narimatsu Saeko notes how lightly he passes over the fact that his “mother had a delivery; the child died.” Seven days later, the family held the customary celebrations of the mother’s safe recovery, but no rites seem to have been performed for the dead child \( *Shōya nikki ni miru Edo no sesō to kurashi, * 190–191\).

servants to retrieve it. Inside, they found two dead infants, a boy with a fan and a girl with a comb \(Takahashi, *Nihon jinkōshi 1, * 420.\) In 1809, a villager complained that bundles with murdered infants were constantly fl oating on the Yugawa out of Aizu’s castletown and into his village \(Endō, “Aizu-han,” 229\).

Similarly, when the Jishū priest Gen’a Hōshi recalled the story of the Eastern Han magistrate Gu Biao, famed for his decision to ride to the rescue of an infanticide victim rather than against a band of robbers, he summarized Gu’s stance as “punishing infanticide as equivalent to killing a human being” \(Gen’a Hōshi’s comments on the manuscript of *Kinsei kijinden, * in Ban, *Kinsei kijinden *\[1788\], 69\).

Kiyomizudera in Hyōgo, having been acquired from a Tokyo art dealer in 1920 

\(Personal communication, Banshū Kiyomizudera\). Th

Manabe, *Hokuchiku zakkō* \(1675\); a 1692 memorial from Oku Tōkō to the lord of Saga, cited in Yokota, “Karatsu-han,” 25; Tani, *Zokusetsu zeiben *\(1716\) and *Zokusetsu zeiben* *zokuhen *\(1718\); Nishikawa, *Hyakushō bukuro *\(1731\); Habu, *Yūminhen* \(1747\). Yusa Bokusai, a scholar in the employ of Sendai, argued against the killing of newborn twins in *Renseishō *

\(1702 and 1719\). 

61. One such amulet is preserved in the Yamazaki Collection at Juntendō University. 

Unfortunately, it is not inscribed with a date. 

62. Hozumi, *Kyūmin myōyaku* \(1695\). For good measure, Hozumi condemned infanticide, but in a way that could also be read as an argument for abortion: “To take out a child that has been born aft er ten months of pregnancy and ‘return it’ is a most inhumane act.”

of two nearby temples, Seirinji \( *Tozawa sonshi jō, * 640–642\) and Shūrinji \( *Mamurokawa* *chōshi, * 705\), the 1750s famine was the worst of all Edo-period mortality crises for this particular microregion, with over a tenth of the population dying of starvation. An even earlier \(1713\) memorial \( *kuyōhi*\) that some folklorists today link to infanticide stands in Komaba in Kurokawa district \( *Nihon rekishi chimei taikei, * entry on Komaba-mura\).

72. Morita, “Kosodate to sanji seigen,” 127, citing *Jizōson junpai michishirube* \(1794\), which mentions a Kogaeashi Jizō at the now defunct temple of Saishinji. Morita also introduces an advertisement for a now lost 1817 guide to temples that included a Kogaeri Fudō in Wakōji near Osaka, which she interprets as sites for prayers for abortions or contraception. 

Such uses are of course not incompatible with the pacifi cation of vengeful spirits. Another example is the Kogaeshi Kannon of Ogawayama Chōkōji in Chichibu in the mountains just west of Edo, although the offi

cial story about this image tells of Kannon facilitating a reunion with a long-lost adopted daughter. Th

is need not have prevented women from 

attaching a diff erent meaning to the evocative name of the image, however.

75. Nishigai, “Tsukubasan shinkō.” In Chiba Prefecture alone, 1,188 such memorial stones \( *tsukimachi kuyōtō*\) were counted in 1980. Th ey were concentrated in the old province of Shimōsa \(Nishigai, “Edo kōki no nyoninkō,” 178–179\). Perhaps these stone markers assuaged guilt and fear, but it is equally possible that their benefi ciaries were children who died a natural death. Th

ey may even have served as sites for fertility prayers. LaFleur, * Liquid* *Life, * 123–131, sees this ambiguity as one of the key attractions of these sacred objects.

81. A cursory survey produced at least twelve memorial stelae, markers, and “graves” 

that predate the nineteenth century, out of a total of at least 130 examples across Japan. Most of these are found in Western Japan, oft en in areas known for a high incidence of infanticide at that very time, such as the provinces of Tosa, Iyo, and Chikuzen. Pregnant whales and their fetuses received particular ritual attention \(Morita, *Kujira to hogei no bunkashi,* 177–178\). Th

is possibly derived less from a concern for the fetus, or fear of its spirit, than from the dreaded force of the mother’s attachment. Not all whales thus memorialized where killed by whalers; beached whales oft en received similar treatment. For thoughts on why whales are especially likely to be the objects of ritual concern, see Ted Bestor, *Tsukiji, * 171. 

82. Nakamura, *Saishi to kugi, * 235. 

83. Of a national horse population of 272,000 horses in 1880, 170,000 were counted in the North Kantō and the Northeast \(Sanbō Honbu, eds., *Kyōbu seihyō Meiji 13-nen* \[1880\]\). 

Although Batō Kannon was the bodhisattva for animals more generally, many such statues were erected primarily for the benefi t of a dead horse. Th ey are especially numerous in 

former *umasuteba, * sites where horse cadavers were deposited. A survey in the city of Higashimatsuyama \(Saitama\) alone found thirty Batō Kannon statues inscribed with eighteenth-century dates \(cited in Matsuzaki, *Gendai kuyō ronkō , * 187\).

92. In 1759, Lord Yamauchi Toyonobu of Tosa stated that people considered raising more than two children a disgrace. His descendant, Toyoatsu, made a similar statement in 1856 \(Takahashi, *Nihon jinkōshi 2, * 241 and 246\). Nakai Chikuzan \( *Sōbō kigen *\[1788\]\) claimed that in Hyūga, warriors who raised more than one heir would be ridiculed by their peers as excessively attached and therefore emotionally immature \( *miren*\). On Eastern Japan, see Ebata, *Ikushihen *\(1790\); Yūki, *Zenkōroku* \(1811\); Sekiguchi, *Yōiku kyōyu* \(1822\); and Nabeta, *Iwakishi *\(Sōma, 1826\).

7. Sendai legalized land division in 1712 in cases where the resulting plots were valued at least one kanmon \(roughly ten koku\). With this revision of the 1673 and 1677 laws, Sendai converged with the established laws of other territories such as the shogunal lands and Aizu. In 1732, Sendai halved the minimum plot size. In 1754, most restrictions on the marriage of younger sons were lift ed. See *Uguisuzawa chōshi, * 402 and 410–411.

Twentieth-century oral testimony from Hyōgo prefecture states that some women would return to their native households to give birth so as to save their child from the infanticidal intents of its paternal grandmother. Conversely, mothers-in-law are said to have at times prepared children’s clothing to allay the suspicions of a pregnant woman, and then kill the child and claim that it had died in the aft ermath of birth from natural causes.

29. For example, the Sekizawa, paper merchants of rural Mito domain, brought in husbands in almost every generation. See Ibaraki Kenritsu Rekishikan, *Higashi Ibaraki-gun Gozen’yama-mura Sekizawa Ken mokuroku 2, * 130; and Yoshida, *Nōsonshi no kisoteki* *kenkyū, * 98. A saying from Mogami in Dewa advises: “Practice *mukoiri* \[uxorilocal marriage\] for three generations and your house will prosper.” 

30. \[João Rodrigues et al., eds.,\], *Vocabvlario da lingoa de Iapam* \(1603\), 374, cited in LaFleur, *Liquid Life, * 100; and Shimizu, “Mizuko ni tsuite,” 180. As Shimizu points out, the *Vocabvlario * recorded mostly the usage of Japan’s westernmost regions, so that inferences for Eastern Japan must be drawn with care. *Mabiki* retains its horticultural meaning to this day; type it into any image search engine, and your screen will fi ll not with hapless infants but with photographs of radishes and carrots. 

31. To my knowledge, the fi rst recorded uses of *mabiki* as a term for infanticide are a poem in a collection by the Edo-based bookseller and wit Shōgetsudō Fukaku, *Chiyomigusa* \(1692\); a compilation of recipes by a domainal physician of Mito, Hozumi Hoan, *Kyūmin* *myōyaku* \(1693\); and the anonymous manual of magic *Majinai chōhōki* \(1699\). 

32. Ōta Zensai’s dictionary *Rigen shūran* \(ca. 1797–1829\) states that *mabiki* was used as an agricultural term in Kyoto, Osaka, and Edo, but as a euphemism for infanticide in Hitachi and Shimotsuke. Several scholars have therefore concluded that it was a vernacular term only in the Kantō, even if intellectuals used it across a wider area. However, the term appears in the title of a 1756 infanticide ban in Tsuyama in western Honshu \(Sawayama, *Shussan to* *shintai, * 129–131\), as well as in a 1789 ban in the adjacent shogunal lands \(Nakayama, *Hayakawa daikan, * 192–193\). In the same year, Nakai Chikuzan, writing in Osaka, observed that in Kyushu the term *mabiki * likened infants to vegetables \( *Sōbō kigen* \[1789\]\). Descriptions of infanticide from all parts of Japan between Shōnai and Hyūga report its local currency, the Northeastern domain of Sendai being a possible exception. One of its offi cials, Saeki 

Koreyasu, noted in an 1853 memorial that “in other lands, they call \[infanticide\] *mabiki*” 

\( *Fūzoku nado kakiage* \[1853\], 116\). Perhaps he meant to imply that infanticide had become so rare in Sendai that people no longer used this term; earlier materials from the area do mention *mabiki* as a common euphemism, including Takahashi, *Nōgyō shōni shikyōben* \(1794\); Taikō, * Ikushi kyōka no bun shōryaku* \(1811\); and Heinosuke, *Mozu no saezuri* \(1814\). 

33. Tani, *Zokusetsu zeiben zokuhen* \(1718\). 

34. Nakahachi, *Yōikukun* \(n.d.\). Many versions of the *Shison hanjō tabikigusa * make a similar argument about potatoes and “child potatoes.” 

35. A regional variant with the same agricultural meaning, *uronuku, * appears in Nabeta Shōzan, *Iwakishi *\(1826\). 

36. Terms of similar semantics, such as *modosu* \(to return\), *oshikaesu * and *oshimodosu* \(to press and return\), and *kogaeshi *\(the act of returning a child\), were used interchangeably. 

37. On the connection between fi lial piety and the Tokugawa concept of the household, see Hur, *Death and Social Order, * 294–318. 

38. Th

e *Kokusho Sōmokuroku * lists forty separate editions of the *Nijūshi-kō * for the Tokugawa period. Katsura, *Yotsugigusa tsumiwake *\(n.d.\), 78, called the *Twenty-four* *Paragons of Filial Piety * a book “that everybody knows well.” His teacher, Suzuki Shigetane \( *Yotsugigusa *\[1846\], 182\), used it as evidence that the infanticidal vices of China had infected Japan. Originally written by Guo Jujing as *Ershisi xiao, * the *Twenty-four Paragons* was used as a basic text in *terakoya* schools, and the exemplars were so popular in Japan that

As Tiana Norgren discusses in *Abortion before Birth Control, * the revision was not driven purely by a concern for the economic plight of poor women, but by varied concerns such as the fear of overpopulation, the eugenic nightmare of reverse selection, and the vested interests of gynecologists whose livelihoods depended on a high demand for abortions.

12. Foreign scholars, too, have seen poverty as the root cause of infanticide. Harold Bolitho, for example, expressed doubts about “rosy-cheeked peasants merrily drown\[ing\] 

their off spring for the sake of conspicuous consumption” \(review of Hanley and Yamamura, *Economic and Demographic Change, * 447\). See also Jolivet, *Japan, * 118; *Encyclopedia* *Britannica* \(1963 ed.\), 12:922; and Sansom, *Japan, * 508.

e Criminalization of Abortion”; I am grateful to Marjan Boogert for this reference.

25. On the nature and limitations of these records of household landholdings, see Appendix 2. 

26. Th

e method used to estimate fertility rates \(see Chapter 1 and Appendix 1\) already adjusts for “natural” infant deaths in famine as well in as normal years. While the mortality adjustment does not diff erentiate between landholding classes, the resulting error is probably small. An event history analysis of two Nihonmatsu villages, for example, found that larger landholdings reduced the risk of an infant’s dying only slightly, with an odds ratio of 0.954 for female infants and no signifi cant eff ect on male infants \(Tsuya and Kurosu, 

“Mortality in Two Ou Villages,” 276\). 

27. Th

e number of infanticides per women is calculated in analogy with a total fertility rate, as the sum of age-specifi c fractions, and states the experience of a hypothetical average woman who lived through her reproductive years.

37. Since samurai stipends were paid in rice, many governments intervened in the market to maintain the purchasing power of their retainers. Local prices were aff ected by bumper harvests and crop failures far away, such that high rice prices could actually be a boon to many local farmers so long as they were not caused by their own bad harvests. In crisis periods, some village communities also banned grain sales and temporarily severed their connection to the market. Finally, rice was not the primary staple of the poor in Eastern Japan, and its price correlated imperfectly with that of less desirable but uniformly cheaper grains. See Tsuya and Kurosu, “Mortality in Two Ou Villages,” 257–258. 

38. Feeney and Hamano, “Rice Price Fluctuations and Fertility,” 25–29. 

39. Tsuya and Kurosu, “Family, Household, Reproduction,” 274 and 278. While the analysis shines with its technical sophistication, the relevance of the rice price data series is open to question, since it was recorded in Aizu rather than Nihonmatsu in an age when bans on grain exports \( *kokudome*\) were a common response to food shortages. In addition, there was considerable infl ation toward the end of the Tokugawa period, which meant that prices were 50 percent higher in the early 1860s than even during the Tenmei famine of the mid-1780s. 

40. Th

e prices for the seven markets \(Edo, Aizu, Shōnai, Sendai, Yamagata, Fukushima, and Echigo\) are from Yamazaki, *Kinsei bukkashi kenkyū. * A regression of detrended rice prices against annual TFRs across the entire Ten Provinces dataset \(years with at least fi ft y women only\) yielded an R2 of 0.000053 and an F-value of 0.87. When rice prices were regressed separately against TFRs in the region of each market, the R2 ranged from 0.0000018 to 0.075 and F-values from 0.21 to 0.99, with the exception of Sendai, where the F-value was 0.068. When Sendai’s three worst famine years are excluded, the R2 falls to 0.0017 and the F-value rises to 0.79.

39. Between 1700 and 1749, 33-year-old women in Eastern Japan recorded 16 percent fewer births than 32-year-olds and 9 percent fewer than 34-year-olds \(n=1,876\). For fathers who already had two living children, the reduction of births from their fortieth to their forty-fi rst and forty-second calendar year was 20 percent, and still 11 percent compared with their forty-third year \(n = 1,226\). For many other periods and confi gurations, however, yakudoshi left no clear traces. 

40. Since the discovery of Tsunoda Tōzaemon’s diary by the local historian Andō Shikō 

\(“Mabiki ni tsuite”\), this remarkable document has inspired a number of subtle analyses, fi rst by Kawaguchi Hiroshi and then Ōta Motoko.

226–230. Kitō Hiroshi \(“Zen-Kindai Nihon no shusshōryoku to junyū kankō,” 24–25\) concludes that gradual weaning would start between the sixth and tenth month of a child’s life but could last into its fi ft h year. One exception to this general impression is an account of the Northeastern domain of Shirakawa by the rector of its academy, Hirose Ten, who claimed that the locals only breastfeed their fi rst two children \( *Shirakawa fudoki *

101. Th

is fi gure comes from a version of my dataset that takes into account the high mortality risk attending short birth intervals in its reverse-survival technique. I ultimately decided against using this alternative model for the other fertility and sex ratio fi gures in this book; since short intervals were so rare in the Tōgoku dataset, the results of this more elaborate technique were almost indistinguishable from the simpler and therefore more transparent version of the Own-Children Method.

1. Manabe, *Hokuchiku zakkō* \(1675\), 36–37. It is notable that the mindset portrayed in this early report from Northern Kyushu is diff erent from the fertility norm that later analyses of infanticide describe with great regularity and especially for Eastern Japan.

5. Shiba, *Shunparō hikki *\(1811\), 478; Shiba described the situation in eastern Kyushu \(Buzen, Bungo, Hyūga\) in the same terms as that of Hitachi, Mutsu, and Dewa. Other authors stated fi gures that implied that parents aborted or killed far more children than they raised. For example, Satō Nobuhiro put the *annual* number of abortions and infanticides for every ten households at three or four \( *Sōmoku rokubu kōshuhō* \[1832\], 217 \[on Kazusa\] and 364\), or “not below two” \( *Nōsei honron *\[1829\], 169\). In the domain of Akita with its 300,000-odd people, he believed that “several tens of thousands of ” children were aborted or killed each year \( *Shōtō Hikita-kun ni hōtei suru fūji* \[1812\], 635\). Satō’s numbers are impossibly high, since even under optimal conditions for reproduction, the annual number of pregnancies would not be above three for every ten households \(that is, roughly fi ft y people\), or above 15,000 for a population the size of Akita’s. 

6. Mosk, “Fecundity” and “Th

e Decline of Marital Fertility”; Cornell, “Infanticide”; Saitō, “Infanticide”; Tomobe, “Tokugawa nōson.” 

7. Since there is no responsible way of back-projecting patterns of marriage and labor migration, I only calculated them for the present moment of each population register, and then averaged them for each decade. 

8. See Drixler, “Conjuring the Ghosts of Missing Children.” Th e model is sensitive to 

very low coital frequencies. Th

e results reported in this book assume that among cohabiting spouses intercourse was a third as frequent as was reported in a 1975 survey of married Japanese women. Th

e model generated 100,000 women for every combination of infanticides and abortion, that is, about 18 million women. 

9. More specifi cally, every day the model simulates the following events by the age of the woman: menarche \(nonfamine years only\), menopause, onset of pathological sterility, marriage, end of marriage, sexual intercourse \(for married women coresident with their husbands\), involuntary pregnancy loss, and death \(which depends on the prevailing mortality level, with an added 0.8 percent mortality risk for each birth or abortion\). 

Cycle length, the likelihood of a cycle being anovulatory, labor migration, and the husband’s labor migration are also simulated by age. When all preconditions for a conception have been met, conception probabilities are modeled based on the day of the cycle. Child deaths are simulated based on the child’s age \(in days\) and the mortality level prevailing in each year. Once it has been determined that a pregnancy will end in involuntary pregnancy loss, the precise day on which it occurs is simulated based on the empirical distribution of such events over the course of the pregnancy. Th e same logic is applied 

to induced abortions. Th

e daily risk of returning to ovulation is calculated based on the presence of a living child, or the days that have elapsed since a miscarriage, a stillbirth, or a child’s death. 

10. See also an 1808 decree of Annaka domain that complained that even women in the family of headmen were dying from abortions \( *Annaka shishi 2 tsūshihen, * 556\). In his account of a twentieth-century village in Yamanashi, Ono \( *Nōson shakaishi ronkō *\[1941\], 120–122\) notes that people thought abortions risky and therefore preferred infanticides. See also Akamatsu, *Hijōmin no minzoku bunka, * 84 on Hyōgo. 

11. On abortion methods \(including massage\) in early-twentieth-century court cases, see Iwata, “*Inochi” wo meguru Kindaishi, * 116–118. On a society in which abortion by massage was apparently mandatory in many circumstances, see Shepherd, *Marriage and* *Mandatory Abortion among the 17th-century Siraya. *

38. Japan began counting miscarried fetuses as stillbirths in the fourth month of pregnancy, while most European statistical offi

ces defi ned stillbirths as fetal deaths in the fi ft h 

month or later and sometimes used a minimum weight to estimate the age of the fetus. 

However, the fraction of fetuses in the fourth and fi ft h months in Imperial Japan’s stillbirth statistics is small and cannot begin to account for the diff erence in the rates between Japan and the rest of the world. 

39. See Maps 11 and 17. 

40. In addition to a number of prewar observers, at least four postwar scholars have raised the possibility that Japan’s high stillbirth rates may have covered infanticides and abortions. Taeuber, *Th*

41. In cases of missing boys, I reversed this procedure and assumed one female victim for every two boys killed at birth. 

42. For each year, prefecture, and stage of pregnancy and early childhood, I calculated a 95 percent confi dence interval for the sex ratio and used whichever limit came closer to the “natural” range for the sex ratios of stillbirths and neonatal deaths. I used the following conservative assumptions in my estimates, which can accommodate a high prevalence of syphilis and other diseases that raise stillbirth rates.

46. Miyauchi Yoshinaga observed that people considered the fi ft h or sixth month of pregnancy as a good time for aborting the child \( *Tōyamabiko* \[1834\]; relevant passage translated in LaFleur, *Liquid Life, * 109\). Even the last two trimesters had their advocates. Hozumi Hoan’s *Kyūmin myōyaku* \(1695\) recommended abortions to be performed “from the fourth month onward,” since earlier abortions could result in hemorrhage; see Sawayama, *Shussan* *to shintai, * 116. Takano Shōseki, *Sūjōroku *\(1790\), in contrast, named the fi rst three months as the common time for abortions. 

47. Susan Burns, “When Abortion Became a Crime,” 41. 

48. In Aomori, for example, the sex ratio of stillbirths before the eighth month ranged from 79 to 87 between 1900 and 1907, and in 1901, nine out of forty-six prefectures reported more female than male stillbirths before the eighth month. 

49. Mortal neglect could have contributed to these fi gures, but while there are eyewitness accounts for outright infanticide from this period, I am not aware of such reports for mortal neglect. 

50. Th

is excludes the parts of Akita and Iwate prefectures that were part of my defi nition of Eastern Japan before 1870.

6. Mencius’s list is sympathy \(feeling sadness on behalf of others\), shame, gallantry \(yielding to others\), and conscience \(distinguishing good from evil\). Suzuki uses the vernacular terms *kanashimi * and *haji * instead of the erudite *sokuin * and *shūaku. *

7. On the role of empiricism in Kaibara’s thought, see Tucker, *Moral and Spiritual* *Cultivation in Japanese Neo-Confucianism, * 5, 127–129.

and “inferior to animals” within seven lines of each other, but not specifi cally about infanticide. 

17. Th

23. It is possible that some of Suzuki’s potential models, such as Bukkai Tenchō’s *Fushi on’aishū* \(1746\), also directly informed the works that followed the cat-woman poster. Kimura Kenji pasted a hand-copy of *Fushi on’aishū * into his *Sokuin goroku* \(1791–1808\), proving that it was still available at the turn of the nineteenth century.

29. It is oft en claimed that the author of the *Shison hanjō tebikigusa * is unknown \(see, for example, Suzuki, “Mabiki,” 70\), but this misunderstanding must have arisen from the fact that none of its many editions states the author. Th

ere is no doubt that Teranishi penned 

the original version. 

30. See also Kanazu, “ ‘Datai, mabiki’ kō.” Some animal analogies may have been inspired by Habu, *Yūminhen *\(1737\) and Jitsumeiin Kōson, *Kai Kantō jaken no to eiji shōsoku* \(1791\), a letter sent from the Kyoto headquarters of Jōdoshinshū \(Nishi-Honganji\) to the faithful in the Kantō that in turn shows the infl uences of Suzuki Busuke’s poster. 

31. Th

is version of the *Shison hanjō tebikigusa * is actually the 1810 print run of Jōfukuji in Hitachi, the oldest dated copy that I have been able to locate, which was republished in 1850 both by Jōfukuji and by Jōsenji in Shirakawa. One *Shison hanjō tebikigusa * in the Fukushima Prefectural Archives may be Teranishi’s original version of 1793, but since it lacks date and attribution, it is diffi

cult to tell whether it is an original or a copy of the 

Jōfukuji or Jōsenji printruns. Th

at another exhortatory pamphlet written by Teranishi, 

his 1812 *Kanzen chōaku tebikigusa, * includes the theme of two people shown once as normal humans, and then as demons in a bubble, makes it plausible that Teranishi’s original included the illustration. 

32.

35. Th

e precise age of this print has long eluded historians \(see for example Ōta, *Kodakara, * 211\), but can now be dated thanks to Kimura, *Sokuin goroku *\(1791–1808\).

71. In a major compilation of German village studies \(die Berliner Datenbank\), infant mortality rates in the two most salubrious village clusters moved in a range from about 10 

to about 17 percent between 1740 and 1840 \(Kloke, “Säuglingssterblichkeit,” * * 86\). In twenty-nine eighteenth-century parishes in France, infant mortality ranged from 18 to 26 percent, while the average of sixteen English parishes moved between an adjusted 12 and 20 percent between the 1580s and the 1780s \(Wrigley, “Births and Baptisms,” 284 and 293\). In Victorian England, the rate hovered around 15 percent \(Woods, *Demography, * 253\). In the imperial lineage of the Qing, male infant mortality dipped below 10 percent in the eighteenth century \(Lee, Wang, and Campbell, “Infant and Child Mortality,” 398\). 

72. Nonetheless, there was some false reporting of infant deaths. For example, a Tsuyama villager named Uemon reported a stillbirth as an infant death aft er seven days. He was found out and punished. Sawayama, *Sei to seishoku, * 106.

ese children were recorded in Oshihata between 1848 and 1857. For one additional child we have no information about birth order. Attitudes toward infanticide, or perhaps the rigor of enforcement, apparently varied from village to village. Hataya, a neighboring village under the same regime, reported two fi ft h children and an eleventh \(\!\) child among  

 

NOTES to Pages 177–178 333

its twenty-nine births \(1860\). Perhaps Hataya’s greater enthusiasm for procreation had something to do with the prior eff orts of Kanzaki Magoemon, a former resident of the village and prominent \(if deceased\) opponent of infanticide. See Mizuno, “Kazusa, Shimōsa,”

84. Sakurai, “Mabiki to datai.” 

85. Th

e domain of Kaga, whose population grew to over a million by the end of the Edo period, notably meted out capital punishment to parents who abandoned or killed their children. However, such punishments may have been relatively rare even there. Th

e records of the domain mention eleven cases of infanticide, which were all punished by stoning \( *tsubute*\), and eleven cases of child abandonment, whose perpetrators were executed by *kyōshu * beheading *, * “plain” decapitation, and stoning \(Tachinami,

same fi ne, and any helpers paid 5 kanmon. Th

ese penalties did not just exist on paper. 

In 1835, the wife of Taiheiji of Mirukashi village miscarried in the seventh month of her pregnancy while she was planting rice. Because they had not yet fi led a pregnancy report, Taiheiji was thereupon sentenced to ten days of labor \( *Saga shishi 2, * 621\).

100. Fictitious stillbirths are no perfect guide to the geography of infanticide and abortion because the absence of the former is no evidence for the absence of the latter two. It seems that in some areas, the habit of reporting infanticides and abortions as stillbirths took time to take root, or else that there was a rise in such interventions aft er the 1890s. For example, the stillbirth rate of Minamiaizu district averaged 1.9 percent in the 1890s but 11 

percent between 1903 and 1911.

In contrast, Buyō Inshi, *Seji kenbunroku *\(1816\), argued that to the extent that infanticide occurred in Hitachi and Shimotsuke, it could not be a very old custom, since from the establishment of Tokugawa rule to the reign of the fourth shogun they were fl ourishing provinces.

While I have not seen pregnancy surveillance documents from Miyazaki, a directive from 1876 survives that orders the people of one sector to respect the surveillance rules. In addition to the bans and policies displayed on the map, the prefectural assembly of Kumagaya \(a prefecture than spanned parts of present Gunma and Saitama\) debated a proposal in late 1873 to ban abortion and the informal burial of infants \(Takahashi, * Nihon jinkōshi 2, * 483\). Chikuma prefecture announced a rice subsidy for foundlings, which was in theory extended to all of Japan \(National Archives, *Dajō ruiten, * 19a–25b, 1873 fukoku 138\). In parts of Tokyo, a childrearing system was operational in 1875. See Tokyo Suruga-chō Mitsui-gumi Ikujikata, *Shomen wo motte* and Minomura, *Ikuji hōhō ni kansuru gansho* \(both 1875\).

39. Th

e fi ne grain and warp resistance of paulownia wood made it the material of choice for chests and wooden clogs. Apparently, there was a custom beyond Tarumizu of planting a paulownia tree when a baby girl was born and, later, craft ing a *tansu * dresser from it as part of her dowry. On Takasaki Masakaze, see Gōchi, “Satsuma-han,” 37–38. Th e custom of

Its rules were published under the title *Ikushihō fukoku* \(1870\). Two months later, Shirakawa prefecture announced a similar program, which however divided the population into thirds at the village rather than the prefectural level \(Takahashi, *Nihon jinkōshi 2, * 439–444\).

58. However, the Ministry of Finance under Ōkuma Shigenobu at fi rst demanded the immediate transfer of Sakura’s childrearing endowment, the Intokukō, to the central government. Shibahara was able to negotiate a compromise whereby Chiba could use the funds as a ten-year interest-free loan from the central government. See Shibahara Yawara, Iwasa Tameharu, and Watanabe Takashi, “Kyū Sakura-ken Intokukōkin no gi ni tsuki mōshiagesho” \(June 8, 1873\), with Ōkuma Shigenobu’s reply dated June 25, 1873; and Shibahara Yawara and Iwasa Tameharu, “Kyū Sakura-ken hikiwatashi Intokukōkin no gi ni tsuki ukagaigaki” \(September 19, 1873\), with Ōkuma’s reply dated October 8, 1873, all in *Ikuji hōhō shikō junjo *\(1875\).

6. Infanticide in exceptional circumstances continued nonetheless. According to interviews that Suzuki Yuriko conducted with old midwives \(“Mabiki,” 84\), children born with a disability were sometimes killed and reported as stillborn even in the late 1950s. 

7. Th

ese concerns chiefl y derive from the fact that a family’s former outcaste status can be deduced from their ancestors’ place of residence at the beginning of the Meiji period. 

8. Such estimates must remain tentative. Not every birth was reported in the 1870s and 1880s, and the sample size of individual districts, while large, leaves some room for chance results.

15. Th

is assumes that at least some of the feigned stillbirths were abortions rather than infanticides. In 1902, I estimate the number of late-term abortions and infanticides at close to 70,000. Th

e stillbirth and neonatal death statistics are of uneven quality for the 1880s and 1890s, but the fact that in some prefectures with good recording practices the number of feigned stillbirths was even higher before than aft er 1900 suggests that the annual number of late-term abortions and infanticides probably exceeded 100,000 in the late nineteenth century. 

16. Tokuda, “Meiji igo,” 14. Hardacre, *Marketing the Menacing Fetus, * 50, cites somewhat higher fi gures for 1904–1955, with a peak of 672 in 1910 and more than 100 convictions every year before 1942. Infanticide continued to be punished as willful homicide \( *Penal* *Code *\[1907\], § 199\) and as such carried statutory sentences between three years’ imprisonment and the death penalty. Precise fi gures for convictions are diffi cult to obtain, but between 1908 and 1931, 360 convicts were executed for willful homicide. Fewer than a tenth of these were women. However, prison sentences for infanticide may nevertheless have been moderately frequent; in 1930, there were 99 prison sentences for willful homicide for every execution.

22. Already in 1937, Morinaga Eisaburō \(“Dataizai shikō”\) claimed that abortion was criminalized with the goal of fostering population growth. While he made this statement approvingly, a more recent generation of scholars has been far more critical of the criminalization of abortion, but has similarly interpreted it as part of a larger state project to control the reproduction and sexuality of its subjects and lay the demographic foundations of great power status. See Kanazumi, “Dataizai”; Ochiai, *Kindai kazoku to feminizumu, * 83–89; Ogino, “Jinkō ninshin chūzetsu to josei no jiko ketteiken”; Fujime, *Sei no rekishigaku,* 117–121; LaFleur, *Liquid Life, * 119–122.

e Criminalization of Abortion”; and Terazawa, “Gender, 

Knowledge, and Power.” By 2008, Ogino Miho conceded that it was uncertain whether abortion had been criminalized with demographic goals in mind, but still thought it plausible that the convictions were numerous enough to make many people reluctant to depend on abortion for family planning purposes \(“*Kazoku keikaku” he no michi, * 5–6\). 

24. Terazawa, “Gender, Knowledge, and Power,” 223, 227–228. 

25. Th

is paragraph is based on Terazawa, “Gender, Knowledge, and Power”; * * Rousseau, “Enduring Labors”; and Steger, “From Impurity to Hygiene.” Hardacre, *Marketing the* *Menacing Fetus, * 49, observes that unlike the old midwives, their new competitors neither accompanied their clients’ pregnancies with rituals nor formed an “ongoing relationship with either mother or child.” 

26. Whether it succeeded in doing so is a diff erent matter. Nishikawa, “Th e Modern 

Midwife,” 83, concludes that “modern midwives . . . rather functioned as mediators between the state and the people.” 

27. Terazawa, “Gender, Knowledge, and Power,” * * 283–284, on Ishikawa prefecture. 

Ishizaki Shōko argues that the reporting requirement may have been primarily motivated by a desire to collect accurate statistics on what was considered a public health problem \(“Meiji-ki no seishoku wo meguru kokka seisaku,” 43–44\). 

28. Th

ere may be exceptions to this statement, such as southern Kyushu, where it is possible that some natural and many “artifi cial” stillbirths went unreported well into the twentieth century. On the underreporting of stillbirths before 1903, see Murakoshi, “Meiji kōki ni okeru shizan tōkei no shinraisei.” 

29. See Chapter 12 on Chiba; and Takahashi, *Nihon jinkōshi 1, * 798–799, on Miyazaki. 

30. Terazawa, “Gender, Knowledge, and Power,” 280–281. 

31. In Ishikawa prefecture, midwives were asked to keep the charts for ten years in case the police decided to consult them, but even there they were not forwarded as a matter of routine. See Terazawa, “Gender, Knowledge, and Power,” 281, citing Nishikawa, *Aru Kindai* *sanba monogatari, * 296. 

32. I derive this estimate from the following considerations. Th e number of new midwives fi rst exceeded that of traditional midwives in 1914 \(Terazawa, “Th e State,” 70\). How-

ever, some women continued to give birth by themselves or with the help of relatives, neighbors, or unlicensed \(and hence uncounted\) midwives. Th

ere is reason to suspect that the 

proportion of such births was considerable. For every licensed midwife \(both old and new\), sixty-one children were born in 1914 but only thirty-fi ve in 1936, even though improvements in transportation, such as the spread of bicycles, should have allowed each midwife to care for more clients in the 1930s. If all births were attended by licensed midwives in 1936 

and if each licensed midwife delivered as many babies in 1914 as in 1936, this left more than 40 percent of 1914 births unattended by licensed practitioners. On the same assumptions, new midwives would have fi rst delivered one half of babies in 1923. 

33. On the persistence of “villages without midwives” in the 1930s, see Iwata, *“Inochi” *

*wo meguru Kindaishi, * 205–206. In a study of rural Ishikawa prefecture in the 1920s, Mugiko Nishikawa notes that even in villages with midwives, people would only call on them if the birth was diffi

cult \(“Th

e Modern Midwife,” 90–91\). Akamatsu Keisuke reports that in Meiji-period eastern Harima \(Hyōgo prefecture\), only middling and affl uent villagers 

would employ a midwife \( *Hijō min no minzoku bunka, * 84\). See also Yoshimura, *Kodomo* *wo umu, * 136–137.

36. While it is possible that stillbirths were underreported in those two prefectures, Jōdoshinshū was the dominant form of Buddhism in both, and at least Toyama \(Etchū\) had been known for its rejection of infanticide in the Edo period. 

37. Watson-Jones et al., “Syphilis in Pregnancy in Tanzania,” found a 25 percent stillbirth rate in women seropositive for syphilis. Studies on many other populations have found syphilis far more prevalent among women who bore stillborn children than in mothers of live children. 

38. For a more detailed explanation, see Drixler, “Stillbirths and Infanticide in Imperial Japan.” 

39. Indeed, the defi nition of stillbirth in most countries is a fetal death aft er the twentieth week of the pregnancy or above a birth weight that few fetuses reach before their fi ft h month of gestation. 

40. For example, in Akita the implied sex ratio of mid-term fetuses exceeded 107 during six years between 1900 and 1909, and Kōchi’s peaked at 109 in 1912. Th e national average 

was stable at about 105. 

41. Around 1900, * Tōkai shinbun * ran an article on high stillbirth rates, as did *Yorozu* *chōhō* \(Izuhara Tenrai, “Zetsudai naru jindō mondai,” cited in Kure, *Jinkō seisaku to sengo* *keiei, * 67–68\). Th

e stillbirth rate also featured in *Kōchi Eiseikai zasshi 2* \(1899\) and Kōchi Jizen Kyōkai, *Kōchi Ikujikai enkakushi* \(1916\), both cited in Ōta, “Tosa hanryō-nai,” 645, 655–656. In recent years, Ōta Motoko, Suzuki Yuriko \(“Mabiki”\), and Mogi Yōichi and Fujikawa Mai \(“Kindai Iga”\) have noted the high stillbirth rates of the late Meiji period.

ce, mentioned as an aside in a 1921 article on how to collect statistics that “it is said that \[abortion and infanticide\] are still practiced in the Kantō and the Northeast” \(“Nōson no hoken eisei jitchi chōsa ni tsuite,” 322–323\).

Regional newspapers ran similar articles and also noted the general persistence of infanticide in certain areas. Two newspapers, *Ōu nichinichi shinbun* and *Kahoku shinpō, * covered seventy separate cases of infanticide in Miyagi prefecture between 1885 and 1935 \(Suzuki, 

“Mabiki,” 74–77\). Other examples include *Kōchi nippō, * Feburary 3 and March 8, 1898; and *Toyō shinbun, * March 8, 1898; all three cited in Ōta, “Tosa hanryō-nai,” 660–661.

71. In 1950, 19.5 percent of married respondents to the survey stated that they used contraception, but only 9 percent reported that they had started doing so “before the war.” Th e 

value of this statistic is undermined by the fact that these responses are not broken down by the age of the couples. A large proportion of couples who were sexually active in 1950 had married aft er 1937. 

72. Age at marriage did not decline at this time. While nutrition probably improved, it is unlikely that malnutrition depressed fertility in 1910. Th e burden of sexually transmitted 

diseases may have declined and thus reduced sterility. 

73. It was at this time that regions tried to put themselves at the center of the expanding empire and other modern projects. See Lewis, *Becoming Apart; * and Wigen, *Th* * e Making of *

Since there is no reason to think that all victims of infanticide were female, or that all of them had so many older siblings, their actual number must have been at least several times larger.

neonatal deaths” among the Qing imperial lineage \(Lee, Wang, and Campbell, “Marital Fertility Control among the Qing Nobility,” 397\).

16. Th

e version of the Demographic Transition Th

eory that comments on the causes of 

declining fertility credits modernity either directly or indirectly through improvements in mortality. Even Nag, “How Modernization Can Also Increase Fertility,” states that “modernization generally produces a reduction in the demand for children” and considers only changes in breastfeeding, nutrition, intrauterine mortality, disease burden, abstinence, wid-owhood, divorce, nuptiality, and coital frequency as possible causes of rising fertility. For an earlier case study of increasing fertility, see Henley, “From High to Low Fertility in Sulawesi.” 

17. Currently, the most infl uential statement of the modernizing eff ects of fertility declines is probably the concept of the demographic dividend, which observes that by creating a period of favorable dependency ratios, fertility declines open a window of opportunity for economic development. See Bloom and Williamson, “Demographic Transitions.”

percent only in 1940.

e main exception that comes to mind is the tempo eff ect \(the postponement of childbearing\), but this is relatively small and only works at intermediate time scales rather than across decades. 

22. To these assumptions, the UN demographers have added the belief that demographic systems tend toward homeostasis, which leads them to assume that wherever fertility temporarily falls below the replacement level, it will ultimately “converge toward and fl uctuate around replacement-level fertility in the long run.” UN DESA Population Division, *World Population Prospects: Th*

sand-year extrapolation of the change in the child population in the year to April 1, 2012, the clock received wide international media coverage. See http://mega.econ.tohoku.ac.jp/

For example, across sizable populations, daughters who married out were likely off set by daughters-in-law marrying in, who however cannot usually be assigned to their mothers. 

4. Large regional diff erences in mortality are a common fi nding even in premodern states of moderate size, such as eighteenth-century England and Sweden and nineteenth-century Spain and Germany. England: Wrigley and Schofi eld, “English Population History,” 

178–179, report a persistent twenty-year diff erence in life expectancies between two parishes. Sweden: According to Hofsten and Lundström, *Swedish Population History, * infant mortality rates ranged from 98 to 160. For Spain, Fausto Dopico found that life expectancy ranged from about twenty-fi ve years to over forty in the 1860s \(“Regional Mortality,” esp.

9. Th

at the kakochō used in this study state neither the age of the deceased nor the age structure of the population at risk introduces an additional element of imprecision into my mortality estimates. Since small children in premodern populations have far higher risks of dying in a given year, populations with many children should have higher mortality rates than populations with fewer children when they have the same life expectancy. 

10. While an analysis of kakochō can generate mortality estimates all the way from the 1630s, their reliability is doubtful before the late seventeenth century. Th e custom of listing 

dead parishioners in kakochō took time to diff use. Th

e resulting gradual increase in re-

corded deaths means that dividing the number of deaths in any given year over the fi ft een-year median is as much a measure of the precise process by which this custom was adopted as it is an indication of mortality conditions. Th

e problem is compounded by the fact that 

“early adopters” of kakochō * * were not at all randomly distributed across the population. 

Elites used kakochō before the majority of commoners embraced them; even elite commoners may initially have tended to omit less important household members from these ritual lists. It is therefore unsurprising that before the late seventeenth century, mortality estimates derived from kakochō do not always agree with other evidence about mortality conditions, such as reports of famines and epidemics. 

11. Th

e timing of such potential mortality crises is based on Fujikawa, *Nihon shippeishi;* Ishijima, *Mito-han igakushi, * 75; Jannetta, *Epidemics and Mortality; * Kikuchi, *Kinsei no kikin;* and local histories, including *Senmaya chōshi 3, * 183–184; *Miyagi kenshi * 22 *, * 196–201; *Tajiri* *chōshi jō; * and *Isawa chōshi * 5, * * 722–723.

23. From the third month to the thirty-sixth, the cumulative proportion of deaths is described by y = 0.2603 ln\(x\) \+ 0.0707 for the relevant life tables from the Human LifeTable Database. 

24. Some studies diverge from this pattern, which may in part refl ect the underreporting of births, the misreporting of stillbirths as live births, early weaning, or infanticide. If 3 

percent of total births are subtracted from the deaths reported in the fi rst month of life as a rough \(and perhaps high\) estimate for stillbirths reported as deaths, the 30/50 proportions very broadly hold for the European populations analyzed in Oris et al., “Infant and Child Mortality,” 363. In England between 1600 and 1830, reported deaths in the fi rst month of life accounted for between 44 and 66 percent of deaths in the fi rst year of life. It is possible that the higher range of these numbers was actually the result of concealed infanticide. See Hart, 

“Beyond Infant Mortality,” 221, 226.

Like the stillbirth rates discussed in Chapters 7 and 13, the unusually high proportion of neonatal deaths at the beginning of the twentieth century may be a trace of infanticides.

Age-heaping was a problem before 1660, but its signs disappear entirely by 1710, whether as the result of a growing concern with precise ages or simply due to the comprehensive cradle-to-grave registration system.
