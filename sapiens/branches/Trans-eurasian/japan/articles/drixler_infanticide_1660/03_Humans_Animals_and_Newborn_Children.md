When Arai Nobuaki, a childrearing commissioner in Sendai domain, toured the villages of his quadrant to lecture against infanticide, he was intrigued to fi nd the countryside dotted with stelae dedicated to silkworms.1 In response to his inquiry, the locals explained that “when you boil silkworms to \[harvest their\] thread, you kill a living being.” Arai was moved to write a poem:

mushi dani mo 

People who have

tomurau nori no 

memorial services

aru mono ni 

even for bugs, 

akago wo gaisu 

know ye the retribution

mukui shire kashi 

for killing a newborn child\! 

Aft er his tour, Arai compiled his arguments against infanticide into a booklet. In a fi rst section, he rehearsed in prose various reasons why people should rear all their progeny. He remained puzzled that people could be concerned about small bugs and still kill newborn children.2 Alongside the silkworm stelae, he noted the custom of presenting rice cakes in memorial services for bugs and worms killed as collateral damage when farmers hoed their fi elds. In a second section, he wrote two exhortatory poems for every syllable in the kana alphabet, including the following: Sodateage 

If they try to raise

shinda kodomo ha 

a child and it dies, 

kuyō suru. 

they hold rites for its benefi t.

48 The Culture of Low Fertility

Rites of merit transference, or *kuyō, * to the souls of dead humans, animals, and even plants and inanimate objects were part of everyday life in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Japan. Arising from the notion that karmic merit could be channeled from the living to the dead, they were expressed in a wide array of rituals and artifacts, from Buddhist priests chanting precisely scheduled services to sculptors carving roadside stone markers. Kuyō could soothe dead souls and avert their return as vengeful spirits. For dead animals and deceased humans alike, it could improve the prospects for a pleasant rebirth. When performed in correct intervals for fi ft y years and with professional help, kuyō could even transform a dead man into a serene ancestral deity, a status ancestors would enjoy as long as their descendants continued to venerate them. 

Paradoxically, this solicitude toward the dead was an integral part of the culture of infanticide. Because enshrined ancestors only required one descendant per generation to maintain their happy condition, it was thought that raising many children would only sap the strength of the stem line, on whose perpetuation personal immortality depended. Before the worldviews that underpinned the culture of infanticide began to shift , supernumerary newborns could easily be sacrifi ced to this higher goal. Infants were not considered full human beings, and there is little evidence that in those areas where infanticide was tolerated, killing a newborn was considered a greater transgression than taking an animal life. 

Th

e cosmological proximity of animals and humans had other consequences. 

Human status was a privilege that had to be maintained with eff ort, and reckless reproduction could cast doubt on the humanity of a man or a woman. Villagers derided as animals those who raised too many children or, worse still, gave birth to twins. Infanticide, therefore, was part of a system that maintained the boundaries between animals and humans, and turned dead humans into living gods.

In eighteenth-century Japan, the dead required careful handling. Once family members had failed to resuscitate an adult corpse, the bereaved would tie it up to make sure it did not stir again on its own.4 People feared the dead, even if they had been gentle and beloved in life. Th

ey worried all the more about adults who had 

died a violent or unjust death. Popular tales teemed with vengeful ghosts. Sickness, ill fortune, and natural disasters were readily traced to the wrath of resentful spirits. When locusts devastated the crops in parts of Hokuriku in the 1730s, local farmers explained them as a visitation by the spirit of Saitō Sanemori, a general slain there in 1183. In northern Kyushu, where the same generation of locusts ate so heartily that a fi ft h of the human population starved to death, they were seen as manifestations of the wrath of Sugawara no Michizane, a courtier of the ninth century who died there in undeserved exile.5

While one warrior or courtier could posthumously lay waste to entire landscapes, men of lesser power had to band together to cause similar calamities. 

When Akita suff ered an infestation in 1788, a local monk explained that those who had died in the recent famine had returned as ravenous bugs.6 Japan’s roadsides and cemeteries were full of memorial stones intended to soothe the souls of men and women who had no descendants or who had starved to death far from their homes. Even fallen enemies received a memorial, or sometimes a whole shrine, to pacify their potentially malevolent spirits, be they samurai, Korean guerrillas, or even invading Mongols.7

For the longest time, the souls of fetuses or infants required no such management, though there are exceptions to this generalization. In the early eighteenth century, for example, Amano Sadakage, a noted scholar from an important warrior house, reported that an abortionist in Edo had been driven to madness by an apparent attack of fetal spirits. Amano also related the sorry end of a purveyor of abortifacients in Kyoto. Collapsing sick one day, he shouted that hundreds of babies were gnawing at his brain lining to take revenge on the man who had poisoned their amniotic sacs. Apparently, he died begging his family to burn his medical books to prevent others from following his dark path.8 Th ese reports are 

exceptional, however. It is likely that they were inspired by a Ming Chinese text, and may be more revealing of Chinese sensibilities than of widely held views of fetal power in eighteenth-century Japan.9

In general, the souls of infants and fetuses were not thought to linger in this world; even if they did refuse to move on, they were largely unable to cause any serious harm. In Ihara Saikaku’s 1686 novel *Th*

* e Life of an Amorous Woman *

\( *Kōshoku ichidai onna*\) *, * the main character is musing in old age about her many past lovers when outside her house she sees a vision of the fruits of those liaisons. 

Nearly a hundred fetal spirits, sporting lotus leafs over their heads and blood-smeared lower bodies, congregate there, more lugubrious than threatening.10 

Around the same time, the celebrated exorcist Yūten Shōnin began to give voice to fetal and infant souls, but even these spirits remained faint and weak. In 1685, he diagnosed the disease of a girl as her possession by the spirit of another woman who died in an abortion.11 Th

e ghost also begged the exorcist to save fi ft een other resentful spirits, all of them fetuses whom the girl’s father had aborted. Unable to possess a living woman or exact revenge in any other way, they were powerless without the ghost of an adult woman as their advocate.12

Apparently, posthumous wailing was the worst of which an infant soul was generally thought capable. In 1715, a fl ood deposited a huge boulder near Iida in Shinano.13 When the sound of crying babies began to issue from beneath the rock, a statue of Jizō, a baby-faced bodhisattva with a particular fondness for small children, was erected to soothe any infants who might have been crushed there, whereupon the crying ceased. In a similar incident, the priest of Shōhōji in

northern Sendai found the calm of his garden pond disturbed one day by a persistent wail; suspecting that mothers had drowned their babies there, he recited some sutras, and the silence was restored.14

When a newborn died, whether in an infanticide or of natural causes, it would not receive a proper funeral.15 In some regions, people cast the corpse into a river, perhaps because the waters were thought to carry away both body and soul.16 If so, the desire to put physical distance between the dead infant and its family points to an ambivalence about the power of its soul. In other areas, the preferred manner of disposal was burial under the fl oor of a house.17 Apparently, such casual treatment was thought to speed the rebirth of the little soul. 

Newborn children were still part of an ill-defi ned spirit world, and it was this liminality that made their rejection cosmologically diff erent from killing. One of the most common as well as oldest terms for infanticide— *kogaeshi*—describes infanticide as a “return” of the child to some other world, and only a few variants—

*oshikaeshi, oshimodoshi, * and *bukkaeshi—* admit that this involved a modicum of violence. Th

e concept of “returning a child” appears as early as 1584 in a letter from a Northeastern warlord \(Date Masamune, no less\) to a retainer, and resurfaces in bans, laments, and moral suasion texts beginning in the 1680s.18 Th ere is a vexing 

lack of precision in accounts of the return destination for infant souls. Although the world of spirits waiting for their birth was a concept of folk belief rather than of organized religion, its hold on people’s imaginations was no less potent. Even in Buddhist cosmology, a dead infant would not join the descent of recently deceased adults into the Ten Hells with their law courts of ten demon kings. Hell scrolls generally show infants lingering on Sainokawara, the near bank of the river of the Underworld, where they play with pebbles and huddle around the hems of Jizō, the kindly bodhisattva. 

Th

at parents did not forget such children is suggested by the innumerable Jizō 

statues that by the eighteenth century lined roadsides and sacred precincts throughout Japan. Warmed by their signature red bibs and amused by brightly colored windmills and other toys and foods that delight children, they continue to be active sites of prayer to this day.19 With their long history, they are distinct from the \(usually smaller\) Jizō statues that are central to *mizuko kuyō * rites for aborted children. Temples marketed these so successfully that in the postwar period, many cemeteries acquired a stepped platform on which the little markers stand in serried ranks, mothers’ sculpted apologies to the little beings that they could or would not to carry to term. As Helen Hardacre, one of the foremost students of this practice, has argued, mizuko kuyō has as much to do with the eff orts of savvy religious entrepreneurs who amplifi ed and exploited the regrets of women as with 

“traditional” views of fetal life.20

In the seventeenth century, not even the rulers of Japan treated fetuses and newborns as human beings. With the exception of Tsunayoshi’s “Laws of  

17/04/13 3:54 PM

Humans, Animals, and Newborn Children 51

Compassion” of the 1680s, which famously also protected various kinds of animals, the legal practice of the shogunate showed little concern for fetal life. Even during Tsunayoshi’s reign, abortionists plied their trade without much fear of molestation. In 1680, a man in Edo killed a servant called Tama when he performed an abortion on her; because there had been no premeditation to kill the pregnant woman, he was only sentenced to house arrest.21 His intent to destroy the fetus attracted neither comment nor punishment. In the same years, shogunal executioners would occasionally kill unborn children when putting to death their mother. Only aft er 1792 were pregnant convicts allowed to give birth to their child before facing the executioners.22

Th

e authorities even seem to have routinely ordered abortions and infanticides for political reasons. Aft er Emperor Go-Mizuo \(r. 1611–1629\) married the daughter of Shogun Tokugawa Hidetada, all children he sired on other women were condemned to abortion or infanticide.23 A concubine who conceived the child of Date Munekatsu \(1621–1679\), the banished uncle of the Sendai lord, was ordered to kill her child.24 Tokugawa Mitsukuni \(1628–1701\), lord of Mito, was born alive only because his mother disobeyed his father’s instructions to have him aborted. In spite of his own narrow escape, it is said that he grew up to command his own concubines to abort all children he fathered on them.25

In the same years, a small number of decrees banned infanticide and ordered abortionists to be discrete about their trade.26 However, such bans were rare and appealed to obedience or compassion, not to a fear of vengeful spirits. By contrast, a shogunal decree of 1665, which urged villagers to treat their farm animals kindly, warned that the spirits of horses and bulls were known to drive their erstwhile tormentors into an early death.27

All this suggests that for much of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, infants and fetuses were widely thought to inhabit a diff erent ontological category than full human beings. As long as there was general agreement that newborns had only a liminal hold on life, lacked human status, and did not possess the power of more mature souls, there was little occasion for anyone to record these views in detail. Much of our best evidence on how the culture of infanticide regarded the cosmic place of infants therefore derives from the subsequent period, in which infanticide became a subject of contestation. Among the materials of this transition period, the paperwork of the pregnancy surveillance systems is a particularly precious source, for these documents sometimes capture the ways in which women thought about their pregnant bodies and imagined their unborn children. In a careful reading of such materials from Sendai and Tsuyama, Sawayama Mikako has demonstrated that women referred to a fetus younger than fi ve months as

“a thing without human shape.”28 Table 1 expands Sawayama’s analysis to other domains. Terms such as fetus \( *tai*\) or baby \( *akago*\) appear only from the fi ft h month on. Even for miscarriages in the fi nal months of a pregnancy, many men and women preferred to speak of a *ryūzan, * “spilled birth,” which did not concede any explicit humanity to the fetus. When the terms do recognize the fetus as a living being, they may refl ect the infl uence of the pregnancy surveillance systems, with their demand for forensic precision. Sawayama raises the possibility that such requirements actually changed the understandings of the beginning of life.29 As so oft en, then, the act of observing may have altered the phenomenon observed, in this case popular understandings of fetal life. 

Th

roughout the Edo period, the beginning of life was not well defi ned. Human beings were not simply conceived or born; rather, they had to grow to that loft y status in an extended, gradual process. As the dividing line around the fi ft h month in Table 1 suggests, the quickening of the fetus held special signifi cance. In his medical handbook of 1695, Hozumi Hoan noted that before the fourth month, the fetus \( *tai*\) had yet to form.30 Before the nineteenth century, most depictions of the interior of the womb showed human shapes only from the fi ft h month on. During the fi rst four months, the unborn child was represented by Buddhist symbols such as the vajra thunderbolt.31 Although the fi rst anatomically accurate drawings of the stages of pregnancy appeared in 1775 in Kagawa Genteki’s *Sanron yoku, * it took many years for such images to trickle through to a wider audience.32 Th

e older diagrams did not vanish

from circulation until the Meiji period. Since they were oft en included in one of the best-loved genres of Edo-period print capitalism, *ōraimono* almanacs, they continued to shape the views of a majority well into the nineteenth century.33 As a result, abortions before the second half of the pregnancy were not even necessarily considered abortions, but an “acceleration” of the menstrual fl ow \( *gessui hayanagashi*\).34

Although fetuses were usually said to be “dropped” rather than “killed,” the conceptual distinction between a fetus and an infant was less clear in other ways. 

Th

e term *ko *\(child\) could equally apply to a fetus from the fi ft h month, to a newborn, and to an older child. For example, those who did not want to bear a fetus to term might try a *kogaeshi* \(“return-the-child”\) spell.35 Much as in English, which has to resort to Latin, a separate term for fetus existed only in learned—that is, Chinese—speech: *tai * or *taiji. * Because pregnant women imagined fetuses sucking milk in their womb, spontaneous abortions were commonly described as “the child has let go of the breasts/the milk” \( *chi wo hanare*\). According to one popular almanac, in the seventh month the fetus “opened the seven orifi ces and began to taste the sweetness of milk, hear sounds, see light, and perceive smell. . . . When it has reached this point, it possesses the shape of a human being.” By the eighth month, “the soul \( *tamashii*\) is in the baby’s \( *akago*\) belly, and its true shape ripens.” 

By the ninth month, “it drinks 1 shō 3 gō \[2.3 liters\!\] of milk every night.”36

A child’s acceptance was marked by a number of rituals—a fi rst bath, the fi rst clipping of a lock, the fi rst clothes.37 From the practice of infanticide, we know that the parents’ decision in the immediate aft ermath of a birth conferred many of the protections of human status on a newborn. Th

e doctors of the medical academy of 

Ichinoseki noted that “once people have wrapped \[the newborn child\] in a rag, they will not do anything cruel to it, come what may.”38 Although diarrhea and smallpox routinely killed infants, people throughout the Japanese archipelago were as attached to their small children as parents anywhere in the early modern world. Th

e shogunate was moved to warn parents against “spoiling their children with love” as early as 1665, and generations of European visitors to Japan commented on how tenderly Japanese adults treated children.39

Not even the fi ercest critics of infanticide doubted the attachment of parents to those children they chose to raise. One of Mito’s most careful writers of this subject matter observed that if parents were persuaded not to kill a particular newborn and a month had passed, they would spend sleepless nights if that child showed the slightest sign of being indisposed.40 One pamphlet observed that parents who had killed other children were “grief-stricken at the loss of a toddler,” ** **and the lord of Yonezawa believed that people were only likely to commit infanticide “when \[a child\] is born and does not yet speak, at a time when \[parental\] love has not yet stirred.”41 Infanticide in Japan was, almost invariably, neonaticide. 

However, even the parents’ ritual acceptance did not establish the newborn child as a full human being. For all that parental acceptance was an important milestone,  

17/04/13 3:54 PM

54 The Culture of Low Fertility

the journey from a “thing without human shape” to full membership in the community took years and was marked by a series of rites of passage. For example, on the seventh night, families would hold a special celebration with the midwife and relatives; aft er thirty days, they would present the child to the deity of the local shrine and visit the houses of relatives to present gift s of *sekihan *\(rice with red beans\).42 Th e live 

birth statistics in Tsuyama’s castletown did not include children who died before their seventh night.43 In several domains of Central Japan, children were added to population registers only years aft er their birth.44 Th

e gradualist understanding of human life 

could have emotional implications; in 1809, a physician lamented that many people thought it was better for children to catch smallpox young, since the loss of a toddler would be less sad than that of an older child or an adult.45

Th

e spirits of toddlers were feared little more than those of newborns. Th eir 

burial was oft en perfunctory, and it is uncertain whether a majority received Buddhist funerary rites before the nineteenth century. When Shogun Tsunayoshi, famous for his attempts to protect small children, issued a decree about proper mourning periods, he required only three days of abstinence \( *enryo*\) but no mourning \( *fuku*\) for children under seven years. By 1698, popular almanacs reported these rules as a custom.46 Th

is is not to say that parents just moved on 

aft er the death of a toddler, only that the treatment of dead children was quite separate from that of deceased adults. In the 1690s, a German traveler along the Tōkaidō highway observed the following ritual site:

Just outside the gate, on the shore, stood a row of fi ve poor little wooden chapels. Th e 

fi rst two had a carved bust of an old woman on their altar and in each sat a priest or a monk, playing the Namu Amida Butsu on a bell. . . . Th ose on foot in our train 

threw the priests some kansen or pennies, whereupon each of them received a piece of paper with letters written on it. Baring their head, they took the paper to the shore and fastened it near the water with a stone, because people believe that here under the water is the prison or inferno of children who died before they reached the age of seven and must do penance until they reach salvation. Since these priests teach that the souls obtain relief, if not salvation, when a piece of paper with certain names and sacred characters is cleansed by water, people want to take the occasion to do a good deed, perhaps for their own or related children, believing that as soon as the waves wash away the letters, the souls will also enjoy refreshment.47

For centuries, Jōdoshinshū priests, while proud of their solicitude toward small children, debated whether infants were covered by Amida’s vow to have all who put their faith in him reborn in his Pure Land Paradise. In 1736, Reitan \(1689–1769\) noted disapprovingly that many of his fellow priests in Etchū and Shinjō believed that children under fi ft een years did not have the faculty to put their faith into Amida’s vow, which therefore did not cover them. According to the same men, especially children younger than about fi ve or seven were no diff erent from animals \( *chikushō*\), unable to achieve rebirth in the Pure Land.48 Although  

17/04/13 3:54 PM

Humans, Animals, and Newborn Children 55

ordinary believers evidently agreed that children did not in themselves possess the power to be reborn in the Pure Land, they also seemed to think they could work around this problem. Th

roughout the Jōdoshinshū lands, parents would take a 

child into the temple a few days aft er its birth, chant the *nenbutsu* in its stead, and ask Amida to grant it salvation.49

Elsewhere, people simply accepted that small children inhabited a diff erent category of life than mature human beings. A journal entry that the haikai master Matsuo Bashō wrote in 1684 is a well-known illustration of such attitudes. On the bank of a river, he came across a sobbing three-year-old child abandoned there. “Assailed by the autumn wind, the blossoms on the bush clover plant will surely scatter tonight or wither in the morning,” he mused, gave the child some food, and then left him to his fate. Bashō, who was capable of empathy with a trapped octopus or a chrysanthemum blooming bravely in the frost, saw the child as little more than an evocation of evanescence.50 Bashō’s fi nal words on the encounter are less than stirring: “Th

is is Heaven’s doing; weep that you were born 

unlucky.”51

Even some of the authors of infanticide pamphlets did not consider newborn children human beings. Th

is startling fact is evident from the statement in *On* *Childrearing, * one of the most infl uential such texts, that “killing a newborn child is no diff erent from killing a person \( *hito*\).” Even in denying it, *On Childrearing* had not quite moved beyond the distinction between babies and persons, for it could instead have stated that “killing a newborn is no diff erent from killing an adult” or “to kill an infant is to kill a human being.”52 When the scholar Nagakubo Sekisui outlined a system of pregnancy surveillance to the lord of Mito, he argued that infanticide should not be punished by execution, lest the domain exacerbate its depopulation problem. He granted, however, that execution was still the proper punishment for the “greatest crimes,” a category in which he presumably included the murder of adults. If even critics of infanticide could not bring themselves to think of infants as fully human, the common people of infanticidal areas seem to have had few doubts about the ethics of infanticide.53 Perhaps it was no hyperbole when *On Childrearing* complained that people did not “even realize that infanticide is inhumane.”54

T H E T O L E R A N C E O F P R I E S T S A N D D O C T O R S

Although Buddhist arguments and Buddhist priests would later become prominent in the fi ght against infanticide, the cosmology of institutional Buddhism long played its part in trivializing the practice. Since souls cycled endlessly, the victims of infanticide would have an infi nite number of other chances. Between death and rebirth, the bodhisattva Jizō comforted infant souls forcibly returned to the spirit world. 

No wonder, then, that in 1791 Kuroha Jirōemon, a rural offi cial of Mito domain, 

 

17/04/13 3:54 PM

56 The Culture of Low Fertility

complained that even old women with a fondness for Buddhism did not shrink from infanticide.55 In some circles, the Buddhist establishment itself drew blame; Miyaoi Sadao, a headman in Shimōsa who disliked the clergy on several grounds, illustrated one of his works with a priest worshipping his Buddha image while turning his back on a woman crushing a newborn as well as on various other acts of violence.56

Yet some exceptional priests made the correction of infanticide their cause even before it became a popular mission in the late eighteenth century. In the 1610s, Tonryū Shōnin of Taikōin in Ōta \(modern Gunma\) diverted funds for the rebuilding of his temple to turn it into a foundling home. In the 1720s, Eiten of Zuiun’in in Shinjō \(modern Yamagata\) gave money to poor families with many children and preached against the evils of infanticide. In the 1750s, Gihan of Shinkōji in Shibukawa \(also modern Gunma\) so impressed the locals with his fervor that they commemorated his fi ght against infanticide with a handsome Jizō statue.57 To put this into perspective, however, for every anti-infanticide activist at this time there was probably a campaigner against meat-eating. Buddhist hell scrolls, a genre that fi rst thrived in the medieval period, occasionally show animals appearing before the courts of hell as plaintiff s against their butchers.58 To my knowledge, only one scroll with an infanticide theme survives whose style suggests that it was painted before the end of the eighteenth century, and it is not exclusively devoted to the punishment of infanticide: Just above a midwife killing a newborn in a birthing chamber, two armies meet in battle. *Jōhari no kagami, * the Demon King’s magic mirror whose shiny surface replays the deeds of the soul on trial, shows a man wielding a sword rather than a woman crushing an infant.59

Priests were not alone in their toleration. As long as populations were stable, few commentators showed concern about the fate of Eastern Japan’s unwanted newborns. From the 1670s, several scholars wrote with moral indignation and in perceptive detail about infanticide and abortion, but their treatises would not add up to a sustained discourse for another century.60 

Th

e religious and intellectual elites expressed even fewer scruples about induced abortion. Zenkōji, a major pilgrim destination in the mountains of Central Japan, even sold amulets for abortion, which it deplored as a serious evil but acknowledged as unavoidable in certain situations. Whatever the morality of abortion, the amulets pointed out, the only way to get to paradise was anyway to put one’s faith in the Amida Buddha.61 Hozumi Hoan, a domain physician of Mito, condemned infanticide but was ambivalent about cutting short a pregnancy. When he compiled a collection of recipes for popular distribution in 1695, he called abortion an act of 

“great unkindness,” but then went on to review the effi

cacy and safety of various 

abortifacients.62 More general almanacs also gave a nod to the distasteful nature of abortion but included instructions on how to restore a woman’s menstrual fl ow or rid her of an unwanted fetus.63 Abortion services, whether through pharmaceuticals or surgery, were provided by physicians who prided themselves on their education.

If prints of women squatting in outhouses—a surprisingly vibrant genre—are anything to go by, abortion ads were ubiquitous in Edo and other Japanese cities of the eighteenth century.64 Posters advertising “freedom pills” \( *jiyūgan*\) and the “early fl ow of the menses” \( *gessui hayanagashi*\) covered bathroom walls and fences and were handed out as fl iers by eager service providers.65 One placard reportedly stated, 

“to be pregnant is marvelous; not to be pregnant is also marvelous.”66

Th

is is not to say that all parents practiced infanticide and abortion without any sense of guilt, shame, or fear.67 In the mid–eighteenth century, an investigation into the rapidly dwindling population of a district of Kumamoto domain in Kyushu revealed sixteen women in one cluster of villages who made a handsome living by charging parents in neighboring settlements 20 monme in silver for suff ocating a newborn.68 Th

at parents were evidently happy to pay for not having 

to kill an unwanted newborn themselves raises two possibilities. Perhaps parents found infanticide simply unpleasant physically and emotionally, rather like modern meat-eaters who gladly pay a butcher and enjoy their steaks. It is equally possible that they found the act of infanticide polluting or karmically dangerous. 

From the mid–eighteenth century, we fi nd scattered examples of monuments erected for the benefi t and pacifi cation of the victims of infanticide. One of the fi rst such markers was raised in Mamurokawa in Dewa in 1756, in the immediate aft ermath of the worst famine this area had suff ered in the memory of its inhabitants.69 

Perhaps some starving parents found themselves reduced to killing or abandoning older children, a tragic detail that famine accounts relate from other parts of eighteenth-century Northern Japan.70 It is also possible that the terrible death toll struck people as Heaven’s punishment and shocked them into reconsidering practices that had seemed unproblematic a little earlier. 

Here and there, similar statues dedicated to the bodhisattva of childrearing appeared in mid-eighteenth-century Japan. For example, an egg peddler and poet-aster in Tosa punned about a roadside Jizō statue for returned children in the 1750s, and in the 1760s the inhabitants of Shibukawa in Kōzuke raised a Kosodate \(“childrearing”\) Jizō in honor of the aforementioned priest Gihan.71 A 1794 guide to sites sacred to Jizō included a Kogaeshi Jizō, or “Jizō of returned children,” in the outskirts of Edo, though whether that particular Jizō ended inconvenient pregnancies or took care of dead infants is not specifi ed.72

Equally ambiguous is the function of memorial markers \( *kuyōtō*\) that began to appear in rapidly increasing numbers around the same time in the Tonegawa watershed of the Kantō. Associations of women \( *nyoninkō*\) paid for them, but the markers were not specifi cally dedicated to the victims of infanticide. However, it is

suggestive that they do not specify their benefi ciaries and were commissioned by women’s groups, some of which have also left us other memorial objects with direct depictions of infanticide.73 At least in the Kantō, the areas with the most active nyoninkō also roughly coincided with those districts where remnants of the culture of infanticide were the most entrenched in the late Meiji period.74 Th e 

function that these stones fi lled must have been very important to their sponsors, considering that these oft en large monuments were expensive and broke repeated laws that banned them as wasteful extravagance.75

In the great cities, which lay outside the areas of uninhibited infanticide, the eighteenth-century treatment of aborted fetuses similarly suggests mixed feelings. 

While the jostling crowds of *mizuko * statues in many temples are a postwar phenomenon, the fear of fetal spirits does have precursors. By 1800, abortionists in Edo apparently included a 200 mon charge in their medical fee of 1 ryō 2 bu and used it for a memorial for the aborted child at Ekōin, a temple in Edo’s Shitamachi neighborhood.76 It is not clear whether the gynecologists collected the donations primarily for the benefi t of the fetuses, that of their mothers, or to protect themselves from spirit attacks. Th

ey may even have done so with an eye 

to the authorities. 

Ekōin specialized in the posthumous care of the nameless victims of the great urban fi res as well as other abandoned humans \( *muenbotoke*\). Aborted fetuses may have been a logical addition to this company of unfortunates, but Ekōin’s famous mound for aborted “water children” \( *mizuko-zuka*\) was not built in response to popular demand, but rather was the deliberate creation in 1793 of Matsudaira Sadanobu, the shogun’s senior councillor and an avid promoter of population growth. At the time, memorials for fetuses and newborns were still so rare that in his memoirs, Sadanobu counted his mizuko mound among the three projects of his career that gave him the most pleasure to recall.77

Evidence of unease about infanticides and abortions must be considered in the wider context of Edo-period attitudes toward animal souls. Although meat-eating was far more widespread than today’s popular image of the Edo period would have us believe, the taking of animal lives was never entirely unproblematic.78 Along with its care of human *muenbotoke, * Ekōin also performed the rituals for dead animals.79 On the coast, whalers routinely held funerals for the bones of their catch. 

While fetuses and even infants would oft en be excluded from the rites of Funerary Buddhism, whales frequently received the full range of ritual treatment. Priests inscribed the giant mammals’ posthumous names \( *kaimyō*\) in the same type of ledger of the dead \( *kakochō*\) that they used to schedule the observances that would transform a dead parishioner into an ancestral spirit.80 Th is was no isolated

practice; in fi ft y places between Hakodate and the coast of Kyushu, including areas of Western Japan known for infanticide, whalers held kuyō services for their prey and raised stone markers in their honor;81 in some locations, such eff orts are attested by 1679.82 Retired horses were not forgotten either. Batō \(“horse head”\) Kannon statues guarded roadsides and old horse cemeteries \( *umasuteba*\) and are especially numerous in the North Kantō and the Northeast, which had some of Japan’s densest equine populations.83

Even insects and plants became the benefi ciaries of kuyō rights. In Kaga, a man who had successfully defended his fi elds with oil-based insecticide erected a memorial mound for the locusts he slew in the process.84 A story from Shinano tells of a sericulturalist who heard the screams of ten million voices from his drying rack for cocoons and felt obliged to enlist the help of a monk and a thousand-armed Kannon.85 In southeastern Dewa in the Northeast, one survey counted thirty-two Edo-period kuyō markers for “grasses and trees,” the oldest dating from about 1780.86

Th

e motivations for such practices were twofold. On the one hand, kuyō was a means of avoiding the revenge \( *tatari*\) of a wronged being. Th e “grasses and trees” 

of Dewa, for example, had the power to strike back at humans as logs shooting down the Mogami River. Whales may have been prominent among the nonhuman benefi ciaries of kuyō in part because whaling was such a dangerous undertaking. 

At the same time, whales were credited with greater powers than the thrash of a mighty tail fi n. When in a whaling town in Kii, a series of children were born mis-shapen, a priest from the Jōdoshinshū headquarters in Kyoto advised the locals to raise a kuyōtō for their cetacean prey.87

Th

e other attraction of kuyō was that it promised to amend the bad karma that arose from taking a life. In an exhortatory pamphlet, the Buddhist priest Taiken of Rinnōji in Sendai assumed that people who killed infants would still seek to cultivate good luck \( *fukuriki*\) by releasing small birds and fi sh in ritual contexts.88 Th is 

may have implied that they assigned not much greater karmic weight to the destruction of a fetus than to the saving of a bird or fi sh. Like Arai Nobuaki in southern Sendai, where silkworm memorials moved him to poetry, a shogunal intendant found that in parts of western Honshu and the Kantō people were reluctant to kill even small bugs but still strangled their own newborn children.89

Unlike infants, then, animals were recognized as fully formed vessels, potentially powerful and inhabiting a similar ethical sphere as humans, and even occasionally subsumed in the same cosmological category as humans \( *ikimono*\).90 Th is proximity could make them an existential threat to humans. Humanity was a privilege that had to be maintained with eff ort. Later opponents of infanticide would praise monkeys and horses, pheasants and ants, for their devotion to their young. Before

that discursive shift , people focused not on the exemplary aff ection of feathered or furry mothers, but on the uncontrolled nature of animal reproduction. In 1677, for example, Sendai domain worried in a decree that its people were “multiplying wantonly like the brood of birds and beasts.”91

Th

e shame \( *haji*\) of raising more than two or three children echoes through the many laments about widespread infanticide from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.92 In many cases, such shame seems to have derived from the implication that unrestrained reproduction possessed an animalic quality. Miyaoi Sadao, who has been mentioned for his animus against Buddhism, complained that if * * in a village nearly everybody practiced infanticide, the rare person who raised many children would be ridiculed as behaving “like a dog.” Miyaoi also claimed that he had eradicated infanticide from his own village in Shimōsa, whereupon outsiders who were fond of \( *konomu*\) infanticide would sneer that Miyaoi’s villagers “raised children without any limits, like dogs rearing their pups.”93 Miyaoi is not above the suspicion of rhetorical hyperbole, but his threefold repetition of the dog epithet in a single chapter suggests real annoyance at an actual such comment.94

Th

e image of dogs as reproducing recklessly may have been part of the lore left by Shogun Tsunayoshi’s “Laws of Compassion,” which from the 1680s protected both infants and a range of animals, from horses and cows to birds and fi shes. 

Most famously, they exacerbated the stray dog problem in the city of Edo as owners abandoned dogs they could no longer beat and puppies they could no longer drown.95 One contemporary critic, Toda Mosui, was so impressed with the canines’ generative power that he calculated that “what were two dogs this spring will become 152 of them by next autumn.”96 His judgment of the Laws of Compassion was damning: “By affl

icting people with great diffi

culties, our lord’s tender 

feelings \( *go-jihi*\) result in cruelty \( *mu-jihi*\).”97

Th

e Laws of Compassion were widely resented and Tsunayoshi’s successor rescinded them immediately. However, their failure may have supplied future generations with a memorable metaphor for why the lives of some beings had to be sacrifi ced to the weightier interests of others. Th

at such trade-off s were permissi-

ble is the claim of a sales jingle of the Chūjō school of abortionists. Around 1700, with Tsunayoshi still in power, they apparently pitched their services in a rhetorical question that sums up the cosmological underpinnings of infanticide: “What fault \( *toga*\) is there in killing a small bug to help a big bug?”98
