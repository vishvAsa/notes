  <p>of Infanticide</p>
<p>In the last two chapters, we have seen why the barriers to infanticide were relatively low and how killing newborns could be justifi ed as benefi ting the household’s dead, living, and future members. Th</p>
<p>e latter argument rested in part on the</p>
<p>logic of the stem family, but was also rooted in a particular view of the costs and benefi ts of childrearing. Th</p>
<p>is chapter examines four material contexts for infanti-</p>
<p>cide: poverty; the opportunity cost of diverting the mother’s work from production to reproduction; the limited value of children as producers; and the expense of raising a child properly in a world of many consumption choices.</p>
<p>For fi ve centuries, infanticide in Japan has oft en been described and even justifi ed as a response to desperate poverty. As we shall see, this is not an adequate characterization; villagers of all classes—and probably also townsmen and warriors—routinely “returned” unwanted newborns. Th</p>
<p>e childrearing ways of the</p>
<p>poor diff ered from those of the rich in degree, not in kind. Th ey followed the same</p>
<p>internal logic and shared the same understandings of time, prudence, security, and social obligations.</p>
<p>A S H O RT H I S T O R I O G R A P H Y O F P OV E RT Y</p>
<p>A N D I N FA N T I C I D E</p>
<p>In Japan, the interpretation of infanticide has long hinged on whether it was a symptom of desperate misery or part of the pursuit of better living standards. Th is</p>
<p>is equally true of Edo-period writers and modern historians. Inevitably and appropriately, historians have read the record of the Edo period according to the concerns of their own time—the nature of class relations, the preconditions 69</p>
<p>17/04/13 3:54 PM</p>
<p>70 The Culture of Low Fertility</p>
<p>for economic development, the urgency of restraining unsustainable population growth. Many Edo-period commentators complained that avarice or a love of luxury drove people into killing newborns that they could easily have aff orded to raise. At the same time, poverty was such a common explanation for infanticide that it persuaded more than fi ft y governments to devote large sums to the relief of poor families with many children. Th</p>
<p>at poverty was considered a compelling</p>
<p>excuse for infanticide in at least some quarters is evident from an 1802 ban, which threatened “people who live in comfort but practice infanticide” with sterner punishments than their poorer neighbors.1 Even in the Meiji period, convictions for abortions could bear light sentences if a credible poverty excuse existed.2</p>
<p>Poverty was already a major theme in some of the fi rst accounts of infanticide in Japan. In their fi rst letter about the fabled island kingdom, written in the Indian city of Cochin in 1548, the Jesuits noted that the Japanese killed some of their children because they felt it was better for them to die than to live in poverty.3 Th at fi rst</p>
<p>description probably refl ects a Japanese opinion; it was a digest of information that the Jesuits had gleaned from Anjirō, a fugitive from Satsuma whom they had met and converted in Malacca. One of the fi rst Jesuits to reach Japan, Gaspar Vilela, confi rmed Anjirō’s account. Japanese parents, he wrote, believed that children would “not suff er as much in the hour [of their violent death] as they would in all the time that they live in poverty.” Accordingly, infanticide was especially frequent in years of “meager cows,” which, Vilela said, walked the land every four or fi ve years.4 At the same time, the Jesuits observed that infanticide was also common among sections of the “nobility” (that is, warriors), and that some people killed children because they wanted to avoid the trouble of raising them.5</p>
<p>In the Edo period, proclaiming poverty the cause of infanticide had attractions for many parties.6 It exonerated the poor from the charge of moral depravity, allowed them to insinuate a criticism of bad government, and promised to benefi t them materially through subsidies. It allowed intellectuals to use infanticide as a vehicle for a varied agenda of political and social reform. Rulers, in turn, could enact their claims to benevolent governance through the disbursal of childrearing subsidies. Th</p>
<p>e symbolism was not noticeably tarnished if the funds did not originate in the domain treasury but the purses of ambitious commoners. To such men, the poverty-infanticide link provided an opportunity to transform fi nancial into social and political capital, both in their village and in the palace of their lord. Protecting the infants of the poor showcased a man’s compassion and his role as a pillar of the state. Th</p>
<p>e fact that poverty was oft en a neutral ground</p>
<p>on which diff erent parties could agree may explain why it also features in a rare direct admission of past infanticides that a group of mostly female townspeople in Shimōsa submitted to their intendant, presumably in response to an offi cial</p>
<p>requirement: “Due to poverty,” they wrote, “we have not been able to raise our children.”7</p>
<p>17/04/13 3:54 PM</p>
<p>The Material and Moral Economy 71</p>
<p>Th</p>
<p>e poverty hypothesis has also appealed to scholars surveying the Edo period from the vantage point of the twentieth century. For those celebrating the recent achievements of their country, the successes of Imperial Japan shone all the brighter before the backdrop of misery and stagnation under shogunal rule.</p>
<p>For historians of a Marxist persuasion, infanticide illustrated the reality of feudal oppression in the Tokugawa period. E. H. Norman (1909–1957) contemplated the</p>
<p>“bitter, grinding life of the peasant” and described infanticide as a form of passive resistance against feudal exactions.8 Ono Takeo (1883–1949) similarly saw it as a form of popular resistance as well as an attempt to “alleviate the hardship of life.”9</p>
<p>Honjō Eijirō (1888–1973), an authority on economic and demographic history, concluded that exploitation and subsistence crises were the root causes of infanticide.10 Such analyses not only fl attered established theoretical frameworks; they also made sense in the context in which these scholars wrote. Th e rural crisis of the</p>
<p>1930s—especially severe in the once infamously infanticidal Northeast—made it easy to envision Tokugawa peasants as desperately poor. By the late 1940s, a consensus had emerged that economic distress justifi ed abortions. In 1949, the National Diet voted to permit abortion if there was “a risk that the continuation of the pregnancy or parturition would seriously harm the mother’s health for physical or economic reasons.” A range of concerns and vested interests lay behind this revision, but it is revealing that “economic reasons,” rather than women’s right to choose or a negation of fetal personhood, defi ned the language of consensus in 1949.11</p>
<p>Just as poverty was a well-worn excuse for infanticide during the Edo period, Japanese historians of later generations were able to exonerate their ancestors from charges of moral depravity by explaining infanticide as the desperate resort of the destitute.12 Th</p>
<p>e etiology of infanticide aff ected the very status of Japan as a civilized nation. Beginning in the late eighteenth century, a domestic discourse saw infanticide as the barbarous custom of uncivilized peripheries. In addition, the Europeans whom the people of Meiji Japan encountered understood infanticide as either the act of savages or the last resort of fallen women and the desperately poor. To conclude that infanticide was practiced irrespective of wealth and poverty would have placed Tokugawa Japan outside the circle of civilized nations. It is suggestive that already in the 1870s, Meiji offi</p>
<p>cials stressed the role of poverty and despair in discussions with a foreign legal advisor on how to punish abortion in Japan’s new legal code.13 One hundred and thirty years later, the most common popular view of Edo-period infanticide that I encountered in conversations with municipal employees, priests, lay owners of infanticide tablets, was something along the lines of “they had nothing to eat, so their only resort was to kill their children.”14 One priest, whose temple displays a huge votive tablet with an infanticide scene and lies in a district in which about one-third of babies were reported stillborn in the 1890s, reasoned that since the area had long been prosperous, infanticide could not have been a local</p>
<p>17/04/13 3:54 PM</p>
<p>72 The Culture of Low Fertility</p>
<p>custom. Elsewhere, infanticide is cited as evidence for the poverty of a particular region, such as the Northeast, whose supposed economic backwardness in the Edo period is more diffi</p>
<p>cult to establish with other indicators. In one instance of this uncritical equation of infanticide and poverty, Yanagita Kunio, the pioneer of folklore studies in Japan and an offi</p>
<p>cial at the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce,</p>
<p>recalled the reason why as a thirteen-year-old boy he decided to devote his life to agricultural improvement: shocked by an infanticide tablet at a local temple, he refl ected that it was necessary “to eradicate the tragedy of famine that left [people]</p>
<p>no other choice.”15 Th</p>
<p>at local temple stood on the banks of the Tonegawa not far from Tokyo, in a region where famines had not been an existential problem in the Edo period, and the painted woman killed her baby in a room whose furnishings suggested comfort rather than destitution (see Plate 2 in this chapter).</p>
<p>In the postwar decades, poverty lost some of its explanatory attraction. Many historians now sought the roots of Japan’s then unique success as a non-Western society in the economic dynamism of the Edo period.16 Japan’s exclusive membership in what was otherwise a Western club of rich and developed nations required explanation. In the 1970s, Th</p>
<p>omas Smith and Robert Eng analyzed infanticide as</p>
<p>evidence for the proactive, rational attitude of eighteenth-century farmers and proto-industrialists.17 Susan Hanley and Kozo Yamamura discerned “a remarkable similarity” between Tokugawa Japan and “pre- and early-industrial population trends in Europe,” but “no similarity at all” with “the other nations of Asia today.”18</p>
<p>James Nakamura and Matao Miyamoto saw the Japanese stem family system as fostering “population control and long-run investment,” in contrast with the Chinese family system, which, they thought, failed to produce either.19</p>
<p>Th</p>
<p>is new appreciation for the family life of Edo-period villagers coincided with the height of public concern over the population explosion in Th ird World countries, which many saw trapped in a downward spiral of population growth and shrinking per-capita incomes. If in the mid–twentieth century, the world’s poorest people averaged fertility rates of around six children per woman, why should the poor of the Edo period have been unable to raise more than two or three? Th e</p>
<p>salubriously slow population growth of the Edo period off ered a plausible explanation for Japan’s ability to join the ranks of developed nations with such memorable rapidity.20 Th</p>
<p>e reproductive restraint of Edo-period villagers also promised to serve as an inspiration for Th</p>
<p>ird World citizens, but to play this role eff ectively, it needed to be the result of a rational mindset, not of desperate poverty. In 1975, the founding issue of the *Population and Development Review, * which soon became one of the leading journals in its fi eld, opened with an article that took Tokugawa Japan as a key example for how community-level incentives could reduce unsustainable population growth.21</p>
<p>Th</p>
<p>e crucial step in dissociating infanticide and abortion from poverty appears to have been to recognize them as a means of family limitation. When in 1958 Irene</p>
<p>17/04/13 3:54 PM</p>
<p>The Material and Moral Economy 73</p>
<p>Taeuber wrote her magisterial survey of Japan’s demography, Japanese families looked to abortion as the main means of family planning.22 Taeuber saw this as the continuation of a much older pattern: “Among the Japanese there were fundamental similarities in the cultural conditioning of, and the individual motivations in, the limitation of family size in the Tokugawa and the modern worlds. Th e pressure</p>
<p>of numbers on subsistence and the misery of poverty do not explain the control of fertility in industrial society; they did not explain the abortion and the infanticide of the agrarian society.”23 A little later, Susan Hanley encapsulated the view that Edo-period infanticide anticipated modern family planning in her memorable phrase “post-partum birth control.”24 In a world where the rich had few and the poor had many children, it was no longer intuitive to see aggressive family planning as a response to destitution.</p>

<p>Th</p>
<p>e demographic evidence supports those who have doubted that poverty alone motivated infanticide. While the population registers do not give us precise information on the economic circumstances of each household, they oft en give us one rough indicator: its landholdings (Figure 6).25 For the purposes of analysis, it is convenient to stratify villagers into four groups: landless tenants and households dependent on others of higher status; small landholders of less than three koku, who would have found it diffi</p>
<p>cult to subsist on the product of their land alone;</p>
<p>middling farmers with three to ten koku of land; and households with more than ten koku of land, more than a stem family could easily work by itself. As a fertility analysis of these four classes reveals, the poor did indeed have fewer children than the rich. Th</p>
<p>e diff erences were large enough to imply distinct demographic trajectories. In most decades, landless villagers would have seen fewer than two of their children reach adulthood, while owners of ten koku or more generally averaged enough off spring to replace the previous generation.26</p>
<p>Th</p>
<p>e diff erences in fertility were too small, however, to imply that only the poor committed infanticide. As Chapter 7 will explain, it is possible to simulate the reproductive history of women and calculate how many infanticides or abortions were necessary to explain the observed level of fertility in the absence of abortions and contraception. If we simplify matters by assuming, unrealistically, that all such interventions were infanticides rather than abortions, each landholding stratum had at least one decade in the mid–eighteenth century in which the number of infanticides per woman must have exceeded three to explain the fertility observed (Figure 7).27 Figure 7 must, however, be treated with caution. It should not be taken to mean, for example, that the richest landowners killed almost no babies in the 1710s, but only that it is nearly possible to explain their observed fertility with their</p>

<p>ages at marriage and the pessimistic assumptions about coital frequencies and sterility that went into the simulation model.</p>
<p>One possible explanation for why all economic strata committed infanticide is that diff erent people killed infants for diff erent material reasons. Th is is the</p>
<p>suggestion of one of the most careful Edo-period analyses of infanticide. In 1791, Kuroha Jirōemon, headman of ten villages in northern Mito, wrote a policy proposal that identifi ed fi ve diff erent motives:</p>
<p>It is widely said that [infanticide] arises from poverty, but [to me] it would seem that people have a variety of motives beyond poverty and wealth.</p>
<p>• Th</p>
<p>ose who get pregnant soon [aft er a previous birth] and foresee that the milk will not suffi</p>
<p>ce for the older child, so that it is impossible to raise both children. . . .</p>
<p>• Th</p>
<p>ose who out of absolute destitution have no choice ( <em>muzehi</em>) but to return the child by force, unable to raise more than one or two.</p>
<p>• Th</p>
<p>ose who are of middling means but harbor such strong ambitions that they dislike the fact that children hinder the wife’s labor until their second or third year and cause various other expenses.</p>
<p>• Th</p>
<p>ose who, whether poor or rich, fi nd it painful to see their children without appropriate clothes and who dislike the fact that livelihoods will be slim indeed if, upon reaching adulthood, many children need to be established in their own branch households.</p>
<p>• Stupid women who themselves return the child by force to avoid the bitter troubles of raising a girl.28</p>
<p>While Kuroha’s categories deserve careful consideration, it is noteworthy that widely divergent material circumstances produced such a narrow range of fertility outcomes. It was within a unifi ed reproductive culture with a consistent fertility norm that the destitute concluded that there was no margin for another child, that middling villagers were unwilling to compromise their economic ambitions, and that aff ectionate parents of all ranks felt a concern for the long-term living standard of their children.</p>

<p>Poverty was a basic fact of life for millions of Tokugawa subjects. As we have just seen, however, it was not a necessary condition for infanticide. Nor, as Edo-period writers did not tire of stressing, was it a suffi</p>
<p>cient condition. In other parts of</p>
<p>Japan, they pointed out to their readers, the poor did not commit infanticide and still somehow managed to survive.29</p>
<p>Many governments (though by no means all) limited childrearing subsidies to the poor; applications for childrearing grants therefore give us some sense of what circumstances were considered particularly uncongenial for raising another child.</p>
<p>17/04/13 3:54 PM</p>
<p>The Material and Moral Economy 77</p>
<p>Th</p>
<p>ese frequently were not a simple matter of insuffi</p>
<p>cient land or assets, but</p>
<p>involved unfavorable dependency ratios, which were oft en caused by the sickness, death, or the departure of an adult member of the household.30</p>
<p>Another context in which raising a newborn child was a forbidding challenge was the hunger that stalked the villages of Eastern Japan with distressing frequency. In the work of many historians as well as the popular imagination, Tokugawa-period infanticide has long been linked to its terrible famines. Many eyewitness accounts tell of parents killing their children in the midst of desperate starvation. However, as the leading authority on Edo-period famines, Kikuchi Isao, points out, the children in such narratives were not usually infants.31 Since abandoning or killing an older child elicited universal dismay, it was a natural subject matter for famine accounts, a genre that dealt in the extraordinary. Infanticide did not possess the same power to drive home the horrors of famine, since its moral status remained contested, and because even those who found it repug-nant knew that infants were killed in times of plenty as well.</p>
<p>Th</p>
<p>ere is no question that famine created desperate circumstances, and that some infants died at the hands of their parents at such times. It is not clear, however, that their number was particularly large. Kikuchi raises the possibility that few children were conceived or born in times of famine. One large village in Sendai, for example, reported an annual average of thirty pregnancies during the 1820s. During the terrible famine year of 1837, however, the surveillance record claims that not a single woman became pregnant.32 It is of course possible that some women kept their pregnancies off the books and found ways to terminate them, but based on everything we know about famine in other populations, the record is credible. Acute starvation tends to prevent ovulation and therefore conception altogether; among women who do conceive, it induces high rates of fetal loss.33 Paradoxically, it is therefore likely that infanticide was actually less common during famines than in times of plenty.</p>
<p>Th</p>
<p>is leaves the possibility that the <em>prospect</em> of famine convinced many parents to kill some of their newborns. It is likely that most villagers expected to suff er at least one famine in their lifetimes, even in regions that ultimately escaped the worst ravages. One book written for an audience of farmers calculated that, on average, a truly terrible famine struck once per generation.34 It was written in Kurobane and published in Mito, both parts of the North Kantō that came through the hungry years of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries without major loss of life.</p>
<p>While it is plausible that many infanticides took place under the shadow of famine, this hypothesis is surprisingly diffi</p>
<p>cult to document. We would expect the</p>
<p>fear of famine to be particularly deeply felt in those areas that had suff ered most, and to be most insistent in the minds of survivors in the years immediately following such an event. Th</p>
<p>ere was, however, no simple geographical or chronological</p>
<p>17/04/13 3:54 PM</p>
<p>78 The Culture of Low Fertility</p>
<p>coincidence of famine and infanticide during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. To be sure, the eff ects of the worst famines rippled across the archipelago.</p>
<p>Even those who did not suff er bodily would have taken the stories of roadsides strewn with the emaciated bodies of refugees as a reminder that their own existence was fundamentally precarious. Nevertheless, somebody who had just narrowly survived a famine that killed a third of his immediate neighbors would surely dread a return of the hungry years more viscerally than would a casual reader of famine accounts.</p>
<p>In good years as well as bad, the names of the dead were entered into temple necrologies ( <em>kakochō</em>). Th</p>
<p>ese records make it possible to chart the geography of</p>
<p>famine with some precision.35 Although there was a partial overlap between lands most frequently visited by starvation and those most infamous for infanticide, such as Sendai, many of Japan’s regions in which infants were routinely killed were not especially vulnerable to famine. Th</p>
<p>is was true of the North Kantō; starvation</p>
<p>deaths were never recorded there in catastrophic numbers, but the region was so infamous for infanticide that the archipelago-wide shogunal ban of 1767 singled out two of its provinces. With its mild climate and diversifi ed economy, the Bōsō</p>
<p>Peninsula east of Edo weathered famines better than most areas, but by 1890 its districts reported Japan’s most extravagantly fi ctitious stillbirth rates. Th e Northeast has long been a byword for both famine and infanticide. Both were certainly frequent in its largest domain, Sendai. Yet no part of Japan suff ered more from famines than Hirosaki, where evidence for routine infanticide is equivocal. In other provinces that were infamous for infanticide, such as Tosa or Mimasaka, famines do not seem to have done greater damage than in provinces with better reputations, such as Aki or Echigo. Th</p>
<p>at the geographies of famine and frequent</p>
<p>infanticide do not align very well does not disprove the possible role of hunger in prompting parents in at least some areas to kill their newborn children. It does, however, complicate the easy syllogism of famine and infanticide.</p>
<p>Nor does chronology off er strong support for the hypothesis that the fear of famine was the major motivation for infanticide in Eastern Japan. Dewa suff ered terribly in the famine of the 1750s, but its fertility rates fl uctuated around the same level before and aft er the calamity. In Eastern Japan as a whole, the disastrous Tenmei era (1780s) set the stage for the retreat of infanticide. Fertility plunged during the Tenpō famine of the 1830s but rebounded in its aft ermath.</p>
<p>Th</p>
<p>ere are nonetheless cases in which the experience of famine may have spurred the spread of infanticide. In the domains of Matsue and Tottori on the north coast of western Honshu, infanticide was identifi ed as a problem only aft er the 1830s, when crop failures struck that region particularly hard. It is even possible that Eastern Japan’s culture of reproductive restraint arose in response to the historical experience of famine, passed from generation to generation as an ethic that assumed that survival required painful sacrifi ces. Since the culture of infanticide</p>
<p>17/04/13 3:54 PM</p>
<p>The Material and Moral Economy 79</p>
<p>predates the famines of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, a search for such a foundational trauma must look to earlier periods.</p>
<p>Hunger was not confi ned to the major famines. Seasons of need were frequent.</p>
<p>Since moderate malnutrition does not usually reduce fecundity, many such shortages were not severe enough to prevent or naturally shorten pregnancies.36 If infanticides were mostly short-term reactions to diffi</p>
<p>cult circumstances, we would</p>
<p>expect to fi nd fewer births recorded in years with high rice prices. Admittedly, local rice prices are a problematic measure for the economic situation of individual families for a variety of reasons, but we would nonetheless expect that life was, on average, harder when rice was dear.37</p>
<p>Previous research has failed to detect a large infl uence of rice prices on the number of births. Griffi</p>
<p>th Feeney and Hamano Kiyoshi estimated crude birth rates for 1807 and 1886 from prefectural age structures for 1886 and assigned them to thirteen rice markets. Th</p>
<p>ey then detrended both birth rates and rice prices and</p>
<p>removed outliers. While they failed to detect statistically signifi cant correlations between the rice price and births in the same year, in twelve of their regions such a correlation was highly signifi cant for births in the following year. Th e eff ect was,</p>
<p>however, quite small. A rise of 10 percent in rice prices was associated with a fall of just 1.2 percent in the birth rate of the following year. Th e eff ect was no stronger in</p>
<p>areas where infanticide was still common in the nineteenth century than in areas where it was probably rarer. In their judicious evaluation of the evidence, Feeney and Hamano allowed for the possibility that they were actually observing fl uctuations in natural infant mortality, which they were unable to take into account in their reverse-survival technique.38</p>
<p>In an event-history analysis of two Nihonmatsu villages, Noriko Tsuya and Satomi Kurosu investigated the same issue with longitudinal data of high quality.</p>
<p>Th</p>
<p>ey failed to detect statistically signifi cant eff ects of the rice price lagged by one year on the probability of recording a birth, even when the analysis was stratifi ed by landholdings.39</p>
<p>A regression of fertility rates in the Ten Provinces dataset against rice prices in the nearest markets does nothing to support the notion that recorded births in Eastern Japan responded strongly to short-term economic fl uctuations. Only in Sendai could detrended rice prices account for even 7 percent of the variation in fertility, but this result is driven by the famine years of 1784, 1834, and 1837.</p>
<p>Without them, the signifi cance disappears. In the other six markets, the correlation between detrended rice prices failed to reach statistical signifi cance even when famine years were included.40</p>
<p>It is likely that the main infl uence of poverty on infanticide was mediated through an attitude of careful planning that aspired to the best living standard possible for a small family within its given material constraints. Families anticipated periods of diffi</p>
<p>cult dependency ratios, and they worried how their progeny</p>
<p>17/04/13 3:54 PM</p>
<p>80 The Culture of Low Fertility</p>
<p>would fare during the next lean season, even when it was not imminent. Th at is the</p>
<p>role that Ashi Tōzan, a scholar banished to rural Sendai, thought poverty played for his neighbors: “Th</p>
<p>ey say that it is better to live well themselves rather than to affl ict</p>
<p>several children with hunger and cold, and will raise no more than two or three.”41</p>

<p>Th</p>
<p>e economic successes of Eastern Japan were just as dangerous to newborn children as were its failures. By the eighteenth century, the region was humming with cottage industries and cash-crop farming. While all this activity created more interesting material lives, it also greatly increased workloads, especially for women.</p>
<p>Farmers who grew only a few major crops would be extremely busy in some seasons, but they also experienced long periods of downtime. Cash crops and cottage industries fi lled these gaps with gainful work. Farmers chose combinations of crops whose planting and harvest seasons did not overlap, with the result that instead of having two or three periods of intense labor, they worked at capacity for a good part of the year.42 Cottage industries such as weaving, sericulture, and papermaking, which were mostly independent of the season, eliminated the remaining interstices of relative leisure. As a result, fi nding the time to raise a child became a challenge.</p>
<p>Th</p>
<p>e gradual growth of cash crops and cottage industries accelerated in the late seventeenth century, the same years in which Eastern Japan’s century of below-replacement fertility began. By 1720, Eastern Japan produced a diverse range of commodities and boasted a number of local manufacturing centers. Mōka cotton was famous throughout Japan, and Kōzuke and Shindatsu were two of the main suppliers of Kyoto’s silk weavers. Th</p>
<p>e towns of Ashikaga and Kiryū had emerged as im-</p>
<p>portant textile producers in their own right. In northern Hitachi and northern Shimotsuke, even small villages oft en had a dozen fulltime papermakers. Hitachi’s tobacco was known throughout Japan. Dozens of furnaces smelted copper in Ashio, and in Shimōsa, local soy sauce and sake brewers were making inroads into an Edo market still dominated by Osaka suppliers. A single district in Dewa accounted for 40 percent of Japan’s production of saffl</p>
<p>ower, a valuable dye, and</p>
<p>growers in nearby Sendai, Fukushima, and Miharu supplied another 40 percent.</p>
<p>On the main trade route to Kyoto, annual exports exceeded a thousand horseloads in good years. Th</p>
<p>ere were four lacquer trees for every inhabitant in Yonezawa and nearly ten in Aizu. Aizu craft smen invented a new type of lacquerware, which expanded the design possibilities from vermillion and black to yellow and blue; the success of these products was such that Aizu soon needed to import 2,500 gold ryō</p>
<p>worth of raw lacquer per year. While economic historians have tended to focus on inedible products in their analyses, commercial development was not necessarily</p>
<p>17/04/13 3:54 PM</p>
<p>The Material and Moral Economy 81</p>
<p>slower in regions that specialized in food crops. Rice was the leading cash crop in Sendai and Shōnai, and enabled the two domains to supply a disproportionate share of the rice markets of Edo and Osaka. Eastern Japan, in short, was integrated into a fl ourishing commercial economy by the early eighteenth century.43</p>
<p>Th</p>
<p>e expansion of commercial production greatly increased the demand for women’s labor. While cash crops diminished the leisure of both sexes, cottage industries such as sericulture and weaving oft en relied disproportionately on women’s work.44 Th</p>
<p>ere are also reports that women’s work expanded into tradi-tionally male domains in the course of the eighteenth century.45 A number of modern historians have credited the increasing value of female labor with saving the lives of baby girls in the nineteenth century, and sex ratios did equilibrate gradually aft er the mid-eighteenth century.46 Many Edo-period analysts of infanticide, however, implied that commerce actually led to more infanticides, observing that many couples were unwilling to divert labor, especially the mother’s, from production to childrearing.47 Th</p>
<p>e confl ict may have been compounded by the popularity</p>
<p>of *taikyō, * or “fetal education.”48 A notion with a long history in China, taikyō</p>
<p>proceeded from the assumption that the mother’s state of mind infl uenced the welfare of the child growing in her womb. It therefore instructed women to calm their emotions, watch their words and diet, and even avoid sights and sounds that might impair the child’s development. Even in the twentieth century, many village wives worked until the day of parturition, oft en to the dismay of public health activists.49 While taikyō was not entirely incompatible with the chores of farm life, the fact that many village wives had no respite from their onerous duties during pregnancy suggests that the full-blown practice of fetal education may have been a privilege of families who could occasionally forgo the labor of their womenfolk.</p>
<p>Although it lies beyond the purview of this book to judge the extent to which taikyō was an elite preoccupation, given that many other aspects of Eastern Japan’s reproductive culture were shared across lines of class and status, it is plausible that the tenets of fetal education infl uenced even those who could not aff ord to live by them. Sustained attention and aff ection were necessary to raise a child; if such attention was supposed to begin months before its birth, it gave the poor an additional reason not to bring up more than the few children for whom they could af-ford to invest such time and care.</p>
<p>Infanticide countermeasures oft en proceeded from the assumption that a good part of the cost of bearing and raising a child consisted in diminishing the mother’s ability to work. Some regimes, such as Aizu, also exempted pregnant women and their husbands from the corvée for six months.50 Th ose that granted</p>
<p>childrearing subsidies typically did so only for the fi rst two or three years of the child’s life, and very few domains paid for children old enough to walk.51 In its fi rst two or three years, the child would be the greatest hindrance to a woman’s ability to work, strapped to her back and demanding access to her nipples at</p>

<p>frequent intervals while she hoed the fi elds or worked the loom.52 One of the more imaginative moral suasion texts therefore addressed the confl ict between work and childrearing by instructing readers how to build a range of baskets and cradles that would free the woman from the child’s weight.53 Th</p>
<p>e contraption illustrated in</p>
<p>Plate 1 even promised that mothers could play with their child while spinning thread.</p>
<p>Other opponents of infanticide looked to institutions rather than technology.</p>
<p>Th</p>
<p>e roving policy consultant Satō Nobuhiro proposed that daycare centers be established to allow reproduction and production to fl ourish at the same time.</p>
<p>Parents would deposit their children in the morning, go to their fi elds and workshops, and pick up the little ones aft er a day of undistracted work. His scheme also called for schools, relief stations for the poor ( <em>kōsaikan</em>), hospitals ( <em>ryōbyōkan</em>), and nurseries for the children of the poor ( <em>jiikukan</em>). Just how much weight he gave to his kindergartens ( <em>yūjishō</em>) * * is evident from the fact that he proposed twenty for each rural sector with ten thousand koku of agricultural output, while one to three of each of the other institutions struck him as suffi cient.54</p>

<p>In many societies, the value of children as producers made them worthwhile investments even if they initially diminished the mother’s ability to work.55 In Eastern Japan’s stem families, capturing the value of an adult child’s labor required extra ingenuity, since typically only the heir remained in the household. In the late seventeenth century, parents frequently solved this problem by indenturing their second and third sons or daughters, whose contracts routinely spanned ten years and sometimes exceeded twenty. In the early eighteenth century, however, long indentures became a rarity. In one sample of eight Kantō villages, the length of labor contracts declined from 6.8 years in 1651–1675 to 2.2 years in the early eighteenth century and 1.1 year in the early nineteenth century.56</p>
<p>Th</p>
<p>e trend toward shorter contracts deserves it own in-depth study, but one possible explanation lies in the changing bargaining positions of employers, employees, and their parents. In an innovative argument, Mark Ramseyer has suggested that absconding became easier with the growth of a commercial economy, so that employers would be less willing to pay in advance for a long indenture contract that was diffi</p>
<p>cult to enforce.57 Alternatively or in addition, the general labor shortage in Eastern Japan, exacerbated by the onset of low fertility, may have strengthened the bargaining power of young farmhands vis-à-vis both their employers and their parents. Both hypotheses need more empirical research, but there is little doubt that by the eighteenth century, few parents could expect to recoup the cost of raising a second or third son by indenturing him as an adult.</p>

<p>84 The Culture of Low Fertility</p>
<p>It is possible that parents relinquished control of their children’s labor volun-tarily. Th</p>
<p>roughout the Edo period, parents relied on their heirs for support during their old age, an expectation that was sometimes formalized in a retirement contract between the former household head and his successor.58 While such arrangements were mutually benefi cial, it is less clear whether parents felt that non-inheriting off spring owed them their labor as adults in exchange for the care they had received as children. Aff ectionate parenting, aft er all, was an important part of the culture of infanticide, which contemporary observers sometimes contrasted with the heartlessness of people who bore children only to sell them into servitude later.59</p>
<p>Th</p>
<p>at parents could not or would not control the labor of children other than their successor is also evident from the fact that they did not raise their own help-mates in response to the rising cost of hired hands. In a 1742 petition to their new lord, the headmen of Shirakawa explained rampant infanticide in their area with</p>
<p>“daughters being of no particular use,” by which they presumably meant that somebody else would enjoy the fruits of their labor.60 At the very same time, Eastern Japan rang with complaints about how expensive hired help had become.61</p>
<p>While the number of laborers declined, the development of various cottage industries created a high demand for them. Sericulture in particular required prodigious inputs of typically female labor.</p>
<p>Several scholars have argued that the spread of sericulture therefore increased the economic value of children, especially daughters.62 Th e geographical evidence</p>
<p>for this hypothesis is not strong, however. Th</p>
<p>e sericulture districts of the eigh-</p>
<p>teenth century shared the same low fertility rates of other parts of Eastern Japan where silk was not a major product. Th</p>
<p>e silk boom of the late 1850s and 1860s</p>
<p>coincided with an age of high fertility, but fertility rose ahead of the boom and increased just as much in many areas that were not notable for silk production.</p>
<p>Th</p>
<p>ere was almost no correlation between silk output per capita on the one hand, for which the fi rst district-level data were published in 1876, and recorded fertility on the other in either the eighteenth or the nineteenth century.63 Th e correlations</p>
<p>are no better for comparisons of fertility with all cash crops or all agricultural output per capita.64 A growing demand for labor, it seems, did not prompt people to raise more children.</p>

<p>While children were doubtful productive assets, they could absorb prodigious resources in the vibrant commercial economy of the eighteenth century. Before the rise of a consumer society, even the most doting parents could only spend so much on a single child. With growing expectations for material comfort and</p>
<p>17/04/13 3:54 PM</p>
<p>The Material and Moral Economy 85</p>
<p>education, however, rearing a child in an appropriate manner and guaranteeing an adequate future for him became much more expensive.65</p>
<p>As an item of consumption, children had to compete with many other worthwhile things that parents could do with their money. It was such “extravagance”</p>
<p>that bans and moral suasion texts frequently identifi ed as the root cause of infanticide. Th</p>
<p>is causal explanation may have been a foregone conclusion, given that the purpose of such texts was to change people’s minds about infanticide rather than to commiserate with their plight. At the same time, such exhortations cannot have been very eff ective if they ignored the basic reality of the society they sought to change.</p>
<p>Anti-infanticide images rarely showed obviously poor women killing their newborns.66 Typically, the women and their families are properly dressed; most wear multilayered kimonos of bright colors and beautiful patterns (Plate 2). Where the residential context is shown, it suggests a life of relative comfort. Folding screens separate the birthing space; several of these are elaborately painted, and one, while worn, has a sheet of practice calligraphy glued on, as if to suggest that this is a family that gives their children a solid education.67 Th</p>
<p>ose images that detail the fl ooring</p>
<p>oft en show tatami mats or burnished wooden boards, which were signs of wealth and status.68 Many of the women recline on piles of futons and richly patterned bedding, at a time when it was common to sleep on the fl oor warmed only by one’s daytime clothes.69 Th</p>
<p>ey own teapots, lamps, and decorative furniture, and their husbands or mothers-in-law smoke tobacco pipes.70 A few images even show looking glasses as part of the room décor.71 While their main function is to reveal in their refl ection the demonic nature of the murderous mother, the mirrors, like all the other accoutrements of comfort, must have been placed in the woman’s quarters with some level of plausibility. Th</p>
<p>e message was clear: infanticide was not the</p>
<p>desperate resort of the poor, but the depraved choice of the affl uent.</p>
<p>Th</p>
<p>e same men who banned infanticide were oft en deeply troubled by what they considered frivolous consumerism. In 1789, at the end of a bad decade, Yonezawa issued a ban on infanticide as well as a document that urged villagers to reform their luxurious ways. Th</p>
<p>ey should “wrap themselves in patched clothes, bind their hair with straw, wear straw raincoats, don bamboo hats, stick a sickle into their belt, and carry a hoe.”72 Infanticide and extravagant clothes were peeves in a seventeen-point program that the shogunal intendant Teranishi Jūjirō drew up to</p>
<p>“reform popular customs.” Along with infanticide, Teranishi banned luxury in rituals, plays, sumo wrestling, the sale of sake, gambling, days of rest, mercantile enterprise, and large gatherings for celebrations or funerals. Even pilgrimages, a popular excuse for travel of any sort, would henceforth require a permit.73 It is safe to assume that such laws were mostly honored in the breach.</p>
<p>How much did it cost to raise a child? In 1824, the mathematician Takahashi Yasunaga showed off his skill by calculating a comprehensive fi gure.74 He</p>

<p>The Material and Moral Economy 87</p>
<p>published his fi ndings in a book that also computed the number of rice grains a person eats in sixty years (700,131,600). Takahashi began by enumerating seven categories of birth-related expenses, including special birthing clothes, the midwife’s fee, the fi rst visit to the shrine, and the celebrations on the child’s seventh night. Such one-off expenses came to a total of 1 ryō. Th e cost of basic food and</p>
<p>clothes for the child would be 1.25 ryō per year in the fi rst fi ve years, and 1.5 ryō a year between the ages of six and fi ft een. If the mother did not have enough milk, the wet nurse would charge 3.375 ryō annually. Th</p>
<p>is calculation, Takahashi stressed,</p>
<p>assumed an impoverished lifestyle. For example, he left out the cost of ceremonies that all but the poorest performed at shrines for children aged three, fi ve, and seven. People of comfortable budgets ( <em>kattemuki sōō no mono</em>), Takahashi estimated, would spend 10 ryō a year on each child. For each scenario, Takahashi also calculated the compound interest of these expenses, so that the cumulative cost of raising a single child in comfortable circumstances amounted to 1,000 ryō.</p>
<p>Th</p>
<p>at was an exorbitant sum at a time when laborers could hope to earn between 3 and 5 ryō a year and the offi</p>
<p>cial tax revenue of the shogunate stood at a little over a million ryō. For our purposes, the exuberant fi gure of 1,000 ryō is most interesting in that it derives from the assumption that capital spent on children could instead earn very high interest rates. For Takahashi, it also made possible a high-minded conclusion to his calculation, for he stressed that his results should remind people of the abject fi lial gratitude they owed their parents. Probably inadvertently, he also gave the reader an argument for not raising too many children. Th</p>
<p>e affl</p>
<p>uent, Takahashi implied, would fi nd childrearing a major drain on their resources. For the poor, he stated outright, it was diffi cult to meet even the</p>
<p>minimum expenses of raising a child.</p>
<p>Takahashi’s observation that bringing up children in style was expensive resonates with any number of sources from the villages of Edo-period Japan. In a study of the lives of several elite village families, Anne Walthall found that one house celebrated the birth of a daughter with a banquet for 120 people, and another sent trays of sake and fi ne food to everyone in the neighborhood on the occasion of their daughter’s birth, and red beans and rice when she turned one month old.75</p>
<p>Such obligations could motivate infanticides. In the words of one nineteenth-century analysis, “When a man with a stable livelihood raises a child, and be it a lastborn child, he will become known as a miser if he does not follow the way of the world and spread a suitable banquet to feast his guests. Th ere are people who are</p>
<p>unable to raise children since they are unequal to such expenses and fear the scorn of the public.”76 A major reason that children were so expensive, then, was that childrearing became a stage for performing each family’s status in village society.</p>
<p>Th</p>
<p>is culture could be particularly hard on families of limited means. One nineteenth-century childrearing commissioner of Sendai described the pressure that the largesse of doting parents put on those who could ill aff ord it:</p>
<p>17/04/13 3:54 PM</p>
<p>88 The Culture of Low Fertility</p>
<p>When I toured the villages and interviewed poor families, they told me that because childrearing had become extravagant in recent years, they were at a loss. Seeing the neighbors’ children outdoing each other with their pretty colors at festivals and other celebrations, their own children … would bawl, “So-and-so is wearing a red dress. I want to wear one, too!” Th</p>
<p>e grandfathers and grandmothers would shed tears</p>
<p>together, and looking at the pregnancy of their daughter or daughter-in-law would be unable to bear that thought, and in spite of themselves, matters would reach the point where they were roused to return ( <em>oshikaeshi</em>) [the unborn child]. It is in this way that good people kill babies.77</p>
<p>Th</p>
<p>is social context of childrearing had other implications. One was that among the wealthy, friends, relatives, business partners, and neighbors were expected to give substantial presents at the celebrations that marked the milestones of a child’s life. For example, when Funatsu Denjibei, a noted educator in the mountains of Kōzuke, celebrated the birth of his fi rst granddaughter, twenty-one relatives and friends from seven villages gave gift s that included 2,200 copper coins, three small gold coins, ten sets of baby clothes in plain silk, red silk, pink, vermillion, and other fabrics, fi ve foot of cloth, dried bonito, a sack and three chests of rice, a bundle of paper, and ten fans.78 When in the same family a four-year-old girl fell ill, nine related families (seven on the father’s side, two on the mother’s) showered her with sweets and fruit. When she died in spite of their good wishes, seventeen households from within the village and six—probably relatives—from without brought incense, quantities of tea, konnyaku, sōmen noodles, fl our, and soymilk and enough coin to pay for her posthumous rites.79 Th</p>
<p>e reason we know about such</p>
<p>gift s in great detail is that many people recorded them in special ledgers, so that they could calibrate their own presents appropriately when the occasion arose.</p>
<p>Having a child not only created an obligation to reciprocate gift s; it also imposed considerable burdens on one’s relatives and neighbors, whose good opinion could therefore argue against raising an additional child. Th is would have been</p>
<p>especially true if one already had the largest brood among one’s relations. Even if the fl ow of gift s was balanced, such exchanges diverted resources from essentials to luxury items—sweets, fans, expensive clothes, prestigious posthumous names.</p>
<p>Th</p>
<p>e culture of gift -giving therefore contributed to making childrearing itself a luxury.</p>
<p>Peer pressure took more direct forms as well. Numerous children were widely considered an economic burden and oft en seen as the cause of poverty.80 Th roughout Japan’s infanticidal lands, we therefore read of villagers ridiculing people with many children “for not knowing their proper station” and calling them fools ( *“Baka-mono ja!” *).81 Many seem to have internalized the ridicule and well-intentioned advice as shame about not being able to raise children in correct style.82</p>
<p>Not all social pressure was motivated by a concern over the welfare of a neighbor’s children. Th</p>
<p>e poor expected the support of their richer neighbors in times of</p>
<p>17/04/13 3:54 PM</p>
<p>The Material and Moral Economy 89</p>
<p>need. In petitions to their lords, middling villagers throughout Japan insisted on their entitlement to “continue as a full-status farmer”;83 that this attitude was widely shared implies that when their status became precarious, they also had a claim to the support of their peers and betters in the village. Th is web of entitlements meant that reproductive choices had real eff ects on neighbors. Th ese were</p>
<p>further enlarged by the tax system of Tokugawa Japan. Th e burdensome rice tribute was collected by village, not by household. If one household defaulted on its tax obligation, the rest of the village had to make up for the shortfall. If a household appeared to drive itself into poverty by raising more children than it could aff ord, therefore, the rest of the village considered it its business to do something about this recklessness.</p>
<p>N U M E R AC Y, P L A N N I N G , A N D A F E RT I L I T Y N O R M</p>
<p>Th</p>
<p>at diff erent material contexts could motivate infanticide reveals a mental framework that treated the life or death of a newborn child as an economic decision.</p>
<p>Th</p>
<p>is, in turn, has a number of implications for the mentality of infanticidal parents. First, they set themselves apart from many other reproductive cultures by treating the number of children as a matter of counting, planning, and choice. Th e</p>
<p>great historical demographer Etienne van de Walle has shown that in many premodern and at least some contemporary societies, parents do not possess what he calls “numeracy about children.” In surveys of the 1960s and 1980s that asked respondents in several West African countries how many children they wanted or considered a good number to have, up to half of respondents gave nonnumeric answers such as “don’t know” or “as many as God will send.” In Western Europe, too, van de Walle argues, numeracy about children only became widespread on the eve of the modern fertility transition, and vestiges of innumeracy persisted into the twentieth century.84</p>
<p>In the reproductive culture that this book describes, infanticidal parents were not only numerate about their own children; they also participated in a public conversation that circulated and reinforced a fertility norm that they expressed as a number. In the words of the Mito scholar Nagakubo Sekisui, it had “become the equivalent of a law that people raise two or three children and thin out any others without fail.”85 Th</p>
<p>e claim that people had a set number of children in mind recurs in many analyses of infanticide. Th</p>
<p>at number was “one or two,” according to some,</p>
<p>“two or three” according to others.86 A few authors reported the fertility norm as</p>
<p>“three or four children.”87 Th</p>
<p>is level of divergence need not trouble us. Th</p>
<p>e observ-</p>
<p>ers wrote in diff erent years and places, and some may have counted the number of children spared from infanticide, others the number that actually lived to grow up.</p>
<p>In an age when for every fi ve chosen children, only three reached adulthood, such semantics mattered.</p>
<p>17/04/13 3:54 PM</p>
<p>90 The Culture of Low Fertility</p>
<p>Another indication that a fertility norm governed the culture of infanticide is that some contemporaries thought that it had spread from one economic group to the rest of society. Th</p>
<p>ey did not agree on whether the norm originated with the rich or the poor. Some thought that infanticide was originally a response to poverty, but that “imitating this evil custom, rich commoners, too, have come to prefer the ease of raising few children to the labors of raising many.”88 Another theory explained infanticide by the general emulation of the clothes, food, and toys of the rich.89</p>
<p>Couples who used infanticide as a family planning tool decided the fate of each newborn child in a context of multiple trade-off s. Endowed with a keen sense of opportunity cost that treated time itself as a valuable commodity, they conceptual-ized childrearing in terms of foregone consumption and lost production, and therefore as a potential threat to their social status and livelihood. Th ey also saw</p>
<p>themselves as trading quantity for quality in off spring, believing that killing one child benefi ted another. By framing these decisions in the language of rationality and responsibility, they affi</p>
<p>rmed a fertility norm that obliged parents to raise their children in a manner appropriate to their standing. What passed as an appropriate lifestyle depended on what a family could aff ord to do for one or two children if it was poor, or for two or three children if it was rich. A poor man might get away with dressing his children in patched clothes, as long as they did not go hungry. A rich man would invite the ridicule of his neighbors if he failed to celebrate the milestones of his children’s life with pomp, circumstance, and presents for all. Th is</p>
<p>social context of the economic decisions means that whether to raise or kill a child was not just a matter of material conditions, but the outcome of a moral economy.</p>
