In 1794, Hara Nan’yō, personal physician to the lord of Mito, sent his newest book manuscript to Fujita Yūkoku. Fujita was young enough to be Hara’s child, but his actual parentage was far less illustrious. Th

e second son of a used-clothes seller in 

Mito’s castletown, he had shown such prodigious promise as a scholar that at the age of eighteen he was raised to the rank of a warrior and made an editor on Mito’s Dai-Nipponshi historiographical project. Hara hoped that Fujita would write a foreword to his *Bokuyokuhen, * a learned treatise on infanticide. Fujita obliged him, but in a way that must have shocked the good doctor. His “Indeed, his foreword” 

was so caustic that Hara never published the book. “Th

e general meaning of this 

booklet is to deplore that infants are not raised. However, its content is entirely about the alien land \( *ihō*\) of China,” Fujita grumbled. Apparently, Hara had written a history of population policy in the chronicles of Chinese statecraft , from the kings of Zhou and Goujian of Yue to the emperors of the Southern Song dynasty. “It then goes on to deplore the moral decay of more recent times. If one lets somebody with just a little learning read this, . . . he will certainly say: ‘In the land of civilization to our west, \[such sagely policies\] still exist. Only in our Divine Land are they not implemented.’ It is like making a monkey climb up a tree, no diff erent from smearing dirt on dirt.”1

Unfl attering comparisons of Japan with China had a long history among Edo-period intellectuals. Earlier in the eighteenth century, several authors writing on infanticide had taken the same approach for which Fujita savaged Hara. Yusa Bokusai’s treatise on raising twins was in the main a recitation of admirable 194

Chinese precedent.2 Another scholar, Nishikawa Joken, asserted Japan’s equality with its larger neighbor, but elsewhere extolled the same bounties for twin births and held up China as an example more generally for its successful infanticide countermeasures. “In China, too, \[infanticide\] was frequent in antiquity, but successive generations of sagely emperors issued bans and made rural scholars teach the people that this practice contradicts human ethics. Th anks to these eff orts, 

in the present period there is nobody \[in China\] who commits this evil deed.”3

Many authors of anti-infanticide pamphlets simply saw themselves as a part of the larger traditions of China, India, and Japan. Gen Senshi \(1791\) and Sekiguchi Toyotane \(1822\) could still cite these three countries in a single sentence and without implied contrast, giving them equal weight and honor as the respective homelands of the Sages, the Buddha, and the \(Shinto\) Gods.4 In the mid–nineteenth century, however, Nativism elevated Shinto over the other two teachings and sometimes associated infanticide with Chinese infl uences. In 1849, Suzuki Shigetane, the Shinto enthusiast who a few pages ago worried about the military implications of depopulation, echoed the sentiments of his fellow Nativists when he wrote: “It used to be said that burying one’s child out of poverty is a vile custom frequent only among the Chinese, but at some point this evil has moved hither \[to Japan\], and now very occasionally happens among the poor in remote regions.”5 

As Japanese intellectuals labored to recenter the map of civilization on Japan, infanticide was a problem that required explanation. 

Civilization was a fi ckle ground on which to attack infanticide. It could be a highly eff ective argument among people who felt insecure about the status of their region within Japan or of Japan’s status within a wider world; among people confi dent or defensive about the civilized status of their land, or people tired of measuring themselves against some foreign benchmark, appeals to civilization could have the opposite eff ect. In such a setting, proposing infanticide countermeasures could be politically diffi

cult because doing so impugned the civilized 

status of the target region. For a brief historical moment, from about 1868 to 1878, people were open to the idea that their native land was in sore need of civilizing, and in the fi rst years of the Meiji period, infanticide was routinely censured in those terms. Aft er that moment passed, however, it became increasingly disagreeable to point fi ngers. Just as Fujita’s outburst persuaded Hara Nan’yō not to publish his book, a nation that thought itself civilized seems to have found it diffi cult to 

pay attention to the persistence of infanticide.

Long before the 1870s, Japan had a tradition of associating infanticide with peripheries, barbarism, and the past. As early as 1675, Manabe Gen’itsu’s description of infanticide in northern Kyushu, one of the fi rst examples of a Japanese intellectual  

17/04/13 3:54 PM

writing about this topic, began with the words “in that distant land.”6 Half a century later, Nishikawa Joken located the custom among “locals of mountain huts.”7 

When pamphlets against infanticide came to be printed in quantity, they eagerly took up this theme. Most versions of the most frequently reprinted text in this genre, the *Manual for a Prospering Posterity *\( *Shison hanjō tebikigusa*\), opened with the words “in the countryside” or “dwelling in deep mountains,” and many prefaced their title with *Hendo minkan, * or “among the people in the periphery.” 

Ishida Ryūgen embedded the same point in his contrasting tales of virtue and vice, settling his infanticidal clan of swine brothers in “a remote mountain region” while domiciling his paragons of virtue in a village near Kyoto.8

Th

is spatial interpretation of infanticide, while far from accurate, was in harmony with the long East Asian tradition of defi ning civilization \( *ka*\) and barbarism \( *i*\) in geographic terms.9 In this worldview, cores of civilization were surrounded by barbarous peripheries.10 Barbarians could civilize themselves, but civilization was in principle static, not a moving target. Europeans similarly divided the world into civilized and savage, but overlaid this spatial order with temporal meaning. Th e 

backward parts of the world preserved the various past stages of the advanced societies, which were in turn the future of the backward lands.11 Th e idea of convergent progress, eagerly taken up by the Japanese enthusiasts of “Civilization and Enlightenment” in the early 1870s, hinged on the adoption of this Western reading of space as time. 

Even before this Western infl uence, Edo-period infanticide discourses confl ated space and time. Tokugawa critiques occasionally described infanticide as an anachronism left over from the brutal chaos of the Warring States period \(1467–1573\) and implied that it had no place under the peaceful reign of the Tokugawa shoguns. Time fl owed into space with the claim that the legacy of the Warring States was particularly strong in the local character of the infanticidal peripheries.12 Others sought the roots of infanticide in a still more distant past. 

Before the ninth century, the peoples of northern Honshu and southern Kyushu defi ed the ambitions of the imperial government in Nara and then Kyoto. Th e 

imperial court responded by applying to them the Chinese concept of barbarians. 

Th

e ultimate conquest and submission of these peoples did not extinguish their distinct culture. Certain aspects, such as the curved blades and mounted archery of the Emishi in northern Honshu that became the template for samurai warfare, entered the Japanese mainstream. Other traditions lingered on locally, as did a vague memory in the more central parts of Japan that the edges of the archipelago were culturally and perhaps even ethnically distinct. 

When infanticide in the peripheries emerged as a topic of conversation, writers were quick to make the link between baby-killing and ancient barbarians. As early as 1701, Seki Sokō’s version of the *Jinkokuki, * a * * survey of Japan’s provinces and the character of their people, * * reported that “until recently” the inhabitants of Mutsu

killed all children from the third without any bad conscience, “in the manner of barbarians” \( *iteki*\). In a signifi cant juxtaposition, the preceding sentence related that Mutsu was originally the land of the Emishi but that its inhabitants had been gradually civilized under imperial rule.13 Coloring in a diff erent corner of the map, Nakai Chikuzan, the principal of a merchant academy in Osaka, linked infanticide in Kyushu with “the three Miao tribes,” barbarians of ancient China.14 Nakai presumably meant to imply that infanticide was a legacy of the Hayato barbarians of southern Kyushu, who submitted to the Nara court only in the eighth century. By the 1790s, the view that infanticide was a legacy of ancient barbarians existed outside the studies of learned men in Japan’s core provinces. For example, Heijūrō, a native of Echigo who was involved in organizing the migration of his countrymen into the Kantō, noted thoughtfully that the people of the East were the descendants of the ancient “Eastern Barbarians.”15 Even in the Northeast itself, some opponents of infanticide adopted this unfl attering view of their countrymen.16

Th

e question of civilization acquired a new salience in the years around the Meiji Restoration of 1868, a historical moment that combined a classicist idealization of the distant past with a forward-looking program of reform.17 At a time when Japan was gripped by a potent mixture of assertiveness and insecurity about its status as a land of civilization, areas in which a barbarous past lingered were liabilities for the entire nation. In the early 1870s, the geographical fringes of the emerging Japanese nation-state were generally seen as places where the past refused to melt away, especially in respect to customs relating to sex and reproduction. Th e historian Gregory Pfl ugfelder argues that in the Meiji period the popular discourse of male-male sexuality located this practice at the southwestern and northeastern margins of Japan as if to document the uncivilized nature of male-male erotic practice.18 Roughly the same regions received renewed attention as swamps of infanticide and abortion. 

Even the residents of areas in which abortion or infanticide were frequent participated in this discourse, describing their homeland as a periphery in sore need of more civilization. Th

is constituted no break with the previous decades, when 

authors of anti-infanticide pamphlets routinely described their home regions as remote and marginal. In the early Meiji period, however, these mental geographies took on a new urgency. 

In May 1873, all inhabitants of the village of Hanawa signed a petition to their prefecture of Iwasaki \(the coastal part of present Fukushima\) begging the government for a ban on abortion and gambling.19 Concern about postconception birth control was not new to Hanawa, which eighty years earlier had been the residence

of Teranishi Jūjirō, a shogunal intendant famous for his anti-infanticide eff orts. 

Some of Teranishi’s language even appeared in the 1873 petition. But the petition also shared in the discourse of the new age, calling abortion an evil custom \( *rōshū*\) of the backwoods \( *hendo*\). *Akushū, heishū, akufū * were all more common terms in Edo-period condemnations of infanticide as an “evil custom.” *Rōshū, * however, * * was part of the most succinct mission statement of the Meiji government, the Charter Oath of 1868, which was displayed on wooden boards in villages throughout Japan.20 Its fourth item read, “To obliterate the *rōshū * of the past and base \[our customs\] on the internationally recognized natural order.”21 Th e villagers very 

likely used *rōshū * deliberately for its association with the Meiji project;22 they also had a clear vision for the “future state,” whose “prosperity and greatness” would be ensured by the “multiplication of descendants.”23

In the same spirit, the twenty-year-old son of a Jōdoshinshū Buddhist priest called his own home an unsophisticated periphery \( *hendo hekisū*\) when he petitioned his prefecture for a ban on abortion in 1875.24 Th at prefecture was not 

some remote mountain redoubt peopled by hirsute speakers of an impenetrable dialect. Th

e young man wrote his petition from Ōtamachi, a village at the center of Ibaraki, in the broad plains of the Kantō and a day’s ride from the new seat of the imperial government. In another sentence, he referred to abortion as an “ancient abuse” \( *kyūheki*\). How, he asked in rhetorical exasperation, could it be allowed to continue in “this day of civilization”? Both the villagers of Hanawa and the priest’s son had imbibed the idea that civilization manifested itself in both time and space; for them, the persistence of abortion marked a region as a backward periphery where the evils of the past persisted. 

Th

at the two petitions took up abortion rather than infanticide is in itself signifi cant. Sex ratios of live births still bore clear traces of infanticide in the 1870s. 

When in the 1880s stillbirth statistics were fi rst compiled, they reported so many stillborn girls relative to boys to leave no doubt that unwanted children were still done away with *aft er* their birth in the tens of thousands. Th ese are fi gures for 

regions larger than single villages. It is just possible that in Hanawa and Ōtamachi, abortion had come to replace infanticide entirely in the early 1870s. Perhaps, however, the petitioners could not bring themselves to admit that a custom as savage as infanticide still persisted, and instead coyly included postpartum deaths in the term *datai* \(abortion\). Abortion was not compatible with the age of Civilization and Enlightenment. Th

ey may have felt that the admission that infanticide persisted, with all its implications of backward savagery, would be a far greater stain on the reputation of their home region. 

Around the time these petitions were fi led, offi

cial bans on infanticide and 

abortion routinely used phrases like “as we advance toward civilization.”25 Such bans were issued in prodigious numbers in the fi rst seven years of the Meiji

regime. Even before the last partisans of the shogunate surrendered in 1869, the new government issued an edict prohibiting midwives from performing abortions.26 Yet the main attack on infanticide and abortion came not from the center, but from the governors of the new prefectures, which replaced the old domains in several steps.27 While the old domain lords had typically ruled territories they inherited from a long line of ancestors, the new governors served appointments that rarely lasted longer than a few years, and then moved on to their next position, oft en in a distant part of the country. Especially in Eastern Japan, the priorities of the fi rst generation of these men frequently included the fi ght against infanticide. 

Between 1868 and 1874, incoming prefectural governors and a few transitional domain administrators announced more than two dozen bans on abortion, infanticide, or child abandonment \(see Map 12\).28 Th

e twenty authors of bans who 

assumed posts in eastern Honshu all came from Western and Central Japan. Many domains of Eastern Japan had fought on the shogun’s side in the short civil war of 1868 to 1869, and the new government initially was mostly staff ed by men from Japan’s western half. As they entered the East, the new governors typically lost no time in addressing the barbarous customs of their charges. Th e Kyoto-born court 

noble Shijō Ryūhei, for example, pronounced an infanticide ban in the short-lived Northeastern prefecture of Wakamatsu within days of taking up its governorship in the fall of 1869.29 In nearby Shirakawa, Kiyooka Takatomo, a Tosa man, announced a program to combat infanticide during his fi rst month as governor.30 

Th

e fi rst governor of Aomori, Hishida Ki from Ōgaki in central Japan, was a bit of a laggard by the standards of the day, convening a seven-day infanticide conference of priests and village offi

cials only in his sixth month in offi

ce.31 His successor, 

Hiroshima-born Ikeda Tanenori, made more haste and issued his own ban in the second month of his tenure.32

Th

is urgency probably derived from a mixture of civilizing zeal and preconceptions about savage peripheries. Th

e manner in which new administrators discov-

ered the infanticide problem suggests that their mental landscapes of civilization and savagery were an important factor. In 1870, two offi cials touring the coast of 

the defeated domains of Sendai and Morioka professed themselves shocked at the extent of infanticide. If they themselves stumbled across the bodies of dead infants, they left no record of it. However, they swift ly convened a conference with the governors of the fi ve prefectures in this area, who then promulgated bans that confi dently stated that in Sanriku \(approximately the old domains of Sendai, Morioka, and Hachinohe\) people had been killing their infants since the distant past \( *inishie*\). Moreover, the governors “had heard” that this custom continued even now, with people thinking it neither strange nor unnatural.33

When Shibahara Yawara, former rector of the domain academy of Tatsuno, a small castletown west of Kyoto, was appointed governor of Miyazaku on the Bōsō

peninsula in the fall of 1871, he was—or so he remembered a few years later—

immediately outraged at the rampant evil of infanticide.34 Before he could coordinate appropriate countermeasures, Miyazaku was merged into the larger prefecture of Kisarazu. Shibahara became its fi rst governor and within weeks of taking offi

ce set in motion one of the most ambitious anti-infanticide campaigns of the 1870s. In a memorandum to Tokyo, Shibahara claimed that his sense of urgency was based on “thorough inspection of local customs” \( *dozoku wo jukusatsu*\).35 Extraordinarily low fertility rates that we can reconstruct from population registers for parts of Kisarazu leave little doubt that infanticide was indeed very frequent there around 1870, but it is not the sort of phenomenon a visitor can easily observe, especially if he enters the villages with the pomp and circumstance of a government on a mission. 

To Shibahara, who had spent most of his life not far from Kyoto, Kisarazu must have presented a tantalizing blend of core and periphery. It was part of the East, whose credentials as a civilized region were open to question. On clear winter days, however, the snowy cone of Mt. Fuji, already then a totemic symbol of Japan, would have enchanted the horizon, and keen eyes could espy the new national capital across the Bay of Tokyo. Even within the microcosm of Kisarazu, Shibahara was sensitive to the representative nature of a capital. In August 1874, he issued an exhortation to two villages in the neighborhood of the prefectural seat urging them to refrain from their near-barbarous \( *yaban ni chikaki*\) ways, such as public urination and nakedness.36

At fi rst glance, the early 1870s do look like a new heyday of infanticide countermeasures. Some of the new governors accompanied their bans with imaginative policies for the benefi t of newborn children \(Map 12\).37 Matsukata Masayoshi, a Satsuma samurai and future fi nance minister, became the governor of Hita in northern Kyushu in 1868. During his fi rst year in offi

ce, he raised several thousand 

gold ryō for a foundling home and created a system of rewards for reporting illegitimate pregnancies and adopting foundlings. Unwed mothers were to receive one piece of clothing and a hundred copper coins if they decided to rear their child themselves. In an additional provision that reveals who else was thought to decide the fate of an illegitimate infant, temples were promised one ryō for persuading the parents of an unwed mother to spare the life of their grandchild.38

Another Satsuma samurai with a splendid career ahead of himself, Takasaki Masakaze, issued an infanticide ban when he found himself in charge of the Satsuma district of Tarumizu in 1869. With genius for metaphor, he planted fruit trees, palms, and paulownias for every child, telling parents they could later sell the trees to pay school fees and dowries.39 Th

instead put his faith in the power of poultry farming and cattle breeding; this elaborate plan required every family to start raising chickens and, several logical steps later, would culminate in the eradication of infanticide.40

In the Northeast, seven domains and prefectures announced a compulsory contribution scheme to subsidize the children of the poor. All adults were to be divided into thirds according to wealth and assessed one, two, or three copper coins per day accordingly. Households in the poorest third would receive grants every month until their child reached its third year.41 For the short-lived prefecture of Isawa, a projected budget for this plan survives. It calculated that the fund would have revenues of 5,953 ryō and expenses of 4712.5 ryō per lunar year.42 To set a good example, offi

cials from the four prefectures and two domains pledged a total of 1,648 ryō to the fund from their own salaries. In Tosa, childrearing subsidies were to be fi nanced through nominally voluntary donations; collected over a few months in 1870, they totaled an astonishing 170,000 ryō, or the equivalent of nearly 250 kg of gold.43

Of all the early-Meiji governors, it was Shibahara Yawara who oversaw the most sustained infanticide eradication scheme. In the spring of 1872, Shibahara wrote to the central government that he considered the eradication of infanticide and abortion “the most urgent task number one of the Bōsō prefecture.”44 Aft er he failed to convince the central government to fund such an eff ort, Shibahara turned to his prefecture and issued a call for donations. Th

e resulting endowment would 

fi nance childrearing subsidies for the poor as well as the administrative expenses of pregnancy surveillance. Over the summer and autumn months of 1872, the collection exceeded all expectations as tens of thousands made large contributions.45

A directory of those that donated one yen or more, at the time roughly the price of ten chickens, was printed in newfangled metal type and distributed to the donors. To this day, its bulk is impressive. Five inches thick, its 1,300 pages list the names, home villages, and donations of 29,635 men.46 From local documents, we can infer that smaller donations, which were not listed, were about twice as numerous still.47 Since donors were typically household heads, only a minority of the 110,000 households in this prefecture refused to make a contribution.48 Some apparently tried. But when a fundraising meeting was poorly attended, the volunteers of the government simply called another to give everybody a second chance to make a show of their civic spirit.49

Th

e promised donations in the published list alone totaled nearly 81,000 yen.50 

At about 0.2 yen per inhabitant of Kisarazu, this was a relatively small sum compared to the great expenses of the 1870s, such as the land tax reform and the suppression of the Satsuma Rebellion, each of which cost about 1.2 yen per capita.51 

On the other hand, in early 1872 the Council of State in Tokyo failed to agree on a budget for the creation of a national education system, as some councillors recoiled from the proposed sum of 3 million yen, or less than 0.1 yen per capita.52 

 

17/04/13 3:54 PM

Infanticide and Civilization 203

In 1879, Chiba, the prefecture into which Kisarazu merged in 1873, spent less than 0.5 yen per capita on education, infrastructure, and public health combined.53 Th e 

donations of 1872, given as they were on a nominally voluntary basis, remain a testament to a peculiar historical moment. 

Th

at moment faded quickly, as did all of the more ambitious programs. Matsukata’s initiative recorded all of 366 illegitimate births and supervised the rearing of 308 children in its foundling home. Aft er the abolition of his prefecture of Hita, the surveillance system was dismantled, and the foundling home shut its doors in 1874.54 In Tosa, the huge endowment was invested in various speculative commercial schemes, based on the argument that industrialization and poverty alleviation were the best solution for the infanticide problem.55 When, in 1874, a group of original donors and additional signatories petitioned for the endowment to be used for an actual child welfare program, a good part of the original sum had already evap-orated in failed investments.56 In Tarumizu, Takasaki Masakaze left offi ce aft er two 

years, and there is no evidence that his successors carried on his arboricultural gestures.57 In the Northeast, the seven jurisdictions that had announced the childrearing subsidy contribution scheme did not survive long enough even to begin its implementation. By the end of 1871, they had all been merged out of existence. 

Even on the Bōsō peninsula, the eff ort quickly lost momentum. In February 1873, Shibahara’s portfolio was extended from Kisarazu to the neighboring prefecture of Inba. In June, Kisarazu and most of Inba merged to form the new prefecture of Chiba. Shibahara combined the proceeds of the Kisarazu collection and the childrearing endowment of the former domain of Sakura \(recently part of Inba\) into a fund for all of Chiba, hoping to replicate the success of the Kisarazu collection in his new territories.58 His call was answered by only a handful of donors. 

Refl ecting on the experience in 1875, Shibahara explained this failure with the convenient \(and erroneous\) claim that in Inba, the evil of infanticide had not been nearly as widespread as in Kisarazu.59 In fact, popular support for the childrearing endowment was waning fast. In February 1875, Shibahara found himself compelled to issue an announcement that was really a defense of the program against the criticism that the childrearing system existed in name only and was a mischievous waste of the people’s capital \( *minsan*\).60 He published fi gures that purported to prove that between 1872 and 1873 the number of births \(implicitly excluding the victims of infanticide\) had increased by 58 percent in Kisarazu and 52 percent in Inba.61 In a telling report to the Ministry of the Interior, Shibahara grumbled that many people did not understand that the government intended the good of its subjects.62

A public account from November 1875 reveals how little material aid the endowment actually gave to impecunious parents. In the twelve months of 1874, it stated, subsidies totaled just 368 yen, while administrative expenses ran to 3,054 

yen.63 Th

e latter covered the compilation of pregnancy surveillance reports, which  

17/04/13 3:54 PM

204 Redefining Reproduction

arrived at the prefectural offi

ces collated into several hundred volumes.64 Like the 

endowments of the Edo period, the Kisarazu fund was designed to be put out to interest. While the poor gained little from the childrearing system, it was a boon for rich entrepreneurs, who borrowed sums oft en exceeding 100 yen each.65 

Interest rates were so moderate that a debate in the prefectural assembly concluded that they had to be increased. When the childrearing system was extended to former Inba prefecture, protests from former Kisarazu focused not on the disbursement of childrearing subsidies, but on the unwanted competition of Inba entrepreneurs for loans from the endowment. 

Th

e last pregnancy reports seem to have been fi led in 1880.66 In the same year, Shibahara, one of Japan’s longest-serving prefectural governors, left Chiba for a post in the central government.67 Around the same time, the childrearing endowment was quietly transferred to a newly introduced agricultural distress fund \( *bikō *

*chochiku*\).68 It went down with barely a whimper. Th e only documentation of its 

end that I have been able to fi nd is a scrawled copy of a letter that passes the news to a friend without further comment.69

Th

e early Meiji period, then, was a diff erent sort of watershed in the history of infanticide than Shibahara and his fellow governors intended. Th e abolition of the 

domains in 1871 destroyed their long-established regimes of subsidies and surveillance. Th

e early-Meiji schemes promised to revive such policies in some areas and to extend them to others, such as on the Bōsō peninsula, where they had been conspicuously absent in the Edo period. Yet by 1880, no more pregnancies were monitored in Japan; with a few municipal exceptions, the only realistic source of subsidies for poor parents was private philanthropy. 

Although a number of individuals and religious or philanthropic organizations stepped into the breach around 1880, even such private eff orts seem to have fallen far short of their Edo-period precursors. Th

e best-funded of the Meiji initiatives 

was probably the Ikujikai \(Childrearing Society\) of Kōchi, the prefecture that now governed the lands of the ancient province of Tosa. In Ibaraki, an Ikuei Dōmeisha \(Infant-Rearing League\) formed in 1881.70 In Tokyo, Miyagi, Akita, Nagano, and Aichi, Buddhist priests opened at least seven foundling homes between 1879 and 1886, sometimes with offi

cial support,71 and in Okayama, the Christian convert 

Ishii Jūji founded his famous orphanage in 1887.72

In Tottori prefecture on the Japan Sea coast of western Honshu, a hinoeuma child named Fujioka Kichihei took it upon himself to lecture women whom he considered at risk for abortions. While he was ultimately recognized by the governor for his labors, his day-to-day experiences were less exalted. In the villages, he frequently met with insults and urgent requests for the removal of his person. He probably did not increase his popularity by his habit of reporting suspected abortions to the police.73 Edo-period campaigns against infanticide had been the shared concern of extensive networks of local elites. When men like

Fujioka carried the same spirit deep into the Meiji period, they found themselves treated as mavericks.

Th

roughout the history of infanticide countermeasures, demographic concerns heightened the urgency of the perceived moral crisis. Enthusiasm for demographic expansion was part of the early Meiji eff orts and pronouncements against infanticide, which rang with references to the “multiplication of the population” and 

“propagation of the human seed” \( *hitodane hanshoku*\). When the headcounts of the mid-1870s reported steady population growth, saving infant lives lost its demographic urgency. Another important reason why infanticide faded from public view, however, may have been a change in attitudes vis-à-vis Japan’s status as a civilized nation. 

Although also a refl ection of genuine moral and demographic concerns, eff orts against infanticide briefl y allowed governors from Western Japan to distinguish themselves before their peers as civilizers of a semi-savage periphery. Within a few years, however, the view that infanticide was incompatible with civilization may paradoxically have become an obstacle to its eradication. Th e feverish rearrangement of prefectural boundaries in the fi rst years of the new regime destroyed the framework in which many of the new countermeasures had been conceived. In addition, the continual rotation of governors, frequently removing them as soon as they had gained some familiarity with local conditions, created a class of administrators who were more closely linked to their colleagues than to their jurisdictions. 

Th

e professional context of the governors had two grave implications for the fi ght against infanticide. First, aft er the early Meiji years, declaring one’s temporary turf a holdout of barbarism was a sure way of cultivating enemies among the insulted local notables. In 1872, a call to rid one’s locale of the remnants of a savage past was an invitation to join a new Japan. By 1880, local elites generally took their membership in that new polity and civilization for granted. Second, it would hardly be collegial to discover that infanticide was a problem in a prefecture aft er another governor had so recently administered it. Th

e ebb of the early-Meiji surge 

of infanticide countermeasures coincided with the establishment in 1875 of an Assembly of Prefectural Governors, which strengthened the esprit de corps of that class of offi

Aft er the early 1870s, the fi ght against infanticide no longer inspired many private individuals to charity or advocacy, either. While it can be diffi cult to explain 

an absence, a silence, or an event that failed to transpire, the historical context permits a number of speculations. With the reform of the tax system, villages were relieved from collective responsibility for the rice tribute. With the abolition of the

domains, labor could move freely within Japan. Local infanticide and depopulation therefore no longer threatened the economic interests of village elites as they once had. In addition depopulation in general lost its terror, as growing headcounts were now recorded throughout Japan. 

Fighting infanticide also no longer promised the same rewards to private individuals. During the Tokugawa period, conspicuous philanthropy had been one of very few ways in which village elites could convert fi nancial into political and social capital. With the abolition of the status system, there were now many ways to rise in the world. Th

e lives of the upwardly mobile increasingly took place on a national stage, with its universities, business associations, and political parties. 

Th

is made it less urgent to reform or impress neighbors in the hometown, and also potentially more damaging to point fi ngers at their childrearing ways. Th e reputation of a village, district, and prefecture might follow an ambitious man even as his own ambitions were directed elsewhere. How attractive many men must have found it to pass in silence over the distasteful habits of their neighbors and focus their energies on making their way in a far larger world. 

Perhaps for these reasons, the fi rst round of the internal civilizing project was declared a success relatively quickly. Already by the spring of 1874, large sections of Japanese society felt they had acquired such a high degree of civilization that they were ready to share it with their Taiwanese neighbors, and cheered a punitive expedition to that island.75 To be sure, new civilizing campaigns were intermit-tently launched. For example, with Japan’s emergence as a “fi rst-rate power” in the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese wars of the turn of the twentieth century, the Chihō Kairyō \(Local Improvement\) movement once again sought to bring pockets of internal backwardness up to the standard befi tting Japan’s new international status.76 As we shall see in chapter 13, a few men at this time tried to do something about Japan’s extraordinary stillbirth rates, but their eff orts fell far short of a renewed campaign against infanticide and abortion. 

In the twentieth century, infanticide had become so unthreatening that it was oft en studied as a quaint aspect of the past, or remembered as a yardstick for all the progress Imperial Japan had made. Th

e people of one village in Fukushima prefec-

ture recalled in their village plan of 1902 that whereas in the past people had raised at most four children, “those born since the laws of civilization were promulgated are all being brought up, and it is now not uncommon to raise as many as seven or eight.”77 A little later, folklorists \( *minzokugakusha*\) began to seek out that past by questioning old people about the childrearing ways of their youth. Intrigued as they were by all things starkly traditional, folklorists found infanticide a natural topic for their inquiries.78 Th

eir eff orts culminated in a nationwide survey of birth-

ing customs fi nanced by the Maternal Nurturance Association \(Boshi Aiikukai\), which dedicated an entire chapter of its report, published in 1935, to infanticide and abortion.79 Its editors simply gathered the reports about folk customs and

apparently saw no need to stress that infanticide and abortion were particularly evil. Instead, they were evidently fascinated with the varied euphemisms locals used to describe the disposal of a child, from “I sent her picking fl owers” to “I had him gather crabs.” Respondents themselves oft en emphasized that infanticide, once common in their community, had disappeared in the Meiji period. Th is may 

have been true in many individual cases, but as we shall see in the next chapter, infanticide was still an open secret in countless Japanese villages even in the 1920s. 

In the meantime, Japan had become a colonial power with the self-appointed mission of bringing civilization and modernity to its East Asian neighbors.
