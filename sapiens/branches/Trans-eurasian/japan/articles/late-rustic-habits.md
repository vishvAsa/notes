In 70s (Source: @bull_japanese etc..)

- jumping queue was common. People climbed through train windows to get seats.
- People including women pissed on the side of streets. (Continued in 2020, but more discreetly.) "Don't piss here" signs are still sold.
- Spitting on streets was common.
- Any puddle would soon become a sea of floating cigarette butts.
- Railroad tracks were covered in feces ("dump on tracks" toilets). Same in Britain.
