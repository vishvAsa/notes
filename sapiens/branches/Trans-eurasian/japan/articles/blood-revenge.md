Not only was it very rare but found out that blood revenge was elaborately regulated, u had to register ur intention to carry out a revenge killing with both ur local daimyo & the Tokugawa authorities, obtain paper approval, peasant women were allowed to kill Samurai men so long as they got gov't approval for the revenge which was only given for murder not mere insults. You also had to only kill the target approved not any1 else in his/her family, the killed person's family members in turn couldn't legally kill u or any1 in ur family because the killed person was a murderer. So no generations long Hatfield-Mccoy style feuding that was common in some societies like Sicily, Corsica etc:
