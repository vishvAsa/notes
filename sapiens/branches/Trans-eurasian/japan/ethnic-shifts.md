## Jomon and Ainu
- IQ of a certain Japanese Jomon ~95  [NIH](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9402434/)


### Observations
> The earlier peoples of Japan, the Jomon, were ancestors of the Ainu some of whom even today retain that Jomon ancestry in an unadulterated form. This Jomon-type ancestry is also seen elsewhere in east Asia like: 
> 
> 1) The Ulchi who live in eastern Russia & speak a Tungusic language.
> 2) They show relationship to the ancient Devils Gate people of Sikhote-Alin  mountains of Russia who also show a similar admixture with the Jomon-like component as the Ulchi; 
> 3) the ancient Hòabìnhian hunter gatherers of Vietnam also show some of this Jomon-Ainu like ancestry. 
> 4) The ~40KY old Tianyuan man from China also shows some of this Jomon-like Ancestry. 

### Deep origins
> They also find evidence that a lineage related to the Jomon contributed to the ancestry of the Taiwan aborigines like the Ami & the Atayal. All together it appears that the Jomon were remnants of an old basal Asian branch that branched off from the rest of east-moving Homo after the Onge but before the common ancestor of the First Americans and East Asians had split into those two branches. 
> 
> Their presence in coastal East Asia like Taiwan, Malaysia, Japan suggests that they spread along the coast to eventually go deeper into what's now eastern Russia. Eventually by the Neolithic they were wiped out in most of Asia except for remnants like those noted above.  - MT

## Japanese invasion
> Using ALDER they estimate the admixture between the Jomon and an invading East Asian group related to Hans happening around 42-57 generations back in Japan. The suggest a lower bound date for this as ~200-300 CE. That can be taken to be the point of ethnogenesis of the modern Japanese. ... The time-frame from the admixture evidence points to the ethnogenesis of J in the Kofun rather than Yayoi period.
>
> The Kofun period was when there was a dramatic change in Japanese archaeological horizon with shared developments seen in Korea. This is also the period when chIna-s like the descendants of the Chin Shi Huang & several clansmen of Han warlords and K reached Japan. Some Korean lords also reached Japan. However, it is notable that despite the big influence of these chIna warlords Japanese is not a Sino-Burman language and while sharing some typological commonalities with Korean is at best very distantly related to it. Moreover, the Kofun period marks the emergence of horse-borne elite that had distinctive role in the development of the unique aspects of Japanese culture and religion. These had similarities in a cultural sense to the Iranic steppe peoples. However, the genetic evidence does not point to any role of those people in directly contributing to J ancestry. Hence, it might be suggested that an East Asian steppe group with genetic links to Mongolic peoples and speaking a language with those "Altaic" features that developed on the Mongol and eastern steppes were the invaders of Japan who conquered it from the Ainu-like people and mixed with that substratum. This was probably followed by even more Hanization by the rise of chIna-s from warlord clans to high positions in Japan. - MT

### Impact
Japanese settlement of japan 500 BC is 80% replacement

### Trans-eurasianness
> She (Dr. Robbeets) lists a number of lexical correspondences, e.g. words for “hard” in Turkic, Mongolic, Korean and Japanese can be deduced from a common origin *kata. But the critical evidence is the list of correspondence between morphological markers. These are unlikely to be exchanged between languages; English has a few from French and Latin (e.g. the suffix -nce in comeuppance, or -able in likeable, and even these are not part of the intimate layer of morphology, such as verb conjugation), but it has been exposed for many centuries to an intense impact of these languages. Japanese, by contrast, has not in living memory been in contact with Turkic, Mongolian and Tungusic. So, when she finds the same suffix or infix present in all five language groups (or in one case four out of five), it is a strong pointer to deep kinship between the languages. - KE
