In addition, personal reasons related to local custom and culture also forms obstacle for Islamic da'wah. Among the prospective Muslim converts, there is a fear of being isolated by their families and friends or discriminated at work if they converted to Islam. Such a feeling is primarily obvious among the Japanese since in Japan religion is part of the cherished national and traditional culture which needs to be maintained in order to avoid breakdown in the Japanese society. To most Japanese, abandoning religion is thus, seen as an act of selfishness on the part of the converts who place personal beliefs ahead of family or collective duties. Consequently, some Japanese converts have to face rejection by their families and alienation from friends as their conversion is seen as "un-Japanese" or an act of betrayal of Japanese customs and traditions, which form the Japanese identity. Apart from social ostracism by family and friends, conversion could also affect one's economic security or employment in government or private enterprise [23].
