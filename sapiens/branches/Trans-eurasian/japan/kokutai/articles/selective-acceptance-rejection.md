1) For example, the active ideological push by the state to reject Christianity & promotion of Shinto

2) The rejection of western sewer systems & continued use of humanure until all the way to 1960's. Meiji leaders who traveled to the west even had a pointed criticism of the wasteful practices of western nations who imported tons of guano while flushing human shit into rivers poisoning them instead of putting it to use as fertilizer

3) The rejection of advice from Western advisers like Richard Henry Brunton to improve the poor road system & instead choosing to invest in railways as the future of Japan. It wouldn't be until 1960's that roads in Japan got serious upgrades, you can say Japan is unique among first world countries in the extent to which it relies on rail as a result of choices made during the Meiji era
