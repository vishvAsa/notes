He sent messengers this time to Padre Coelho demanding his immediate reply to the following for questions:

1. Why do you missionaries so anxiously, even forcefully, try to make converts?

3. Why do you do such unreasonable things as eat useful animals like horses and cows that serve people?
4. Why do the Portuguese buy many Japanese and take them to their country as slaves?
