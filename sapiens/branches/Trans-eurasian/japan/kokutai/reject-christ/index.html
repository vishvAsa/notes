  <meta property="og:description" content="Post 16th century Japan. Provocations planned subversion [SP], selling Japanese into slavery [H], rabid conversion [H], conversion for money [N] forcible conversions of the populace by Christian daimyo. Iconoclasm “The balance sheet for the three months spent by Valignano in Arima was as follows: All the temples of their camis and fotoques (gods and Buddhas) were broken up and destroyed - more than forty of them, large and small, among them some of the most beautiful and renowned in all Japan; and all the bonzes either turned Christian or left (Dom Protasio’s) lands. And apart from those who newly came to Holy Baptism, there rose again in these lands of Arima more than seven thousand souls, those that had either fallen in the persecutions of the previous years or had been living without Padres, without churches, and without doctrine. … The bonzes were married, the idols were broken up, and the number of converts grows day by day…. As Frois notes additionally, from this destruction of Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples “there were salvaged some remnants for the profit of the church,” because Dom Protasio, “in accordance with a request” from Valignano, donated “the most important temples and their sites for Jesuit projects. The buildings of one such temple were converted into the Jesuits’ first formal educational institution in Japan, the boys’ preparatory school known as the Arima seminario, which Valignano called into existence some time before the end of June 1580. By October, the school had enrolled twenty-two pupils, children of noble houses from all over Kyushu; most of them were eventually to enter the Society of Jesus.” “As Omura Sumitada had gone off to the wars, it so happened that he passed on the way an idol, Marishiten by name, which is their god of battles. When they pass it, they bow and pay reverence to it, and the pagans who are on horseback dismount as a sign of their respect. Now the idol had above it a cockerel. As the daimyo came there with his squadron he had his men stop and ordered them to take the idol and burn it together with the whole temple; and he took the cockerel and gave it a blow with the sword, saying to it, “Oh, how many times have you betrayed me!” And after everything had been burnt down, he had a very beautiful cross erected on the same spot, and after he and his men had paid very deep reverence to it, they continued on their way to the wars. &#34; - Luis Fróis (1532 - July 8, 1597), a Portuguese Christian missionary giving an eyewitness description of non Christian shrines being destroyed by Japanese converts.

<li>&ldquo;The balance sheet for the three months spent by Valignano in Arima was as follows: All the temples of their camis and fotoques (gods and Buddhas) were broken up and destroyed - more than forty of them, large and small, among them some of the most beautiful and renowned in all Japan; and all the bonzes either turned Christian or left (Dom Protasio&rsquo;s) lands. And apart from those who newly came to Holy Baptism, there rose again in these lands of Arima more than seven thousand souls, those that had either fallen in the persecutions of the previous years or had been living without Padres, without churches, and without doctrine. &hellip; The bonzes were married, the idols were broken up, and the number of converts grows day by day&hellip;. As Frois notes additionally, from this destruction of Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples “there were salvaged some remnants for the profit of the church,” because Dom Protasio, &ldquo;in accordance with a request&rdquo; from Valignano, donated &ldquo;the most important temples and their sites for Jesuit projects. The buildings of one such temple were converted into the Jesuits&rsquo; first formal educational institution in Japan, the boys&rsquo; preparatory school known as the Arima seminario, which Valignano called into existence some time before the end of June 1580. By October, the school had enrolled twenty-two pupils, children of noble houses from all over Kyushu; most of them were eventually to enter the Society of Jesus.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;As Omura Sumitada had gone off to the wars, it so happened that he passed on the way an idol, Marishiten by name, which is their god of battles. When they pass it, they bow and pay reverence to it, and the pagans who are on horseback dismount as a sign of their respect. Now the idol had above it a cockerel. As the daimyo came there with his squadron he had his men stop and ordered them to take the idol and burn it together with the whole temple; and he took the cockerel and gave it a blow with the sword, saying to it, &ldquo;Oh, how many times have you betrayed me!&rdquo; And after everything had been burnt down, he had a very beautiful cross erected on the same spot, and after he and his men had paid very deep reverence to it, they continued on their way to the wars. &quot; - Luis Fróis (1532 - July 8, 1597), a Portuguese Christian missionary giving an eyewitness description of non Christian shrines being destroyed by Japanese converts.</li>

<p>&ldquo;the French built a ranch, and five or six priests took up their residence there. They gave waives of a hundred or two hundred rios annually to about twenty Japanese readers and sent them out in the disguise of traders or travelling students to Hirado, Shimabara in Hizen, to Fttkabori and to Amakusa. To the poor they gave money, and to the superstitious they exhibited prodigies in order to proselytise them, or worked upon their feelings by conventicles. (A conventicle is a meeting of both sexes at night in a secret diamber for pleasure.) In a short time, therefore, one or two hundred fellows sprang up who disregarded the most stringent injunctions of the lords of the districts, and neglected the social relations and the five virtues— a most fearful state of things, indeed.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The Jesus of Protestant Doctrine&rdquo; -</p>
<p>&ldquo;These priests of the Jesus doctrine live mostly in private houses, and under pretence of teaching astronomy, geography, and the use of fire-arms, and medicine desire in actual fact to spread about the abominable poison of Jesus. Compared with the Roman Catholic religion this is a very cunning doctrine indeed. Although they try to make out that there is nothing abominable in it, they are really foxes of the same hole, and it is really more injurious than the Roman Catholic doctrine. &hellip; But in the matter of abolishing Shinto and Buddhism and of treating prince and father with contempt it does not differ from the Roman Catholics, for which reason it is very hurtful to the state. &quot;</p></blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;There is another poorly known aspect of the war which is the role of the Christian missionaries. They were key in spreading anti Japanese propaganda back home in mleccha lands. In the 1930&rsquo;s Inazo Nitobe gave some speeches here in North America and in one of them he warned the missionaries to stay out of the war between Japan and China.&rdquo; [<a href="https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/603679432386191360">T1</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/611913981121417216">T2</a>]</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>This challenge was heightened on a recent visit to Japan when I toured the ancient city of Kyoto for the first time. In that city, which is said to be the core from which Japanese culture radiates, the beauty of the formal gardens enthralled me. Their entire landscape is a magnificent work of art. I was also impressed by the pervasive idolatry throughout the whole city, and began to suspect that Kyoto might be not only the seat of Japanese culture but also the seat of satan, much like ancient Pergamos, where satan&rsquo;s throne was located (see Rev. 2:13). It could be that powers of darkness, directed and coordinated from Kyoto, have succeeded in blinding the eyes of the Japanese people to the gospel of Christ.</p>
<p>For some reason, the investment in Christian missionary personnel, time, energy, and money in Japan has produced perhaps the lowest return through the years of any nation of the world. Who knows how many conferences have been held to devise new strategies? Who knows how many theses and dissertations have been written to address the problem? Who knows how many prayer meetings have focused on Japan? And still far less than 1 percent of Japanese are practicing Christians, while just across the Sea of Japan churches are multiplying in South Korea and China with minimal missionary investment. I cannot help but feel that large-scale spiritual warfare could be a key to bringing Japanese people to Christ. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if satan knows this also, and has combated it in part by erecting a formidable barrier between evangelicals on one hand and Pentecostals and Charismatics on the other.</p>
<p>We have tried almost everything else. Why not try spiritual warfare? If God had called me to be a leader in the evangelization of Japan, I believe I would (1) seek God&rsquo;s power to tear down that barrier between the Christian factions; (2) train Japanese pastors and lay leaders in personal deliverance ministries; and (3) look to God for directions as to how to identify, engage, and break the power of the territorial spirits that have had Japan in their clutches for centuries. I mention Japan simply as an example that I am personally acquainted with. I suspect that similar experiments could be attempted in other parts of the world. - <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Supernatural_Forces_in_Spiritual_Warfare/NWRKT39oQl0C?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=spiritual+warfare+japanese+kyoto&amp;pg=PT50&amp;printsec=frontcover">GB</a></p></blockquote>
