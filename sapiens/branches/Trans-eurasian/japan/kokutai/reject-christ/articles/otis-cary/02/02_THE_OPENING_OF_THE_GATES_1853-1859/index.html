When it became known that the United States was fitting out an expedition to Japan, great interest was aroused among those who hoped that among its results would be the opening of the land to the Gospel.

When Commodore Perry offered to take these sailors to their own country, only one of them accepted the offer. The sailors gave him the nickname “Sam Patch,” by which he was known to foreigners through the remainder of his life. In the account of the expedition Commodore Perry says:">

<p>When it became known that the United States was fitting out an expedition to Japan, great interest was aroused among those who hoped that among its results would be the opening of the land to the Gospel. One young man, Jonathan Goble, joined the force of marines for the purpose of gaining such knowledge of Japan as would help in future attempts at its evangelisation. During the last part of the outward voyage he had an opportunity to begin missionary work by instructing a Japanese who was one of a crew of shipwrecked sailors picked up by an American ship and sent to China. When Commodore Perry offered to take these sailors to their own country, only one of them accepted the offer. The sailors gave him the nickname &ldquo;Sam Patch,&rdquo; by which he was known to foreigners through the remainder of his life. In the account of the expedition Commodore Perry says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the marines named Goble, a religious man, had taken a special interest in him; finding in his docility and intelligence promise of good fruit from a properly directed religious training. Goble had begun with him a system of instruction which he hoped would not only make the Japanese a fair English scholar, but a faithful Christian. Sam came to the United States in the <em>Mississippi</em>, and accompanied his benevolent shipmate and devoted teacher to his home in the interior of New York.&rdquo;*</p>
<p>Dr. S. Wells Williams, whose association with shipwrecked Japanese had given him opportunities to gain some knowledge of their language, and whose acquaintance with Chinese ideographs could also be utilised, accepted with some misgivings the office of interpreter to the expedition. It may be that some of the Christian literature prepared by the aid of the shipwrecked Japanese was taken by him or others; for Spalding in his account of the expedition says that &ldquo;some, temporarily connected with the squadron, distributed &lsquo;Yesoo&rsquo; or religious tracts among the people during our stay, which was not adventitous [<em>sic</em>] for our objects.&rdquo; The narrative does not make clear whether this distribution was in Loochoo or in Japan proper.*</p>
<p>While the expedition was in Loochoo, Dr. Bettelheim aided in the preparation of documents that were to be used in Japan, To show his appreciation of this help, the Commodore offered to repair the house in which Dr. Bettelheim lived, and for this purpose sent a company of men on shore. These persons procured some liquor and became so unruly that they did more harm than good to the building. The work was then put in Mr. Goble&rsquo;s care. His faithfulness in this and other tasks led Commodore Perry to offer him promotion. Mr. Goble said that instead of this he would like to be allowed, on reaching Japan, to go ashore whenever there was an opportunity to do so. His request was granted, and by simply giving notice to his superior officer he could visit the shore at almost any time when a boat was going. The knowledge of the country thus obtained he utilised in the preparation of lectures that he afterwards gave in America and England. A few years later, as we shall sec, Mr. Goble went to Japan as a missionary.</p>
<p>It was well understood that the prejudices of the Japanese against Christianity would add to the difficulties of negotiating a treaty with them. In the directions sent by President Fillmore to the Secretary of the Navy it was said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The deep-seated aversion of this people to hold intercourse with Christian nations is said to be owing chiefly to the indiscreet zeal with which the early missionaries, particularly those of Portugal, endeavoured to propagate their religion. The Commodore will therefore say that the Government of this country, unlike those of every other Christian country, does not interfere with the religion of its own people, much less with that of other nations,&rdquo;</p>
<p>The President&rsquo;s letter to the &ldquo;Emperor of Japan&rdquo; touched upon the same point:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Constitution and laws of the United States forbid all interference with the religious or political concerns of other nations, I have particularly charged Commodore Perry to abstain from every act which could possibly disturb the tranquillity of your Imperial Majesty&rsquo;s dominions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reality of the Japanese prejudice was manifested when the treaty came to be signed. The English version bears the date, &ldquo;This thirty-first day of March, in the year of our Lord Jesus Christ one thousand eight hundred and fifty-four, and of Kayei the seventh year, third month, and third day;&rdquo; but the Japanese version omits the former of these two ways of designating time. Dr. Williams says in his journal:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my desiring them to sign and date their copy, a difficulty arose, for they would only affix the date in Kayei&rsquo;s name and year, while I required both their term and ours, as in the Dutch [version of the treaty]; they declined to write the characters for &lsquo;our Lord Jesus Christ,&rsquo; and the Commodore allowed this omission.&rdquo;*</p>
<p>Spalding says that when some of the Japanese and Americans were exchanging autographs, he requested one of the former to write his name on the title-page of a Book of Common Prayer, which happened to have a steel engraving of the Cross upon it. &ldquo;He had dipped his camel&rsquo;s-hair pencil into his portable inkstand, passed the point through his lips, and was about to write, when his eyes rested upon the cross; he instantly shook his head, threw the book upon the table, nor could he be induced to touch it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first two days after the American fleet reached Uraga, some of the Japanese officials had been allowed to come on board the flag-ship. The next day was Sunday, and when a boat containing several people of high rank came from the shore, they were informed that no visitors could be received on that day, which was one observed by Americans for the worship of God. The hymn appropriately chosen for the morning service was that commencing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Before Jehovah&rsquo;s awful throne,<br>
Ye nations bow with sacred joy;&gt; Know that the Lord is God alone;<br>
He can create, He can destroy.&rdquo;*
&ldquo;With the aid of many of the fine voices of the crew and the assistance of the brass instruments of the band, in sight of heathen temples, and perhaps in the hearing of their worshipers, swelled up &lsquo;Old Hundred&rsquo; like a deep diapason of old ocean.&rdquo; Thus did America call upon Japan, not only to have friendly relations with Western nations, but also to know and serve the Lord.</p></blockquote>
<p>Commodore Perry was not always so careful in his observance of the Sabbath as this incident might lead us to suppose. Dr. Williams at another time wrote in his journal:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although to-day is Sunday, there is little cessation from work or business, and if God adds His blessing and enables us to carry out the design of the expedition, it will not be because or in answer to our prayers or regard to Him, but because we are used as Nebuchadnezzar the ax-helve was, to carry out that which falls in with His plans. In fact, no regard seems to be paid here to whatever scruples a man may have about working on the Sabbath. . . . God&rsquo;s day, and by consequence His law, is made subordinate to the will of one man.&rdquo;*</p>
<p>Afterwards when Townsend Harris refused to transact business on the Sabbath, the Japanese urged &ldquo;that when Commodore Perry was here, he made no difference for Sunday.&quot;†</p>
<p>Whatever inconsistency there may have been in Commodore Perry&rsquo;s behaviour, he was not indifferent to the influence that his work would have upon the religious history of Japan. In a paper read in 1856, before the American Geographical Society, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though a sailor from boyhood, yet I may be permitted to feel some interest in the work of enlightening heathenism and imparting a knowledge of that revealed truth of God, which I fully believe advances man&rsquo;s progress here and gives him his only safe ground of hope for hereafter. To Christianise a strange people, the first important step should be to gain their confidence and respect by means practically honest and in every way consistent with the precepts of our holy religion.&quot;‡</p>
<p>Not only were religious services held upon the vessels of the fleet, but Christian funeral rites were performed upon the land. The first death occurred in Yokohama. The Japanese proposed that the body be sent to Uraga, whence they would take it by junk to Nagasaki for burial in a cemetery set apart for the interment of foreigners. They soon yielded, however, to Commodore Perry&rsquo;s remonstrances, and permitted the burial to be in Yokohama. Mr. Jones, the Chaplain, being in doubt as to whether the Japanese would allow Christian services to proceed without molestation, &ldquo;asked the Commodore for directions, and was told, &lsquo;Do exactly as you always do on such occasions, no more, nor no less;&rsquo; and in answer to his inquiry how he should act if interrupted, the answer was, &lsquo;Still go on and have your usual service.&rsquo; No opposition, however, was made, and the Chaplain felt that it was a day to be remembered that, after the lapse of centuries, a minister of Christ stood, in his own person, upon the soil of Japan and unmolested performed one of the rites of his faith.&rdquo; In describing the ceremony, Mr. Jones says that the company was received, on landing, by the Mayor of Uraga and his attendants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had expected that on their seeing me in my official costume and first knowing that there was a Christian minister on their shore and among them that there would be a recoil and that they would shrink from me as from something poisonous; but there was no such thing. On the contrary, they came up successively and gave me their hands for a shake. (They have learned our salutation and seem to be fond of it.) The interpreter, pointing to my prayer-book, asked if it were for ceremonies over the dead, and smiled as before when I told him that it was&hellip;.Our way led through the village, and the occasion seemed to excite quite a holiday among them; everybody, men, women, and children, running and gaining good places for seeing, and squatting down on the ground till we had passed, when they would run and gain another place for observation if they could. . . . They had selected for the interment a very pretty spot about a hundred yards from the village and closely adjoining an old burying-ground of their own. We found the Buddhist priest seated there, but he attempted no interference with our religious ceremonies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This priest remained during the Christian service, and at its close performed the rites of his own religion; beating a gong, burning incense, and reading prayers.*</p>
<p>Chaplain Jones&rsquo;s views concerning the possibilities of missionary work were expressed as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Apart from governmental influence, I think there would be no great difficulty in introducing Christianity, <em>but the Government would interfere most decidedly.</em> I performed funeral services on shore four times; once at Yokohama, twice at Hakodate, and once at Shimoda; in every instance in the presence of the Japanese, and in most when large numbers were collected. They always behaved well. Japanese officers were present, with their insignia, on all occasions, I thus became known among the people everywhere as a <em>Christian clergyman;</em> or, to follow their signs for designating me, as &lsquo;a praying man.&rsquo; Instead of this producing a shrinking from me, as I had supposed it would, I found that I had decidedly gained by it in their respect, and this among officials as well as commoners. At our last visit to Shimoda we found a new governor. . . . At the bazaar, amid the buying, etc., I was led up to him by one of the officials and introduced <em>as a clergyman.</em> The Governor&rsquo;s countenance brightened up as my office was announced, and his salutation and treatment of me became additionally courteous. I mention this, however, for what it may be worth. There was no seeming aversion to me because I was a minister of Christianity. The Government, however, beyond all doubt, is exceedingly jealous about our religion; but the Japanese officials as well as the people are so inquisittive and so observant of all that comes within their reach that, doubtless, after a time, they may be brought to see the difference between ourselves and the Romanists. Against the latter they have a deep-seated dislike. Until they do understand that difference, no form of Christianity can probably get foothold in Japan.&rdquo;*</p>
<p>Mr. Jones found an opportunity to give a little information about his religion:</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the priests approached, and, pointing to an image, asked Mr. Jones what it was called in America. He answered; <em>&lsquo;Nai.</em>&rsquo; &lsquo;We have it not.&rsquo; He then pointed to the altars and asked the same Question, to which he received the same reply. When the Chaplain left the temple, as he walked on, his official attendant asked him if the people prayed in America. He was answered in the affirmative, and Mr, Jones, dropping on one knee, joined his hands and, with upturned face, closed his eyes and pointed to the heavens to intimate by signs that we pray to a being there. He then asked his attendants if they prayed to that being. He replied:—&lsquo;Yes, we pray to <em>Tien,&rsquo;</em> their word for heaven or God.&quot;†</p>
<p>While Commodore Perry was in Japan, Rev. E. H. Moreton came to Loochoo to take the place of Dr. Bettelheim. Spalding describes him as &ldquo;a pleasant-voiced little preacher, with mild face and cockney aspiration of the letter H.&rdquo; He was accompanied by his wife and child. Dr. Bettelheim&rsquo;s family had been sent to China, and the Loochooan officials begged that they might also be relieved of him and Mr. Moreton. In a petition addressed to Commodore Perry they wrote:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the year 1844 and 1846 some French officers came, and the Englishman Bettelheim also brought hither his wife and children to reside, and they all required something to be daily given them, to our continual annoyance and trouble. Whenever an English or French ship came in, we earnestly represented these circumstances to them and besought them to take these people away with them. The Frenchmen, knowing our distresses, went away in the year 1848 to their own country and have not hitherto returned; but Bettelheim has loitered away years here and not gone; and now, further, has brought Moreton with his family to take his place and live here, greatly to the discomfort of the people, and distress and inconvenience of the country. We have learned that your excellency has authority over all the East Indian, China, and Japan seas, and not a ship of any Western country can go from one of these seas to the other but you know and regulate its movements. Therefore we lay before you our sad condition in all its particulars, humbly beseeching your kind regard upon it, and requesting that, when your fine ships return, you will take both Bettelheim and Moreton away with you. This will solace and raise us up from our low condition, and oblige us in a way not easy to be expressed.&rdquo;*</p>
<p>It had already been arranged that Dr. Bettelheim should be given passage to China; but the Loochooans had to endure the presence of his successor for two years, after which the latter also withdrew with shattered health. In 1860, the English Bishop of Victoria wrote:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since the close of 1855 no Protestant missionary has occupied that post; and in the face of the continued persistency of the Loochooan authorities in this course of passive resistance to all missionary efforts, it has been deemed inexpedient, if not impossible, to renew the mission. Besides, it was felt that the Japanese Government or (more accurately speaking) the agents of the Prince of Satsuma exerted an all-powerful control over this subject dependency, and that a continuance of the mission under such exceptional circumstances was to expose the local authorities themselves to severe punishment by their Japanese conquerors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Bettelheim went to the United States, where he tried in vain to secure such funds as would enable him to undertake work in the main islands of Japan. In a statement published April 5, 1855, in the *Independent (*New York), he said: &ldquo;There are a goodly number of believers in Loochoo, four of whom I baptised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The treaty made by Commodore Perry did not give foreigners the right to reside in Japan, and the country was still closed to missionary efforts; yet it was evident that what had been accomplished must lead, sooner or later, to a complete opening of the doors, and the missionary societies eagerly awaited further developments. In 1855, the Board of Foreign Missions of the Presbyterian Church in the United States, asked one of its missionaries in China to visit Japan and make such investigations as should prepare the way for future operations. Failure to obtain passage from Shanghai prevented the person appointed from making the visit.*</p>
<p>The treaty provided for the appointment by the United States of a consul, who should reside in Shimoda. The first person to hold this position was Townsend Harris. He arrived at his post in 1856. To him was entrusted the task of negotiating a new treaty that should carry one step further what had been done by Commodore Perry. The results showed that he was eminently fitted for this duty. Professor Nitobe says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If &lsquo;an ambassador,&rsquo; according to Wotton&rsquo;s definition, &lsquo;is an honest man sent to lie abroad for the commonwealth,&rsquo; Harris was no diplomat. If, on the contrary, an American minister to an oriental court is a representative of the moral principles of the great Christian republic, Harris deserves the name in its best sense.&quot;†</p>
<p>Dr. S. Wells Williams speaks of Mr. Harris as &ldquo;Truly a Christian man,&rdquo; and says, &ldquo;His success is better explained if the fact be known that it was in answer to prayer.&quot;‡</p>
<p>Mr. Harris&rsquo;s journals give abundant proof that he did not conceal his religion; and some of the entries, as the following, deserve a place in a history of Christianity in Japan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sunday, August 24, 1856. Do not leave the ship. In the afternoon the Japanese come off and desire to see me. I decline either to see them or to hear their messages, for the reason that it is Sunday. They urge me at least to hear their message, saying that it is very important and from the Governor. They also say that when Commodore Perry was here, he made no difference for Sunday, etc., etc. I adhere to my previous determination, telling them through Mr. Heusken that they can come off to-morrow morning as early as they please, and then state their message.&rdquo;*</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sunday, August 31, 1856. . . . Japanese come off to sec me. I refuse to see any one on Sunday. I am resolved to set an example of a proper observance of the Sabbath by abstaining from all business or pleasures on that day. I do not mean I should not take a quiet walk or any such amusement. I do not mean to set an example of Puritanism, but I will try to make it what I believe it was intended to be, a day of rest.&quot;†</p>
<p>In December, 1856, the ratified treaties between Russia and Japan were to be exchanged, and Harris was invited to assist in the ceremonies. His chief reason for refusing was that the day fixed for the exchange was Sunday. He wrote in his journal:</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the time of my arrival I have refused to attend to any kind of business on that day; and after a short time the Japanese ceased to ask it of me. Should I now join the Russians, I shall contradict all my previous acts on this account, and lose my character for <em>consistency,</em> a point that cannot be too carefully watched in dealing with people like the Japanese.&quot;‡</p>
<p>The journals often speak of his reading the Episcopal service, having Mr. Heusken, his interpreter, for &ldquo;clerk and congregation.&rdquo; Sunday, December 6, 1857, was spent in Yedo, and he wrote:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the second Sunday in Advent; assisted by Mr. Heusken, I read the full service in an audible voice, and with the paper doors of the house here our voices could be heard in every part of the building. This was beyond doubt the first time that the English version of the Bible was ever read or the American Protestant Episcopal service ever repeated in this city. What a host of thoughts rush upon me as I reflect on this event. Two hundred and thirty years ago, a law was promulgated in Japan inflicting death on any one who should use any of the rites of the Christian religion in Japan, That law is still unrepealed, and yet I have boldly and openly done the very acts that the Japanese law punishes so severely!. . . The first blow is now struck against the cruel persecution of Christianity by the Japanese, and, by the blessing of God, if I succeed in establishing negotiations at this time with the Japanese, I mean to boldly demand for the Americans the free exercise of their religion in Japan, with the right to build churches, and I will also demand the abolition of the custom of trampling on the cross or crucifix, which the Dutch have basely witnessed for two hundred and thirty years without a word of remonstrance. This custom has been confined to Nagasaki; had it been attempted at Shimoda, I should have remonstrated in a manner that would have compelled the Japanese to listen to me. I shall be both proud and happy if I can be the humble means of once more opening Japan to the blessed rule of Christianity.&rdquo;*</p>
<p>A week later, after speaking of a similar service, he added: &ldquo;I have told the Japanese that I performed my religious worship, in order that they may not say they had no knowledge of it.&quot;†</p>
<p>At a later date Mr. Harris sometimes had fellow-worshippers. A writer in the New York <em>Journal of Commerce</em> tells of a service held Sunday, August I, 1858, and attended by the officers and crews of the United States ships <em>Powhatan</em> and <em>Mississippi.</em> It was at Shimoda in the house occupied by the Consul-General. This was a temple, and the images, which had been removed from their usual place, were ranged about the walls of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strangely our Americans were assembled in an idol&rsquo;s temple to celebrate Christian worship for the first time since Christianity was extirpated by fire and sword, and Protestant worship for the first time since the Advent! The Bible was read, prayers were offered, a sermon was preached, and the sweet hymns of Zion were sung in tunes not less sweet or sacred, familiar to every one from childhood, but never so sweet and touching as when sung for the first time in Japan and poured out in this old heathen temple.&quot;‡</p>
<p>The writer of this account was, doubtless, Rev. Henry Wood, Chaplain of the <em>Powhatan,</em> who, we learn from other sources, conducted the service. One writer says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The house was surrounded by hundreds of Japanese anxiously watching what was going on. Inside of the house were several (six) Christian Japanese who had for some time been converted from heathenism.&quot;§</p>
<p>Chaplain Wood states that Mr. Harris showed him his letter of instructions from Mr. Marcy, the American Secretary of State, in which Mr. Harris was directed &ldquo;to do his best, by all judicious measures and kind influence, to obtain the full toleration of the Christian religion in Japan, and protection for all missionaries and others who should go there to promulgate it.&rdquo; Apparently there was some misunderstanding here, for, whatever may have been written in persona! letters, the only passage in the official instructions that bore upon the subject was the remark: &ldquo;The intolerance of the Japanese in regard to the Christian religion forbids us to hope that they would consent to any stipulation by which missionaries would be allowed to enter that empire, or Christian worship, according to the form of any sect, would be permitted.&rdquo;*</p>
<p>Whatever may have been the doubts of his superior concerning the possibility of obtaining any concession, Mr. Harris, as we have already seen, resolved to make the attempt; and his efforts were crowned with success, the eighth article of the treaty that he concluded providing that:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Americans in Japan shall be allowed the free exercise of their religion, and for this purpose shall have the right to erect suitable places of worship. No injury shall be done to such buildings, nor any insult be offered to the religious worship of the Americans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;American citizens shall not injure any Japanese temple or <em>miya,</em> or offer any insult or injury to Japanese religious ceremonies, or to the objects of their worship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Americans and Japanese shall not do anything that may be calculated to excite religious animosity. The Government of Japan has already abolished the practice of trampling on religious emblems.&quot;†</p>
<p>This treaty, which was signed in July, 1858, provided that certain ports should be available for the residence of American citizens; some of them to be open July 4, 1859, and others at later dates. The treaties that Japan subsequently made with England, France, and other nations were modelled upon this one. They did not give permission for preaching Christianity to the Japanese, and it is said that the endeavour of some of the foreign ambassadors to have an article to this end inserted, was obstinately resisted.* Yet there was reason to believe that, if missionaries availed themselves of the liberty to reside in Japan, they would find opportunities for teaching their religion to the people. An officer of the United States Navy had already, in 1857, written from Hakodate, expressing the opinion that the time had come for sending missionaries—prudent men, of tried experience —who &ldquo;must remember that it is death to a Japanese to become a Christian,&rdquo; and must not &ldquo;rush headlong into the work without considering secondary means;&rdquo; but who, if judicious, would probably &ldquo;meet with as much encouragement as they generally do when first commencing operations in heathen lands.&quot;†</p>
<p>Some of the missionaries in China visited Japan in order to see what openings there might be. Among these, in 1858, was Dr. S. Wells Williams. He says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was much impressed with what Mr, Donker Curtius, the Dutch envoy, who had just signed a treaty, then said; that the Japanese officials had told him they were ready to allow foreigners all trading privileges if a way could be found to keep opium‡ and Christianity out of the country. There were also then at Nagasaki Rev. Mr. Syle and Chaplain Henry Wood, and we three agreed to write to the directors of the Episcopal, Reformed, and Presbyterian Mission Boards, urging them to appoint missionaries for Japan who could teach the people what true Christianity was. Within the coming year we all had the pleasure of meeting the agents of these three societies In Shanghai.&rdquo;*</p>
<p>Mr. Syle wrote to the Missionary Board of the American Episcopal Church that he saw six young men belonging to the Governor&rsquo;s staff, who were &ldquo;gathered round the Rev. Mr. Wood, Chaplain of the <em>Powhatan,</em> who had been invited to become their instructor during his stay in the port.&rdquo; Captain Nicolson of the <em>Mississippi</em> mentioned having had three classes for the instruction of Japanese during his stay in Hakodate. Dr. Williams addressed a letter to Mr. Syle, in which he suggested that the best way to commence mission work would be to place a missionary in Nagasaki or Yedo, who would offer to teach English on condition that he should be assisted to learn the Japanese language.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This engagement may be entered into for two years at least, at the end of which time experience will prove the best guide to future operations. . . . If the mission he commenced by a discreet and patient man whose first object will be to teach his pupils to write and speak English, to whom is joined a physician whose object will be to practise gratuitously among the people at large and educate a few pupils in medicine and surgery, if they can he obtained, both of them full of love for souls and earnest in leading men to the Saviour, we may humbly look for their success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At a lunch on one of the American vessels, Mr. Syle sat between the Vice-Governor and an interpreter. He says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They both expressed and repeated the wish that I might come here to reside and to teach English. If I could not stay now, would I not come over in the first ship? and when would that first ship come? I was assured that I should have a house, and that my wife and children would be welcome. I took pains to tell them I was a preacher and not merely a teacher, and promised that I would write to America and see what could be done to meet their wishes.&quot;†</p>
<p>Chaplain Wood found opportunities to speak to his pupils about the truths of Christianity. In a letter to the New York <em>Journal of Commerce</em> he speaks of the way in which he utilised the appearance of Donati&rsquo;s comet:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the comet appeared in such length and splendour above the western mountains, they contemplated the strange sight with admiration, but not with terror, though they had no science or theory to account for it. . . . Very naturally, and indeed almost inevitably, the comet became an associate teacher in my seminary, furnishing the opportunity I was seeking to discourse on the great theme of God and His character, which I was wishing to introduce, but not violently or in a way to create offence and distrust, remembering the place where I stood and its history. When questions were proposed about the comet, it was easy and natural to proceed from the effect to the cause and to discourse on the existence and character of God, and the origin, the extent, and the laws of the material creation. The absurdity and folly of idols and idol worship were then argued. . . . Not only did they take no offence, but they listened with attention and respect, and seemed to give their assent. At this stage I did not venture to refer to Christianity. . . . I waited till I had secured the confidence of the Governor and the confidence and, I may add, the affection of the young men, nor even then did I make an onslaught, but, as I before remarked, waited for incidents or inquiries which should make the religious turn of the instruction natural and inevitable, and throw the responsibility, if anywhere, upon the Japanese themselves. Soon an opportunity was presented by the questions asked by one of the students when the words <em>church, pulpit, organ,</em> and <em>choir</em> occurred in one of the reading lessons This led to the explanation of the form of church edifices, the Sabbath, public worship, the singing in the church, the construction of an organ and the manner of playing it, the preacher and what he preached, and the happy effects of preaching upon those who heard and obeyed it. Thus Christianity in all its doctrines was expounded <em>at their own request.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;On another occasion the conversation turned upon the <em>soul,</em> which was explained as spiritual, imperishable, immortal. What then, they inquired, becomes of it when the body dies? &lsquo;God fakes the good,&rsquo; it was replied, &rsquo;to heaven.&rsquo; &lsquo;What is heaven?&rsquo; they asked again. I explained, when they caught the idea and exclaimed, &lsquo;Paradise! Paradise!&rsquo; The word had probably travelled down from the time of the Catholic missions. They next asked: &lsquo;What becomes of the bad men?&rsquo; They go to a bad place where they are punished for their wicked deeds.&rsquo; &lsquo;Is fire there?&rsquo; they anxiously inquired, showing that either such an idea was entertained in their own religion or else had been handed down by the tradition of centuries. They were perplexed about the meaning of the word <em>God</em> which I used. I explained, going from effects to a cause, from the world to Him who made it, when one exclaimed in high excitement: &lsquo;The Creator! The Creator!&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, this God mack us, and cares for us, and pities us.&rsquo; They themselves saw and knew that men are ignorant and wicked, and therefore God had sent Christ, His own Son, into the world to teach mankind and to save them. Interrupting me, one asked excitedly; &lsquo;Jesus Christ?&rsquo; In some way he had heard and understood the <em>double</em> name, but hesitated when he heard the <em>single</em> term only. &lsquo;Yes, Jesus Christ,&rsquo; I replied. &lsquo;He loved us; He pitied us; He came into the world to teach men to be good and show them how they could be happy when they die. But men were so wicked whom He came to make happy that they seized Him and put Him to death on the cross. He was buried, but He rose again.&rsquo; All this amazed them, evidently awakening their sympathy, and at the same time their admiration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another early teacher of English was Dr. McGowan, of the Ningpo Mission of the American Baptist Union, who, on his way to America, reached Nagasaki in January, 1859, and remained there several weeks. He had a class of several young men who had been educated as interpreters of Chinese, and who now wished to learn English. Dr. McGowan&rsquo;s ability to talk with them in the former language opened the way for more familiar relations than would otherwise have been possible. In a letter he says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as they were able to spell a few words, I presented each of them with copies of the New Testament in English and Chinese, which they gladly accepted for the use the volume would be in the acquisition of our language. Understanding Chinese perfectly, they could thereby get at much of the meaning of the English version of the sacred volume. But as nothing could be done without permission of the Governor, nor even spoken without his knowledge, his assent to the acceptance of the books was necessary. Assent was refused. My class would have imperilled their lives by retaining a page of the New Testament, a work expressly prohibited by name. The Scriptures were all returned to me, but copies of the newspaper that I had published in Chinese at Ningpo and had given away were retained and sought with avidity. A certain amount of religious matter will be tolerated in a book if it abound with what they consider useful knowledge and if the religious matter cannot be expurgated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a bookstore Dr. McGowan found a Japanese reprint of a book on the Law of Storms that he had published in China. In the original edition, after the author&rsquo;s name had been printed, &ldquo;American Christian Physician&rdquo;; but the Japanese had left out the ideographs for &ldquo;Christian.&rdquo; Other works prepared in China gained considerable circulation in Japan. Dr. Mc-Gowan wrote;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are probably few if any books published by missionaries in China on secular affairs that have not been re-published by the knowledge-loving Japanese, The largest work of the kind is from the pen of the senior missionary in China, Dr. Bridgman,—a geographical and statistical account of America issued some twenty years ago. To that book the Japanese are indebted for their knowledge of our country—a knowledge so precise as to excite surprise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He suggests that this work may have prepared the way for the success of Commodore Perry. As will be seen in a later chapter, Joseph Neesima was among those reading Dr. Bridgman&rsquo;s book about the time of which Dr. McGowan writes. He who would understand the causes that have produced the New Japan ought not to overlook the important preparatory work that was done by the missionaries in China in giving to the young men of the island empire so many new and inspiring ideas.</p>

<p>* The name (<em>na</em>) of this Japanese was Sentaro. He united with a Baptist church in Hamilton, N. Y. It was hoped that he might take a prominent part in the evangelisation of his people; but he proved unfit for such labours. He died in 1874. Over his grave in Tokyo is a stone cross bearing the name by which he was best known. &ldquo;Sam Patch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>* In some accounts it is said that the hymn used was Keith&rsquo;s version of the One Hundredth Psalm, and it is so stated in the early editions of my &ldquo;Japan and Its Regeneration.&rdquo; The only contemporary evidence that I have found is in Spalding&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Japanese Expedition,&rdquo; p. 148, and he mentions the hymn given in the text. So also does Rev. John S. Sewall, D.D, in &ldquo;The Logbook of the Captain&rsquo;s Clerk,&rdquo; p. 153; but a letter from Dr. Sewall tells me that he is not sure which of the two hymns was used.</p>

<p>‡ The merchants were as eager to introduce opium as Christians were to send the Gospel. Chaplain Wood wrote November 7, 1859. &ldquo;The first English ship which entered a port of Japan, Nagasaki, after the conclusion of the American treaty and before the English treaty was concluded, was a smuggler of opium, attempting to introduce it stealthily and fraudulently into a nation which does not use it and whose laws prohibit it. That ship I saw. . . . The house owning that vessel has been known to make, as I am informed, half a million of dollars a year in the Chinese opium trade, and is not content with the wage of its iniquity. It is one of the first English houses in China.&rdquo; N Y. <em>Journal of Commerce,</em> quoted in <em>Spirit of Missions,</em> March, 1860.</p>
