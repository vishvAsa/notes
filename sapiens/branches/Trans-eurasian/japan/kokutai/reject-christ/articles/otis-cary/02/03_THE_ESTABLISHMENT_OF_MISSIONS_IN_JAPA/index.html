Williams, both of whom were missionaries in China, to open work in Japan, “requesting them to remove to that empire, and to enter upon the missionary work there immediately after receiving these instructions.”
When Mr. Liggins learned of this appointment, he was already in Japan, whither he had gone to recover from the effects of a fever and from injuries inflicted by a Chinese mob. He arrived at Nagasaki, May 2, 1859. This was two months before the provisions of the treaty permitted residence; but through the assistance of the United States Consul he secured permission to remain, and obtained a house in which to live. He was soon joined by Mr. Williams.">

  <p>EARLY in 1859, the Mission Board of the American Episcopal Church appointed Rev. John Liggins and Rev. C. M. Williams, both of whom were missionaries in China, to open work in Japan, &ldquo;requesting them to remove to that empire, and to enter upon the missionary work there immediately after receiving these instructions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Mr. Liggins learned of this appointment, he was already in Japan, whither he had gone to recover from the effects of a fever and from injuries inflicted by a Chinese mob. He arrived at Nagasaki, May 2, 1859. This was two months before the provisions of the treaty permitted residence; but through the assistance of the United States Consul he secured permission to remain, and obtained a house in which to live. He was soon joined by Mr. Williams.</p>
<p>Mr. Liggins found that the teaching of English afforded one of the best opportunities for usefulness. He soon had a class of eight government interpreters. As the Christian Scriptures were prohibited, he thought that &ldquo;missionaries must be content to circulate scientific works containing an admixture of Christianity.&rdquo; By August he had sold or given away one hundred and fifty copies of such books. He wrote:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I look upon these geographical, historical, and scientific works prepared by the missionaries in Chinese as the pioneer literature for Japan; and as works in Chinese are understood by all well-educated Japanese, these works are destined to be eminently useful in doing away with this people&rsquo;s misconception of Christianity and thus preparing the way for the circulation of the Scriptures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>October 18, 1859, J. C. Hepburn. M.D., of the American Presbyterian Board, landed with his wife in Kanagawa; and in November, Rev. Samuel R. Brown and D. B. Simmons, M.D., both of the Reformed Church in America, reached the same port. Mr. Brown and Dr. Hepburn had, several years before this, been for short periods missionaries in China.</p>
<p>The three boards that had been urged by Dr. Williams, Mr. Syle, and Chaplain Wood, to begin work in Japan had thus quickly responded to the appeal. Dr. Williams afterwards wrote: &ldquo;I do not know that better men could be found to begin missionary efforts than Brown, Hepburn, and Liggins.&rdquo;*</p>
<p>One reason why it had been deemed appropriate that the Reformed (Dutch) Church in America should engage in this new enterprise, was because it was thought that it would be able to profit by the relations that had previously existed between Holland and Japan. This consideration made the missionary board of that church desire to send out some one whose birth in Holland made Dutch his mother tongue. Such a person was found in a young man named Guido F. Verbeck. who was about to graduate from the theological seminary in Auburn, N. Y. He accepted the invitation of the Reformed Board, accompanied Messrs. Brown and Simmons as far as Shanghai, and reached Nagasaki, November 7. The families of Messrs, Brown, Simmons, and Verbeck, remained for a while in Shanghai, whence they proceeded in December to Japan.</p>
<p>Though the names of some of the first missionaries will frequently appear in the following narrative, it may be well to add here a few notes concerning the six men to whom was given the honour of inaugurating the work of Protestant missions in Japan.</p>
<p>Rev, John Liggins was born at Nuneaton in Warwickshire, England, May 11, 1829. In 1841, he removed to Philadelphia, Pa. He graduated in 1855, from the Theological Seminary of the Protestant Episcopal Church at Alexandria, Va. In November of the same year he sailed for China. The ill health that had led him to visit Japan permitted him to remain there only about ten months. Returning to America, he engaged in literary work. Among his publications were, &ldquo;England&rsquo;s Opium Policy,&rdquo; &ldquo;A Missionary Picture Gallery,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Great Value and Success of Foreign Missions.&rdquo; While in Nagasaki he prepared a book entitled &ldquo;One Thousand Familiar Phrases in English and Japanese,&rdquo; which was the first book of the kind written in Japan.</p>
<p>Right Rev. Channing Moore Williams was born in Richmond, Va., July, 1829. He went to China at the same time with Mr, Liggins. In 1866, he was made Bishop of China and Japan. The growth of the work in the two countries, and the increasing difficulty of properly caring for so large a diocese, led to the appointment, in 1874, of another bishop for China, while Bishop Williams remained in Japan. In 1889. he resigned this charge, but continued in active work as a missionary until 1908, when he returned to America.</p>
<p>James Curtis Hepburn, M.D., LL.D., was born in Milton, Penn., March 13, 1815. He graduated from Princeton College in 1832, and from the Medical Department of the University of Pennsylvania in 1836. In 1840, he married Miss Clara M. Leete. After graduation he practised medicine in America for a few years, and in 1841, went to Singapore as a medical missionary. Two years later he removed to Amoy. The ill health of Dr. and Mrs. Hepburn made it necessary to relinquish this work, and in 1846, they returned to America, settling in New York, where he established a lucrative practice. When Japan was opened, the Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions asked him to take up work in that land, and thus it was that, as we have seen, he went there in 1859. Hereafter there will be occasion to speak not only of his medical work, but also of his literary labours in the preparation of tracts, in the translation of the Scriptures, and in lexicography. In 1892, he retired from the work and returned to America. Perhaps no other missionary in Japan gained to so great a degree the esteem of all classes of people, Japanese and foreign. The <em>Japan Mail</em> spoke of him as &ldquo;a man whose name will be remembered with respect and affection as long as Yokohama has annals. . . . The beauty of his character, his untiring charity, his absolute self-negation, and his steady zeal in the cause of everything good, constitute a picture which could not fail to appeal to the Japanese people.&rdquo; On his ninetieth birthday, in 1905, the Emperor of Japan conferred upon him the decoration of the Third Class of the Imperial Order of the Rising Sun.</p>
<p>Rev. Samuel Robins Brown, D.D., was born in East Windsor, Conn., June 16, 1810. His father was a carpenter; his mother wrote the well-known hymn, &ldquo;I love to steal awhile away.&rdquo; While he was still young, his parents removed to Monson, Mass., where his childhood was spent. He graduated from Yale College in 1832. He was accepted by the American Board for service in China; but as lack of funds made it impossible to send him, he went in 1838 to that country as a teacher for the Morrison Education Society, which had been established there by Christian merchants. After eight years he returned to the United States on account of Mrs, Brown&rsquo;s poor health. He took with him for education in America three Chinese lads, one of them being Yung Wing, who afterwards did so much to promote education among his countrymen. Dr. Brown established a private academy in Owasco Outlet, N. Y., and also was pastor of the Dutch Reformed Church in the same town. Going to Japan in 1859, he remained until 1879. He died at Monson, June 20, 1880. Besides other literary work, he was the chairman of the committee that had in charge the translation of the New Testament, and he shared with Drs. Hepburn and Greene the chief responsibility in that work. He will, however, be specially remembered as a teacher; for in Japan, as previously in China, he taught many young men who have since held prominent places in the religious, official, and business worlds. He inherited his mother&rsquo;s poetical genius, and was also a gifted musician. His biography has been published by Rev. W. E. Grif-fis, D.D., under the title, &ldquo;A Maker of the New Orient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>D. B. Simmons, M.D., resigned from the mission of the Reformed Board in 1860. He continued to practise Medicine in Yokohama until 1882.</p>
<p>Rev. Guido Fridolin Verbeck, D.D., was born January 23, 1830, in Zeist, Province of Utrecht, Netherlands. His father was burgomaster of Zeist. The son was educated as a civil engineer, and about 1852 went to pursue his profession in America. Believing, after a time, that he was called to the ministry, he entered the Theological Seminary at Auburn, N. Y., where he graduated in 1859. In April of the same year he was married to Miss Maria Manton of Philadelphia, and soon after sailed from New York for Japan. Like the other early missionaries, he found that the teaching of English afforded the first opportunities for usefulness. His success with his pupils led to his being invited to take charge of an English school that the Government established in Nagasaki. With the consent of his Board, he accepted the position, and in 1869 removed to Tokyo, where for four years he was connected with what later became the Imperial University. During this period and afterwards, he was constantly called upon to advise the Government in educational matters. His connection with the Government continued until 1878. All of this time he continued to preach and engage in other forms of religious work. In 1877, he received the Third Class decoration of the Imperial Order of the Rising Sun. In 1891, the Government showed its further appreciation of what he had done by granting a special passport that gave him and his family the right to travel or reside in any part of Japan in the same manner as subjects of the country. One reason for this was that Dr. Verbeck was &ldquo;a man without a country,&rdquo; having lost his citizenship in Holland and never having been naturalised in America. Hence, he could not claim protection from any foreign legation. After leaving the employ of the Government, he taught in a theological school, engaged in direct evangelistic work, and helped in the translation of the Scriptures. The excellent translation of the Palms is a monument to his industry and ability. He died March 10, 1898. The Emperor sent a gift of five hundred <em>yen</em> for the expenses of the funeral, which was attended by a representative of the Imperial Court and many other officials. The city government of Tokyo presented his family with a perpetual lease of the plot where his body was buried. Dr. Verbeck&rsquo;s biography has also been published by Dr. Griffis.</p>
<p>The wives of those of the above missionaries who were married deserve mention; but, as is so often the case, the materials for such notice are not easily found, and their work was not of such a kind as obtained much public record. Whatever success attended the labours of their husbands was doubtless due in large part to these noble women, and they should share with their husbands the honour that belongs to these missionary pioneers.</p>
<p>In a historical sketch prepared for the Missionary Conference held at Osaka in 1883, Dr. Verbeck quoted as follows from various reports that described the conditions under which the early missionaries laboured:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The missionaries soon found that they were regarded with great suspicion and closely watched, and all intercourse with them was conducted under strict surveillance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No teacher could be obtained at Kanagawa until March, 1860, and then only a spy in the employment of the Government. A proposal to translate the Scriptures caused his frightened withdrawal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The efforts of the missionaries for several years, owing to the surveillance exercised by the Government, were mostly confined to the acquisition of the language.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We found the natives not at all accessible touching religious matters. When such a subject was mooted in the presence of a Japanese, his hand would almost involuntarily be applied to his throat, to indicate the extreme perilousness of such a topic. If on such an occasion more than one happened to be present, the natural shyness of these people became, if possible, still more apparent; for you will remember that there was then little confidence between man and man, chiefly owing to the abominable system of secret espionage, which we found in full swing when we first arrived and, indeed, for several years after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The missionaries shared with the other foreign residents in the alarms incident to a disturbed state of the country, and were sometimes exposed to insult and even to assault.&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The swaggering <em>samurai</em>, armed with two swords, cast many a scowling look at the hated foreigners, whom they would gladly have expelled from their sacred soil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first it was the common impression that the Japanese language could be easily learned. It was afterwards found to be one of the most difficult in the world. The colloquial language differs much from that used in books. The civilisation of old Japan came largely from China, and with it came the Chinese ideographs and a large number of words. Speaking roughly, it may be said that it was necessary to learn two ancient Chinese dialects in addition to the original Japanese language. The use of the ideographs was, indeed, a help to those who had learned them in China, while to others they added greatly to the difficulties of study. Dr. Hepburn has said that at first the only help possessed by the missionaries in the way of books was the vocabulary translated from the Dutch by Dr. Medhurst. After a while Hoffman&rsquo;s Grammar of the Japanese language was sent to them, a few leaves at a time. No teachers could be obtained, and so new words were picked up from servants, carpenters, visitors, and others. After a year, a man offered to teach Japanese in exchange for instruction in English. When, however, the translation of Matthew was begun, the man, after completing the first chapter, refused to do any more, saying that it would cost him his life.*</p>
<p>Townsend Harris, who was now the United States Minister, continued to show a deep interest in Christian work. Dr. W. A. P. Martin, the well-known missionary in China, who visited Japan in 1859, wrote:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Harris received of me more than one hundred geographies (for which he paid) for distribution among officials, and asked me to send him Bibles for the same purpose. Still he thinks it best for missionaries to confine themselves to the sale of books, as the only safe ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Martin himself has had no small part in the evangelisation of Japan. A book (&ldquo;Tendosogen&rdquo;) on the evidences of Christianity, which he wrote for the Chinese, was among those early brought to Japan, where many thousand copies have been sold.</p>
<p>Mention has already been made of Mr. Jonathan Goble, who was a marine in Perry&rsquo;s expedition. On his return he lectured on Japan in America and England. After this, he spent some time in study and then, with his wife, went to Japan under the auspices of the American Baptist Free Mission Society,* landing in Kanagawa April 1, 1860. The Southern Baptist Convention, in 1860, appointed three men as missionaries to Japan. Two of these—Rev. J. Q. Rohrer and Rev. A. L. Bond— with their wives, sailed from New York in a ship of which nothing more was ever heard. The third—Rev. C. H. Toy—afterwards became a Unitarian, and a professor in Harvard Divinity School, The breaking out of the Civil War in America prevented further attempts to establish this Mission.†</p>
<p>In 1861, the English Bishop of Victoria, who had recently visited Japan, wrote to the British and Foreign Bible Society that all the Protestant missionaries there concurred &ldquo;in the view that it is highly impolitic and inexpedient in the present temper of the Japanese Government to attempt any distribution of a Japanese version of the Holy Scriptures among the people.&rdquo; He says that, &ldquo;at first, both at Kanagawa and Nagasaki, efforts were made by the custom-house native authorities to compel the missionaries to deliver up all Christian books.&rdquo; Mr. Liggins, who was then in America, wrote in reply to the implication of these statements that he had sold, before the Bishop&rsquo;s visit, sixty copies of the Chinese Scriptures and books wholly religious, besides two thousand magazines, partly religious and partly secular. A letter from Mr. Verbeck to Mr. Liggins said: &ldquo;I have lately sold sixty copies of a new work which contains a complete summary of Christian truth,&rdquo; while Mr. Brown wrote that he had sold two hundred copies of the New Testament. Mr. Liggins, after drawing attention to the fact that the American treaty allowed the Japanese to buy anything Americans might wish to sell, except opium and firearms, says that Mr. Harris told him that he had the &ldquo;article worded as it is expressly to cover the sale of Scriptures and other Christian books by the missionaries, and that he should interfere at once if there were any attempt to violate it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A letter written by Mr. Liggins in 1861, and published in <em>The Spirit of Missions,</em> gives a good summary of the situation in Japan at that time:</p>
<p>&ldquo;As some persons, because Japan is not open to missionary labours to the extent they wish it was, speak as if it were not opened at all, it seems necessary to state what missionaries can do at the present time in that country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;1. They can procure native books and native teachers by which to acquire the language, and of course, the acquisition of the language is, during the first few years, a principal part of their duty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;2. They can, as they are able, prepare philological works to enable subsequent missionaries and others to acquire the language with much less labour and in much less time than they themselves have to give to it; and each, in the course of a few years, may make his contribution towards a complete version of the Holy Scriptures in the Japanese language.</p>
<p>&ldquo;3. They can furnish the Japanese, who are anxious to learn English, with suitable books in that language, and thus greatly facilitate social and friendly intercourse between the two races.</p>
<p>&ldquo;4. They can dispose by sale of a large number of the historical, geographical, and scientific works prepared by the Protestant missionaries in China. Faithful histories of Christian countries tend to disarm prejudice and to recommend the religion of the Bible; while works on true science are very useful in a country where astrology, geomancy, and many false teachings on scientific subjects generally, are so interwoven with their religious beliefs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;5. They can sell the Scriptures, and religious books and tracts in the Chinese language, and thus engage in <em>direct</em> missionary work. As books in this language are understood by every educated Japanese, and as the sale of them is provided for by an article in the treaty, we have here a very available means of at once conveying religious truth to the minds of the Japanese.</p>
<p>&ldquo;6. They can by their Christian walk and conversation, by acts of benevolence to the poor and afflicted, and by kindness and courtesy to all, weaken and dispel the prejudices against them, and convince the observant Japanese that true Christianity is something very different from what intriguing Jesuits of former days, and unprincipled traders and profane sailors of the present day, would lead them to think it is.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Living epistles</em> of Christianity are as much needed in Japan as written ones; and it would be very sad if either were withheld through a mistaken idea that Japan &lsquo;is not open to missionary labour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just after the signing of the Treaties, the statement of some was: &lsquo;Japan is fully opened to the spread of Christianity.&rsquo; This the writer opposed at the time as contrary to the facts of the case; and he has now endeavoured to show that it is equally erroneous to assert, as some do. that it is not opened at all. What the writer has said on the subject is not the result of hearsay or of a flying visit to Japan; but of an experience in the work during the ten months that he resided in the country. This experience convinces him. that if missionaries faithfully embrace the openings which there are already, others will speedily be made: and the time will soon come when it may be said with truth, &lsquo;Japan is fully opened to the spread of Christianity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But perhaps it may be asked: &lsquo;Is it not still a law that a native who professes Christianity shall be put to death?&rsquo; To this an affirmative answer must he given; but it should be remembered that another law was passed at the same time which declared that any Japanese who returned to his native country after having been for any cause whatever in any foreign country should be put to death. As this latter law, though unrepealed, is not executed, so it is believed that the law against professing Christianity will in like manner not be enforced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In conversing with Mr. Harris, the United States Minister at Yedo, on this subject, he stated that he had used every endeavour to have this obnoxious law repealed, but without success; a principal reason being that the Government feared that it would form a pretext for the old conservative party to overthrow the Government and again get into power.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I do not believe,&rsquo; said Mr. Harris, &lsquo;after all that the other foreign ministers and myself have said on the subject, that this law will ever be enforced; but if it should be, even in a single instance, there will come such an earnest protest from myself and the representatives of the other Western Powers that there will not likely be a repetition of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The non-repeal of this law, therefore, while it is a matter of regret, is nevertheless not to be adduced as a proof that Japan is still closed to missionary effort, but only as a reason for a prudent course of procedure on the part of the missionaries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whatever the laws may have been, the Government seemed to have little fear of the missionaries, for in 1861 it sent a number of young men from Yedo to Kanagawa that they might be taught English by them.</p>
<p>While there were few opportunities for direct religious work among the Japanese, the needs of the European population were not forgotten. Services were held in the consulates or in private houses. In 1862, there was erected in Nagasaki, &ldquo;the first Protestant church ever built in Japan,&rdquo; where Mr. Williams conducted services, attended by foreign residents, and where he hoped that in time he might be able to hold meetings for Japanese, In 1863, there was organised among Americans in Kanagawa and Yokohama, the &ldquo;First Reformed Protestant Dutch Church in Japan,&rdquo; one of whose members is said to have been a Japanese,* perhaps &ldquo;Sam Patch.&rdquo; Dr. S. R. Brown became the pastor of this church, which did not long continue in existence. The same year a church building, where services were conducted by the Chaplain of the British Legation, was erected in Yokohama. The &ldquo;union services&rdquo; hitherto held were suspended for a while, but soon resumed at the American Consulate.</p>
<p>In November, 1864, occurred the first recorded baptism on Japanese soil of a Protestant Christian. Rev. J. H. Ballagh has given the following account of this person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yano Riuzan, a shaven-headed Buddhist, a <em>yabu-isha</em> or quack doctor, who held an inferior position, was selected by the Shogun&rsquo;s Council of State for a language teacher for Dr. S. R. Brown. On my arrival, November nth, 1861, he became my teacher. With him I undertook the translation of St. John, more to translate the Gospel into him than for the use of others In the summer of 1864 he became quite weak. I was impressed with a failure of duty and asked him if he would be willing for me to seek a blessing upon our translation. On his consenting, I made my first impromptu Japanese prayer, which seemed to impress him much and which made a remarkable impression on me One day, while explaining a picture of the baptism of the Ethiopian eunuch, he suddenly said to me: &lsquo;I want to be baptised: I want to be baptised because Christ commanded it.&rsquo; I warned him of the law against Christianity and the fact that, even should he escape, his son might not. The son, being consulted, said that whatever would please his father should be done On the first Sabbath in November his baptism took place in the presence of his wife, son, and daughter.&rdquo;*</p>
<p>The next baptisms were those of Murata Wakasa and Ayabe in Nagasaki, May, 1866. The story of their conversion sounds like a romance. Wakasa was born in 1815, and on reaching manhood became a minister (<em>karo)</em> of the Daimyo of Saga. He was a man of unusual stature; his grandson asserts that he was seven feet in height and therefore was obliged to have a house made specially for him, since he was so much inconvenienced by the low rooms of ordinary Japanese buildings, When, in 1855, some French and English vessels anchored in the bay of Nagasaki, Wakasa was put in charge of a patrol appointed to watch the movements of the foreign ships. One day he noticed something floating upon the water and sent one of his men to pick it up. It proved to be a book printed in some unknown language. After Wakasa&rsquo;s return to Saga, he became so curious to know what was in the book that he sent one of his retainers to Nagasaki, professedly to study medicine, but really to inquire about the contents of the book. He thus discovered that it was a Dutch translation of the New Testament, the book on which the religion of Europeans was founded* A while after, he learned that a Chinese translation of the book had been made, and he therefore sent a man to Shanghai to purchase a copy. With four other persons, one of whom was his younger brother, Ayabe, he then began an earnest study of the book. In the autumn of 1862, Ayabe went to Nagasaki to see if any of the foreigners there could explain some portions that had been difficult to understand. While there he met Dr. Verbeck, who gladly answered his questions. The following spring, Ayabe again appeared and warned Dr. Verbeck that the latter&rsquo;s life was in danger, as a company of young men had formed a conspiracy for assassinating him. In consequence of this warning, Dr. Verbeck found it advisable to withdraw with his family to China for a few months. On his return to Nagasaki he found that Ayabe had received an appointment that removed him to another part of the country; but soon after this, Wakasa sent one of his servants, named Motono, with a new set of questions. Dr. Verbeck now became, though in a roundabout way, the teacher of the little Bible-class, for Motono would frequently come from Saga, a journey occupying about two days, bringing a list of questions to which answers were desired, and after receiving Dr. Verbeck&rsquo;s explanations would return with them to Saga.</p>
<p>In May, 1866, Dr. Verbeck was informed that some high officials from the province of Hizen (in which Saga is situated) desired to come in two parties to meet him. He writes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accordingly, on the afternoon of the fifteenth of May, my visitor presented himself with a retinue of about thirty men, consisting of a number of attendant officers who quite filled my parlour, and of a greater number of common retainers, all two-sworded, who had to content themselves with an outside view of our premises. . . . My principal visitor proved to be no less a personage than a relative of the Prince of Hizen. . . . After the usual introductory compliments, the absorbing topic of the &lsquo;Doctrine&rsquo; was entered upon with a good deal of interest. I may say that I reasoned with him of &lsquo;righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come,&rsquo; but I could hardly bring him and his attendant to dwell on the higher topics of faith, hope, and love; for my august visitor insisted on reasoning concerning the unprofitable subjects of the origin of evil in the world, the mysterious permission of the continuance of evil, the justice of God or the apparent want of it under various aspects, and more of the like. I was prepared for his arguments, as I have found that on heathen ground we are often obliged to rehandle the bones of contention of the church of old, but my principal endeavour was to get him to see the wickedness and danger of all evil; that it is infinitely more important to know how to be now and forever saved from it than to know all about its origin and yet be left helpless; that it is vastly more worthy of our thought to know how we are to escape hell and gain heaven than to find out the exact location of either, if such a thing were possible. Yet my efforts to lead him to higher views at the time were vain&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The interview of the other parties was arranged to take place on the seventeenth of May. My visitors on this occasion were Wakasa, one of the ministers of state or governors of the principality of Hizen, and his younger brother Ayabe. Wakasa was a tall man, about forty-five years of age and looking older. His is one of those faces that make sunshine in a shady place, most pleasing and amiable in expression, with a very dignified bearing. His eyes beamed love and pleasure as I met him He said he had long known me in his mind, had long desired to see and converse with me, and that he was very happy that now in God&rsquo;s providence he was permitted to do so&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this time there were admitted to our parlour Wakasa, Ayabe, Wakasa&rsquo;s two sons, young men of twenty and twenty-two respectively, and the servant, Motono, who had acted the part of messenger between us for four years. How different was this meeting from that of two days before! These men. like those of Berea in the Apostles&rsquo; lime, had received the Word with all readiness of mind and did not come to puzzle themselves or me with unprofitable controversies, but asked several quite natural and sensible questions to gain additional light on some points* in reference principally to Christian character and customs. They had been taught of the Spirit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They showed great familiarity with their Bibles, made several pertinent quotations, and when during the conversation I referred them to sacred passages, they readily identified them and always accepted them as conclusive proofs. They were prepared to believe all that Jesus said and to do all that He required. It must be remembered that these men had been studying the Scriptures and reading a great variety of religious books with great diligence for at least four years, having begun to do so with a favourable disposition of mind. Like perhaps most of the higher classes in this country, they had no faith in Buddhism, the religion of the common people, while at the same time they were graciously withheld from falling into the opposite of a total atheism. Their minds were in a state of expectant transition when, just in time, they were led to search for and find salvation through faith in Christ.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We spent a delightful afternoon in conversing on the saving power and love of Christ, and just as I thought my friends were about to leave me, Wakasa took me by surprise by enquiring if I would object to baptising him and his brother Ayabe before they left town. I was surprised because so many Japanese had at different times talked to me of the great peril of becoming Christians in the full sense of the word. I had expected from these men to hear something as follows: &lsquo;We believe and would like to be baptised; but we cannot think of realising our wish in this one particular so long as the law of the land hangs the inevitable sword over the heads of all who dare to change their religion; for the present we must remain as we are, but when this cruel edict is repealed, we will come forward for baptism.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I warned my visitors not to think lightly of the act and not to entertain superstitious notions concerning its efficacy; I urged the solemn importance of the sacrament and the great obligations which devolve on those to whom it is administered; I repeated the questions which, according to our form, they would have to answer with a hearty affirmative; and finally told them to decide, as if in the presence of God who searches the heart. They listened attentively and repeated their desire to be baptised, requesting only that it should be done and kept in secret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The following Lord&rsquo;s Day, the Day of Pentecost [May 20], was chosen, the hour selected being seven o&rsquo;clock, p.m. Wakasa, whose position did not permit him to move about the streets without a half-dozen followers, and who could not visit me without making himself conspicuous, I did not see again until the appointed hour on Sunday night; but Ayabe came to me twice during the intervening days, and I gave him such instructions for himself and his brother as I thought might be useful to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last, when the Sabbath evening came, the two candidates presented themselves, attended into the room by none but Mo-tono. The retinue, consisting of eight followers, was dismissed at our door with orders to return in an hour. I bad arranged everything beforehand to avoid unnecessary detention. The shutters were closed, the lamps lit, a white cloth spread on the centre-table, a large cut-glass fruit-dish, for want of anything better, prepared to serve as a font Besides Motono, my wife was the only witness present, so that there were but five persons in the room. I began by reading Matthew twenty-eight, then dwelt on the concluding verses, spoke of the purpose of missionary societies, and referred to the bearing of the words of Jesus upon our present meeting. I exhorted them not to be discouraged in their peculiarly difficult situation, but rather, by a life of faith, of love, and of holiness, to disarm all the criticism of their neighbours and even persecution itself. We then united in prayer both in English and Japanese, proceeded with our liturgy, translating <em>ex tempore</em> the form for baptism; and after the administration of the sacrament, concluded with prayer and thanksgiving.&rdquo;*</p>
<p>On reaching home, Wakasa and Ayabe reported to their Daimyo what they had done. He left them unmolested. In some way Wakasa&rsquo;s conversion became known to the Central Government, and the Daimyo was ordered to punish him. Nothing was done, however, except to burn some of Wakasa&rsquo;s books.</p>
<p>Soon after this Dr. Verbeck removed to Tokyo, and thus had no more direct dealings with Wakasa. The latter soon retired from active life to his country villa, where he spent much of his time in translating the Bible from Chinese into Japanese. He died in 1874, with a firm faith in his Saviour.</p>
<p>Though it is in anticipation of our narrative, it may be well here to give some further intelligence of Wakasa&rsquo;s family. In 1880, Rev. Mr. Booth of Nagasaki noticed in his audience on Sunday morning two strangers, one of whom was evidently a woman of high rank. They gave close attention to his address, and their eyes often filled with tears. At the close of the service they introduced themselves, one being Wakasa&rsquo;s daughter and the other her former nurse. They had learned from Wakasa the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer and some other portions of Scripture that he had written out for them in simple characters. The daughter had married and was living in Nagasaki; but she was acquainted with no Christians there. She was about to remove with her husband to Osaka, and desired to receive baptism before going there. Therefore, she had sent to Saga for her old nurse, and they had attempted to find some Christian teacher. They at first fell in with a Roman Catholic priest, who gave them a prayer-book; but on examination, its teaching did not seem to them like that which they had before received. They were afraid to make enquiries, fearing that they would be insulted as suspected followers of Christianity. After wandering about the city for some days, they saw a shop where the characters on the covers of the books seemed familiar. On opening one volume, they found the Sermon on the Mount, and recognised its words. They purchased several books and had a long talk with the bookseller, who, as it was Saturday, told them where they could find a Christian service the next day.</p>
<p>As both asked for baptism, Mr. Booth asked their reason for desiring it. &ldquo;&lsquo;Whosever believeth and is baptised shall be saved,&rsquo;&rdquo; they quoted. When he said: &ldquo;How can I know that you are true believers?&rdquo; the younger woman replied: &ldquo;It has been my custom for years to go into my husband&rsquo;s storehouse every day for private meditation and prayer to God and the Father of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; &ldquo;How do you know that this salvation is for yon?&rdquo; &ldquo;It is written: &lsquo;Whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.&rsquo;&rdquo; After some days had been spent in instructing the women, the rite was administered. The younger woman&rsquo;s husband was present, paying close attention to the service and afterwards expressing a desire to know more about Christianity.</p>
<p>The nurse soon returned to Saga, where she resumed her work of teaching a small school for girls. She also organised a Bible-class for women, and its members soon became the teachers of a Sunday school. Though she is no longer living, the influence of her work still remains in Saga. Among the believers there was a son of Wakasa. The daughter, who removed to Osaka and later to Tokyo, became prominent in religious and philanthropic work. Her husband also became a Christian.</p>
<p>At the close of a meeting held in Tokyo about 1883, a man stepped forward and said to Dr. Verbeck: &ldquo;I am Ayabe. Since my baptism I have been in the army and also employed in surveying. During all these years I have always carried the Bible with me, and I have been accustomed to read it daily.&rdquo; The next day he came with his only daughter, about fifteen years old, asking that she be baptised. At one time he was a local preacher in the Methodist Church.</p>
<p>In the early part of the same year that saw Wakasa&rsquo;s baptism, Bishop Williams administered the same rite to a man named Shiomura. who belonged in the province of Higo. Dr. Verbeck had three other earnest requests for baptism, but did not think it best to consent In 1868, he baptised a young Buddhist priest named Shimizu. The next year this man was cast into prison because of his faith, and he suffered in various prisons for the next five years. In 1868, also, Mr. Ballagh baptised Awazu Komei; and in 1869, Mr. Thompson baptised Ogawa Yoshiyasu, Suzuki Kojiro, and an old woman, Mr. Ogawa afterwards became one of the most prominent ministers of the Church of Christ in japan (Presbyterian). In 1871, Mr. Ensor, at the Church Missionary Society&rsquo;s station in Nagasaki, baptised a man named Nimura. Thus the whole number of recorded baptisms before the spring of 1872 was ten, evenly divided between the eastern and western parts of the country.</p>
<p>In 1866, there was sent forth from Yokohama the following address:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yokohama, Japan, 14th Jan., 1860.
&ldquo;Brethren in Christ:</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;A tittle company of believers of several nationalities residing here have for the last seven days been observing the concert for prayer with you of other lands, and whilst assembled this evening to supplicate the throne of grace in behalf of this heathen nation it was unanimously resolved to appoint a committee to issue an address to God&rsquo;s people throughout the world, asking their prayers in a special manner for Japan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In order that the ground of this request may be better understood, permit us succinctly to state the circumstances in which we find ourselves here at the present time. There are now Protestant missionaries representing three or four branches of the Church of Christ in this country. Two of these are at Nagasaki and the remainder at this port. Most of these have been here since 1859, or more than six years. They see marked changes in many things since their arrival.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At first, the prejudice and suspicion of the rulers of (his country led them, for some time, frequently to send <em>posses</em> of officers to the houses of the missionaries, ostensibly as friends calling upon friends, but really as spies, to find out for what object these non-trading people had come to Japan. But for more than three years past, such domiciliary visits have entirely ceased. The first decisive symptom of the abatement of suspicions on the part of the Government was the sending of about a dozen young men of rank from Yedo to Kanagawa to be taught English by one of the missionaries. More recently the Governors of Nagasaki and this place authorised schools to be opened for a similar purpose under their auspices, and the Protestant missionaries were invited to take charge of them. One missionary at Nagasaki has, during the last year, devoted three or four hours a day to the school there. The school at Yokohama has over fifty members, and for more than two years past, three and sometimes four of the missionaries have been engaged in it, teaching an hour or two each day. A large supply of American school-books has been imported by the Governor for this school, and the teachers have in no wise been restricted as to the manner or matter of their teaching. Through the use of these foreign school-books more or less of Christian truth is almost daily brought into contact with the minds of the pupils, and has been freely made the subject of explanation and remark in classes. The effect of this is manifest in the unhesitating manner in which the pupils make enquiries and seek information on religious subjects, and in the frequent expression given to Christian facts and doctrines in their school exercise. Four years ago, when copies of a book entitled the &lsquo;Christian Reader&rsquo; were bought of a missionary by some young men who were desirous to learn English, they at once erased the word &lsquo;Christian&rsquo; from the title-page and cover, for fear that it would be noticed by others and bring them into trouble. Now a considerable number of those who have been under instruction have purchased copies of the Scriptures for their own use. In the schoolrooms and in our houses there is no reluctance to speak, and many do speak from day to day, of God, of Christ, and Christianity. The name of Jesus is no longer uttered with bated breath. Some of the wives of missionaries also have interesting classes of Japanese boys under their instruction in English, with great success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A medical missionary has a dispensary thronged with patients from day to day, where the Ten Commandments and passages of Scripture in Japanese are hung upon the walls and read by the patients.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again, the <em>Gorojiu</em> or Council of State at Yedo is now making arrangements to erect extensive buildings in that city for a school in which some hundred young men of the higher classes are to be taught in an English and a French department, and the Protestant missionaries have been requested to take charge of the former. These facts will enable you to see to what extent the Japanese have come to repose confidence in the missionaries. Meantime the members of the several missions have applied themselves to the study of Japanese, endeavouring to make their labours in this direction available to those who may come after them, by publishing works for this purpose, and a Japanese-English Dictionary containing some 40,000 words is now nearly ready for the press. Most, if not all of them, have for a good while past been at work upon the translation of the Bible, so that, by a few mouths of co-operative labour, they would be ready to publish at least the four Gospels in Japanese.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Contrary to the general expectations, it has been found that the Japanese generally do not entertain a feeling of hostility to foreigners, nor are they bigoted in religions matters. They even pride themselves upon being less stiff and more liberal in the latter respect than the Chinese. Those who belong to the class called <em>samurai</em>, who alone are eligible to civil or military office manifest much eagerness to gain a knowledge of Western languages, sciences, and arts. Some of those who have been or are now studying English are in the habit of going daily to the missionaries houses, in groups of from two to three to six or seven to read the English Bible, preferring this to the study of school-books. These intelligent young men frequently express their earnest desire that the day may soon come when all their countrymen shall have the Holy Scriptures and the free political institutions of which they are the basis. They despise the Buddhist creed and the Buddhist priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the first teachers employed by the missionaries in 1860 recently died in the assurance that he was about to be with Jesus. He had, at his own request, been baptised in his own house and in the presence of his own family, with their full consent. Thus the first fruit of the Gospel in Japan, at least in our tune, has been gathered into the garner of God.</p>
<p>Here, then, we are, in the presence of this great heathen population, estimated by themselves to number 32,000,000 and you may ask: &lsquo;What hinders the Gospel from being freely and publicly preached? This is the question that presses us at this moment urges us to ask your prayers for this people.</p>
<p>This Government is in some respects a strong one. In consequence of what occurred with the Jesuits and monks of former times it took the most stringent measures to efface the very name of Christian (Kiristan) as that of a crafty usurper from the memory of its subjects, or else to make it the symbol of whatever is dangerous and detestable. Unfortunately the Jesuits did not leave the Bible in Japan when they were banished from the country, else the condition of things here now might have borne more resemblance to that in Madagascar. But now. every man, woman, and child must be registered at some Buddhist or Shinto temple, or be denied a decent burial. Thus every Japanese is in the grasp of an iron hand, the hand of the Government There is no evidence that the old edicts against Christians have been revoked; no proclamation from the Government as yet assures the people that they would not be treated as criminals worthy of the death-penalty, should they be suspected of favouring the Christian religion. The missionary might or might not suffer from the offence of preaching, but his hearers would. Here then we hesitate, and desire to know the divine will and our duty. We would neither be cowardly nor rash. We call upon our brethren in Christ to pray that this last obstacle may be removed,—that the Treaty Powers represented in Japan may be inclined to do what Christian governments ought to do in this behalf,—that the spirit of God may move the rulers of Japan to proclaim liberty to their subjects, liberty to hear and read the word of God,—and thus that speedily these everlasting doors may be lifted up and the King of Glory may come in. May we not hope that those whom this address reaches will remember this object in their families, and closets, and meetings for prayer, and that it will be specially inserted among the subjects forming the programme for the Week of Prayer in the opening of the year 1867?&rdquo;</p>
<p>One result of this address was that great interest was aroused among supporters of the Church Missionary Society of England. One person, who withheld his name, sent to the Society a contribution of four thousand pounds to form the nucleus of a special fund for Japan, and three years after the address was issued, the Society sent out its first representative, Rev. George Ensor, who arrived at Nagasaki in January, 1869.</p>
<p>In connection with the study of English there was more willingness to read the Bible. In 1867, Mr. Ballagh spoke of furnishing twenty-four Bibles to one of his pupils, who intended to use them for a school in Yedo, where he taught the retainers of a certain daimyo. &ldquo;This pupil told me on his last visit,&rdquo; wrote Mr. Ballagh, &ldquo;that he intended to explain the Scriptures regularly every Sabbath to his prince&rsquo;s servants.&rdquo; In the same letter he says that Mr. Goble had just gone to Nagasaki &ldquo;and entered the employ of a prince, who stipulates that he shall teach Christianity.&rdquo;* Mr. Goble himself wrote:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am as busy as I can be, teaching school, editing a native paper, and doing a little at translating. I am engaged by the Prince of Tosa to lay the foundation of an English college; and in prosecution of this plan we expect to go up into the country of Tosa to live. We are getting a font of Japanese type cast, and expect soon to be able to print Bibles, tracts, books, and papers, with press and movable types. The English, Dutch, and Chinese versions of the Bible are already introduced as a reading-book in our school. Some of the pupils have of their own accord asked to be admitted to family worship, and others ask particular instruction in the Christian religion. One of the latter is a high officer of state to the Prince.&quot;†</p>
<p>On the other hand, it was a naval officer of Tosa who, in that same year (1867), published a memorial in which he expressed his grief that the religion of Jesus was being promulgated to an alarming extent in the open ports. He declared that the foreign priests were employing gold and gifts to seduce the people and make them instruments for deluding other victims. &ldquo;If we examine the fundamental principles of the religion of Jesus,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we are struck by discovering that it is entirely based upon deceit, immorality, and imposition.&rdquo; He complained that the Buddhist priests were not exerting themselves against the danger, nearly all having &ldquo;become pleasure-seekers, idle and useless beings addicted to chess-playing, reading poetry, tea-drinking, making bouquets, and given to the vices of wine and women.&rdquo; He said that as Buddhism had long been the main support of the Mikado&rsquo;s Government, &ldquo;Every one who opposes Buddha and assists the religion of Jesus is the enemy of Buddha,—that is, the enemy of his country. Let him not dwell under the canopy of heaven; let him be exterminated. Help must come soon, for the fall of Buddha is very near. The fall of the Buddhist religion is the fall of the Mikado.&rdquo;*</p>
<p>January, 1868, saw the great revolution by which political power was restored to the Emperor, and a new form of government inaugurated. In May, the American Minister received a set of official gazettes, whose publication had been commenced in Kyoto. They were numbered from one to nine, with the exception that the sixth number was lacking.† As this excited curiosity, a copy of the missing number was obtained and was found to contain the following law, which was to be posted with certain others in all the towns and villages, replacing similar laws of the Shogunate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The evil sect called Christian is strictly prohibited. Suspicious persons should be reported to the proper officers, and rewards will be given.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The foreign representatives at once remonstrated against this edict, saying that, while they had no desire to interfere with the internal affairs of Japan, they could not remain indifferent to an act that cast such odium upon the religion of the nations from which they came, the publication of such an ordinance at such a time being inconsistent with the friendly feelings professed by the new Government.</p>
<p>The Japanese ministers replied by referring to the strong feeling that the people had against Christianity because of the troubles to which it had given rise in former years. It was generally supposed, they said, that its followers practise various magical rites connected with foxes and other objects of superstitious dread. While it was impossible to prevent men from believing whatever seemed to them true, it was necessary to prevent the open profession of Christianity and the performance of its rites. If the Government failed to prohibit Christianity, it would be accused of favouring it. They acknowledged that the insertion of the word &ldquo;evil&rdquo; was ill-advised, and issued new orders saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In sending out the edict concerning Christianity there was unfortunately a mistake in the wording. This arose from the fact that in past times there had been the strict prohibition of Christianity and also of evil sects. The ordinance must at once be corrected so as to read:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The former prohibition of the Christian sect must be strictly observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Evil sects are strictly prohibited.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a Japanese writer has said, &ldquo;This was a very strange order. What was the mistake? Was it in calling Christianity an evil sect? If Christianity is not evil, why should it be prohibited?&rdquo;* The reason for the amendment not being clear, the edict in many places was left in its first form.</p>
<p>Although, as related in another volume, persecution of Roman Catholic Christians in Kyushu began about this time, there were various signs that led the missionaries in Yokohama to believe that the Government would not make serious opposition to their work. Rev. D. Thompson began to preach publicly to the patients that came to Dr. Hepburn&rsquo;s dispensary. There were usually from twenty to fifty persons present, the greater number of whom listened attentively. In 1869, a Japanese who had founded in Tokyo a school with about a hundred pupils read to them the Chinese Bible and Martin&rsquo;s &ldquo;Evidences of Christianity,&rdquo; though he himself was not a baptised Christian. He expressed a desire to have some missionary come and explain these books more perfectly than he himself could do.* During 1869, the demand for Bibles and other Christian books was very great. Many persons sought interviews with the missionaries; and the abbots of the principal temples desired to obtain copies of all books telling about Christianity. The next year, there were six or seven priests receiving instruction from Mr. Thompson, while Messrs, Cornes and Carrothers were teaching others.</p>
<p>Dr. Verbeck in his &ldquo;Historical Sketch&rdquo;† considered that the first school to deserve the name of a distinctly missionary institute was one begun in Tokyo about 1869, by Mr. and Mrs. Carrothers of the Presbyterian Mission. Among the pupils were a few girls, and as these increased in number, it was thought best to form them into a separate school. One student who was about to be left with the young men came to Mrs. Carrothers to say that she was a girl and had been wearing boy&rsquo;s clothing on account of the popular prejudice against boys and girls studying together.‡</p>
<p>Among the men who had been prominent in favouring intercourse with foreigners was Yokoi Heishiro, a trusted counsellor of the Daimyo of Echizen. Soon after Perry&rsquo;s visit to Japan, he had become a great admirer of America, and in 1866 had sent two of his nephews to the United States for education. From missionaries in Shanghai he had obtained a copy of the Bible in Chinese, and had been much impressed by its contents. He wrote to a friend: &ldquo;In a few years Christianity will come to Japan and capture the hearts of the best young men.&rdquo; He urged that men should be left free to follow whatever religion seemed to them true. At the time of the Restoration he became a counsellor of the Emperor. In February, 1869, when returning from the Palace, he was assassinated. The reason given for this act was that he was suspected of harbouring &ldquo;evil opinions,&rdquo; meaning Christianity.*</p>
<p>In April, 1869, representatives of the different clans met in a deliberative assembly. They had no legislative power, but discussed various subjects. Among others was that of the attitude to be assumed toward Christianity. At the request of some of the more liberal members, Dr. Verbeck prepared a paper in favour of religious toleration. On the other hand, a proposition that all foreigners entering the country should be required to trample upon the cross, found many and influential supporters.</p>
<p>The year 1869, saw the establishment of two new missions in Japan. The Church Missionary Society, as already mentioned, sent Rev. George Ensor and wife to Nagasaki; while Rev. D. C. Greene and wife, of the American Board, went to Tokyo (as Yedo had been re-named), whence they removed the following year to Kobe. In 1869, also, the first unmarried lady missionary came to Japan; this being Miss Mary Kidder (afterwards Mrs. E. R. Miller) of the Reformed Church. She, with Dr. and Mrs. S. R. Brown, went to Niigata, where Dr. Brown bad been invited by the Japanese Government to take charge of a boys&rsquo; school. Though the engagement was for three years, at the end of eight months Dr. Brown was recalled, the local government professing inability to pay his salary. Since another teacher was at once employed at nearly the same sum, the real reason for the change was probably because Dr. Brown on Sundays taught the Bible to those that cared to study it. Miss Kidder also returned to Yokohama, where she opened a girls&rsquo; school under the patronage of the Governor of that city. Some of the pupils were transferred from a class for boys and girls that Mrs. Hepburn had taught since 1867. The school may be considered the foundation of the &ldquo;Isaac Ferris Seminary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Ensor had been but a month in Nagasaki when, as he wrote:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Day by day, hour after hour, my house would be thronged with Japanese visitors, all curious to know something about England and her science and art and progress, but, most of all, about her religion. They knew that she was a power among the nations, and believed that religion and power in a state are inseparable. More serious enquirers would wait till the darkness of night, and then steal into my house; and we used to have the doors closed and the windows barred, and as I bade them farewell when they left I scarce ever expected to see them again, for I was informed that an officer had been specially appointed to keep watch at my gate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some nine months later, Mr. Ensor saw hundreds of Roman Catholics being driven by his house on their way to exile. He says that one night when in an almost despairing frame of mind because of the opposition that was being shown towards Christianity:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was sitting by myself in my study and heard in the darkness a knock at the door. I went myself to answer it, and standing between the palm-trees of my gate, I saw the dark figure of an armed Japanese. He paused a moment, and I beckoned him to enter: and he came in and sat down, and I asked him what his business was. He replied: &lsquo;A few days ago I had a copy of the Bible in my hands, and I wish to be a Christian.&rsquo; I said: &lsquo;Are you a stranger in these parts? Don&rsquo;t you know that thousands of your people are being detained as prisoners for this?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I know. Last night I came to your gate and as I stood there thinking of the terrible step I was about to take, fear overpowered me and I returned. But there stood by me in the night one who came to me in my dreams and said I was to go to the house of the missionary, and nothing would happen to me, and I have come,&rsquo; And drawing his long sword, he held it up to me in a form signifying the Japanese oath, and promised that he would ever keep true to me, and I received him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This man was afterwards baptised by the name of Titus; &ldquo;for God,&rdquo; says Mr. Ensor, &ldquo;who comforteth those who are cast down, comforted me by the coming of Titus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though the persecutions inaugurated by the Imperial Government were directed chiefly against the Roman Catholics, persons who were becoming interested in the teaching of the Protestant missionaries were not free from danger. In Nagasaki a young man named Futagawa Ito* had feigned an interest in Christianity with the design of assassinating Mr. Ensor, from whom he requested instruction. The story of Christ&rsquo;s love made so deep an impression upon him that he soon came to believe what he had once hated. He became Mr. Ensor&rsquo;s assistant, and in 1870 was helping in the printing of a tract, when he suddenly disappeared. He had been arrested on a nominal charge of having transgressed a regulation concerning the wearing of swords; but in reality because of his connection with Christianity, as was evident from the fact that he was offered his liberty if he would renounce that religion. After a while he was sent to his native province. About his neck was fastened an iron collar to which were attached five chains. These were used to secure him in his celt, and on the road each chain was held by a soldier. On his arrival at his native village his relatives were in great distress at thought of the horrible crime he had committed. His mother for several days refused to eat any food. His sister, who had been married to a priest, was divorced. The villagers came to gaze at him through the openings of the cage in which he was confined, and to talk about the way in which he ought to be punished. After some time spent in the prison of the prefectural capital, he was taken to Tokyo. Throughout the journey he was confined in a small <em>hago,</em> which was something like a box carried by poles that rested on the shoulders of coolies. There was not room in it for him to lie down, and the top was so low that he could not sit upright. Food was given to him through a small opening in the side of the box. Only once was he allowed to get out from his narrow cell. This was at Osaka, where he was permitted to take a bath; but all the time his chains were held by five men, who also had drawn swords to cut him down if any attempt was made to escape. Mr. Ensor, who on account of ill health had been obliged to return to England before anything had been learned about Futagawa, tells us that after a while,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like Joseph, he found favour in the sight of the keeper of the gaol, and by-and-by, though still a prisoner himself, he was set over the other prisoners and made the keeper of the dungeon. He began to speak to those around him of the Saviour for whose sake he was bound and incarcerated. The magistrates as well as the prisoners listened to him, and treated him with great kindness; so, like St. Paul at Rome, he preached Christ from his prison, and there were between seven and eight hundred men who heard from him the Gospel, and out of these not fewer than seventy or eighty began themselves to study the Word of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The American Minister finally secured the prisoner&rsquo;s release. The officials at first made some objection to the removal of the iron collar; but the eminent scholar, Fukuzawa Yukichi, always fertile in expedients, brought a physician, who ordered its removal for the sake of health.</p>
<p>In 1870, or early in 1871, officials broke up Bible classes in Tokyo. On the night of June 30, 1871, Ishikawa Einosuke, Rev. O. H. Gulick&rsquo;s teacher, was arrested in Kobe. In his house were found manuscript copies of Dr. Hepburn&rsquo;s translation of Mark&rsquo;s Gospel, and these were seized as proofs of his guilt. His wife, though not accused of being a Christian, was also arrested because she had not informed the authorities about her husband&rsquo;s evil-doing. The United States Consul demanded the release of Mr. Ishikawa on the ground of an agreement between the Governor and himself that notice should be given to the Consul before any servant of a United States citizen should be arrested. The Governor, however, replied that, since the teacher did not live on Mr. Gulick&rsquo;s premises, the agreement did not cover his case. It was afterwards learned that the arrest had been made by orders of the secret police of the Imperial Government. When the missionaries endeavoured to find out what could be done for the prisoner, the Governor of Kobe assured them that if he had received baptism he would certainly be put to death; otherwise, his life would be spared, Mr. and Mrs. Ishikawa were for some time imprisoned in Kyoto, where he died in November, 1872. The wife was afterwards released. She testified that her husband died with a firm faith in Jesus Christ. A gentleman, who appeared to be an official, called upon Rev, D. C. Greene soon after the above arrest, and in the midst of the conversation remarked as though incidentally: &ldquo;If your teacher, sitting here, should attend a Christian service, he would be liable to arrest.&rdquo; Mr, Greene&rsquo;s servants no longer dared to attend as formerly the morning prayers that he had conducted with them.</p>
<p>In the early part of 1871, Mr. W. E. Griffis (who afterwards wrote many well-known books upon Japan) went to Fukui as a teacher of English; and in the latter part of the same year Mr, E. W. Clark went in the same capacity to Shizuoka. Both of these gentlemen found opportunities for doing Christian work while in these interior cities. The contract that Mr. Clark was asked to sign did, indeed, contain a clause forbidding him to say anything about Christianity. &ldquo;It was a great dilemma,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;for I had spent all my money in coming to Japan and getting ready to go into the interior.&rdquo; Some of his friends urged him to accept the condition, and the Japanese interpreter advised him to sign the agreement and then disregard it. He felt that a principle was at stake and stood firm, saying that unless the clause was struck out he must refuse to go. &ldquo;It is impossible,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;for a Christian to dwell three years in the midst of a pagan people and yet keep silence on the subject nearest his heart.&rdquo; His firmness triumphed, and the clause was struck out. He began a Bible class the very first Sunday he was in Shizuoka, and kept it up all the time he was there.</p>
<p>The first representatives of the Woman&rsquo;s Union Missionary Society reached Yokohama in 1871, and there opened a school for girls.</p>
<p>Near the close of 1871, while the persecutions were still being directed against the Roman Catholics, a remarkable pamphlet was published by Mr. Nakamura Masanao. one of the best known teachers of Chinese in the country. It was written as though by a foreigner who, having spent some time in Japan, ventured to send a memorial to the Emperor. The writer begins by praising the liberal spirit shown by His Majesty&rsquo;s Government in adopting various things that have come from foreign lands, but expresses regret that it still adhered to its severe laws against Christianity. His Majesty did not seem to be aware that the secret of the wealth and power of Western nations was in their religion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The industry, patience, and perseverance displayed in their arts, inventions, and machinery, all have their origin in the faith, hope, and charity of their religion. In general we may say that the condition of Western countries is but the outward leaf and blossom of their religion, and religion is the root and foundation on which their prosperity depends. Now Your Majesty&rsquo;s subjects, pleased with the branches and foliage, wish to make them all their own; and try to imitate them. This is more ridiculous than the mimicry of apes, and it seems to me that it is a delusion to reject the very cause of the prosperity of these nations. When the heart and will are wrong, the words and conduct are also wrong; and when the root of a tree is bad, the branches and leaves are also bad. Does Your Majesty judge the Western religion to be evil? Then the Western nations must themselves be evil. And if those nations are corrupt, then their charitable and brave men are bad men, and the wonderful arts and inventions of those countries must be bad. So, too, all industry, patience, and vigour must likewise be evil. In that case the new laws which Your Majesty has introduced must be bad. The teachers employed in the schools for foreign learning are also bad men. The merchants from foreign lands who are permitted to trade in Japan are bad merchants. The telegraphs, steam-vessels, and steam-engines, and all such conveniences are bad things. Why does not Your Majesty command them all to be destroyed, the bad teachers to be expelled from the country, the bad merchants to be put to death, and the bad laws to be repealed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The writer goes on to say that Japan will be despised by Western nations so long as it exhibits such unreasonable hatred of Christianity; and declares that Japan cannot make due progress without accepting that religion. He says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So long as Your Majesty does not repeal the prohibitory laws against Christianity, however assiduously the nation may endeavour to acquire the arts and civil reforms of Europe, it can&rdquo; never attain to the true European civilisation; and Japan may be likened to a manikin with face and eyes, and hands and feet, but without a soul. Can the manikin vie with a living man in the civilities of social intercourse? If Your Majesty should at last desire to establish Christianity in Japan, he should first of all be baptised himself, and become the chief of the church, and be called the leader of the millions of his people. Should Your Majesty come to such a decision, how great will be the respect and love accorded to him by the sovereigns of Europe from that time forward! How the people of the Western countries will pray for his happiness!. . . The praises of Japan will ascend to the heaven, and the voice of her admiration will reach to the uttermost parts of the earth.&rdquo;*</p>
<p>During the closing week of 1871, the missionaries in Yokohama united with several English-speaking residents in a series of prayer-meetings. These were continued through the Week of Prayer in January of the next year. Dr. Verbeck in writing of them says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some Japanese students connected with the private classes taught by the missionaries were present through curiosity or through a desire to please their teachers, and some perhaps from a true interest in Christianity. It was concluded to read the Acts in course day after day; and that the Japanese present might take part intelligently in the service, the Scripture of the day was translated extemporaneously into their language. The meetings grew in interest and were continued from week to week until the end of February. After a week or two the Japanese, for the first time in the history of the nation, were on their knees in a Christian prayer-meeting, entreating God with great emotion, with the tears streaming down their faces, that He would give His Spirit to Japan as to the early church and to the people around the Apostles. These prayers were characterised by intense earnestness. Captains of men-of-war, English and American, who witnessed the scene, wrote to us: &lsquo;The prayers of these Japanese take the heart out of us.&rsquo; A missionary wrote that the intensity of feeling was such that he feared often that he would faint away in the meetings. Half a dozen perhaps of the Japanese thus publicly engaged in prayer; but the number present was much larger. This is the record of the first Japanese prayer-meeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a direct fruit of these prayer-meetings, the first Japanese Christian church was organised at Yokohama on March 10th, 1872. It consisted of nine young men who were baptised on that day and two middle-aged men who had been previously baptised: viz., Ogawa, by the Rev. David Thompson of the American Presbyterian Mission at Yokohama, and Nimura, by the Rev. Geo. Ensor of the Church Mission at Nagasaki. Some of these nine young men had previously received special instruction from the Rev. J. H. Ballagh of the Reformed Church at Yokohama. Mr. Ballagh, too, assisted by Mr. Ogawa and other brethren, was chiefly instrumental, under the divine blessing, in bringing about the organisation of this church. Mr, Ogawa was chosen an elder and Mr. Nimura a deacon of the young church. The members gave their church the catholic name of &lsquo;The Church of Christ in Japan,&rsquo; and drew up their own church constitution, a simple evangelical creed, together with some rules of church government, according to which the government was to be in the hands of the pastor and elders, with the consent of the members.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The substance of the first of these rules was: &ldquo;Our church is not partial to any sect, believing only in the name of Christ in whom all are one, and believing that all who take the Bible as their guide, diligently studying it, are Christ&rsquo;s servants and our brothers. For this reason all believers on earth belong to Christ&rsquo;s family of brotherly love.&rdquo; Mr. Ballagh acted as the first pastor of this church. Several of the young men who were baptised had been students of English under Dr. S. R. Brown. They had separately asked for baptism, not being aware that the others were ready for such a decisive step. Each supposed that he would meet with opposition from his associates, and at a preliminary meeting was surprised to find the others present. On returning to their room they were so filled with joy that they spent two hours in singing over and over, the hymn, Jesus Loves Me,&rdquo; almost the only one that they then knew.</p>
<p>In connection with an industrial exhibition held at Kyoto in 1872, special passports were issued to foreigners permitting them to visit the city. Among several members of the American Board&rsquo;s Mission who availed themselves of this privilege was Rev. O. H. Gulick, He was able to hire a house for his residence during the exhibition, and hoped that he might make an engagement with the government for teaching, or might in some other way get permission for remaining in the city. He and some of his associates had interviews with the Governor and other officials. J. C. Berry, M.D., who had just joined the Mission, was invited by some of the physicians of Kyoto to settle there, and was promised a house free of rent. The time had not yet come, however, for missionaries to begin work in the old capital. A contract by which Mr. Gulick promised to teach English gratuitously for a certain company would have been approved by the Government had he not struck out a clause that prohibited the mention of Christianity, In the amended form it was rejected. Afterwards an officer of the Kyoto police, who had helped him to rent a house and in other ways befriended him, was arrested and imprisoned for one hundred and forty days on the charge of helping in an attempt to introduce Christianity into Kyoto.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1872, the American Board missionaries opened a school in Kobe. In addition to instruction in English and the sciences, the English Bible was taught for an hour each day by Mr. Greene, who on Sundays also had an attentive Bible class of twelve pupils. A similar school, with teaching of the Bible, was opened in Osaka by the American Board Mission, and another by the American Episcopal Mission, In Nagasaki was a school of the American Reformed Mission where the Bible was the chief text-book. The school in Kobe was established at the request of some young men who paid all the expenses, and it was so prosperous that at one time it numbered one hundred pupils.</p>
<p>A convention of missionaries was held in Yokohama September 20-25, 1872. Most of those connected with the Presbyterian, Reformed, and American Board missions, were in attendance. Neither the American Episcopal Mission nor that of the Church Missionary Society thought it best to send delegates; but Rev. Mr. Syle, acting chaplain of the English Consulate at Yokohama, and Rev. Mr. Nelson of the American Episcopal Mission in Shanghai, sat with the convention; as did Captain (afterwards Admiral) Watson of the United States Navy, Dr. W. St. G. Elliott, and Mr. W. E. Griffis (the last three being elders in Union churches that had been formed by foreigners residing in Yokohama and Tokyo), and also the elder of the Japanese church that had recently been formed in Yokohama. Father Nicolai of the Russo-Greek Church, was invited, but did not attend. The chief business of the convention was to arrange for a translation of the Scriptures. It was decided that the work should be entrusted to a committee consisting of one member from each mission desirous of co-operating. The American Protestant Episcopal Mission, the English Church Mission, and Father Nicolai, were invited to assist in the work. Resolutions were passed upon the importance of educating a native ministry, and upon providing for the publication of Christian literature. The following resolution concerning the organisation of the Japanese churches was adopted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whereas the Church of Christ is one in Him and the diversities among Protestants are but accidents which, though not affecting the vital unity of believers, do obscure the oneness of the Church in Christendom, and much more in pagan lands where the history of the divisions cannot be understood; and whereas we, as Protestant missionaries, desire to secure uniformity in our modes and methods of evangelisation, so as to avoid as far as possible the evil arising from marked differences, we therefore take this earliest opportunity afforded by the Convention to agree that we will use our influence to secure, as far as possible, identity of name and organisation in the native churches in the formation of which we may be called to assist, that name being as catholic as the Church of Christ; and the organisation being that wherein the government of each church shall be by the ministry and eldership of the same, with the concurrence of the brethren.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In November, 1872, Dr. Hepburn obtained, through Mr. De Long, the American Minister, permission to present to the Emperor a copy of the English Bible, and also one of his Japanese-English Dictionary. The receipt is said to have been acknowledged by the Emperor in an autograph letter.* Mr. De Long was afterwards censured by the United States Secretary of State for his part in the transaction, which was held to be a violation in some way of a rule of the State Department. In a semi-public letter Mr. De Long wrote:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A rumour has obtained that I was reproved because I did not make the presentation in a customary diplomatic manner. This is a mistake. No objection was made to the course I followed; none could be taken, as I first enquired of the Minister for Foreign Affairs if such a present would be received and would be acceptable to his Sovereign, and only after being assured that it would, did I present it, and then not directly to His Majesty but to him through his Minister, which was a proper diplomatic course of action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Near the close of the year 1871, an embassy headed by Prince Iwakura had set forth to visit the United States and Europe. Its chief object was to secure such a revision of the treaties as would do away with extraterritoriality. In the letter of credence presented by Iwakura to the President of the United States, the Emperor declared: &ldquo;We expect and intend to reform and improve&rdquo; the treaties &ldquo;so as to stand upon a similar footing with the most enlightened nations, and to attain the full development of public right and interest.&rdquo; The American Secretary of State said that before permitting citizens of the United States to come under the jurisdiction of Japan it would be necessary to consider the laws of that country, and he proceeded to ask about religious liberty and the edicts against Christianity. The Japanese Ambassador attempted to make it appear that the edicts were no longer enforced. Mr. De Long was then in Washington, and when Prince Iwakura denied in his conference with the Secretary of State that there was any religious persecution, Mr. De Long cited the facts connected with the arrest and continued imprisonment of Ishikawa Einosuke. The Ambassador, who could make no satisfactory reply, was told that it was useless to ask for the desired change in the treaty so long as the religion believed by most Americans was regarded in the present manner. On going to Europe the Embassy found that it was not without reason that the British and French Chargés d&rsquo;Affaires had expressed the opinion that it would not be cordially received so long as the persecution of Christians continued. Before it reached England an influential deputation from the Evangelical Alliance had presented to the Foreign Secretary a memorial in which the persecutions of the Roman Catholic Christians were narrated, and the hope expressed that, in case the treaties were revised, a clause would be inserted guaranteeing religious liberty. The <em>Westminster Gazette</em> had opened a subscription for funds to support a movement that should urge the English Government to demand the release of the Japanese exiles. A vigorous agitation was begun in France by the publication of M. Léon Pagés&rsquo;s pamphlet on &ldquo;The Persecution of the Japanese Christians.&rdquo; As the Embassy rode through the streets of Brussels, many among the spectators shouted out their demands that the Japanese Christians be released. Ito Hirobumi (afterwards Japan&rsquo;s leading statesman), who was a member of the Embassy, wrote to his Government, declaring that wherever he went he was met by the strongest appeals in behalf of the Christian exiles and for religious toleration, He was sure that, unless the Government acceded to the first request and evinced a disposition to be somewhat liberal in the other matter, it would look in vain for friendly concessions on the part of the foreign nations.</p>
<p>In November, 1872, Mori Arinori, who was in Washington as the Japanese Chargé d&rsquo;Affaires, prepared a memorial to his Government in favour of complete religious freedom. Annexed to it was a draft for &ldquo;The Religious Charter of the Empire of Dai Niphon&rdquo; (Japan). This, as given in the English version, was as follows:—</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whereas, in matters of conscience and religious faith, it has been justly observed that the manner of exercising them can be properly determined only by reason and conviction, not by force or violence, and</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whereas, no man or society of men has any right to impose his or its opinions or interpretations on any other in matters of religion, since every man must be responsible for himself, and</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whereas, we have no other purpose than that of avoiding for our nation the misery which the experience of the world shows has followed the patronage by the state of any particular religion;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is now solemnly resolved and declared that the Imperial Government of Dai Niphon will make no law prohibiting, either directly or indirectly, the free exercise of conscience or religious liberty within its dominions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it is further solemnly resolved and declared that the organisation of any religious orders shall not be interfered with by either local or national authority, so long as such organisation does not conflict with the law of the State.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it is further solemnly resolved and declared that the law of the Empire shall recognise no religious institution as special or different from any other kind of social institution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it is further solemnly resolved and declared that no special privilege or favour shall be granted by either local or national authority to any particular sect or religious denomination without extending the same at once to every other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it is further solemnly resolved and declared that no religious or ecclesiastical title or rank shall be conferred by the state upon any person belonging to any religious association.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it is further, in conclusion, solemnly resolved and declared that no action which may promote religious: animosity shall be permitted within the realm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this, as in many other propositions made by Mr. Mori to his Government, he was too far in advance of his times. Not until the proclamation of the new Constitution, February II, 1889, was religious liberty assured to the people of Japan; and on that very day, Mr. Mori, the advocate of such liberty, was assassinated by a Shinto fanatic for having, as was alleged, raised the curtain of the shrine at Ise with his walking-stick.</p>
<p>Though the guaranty of religious freedom did not come until 1889, the Government on February 19, 1873, ordered the removal of the edict-boards which, among other regulations, prohibited Christianity. At first it was supposed that this action implied open toleration. It was indeed feared by some missionaries that the Government might, for reasons of state, go too far in favouring Christianity, it being known that the Embassy while in Berlin, had consulted with a German professor of jurisprudence, concerning the expediency of adopting it as a state religion.* To those unacquainted with the Japan of that day it may seem that such action could not have been seriously contemplated; but there were several reasons that might lead the officials to favour it. They were anxious to have Japan recognised as on an equality with Western nations, and those who were in Europe saw that the difference in religion added greatly to the difficulty of accomplishing their purpose. It would, at least, be necessary to allow Christianity to be preached to the people, many of whom would be likely to accept it; and the Government wished to retain the leadership in all new movements. Buddhism was disliked by many of those in power; and it was about this time that many native scholars and even Shinto officials were saying: &ldquo;Shinto is not a religion; it is a system of government regulations, very good to keep alive patriotism among the people.&rdquo;* Already the Council of the Shinto Gods, which previously ranked with the Great Council of Government, had been replaced by a Religious Department, lower in rank, whose duties were not confined to matters connected with Shinto. Thus, it will be seen that many of those in power, accustomed as they were to consider religion an instrument to be used by the Government for its own ends, had no such strong feelings in favour of other religions as would make them oppose the State&rsquo;s adoption of Christianity, if thereby any political advantage could be gained. It is certain that more than once in later times influential men seriously advocated that Christianity be made a state religion.</p>
<p>Probably individual members of the Government differed concerning the advisability of removing the laws against Christianity; and there was fear that serious opposition might be manifested by the people. Accordingly a notice was issued stating that the edicts, which included laws against murder, arson, robbery, etc., as well as that against Christianity, had been taken down &ldquo;because the people are so thoroughly acquainted with them and know them by heart.&rdquo; Notwithstanding this explanation, the Buddhist priests in some places instigated riots among the peasants in opposition to the removal of the boards.</p>
<p>In recent years it has been asserted that the action of the Japanese Government in removing the edicts was wholly due to its own liberal spirit, and not to any representations sent back from Western countries by the Embassy. It may be well to compare this assertion with what was said at the time, as reported by Mr. De Long, the United States Minister, in a letter addressed to Rev. J. Goble, in November, 1873.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Relative to the repeal of the edicts against Christianity or their supposed repeal, the truth is this:—The edicts were taken down and removed from public observance by order of this Government, but were not repealed. On the contrary, when they were removed, officers of the Government detailed for this express purpose called on all of the Japanese residents and warned them that, although the edicts had been taken down, they still remained ill force and must be obeyed as laws. When this action came to my knowledge, I taxed one of the Assistant Ministers for Foreign Affairs with bad faith. He in reply entreated me to not so consider it. at the same time saying: &lsquo;The liberal party in Japan is yet in its infancy, but I assure you it is increasing rapidly. We have been able to secure two triumphs—one the return of the exiled Christian converts, the other the removal of the edicts.&rsquo; These matters, he assured me, had been attained mainly upon the strength of advices received from one of the Ambassadors, Governor Ito, who in a communication addressed to his Government, written from Europe, had advised them that wherever he went he was met by the strongest appeals in behalf of these exiles and for religious toleration; and he felt assured that, unless his Government acceded to the first request and evinced a disposition to be somewhat liberal as to the other matter, it might look in vain for friendly concessions on the part of foreign powers in treaty with Japan, He farther assured me of the disposition of his party and of himself to go much farther at once, but that it was deemed unsafe to do so as yet, as undue haste might ruin all. Placing full faith in these representations, I consented to let matters rest for a season and wait a more favourable opportunity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This statement proves that no particular man or government is entitled to the credit of having obtained these results. They are the fruit of the earnest labour of Foreign Representatives at this Court, Christian missionaries in this Empire, and Christian statesmen and gentlemen abroad who had access to the Embassy and improved the opportunity they enjoyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the first period of missionary effort a beginning had been made towards providing a Christian literature. Reference has already been made to some of the works that were published. It will be convenient here to give a more detailed account; and since the translation of the Bible is one of the first things to take the attention of Protestant missionaries, we will consider what had been accomplished in this direction up to the close of the year 1872.*</p>
<p>So far as known, the first work of this kind was that of Dr. Gutzlaff, who, with the help of the shipwrecked Japanese that found shelter in his house at Macao, made a translation of the Gospel of John. By the aid of the American Bible Society this was printed about 1838, on the press of the American Board at Singapore. When the circumstances of its production are considered, it is not strange that it was very imperfect and abounded with errors.</p>
<p>Dr. S, Wells Williams also attempted by the help of shipwrecked sailors to make translations. The results appear not to have been published.</p>
<p>Dr. Bettelheim, while in Loochoo, prepared a translation of the New Testament in the dialect he found in those islands. The Gospel of Luke was printed at Hongkong. Afterwards Dr. Bettelheim, while in Chicago, obtained the assistance of a Japanese for bringing his translation more into conformity with the language used in Japan proper. This revision of the Four Gospels and Acts was printed at Vienna in 1872, and many copies were sent to Japan.</p>
<p>The Protestant missionaries in Nagasaki made early attempts at translation.</p>
<p>Dr. Hepburn states that when he undertook this kind of work in 1861, the prejudices against Christianity, and the fear of the Government were so great that his teacher, after proceeding a little way in the Gospel of Matthew, positively declined to remain in his service. In 1866, the <em>Christian Intelligencer</em> of America, said, concerning the work of missionaries of the Reformed Board: &ldquo;The Gospels are translated. The money is ready to print an edition. . . . Shall we print the Gospel? The missionaries hesitate, fearing bloodshed. For, by the laws of Japan, whoever may be converted by reading the Word of God may be put to death with all his family.&rdquo; Reference is probably made here to the translations prepared by Dr. S. R. Brown; and the question of their publication was settled in 1867, when his manuscripts were all destroyed by fire.</p>
<p>Finally, in 1871, Mr. Goble had an edition of the Gospel of Matthew printed from wooden blocks. He said of this: &ldquo;I tried in Yokohama to get the blocks cut for printing, but all seemed afraid to undertake it, and I was only able to get it done in Tokyo by a man who, I think, did not know the nature of the book he was working upon.&rdquo; The next year, Drs. Hepburn and Brown published Mark and John. Their translation of Matthew was issued in 1873.</p>
<p>The first tract was published by Dr. Hepburn in 1864. Shortly before it appeared, he wrote:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am now publishing a Christian tract. The block-cutter is at work on it and will probably finish it in a month. It is one of Dr. McCartee&rsquo;s [of China] tracts, which my teacher with my supervision has translated into what appears to me to be very-good Japanese. It is the tract &lsquo;The True Doctrine Made Plain or Easy&hellip;&rsquo; I have to be very secret in getting the blocks cut. No doubt, if the officers of the Government knew it, they would soon put a stop to it. Most providentially, as it seems, the man who is cutting the blocks is employed by one of our merchants and lives in bis compound; and that merchant, strange to say, is a Jew, but a most liberal one; indeed, [think he is much more of a Christian than a Jew,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another early tract prepared by Dr. Hepburn consisted of the Ten Commandments, the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, and the Apostles&rsquo; Creed.</p>
<p>One difficulty attending the preparation of tracts for the common people is described by &ldquo;Rev. J. D. Davis, D.D., and may be inserted here, although what it narrates occurred in the first year of the next period of our history. Dr. Davis says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the summer of 1873, the writer sat under the maples by the waterfall in Arima, the only missionary in the place, and wrote in <em>Romaji</em> [Roman letters] in his broken Japanese the first draft of a little tract. Two months later, when his teacher had copied this into Japanese, he asked him to revise it, and it came back in such high Chinese that none of the common people could read it. He then asked a scholar of the pure Japanese language to put it into such language that the masses could read it, and after another month it came back about fifty degrees higher yet. The writer then took his original draft and sat down-with his teacher and fought it over word by word and sentence by sentence, demanding that the words which could be understood by the greatest number of the common people should be used; and after two months more it was ready for the block-cutter; but his teacher begged of the writer not to let any one know who helped in the preparation of it, as he would be ashamed to have it known that he prepared so colloquial a book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In other ways the printed page was the medium for teaching Christian truth. Students of English found in their reading-books frequent references to religious doctrines. English books on ethics were for a while diligently studied in the government schools. One who was a teacher in these schools has written of this time:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every class of students able to read a foreign language, from the highest to the lowest, was supplied with text-books on morals, and the use of them continued during several months. Suddenly an order from the Dai Jo Kwan (the Emperor&rsquo;s Privy Council) to discontinue the study arrived in the various schools, this study was banished from the curriculum, and the manuals of Wayland, Haven, and Malebranche were exiled to the dust and oblivion of the top shelf. Text-books on morals made by Christian writers were supposed to be too strongly flavoured with Christian theology, and the name so long publicly outlawed and hated in this Empire occurred too often on their pages to render it safe to allow such books in the hands of Japanese youth. A noted native educator. . . had &rsquo;translated&rsquo; Wayland&rsquo;s &lsquo;Moral Science&rsquo;&hellip; This &rsquo;translation,&rsquo; however, is but a fragment. It omits all the positively Christian theology of the book, much of the theory and reasoning, and gives scarcely more than the results arrived at by the author and a portion of the moral code which is expressed in the book. Those high officers who read only the translation and were pleased with it, sanctioned the use of the various moral text-books of foreign countries, not knowing their full contents. On discovering their true nature, however, the order to discontinue the study of these books was sudden and peremptory. . . . A few weeks later came an order prohibiting all students in the government schools from attending or visiting a Christian church.&rdquo;*</p>
<p>The first attempts at Christian hymnology were probably the translations of &ldquo;There is a Happy Land,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Jesus Loves Me.&rdquo; The first version of the former was made by Mr. Goble. The imperfect knowledge of the language led to the production of verses that have since been a source of merriment. The first stanza commenced,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Yoi kuni arimas<br>
Taiso empo.&gt; Shinja wa sakaete<br>
Hikari zo.&rdquo;
Apparently several persons attempted the translation of &ldquo;Jesus Loves Me.&rdquo; These two hymns, so far as is known, were the only ones produced before 1873.*</p></blockquote>

<p>* This society seems for some reason to have afforded only a scanty support to Mr. Goble. In a memorial of his wife he says that, being detained two months in San Francisco, &ldquo;the young missionaries were only saved from penury by working with their own hands to supply their daily wants. . . . They lived first in Kanagawa for two years, during which time they were in deep poverty, much in debt, mending shoes to get a little food, the husband and father watching five weeks, night and day without cessation, at the sick-bed of his apparently dying wife, whose illness was brought on by poor diet and living in a miserable little native house.&rdquo; They returned to America, where they received appointment from the Baptist Missionary Union and were sent to Japan in company with Dr. Nathan Brown; but these relations were soon severed and Mr. Goble became an independent missionary. He remained in Japan until after the death in May, 1882, of Mrs. Goble. Going to America, he died there in May, 1898. Mr. Goble early translated the Gospel of Matthew into colloquial Japanese. At one time he was in the employ of the American Bible Society and adopted methods by which the sales of the Scriptures were greatly increased. He was the inventor of the <em>jinrikisha.</em> His wife being in poor health, he wished to obtain some means of conveyance for her. In talking over the matter with, a Japanese carpenter, it was decided to make a wheeled vehicle. Mr. Goble found on the cover of a <em>Godey&rsquo;s Lady&rsquo;s Book</em> an advertisement of baby-carriages. With some changes, the pictures furnished the model for the first <em>jinrikisha,</em> which, though not so light and handsome as those of later days, answered its purpose. The <em>jinrikisha</em> has been claimed as a purely Japanese invention, but those first made showed plainly that they were an adaptation of a Western vehicle.</p>

<p>* An interesting sequel to this account of Yokoi is given in Dr, A. D. Hail&rsquo;s &ldquo;Japan and Its Rescue.&rdquo; Years after the assassination, a prayer-meeting was being held in the town of Shingu preparatory to the coming observance of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper. A lumberman who had come from a place forty miles distant among the mountains said, after several had confessed their sins; * I, too, have a confession to make. Before I became a Christian I used to be intensely angry towards any one who was even suspected of being a Christian. Having heard that a prominent man in Japan had some English books in bis possession and a Chinese Bible, I felt that he must be a believer in Christianity. Many others, also, thought as I did. Twenty-four of us accordingly covenanted together to kill this man. We watched our opportunity, and having heard that he had come to Kyoto, we divided ourselves into squads of six and placed one squad in each road along one of which we knew he must leave the palace. I was not in the squad which slew him. When we heard, however, that the deed had been accomplished and that two of the attacking party had also been killed, we all separated and ran away. I never knew what became of the various members of the band of twenty-four. A neighbour of mine and I went to the place where we now live and have been there ever since. Now, according to the rules of Old Japan (pointing to the Christian worker that accompanied Dr. Hail), it would be that brother&rsquo;s duty to take my life, as he is a nephew and so a very near relative of the murdered man. It was before I knew Christ that I could contemplate such an act. I believe God has forgiven me, and I ask forgiveness of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat down weeping, and there was a time of general and deep feeling. The nephew then said: &ldquo;I know that according to our old ideas I should be regarded as unfaithful and unfilial if I did not attempt at all hazards to take the life of the brother who has just spoken. But I know that what he did was done in ignorance of Christ and His Gospel. I, too, have been a great sinner; but have obtained mercy and am taught to forgive as I would be forgiven, and through Christ&rsquo;s grace I forgive.&rdquo; The next day these two sat down together, with all the brethren, at the communion table.</p>
