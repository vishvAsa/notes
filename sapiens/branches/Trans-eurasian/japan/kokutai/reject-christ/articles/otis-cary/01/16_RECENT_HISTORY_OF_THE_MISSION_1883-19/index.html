  <p>MATERIALS for writing the later history of the Greek Church in Japan are not such as can be utilised to any great extent in the present work. The news columns of the periodicals that it publishes will be of great value to its own historian, but the facts recorded need to be collated by some one so intimately acquainted with the inner working of the Church that he can select those that have proved to be of the most importance. It is to be hoped that the excellent history (in Japanese) whose earlier volumes have helped in the preparation of former chapters will ere long be brought down to a later date.</p>
<p>In a general way it may be said that, while the Orthodox Church continued to grow in numbers and strength, its rapid progress was checked a little earlier than was the case with Protestantism. Bishop Nicolai continued to be a marvel of executive ability and personal influence; the evangelists were active and earnest; in many places they gathered companies of believers; and yet, with the exception of northeastern Hondo, the degree of success attained was not such as attracted much notice from people at large. Persons that became interested in Christianity were inclined to examine it in its Protestant forms. The relations of the Orthodox Church to the Russian Government doubtless had much to do with this. Suspicion of Russia&rsquo;s movements and of what it might be planning to do in Korea made the former country and everything connected with it unpopular with the young men of Japan. This feeling was greatly increased at the close of the Chino-Japanese War (1895) when Russia took the lead in preventing Japan from retaining any territory on the Asiatic continent and soon after took for its own use the Laiotung Peninsula, which had been Japan&rsquo;s most important conquest in the war. The following statement prepared in 1903, by one of Bishop Nicolai&rsquo;s assistants, shows what response was made to the objection that came from the prejudice felt against Russia:</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the present political situation of Japan and Russia, since the Japanese Orthodox Church is aided by the Russian Missionary Society, some are led to believe that the Church is necessarily Russianised and given to Russian forms. This is indeed a misapprehension. Such misconceptions have occurred in every age and we rather pity those who thus misunderstand us. It will be evident to one who has observed both the Russian Orthodox Church and the Japanese Orthodox Church, that the Japanese Church is not Russianised at all, even though it be aided by Russia. Bishop Nicolai, who is the apostle to Japan, did not introduce customs which were exclusively Russian at all. He only handed down the doctrines and customs of the Eastern Church of the Holy Catholic Apostles. In 1893 Archbishop Deonishi of Zante. an island off the west coast of Greece, visited our Japanese Orthodox Church. The Archbishop is a Greek and belongs to the Greek Church. However, he came to the Cathedral at Surugadai and worshipped with Japanese priests without changing bis form of worship. He thus proved by his action that the Japanese Orthodox Church, which was established by the Russian Missionary Society, is just the same as those Orthodox Churches found in Greece and neighbouring countries. In the year 1895 Archbishop Gerashim of Jerusalem sent to our Japanese Orthodox Church a holy image that our reciprocal and harmonious relations might thereby be manifest. This shows plainly that the Orthodox Church established in Jerusalem is wholly like the Orthodox Churches found in all Eastern Europe.&rdquo;*</p>
<p>Besides the objection growing out of its relation to Russia, the Orthodox Church shared with others the popular dislike of Christianity. The following instances will show how this dislike manifested itself.</p>
<p>In 1894 an evangelist visited a village in the province of Ise where there were two converts. The villagers were soon aroused to active opposition, and drew up a covenant containing the following articles:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christians shall be deprived of their former rights in the common forests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christians shall not be admitted into our houses, nor will we enter theirs. If it is necessary to transact any business with them, we will stand outside of their houses while talking with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will prevent the Christians from working in the mountains. We will not turn aside for them when we meet them upon the street.&rdquo;*</p>
<p>In a village of Akita Prefecture under similar circumstances Buddhist priests from abroad were summoned to oppose the hated religion, and a document was drawn up pledging the villagers to break off all relations with Christians, not to allow them to hold any office, not to rent land to them, not to furnish lodging for the preachers, and to treat as Christians all persons that would not set their seal to this agreement. There was an attempt to break up the meetings, stones were thrown, and blows struck.†</p>
<p>In Shirakawa, Fukushima Prefecture, a town of ten thousand inhabitants, enmity was excited against the Christians because of their refusal to contribute towards the expenses of a religious festival. Some of their houses were injured by stones thrown against them. One believer and his wife were dragged out from their house and received several wounds. Three of the men that made the disturbance were arrested by the police, but were soon released.‡</p>
<p>In places where both Greek and Protestant evangelists were working, their relations, though not very close, were usually cordial except as sometimes feeling was aroused by the converts of one passing over to the other. In case the removal was from the Greek Church, the severe terms of the ban of excommunication prescribed by its ritual were not calculated to promote harmony.</p>
<p>In the city of Wakayama the workers of the Greek Orthodox, the Episcopalian, and the Presbyterian churches, thirteen in number, and including four foreign missionaries, had a society which met once a month. The church-members also had an alliance that provided for public lectures once a month. When attempts were made in 1898 to introduce into Wakayama Prefecture the system of licensed prostitution, from which it had hitherto been exempt, the Protestant churches proposed to the Greek and Roman Catholic that they should unite in opposing this effort. This was done; letters signed by representatives of each church were sent out, officials and legislators were interviewed, and a mass meeting was held in a theatre with addresses by the Protestant and Greek evangelists.*</p>
<p>When war broke out in 1904 between Japan and Russia, Bishop Nicolai was in a very trying position. Two Russian priests attached to the Russian legation, who had assisted him in his work, returned home. The Bishop, urged by the Russian Minister, to decide at once whether or not he would leave the country, called a council of the workers and leading Christians to ask their opinion about what he would better do. They were unanimous in adopting a resolution in which they said: &ldquo;We earnestly hope, whatever may happen, that you will not return to your own country, but that for the sake of the Orthodox Church in Japan you will remain here.&rdquo; This decision having been reported to him, he addressed them the next day as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not make up my mind until yesterday whether I should remain in Japan or not in case of a Russo-Japanese war. If I returned to Russia, I should still have much business to attend to on behalf of our missions, but I have decided to remain in Japan. I am very glad to hear that your members unanimously decided that I should not return to Russia. I believe this is God&rsquo;s will. Especially I felt this to-day when I was praying during the service. My indecision up till yesterday belonged to my private convenience and not to the public. To say the truth, it is about twenty-three years since I left my native country, and a longing crept over me to return to my sweet home. But thinking the matter over more seriously, I realised that this was only my private inclination and that my public life belonged to Japan where our Church is yet in its infancy. Now I am thanking my God that your members have decided the question for me as you have. And again, I thank you for your kindness and that of your members in providing for my safety in case personal danger threatened. You say that I need not enter a foreign legation, that you will protect me. But I think such a promise is not necessary. Our Russian Minister will provide for the protection of Russian subjects in Japan by either the French or German Ministers when he withdraws from Tokyo, and, moreover, the Japanese Government will protect such Russians who have no relations with the war. But it will be necessary to ask for the protection of the authorities for the safety of our Cathedral and all the buildings of the Church. These buildings are the property of the Japanese Orthodox Church, and in case they are violated (which I think will not be the case) your members would suffer a great loss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope there will be no change in our Church through the outbreak of war. Evangelists must propagate the Master&rsquo;s Gospel, students must attend the Mission School as usual and I will devote myself to the translation of the Prayer-book with my assistant. Mr. Nakae. And if an imperial Proclamation of war is issued, your members must pray for the triumph of Japan and when the Japanese army has conquered the Russian forces you must offer to God a prayer of thankfulness. This is the obligation laid on the Orthodox Christian in his native country Our Lord Jesus Christ teaches us patriotism and loyalty. Christ Himself shed tears for Jerusalem. That was because of His patriotism, and you must follow in your Master&rsquo;s steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I prayed as usual to-day in the Cathedral, but henceforth I Will not take part in the public prayers. This is not for the reason that it might be dangerous for me to appear in the Cathedral, but for the reason that until now I prayed for the victory and the peace of the Japanese Emperor, but now in case of war I can not pray as a Russian subject that our native country should be conquered by an enemy. I have, as you also have, an obligation to my country, therefore I am glad to see that you realise your obligation to your country. For myself. I will not for the time being serve in the public prayers of the Japanese Church.&rdquo;*</p>
<p>The decision of Bishop Nicolai was generally commended both by Japanese and by foreign residents. Doubtless it was also pleasing to the Government, since it gave an opportunity to show to the Western World its unwillingness to have the war regarded as in any sense a conflict with the Christian religion. Another address made by Bishop Nicolai about five months after the beginning of the war expressed his appreciation of the attitude of the Japanese Government, and spoke of the difficulties experienced by the Church. It will also serve to show us something of his own spirit. He said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear brethren and co-workers. Our meeting is at an unfavourable time for the Church, hut from our hearts we give thanks and praise God that through His mercy the Church remains in peace unmolested and that its members still maintain their good faith, each worker doing his duty faithfully. We also give thanks to the Japanese Government for its kind protection. From the beginning of this war, the Government declared that religion and politics or war should not be confounded, that no one should be hindered in religious rites or faith. As you know, this declaration has been kept. Only one or two suspicious persons have disturbed the peace of our Christians, and they have since been suppressed by the local governors. But the protection of the Government is only from the outside storm, and if in the inner life of the Church troubles should arise, the Government cannot protect us. A rotten boat is easily sunk by the waves; a worm-eaten tree falls easily by the wind. Toward our Church there is at present no heavy storm, but there are winds of hatred brewing by which we have so far been unmoved. No Christians have broken faith, no workers have left their posts of duty. As the blood flows through the whole body and gives life, we have evidence that just so the mercies of God are flowing through our Church body and that the Greek Church of japan is not built upon the sand but is founded upon the Corner-stone for eternity. Brethren, observe this and know that God has accepted and blessed our little service, and rejoices that our labour is not in vain. Is this not a great comfort and consolation to us? Our Church is not only existing in the midst of this troublous time, but it is growing. Of course, the number of additions this year is less than last. The voice of the Gospel of Peace is drowned by the shouts of war. It is hard to reach the ear, but some few have heard and accepted, and these are precious fruit to the Kingdom of God.&rdquo;*</p>
<p>The members of the Orthodox Church did not fall behind others in patriotism. At the beginning of the war they organised a society to give aid to the families that were in distress because the chief wage-earners had been called to the army. Teachers and students in the theological schools collected money with which to print several thousand copies of &ldquo;Japanese-Russian Military Conversations,&rdquo; and these they presented to the War Department.</p>
<p>When, as a result of Japanese victories, large numbers of prisoners were brought to Japan, a new and interesting work devolved upon this Church. By the permission of the War Department, priests with an understanding of the Russian language were sent to all the towns where captives were detained, and temporary places of worship were set up within the camps. To many a homesick man it must have been a great comfort to listen to the familiar liturgy and to take part in the rites to which he had been accustomed from childhood. As the number of priests was insufficient for this new service, several persons were ordained sooner than they would otherwise have been. Much liberty was given to the Russian officers. Those that wished to do so could attend the ordinary churches, if such there were in the cities where they were held as prisoners. The following report gives a brief account of the work among the captives:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Owing to the war, our evangelistic work among the Japanese people was hindered because of the especial work God had for us among the 73,000 Russian prisoners. Since our Church in Japan is small, we could not comfort the prisoners as we would have liked to do. Seventeen priests and six assistant priests who understood the Russian language devoted their full time to the work. Beside these, the older priests who could not speak the language had with them assistant priests as interpreters. These men conducted prayers and administered the sacrament in such a manner as to afford the prisoners all the religious comforts of their home land. The prisoners received the Japanese priests in all love and respect as if of their native blood, counting them all God&rsquo;s workers. As a proof of their deep appreciation of the work done among them, Bishop Nicolai has received many letters requesting him to extend to these Japanese workers most hearty thanks. Not only these letters have been received, but also presents of very valuable cloth. While the Japanese workers have given their time to comforting the prisoners, they have in return been greatly strengthened in faith by witnessing the devotion of these men even in hours of deep trial. The Russian men raised <em>yen</em> 11,700 for Bishop Nicolai&rsquo;s work. They built several chapels where they happened to be quartered, and paid all expenses in connection with the religious work among them. Bishop Nicolai gave to the prisoners 68,000 copies of the Gospels in the Russian language and several thousand copies of religious and literary books, also many prayer-books and silver-woven cloth. He also gave winter clothes to sick prisoners. All of these expenses were met by Christians from abroad.&rdquo;*</p>
<p>A society was also organised for helping the Japanese prisoners in Russia, Three thousand &ldquo;comfort bags&rdquo; were sent to these men.</p>
<p>At <em>a,</em> time when Protestant and Roman Catholic Christians were often suspected of being spies in the employ of the enemy, the members of a church closely related to Russia could not well escape being charged by the common people with disloyal acts. In some cases they were in danger of violence, and occasionally damage was done to church property. There was reason to fear that in Tokyo an attack might be made on the Cathedral, whose location on one of the most commanding sites in the city had long made it an object of popular dislike. The land on which it was built had originally been granted to the Russian Legation, in whose name it was still held, and some argued that it ought now be seized as the property of a hostile nation. The Japanese Government, however, took care to frown upon all such expressions of hatred. The Cathedral was carefully guarded by the police and, so far as known, no serious attempt to harm it was made by the populace.</p>
<p>During the time of withdrawal from the more active duties of his episcopate, Bishop Nicolai was largely occupied with literary labours. A report for 1904 says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the publication department of the Church, we have nine men who are engaged solely in translation, and besides these there are three editors of magazines and church literature. The official organ of the Church is the <em>Seikyo Shimpo,</em> published fortnightly. The <em>Seikyo Yowa,</em> a monthly magazine, is devoted mostly to sermons and religious instructions for the edification of the Christians. The <em>Uranishiki</em> is a monthly periodical especially for women.&rdquo;*</p>
<p>This work was under the close supervision of Bishop Nicolai. Previously to this he had prepared a translation of the New Testament. The Orthodox Church had for a long time used the version made by the Protestants. Bishop Nicolai was not fully satisfied with this, partly because he thought it had been too much influenced by the English translation and partly because he considered its style as too near that of the colloquial language, and thus as lacking in the dignity that was desirable in such a book. His own translation made more use of Chinese terms and archaic forms.</p>
<p>In 1906 Bishop Nicolai was raised to the rank of Archbishop, and Père Andronik, who some years before had spent a short time in Japan as a member of the Mission, was made a bishop. The latter had hardly reached Japan the next spring when his health gave way and he was obliged to return ere he had fully entered upon the duties of his office. In 1908 another bishop was sent out to take his place.</p>
<p>After the war with Japan, the disturbed state of Russia, and the financial stringency existing there, led to a great falling off in the receipts of the Russian Missionary Society. This necessitated a reduction in the activities of the Japanese Church. At the Annual Convention held in July, 1907, it was decided to lessen expenses by diminishing the number of evangelists and students. This difficulty was bravely met by the Archbishop. A statement prepared under his direction says: &ldquo;Faced as it is by the necessity of attaining self-support, the Japanese Church will rather look upon this necessity as a providence of the Most High, which is designed to be a strong stimulus to further progress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hitherto, this Church had made but little advance in the way of self-support; and it may be that, as has been the case with some others, the lessening of foreign aid will prove a blessing, and that what now seems a misfortune will hereafter be looked upon as one of the best things that could have happened to it at this stage of its development.</p>
