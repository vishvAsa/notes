title = "03 WORK OF THE EARLY MISSIONARIES 1551-1570"

+++



WHILE Xavier was in Bungo he received letters from Torres and Fernandez telling him of events in Yamaguchi. Immediately after his departure from that city the bonzes forced their way into the house where the missionaries dwelt, and began to make sport of them and their teachings. There also came for several successive days a number of the gentlemen and scholars of the city to propound various questions concerning the Christian religion. Fernandez sent to Xavier a list of these queries and of the answers that Torres made through him as interpreter. The questions were as follows:—

Of what material did God create human souls?

What is the shape of the soul, and what is its colour?

If the soul is without colour, is it then nothing at all?

What is God and where is He?

Has God a body?

When the soul leaves the body, does it see God?

Why cannot a man see God?

If the soul is not corporeal, is it God?

What are devils?

Why do devils cause so much evil to men?

It is not true that all which God created is good; for did He not create that proud and rebellious spirit, Lucifer?

If God desires the salvation of men, why does He permit the devil to do them so much evil?

If God wishes to save men, why has He made them so that they seem to be set upon doing or desiring evil?

If God wishes that all men should attain to glory, why has He made the road to its attainment so difficult?

As hell is in the center of the earth, then, when the devils come to tempt us, do they escape from their torments?

If, as you say, the devils are in torment wherever they are, why was a special place created for punishing them?

By what road can devils come to us from the center of the earth?

If God wishes to save men, why has He been so slow in giving us a knowledge of His Law?

There are some men so devoid of intelligence that they cannot attain to a knowledge of their Creator. What will become of such persons?

The Buddhist priests did their best to excite the people against the missionaries. Many were the stories that they invented for this purpose. Among other things they declared that they had seen a demon causing lightning to fall upon the Daimyo's mansion because of his relations with foreigners.

A civil strife that broke out at the end of September, 1551, though it had no direct connection with religious matters, increased the danger of the missionaries' position. A revolt was raised against the Daimyo, who, after an attempt at flight, committed suicide. For eight days the city was a scene of confusion and bloodshed. At the beginning of the trouble an influential gentleman of the city invited the foreigners to take shelter in his house. On the way thither they met several armed bands and heard people shouting: "Let us slay those men from India, since they are the cause of the evils that have come upon us. "Their protector decided that they would be safer in a Buddhist monastery to whose funds he was a leading contributor. He accordingly sent them thither, and though the bonzes were at first inclined to refuse them admittance, saying: "You are devils and it is you who have brought all these calamities upon the land," they finally yielded and gave them shelter for two days. After this, the missionaries returned to the house of their protector, who concealed them until danger was over.

Those who had brought about the revolution now persuaded the brother of Otomo Yoshishige to take the place of the daimyo against whom they had rebelled. The new ruler, like his brother, was friendly to foreigners. Xavier in one of his letters says:

"Before I left Japan, the King of Bungo promised the Portuguese and myself that he would omit nothing which would induce his brother, the King of Yamaguchi, to treat Father Torres and Brother Fernandez with all favour; and the King of Yamaguchi, who had hardly entered into possession of his estates, promised for himself that he would do this."

As one result of this latter promise, a Buddhist monastery in Yamaguchi was soon afterwards given to the missionaries. The deed, of which a facsimile has been preserved, was to the following effect:

"With respect to Daijoji in Yamaguchi, Agata, Yoshiki Department, Province of Suwo. This deed witnesses that I have given permission to the priests that have come to this country from the western regions, in accordance with their request and desire that they may found a monastery and house in order to develop the law of Buddha."\*

After his return to India, Xavier sent Father Balthazar Gago, together with Brothers Edward de Sylva and Peter d'Alcaceva to reinforce the mission in Japan. They reached Kagoshima in August, 1552, and proceeded to Funai, where they delivered the letters and presents that had been sent to Yoshishige by the Viceroy of India, On learning of their arrival, Torres sent Fernandez to act as their interpreter and to accompany them to Yamaguchi. The next Christmas was celebrated in that city with great pomp, and several persons who had become converts were invited to meet with the missionaries for a conference. Among other results of their deliberations was a decision that the Christians should engage in works of charity. One reason for doing this was to disprove the charge made by the Buddhist priests, who said that those who became Christians were influenced by the desire to escape from the necessity of making contributions to the temples. It was therefore ordered that a box for the reception of alms be placed at the entrance of the building that was used for worship. The administration of the contributions was assigned to men whose rank and probity made them honoured by the people of the city.

Soon after this meeting, Gago and Fernandez went to reside in Funai; Sylva and Lawrence remained in Yamaguchi to assist Torres; while Alcaceva, bearing letters and presents from the Daimyo of Bungo to the Viceroy of India, soon returned to Goa in order to report the state of affairs in Japan and to ask for more missionaries.

For some time Funai and Yamaguchi remained the centres of Christian work. Naito, the Governor of Yamaguchi, was among those that early received baptism. His example was followed by many other prominent persons. Two Buddhist priests of Kyoto, moved by curiosity to see the foreigners and by a desire to enter into a discussion with them, came to Yamaguchi, One day, while Father Torres was addressing the people, these priests began to ask questions. The missionary replied and then continued his discourse, in which he had occasion to refer to the Apostle Paul. "Who is this Paul of whom you speak?" asked one of the priests. Thereupon Torres gave an extended account of the Apostle's life. Hardly had he finished when the questioner called out: "I, too, will be a Christian. As I have hitherto imitated Saul the persecutor, I desire henceforth to be like Paul the Apostle. "His companion also declared his decision to be a Christian. The two men were soon baptised and received the names Paul and Barnabas. Both became earnest evangelists, going about the neighbouring towns and villages in order to proclaim their new faith.

In Funai the Buddhist priests, after vain attempts to make the people believe their calumnies against the missionaries, began to claim that Christianity differed from Buddhism only in certain external matters that were of little importance. The missionaries set themselves earnestly to the task of disproving such assertions by showing the radical differences between the two religions. A revolt that arose against Otomo Yoshishige was thought to have been instigated by the Buddhists, and it threatened to interfere seriously with the progress of Christianity. The Daimyo was besieged in one of his strongholds. lie did not know whom he could trust or what was the real strength of the opposition against him. Fernandez at considerable risk made his way to the castle, where he was able to report the real state of affairs. This act, together with the loyalty of the Christians, increased the favour with which Yoshishige regarded the missionaries.

Another revolt at Yamaguchi proved disastrous to Yoshishige's brother and to the church in that city. The number of converts there had reached about two thousand in the year 1556, when the opponents of the new Daimyo attacked the city and set it on fire. Three weeks later, it was reported that the enemy was approaching for another attack. The converts persuaded Torres, the only missionary then in Yamaguchi, to take refuge in Bungo. Soon after this, the Daimyo was slain, Many of the Christians lost their lives. For the next eighteen years the church of Yamaguchi was left without any resident priest, and it never again attained that degree of prosperity that its early history seemed to promise.

Alcaceva's efforts in India to obtain more missionaries for Japan were successful. Even the Provincial of the Jesuits, Melchior Nugnez, decided to be one of the number. He was helped to this decision by a conversation with Mendez Pinto, who, in telling him about Xavier's work in Japan, exclaimed: "Father Nugnez, you are the man who ought to go to that country. Gladly would I accompany you thither. How happy should I be if God graciously permitted me to give my life for the glory of His holy name\!" The Provincial, who doubted whether Pinto was in earnest, began to speak of some objections. Pinto declared that his desire to go was so great that no difficulties could hold him back. Moreover, he announced that, after sending some gifts to relatives in Portugal, he would devote the rest of his fortune to the expenses of the proposed expedition to Japan and to the establishment of a seminary in Yamaguchi, This enthusiasm was so contagious that Nugnez, after consulting his associates and the Viceroy, decided that it was his duty to go to Japan with Pinto, who was now appointed the Viceroy's ambassador to the Daimyo—or King, as the Portuguese considered him—of Bungo.\* With them went Father Gaspar Vilela and some seminarists. They set sail early in 1554, but were obliged to winter in Malacca, The next year, unfavourable winds detained them in China, where Nugnez received a letter from Loyola saying that a provincial ought not to go to regions so distant that he could not quickly return to his appointed place. Letters also came from Goa urging him to come back, lie was about to follow these injunctions when a Portuguese merchant came from Japan with reports that again inflamed his zeal. Moreover, he received a letter from the Daimyo of Hirado, who had heard that Nugnez was on his way to Japan and therefore urged him to come to that city. The Daimyo doubtless thought that the residence there of the Provincial would help to draw the Portuguese merchants. In asking Nugnez to come to him, he referred to the previous visits of Xavier and other missionaries, saying that many of his leading retainers, as well as some members of his own family, had been baptised, and he declared that he himself was almost ready to become a Christian.

Nugnez decided to go forward. The winds were such that, instead of proceeding to Hirado, the captain found it advisable to land on the coast of Bungo, which they reached in July, 1556. The missionaries were received with great honour by Yoshishige. Using Fernandez as interpreter, Nugnez had a long interview with this lord, who declared that he was convinced of the truth of Christianity. When he was urged to receive baptism and thus make a public declaration of his faith, he said that this was for the time being impossible, as there were in his domains many rebellious spirits who would take advantage of such action on his part and would join the Buddhist priests in seeking his overthrow.

Illness prevented Nugnez from going to Hirado and necessitated his speedy return to India. Before his departure he admitted to the Society of Jesuits two of the seminarists that had accompanied him to Japan, and also Louis Almeida, a Portuguese gentleman about thirty years of age, who had come to India and afterwards to Japan, hoping that by trade or by the practice of medicine, which he had studied, he might be able to repair his damaged fortunes. Just as he was about to return to Portugal, Father Gago had persuaded him to undertake the Spiritual Exercises of Loyola, and as a result of this he decided to give himself wholly to the service of God. Before his admission to the Society, he devoted five thousand crowns, which he had brought with him for trade, to the establishment at Funai of a hospital for lepers and of an asylum for children whose parents were too poor to provide for their support. He was led to found this asylum because he learned that the Japanese women often killed their new-born babes in order to avoid the expense of rearing them. The Daimyo, to whom Almeida appealed for help against this iniquitous custom, promised to provide nurses to care for the children\* Almeida was the first of the noble line of medical missionaries in Japan. The reputation that he gained for his skill in healing disease, the charity that he manifested for those in poverty or distress, and his indefatigable efforts for the spread of the Gospel, made him one of the most successful of the Jesuit labourers.

The persistency with which the Daimyo of Hirado continued to ask for missionaries inspired the hope that he might be more ready than Yoshishige to become an open adherent of Christianity. Early in 1557, Gago, Fernandez, and Paul, the converted Buddhist priest, were sent to Hirado by Torres, whom Nugnez had made Superior. Although they did not find the Daimyo in so teachable a state of mind as they had hoped, the favourable reception that he gave them opened the way by which they were able to attain much success among his subjects. One of the early converts was Koteda Saemonnojo, a brother of the Daimyo, and acting under him as ruler of two neighbouring islands named Takashima and Ikutsukishima. At baptism he took the name Anthony. Under the designation "Prince Anthony" he occupies a prominent place in the letters and reports of the Jesuits, From the first he was very zealous in seeking the conversion of his own subjects. At his invitation the missionaries visited the islands. "The Prince's example drew abundance after it, and his zeal more; for he changed from a prince into an apostle by exhorting his people himself to leave their superstition, and standing godfather to all that would receive holy baptism. He had no greater pleasure in the world than to see them pull down idols out of the temples and houses, and burn, and throw them into the sea."\*

With such encouragement it is not strange that adherents to the new religion increased so rapidly that in less than two months there were said to be fourteen hundred Christians in Anthony's estates. For their use he built several churches. In the absence of priests, the meetings held were chiefly for mutual encouragement and for the instruction of children. In the city of Hirado also there were many baptisms, and two churches were erected.

Ere long the number of workers was reduced by the illness of Paul. Feeling that he had not much longer to live, he begged to be taken back to Father Torres in order that he might receive the last sacrament from the same hand that had baptised him. This request was granted, and he died soon after reaching Funai.

Father Vilela was sent to take the place of Paul and of Gago, who had gone in 1557 to Hakata in Chikuzen, a province that had lately come into the possession of Otomo Yoshishige. Vilela was delighted with what he found in his new field of labour. It seemed to him that he had never seen so much religious fervour. All the neophytes, he said, were like catechists, trying to teach others what they themselves had learned. Vilela's own energy had much to do with this exhibition of zeal. He sent out one of the Brothers through the streets to ring a bell, chant prayers, and attract the children to church. The boys were organised in bands that paraded the streets singing Christian hymns, and they were told to repeat to their parents what was taught them in the church.

One morning the Christians were much excited to find that in the night a cross at whose foot they had been accustomed to pray had been removed. This was asserted to be the work of Buddhist priests, who had chosen three of their number to uproot the hated symbol of Christianity. As the story was afterwards told, speedy punishment fell upon those that had committed the sacrilege; for two of them at once fell into a quarrel that ended in their slaying each other, while the third mysteriously disappeared, nothing being heard of him until a demon that had taken possession of a young man confessed to being the spirit of the person who had thrown down the cross and who was now suffering punishment for the evil deed.

On seeing what had been done, the more impetuous of the believers set fire to a Buddhist monastery. They also dragged out the idols from a neighbouring temple, burning some of them and casting others into the sea. The priests hastened to the Daimyo, demanding not only that the Christians be punished, but that Vilela, the foreigner that was causing this trouble, should be driven out of the country. On the other hand, Anthony came to the defence of the missionary, asking if it was right to send away so summarily a religious teacher who had come at the Daimyo's own invitation, to whom protection had been promised, and who had committed no wrong. He declared that though the Daimyo's subjects had been forbidden to annoy the foreigners, the bonzes had circulated calumnies concerning them and had been the first movers in the present acts of violence.

The Daimyo replied by speaking of the difficult position in which he was placed. As the Daimyo of Bungo was about to make war upon him, it was imperative that there should be no division among his subjects; but the Buddhist priests were now threatening to stir up an insurrection. He urged that in view of the coming conflict it would be better for the missionary to withdraw, as he would be suspected of being an emissary of the Lord of Bungo. Moreover, a temporary withdrawal would be for the best interests of Christianity, since it would give an opportunity for the present excitement to cool down.

Convinced by these arguments, Anthony advised Vilela to leave the province for a while. At the same time a letter from Yoshishige urged the missionary to return to him. He accordingly set out at once for Funai, It is said that in his short stop at Hirado he had baptised thirteen hundred persons and converted three temples into Christian churches.

The believers in Hirado were now exposed to great trials, and it was from their number that the first Japanese martyr came. Another cross had been erected in the suburbs of the city. Thither processions of the Christians went every morning and evening, while at other times guards were stationed to preserve it from insult. Among the Christians was the maid-servant of an unbelieving master who said that he would kill her if she persisted in going to the cross for worship. Unhindered by his threats, she continued her devotions until one morning, as she was returning from the cross, she was met by her master, who drew his sword and cut off her head. The Christians took up the body and buried it with great solemnity, exhorting one another to imitate the woman's example by remaining faithful unto death.

It has been mentioned that shortly before Vilela went to Hirado, Gago had removed to Hakata, the chief city of Chikuzen. He was accompanied by Brother Perreyra, one of the young Portuguese whom Nugnez had recently admitted to the Society of Jesus. They had not been there very long when the city was besieged by its former possessors, who were striving to recover the territories that had been seized by Otomo Yoshishige. At first a vigorous defence was made, but it is said that the Buddhist priests, who were very averse to being under a lord favourable to Christianity, opened the gates to the enemy. Fernandez, who happened to be in Hakata at the beginning of the siege, had been sent away by Gago in charge of some Christian children that served as acolytes. The other two Jesuits and Sylvester, a Christian who had accompanied them from Hirado, escaped by night to a ship that was anchored about two leagues from the city. When the captain learned that Hakata had been taken and that the refugees were the preachers who had been sent by Yoshishige, he took from them the church ornaments and other things they had brought with them, at the same time threatening them with death. Sylvester was told that he was free to depart, but he refused to leave the missionaries. After four days the captain reported to the Governor of Hakata that he had the foreigners in his charge. A force of soldiers that was sent to take them over quarrelled with the captain concerning the plunder and stripped from the missionaries the few clothes that had been left them. On arriving at Hakata, the captives were kept for several days in a dungeon beneath the ramparts. A Christian of high rank finally obtained permission to take them under his care. He also paid money for the ransom of Gago and the children, as their attempt to escape had been unsuccessful. For three months the missionaries lived in daily expectation that orders would be given for their execution; but at the end of that time they were led outside of the city and told that they might depart. They reached Funai only a short time before the arrival of Vilela.

It was not long before the missionaries thus assembled at Funai began to scatter once more. Mention has already been made of Mt. Hiei, a stronghold of Buddhism in the vicinity of Kyoto. The head priest of one of its temples had sent a letter to Father Torres expressing an earnest desire to see him. The writer said that only his own great age kept him from making the journey to Bungo, and he hoped that Torres, who had travelled from the ends of the earth to preach his religion to the Japanese, would be willing to come to Mt. Hiei in order to instruct a person earnestly desirous to know the truth. Xavier in his letters had written much about what he called the three great universities of Japan— Mt. Hiei, Koya, and Ashikaga,—urging that missionaries should be sent who had the ability to cope with their learned men, secure their conversion, and thus gain their help in Christianising Japan. The priest's letter seemed to open the way for entrance to the first of these schools.

Torres, who was unable to go at that time, forwarded to the priest a written statement of the principal Christian doctrines, and soon after he sent Vilela to give further instruction. In company with Brother Lawrence and another Japanese Christian, Vilela went by sea to Sakai and thence by land to Sakamoto, a village on the shores of Lake Biwa and at the foot of Mt. Hiei. There he learned that the priest who had sent the letter to Torres was no longer living. His successor professed considerable interest in what he heard from Vilela and advised him to ascend the mountain in order to visit the chief prelate. The missionary found, however, that it was impossible to get access to this dignitary. He therefore went to Kyoto. There with his companions he at first spent ten days in fasting, prayer, and penance, as a preparation for the work upon which they were entering. Then, with his head shaved after the manner of the bonzes and wearing robes like theirs, but carrying a crucifix in his hand, he went into the streets and began to preach. The capital was at that time enjoying a period of tranquillity, and the people flocked about the stranger to hear what he bad to say. His peculiar manners and inaccurate use of the language made him an object of ridicule. Ere long, however, "through Otomo's favours and letters," and, strangely enough, "under the conduct of a Buddhist priest, one of the most respected men in the city," he obtained an interview with the Shogun, who received him with great favour and as a mark of honour drank out of the same cup with him. Moreover, the Shogun assigned him a house, favourably situated, where he was visited by many prominent citizens, some of whom invited him to their own mansions. It was not long before a person who is described as "one of the chief men" of the neighbouring city of Yamashina was baptised together with ten of his friends.

The enmity of the Buddhist priests was quickly aroused. In addition to denouncing the teaching of the preachers, they circulated all sorts of evil reports concerning them, saying among other things that they ate human flesh and that the bones of children bad been found in their dwelling. Their landlord was induced to turn them out, so that they were forced to take shelter in a dilapidated building, where they were the object of insults from crowds of ill-disposed men and children who came to annoy them.\* In some way, however, Vilela had gained the favour of Miyoshi, one of the Shogun's ministers. Thus it came about that proclamations permitting the missionaries to preach were posted throughout the city. This for a time put a stop to the opposition of the priests. Some of them even became believers. A great sensation was caused by the conversion of one of their number who had a great reputation for scholarship. It is said that among the writings adorning the walls of his room were sentences that seemed to show that by the light of nature he had attained to a knowledge of some of the truths held by Christians. One writing spoke of a God without beginning or end; another showed the dependence of the human heart on a Supreme Being who rules its movements. With an air of self-sufficiency this priest had come for an interview with Vilela; but after listening for some time to the latter's words, he suddenly called out: "I am a Christian. Baptise me." The news of his conversion spread abroad and fifteen other priests soon followed his example, Among them was one of upright life and austere manners who had vowed to devote his whole life to gratuitously teaching the Buddhist scripture known as Hokke-kyo. He told Vilela that a few years previously he had dreamed that priests came from India to teach the true way of salvation, and the very next day he learned of Xavier's arrival in Yamaguchi.

These conversions led to a new outbreak of hostility. It is charged against the Buddhist priests that they used bribes to induce the Governor of Kyoto to drive the preachers from the city. While he was seeking some pretext for doing what they desired, Miyoshi, who had learned of the plot, induced Vilela to withdraw for the time being to one of the minister's castles a few miles distant. Vilela consented, but afterwards, fearing that his act might be interpreted as a cowardly flight from danger, he returned to Kyoto, where he preached with as much boldness as ever. Miyoshi then caused a new edict to be issued which forbade any interference with the Christian teachers.

It is interesting to know that Vilela's rebukes of the immorality that prevailed in the Buddhist priesthood so stirred the followers of the Nichiren sect that they demanded a reform, deposing the abbot of one of their monasteries because he kept concubines, showed a mercenary spirit, and disregarded the Buddhist prohibition of animal food.

The number of missionaries at Funai was further reduced by the departure of Father Gago. He had at first been a very zealous worker and the instrument for many conversions. Not long after his return from Hakata it was noticed that he seemed greatly changed. He had lost his interest in evangelistic labours. He who had once thought nothing too difficult was now abashed by slight obstacles. He finally declared that his physical infirmities made it impossible for him to remain in Japan. Torres, who judged that one in this state of mind would be of no help to the work, consented to his departure, and he sailed from Bungo in October, 1561.

At this time the churches of Japan were reckoned as five in number—those of Funai, Kyoto, Yamaguchi, Hakata, and Hirado. These were in correspondence with one another, sending letters by which each gave intelligence concerning itself and exhorted the others to faithfulness. Father Torres, who had oversight of all, was in Funai, while Father Vilela was in Kyoto; but the departure of Father Gago left no ordained priests who could be put in charge of the churches in the other cities. Brother Almeida, however, set out in June to visit Hakata and Hirado. In the former city he baptised seventy persons, among whom was a Buddhist priest from Yamaguchi. Continuing his journey to the islands that belonged to the estates of Anthony Koteda, he found that all the inhabitants of Takashima were Christians with the exception of eight, and these were being taught by a converted bonze. They were soon baptised by Almeida. In Ikutsukishima there were said to be eight hundred Christians.

About the close of the year 1561, the captain of a Portuguese ship which had anchored at Kagoshima came to Bungo with some of his crew in order that they might make their confessions to Father Torres. They brought a letter from the Lord of Satsuma, who asked that some missionary might come to carry on the work that had been begun by Xavier. In this as in some other cases, the suspicion naturally arises that the desire to attract commerce to his port was the underlying motive in the mind of the writer of this letter. However that may be, Almeida was directed to go at once to Satsuma. He was gladly welcomed by the Christians of that province who had been left so long without instruction. Mention has already been made of his visit to the castle of Ichiku and of his interview in Kagoshima with the priests who had known Xavier. The Daimyo prepared a letter to be carried by the Portuguese captain to the Provincial of the Jesuits in India. Besides speaking of his admiration for the Christian religion and his desire to have it taught to his people, he was careful to call attention to the fact that the excellent harbour of Kagoshima afforded fine opportunities for European merchants.

While Almeida was in Kagoshima, Father Torres received letters from Sumitada, the Lord of the small principality of Omura in the western part of the island of Kyushu. The former Daimyo of Omura, who died in 1550, had left as his heir a son born of a concubine. For some reason the leading vassals were disinclined to receive this person as their lord and thus it came about that Sumitada, son of the Daimyo of the neighbouring fief of Arima, was adopted by the house of Omura as its head. Fie now desired to further the interests of his people by inducing foreign merchants to visit his ports. Following the advice of one of his retainers, he sought to make use of the missionaries for accomplishing his purpose. Charlevoix states that a book composed by Vilela had come into the hands of Sumitada and proved so convincing that he desired to meet one of the missionaries in order to confer with him about becoming a Christian; though, in order to conceal this purpose from his counsellors, he spoke to them only about the advantages of attracting foreign commerce. In his letter to Torres he asked that the latter would use his influence for bringing the Portuguese merchants to Omura. Among other inducements he promised that the foreigners might have for ten years, free from all taxes and duties, the use of the port of Yokoseura and the surrounding land within a radius of two leagues. No persons would be permitted to reside there without previously obtaining the consent of the Jesuits, for whom a residence would be built and a sufficient subsidy given to provide for its maintenance.

Torres at once recalled Almeida from Kagoshima and sent him to complete the arrangements at Omura, while he himself went to consult the Portuguese merchants at Hirado. As a result of his representations, a ship that was lying in the harbour hoisted anchor and prepared to sail to Yokoseura, the captain announcing that he did not care to trade any longer in a place where Christians were subjected to persecution. The Daimyo attempted to prevent by force the departure of the vessel, but his attack was repulsed by the Portuguese, who proceeded to the new port. Torres and Fernandez also hastened to Omura, where they met Sumitada, who assured them that it was his desire not to fall at all behind Otomo Yoshishige in his treatment of the missionaries and their converts. Yokoseura, which had been only a little village, quickly grew to be a flourishing town. The Portuguese merchants made it their chief port, and the favour shown to Christianity caused many Japanese believers from other places to remove thither. Sumitada himself had a residence there. In 1563 he was baptised and took the name of Bartholomew. He thus became the first of the Christian daimyos. Twenty-five of his leading retainers were baptised at the same time.

The morning after his baptism, Sumitada set forth to aid his elder brother Yoshisada, now the Daimyo of Arima, in a war that had broken out between the latter and the Daimyo of Saga. Hitherto it had been the custom for a daimyo before entering upon a campaign to worship at the shrine of the Goddess of War. Sumitada therefore marched with his troops to the temple, entered it with his body-guards, and then to the surprise of all beholders ordered that the image of the goddess be overthrown and dragged by a rope to the courtyard, where with his sword he struck off its head. The temple was then burned and a cross erected on its site. Sumitada, who had been much impressed by the story of Constantine as related to him by Torres, had figures of the cross inscribed on his armour and on the standards of his army. The successful outcome of the campaign he regarded as due to the special favour of God.

Sumitada advised his brother to open the port of Kochinotsu to the Portuguese on the same terms that had been granted in the case of Yokoseura. Almeida went to visit the city and in less than a month baptised two hundred and sixty persons, including the Governor and his family. He also visited the city of Shimabara, where he found that a company of believers had been gathered by one of the Japanese evangelists.

The religious zeal manifested by Sumitada aroused the opposition of the bonzes and gave occasion for several of his leading retainers to plot for his destruction. Not only had he caused some of the temples to be transformed into churches, but instead of burning incense before the ancestral tablets of the family into which he had been adopted, he threw them all, including that of his predecessor, into the fire. His enemies made the most of what they regarded as an insult to their former lord, whose bastard son, Takaaki, they now recalled. They had already obtained promises of assistance from the Daimyos of Hirado and Saga. The former made a sudden attack upon Omura, while the latter invaded Arima in order to prevent its Daimyo from going to his brother's aid. This was in August, 1564. The two cities of Yokoseura and Omura fell into the hands of the enemy and were set on fire. Sumitada with a small band of faithful retainers had taken refuge in the castle of Omura, where he was besieged by his former subjects, while the fleet sent from Hirado prevented any help from reaching him by sea. The rebels sent him word that they would return to their allegiance if he would renounce Christianity and banish it from his domains, a proposition to which he refused to listen. At the same time his brother was being hard pressed by his foes; but when the ex-Daimyo of Arima learned that his two sons were in such great danger, he took the field, drove the enemy from Arima, and then advanced to the help of Omura. He succeeded in establishing communication with Sumitada, who on October 4, 1564, made a sally just as his father's troops advanced from the other side upon the besiegers, who were utterly routed. At the same time a severe storm destroyed most of the boats that had come from Hirado.

Sumitada, triumphant over his foes, became more zealous than ever for the promotion of the religion that had excited their opposition. He put to death two of his retainers who in going over to the enemy had renounced Christianity, for he said that he could never trust persons who had thus broken promises made to God. Other revolts kept his territories in a confused state for several years, but more and more his enemies and those of his faith were subdued until Omura became outwardly almost entirely a Christian state.

Though the ex-Daimyo of Arima had hastened to the relief of his sons when they were in danger, he was very much opposed to Christianity, which he regarded as the chief cause of the misfortunes that had come upon them. His ill-will greatly increased the difficulties under which the missionaries laboured. Yokoseura was in ruins and its inhabitants scattered. When Torres visited Shimabara he found that its governor, though personally inclined to be friendly, had been forbidden to have anything to do with him. He therefore withdrew to Takase in the province of Higo, which was then in the possession of Otomo Yoshishige. While he was there Almeida also came, accompanying De Sylva, whose health was so broken that he died soon after his arrival.

The number of missionaries was however increased about this time by the coming of Father Louis Froez, Father Jean Baptiste Monts, and Brother Jacques Gonzalez. Froez was sent to assist Fernandez in the islands belonging to Anthony. A letter written by a Portuguese merchant and quoted by Crasset gives the following account of the earnestness of the Christians in those islands:

"I am confident that the Holy Ghost must live in the two islands of Takashima and Itsukishima belonging to Don Anthony, for none but those who see it with their eyes can imagine the innocency and fervour of these persons after living so many years in idolatry. I never saw any Christians like those at Takashima; they will not suffer a heathen to stay even one night amongst them. Every Friday throughout the year, whilst the Father says litanies, both great and little, old and young, fathers and children, torment themselves so cruelly with smart disciplines that it would even force tears from the very rocks to see them. Most of the men and women creep on their knees to a cross on a little hill where Christians are interred. To see them at their prayers you would take them for the most perfect European religious, and very few surpass them in austerities and fasts."

While Froez was in Takashima two Portuguese ships, soon to be followed by a third, approached Hirado. Froez sent a letter to their captains asking them not to enter the harbour without first getting from the Daimyo a promise that he would cease oppressing the Christians. Accordingly, when the Japanese officials went on board urging that the ships put into Hirado, they were told that this could not be done until the assent of Father Froez had been gained. The Daimyo, in his anxiety to secure the profitable trade, sent to the missionary making excuses for his former misdeeds and promising amendment. In accordance with a second letter from Froez, the ships now entered the port; but the captains refused to land any goods until authorisation had been given for the missionaries to live in Hirado and for a church to be erected at the expense of the Portuguese merchants, The Daimyo, while ready to make promises, was so slow in keeping them that Froez went out in a shallop to intercept the third vessel, whose commander agreed to remain outside the harbour until all was satisfactorily settled. The Daimyo finally yielded to the demands made upon him, and the third ship anchored beside the others.

As this last vessel had brought three new workers to the mission, Torres now redistributed the forces at his disposal. Two of the new arrivals, Fathers Jean Cabral and Melchior de Figueredo, were assigned respectively to Takashima and Kochinotsu, the latter port being chosen by Torres for his own residence. A third Father, named Balthazar d'Acosta, remained at Hirado with Fernandez. De Monts went to Bungo, while Froez and Almeida were sent to aid Vilela in Kyoto; but on the way thither Almeida was attacked by illness which led him to return to Kyushu. There were two other European Brothers \(Gonzalez and Sanchez\), besides four Japanese Brothers \(Lawrence, Damien, Austin, and Melchior\), and these were to be used in different places as necessity might arise.

While the events related were taking place in Kyushu, remarkable progress was made in Kyoto and its vicinity. Vilela had been directed by Torres to begin work in Sakai, whither he went in August, 1561. Though he found the character of its people such that after two years he declared that there was no hope of a speedy harvest, he had considered it advisable to remain there because of the civil strife that during most of that time convulsed Kyoto and the neighbouring country. After peace had been restored, he returned to the capital \(1563\). Following the plan previously adopted in Hirado, he set the young people to work proclaiming Christian doctrines and denouncing the Buddhist priests. For the same purpose he had some of the brightest boys from the orphanage in Bungo sent to his aid.

The bonzes presented to Matsunaga, who was Minister of Justice and a vassal of Miyoshi, a document in which they urged that an edict be issued against the foreign religion. Matsunaga replied that before consenting to any such action it would be necessary to make a careful examination of the new doctrines to see if they were as bad as the bonzes asserted. He therefore appointed two persons of high rank to take this matter in charge. Vilela and the Japanese evangelists found it advisable to withdraw once more to Sakai; but a Christian of Kyoto named Jacques, who had business with the Minister of Justice, was met by one of the commissioners and questioned about his faith. Though not possessed of much education, Jacques was able to explain his belief so well that the commissioner soon declared himself convinced that Christianity was true and asked him to send for Vilela to come and give fuller instruction. The missionary wished to set out at once in response to this summons; but his friends, fearing some plot, had Lawrence go in his place. Soon word came from the evangelist that it was even better than Jacques had reported, for the other commissioner was also ready to declare his belief in Christianity, Vilela therefore went to Kyoto, where he at once baptised the two new converts and also a relative of Miyoshi by the name of Shirai, who commanded the castle of Sangajima in the province of Kawachi. Not long after this, Vilela visited the estates of Shirai, whose son and sixty retainers, besides five hundred of the common people, were baptised.

Another important conversion was that of Takayama, the commander of the castle of Takatsuki about halfway between Kyoto and Osaka. It is said that he was a man of considerable erudition and that he had expressed confidence in his ability to refute the doctrines of the Christians so as to make even the foreign priest acknowledge that his religion was false. He therefore went to hear Vilela preach and at the end of the sermon entered into a discussion that resulted in his own confession that all his arguments had been overthrown. Soon after this he was baptised \(taking the name Dario\) together with his wife and his son, then fourteen years old, who afterwards became the most famous of the Japanese Christians, Takayama Ukon, or as he is called in the accounts of the Jesuits, Justo Ucondono.

From the first, the elder Takayama showed a great zeal in urging others to become Christians. It was largely through his influence that many men of high rank were baptised, among them being Naito, the Daimyo of Kameoka in the province of Tamba.

It was while Christianity was making such rapid progress that Father Froez reached Kyoto about the close of January, 1565. In February came the day which by the Japanese calendar was the beginning of the new year. On that day officials and men of high rank were expected to pay their respects to the Shogun. Vilela took this occasion for having his new associates presented at court. They took with them several gifts such as had been found adapted to the tastes of the Japanese. The Shogun showed such marked signs of favour to his foreign guests as to increase their reputation among the gentlemen of the court, leading these to press more eagerly than before to hear Vilela's sermons. Many of them expressed a desire for baptism.

Suddenly, just when it seemed as though the capital and surrounding regions were on the point of being completely won to Christianity, the work was interrupted by political disturbances. In the summer of 1565 the Shogun was murdered. The members of his family, with the exception of one younger brother who had become a priest, were also put to death, and all persons that had been closely attached to the Shogun were driven from Kyoto. Among those expelled were the missionaries, who thus had to suffer for the favours they had received from the murdered prince and his adherents. The Buddhist priests were quick to improve the opportunity. After failing in an endeavour to have the missionaries slain, they procured from the Emperor an edict prohibiting Christianity as an abominable religion. For three years the Jesuits were unable to reside in Kyoto.

It is not necessary here to give an account of the succession of conflicts that during the next few years were carried on between the different parties that were contending for political power. The Christians were divided in their allegiance. In following their feudal lords they often found themselves fighting against their brethren in the faith. At the close of the year 1565, two contending armies were encamped near Sakai. Father Froez sent invitations to the Christians on each side, asking them to come into the city for the celebration of Christmas, Accordingly large numbers of them came on the preceding evening, spent the hours until twelve o'clock in preparation for the sacrament, and then attended the midnight mass. They next went to the house of the missionaries, where they ate together, and at daybreak, after asking one another's pardon for what might come from the necessities of the coming conflict, they returned to their respective camps.

The outcome of the civil wars was such as to bring the real power into the hands of the noted General Nobunaga, although Yoshiaki, the younger brother of the murdered Shogun, was made the nominal successor to the office. Nobunaga had no great respect for Buddhism, nor love for its priests. In erecting a new palace for the Shogun he did not hesitate to tear down a monastery that was on the land he wished to use, and it is said that he went so far as to demolish idols in order to obtain the stone of which they were made. The priests soon saw that they could expect no help from him in shutting out their new rivals.

Takayama's brother and overlord, Wada Koremasa, had taken an important part in Nobunaga's campaign for making Yoshiaki shogun. He therefore had considerable influence with both the nominal and the real possessor of power. Though he had not been baptised, he was considered a catechumen and he became the protector of the Christians. He soon secured permission for the missionaries to return to Kyoto. Vilela had gone to Bungo, but Wada sent his brother Takayama to escort Froez from Sakai to Kyoto. Here the missionary was led into the presence of Nobunaga, who received him with marked distinction. At a second interview that Froez had with Nobunaga, a noted priest named Nichijo was present and Nobunaga took the opportunity to draw the representatives of the two religions into a discussion. When the debate turned upon the question of immortality, the champion of Buddhism, who had become very much excited, seized a sword and rushed upon Brother Lawrence, shouting that he would cut off his head so that it might be seen whether any soul remained after the death of the body. Wada and Hideyoshi, who were also present, were obliged to seize and disarm Nichijo.

Nobunaga gave written permission for Froez to reside in the city and to re-occupy the church building. This church was to have the same exemption from taxation that was granted to Buddhist temples, while it was to be free from the requirement by which under certain circumstances the temples were obliged to lodge soldiers. All persons were forbidden to molest the missionary or to prevent other people from attending his services.

The bonzes now had recourse to the Emperor, who was easily induced to aid them. He sent one of his nobles to remonstrate with Nobunaga for failing to consult with the source of all authority in the land before giving such great privileges to the teachers of doctrines that were subversive of everything that had hitherto been held sacred. According to Japanese writers, Nobunaga then entreated the Emperor to approve what had been done, and finally succeeded in having his request granted. This is probably a mere euphemism for saying that Nobunaga paid no heed to the Imperial messenger, and that the Emperor was unable to prevent whatever the powerful general had made up his mind to do.

Nobunaga returned to his own estates in Mino, leaving Wada as his representative in Kyoto. The priest Nichijo caused a rumour to be spread abroad that he had obtained the Emperor's permission to have Father Froez put to death. Wada at once sent out notice that, if any attempt were made upon the foreigner's life, the whole section of the city in which the latter lived would be held responsible and would be destroyed.

The next year, however, Nichijo had gained so much favour with Nobunaga that he was made a councillor of the Shogun. He took advantage of a temporary absence of Wada to renew his efforts against Christianity. Wada wrote to Father Froez advising him to go to Mino and have an interview with Nobunaga. In order that this might be secured, he gave the missionary a letter to Shibata, one of Nobunaga's generals. In accordance with this advice, Froez set out with Lawrence. Their reception was so favourable that they returned bearing documents which made it certain that neither Emperor nor Shogun would venture to issue orders for their banishment.

It was now Nichijo's turn to visit Nobunaga that he might bring accusations against Wada. The particular incident on which he chiefly relied for supporting his charges had arisen from Wada's great zeal in protecting the Christians. Two young men of the military class had snatched a religious medal from a Christian woman while she was at prayer in Wada's own mansion. He at once caused the chief offender to be beheaded and the other to be banished. Such a severe punishment for what was perhaps done only in sport very much excited Wada's enemies, and Nichijo made the most of it as a proof that the interests of the country were being made secondary to those of the Christian religion. Nobunaga, yielding to the words of the crafty priest, dismissed Wada from his office and confiscated a part of his lands. Great was the joy of the enemies of Christianity at Wada's downfall, since this opened the way for attacking those whom he had protected. Their triumph was shortlived. Nobunaga, on returning to Kyoto, expressed a desire to see Wada. The latter came before him with shaven head and mean clothes, as was appropriate for a person in disgrace. Nobunaga, regretting his dismissal of one who had been so good a warrior and officer, appointed him governor once more and made the restoration to favour more conspicuous by walking with him through the principal streets of the city. Nichijo, on the other hand, was deposed, and it was only the Emperor's intercession that saved the priest from death.

It was not long after this that Wada had an opportunity to requite the renewed confidence shown by his lord. In 1570, Nobunaga, while accompanied by a small escort, fell into an ambuscade of his enemies. It was Wada's bravery that prevented utter defeat and capture. Wada himself was severely wounded, so that he had to withdraw for a time from active duties. Much of this enforced leisure he used for receiving Christian instruction, He had already asked Froez to come and baptise him, when an attack upon his territories made him hasten to their defence, although his wounds were not yet healed. In the battle that followed he was slain. His brother Takayama then became master of the estates in Takatsuki and five years later gave them over to his son, who was then twenty-two years old.

It is time to turn back and see what had been happening in Kyushu. Although the desire to secure trade with the Portuguese had led the Daimyo of Mirado to grant the missionaries and their converts some privileges, he had no love for their religion. His eldest son and some of his principal retainers knew that they were in no danger of displeasing him by their open hostility to Christianity. Anthony Koteda was the object of much suspicion, which was increased by an intercepted letter in which Sumitada congratulated him on the success with which he was working to extend the Kingdom of Christ in his territories. Four men who brought this letter were put to death.\*

Some religious objects that had been brought from India for the adornment of the church in Hirado, had been seized by the unbelievers, and so came into the hands of one of the officials. He exposed a picture of the Virgin Mary to the mockery of the people after he had plucked out the eyes and otherwise disfigured it. The missionaries complained of this insult to their religion. As the Daimyo seemed disinclined to take up the matter, D'Acosta made use of means such as had formerly proved effective. By his request the Portuguese vessels held aloof from Hirado. After a while the Daimyo sent out a number of his warboats towards a ship that was seen on its way to a rival port, ordering them to make it come to Hirado or else to sink it. The attack was repulsed, many of the men from Hirado being slain.

In June, 1567, Juan Fernandez, who had come to Japan with Xavier, died at the age of forty-two. As he was not a priest, but only a lay brother, he occupies a less prominent place in the accounts of the Jesuits than does Xavier's other companion, Father Torres; but what is told of him encourages the opinion that no one deserves so much as he to be called the founder of the early Japanese Church. He was more successful than Xavier and Torres in learning the language. It is said, indeed, that Japanese became the only language that he commonly used, so that even in his death agony his prayers were in that tongue. He composed several books for the use of the Christians.

A few miles southwest from Hirado are the Goto Islands.\* In 1564 their ruler invited the missionaries to visit him, but it was not until 1568 that Brothers Almeida and Lawrence were able to respond to the call. They were lodged in the mansion of the Daimyo, whose family and chief retainers came to receive instruction. Just at that time the Daimyo became dangerously ill, whereupon the bonzes declared that this was a punishment sent upon him for introducing the foreign religion into his territories. Their arguments were considered to he sufficiently answered when the remedies prescribed by Almeida effected a remarkable cure. This was asserted to be a sign that heaven approved of what had been done. Shortly after this, however, a disastrous conflagration destroyed a large part of the city and at the same time the Daimyo began to suffer from a tumour on his hand. Almeida's medical skill relieved the latter trouble, but the loss resulting from the fire left the balance of accounts so unfavourable for the Jesuits that the people joined with the bonzes in demanding their expulsion. The Daimyo held out for a time, and there were some baptisms. Finally, however, Almeida and Lawrence withdrew. Two years later, the son of the Daimyo was secretly baptised with his wife and some of his vassals. The father, who at first seemed to approve this action, was afterwards led by the enemies of Christianity to make vain efforts for inducing the son to give up his faith, or at least to pretend that he had done so. He issued edicts against the Christians and was preparing to take active measures against them, when the son demanded that, if martyrs were to be made, he should be the first to suffer. The Daimyo finally assured the Christians that they would he left in peace. He died a few years later, while the enemies of Christianity were still' seeking a favourable opportunity to move against it. The son, on succeeding to the estates, showed great earnestness in trying to secure the conversion of ail his subjects. It is said that in the churches he would never tolerate any distinctions of rank, he himself sitting among the common people.\*

In 1566 the Lord of Shiki, on the island of Amakusa, was baptised with some of his vassals. When, however, he saw that his profession of Christianity did not help him to attract Portuguese traders to his ports, he lost interest in his new religion and began a persecution that led many of those who had followed him in receiving baptism to imitate him also in his apostasy.

Amakusa was divided among five petty lords under the suzerainty of Otomo Yoshishige. In 1568 one of these, the Daimyo of Hondo, asked that missionaries visit him. Warned by what had happened in Shiki, Almeida consented to go only on the conditions that there should be given written authorisation for him to preach; that for the first few days the Daimyo should by his own attendance on the services set a good example to his people; that, if the Christian doctrine was found good, one of the Daimyo's children should receive baptism as a guarantee that others could safely do so; and that the Daimyo should build a church.

These conditions were accepted. Hardly had the work of evangelisation begun when a revolt excited by the bonzes assumed such dimensions that Yoshishige had to send troops for the restoration of order. When the rebels had submitted, the Daimyo of Hondo was baptised \(1570\). Soon afterwards the rebellion broke out anew, and at length he issued an edict by which he banished the bonzes. He also warned the merchants who had assisted them by their contributions that they must either be converted or leave his territories.

In Omura Christianity was constantly gaming a stronger foothold. In place of Yokoseura, which had been destroyed at the time of the rebellion, another place was chosen as the port for foreign commerce, and soon what had been a little fishing village grew into the important city of Nagasaki. The Daimyo furnished funds for the erection of a church, which was dedicated in 1568.

Father Torres, the last of the little company of missionaries who first brought Christianity to Japan, died October 12, 1570, at the age of seventy-four. Shortly before this, Father Cabral had come to take his place as Vice-Provincial. A congregation of the Jesuits in Japan was summoned, all of them being present except Father Froez. As a result of the conference a re-arrangement of the Fathers was made as follows: the new names here appearing being those of persons that had lately arrived in the country:

De Monts in Bungo,    Lopes in Kochinotsu.

Acosta in Hirado,      Figueredo in Omura.

Valegnani in Goto,  Froez and Organtin in Kyoto.

Father Vilela's health was so impaired that he needed a change. He was therefore sent to India that he might report on the state of the mission and urge that more workers be sent. He died that same year shortly after reaching Malacca.

\* The night before Nugnez started from Goa, he and others were in the chapel renewing the vows of their order. Pinto was also present, and the Jesuits were surprised to hear his voice joining with theirs as they pledged themselves to chastity, obedience, and poverty. When some one would have stopped him, Nugnez made a sign that he should be allowed to proceed. This he did and also added another vow by which he consecrated himself and all his wealth to the use of the mission. At the close, the Provincial signified his acceptance of the profession; but, as Pinto was the envoy of the Viceroy, it was decided that he should make no change in his dress until he had finished his official business. Though Pinto gave large sums for the work in Japan, his zeal for a religious life soon grew cool. It was found advisable to release him from his vows and he returned to India with Nugnez.

\* A letter written in 1576 by Father Cabral shows that, though these works of charity may have recommended Christianity to some persons, yet with others they became stumbling-blocks because for a long time the ranks of believers were chiefly recruited from the poor and from those who had been healed of loathsome diseases.

Others were unwilling to profess a religion whose acceptance seemed to classify them with such persons. The Annual Letter of the Jesuits for 1579, written soon after the baptism of Yoshishige, says that hitherto the converts had been almost entirely confined to the poor and those that had come to the hospital, one result being that non-believers despised Christianity as being the religion of the indigent and diseased.

\* Some writers have asserted that in the early days of intercourse with Europeans the Japanese showed no trace of anti-foreign feeling and that Buddhists were guiltless of persecution until taught by the example that was set by the Christian missionaries and their converts. It will, however, he remembered that when Xavier was on his journey to Kyoto he was hooted by the children and pelted with stones; while the events above narrated unite with what happened in Yamaguchi, Bungo, and other places to show that, ere Christianity had gained sufficient strength to persecute, its followers were themselves the object of attack. The history of the Nichiren sect furnishes a proof that long before Christianity reached Japan, Buddhism knew how to persecute those whom it regarded as heretics.

\* We have little information about the later years of Anthony Koteda. This and other blanks in the history of the early missions may be partly because of the failures of letters sent from Japan to reach their destination. Anthony died a Christian death in 1582. Some of his descendants were prominent Christians.
