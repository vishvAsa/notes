  <meta property="og:description" content="JOHN SAKAI had not “been very long in his native province before he obtained permission to make a visit to Tokyo. Instead of returning home from that city, he went in May, 1873, to Hakodate. Though he sent word to the officials of the Colonisation Commission that he intended to reside there, he received nothing from them to show that they objected to this or were taking any notice of his presence. He was soon engaged as busily as ever in evangelistic work. At the beginning of the next year, however, the officials of his own prefecture sent a messenger to escort him back. He was brought to the prefectural office and asked why he had gone to Hakodate. To this he replied that, as his wife and child were living in that city, he had found it necessary to go there in order to provide for their support. He was then accused of using the name Sakai illegally. The name was, indeed, that of his ancestors; but his father had “married into another house” and so taken his wife’s name. After his son’s birth, the father had left his adopted house. The boy, after remaining for some years with the mother, had gone to the father, and on the latter’s death succeeded to his practice as a physician, at the same time assuming the name of Sakai. As there was some irregularity in this procedure, the officials took advantage of the opportunity it gave for bringing a charge against him. That this was used only as a pretext, was shown by the fact that the one who conducted the examination offered to release him on condition that he would renounce Christianity; but since he refused to do this, he was sent to prison for a month.">

  <p>JOHN SAKAI had not &ldquo;been very long in his native province before he obtained permission to make a visit to Tokyo. Instead of returning home from that city, he went in May, 1873, to Hakodate. Though he sent word to the officials of the Colonisation Commission that he intended to reside there, he received nothing from them to show that they objected to this or were taking any notice of his presence. He was soon engaged as busily as ever in evangelistic work. At the beginning of the next year, however, the officials of his own prefecture sent a messenger to escort him back. He was brought to the prefectural office and asked why he had gone to Hakodate. To this he replied that, as his wife and child were living in that city, he had found it necessary to go there in order to provide for their support. He was then accused of using the name Sakai illegally. The name was, indeed, that of his ancestors; but his father had &ldquo;married into another house&rdquo; and so taken his wife&rsquo;s name. After his son&rsquo;s birth, the father had left his adopted house. The boy, after remaining for some years with the mother, had gone to the father, and on the latter&rsquo;s death succeeded to his practice as a physician, at the same time assuming the name of Sakai. As there was some irregularity in this procedure, the officials took advantage of the opportunity it gave for bringing a charge against him. That this was used only as a pretext, was shown by the fact that the one who conducted the examination offered to release him on condition that he would renounce Christianity; but since he refused to do this, he was sent to prison for a month.</p>
<p>Soon after the expiration of this sentence, Dr. Sakai was again summoned to the office and asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is it that since being let out of prison you have broken your promise not to preach Christianity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never made such a promise,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;nevertheless, since my release, I have not attempted to do missionary work. When I go about my duties as a physician, people ask me questions concerning my religious views, and I must make some reply. I could not refuse to answer if they asked about Buddhism or Shintoism; still less, when their enquiries are about Christianity, If you forbid this, I am willing, for my disobedience, to suffer whatever you may inflict upon my body, but my spirit will not yield to such commands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At a later examination he was asked: &ldquo;Why not give up Christianity until the Government approves of it? Ought you not to do what it commands?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if it commands what is wrong. If it ordered me to steal, I should not obey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was condemned to eighty days&rsquo; incarceration. At that time it was customary to let out the labour of prisoners. Dr. Sakai was employed in the garden of a man who often came out to converse with him while he was at work. Religious subjects were introduced, and the man became so much interested that he continued to hire Dr. Sakai from day to day, often inviting him into the house, where they could converse more at ease. The officials said in one of their reports that it was useless to imprison such a person as Dr. Sakai, for while at work he was preaching to his employer, and after the day&rsquo;s labour was over he taught his doctrines to the other prisoners. Among the latter he gained considerable influence. They thought him a strange person, but could not fail to honour his upright character. When disputes arose among them, he was chosen to act as their judge. To keep him in prison was nearly equivalent to placing a Christian chaplain there.</p>
<p>While Dr. Sakai was in Hakodate, Mr. Semba, the young man whom he had led to Christianity at the time of his first recall to Tome, was teaching his new faith to the people about him. The Buddhist and Shinto priests soon accused him of sacrilegious acts, and had him sentenced to prison for three months. He also was earnest in teaching his fellow-prisoners. One of them became a believer, and promised that as soon as released, he would go to Tokyo for baptism. This person, however, was soon sentenced to death for his crimes. He was much distressed at the thought of not receiving the rite that would admit him into the Church. Therefore, on the morning that the man was to be led out for execution, Mr. Semba took some water from a teakettle and baptised him. Then, kneading some boiled rice into dough, he strengthened it with threads drawn from his clothes, so as to mold it into the form of a cross, which the criminal wore about his neck as he went to meet death.</p>
<p>Preaching places were gradually opened in different parts of Tokyo, and these were manned by those who were receiving instruction from Père Nicolai. Some of these also made visits to Nagoya, Kyoto, Osaka, and other places. They reported that everywhere abundant openings for the Gospel were found.</p>
<p>With the increasing number of evangelists, a difference arose in the views of those in Tokyo and those in Sendai, concerning the policy that should govern missionary operations. Père Nicolai, therefore, called all of them together for a council that met in May, 1874. Several days were spent in consulting about the interests of the work, and in drawing up a new set of rules. According to these regulations, there were to be two classes of workers; viz., evangelists and assistant evangelists. The duties and salaries of these persons were prescribed. Changes in the location of evangelists were to be decided by the Tokyo Church as the metropolitan. While making the proclamation of the Gospel their chief work, the evangelists might employ their spare time in any occupation for which they were fitted, and thus, by their industry, be an example to believers. They could admit persons to the number of catechumens. They ought to give lodging in their houses to persons from other places who came with a desire to learn about Christianity. If such a person were poor, he might be fed for three days at the expense of the general fund. If among the poor students should be found such as appeared proper persons to become evangelists, they might be supported for three months or more from the general fund; and after examination, the Tokyo Church should decide upon the time when they should come to it for further study. Those selected to become evangelists should be between seventeen and forty years of age, pious, intelligent, and without such hindrances on account of family affairs as would keep them from making missionary tours. Young men between twelve and seventeen years of age, of upright character and good mental ability, might be sent to school in Tokyo; those of them that intended to enter the service of the Church must have their parents&rsquo; permission for spending seven years in study. Plans should be made for schools where children could receive both secular and religious teaching. For the instruction of women and girls there should be women evangelists and special schools. Evangelists should appoint in each church under their care two or three persons to serve as assistants; these should labour for the spread of the Gospel and the strengthening of the churches, besides caring for the families of the evangelists when the latter were absent on missionary tours. Though local churches should manage their own affairs without interference from others, the salaries of evangelists in some of the smaller places were to be sent through the superintendent of the district in which they belonged. At this meeting the fields of labour for over thirty evangelists were determined.</p>
<p>One of the rules that Père Nicolai had drawn up about 1869 for the Association of Evangelists that he hoped to form, was to the effect that when the number of baptised believers reached five hundred, one of the evangelists should be selected for ordination to the priesthood. The prosperity that had attended the work of the Mission had been such as to justify the carrying into effect what this rule prescribed, and the visit of a Russian bishop to Hakodate in 1875 was utilised for securing the ordination of Mr. Sawabe as a priest and of Dr. Sakai as a deacon. In 1878 five evangelists went to Vladivostock for ordination to the priesthood.</p>
<p>The most marked progress of the period under consideration was in the section of the country that has Sendai for its centre. The number of Christians in the city of Sendai and their influence were constantly increasing. In May, 1876, they took upon themselves the financial support of one of the evangelists. Some of the other evangelists in that place were unwilling either to be a burden to their brethren or to receive help from the Mission. They therefore decided to support themselves by labour or trade, giving only their spare time to teaching Christianity. Their withdrawal to this extent from evangelistic labours was regarded with so much concern by the Church that a meeting was held in which it was decided to ask them to devote themselves as before to the propagation of Christianity. Mr. Ono consented to become an evangelist again, though he continued to provide for his own support, as he was in possession of some property. The others refused to comply with the request, whereupon Père Nicolai sent them a letter in which he commended their desire not to be burdensome to the Church, but said that, while they needed little for their support, it took most of their time to gain that little, and it would be better for them to present this time to God by using it for the benefit of the Church. Some of them finally consented to follow his advice that they accept support from the general fund used for the work of the Mission. When Père Nicolai visited Sendai in 1877, a meeting of the Christians was held to consult with him concerning evangelistic efforts, one of the decisions being to divide the city into five parishes.</p>
<p>In 1877 Mr. Ono began to publish what is said to have been the first magazine in Northeastern Japan. The articles, which dealt with moral, literary, and educational, as well as strictly religious subjects, attracted considerable attention and did much to put new ideas into the minds of the educated classes. The evangelists also arranged a course of public lectures that were held twice a month. Though the subjects were largely secular and some of the speakers were not Christians, the lectures of the evangelists often turned to Christian themes, while their efforts in seeking the enlightenment of the people helped to recommend their religion.</p>
<p>In 1874, when Dr. Sakai and Mr. Semba were under arrest in Tome, two merchants from Sanuma were in the former town on business. Hearing of what had happened, their curiosity was aroused to know the nature of the religion that brought upon its followers the opposition of the officials. In an interview that they managed to obtain with Dr. Sakai they were much impressed by what he told them. After his release he visited them in Sanuma, which was only seven miles from Tome, Fearing that they would bring trouble upon themselves, the merchants were at first very careful not to let others know that they were studying Christianity; but, after they became believers, they no longer wished to keep it to themselves, and so they commenced telling others of their new faith. The town was visited by different evangelists, one of whom took up his abode there. From the first the work progressed so rapidly that in 1875 fifty-three persons were baptised; in 1876, one hundred; in 1877, ninety-three. In 1876 considerable opposition was aroused against Christianity because one of the believers, with the idea of showing the folly of idol worship, dragged an image from a shrine that stood on his land, chopped it to pieces, and then destroyed the shrine. He and eleven others that had taken some part in the matter were brought before the courts and fined. In 1879 a church building was completed at a cost of some three thousand <em>yen.</em> Rev. Paul Sawabe then urged upon the believers the desirability of having the building provided with the various utensils used in the ceremonies of the Greek Church, whereupon the women brought their hair-ornaments, some of which had considerable value, as contributions towards the cost of what was needed.</p>
<p>Besides Sanuma, several other towns in the vicinity of Sendai were visited by evangelists, so that there were few places of any importance that did not have believers in Christianity. In some places church buildings were erected and schools established. In several towns the Christians raised funds that were invested so that the interest might be used for the support of the church or else added to the original fund until a sufficient amount should have been gained for a church edifice or some other object. In some cases land was purchased and cultivated by the Christians. At one time the fund at Sanuma amounted to several thousand <em>yen.</em></p>
<p>In 1879 Père Anatolius, having been appointed Chaplain to the Russian Legation, removed from Hakodate to Tokyo. After this, other Russian priests went to Hakodate, but none of them stayed for any great length of time, and ere long the care of the Church in that city and the work of carrying Christianity to other parts of Yezo were committed to Japanese priests and evangelists. It is one of the noteworthy features of the Holy Orthodox Church in Japan that it has depended so little upon the personal labours of foreigners. Much of the time Père Nicolai was the only one in the country, and at no other time has he had more than five or six European assistants.</p>
<p>As with the Protestants and Roman Catholics, the members of this Church early began to show that they had learned from the second of Christ&rsquo;s great commandments the duty of charity. About 1873 the Christian women of Hakodate formed a society whose purpose was in part to help the poor. Their zeal stirred up that of the men. Among the gifts of that year was a sum of money sent for the relief of those who were suffering from a famine in Russia. In Sendai and other places there were societies that lent money, sometimes with and sometimes without interest, to members of the churches. Some of the funds were given outright to those that would be unable to repay. In 1875, when the overflowing of a river caused great distress among the poor in Sanuma, the Christians of that place took measures for their relief. Rice was purchased, and at night members of the Church, covering their faces so as not to be recognised, carried this to about a hundred poor families and gave it over without letting it be known whence it came.</p>
<p>Trouble frequently arose in connection with the burial of the dead. In January, 1875, the father of a young girl that had died in Hakodate gave the usual notice to the officials and told the Buddhist priests of his intention to have a Christian burial. He was soon summoned to the office and told that only Buddhist or Shinto rites could be allowed. To this he replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My daughter was a Christian and so am I. To have a heathen ceremony would be to disobey the commands of the true God, and so I cannot permit such to be performed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Christian rites are contrary to law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must obey God. If by so doing I offend against the laws of the land, I must submit to the punishment that awaits me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of the friends advised that the burial should be in a cemetery that had been set apart for the use of foreigners, over which the priests had no control; but the father said that this was something to which a Japanese ought not to consent, and rather than do it, he would suffer the penalty that might be incurred by violating the law. Finally the burial took place in a piece of ground that Père Anatolius succeeded in renting for a cemetery, and though the father was afterwards summoned before the officials, no punishment was inflicted upon him.</p>
<p>About the same time a similar case occurred in Sendai, where the person responsible for the burial was sentenced to thirty days&rsquo; imprisonment. The relatives sent in a petition that led to an amelioration of the punishment, so that the man was not taken to prison but confined in his own house. In another place a man was sentenced to prison for forty days; but in view of the fact that he had followed the dying wish of his relatives, he was released on the payment of three <em>yen.</em></p>
