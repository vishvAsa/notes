title = "09 JAPAN IN WAR AND IN PEACE 1904-1909"

+++

IN February, 1904, Japan again found herself engaged in war; this time with one of the nations of Christendom. Among some of the Buddhists there was at first an inclination to utilise the enmity of the people against Russia as a means for exciting a similar feeling against Christianity; but this attempt met little encouragement, being frowned upon by the Government and by leaders of national thought, who saw how important it was that Japan should preserve the good opinion and, if possible, have the moral support of Western nations, especially of England, with which it was in alliance, and of America, whose friendship at such a time would be of great value. It was doubtless such reasons that led Count Katsura, the Prime Minister, to invite a missionary, Rev. W. M. Imbrie, D.D., to call upon him and hear some things that it was desirable to have brought to the attention of the people of America, whither the missionary was about going on a furlough. The interview lasted nearly two hours, and the account that Dr. Imbrie wrote of it was afterwards submitted to the Prime Minister for his certification to its correctness. Among other things Count Katsura said in combating the arguments that Russia would be likely to use in seeking to prejudice Americans in her favour were the following:

"The argument against Japan is sometimes put in this form; Russia stands for Christianity and Japan stands for Buddhism. The truth is that Japan stands for religious freedom. In Japan a man may be a Buddhist, a Christian, or even a Jew, without suffering for it That is a principle embodied in her Constitution; and her practice is in accordance with that principle. There are Christian churches in every large city and in almost every large town in Japan; and all have complete freedom to teach and worship in accordance with their own convictions. There are numerous Christian newspapers and magazines which obtain their licenses precisely as other newspapers and magazines; and as a matter of course, Christian schools, some of them conducted by foreigners and some by Japanese, are found everywhere. . . . Japanese Christians are not confined to any one rank or class. They are to be found among the members of the National Diet, the judges in the courts, the professors in the universities, the editors of leading secular papers, and the officers of the army and navy. Therefore, to say that Japan stands for religious freedom is simply to say what is patent to all; and to abandon that principle, either now or in the future, would be to violate the Constitution, and would create deep dissatisfaction throughout all Japan. What then becomes of the argument that japan stands for Buddhism?"\*

Rev. Honda Yoitsu, who had a meeting with the Prime Minister and the Minister of War to present a request of the Japan Evangelical Alliance for the appointment of Christian chaplains to the army, was asked to convey to the churches a message from the former official in which he said:

"At the commencement of the war with Russia one subject, which gave me no small anxiety, was the danger of misconception and confusion of thought arising from racial and religious differences, and the dissemination of opinions calculated to foster mutual recriminations between the people of different nationalities and religious beliefs. . . . As I had feared, numerous cases of religious rancour have occurred in different localities, indignities being heaped upon believers of the Greek Church, and even damage done to church property. Moreover, failing to discriminate between one foreigner and another, and between one Christian denomination and another, some have, unfortunately, at sight of a Christian allowed themselves to be filled with feelings of suspicion and distrust, and been guilty of rude behaviour. Such things I deeply deplore. . . . As the present war is one carried on against Russia— a professedly Christian nation—I have felt that redoubled efforts should be made that no unworthy sentiments should be tolerated, that we should adopt a thoroughly unbiassed and equitable attitude toward all, and that the whole nation should give practical effect to the policy so clearly set forth in the Imperial edict that this is a war which has no other object than the safety of the Empire and the peace of the Far East. I sincerely hope that no one will be betrayed into the error of supposing that such things as differences in race or religion have anything whatever to do with the present complication. I had indeed thought of issuing an official instruction on the subject in the near future, but I wish through you to convey to the Christian churches and the foreign missionaries our mind at this time, so that all misgivings and misunderstandings may be prevented."\*

Those high in office were not the only ones desirous of making it evident that the war was not a contest between religions. On May 16, 1904, there was held at Tokyo a meeting of representatives of different religions. The following extract from the call for the meeting shows its purpose:

"It is a matter for much regret to us that there are those abroad who are seeking to alienate from Japan the feeling of the West by representing the war as simply one between races, and in some cases as a conflict in which Russia stands for Christianity and Japan for Buddhism. Equally also it is a cause for regret that instances are reported of an exhibition of anti-foreign spirit on the part of narrow-minded men in Japan, and of a readiness to make use of what presents itself to them as an opportunity to advance by means injurious to others the interests of their own religious faith. These facts lay a special responsibility upon the representative men of all the religions in the Empire. While it is the duty of all such to guide the people in matters of religion and to inculcate love of country in a manner accordant with their own faith and conscience, it is also the duty of all to cultivate the great principles of universal peace and love, not in the interest of any one creed or cult, but rather for the benefit of all men. More particularly they should endeavour to make it clear abroad that the war is not a conflict of race against race or of religion against religion, but one entered, into solely for the rightful interests of Japan; and at home, while using every proper means to bind the whole nation together as one man in its contest to secure an honourable peace, they should be forward in effort to discountenance any spirit of extreme nationalism or of animosity between religions."

Those in attendance at the meetings, numbering about a thousand, included Japanese and foreigners; Shintoists, Buddhists, Roman Catholics, Greek Catholics, and Protestants of different denominations. The speeches that were made and the resolutions that were passed were in accord with the sentiments expressed in the call for the meeting.

It was evidently at one time the plan of the Government to permit some Christians to go with the army as chaplains. Count Katsura in his interview with Dr. Imbrie had declared his purpose to do this. For some reason, however, the plan was not put into execution. Instead of this, the Young Men's Christian Association was allowed to enter upon a work in behalf of the soldiers which, though at first looked upon with little favour by some of the military officers, soon gained the approval of the highest authorities, and little by little won over those on the field who in the beginning had regarded it with indifference or suspicion. It was in August, 1904, that permission was finally obtained for the operations of the "Soldiers' Comforting Department of the Young Men's Christian Association Union." One foreign and two Japanese secretaries at once set out for the seat of war. Arriving at Antung, they found that those in command there had received no communication concerning them; their help was not desired, and the foreigner was regarded with great suspicion. The party therefore returned to Chinampho, where the commandant was more favourable and furnished them with rooms in the second story of the building used by the Japanese civil administration. This place soon became a favourite resort for the soldiers. In a few days a telegram called them to Antung, where instructions had at last been received from Tokyo and where they now met a kind reception from the officers, who placed a building at their disposal. It was now the soldiers that were shy and suspicious. Kindness shown to the few that first ventured into the rooms and to the patients in the hospital soon wrought a change, and the rooms became recognised as the most comfortable and indeed the only comfortable place in the city for the soldiers to spend their leisure hours. Visits were made by officers from other posts. Their impression of what was being done and the reports that began to spread abroad about the work were so favourable that it became easy to get permission to begin operations at other military centres. More workers were sent out, most of them being Japanese, as there was more readiness to allow them to go into the territory where war was actually in progress. Some of them travelled about from place to place, visiting the more lonely garrisons or advancing with the army nearly to the fighting line. Some extracts from the published reports will give an idea of the methods that were adopted.

"The plan has been to make the buildings a social, recreational, and religious centre for all troops, supplying everything possible to attract, appeal to, and console the men far from home. The result has been that all classes and conditions of men have been appealed to and have greatly appreciated the benefits received. The work has centred around the reading, correspondence, game, and assembly rooms. There have been for the free use of the men letter-paper, envelopes, postal cards, and writing materials, daily newspapers, monthly magazines, and books of general interest. The gramophones have been the most popular of all attractions, and constant use has been made of organs, accordions, and other simple musical instruments. Among more practical articles have been razors, hair-clippers, and soap, the latter for toilet and laundry purposes. Hot water has been provided, and men by the hundreds have availed themselves of the opportunity to do their own washing. Thousands of buttons of various shapes have been supplied for those which had been lost, and goods for patches have lengthened the life of and made more comfortable many suits of clothing. Pamphlets, tracts, and Scriptures have been distributed in large numbers, generous contributions having been made by the Bible Societies and the Japan Book and Tract Society. Social gatherings, lantern exhibitions, singing clubs, and evening classes have been maintained and attended by multitudes. The religious work has been at no place forced from the start, but the secretaries have been on the constant watch for opportunities to make the beginning. Within three weeks of opening the first Association, a weekly Bible class was begun and attended by seventy men. Within two weeks, at the request of soldiers, the sessions were increased to three per week, all well attended, and the soldiers were asking for more. At every point Bible classes, Gospel, prayer, and enquiry meetings, and personal work have been conducted, comprising a vigorous and constant religious campaign.

"Words can convey no adequate impression of what the Association meant to the men during the winter of 1905 when at both Antung and at Yinkow the harbours were closed for four months. Through the long, cold, dreary winter day the men wrapped in their great-coats and blankets lay crowded on the floor of the great barn-like oilmills that did duty as hospital wards, and then through the longer, drearier, colder winter night with almost no light, they watched through the seemingly endless hours until the morning. Some men died from sheer loneliness and despair, and it was as the surgeons said, that many of the men needed the help of the Association more than they needed medicine. The men who came back from the capture of Mukden weary, many of them with the blood still clotted in their long unkempt hair, found at the Christian Comforting Place for the first time in weeks hot water, soap, barber's implements, and willing hands to help those who could not help themselves; the men who after the fall of Port Arthur and the midwinter march overland toward the front found at the Association much desired writing materials, good cheer, and a touch of home com fort,—none of these men will ever forget the service of the Jesus religion. Hundreds of thousands of men, welcomed and cheered on their return from the front, gave glad testimony to their appreciation with their *'Banzai* for the Y, M. C. A*.'"*

Letters from many military officers of high rank testified to their appreciation of this work, but an endorsement that attracted the attention of the whole country was the gift of ten thousand *yen* received by the Association from the Emperor and Empress. This was made after the officials of the Imperial Household had carefully examined what was being done. Other generous contributions were given by wealthy Japanese merchants.

As we have seen to be the case in so many other movements, the Buddhists paid to the Christians the tribute of imitation. Their efforts were praiseworthy, yet for some reason or other, where their rooms and those of the Christian Associations were in the same city, the latter drew manifold the number of visitors. A Buddhist newspaper said:

"The enormous amount of two hundred thousand *Yen* has been expended by the Shin sect for the work among the soldiers, but it is far inferior to the work of the Christian Association, whose expenditure amounts to only a few thousand *Yen,* The latter's quarters are regarded as a paradise for the soldiers, and the Association is everywhere welcome."

The Young Men's Association was not alone in seeking the material and spiritual welfare of the soldiers. Though its representatives were the only ones permitted as Christian workers to go to the seat of war, others could engage in efforts for troops on their way to the front and for the many sick and wounded that were brought back to Japan. At the railroad stations where the trains conveying soldiers made prolonged stops, Christians, and especially Christian women, joined with others in performing kindly offices, such as serving tea, sewing on buttons, re-arranging bandages, etc. Religious literature was also distributed. Sometimes the pupils of a girls' school or other companies of Christians would sing for the soldiers. In one prominent city when this was done for the first time the prefectural governor, who was on the platform of the railroad station, was so moved that his eyes filled with tears, and it was at his request that copies of the hymns were printed so that on future occasions they might be distributed among the men. The latter were often able to catch the tune sufficiently well to keep on singing as the train bore them on their way. It was pleasant to see that these efforts of the Christians seldom met with any opposition. Often the non-Christian members of the patriotic societies that went to cheer the soldiers would ask for bundles of tracts or hymns that they might help in giving them to the men who were stretching out their hands to receive them. In one place a Buddhist priest sometimes helped in this distribution of Christian literature. Buddhist tracts were also circulated; but they of course had less of novelty for the soldiers, who were therefore much more eager to get those of the Christians, especially when the latter were distributed by a foreign lady.

The most favourable place for Christian work was among the thousands that were brought back to Japan sick or wounded. In many of the hospitals permission was given missionaries and other Christians to go in and out as they pleased during certain hours of the day. The physicians said that they welcomed anything, otherwise unobjectionable, that took the thoughts of the patients away from themselves. Some of the hospitals had large recreation halls where companies of Christians could entertain the soldiers with music or stereopticon exhibitions, and in connection with these entertainments there was usually no objection to addresses on religious subjects. Sometimes the Christian worker would visit the separate wards, and as he got into conversation with individuals he would soon find himself surrounded by most of the occupants of the ward, if they were not too sick to walk, some perhaps hobbling up on crutches, others with heads bandaged, who sat on the edges of the beds or upon the benches placed about the charcoal fires that heated the room. There was no need of beating about the bush trying in some round-about way to reach the subject of religion. Every one of the patients bore the red cross on his sleeve, and a reference to that symbol, which had been the sign of kindly help when he lay wounded on the battle-field, opened the way for speaking at once of Him who had caused the cross to become the emblem of love and salvation. The long hours were made less wearisome to many a homesick boy by the kind words spoken to him, the new thoughts put in his mind, and the Christian literature that was left for his perusal. Some became Christians while in the hospital, and it was doubtless true of others that the impressions there received made them more open to Christian influences after they returned to their homes.

Of many incidents connected with the hospitals, one may serve as a specimen. A bright young fellow who had lost both eyes wrote as follows to the person that had brought him cheer and comfort:

"I married a beautiful young woman just a month before being ordered to the front, and life looked very bright to me. It was a star of hope; but when I fell crushed by a shell, how I longed for death. Must I go back with a face so disfigured that my wife would look on me with horror, and I could never see her face again nor any of those whom I loved? The torture of mind was worse than the excruciating agony I endured from the physical pain.

"When it seemed I must live, I in my mind planned to take my own life. Why not? It was honourable not to be a burden to my beloved ones, and I could never see the little son that was born in February; but when your missionaries came to the hospital and sang even the first hymn, I began to see with my soul; and when you prayed I began to pray, and light came in little by little. You gave me a Bible, but I was dependent on some one else to read to me. But even in this I saw a way to reach others, and the thought of suicide left me.

"Then a day came when you brought me a Bible with raised characters that I could feel. It was the Gospel of John, and in a week I had learned the characters, read six chapters, and could find my place. My comrades who pitied me so much would come to hear me read, and it seemed to them almost a miracle. Then you brought me the blind man's tablet, so that now I can write. . . . Yes, I have now light in the darkness."

At the close of the war, opportunities came for work among the returning soldiers. In Manchuria, the Young Men's Christian Association had its workers so stationed along the railroad leading to the port of embarkation that there was hardly a regiment that did not come under their influence, and most of the soldiers not only shared in the acts of kindness, but also listened to the preaching of the Gospel.

"Every train-load of troops by night or by day was welcomed at least once on the journey and cheered with familiar music and a short Christian talk, while at the termini, thanks to the help and co-operation of the military officials, great halls fully equipped were provided for the amusement and instruction of the returning soldiers. How effective this work was is shown by the testimony of the head of the military police at Dairen, who said that before the establishment of the temperance canteen and the Y. M. C. A. at that place it was no uncommon thing for a hundred and fifty men and officers to slip by the pickets to resort to the disreputable places of amusement in the city, but that after the establishment of these respectable places of amusement there were never more than ten men in a day who sought the baser places in the city. The extent to which the buildings were used is shown by the statement of a Christian cavalryman, who had known the Association at Fengwangcheng, that on his return he tried repeatedly to get inside, but that always at night the place was like a black mountain of humanity and that it was utterly impossible to get inside."

In Japan itself the work for the returning troops was much like that which had been done for them on their way to the war. In some places also, Christian societies tried to shield them from the evils attending their reception by an enthusiastic populace. At Asahigawa in the island of Yezo, where seventeen thousand soldiers that had gone to the war from that district were to he welcomed back, the local temperance society, under the leadership of a missionary lady, petitioned the city authorities that the reception might be given without the use of intoxicating liquor and the employment of dancing-girls. After considerable hesitation the request was granted. The ladies of the society not only helped in serving out tea, but also sang songs of welcome and gave tracts and illustrated cards to both officers and men. The temperance society in the city of Kanazawa was likewise able to induce those in charge of the reception to dispense with *sake,* thus preventing the disgraceful scenes that in many places accompanied the return of the victors.

In the time of war and in the immediately succeeding months, hundreds of thousands while on their way to or from the field, or while in Manchuria, or while in the hospitals, heard something about Christianity. So far as could be judged by outward signs, they were favourably impressed by what they heard. Almost never was any opposition shown; on the contrary, there was much eagerness to get near the speaker and to obtain the books that were being distributed. At the close of the war the survivors were scattered throughout the length and breadth of the land, so that in almost every hamlet there were those who, if anything was said about Christianity, were likely to have some such thought as: "It was a Christian tent in Manchuria where I found a pleasant place to rest and where paper was furnished for the letter that told my friends I was unharmed;" or; "After a long night's ride on a jolting car, when my bandage became disarranged, a foreign lady came to wash my wound and bind it up again, and when I asked, 'Why do you, a foreigner, do such disagreeable work as this?' she said, 'It is for Christ's sake,' and gave me a book to show me the meaning of her words;" or: "When I was in the hospital, some one came and told me that the red cross I wore on my sleeve first got its meaning from the death by crucifixion of One who came to save us from the power of sin." In the ways thus indicated and in many another the seed had been sown and, even though nothing else came from it, one of its fruits was the wide diffusion of some knowledge of Christianity and the lessening of popular prejudice against it as something to be feared by every right-minded person.

Those that go to the battle-field are not the only sufferers; perhaps they are not the chief sufferers from war. The pay of the Japanese soldier was not sufficient to enable him to do much for his friends at home. Especially after the reserves were called out, many families deprived of those who had been the chief wage-earners were left in a destitute condition. In most of the cities the Christians formed societies for giving aid to such families. After a while their ability to do this was greatly increased by contributions of over forty thousand *yen* sent from America and entrusted to the Japanese Evangelical Alliance and the Standing Committee of Co-operating Christian Missions. Two thousand *yen* of this money was transferred to Bishop Nicolai for the benefit of the Russian prisoners, and a like sum to one of the national relief societies as a symbol of the sympathy of foreign friends; but most was sent to local societies or to Christian orphanages. The local societies seemed to use the funds wisely in consultation with government officials, and in several places they expended it in fitting up workrooms where poor women could engage in such occupations as sewing clothes to supply the needs of the army.

When news reached japan of the signing of the treaty of peace at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, September 5, 1905, there was much popular dissatisfaction with its terms. Disappointment was great because Russia had not been compelled to pay an indemnity, and because it was allowed to retain part of Saghalien. In several cities the populace took violent methods of expressing its dissatisfaction with a ministry that had consented to what was styled a disgraceful peace. In Tokyo a mob burned electric cars, police boxes, and a few buildings. Many persons that took part in this uprising did so, not so much because of objections to the conditions of peace, as because it gave an opportunity to show their opposition to the Government and to vent their spite against the electric railway company which, by taking away the work of the jinrikisha-pullers and in other ways had incurred the enmity of the lower classes. It became necessary to call out troops to aid the police in quelling the disturbance, and for several weeks the city was under martial law. A few lives were lost in connection with these riots. Among the buildings destroyed were one Roman Catholic church and two belonging to Protestants, while some others were injured. At first it was thought that these acts were inspired by hatred of Christianity; but it soon became evident that, though such a feeling may have been present with some of the rioters, it was not the chief cause for the attacks upon the churches. To assign reasons for the acts of an unreasoning mob is a task involving a paradox, and it is doubtful how much weight should be given to those that have been suggested in this case. It is said by some that the remarks of a Christian preacher in favour of peace excited the mob against the religion of which he was a representative; very likely the thought of Christianity as a foreign religion led to a feeling of enmity on the part of those that thought Western nations had used their influence in favour of a cessation of hostilities; and some persons who would have hesitated about injuring a dwelling-house may have been led by the spirit of mischief to make the churches the objects of their attack, especially since their glass windows made tempting targets for missiles. When the city was put under martial law, the authorities, who very much feared that these events would be considered in Western lands to be signs of an anti-Christian sentiment, took particular care to see that the churches and preaching-places were duly protected.

The better class of citizens felt that the riot with its attack on Christian edifices had brought disgrace upon the city. What was called the Congress of Religionists, made up of Shintoists, Buddhists, and Christians, resolved to make good the losses suffered by the Christians. For this purpose they raised from religious circles, chiefly Buddhist, about five thousand *yen,* and then by appeals to statesmen, bankers, merchants, and others secured enough to bring up the sum to over thirteen thousand *yen,* which in December, 1906, was given over to the Christian churches for the reimbursement of their losses. Though patriotic motives were probably the ones that had the most influence with the contributors to this fund, the act must be taken as a sign of sympathy and of friendliness towards followers of an alien faith.

The gift made by the Emperor and Empress to the Young Men's Christian Association was not the only proof of a friendly feeling on the part of Their Majesties towards the religion of which that organisation was one of the exponents. The previous year the Emperor and the Crown Prince had contributed to the funds of the Okayama Orphanage; and now at about the same time with the gift to the Association an annuity of one thousand *yen* a year for ten years was promised to the Orphanage; one thousand *yen* were also given to Mr. Hara's Home for Discharged Prisoners; and a little later a like sum was bestowed on Mr. Tomeoka's Home School for Wayward Children. Some foreign opponents of Christianity had tried to argue that the gift to the Association had no religious significance; but this selection of four prominent Christian institutions as recipients of the Imperial bounties made it plain that their work was appreciated and that the religious faith of their founders was not regarded with disfavour. Another recognition of Christian philanthropy was the bestowal \(January, 1906\) of the Decoration of the Blue Ribbon upon Miss Riddell for her efforts in behalf of lepers.

A decoration had previously been bestowed upon Miss McLean who, after spending some years as a missionary in Japan, returned to England, where she took great interest in the Japanese sailors that went to that country. In this way she often met the officers and men of the Japanese navy who were sent to take charge of war vessels constructed in England, or to participate in such festivities as Queen Victoria's Jubilee or the Coronation of Edward VII. After a while a society "for Church-work among Japanese seamen in British ports" was formed. It secured a Japanese for a chaplain, and sustained a "Mission Club," where sailors could find not only lodgings in helpful surroundings, but also sympathy, advice, and recreation. Many men connected with the navy were led to a Christian faith through the influence of this Club.

Somewhat similar work in Japan itself was carried on in the "Army and Navy Mission Club" at Yokosuka, an important naval station near Yokohama. The funds for establishing this were contributed chiefly by foreign friends in japan and America, but afterwards much of its support came from those who were receiving its benefits. An American lady and a Japanese gentleman superintended its operations. "The core of the Club's work has been teaching the Bible and Christian doctrine to the men introduced by members, and bringing to bear all the influences of personal friendship and good cheer, prayer and persuasion, to lead them into the Christian life."When men were removed to other stations the Club kept in touch with them by means of correspondence, courses of Bible study, and monthly reports. Branches were established in other naval stations.

Such efforts as the above help to account for the strong foothold that Christianity obtained in the Japanese navy. Mention has previously been made of Rear Admiral Serata, who died shortly before the Russo-Japanese War. The first victory in that conflict was won by another Christian, Rear Admiral Uryu. Two of Admiral Togo's personal staff were Christians, as were many other officers and men that had an honourable part in the naval manœuvres and battles.

Even such an institution as the Army and Navy Mission Club could not wholly escape the suspicion with which many persons still regarded Christianity. At the beginning of the war there was considerable excitement about Russian spies. Foreign travellers were regarded with suspicion, especially if they were seen examining maps or taking notes. Evangelists, colporteurs, and even ordinary Christians were sometimes accused of being in the pay of Russia. A conflagration that destroyed two hundred buildings at Yokosuka originated in the house of a person connected with the Mission Club, and, notwithstanding that all his family, consisting of six members, perished in the flames, the rumour quickly spread that he was a Russian spy, and that he had burned the house in order to destroy evidences of his guilt. One day crowds gathered on the parade-ground to witness his court-martial and execution, which it had been reported were to take place there.

A few of the Christians did not look upon the war with the same sentiments as most of their fellow-countrymen. Among them were those who believed that the Gospel of Christ forbade its followers to take up the sword. The writings of Tolstoi had found many readers in Japan, and while most of those that were ready to accept his views on other points broke away from his teaching concerning non-resistance, there were some who followed him in this doctrine also. Others who ventured to speak against the war were the socialists. It is not strange that socialism gained some adherents from among those who had been taught by Christianity the brotherhood of man, and who, in seeking ways of helping others, had been led to consider the social problems which, with the introduction of the modern industrial system, were arising in Japan as they had in Western lands. For several years before the war the socialists, some of whose leaders were connected or had once been connected with Christian churches, had shown considerable activity in publishing pamphlets and newspapers, in lecturing, and in forming societies of workingmen. Their efforts had several times brought them into conflict with the Government, so that their meetings had often been cut short by the police, or their newspapers suspended. They had the courage of their convictions so that when the war was imminent and after it broke out they did not hesitate to denounce it. Public sentiment in Japan was so nearly unanimous in favour of the war that this opposition did not attract so much attention as might have been expected. Probably most persons looked upon the socialists as a set of visionaries from whom any kind of eccentricity might be expected. Moreover, there was among students and workingmen—the classes most likely to take active measures against those incurring their dislike-considerable sympathy with the socialists in their denunciation of social abuses and desire for reform; hence, there was less bitter feeling against them on account of their views respecting war.

In the course of this history we have already seen how strong was the desire of the Japanese Christians for independence. They disliked to be in any way under the direction of the missions. In some churches, owing to the system of government, the missionaries had more or less ecclesiastical authority, and in denominations where this was disclaimed, it was thought that their power to give or withhold mission funds gave them actual control over the churches that were aided by them. Pastors and evangelists that received from missions a part of their salaries felt that non-believers regarded them as hirelings; and those of their associates who ministered to self-supporting churches were inclined to nourish that feeling and to declare that the former were not free to adopt desirable methods of work, or to teach the doctrines they really believed when these were not such as the foreigners favoured.

While the missionaries regretted some of the ways in which the spirit of independence manifested itself, most of them were glad for its existence, and rejoiced in the desire of the Japanese to develop churches that should be self-governing, self-supporting, and self-propagating. It cannot be denied, however, that some missionaries were very slow to relinquish any powers that they possessed, while there were a very few who said that they did not care to have the churches with which they were connected become self-supporting. This last class of missionaries should not be charged with being governed by selfish motives. They believed it would be much safer for foreigners to keep control in their own hands until the churches and the ministry had been so well grounded in the faith and accustomed to correct ecclesiastical methods that, when at last set free, they would not depart from the way in which they had been trained to walk. So long as preachers were largely dependent on foreign funds for their salaries they would be careful to preach and labour as the missionary desired instead of running off into all sorts of vagaries in doctrine and method, as was likely to be the case with those whose knowledge of Christianity was not very profound and who had few personal incentives to caution in laying the old aside and adopting what was new.

As might be expected, the great progress made by the nation, and its victory over Russia intensified the desire of the Christians to show that they were able to manage their own ecclesiastical affairs and to take the lead in the conflict against the forces of unbelief and sin. Many members of the Seikokwai \(Episcopal Church\) were not happy in the thought that their bishops were chosen by the ecclesiastical authorities in England and America, and a new impetus was now given to efforts for raising a fund to endow a Japanese episcopate, it being understood that one of their own clergy would be appointed whenever a fund sufficient to ensure his support should be secured.

In 1905 committees were chosen by the Kumi-ai Churches \(Congregational\) and the Mission of the American Board to consult concerning their mutual relations. The joint meetings of these committees were marked by the most pleasant feeling and frank interchange of coinions. The desire of all was to find a plan by which the Kumi-ai body as a whole should be self-supporting. It was made up of the following elements:—1. Self-supporting churches. 2. Churches receiving aid from the Japanese Missionary Society. 3. Churches receiving aid from the Mission. 4. Small companies of believers aided by the Mission and not yet fully organised as churches, though converts were baptised in connection with them, and transfers of members took place between them and the organised churches. The plan proposed by the missionaries and gladly adopted by the Japanese transferred to the Japanese Missionary Society the churches of the third class. To make this possible, the Mission, as a parting gift to the churches that it had been aiding, promised to pay to the Japanese Missionary Society the sum of 8,700 *yen* in three annual instalments of decreasing amount. The Missionary Society on its part promised that within the next three years it would, in addition to its regular budget, raise at least 6,000 *yen* for the aid of these churches, and would thereafter include in the budget whatever might be needed for such of them as had not then attained to self-support. In accordance with this plan, thirty churches \(including a few companies of believers belonging to the fourth of the classes mentioned above\) that had been aided in 1905 to the extent of a little over 5,000 *yen* were transferred. By this arrangement, which came into force in January, 1906, the Kumi-ai body consisted of ninety-one churches,\* and was henceforth wholly independent of mission funds, except as it had among its assets what was due of the "parting gift" to churches hitherto helped by the Mission. Those incompletely organised companies of Christians that still received foreign aid were not considered integral parts of the Kumi-ai body, though their delegates were to be received as corresponding members at the meetings of the general and local associations of the churches.

Unfortunately the agitation for independence in the Church of Christ in Japan \(Presbyterian\) was accompanied by some lack of harmony between that Church and the missions with which it was associated. In addition to the spirit of self-assertion, then so general among the Japanese, various events had made some of the prominent members of this Church dissatisfied with the present arrangement. Among these may be mentioned the objections that one of the missions co-operating in the support of the Meiji Gakuin Theological School made to the use of a certain text-book that it regarded as out of harmony with the Scriptures. The book was dropped\* and thereupon the teacher who had used it, and who was the most influential minister in the Church, resigned. He and another person concerning whom there had likewise been a difference of opinion united in establishing a rival theological school.

At the Synod held in 1904, an attempt was made to pass a resolution looking towards the dissolution of such local churches as should not in a little over two years be financially independent. One of the reasons urged in favour of this action was that the congregations receiving help through the missions were too much under the influence and control of the latter, and that so long as this condition lasted the Church of Christ in Japan could not be truly independent. The resolution failed of acceptance by two votes, but at the next year's Synod action was unanimously taken to the following effect:

1.Presbyteries shall not hereafter organise as churches bodies of believers unable to be financially independent.

2.A body of believers not financially independent shall be called *dendo kyokwai* \(mission-church\).

3.Each presbytery shall enquire into the condition of all the churches within its bounds; and shall endeavour by September, 1907, to bring to financial independence such as are now dependent. Those churches which at that time are unable to be financially independent, it shall take steps to constitute *dendo kyokwai.*

The canons were amended so that a *dendo kyokwai* was to be under the direct care of the presbytery to which it belonged and to have its affairs managed by a committee appointed by that presbytery.

As a large proportion of the bodies to be designated as *dendo kyokwai* had been more or less fully under the personal care of missionaries, the question of how much of this supervision was to be retained became an important one. The missionaries desired co-operation with the Japanese, but there was much doubt about the basis on which this could be secured. It has already been recorded that in 1897 the Synod had declared its dissatisfaction with the methods then in use, and had given its definition of what co-operation ought to be. In 1905 this subject, after having Iain dormant for some time, came once more before the Council of Co-operating Missions, which after a long discussion prepared a paper in which it said that the Council approved of the following plan:

1.The missionaries should be free to engage in work in unevangelised places, it being understood that, wherever practicable, consultation should be had with the local workers and Christians.

2.In the case of organised groups of believers, until they supplied half of their total expenses, their affairs should be administered by themselves and the representatives of the supporting missions, subject to the ecclesiastical oversight of the presbytery.

3. When such a group of believers supplied half of its expenses, its affairs should be administered by the local congregation and the presbytery, any aid from, the mission being given directly to the local organisation.

This action of the Council was not pleasing to the Synod because it included a rejection of what had been proposed, and also because the second part of the new plan gave the missions so much power over the work supported by them. Accordingly, at its next meeting the Synod adopted a resolution declaring that:

"The Synod in the year 1897 clearly recognised the fact that no co-operation in the proper sense of the word existed between the missions and the Church of Christ in Japan, Since that time, no change has taken place, nor is there any prospect of such a change."

A committee was also appointed to prepare a historical account of the matter to be sent to the churches, the missions, and the foreign missionary boards. This committee in sending the account to the boards prefaced it with a letter setting forth the position of the Synod as follows:

"It is now more than thirty years since the Church was first founded, and already it has a history that may rightly be described as eventful. It extends from one end of Japan to the other, and carries on its work through a synod, presbyteries, and congregations. It has a Board of Missions actively engaged in the work of evangelisation and the establishment of churches. Therefore it seems to be reasonable to claim that it has a right to a voice in all work carried on within its organisation or closely connected with it. That is the principle for which the Synod stands and for which it believes that churches in other lands under like circumstances would stand.

"The question of co-operation has agitated the Church and the missions from time to time for nearly fifteen years; and there are those who think the agitation uncalled for since co-operation is already a matter of fact. Whether it is a matter of fact or not depends upon the sense in which the word co-operation is used. The fact that the missions employ evangelists, aid in support of pastors, establish and maintain preaching-places, while at the same time they also in fact practically retain such matters solely within their own control does not in itself constitute cooperation, if by co-operation is meant a co-working which recognises the principle for which the Synod stands. Even though the work done extends to the Church, the system as a system is that of an *imperium in imperio.*

The co-operation which the Church seeks is a co-operation of the missions as missions with the Church as a Church. The missions and the Church, acting as independent organisations, should make clear and definite arrangements with each other under the principle set forth; and the work of the missions as missions carried on within or in close connection with the organisation of the Church should be controlled by such arrangements. Co-operation should find a partial analogy in the alliance between England and Japan; not in the relations between Japan and Korea."

The meeting of the Council of Missions held in July, 1906, gave much time to the consideration of this matter, The discussion centred about a paper that had been prepared by some of the missionaries in consultation with prominent Japanese for presentation to the Synod. It contained the following definition:

"A co-operating mission is one which recognises the right of the Church of Christ in Japan to the general care of all the evangelistic work done by the missions as missions within the Church or in connection with it, and which carries on such work under an arrangement based upon the foregoing principle and concurred in by the Synod acting through the Board of Missions."

Though a motion was lost that pledged the Council to the principle involved in this proposed definition, this fact did not show whether the majority was opposed to the principle itself, some of those who favoured it thinking it unwise to take any action. Three months later, the definition was taken to the Synod and by a majority of one was accepted by that body. One of the chief objections of those that opposed it was based on their dislike of so much centralisation as it was thought to involve by giving authority to the Church's Board of Missions instead of leaving each presbytery to make its own arrangements with the mission or missions working within its territory. This was also a point on which some of the missionaries laid stress, feeling that, while they could make mutually satisfactory arrangements with the presbyteries, it would be more difficult to do so with a central board that was likely to be composed to a great extent of teachers, editors, and pastors of large churches, who had comparatively little knowledge of the conditions of outlying districts and who, with the tendency to emphasise efforts for reaching the so-called "influential classes," might have little sympathy with work done for the common people.

In connection with this discussion much was said and written in disparagement of the missionaries, who were by some accused of letting their desire to control stand in the way of the independence of the Church. The leader in the movement was also editor of a weekly paper whose columns frequently expressed the opinion that many of the missionaries ought to return to America, On the other hand, there were pastors and evangelists whose dislike of the policy advocated led them to some thought of separating from the denomination, since they preferred to continue existing relations with the missionaries rather than come under the control of those Japanese leaders whom they regarded as seeking to lord it over their brethren.

The manner in which the missions should adjust themselves to the position taken by the Synod, became a subject for earnest thought and discussion. At the time when this account is written no uniform method of procedure has been adopted, and it is probable that for some time to come the actual relations between missionaries and the Church will vary in different localities and with different persons. The following plan, presented in July, 1907, by the West Japan Presbyterian Mission and approved by the Board of Missions of the Church of Christ in Japan, shows what the latter was ready to consider a satisfactory arrangement and one in accord with the Synod's position.

"1. Presbytery to elect a Board of Counsellors for Mission evangelistic work; the number, together with a representative appointed by the Home Mission Board, to be the same as the number of missionaries.

"2. This Board of Counsellors together with all the ordained missionaries, members of this Mission working within the bounds of the Presbytery, to constitute a joint committee for the administration of the evangelistic work of the Mission.

"3, This joint committee to decide in regard to all the evangelistic work of the Mission within the bounds of the Presbytery, such matters as the opening and closing of evangelistic fields, the appointment and dismissal of evangelists, the fixing of salaries, the amount of aid to be given to *Dendo Kyokwai,* etc. The committee may also make suggestions to the Mission concerning the supply and distribution of the evangelistic missionary force.

"4. An annual meeting of this joint committee to be held in connection with the meeting of the Presbytery. At this meeting the work of the past year to be reviewed, and estimates for the work of the coming year made out and the work planned for. Thereafter any questions that may arise, to be decided by the local missionary or missionaries in consultation with the Board of Counsellors or a sub-committee of the same.

"5. This plan of co-operation may be modified by the joint action of the Church of Christ in Japan and the Mission, according to the teachings of experience and the growth of the work. Should either party desire to terminate this arrangement, it may be done at any time upon a year's notice."

Previous chapters have recorded the union of the churches that had grown up in connection with the different Presbyterian and Reformed missions, and also that resulting from the coming together of those established by the Episcopalian missions of England and America. A similar combination of those connected with the Methodist Episcopal Church; the Methodist Episcopal Church, South; the Methodist Church of Canada; the Methodist Protestant Church; the United Brethren in Christ; and the Evangelical Association, was for several years under discussion. The Evangelical Association soon withdrew from the negotiations on the ground that its churches were not yet ready to assume the responsibilities that were involved. While the missionaries and the Japanese Christians of the other bodies were almost unanimous in favour of the union, the home authorities did not find it easy to agree upon any plan for its accomplishment. The chief trouble came from questions concerning the degree of authority that should be given to bishops, and the length of a bishop's term of service, as well as those relating to presiding elders and district conferences. While negotiations were still in progress, a movement arose in the United States for the uniting in that country of the Methodist Protestants, the United Brethren, and the Congregationalists; hence the first two of these bodies ceased to take part in the negotiations for a Methodist union in japan. Furthermore, although in America the commissioners of the northern and southern Methodist Episcopal Churches agreed upon a plan under which they could approve of the union of their churches in Japan, it was of such a nature as to be unacceptable to the Canadian Methodists. The Japanese Christians connected with the three bodies were very much opposed to any further narrowing of the combination, and some of them began to say that, as they were the persons most interested, the decision should be made in Japan rather than in America. The missionaries also were disappointed that no satisfactory arrangement had been made. An amended proposition for a basis of union such as was favoured by the missionaries and the Japanese Christians was prepared and a strong appeal for its approval was sent to America, where it proved effective in gaining assent for what was proposed.

In accordance with the decision thus reached, delegates from four annual conferences \(one conference of the Methodist Church of Canada; one of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South; and two of the Methodist Episcopal Church\) met in Tokyo, May 22, 1907, for holding the First General Conference of the Methodist Church of Japan. There were also present two commissioners from each of the mother churches in the United States and Canada. At this meeting the final decisions were made concerning the Basis of Union and the Discipline. One of the missionaries writes:

"As to creed the new Church is based upon the historic doctrines of Methodism, eighteen of our articles having' been taken practically without change from the Discipline of the uniting churches. In policy the Church follows again Methodist standards, being Episcopal, with presiding elders nominated, in double the number necessary, to the bishop for his appointment of the proper number for a term of four years each, and with an itinerant ministry without time limit to the pastorate. That is, pastors receive their appointments annually."\*

Rev. Honda Yoitsu, whom the reader will remember as one of the earliest Japanese Christians, was chosen to be the first bishop, and was duly consecrated on Sunday, June 2.

The question of the relations of the missionaries to the new Church was finally settled by the Japanese members of the General Conference, who, after consultation by themselves, were unanimous in adopting the following resolution:

"Resolved. That every missionary regularly appointed by the Methodist Episcopal Church, the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, or the Methodist Church, Canada, to work in co-operation with the Methodist Church of Japan, as contemplated in the Basis of Union adopted by the Commissioners of said Churches, shall by virtue of such appointment be entitled to all the rights and privileges of actual membership in the Annual Conference where his service is being rendered, so long as his administration and conduct conform to our Discipline.

"Every such missionary who may in writing elect to serve in this relation shall be subject to the assignment and direction of the missionary authorities of the Church by which he is supported, in consultation with the *Kantoku* \[Bishop\].

"In the event of his non-conformity to our Discipline, the *Kantoku* shall in writing so advise the missionary authorities of the Church to which such missionary is responsible; and the course to be pursued shall then be determined by consultation between the Kanloku and said missionary authorities."

In 1900 the failure of the rice crop in some of the provinces of northeastern Hondo caused great distress among the peasantry. It is said that by December of that year thousands of people were living upon food composed largely of acorns and the leaves of vegetables When snow covered the ground, these supplies were cut off, and numbers of people were in danger of starvation. Christian missionaries were the first to give wide publicity to this condition of affairs and they took a prominent part in efforts for the relief of those in distress. A committee chosen by the foreign community in Sendai, and composed of five Protestant missionaries, one Catholic missionary, and one teacher in a government school, collected and administered about one hundred thousand *yen,* of which about one-half came from the United States. All the relief work was done after full consultation with the local officials, who rendered all possible assistance. Public funds, besides money contributed by Japanese and administered by them, also helped to relieve the wide-spread distress; but the help from foreign sources that was sent through the Sendai committee and still larger sums sent through the Red Cross Society had the additional advantage of being a witness to the sympathy that people of other lands had for Japan, a sympathy that found its counterpart a few months later, when Japan sent three hundred thousand *yen* for the relief of sufferers from the great earthquake in San Francisco.

As one result of the famine, large numbers of children whose parents had died or had become unable to support them were sent to the already existing orphanages, or were cared for in one specially opened for their relief by ladies of the Methodist Mission in Sendai.

The progress in educational matters that had been made by japan began to attract to its higher schools young men from other Asiatic countries—Korea, Siam, India, and especially China. In 1904 the numbers of those coming from the last of these countries suddenly increased to an average of about one hundred new students a month; and in the latter part of 1905 they were coming at the rate of five hundred a month. At the close of 1906 the whole number was said to be over fifteen thousand.\* Nearly all of these were in Tokyo. Removed as they were from accustomed restraints and brought into conditions that subjected them to severe temptations, many of them lived in ways that brought reproach upon the whole class. How the Chinese students should be controlled became a problem for the Minister of their own country, for the Japanese officials, and for such schools as took an interest in the moral welfare of their pupils. They formed a class that was in great need of helpful religious and moral influences.

The National Union of the Young Men's Christian Associations of Japan invited the General Committee of the Young Men's Christian Associations of China, Korea, and Hongkong to make an effort in behalf of these students; and in response to this call Chinese and American secretaries were sent from China to organise and conduct a work for their benefit Evening schools, Bible classes, evangelistic meetings, and social entertainments were soon under way. In January, 1907, a new building was dedicated that furnished permanent headquarters for a work likely to have great influence on the religious history of the land from which these students come and in whose future progress they will have a prominent part.

The willingness of most parents to have their children attend Sunday schools had given churches and missions great opportunities for usefulness; but there had been no general organisation of the schools until 1907 when, in connection with the visit of Mr. F. L. Brown, of the International Sunday School Association, the Sunday School Association of Japan was formed. Under its auspices conventions have been held, "lesson helps" prepared, literature published, and other efforts made for arousing interest in Sunday schools and increasing their efficiency.

Two events in the early part of 1907 did much to direct public attention towards Christianity—the holding of a Conference of the World's Student Christian Federation, and the visit of General William Booth, the founder of the Salvation Army.

The Conference, which was held in Tokyo from April 3 to April 7, was the first international gathering ever held in Japan, and so was hailed by its people as another proof that they had gained a recognised place among the nations of the earth. There were one hundred and sixty delegates from abroad, representing twenty-five different countries. English and Japanese were the official languages, all the important addresses and announcements being given in both, this requiring a double interpretation in the few cases where speeches were made in other languages. The prayer-meetings had more of a polyglot nature, each person that took part speaking in his own tongue; while the printing of the hymnal in different languages allowed the same sentiments to be expressed simultaneously in Japanese, English, German, French, Chinese, and Korean. The novelty and suggestiveness of these features impressed the Japanese, as did the fact that the gathering was considered of so much importance that it received messages from the President of the United States, the Kings of England and Norway, and the Crown Prince of Sweden. A letter from Marquis Ito, the Japanese Resident-General in Korea, and his gift of ten thousand *yen* towards the expenses of the Conference were probably expressions in his name of the friendly feeling of the Japanese Government; while leading citizens of Tokyo and members of the nobility tendered receptions to the delegates. The addresses delivered at the public sessions were valuable, but perhaps the indirect influence of the Conference in bringing Christianity so prominently before the people was its greatest service. Many of the delegates afterwards visited different sections of the country to take part in evangelistic services.

One interesting feature of the Conference was the receipt of a friendly message from a meeting of Buddhists being held at the same time in Tokyo, which passed the following resolution:

"The Japan Buddhist Conference wishes to take this opportunity to express its profound respect to the World's Student Christian Federation Conference which is now going on and also to the distinguished guests from abroad.

"The Japan Buddhist Conference shall send a suitable representative to convey this resolution to the World's Student Christian Conference."

The Federation on its part appointed a representative to bear a suitable response to the Buddhists. A letter was also received from a Conference of Shinto priests.

General Booth's name was already well known to the reading public. Placards bearing his portrait and advertising his meetings were posted in all the cities to be visited by him, so that his name was in everybody's mouth, albeit many, it is said, got the idea that he was the commander-in-chief of Great Britain's military forces. The Japanese, who are hero-worshippers, were eager to see a person so famous. His efforts for the social regeneration of the lower classes commended him to many who took little interest in his more strictly religious work. As one Christian paper said: "No other person in private life ever visited this country who was so enthusiastically received by the Japanese people as was General Booth. His public meetings everywhere were crowded to overflowing, and both the high and the lowly, the old and the young, seemed to vie with each other in doing him homage." Official receptions were tendered to him in most of the cities that he visited. In Tokyo he was granted an audience with the Emperor, being allowed to go to the Palace in his usual Salvation Army uniform. "His journeys by rail were almost like a royal progress. At all the chief stations, the mayor and city officials or other representative citizens and the leading Christians came to greet the General. He invariably addressed them as long as the wait at the station would permit. At some of the stations, the students or school children sang welcome songs, and throughout there was remarkable manifestation of affectionate regard." Remaining in Japan a little over a month, he delivered addresses in several cities before audiences that, although an admission fee was charged, crowded the buildings in which meetings were held.

The Students' Conference and the visit of General Booth received due attention from the press. For a while the newspapers abounded with reports and with comments that as a rule were commendatory. One daily paper said that Christianity was the thing about which people were then most desirous to be told, and in order to meet this popular demand it gave considerable space in its columns to passages from the Bible.

It must not be supposed, however, that there were no discordant voices. Some Christian writers thought that the Conference made too much of receptions and other social attentions paid by prominent men. One of these writers, who was noted as a trenchant critic, said:

"Say not the age of miracles is past. Miracles still take place in front of our eyes. Marquis Ito has given ten thousand *yen* for a Christian work\! An impossibility has happened, and it ought to strengthen or weaken the faith of believers as the case may be. Has Marquis Ito undergone that fearful mental and spiritual struggle which is known under the name of Christian conversion? Or have Japanese Christians gone down to his spiritual level to accept his gift? Or did the two meet in midair, one coming up half-way and the other coming down almost half-way?. . . Truly Christianity is moving at high speed in Japan, but whether upward or downward only the future historian can tell."\*

A writer in the *Taiyo,* the most popular of the Japanese monthly magazines, had an article in which, after referring to the Conference, the Salvation Army, and the coming of a new bishop to the Greek Church, he said:

"From all this we can see how earnest the believers are in the spread of Christianity, and how strongly they desire to make Japan a Christian nation in the near future. Their efforts have been heartily welcomed by the people and it is not unnatural that they think that no such opportunity for evangelisation will again present itself. Supposing that these movements should be successful, our Empire will be changed into a Christian country, our unique history extending over a period of twenty-five hundred years will be trampled on, and the spirit of Japan will be destroyed. Not only is the Christian spirit not sufficient to lead the new generation, but it will make the people weak and hypocritical, and will destroy their character. . . . Pay no attention to the hypocritical words of Christians and listen not to their hymns. Long live the non-Christian spirit\! Long live the spirit of the world, of the flesh, of self-confidence, of determination, and of patriotism\!"†

In July, 1907, Baron Kato Hiroyuki, a Privy Councillor and formerly the President of the Tokyo Imperial University, delivered before the Imperial Academy a lecture entitled "Christianity and the State," which attracted much attention. Baron Kato began by declaring his opposition not only to Christianity, but to all religion, because all supernatural ism fosters superstition, and superstition is an obstacle to intellectual progress. He went on to argue that Christianity and Buddhism are the more dangerous to the state because of their cosmopolitan character. Their teaching of universal brotherhood leads to a decay of the nationalistic spirit, and hence they are more objectionable than such religions as Judaism and Brahminism, which confine their attention to the people among whom they have arisen. A religion that claims to be universal places before the citizen the necessity of serving two masters—the State and the deities that he worships. In case their commands differ, there is danger that he will follow the latter. Christianity is specially to be feared because it cannot take on Japanese forms as Buddhism has done. It demands that all shall recognise and serve the one God whom it proclaims. It places that God above the national rulers; but Japanese should never acknowledge that any being is higher than the Emperor. The Salvation Army has displayed banners with the inscription "Japan for Christ," while the Okayama Orphanage has issued a printed invitation to the celebration of its twentieth anniversary beginning with the words, "Through the blessing of the Heavenly Father and the favour of Their Imperial Majesties," thus relegating Their Imperial Majesties to a secondary place, an act of the greatest disrespect such as must be intolerable to a patriot. Christian schools do, indeed, read the Imperial Rescript on Education, but this is only because of the pressure from public opinion. The Rescript and Christianity are absolutely irreconcilable. Many doctrines of the Christians, such as the belief in a personal God, are unscientific, and no educated Japanese should look with unconcern upon the spread of a religion whose acceptance would, from an intellectual point of view, be a step backward, and from that of a patriot, would portend danger to the State.

The lecture as printed in a pamphlet led to much discussion, especially in Christian journals, most of whose writers, however, were inclined to ridicule the thought of bringing up arguments which, though current twenty years before, had long been outgrown. Baron Kato, they said, had fallen hopelessly behind the times; and however pardonable this might be in a man over seventy years old, it would be inexcusable in younger men were they to follow his lead. More direct arguments were used in reply to his assertions. Among other things he was accused of inconsistency, for he had once been ardent in proclaiming the equality of all men, and as an earnest advocate of the doctrines of evolution had written many things quite irreconcilable with what he was now saying about the Imperial Family. In a later lecture Baron Kato said in rebuttal of this charge that, in all of his teachings of the Spencerian philosophy, he had considered the Imperial Family as altogether outside and above all evolutionary processes. Though Baron Kato's belated arguments would probably have had little effect if coming from another source, his reputation as a scholar, and the high positions he had held, gave them a currency and influence beyond their deserts.

A form of work that had been gradually developed became prominent about 1907 under the name "*shuchu dendo,"* a term that has been translated as "concentrated evangelism." As usually conducted, some promising field where there was already a church was chosen several months in advance in order that the pastor, sometimes aided by one or two persons from outside, might prepare the Christians for the movement and also get as many new persons as possible interested in the study of the Bible. In some places this study was conducted on a plan that had originated in Okayama of having "one worker teach one Gospel to one person;" that is, those Christians that volunteered for service received from the leader instructions once a week in whichever of the four Gospels was chosen, and then each one went to the person who, having signified willingness to be taught, had been assigned to his care. When the time came for *shuchu dendo,* several pastors and laymen would spend a week or two in the city holding meetings and also visiting in their homes those that were already interested in Christianity or that were thought to be most accessible. As a result of these efforts many new persons were added to the number of enquirers, but the large additions to the churches came mostly from those who had before, in Sunday schools or elsewhere, learned about Christianity, and were now by this movement brought to the needed decision that made them willing to be reckoned among the disciples of Christ.
