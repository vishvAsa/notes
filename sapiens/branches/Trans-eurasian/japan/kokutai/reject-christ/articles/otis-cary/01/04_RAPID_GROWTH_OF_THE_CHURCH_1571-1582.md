IT has already been noted that Nobunaga had no love for the Buddhist priests. His anger had been especially excited against those of Mt. Hiei because on several occasions they had rendered aid to his enemies. He therefore determined upon their destruction. When he disclosed the plan to his generals, they were inclined to remonstrate against an attack upon temples which since the building of Kyoto had been considered a protection against demons and had been held in such honour by Emperor and people. Nobunaga insisted that the priests were little better than a band of traitors who were bringing evil upon their country. Their religious professions, he said, ought not to protect them; for they lived in constant violation of the precepts of Buddha, eating fish and keeping concubines. He declared that it was time these hypocrites and rebels were destroyed. In pursuance of this policy, Nobunaga's soldiers forced their way up the steep sides of the mountain, set fire to the buildings, and put to death every person they could find —priests, servants, concubines, and children. This event occurred September 29, 1571.

The temples of Mt. Hiei belonged to the Tendai sect. Three years later Nobunaga attacked the great monastery in Osaka, belonging to the Shin sect, which had also assisted his enemies. The so-called monastery was in fact one of the strongest fortresses in the land. Nobunaga failed in this attempt to take it, as he also did in subsequent sieges. It was not until 1580 that, by making use of the Emperor's intercession, he persuaded the abbot to surrender the castle and receive in exchange for it land and revenues in other places.

The Nichiren sect also suffered at Nobunaga's hands. It had consented to Set him decide a long-standing quarrel between itself and the Jodo sect. He would do this only upon condition that the leaders of the losing side should be decapitated. Representatives of the two sects came to his castle at Azuchi and there held a famous discussion which resulted in the defeat of the Nichiren advocates. Not only did they pay the prescribed penalty, but other prominent priests were banished, while the temples were crippled by large financial demands that were made upon them.

Nobunaga's dislike of the Buddhist priests made him the more ready to favour a religion whose success would help to undermine their power. In one of the letters that were sent by the missionaries as reports of their work it was said of him:

"This man seems to have been chosen by God to open and prepare the way for our Holy Faith, without understanding what he is doing, because he not only has little respect for the *Kami* and the *Hotoke,**\** whom the Japanese worship with such devotion, but he is furthermore the capita\! enemy and persecutor of the bonzes, inasmuch as among the various sects many are rich and powerful, and lords of great fortresses and rich territories, and by their opposition they have put him into great straits. . . . On the other hand, in proportion to the intensity of his enmity to the bonzes and their sects is his good will towards our Fathers who preach the law of God, whence he has shown them so many favours that his subjects are amazed and unable to divine what he is aiming at in this."

During Nobunaga's life the Christian religion made rapid progress in the central provinces of Japan. It was somewhat impeded, however, by difficulties arising from the civil conflicts of that period. The Shogun Yoshiaki, who grew tired of the constraint under which he was kept, joined with several daimyos in a plot for overthrowing Nobunaga. Among those siding with the Shogun was Naito, the Christian Daimyo of Kameoka in the province of Tamba. He marched to Kyoto with two thousand warriors whose banners bore the figure of the Cross, while on his own helmet the name "Jesus" was inscribed in golden letters. This uprising, which occurred in 1573, was unsuccessful. Yoshiaki was driven from Kyoto, though the title of Shogun was never formally taken from him. Nobunaga did not choose to allow the appointment of any one else and preferred to hold the real power himself under the title of Naidaijin, Minister of the Interior. Naito was replaced by a non-Christian daimyo.

In 1577 a large church edifice was completed in Kyoto. Money for its erection had been contributed by Christians of different provinces and some had come from non-believers, The Buddhist priests so exerted themselves in the attempt to prevent its completion that the Governor of the city was at last forced to threaten them with punishment if they persisted in their efforts. He himself contributed both money and materials.

A revolt that arose against Nobunaga in 1579, had among its leaders Araki, the suzerain of Takayama Ukon. The latter had now become the Lord of Takatsuki. Nobunaga besieged the castle of Takatsuki and sent word to Ukon that unless it were surrendered, all of the Christians in the vicinity of Kyoto, including the missionaries, would be put to death, "Ukon, who knew that Nobunaga would not hesitate to carry out his threat, sent a messenger to seek advice from Father Organtin, who was then in Kyoto. Nobunaga had been urging Organtin to use his influence in procuring Ukon's submission; and doubtless, as is stated in Japanese accounts of the affair, he used both threats and promises to make the missionary serve him, Organtin was permitted to enter the besieged castle, where he urged the wisdom of yielding. It was not easy for Ukon to accept this advice. His sister and his eldest son had been put as pledges of fealty in the hands of Araki; his mother and wife, in alarm at the thought of the probable fate of the hostages, begged him not to yield; and his father was opposed to surrender. Ukon finally decided that he would give himself up to Nobunaga, but would not surrender the castle. Having shaved his head and put on the dress of a religious recluse, he went with Organtin into the presence of Nobunaga, who received him back into favour. Meanwhile his father secured the safety of the hostages by promising Araki that he would defend the castle. He was soon obliged to yield to the superior force of the besiegers. Through his son's intercession the sentence of death, at first pronounced against him, was commuted into banishment to the province of Echizen. This proved not wholly disadvantageous to the Christian cause, for he and his wife, on reaching the place of their exile, were such zealous teachers of Christianity that they prepared the way for the missionaries to visit the province. Takayama Ukon was left in possession of Takatsuki.

It was the custom of the Christians to have great reunions in Kyoto and other places. One is mentioned as having been held in 1581, at Takatsuki, which was attended by fifteen thousand believers. In addition to religious exercises, which included an imposing procession, there were feasts and various kinds of games for the amusement of the people. One great attraction was a negro, whom the missionaries had brought from Africa. A report of this strange being reached Nobunaga, and at his request Father Organtin brought the negro to his palace. Nobunaga suspected some trickery, tried to see if the black colour could be washed off, and had the man stripped to see if it extended over the whole body. The missionaries permitted him to keep the negro as his own slave.

As Nobunaga wished to be near the capital and at the same time not too far from his ancestral estates, he began in 1568 to build a new city at Azuchi on the eastern shore of Lake Biwa. In 1576 he made this his chief residence. The Jesuits describe in glowing terms the magnificence of his palace and the splendid entertainments that were given in it. They say that at one time a hundred thousand persons came as invited guests. Nobunaga had declared his unwillingness to have any other temple in the city than the one where his own image was to he installed in the place of chief honour. He, however, presented Organtin with land for the erection of a residence and a church. The Christians were quick to take advantage of this gift. Takayama Ukon furnished much of the necessary timber and also a large number of workmen to assist in the erection of the buildings. A school was also built that the children of the leading families might be taught the sciences and European languages. When this was opened, Nobunaga visited it and manifested much interest in its work. He also frequently invited the missionaries to come to his palace, where he questioned them about their religion and about affairs in Europe. His father-in-law was baptised, while his eldest son showed much interest in Christianity, and even told Organtin that he would gladly become its follower if it were not that it was beyond his power to keep the commandment against adultery. It was felt by the missionaries that many others were held back by the same difficulty. The Annual Letter for 1852, said:

"If sensuality did riot pervert their intellect, most of these lords would already be Christians; but the observance of this precept seems so hard to them that it makes their conversion difficult, so that many of them confidently allege that if the Fathers were a little broader with them in this commandment, they would at once become Christians. Among these lords the eldest son and successor of Nobunaga has discussed this three or four times with a Brother, wishing to persuade him that the Fathers should not proceed with such rigour in this matter, maintaining that if they did relax their rigour a great number of lords would forthwith be reduced to our Faith, and that so much was frequently said in the Court. Wherefore the said prince asserted that it would be doing greater service to God to dispense with this sixth \[seventh by the usual Protestant reckoning\] commandment, and thus make so many converts than to ruin all hopes of their conversion by our rigour in this precept, affirming that if it were dispensed with he himself would be the first to receive baptism."

Many Japanese have thought that Nobunaga became a Christian; but the letters of the Jesuits make it plain that, notwithstanding all the favours he showed to Christianity and the interest he sometimes manifested in its doctrines, their hopes for his conversion were not realised. June 22, 1582, he was slain at Kyoto by the treachery of Akechi, one of his own generals. Retainers and servants who ran to his assistance were also put to death, the only one to escape being the negro slave, who found refuge with the missionaries. When Hideyoshi, who had been Nobunaga's leading general, learned what had been done, he at once marched against the traitor, who, after his army had been defeated, took refuge in flight, but was beaten to death by some peasants whom he had asked to help him escape. Hideyoshi, though not without opposition, soon succeeded to the power that had been wielded by Nobunaga.

In Kyushu the Daimyo of Isahaya, a brother-in-law of Sumitada, having failed in his attempts to induce the latter to return to the Buddhist faith, became, in 1573, the head of a coalition against him. The Daimyo of Hirado was easily won to the plan. The Daimyo of Arima, who had failed to attract the Portuguese to his port of Kochinotsu, suspected that Sumitada had been secretly working against him, and so he became a third member of the league. Some of the castles in Sumitada's territory were commanded by persons so little in sympathy with their master that they treacherously delivered these into the hands of the enemy. The city of Omura was easily taken by the Daimyo of Ishahaya, who then attempted to surprise a neighbouring castle in which Sumitada was living. The latter, who had only fifteen retainers with him, knew nothing of what was happening until he saw the enemy approach. To conceal his desperate condition by giving the appearance of having more soldiers, he caused all the women in the castle to be dressed in armour. In a short time thirty Christian knights managed to force their way through the besiegers and came to his assistance. Others followed until the increase in numbers enabled him to overcome his enemies.

Sumitada now resolved to make his domains wholly Christian. When his knights and priests came to do him homage at the beginning of a new year, he spoke of the great blessing he had received from God and pleaded so earnestly that all of them, whether from interest or from policy, promised to study Christianity. Cabral, the Vice-Provincial, tells us that a Jesuit Father and a Brother "accompanied by a strong guard, but yet not without danger of their lives, went about causing the churches of the Gentiles with their idols to be thrown to the ground, while three Japanese Christians went preaching the law of God everywhere. Those of us who were in the neighbouring kingdoms all withdrew therefrom to work in this abundant harvest, and in the space of seven months twenty thousand persons were baptised, as were the bonzes of about sixty monasteries with the exception of a few who left this State."

The Daimyo of Arima had been led, after his defeat, to think more favourably of Christianity. He was baptised in 1576. So earnest was he in propagating his new religion, and so ready were his subjects to follow the example and exhortations of their lord, that, although he died the next year, there were said to have been at that time twenty thousand Christians in his domains. His son on succeeding to power issued an edict in which he ordered the missionaries to depart and all of his Christian subjects to recant. Many of his people were as quick to obey the commands of the new ruler as they had been to follow the wishes of his predecessor. Others threatened to emigrate rather than give up their faith. Fears that they might do this, and hopes fostered by Father Valegnani that the foreign merchants would frequent his port, probably had much influence in leading the young Daimyo to change his policy. Valegnani also acted as mediator in persuading the Daimyo of Saga to desist from military movements against Arima. One of his arguments may be surmised by Charlevoix's statement that the Portuguese "had promised at the instigation of Valegnani to serve Arima with their munitions and even with their persons. "After some delay the Daimyo of Arima was baptised in 1580, he being at that time twenty years old. He took the name of Protasius. He built churches, established a college for young men of high rank, and also built schools where instruction was given not only in Christian doctrine, but also in Portuguese, Latin, and such European arts as painting, clock-making, the carving of images, and the construction of organs.

Though Otomo Yoshishige, the Daimyo of Bungo, had gladly listened to the teaching of Xavier and other missionaries, had erected at Funai a splendid building that included a church, a residence, and a hospital, and in other ways had favoured the work of the Jesuits, he for many years was unwilling to declare himself a Christian. He professed a great desire to arrive at certitude in religious matters. While ever ready to listen to the Christian doctrine, he sent to Kyoto for Buddhist priests of the Zen sect, which was considered the most philosophical in Japan. After a while he dismissed them, saying that their teaching was inferior to that of the Christians. The missionaries believed that unwillingness to put away immoral practices was what kept him from conversion. He had many concubines and frequently added to their number. His legitimate wife was a strong Buddhist. The Jesuits describe her as a monster of wickedness, and in their letters often refer to her under the nickname of Jezebel. Her second son was being educated for the priesthood. A splendid and richly endowed monastery had been prepared for him, but when the time came for his removal thither, the boy, who was only fourteen years old, declared that he would not go, but wished to be a Christian. Notwithstanding the mother's opposition, Yoshishige gave his assent, and the boy, taking the name Sebastian, was baptised in December, 1575. The young convert soon showed his zeal by going with some of his companions into the city and breaking off the heads of a number of idols. When the bonzes complained of this conduct, the Daimyo upheld his son's act.

Among those that were led by the boy's example to declare themselves Christians was Chikatora, the adopted son of Sebastian's maternal uncle. The Daimyo's wife, who had failed to hold back her own son from accepting the religion she hated, seemed likely to be more successful in the case of her nephew, for she had the assistance of the father, who shut up the young man in a castle, so as to keep him away from the Christians. The relatives even begged Father Cabral to warn Chikatora that he ought not to oppose his father. The missionary did write a letter advising him not to seek baptism for a while, but to be obedient to his father so far as he could do this without offending his own conscience.

Chikatora's conduct was so pleasing to his father and to Jezebel that he was given more liberty; but at last the means by which they sought to alienate him from Christianity were such—some say recourse was had to magic, others that he was surrounded by temptations to licentiousness—that he ran away to the house of Cabral, begging to receive baptism, and the rite was administered April 24, 1577.

Yoshishige's wife tried to stir up the people to attack the missionaries, whereupon the Daimyo declared that any one molesting them would be severely punished. In other matters Jezebel's conduct was so displeasing that he finally divorced her. He then married another woman who was a catechumen, put away his concubines, and at last \(August 28, 1578\) was baptised together with his new wife. He was then forty-eight years old. In memory of Xavier, his first teacher of Christianity, he took the name Francis. At this time he was one of the most powerful lords in Japan, five of the nine provinces in Kyushu being subject to him. He decided to abdicate in favour of his eldest son, Yoshimune, a man of weak character, who, though numbered among the catechumens, long wavered between allegiance to Christianity and opposition to it.

The divorced wife of Yoshishige exerted all her influence to induce Yoshimune to favour the Buddhists. Her brother at one time seemed likely to succeed in securing the adoption of his proposal that the foreigners be slain, the churches destroyed, and Christianity proscribed. Yoshishige, however, still retained enough influence to prevent such action. At times, when military affairs or the exigencies of State required a stronger leader than the son, he resumed the actual administration of the government. He showed as much zeal against Buddhism as Jezebel against Christianity, In the Annual Letters of the Jesuits there are several passages describing his acts, of which the following are specimens:

"He captured a very strong place where was one of the chief temples and the most frequented in these parts, which had around it three thousand houses of the bonzes; and he at once gave orders to burn all the houses. The venerable temple was turned into ashes."

"The destruction of the monasteries in this kingdom proceeds. Their revenues are given to the soldiers. The bonzes are quitting their robes. Some marry, some go to the wars or to seek elsewhere their fortunes."

Doubtless the division of sentiment among the people, fostered in part by religious dissensions, had much to do with the misfortunes that came upon the Otomo family. Four of the five provinces that Yoshimune had received from his father were soon lost. Nothing was left but Bungo, and that was in a rebellious condition.

The Daimyo of Satsuma, son of the one that had been in power when Xavier came to Japan, was among those who had been asking for missionaries. The Annual Letter for 1582 is doubtless right in its surmise of his motives when it says: "The King of Satsuma, desiring that the Portuguese ships should go to his ports, and judging that if there were churches and Christians in his hands the Portuguese would be more readily induced to go there, treated of this matter with the Father Visitor and the Vice-Provincial. "In this as in other cases the Jesuits were not so dull that they could not see how the attempt was being made to utilise them; but at the same time they were too wise to neglect the opportunities that were thus afforded. Almeida made a second visit to Kagoshima to arrange for complying with the invitation. The Buddhist priests were once more aroused. It is said that they persuaded the Daimyo to order all his chief retainers to make a solemn promise never to become Christians, or allow their subordinates to do so. One prominent person who argued against this proposition was murdered, and the opposition to the foreigners was so strong that the Daimyo was obliged to tell Almeida that it was inadvisable to proceed with the negotiations.

In the Annual Letter of 1582 the condition of Christianity in Japan at the close of the preceding year was thus described:

"The number of all the Christians in Japan according to the Father Visitor's information amounts to 150, 000, a little more or less, of whom many are nobles, since besides the Kings of Bungo, Arima, and Omura, there are also many lords of different lands who, together with their relatives and vassals, are Christians, The majority of these live in Kyushu on the lands of Arima, Omura, Hirado, and Amakusa, where, with the others in the lands of Goto, there are 115, 000 Christians. In the kingdom of Bungo there are 10, 000; in the Kyoto district, with those scattered in the home provinces and Yamaguchi, there are 25, 000. The churches we have in those kingdoms where there are Christians, between great and small, are two hundred in number."

There had arisen a marked difference of opinion among die missionaries concerning the education that should he given to Japanese evangelists. Father Cabral, the Vice-Provincial, feared that the haughty spirit of the Japanese would lead them, if instructed in Western sciences, to despise their European teachers. Hence he desired to have them taught only so much as would enable them to occupy lower positions as helpers of the missionaries. On the other hand, Father Valegnani, who had come as Visitor General, favoured a more liberal policy, which led him to establish a college in Funai. Cabral's opposition was so strong that the Visitor found it advisable to send him to China and transfer his office to Father Coelho.

A few months before the assassination of Nobunaga, the ex-Daimyo of Bungo united with the Daimyos of Omura and Arima in sending an embassy to Europe. It is probable that the first suggestion of this came from the Jesuits, who desired on the one hand to arouse missionary enthusiasm in Europe and on the other to impress the envoys with the splendour of European cities and the power of the Church, so that their report might make the Japanese more ready to accept the religion of Western lands. Doubtless also the Japanese at that time, as has been true in later years, were desirous of learning through their own countrymen the truth concerning foreign lands and to use for their own benefit whatever of good might be brought back by those who had travelled abroad. We have already seen from Xavier's letters how an envoy had been sent from Bungo to the Portuguese colonies in India; the next step was to have Europe itself visited. Yoshishige selected as his representative a grand-nephew named Mancio Ito; the Daimyos of Omura and Arima sent a nephew of the former named Michael Chijiwa; to these were added two young men of high rank named Julian Nakaura and Martin Hara. Each of these persons was about sixteen years old. Probably those in whose names they went looked upon them less as envoys of state than as young men sent abroad for education; but in Europe they were received in such a way as would have befitted men holding the former position. Father Valegnani did indeed request that the courts to which they might go should not show them too much honour, since he feared that they might be puffed up with an undue sense of their own importance. This warning had little effect. Since the Jesuits in their letters had applied the title "king" to the daimyos, the young men coming in the names of these lords were treated as royal ambassadors.

They set out in a Portuguese ship that sailed from Nagasaki February 22, 1582, On reaching Goa, Father Valegnani, who was in charge of the party, found that he had been appointed Provincial in the Indies. He therefore turned over the care of the young men to Fathers James Mesquita and Nuñez Rodriguez. Owing to long delays at Macao, Cochin, and Goa, it was not until August 10, 1584, that the envoys reached Lisbon. At Macao they had been hailed with salvos of artillery, and in Goa the Viceroy had given them a splendid reception, hung chains of gold about their necks, presented them with three thousand crowns, and expended two thousand ducats in fitting up the quarters they were to occupy in the ship that took them on their way. This was but a prelude to what they were to experience in Europe. Their arrival in Lisbon and their slow progress to Rome were marked by a succession of magnificent fêtes. At the court of the Spanish King, Philip II., they were entertained as though they were royal princes. They spent three days in the Escurial and then went to the college of the Jesuits in Madrid, where they were visited by the King, the nobles, and the foreign ambassadors. Similar honours were shown them at Pisa by the Grand Duke of Tuscany; but the height of all was their reception at Rome. While they were yet two days' journey from the city, they were met by a troop of cavalry sent by Pope Gregory XIII, to escort them to the house of the Jesuits, where they were welcomed by Aquiviva, the General of the Order. As they were supposed to be still *incogniti,* their public entrance to the city did not occur until three days later, March 23, 1585. The Pope had held a consistory to decide upon what ceremonies would be appropriate. According to Crasset, Gregory by the advice of the cardinals ordered that the envoys "should be received publicly in the Royal Hall as ambassadors of crowned heads, and commanded that every one should give them the honour due to persons of that character, chiefly seeing this redounded to the honour of the Holy See, to the edification of the Church of Japan, and confusion of heretics."

On the morning of the public reception, the Japanese visitors were taken in the carriage of the Spanish ambassador to the Vineyard of Julius III., outside the city walls. There a procession was formed having at its head the troopers, the Swiss Guards, and the attendants of the cardinals. Next came carriages conveying ambassadors of France, Spain, Venice, and many other states, and followed by a mounted escort of nobles and papal officials. After these rode the Japanese themselves, clad in the ceremonial dress of their own land and wearing richly decorated swords. Mancio Ito, as representative of Otomo, came first, riding between two archbishops; while Michael Chijiwa and Martin Hara were each accompanied by two bishops. They were followed by Father Mesquita, who served as interpreter. Julian Nakaura was prevented by illness from taking part in the ceremonies. Many Roman nobles and gentlemen, riding on horseback, brought up the rear of the procession. As it entered the city by the Porta del Popolo and made its way towards the Vatican, the ringing of bells, the sounding of trumpets, and the booming of the cannon of St. Angelo united with the acclamation of the people to do honour to the visitors. When the Japanese were ushered into the Palace, they fell at the feet of the Pope, who was so moved with emotion that his eyes filled with tears as he raised the young men and tenderly embraced them. The letters that had been sent by their daimyos were then read. Translations of these documents are given by Crasset. Yoshishige's letter will serve as a specimen.

"To him that ought to be honoured on earth as holding the place of the King of Heaven, the most high and most holy Pope.

"After craving assistance of God my sovereign Lord, I made bold to write to your Holiness with a most profound humility. The Lord and Governor of heaven and earth, who holds under His empire the sun, moon, and stars, hath been pleased to dart a beam of His light upon me, at that time buried in most profound ignorance and darkness, and discovering the treasures of His mercy to the inhabitants of these countries. He sent about four and thirty years ago into these kingdoms the Fathers of the Society of Jesus, who sowed the word of God in men's hearts, and it pleased His divine bounty to let part of it fall on mine, a signal favour which I attribute with many others to your merit, most holy Father, and to the prayers of all Christian people. Had not I been quite broken with old age and infirmities, and otherwise prevented with grievances of war, I would have come myself in person to visit your holy places, and rendered you obedience, and after kissing your feet I would have set them very devoutly on my head and humbly begged of your Holiness to have made with your hand the sign of the Cross on my heart; but being prevented for the above reasons, I had thought of deputing in my place Don Jerome, my nephew, son to the King of Hyuga, but being at this present far from home, and withal the Father Visitor pressing to be gone, I substituted in his room Don Mancio, his cousin-german. Your Holiness holding the place of God on earth will oblige me and all the Christians in these parts if you will please to favour us with a continuance of your wonted kindness and protection. I received by the Father Visitor the reliquary which your Holiness was pleased to send me, and set it with great respect on my head. Neither tongue nor mouth can express how much I think myself obliged to your Holiness, I will make an end of my letter, for the Father Visitor and Don Mancio will give your Holiness a full account concerning either myself or my kingdom. I render you with all my heart a perfect submission of judgment and affection. I wrote this letter with a mighty dread and fear the eleventh of January, from the nativity of Our Lord 1582.

He that lays himself at the most
> > > sacred feet of your Holiness> > > > > > Francis, King of Bungo."
After the letters had been read, an "address of obedience" was made in behalf of the ambassadors by Father Gonsalez, a Portuguese Jesuit, in which the reasons for their coming were set forth. A reply was made in the name of Gregory, and the ceremony closed by the ambassadors' kneeling again to kiss the feet of the Pope.

A papal medal issued in connection with this embassy bore the inscription: "AB REGIBUS IAPONIOR. PRIMA AD ROMAN. PONT. LEGATIO ET OBEDIENTIA." \[First Legation and Act of Obedience from the Kings of the Japanese to the Roman Pontiffs.\] If this medal and the contents of the letters were known in Japan, they were well fitted to give rise to the suspicion which afterwards grew so strong that the missionaries and their followers were trying to deliver the country into the hands of foreign rulers.

It was only eighteen days after the ambassadors arrived at Rome that Pope Gregory XIII. died. They assisted at his funeral and at the coronation of Sixtus V. The new Pope made them Knights of the Golden Spur. Cardinals, princes, and the representatives of other countries were present at the ceremony of their investiture, the ambassadors of France and Venice performing the office of putting on the golden spurs. A still higher honour was shown when the Pope issued a brief authorising them to take part in consistories, a privilege that was usually accorded only to sovereigns. From the Senate of Rome they received the title of Roman Citizens and Patricians, each of the diplomas being "sealed with a great seal of gold as broad as one's hand, near a finger thick."

Several other cities of Italy were visited by the ambassadors,\* who then went back to Spain. Philip II. fitted up a ship for them at his own expense and added rich presents to the many that they had already received. They embarked at Lisbon, April 30, 1586, for their return voyage. Calms and a long stay at Mozambique so hindered them that it was not until May 29, 1587, that they reached Goa. Here they were detained ten months longer, and then, accompanied by Valegnani, who was appointed the Viceroy's envoy to Japan, they proceeded on their way, reaching Nagasaki July 27, 1590, to find that great changes affecting the interests of Christianity had taken place during the eight years of their absence.
