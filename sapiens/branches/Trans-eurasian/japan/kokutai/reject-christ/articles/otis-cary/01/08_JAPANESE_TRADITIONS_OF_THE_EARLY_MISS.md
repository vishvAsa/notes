title = "08 JAPANESE TRADITIONS OF THE EARLY MISSIONS"

+++



IF history is that version of a story which has been able to gain general acceptance, we shall expect to find that what the Japanese have until recently understood to be the history of Christianity in their country is far different from that which is narrated in European books. During most of the Tokugawa period, all publications containing references to the hated religion were prohibited. There lingered among the people various traditions that were sometimes recorded in manuscripts intended for private circulation. The following narrative is compiled from several manuscripts of the eighteenth century, and shows what stories were current among the people.\* Owing to the difficulty of identifying names, and the confused state of the narratives, it is not easy to connect these accounts with those derived from the letters of the missionaries. It may be conjectured that "Urugan and Furaten" were Fathers Organtin and Froez, who, though not the first to preach in Kyoto, were among the best known of the missionaries, and for this reason the traditions may have gathered about their names. Europeans were known as Southern Barbarians because they approached Japan from the south.

In some of the family records of the daimyos and in other manuscripts the name of Xavier is found, and there are a few other references to the missionaries; but so far as these documents have been made public, they add hut little to our knowledge of events directly connected with the propagation of Christianity.

the temple of the southern barbarians

One day the King of Southern Barbary said to his council: "I am told that far to the east lies a country called Japan and that it abounds in gold, silver, and precious stones. Why should not that land be subjugated and added to my domains?"

"Furnish me with an army," said one of his generals, "and I promise to conquer it for you."

Another general, however, advised caution. "It would be a great mistake," said he, "to make a direct attack upon Japan. Hitherto there have been many attempts to conquer that country. At one time the Mongols went with a vast fleet and a great force of soldiers; but the guardian gods of Japan sent forth a mighty wind that destroyed the ships, so that only three persons escaped with their lives. In my opinion, the best way to make ourselves masters of the land is by means of our religion. Send thither some wise priests who, by healing the sick, giving alms to the poor, and practising magic, shall win the esteem of the people. When a third of the inhabitants have been gained, we can depend upon their helping the army that should then be sent to occupy the country. The Japanese are too brave warriors to be overcome by force of arms, and so you must be content to adopt slow but sure methods."

"What you say seems reasonable," the King said, "but it would require a person of great sagacity to manage such a delicate business as your plan proposes."

"Twenty-five hundred miles west from here," the genera\] replied, "dwell two learned priests named Urugan and Furaten. If you could only induce them to go to Japan, you might rest assured of success."

The King at once sent messengers to call the priests to his palace. In the interview that followed, Urugan said: "The plan proposed is excellent, but we must move cautiously. You should first send out merchants who, by selling cheaply such goods as are pleasing to the Japanese, will gain their good will. On their second voyage I will go with them. Too much haste would spoil everything."

In accordance with this advice, two ships were despatched to Japan. Three priests accompanied the expedition in order to learn the condition of the country and to prepare the way for Urugan. In 1542, these ships reached Funai. While the merchants were selling their goods at less than cost, the priests quietly taught their religion, special advantages in trade being given to those that became converts.

On the second voyage, Urugan accompanied the merchants. He received from the King the following articles to be used as presents to the ruler of Japan:â€” a telescope with which a man one hundred and eighty miles distant could be clearly seen, a microscope, two hundred tiger-skins, twenty guns, one hundred pounds of aloes-wood, a number of rosaries, and a mosquito-net that would cover a space twelve feet square and yet would fold into a box measuring two inches each way.

These ships reached Nagasaki in 1568. Whenever Urugan and another priest that came with him walked about the streets, crowds flocked to see the strange-looking foreigners. Reports of them spread far and wide, at last reaching Nobunaga, who had a great desire to meet the strangers. As, however, the western provinces had not submitted to him, he feared that any request to have the priests sent to Kyoto would be refused and thus he would be put to shame. He therefore sent a messenger, who pretended to come from the Shogun with orders to the officials of Nagasaki that the barbarians should be forwarded to Kyoto, The supposed command was obeyed; but just before the priests reached the capital they were met by some of Nobunaga's retainers and taken to a temple near his castle.

Urugan was soon invited to an audience. On a raised platform in the reception room of the castle was seated Nobunaga, while below him were the members of his family and his chief retainers. All looked with curiosity on the strange guest. He was over seven feet high, with a small head, red cheeks, round yellow eyes, high nose, long ears, broad lips, wide mouth, and teeth like those of a horse. His words were unintelligible, but sounded like the cooing of a dove. In reply to the question why he had come to Japan, he said:

"In order that I may preach Buddha's law, and I request that you will give me permission to do so freely."

After honourably entertaining the stranger and promising to take his petition into consideration, Nobunaga allowed him to return to the temple. He then called a council of his retainers, to which were also summoned several Buddhist and Confucian scholars that he might have their advice about allowing the barbarians to teach their doctrines. For a time all were silent. Then a learned Buddhist priest said:

"This barbarian is a mean-looking fellow, who is evidently unworthy to be a religious teacher. When the founder of Buddhism vanquished the demons that opposed him, they took refuge in foreign lands, where they continued to practise their magic arts, and it was probably from them that this man received instruction, Since Japan has already received Buddhism in its completeness, it has no need of this new doctrine, which is doubtless heretical."

After a little reflection, Nobunaga said: "I should like to see what would come from his preaching. Buddhism first came to us from a foreign land; and unless we give these strangers a fair chance, we cannot tell but that their doctrine is valuable. If any evil should appear in connection with their teaching it will then be easy to prohibit it. I shall allow them to preach."

Not only did Nobunaga grant the request of the foreigners, but he also gave them a piece of land in Kyoto for the erection of a church. When this was built, it received the name Eiroku Temple. The Buddhist priests of Mount Hiei were much enraged that this title, which was that of the current era, had been given to the church. When they urged their abbot to protest he replied:

"There is something about this new temple that I do not understand. What is taught there is apparently heretical. If we wait a little, the thing will probably come to an end of itself. At present the military power is so much in the ascendency that even Buddhism and the Imperial Court have to submit to its dictation. Should we make any trouble over the name of the temple, the only result would be to excite Nobunaga's anger. It will be better to let the matter rest for a while,"

When the priests, who were displeased at the abbot's timidity, came together for a conference, one of their number said:

"The year after the Emperor Kwammu established his capital at Kyoto \[a. d. 794\], he ordered this temple to be built in order that it might protect his palace from the evil influences that come from the north-east. He bestowed upon it the name of his era, a distinction such as no other temple has ever enjoyed. Once, indeed, a temple in Yamato took the name of the era in which it was built, but the priests of our mountain went thither and smashed the tablet on which the title was inscribed. This act of Nobunaga and the barbarians is an insult to the Emperor and to our temple. We must bestir ourselves to uphold our honour."

Excited by these words, over a thousand priests put on armour beneath their robes, while others brought forth the sacred cars; and all hastened towards the Imperial Palace to make their complaint. The Emperor, alarmed at the tumult, summoned his council, who advised that Nobunaga be ordered to have the obnoxious title changed. Henceforth the church was to be known as Nambanji \(Temple of the Southern Barbarians\).

Nobunaga was very angry at this interference of the priests. His resentment was increased by the aid they gave his enemies, and reached its height a few years later when one of their number attempted to assassinate him.

"Both Buddhist and Shinto priests," he declared, "have gained so much wealth that they give themselves over to luxury and idleness. They lay up military stores and sometimes take part in battles. They ought to be shorn of their power."

In accordance with these words he confiscated the lands of many temples; but his chief vengeance was directed against Mount Hiei, whose priests were massacred and the temples burned.

In response to Urugan's request for more missionaries, Furaten came to Japan accompanied by two Brothers who were skilful physicians. The Temple of the Southern Barbarians was now in a flourishing condition. It was richly ornamented with gold, silver, and precious stones. Rich banners hung from the ceilings. The fragrance of burning incense filled the air and penetrated to the street. The missionaries sent out men to hunt up beggars, widows, orphans, outcasts, and lepers. Ail such were brought to the temple, where alms were given to the poor and medicine to the sick. To the multitude thus aided the priests said:

"We came here by order of the King of Southern Barbary, a country a hundred times larger than Japan, whose people, being believers in the true God, never suffer from disease. The land produces many medicinal herbs that are used for the benefit of heathen countries Because you do not believe in the Lord of Heaven, you have been punished by these diseases, and we will show you how much more terrible things await you in the next world."

So saying, they took from its wrapping a large mirror on which they bade their hearers look. The people saw with terror that they were reflected as having the forms of birds or beasts. It added to their fear when they were told that this proved that after death they would become inmates of the hell of animals. One of the Brothers then said to them:

"The only way to escape such a sad fate is to believe in the teaching of the Lord of Heaven. We will not urge you to perform the necessary rites unless you desire to do so. It is for you to choose whether or not you will escape from the threatened evil."

When all begged to receive instruction, they were taught the use of the rosary and were assured that by spending seven days and seven nights in repeating prayers they would be cleansed from their sins and thus fitted for further instruction. At the end of the week they were brought to an inner room that was richly adorned with gold and pearls. There also were Urugan and Furaten clad in golden garments. The Brother that introduced the candidates, said:

"These persons, after being healed of their diseases, have for a week observed the prescribed ceremonies."

"Then," said the priest, "let them be shown a proof of the efficacy of such exercises."

Accordingly the mirror was once more produced, and as the candidates crowded about it, they shed tears of joy when they saw themselves reflected as a company of radiant saints. The priest then said:

"If seven days have wrought so great a change, it cannot be doubted that constancy in the faith will insure the attainment of sainthood. You will now be permitted to worship the chief Deity of the temple. Remember, however, that those who once do this must never let their faith be shaken, even though their bodies should be lacerated by swords or tormented on the rack; for it is only by this God that you can be saved. There remains one more rite to be performed before you can engage in worship."

Each candidate was now presented with a *kurusu* \(cross?\), which was an instrument about two inches square, made of gold and having a handle eighteen inches long. Its surface was studded with nails, making it resemble a horseradish-grater. With these instruments the candidates lacerated their naked bodies, and then they anointed their hands with the flowing blood before joining them in the attitude of prayer.

One of the priests said: "The chief object of Christian worship is Deusu.\* Even the greatest sinner in the world may, through faith in Deusu, go to heaven. You must now engage in His worship."

Urugan then led the way to the "Hall of the Secret Thing." At first the interior was so dark that nothing could be seen.

"Let all approach and worship," said the priest. "You must first repeat the prayer that you have been taught."

When the candidates had said the prayer about three hundred times, the curtain slowly lilted, so as to admit more and more light, until the radiance was like that of noonday The worshippers now saw before them an image of Deusu hanging head-downward upon a cross.

"This," explained the priest, "is the image of our Lord and shows how He suffered for us." The candidates were next taken to the "Hall of Meeting where was the image of a beautiful woman crowned with gems and holding a child. This was explained to mean that, just as a mother embraces her child, so does God love and care for mankind. The worshippers, joining their blood-stained hands, shed tears of thankful joy. Those who so desired were permitted, after inscribing their names in a book, to return home. From those who chose to live in the temple several were selected to receive instruction in medicine and magic. Among these were three men, who by their dissolute habits had been reduced to beggary and afflicted with leprosy. They had now been healed, and on embracing the new religion had received the names Hiyan, Kosumo, and Shimon \(John Cosmo, and Simon\). Under the disguise of merchants or priests, they went about the country practising magic and saying to the people: "Through the benevolence of the foreign physicians, all diseases are freely healed at the Temple of the Southern Barbarians. Not only are poor patients supported while there, but money is also given to their wives and children. Change your religion and become followers of Deusu."

Thus many poor people were led to the temple. The new religion also began to make considerable headway among the upper classes. At last Nobunaga, becoming apprehensive of evil, said to his officers:

"There are beginning to be bad reports about the foreign temple. Its methods are very peculiar. In Buddhism contributions are made to the temples; but who ever heard of a temple that gave alms to the people?

This new religion is gaining too much influence over men's hearts. I am considering the question whether it would not be better to destroy the temple and send the barbarians home. What is your opinion?"

One of the councillors replied: "There is indeed much reason for apprehension, Christianity is gaining many adherents even among the nobility. Yet, since any movement against the temple might lead to an insurrection, it would be better to conceal your suspicious until a favourable time comes for taking vigorous action."

Nobunaga, who agreed with this view, said: "I made the greatest mistake of my life when I permitted the barbarians to teach their doctrines."

Among the prominent persons that became Christians was Takayama Ukon, A revolt having arisen against Nobunaga, Takayama was about to join the rebels; but Nobunaga said to Urugan:

"You assert that your religion teaches righteousness. How then does it happen that Takayama is about to rebel? Unless this wickedness is prevented, you shall no longer be permitted to preach."

The barbarians therefore said to Takayama: "This insurrection is so sure to fail that it would be folly for you to take part in it. Moreover, such a rebellion is contrary to the precepts of our religion."

As a result of their expostulations, Takayama became a leading supporter of Nobunaga, who was thus led to regard Christianity with renewed favour.

When Hideyoshi came into power he was urged to prohibit the foreign religion. He replied that he did not have time then to give the matter such careful consideration as he hoped to do after his authority was fully established.

In Yodo, a few miles from Kyoto, lived a noted architect named Shuri, who had been put in charge of Hideyoshi's extensive building operations. It seemed to the Christians that by gaining this man to their faith a way might be opened for reaching Hideyoshi himself. Hiyan finally decided upon a method of procedure. Knowing that the architect was seldom at home, he one day just at sunset appeared before the gate of Shuri's house. An attendant was sent in to say that a priest from Kyoto had been belated on his return from the provinces, and being timid about travelling after dark, asked for lodging. Shuri's aged mother, who was in charge of the house, did all that she could for the worthy entertainment of such a guest. The next morning, when he was engaged in his devotions, she thought it strange that he paid no attention to the family shrine, where she had carefully lighted the lamps and the incense. After eating breakfast and returning profuse thanks for the hospitality he had received, Hiyan continued on his way to Kyoto.

A few days later a messenger came to Yodo, bringing some beautiful presents in acknowledgment of the favour shown to the belated priest. Though the old lady tried to decline the gifts, the messenger insisted on leaving them. After this, there frequently came letters and presents

Not many months afterwards, Hiyan again appeared one afternoon at Shuri's house, where he stopped to pay his respects. As considerable time was spent in conversation, the old lady said it was too late for the priest to go further; and Hiyan readily assented to an invitation to spend the night. In the evening, while talking about various things, he said to her:

"I do not know to what sect of Buddhism you belong, but the Christian sect is the only one that insures immediate salvation. You ought to become one of its adherents."

"For sixty years," said she, "I have been a devout follower of Amida. I am now too old to think of making a change."

Hiyan, in trying to convince her of the superiority of Christianity, showed her the magic mirror. Though the lady was greatly troubled at what she saw, she simply said:

"I am too ignorant to judge about these matters; but in Kyoto lives a priest who has hitherto been my instructor. If you will sometime meet him here and convince him that what you say is true, I shall then be ready to accept your teaching."

Hiyan gladly consented, for he supposed the priest was some ignorant fellow that could easily be silenced. In reality, he was a very learned man named Haku. All preliminaries having been arranged, Hiyan appeared on the appointed day in splendid apparel. Two of his servants bore a lacquer box that they placed on the floor beside their master. The people of the neighbourhood came in crowds to see what was going on.

After the contestants had saluted each other, Haku asked: "What is the chief object of your worship?"

"We worship Deusu," replied Hiyan, "a divinity who appeared while yet there was nothing in the universe. He created all things. Though men were at first upright, they fell into sin. Deusu had pity on them and gave a prayer by whose repetition they could be saved. Shaka, Amida, and others worshipped in Japan were only men, and so unable to save others. Because Japan does not follow the religion of Deusu, its streets are filled with beggars and outcasts, while its people are afflicted with grievous diseases. Southern Barbary, because of its religion, has no paupers, robbers, nor invalids. If the teaching of Shaka and Amida is true, let them prove it by punishing me for what I am about to do."

So saying, he took from the box at his side some Buddhist books, which he tore into shreds, ground under his feet, spat upon, and otherwise insulted. Then he cried out:

"Do you see what I have done? That I suffer no harm proves your religion to be false. Forsake it, and enter the true way of salvation."

The astonished bystanders held their breath, wondering what Haku would do; but he quietly asked: "Is that all you have to say?"

"There is much more," replied Hiyan, "that I might add; but this is sufficient for the present."

Haku then said with a derisive laugh: "This deity that you call Deusu appears to be very stupid. Instead of creating men and then being obliged to take so much trouble to save them, it would have been better never to have made them at all. The sacred books make no mention of this Deusu, and so your teaching must be heretical. I am not surprised that you could insult the books with impunity. No punishment is sent to rats and mice that gnaw and defile them; for, being only animals, they know no better. If your teaching is more correct than ours, bring me some proof from the sacred books. Come, show me even one such proof."

Hiyan, knowing his inability to meet this challenge, turned red in the face. At last, he took out the magic mirror, saying as he thrust it before Haku:

"Learn from this your true nature and the fate that awaits you in the future life."

Though Haku saw himself reflected as having the head of a horse, he showed no sign of surprise. Taking a flower from a vase, he held it before the mirror. It also appeared as a horse's head. He then asked for a nearer view of the mirror, and Hiyan, suspecting nothing, allowed Haku to take it in his own hands. The latter suddenly turned it around, and the people saw that Hiyan himself was reflected as having a head like that of a horse.

Haku threw down the mirror with a laugh. "In my youth," he said, "such toys were very common. In the process of manufacture, a picture is drawn with lacquer on the surface of the metal, which is then re-heated and polished. Are you not ashamed to deceive people by such tricks?"

Hiyan hung his head; then crying out: "You are a fool and no fit antagonist for me," he was about to leave the room. Haku caught him by the sleeve; but the impostor, freeing himself from the priest's grasp, fled in the direction of Kyoto.

"I had supposed," said Haku, "that it would be necessary to debate concerning astronomy, geography, and other sciences. Since he had recourse to insulting words and acts, I was forced to answer him according to his folly. His doctrine is surely heretical, and in due time the Government will doubtless prohibit such teaching."

Shuri reported these events to Hideyoshi, who soon after ordered the barbarians to be sent home and their temple to be destroyed. The Japanese believers fled to different parts of the country. Hiyan became a mountain priest and went about seeking opportunities for quietly teaching the barbarian religion. Kosumo and Shimon changed their names and became physicians. They also practised legerdemain, being often invited to furnish amusement at banquets. In 1588, Hideyoshi, happening to hear of their skill, called them to exhibit it before him. After they had done many strange things, they offered to show the assembled guests anything that might be desired. The court ladies, to whom the choice was left, asked to see Mount Fuji. To this request the magician said:

"We are unable to bring the mountain into this room; but, if the paper windows can be closed for a minute, we will grant your desire."

The windows were closed, and when, after some words of incantation, they were re-opened, the guests saw that the appearance of the garden had wholly changed, and beyond it they could see the beautiful form of the mountain. After other noted places had been shown in the same way, Hideyoshi said:

"Though there are many stories about ghosts, I have never seen one. Can you make a ghost appear?"

"Ghosts do not appear by daylight," answered the magicians; "but if you will wait until evening, you shall see one."

Accordingly, when the evening's feast was concluded, the magicians caused the candles to be extinguished. The full moon was shining brightly; but soon clouds began to float over its surface, while a chill breeze sighed mournfully through the branches of the trees. Finally, from the deep shade of a clump of shrubbery in the garden, there glided forth the form of a woman clad in white, her hair disheveled, and her face turned away from the spectators. All were filled with terror at the apparition. The ladies fled shrieking to the rear of the palace. The ghost drew nearer and could be distinctly seen, notwithstanding that the moon was now completely hidden by dark clouds. The spirit turned its face and fixed its eyes upon Hideyoshi, who carefully scanned the features and then called out:

"Enough\! Let there be no more of this\!"

"We obey," said the magicians, as they closed the windows. When these were re-opened, the ghost was no longer visible and the moon was once more shining brightly.

The magicians, who had hoped that their skill would win Hideyoshi's approbation, were in great dismay when he ordered them to he cast into prison. In explaining this to the guests, Hideyoshi said:

"These men are not mere sleight-of-hand performers, hut Christians who have hitherto escaped detection. The ghost was that of a woman whom I loved in my younger days and who was executed for poisoning her rival. Though this happened long ago, these men have in some way gained a knowledge of the affair, and they doubtless expected that I would reward them for letting me see again the woman I once loved,"

The two men were found guilty of believing in the barbarian religion, and were crucified.

In the summer of 1615, a great drought prevailed throughout central Japan. All prayers and incantations proving futile, the despairing farmers saw their fields being parched by heat. Hiyan, under the disguise of a Buddhist priest, now returned to the neighborhood of Kyoto. Going to one of the villages, he assured the farmers that he was able to bring the desired rain. In accordance with his directions, a large heap of brush-woodland charcoal was collected and set on fire. Hiyan then jumped into the midst of the flames, moving about among them unscathed as he repeated his incantations.

Meanwhile a report of what was going on had reached the officials in Kyoto, who hastened to the village and arrested Hiyan as he emerged from the fire. On being taken to the city, he was asked to what sect he belonged. He named a temple of which he professed to be a priest; but on making inquiry, it was found that the abbot knew nothing of such a person. He was finally recognised as a Christian by some one who had formerly known him in the Temple of the Southern Barbarians.

A few days later he was led out for execution. Crowds assembled to witness the spectacle. The prisoner had hardly been bound to the cross when he suddenly changed to a rat. Great confusion ensued. The officers tried to catch the creature. "There it is\!" they shouted; "Step on it I There it goes\! Kill it\! Kill it\!"

In the midst of the excitement, an immense hawk came swooping through the air, grasped the rat in its talons, and flew away. The wondering people stood gazing into the sky until the bird vanished in the distance. The officers trembled at the thought that they would be held responsible for the prisoner. When, however, their report had been given, they were told that, though blameworthy for letting him escape, yet, in view of the fact that he had been re-captured, no punishment would be inflicted upon them. All were filled with joy at the Government's clemency.

A strict search was now made for other Christians, Those that were found were sewed up in straw sacks, their heads sticking out like those of tortoises, and thus they were piled in heaps upon the dry bed of the river that flows through Kyoto.

At first the sufferers called out: "We have great reason for thanksgiving. Since we suffer here on earth, we shall be re-born in Paradise. Make haste to put an end to our lives."

After a while one of the officers said to them: "Why do you not recant? You have nothing to hope in the present or the future. We have heard you say that when in trouble you would be nourished with heavenly food; but no one gives you so much as a rice cracknel."

Some near the bottom of the heap, being unable to endure the agony any longer, declared their readiness to renounce Christianity; and these were released. There still remained fifty or sixty, who called out to the others: "Cowards\! Cowards\!"

Those that had recanted replied: "You may say to us what you like. So long as we are free, we do not care, even though in the future world we should be re-born as cats or mice."

The officers now had three hundred horse-loads of fagots brought and heaped on the sand. When the Christians were told that they would be burned, they were in great terror and asked permission to recant. Even at that late hour, they were allowed to go free.

It was commonly reported that these recantations were not genuine. Accordingly strict orders were issued that priests must annually make investigations in their parishes and give to the people certificates that they were not Christians. When any believers in the barbarian religion were discovered, they were burned, crucified, or drowned. Thus the evil was stamped out of the central provinces. In more distant parts of the land, there continued to be those that secretly adhered to the faith of the Southern Barbarians. Those of Arima and Amakusa united in the great Shimabara Revolt that resulted in their utter extermination.
