HALF a century has elapsed since Japan was re-opened to missionary effort. The preceding chapters have narrated the more prominent events connected with the development of Japanese Christianity in those five wonderful decades. In addition to what has been related, there have been many ways in which Christianity has helped Japan to become what it is at the present day. Indeed, there is good reason for saying that, directly and indirectly, Christianity has been the chief force in effecting the changes that have taken place, so that a pamphlet written by Dr. W. E. Griffis is justified in bearing the title: "Christ the Creator of the New Japan."\* In that pamphlet Dr. Griffis says:

"I could never imagine Bushido of itself alone, or Japanese Buddhism, or Shinto, or the Government, originating a Red Cross, a Peace Conference, a system of hospitals, a Woman's University, the emancipation and elevation to citizenship of pariahs and outcasts \(*eta* and *hinin\)*, freedom of the press, the granting of full toleration of religion, or securing of real representative political institutions. In scarcely one of those features in the New Japan most admirable to Christians or to the best men of the Occident, do I recognise the legitimate offspring of Bushido or forces inherent in Japan. These have been propagated, not developed from within. No, it is to the Spirit of Jesus that we are to accredit most of what is morally superb in the New Japan."

Dr. Griffis shows how some of those who led in the changes that have taken place had new thoughts and purposes inspired in their souls by reading Christian books or coming in contact with Christian teachers, and he says with an emphasis that he expresses by the use of capital letters:

"BEHIND ALMOST EVERY ONE OF THE RADICAL REFORMS THAT HAVE MADE A NEW JAPAN STANDS A MAN—TOO OFTEN A MARTYR—WHO WAS DIRECTLY MOVED BY THE SPIRIT OF JESUS, OR WHO IS OR WAS A PUPIL OF THE MISSIONARIES."

The early missionaries, and to a less extent those of a later day, have had great opportunities for exerting influences whose results are not given in tables of statistics. Simply as those that by teaching European languages introduced young men and women to Western literature, they opened the way by which the nation received ideas that have revolutionised its life. To them also came persons who had enquiries to make concerning agriculture, trade, manufactures, and other departments of human activity. Orders for machines were sent through them, merchants asked them to write business letters to firms in foreign lands. The schools that they founded and the societies in whose organisation they had a part stirred up the Buddhists to similar enterprises. Dr. Verbeck organised the school that developed into the first Imperial University. He was for a long time the only foreign counsellor of the Government', and it meant not a little that the advice given in that formative period of the new nation came from one who was a conscientious and broad-minded Christian.

Nearly all the philanthropic efforts for the various classes of people needing such help—orphans, lepers, the blind, the imbecile, wayward children, discharged prisoners, etc.—were begun by missionaries or by Japanese Christians; and in some cases their example has stirred up the Government or those of other religions to care for the unfortunate.\* It will be remembered that a missionary suggested to the Government methods that it afterwards adopted for prison reform, and that another was the chief instrument in bringing about such a change in laws as has weakened the hold of licensed vice upon its victims. In general it may be said that all movements for moral reform look to the Christians as their natural leaders. Not least in the helpful influences coming to the nation have been those due to the examples of noble, educated, Christian womanhood. The homes of the Protestant missionaries and of other persons that in a foreign land have remained true to the ideals of those from which they came, and also the homes, gradually growing more numerous, that have been established by Japanese believers, have made the very name "Christian home" to be widely known as that of the social institution most needed for the moral purification of the land. The influence that Christianity has had on public morals, social customs, the care of the sick, laws, journalism, general literature, music, and even on the very language of the people has been great and beneficial. Christianity is a living force entering into the spiritual nature of men, and what touches the spirit must sooner or later affect all outward acts.

History's proper domain is the past, but no sooner do we turn from her to look upon what now exists than she tears it from our grasp and claims it for her own. While words are being penned and ere they issue from the press, what they describe in the present tense have become things of the past. Nor will history permit us to say that she has no concern with the future, for she knows the time will come when that also will be hers. Moreover, the future is the fruitage of what was sown in the past, and as the farmer when he planted his fields had thoughts of what he will hereafter reap, so history sometimes looks forward and from the experiences of the past ventures to prophesy what the future record will contain.

The time at which this history is being written sees Christianity a recognised force in Japan, The statistics to be given in an appendix will show what can be told by figures; yet every one who has had occasion to examine such tables carefully knows how imperfect a guide they are to actual conditions. In one way they may give too favourable an impression, for lists of church-members often include those that are Christians only in name, and it may be true that some of the churches themselves have so little real life that it would be better to have them struck from the denominational rolls. On the other hand, such statistics fall far short of showing the position to which Christianity has attained. There are outside of the churches, many persons who in their hearts believe the essential doctrines of Christianity and are trying to regulate their lives thereby. Moreover, as has already been said, Christianity is in thousands of ways touching Japanese life, thus accomplishing what cannot be statistically reported and what often fails to be recognised as among its effects.

Quality is certainly of much more importance than quantity in deciding how much has already been accomplished and what are the prospects for the future. A person who examines a work from the outside can be more unprejudiced than one closely associated with it, and so may be able to see more clearly both its excellencies and its defects. Hence, the opinion of a sympathetic but keen observer of Protestant Christianity in Japan may be advantageously quoted at this point. Rev. George S. Eddy, well known as a worker in India for the Young Men's Christian Association, wrote as follows, after a visit to Japan:

"Our impressions of the characteristics of Japanese Christianity, including its virtues and its faults, include:

"\(1\) *Strong independence* with a readiness of the Christians to stand upon their own feet, to bear responsibility, to undertake leadership, and to be unwilling to accept foreign aid a moment longer than is necessary, though receiving everything that can be learned from foreign countries.

"\(2\) *Self-support* and the willingness to pay the price of independence. In this respect India has much to learn from Japan.

"\(3\) *Strength of character* and the ability of believers to think and act for themselves.

"\(4\) *A too liberal theology* with a tendency to take up with every new doctrine, a fondness for rationalistic thought, and a lack of stability in theological thinking, and consequently a lack of deep spirituality.

"\(5\) *Conservatism* in method and a lack of a sufficient sense of evangelistic responsibility. In fact, Japanese have been so taken up with the problem of self-government and self-support that they do not seem, as yet, to have given the prominence they should to the thought of the evangelisation of Japan. In this respect, however, they will soon advance rapidly.

"\(6\) *The high social position,* education, and, as compared with India, the wealth of the Christian community, and its failure to extend sufficiently its operation to the masses and the lower classes.

"\(7\) *Unity,* with an emphasis on practical issues, and an unwillingness to perpetuate the divisions and discussions of the historic Christianity of the West. The Japanese are insisting upon and largely effecting a union of various groups of churches, and are looking toward ultimate union in Japan."\*

What, then, of the future? That form of the Japanese verb to which Europeans have given the name "Future tense" expresses in reality nothing more than probability, and however sure a person may be of the ultimate victory of Christianity, he may well hesitate about stating too positively when and how this is to be brought about. There have, indeed, been some writers who declared that Japan will never become a Christian nation; but at the present day he who makes such an assertion must be a bold prophet and one who has given little study to the trend of events. It may be that the outward form of Christianity in Japan will never be like what is to be seen in England, America, France, or Russia; but what the past fifty years have seen accomplished ought to make even a person who does not recognise God's hand in history acknowledge a strong probability that ere many more decades pass away there will be a Christian Japan. What peculiarities of church government, philosophical dogma, and practical activities will prevail cannot be foretold except as some persons may be sufficiently wise to predict certain features from the past history and present characteristics of the churches. These churches must meet and solve problems such as have come to those of other lands, and also some peculiar to themselves. Difficulties and dangers lie before them. It may be that at times the Kingdom of God will seem to be making no progress and even to be losing ground; but those who have faith in God cannot doubt its final establishment in Japan, and they rejoice in the thought of how much this will mean for the regeneration of Asia, and for the hastening of the time when the whole world shall know and serve the living God.

\* The Japan Year Book for 1907, \(p. 260\), published in English but written by Japanese, says: "It is a significant fact that by far the greater part of private charity work of any large scope is conducted by Christians, both natives and aliens, and that the part played by Buddhists in this direction is shamefully out of proportion. As to Shintoists, they are privileged, in popular estimate, to keep aloof from matters of this kind." In February, 1909, after a thorough examination of all charities in the country, gifts were made by the Japanese Government to seventy-nine philanthropic institutions. A large number of these were under Protestant or Roman Catholic auspices.

Churches formed in connection with some of the other missions combine in such a way that each group practically forms a united church.

B

statistics

The latest available statistics of the missions and churches are those for 1907 as given in the Sixth Annual Issue of the Christian Movement in Japan \(Tokyo, 1908\). The following table is based upon one found in that hook. Only the most important items are given here, as the reports of some missions upon the other matters are so incomplete as to render the statistics unsatisfactory. The absence of figures does not necessarily mean that the mission in question has nothing under the heading; but in some cases shows only a failure to report. The statistics for the Roman Catholics differ somewhat from those given in the volume on Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox Missions the latter being those for 1908.

Besides what is reported in the table, there are two independent churches; one having about 300 members and the other 160.

The numbers of missionaries given in connection with the Japan Methodist Church, the Nihon Kirisuto Kyokwai, and the Nihon Seikokwai are those of persons belonging to the missions that co-operate with those churches.



a. Admitted to Christian fellowship on confession of faith. There seems to be some mistake in the figures given for full membership.

b. Teachers in government schools, secured under Y. M. C. A. auspices.

c. Japanese secretaries.

d. The total baptisms of adults and infants were 838.
